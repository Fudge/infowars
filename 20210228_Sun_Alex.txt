[00:00.000 --> 00:10.680]  It's February 28th on this Sunday live transmission.
[00:10.680 --> 00:17.880]  President Trump has just started speaking from Florida at the 2021 C-PAC that the control
[00:17.880 --> 00:21.840]  corporate press and big tech are trying to censor and block everywhere.
[00:21.840 --> 00:28.120]  But before we hear from the real president, let's hear from the impostor.
[00:28.120 --> 00:35.960]  Let's hear from the puppet who just did a victory lap Friday in Houston, Texas.
[00:35.960 --> 00:37.240]  I think he's getting on the plane.
[00:37.240 --> 00:44.240]  He told me last he came in to see me last event and representatives.
[00:44.240 --> 00:50.840]  Shirley Jackson Lee, Al Green, Sylvia Garcia, Lizzie Pinnelli.
[00:50.840 --> 00:55.560]  Excuse me, Pinnell and what am I doing here?
[00:55.560 --> 01:02.200]  I'm going to lose track here and Mayor Turner, Judge Hidalgo.
[01:02.200 --> 01:07.800]  Thank you all for welcoming us and Jill and I wanted to visit Texas today for a couple
[01:07.800 --> 01:08.800]  of reasons.
[01:08.800 --> 01:12.280]  Anybody that's been around family that's really old or has Alzheimer's knows the most
[01:12.280 --> 01:14.240]  common things and say, where am I?
[01:14.240 --> 01:15.240]  What's going on?
[01:15.240 --> 01:16.240]  Who are you?
[01:16.240 --> 01:18.320]  And then, oh, you're my, you're my grandson.
[01:18.320 --> 01:23.000]  Wait, we're, we're at the football game.
[01:23.000 --> 01:25.800]  Wait, my sister just had a stroke.
[01:25.800 --> 01:28.040]  No, no, no, your sister had a stroke and died eight years ago.
[01:28.040 --> 01:29.520]  No, no, we got to go to the hospital.
[01:29.520 --> 01:30.520]  Wait, oh, you're right.
[01:30.520 --> 01:31.520]  That's right.
[01:31.520 --> 01:32.520]  I got Alzheimer's.
[01:32.520 --> 01:34.640]  Oh, you're my, you're my grandson.
[01:34.640 --> 01:35.640]  I remember.
[01:35.640 --> 01:36.640]  Wow.
[01:36.640 --> 01:40.480]  I mean, it's like in the, in the gear out of gear and you have Bongino coming out with
[01:40.480 --> 01:43.560]  a Secret Service connection saying he's far gone.
[01:43.560 --> 01:47.320]  Well, we don't need Bongino to tell us that nothing against Bongino.
[01:47.320 --> 01:49.160]  You can look at it.
[01:49.160 --> 01:51.600]  He's degrading by the day.
[01:51.600 --> 01:53.720]  This is a fiasco.
[01:53.720 --> 01:57.760]  Let's actually hear from the real president that won on the landslide and they stole it
[01:57.760 --> 01:58.760]  bigger than Dallas.
[01:58.760 --> 02:00.240]  I agree with the CEO of Goya Food.
[02:00.240 --> 02:02.120]  So they said the board had gagged.
[02:02.120 --> 02:09.320]  Well, I guess they didn't gagging because here's Robert Unavey in the news telling the
[02:09.320 --> 02:13.640]  truth that President Trump is legitimate and still acting president.
[02:13.640 --> 02:16.240]  We have to keep exposing that.
[02:16.240 --> 02:20.200]  That's the truth to then expose the election fraud and not let them do it again.
[02:20.200 --> 02:24.080]  Here's some of the president will come back with more of it.
[02:24.080 --> 02:28.840]  Well, thank you very much and hello, CPAC.
[02:28.840 --> 02:30.840]  Do you miss me yet?
[02:30.840 --> 02:33.840]  Do you miss me?
[02:33.840 --> 02:42.400]  A lot of things going on to so many wonderful friends, conservatives and fellow citizens
[02:42.400 --> 02:44.760]  in this room and all across our country.
[02:44.760 --> 02:52.000]  I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we begun together.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.480]  We went through a journey like nobody else.
[02:54.480 --> 02:56.400]  There's never been a journey like it.
[02:56.400 --> 02:59.400]  There's never been a journey so successful.
[02:59.400 --> 03:05.520]  We began it together four years ago and it is far from being over.
[03:05.520 --> 03:15.200]  We're going to come back and go back to him where we left off.
[03:15.200 --> 03:16.640]  We have the main feed.
[03:16.640 --> 03:22.320]  He's about 10 minutes into the speech that's going live right now at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[03:22.320 --> 03:27.160]  If you go to the front page of infowars.com, you can see the page that says live coverage
[03:27.160 --> 03:33.800]  of President Trump's historic 2021 CPAC speech and you have our feed of the show that left
[03:33.800 --> 03:36.680]  off commercials and myself talking a bunch of news and clips.
[03:36.680 --> 03:42.880]  If you want to see the whole speech, it's right underneath my live feed there for you
[03:42.880 --> 03:47.080]  and I hope that you will share it because it has millions of people watching it online
[03:47.080 --> 03:48.080]  right now.
[03:48.080 --> 03:53.560]  I was clicking on the YouTube links and Fox links and CPAC links but it's almost nowhere
[03:53.560 --> 03:54.560]  else.
[03:54.560 --> 03:58.480]  They're really fighting and they had it at the Hyatt Hotel.
[03:58.480 --> 04:01.800]  Democrats tried to have Hyatt cancel CPAC.
[04:01.800 --> 04:07.200]  You see Twitter ban CPAC and ban the videos being posted along with Facebook and others.
[04:07.200 --> 04:14.320]  This is really a criminal international consortium openly trying to meddle in the electoral process
[04:14.320 --> 04:16.520]  and communications of the American people.
[04:16.520 --> 04:20.720]  You're not allowed to have the president, the leader of the insurrection there.
[04:20.720 --> 04:25.760]  My gosh, we killed four citizens that day and a cop had a stroke a few days later and
[04:25.760 --> 04:26.760]  died.
[04:26.760 --> 04:29.080]  Family now says he did not get hit in the head with a fire extinguisher.
[04:29.080 --> 04:31.880]  They call that the most deadly attack in U.S. history.
[04:31.880 --> 04:34.000]  Wow, that's the biggest lie in U.S. history.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.160]  We're sad for the dead cop though.
[04:36.160 --> 04:40.200]  But this was definitely a mainly a setup of the Democrats and a few useful idiots.
[04:40.200 --> 04:44.720]  But when we come back in 60 seconds, back into Trump and then just huge positive news
[04:44.720 --> 04:47.960]  even bigger than Friday we've got for you here today.
[04:47.960 --> 04:51.920]  Whatever you do, remember this is a participation sport of liberty.
[04:51.920 --> 04:55.160]  So spread the links to band.video and infowars.com.
[04:55.160 --> 04:56.440]  That's how we override big tech.
[04:56.440 --> 05:01.440]  I salute you all.
[05:01.440 --> 05:03.560]  I knew Trump was in battle.
[05:03.560 --> 05:09.880]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of the enemy.
[05:09.880 --> 05:12.720]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[05:12.720 --> 05:17.160]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chest, 5G chest, he's invincible.
[05:17.160 --> 05:20.520]  And I understand why people aren't to believe that because this is scary what's going on.
[05:20.520 --> 05:22.520]  The global government in the new world order.
[05:22.520 --> 05:26.200]  Now that people look up the facts, that's real, they will try to come save them from.
[05:26.200 --> 05:27.800]  Well, Trump sure has held pride.
[05:27.800 --> 05:32.200]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled depending on the
[05:32.200 --> 05:34.440]  drug once you find that executive order.
[05:34.440 --> 05:36.320]  We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[05:36.320 --> 05:40.360]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed and now people are
[05:40.360 --> 05:44.280]  going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything else.
[05:44.280 --> 05:49.000]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate where Trump's own lawyers
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.680]  are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged
[05:53.680 --> 05:58.960]  all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in folks, the swamp is deep.
[05:58.960 --> 06:19.960]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[06:19.960 --> 06:20.960]  Welcome.
[06:20.960 --> 06:24.760]  My friends, thank you for joining us on the Sunday, February 28th transmission.
[06:24.760 --> 06:29.960]  I am your host, Alex Jones, President Trump as we speak is giving his speech in Florida
[06:29.960 --> 06:35.320]  at CPAC and the control corporate press, the Chi Coms, the Democratic Party, the enemies
[06:35.320 --> 06:38.560]  of America have tried to get the event canceled.
[06:38.560 --> 06:43.760]  They have tried to boycott Hyatt for even allowing thought criminals to meet, not content
[06:43.760 --> 06:48.240]  to ban President Trump's speech off of Twitter.
[06:48.240 --> 06:51.400]  Yes, they banned the CPAC live feeds.
[06:51.400 --> 06:58.800]  We have feeds at infowars.com in the headline article, Sunday Live Watch Trump Deliver Historic
[06:58.800 --> 06:59.800]  CPAC Speech 2021.
[06:59.800 --> 07:06.320]  Right here on the Alex Jones show, we have that live feed right below.
[07:06.320 --> 07:09.920]  We'd rather just see that uninterrupted, but we're here playing excerpts of it throughout
[07:09.920 --> 07:10.920]  the next two hours.
[07:10.920 --> 07:14.640]  He's been speaking about 15 minutes, but we're just following along and pausing and
[07:14.640 --> 07:17.320]  as we go to break and then coming back and giving commentary.
[07:17.320 --> 07:19.800]  But let's do this first.
[07:19.800 --> 07:28.520]  Let's play Joe Biden, who surrogate Chuck E. Schumer said Texas got what it deserved.
[07:28.520 --> 07:32.040]  He hopes we've learned our lesson that we're just idiots and that we can't supply our
[07:32.040 --> 07:37.560]  own power and that we need him, someone that's managed New York into the ground to run our
[07:37.560 --> 07:42.120]  lives even though we have the Department of Energy document with the governor begging
[07:42.120 --> 07:47.800]  for them to waive federal law and federal regulations to let us boost our power outputs
[07:47.800 --> 07:49.480]  ahead of the storm.
[07:49.480 --> 07:52.280]  They said no until the power started going out.
[07:52.280 --> 07:59.640]  When the grid was almost completely out, ERCOT begged again on Valentine's Day and they
[07:59.640 --> 08:05.960]  allowed Texas graciously to up the power without fines or criminal charges.
[08:05.960 --> 08:13.240]  It's a fact and it's a fact Obama shut down over 120 power plants in Texas over 1000 nationwide
[08:13.240 --> 08:17.800]  and it's a fact without those clean burning coal facilities we can't operate.
[08:17.800 --> 08:24.120]  Now the Democrats in California want to ban using natural gas to create power.
[08:24.120 --> 08:28.720]  We are being strangled, but China has thousands of dirty plants with no scrubbers and they
[08:28.720 --> 08:32.440]  have energy about one-third the cost of ours when it comes to electricity.
[08:32.440 --> 08:34.440]  So you build your factories there, not here.
[08:34.440 --> 08:35.440]  It's real simple.
[08:35.440 --> 08:40.040]  So here's Joe Biden doing his victory lap, surveying the devastation in Texas that he
[08:40.040 --> 08:45.240]  and his party helped engineer with their stupid windmills and their shutdowns of our power
[08:45.240 --> 08:50.760]  plants not even knowing where he is and every time he speaks, last week's town hall, one
[08:50.760 --> 08:54.640]  where he said communist China should invade Hong Kong and that having people in death
[08:54.640 --> 08:55.640]  camps is good.
[08:55.640 --> 08:56.640]  Remember that?
[08:56.640 --> 08:57.640]  He said, where am I?
[08:57.640 --> 08:58.640]  I said, where am I?
[08:58.640 --> 08:59.640]  Where am I?
[08:59.640 --> 09:03.120]  And his people were like, you're on CNN, sir.
[09:03.120 --> 09:08.200]  Well, here he is again in Houston Friday, not knowing what planted his little rotten
[09:08.200 --> 09:09.200]  asses on.
[09:09.200 --> 09:11.920]  I think he's getting on a plane.
[09:11.920 --> 09:15.520]  He told me last he came in to see me last event.
[09:15.520 --> 09:25.880]  And representatives, Shirley Jackson Lee, Al Green, Sylvia Garcia, Lizzie Pinnelli, excuse
[09:25.880 --> 09:30.200]  me, Pinnell, and what am I doing here?
[09:30.200 --> 09:35.240]  I'm going to lose track here, and Mayor Turner, Judge Meadow...
[09:35.240 --> 09:36.240]  That's enough.
[09:36.240 --> 09:37.240]  He just goes on babbling.
[09:37.240 --> 09:40.320]  And we've all been there with our grandparents and great-grandparents and seen them act like
[09:40.320 --> 09:41.320]  this.
[09:41.320 --> 09:43.480]  And they're usually dead within a few years once their brain's like this.
[09:43.480 --> 09:47.720]  So that's who the globalists put in on purpose, a total puppet they control.
[09:47.720 --> 09:51.880]  Now let's go to the real president who won in the landslide when they closed the polls
[09:51.880 --> 09:54.600]  and stopped the vote counting.
[09:54.600 --> 10:00.560]  In those six states, he won by 2 points, 3 points, 4 points, 5 points, 6 points, double-triple-quadruple
[10:00.560 --> 10:02.680]  his margin in battleground states before.
[10:02.680 --> 10:06.280]  Bigger margins in states like Texas and Florida than he got four years ago.
[10:06.280 --> 10:08.400]  You know the rest of the story.
[10:08.400 --> 10:13.600]  But then magically, those magic spikes happened as the vans were pulled up and generally Chinese
[10:13.600 --> 10:18.040]  nationals got out, had their swipe cards, went in, and it was a big victory.
[10:18.040 --> 10:21.720]  And witnesses that saw it, so they were all scan the same.
[10:21.720 --> 10:27.120]  In Pennsylvania and Michigan other states, it was voted for no one but the presidency
[10:27.120 --> 10:29.000]  and Senate races.
[10:29.000 --> 10:30.000]  That's all they cared about.
[10:30.000 --> 10:31.000]  Senate presidency.
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.000]  Just get that done.
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.680]  The Senate, the presidency, the Senate, the presidency, the Senate, the presidency.
[10:36.680 --> 10:41.800]  Remember the USPS driver, he had all these big boxes of ballots, he looked Senate, and
[10:41.800 --> 10:46.400]  it's all for Joe Biden, and it's all done by a computer, not by a pen or a pencil.
[10:46.400 --> 10:50.440]  Oh, there's no evidence, but no one's allowed to say there's evidence either.
[10:50.440 --> 10:53.840]  Oh, you don't have a right to say it or you'll be taking off the Internet.
[10:53.840 --> 10:55.040]  You'll lose your radio show.
[10:55.040 --> 10:56.040]  We're all told.
[10:56.040 --> 10:58.440]  You're not supposed to ask questions.
[10:58.440 --> 11:03.160]  Well, I love what the CEO of Goya Foods just said at CPAC.
[11:03.160 --> 11:08.480]  He said, President Trump is the, quote, legitimate and still acting president during CPAC speech.
[11:08.480 --> 11:12.200]  And we are following along with a speech about 15 minutes behind, again, where he's actually
[11:12.200 --> 11:16.320]  yet, we'll play most of it here tonight with my commentary, but let's go ahead and get to
[11:16.320 --> 11:28.840]  five minutes or so before we go to break of the president's beginning of a speech.
[11:28.840 --> 11:34.440]  Our movement of proud hardworking, and you know what this is, the hardest working people,
[11:34.440 --> 11:41.800]  hardworking American patriots, is just getting started, and in the end, we will win.
[11:41.800 --> 11:42.800]  We will win.
[11:42.800 --> 11:43.800]  Yes!
[11:43.800 --> 11:44.800]  Never surrender.
[11:44.800 --> 11:49.040]  We've been doing a lot of winning.
[11:49.040 --> 11:55.240]  As we gather this week, we're in the middle of a historic struggle for America's future,
[11:55.240 --> 12:02.040]  America's culture, and America's institutions, borders, and most cherished principles.
[12:02.040 --> 12:09.340]  Our security, our prosperity, and our very identity as Americans is at stake, like perhaps
[12:09.340 --> 12:11.840]  at no other time.
[12:11.840 --> 12:17.240]  So no matter how much the Washington establishment and the powerful special interests may want
[12:17.240 --> 12:24.760]  to silence us, let there be no doubt we will be victorious, and America will be stronger
[12:24.760 --> 12:27.240]  and greater than ever before.
[12:27.240 --> 12:28.240]  Yes!
[12:28.240 --> 12:29.240]  Yes!
[12:29.240 --> 12:33.400]  We will defeat the globalist.
[12:33.400 --> 12:38.400]  I want to thank my great friends, Matt and Mercedes Schlapp.
[12:38.400 --> 12:41.400]  Matt, thank you.
[12:41.400 --> 12:47.760]  Mercedes, thank you very much, and the American Conservative Union for hosting this extraordinary
[12:47.760 --> 12:48.760]  event.
[12:48.760 --> 12:49.920]  They're talking about it all over the world, Matt.
[12:49.920 --> 12:52.920]  I know you don't like that, but that's okay.
[12:52.920 --> 12:53.920]  All over the world.
[12:53.920 --> 12:59.920]  I also want to pay my love and respect to the great Rush Limbaugh.
[12:59.920 --> 13:00.920]  Absolutely.
[13:00.920 --> 13:02.920]  Boy, my eyes, Rush.
[13:02.920 --> 13:03.920]  That betrayals.
[13:03.920 --> 13:04.920]  Rush wasn't perfect.
[13:04.920 --> 13:05.920]  It was pro-America.
[13:05.920 --> 13:06.920]  Believe in the country.
[13:06.920 --> 13:18.000]  Who is watching closely and smiling down on us, he's watching, and he's loving it,
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.500]  and he loves Catherine.
[13:19.500 --> 13:21.200]  Catherine, thank you for being here.
[13:21.200 --> 13:22.200]  So great.
[13:22.200 --> 13:23.200]  Thank you, Catherine.
[13:23.200 --> 13:24.200]  He loved you, Catherine.
[13:24.200 --> 13:25.200]  I will tell you that.
[13:25.200 --> 13:26.200]  So fantastic.
[13:26.200 --> 13:27.200]  Thank you, Catherine, very much.
[13:27.200 --> 13:36.840]  To each and every one of you here at CPAC, I am more grateful to you than you will ever
[13:36.840 --> 13:37.840]  know.
[13:37.840 --> 13:42.640]  We are gathered this afternoon to talk about the future of our movement, the future of
[13:42.640 --> 13:47.440]  our party, and the future of our beloved country.
[13:47.440 --> 13:55.200]  For the next four years, the brave Republicans in this room will be at the heart of the effort
[13:55.200 --> 14:01.920]  to oppose the radical Democrats, the fake news media, and their toxic cancel culture.
[14:01.920 --> 14:07.840]  Nothing new to our ears, cancel culture, and I want you to know that I'm going to continue
[14:07.840 --> 14:11.280]  to fight right by your side.
[14:11.280 --> 14:17.640]  We will do what we've done right from the beginning, which is to win.
[14:17.640 --> 14:22.520]  We're not starting new parties.
[14:22.520 --> 14:26.420]  You know, they kept saying, he's going to start a brand new party.
[14:26.420 --> 14:27.920]  We have the Republican Party.
[14:27.920 --> 14:31.520]  It's going to unite and be stronger than before.
[14:31.520 --> 14:33.640]  I am not starting a new party.
[14:33.640 --> 14:34.640]  Yes.
[14:34.640 --> 14:37.160]  That was fake news.
[14:37.160 --> 14:38.160]  Fake news.
[14:38.160 --> 14:39.160]  No.
[14:39.160 --> 14:40.160]  Wouldn't that be brilliant?
[14:40.160 --> 14:44.360]  Let's start a new party and let's divide our vote so that you can never win.
[14:44.360 --> 14:46.160]  No, we're not interested in that.
[14:46.160 --> 14:53.200]  We have tremendous, Mr. McLaughlin just gave me numbers that nobody's ever heard of before.
[14:53.200 --> 14:54.960]  More popular than anybody.
[14:54.960 --> 14:55.960]  That's all of us.
[14:55.960 --> 14:56.960]  That's all of us.
[14:56.960 --> 14:57.960]  Yeah, hit pause.
[14:57.960 --> 14:59.560]  We're going to come back with this because here's the key.
[14:59.560 --> 15:05.280]  Just like you saw with Green in Georgia and other people winning with 75 points, 71 points,
[15:05.280 --> 15:11.240]  69 points, 70 points, all the super hardcore Trump candidates were winning in districts
[15:11.240 --> 15:18.560]  that had been about 50, 50 before by huge 20 point extra margins never before seen.
[15:18.560 --> 15:22.560]  So they're in deep trouble.
[15:22.560 --> 15:27.120]  And I've got some other really good news for you coming up all over international news.
[15:27.120 --> 15:32.040]  We're calling the Great Reset and the UN a criminal world anti-human extermination
[15:32.040 --> 15:33.040]  operation.
[15:33.040 --> 15:37.360]  Mainstream news is calling it a global takeover extermination operation.
[15:37.360 --> 15:41.840]  I mean, people are getting the full horror and so we can beat it.
[15:41.840 --> 15:45.000]  So info war is becoming more mainstream than ever, folks.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.720]  That's why they want to show everybody down because we have the truth and you guys are
[15:47.720 --> 15:48.960]  incredible keeping us on air.
[15:48.960 --> 15:52.320]  But we're literally writing the talking points for the global resistance.
[15:52.320 --> 15:53.560]  This operation is.
[15:53.560 --> 15:54.840]  So thank you for your prayers.
[15:54.840 --> 15:57.160]  We're doing it all together.
[15:57.160 --> 16:00.200]  Stay with us.
[16:00.200 --> 16:05.920]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy,
[16:05.920 --> 16:08.080]  food and medicine.
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.840]  And with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered to bring in federal
[16:12.840 --> 16:19.360]  and globalist control, we have seen massive lines of people lined up at the few grocery
[16:19.360 --> 16:24.280]  stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned away after hours
[16:24.280 --> 16:25.720]  of freezing in the cold.
[16:25.720 --> 16:29.680]  We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power
[16:29.680 --> 16:31.680]  in their house and then running out of gas.
[16:31.680 --> 16:36.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king and food is the energy our bodies run off of and water
[16:36.480 --> 16:37.480]  as well.
[16:37.480 --> 16:40.320]  They're both available, the highest quality water filtration and the highest quality
[16:40.320 --> 16:45.840]  storeable foods right now, massively discounted because of this emergency for everybody nationwide

[16:51.720 --> 16:55.000]  food in all packages at infowarstore.com.
[16:55.000 --> 16:57.920]  That's infowarstore.com or preparewithalix.com.
[16:57.920 --> 16:59.920]  Big discounts probably a few more days.
[16:59.920 --> 17:14.920]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[17:14.920 --> 17:28.960]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[17:28.960 --> 17:37.640]  The great awakening is here, go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[17:37.640 --> 17:55.080]  The information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[17:55.080 --> 18:04.320]  Infowars.com Finally, vitamin D3 and vitamin K that are both essential are getting the
[18:04.320 --> 18:06.800]  respect and the attention they deserve.
[18:06.800 --> 18:10.160]  We've got a great product, it's been out for six years, winter sun.
[18:10.160 --> 18:14.120]  Long before the big crisis came along, we were there saying, this is high quality, this
[18:14.120 --> 18:16.600]  will make you healthy, this will be better for you and your family.
[18:16.600 --> 18:21.360]  But what else doesn't get attention and needs to be looked at is vitamin B12.
[18:21.360 --> 18:26.160]  It is just as essential, it is just as important and it is amazing and it's not just about
[18:26.160 --> 18:29.680]  your immune system, it's about every part of your body.
[18:29.680 --> 18:34.600]  It's really a hormone and it's what your building blocks of your entire body operate
[18:34.600 --> 18:35.600]  off of.
[18:35.600 --> 18:41.080]  So these vitamins are essential, vitamin D3 and of course vitamin B12 go together like
[18:41.080 --> 18:43.360]  a horse and carriage, do your own research.
[18:43.360 --> 18:46.920]  We've got the highest grades they are going to find out there and they are taking it under
[18:46.920 --> 18:47.920]  the tongue.
[18:47.920 --> 18:52.040]  It's key to put it under the tongue for about a minute and let it sit so your blood vessels
[18:52.040 --> 18:53.040]  absorb it.
[18:53.040 --> 18:59.400]  They are both available 50% off at infowarstore.com together or by themselves at 50% off at 25%
[18:59.400 --> 19:00.400]  off.
[19:00.400 --> 19:06.880]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee, I just love it, I can't get enough
[19:06.880 --> 19:07.880]  of it.
[19:07.880 --> 19:12.920]  We've got a fresh brew right now, that's what fills my mug, that's what fills my belly,
[19:12.920 --> 19:14.600]  that's what fills my soul.
[19:14.600 --> 19:20.560]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee, folks we have had this coffee for years at infowarstore.com,
[19:20.560 --> 19:23.120]  years, never raised the price, never.
[19:23.120 --> 19:27.560]  The Wake Up America blend, the best coffee, the crew here loves it, we drink it every
[19:27.560 --> 19:32.920]  day and of course that's just one of the great ways you can support info wars here.
[19:32.920 --> 19:37.400]  Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody, why not support info wars and keep the coffee
[19:37.400 --> 19:40.560]  supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend.
[19:40.560 --> 19:44.560]  Of course read all the great reviews, pretty much perfect review there, 4.9 star, when
[19:44.560 --> 19:48.840]  you have thousands of reviews it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally
[19:48.840 --> 19:50.200]  everybody gets a 5 star.
[19:50.200 --> 19:53.560]  So I mean if you have 4.9 that's pretty much everybody gives it a 5 star except maybe one
[19:53.560 --> 19:54.560]  or two people.
[19:54.560 --> 20:03.560]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee only available at infowarsstore.com.
[20:03.560 --> 20:17.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:17.760 --> 20:24.240]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[20:24.240 --> 20:29.240]  Make no mistake, President Trump won the election in a landslide, the evidence is overwhelming
[20:29.240 --> 20:33.640]  and make no mistake he went to bat for America and the one-sided deals with the globalist
[20:33.640 --> 20:39.120]  ship all of our jobs to communist China in the last 30 years and he reversed it overnight,
[20:39.120 --> 20:44.600]  he cut drug prices by two-thirds on average and now it's all been reversed and they're
[20:44.600 --> 20:48.880]  shutting down power plants again and the stock market's starting to go down and the dollars
[20:48.880 --> 20:55.640]  starting to fail and the CFR is in every publication they put out saying America's over, America's
[20:55.640 --> 21:00.360]  done, don't invest here and that represents the ruling class of republicans and democratic
[21:00.360 --> 21:07.880]  party and we have a major inroad, we have a giant beachhead in the populist Trump movement
[21:07.880 --> 21:11.840]  that info wars in you and others built, the liberty movement that was already dormant
[21:11.840 --> 21:17.880]  in this country that's existed since 1776 and so Trump rode in on that wave, he made
[21:17.880 --> 21:21.680]  mistakes, he was surrounded by swamp but they hated his ass because of his rhetoric and
[21:21.680 --> 21:27.720]  his actions on trade and they are now trying to totally suppress him because they want
[21:27.720 --> 21:32.800]  to suppress you, they are so scared but it's not suppressed, he's well into his speech
[21:32.800 --> 21:38.480]  now, we're just following along behind playing excerpts and the full speech is again live
[21:38.480 --> 21:44.840]  at info wars.com and news wars.com, remember the system does not want you to hear this,
[21:44.840 --> 21:49.520]  they're fighting to stop it so you are the amplifiers, you are the people to carry the
[21:49.520 --> 21:54.200]  ball down the field, share the live links now for man.video, info wars.com and tell
[21:54.200 --> 21:58.160]  folks about those local stations you're listening to, it is beyond critical, if you don't do
[21:58.160 --> 22:02.800]  it, we'll lose, if you do it, we'll win, you've been doing it, we're starting to win globally,
[22:02.800 --> 22:08.560]  I'll cover that next hour but let's go right now, let's go back to the president.
[22:08.560 --> 22:12.000]  Those are great numbers and I want to thank you very much, those are incredible numbers,
[22:12.000 --> 22:19.640]  I came here and he was giving me 95 percent, 97 percent, 92 percent, I said they're great
[22:19.640 --> 22:23.240]  and I want to thank everybody in this room and everybody else, yeah it's 90 plus percent
[22:23.240 --> 22:29.120]  of republicans say he's the leader, from McConnell and Pence have to put their hat in their dirty
[22:29.120 --> 22:34.640]  hands now, we will be united and strong like never before, to the capital made Trump stronger
[22:34.640 --> 22:40.720]  when they tried to frame him, we will fight the onslaught of radicalism, socialism and
[22:40.720 --> 22:46.120]  indeed it all leads to communism once and for all, that's what it leads to, you'll be
[22:46.120 --> 22:50.360]  hearing more and more about that as we go along but that's what it leads to, you know
[22:50.360 --> 22:58.160]  that, we all knew that the Biden administration was going to be bad but none of us even imagined
[22:58.160 --> 23:04.000]  just how bad they would be and how far left they would go, he never talked about this,
[23:04.000 --> 23:07.560]  we would have those wonderful debates, he would never talk about this, we didn't know
[23:07.560 --> 23:18.000]  what the hell he was talking about actually, his campaign was all lies, talked about energy
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.880]  I thought I said you know this guy actually he's okay with energy, he wasn't okay with
[23:21.880 --> 23:26.720]  energy, wants to put you all out of business, he's not okay with energy, he wants windmills,
[23:26.720 --> 23:33.720]  the windmills, the windmills that don't work when you need them, Joe Biden has had the
[23:33.720 --> 23:39.400]  most disastrous first month of any president in modern history, that's true, I don't
[23:39.400 --> 23:45.280]  think ever but he came at all, already the Biden administration has proven that they
[23:45.280 --> 23:54.040]  are anti-jobs, anti-family, anti-borders, anti-energy, anti-women and anti-science,
[23:54.040 --> 23:59.520]  that's right they say men can compete women's sports and go in your daughter's bathroom,
[23:59.520 --> 24:07.520]  in just one short month we have gone from America first to America last, you think about
[24:07.520 --> 24:13.120]  it right, America last, oh yeah, there's no better example than the new and horrible
[24:13.120 --> 24:19.000]  crisis on our southern border, we did such a good job, it was all worth, actually Biden
[24:19.000 --> 24:27.080]  went, told the GX7 that we suck, actually said no more America first, six weeks ago
[24:27.080 --> 24:38.080]  we had created the most secure border in U.S. history, we had built almost 500 miles of
[24:38.080 --> 24:44.000]  great border wall that helped us with these numbers because once it's up, you know they
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.000]  used to say a wall doesn't work, well you know what I've always said, walls and wheels,
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.640]  those are two things that will never change, the wall has been amazing, yeah why'd they
[24:53.640 --> 24:57.160]  put a wall up around the capital, sections of it to complete, they don't want to complete
[24:57.160 --> 25:01.360]  it, they don't want to complete little sections in certain little areas, they don't want to
[25:01.360 --> 25:07.600]  complete but it's had an impact that nobody would have even believed, it's amazing considering
[25:07.600 --> 25:12.720]  that the Democrats number one priority was to make sure that the wall would never ever
[25:12.720 --> 25:17.840]  get built, would never ever happen, would never get financed, we got it financed, we
[25:17.840 --> 25:25.960]  ended catch and release, ended asylum fraud and brought illegal crossings to historic
[25:25.960 --> 25:33.480]  lows, when illegal aliens trespass across our borders they were promptly caught, detained
[25:33.480 --> 25:34.480]  and-
[25:34.480 --> 25:38.160]  Don't you love almost no one's wearing masks in the CPAC event, even though they've been
[25:38.160 --> 25:44.840]  haranguing them too, isn't that great, these are good people, these are the smart people,
[25:44.840 --> 25:52.280]  in only a few weeks to turn this unprecedented accomplishment into a self-inflicted humanitarian
[25:52.280 --> 26:00.200]  and national security disaster, by recklessly eliminating our border, security measures,
[26:00.200 --> 26:06.560]  controls, all of the things that we put into place, Joe Biden has triggered a massive flood
[26:06.560 --> 26:11.840]  of illegal immigration into our country, the likes of which we have never seen before,
[26:11.840 --> 26:18.480]  they're coming up by the tens of thousands, they're all coming to take advantage of the
[26:18.480 --> 26:26.760]  things that he said that's luring everybody to come to America, and we're one country,
[26:26.760 --> 26:32.080]  we can't afford the problems of the world as much as we'd love to, we'd love to help
[26:32.080 --> 26:33.320]  but we can't do that-
[26:33.320 --> 26:35.920]  Sure as hell can't do it with Biden cutting electricity off-
[26:35.920 --> 26:44.240]  Perhaps worst of all, Joe Biden's decision to cancel border security has single-handedly
[26:44.240 --> 26:52.120]  launched a youth migrant crisis that is enriching child smugglers, vicious criminal cartels,
[26:52.120 --> 26:57.720]  and some of the most evil people on the planet, you see it every day, just turn on the news,
[26:57.720 --> 27:03.680]  you'll see it every day, under my administration we stop the child smugglers, we dismantle
[27:03.680 --> 27:09.800]  the criminal cartels, we greatly limited drug and human trafficking to a level that nobody
[27:09.800 --> 27:15.280]  actually thought was possible, and the wall helped us a lot, and we protected vulnerable
[27:15.280 --> 27:23.240]  people from the ravages of dangerous predators, and that's what they are, dangerous, dangerous
[27:23.240 --> 27:30.400]  predators, but the Biden administration has put the vile coyotes back in business, and
[27:30.400 --> 27:37.640]  it has done so in a very, very big way, under the new administration, catch and release
[27:37.640 --> 27:40.480]  has been restored, can you imagine?
[27:40.480 --> 27:45.720]  We work so hard, catch, you know what that is, you catch them, you take their name, they
[27:45.720 --> 27:51.720]  may be killers, they may be rapists, they may be drug smugglers, you take their name and
[27:51.720 --> 27:57.400]  you release them into our country, we did the opposite, we not only didn't release them,
[27:57.400 --> 28:03.680]  they had them brought back to their country, illegal immigrants are now being apprehended
[28:03.680 --> 28:10.400]  and released along the entire southern border, it's worse than that, they're running ads,
[28:10.400 --> 28:14.840]  Biden is in Latin America saying if you were a criminal, deported, come back, they are
[28:14.840 --> 28:19.480]  coming at levels that you haven't even seen yet, by the hundreds of thousands, by the
[28:19.480 --> 28:26.000]  millions they'll be coming, the Biden administration is now actively expediting, I was going to
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.080]  come back where he left off, and just think about this folks, the speech is ongoing, we're
[28:30.080 --> 28:35.000]  behind it so we can go to our breaks, we can make commentary, think about what a cool drink
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.480]  of water this is in the desert after a month and a week of Biden, I mean it's just night
[28:38.480 --> 28:43.840]  and day, isn't it, I mean, wow, Trump got in, America was open for business, now the
[28:43.840 --> 28:47.320]  globalists are here, they're like no, you don't get to have a country, you're done,
[28:47.320 --> 28:51.360]  great reset, we're going to bankrupt you by design, but finally other world leaders and
[28:51.360 --> 29:00.320]  others are figuring this out, I've got incredible news next hour on that front, stay with us.
[29:00.320 --> 29:07.280]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[29:07.280 --> 29:14.640]  that this is all a test, this experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning, it's
[29:14.640 --> 29:20.040]  God giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension, so we can decide where
[29:20.040 --> 29:24.160]  we want to spend eternity, and what level we want to go to, and it really does come
[29:24.160 --> 29:28.760]  down to that, so as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good
[29:28.760 --> 29:33.600]  in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness, God is
[29:33.600 --> 29:39.920]  the author of us having our own will, God is the author of us having free will, and
[29:39.920 --> 29:44.920]  that free will is a beautiful thing, and when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood
[29:44.920 --> 29:50.640]  and this whole evil culture in Washington D.C., and Fauci, and the mass cult, it's all
[29:50.640 --> 29:54.360]  about dominating your free will, it's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly,
[29:54.360 --> 29:58.680]  you're in bed, because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator
[29:58.680 --> 30:00.720]  of the universe.
[30:00.720 --> 30:09.080]  The need for storable foods are increasingly apparent, with millions left without power,
[30:09.080 --> 30:16.120]  including most grocery stores, many Texas residents are left without food.
[30:16.120 --> 30:21.320]  The lines of the grocery stores are getting longer and longer, while most of the store
[30:21.320 --> 30:24.360]  shelves are left bare.
[30:24.360 --> 30:31.840]  Now we know that in the most historic record freezing temperatures in over a century, your
[30:31.840 --> 30:39.400]  government can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water.
[30:39.400 --> 30:44.640]  Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family.
[30:44.640 --> 30:51.240]  Go to infowarstore.com and get at least a year supply of storable foods to make sure
[30:51.240 --> 30:55.680]  you and your family are prepared for the unimaginable.
[30:55.680 --> 31:00.800]  Get your storable foods at infowarstore.com.
[31:00.800 --> 31:05.560]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment.
[31:05.560 --> 31:10.520]  Cell phones are an amazing tool, really they're a super computer that's handheld, but big tech,
[31:10.520 --> 31:15.200]  large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHIComs especially,
[31:15.200 --> 31:20.800]  are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when
[31:20.800 --> 31:25.440]  they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record
[31:25.440 --> 31:27.680]  what's going to happen in mass movements.
[31:27.680 --> 31:34.800]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover, in their own
[31:34.800 --> 31:35.800]  words they admit it.
[31:35.800 --> 31:40.840]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket-pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[31:40.840 --> 31:44.320]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're faraday cages, they just look like
[31:44.320 --> 31:49.240]  a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great, and it just gives you that security to have
[31:49.240 --> 31:54.320]  power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big
[31:54.320 --> 31:58.680]  brother to know what you're up to because it's not their business, get yours at infowarstored.com

[33:03.520 --> 33:21.800]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.800 --> 33:29.280]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[33:29.280 --> 33:38.520]  In 1955, the United States had roughly 56% of world wealth and close to about 80% of
[33:38.520 --> 33:41.640]  all scientific development, look it up.
[33:41.640 --> 33:45.880]  Now we weren't stealing the wealth from the third world, we were producing industries
[33:45.880 --> 33:55.840]  and producing scientific procedures and formulas that were creating new economies everywhere.
[33:55.840 --> 34:00.720]  But by the 70s and 80s, the globalists came in and decided to shut down the U.S. economy
[34:00.720 --> 34:06.280]  to make deals with the Arabs to only buy oil from them and to begin deindustrialization
[34:06.280 --> 34:08.360]  in the United States.
[34:08.360 --> 34:13.920]  And it never really got reversed, Reagan tried a little bit, George Herbert Walker accelerated
[34:13.920 --> 34:18.520]  it, Mr. New World Order speech, Bill Clinton made it even worse, sold us out to the Chinese,
[34:18.520 --> 34:24.480]  that's when the real collapse of our industry to China and our weapons systems and computer
[34:24.480 --> 34:28.160]  ships went there, along with every other technology we had.
[34:28.160 --> 34:33.080]  And the transfer was done on purpose by the globalists because there they'd have a monolithic
[34:33.080 --> 34:37.520]  dictatorship to deal with and the commonest Chinese that didn't even have running water
[34:37.520 --> 34:44.160]  in most of their country or electricity were pleased as pie.
[34:44.160 --> 34:49.800]  The decades later along came the Liberty Movement, along came M4s, along came the Great Awakening
[34:49.800 --> 34:55.800]  and the system tried to co-opt it with their Q systems and the rest of it, but they failed.
[34:55.800 --> 34:57.400]  But they were able to steal the election.
[34:57.400 --> 34:59.000]  It doesn't mean they're popular.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.120]  It doesn't mean they're going to win as long as you understand who they are and speak out
[35:02.120 --> 35:03.120]  against them.
[35:03.120 --> 35:09.480]  Let's go back to Trump's ongoing historic speech at CPAC.
[35:09.480 --> 35:17.800]  The Biden administration is now actively expediting the admission of illegal migrants,
[35:17.800 --> 35:24.880]  enabling them to lodge frivolous asylum flames and admitting them by the thousands and thousands
[35:24.880 --> 35:31.360]  and thousands a day crowded together in unsanitary conditions, despite the ongoing economic and
[35:31.360 --> 35:39.320]  public health crisis, COVID-19 or as I call it, the China virus.
[35:39.320 --> 35:44.520]  There's no masks.
[35:44.520 --> 35:45.520]  There's no double masks.
[35:45.520 --> 35:49.160]  That was a new one that came out two weeks ago.
[35:49.160 --> 35:54.440]  First, Fauci said, you don't need masks, no masks, no good, no, no, then all of a sudden
[35:54.440 --> 35:55.440]  he wanted me.
[35:55.440 --> 35:57.280]  Now he wants double masks.
[35:57.280 --> 36:03.600]  No social distancing, no nothing, no nothing.
[36:03.600 --> 36:09.800]  They're together and it's sad, actually, and it's sad for them and it's sad for our country.
[36:09.800 --> 36:14.920]  What the Biden administration is doing to push young migrants into the hands of human
[36:14.920 --> 36:19.800]  traffickers and coyotes is dangerous, immoral, and indefensible.
[36:19.800 --> 36:21.880]  Hard to believe it's happening.
[36:21.880 --> 36:32.200]  Biden has failed in his number one duty as chief executive enforcing America's laws.
[36:32.200 --> 36:38.720]  This alone should be reason enough for Democrats to suffer withering losses in the midterms
[36:38.720 --> 36:50.080]  and to lose the White House decisively four years from now.
[36:50.080 --> 37:08.400]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're watching coverage of President Trump's ongoing live
[37:08.400 --> 37:09.400]  speech.
[37:09.400 --> 37:14.400]  We're about 20 minutes behind because we are going through the live shows.
[37:14.400 --> 37:19.240]  Actually, as you know, they just lost the White House, but it's one of those things.
[37:19.240 --> 37:21.520]  But who knows?
[37:21.520 --> 37:22.920]  Who knows?
[37:22.920 --> 37:27.800]  I may even decide to beat them for a third time, okay?
[37:27.800 --> 37:28.800]  Yeah!
[37:28.800 --> 37:29.800]  Yeah!
[37:29.800 --> 37:36.200]  He just came out and said it was a fraud again, football spike, bitches, boom.
[37:36.200 --> 37:39.200]  It paused.
[37:39.200 --> 37:42.280]  This is key because, again, he started 10 minutes early.
[37:42.280 --> 37:44.880]  Trump never starts early as he starts five, 10 minutes late.
[37:44.880 --> 37:47.400]  So we were going to show them, we started four, five Eastern, right.
[37:47.400 --> 37:50.320]  We were going to carry it, but we're pausing it as we go.
[37:50.320 --> 37:53.920]  Again, his speech is ongoing way towards the end right now, but we're going to play
[37:53.920 --> 37:54.920]  most of it here today.
[37:54.920 --> 37:55.960]  And of course, a lot of it tomorrow.
[37:55.960 --> 38:01.120]  But I'm seeing this in live time right now, and I was saying to the crew earlier, he needs
[38:01.120 --> 38:04.880]  to come out and say the election was fraudulent because they were going to do a 25th amendment.
[38:04.880 --> 38:06.520]  They were going to do the impeachment.
[38:06.520 --> 38:11.320]  They probably actually had the votes to convict him, and McConnell told him, you better shut
[38:11.320 --> 38:14.000]  up and say you lost, or we're going to do this to you.
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.560]  But now they have no leverage over him, so he needs to double back and just expose it
[38:17.560 --> 38:18.560]  all.
[38:18.560 --> 38:19.560]  And so he's doing it.
[38:19.560 --> 38:22.520]  He beat him once, he beat him twice, so beat him three times.
[38:22.520 --> 38:23.520]  This is awesome.
[38:23.520 --> 38:24.520]  Let's continue.
[38:24.520 --> 38:38.160]  I love it, whoo, now you're talking.
[38:38.160 --> 38:45.240]  Joe Biden defunded the border wall and stopped all future construction, even on small open
[38:45.240 --> 38:51.320]  sections that just needed to be finished up, routine little work, it's already been bought.
[38:51.320 --> 38:56.080]  Later the contractors get to him and they say, no, it costs us much more money not to
[38:56.080 --> 38:58.240]  finish this wall section than if we finished it.
[38:58.240 --> 38:59.240]  That's going to be nice.
[38:59.240 --> 39:02.360]  Where do you see those bills start pouring in?
[39:02.360 --> 39:06.920]  He revoked the executive order cracking down on deadly sanctuary cities.
[39:06.920 --> 39:13.280]  He has effectively ordered a shutdown of ICE, halting virtually all deportations.
[39:13.280 --> 39:15.680]  Everyone murders everybody, no more.
[39:15.680 --> 39:17.760]  Let's not deport people.
[39:17.760 --> 39:21.920]  When restricting our law enforcement professionals, and they are great professionals, you have
[39:21.920 --> 39:28.120]  many of them represented here today, from conducting almost any immigration enforcement
[39:28.120 --> 39:30.280]  of any kind.
[39:30.280 --> 39:35.360]  The Biden policy of releasing criminals into the U.S. Interior is making America into a
[39:35.360 --> 39:41.680]  sanctuary nation where criminals, illegal immigrants, including gang members and sex
[39:41.680 --> 39:44.800]  offenders are set free into American communities.
[39:44.800 --> 39:52.040]  They have no idea who's coming up, and remember with the caravans, these countries, not only
[39:52.040 --> 39:57.040]  the three of them, but many, many countries all over the world, they're not giving us
[39:57.040 --> 40:03.280]  their best and their finest, because they're intelligent, they're not giving us their best
[40:03.280 --> 40:04.280]  and their finest.
[40:04.280 --> 40:05.680]  Remember I said that.
[40:05.680 --> 40:11.880]  I said that a long time ago when I made the first remarks, when I came down the escalator
[40:11.880 --> 40:22.880]  with our great future first lady, who says hello, who loves you as much as I love you,
[40:22.880 --> 40:30.920]  but I said that a long time ago, and we turned out to be 100 percent correct, Biden's radical
[40:30.920 --> 40:34.640]  immigration policies aren't just illegal.
[40:34.640 --> 40:39.320]  They're immoral, they're heartless, and they are a betrayal of our nation's core values.
[40:39.320 --> 40:43.480]  It's a terrible thing this happened.
[40:43.480 --> 40:49.600]  The Republican Party must hold Joe Biden and the Democrats accountable.
[40:49.600 --> 40:55.280]  They ripped up the diplomatic agreements we negotiated with Honduras, Guatemala, and El
[40:55.280 --> 40:59.560]  Salvador to shut down illegal immigration.
[40:59.560 --> 41:04.800]  You know, they got a fortune, they got paid $500 million a year.
[41:04.800 --> 41:10.280]  When I came into office, those countries were refusing to take back illegal alien gang
[41:10.280 --> 41:15.320]  members, including MS-13, the most vicious, probably of them all.
[41:15.320 --> 41:20.480]  No matter where you go in the world, MS-13, they do things that even the worst don't think
[41:20.480 --> 41:22.040]  about.
[41:22.040 --> 41:26.120]  So I asked, how much do we pay these countries?
[41:26.120 --> 41:28.040]  How much do we pay them?
[41:28.040 --> 41:34.960]  Sure, we pay them approximately $500 million a year, it's a lot of money.
[41:34.960 --> 41:39.320]  I mean, it's peanuts compared to the way other countries rip us off, but that's a lot of
[41:39.320 --> 41:40.320]  money.
[41:40.320 --> 41:41.320]  I said, okay.
[41:41.320 --> 41:44.240]  All right, we're going to come back in the next long segment and play more Trump speak,
[41:44.240 --> 41:50.680]  but this is just a month ago, Guatemala, the Mexican police ordered to stop these groups
[41:50.680 --> 41:54.320]  we're unable to, but they stopped them about 10 miles in, but then there were by then so
[41:54.320 --> 41:55.920]  many tens of thousands more, they couldn't.
[41:55.920 --> 42:00.760]  Mexico finally got on board with this because they noticed, and Trump met with a new Mexican
[42:00.760 --> 42:06.040]  president a few years ago, that even Cancun and these places that were safe zones in
[42:06.040 --> 42:10.840]  Mexico are not safe now because Guatemala and Nicaragua and all those other places have
[42:10.840 --> 42:16.240]  such serious gangs that they're coming in and just shooting and killing the Mexican police,
[42:16.240 --> 42:19.800]  the military, they can't even deal with it because the gangs are far worse in Central
[42:19.800 --> 42:20.800]  America than they are in Mexico.
[42:20.800 --> 42:25.200]  As bad as you think Mexico is, it's one of the richest countries in Latin America.
[42:25.200 --> 42:28.960]  In fact, for third world countries, Mexico is at the very top.
[42:28.960 --> 42:30.400]  It's almost on a third world country.
[42:30.400 --> 42:32.960]  It's got more rich people per capita than the US, by the way.
[42:32.960 --> 42:36.400]  Oh yeah, just they got an elite that give people money, then let them have a middle
[42:36.400 --> 42:38.760]  class job like Trump wants to do.
[42:38.760 --> 42:41.600]  So that's why Trump hit it off the New Mexican president who's trying to do those reforms.
[42:41.600 --> 42:45.000]  We're going to come back and play more of this on the other side, but wow, don't you
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.600]  miss Trump now?
[42:46.600 --> 42:49.480]  Five weeks after he left, Biden doesn't know what planet he's on.
[42:49.480 --> 42:50.480]  I'm Alex Jones.
[42:50.480 --> 42:51.480]  This is the info war.
[42:51.480 --> 43:00.040]  Tomorrow's news today, infowars.com, spread that link.
[43:00.040 --> 43:03.160]  I sell supplements for two reasons.
[43:03.160 --> 43:08.520]  Because they work, they're real, they're powerful, and because it's a giant market.
[43:08.520 --> 43:11.160]  But again, why is there a giant market?
[43:11.160 --> 43:12.660]  Because it works.
[43:12.660 --> 43:14.600]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[43:14.600 --> 43:22.840]  So whether it's sawpaw, meadow, and other key ingredients in our prostate formula, prostaguard,
[43:22.840 --> 43:28.040]  or whether it is the super high grade, organic bottom of the B12 and ultra 12, or whether
[43:28.040 --> 43:35.200]  it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA force, or the pure deep breath crystal iodine in X2,
[43:35.200 --> 43:41.520]  these are all the very best supplements you're going to find in an already great market of
[43:41.520 --> 43:44.920]  high quality products out there, and it funds the info war.
[43:44.920 --> 43:48.360]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're fun of the info wars,
[43:48.360 --> 43:49.360]  you can't lose.
[43:49.360 --> 43:51.880]  Info wars delivers in spades.

[43:54.560 --> 43:59.680]  Again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at infowarstore.com.

[44:15.960 --> 44:17.640]  from them years ago.

[44:22.760 --> 44:25.600]  get an additional 10% off because of the emergency.
[44:25.600 --> 44:28.880]  They weren't going to do sales for a long time, but because of the emergency, they have
[44:28.880 --> 44:34.640]  now said they're doing 10% off exclusively at preparewithalex.com or infowarstore.com.

[44:40.760 --> 44:42.680]  month, six month year, and more.
[44:42.680 --> 44:44.960]  They have hundreds and hundreds of different foods and varieties.

[44:49.040 --> 44:50.040]  the infowar.
[44:50.040 --> 44:53.080]  Preparewithalex.com, limited time, 10% off.
[44:53.080 --> 44:57.560]  Preparewithalex.com, 10% off right now, get prepared, get ready, and don't be dependent
[44:57.560 --> 45:01.560]  on the globalist.
[45:01.560 --> 45:06.560]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel
[45:06.560 --> 45:11.200]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[45:11.200 --> 45:16.040]  made the image of God, and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free
[45:16.040 --> 45:17.040]  will.
[45:17.040 --> 45:23.040]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[45:23.040 --> 45:27.760]  an entire system, and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact you're
[45:27.760 --> 45:32.280]  able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty
[45:32.280 --> 45:36.600]  of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[45:36.600 --> 45:37.600]  of music.
[45:37.600 --> 45:41.920]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic, and that
[45:41.920 --> 45:45.200]  itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[45:45.200 --> 45:49.880]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of
[45:49.880 --> 45:55.840]  the system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God, and appreciate your consciousness,
[45:55.840 --> 46:00.200]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[46:00.200 --> 46:06.800]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government, but world government
[46:06.800 --> 46:09.200]  is only the control grid.
[46:09.200 --> 46:15.160]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods
[46:15.160 --> 46:20.720]  and attain immortality, but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination
[46:20.720 --> 46:23.840]  of all carbon-based line forms.
[46:23.840 --> 46:25.920]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[46:25.920 --> 46:29.680]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[46:29.680 --> 46:31.560]  They are playing God.
[46:31.560 --> 46:38.320]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[46:38.320 --> 46:41.320]  to carry out this transformation.
[46:41.320 --> 46:45.680]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on
[46:45.680 --> 46:46.760]  record.
[46:46.760 --> 46:49.160]  You have been warned.
[46:49.160 --> 46:53.680]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.320]  This is the end of all life on earth as we know it.
[46:57.320 --> 47:02.840]  This is the alien takeover of earth.
[47:02.840 --> 47:26.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:26.320 --> 47:28.000]  Well, huge take away so far.
[47:28.000 --> 47:34.000]  Welcome back to the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones show, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[47:34.000 --> 47:40.120]  Owen Schroyer is coming in with Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m.
[47:40.120 --> 47:41.880]  And that show has half as many commercials.
[47:41.880 --> 47:43.800]  We only run the local commercials for stations.
[47:43.800 --> 47:45.400]  We get rid of the network commercials.
[47:45.400 --> 47:50.040]  I have too many partnerships with other networks to get rid of our commercials here, but that
[47:50.040 --> 47:52.120]  is in the works.
[47:52.120 --> 47:56.360]  But he will be airing obviously large excerpts of the speech as well, but still ongoing.
[47:56.360 --> 47:58.360]  The president is still speaking.
[47:58.360 --> 48:02.760]  Israel began bombing Syria right when his speech began.
[48:02.760 --> 48:08.600]  So we'll be talking more about that coming up as we learn more in the next hour.
[48:08.600 --> 48:11.720]  But out with the peace president, in with the war president, and I'm sure that makes
[48:11.720 --> 48:18.160]  the left really happy because you know they love everything destructive.
[48:18.160 --> 48:22.640]  The big take away so far is him saying, maybe I'll run and win a third time.
[48:22.640 --> 48:26.240]  So he's saying he's thinking about running again in three and a half years.
[48:26.240 --> 48:30.280]  Really the election will start in about two, the way things start so early now.
[48:30.280 --> 48:32.640]  And he said I won the last election.
[48:32.640 --> 48:34.800]  So that is two big victories right there.
[48:34.800 --> 48:36.600]  He's saying, boy, don't you miss me?
[48:36.600 --> 48:37.960]  You've seen how bad Joe Biden is.
[48:37.960 --> 48:40.160]  He's saying worse than I thought.
[48:40.160 --> 48:43.520]  When Trump went ahead and stood down because they were threatening 25th Amendment on him,
[48:43.520 --> 48:47.560]  he said, I hope Biden won't dismantle what we did because you know it's good, but he's
[48:47.560 --> 48:49.280]  a Chinese communist agent.
[48:49.280 --> 48:50.440]  So he had to do it.
[48:50.440 --> 48:55.320]  Well, let's go ahead and go back ongoing to where we left off in the president's historic
[48:55.320 --> 48:59.440]  seatback 2021 speech.
[48:59.440 --> 49:06.200]  I said, OK, we aren't going to pay them anymore because they wouldn't take back the criminals.
[49:06.200 --> 49:10.680]  And this was true with the Obama administration, it was true for many, many years.
[49:10.680 --> 49:11.880]  How about the border?
[49:11.880 --> 49:13.120]  So we'd catch a murder.
[49:13.120 --> 49:18.640]  We'd want to bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, Salvador.
[49:18.640 --> 49:19.640]  They wouldn't take them back.
[49:19.640 --> 49:21.140]  No, we don't want them.
[49:21.140 --> 49:22.140]  We'd fly them in.
[49:22.140 --> 49:23.140]  They wouldn't let the plane land.
[49:23.140 --> 49:24.140]  We'd bus them in.
[49:24.140 --> 49:27.440]  They wouldn't let the buses get anywhere near the border.
[49:27.440 --> 49:30.160]  And I said, we're not going to pay them anymore.
[49:30.160 --> 49:35.320]  So after I said that and I stopped payment, you know, like a term that we use in the world
[49:35.320 --> 49:37.400]  of business, let's stop payment.
[49:37.400 --> 49:40.120]  So we stopped payment.
[49:40.120 --> 49:41.560]  They were delinquent.
[49:41.560 --> 49:43.120]  We stopped payment.
[49:43.120 --> 49:47.800]  And they very quickly came to the table and we made a deal, very quick deal.
[49:47.800 --> 49:48.960]  We still kept the money.
[49:48.960 --> 49:56.960]  We still didn't pay because we made a deal.
[49:56.960 --> 50:03.240]  And when illegal aliens came across our border, they were rapidly deported and lovingly accepted
[50:03.240 --> 50:08.720]  by those countries from where they came.
[50:08.720 --> 50:12.960]  They worked after it, so now they accept the people, and then we ultimately got along very
[50:12.960 --> 50:16.880]  well with those countries, those three countries, and many countries throughout the world because
[50:16.880 --> 50:18.440]  they respected us again.
[50:18.440 --> 50:19.960]  They didn't respect us.
[50:19.960 --> 50:24.360]  They couldn't believe what they were getting away with.
[50:24.360 --> 50:30.880]  But now Joe Biden has wrecked this great deal, wrecked it, and they're already doing what
[50:30.880 --> 50:33.920]  they were doing before and they're taking the money.
[50:33.920 --> 50:37.680]  And that's just a small portion of what's going on.
[50:37.680 --> 50:43.520]  To top it all off, the Biden people are pushing a bill that would grant mass amnesty for millions
[50:43.520 --> 50:48.400]  of illegal aliens while massively expanding chain migration.
[50:48.400 --> 50:53.240]  That's where you come in and everybody comes in, your grandmother, your father, your mother,
[50:53.240 --> 51:01.280]  your brother, your cousins, they come in so easily, so, so crazy, so crazy.
[51:01.280 --> 51:06.440]  It even requires that the U.S. government provide illegal border crossings with taxable
[51:06.440 --> 51:08.320]  funded lawyers, lawyers.
[51:08.320 --> 51:10.280]  Anybody need a good lawyer, you can't have one.
[51:10.280 --> 51:11.280]  They get the lawyers.
[51:11.280 --> 51:12.280]  They get lawyers.
[51:12.280 --> 51:13.840]  They're probably very good, too.
[51:13.840 --> 51:20.960]  The Democrat immigration bill is a globalist, you take a look at the corporatists, big tech
[51:20.960 --> 51:26.920]  attack on hardworking citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed, and Republicans
[51:26.920 --> 51:37.040]  must ensure that it never is allowed to become federal law, which is what they want to do.
[51:37.040 --> 51:38.040]  We must stand tall.
[51:38.040 --> 51:39.040]  And that's key.
[51:39.040 --> 51:43.680]  Biden's doing all this outside of law, ending the borders, not deporting criminals, murderers,
[51:43.680 --> 51:44.680]  rapists.
[51:44.680 --> 51:45.680]  I mean, it's insane.
[51:45.680 --> 51:48.000]  But it's how you collapse a country.
[51:48.000 --> 51:52.600]  I want to say some things here before we start the next hour and we'll play some more excerpts
[51:52.600 --> 51:53.600]  as the speech goes on.
[51:53.600 --> 51:57.520]  And I know Owen's going to have some of those big excerpts and some of the really amazing
[51:57.520 --> 52:03.040]  money shots, as they call them, with Trump really releasing bombshell after bombshell.
[52:03.040 --> 52:05.680]  But I want to hit a couple things first.
[52:05.680 --> 52:10.640]  I've got a whole bunch of articles out of Canada, Australia, the U.K., and one out of
[52:10.640 --> 52:17.920]  Germany, like this big report at infowars.com, that I really hope you'll go and get and I
[52:17.920 --> 52:21.840]  hope we'll share with friends and family and neighbors, because, you know, I've been demonized
[52:21.840 --> 52:26.200]  by the mainstream media in tens of thousands of reports and hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[52:26.200 --> 52:28.200]  of TV attack pieces as well.
[52:28.200 --> 52:31.200]  And so a lot of people say, oh, I can't listen to Alex Jones.
[52:31.200 --> 52:32.200]  I was told he's evil.
[52:32.200 --> 52:33.200]  I was told he was bad.
[52:33.200 --> 52:40.280]  But if you send them British or Australians, you know, who speak English or Canadian newscasters,
[52:40.280 --> 52:45.320]  who lay out quotes and videos of the globalist saying, we want to starve the third world.
[52:45.320 --> 52:47.280]  We want to bring in world government.
[52:47.280 --> 52:49.760]  We want to bring in a world currency.
[52:49.760 --> 52:51.480]  People will really wake up.
[52:51.480 --> 52:55.560]  And that's the reason this is important, is it shows how our analysis of this sounds
[52:55.560 --> 53:02.640]  horrible, because it is horrible, and it's scary to say it's authoritarian and it wants
[53:02.640 --> 53:03.640]  to get rid of the middle class.
[53:03.640 --> 53:07.880]  It wants to bankrupt you so it can make you accept forced inoculations and global digital
[53:07.880 --> 53:14.240]  passports and no fireplaces and no farming and no gas and no electricity.
[53:14.240 --> 53:17.000]  That's the plan to get us down to net zero carbon.
[53:17.000 --> 53:22.160]  It's called a post industrial world that's an agenda 21 made law by the United Nations
[53:22.160 --> 53:24.840]  and Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
[53:24.840 --> 53:27.880]  And George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to it.
[53:27.880 --> 53:33.280]  Congress never ratified it, but the bureaucracy implemented it.
[53:33.280 --> 53:40.080]  Just like you see Joe Biden getting rid of the borders and releasing rapist and arsonist
[53:40.080 --> 53:44.520]  and murderers outside of law.
[53:44.520 --> 53:46.520]  It's the bureaucracy.
[53:46.520 --> 53:49.400]  So Cory Bernardi is an amazing host.
[53:49.400 --> 53:51.680]  They got a bunch of them in Australia.
[53:51.680 --> 53:56.000]  And we're going to play about a six minute clip of him next hour, socialism on a global
[53:56.000 --> 54:02.640]  scale, Sky News host demolishes Davos elites and great reset scheme.
[54:02.640 --> 54:03.880]  And he does it in six minutes.
[54:03.880 --> 54:10.760]  So I hope you go to info wars.com and I hope that you share this for yourself because it's
[54:10.760 --> 54:11.760]  extremely powerful.
[54:11.760 --> 54:15.080]  And it sounds like I said it, but again, he's probably not listening to me.
[54:15.080 --> 54:16.480]  He can read what the globalist said.
[54:16.480 --> 54:17.480]  He quotes them.
[54:17.480 --> 54:20.280]  He says, this is a total threat to you and your family.
[54:20.280 --> 54:24.440]  They want to bankrupt you, put you on a universal income so they can dictate every aspect of
[54:24.440 --> 54:25.440]  your life.
[54:25.440 --> 54:27.480]  And that's what Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates say.
[54:27.480 --> 54:30.920]  They are real James Bond villains.
[54:30.920 --> 54:33.880]  And the sooner people figure that out, the better.
[54:33.880 --> 54:34.880]  Here's the other news.
[54:34.880 --> 54:39.520]  Syrian army says Israel attacks areas around southern Damascus.
[54:39.520 --> 54:43.160]  This might suggest the strikes in an Israeli response to what is believed to be an Iranian
[54:43.160 --> 54:47.880]  attack on Israeli owned ship in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday.
[54:47.880 --> 54:51.680]  So that's all started to heat up there as well.
[54:51.680 --> 54:53.720]  Now I'm going to bring this up.
[54:53.720 --> 54:58.320]  We are again, it's a famous Alex Jones saying, my son always says it as a joke.
[54:58.320 --> 55:01.400]  He wants to start a podcast called I'm not bragging.
[55:01.400 --> 55:02.400]  I'm not bragging.
[55:02.400 --> 55:07.920]  In fact, I'm a target and even say this is dangerous, okay, but the globalists know
[55:07.920 --> 55:12.240]  how authoritative and how influential we are, not just for the general public, but with
[55:12.240 --> 55:15.120]  thought leaders here and across the planet.
[55:15.120 --> 55:16.920]  You can probably imagine who listens to the show.
[55:16.920 --> 55:18.600]  I'm not going to name drop.
[55:18.600 --> 55:21.200]  One of them died just a week and a half ago.
[55:21.200 --> 55:25.480]  He listened every day, okay?
[55:25.480 --> 55:27.840]  So this is not about bragging, it's about understanding.
[55:27.840 --> 55:29.680]  This broadcast is a brain trust.
[55:29.680 --> 55:32.080]  This broadcast does not have corporate sponsorship.
[55:32.080 --> 55:37.360]  This broadcast is hunted and lied about and demonized because we go to the source documents
[55:37.360 --> 55:40.760]  and we're over the target so we're getting the most flat.
[55:40.760 --> 55:47.000]  We've got great products you already need, but there is not any operation out there that
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  is more hardcore.
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.280]  Trump's great and Trump's got a lot of power and he's a populist and we love him, but he
[55:52.280 --> 55:56.920]  isn't as hardcore when it comes to the info and it's Stephen Miller and others that are
[55:56.920 --> 55:59.920]  writing his speeches.
[55:59.920 --> 56:04.280]  Here we develop the talking points and the resistance to the enemy.
[56:04.280 --> 56:06.080]  So we're in a major leadership role.
[56:06.080 --> 56:07.080]  I wear every hat.
[56:07.080 --> 56:08.480]  I'm a populist, rabble rouser.
[56:08.480 --> 56:09.480]  I'm a journalist.
[56:09.480 --> 56:10.480]  I'm a father.
[56:10.480 --> 56:11.480]  I'm a pundit.
[56:11.480 --> 56:12.480]  I'm a comedian.
[56:12.480 --> 56:19.160]  I'm a talk show host, but what I really do is general historical points on how to defeat
[56:19.160 --> 56:24.240]  the New World Order at a technical level to the establishment that's not totally globalist
[56:24.240 --> 56:28.000]  and I convince them that it's a better path for their children and others to not go with
[56:28.000 --> 56:33.160]  a transhumanist movement and I am directly communicating with the higher echelons of
[56:33.160 --> 56:35.480]  every major system, all right?
[56:35.480 --> 56:39.040]  And so by the grace of God, I'm able to do that and by the grace of God, they tune in
[56:39.040 --> 56:43.840]  and that's why all glory goes to God, but we need to stay on air.
[56:43.840 --> 56:48.440]  So as Hunter S. Thompson said, create a God but row away from the rocks or as a better
[56:48.440 --> 56:53.200]  one saying says, trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[56:53.200 --> 56:58.360]  So we have four to five years supply and mega sale, rarely do this, store live free shipping

[57:46.760 --> 57:47.760]  Please support us infowarstore.com.
[57:47.760 --> 57:48.760]  Hour two coming up.
[57:48.760 --> 57:58.960]  In the early 1990s, it was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[57:58.960 --> 58:03.760]  Even before I had asked this TV show in the mid 1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought,
[58:03.760 --> 58:04.760]  that was fun.
[58:04.760 --> 58:09.360]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining
[58:09.360 --> 58:10.360]  because you're real.
[58:10.360 --> 58:12.360]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[58:12.360 --> 58:16.440]  We're not worthy, we're not worthy.
[58:16.440 --> 58:20.320]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because
[58:20.320 --> 58:23.480]  these topics are so huge, they're so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[58:23.480 --> 58:25.640]  I'm trying to get it right and most of the time we do.
[58:25.640 --> 58:31.280]  The globalists love lying to you, they love manipulating you, they enjoy destroying humanity,
[58:31.280 --> 58:36.080]  they enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[58:36.080 --> 58:38.200]  That for me is really such a disgusting.
[58:38.200 --> 58:44.720]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew that we will never join
[58:44.720 --> 58:45.720]  the globalists.
[58:45.720 --> 58:50.480]  We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[58:50.480 --> 58:56.200]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy,
[58:56.200 --> 59:02.360]  food and medicine and with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered
[59:02.360 --> 59:08.320]  to bring in federal and globalist control, we have seen massive lines of people lined
[59:08.320 --> 59:13.360]  up at the few grocery stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned
[59:13.360 --> 59:16.040]  away after hours of freezing in the cold.
[59:16.040 --> 59:20.000]  We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power
[59:20.000 --> 59:21.960]  in their house and then running out of gas.
[59:21.960 --> 59:26.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king and food is the energy our bodies run off of and water
[59:26.760 --> 59:27.760]  as well.
[59:27.760 --> 59:30.640]  They're both available, the highest quality water filtration and the highest quality
[59:30.640 --> 59:36.120]  storeable foods right now massively discounted because of this emergency for everybody nationwide

[59:42.040 --> 59:45.320]  food in all packages at infowarsstore.com.

[59:48.240 --> 1:00:14.480]  We are back live now into hour number two of the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:14.480 --> 1:00:19.080]  Now I don't normally air something even twice in a row in a week, much less three times
[1:00:19.080 --> 1:00:26.360]  in a row, but this report's really, really important and so I'm going to air it at the
[1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:30.840]  very end because it needs to be seen by new viewers and new listeners and that's when
[1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:37.400]  I predicted 10 years ago the lockdowns, the checkpoints using an excuse of a fake bioweapon.
[1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:41.640]  But there have been a lot of requests for fentanyl, the common Chinese dragon, to make
[1:00:41.640 --> 1:00:43.680]  a return.
[1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:47.440]  And so we hadn't done one probably in six months because I get bummed out with the news, but
[1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:49.240]  I've decided to be more happy.
[1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:52.440]  I've decided to have more fun because the globalists want to get our spirits down so
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:53.440]  I'm going to do it.
[1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:56.080]  This is a little racy, a little, a little gross.
[1:00:56.080 --> 1:00:58.000]  My wife thought it was a little much.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:02.960]  I told McGreen who made it with Rob Do to make the, he pulls the anal probe out to have
[1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:06.040]  it be green slime or something and said it's bloody, but I think I'm going to have him
[1:01:06.040 --> 1:01:08.840]  edit it again and just make it green, green dragon slime.
[1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:14.080]  And kids love it, adults love it, but it's also horrifying to show real articles.
[1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:16.600]  Everything the dragon's saying is actually going on.
[1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:19.680]  So if you're a radio listener and hear this, you have to understand with the video at Band
[1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:25.200]  Dot Video, it actually, Paul, he's talking, it shows mainstream articles, everything he's
[1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:26.520]  saying no matter how crazy it is.
[1:01:26.520 --> 1:01:29.280]  So if you weren't laughing, you'd be crying.
[1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:32.400]  So here is fentanyl, the dragon.
[1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:36.880]  It's watch communist China celebrate anal swabbing stupid Americans and then we'll be
[1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:41.320]  right back on the other side with the latest on Trump's amazing epic speech and then the
[1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:42.320]  big news in Australia.
[1:01:42.320 --> 1:01:43.320]  Hello Americans.
[1:01:43.320 --> 1:01:53.320]  As you have heard, we are testing you with Q-Pip with anal swab, you're diplomat, you're
[1:01:53.320 --> 1:02:00.440]  not like it, but by the time it will happen, so now it come to America because you're doing
[1:02:00.440 --> 1:02:09.320]  whatever communist China say, so, oh, let me get it, oh, oh, now, I was keeping it warm
[1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:10.320]  for you.
[1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:20.760]  Now I put it inside your boot, oh, that wasn't so hard, you are learning to be humiliated,
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:26.640]  we own your debt, we own Hollywood, and we steal election from Donald Trump, now we take
[1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:35.320]  your guard, so then over every time you travel, China test will have to see that you do not
[1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:43.880]  have color, does not matter if it's your fake, your media work for us.
[1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:51.560]  It was so easy to penetrate your diplomatic call, and now even your school children will
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:03:00.720]  walk like big ones, once dragon give you anal swab, so easy to bring the so-called superpower
[1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:08.120]  to its knees, thanks to the COVID hugs, remember, do not take vitamin D3, so normal viruses
[1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:13.680]  will kill you, and you will live in fear and never reopen.
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:18.840]  We have shut down your keystone part one, we are now coming for your guns and dissolving
[1:03:18.840 --> 1:03:26.760]  your border, I mean Joe Biden is doing that, he is not a poppin, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1:03:26.760 --> 1:03:31.840]  and also Joe Biden said it's good that we invade Hong Kong, and good that we run death
[1:03:31.840 --> 1:03:41.680]  camp with Apple, for we got good Joe Biden, good, we send you more orders to sign, and
[1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:49.880]  more cover restrictions on your people, so China dominate economy while America permanently
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:58.360]  close, and we work for our friend Mr. Pink's World of the UK.
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:04.320]  Your country is lost, we control almost your entire democratic party and many republicans
[1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:11.960]  too, Diane Feinstein, Eric Schwarzwell, and of course Lutero, Mitch McConnell's wife worked
[1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:20.560]  for us, and so he do what we say, you have no hope now that we control your voting machines,
[1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:35.360]  whatever you do, do not visit infogoers.com or band.video or I'll hurt you, oh no, no,
[1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:44.360]  I don't even know what to say, how did you get in here, I just caught you American, you
[1:04:44.360 --> 1:04:59.160]  didn't say, and do not visit band.video or I have to hurt you, oh no, we'll be back.
[1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:03.360]  Finally vitamin D3 and vitamin K that are both essential are getting the respect and
[1:05:03.360 --> 1:05:07.480]  the attention they deserve, we've got a great product, it's been out for six years, winter
[1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:12.400]  sun, long before the big crisis came along, we were there saying, this is high quality,
[1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:15.840]  this will make you healthy, this will be better for you and your family, but what else doesn't
[1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:21.280]  get attention and needs to be looked at is vitamin B12, it is just as essential, it is
[1:05:21.280 --> 1:05:25.800]  just as important and it is amazing, and it's not just about your immune system, it's about
[1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:31.480]  every part of your body, it's really a hormone and it's what your building blocks of your
[1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:38.360]  entire body operate off of, so these vitamins are essential, vitamin D3 and of course vitamin
[1:05:38.360 --> 1:05:42.760]  B12 go together like a horse and carriage, do your own research, we've got the highest
[1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:46.080]  grades you're going to find out there and they're taken under the tongue, it's key
[1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:50.760]  to put it under the tongue for about a minute and let it sit so your blood vessels absorb

[1:05:57.160 --> 1:06:09.400]  25% off.
[1:06:09.400 --> 1:06:14.680]  We are now into hour number two, thank you for spending some of your Sunday night with
[1:06:14.680 --> 1:06:21.080]  us and remember this is not a spectator sport, this is toe to toe with the globalist and
[1:06:21.080 --> 1:06:24.400]  your word of mouth is paramount spreading the word about the transmission, the articles,
[1:06:24.400 --> 1:06:29.000]  the videos at infoarstore.com and band.video.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:33.880]  Okay, I want to place some more of Trump's speech and coming up on Sunday Live that comes
[1:06:33.880 --> 1:06:37.080]  on at 6, I'll enjoy your host, they're going to have a lot of the ex-serbs, a lot of the
[1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:41.000]  highlights, he's busy watching it, getting those snipped out right now for you, a busy
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:45.880]  beaver, but one of those snippets that Trump talked about about an hour ago, right when
[1:06:45.880 --> 1:06:51.440]  he started his speech, was that he's thinking about running for a third time and winning
[1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:56.080]  a third time, which is now him saying, hey, I really did win the last election, which
[1:06:56.080 --> 1:07:00.680]  is critical and his main mission is going to be exposing the election fraud in Maricopa
[1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:05.400]  County where the big fraud happened in Arizona, they have announced a full audit of all the
[1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:09.080]  votes, legislatures getting the computers and getting all the hard drives, we'll see
[1:07:09.080 --> 1:07:12.640]  if they've been wiped, but they're also going to have the physical ballot, so you're going
[1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:16.920]  to see that first state fall because none of them let anybody do a real audit, never
[1:07:16.920 --> 1:07:21.240]  a physical audit, never the machines, the same corrupt election officials and the Chinese
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:26.560]  communist pocket literally are the same ones that run it over and over again, so here it
[1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:33.520]  is, ladies and gentlemen, here is Trump saying he may even have to win a third time, but
[1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:55.280]  who knows, who knows, I may even decide to beat them for a third time, okay, I want to
[1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:59.520]  play that clip one more time, it's so historic and look, our crew did a great job, Tom Pabert
[1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:04.840]  did a great job over a national followers headline video, Trump hints at 2024 run in
[1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:08.840]  first post-presidency speech, may even decide to beat them a third time, that's a great
[1:08:08.840 --> 1:08:16.800]  headline, but Trump says he won the 2020 election at CPAC, may run again in 2024, that's what
[1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:22.000]  he really said, the takeaway isn't that he's hitting it, running again, he's already said
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:30.320]  that five times in the last few weeks, what he's saying is, I won the 2020 election and
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:33.680]  we are going to expose the election fraud, we're going to take it to him, that's what
[1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:39.000]  he went on to say, again, he's still speaking, he's been speaking for an hour and 20 minutes,
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:42.280]  let's go back to where the president is.
[1:08:42.280 --> 1:08:47.360]  Surrending millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to all of these other countries,
[1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:53.160]  almost all of them, that were in the deal, so they have favorable treatment, we don't
[1:08:53.160 --> 1:08:57.760]  have favorable treatment and we just said, we're going back in, to go back in they wanted
[1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:02.200]  us so badly, you could have negotiated, if you wanted to go back in, which frankly we
[1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:05.640]  have the cleanest there, the cleanest water and everything else that we've ever had, so
[1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:10.080]  I don't know why we have to, yeah, we got to make cuts, nobody else does, BS.
[1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:15.160]  And what good does it do when we're clean, but China's not and Russia's not and India's
[1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:20.680]  not, so they're pouring fumes, you know, the world is actually a small piece of the
[1:09:20.680 --> 1:09:25.440]  universe, right, they're pouring fumes and we're trying to protect everything and building
[1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:29.480]  products for three times more than is necessary.
[1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:33.280]  Hit pause on that, yeah, let's stop, yeah, three times more, energy's three times more,
[1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:36.080]  let's stop right there.
[1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:41.400]  Our coal power plants were perfected in the 80s, they were put in by law by the 90s,
[1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:46.080]  these companies paid tens of millions of dollars a retrofinem with scrubbers, nothing comes
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:52.040]  out of them but carbon dioxide and water that beat their carbon push, so they then listed
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:58.000]  carbon dioxide as bad, not monoxide, that is bad.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.360]  And again, China has little bitty power plants because it's just the turbine that turns the
[1:10:02.360 --> 1:10:06.280]  water for the steam, you know, to generate the electricity and you'll see a little bitty
[1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:12.080]  building and you'll see a train going into it with boxcars of coal and you'll see a smoke
[1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:16.800]  stack and it's shooting black smoke out that doesn't go away, you see our power plants
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:20.680]  and Europe before they shut them down, you only see them in cold weather and the media
[1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:24.960]  always aims cameras at it and goes look at that smoke, but you notice it's smoke for
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:29.960]  a couple hundred yards and then it ends because it's water vapor from a hot turbine coming
[1:10:29.960 --> 1:10:34.120]  out and that's all there is water vapor and carbon dioxide, so they listed carbon dioxide
[1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:38.400]  that we excel as a toxic chemical, so the average leftist idiot says shut that down,
[1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:42.800]  beautiful coal, but Trump calls it beautiful, beautiful coal because we've got the clean
[1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:49.200]  coal, we have enough coal in Utah that's clean because you can take dirty coal and scrub
[1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:54.440]  it out with these scrubbers, but no, we happen to have some of the biggest deposits in the
[1:10:54.440 --> 1:11:02.280]  world of coal that burns clean, almost nothing toxic is in it, it's pure carbon, pure carbon,
[1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:06.360]  not mercury, not lead, not all the stuff that could be in some coal, because some coal
[1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:11.360]  is dirtier than hell, yeah there's a map of a scrubber right there, that's a simple scrubber
[1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:18.320]  and boy are they complex though, okay let's go back to the president here it is, but they
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:23.560]  could have made a great deal and said if you say we're back in these people and in one
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:29.680]  of his first official acts which was incredible because again he talked about energy, he never
[1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:38.280]  said he was going to do this, he canceled the Keystone XL pipeline, destroying not the
[1:11:38.280 --> 1:11:47.600]  8000 or the 9000 or the 11000 jobs that you hear, but 42,000 great paying jobs on just
[1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:51.960]  about day one, right, he never talked about that during a debate, because he wouldn't
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:56.240]  have gotten away with it, the numbers vary, but the pipeline cost tens of millions of
[1:11:56.240 --> 1:12:00.280]  dollars, the numbers was 20 billion dollars, let's look it up, but he was going to be able
[1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:06.480]  to take 2 billion dollars of oil from Canada down to Houston and to Shreveport to supply
[1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:10.080]  the United States and keep us dominant in the world and prices down, oh sorry now it's
[1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:16.080]  going to be sent by train to the west coast of Canada to China, go back to Trump please,
[1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:22.680]  we cannot let this stuff continue to go on, one of my proudest accomplishments as president
[1:12:22.680 --> 1:12:27.760]  was to make America energy independent, the United States became the number one energy
[1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:44.960]  superpower, number one, this is a good place to stop because here's the deal, I'm sure
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:47.520]  Owen's going to play more of this, you can watch the whole thing if you want to it's
[1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:52.080]  linkedoninfowars.com, just remember this is being blocked out on most networks, other
[1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:56.680]  networks are only showing small clips, when you share his speech with people, wherever
[1:12:56.680 --> 1:12:59.600]  you find it, wherever you get it, you share this show, it's a revolutionary act, I just
[1:12:59.600 --> 1:13:05.160]  keep going back to practice, you're everything, I'm like a coach without a football team,
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:10.880]  if you don't decide to take action and spread the word, we sink, if you decide to take action
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:19.800]  we win and that's what it comes down to, alright this is what I want to do, I want to go big
[1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:24.160]  picture because we've got so many incredible reports that end up never getting on the show
[1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:27.800]  and this show has millions of listeners, the Sunday show has probably 2 million people
[1:13:27.800 --> 1:13:32.000]  to tune in, the weekday show about 4 million to tune in, just on terrestrial radio and
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:36.840]  over our streams, so when I just put this stuff on band.video it gets like 200,000 views,
[1:13:36.840 --> 1:13:41.680]  that's great but rarely does the video get 5 million views or 6 million views or 3 million
[1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:45.520]  views, we get a lot of videos that get 900,000 or a million or whatever and that's great,
[1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:50.400]  I don't care about the views for advertising, because for whatever reason the ads and the
[1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:56.920]  videos don't ever really bring any revenue, I want to reach eyeballs and beat these people
[1:13:56.920 --> 1:14:03.000]  and so just realize constantly that you're everything, when it comes to human beings,
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:06.560]  you taking action, God is everything in the great scheme, but when it comes to action
[1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:13.160]  on this earth, Tara Furmer, you're it, okay, Gregory's through an incredible report on
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:17.120]  weather weapons because we've gotten thousands of emails and calls, you've heard them, Alex
[1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:27.320]  was the solar or winter vortex, Arctic vortex, was it caused by the sun, was it caused by
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:33.360]  volcanic eruptions that can manipulate the vortex when that pot ashes in the air or was
[1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:38.840]  it caused by a harp type system and we did do some deep research, we did look at it,
[1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:43.400]  the Chinese say they can control weather, they've got arrays in their north that are able to
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:50.480]  actually manipulate the Arctic vortex and the jet stream and so it's globalist weather
[1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:56.880]  wars to crush humanity and it's pretty conclusive, it's extremely powerful, we're going to air
[1:14:56.880 --> 1:15:03.240]  that in the last segment of the broadcast here today, we've got several segments before
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:08.920]  then, I want to come back and I want to air just one of these reports because this is
[1:15:08.920 --> 1:15:14.540]  on Canadian TV they're getting it, British TV they're getting it, UK TV and Australian
[1:15:14.540 --> 1:15:21.160]  TV about world government and the new world order with corporations locking down economies
[1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:27.640]  to bankrupt economies to bankrupt capitalism and then to bring in a system that they call
[1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:31.800]  the great reset and I know you know all about the great reset but the fact is this is becoming
[1:15:31.800 --> 1:15:37.520]  very mainstream, this is a very positive thing because if people get how serious this is and
[1:15:37.520 --> 1:15:41.280]  get that it's the whole shooting match and if we can get Trump talking about it and the
[1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:45.520]  Republicans which they're barely doing then we can win this but if we don't get the Republican
[1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:50.200]  party talking about the great reset, talking about the new world order, talking about the
[1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:54.320]  whole COVID lockdown being operation lockstep we're going to lose but the good news is it's
[1:15:54.320 --> 1:16:23.320]  going mainstream everywhere else but here.
[1:16:23.320 --> 1:16:30.320]  We're going to lose but the good news is it's going mainstream everywhere else but the good
[1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:38.320]  news is it's going mainstream everywhere else but the good news is it's going mainstream
[1:16:38.320 --> 1:17:04.320]  everywhere else but the good news is it's going mainstream everywhere else but the good news
[1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:22.320]  is it's going mainstream everywhere else but the good news is it's going mainstream everywhere
[1:17:22.320 --> 1:17:27.520]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:29.840]  of total mass, high-tech slavery.
[1:17:29.840 --> 1:17:34.040]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:37.840]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the facts that they are truly the slave
[1:17:37.840 --> 1:17:38.840]  masters.
[1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:43.080]  A global permanent lockdown is here and it's already causing millions and millions to starve
[1:17:43.080 --> 1:17:44.080]  to death.
[1:17:44.080 --> 1:17:46.280]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[1:17:46.280 --> 1:17:49.920]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out
[1:17:49.920 --> 1:17:54.160]  and said the covered lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:55.160]  That's the facts.
[1:17:55.160 --> 1:17:59.200]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:08.720]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:16.480]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:23.520]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:24.520]  in males.
[1:18:24.520 --> 1:18:30.520]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:35.320]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:18:35.320 --> 1:18:42.720]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:47.720]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:49.360]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:51.360]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:54.360]  Never been a better time than right now.

[1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:01.120]  I actually bought this at Blocks, UHF frequency.
[1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:07.160]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:14.160]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without
[1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:15.600]  a battery.

[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:40.360]  Some agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers, are all tracking

[1:19:43.560 --> 1:19:48.840]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.

[1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:08.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:08.440 --> 1:20:21.080]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:26.720]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[1:20:26.720 --> 1:20:33.200]  Now when I say this, I want to be completely clear, I am talking to myself as much as I
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:34.200]  am talking to you.
[1:20:34.200 --> 1:20:37.960]  When I point my finger at you and I say I need your help, I'm pointing three fingers
[1:20:37.960 --> 1:20:40.600]  back at myself.
[1:20:40.600 --> 1:20:46.560]  InfoWars is so influential and has had such an effect around the world.
[1:20:46.560 --> 1:20:50.200]  We have to really be honest about that and that means what you've done.
[1:20:50.200 --> 1:20:55.320]  Your support, your word of mouth, your prayer, did this.
[1:20:55.320 --> 1:21:04.480]  You're just a focal point and so I want you to take a good retrospective of that information
[1:21:04.480 --> 1:21:07.640]  and just count the cost and pat yourself on the back, but then think about the future
[1:21:07.640 --> 1:21:08.640]  where we're going.
[1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:12.800]  Because again, if I played all these, it would take the whole show tonight, but just this
[1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:21.120]  weekend I saw British TV, UK TV, Australian TV, and Canadian news looking at the great
[1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:25.280]  reset for what it is, a world government corporate takeover where they're exempt from the taxes
[1:21:25.280 --> 1:21:30.960]  and the regulations, nobody else is, and then everybody from small farms to small factories
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:35.040]  to power plants gets shut down.
[1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:39.080]  And Australia is a couple of years ahead of us in this, so it's bankrupting their farmers,
[1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:43.280]  their businesses, but when China comes in, their companies are exempt by the government.
[1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:46.320]  Well, it's the same thing now with Biden.
[1:21:46.320 --> 1:21:47.320]  So this is very simple.
[1:21:47.320 --> 1:21:52.080]  The globalists are invested in China and they want everybody else shut down.
[1:21:52.080 --> 1:21:55.840]  And Australia has been leading the way when it comes to actually saying no to China because
[1:21:55.840 --> 1:21:59.920]  China is really trying to put the squeeze on them, and it controlled the last political
[1:21:59.920 --> 1:22:03.400]  party that was in control there and controls some of the major cities of Australia.
[1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:07.480]  And it's been Chinese government that basically had those cities do the endless lockdowns.
[1:22:07.480 --> 1:22:11.200]  So Australia's ground zero for this.
[1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:15.480]  And a Cory Bernardi, who I've seen many of his reports, is just hardcore and he lays
[1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:16.480]  it all out.
[1:22:16.480 --> 1:22:18.640]  The full transcript is on infowars.com.
[1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:23.840]  Socialism on a global scale, Sky News host, demolishes, debuts, elites, and the Great
[1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:24.840]  Reset.
[1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:26.080]  And it's beyond socialism.
[1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:30.680]  It's about corporate fascism, bankrupting everybody but them, making you a slave, universal
[1:22:30.680 --> 1:22:32.400]  guaranteed income to control you.
[1:22:32.400 --> 1:22:33.400]  Here's the report.
[1:22:33.400 --> 1:22:37.920]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, there are certain warning signs that we all need to be mindful
[1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:38.920]  of.
[1:22:38.920 --> 1:22:42.080]  You know, it's like when someone appears in your life and says, I'm from the government
[1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:43.760]  and I'm here to help you.
[1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:50.120]  Well, another warning sign is any organization with the term world in their name.
[1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:54.480]  So let's start with a couple, perhaps the World Health Organization to kick it off.
[1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:59.240]  That's the body that gave China a free pass on the Wuhan flu, while at the same time
[1:22:59.240 --> 1:23:04.480]  banking $500 million through issuing pandemic bonds.
[1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:05.480]  That's right.
[1:23:05.480 --> 1:23:09.880]  The World Health Organization was scheduled to repay investors around $500 million in
[1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:15.000]  early 2020, unless, of course, a pandemic was declared.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:19.880]  The investors lost all their money, but that became the World Health Organization's gain.
[1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:23.520]  Then, of course, there's the World Food Program.
[1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:28.400]  It too is part of the United Nations, and it actually won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020.
[1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:34.520]  Now, that sounds pretty impressive, until you remember that Barack Obama won it in 2008
[1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:37.080]  just for having the right skin color.
[1:23:37.080 --> 1:23:43.120]  And despite spending $8 billion every year on hunger and strengthening resilience against
[1:23:43.120 --> 1:23:49.000]  climate change, there are still 850 million undernourished people in the world and around
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:51.640]  780 million obese people.
[1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:55.680]  Clearly, we need more food socialism.
[1:23:55.680 --> 1:24:00.000]  Then we also have the World Meteorological Organization.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:06.200]  It has a crew of 200 and it publishes an annual status of the World Climate Report, casting
[1:24:06.200 --> 1:24:12.560]  horror scenarios about greenhouse gases, climate change, sea level rise and sea ice.
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:16.000]  The 2019 report is a beauty.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:21.040]  It essentially says that the Australian bushfires of that year were due to climate change and
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:28.520]  makes no mention of the arsonists or the Greens insistent on terrible land management policies.
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:35.080]  By the way, according to the WMO, climate change is also responsible for drought, floods,
[1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:37.960]  storms and weather related damage.
[1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:43.360]  That made me wonder what caused them before the industrial revolution or before mankind
[1:24:43.360 --> 1:24:45.480]  for that matter.
[1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:50.880]  But we're also fortunate enough to have the World Tourism Organization, which has, and
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:55.160]  I quote, a one planet vision for responsible tourism.
[1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:59.560]  These include the vital buzzwords, social inclusion and climate action.
[1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:06.840]  It even has some pretty cool hashtags, responsible recovery and build back better.
[1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:13.680]  And by shutting down the world economy this past year, it reduced carbon dioxide emissions
[1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:16.520]  by a whopping 8%.
[1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:21.440]  That means there's only 92% to go before we're back living in caves, but saving the
[1:25:21.440 --> 1:25:22.920]  planet while we do it.
[1:25:22.920 --> 1:25:28.280]  And of course we shouldn't forget the World Trade Organization, with lofty goals, espousing
[1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:29.840]  free trade.
[1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:35.880]  Its real mission seems not to be holding China to the same integrity requirements as the
[1:25:35.880 --> 1:25:41.720]  rest of the world when it comes to intellectual property protection, trade tariffs and barriers
[1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:42.720]  etc.
[1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:48.920]  Thank goodness it has the goal to reduce inequality, which is socialist speak for taking from the
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:52.760]  productive and giving to the non-productive.
[1:25:52.760 --> 1:25:55.080]  Someone needs to tell them about history.
[1:25:55.080 --> 1:26:01.760]  History shows it never works, but for those unable to sustain the rigor of the real world,
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:04.760]  there is always a refuge in the World Vegetable Centre.
[1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:07.840]  That's right, a World Vegetable Centre.
[1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:15.320]  This esteemed body devoted 20 years to researching the sweet potato before giving it away because
[1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:18.360]  the costs of doing that research were too high.
[1:26:18.360 --> 1:26:23.560]  It now focuses on, I quote, looking to the wild relatives of domesticated crops to save
[1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:25.920]  the human diet from climate change.
[1:26:25.920 --> 1:26:31.920]  Wowie, if only we never cultivated crops, the world would be better off and the climate
[1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:32.920]  wouldn't be changing.
[1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:37.800]  Hey, but what about those hungry people I mentioned earlier, wouldn't they be even
[1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:38.800]  hungrier?
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:44.840]  Well, all these authorities are pushing an agenda, it's the same agenda, it's to decarbonise,
[1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:48.480]  de-industrialise and disempower the western world.
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:54.600]  They are part of a concerted plan to re-design capitalism in a new image, that image of course
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:59.960]  is socialism, and it's spearheaded by the grand daddy organisation of them all, the
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:02.280]  World Economic Forum.
[1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:08.600]  The WEF is the architect of the Great Reset and the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
[1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:13.720]  They coined the build back better hashtag that is actually proving so popular with big
[1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:16.760]  government elites right across the globe.
[1:27:16.760 --> 1:27:22.840]  And they even predict that by 2030 you'll own nothing and you'll be happy.
[1:27:22.840 --> 1:27:29.160]  They call this servitisation, which is a term and an agenda that looks a lot like servitude
[1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:30.880]  to me.
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:37.480]  The World Economic Forum, the WEF, claim that this servitude, I'm sorry, I mean servitisation,
[1:27:37.480 --> 1:27:42.840]  will help save the planet and assist the post-COVID-19 recovery, there's a couple of those buzz
[1:27:42.840 --> 1:27:44.400]  phrases again.
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:50.600]  However, servitisation begs the question, if you don't actually own anything, who will
[1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:52.840]  own what you're renting?
[1:27:52.840 --> 1:27:59.400]  Well the answer lies within the WEF Premier Forum, that's at Davos.
[1:27:59.400 --> 1:28:05.200]  Davos is the gathering of global elites including big business CEOs, industry chiefs, government
[1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:10.480]  leaders, bureaucrats and multi-billionaires with political agendas.
[1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:16.320]  Under the WEF vision, the Davos attendees will own what you'll be renting.
[1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:20.760]  And trust me on this, it's not going to be a philanthropic enterprise, they'll all be
[1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:26.120]  looking to make more money than they currently do and actually to take more control of your
[1:28:26.120 --> 1:28:29.440]  life under the guise of equality.
[1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:35.040]  By reducing you to a mere user rather than an owner, the world does actually become more
[1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:40.960]  equal because it will concentrate power, authority and money in the hands of a tiny
[1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:46.360]  few or the rest of us become mere economic vassals for these oligarchs.
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:53.000]  So make no mistake, servitisation is just a new name for economic slavery, it's socialism
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  on a global scale.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:58.160]  Out of the park, post it in fours.
[1:28:58.160 --> 1:29:05.160]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:12.440]  that this is all a test, this experience, this whiteness planet is a reckoning.
[1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:17.720]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out of a third dimension so we can decide
[1:29:17.720 --> 1:29:22.000]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  down to that.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:27.080]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[1:29:27.080 --> 1:29:32.600]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness, God is the author of us
[1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:39.560]  having our own will, God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a
[1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:40.560]  beautiful thing.
[1:29:40.560 --> 1:29:44.760]  And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington
[1:29:44.760 --> 1:29:50.800]  DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will, it's all about
[1:29:50.800 --> 1:29:54.400]  telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in a bad, because Satan hates you because
[1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:58.640]  you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[1:29:58.640 --> 1:30:04.400]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy,
[1:30:04.400 --> 1:30:10.520]  food and medicine and with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered
[1:30:10.520 --> 1:30:16.480]  to bring in federal and globalist control, we have seen massive lines of people lined
[1:30:16.480 --> 1:30:21.520]  up at the few grocery stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned
[1:30:21.520 --> 1:30:24.160]  away after hours of freezing in the cold.
[1:30:24.160 --> 1:30:28.160]  We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power
[1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:30.160]  in their house and then running out of gas.
[1:30:30.160 --> 1:30:34.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king and food is the energy our bodies run off of and water
[1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:35.960]  as well.
[1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:38.800]  They're both available, the highest quality water filtration and the highest quality
[1:30:38.800 --> 1:30:44.320]  storeable foods right now, massively discounted because of this emergency for everybody nationwide
[1:30:44.320 --> 1:30:50.200]  at infowarstore.com, $50 off on our best stainless steel gravity filter and 10% off all storeable
[1:30:50.200 --> 1:30:53.480]  food in all packages at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:53.480 --> 1:31:03.000]  We told you it was coming under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore for eight
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:07.920]  months they've made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that make them a social distance
[1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:11.040]  and report them back to spell towers to track for every movement.
[1:31:11.040 --> 1:31:13.680]  This is for everybody, the way it gets better.
[1:31:13.680 --> 1:31:18.600]  Now France has programs in their factories, government push and sponsor to make everyone
[1:31:18.600 --> 1:31:24.240]  wear actual dog collars to make social distance and report back to computers.
[1:31:24.240 --> 1:31:26.600]  They're turning us into a commodity.
[1:31:26.600 --> 1:31:28.960]  Human animal clones have been around for 50 years.
[1:31:28.960 --> 1:31:30.080]  It's all being announced.
[1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:35.240]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete and big corporations
[1:31:35.240 --> 1:31:40.080]  downplay that they own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they produced.
[1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:41.080]  Do you understand?
[1:31:41.080 --> 1:31:45.520]  It is a takeover of the entire species at the genetic level and now they're coming with
[1:31:45.520 --> 1:31:49.880]  dog collars and they're announcing in public schools in the US starting next year it will
[1:31:49.880 --> 1:31:50.880]  begin.
[1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:51.880]  Did you hear me?
[1:31:51.880 --> 1:31:55.880]  Dog collars for your children all based on a hoax, all based on a lot.
[1:31:55.880 --> 1:31:58.640]  Employable wars continue to spread the word to fight back.
[1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:02.120]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:07.520]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought
[1:32:07.520 --> 1:32:09.200]  down to nothing.
[1:32:09.200 --> 1:32:14.280]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team.
[1:32:14.280 --> 1:32:17.200]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:24.440]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[1:32:24.440 --> 1:32:27.240]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[1:32:27.240 --> 1:32:29.600]  The enemy can't help itself.
[1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:33.640]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[1:32:33.640 --> 1:32:39.040]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it and we should but
[1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:44.920]  once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking
[1:32:44.920 --> 1:32:49.080]  us, we just have to point out we try to stop it.
[1:32:49.080 --> 1:32:51.280]  So prepare yourselves America.
[1:32:51.280 --> 1:32:54.920]  You're going under a judge but just like all the children that were aborted.
[1:32:54.920 --> 1:32:56.560]  This is the truth.
[1:32:56.560 --> 1:33:20.560]  This is the Infowarer.
[1:33:20.560 --> 1:33:27.040]  A modern-day warrior, it's the year 2021.
[1:33:27.040 --> 1:33:30.960]  Suppressed technologies that globalists have shown from humanity are in the year 2050
[1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:34.520]  conservatively.
[1:33:34.520 --> 1:33:41.360]  The future is here but it is not evenly distributed.
[1:33:41.360 --> 1:33:45.440]  Many a futurist has said that correctly and they are right.
[1:33:45.440 --> 1:33:47.200]  We're now in the future.
[1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:49.280]  We're now back to the future.
[1:33:49.280 --> 1:33:53.960]  Things like we've been here before, un-ancient species.
[1:33:53.960 --> 1:33:55.440]  You're tested on this planet.
[1:33:55.440 --> 1:33:58.760]  You know that yourselves, don't you?
[1:33:58.760 --> 1:34:07.160]  It's all going to come out soon and the enemy also suppress your mind and your soul so you
[1:34:07.160 --> 1:34:14.920]  don't tune into the right frequency so you tune into their frequency and fall.
[1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:21.920]  The world, my friends, the world is only a test.
[1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:31.800]  The universe is just a launch point itself.
[1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:34.800]  This planet is just a zygote.
[1:34:34.800 --> 1:34:42.640]  All right, so let's go back to Australian TV and it's not just Sky News over there.
[1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:43.640]  They're Fox News.
[1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:44.840]  It's all over the place.
[1:34:44.840 --> 1:34:47.000]  It's hotter than a flamethrower.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:48.520]  The people over there are living under it.
[1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:49.520]  They get it.
[1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:50.520]  They're pissed off about it.
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:56.840]  But again, even Canadian TV, UK TV, German TV, because the great reset is a corporate
[1:34:56.840 --> 1:35:02.160]  takeover that exempts China and 160 plus other third world countries where globalist corporations
[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:03.160]  are invested.
[1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:07.320]  But then it tells us in the first world we've got to go bankrupt and die because of carbon
[1:35:07.320 --> 1:35:08.320]  dioxide.
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:09.320]  It's all a fraud.
[1:35:09.320 --> 1:35:14.960]  To admit, COVID is nothing but the drill, the excuse to put this in place.
[1:35:14.960 --> 1:35:18.280]  And they say, Klaus Schwab, COVID is not an existential threat.
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:20.840]  It is only a pretext to do what must be done.
[1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:22.800]  I'm more of a Russian accent than a German accent.
[1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:25.320]  But I mean, that's what he says.
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:29.520]  I've played the video probably 15 times.
[1:35:29.520 --> 1:35:31.840]  Bill Gates, you'll no longer eat meat.
[1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:35.640]  You're going to eat celebrity cloned meat, but you'll be able to eat celebrities.
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:37.960]  We're like, that was in the news last week, LA Times.
[1:35:37.960 --> 1:35:41.520]  No Bill Gates, I don't want to eat celebrities meat.
[1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:44.680]  By the way, if you're a new listener, I'm not joking about that state.
[1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:47.480]  You're like, does it make sense?
[1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:52.240]  Why is Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab on every TV channel saying you're going to drink sewage
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:53.240]  water?
[1:35:53.240 --> 1:36:01.000]  You're going to eat weird cloned meat, synthetic meat, that's written by a 3D printer and you're
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  going to eat bugs.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:03.680]  I mean, I played the clip.
[1:36:03.680 --> 1:36:04.680]  People didn't believe me.
[1:36:04.680 --> 1:36:13.480]  I'm going to drink sewage and have bugs and eat waterweeds.
[1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:17.720]  And if you are in industry, close to people, you're industry gone.
[1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:19.760]  People not be next to each other ever again.
[1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:20.760]  We all dirty.
[1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:23.400]  And it's all based on not even a real bio weapon.
[1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:26.800]  Then I go, oh, they're getting us ready for a real one they're going to release.
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:27.800]  This is all just a drill.
[1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:31.960]  Then Bill Gates came out on Colbert and said, two months later, this is just a simulation
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:32.960]  for a drill.
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:35.640]  This is a real one coming from terrorists.
[1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:39.760]  Yeah, I got their number.
[1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:41.480]  I saw the comments on Twitter.
[1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:43.360]  They've got millions of views.
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:44.360]  Somebody found the video.
[1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:50.360]  I'm going to air it at the other show of in 2010, I read Operation Lockstep and it's
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:52.120]  all about locking her by down permanently.
[1:36:52.120 --> 1:36:55.880]  No human contact anymore worldwide martial law, the end of humans.
[1:36:55.880 --> 1:36:58.040]  And then the comments are like, he must be an insider.
[1:36:58.040 --> 1:36:59.560]  How does he know this?
[1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:03.640]  It's on the screen, the article from infowars.com 11 years ago.
[1:37:03.640 --> 1:37:05.600]  It's a damn Rockefeller document.
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:07.320]  I didn't come up with it.
[1:37:07.320 --> 1:37:09.040]  I'm not a prophet.
[1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:12.920]  I don't have a crystal ball, do you understand?
[1:37:12.920 --> 1:37:14.600]  But I do know who runs things.
[1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:16.760]  I do know who the globalist are.
[1:37:16.760 --> 1:37:20.280]  And I know that they're in charge because I see them calling the shots and I see when
[1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:26.040]  they snap their fingers, I see governments jump saying, how high?
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:37.480]  Now there's the video, only 284,000 views, been up for a week for four days.
[1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:39.320]  And again, this is making people freak out.
[1:37:39.320 --> 1:37:41.360]  They're like, how does he know this?
[1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:48.800]  Because the criminals wrote a owner's manual, it's in the video.
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:51.160]  But instead on Twitter, it's like, this guy's dangerous.
[1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:53.000]  I don't know how he knows all this.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.880]  Even on infowars, I saw comments like, this guy's an insider.
[1:37:55.880 --> 1:38:01.360]  He, he, he, I show you where they said it.
[1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:02.960]  See, it's not me doing it.
[1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:04.520]  Don't kill the messenger.
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:05.520]  This is a plan.
[1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:08.080]  Don't get mad at Corey Bernardi.
[1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:11.120]  He's just telling you what they're doing too.
[1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:12.120]  He's not psychic either.
[1:38:12.120 --> 1:38:14.080]  I mean, all humans are a little psychic.
[1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:15.080]  You know what I mean?
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:17.680]  He didn't dream this up out of some black hole.
[1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:21.560]  Like Harris Shearer said 20 years ago in a British documentary, he said, Alex Jones is
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:22.560]  incredible.
[1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:25.160]  The stuff he comes up with is like, he's the best science fiction writer ever.
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:28.600]  I mean, sure, I didn't come up with a damn bit of it, brother.
[1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:30.880]  The crazy globalists are the ones.
[1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:32.840]  And I go back to that.
[1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:36.360]  This is not Alex Jones's opinion.
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:37.360]  This is not a game.
[1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:39.440]  This is the real world.
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:40.720]  This is the facts.
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:41.720]  They're coming to kill you.
[1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:44.720]  First, they're going to cut your resources off to get control of you.
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:46.080]  Take all your speech away.
[1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:49.840]  Then slowly murder your ass because they say they're saving the earth.
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:55.800]  So let's play just the end of Corey Bernardi from Sky TV where he lays it out and then
[1:38:55.800 --> 1:39:01.520]  I'm going to play you a video posted on Thursday by the Davos group that runs the UN, runs
[1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:05.640]  everything with Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab saying, it is so wonderful.
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:07.480]  The city's also quiet.
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:09.440]  Everyone is so happy now that lockdown.
[1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:11.840]  We need a new lockdown for the environment.
[1:39:11.840 --> 1:39:13.200]  The birds are so happy.
[1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:16.400]  Tens of millions already starved to death extra.
[1:39:16.400 --> 1:39:17.680]  You just go bankrupt.
[1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:20.560]  People started to death in Africa and Latin America and Asia.
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:24.520]  And so they had to pull the video because they're like, lockdowns are so beautiful.
[1:39:24.520 --> 1:39:28.720]  To watch you die is so good.
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:29.720]  Need to reset.
[1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:32.400]  And they admit COVID is the excuse of that.
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:35.320]  So when you walk around your mask, you're playing into the whole eye.
[1:39:35.320 --> 1:39:40.080]  You're finishing up with Corey Bernardi.
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:45.920]  Under the WF vision, the Davos attendees will own what you'll be renting.
[1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:47.440]  And trust me on this.
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:49.840]  It's not going to be a philanthropic enterprise.
[1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:54.280]  They'll all be looking to make more money than they currently do and actually to take
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:59.080]  more control of your life under the guise of equality.
[1:39:59.080 --> 1:40:04.680]  By reducing you to a mere user rather than an owner, the world does actually become more
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:10.600]  equal because it will concentrate power, authority and money in the hands of a tiny
[1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:16.000]  few or the rest of us become mere economic vessels for these oligarchs.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:21.480]  To make no mistake, servitization is just a new name for economic slavery.
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:24.120]  It's socialism on a global scale.
[1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:26.160]  Well, that's right.
[1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:32.320]  Servitization is a word cooked up 25 years ago by the UN and Klaus Schwab when he was
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:35.640]  heading up the UN biological diversity sustainability board.
[1:40:35.640 --> 1:40:37.280]  Look it up.
[1:40:37.280 --> 1:40:38.680]  And everything with him is a sick joke.
[1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:39.880]  Oh, we don't want global government.
[1:40:39.880 --> 1:40:42.120]  We want global governance.
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:43.120]  Governance means government.
[1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:44.440]  Oh, we don't want serfdom.
[1:40:44.440 --> 1:40:46.160]  We want servitization.
[1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:49.000]  Oh, we're going to serve you.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:50.520]  These ruthless monsters.
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:51.520]  God, they're incredible.
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:52.520]  Oh, yeah.
[1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:56.000]  Bill Gates, who says he wants to exterminate, you really want you to live a nice life.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:00.320]  But people just, especially women, on average get all liberal that the university tells
[1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:01.320]  them you're the elite.
[1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:02.320]  You're taking over.
[1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:03.320]  Don't need men.
[1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:05.600]  Don't need children because they're just setting you up to be destroyed.
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:07.400]  I'm not against women.
[1:41:07.400 --> 1:41:10.360]  Men are watching football, acting tough or acting like bigger idiots.
[1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:14.960]  Women are like, we're saving Earth with Klaus Schwab and we're ending the family and, oh,
[1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:17.240]  we're giving little boys sterilant chemicals.
[1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:21.840]  Oh, because they start war.
[1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:27.360]  And it's all literally Klaus Schwab whose grandfather ran the Nazi nuke program.
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:29.880]  I can't make this up.
[1:41:29.880 --> 1:41:33.680]  Junker that heads up the EU is the most powerful Nazi Lord ever.
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:36.360]  He has the entire Nazi fortune.
[1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:37.360]  He owns Luxembourg.
[1:41:37.360 --> 1:41:38.360]  Look it up.
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:39.920]  But you're like, oh, I love him.
[1:41:39.920 --> 1:41:42.040]  And they're not Nazis.
[1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:43.600]  They created the Nazis.
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:48.280]  The Nazis were like, just a fever dream they had.
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:49.280]  Just a little side test.
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:50.280]  Here.
[1:41:50.280 --> 1:41:52.280]  Let's go out to break with this Davos video that they just pulled.
[1:41:52.280 --> 1:41:53.280]  Here it is.
[1:41:53.280 --> 1:42:13.360]  There's seismic noises for the lowest of decades.
[1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:14.360]  Scientists saw waves of quiet around the world 2020.
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:15.360]  Ambient noise at some cities of a different extent.
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:16.360]  And fewer people used airports and the transit.
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:17.360]  And factories closed.
[1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:18.360]  Oh, it's so good.
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:19.360]  The quiet-enabled scientists record small earthquakes.
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:21.560]  They usually miss when people starve to death.
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:27.360]  And improve their understanding of seismic activity so they can predict larger earthquakes
[1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:29.200]  in the future.
[1:42:29.200 --> 1:42:33.280]  There was also record falls in air pollution.
[1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:35.280]  Clearing skies, Asian America.
[1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:38.920]  By the end of 2020, it returned to pre-pandemic levels.
[1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:42.920]  It's time for a new lockdown for lower carbon emissions.
[1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:44.920]  Oh, it's so loving.
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:46.920]  It's so liberal.
[1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:48.560]  It's so good.
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:50.640]  Please just roll over and starve to death.
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:53.200]  Spill gates need your property.
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:58.640]  Final segment straight ahead.

[1:43:07.560 --> 1:43:08.560]  storeable food.

[1:43:10.080 --> 1:43:11.440]  We rarely do this.
[1:43:11.440 --> 1:43:17.000]  That is a gigantic sale and an additional 10% off as well because of the crisis and
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  the emergency.
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:20.080]  Our supplier has decided to let us do this.

[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:01.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room and I have
[1:44:01.400 --> 1:44:08.520]  had a major wake-up call living in Texas this last week about how important storeable food
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:09.520]  is.
[1:44:09.520 --> 1:44:13.880]  Now I have plenty of storeable food at my house but my notion has always been this is
[1:44:13.880 --> 1:44:19.880]  last case scenario, worst case scenario, like end of America, apocalyptic type of scenario
[1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:21.960]  but I'm realizing now that's not the case.
[1:44:21.960 --> 1:44:26.360]  Folks, they can shut off the power, they can shut off the water at any given moment.
[1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:30.440]  Now I was lucky I had plenty of food in my fridge and in my pantry that I didn't have
[1:44:30.440 --> 1:44:34.640]  to dig into my storeable food but many people in Texas didn't.
[1:44:34.640 --> 1:44:37.840]  Don't be in that situation, don't have that major wake-up call.
[1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:42.360]  When they come to shut down your power and they shut down the stores and the food supply,
[1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:47.480]  add the backup, have the insurance and be ready to feed yourself, your family, your
[1:44:47.480 --> 1:44:53.560]  friends and your neighbors with the storeable food, best quality, best price, 10% off right
[1:44:53.560 --> 1:44:58.280]  now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:05.600]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee, I just love it, I can't get enough of it.
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:10.960]  We've got a fresh brew right now, that's what fills my mug, that's what fills my belly,
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:12.640]  that's what fills my soul.
[1:45:12.640 --> 1:45:18.240]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee, folks we have had this coffee for years at InfoWarsStore.com
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:21.040]  years, never raised the price, never.
[1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:25.440]  The Wake Up America Blend, the best coffee, the crew here loves it, we drink it every
[1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:30.840]  day and of course that's just one of the great ways you can support InfoWars here.
[1:45:30.840 --> 1:45:35.360]  Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody, why not support InfoWars and keep the coffee
[1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:38.520]  supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend.
[1:45:38.520 --> 1:45:42.480]  Of course read all the great reviews, pretty much perfect review there, 4.9 star, when
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:46.760]  you have thousands of reviews it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally
[1:45:46.760 --> 1:45:50.360]  everybody gets it 5 stars, so I mean if you have 4.9 that's pretty much everybody gets
[1:45:50.360 --> 1:45:52.120]  it 5 stars, except maybe 1 or 2 people.
[1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:58.920]  Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee, only available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:45:58.920 --> 1:46:07.840]  In the early 1990s it was a really funny movie that came out, called Wayne's World.
[1:46:07.840 --> 1:46:12.200]  Even before I had an access to your show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie
[1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:16.640]  and thought, man that looks fun, in fact you speak out and have your own ideas and even
[1:46:16.640 --> 1:46:20.480]  if you're a nerd you're still entertaining because you're real, well what do they say
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:21.480]  in Wayne's World?
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:25.320]  We're not worthy, we're not worthy.
[1:46:25.320 --> 1:46:29.280]  Every day when I cover these huge topics I don't feel worthy to talk to you, because
[1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:32.880]  these topics are so huge are so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth, I'm trying
[1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:34.560]  to get it right and most of the time we do.
[1:46:34.560 --> 1:46:40.240]  The globalists love lying to you, they love manipulating you, they enjoy destroying humanity,
[1:46:40.240 --> 1:46:45.760]  they enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them, that for me is really
[1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:46.760]  success and disgusting.
[1:46:46.760 --> 1:46:53.640]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew that we will never join
[1:46:53.640 --> 1:47:01.480]  the globalists, we will never knowingly manipulate you, because we know we're all in this together.
[1:47:01.480 --> 1:47:08.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:22.400]  Alright, so the final segment of the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones show, been on there
[1:47:22.400 --> 1:47:27.640]  27 years for 15 years, man time flies fast, I've been doing the Sunday show in love coming
[1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:28.640]  in here.
[1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:32.160]  When everybody else is watching the football game or wherever, I'd rather be here fight
[1:47:32.160 --> 1:47:36.360]  the globalists, because I know how real this is, I'm personally threatened by it.
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:39.880]  Growing up, people start fights with me and they start kicking my ass, but once they start
[1:47:39.880 --> 1:47:43.880]  to kick my ass, I always won, no matter how big they were, once I was getting my ass
[1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:49.520]  whipped, I'd snap and win, and it's the same thing now, I'm under attack, I can't back
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:54.400]  down, I can't get in, I'm getting beat up here, I'm getting torn apart, so are you.
[1:47:54.400 --> 1:47:58.200]  And the war is political and it's spiritual and it's economic and you've got to reach
[1:47:58.200 --> 1:48:01.000]  out to God for help and you've got to take action with that information.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:05.400]  Alright, I said I was going to air this report, but if Owen wants to air it when he does,
[1:48:05.400 --> 1:48:09.120]  it's Sunday Live coming up here in about 10 minutes, he's welcome too, it's on Band
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:12.840]  Dot Video, it's a very powerful report, I'll definitely air it on my 4-hour show tomorrow
[1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:15.760]  that kicks off at 11am central.
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:20.600]  But it's globalist weather, wars to crush humanity and it's the admissions by the UN,
[1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:25.840]  admissions by Kennedy, admissions by former CIA director John Brennan, that there are
[1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:29.680]  weather weapons and they've kept them secret and it's ongoing, it's a very important little
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:32.160]  seven and a half minute report.
[1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:38.320]  But I got behind and the crew reminded me that I have not gotten to these important reports
[1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:45.040]  and this is about the good news that is taking place, the good news that is happening.
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:49.400]  I did end up watching quite a bit of CPAC because the left said it should be banned,
[1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:53.240]  they tried to shut down the hotel, they threatened it, they boycotted because there are a bunch
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:59.280]  of authoritarian scum and they're pissed off that our ideas are popular and theirs aren't.
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:03.560]  And I could have gone to CPAC, I went last year and it was a huge, huge deal but it became
[1:49:03.560 --> 1:49:09.720]  a distraction for the president, I didn't go this year deliberately.
[1:49:09.720 --> 1:49:14.040]  But Roger Stone did, that was quite the circus, he's joining us tomorrow, he's talking about
[1:49:14.040 --> 1:49:17.680]  the aftermath of it, but glad he went.
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:25.200]  This is Fauci is wrong, Governor Noam, Christie Noam and a great president, she's a smart
[1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:31.320]  lady, struck out at Fauci as a fraud and by the way, she could tend to hell, he said
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:35.160]  you'll have 10,000 beds a day, it was 600, most of them had something else, it's actually
[1:49:35.160 --> 1:49:38.680]  their regular number for flu and pneumonia that winter.
[1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:44.720]  And he said 10,000 a day, it was 600 and somebody just goes, oh, it's incredible, they questioned
[1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:52.080]  Fauci, CNN, I saw it this morning, I can't believe that she questioned him, he is incredible,
[1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:55.320]  let's go to this medical doctor, he goes, I can't believe you questioned him.
[1:49:55.320 --> 1:49:59.680]  He said you'd have 4 to 5% dying of it, he said that the hospitals would be full, he
[1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:05.520]  also said, don't wear a mask early on, he's a big pharma front man, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:50:05.520 --> 1:50:10.400]  and now he says, oh, we opened up too soon last year, stay locked down so we can reopen
[1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:16.680]  next year, notice it's year after year of this monster controlling our lives, so here
[1:50:16.680 --> 1:50:26.040]  is the governor, South Dakota, Christie Nome, well, I'd love to see a, let me see a Trump
[1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:29.320]  Nome candidacy for president, but I don't know if Trump's going to be too old, still
[1:50:29.320 --> 1:50:33.480]  looks great, we'll see, it doesn't matter, we're going to move mountains here regardless,
[1:50:33.480 --> 1:50:36.200]  we're going to expose these monsters and stop implying.
[1:50:36.200 --> 1:50:40.000]  Let's go ahead, before it gets totally habituated and becomes accustomed, we never take the
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:43.960]  mask off, which CNN says is the plan of Fauci, that once they can make you do it a year,
[1:50:43.960 --> 1:50:49.400]  they say most people do it forever, so that takes leaders like DeSantis saying it to fraud
[1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:52.840]  and saying, no, by the way, I have statistics here, I'm going to show you in a moment that
[1:50:52.840 --> 1:50:56.600]  states that did not wear a mask and did not lock down, had less death per capita than
[1:50:56.600 --> 1:51:01.200]  other states, but again, here is Fauci's wrong a lot, it's another way of saying he's full
[1:51:01.200 --> 1:51:02.880]  of, you know what, here it is.
[1:51:02.880 --> 1:51:09.840]  Now, Dr. Fauci, he told me that on my worst day, I'd have 10,000 patients in the hospital,
[1:51:09.840 --> 1:51:20.680]  but on our worst day, we had a little over 600, now, Fauci's full of crap, I don't know
[1:51:20.680 --> 1:51:27.400]  if you agree with me, but Dr. Fauci is wrong a lot, well the fact star is wrong constantly,
[1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:34.080]  yeah, biggest thing I heard yet, all right, that's good, let's go to the next clip, this
[1:51:34.080 --> 1:51:38.160]  is a, I saw this on CNN too, so I tuned in and found the actual clip, they were like,
[1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:42.840]  oh my gosh, they told them all wear their mask and they didn't and they booed and almost
[1:51:42.840 --> 1:51:46.880]  no one was wearing the stupid mask, they tried to enforce it, oh, this is private property,
[1:51:46.880 --> 1:51:51.520]  do it, no, it's all a giant fraud, it's saying, I'm not wearing your little burka, your little
[1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:57.880]  face diapers, comebacks, so here it is, CPAC, host booed, frassic attendees that wear their
[1:51:57.880 --> 1:51:58.880]  muzzles.
[1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:05.320]  We conservatives believe in the rule of law, because we know that when the laws enforced,
[1:52:05.320 --> 1:52:11.560]  our rights are protected, that's why we're doing such a big effort at this CPAC to talk
[1:52:11.560 --> 1:52:15.160]  about the Bill of Rights, but I also want to mention one thing, and I know this might
[1:52:15.160 --> 1:52:19.080]  sound like a little bit of a downer, but we also believe in property rights, and this
[1:52:19.080 --> 1:52:22.920]  is a private hotel, and we believe in the rule of law, so we need to comply with the
[1:52:22.920 --> 1:52:27.240]  laws of this county that we're in, there is no law, private hotel just like your house
[1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:34.920]  gets to set its own rules, Carl, our CPAC director, well, as Dan mentioned, we are in
[1:52:34.920 --> 1:52:42.600]  a private facility, and we do want to be respectful of the ordinances that they have as their
[1:52:42.600 --> 1:52:43.600]  private property, so please...
[1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:45.600]  Well, this woman looks like she's had a lot of vaccines.
[1:52:45.600 --> 1:52:51.040] ...when you're in the ballroom, when you're seated, you should be wearing a mask, so if
[1:52:51.040 --> 1:52:54.600]  everybody can go ahead, work on that.
[1:52:54.600 --> 1:52:55.600]  Work on that.
[1:52:55.600 --> 1:52:58.600]  I know, I know, it's not the most fun.
[1:52:58.600 --> 1:53:09.000]  You have the right to set your own rules in your own house, and we're borrowing from
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  the...
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  Shut up, shut them down.
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  Thank you.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:13.480]  All right, let's go ahead and go to these articles.
[1:53:13.480 --> 1:53:16.520]  New COVID-19 cases have stopped declining.
[1:53:16.520 --> 1:53:21.320]  Don't repeat the mistakes of 2020 and start the new surge, Fauci says, institute a new
[1:53:21.320 --> 1:53:23.320]  lockdown and wear two masks.
[1:53:23.320 --> 1:53:28.520]  Oh, you want to take one mask off, wear two, you want to take two off, wear three.
[1:53:28.520 --> 1:53:30.240]  Things wrong a lot, we just showed you that.
[1:53:30.240 --> 1:53:35.040]  The folly of lockdowns exposed in one simple graph, big article out of Red State, here's
[1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:39.280]  the CDC's own graphs, overhead shot, please, and look at that.
[1:53:39.280 --> 1:53:44.000]  Red states are the ones that didn't do lockdowns and didn't do the force mask mandates, and
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:49.080]  if you average them together, they are the lowest total by over 60%, and of course, you
[1:53:49.080 --> 1:53:54.360]  got New York or where they did this, the worst levels, where they tell black folks, stay indoors
[1:53:54.360 --> 1:53:58.640]  when black folks need three times the sunlight, white folks need on average, that's fact.
[1:53:58.640 --> 1:54:03.360]  Don't give out a D3, any virus will kill you, whether you're white, Hispanic, Asian, black.
[1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:13.760]  But if you don't get sun and you're an African American, you will die of any virus.
[1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:19.480]  New Zealand Prime Minister plunges Auckland into second lockdown in a month after new
[1:54:19.480 --> 1:54:24.920]  case was found, a single case, and now you're all back under lockdown again, total martial
[1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:25.920]  law.
[1:54:25.920 --> 1:54:30.560]  World Economic Forum shouted down on Twitter, suggesting COVID-19 lockdowns, improved cities
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:35.000]  all over the world, that's a quote, improved cities, yes, going bankrupt, everything falling
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.160]  apart, it's so improved.
[1:54:37.160 --> 1:54:43.840]  All right, let's end this with my prediction, 11 years ago, the lockdowns, and then Owen
[1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:52.520]  Troyer's coming up with Sunday Live, please spread the word, God bless you all.
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:57.000]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information that's powerful, and I hope
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:03.240]  that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute, because I've had chills
[1:55:03.240 --> 1:55:11.160]  since last night, this just confirms everything else we've already researched, a Rockefeller
[1:55:11.160 --> 1:55:16.840]  study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory
[1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:21.720]  quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents,
[1:55:21.720 --> 1:55:26.320]  but this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food sterilize
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:30.440]  you and forced vaccines, and the hell we're already living in, this is going to continue
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:34.640]  to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen, but that
[1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:39.480]  story is up on PrisonPlanet.com, the question is, will you have the courage to really do
[1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:43.440]  the research yourself, because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these
[1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:44.440]  claims.
[1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:49.320]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're
[1:55:49.320 --> 1:55:55.280]  producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never
[1:55:55.280 --> 1:55:56.280]  read them all.
[1:55:56.280 --> 1:55:59.600]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[1:55:59.600 --> 1:56:05.000]  I pray to God, I pray to my heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:09.440]  and the will to be able to face this horror, and to give me the strength to carry on, because
[1:56:09.440 --> 1:56:14.000]  I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:18.520]  on the YouTube videos or on message boards and I'm a liar.
[1:56:18.520 --> 1:56:25.200]  I know why, because it's scary.
[1:56:25.200 --> 1:56:29.600]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:32.040]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends, you're not
[1:56:32.040 --> 1:56:37.600]  going to be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:44.160]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:50.360]  that takes its time to incrementally enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically,
[1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:57.320]  spiritually, the only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize
[1:56:57.320 --> 1:57:02.440]  that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:06.640]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will
[1:57:06.640 --> 1:57:07.840]  take over your life.
[1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:09.440]  It should take over your life.
[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:11.480]  I mean, what else?
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:14.720]  What else could it do?
[1:57:14.720 --> 1:57:18.960]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the control corporate media has been
[1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:26.720]  putting out for decades ahead of their opening of unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:30.240]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[1:57:30.240 --> 1:57:35.160]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep, display the seriousness of our
[1:57:35.160 --> 1:57:38.160]  commitment at home and abroad.
[1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:42.160]  When losers are drawn, you need to choose a sign.
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:48.120]  Infowars, Tomorrow's News Today.
