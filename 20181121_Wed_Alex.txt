[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  Human destiny on the line, will humanity awaken before it's too late?
[00:08.000 --> 00:11.000]  I don't know, it's up to you, isn't it?
[00:11.000 --> 00:20.000]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[00:20.000 --> 00:28.000]  you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[00:28.000 --> 00:32.000]  We're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:32.000 --> 00:39.000]  You know, I wrote that liner about five years ago, and since then we've regained the state to a great extent.
[00:39.000 --> 00:45.000]  Neocons are kicked out, the leftists are battling to maintain their beach heads,
[00:45.000 --> 00:54.000]  and we are launching attacks at the spiritual level with patriots all over the world pushing for a pro-human future.
[00:54.000 --> 01:05.000]  From Brazil to Japan, from South Africa to Italy, the fight is now on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  This is it.
[01:09.000 --> 01:20.000]  So, yesterday, I began the broadcast with the chemical and biological war going on against the human species.
[01:20.000 --> 01:28.000]  Because if you look at everything going on, this is the main globalist attack.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  And it's the main thing I've been told on record and off the record.
[01:32.000 --> 01:39.000]  You've seen it all over the news. Jones has been taken off all the platforms because he's being mean to transgenders.
[01:39.000 --> 01:46.000]  So they take one group, they brain damage them with chemicals, they sterilize them, children they target.
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.000]  Then if you try to help them, they say you're being mean to the wonderful transformation that's happened.
[01:52.000 --> 02:00.000]  And then once they've set that precedent, they roll out with all the other chemicals in the food and water that will completely sterilize the entire population.
[02:00.000 --> 02:07.000]  So like a parrot or an owl will reach over to a branch that's about to get on and put its beak on it to test the perch.
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  They're testing the perch right now.
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.000]  The globalists, when they see big crowds of people or when they see big happy families, they're not happy themselves.
[02:17.000 --> 02:25.000]  And they see that as someone they want to exterminate, someone that's eating into their food.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  The globalists created the fiat currencies.
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  And to do that, they had to debase everybody else's savings.
[02:32.000 --> 02:41.000]  But then they look at the whole value of the world and they look at like, well, we have more wealth in the 1% than everybody else.
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  So we don't even need these people, even though they've created the wealth of everything else, you have this imaginal digital fiat number that represents everything.
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  So you're saying it's my planet and I stole it through fraud and it's all digital.
[02:53.000 --> 03:00.000]  I don't really hold it or control it, but because you exist, you're hurting valuable resources.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Instead of saying, oh, we're all in this human experience together, let's not suppress technology.
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.000]  Let's go off war.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  The decision has been made to murder you and your family.
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  But see, if they march out and shoot you, the soldiers are going to say no.
[03:15.000 --> 03:26.000]  And they're going to see dead kids and people are going to fight back and even the U.S. controlled by the globalists who control both Vietnam and the U.S.
[03:26.000 --> 03:34.000]  And that experiment couldn't defeat the Vietnamese because they were nationalists.
[03:34.000 --> 03:41.000]  Communism was just the operating system, but at core they were nationalists and they were willing to fight back.
[03:41.000 --> 03:48.000]  And they were a team and they were cohesive and you couldn't beat them no matter how many you killed because resistance is victory.
[03:48.000 --> 03:58.000]  But if they'd have been taught and had chemicals put in their water and been beguiled by Hollywood and taken over their education system,
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.000]  they would have slept their rest and eased into that hot bath real fast.
[04:04.000 --> 04:19.000]  But the globalists knew if they could capture America and poison us with that Satan snake bite, that we would then fall to the system as a Trojan horse
[04:19.000 --> 04:30.000]  and that everyone else would then, seeking out the American dream, find that it was a nightmare and that we had fallen with them, everyone else.
[04:30.000 --> 04:41.000]  So that's the plan on this Wednesday, November 21st, 2018, Global Transmission.
[04:41.000 --> 04:50.000]  Stay with us, we'll be back on the other side to lay out the plan, now taking place to sterilize your children and to give you cancer
[04:50.000 --> 05:00.000]  and to fill everything you've got. It's a fact, they want to murder you, it's all part of being usurped.
[05:00.000 --> 05:08.000]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it,
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.000]  that it lowers IQ, it literally dumbs the population down.
[05:12.000 --> 05:19.000]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[05:19.000 --> 05:25.000]  The first seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it,
[05:25.000 --> 05:31.000]  so we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2, that's been incredible.
[05:31.000 --> 05:39.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine,
[05:39.000 --> 05:49.000]  chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  and makes it even more bioavailable.
[05:52.000 --> 05:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[05:57.000 --> 06:10.000]  Next three, now available at m4slife.com.
[06:10.000 --> 06:20.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[06:20.000 --> 06:31.000]  You know, I wish that what we talked about here wasn't the zeitgeist. I wish that what we discussed here was not the truth.
[06:31.000 --> 06:39.000]  I wish that I was a liar. I wish that I'd betrayed you. I wish that I'd been wrong all along.
[06:39.000 --> 06:56.000]  The truth is, we're the most demonized, most thought about, most attack broadcast in the world because whatever strange twist of fate m4s is bullseye on target.
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  Think about that.
[06:59.000 --> 07:10.000]  See, the average person is going to watch football. The average person is going to worry about their own company and their friends and having a good time.
[07:10.000 --> 07:14.000]  They're not going to read all the books that Benjamin Brzezinski wrote.
[07:14.000 --> 07:20.000]  They're not going to read Julius Caesar. They're not going to read David Rockefeller right off that line.
[07:20.000 --> 07:31.000]  I was the weirdo that did it and I suddenly saw in what they were planning was happening.
[07:31.000 --> 07:41.000]  I remember being a kid and my dad was into history shows with my mom and there were all the bookshelves, all over the house, even in like hallways, bookshelves, bookshelves, books everywhere, books everywhere.
[07:41.000 --> 07:53.000]  I look at the cover. I would grab like the technotronic era between two ages by Brzezinski when I was like three years old and I would look at it out of all the books and I would say, oh, that's an interesting book.
[07:53.000 --> 08:01.000]  You know, a criminal element of government ships in the drugs and runs the child, kidnapping rings and all the rest of it.
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  And I'd say, how do you know that? And he'd say, oh, well, when do you get bigger to know about it?
[08:05.000 --> 08:13.000]  But they believe they control the crime by being the crime. That's how they sell people. It really gets to expand the crime.
[08:13.000 --> 08:28.000]  And all these years later, here we are, the day before Thanksgiving and what is the big secret?
[08:28.000 --> 08:41.000]  There's a lot of big secrets, but if you want to understand everything from a globalist mindset, it's stealth.
[08:41.000 --> 08:47.000]  And if you just see people as seeds, well, you can burn a whole field.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  As long as you have the seeds, you can replant and you can choose which seeds you want.
[08:51.000 --> 09:04.000]  That's the Godlike behavior. Oh, you don't deserve free will. You don't deserve a destiny. No, no, real leadership knows how to just wipe all these groups out because it has true vision.
[09:04.000 --> 09:13.000]  And that's why it should be in power is because it is in power. So that gives it prima facia right and to rule.
[09:13.000 --> 09:22.000]  But the big secret that I hope people pay attention to why the enemy now just always seeking to shut me up.
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  If we kill him, it makes him a martyr. Let's kill his name. Let's shut him down. Let's use him as an enemy of freedom.
[09:28.000 --> 09:37.000]  Let's build straw man Godzilla to attack the world that isn't Alex Jones, but that we say is Alex Jones. That's their plan.
[09:37.000 --> 09:46.000]  But what is it I'm saying? It's that silent weapons for quiet wars.
[09:46.000 --> 09:56.000]  Read those papers, which is nothing compared to the real silent weapons for real quiet wars.
[09:56.000 --> 10:10.000]  That was just somebody in mid level briefings that got part of it. Colonel Alexander that wrote about it, wrote books, silent weapons for quiet wars, killing softly.
[10:10.000 --> 10:20.000]  You never know who killed you. You died 10 years later or your child dies. They've got reasons for it because even those that don't know why it happened.
[10:20.000 --> 10:38.000]  Silent weapons for quiet wars. So the whole science is the earth's overpopulated according to them, which it is because they made sure it was so they could have more people to kill.
[10:38.000 --> 10:49.000]  It's more fun. And the most important thing is getting high IQ people to join with the killing at the end so that you get their soul.
[10:49.000 --> 10:58.000]  Because there's more levels to this than just what we're supposed to see. See how that works.
[10:58.000 --> 11:08.000]  So if they're going to reduce the population of Western countries 20, 30 points, they know the adjuvants and chemicals and the vaccines that'll do it.
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.000]  But statistically, some people are going to have bad reactions. That's going to kill certain numbers of people.
[11:14.000 --> 11:32.000]  So you have a secret multi-billion dollar fund for smarter people that soon get upset where you make them stay in court for a decade and then give them a paltry million dollars for their dead or brain damaged child.
[11:32.000 --> 11:42.000]  Because real leaders in the actuaries understand you have to break eggs to make omelets.
[11:42.000 --> 11:51.000]  That's their sick thinking. Oh, but they all eat non-GMO. They all drink filtered water. None of that. They have statistics. They even admit it.
[11:51.000 --> 12:03.000]  The ultra-rich do not take vaccines because there are not vaccines that have been developed that are actually meant to be therapeutic.
[12:03.000 --> 12:16.000]  The science of the medical system is to kill, not to heal. That's why they got rid of the Hippocratic oath 20 years ago. But I digress, my friends.
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.000]  We're replacing an altruistic priesthood with a priesthood of death.
[12:22.000 --> 12:40.000]  And so the great secret is you don't want to shoot somebody outright, out in the middle of the square, a woman, a child. Because their husbands and their brothers, even if they're not warriors, will get a gun or get a weapon and kill you.
[12:40.000 --> 12:56.000]  But if you have somebody else who means well, administer a vaccine or have the mother gives them a GMO crop, then they get a disorder and they die and no one knows what hit them.
[12:56.000 --> 13:14.000]  Nobody knows what ran them over. And in the satanic order, killing a child, but making you go through excruciating years of pain and fighting for their lives when you've got the cure. Oh, fighting for that life when you know you're killing them.
[13:14.000 --> 13:28.000]  Oh, that's so much better than just having a bunch of witches torture a baby and cut it up and suck its blood for an hour while it cries with mommy. It's so much better to do it for a couple years, you see.
[13:28.000 --> 13:38.000]  And so the big secret is killing you slowly, but never letting you know what hit you.
[13:38.000 --> 13:46.000]  Now, the time it hits you, you're already dead. You're already run over.
[13:46.000 --> 13:57.000]  And so that's the big satanic secret. They put chemicals in the water to confuse your gender. Then they tell your child when their brain damaged, you're a girl, you're a boy when you're not.
[13:57.000 --> 14:13.000]  And they just roll it out and no one knows what hit them because in real war, if you're like the Nazis that invade North Africa and France and Poland and Czechoslovakia and Austria and Russia, people finally line up and fight you.
[14:13.000 --> 14:30.000]  And the Russians at first didn't like the communists. They were like, oh, you're here to save us until they thought they were being robbed and killed. Then they lined up and fought. But see, if the Nazis were smart and just flew over the airplanes and sprayed chemicals that say killed you in two or three years, by the time the Germans rolled in,
[14:30.000 --> 14:48.000]  no, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the Nazis, it's declassified in Nuremberg. They had plans. They had smarter Nazis. Same ones again with the space program we got that said we should just put chemicals in the food and water that retard them and sterilize them and have a slow economic program with a European Union.
[14:48.000 --> 14:55.000]  And then phase two, we'll get Eastern Europe to join it, and then we'll just sterilize them and poison them. But Hitler didn't want to wait.
[14:55.000 --> 15:02.000]  Junker's grandfather did. And that's why when Hitler failed, they put Junker in charge.
[15:02.000 --> 15:16.000]  And we're under the Junker plan. It doesn't matter. Junker's a drunken moron that can hardly talk now. It doesn't matter. His granddaddy wasn't and had about 180 IQ, but was purely in line with Satan.
[15:16.000 --> 15:27.000]  They had SS rituals where they would bring in the best SS men and he would personally cut their heads off so that he could then look into their eyes and connect with Lucifer.
[15:27.000 --> 15:34.000]  You think I'm joking? That's declassified. It's only in British wartime reports and a few others, but you can find it if you want.
[15:34.000 --> 15:42.000]  So remember, they want to kill you and never let you know what hit you so you can't fight back and you never know where it came from.
[15:42.000 --> 15:52.000]  All of us are already walking dead. The weapons we know about are old. They've got new ones hitting us. But I thought you deserved to know who was doing it.
[15:52.000 --> 16:18.000]  Yes, this is 21st century warfare. This is how the devil fights. Stay with us.
[16:22.000 --> 16:29.000]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[16:52.000 --> 17:04.000]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[17:04.000 --> 17:10.000]  If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[17:10.000 --> 17:21.000]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel. The Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable.
[17:21.000 --> 17:29.000]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to Minutemanstove.com. That's Minutemanstove.com.
[17:29.000 --> 17:39.000]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place. And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[17:39.000 --> 17:50.000]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in. Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[17:50.000 --> 17:58.000]  Security is a mindset, and fake TV should be part of your security solution. Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[17:58.000 --> 18:14.000]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:17.000 --> 18:26.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.000 --> 18:37.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:37.000 --> 18:51.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:51.000 --> 18:59.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[18:59.000 --> 19:10.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[19:10.000 --> 19:23.000]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body, and it supports the inflow war.
[19:23.000 --> 19:35.000]  It is a classical 360-win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[19:35.000 --> 19:52.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[19:52.000 --> 20:06.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield.
[20:22.000 --> 20:32.000]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[20:32.000 --> 20:52.000]  So real warfare is not chillerous in the 21st century. It's silent weapons for quiet wars. It's chemical, it's biological, it's cultural, it's spiritual poisoning, and it's all around you, and it's done by wicked, heartless corporations working with other heartless groups like the Chai comms,
[20:52.000 --> 21:03.000]  Yunker, and the EU to do this. And they're doing it by design. And many of their own scientists go public and try to stop it and they get killed.
[21:03.000 --> 21:15.000]  We'll say, well, I haven't you been killed because I never worked for them. And now they don't want to make me a martyr. So they're killing my name, they're killing who I am, they're destroying me, but that's okay.
[21:15.000 --> 21:30.000]  That's what people are supposed to do if you're a man. I want to get into their biggest move to silence us so we can't warn people ahead of the acceleration, the expansion of the human holocaust.
[21:30.000 --> 21:39.000]  That's about to happen. So we'll do that here in just a moment on this day before Thanksgiving 2018.
[21:39.000 --> 21:46.000]  You know, I've talked about this, but people always say, oh, the best sales of the year are on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. No, they're not.
[21:46.000 --> 21:56.000]  On average, companies just increase the price before and then lower it, and then it's artificial sale. But when we really do big sales, we tell you.
[21:56.000 --> 22:06.000]  And this sale, the one we did like a month ago was the biggest ever. This one's the biggest ever after that, because we have to sell all our inventory ahead of the years.
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  We don't have to pay taxes on it. And as you know, they're trying to take our payment processors away.
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  So I have the attitude of just, we're going to go lean and mean and not keep a bunch of stuff on inventory anymore.
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  We're just going to sell everything out and sell stuff as it comes in. So these are the best deals we've ever done.
[22:18.000 --> 22:25.000]  Black Friday, all week long, it's going on right now. You can get water filtration for 49% off.
[22:25.000 --> 22:36.000]  The Alexa Pure Pro, leading competitors are $350. They usually sell for $250. They're the best of this amount there. At $127, they're selling to us at costs.
[22:36.000 --> 22:44.000]  Give it as a great gift, infoorstore.com, infoorslife.com, store-wide free shipping, 50% off on all the supplements, up to 75% off other items.
[22:44.000 --> 22:51.000]  You know, we got a lot of great t-shirts we never promoted. And so we're selling them at costs. T-shirt costs us $6.
[22:51.000 --> 22:58.000]  We're selling it for basically that price. I mean, they're just the best deals ever.
[22:58.000 --> 23:06.000]  So thanks for your support, infoorstore.com. Take advantage of Black Friday week, right now, and infoorstore.com.
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  Okay, the time I have left here in this segment, I'm not going to be able to do this justice, but I'm going to try.
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.000]  You've got a professor, a woman from Turkey.
[23:14.000 --> 23:21.000]  Turkey's gone pure radical Islam. Coming here, part of this whole Democrat push, because I read the article saying, we're in a national crisis.
[23:21.000 --> 23:29.000]  Nationalists are taking control from us. So we got to get them off the air and we got to move past Alex Jones. We got to ban them all.
[23:29.000 --> 23:33.000]  So I'm going to read part of the article, because I never got to this a few days ago.
[23:33.000 --> 23:39.000]  He who must not be named, and notice it's a black hand pulling me into darkness. So how liberal, how loving.
[23:39.000 --> 23:45.000]  What Alex Jones and Voldemort have in common. I thought Voldemort comes from the dark and grabs people.
[23:45.000 --> 23:51.000]  See, I'm red in the image. They're kind of telling you the truth. I got red blood, like we all have. I'm angry.
[23:51.000 --> 23:58.000]  I'm red, white, and blue. Look, red, white, and blue, but the black hand is, they always tell you the truth to the subconscious.
[23:58.000 --> 24:05.000]  Subconscious being told, we're getting your ass, America. You're not going to stop us. You bet I'm fighting for my life.
[24:05.000 --> 24:10.000]  You bet. That's actually what it's like every night when I snuggle in. The entertainment begins.
[24:10.000 --> 24:17.000]  But the point is for all these witches, as she's saying, I'm the devil. I'm the devilish archetype.
[24:17.000 --> 24:26.000]  But in their own iconography, they are the devil dragging the red, white, and blue.
[24:26.000 --> 24:35.000]  The red of our blood, the blue of the nice guy of God, the whiteness of our soul. We love God. Into oblivion.
[24:35.000 --> 24:45.000]  Into us, as if we don't see. As if we don't know. They're saying, join us, or we'll take you to hell.
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  No, no, joining you takes us to hell.
[24:48.000 --> 24:58.000]  So read the disgusting, filthy article for yourself. When Alex Jones crashed the congressional hearings, looking into big tech platforms back in September, their censorship,
[24:58.000 --> 25:05.000]  Lord Voldemort kept coming to my mind. Even if you hadn't read the Harry Potter books, no, I don't read that.
[25:05.000 --> 25:13.000]  You probably know that almost no one in the wizarding world will speak the Archvillain's name aloud.
[25:13.000 --> 25:20.000]  He is referred to only as he who must not be named, or you know who.
[25:20.000 --> 25:31.000]  In the final book, Voldemort puts a curse on his name, so that merely uttering it acts like a beacon for the wizard's crew of death eaters.
[25:31.000 --> 25:43.000]  All the globalist bring his death. But now in a curse, they're telling you uttering the cure, Americonic God, what we support Alex Jones is a symbol of that.
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.000]  No, he's the devil. But Chai comes back her and the censorship.
[25:48.000 --> 25:59.000]  She goes on to say, don't worry, it's his last gasp. He desperately went to that congressional hearing and was on every channel and took over as if I can't show up to all of them as this.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  I'm not planning that. They never even saw that move. They don't even know.
[26:03.000 --> 26:11.000]  I have all these moves in place, but I'm just waiting for this to play out because it's so delicious.
[26:11.000 --> 26:18.000]  She says that it's my last gasp. Oh yeah, lady, we're really...
[26:18.000 --> 26:26.000]  I got some smart advisors that they say act like you're going down, but I just can't lie to the audience.
[26:26.000 --> 26:46.000]  This is ridiculous. Worldwide, we're annihilating these people and they've got some woman from Turkey who flees the evil and then comes here and gets taken into the deep state leftist and calls for me to be shut down and then put some intimidating image out like this and literally thinks everyone's buying into this.
[26:46.000 --> 26:58.000]  You will be my last gasp when you give up on me. I don't even care because it means we've lost. You giving up on M4s is like you giving up on yourself.
[26:58.000 --> 27:17.000]  I'm eager to communicate something crucial about the evil lord's latest plan, the evil lord's. Harry at one point blarts out Voldemort's name, Alexander Jones, Alexander Emmerich Jones, which followers are many, many scary pages.
[27:17.000 --> 27:31.000]  Jones is the kind of real world Voldemort. Oh yeah, not Henry Kissinger, not David Rockefeller, not Hillary Clinton. Speak his name to condemn his conspiracy theories and you draw more attention to his hateful ideas.
[27:31.000 --> 27:37.000]  It's like fighting fire with oxygen tanks instead of fire extinguishers.
[27:37.000 --> 27:48.000]  I'd actually fight a fire with oxygen tanks. It looks blood blood all the other oxygen and go out. The tools breathe more life into the flames.
[27:48.000 --> 27:59.000]  And she goes on to how she never mentioned me and how I always worked to be in the New York Times. This is the most sycophantic, the New York Times isn't even toilet paper.
[27:59.000 --> 28:09.000]  He's de-platformed. He's had his last gas. He's over. But we have to work and pressure the Internet to ban all other conservatives and control all information.
[28:09.000 --> 28:21.000]  I mean, she's literally the Voldemort saying an age of darkness and the press must come as the Washington Post and others say democracy dies in the dark as they try to bring the dark.
[28:21.000 --> 28:27.000]  And they just do this and it's so pathetic.
[28:27.000 --> 28:39.000]  And this is who they can get. This is the vassals they can get to carry this out. The truth is, it's not about me because I want to serve my purpose and be honorable to God so I'm a very humble person.
[28:39.000 --> 28:51.000]  You have no idea what you've done and you're so ridiculous as if my archetype is the devil. That's really funny.
[28:51.000 --> 28:58.000]  My archetype is just a farmer. But farmers fight.
[29:21.000 --> 29:38.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[29:38.000 --> 29:44.000]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[29:44.000 --> 30:00.000]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[30:00.000 --> 30:16.000]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, knew that they can food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter. And that's what I'm talking about at M4WarsTour.com.

[31:24.000 --> 31:32.000]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at my patriot supply that have developed these filters ordered a huge amount of them this year. He has a glut of them.
[31:32.000 --> 31:45.000]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249. When it's discounted, usually $200. It's $127. He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making $20-something bucks on them.
[31:45.000 --> 31:59.000]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly. This is the gift of life, the gift of health. It's amazing. Alexa Pure Pro at M4WarsLife.com or M4WarsTour.com, or call AAA-253-3139.

[33:17.000 --> 33:22.000]  Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the M4Wars.
[33:22.000 --> 33:47.000]  Well, we're right in the middle of this historic Election Day coverage. I'm Alex Jones, your host, joining us for this segment is George Papinopoulos,
[33:47.000 --> 34:03.000]  who I did say back during the time when the whole Russiagate thing started. I said he might be one of the double agents just because the story started so ridiculous that he talked to somebody connected to Russians in a bar in Italy, and then that made him a Russian agent, and he was, you know, pleading guilty or whatever.
[34:03.000 --> 34:11.000]  I said, that's asinine. He's since come out and said we know it was a setup by the leftist CIA. It's all confirmed. And indeed, he did absolutely nothing wrong.
[34:11.000 --> 34:25.000]  And they just later said, oh, do you remember that you talked to somebody for five minutes in a bar, and they brought up Russia to you. And then later when you were asked about it by Mueller, you didn't remember it.
[34:25.000 --> 34:35.000]  So we're going to get you on lying to the FBI. So I've just set the table there of what has happened. He's been totally vindicated now and he's had a lot of courage.
[34:35.000 --> 34:47.000]  George Papinopoulos formally the Trump campaign to come out and say that he was set up. So I appreciate you coming on, George. Give us your take on what's really happened. The Mueller investigation and where you see this going.
[34:47.000 --> 35:04.000]  Alex, thanks so much for hosting me. It's a real pleasure. No, you're absolutely right. Look, I think my I used to be patient zero, I guess, of the fantasy of Russian collusion. And unfortunately, I was patient zero because I had two problems.
[35:04.000 --> 35:18.000]  I couldn't talk for myself. And two, I had the New York Times and another newspapers create this fake narrative and false narrative around me that I was, you know, colluding. I was, you know, talking with Russian agents.
[35:18.000 --> 35:27.000]  I was doing all this. Now, the only problem that happened was actually the only benefit that came out of this entire story for me from when I wasn't able to talk.
[35:27.000 --> 35:39.000]  Was that everyone that the New York Times or any other newspaper dug into, for example, Joseph Mifsud, Alexander Downer, Stephen Halper, all these people, they weren't Russians at all.
[35:39.000 --> 35:45.000]  They were actually Western intelligence people. So it was really funny because, you know, I'd always get questions from various newspapers.
[35:45.000 --> 35:57.000]  Oh, can you tell us about the Russian agent, Joseph Mifsud, the professor that you just talked about? And I said, I have no real information about him because he really couldn't introduce me to anyone of substance in Russia.
[35:57.000 --> 36:08.000]  And then later on, I have all these new journalists come to me and tell me the guy was actually working with the MI6. And now his own lawyer is saying that the FBI was guiding him when he was interacting with me.
[36:08.000 --> 36:20.000]  So just to basically summarize, it's a very confusing story. In 2016, I'm on a business trip to Rome, and I meet this man named Joseph Mifsud. He's a Maltese professor.
[36:20.000 --> 36:27.000]  This professor, a month later, he drops this information on me that the Russians apparently have Hillary Clinton's emails.
[36:27.000 --> 36:34.000]  Now, I didn't understand what he was really, you know, talking. It was openly rumored that Clinton's State Department server had been hacked.
[36:34.000 --> 36:42.000]  So he drops this information on me about a week later. The Alexander Downer from the Australian embassy wants to meet with me.
[36:42.000 --> 36:50.000]  And during this meeting, he's recording me. He's asking me very strange questions. He's telling me that the Australians are watching what Trump is doing.
[36:50.000 --> 36:56.000]  The British are watching him very closely because of his support for Brexit and that he's a pariah.
[36:56.000 --> 37:06.000]  Now, this guy, I have absolutely no memory of ever talking about emails with him. Apparently he created this fake story that I talked about emails with him to justify this investigation.
[37:06.000 --> 37:14.000]  That's the current narrative. I mean, there's a lot more complicated than anybody could possibly think, but I'm just trying to lay out the groundwork.
[37:14.000 --> 37:23.000]  Let me boil it down just in 30 seconds and see if this is accurate from your own inside experience. It's very simple. They want to discredit the election of Trump.
[37:23.000 --> 37:35.000]  They want to be able to cover up their illegal spying on Trump, which has now all been confirmed. And so they had different MI6 and CIA operatives and actual agents come up and talk to different Trump people about Russians
[37:35.000 --> 37:45.000]  so that they had some type of connection to people in the Trump operation and Russians, even though they were the ones instigating it and even though you were faithful to the United States.
[37:45.000 --> 37:54.000]  That's absolutely right. To this day, I've never traveled to Russia. I've never met a Russian official. I don't have Russian friends and I don't even go to Russian restaurants.
[37:54.000 --> 38:05.000]  So this guy, this professor, he's connected to Western intelligence. He just drops this information on me like a dangle, just so that you're caught at the wrong place at the wrong time kind of thing.
[38:05.000 --> 38:15.000]  And then I had a target on me for talking to apparently a Russian agent that allowed the MI6, the CIA and obviously the FBI to follow me, follow the campaign.
[38:15.000 --> 38:24.000]  And then they use that when they're already legally spying to parallel construct and go then open the official investigation into Trump using you.
[38:24.000 --> 38:35.000]  I guess that's a story. I mean, it doesn't make any sense to me. It doesn't make sense to probably all of your listeners and probably to all of America. I mean, at this moment, America is fully behind me.
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  I'm just slowly getting this story out and everyone is just really shocked. I mean, I know you're probably shocked.
[38:40.000 --> 38:48.000]  George, I'm not shocked. I'm not at liberty to talk about it, but I reported to the FBI. They tried the same crap on me, but I instantly blew up.
[38:48.000 --> 39:00.000]  No, you have to. And that's actually, you know, I had two options. One, I could have gone off into the sunset in obscurity and just allowed and just bit my lip and allowed this story to follow me the rest of my life.
[39:00.000 --> 39:06.000]  And but then, you know what I said? Absolutely not. I need to tell America the truth because this is much bigger than just George Papadopoulos.
[39:06.000 --> 39:15.000]  You know, I'm going to have my life moving forward, no matter what. But America was always going to be duped under this fantasy that Trump was colluding or that the campaign was in the pocket of Russia.
[39:15.000 --> 39:21.000]  That's absolutely the furthest thing from the truth. Trump had nothing to do with Russia. I had nothing to do with Russia.
[39:21.000 --> 39:27.000]  And so you're Pat C1, you're patient zero, which not just you saying this, it's all been vindicated. It's all come out.
[39:27.000 --> 39:37.000]  Mueller is a known gangster, though. People he handled like, you know, the fellow that just died, the famous Irish mobster from Boston, Whitey Bulger.
[39:37.000 --> 39:46.000]  These are people you don't want to mess with. And I know you probably got threatened. Are you at liberty to get into what it was like when Mueller who delivered uranium to the Russians on tarmacs?
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.000]  The real agent when he was breathing down your neck, what that was like?
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.000]  No, I can't get into anything specific about my interactions with the FBI or Mueller himself.
[39:55.000 --> 40:04.000]  But, you know, all I can really focus on at the moment is just all the characters around that led me to be, I guess, involved in this because I think that's the real problem.
[40:04.000 --> 40:11.000]  You know, I think the lead up, the setup that created this mess that we're all in right now, I think that's the most important thing.
[40:11.000 --> 40:17.000]  And I think those people who are responsible are the Obama DOJ, the Obama State Department of the Obama CIA.
[40:17.000 --> 40:25.000]  So those are the people that need to get back in front of Congress. And I think Congress needs to ask absolutely new questions.
[40:25.000 --> 40:33.000]  Now the new revelations about my story has come out just so that, you know, America has a much more clear picture of what they were doing and why they were trying to set me up in the campaign.
[40:33.000 --> 40:40.000]  Wow. What's your gut level or any of your contacts thinking that Mueller's going to try next?
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.000]  Because he's not just leaking that he wants to indict Stone with no evidence.
[40:45.000 --> 40:51.000]  They're also at the grand jury and over 50 people asking about me. That's another reason I know how fake this is.
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.000]  I have zero connection to the Russians.
[40:54.000 --> 41:05.000]  Look, I have no idea what anything in the future is going to be. All I know is even though it's a risk, many people are telling me it's a risk of me going out and talking about my situation.
[41:05.000 --> 41:13.000]  For me, the real, you know, jail sentence, a life sentence actually would be if I had lived in this notoriety as a traitor to my country.
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.000]  That's something I wasn't going to allow to happen. So that's all I could say about that.
[41:18.000 --> 41:26.000]  Well, I appreciate what you've done. It's obvious you did nothing from the beginning. That's why I was saying, why are you at first going along with it when you did absolutely nothing?
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.000]  The guy talked to you and then told you about some Russian stuff that was already public news.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  And I mean, clearly now you're coming out against him. You're speaking out. You've been vindicated. You weren't the mole.
[41:35.000 --> 41:41.000]  We know who some of the moles are now. In fact, when I said maybe you're the mole, I did get contacted by people that are really insiders.
[41:41.000 --> 41:47.000]  They said, no, it's not George Papadopoulos. It's not him. And they told me who the moles were.
[41:47.000 --> 41:53.000]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I was, you know, let's just say that I know of one myself. I can't talk about it publicly yet.
[41:53.000 --> 42:02.000]  I think Congress probably is going to disclose that in a future time. But if I knew of one and, you know, you're talking about certain, there are probably many, many in the campaign.
[42:02.000 --> 42:08.000]  I mean, there were many eyes around in 2016 and they weren't there to help Trump.
[42:08.000 --> 42:16.000]  I mean, I think they were really there to keep a close eye on him to make sure that they had him under a thumb if he was elected president.
[42:16.000 --> 42:24.000]  And to sabotage this campaign, you know, if he was elected president as well so that he wouldn't face the problems he's facing today.
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.000]  But the guy is, he's vindicated. I mean, he has tremendous support by the American people and he's doing great.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.000]  And I just implore all Americans to vote red today.
[42:33.000 --> 42:39.000]  Absolutely. George Papadopoulos, I know you've got to go. You said maybe you could do two segments. Let's just do a half a segment.
[42:39.000 --> 42:47.000]  You're a smart political cookie. I want to come back and just briefly get your take on the election, what's at stake, and more. It's a George Papa 19 on Twitter.
[42:47.000 --> 42:52.000]  Twitter at George Papa 19, but directly there to get what's really happening, not what they say about George.
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.000]  And this takes a lot of courage, folks, going up against Mueller. After what he's been through, this guy is really proving his salt.
[42:58.000 --> 43:06.000]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment from the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[43:06.000 --> 43:11.000]  that it lowers IQ. It literally dumbs the population down.
[43:11.000 --> 43:17.000]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[43:17.000 --> 43:24.000]  The first seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[43:24.000 --> 43:30.000]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible.
[43:30.000 --> 43:37.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[43:37.000 --> 43:46.000]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[43:46.000 --> 43:51.000]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[43:55.000 --> 44:00.000]  X3, now available at M4sLife.com.
[44:25.000 --> 44:30.000]  I just now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[44:30.000 --> 44:38.000]  I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[44:38.000 --> 44:44.000]  I want to push all the way. I've committed to do that. I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[44:44.000 --> 44:51.000]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this, I will never falter, I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[44:51.000 --> 45:00.000]  I physically will, but I give you my commitment if you financially support us at InfowarsStore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[45:00.000 --> 45:08.000]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[45:08.000 --> 45:14.000]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day,
[45:14.000 --> 45:20.000]  but thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[45:20.000 --> 45:26.000]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water,
[45:26.000 --> 45:34.000]  to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive,
[45:34.000 --> 45:40.000]  to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[45:40.000 --> 45:48.000]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone. This is actually our last run of SuperMailVitality.
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.000]  So I want you to experience SuperMailVitality before it's too late.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  Unleash the SuperMail in you.
