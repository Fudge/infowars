[00:00.000 --> 00:14.800]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:14.800 --> 00:19.400]  Breaking news out of Silicon Valley, Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy
[00:19.400 --> 00:21.280]  theorists and alt-right figures.
[00:21.280 --> 00:25.120]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[00:25.120 --> 00:29.200]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[00:29.200 --> 00:34.640]  Taking steps to enforce its hate-speak policies, Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph
[00:34.640 --> 00:42.680]  Watson, Lewis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all of them were designated dangerous individuals.
[00:42.680 --> 00:43.680]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:43.680 --> 00:44.680]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:44.680 --> 00:45.680]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:45.680 --> 00:46.680]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:46.680 --> 00:47.680]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:47.680 --> 00:48.680]  And organizations.
[00:48.680 --> 00:49.680]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[00:49.680 --> 00:50.680]  Danger.
[00:50.680 --> 00:51.680]  Well, Robinson.
[00:51.680 --> 00:52.680]  Danger.
[00:52.680 --> 00:53.680]  They call me dangerous.
[00:53.680 --> 00:54.680]  Danger is my middle name.
[00:54.680 --> 00:59.120]  Dangerous like hurting other people, or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg
[00:59.120 --> 01:00.120]  doesn't like.
[01:00.120 --> 01:04.600]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[01:04.600 --> 01:06.360]  How dangerous is Infowars?
[01:06.360 --> 01:10.880]  What is the difference, right, at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and Infowars.com?
[01:10.880 --> 01:13.520]  Infowars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[01:13.520 --> 01:15.720]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[01:15.720 --> 01:18.320]  Infowars' content is useful to him.
[01:18.320 --> 01:20.640]  Infowars' personalities align with him.
[01:20.640 --> 01:21.800]  I want them shut down.
[01:21.800 --> 01:22.800]  I want them silenced.
[01:22.800 --> 01:23.800]  I want them muted.
[01:23.800 --> 01:25.520]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:25.520 --> 01:27.240]  I want them shut down.
[01:27.240 --> 01:28.520]  I want them silenced.
[01:28.520 --> 01:29.520]  I want them muted.
[01:29.520 --> 01:33.320]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal view.
[01:33.320 --> 01:39.040]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery services aren't
[01:39.040 --> 01:43.360]  highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content,
[01:43.360 --> 01:49.080]  and we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist, primarily to violate
[01:49.080 --> 01:52.240]  our policies or to do things that are dangerous.
[01:52.240 --> 01:56.880]  Through your rules, your rules go against our values, and they are patently un-American.
[01:56.880 --> 02:01.760]  Chuck Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions, he's prescribing which political
[02:01.760 --> 02:04.080]  opinions you're allowed to have.
[02:04.080 --> 02:06.680]  We need a digital bill of rights.
[02:06.680 --> 02:10.560]  They're becoming the public square, and they control how we interact with each other.
[02:10.560 --> 02:14.120]  And if you think that you're going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private
[02:14.120 --> 02:17.720]  companies, you are absolutely insane, and you are part of the problem.
[02:17.720 --> 02:18.720]  You are a bad person.
[02:18.720 --> 02:19.720]  You should be censored off the internet.
[02:19.720 --> 02:20.720]  Bad, yes.
[02:20.720 --> 02:21.720]  Bad.
[02:21.720 --> 02:22.720]  Get out of here, Alex.
[02:22.720 --> 02:26.160]  Infowars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over
[02:26.160 --> 02:27.520]  at Trump's Twitter feed.
[02:27.520 --> 02:33.280]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to
[02:33.280 --> 02:36.280]  say, that Infowars president.
[02:36.280 --> 03:02.280]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:02.280 --> 03:12.920]  While I was just sitting here, getting ready to go live, watching that little intro piece
[03:12.920 --> 03:17.080]  of some of the attacks of the last week, it just hit me.
[03:17.080 --> 03:26.680]  If I was sitting in a movie theater 10 years ago watching, say, a movie like Minority Report,
[03:26.680 --> 03:32.640]  that would be an image of a dystopic future where the good guy's been accused of being
[03:32.640 --> 03:39.720]  a terrorist and he's on the run and they're announcing on the news he's a dangerous individual.
[03:39.720 --> 03:43.080]  Call police immediately if you see them.
[03:43.080 --> 03:45.360]  But that's just what they're doing now.
[03:45.360 --> 03:50.960]  And if it sounds familiar, that's because movies like Minority Report were based on
[03:50.960 --> 03:53.160]  systems already being developed and planned.
[03:53.160 --> 03:59.400]  And it's been not the chronic surveillance crib.
[03:59.400 --> 04:04.520]  And always they've had posters up, wanted dead or alive, dangerous, kill on site.
[04:04.520 --> 04:08.600]  And you hear about conservatives that are banned from social media, it's a lifetime
[04:08.600 --> 04:09.600]  ban.
[04:09.600 --> 04:12.320]  It's worse than what a murderer gets.
[04:12.320 --> 04:15.480]  So it's that idea that you're the worst of the worst.
[04:15.480 --> 04:19.120]  And when Facebook put their press release out a week and a half ago against me, they
[04:19.120 --> 04:25.840]  said, for Alex Jones, we reserve the highest level of anyone, of a dangerous person, and
[04:25.840 --> 04:32.640]  they gave the designation, it's an inner poll designation for convicted weapons smugglers,
[04:32.640 --> 04:36.840]  narcotics traffickers, sex traffickers and pedophiles.
[04:36.840 --> 04:43.600]  I told you last year, I was listed by the International Banking Association as a terrorist.
[04:43.600 --> 04:44.600]  I've got to sue them.
[04:44.600 --> 04:49.720]  So take a lot of money, but this is the world system coming after everybody.
[04:49.720 --> 04:53.240]  So it's not like they're just adopting criminal terminology.
[04:53.240 --> 04:57.240]  This is criminal terminology by criminals, saying those of us that aren't criminals
[04:57.240 --> 05:01.400]  are the criminals.
[05:01.400 --> 05:05.920]  Getting your protein has never been easier with InfoWars Life Protein Bars.

[06:25.200 --> 06:41.280]  Well, TV viewers can see it, radio listeners, I'll give you the numbers.
[06:41.280 --> 06:51.960]  Dow Jones Industrial Average Down 2.29 for almost 600 points at 594.91.
[06:51.960 --> 07:03.360]  It is Monday, May 13, 2019, I'm your host, Alex Jones, and this is The Forbidden Broadcast,
[07:03.360 --> 07:04.360]  The Verbotant.
[07:04.360 --> 07:09.080]  You're not supposed to tune in here with the real show saying you're supposed to get
[07:09.080 --> 07:16.880]  all the disinformation and the strawman that they build on international media, national
[07:16.880 --> 07:21.160]  media, local media, that all read off the exact same script.
[07:21.160 --> 07:29.120]  I was on undoubtedly the biggest TV show in Turkey today, and it's on their RT equivalent.
[07:29.120 --> 07:35.760]  It's aired in every major continent, it's on U.S. cable systems, you name it.
[07:35.760 --> 07:41.600]  And it was like Hillary Clinton or Media Matters had written the script, of course they have.
[07:41.600 --> 07:47.160]  They have PR firms hired, they have them engaged, law firms, they put these points out and they
[07:47.160 --> 07:52.880]  encourage media, controlled media, state-run media in this case, of the dictator Erdogan
[07:52.880 --> 07:56.800]  to put this out, and it was a powerful interview.
[07:56.800 --> 08:01.240]  They're supposed to interview me for 10 minutes, they interviewed me for 30.
[08:01.240 --> 08:05.480]  And so I bet when it airs in a couple hours, they edit the living, you know what, out of
[08:05.480 --> 08:07.320]  it, but guess what?
[08:07.320 --> 08:12.200]  I told them right when it started that I was taping it, they weren't listening to me,
[08:12.200 --> 08:13.200]  but I told them.
[08:13.200 --> 08:21.040]  And so we have the whole thing plus behind the scenes just for you.
[08:21.040 --> 08:25.600]  But it's supposedly going to air in a couple hours, Turkey time, usually it's a live show
[08:25.600 --> 08:29.640]  but they wouldn't dare have me on there live, they need to be able to edit it, of course.
[08:29.640 --> 08:36.880]  And so we're going to release the unedited video except for one thing, it'll be unedited
[08:36.880 --> 08:44.440]  into end, none of it will be cut out, including my countdown, testing my audio, but it'll
[08:44.440 --> 08:49.640]  have a few minutes added where when he laughs at me and says there are no gay frogs, I'll
[08:49.640 --> 08:56.240]  cut to PBS and I'll cut to Scientific American and Atrazine, and when he makes jokes about
[08:56.240 --> 09:00.760]  Robert Mueller protecting Jeffrey Epstein, and that whole scandal, we'll just show the
[09:00.760 --> 09:02.440]  Miami Herald.
[09:02.440 --> 09:05.520]  See how that works, see how that works?
[09:05.520 --> 09:10.880]  Look, I know it's crazy that upwards of half the frogs in this country are sterile or attracted
[09:10.880 --> 09:16.680]  to the same sex, and so frog populations are plunging here and all over the world.
[09:16.680 --> 09:25.520]  I know that it's hard to believe, I get it, I get it, but still it's the reality.
[09:25.520 --> 09:26.520]  It's crazy.
[09:26.520 --> 09:33.720]  A federal judge just overturned the protection that a U.S. Attorney gave Epstein and a bunch
[09:33.720 --> 09:39.480]  of his people on a plea bargain a decade ago, and you know who was involved, Mueller was
[09:39.480 --> 09:48.120]  the handler of Epstein, and I know people like, well, Mueller is like Jesus Christ, actually.
[09:48.120 --> 09:54.040]  I mean, he's pure as a graven snow, yeah, he protected Whitey Bolger from the beginning.
[09:54.040 --> 10:02.920]  I mean, the guy is as dirty as a porta potty.
[10:02.920 --> 10:07.080]  In fact, it's dirtier, I think, and then I pointed out, the word is Mueller doesn't have
[10:07.080 --> 10:11.360]  sex with underage girls, he just has Epstein go around and set everybody up.
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.880]  People are like, well, Mueller has people kill, he's a gangster, you better watch out.
[10:15.880 --> 10:19.400]  I've already been threatened, folks.
[10:19.400 --> 10:21.840]  Somebody's got to not care.
[10:21.840 --> 10:25.880]  Somebody's got to stop pulling punches.
[10:25.880 --> 10:31.080]  Somebody's got to say, you want to play chicken, I just rammed my foot down on the accelerator
[10:31.080 --> 10:36.240]  and turned on the nitrous oxide, here we go, baby.
[10:36.240 --> 10:41.760]  I'm from Texas, bitch, there's still some Texas left, and ain't nobody seen the backs
[10:41.760 --> 10:44.600]  of the Texans yet.
[10:44.600 --> 10:51.400]  You ain't seeing my back ever, so get used to it, and it ain't hard either, you got it.
[10:51.400 --> 10:53.840]  I've got to control myself.
[10:53.840 --> 11:01.920]  I love this fight like a pig loves pumpkin pie.
[11:01.920 --> 11:02.920]  Animating contest of liberty.
[11:02.920 --> 11:03.920]  Okay, let me tell you what's coming up.
[11:03.920 --> 11:10.280]  This is one hell of a transmission today.
[11:10.280 --> 11:15.480]  I told you, Trump's going to war, because the country's almost gone.
[11:15.480 --> 11:18.160]  We don't have much time.
[11:18.160 --> 11:22.880]  Desperate times call for desperate measures, and call for taking the gluvies off to little
[11:22.880 --> 11:25.320]  global snubbles.
[11:25.320 --> 11:33.440]  And Trump and his droogies are going to be out singing in the rain, and it's going to
[11:33.440 --> 11:37.920]  be the establishment that's going to be the victim of the old in-out.
[11:37.920 --> 11:43.000]  So put that in your little pipey, wipey, and smoky-wokey.
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.920]  Supreme Court deals Apple a major setback in App Store antitrust case.
[11:47.920 --> 11:52.520]  Yes, they've been abusing and not letting their competition in, and they've been gouging
[11:52.520 --> 11:55.920]  people, and they've been taking people's money for apps that work, and then denying
[11:55.920 --> 11:56.920]  it.
[11:56.920 --> 12:00.640]  They've been acting like a bunch of slat-jawed thugs.
[12:00.640 --> 12:08.800]  Oh, Tim Cook, a nice little boy, oh, Tim Cookie-Wookie.
[12:08.800 --> 12:15.360]  He said last year in Beijing at a speech, he welcomed censorship, and he supports what
[12:15.360 --> 12:21.920]  China's doing, and he supports Western governments censoring more as well.
[12:21.920 --> 12:25.560]  Talk about lowering the drawbridge.
[12:25.560 --> 12:28.000]  Talk about trying to rape freedom.
[12:28.000 --> 12:35.960]  Well, you've been running a monopoly for quite a while there, buddy boy, and this signals
[12:35.960 --> 12:46.320]  the Supreme Court's going to carve up big tech monopolies real nice.
[12:46.320 --> 12:53.400]  To quote Tony Montana for a green card.
[12:53.400 --> 13:00.240]  I kill the communists for fun, but for a green card, I carve them up real good, and we don't
[13:00.240 --> 13:06.520]  mean politically, we mean legislatively, which is the same as politically.
[13:06.520 --> 13:08.360]  We don't mean violently.
[13:08.360 --> 13:12.840]  We would never wish any harm against the man that runs the biggest slave camps in the world
[13:12.840 --> 13:17.600]  in China with suicide nets around them that are scientifically designed to humanize to
[13:17.600 --> 13:23.960]  the maximum level of evil and pay the lowest wage possible, but because he lifts and hops
[13:23.960 --> 13:28.320]  around and goes, I'm gay, I'm gay, I'm gay, I'm gay.
[13:28.320 --> 13:32.960]  It's like, oh, you're gay, oh, oh, good then.
[13:32.960 --> 13:37.960]  So that's going on.
[13:37.960 --> 13:38.960]  There's a lot more to cover.
[13:38.960 --> 13:39.960]  We'll get into it all and come back.
[13:39.960 --> 13:44.440]  But, you know, I got to be a little bit better about this because I've got to sue this big
[13:44.440 --> 13:48.440]  international banking organization that's listed myself and Paul and others as terrorists
[13:48.440 --> 13:49.440]  illegally.
[13:49.440 --> 13:52.600]  Oh, you can argue all day you're a private company and censor people.
[13:52.600 --> 13:55.480]  Can you list folks as terrorists who don't have any criminal records?
[13:55.480 --> 13:56.800]  We'll see how you like it.
[13:56.800 --> 13:57.800]  It's going to take money.
[13:57.800 --> 14:01.840]  It's going to take some PIs, but we'll skin these cats real good.
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.320]  There are a bunch of cowards that like an old barn when a tornado comes through falls
[14:06.320 --> 14:07.320]  right over.
[14:07.320 --> 14:15.560]  You could piss on this barn and fall over, but I need money to wage war for all of us.
[14:15.560 --> 14:21.000]  And I make it easy with the products we've got at infowarstore.com.
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.520]  And I told you, we've got X2, the purest iodine out there.
[14:24.520 --> 14:29.080]  If you don't know that iodine deficiency and why it's most the public acts and behaves
[14:29.080 --> 14:33.480]  like drooling mindless zombies, the globalists make damn sure you don't get it in your diet
[14:33.480 --> 14:37.560]  because it turns you into a servile coward.
[14:37.560 --> 14:41.240]  Find out what the good stuff does and go the opposite direction.
[14:41.240 --> 14:45.520]  The globalists with X2 now available again by the grace of God.
[14:45.520 --> 14:48.640]  Very hard to get the deep red crystals and a free bottle of X3 that's tri-iodine.
[14:48.640 --> 14:52.200]  And I think in many ways even better, but folks like the original.
[14:52.200 --> 14:59.160]  So you want it, anything you want, you got it, anything at all, babe.
[14:59.160 --> 15:00.160]  You got it.
[15:00.160 --> 15:04.640]  So you talk about a pretty woman walking down the street, pretty woman the kind you'd like
[15:04.640 --> 15:05.640]  to meet.
[15:05.640 --> 15:08.120]  X2 is that pretty lady you want to meet.
[15:08.120 --> 15:16.120]  And it also funds fire breathing, committed operation that doesn't back down, that doesn't
[15:16.120 --> 15:18.720]  give in, but could give out.
[15:18.720 --> 15:26.080]  So put power in our legs and our hearts, get stuff you already need, it's a win-win.

[16:58.880 --> 17:04.280]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[17:04.280 --> 17:05.280]  the world.
[17:05.280 --> 17:08.280]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:08.280 --> 17:14.240]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:14.240 --> 17:18.040]  As former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire.
[17:18.040 --> 17:19.040]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:19.040 --> 17:20.600]  Who do we fight for?
[17:20.600 --> 17:27.160]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available
[17:27.160 --> 17:29.480]  at Amazon Books.
[17:29.480 --> 17:34.520]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com.
[17:34.520 --> 17:38.480]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to lead

[19:26.440 --> 19:27.560]  I'm not the leader.

[19:54.520 --> 19:56.520]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[19:56.520 --> 20:03.520]  God bless you.
[20:03.520 --> 20:20.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:20.800 --> 20:37.920]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[20:37.920 --> 20:43.760]  We're going in, through, and beyond.
[20:43.760 --> 20:48.600]  You already passed the event horizon with no turning back.
[20:48.600 --> 20:57.800]  You're now in it, at magical time in history, where everything is on fire, where there's
[20:57.800 --> 21:02.200]  the shining to everything.
[21:02.200 --> 21:05.520]  Time of great changes upon us.
[21:05.520 --> 21:08.360]  The shining is here.
[21:08.360 --> 21:09.560]  Get ready.
[21:09.560 --> 21:19.560]  The next decade will decide the future of humanity forever.
[21:19.560 --> 21:26.200]  All right, let's get back into the main story here.
[21:26.200 --> 21:34.840]  Little birdies, and all the evidence that's public, says that Trump has a decent Supreme
[21:34.840 --> 21:39.120]  Court that's about to get even better.
[21:39.120 --> 21:46.160]  And big tech has been arrogantly running around under Obama, moving to China, refusing
[21:46.160 --> 21:50.840]  to work with the Pentagon, selling all of our data, spying on Congress.
[21:50.840 --> 21:55.880]  To the point of, a year ago, big tech wouldn't even go to Congress.
[21:55.880 --> 21:57.720]  Not even their presidents.
[21:57.720 --> 22:06.640]  They'd send a vice president to shovel lies at Congress, under oath, in an orgy of unparalleled
[22:06.640 --> 22:10.680]  perjury.
[22:10.680 --> 22:19.520]  But then, when Congress got halfway awake on their little addled power trip, suddenly
[22:19.520 --> 22:28.600]  Sundar, Pachai, and all the rest of them did their little purple walk into Congress, and
[22:28.600 --> 22:36.920]  of course, I was waiting like a barracuda on the arrogant, smiley-faced delusionals
[22:36.920 --> 22:39.840]  who believe in their technological terror.
[22:39.840 --> 22:45.560]  Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
[22:45.560 --> 22:51.440]  But they couldn't even find the meeting room door, despite their omnipresent power.
[22:51.440 --> 22:57.240]  It's one thing to have quasi-omnipresence with everyone, feeding you where they're going,
[22:57.240 --> 22:59.200]  what they're doing, what they're dreaming.
[22:59.200 --> 23:05.360]  But how does one such as yourself, who's not God, read that information?
[23:05.360 --> 23:09.000]  Oh, you await on the algorithm.
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.640]  Yes, it will tell you how to read it.
[23:12.640 --> 23:14.120]  Sure it will.
[23:14.120 --> 23:16.520]  That's another good one, isn't it?
[23:16.520 --> 23:19.680]  No, these are not Godmen.
[23:19.680 --> 23:22.440]  They project their own hatred of themselves upon us.
[23:22.440 --> 23:29.760]  So the Silicon Valley religion is that we are the profane, and that soon humans will
[23:29.760 --> 23:38.000]  be extinct so that whatever bizarre entity they're talking to will give them this benighted
[23:38.000 --> 23:45.920]  power to merge with the silicon and be ethereal forever and enter the atmospheres of the galaxies.
[23:45.920 --> 23:47.920]  Yeah, right, sure.
[23:47.920 --> 23:51.160]  That makes a lot of sense, huh?
[23:51.160 --> 23:55.640]  Betray your mother, betray your father, betray your ancestors, betray who you are, betray
[23:55.640 --> 24:03.840]  who could build this, and then say you piss upon it in some bizarre act of hate, not honoring
[24:03.840 --> 24:06.560]  your father and mother?
[24:06.560 --> 24:12.760]  Yes, they're losers.
[24:12.760 --> 24:22.280]  And so now the Supreme Court prepares to dismember Big Tech.
[24:22.280 --> 24:35.720]  And there will be a giant throng of crows and carrion buzzards and other foul eaters
[24:35.720 --> 24:48.040]  of rotten flesh who will fill the skies with their hooting and hollering over how these
[24:48.040 --> 24:56.680]  giant rotting, fetted, twisted, drugged out, arrogant systems should be chopped up and
[24:56.680 --> 25:08.520]  delivered, steaming with flies and maggots into their mouths.
[25:08.520 --> 25:09.600]  Think about that.
[25:09.600 --> 25:22.440]  And no amount of whatever Tim cooks on with those big old meth eyeballs will ever put
[25:22.440 --> 25:24.120]  him back together again.
[25:24.120 --> 25:29.360]  Isn't that just perfect about the left, how they always run the worst factories?
[25:29.360 --> 25:32.000]  They always treat their employees the worst.
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.840]  They always are running the biggest scams.
[25:33.840 --> 25:36.640]  They're always not paying taxes and are totally ruthless.
[25:36.640 --> 25:43.800]  But it's okay because they are liberal and they told you so.
[25:43.800 --> 25:53.240]  So you must do what they say or they will hurt you.
[25:53.240 --> 25:58.120]  So it's this country and its technology and its ideas that allowed them to get this told
[25:58.120 --> 26:04.400]  and they stole what we built and ran off to tyrants where they could, quote, be themselves
[26:04.400 --> 26:07.040]  in China.
[26:07.040 --> 26:12.240]  And they think that they will recreate all that here and bring back that here and they're
[26:12.240 --> 26:14.040]  trying to implement it.
[26:14.040 --> 26:16.240]  And the question is, will we accept it?
[26:16.240 --> 26:23.400]  Well, it's really good news that the Supreme Court has said you don't let your competition
[26:23.400 --> 26:25.240]  on your platform.
[26:25.240 --> 26:30.480]  You're trying to create a limited internet that people stay on that isn't an open free
[26:30.480 --> 26:35.840]  market and you discriminate against people and you turn them back for all these reasons
[26:35.840 --> 26:39.560]  and what you're doing is very, very dangerous.
[26:39.560 --> 26:43.400]  And you're helping China build a censored search engine and censored apps.
[26:43.400 --> 26:45.960]  That's what Google and that's what Apple are doing.
[26:45.960 --> 26:47.840]  They failed the test.
[26:47.840 --> 26:54.400]  They jumped in bed with the truest Satan the planet has ever seen.
[26:54.400 --> 27:03.720]  There's no dear, sweeter, more real Satan than Tim Cook's sweet Satan, China.
[27:03.720 --> 27:05.520]  Nobody kills more.
[27:05.520 --> 27:06.960]  Nobody's colder.
[27:06.960 --> 27:08.640]  Nobody hurts more children.
[27:08.640 --> 27:10.560]  Nobody sells organs like they do.
[27:10.560 --> 27:12.600]  Nobody kills Christians.
[27:12.600 --> 27:14.280]  Nobody kills Buddhist.
[27:14.280 --> 27:16.680]  Nobody tortures like the Chai Khoms do.
[27:16.680 --> 27:21.600]  They'd make Hitler blush and suck his thumb and get in a fetal position and pee pee on
[27:21.600 --> 27:27.440]  himself because he just would be so enamored with something that evil.
[27:27.440 --> 27:29.680]  He knows his mommy when he sees it.
[27:29.680 --> 27:37.000]  Hitler, if he was alive today, would be hanging off the hind tit of China.
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.000]  Think about that.
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  But see, Hitler's not around.
[27:41.000 --> 27:49.280]  Instead, it's a flaming tyrant, Tim Cook, hopping around obviously on synthetic high-tech
[27:49.280 --> 27:50.280]  drugs.
[27:50.280 --> 27:54.160]  Every time he's in a video, show that video from his interview with Vice, that there are
[27:54.160 --> 27:56.520]  no irises.
[27:56.520 --> 27:58.520]  It's nothing but pupils.
[27:58.520 --> 28:04.720]  Everything's fine, Alex Jones is evil, get rid of him.
[28:04.720 --> 28:06.200]  He's kind of stumbling up the table.
[28:06.200 --> 28:08.200]  Hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[28:08.200 --> 28:23.320]  It's curation, I'm curating, I decide what you see and read.
[28:23.320 --> 28:27.080]  Someday I could be a real boy.
[28:27.080 --> 28:29.080]  Someday I could do it.
[28:29.080 --> 28:32.760]  I've been a good servant of evil a long time.
[28:32.760 --> 28:40.840]  I can handle the dosages I'm taking, it's all under control.
[28:40.840 --> 28:46.400]  My God tells me to kill more people, I'm sorry, oh God, not that, China's good, China, please
[28:46.400 --> 28:47.400]  help me.
[28:47.400 --> 28:48.400]  All right, nothing about that.
[28:48.400 --> 28:50.400]  The antitrust is coming.
[28:50.400 --> 28:51.400]  Coming.
[28:51.400 --> 28:56.920]  Why did the Japanese attack us at Pearl Harbor, why did Hitler invade Europe, why did Big
[28:56.920 --> 28:59.920]  Tech censor, oh, we've got to do something now.
[28:59.920 --> 29:04.920]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[29:04.920 --> 29:08.720]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[29:08.720 --> 29:13.560]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[29:13.560 --> 29:17.120]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.600]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[29:21.600 --> 29:22.600]  across America.

[31:56.600 --> 32:05.760]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that
[32:05.760 --> 32:13.600]  there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[32:13.600 --> 32:21.060]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians
[32:21.060 --> 32:25.920]  like the Young Turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[32:25.920 --> 32:27.840]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[32:27.840 --> 32:33.680]  They don't want us to remember what political action did and that's why the globalist Hillary
[32:33.680 --> 32:36.300]  and others are trying to shut Infowars down.
[32:36.300 --> 32:41.360]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very
[32:41.360 --> 32:42.800]  sovereignty away.
[32:42.800 --> 32:45.080]  This country is in a war.
[32:45.080 --> 32:48.920]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't
[32:48.920 --> 32:52.240]  spread the articles and videos and if you don't financially get the great products we have
[32:52.240 --> 32:56.840]  to fund us, in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water, I'm in your hands, you're in my
[32:56.840 --> 33:03.520]  hands, InfowarsStore.com, thank you.
[33:03.520 --> 33:11.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:11.640 --> 33:16.920]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:16.920 --> 33:23.000]  The Supreme Court has ruled against Apple in an app store antitrust case.
[33:23.000 --> 33:24.000]  Apple shares are down.
[33:24.000 --> 33:28.440]  Last time I looked more than 5%, we have reached out to Apple for a comment, but we have not
[33:28.440 --> 33:29.440]  heard back yet.
[33:29.440 --> 33:34.480]  Now consumers are accusing Apple of monopolizing the market for iPhone software apps and forcing
[33:34.480 --> 33:35.480]  them to overpay.
[33:35.480 --> 33:41.120]  Now remember, the EU is also reportedly getting ready to launch a formal antitrust investigation
[33:41.120 --> 33:46.000]  against Apple following Spotify's official complaint, which complains that Apple uses
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.720]  its app store to stifle innovation and limit consumer choice.
[33:49.720 --> 33:54.520]  So guys, a lot of pressure right now on Apple in terms of antitrust and the role it plays
[33:54.520 --> 33:55.920]  and its app store plays.
[33:55.920 --> 33:56.920]  Back over to you.
[33:56.920 --> 34:01.440]  I just want to make sure I have this perfectly correct.
[34:01.440 --> 34:07.240]  This is the Supreme Court allowing consumers to pursue this lawsuit against an alleged
[34:07.240 --> 34:08.240]  illegal monopoly.
[34:08.240 --> 34:12.760]  It's not the Supreme Court saying that there is a monopoly.
[34:12.760 --> 34:13.960]  That's correct, Morgan.
[34:13.960 --> 34:21.440]  It is allowing consumers to look into this, basically saying that they can look into the
[34:21.440 --> 34:40.360]  fact that Apple may be monopolizing the market for iPhone software apps.
[34:40.360 --> 34:46.080]  I'm Tim Cook, and I approve of this nightmare.
[34:46.080 --> 34:49.160]  Tim Cook chose the wrong side.
[34:49.160 --> 34:54.640]  Tim Cook chose the China and the soulless energy of death.
[34:54.640 --> 34:57.160]  He failed the republicans.
[34:57.160 --> 35:00.040]  He failed the new Atlantis.
[35:00.040 --> 35:02.480]  He failed the vision.
[35:02.480 --> 35:18.840]  And now, Tim Cook will pay.
[35:18.840 --> 35:20.080]  People ask, how am I doing?
[35:20.080 --> 35:21.760]  Man, I'm doing really good.
[35:21.760 --> 35:24.040]  I'm right where I'm supposed to be in the thick of the fight.
[35:24.040 --> 35:30.080]  It's not fun sometimes getting persecuted a lot about, but I bet everything on you.
[35:30.080 --> 35:32.680]  I've been betting on you my whole life.
[35:32.680 --> 35:33.680]  You know what?
[35:33.680 --> 35:38.120]  We're winning together because you've been betting on me, and that's what's so exciting
[35:38.120 --> 35:39.600]  about the reality of this.
[35:39.600 --> 35:45.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about outlaw country, I wouldn't end outlaw country when
[35:45.360 --> 35:47.840]  I was a little kid because it was called outlaw country.
[35:47.840 --> 35:50.560]  I liked Whalen Jennings.
[35:50.560 --> 35:52.720]  I liked Willie Nelson.
[35:52.720 --> 35:55.960]  I liked Chris Christofferson.
[35:55.960 --> 36:05.040]  I liked people like that, Merle Haggard, you name it.
[36:05.040 --> 36:08.120]  You know, I could say that Johnny Cash was outlaw country, but he came along before that.
[36:08.120 --> 36:11.080]  He kind of started it without calling it that.
[36:11.080 --> 36:14.320]  But they just got in trouble because they didn't kiss everybody's butt in Nashville,
[36:14.320 --> 36:21.920]  and they weren't hypocrites, and admitted sometimes they smoked a little marijuana.
[36:21.920 --> 36:28.360]  And they like to do stuff out of places like Austin, Texas, and Luckenbach, Texas.
[36:28.360 --> 36:31.440]  You know, a lot of folks did like him because they were outlaw.
[36:31.440 --> 36:33.360]  Let me just tell you something right now, folks.
[36:33.360 --> 36:37.280]  You don't get more outlaw than him for worse.
[36:37.280 --> 36:41.880]  You don't get more outlaw than Trump against the whole power structure, getting control
[36:41.880 --> 36:46.280]  of the federal government barely and delivering so much, and the whole freak out against him.
[36:46.280 --> 36:49.840]  That's how you know he's for real.
[36:49.840 --> 36:54.000]  And then he's not part of their power structure.
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.640]  They project onto him how they are and think, oh, my God, what could they do if they were
[36:57.640 --> 36:58.720]  in power?
[36:58.720 --> 37:03.320]  But Trump keeps doing what I think he'd do if he was a good guy.
[37:03.320 --> 37:07.240]  And they are crapping their britches up one side and down the other right now, ladies and
[37:07.240 --> 37:08.240]  gentlemen.
[37:08.240 --> 37:14.600]  But this is an outlaw country where we say stuff like, I like to ride my horse and shoot
[37:14.600 --> 37:16.680]  my gun.
[37:16.680 --> 37:21.040]  You know, a country boy or a child boy's work just ain't ever done, to quote Hank Williams
[37:21.040 --> 37:25.760]  Jr., but I also like to have women I've never had.
[37:25.760 --> 37:29.840]  You know, people can listen to that and go, that's not very pro-family, but I mean, that's
[37:29.840 --> 37:32.920]  just Hank Williams Jr. being honest about how he is.
[37:32.920 --> 37:35.640]  Okay, that's a little outlaw for the 70s.
[37:35.640 --> 37:37.360]  I get it.
[37:37.360 --> 37:44.120]  What about having rogue elements of the CIA, foreign governments, major banks, leftist
[37:44.120 --> 37:51.280]  law enforcement leadership, literally lying about you 24-7, behaving like you're cancer
[37:51.280 --> 37:55.760]  and every major university that's public in the country in their journalism department
[37:55.760 --> 38:02.080]  teaches courses with my name on it, lying about me.
[38:02.080 --> 38:06.240]  I've had friends and family.
[38:06.240 --> 38:16.400]  I've got cousins who have children that are in college at Texas State and at George Washington
[38:16.400 --> 38:21.800]  University and at the University of Texas and all over and they go in and it's usually
[38:21.800 --> 38:28.280]  their last year for journalism, their fourth year and they go, we're doing the last semester
[38:28.280 --> 38:34.160]  on Alex Jones and they sit there in those things and they say he's a Nazi, he's a criminal,
[38:34.160 --> 38:39.120]  he's a devil person, we've got to ban him, your job in the press is to shut down media
[38:39.120 --> 38:41.760]  in the future and you look at the press, that's what their job is.
[38:41.760 --> 38:47.840]  The old dying press is going around tattling and taking down websites and lying about people
[38:47.840 --> 38:52.680]  and most of the young people are actually turning against it because it's so flagrant
[38:52.680 --> 39:01.280]  and it's so crazy and it's so over the top and they report, college rejects applicant
[39:01.280 --> 39:06.400]  for following Alex Jones on Twitter, lawyer says, think of the intimidation, you don't
[39:06.400 --> 39:12.800]  say his name, you don't say anything positive, you just submit to all of it of your band.
[39:12.800 --> 39:19.480]  My lord, do you really want to live in a country run by people like that?
[39:19.480 --> 39:27.320]  It's a monopoly and why do you think CNBC was so stunned, we're playing that clip again,
[39:27.320 --> 39:34.600]  minute and a half clip, why do you think they were so stunned because nobody at the Supreme
[39:34.600 --> 39:56.640]  Court in the 50 years of silicon, it's 5-0 now, silicon's 5-0, in 5-0, the Supreme Court
[39:56.640 --> 40:02.840]  has just let tech run wild and DARPA because we were supposed to meet the Chai Khoms and
[40:02.840 --> 40:09.800]  the Russians with it, well now you just decided to go get married to the Chai Khoms, so now
[40:09.800 --> 40:18.800]  you're going to get chopped up and that's why the host is like, say that again, this
[40:18.800 --> 40:27.840]  just happened today, the Supreme Court says you're a monopoly, a monopoly, you don't let
[40:27.840 --> 40:32.560]  there be competition, you're after everybody, you're politically trying to control people
[40:32.560 --> 40:37.760]  and everybody keeps saying, oh they're a private company, hell, you know, what have they bought
[40:37.760 --> 40:44.680]  to air, well you know, make your own planet, they're in bed with foreign governments, they
[40:44.680 --> 40:50.280]  hate the American people, they've got a bunch of lunatics running Apple, Apple and international
[40:50.280 --> 40:58.120]  studies has the most anti-free speech position of any company in the world because they're
[40:58.120 --> 41:05.360]  selling the idea of total tyranny and we'll screw anybody over anytime, anywhere, so you
[41:05.360 --> 41:11.920]  think about that good news because this is just the beginning, folks, keep pushing, it's
[41:11.920 --> 41:17.800]  going to be a hard fight, but in the end we are going to beat these globalists, let's
[41:17.800 --> 41:20.040]  go ahead and go to that club again.
[41:20.040 --> 41:24.960]  Supreme Court has ruled against Apple in an app, sorry, anti-trust case, Apple shares
[41:24.960 --> 41:29.280]  are down, last time I looked more than 5%, we have reached out to Apple for a comment
[41:29.280 --> 41:33.920]  but we have not heard back yet, now consumers are accusing Apple of monopolizing the market
[41:33.920 --> 41:39.640]  for iPhone software apps and forcing them to overpay, now remember the EU is also reportedly
[41:39.640 --> 41:44.520]  getting ready to launch a formal anti-trust investigation against Apple following Spotify's
[41:44.520 --> 41:49.920]  official complaint, which complains that Apple uses its app store to stifle innovation and
[41:49.920 --> 41:54.560]  limit consumer choice, so guys, a lot of pressure right now on Apple in terms of anti-trusts
[41:54.560 --> 41:57.440]  and the role it plays in its app store plays.
[41:57.440 --> 41:58.440]  Back over to you.
[41:58.440 --> 42:04.520]  Dear Jo, I just want to make sure I have this perfectly correct, this is the Supreme Court
[42:04.520 --> 42:10.360]  allowing consumers to pursue this lawsuit against an alleged illegal monopoly, it's
[42:10.360 --> 42:14.280]  not the Supreme Court saying that there is a monopoly.
[42:14.280 --> 42:22.360]  That's correct, Morgan, it is allowing consumers to look into this basically saying that they
[42:22.360 --> 42:27.360]  can look into the fact that Apple may be monopolizing the market for iPhone software apps through
[42:27.360 --> 42:29.360]  its app store.
[42:29.360 --> 42:40.800]  Apple do what it wants, Apple God, Apple spy, Apple sell data, Apple sensor, I mean she's
[42:40.800 --> 42:52.240]  like what, Tim Cook's gay, he allowed them to lip you off, I told you it's coming.
[42:52.240 --> 42:59.400]  I told you of all, you will never establish your kingdom.
[42:59.400 --> 43:29.240]  That's correct, I told you it's coming, I told you it's coming, I told you it's coming,
[43:29.240 --> 43:57.920]  I told you it's coming, I told you it's coming, I told you it's coming.

[46:22.600 --> 46:25.560]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.

[47:44.120 --> 47:49.680]  will to crush us, in defiance of their evil.
[47:49.680 --> 47:54.160]  We're getting stronger by the moment, they're getting weaker.
[47:54.160 --> 47:57.840]  That's why they're constantly saying we're being defeated or they're constantly saying
[47:57.840 --> 48:04.600]  we're being crushed, my spirit has never been this strong, victory has never been this
[48:04.600 --> 48:05.600]  close.
[48:05.600 --> 48:11.600]  All right, let's get into it right now.
[48:11.600 --> 48:17.360]  We have filmmakers that have made some pretty big films that wanted to come interview me
[48:17.360 --> 48:22.720]  like six months ago and they came back a few months ago and I did the interview.
[48:22.720 --> 48:26.840]  And I saw the film a few weeks ago privately and I thought, wow, this is really powerful.
[48:26.840 --> 48:31.320]  Even the bands, the new bands happened a few weeks ago, this is perfect timing.
[48:31.320 --> 48:35.200]  They were going to release it, they were telling me on the phone last week in a few weeks,
[48:35.200 --> 48:39.320]  they're releasing it Wednesday because they want to get it out now.
[48:39.320 --> 48:45.000]  So one of the filmmakers is going to be joining us in the third hour, the other filmmaker
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.400]  will be joining us tomorrow, but it comes out Wednesday and we'll have all the production
[48:49.400 --> 48:50.400]  company is all the tales.
[48:50.400 --> 48:54.280]  I mean, I've interviewed these guys, myself and the show about some of the stuff they've
[48:54.280 --> 48:55.280]  covered in Europe.
[48:55.280 --> 48:57.360]  I don't know all the tales.
[48:57.360 --> 48:58.360]  I'm really busy.
[48:58.360 --> 48:59.920]  I just know I'm in the film.
[48:59.920 --> 49:03.520]  I know I watched the film and I was like, wow, that's better than most stuff you see
[49:03.520 --> 49:04.520]  on Netflix.
[49:04.520 --> 49:07.240]  They're going to try to censor this.
[49:07.240 --> 49:10.320]  And one of the guys is a pretty big liberal.
[49:10.320 --> 49:14.640]  I'm not at liberty to just get into his personal life or his personal lifestyle or any of that.
[49:14.640 --> 49:15.640]  I don't judge that.
[49:15.640 --> 49:21.560]  I judge the character of people, but I knew that it wasn't going to be just a cupcake
[49:21.560 --> 49:26.480]  piece, but I knew they'd made some pretty powerful films.
[49:26.480 --> 49:35.240]  So I went ahead and sat for the film and it's very strong, very, very strong.
[49:35.240 --> 49:38.040]  So we put that back on screen for TV viewers, everybody can see it for radio listeners.
[49:38.040 --> 49:41.280]  I'm going to give people the URL.
[49:41.280 --> 49:45.400]  You can't watch this.com is the name of the film.
[49:45.400 --> 49:48.440]  It's the website and it's going to premiere Wednesday.
[49:48.440 --> 49:54.160]  They were telling me Vimeo, Amazon and a couple of places again.
[49:54.160 --> 49:56.880]  This is a truly independent film.
[49:56.880 --> 50:04.360]  I'm very excited about it because I saw it a few weeks ago and was impressed with it.
[50:04.360 --> 50:08.040]  And I think it really answers the questions about why we're being censored, why we're
[50:08.040 --> 50:09.480]  being attacked.
[50:09.480 --> 50:13.840]  And it's really a weapon for the truth, a weapon for free speech, which I hope that
[50:13.840 --> 50:22.160]  everyone will go either rent it or buy the film to support independent media and press
[50:22.160 --> 50:27.560]  because I can tell you, the filmmakers were calling me just a week ago and we got our
[50:27.560 --> 50:28.560]  name got banned.
[50:28.560 --> 50:33.720]  He was saying my name and they said, we're really shocked by this.
[50:33.720 --> 50:37.760]  And you think we should put trailers out with you in it?
[50:37.760 --> 50:39.800]  And I said, listen, that's your business.
[50:39.800 --> 50:41.920]  I'm not involved in your film.
[50:41.920 --> 50:43.920]  I was like, what's the name again?
[50:43.920 --> 50:45.880]  Yeah, I'm busy.
[50:45.880 --> 50:51.360]  And that's just the chilling effect that's out there.
[50:51.360 --> 50:57.440]  I mean, when gay filmmakers aren't sure they can like say somebody's in their film, that's
[50:57.440 --> 51:02.600]  where this country and this world has gone, ladies and gentlemen, is that there is such
[51:02.600 --> 51:03.600]  a chilling effect.
[51:03.600 --> 51:09.160]  I was on international Turkish TV, undoubtedly one of the biggest shows on that network, one
[51:09.160 --> 51:10.160]  of the biggest in their country.
[51:10.160 --> 51:12.880]  I didn't realize some say it's the hottest show in Turkey.
[51:12.880 --> 51:16.680]  He's a young, smart, good-looking guy, but he just read off a teleprompter, read off
[51:16.680 --> 51:21.720]  a script and all these Hillary Clinton lies, I guess that's going to air live, let's say
[51:21.720 --> 51:24.200]  it's a live show, taped to air the next hour.
[51:24.200 --> 51:27.800]  We're going to see if they edit it down from the 29 minutes and if they do, we're going
[51:27.800 --> 51:28.800]  to release the whole thing.
[51:28.800 --> 51:31.000]  We were taping it.
[51:31.000 --> 51:32.280]  We won't have their full production.
[51:32.280 --> 51:36.520]  We just have that one Skype video, what was coming out of that camera at him.
[51:36.520 --> 51:38.800]  So that's coming out one way or the other.
[51:38.800 --> 51:42.840]  That's how this operates, it's called the news makers.
[51:42.840 --> 51:50.040]  So it's an interview with the dangerous individual that's coming up, but my point is, even they
[51:50.040 --> 51:53.280]  ask me, do you think we'll get banned?
[51:53.280 --> 51:57.760]  This is state-run media in Turkey, if we have you on.
[51:57.760 --> 52:01.840]  And I said, well, as long as you attack me, you won't, and they laughed.
[52:01.840 --> 52:04.320]  They laughed.
[52:04.320 --> 52:09.600]  Of course, I was, the word is, you can tap Jones on, but you're going to attack him.
[52:09.600 --> 52:15.840]  And you can say his name, but with a F him at the end, imagine a 1984 if they had computers
[52:15.840 --> 52:19.720]  towards our will.
[52:19.720 --> 52:23.160]  You could speak of Emmanuel Goldstein, but only if you said negative things about him.
[52:23.160 --> 52:28.840]  He'd be like those dirty tyrants of the imaginary world, but it's happening now.
[52:28.840 --> 52:29.840]  It's not about me.
[52:29.840 --> 52:35.000]  It's about what they're doing and how stupid they think you are and how arrogant they've
[52:35.000 --> 52:36.960]  gotten.
[52:36.960 --> 52:40.280]  But Congress now knows they've created a vacuum.
[52:40.280 --> 52:45.320]  The courts have created a vacuum for the chai comms and the EU and all these other interests
[52:45.320 --> 52:50.280]  to come in and take over the internet and kill its freedom and let it be a commerce-killing
[52:50.280 --> 52:51.280]  monopoly.
[52:51.280 --> 52:58.760]  Well, that's all coming to an end if you wanted to look at libertarians, Christians, conservatives,
[52:58.760 --> 53:03.880]  whether you're black, white, Hispanic, old, young, you go to a conservative meeting.
[53:03.880 --> 53:04.880]  People are smart.
[53:04.880 --> 53:05.880]  They're damn good looking.
[53:05.880 --> 53:06.880]  They're hardworking.
[53:06.880 --> 53:08.640]  They're cool.
[53:08.640 --> 53:09.840]  People go to liberal meetings.
[53:09.840 --> 53:10.840]  People are ugly.
[53:10.840 --> 53:11.840]  They're stupid.
[53:11.840 --> 53:14.160]  There's something wrong with all of them.
[53:14.160 --> 53:15.160]  It's scary actually.
[53:15.160 --> 53:17.120]  I don't see that as a good thing.
[53:17.120 --> 53:18.120]  There's all the studies.
[53:18.120 --> 53:19.880]  Why are conservatives more happy?
[53:19.880 --> 53:21.280]  Why do conservatives live longer?
[53:21.280 --> 53:25.520]  Why do conservatives have more sex?
[53:25.520 --> 53:29.440]  My God, you've got all these candy-ass liberal men trying to act like they're these pimps,
[53:29.440 --> 53:31.720]  trying to act like they're these ladies' men.
[53:31.720 --> 53:37.200]  They couldn't get women if they wanted them.
[53:37.200 --> 53:40.000]  You're a Christian conservative man with your wife and kids.
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.640]  You walk into a restaurant.
[53:42.640 --> 53:47.960]  The three or four hottest women in that restaurant, they want you right now.
[53:47.960 --> 53:51.080]  You could have them in the bathroom if you wanted them, but you don't because you're married
[53:51.080 --> 53:52.080]  and you love your wife.
[53:52.080 --> 53:56.960]  That's what I'm telling you, we're the winners, Hollywood, all of it.
[53:56.960 --> 53:59.600]  They can't give you anything.
[53:59.600 --> 54:00.680]  They don't have it.
[54:00.680 --> 54:07.400]  They want your attention to steal your energy, to steal your soul, to take control of you.
[54:07.400 --> 54:08.640]  You have the power.
[54:08.640 --> 54:09.800]  You have the will.
[54:09.800 --> 54:10.960]  You have the vision.
[54:10.960 --> 54:12.160]  You have the birthright.
[54:12.160 --> 54:13.200]  You have the honor.
[54:13.200 --> 54:14.320]  You have the strength.
[54:14.320 --> 54:15.600]  You have the destiny.
[54:15.600 --> 54:27.040]  You have the overarching manifestation, but you have to call it down.
[54:27.040 --> 54:33.600]  You have to deliver it, and you have to go through the enemy to get it.
[54:33.600 --> 54:38.480]  But instead, you're going to be a slave of the enemy if you don't, so why not fight?
[54:38.480 --> 54:39.760]  Exactly.
[54:39.760 --> 54:45.920]  There is only one way that's coming up for error.
[54:45.920 --> 54:48.400]  You're going to come up for error one way or another.
[54:48.400 --> 54:53.120]  You're going to float to the top dead, or you're going to go to the surface alive.
[54:53.120 --> 55:00.840]  Join me, join your ancestors, join God, join common sense, join life, turn your back on
[55:00.840 --> 55:05.600]  the devil, say, get behind me, Satan, the name of Jesus Christ, and start on the path
[55:05.600 --> 55:12.440]  of red-blooded freedom that God gave us in that life God shot into us through his nostrils,
[55:12.440 --> 55:21.120]  through his will, the will to create little creatures in his image who are each contained
[55:21.120 --> 55:27.600]  universes with the potentiality to do anything in the future, and to love each one of your
[55:27.600 --> 55:32.440]  children, and to be willing to set your children out and love every one of us.
[55:32.440 --> 55:34.800]  God loves every one of us more than we love our own children.
[55:34.800 --> 55:36.120]  Imagine how much you love your own children.
[55:36.120 --> 55:39.640]  You even get guilty having them sometimes, putting them into this, and you know when
[55:39.640 --> 55:41.960]  you have a daughter or a son, they're going to have this great life, but they're going
[55:41.960 --> 55:42.960]  to die someday.
[55:42.960 --> 55:46.680]  You've given them life, you've given them death, and God of all the billions of us,
[55:46.680 --> 55:52.600]  the billions that have come and gone literally loves us beyond his children.
[55:52.600 --> 55:57.040]  We are his children, but gave us free will out of nothing but respect.
[55:57.040 --> 55:59.520]  The Satanists always say, God's a sadist.
[55:59.520 --> 56:05.360]  Why did God let this happen to you because God wanted to create new things that have
[56:05.360 --> 56:11.360]  free will, and wanted you to have beautiful experiences, and wanted you to experience
[56:11.360 --> 56:16.480]  the universe like God has, and I thank God for everything.
[56:16.480 --> 56:20.840]  There's a thousand times more pleasure and enlightenment for the pain, and the pain's
[56:20.840 --> 56:22.720]  only to show us the difference between good and bad.
[56:22.720 --> 56:25.280]  I thank God for consciousness.
[56:25.280 --> 56:28.680]  I thank God for the bad and the good and everything else that comes.
[56:28.680 --> 56:31.280]  I thank God, I thank God.
[56:31.280 --> 56:37.400]  I don't ask God for things, I thank God, and I thank you because without you and your
[56:37.400 --> 56:40.240]  will standing in the way of the enemy, we wouldn't be here, and I'm going to end this,
[56:40.240 --> 56:43.280]  and I'm going to come back with a bunch of news and a bunch of clips, and incredible
[56:43.280 --> 56:48.080]  stuff we haven't gotten to in Hillary's greatest crime that's confirmed that she is a murderer.
[56:48.080 --> 56:53.480]  I'll prove she's a murderer next hour, but first, we are about to end this hour.
[56:53.480 --> 56:54.480]  We need your financial support.
[56:54.480 --> 57:00.120]  If you don't go get products you already need, the coffee, the energy drink, the turbo force,
[57:00.120 --> 57:04.400]  the brain force, the X2, that sells about to end the free bottle of X3.
[57:04.400 --> 57:05.720]  Without you, we're not here.
[57:05.720 --> 57:12.480]  And the new Ultra 12, double strength, purest, highest quality available, methylcobalamin,
[57:12.480 --> 57:16.560]  double strength, Ultra 12, Dwarfing Secret 12.

[58:05.080 --> 58:09.160]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger
[58:09.160 --> 58:13.800]  because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[58:13.800 --> 58:18.560]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the sensors now and if
[58:18.560 --> 58:24.120]  all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[58:24.120 --> 58:28.000]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[58:28.000 --> 58:33.880]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[58:33.880 --> 58:38.680]  Call and talk radio, c-span, shout it out loud and public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[58:38.680 --> 58:42.160]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[58:42.160 --> 58:50.480]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[58:50.480 --> 58:55.840]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[58:55.840 --> 59:01.160]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[59:01.160 --> 59:07.880]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[59:07.880 --> 59:13.720]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[59:13.720 --> 59:17.040]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[59:17.040 --> 59:21.960]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[59:21.960 --> 59:28.480]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[59:28.480 --> 59:30.720]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[59:30.720 --> 59:31.960]  It is not an antihistamine.
[59:31.960 --> 59:36.600]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[59:36.600 --> 59:42.440]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[59:42.440 --> 59:45.080]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[59:45.080 --> 59:54.040]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[59:54.040 --> 01:00:18.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:36.040]  Thank you for watching.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:01:00.560]  All right listen I've already spent most the first hour over the celebration of the Supreme
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:06.200]  Court now getting more into the control of the Republic and America again for only part
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:12.080]  way there has said Apple is a big disgusting evils thinking slave factory owning monopoly
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:21.000]  run by a bunch of demonic daisies hopping around and it's going to come to an end and
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.480]  Congress can move against them state courts can remove move against them the people can
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:35.960]  move against them this is a big fat stinking whorehouse so and the little birdies as I've
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:43.400]  been telling you in nauseam the last six months say that Trump is going to break them up and
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:55.560]  the last straw was Tim Cook turd gobbling behind the chai cops running around behind
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.040]  them grobbling to them and look it's gonna hurt the stock market and it's gonna hurt
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:05.600]  Apple and all this it's fine hurt Apple a bunch even the chai cops a few years ago said
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.320]  you pay people the less of any factory in China they chain their kids up at power poles
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.720]  outside people work 18 hours a day you give them pros that type drugs will they commit
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:22.400]  suicide when you just pay them 10% more they can have a place to live and Cook said no
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.360]  because he's liberal he doesn't pay any taxes either you understand when you hop around
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:35.520]  and go I'm gay I'm gay that's it then everything's okay and so that's this whole leftist cover
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:41.640]  a big tech it's all the most sickening most evil CEOs that make robber barons of a hundred
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:51.040]  years ago 150 years ago look like choir boys and it just has to come to an end with them
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:58.480]  so arrogant Google told the Pentagon we don't work with you we don't like America last year
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.840]  and then Apple said yeah we're giving the code keys to everybody's Apple devices the
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:12.720]  Pentagon didn't want to hurt the stock a few months ago but it's not just the 5g company
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:18.400]  Huawei or whatever its name is they don't let on basis now any security can have iPhones
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:24.800]  on them now because the chai comms have the codes to everything your photos your pass
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:33.160]  codes they're in them and Tim Cook just said hey listen I'm gay so he was in Reuters last
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.320]  year remember he said we're giving them the code keys that's what happens when you move
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.800]  to China officially for no taxes you know the government is in there and yeah we store
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:52.360]  the I kept cloud keys in China and the government has access did I mention I'm gay Tim Cook
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:58.880]  so again we don't care your gay Tim Cook we just care you're raping our freedom and selling
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:04.200]  us out of the chai comms but he's like did I tell you again I'm gay we're like Tim we
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:10.080]  don't care your gay but I'm gay Alex is a horrible person we made the decision to ban
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:14.640]  him system-wide we hope others do and they've been following his orders well that's good
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:18.720]  Tim be sure and wear some sunglasses when you're outside though because when you don't
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:23.480]  have any irises and your people are that big it either means you've had a massive stroke
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:29.800]  you're dead or you're on some really hardcore drugs doesn't look like you're getting more
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:37.280]  than 500 calories a day and I guess that's suppository that where you get that like yeah
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:46.960]  that's probably where it is Tim Cook does not consume via his mouth Tim Cook well we'll
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:52.040]  just leave it at that all right ladies and gentlemen wear those sunglasses there bud
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:56.080]  must be some amazing synthetic drugs you're on for you to try to pull this off against
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:01.760]  America buddy boy we all know the importance of fish oils while we are sure to provide

[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:22.960]  raging war on corruption it's alex jones okay folks i have a stack of news articles and
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:28.600]  press releases put out by ice of how record numbers of their agents are getting diseases
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:33.440]  that haven't been in this country for decades from the illegal aliens and that record numbers
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:38.360]  of illegal aliens are pouring across and they're begging congress for funding trump
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:42.760]  has been blocked by congress but he did just get a billion plus dollars of emergency funding
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:49.040]  out of the pentagon to try to do something and colter is blaming trump when trump's doing
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:53.480]  everything he can and being attacked and i'm not just here to defend trump when trump doesn't
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:57.040]  do something i think is constitutional or doesn't stand up for what's right i'll get
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:01.920]  on his butt real fast i mean that's what he responds to but i i just don't it's the democrats
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:09.400]  it's the blue bloods and congress republicans i've got all that apple just got hit with antitrust
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:13.600]  the supreme court ruled they are a monopoly everyone including state governments federal
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:18.280]  government the legislature can pass laws the supreme court says they will not strike
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:27.880]  them down the the the supreme court just greenlit the destruction of apple the the the the cutting
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:33.160]  of it up because it's been a monopoly in the making since its beginning steve jobs wanted
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:38.600]  to be in a monopoly steve jobs wanted his own internet you'd be on your own system steve
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:43.400]  jobs wouldn't let his kids have ipads or iphone before he died because he knew it was designed
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:49.040]  to habituate and destroy families bill gates doesn't let his kids have him he tells them
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:08:00.680]  you're disowned if you have one they mean business so this is a big big big big big
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:05.880]  deal and it confirms the federal government is finally waking up that hey why would you
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:10.400]  even if you're evil sociopaths which i'm not saying they all are but some are why would
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.360]  you give away all the power to the e you and the chai comes and and just wreck america
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:21.040]  just because well we want to prove we be america why would you want to beat america instead
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:25.880]  of empowering america i mean let's use a game of thrones analogy because the hype got me
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:29.440]  into it i know eight nine years it's been on or whatever it is i probably watched ten
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:33.560]  episodes of it but i've been watching the last few episodes because you know my kids
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:38.480]  like it and it'd be kind of like you got a bunch of fire breathing dragons in a war
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:43.360]  why would you kill the dragon like i'm i'm i'm scared of that dragon it's more powerful
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.800]  than me so i think if i could just poison it i could mount its head on the wall in my
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:53.480]  throne room i'd feel more powerful knowing that i tricked the dragon to eat the poison
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.440]  why don't you climb on its damn back and vaporize the enemy and so you want to use
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:03.320]  one of those analogies that's what we're dealing with with the chicken you know what dimension
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:14.040]  i've coined that term the chicken sh-t dimension or the needle di-k dimension because you got
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:21.280]  to be from the needle dong dimension to want to take america and demoralize it and just
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:28.000]  run it in the ground because you're some hunchback demon hillary or some hunchback nadler or
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.600]  some hunchback michael moore or and there's some hunchbacks out there that are naturally
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:40.080]  hunchbacks i don't mean that meanly i'm just saying spiritually it's an archetype take
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:45.640]  take 300 which was turned into a cartoon type deal i mean he's not a cartoon but it's so
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:50.240]  much rotoscope in this cartoon but it's based on a true story that happened and there probably
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:55.160]  were some traders that that that that you know told the giant force 20 times the Greeks
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:00.280]  or more where they could do a pass to cut them off so 300 for days held up a force of
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:06.600]  hundreds of thousands over 150,000 some numbers of 300,000 and there were there were piles
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:13.080]  of dead bodies 50 feet tall that they used as a berm and some traders got paid off who
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:24.280]  weren't in the warrior class but they went and they tattled and they told the iranians
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:32.000]  the persians how to come around and kill them and of course it was like the alamo everybody
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.400]  died but it just pissed all the other greek states to a point of getting together and
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:41.040]  then kicking the persians ass it was more than 20 states so that little group of warriors
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:48.440]  300 with a couple thousand subgroups helping them that did that and it's a famous case
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:53.280]  but if you go back just type into youtube the trader from 300 you've got the hunchback
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:11:03.680]  deformed guy that they wouldn't let into the Spartans and so he goes and he sells out to
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:09.320]  the persians and they make him a general of course he's not really a general and he's
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:14.960]  a joke and the deformity was seen in the ancients as a symbol of you've been looked down upon
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:18.400]  the gods there's something wrong with your soul I'm not putting down to form people
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.880]  hell there's a lot of deformed people out there there's all the chemicals and everything
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:26.600]  else you know they're going on hell I got a couple of mutations myself but the point
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:31.840]  is it's not really bad mutations like one in a million has it my roots in my teeth are
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.640]  about twice as long they go around under my jaw and curl up and hold on it's very hard
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:41.320]  to deal with my teeth and then I've got a mutation for my feet and one of my bones I learned
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:46.560]  about and a mutation in skull thickness yes I have about as thick a skull as you can get
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:51.040]  ladies and gentlemen but twice the thickness of the average cranium it is a mutation even
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:58.440]  as a name the point is this is this poor boy is really mutated really bad my mutations
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:07.200]  all seem to be for war this boy's mutations are not for war his mutations are for weakness
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:12.960]  and so he can't join so he goes and joins the traders and if you look at the globalist
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:23.280]  you look at the left you go to a democratic event they all look like hunchback goblins
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:32.320]  and so to them 300 standing against 150,000 that makes him feel small but if he can beat
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:41.400]  the superior he could be somebody and if you understand this allegory you understand everything
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:53.280]  if you understand the allegory you understand how the whole world actually works you see
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:57.880]  because those of us that are strong we're not trying to dominate the weak but the weak
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:03.040]  will organize with evil against us so we don't kill the weak like the eugenicists want to
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:09.040]  do we have to empower them and that's the burden now you want to hear Hillary Clinton's
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:19.000]  greatest crime and the proof of her criminal the proof that she killed over a million people
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.920]  no I'm not talking about Syria she did that too in other countries I'm talking about total
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:28.200]  proof of her crimes and she is still planning to run obviously she's attacked me last week
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:34.280]  we'll get back to that clip but that's coming up in the next segment now I'm gonna leave
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:43.800]  it at this this is the last three days because x2 from 7 to 12,000 feet pure iodine it has
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:49.360]  to go through a DEA lab approved facility with DEA inspections that cost so much money
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:53.640]  for us to pay for but I understand why you can make anything with pure iodine when it's
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:58.080]  in the crystal source I mean this stuff you put on the table it just starts burning all
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:04.480]  through it and purple gas shoots up it's amazing no other iodine nobody else does this somebody
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:10.840]  else gets it we then put it into the organic oil plant oil and then it's legal and it's
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:17.920]  all it's all DEA approved okay but yet but it is a precursor to methamphetamine you name
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:24.480]  it anything so the globalists are fighting to keep iodine out of your diet it's out
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:28.840]  of the soils it's out of the plants it's almost out of everything now you get it in some stuff
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:35.640]  you get out of the ocean but then that's got a lot of toxins in it now this is pure 99999999
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:49.160]  that's why it's got a 98% authorization it's why it's got 4.9 stars 6000 plus reviews because
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:53.280]  it's that special you'd say well why do I care about other iodines are you know 97%
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.960]  of iodine because if they're bound to stuff in the environment your body cannot absorb
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:04.480]  it pure iodine goes into the body and grabs all the toxins out it's what your glands operate
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:14.960]  off of if you don't have it they'll grab bad allergens chloride fluoride bromide and a
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:20.280]  bunch of other trash which they will then suck into your glands it'll work your glands
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:26.840]  will swell up and then conk out and then something happens called death so despite all the stress
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:31.800]  I'm under and I don't take care of myself and I still eat 30 ounce steaks and do a lot

[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:09.120]  fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:14.200]  down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best idea in the world we've
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:19.720]  gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.720]  to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:29.120]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:34.240]  now due to the established trying to block that we did more research and secured more
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:38.960]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:43.920]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:51.160]  and vitamin C it super charges it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:56.040]  you want to research it you want to see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:03.800]  at m4slife.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:27.400]  oh
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:40.840]  Okay, so, I was on international Turkish television this morning, one of the biggest shows in
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:46.240]  Turkey, and they were reading a laundry list of questions that I get in the exact order
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:51.800]  on any national or international show, all written by the Democrats, written by the former
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:58.360]  head of Hillary's campaign for PR, for PR head, who admittedly was in the national news
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:03.640]  last week as Facebook's head PR person for my banning.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.640]  That's right.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:10.400]  Hillary's former head of PR works at Facebook now and runs the banning operation.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:17.000]  So I'm on Turkish television, I may even air some of this in a third hour, and they're
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.520]  just going through this laundry list.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:23.320]  And one of the things is, well, you say Hillary Clinton's a murderer, what's your proof?
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.840]  And I'm sure they're going to cut all that out.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:28.160]  And I'm like, are you kidding?
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:34.400]  She said, we came to Libya, we saw, he died, they set Gaddafi up, the famous Clinton death
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:39.640]  list, you've got, when she was co-president with Clinton, she admitted she was co-president,
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:43.040]  Marilyn Albright saying they killed a half million children with sanctions that were
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.120]  like seven times worse than what George Herbert Walker Bush put on them, I mean, just crippling.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:54.840]  They cut food off for eight years to a desert country that imported 90% of its food.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:22:05.360]  No antibiotics for little kids, I mean, just evil crap.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:09.640]  And boy, that host shut up real quick, you know he's going to cut it out.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:14.640]  It doesn't matter, we recorded it ourselves, we're going to air it, that's how this works.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:20.640]  I even told them, but they're so arrogant they weren't listening.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:28.160]  So the strangest thing about this last night, I had a dream about this last night.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:33.080]  I woke up at 3 a.m. and couldn't go back to sleep, I had this dream.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:38.040]  I had this dream where I was interviewing the medical doctor that worked at four state
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:45.800]  prisons overseeing the medical wards and I was interviewing this medical doctor and
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:51.200]  he was exposing how for a decade they were shipping blood out of people that had HIV
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:56.280]  and hepatitis to be added to factor eight for hemophiliacs and that the Clintons were
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:01.560]  being apprised of this and knew it was giving everybody HIV and hepatitis and that all the
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:05.880]  other prisons in the country had either banned giving blood or they were screening it and
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:13.000]  the Clintons were certifying every ounce of blood as safe and instead of testing each
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:19.040]  packet of blood that cost hundreds of dollars or two, they just certified it all and sent
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:26.920]  a death sentence on to millions of hemophiliacs and others that took drugs like factor eight
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:30.920]  by Bayer.
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.000]  Now you know what was funny about the dream?
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:41.240]  My eyes popped open at 3.02 a.m. and I went, that's not a dream.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.240]  I interviewed that doctor.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:50.800]  He was firebombed 48 hours later and that's how much, I'm not bragging, but that's how
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.960]  many wars I've been in, folks.
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:57.280]  Sometimes I'll be driving along and like be thinking about something, I go, that's incredible.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.280]  That's wild.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.280]  Oh wait, that really happened.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.400]  I did that.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.400]  We did that.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:06.440]  So I had this doctor on when he was in some, a few local papers and some national papers
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.240]  and it had been confirmed.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:17.960]  He got firebombed two days later in Little Rock and the hemophiliac society in Canada
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:22.880]  got robbed and everything stolen because they were involved in a lawsuit against the Clintons.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:27.960]  Now later, I'm going to show you New York Times, Washington Post, four years later,
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:36.280]  reporting everything I said and everything I did with those guests.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.520]  But we had to hit the barbed wire first.
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:48.360]  I had no idea that I was the first big radio interview this guy had done that got detraction.
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:51.040]  And if I told you the rest of the story, it sounds like a James Bond movie, so I'm not
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.040]  going to get into it.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:56.440]  But I didn't know why folks were coming after me at that point or why I got called in and
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:59.640]  they said, we don't care if you have the number one ratings here in Austin.
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:01.440]  Yeah, that's him.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:03.440]  I interviewed him.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.440]  Edward.
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:07.440]  Yeah, a bunch of those guys.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:14.160]  Anyways, I interviewed the Canadians, the guy in Arkansas and we got to get them back
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:17.800]  on and they wouldn't come back on after they were on the show because they got death-threaded.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:18.800]  They got attacked.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:19.800]  They got firebombed.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:24.040]  I mean, it was bad and this is like 1997 or so.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:27.240]  So three, four years later, it comes out in the New York Times.
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:35.640]  It comes out in the Washington Post that the Clintons knew that the blood in the prison,
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:39.480]  they were letting people give blood once a week, supposed to be once a month.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:43.720]  And they were selling the inmates cocaine that the Clintons were shipping into Mina.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:49.600]  And then they were doing all this and all of it came out.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.640]  So we broke all this before World Net Daily.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.640]  They were the next after us.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.640]  Everybody else.
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.280]  And that's why we're hated.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:06.760]  And Hillary and Bill Clinton were paid more than $10 million over a decade as the governor
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:12.000]  to certify blood to be sold to Bayer out of Canada.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.320]  They'd chip the blood to Canada, they'd mix all the blood together, scoop the platelets
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:25.920]  out and sell it as factor eight plotting agent, knowing that everyone that took it got hepatitis
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.920]  A, B, C, and HIV.
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:33.400]  Now, if you're a radio listener, you're going, this is wild.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:40.000]  I'm showing TV viewers, The Guardian, The Associated Press, The Washington Post.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  But I want it to sink in before I come back and play these clips and go to Mike Adams
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:52.680]  who's joining us on a similar issue to understand Hillary and Bill were paid $10 million by
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:27:01.680]  this Canadian company that we know of to say all the blood in Arkansas was certified and
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:08.520]  did not do the hundreds of millions of dollars of testing they would have done on hundreds
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:13.800]  of millions of dosages of blood, CBS News.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:18.760]  Bayer admits it paid millions of HIV infected cases just not in English.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:22.200]  Now, it came out in the Bayer documents.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:26.640]  We're going to play some of these newscasts when we come back.
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:33.960]  Back when the news still did its job 10 years ago, that the executives in Australia, Canada,
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:37.800]  and in France, they never got the documents in the U.S. because by then Clinton was president.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:39.920]  He blocked it.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:45.720]  The executives, these are like presidents, are saying, screw these people.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:50.280]  There's too many hemophiliacs anyways because their own executives are like, you know we
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:56.680]  got lied to by the Clintons and we have given millions HIV and hepatitis and they said,
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:57.680]  screw them.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:58.680]  There's too many of them anyways.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.520]  This is in the documents.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:09.160]  You're a hemophiliac kid that you love and who's six years old and gets cut and doesn't
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:10.160]  stop bleeding.
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.160]  You love that girl.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.160]  You love that boy.
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:18.400]  And these CEOs are sitting around going, you know, hemophiliacs are defective.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.400]  F them.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.400]  You know what?
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.400]  F you.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:22.400]  F you.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:27.440]  You want to kill babies after they're born?
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:28.440]  You want to decide they don't exist?
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:32.480]  What if somebody, I'm not calling for this, gets you around your neck and squeals.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.600]  Squeezes your eyeballs out and says, I just aborted some 70-year-old executive because
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:43.800]  it was a post birth abortion, then it'd be all over the news a murder.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.480]  How about we got some value?
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.440]  How about our kids got some value?
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:50.000]  We're going to come back and play all this.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  Stay with us.

[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:33.120]  I'm not filtering anything, I'm giving the best truth I can from my research.
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.560]  And that's true story.
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:39.640]  I told, because last week Hillary went all over the country giving speeches, like she's
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:45.880]  on the campaign trail, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and some of the places
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:51.160]  she lost, and she's still planning to run, and I told you that, and now it's even admitted
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:54.800]  I'm not saying it's going to happen, but that's currently what she's planning.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:58.400]  And I wake up from a dream last night, you know, where Hillary knowingly knows there's
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:04.760]  HIV and hepatitis in the blood, and I'm interviewing the doctor, and they get firebombed, and I'm
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:08.640]  in this dream, I'm going, you know, as you get older, you learn to control your dreams.
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:12.880]  I'm like, God, that's just crazy, what a weird ass dream, and I wake up and I go, I go to
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:19.480]  the kitchen, I had a glass of water, and I go, oh my God, that's all real.
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:25.320]  That's my subconscious going, Alex, Hillary and the blood scandal is everything.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:33.440]  It's where they got caught, they were president by then, they were able to protect it.
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:37.240]  And that's it.
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:40.760]  And then I did research on it to remember all of it, and it was worse than I thought.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:43.720]  It wasn't a million people.
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:48.440]  They estimate eight million people got HIV or hepatitis, or both, and that three million
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.480]  have died.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:35:00.480]  Three million people knowingly putting prison blood with people with hepatitis and HIV,
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:06.480]  mainly to children all over the world, why the hell would you do that?
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:14.400]  Why the hell would Hillary out of college get her first job representing rich pedophiles?
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:22.120]  Because that's how you go to the top of this system.
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:28.280]  And you know, you tell the average person, Hillary and Bill made more than $10 million
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:34.520]  off selling people tainted blood, and it just doesn't sound real, does it?
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:39.840]  Because you wouldn't do that.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.880]  You feel like, when you even think about that, imagine you were going to do that.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:44.520]  You feel like you're attacking yourself, don't you?
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:47.320]  Because you're connected to God and everybody.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:48.600]  You're a real collectivist.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:52.800]  You're an individual that does their own will, but collectively you would want to hurt people.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:56.600]  The collectivists say they're collectivists because they're not, folks, they're cut off.
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:58.320]  They think that's winning.
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:01.760]  They think they get some brownie points with their God, just like killing already born
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:02.760]  babies.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:06.520]  It's always pushed the envelope.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:12.440]  So here's a boil down from when I covered on Friday where Hillary says, I've never
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.440]  killed anybody.
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.440]  They make this up.
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:15.440]  She gets into Info Wars.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:16.440]  Now we need to be banned.
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.000]  I won't play all of it.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.240]  And then we're going to play and show you the mainstream news articles admitting that
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.440]  they did this years after we broke it.
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:24.440]  I want to explain.
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:27.640]  I'm not bragging about that.
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:39.320]  I had the medical doctor on that was the head guy at four state prisons.
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:43.960]  And he started asking questions for years and he found out they were falsifying the
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:44.960]  certifications.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:48.720]  The blood had been tested because that's a lot of money to test it.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.240]  And then he found out, wait, you're taking it from HIV positive.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:54.080]  You know when you're doing it.
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:56.440]  They tried to pay him off.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:03.800]  They got firebombed.
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:07.920]  I had things happen to me.
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:13.600]  But after it happened a few times, people stopped doing it because things didn't go
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:20.440]  the way people thought they'd go.
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:27.520]  So you know, I do what I have to do and I'm not backing down.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.200]  And if you attack me, you're going to get attacked right back.
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:36.640]  And then it's up to the system out there at Fort Hood or wherever to figure out what happened
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:39.000]  to you.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.280]  But the American people aren't putting up with this crap anymore.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:47.000]  There's still red blooded Americans left.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  So here's Greg's little boil down to this and I'll get to even MSNBC before they sold
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.480]  out admitting all this here it is.
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:38:00.600]  Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State, when Hillary was co-president with Bill and she
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:05.440]  also worked at the State Department and Madeleine Albright went on national television on NBC
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:12.440]  and on 60-minute CBS, there's two different clips of this, and said 500,000 dead Iraqi
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:16.640]  children is a good price to pay because if you thought George Herbert Walker Bush put
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:21.840]  sanctions on Iraq, in the eight years of the Clintons, they put sanctions on them that
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:29.600]  killed over 2 million people because that's a desert country, 95% of it.
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:35.000]  They were shipping in their fertilizer, their medicine, everything.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:41.920]  So she gets asked by a half million kids when Hillary Clinton's mentor was working for Hillary
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:45.520]  at the time, Madeleine Albright says it's a good price to pay, then Hillary goes in
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:51.080]  front of this crowd of fawning sick of fans and want to be elitist and makes a joke about
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:52.080]  all this.
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.080]  It's just incredible.
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:55.480]  Hillary Clinton, you are a murderer.
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:56.480]  You are a criminal.
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:57.480]  You've bragged about it.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:58.480]  You know it.
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:59.480]  You're a ruthless person.
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:04.160]  These are just times you bragged about killing or your associates bragged about your policies
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:05.320]  that killed millions.
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:06.320]  So here it is.
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:09.520]  We have heard half a million children have died.
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:18.960]  I mean that's more children than died in Hiroshima and you know is the price worth it?
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:24.400]  I think this is a very hard choice but the price we think the price is worth it.
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:29.960]  So that's 1996, May 12th, that's Hillary Clinton's buddy and her policies that did
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:30.960]  this.
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:36.920]  But then she's Secretary of State many years later and they go in and use al-Qaeda and ISIS
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:43.040]  to take over a country, put women back into sex slavery, kill black Libyans because Islamists
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:48.280]  are very anti-black and then Hillary brags about she came, she saw Gaddafi died.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.280]  Here it is.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:51.840]  I mean that is the land of unconfirmed videos.
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:54.840]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:57.920]  Did you have anything to do with your visit?
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:58.920]  No.
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:39:59.920]  I'm sure it did.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:06.880]  She says she lost the election because of your truly internet conspiracies and she said
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:12.240]  when people went to knock on doors for her they said I can't vote for you, you're a murderer.
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:17.360]  Clinton says she usually never paid attention to her critics but what she calls the conspiracy
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:21.480]  fetishizing of the 2016 campaign was different.
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:25.860]  She says she heard just how different it was from lifelong friends who were out knocking
[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:26.860]  on people's doors.
[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:32.760]  They'd say they were there asking that the person vote for me and the person might say
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.760]  something like well I couldn't do that, she's a murderer.
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:42.320]  And you know I mean friends from grade school say no she's not, oh yeah I saw it on the
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.320]  internet.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:47.480]  Well what's you think I've been, as they used to say, locked up by now if that were
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.480]  the case?
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:51.440]  Yeah you will get locked up in hell one way or another.
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:56.600]  So let's go back to TV viewers, radio listeners, the fawning students worshiping her.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:58.960]  Hey guys, this is the real world.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.440]  Millions of children got HIV and hepatitis because of this.
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:07.400]  So do you understand why you're all playing cutesy and she's the good lady and all this,
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:11.800]  that she's literally famous around the world for being evil and ruthless?
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:16.800]  She got thrown off the Watergate Committee for lying about Nixon.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:20.280]  I mean she's a crook of crooks.
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:25.040]  I mean here kids, there's counter punch, liberal site, Arkansas blood suckers, the
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:30.040]  Clinton's prisoners in blood trade, you know back when liberals told the truth, Clinton's
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:35.360]  Arkansas blood scandal, suit says Canada imported tainted blood from U.S. inmates,
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:43.440]  New York Times, Clinton's involved, Arkansas prison blood scandal, encyclopedia of Arkansas,
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:50.360]  Bayer admits it paid millions to HIV-infected cases to cover it up, there you go.
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:53.200]  Let's go out with just a few minutes, you just type in the YouTube, it's still up there,
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:58.360]  they'll take it down, Bayer blood scandal, this is what you've signed on to, this is
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:03.440]  she knows it's got HIV, she gets money for it and ships it out to kill people, here it
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:04.440]  is.
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:07.040]  The show, we appreciate you being on tonight.
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.280]  Thanks for the invitation, Joe.
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:14.360]  Okay, let's talk about the rat of the week, why is Bayer Corporation the rat of the week?
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:19.520]  Internal documents show that after this company positively absolutely knew that they had a
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:24.040]  medication that was infected with the AIDS virus, they took the product off the market
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:28.160]  in the U.S. and then they dumped it in France, Europe, Asia and Latin America.
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:33.920]  The medicines called Factorate, it was an injection medicine that was used for hemophilax, mostly
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:36.320]  children, children had been born with an injury.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:39.920]  Hold on, hold on, Mike, hold on, hold on, so you're telling me that Bayer...
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:44.280]  All right, let's stop there, the live show is continuing, when I post this to Infowars
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:46.080]  we'll put the full report up.
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:52.640]  This is who they are, knowingly, over a decade, three million dead, Hillary is a murderer,
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.120]  I rest my case, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:02.480]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:06.560]  control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:11.680]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:15.320]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:19.880]  third dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:22.840]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.

[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:08.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:48:00.960]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we've got a lot of really positive things going on.
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:10.000]  The world is waking up, humans are amazing, our destiny to win is real.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  But those that have dialed into the system are going to be mesmerized and put even into
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.240]  a deeper cult like trance.
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:20.600]  Those that are awakening, it's going to be incredible and you could be old, you could
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.400]  be young, you could be white, you could be black, you could be Asian, you could be Hispanic,
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:25.400]  doesn't matter.
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:28.520]  You have red blood, you love God, you love freedom.
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:33.440]  But remember what happened last year when Apple banned us off of iTunes and off their
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.520]  other platforms where we had 40 million subscribers between all of our different podcasts and
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:39.520]  shows.
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:46.200]  David Knight had 9 million subscribers in only a year and a half of doing a show and
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:51.240]  he had the highest open rate of anybody I'd seen, even Joe Rogan myself.
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:55.120]  I had a low open rate actually, like 10% actually opened and listened to it.
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:59.880]  David had like 60% opening and listening to it every day.
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:04.240]  I used to tell David, hey, you got a huge online audience, it's okay, you only got like
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:07.640]  20 radio affiliates in a few TV stations, it takes years to get affiliates.
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:12.200]  And I'd say, look, you got your iTunes over here, you're so big.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.160]  Well, they took that away from them.
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:17.240]  They think you're too stupid to go to informers.com, force less show and find it.
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:20.800]  So then they left the app up we just launched a few months before, it went to number one
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:23.480]  in news.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:29.520]  But then Cook said he curated it and decided we didn't have a Chinese slave camp building
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:37.080]  iPhones or we weren't a system to hold iPhone codes up on the cloud, we weren't doing any
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:38.080]  of that.
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:40.600]  No, no, I mean, we hadn't killed millions of people.
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:41.600]  So we were bad.
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.360]  We were dangerous.
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:44.360]  So they banned that app.
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:49.040]  We still have the free app at informers.com for slash app for now for androids, you know,
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:52.360]  they banned it, you'll still at least have it on your phone.
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:56.200]  But the reason I get it that is Mike Adams wrote a bunch of big articles about this natural
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:03.520]  news.com, you know, he's been a really smart cookie about having over 50 websites and having
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:09.400]  a more, let's say camouflaged footprint, you know about the censorship coming, but
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:10.920]  he reaches as many people as we do.
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:14.920]  But remember this a few months ago back on February bombshell Apple demands and actual
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:22.240]  news stop writing about abortions, Satanism threats to block app from Apple devices.
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:28.200]  Well, now he's got a new article out on informers.com and natural news.com techno dictatorship.
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:32.400]  Apple bans natural news for publishing true climate science stories like NASA saying carbon
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:33.760]  dioxide is good.
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:36.400]  Apple claims are rejected by the scientific community.
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:38.160]  They mean their globalist community.
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:44.200]  So the reason I wanted to have him on is Supreme Court ruling saying they can be broken up
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:46.240]  as a monopoly.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:51.360]  Any individual, any county, any city, any state, the federal government, legislatures,
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:52.680]  they are done.
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:53.760]  This is Trump delivering.
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:57.640]  I said this in private conversations with you six months ago at this office, you said
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:58.640]  Trump needs to act.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:02.440]  And I said, listen, and I'm not tooting horns and acting like I'm important here.
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:06.200]  We only like to say this on air, but I want listeners to know I was in DC three weeks
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:07.200]  ago.
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:10.320]  I noticed I go to DC all the time now for certain reasons as we there's areas we have
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:13.000]  to talk where there's no phones or anything.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.800]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:18.320]  And the left suing me on these, these things about Sandy Hook, it's about what government
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:21.280]  agencies you work for, who are your contacts, that's nothing to do with Sandy Hook.
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:24.400]  You're not getting all that, but there's a leftist resistance.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:30.040]  There's an American resistance and I've been told you watch before the middle of the year
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:34.200]  Trump will signify and so will the Supreme Court that we're going to break up big tech
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:37.680]  starting with Apple who he knows the ringleader and his move to China.
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:44.400]  Next is Google, then is Twitter, Facebook is as bad as they are.
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.040]  That's up in the wind.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:47.040]  That's what I've been told.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:50.480]  And I've been told a lot more and Mike, I've told you this privately, you see it unfolding
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:51.480]  right now.
[01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:53.440]  No, you got your sources as well as an engineer in your own right.
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:56.400]  But this is a big deal, isn't it?
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.400]  Well, absolutely.
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:03.080]  This action this morning, it just comes on the heels of Apple really trying to completely
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:09.920]  annihilate any dissenting scientific views, any real education of the public about how
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:15.040]  carbon dioxide is greening the earth, you know, NASA cited that study published in Nature
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:21.560]  Climate Science showed since 1985 to, I'm sorry, 1982 to 2015, the greening of the earth
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:25.760]  has accelerated as carbon dioxide has, but I don't think plants need carbon dioxide.
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:27.760]  They need brondo.
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:29.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:35.280]  But what's important about this is understanding that look, Apple will curate and endorse news
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:39.880]  sources that say men can get pregnant and men can give birth and that, you know, all
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:44.960]  kinds of 300 pound power livers that look more manly than you and I can go beat 80
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.440]  pound little girls.
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:47.440]  Exactly.
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:54.640]  But if you cite NASA, if you cite botanical science, if you cite atmospheric science,
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:56.680]  then you are banned because your view is dissenting.
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:53:00.200]  And listen, I know I got you on late, I got another guest coming up, but I'll hold you
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:01.200]  over.
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:02.200]  But let's go.
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:03.200]  I want to first, we're going to get into your story.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.480]  And the fact that they're saying you can't cite NASA, it's huge.
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:06.480]  I get it.
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:07.480]  That's how cuckoo it is.
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:10.440]  Well, you got to cite chai-com that America can't have industry.
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:11.440]  That's what this really is.
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:12.440]  It's chai-com.
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:13.440]  They can have no controls.
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:14.440]  We have total controls.
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:15.440]  That's what it is, Mike.
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.440]  And you're right.
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:17.440]  They're saying, you know, they're 50 genders.
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:18.440]  You're crazy.
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:19.440]  The sky's pink.
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:20.440]  Okay.
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:21.440]  I understand.
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:22.440]  Fish fly, pigs live in the ocean.
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:26.720]  But what about Trump and the Supreme Court saying you're a monopoly, you can be broken
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:29.320]  up, you're wide open, everybody can sue you?
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:31.160]  That is death knell to Apple.
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:34.960]  This is a devastating death star level event.
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:38.640]  Yeah, it's billions of dollars in revenue that they're on the table here for Apple.
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:44.400]  And remember that sales of iPhones are collapsing, which means that Apple is turning to services
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:48.880]  and software licensing and app fees in order to maintain its earnings.
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:53.320]  This means Apple's earnings are going to collapse and it's going to lose its stranglehold over
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.000]  the monopoly of apps.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  This is going to mean that InfoWars will be able to get its app returned back to the
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.720]  Apple marketplace eventually as this winds its way through the courts.
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:06.640]  It may also be a time, I'm sure you've already thought about this, to talk to your attorneys
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:09.400]  about closely watching this Supreme Court case.
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:12.480]  This is just given the plaintiff the right to continue the lawsuit.
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:15.920]  This totally green lights us, this totally green lights us.
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:16.920]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:21.400]  And there will be a flurry of lawsuits from thousands of app developers, including us.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:27.520]  Remember, our app was banned by Apple, our upgraded app, they allow our old app to stay
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:28.520]  in the store even though...
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:33.480]  Mala, they do this to everybody now, they send you a list of demands of what you can
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:36.240]  and can't say, how or well you're in.
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:37.240]  That's right.
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:40.600]  And remember that Apple won't let you talk about Satanism, they won't let you talk about
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:44.320]  abortion and now they won't even let you talk about atmospheric science.
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:46.160]  This is how insane it has become.
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:49.920]  So this is a cult, just as you said before this segment.
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:55.720]  We are looking at a fascist techno cult that is trying to dominate the world and they're
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:55:01.080]  pushing, there's a new phrase, a new quote disorder, it's called climate anxiety.
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:06.760]  They're pushing climate anxiety, which is a form of mental terrorism to push terror into
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:08.240]  the minds of all leftists.
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:12.120]  Leave them in a state of fear and irrationality so that they can never wake up and come out
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:15.360]  of this and snap out and say, oh my God, what are we doing here?
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:20.240]  This is techno fascism, banning all conservatives, banning all Christians.
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:21.240]  This has got to stop.
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:25.080]  Now Mike, I know I got stoned 15 minutes late, but my next guest is great, but I think we
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:26.520]  can push him back 15 minutes.
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:30.360]  I want to come back and pull up the John Brennan clip from three years ago.
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:35.280]  I didn't even know about those on any Bravo's podcast and they pulled up Brennan, I'd seen
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:36.280]  the CFR report.
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:40.640]  I didn't know it was a speech he gave, where he admits we're geoengineering, we're aerosol
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:44.280]  spring, we're controlling the air, but we don't want to tell the public.
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:46.840]  And a few months ago I said I wanted to play that, we never did.
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:49.440]  I'll find it one way or another, it's all over YouTube.
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:53.360]  It's even in the 10 full hacks podcast I did with Eddie Bravo.
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:54.360]  You can't miss it.
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:56.680]  So can you do 15 minutes with us for the next hour?
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:57.680]  Yeah, yeah, of course.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:58.680]  No problem.
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:55:59.680]  Stay there.
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:00.680]  I don't want your next guest though.
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:01.680]  Whatever you want to do is fine.
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:02.680]  No, no, no.
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:03.680]  My next guest is great.
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:04.680]  It's a big film.
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:06.600]  He's gone with us for 45 minutes, he's cool.
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:07.600]  We're always 15 minutes behind.
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:11.720]  We're going to go to break, but when we come back, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:15.800]  get into all of this and what's really happening and the fact that there's a scientific breakaway
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:19.800]  group that Eisenhower warned us about that's gotten even more out of control and I can
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:23.440]  tell you personally, Trump and others don't like it.
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:27.040]  They're trying to get it back under the public's control and he wants to release all of it.
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:29.360]  Trump wants to just say, hey, guess what?
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:31.600]  You can live to 150 if you don't do X, Y and Z.
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:32.600]  Hey, guess what?
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:33.600]  We've got this.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:34.600]  Hey, guess what?
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:36.280]  We're literally freaking out.
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:37.600]  They've tried to block it from him.
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:41.840]  He's learning everything right now and it's incredible for the president.
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:43.280]  It's incredible for us.
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:47.720]  We're an amazing species and the elites found out about all this.
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:48.720]  We invented it all.
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:50.480]  They got really upset that we have all this.
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:51.480]  They don't want you to have it.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:53.720]  You're going to have it.
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:54.720]  You're going to have it.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:55.720]  We're going to go to break.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:57.220]  Come back with Mike Adams, naturalnews.com.
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:57:02.480]  Please don't forget, I'm in your hands and it's simple.
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:08.800]  You need turmeric, you need fish oil, you need a good, healthy, newtropic like Rainforest.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:10.000]  You need B12.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.480]  We have the strongest, highest quality B12 available, period.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:15.480]  It's medical grade.
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:18.120]  You just can't call it that because we're not selling it at a medical level.
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:19.120]  But it's the same stuff.
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:20.120]  You get it at the doctor.
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:21.120]  Don't inject it.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:22.120]  It's not approved for that.
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:25.920]  But that's the same stuff I get from my doctor for an ounce of it for 50 bucks.
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:26.920]  This is way more than that.
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:27.920]  Or more than that.
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:28.920]  That's hell.
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:30.420]  It's like a tenth of an ounce, 50 bucks.
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:36.400]  This is 2495, 50% off, double what Secret 12 had in it.

[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:50.880]  Stacy in the great state of Texas.
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:53.880]  In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacy.
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:55.120]  Good to talk to you.
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:58.640]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:57:59.760]  take vitamins at all.
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.720]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:06.040]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that that I
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:07.040]  trust.
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:08.720]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:11.840]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:12.840]  that are natural.
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:13.840]  I appreciate that.
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:14.840]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force?
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:15.840]  Tell us about it.
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:16.840]  Well, it's really great.
[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:17.840]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:18.840]  I take it.
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:19.840]  It tastes good.
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:20.840]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:22.840]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:25.960]  And you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:26.960]  it.
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:29.160]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:33.040]  They're known to turbo-charge women, and then we get the organic ones and put it in it.

[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:39.760]  Alright, if I'm bouncing off the walls, it's because everything I have been told by patriots
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:44.720]  in our government in direct contact with the president every day and messages sent directly
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:51.600]  to me by the president are that this is the real deal he's going to take action and here's
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:53.360]  why I know it's real.
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:57.920]  The enemy's response, my gut level analysis, but more importantly, why would you wreck
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:03.400]  the whole country and turn it into a civil war for the Chai Khans and the EU?
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:10.680]  From a pragmatic system, if your leaders aren't demons that just want to wreck everything,
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:15.160]  who actually want to run the big powerful system, why would you do that?
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:17.000]  So this is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.920]  It's going to get a lot rougher before it gets better.
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:21.440]  But I'm telling you, Trump is for real.
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:25.200]  And people like Ann Coulter go, oh my God, we've got triple illegal aliens ever flooding
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:26.200]  across.
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:27.520]  You know, that's 3D chess.
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:29.120]  This is the globalist assault.
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:31.520]  Trump's cut the funding off the Central America.
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:36.040]  He's trying to get 12 billion to stop it, he got a billion plus from the military.
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:39.120]  He should go further.
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:44.800]  But to say that Trump is the problem, well then Facebook and Twitter doesn't ban you.
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:49.640]  And I've invited Coulter on, but I think it's a cheap trick she's involved in, Mike Adams.
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:52.520]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:58.600]  I think, you know, she's basically it's a clickbait type of narrative to just get attention
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:02.920]  and cast blame on Trump when he is fighting all the evils of the world all at once.
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:04.840]  He's shouldering all of this all at once.
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:07.880]  And Ann Coulter was his biggest supporter during the election.
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:11.680]  She needs to understand that Trump isn't a dictator and he can't change policies just
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:13.240]  by waving his hand.
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:18.000]  Trump has to dismantle the deep state in order to get his agenda really accomplished.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:19.840]  And he's already started to do that.
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:23.600]  I know that he's going to be releasing a lot of these previously classified FISA warrant
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:24.600]  documents.
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:25.600]  For example, that's coming soon.
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:29.480]  We're going to see massive prosecutions of probably a dozen deep state insiders over
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:30.960]  the next 18 months.
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:31.960]  This is how you do it.
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:35.360]  You have to dismantle the deep state before you can actually get your agenda through.
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:41.880]  So Trump's second term will be on fire to be like rocket fuel for make America great
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:42.880]  again.
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:44.280]  This is why it's crucial to get Trump elected.
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:49.120]  And frankly, technically, we ought to give Trump an extra two years on top of his first
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:52.120]  term because the first two years were completely interfered with.
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:56.000]  I'll say this, you and I are anti-police state, but a police state doesn't mean we're anti-cop.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.480]  We're anti not having due process.
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:00.960]  The globalists have put us into this crisis.
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:03.480]  They're the ones getting rid of all the due process.
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:09.720]  And so if Trump and all of us have to then suspend everything to fix it, we're going
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:11.440]  to put it back the way it was.
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:12.520]  We're not the ones that brought us here.
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:16.880]  But sometimes when people put you into martial law, martial law has to fix it.
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:21.040]  Well, as I've said before, Trump had, we have this really rare opportunity where Trump has
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:24.560]  seized the power of the executive branch of government.
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:28.960]  Once in a lifetime opportunity, he needs to use the power of government to essentially
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:34.320]  dismantle or destroy the deep state elements that have turned government against us.
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:37.340]  So when you have the White House, you use it.
[02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:41.360]  But long term, we don't want big government ruling over all of our lives.
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:44.960]  We want more states rights, more 10th Amendment, smaller government, smaller budget.
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:50.000]  But is it not providence that right at this point, Trump got in?
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.120]  Well, yeah, it's biblical.
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:53.620]  It really is.
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:55.720]  There's so much going on here at so many levels.
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:58.560]  We're talking about the attempted annihilation of humanity.
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:04.000]  We're talking about the rise of actual Satanism or satanic influence, demonic influence into
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  the population.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.400]  There's a story out there right now.
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:12.760]  I think it's on the big league website, Politics, that a young boy who thinks he's transgender,
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:19.280]  a young man says he did a do it yourself surgical removal of part of my language, but his penis
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:24.080]  and his testicles in order to conform to the left wing agenda, which is what the hellbop
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:25.080]  cult did.
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:30.160]  It is this Satan cult of destroy your manhood, chop your balls off, take your Prozac, take
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:31.160]  your Ritalin.
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:32.160]  Exactly.
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:33.160]  I saw that.
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:34.160]  They are literally doing this now.
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:35.160]  They are insane.
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:36.160]  The left is a cult.
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:37.160]  They are dangerous.
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:38.160]  And they must be defeated.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:41.360]  Well, it's just like they have all these shows about girls committing suicide that makes
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:43.160]  girls commit suicide.
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:45.920]  Hollywood is a weapon system targeting the weak minded.
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:49.800]  Those of us that have not engaged in leadership have created the power vacuum that has allowed
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:50.800]  this.
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:56.280]  We now must take action.
[02:04:56.280 --> 02:04:58.480]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:01.440]  And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:08.360]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:09.360]  city.
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:13.000]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth, our major cities.
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:14.760]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:19.680]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now
[02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:28.480]  $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:31.400]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:34.760]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:39.160]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five star reviews for yourself.
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:41.160]  I've got two in my home.
[02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:46.320]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:47.320]  house.
[02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:51.960]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:52.960]  Have clean air.
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:54.960]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:59.960]  Well, I was summoned from Montgomery.
[02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:03.960]  I had my guitar on my back.
[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:08.600]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:12.800]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:19.320]  He said it's a long walk to Nashville, would you like to ride?
[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:25.720]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:26.720]  the Infowar.
[02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:33.160]  I sat down in the front seat and turned on the radio, and them sad old songs coming
[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:37.240]  out of them speakers was solid contrago.
[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:42.720]  And I noticed a stranger was ghost white, pale when he asked me for a light.
[02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:46.720]  And I knew there was something strange about this ride.
[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:51.720]  He said, Drifter, can you make folks cry when you play a song?
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:53.720]  Have you paid your dues?
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:55.720]  Can you mow the blues?
[02:06:55.720 --> 02:06:57.720]  Can you bend down guitar strings?
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:03.720]  He said, boy, can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
[02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:09.720]  Because if you big star bound, let me warn you, it's a long, long ride.
[02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:13.520]  All right, I wanted to get to this piece because we've talked about this song and you can just
[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:21.280]  type in Counsel and Farm Relations, geoengineering, Bill Gates funding, weather manipulation, exactly
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:26.960]  the patents we found, exactly the airlines don't even really know except the executives.
[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:30.920]  They had aluminum salts, barium.
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:34.520]  They had all this stuff to the engines and the gas.
[02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:35.720]  It's kerosene, basically.
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:37.440]  You think of jet fuel as explosive, it's not.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:46.720]  It's actually lighter burning than gasoline, and it aerosolizes and creates increased nuclei.
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:51.760]  So yes, it's actually ice crystals out behind, but there's nuclei in cloud seeding to create
[02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:52.760]  it.
[02:07:52.760 --> 02:07:58.240]  So I remember like, oh man, it was like 20 years ago I was getting calls.
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:02.200]  This one guy was running a DARPA program.
[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:05.680]  And he said, I can't tell you everything, but it's secret.
[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:10.480]  But these Doppler antennas were putting in around the country under a federal grant so
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:13.360]  the court, everybody has tornado watch.
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:17.680]  They said the power is 10 to 20 times what you need for Doppler.
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:20.880]  And they said, I don't know if I can say the guy's name, I shouldn't.
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:28.120]  He's actually been on the show, but the point is they're using it to fry the atmosphere
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:34.560]  with these aluminum dioxides and bariums and salts.
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:37.200]  And I'm like, okay, you're crazy.
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:40.040]  This is like 24 years ago I'm on air.
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:44.000]  And I've got guys that got engineering degrees pulling up, they're giving me all the stuff
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.320]  at the station.
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:51.200]  And then a decade later, Dubai has the exact same antenna arrays, and it says they're turning
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:54.640]  the desert green with these, and it's going on.
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:58.840]  I wanted to bring Mike Adams, who's an engineer and scientist about this, because I'm going
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:03.640]  to play this clip of John Brennan, former head of the CIA, Deep Stater, where they know
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:05.640]  they can't hide this anymore.
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:11.000]  So they then admit they've got it, they want to roll it out, they want to make it public,
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.480]  but other governments don't like it.
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:17.360]  Well, yeah, we have a treaty, so everything he's saying is knowing that the audience of
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:20.920]  actual controllers know what's happening.
[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:25.680]  And he's basically talking about the problems without saying the specifics of them.
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:27.680]  But when you know the facts, it's incredible.
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:29.200]  So I never knew this video existed.
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:33.320]  I knew that there were speeches he gave and others gave, cfr.org.
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:37.560]  But I didn't know he'd given the speech, so here's just part of it.
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:43.240]  Another example is the array of technologies, often referred to collectively as geoengineering,
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:47.600]  that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change.
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:53.560]  One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI.
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:57.480]  A method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:02.160]  heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do.
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:07.080]  An SAI program could limit global temperature increases, reducing some risks associated
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:11.600]  with higher temperatures, and providing the world economy additional time to transition
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:13.760]  from fossil fuels.
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:16.320]  This process is also relatively inexpensive.
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:21.080]  The National Research Council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program would cost about
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:24.120]  $10 billion yearly.
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:28.480]  As promising as it may be, moving forward on SAI would also raise a number of challenges
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:31.680]  for our government and for the international community.
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:36.560]  On the technical side, greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany SAI
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:42.560]  to address other climate change effects, such as ocean acidification, because SAI alone
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:46.240]  would not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:52.040]  On the geopolitical side, the technology's potential to alter weather patterns and benefit
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:57.560]  certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp opposition
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:10:59.760]  by some nations.
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:04.520]  Others might seize on SAI's benefits and back away from their commitment to carbon dioxide
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:06.120]  reductions.
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:10.480]  And as with other breakthrough technologies, global norms and standards are lacking to guide
[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:16.800]  the deployment and implementation of SAI and other geo-engineering initiatives.
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:22.160]  Now I could go on and on and on and on about the things that fascinate me, but rather than
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:26.840]  talk about them, I thought I'd stop here and start the conversation with Judy, and then
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:29.280]  I can take some of your questions.
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:34.200]  I very much appreciate the invitation to come back here in the Council of Correlations.
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:38.400]  Now I'm out in LA, I know about the transcripts of these meetings, I didn't know it was actually
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.400]  on C-SPAN.
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:42.480]  Caller's always calling me, why did you cover this?
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:47.280]  I'm not omnipresent, far from it.
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:52.680]  But we go to YouTube and it says, this isn't true, there's no geo-engineering, so that's
[02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:53.680]  the new fact deals.
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:57.680]  So here's the head of the CIA saying we're doing it, they put a factoid saying it's a
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:02.640]  conspiracy, it doesn't exist, you guys found it, put it back up there.
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:08.240]  So this is what we're talking about, Mike Adams, the insanity of the level that they
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:12.960]  don't want us to have a debate about this, it's already going on, wow.
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:17.400]  Yeah, look, when John Brennan says it, it's genius science.
[02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:22.540]  If you or I say the same thing, stratospheric aerosol injection, then we are labeled conspiracy
[02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:24.280]  theorists and fake news.
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:27.000]  So it's this bubble.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:32.440]  And remember, this stratospheric aerosol injection, this is a global dimming initiative
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:36.920]  to block the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth, which means you're blocking sunlight
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:42.040]  from reaching food crops, which means you're going to slow down photosynthesis of all food
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:47.440]  crops all around the world, which means you're going to lead to global starvation, famine,
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:48.560]  food supply disruptions.
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:55.320]  This is the weaponization of famine and starvation worldwide, among other things, to make people
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:13:01.080]  dependent on government FEMA camp rescues just to get your food rashes.
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:06.440]  And by the way, Alex, if they do this, if they push all this pollution into the atmosphere
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:12.520]  and then there is a volcanic erupt that happens, the volcanic erupt is like an adjuvant, it
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:13.680]  makes it 10 times worse.
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:15.080]  So let's stop right there.
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:16.080]  Exactly.
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:20.280]  They already admit respiratory problems, aluminum, the soils, 12 times what it was,
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:23.720]  the open borders, they're trying to collapse society is what you're saying.
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:24.720]  They admit it.
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:27.760]  They're collapsing the damn atmosphere.
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:29.360]  It is terraforming, Alex.
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:30.480]  It's terraforming.
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:36.680]  I've said this before, it's terraforming to prepare Earth for the post-human era.
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:39.920]  And whatever you want to think that is, there's a lot of theories out there, but it's clear
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:44.840]  that they do not want humanity to survive and they're willing to devastate every food
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:48.120]  web, every ecosystem on the planet in order to accomplish that.
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:49.480]  It's more day farming.
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:50.480]  It's death-forming.
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:51.480]  Yeah.
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:55.600]  Look, they are a death cult, and John Brennan is part of that death cult.
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:58.080]  Look at what he did to try to destroy our republic.
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:13:59.720]  Look at what he did to President Trump.
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:01.280]  And of course, he's endorsing.
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:05.400]  He's talking about how much he loves this idea of polluting the atmosphere.
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:11.720]  So the Green New Deal really is about pollution and death and mass starvation, which would
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:14.320]  cause mass disease outbreaks to follow.
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:18.680]  And by the way, in cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, there's so much homelessness,
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:20.480]  needles, and human feces in the streets.
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:26.040]  They're going to start having sort of 19th century disease outbreaks any day now anyway.
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:27.040]  And people ask.
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:28.040]  People have done it some way.
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:29.880]  People ask, why is it every blue city?
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:34.040]  Folks, you read the WikiLeaks, collapse of society, collapse of free market, clowered
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:35.040]  and pivot.
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:40.720]  They can't compete with a Judeo-Christian model, open free society, wealth, free market
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:41.720]  competition.
[02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:47.520]  So they're sabotaging it while the megabanks are offshore, tax exempt, Apple, Google, they're
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:48.760]  all exempt.
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:50.760]  They are wrecking society.
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:52.360]  They are psychotics.
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:53.560]  They can't help it.
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:56.040]  And great job Mike Adams exposing all this.
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:57.040]  It's biblical.
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:58.800]  As you said, it's happening now.
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:04.780]  We just showed total proof with the head of the CIA, former head admitting a giant geo
[02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:08.720]  engineering program, not for good for bad, but that they don't want to admit it because
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:11.320]  other governments would complain.
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:17.120]  This is WeatherWeapons, naturalnews.com, news that your life depends on.
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:18.120]  My life depends on.
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:19.120]  Thank you, Mike Adams.
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:20.120]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:21.120]  Good to join you.
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:22.120]  All right.
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:25.520]  We're going to come back with a filmmaker who has put out a film that I'm very impressed
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:28.200]  with, and I'm in it, but that's the reason I'm promoting it.
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:31.640]  It's a very important free speech film, amazing clips coming up.
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:34.400]  Please don't forget without you, we're not on air.
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:37.000]  On local AM and FM, support those local stations.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:38.480]  On shortwave, support them.
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:43.440]  On internet, infowars.com, forward slash show, you override the globalist.
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:44.440]  That's not talk.
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:45.440]  That's not a slogan.
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:46.440]  That's reality.
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:49.160]  It's the most banned show in the world for a reason.
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:50.160]  We're pro-human.
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:51.160]  We're pro-god.
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:52.160]  We're pro-baby.

[02:15:54.160 --> 02:16:02.080]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:03.080]  Forget bunkers.
[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:04.800]  You're not a live underground gopher.

[02:16:56.240 --> 02:17:00.160]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:01.680]  I sued the IRS in one.
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:04.640]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.

[02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:15.920]  You can watch this.com.
[02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:16.920]  You may be an ambassador to England or France.
[02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:17.920]  You may like to gamble.
[02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:18.920]  You might like to dance.
[02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:19.920]  You may be the heavyweight king.
[02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:37.920]  You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls, but you're going to have to serve
[02:20:37.920 --> 02:20:38.920]  somebody.
[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:39.920]  You can't watch this.com.
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:40.920]  You're going to have to serve somebody.
[02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:47.920]  Taylor Robertson is a great documentary filmmaker and a political activist.
[02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:52.920]  And I know he's working with George on this to put out this film.
[02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:55.920]  And they first interviewed me like six, eight months ago, a few months ago again.
[02:20:55.920 --> 02:20:58.920]  I'm like, okay, you guys are good guys.
[02:20:58.920 --> 02:20:59.920]  Make your film.
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:00.920]  And I saw it a few weeks ago.
[02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:01.920]  It's not out yet.
[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:02.920]  It comes out Wednesday.
[02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:03.920]  I was like, wow, this is powerful.
[02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:04.920]  Plus, it's perfect timing.
[02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:05.920]  I was telling them this weekend.
[02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:06.920]  I'm like, just perfect time.
[02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:09.920]  And they go, well, we're going to release it in a month or so.
[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:13.920]  But we think now with all the platforming, this is the time.
[02:21:13.920 --> 02:21:18.920]  You've got a lot of people watching, Tommy Robinson, you've got myself in it.
[02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:19.920]  Alex Jones.
[02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:23.920]  You've got so many other people like Laura Loomer.
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:25.920]  They're all in there, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:28.920]  You can't watch this.com.
[02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:33.920]  And I guess you can go rent it or watch it starting Wednesday at you can't watch this.com.
[02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:34.920]  It's on Vimeo.
[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:35.920]  You name it.
[02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:38.920]  I guess they say in a week or so it'll be on Amazon.
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:40.920]  And look, I used to make documentaries.
[02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:42.920]  I used to have time for it.
[02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:43.920]  I'm on radio.
[02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:44.920]  I'm on TV.
[02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:45.920]  We're fighting hard here.
[02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:48.920]  But I'm really glad they made this because it gets into what's really happening, what
[02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:49.920]  the platforming is about.
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:52.920]  This is the type of film that can help win the culture war.
[02:21:52.920 --> 02:21:53.920]  We're going to play some clips here.
[02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:54.920]  We're going to play the trailer.
[02:21:54.920 --> 02:22:00.920]  We're going to have one of the producers and co-directors on about all this.
[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:06.600]  But censoredmovie.com is the Vimeo and demand page, censoredmovie.com.
[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:09.480]  You can't watch this.com is the website.
[02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:16.560]  Twitter at censorshipmovie, YouTube censorshipmovie, and just a lot of amazing trailers, a lot
[02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:17.560]  of amazing stuff.
[02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:23.000]  I can't wait to see it because what I saw, I said two weeks ago, it was like actually
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:24.760]  a month ago, was a rough cut.
[02:22:24.760 --> 02:22:28.360]  I'm told it's even been augmented or whatever because I saw some stuff in the trailer and
[02:22:28.360 --> 02:22:31.560]  some of the clips they put out that wasn't in the film or maybe some of the stuff in
[02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:32.760]  the clips isn't in the film.
[02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:33.760]  I don't know.
[02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:36.280]  I'm a busy, busy beaver as everybody knows.
[02:22:36.280 --> 02:22:38.400]  But we're going to Kailin in a moment.
[02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:40.920]  Here is the trailer for You Can't Watch This.
[02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:41.920]  Here it is.
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:48.920]  Tonight, we present this special report on social media exclusion, who calls Zuckerberg's
[02:22:48.920 --> 02:22:51.920]  power unprecedented and un-American.
[02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:55.600]  Listen, this is not just targeting one side of the political spectrum.
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:23:01.000]  This is the first time that the High Court will examine free speech rights and social
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.000]  media.
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:03.000]  This is a monopoly.
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.600]  There is no competition and there's no accountability.
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:10.440]  Facebook or Google are not government actors, so the First Amendment does not speak to their
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:11.440]  conduct.
[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:18.800]  Certain voices and messages should be excluded from their platforms.
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:20.280]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:25.280]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:29.200]  This is not a lifestyle for people who are weak-minded.
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:31.120]  I mean, I didn't just get depressed.
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:35.040]  I felt straight up suicidal.
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:42.440]  Very soon, time soon, then the relocation of my family will be needed.
[02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:47.080]  I wake up the first thing I do before I talk to anyone, before I turn on my phone, is go
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:50.000]  on my YouTube channel and make sure it's still there.
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:57.520]  I mean, I lost my job, I lost my social media platforms, I lost my vocation in a sense.
[02:23:57.520 --> 02:24:03.960]  If we don't fight back and if we don't do something soon, I'm worried that we may fall.
[02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:09.280]  We may lose what makes this country great and that is the fact that we have free speech.
[02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:15.040]  The government cannot broadly restrict anything that it might label hate speech, but platforms
[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:16.040]  can if they wish to.
[02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:20.040]  Let's talk about YouTube, the second biggest search engine in the world.
[02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:24.920]  The more they try and censor the people who are the alternative, the more frustration
[02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:26.040]  they will build against them.
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:30.680]  A progressive publisher fears those on the left like her may soon face the very same
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:31.680]  hurdles as conservatives.
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:35.760]  Time is used as the strawman.
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:41.920]  Once the public took the bait, took the hook in their mouth, then everyone else would
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:43.600]  agree that we'd fall.
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:45.960]  We were winning.
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:46.960]  We're losing.
[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:54.320]  Well, we're losing the battle, we're winning the war and we're going to do a bunch of clips
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:57.640]  from the film coming up, but Kailin Robertson, thanks for joining us.
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:01.040]  Very excited because I remember being involved with the film back, it seemed like six, eight
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:02.040]  months ago.
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:03.040]  I don't remember when you first came.
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:04.040]  Maybe a year ago.
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:05.040]  I don't remember.
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:06.040]  And then now the film's out.
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:07.040]  So congratulations.
[02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:08.040]  It's powerful.
[02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:09.040]  Oh, thanks so much.
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:10.960]  It's so nice watching the trailer then on your show.
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:14.640]  It was painstaking putting it all together, but the timing, you're right, the timing is
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:16.800]  perfect for this.
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:20.200]  It's all been heating up in the last few months, you know, with Luma being mentioned by Trump
[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:27.920]  only 48 hours ago, Trump talking about people like Lawrence Southern and you and Info Wars
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:33.000]  and basically exactly what the documentary is about, which is incredible and the whole
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:39.600]  process was really, really powerful, sort of telling the story the right way, telling
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:40.600]  it properly.
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:41.600]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:48.280]  This has never actually been told before in this way, you know, in the U.K. especially,
[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:50.360]  and a lot of the time in the U.S., this...
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:55.440]  Everyone just follows the official lying narrative that we're all Nazis, so you don't dare let
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:56.440]  us talk.
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:58.640]  Now, you're going to have the floor of the next two segments, my friend.
[02:25:58.640 --> 02:25:59.920]  It's already getting you on late.
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:00.920]  But just...
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:01.920]  People want to know the problem.
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:02.920]  It's the film.
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:03.920]  Who's producing it?
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:04.920]  Who's making it?
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:05.920]  I've known you a few years, but I'm just a guest.
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:06.920]  Know your great filmmakers.
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:07.920]  I did it.
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:10.720]  People are asking me about the film, how long it is, what version is coming out.
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:12.720]  Just tell us about the film itself, though.
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:13.720]  Right.
[02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:17.960]  So the film, it's an hour long, so it was directed by George Welling John.
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:21.600]  He's been making movies with people like Tommy Robinson and at about the right for years
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:22.600]  now.
[02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:25.320]  It's produced by myself and I've been doing the same sort of thing for years.
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:30.840]  This is our biggest film so far and it's like the most sort of proper budget, really serious
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:32.120]  film we've ever done.
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:36.600]  Looks at five controversial figures who are conservatives who have been basically banned
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:40.840]  on the Internet exactly what happened, exactly why they were banned, what the impact was
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:41.840]  on them.
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:46.640]  It's basically the first time ever a film looks at this issue in this way.
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:50.920]  And that's basically what it's about.
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:57.400]  And I said, I said a few weeks ago, but it was actually, I guess a month ago, the film
[02:26:57.400 --> 02:27:01.560]  I watched was excellent, but I've seen some clips in the promos that I didn't see in the
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:02.560]  film.
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:07.440]  So was what I saw a final cut or is it even better than what I saw?
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:09.320]  So the one you saw was pretty much a final cut.
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:11.120]  We did make some adjustments in the clips.
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:14.600]  We do have some of the clips are sort of exclusives.
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:17.480]  Some of the clips are scenes that we didn't put in the film.
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:20.640]  Some are extended at the extended edition sort of clips.
[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:24.840]  So we wanted to, you know, we wanted to save a lot of the really good stuff for the actual
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:25.840]  core of the film.
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:29.400]  And then a lot of the stuff that we want to put out in the meantime is sort of the extended
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:31.240]  bits and the bits that didn't make it to the final cut.
[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:33.440]  So there's loads and loads and loads of material.
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:34.440]  Sure.
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:36.240]  Just to be clear, and I'm not apologizing.
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:37.240]  I'm not prepared.
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:39.160]  It's kind of cool to fly by the seat of our pants.
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:43.080]  I haven't talked to you except for this weekend a few minutes and then in a couple of weeks.
[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:44.080]  I just wasn't sure.
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:46.560]  I just saw the film I saw was awesome.
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:51.120]  You told me that you guys had done a few, I guess, edits or upgrades, so all I know is
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:52.680]  the film I saw was amazing.
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:56.080]  I can't wait to see the film that's about to be released Wednesday.
[02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:58.640]  Yeah, no, it is amazing.
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:00.280]  People have never seen Paul like this before.
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:01.880]  You know, this is his first proper interview.
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:03.880]  People have never seen Gavin like this before.
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:07.480]  It's that the right has never looked like Hollywood before.
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:10.800]  I was about to say, look, look, I'm not gay or anything.
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:15.840]  It's kind of like that joke that the famous basketball player met the famous NFL player
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:17.880]  and he said, well, I'm not gay because we handsome.
[02:28:17.880 --> 02:28:21.640]  People get to see how big and tall and masculine Paul is in the film.
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:24.200]  Joe, would you see him behind that map?
[02:28:24.200 --> 02:28:25.200]  Always.
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:28.760]  Well, when people saw him in the trailer walking around like that outside, there were shops.
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:29.960]  They were like, what's he doing outside?
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:30.960]  This is a this is crazy.
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:33.000]  You know, he looked, he looks totally different.
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.640]  And there's loads of that in the film as well, where he is, you know, goes to the park.
[02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:37.640]  He's reflecting.
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:40.960]  He's going around talking about how he feels with behind the scenes, behind the set.
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:41.960]  It looks totally different.
[02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:42.960]  It sounds totally different.
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:46.520]  I've been saying so far, that's the initial reaction, which is all right, since the movie
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:47.520]  dot com.
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:48.680]  Let's get the clips of it straight ahead.
[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:50.720]  The sensors are going to hate this.
[02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:51.720]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:55.240]  Stay with us.

[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:08.880]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:09.960]  my life.
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:15.240]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.

[02:32:43.400 --> 02:32:47.200]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half packet the
[02:32:47.200 --> 02:32:51.240]  first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you
[02:32:51.240 --> 02:32:52.240]  into overdrive.
[02:32:52.240 --> 02:32:53.240]  TurboForce at InfowarsLive.com.
[02:32:53.240 --> 02:33:19.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.920 --> 02:33:24.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:26.440]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:40.880]  Well so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:40.880 --> 02:33:55.920]  So there is a glut, an oversupply of like sand in the desert or blue sky when you're
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:01.480]  walking through the desert of movies and TV shows and productions.
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:06.960]  Everybody in this voyeur society believes you become somebody by being watched.
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:12.080]  And of course here I am with a show to be watched, but I got into this because they
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:17.120]  were trying to take our guns and our private property, but I actually have beliefs and
[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:19.360]  I'm trying to push.
[02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:26.160]  But imagine out of all the thousands of programs, all the thousands of shows, I've had Netflix
[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:36.920]  and HBO and I mean producers for HBO, people that have been Oscar winners come here before
[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:39.680]  the band during the band and say, how do we do a movie with you?
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:40.680]  How do we do a show?
[02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:42.680]  And I say, you'll be censored.
[02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:44.000]  I say, go pitch your show.
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.600]  Well, I've got a lot of clout.
[02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:53.360]  I was married to such and such and I've spent, I've had $500 million in production the last
[02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:59.760]  few years at HBO and as soon as they bring it up, they're told no to Alex Jones.
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:03.360]  So everyone's too scared to even put me in a film that isn't completely negative.
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:08.080]  That's why when I was on international Turkish television today, it was just all negative
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:09.080]  talking points.
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:10.080]  We're going to air that later.
[02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:14.880]  I think we have the clip and maybe if our guest leaves us, we'll play it.
[02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:19.480]  But that's just the attitude, this unified fear in media that now there's more media
[02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:20.640]  than ever.
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:24.640]  It makes media less valuable because everyone is conforming.
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:27.760]  So I don't know the nuts and bolts of you filmmakers.
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:28.760]  I knew who you were.
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:29.760]  You made some good films.
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:30.760]  So I sat for it.
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:36.520]  But Kailin Robertson, YouCan'tWatchThis.com, the new film coming out Wednesday.
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:37.520]  When does it drop?
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:38.520]  How do we see it?
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:40.520]  Because you made the point up front.
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:42.840]  Why has this not already been made?
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:44.920]  This censorship has been going on a few years.
[02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:45.920]  It's perfect timing.
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:49.320]  You guys have this ready now, but what spurred you to do this?
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:53.200]  You know, I know your partner in this is a little more liberal than you.
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:56.360]  He asked me some hard questions during interviews the last two times.
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:35:58.280]  Now he seems more won over.
[02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:00.720]  And again, it's not, you have to agree with me to be in your film.
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:01.920]  You just seem like real guys.
[02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:02.920]  So I did it.
[02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:03.920]  Yeah.
[02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:08.320]  Well, an important part of being a filmmaker is telling stories about things that are happening
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:09.320]  in the real world.
[02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:12.400]  I've covered stories on the ground in, you know, one of the documentaries I've made
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:16.400]  recently was in, filmed in nine different countries, filming human traffickers, sending
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:19.920]  migrants across the border, getting arrested by the Turkish military was something that
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:22.920]  happened to me a few months ago for doing journalism there.
[02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:26.200]  And I didn't do that to get it to, you know, to, to do anything in politics.
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:28.240]  I did that because it wasn't being told.
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:33.040]  And this is exactly why we decided to do this film because it's a massive, massive issue
[02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:36.920]  like the human trafficking like the stuff we've done before, but there's never been a production
[02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:37.920]  about it.
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:38.920]  There's never been.
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:41.440]  And obviously it's because one of the main reasons is, is, is what you said about people
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:45.240]  who have come along and they'll get, they'll get censored and producers will, will not
[02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:46.240]  allow them to go ahead.
[02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:49.680]  But another reason a lot of filmmakers don't do this is because they don't win awards
[02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:52.720]  for D. You know, look at the Oscars, look at, look at Sundance, look at all the film
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:53.720]  awards that happen.
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:56.920]  None of them go to films that would ever be sympathetic towards this.
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:00.440]  The last one was Moonlight, which was, you know, a film about, I think it's like a gay
[02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:05.160]  Muslim and his lived experience in, in America.
[02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:07.760]  And those are the films that will always win awards and will always get pushed.
[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:11.440]  So young filmmakers starting out are going to go and do that kind of stuff.
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:14.160]  But the reason we did it is because we really think that the stories that aren't being
[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:15.760]  told need to be told.
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:20.200]  And this is the fundamental, most important story in America in 2019.
[02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:23.320]  And it will be in 2020 as well, because it's election meddling.
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:27.680]  And it's about, it's, it's, it's, it's making people disappear.
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:28.680]  It's what the Soviets did.
[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:32.720]  You know, if you walk down a corridor in the Soviet Union in the, you know, the 1910s
[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:37.680]  or, or in the 1800s, there's been all sorts of regimes where you'd walk down a corridor
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:42.760]  and you'd see all of the paintings and the portraits of all of the members of government
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:46.440]  20 years later, walk down the same corridor, the same paintings are there, but the faces
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:47.440]  have been blurred out.
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:48.440]  You see this in the textbooks as well.
[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:52.600]  I don't know if you, if you have any examples of this, but the exact same thing is what's
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:55.880]  happening now, you know, with people becoming immediately unpersoned, Gavin's face can't
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:38:00.280]  be shown on Instagram anymore, saying with Tommy, saying with you.
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:04.360]  But whenever something like this happens in a society, whenever something crazy happens
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:08.240]  or massive, usually you'll, about a few months later or two or a few years later, you have
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:16.600]  a slew of high profile, high budget TV networks and mainstream movies make content about it.
[02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:20.000]  This is the first time that hasn't really happened before.
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.080]  And we just thought this is so important.
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:24.360]  And there's, there's a huge number of people who want to watch it as well.
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:28.520]  I mean, there's a huge number of people who need to see it and who want to see it.
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:33.040]  And unfortunately in the UK and a lot of time in the US outside of info wars, the only people
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:37.240]  on the right who work in the media and who make movies, use their phones, use little
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:38.880]  camera phones and things like that.
[02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:40.280]  And that's fine.
[02:38:40.280 --> 02:38:46.520]  But it doesn't always get the message across to change culture when you don't have production
[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:47.520]  value production.
[02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:51.160]  And you really, you really humanize what's happening when we have to hold you a little
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:52.160]  bit over.
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:54.320]  We got Gerald Slunday coming up, but I want to get to all these clips.
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:58.720]  The film, what time specifically does it drop Wednesday?
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:03.760]  Like Grinch, meantime, when, when, when can people see this verboten film?
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:06.120]  You can't watch this.com.
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:11.000]  So it'll be 3pm Eastern standard times will be 3pm's and then sort of across America.
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:12.800]  I think that's sort of three, four or five.
[02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:16.240]  So it'll basically be late afternoon across the whole of the, across the whole of the
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:20.940]  US is when, as when the film will be dropping on the, on the 15th of May.
[02:39:20.940 --> 02:39:22.320]  So you can pre-order it now.
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:23.680]  You can, you can pre-order to buy it.
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:27.480]  You can pre-order to rent it and then you'll get a notification as soon as it pops up.
[02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:29.480]  And I want to be clear.
[02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:31.640]  I want to be clear.
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:32.880]  This is our real story.
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:35.560]  This is people actually, and you do it very fairly show both sides.
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:38.280]  This is a real film about the attack on free speech.
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:39.520]  People need to support this.
[02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:40.720]  They need to go there.
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:41.720]  They need to watch it.
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:45.920]  We need to send it right to the top to let the system know that attacks on free speech
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:46.920]  won't be put up with.
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:48.200]  We're going to come back and play some of these clips.
[02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:50.240]  But before we do that, take Laura Lemmer.
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:54.840]  She was on last week and she's an individual activist.
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:58.640]  She did some of the best work at Project Veritas infiltrating groups, which is scary
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:39:59.640]  to do.
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:00.640]  I've done that myself.
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:04.840]  And, you know, she was crying about being kicked off Uber and Uber Eats and being kicked
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:11.200]  off of bank accounts and being kicked off all the social media networks and being kicked
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:12.600]  off all these things.
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:15.920]  And people made jokes and like, oh, you're kicked off these things.
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:18.240]  The young Turks get money from Gulf War dictatorships.
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:22.920]  They make $100 million a year, you know, something like, I think even Sink makes that himself.
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:26.480]  I mean, these are like rich sellouts that no one even watches.
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:31.120]  And they make fun of a woman who gets arrested and beat up and does all these things.
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:36.520]  I just think it's incredibly cowardly because I smiled when she was crying on air out of
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:37.760]  uncomfortableness.
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:38.920]  I wasn't making fun of her.
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:41.880]  You know, Drudge ended up linking to the interview last week.
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:43.120]  I wasn't making fun of Laura.
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:48.680]  I was smiling because it was so shocking or crying and saying she was suicidal.
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:53.560]  But you know, I mean, this is real.
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:57.040]  And people that haven't been through this level of persecution, they don't know what
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:40:58.040]  it's like.
[02:40:58.040 --> 02:40:59.240]  So they shouldn't make jokes about it.
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:07.400]  Well, Laura is a 25-year-old girl, basically, trying to tell the stories that she sees happening
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:08.960]  around her in America.
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:13.880]  And she's been laughed at and ridiculed for talking about feeling genuinely suicidal and
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:18.440]  genuinely feeling like her life is totally over, laughed at by verified Twitter accounts
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:20.800]  by journalists who didn't get suspended.
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:24.800]  One of them, one of them said that they would laugh if she was hanging from a tree outside
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:28.400]  Twitter headquarters and they didn't get suspended.
[02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:32.880]  And she's depressed because I knew her six months ago, two years ago.
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:34.840]  She kept thinking, oh, we'll fight this.
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:36.040]  People stand up.
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:38.040]  She's shocked at how far they've gone.
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:39.880]  She's shocked at how bully-ish they are.
[02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:40.880]  Oh, yeah.
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:44.200]  And she knows exactly how all of this works, and even she didn't anticipate it.
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:47.720]  And it's going to happen to loads more people like Laura and loads more people not like
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:52.160]  Laura either, far more liberal or far more towards the center from Laura as well.
[02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:55.320]  It's going to be happening to everybody, but it was really heartbreaking what happened
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:56.320]  to her.
[02:41:56.320 --> 02:41:58.840]  You know, if you're a journalist, Gavin said this in the documentary, but halfway through,
[02:41:58.840 --> 02:42:02.720]  he said, if you're a journalist and someone hands you a typewriter and says, sorry, you
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:06.120]  don't have access to a computer anymore, but you can write out some of your reports on
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:10.160]  a typewriter now and, you know, you can hand them to people in the street, you're not going
[02:42:10.160 --> 02:42:11.160]  to have a career as a journalist.
[02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:12.160]  It's not going to work.
[02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:14.160]  And the same thing's basically been forced into all of this stuff.
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:15.160]  Well, sure.
[02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:18.920]  And I watched the young Turks named after an anti-Christian genocide organization funded
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:24.960]  by Qatar and Gulf War States, and they just lick their lips and say, you're shut up now.
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:26.160]  You're nobody.
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:27.160]  And they laugh.
[02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:28.280]  And they're so un-American.
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:30.280]  They're so authoritarian.
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:34.480]  And it's like, wow, you really are dirtbags.
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:38.240]  We'll be right back to play some of these clips with our guests.
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:42.320]  The film, ladies and gentlemen, is going to come out in a few days.
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:44.320]  You can't watch this.com.
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:47.480]  CensoredMovie.com is where you download it or sign up to see it first.
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:50.480]  It's an act of revolution to spread the word about this film.
[02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:51.480]  You'll be back.
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:55.960]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:43:00.960]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman and child that has supported this broadcast
[02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:02.960]  over the years and that has stood with us.
[02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:07.080]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates, but I'll tell you like
[02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:10.880]  it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:12.360]  You're our only sponsors.
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:16.400]  And when you don't buy the products, they're absolutely the best out there.
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:18.800]  We aren't able to continue on.
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:21.160]  So remember, you are the InfoWare.
[02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:22.280]  I'm not the leader.
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:23.280]  You are the leader.
[02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:25.080]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:30.480]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:35.320]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board,
[02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:38.160]  it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:43.840]  So I want to thank you for your support and I want to encourage you again, go to InfoWareStore.com
[02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:45.920]  for whatever the product is you need.
[02:43:45.920 --> 02:43:49.240]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:51.240]  Thank you for making InfoWare possible.
[02:43:51.240 --> 02:43:55.240]  God bless you.
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:43:59.160]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:03.680]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:09.120]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:14.520]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:16.040]  to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:22.560]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:26.560]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:27.960]  in the rainwater.
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:33.280]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:39.360]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:45.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:50.320]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:56.080]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:56.080 --> 02:45:00.280]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators.
[02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:01.280]  They are technocrats.
[02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:05.120]  They are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:09.640]  own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge
[02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:10.640]  with AI gods.
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:12.880]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:16.520]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension, but one of the biggest places
[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:21.800]  that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:27.040]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from forestlife.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:31.400]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:37.120]  medical bottom and double the strength of it in a new formula, ultra 12.
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:41.920]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:42.920]  going to find anywhere.
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:47.800]  It is amazing experience pure medical bottom and B12 for yourself and fund the second
[02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:54.040]  American Revolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com or triple
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:56.440]  a 253-3139.
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:00.520]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, they can food during the falls they have it
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:01.520]  during the winter.
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:08.280]  And that's what I'm talking about at infowarsstore.com, with infowars select, it's the full spectrum
[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:13.600]  of my patriot supply on the top most respected companies out there, but because I private
[02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:19.480]  label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able
[02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:20.480]  to do.
[02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:24.440]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:25.440]  win-win.
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:31.360]  We have those incredible sell prices back infowarsstore.com, on infowars select, storeable foods, they've
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:36.280]  got special diet foods, they've got three month supplies, your supplies, weak emergency
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:40.480]  supplies, they've got so many great products there, and you've got a three year supply.

[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:59.440]  infowarsstore.com and infowars select, high-quality storeable foods, powered by my patriot supply.
[02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:24.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:30.800]  Turkish Runs State Media has its number one show called The Newsmakers, and we looked it
[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:31.800]  up.
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:35.320]  It is arguably the biggest show in Turkey, which is very influential, the old Heart of
[02:47:35.320 --> 02:47:41.400]  the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople taken over by the Islamist now Istanbul, and they
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:43.240]  said, oh, it's just him in an interview.
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:48.040]  I go on there, it is leftist talking points right down the line, and I told you, we taped
[02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:54.920]  it, the Skype perspective for 30 minutes, and I said, if they edited it or jacked with
[02:47:54.920 --> 02:48:01.760]  it, I'll air ours, but if they're honorable, and actually, it's on right now, it's on
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:06.040]  cable systems, TV all over the world, if they don't jack with it, then there's no really
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:07.040]  point to that.
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:11.680]  I'll probably go through it and show the evidence of what I said, but that's going on right
[02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:12.680]  now.
[02:48:12.680 --> 02:48:20.800]  Okay, going back to filmmaker, Kaylin Robertson, Twitter at Kaylin Robb, you can't watch this
[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:21.800] .com.
[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:24.960]  Look, I know you guys are great filmmakers, but I was very impressed three weeks ago,
[02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:29.320]  a month ago, when you guys sent me the private link to the film, and then I know you were
[02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:34.480]  paying them a few weeks to have it out, but now you're rushing it out this Wednesday,
[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:35.600]  less than 48 hours.
[02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:36.920]  Why are you doing that?
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:40.320]  Well, everything's heating up, everything is crazy right now.
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:43.560]  Trump has just been talking about Laura Loomer, Trump has been talking directly about you
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:47.400]  guys, and people need to see this right now.
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:49.240]  I mean, there's so much going on.
[02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:52.240]  Michelle Malkin, I think her name is from CRTV, she was banned on Facebook.
[02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:55.280]  Yes, she came out and defended this and got censored by Facebook.
[02:48:55.280 --> 02:48:59.280]  Exactly, it's all happening right now, and people need to see it as soon as possible,
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:02.480]  and this is the reason we made the film, so that people can see it, and people can see
[02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:05.400]  this perspective, because right now, they can't see your perspective, they can't see
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:09.400]  Michelle's perspective, they can't see Loomer or Gavin or Tommy Robinson or any of these
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:14.320]  people's perspective, and this movie exactly tells those perspectives, more than anything
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:15.320]  else.
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:19.120]  And it's not a political film, it's not an activist film, it's a story that literally
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:22.720]  just tells the truth, it tells your truth, it tells Tommy's truth, it tells the truth
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:25.640]  to the people who have been wiped off the internet in the last few weeks, and that's
[02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:29.120]  why it needs to be sped up, because right now, the only people who are telling these stories,
[02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:33.360]  the only people who are telling Tommy's story or your story are journalists on Twitter, are
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:34.360]  journalists on Facebook.
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:35.360]  That's the key.
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:39.240]  They don't just silence you, they allow liars to say whatever they want.
[02:49:39.240 --> 02:49:43.560]  Well I endorsed this film, I haven't made a film in ten years, and you guys are great
[02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:47.920]  filmmakers, and I hope to work with you now, I'm really impressed with what you've done,
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:51.800]  and I know you put a lot of money into this, and it isn't about money, but folks, this
[02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:55.680]  film, everybody needs to buy it or rent it, you need to have viewing parties, you need
[02:49:55.680 --> 02:50:04.160]  to share it, this is the first group to, in the last year of censorship, that wasn't
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:09.160]  scared to do this, and I'm sure there'll be some punishment, I'm sure there'll be some
[02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:15.480]  retribution, who knows what it'll be, because you fairly look at it, and you even ask some
[02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:19.800]  serious questions of us, but that's what we're looking for, we're real people.
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:24.640]  I just hope that everyone, you know, doesn't have an eight minute or 72nd or 12 second
[02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:28.920]  attention span, like the Democrats and globalists hope you do, I hope you remember, this film
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:33.560]  is coming out, 3PM Central, you can't watch this, it's the name of the film, you can't
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:39.120]  watch this.com, you find it at censoredmovie.com, is where you can sign up to watch it on your
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:44.960]  big screen TV and HD or on your phone or whatever, and here's the key, DVD's making a comeback
[02:50:44.960 --> 02:50:49.360]  all of a sudden, I got called about two weeks ago by some factories we made DVD's with
[02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:53.400]  years ago, they said, Alex, have you seen the numbers, because of censorship, people
[02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:57.880]  instinctively get, they want to hold on to it, not have it on the cloud, and so suddenly
[02:50:57.880 --> 02:51:05.240]  memory space, HD cards, whatever, are all exploding again, people are getting, you want
[02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:10.000]  to hold on to this, so people can go download their own copy, save it how they want, that's
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:13.000]  a key record of what's going on here.
[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:17.000]  Oh yeah, people are going straight back to that, and they should, they should go straight
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.640]  back to it, because the internet could be totally different in five years, all of it
[02:51:19.640 --> 02:51:23.440]  could be completely wiped, like the Soviet Union analogy, walking through the corridors,
[02:51:23.440 --> 02:51:26.400]  the internet as it was two years ago, doesn't look anything like it does now, and it's not
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:30.520]  going to look like that soon, so if you can get your hands on anything like that, especially,
[02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:34.160]  you know, this movie's going to have a DVD coming out very, very soon, you'll be able
[02:51:34.160 --> 02:51:35.160]  to pre-order.
[02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:36.160]  Oh, hold on.
[02:51:36.160 --> 02:51:41.440]  Okay, see, like I said, I don't, there isn't, okay, good, a DVD, tell me about that.
[02:51:41.440 --> 02:51:44.800]  So we're going to be putting together a DVD, we're just finishing up the last few, finishing
[02:51:44.800 --> 02:51:50.160]  touches for that, specifically for why, for the reason you just mentioned, which is that
[02:51:50.160 --> 02:51:53.680]  that will outlive any of this kind of censorship, and it will bypass all of that.
[02:51:53.680 --> 02:51:57.960]  Someone can't come into your house and take away a DVD from your, from your bookshelf,
[02:51:57.960 --> 02:52:01.720]  and that's exactly why they're making a comeback, and that's exactly why we'll be doing that,
[02:52:01.720 --> 02:52:02.720]  because it's totally unstoppable.
[02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:07.440]  And by the way, I'm glad you mentioned that, because we briefly talked about it, I guess
[02:52:07.440 --> 02:52:10.920]  Sunday or, we talked Sunday or Saturday, it's all, when are we talking with them for
[02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:11.920]  like 30 minutes?
[02:52:11.920 --> 02:52:12.920]  A few days ago.
[02:52:12.920 --> 02:52:15.360]  Yeah, it was on the weekend, yeah.
[02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:20.480]  And you're like, hey, DVDs are making a comeback, blah, blah, I'm not just saying this.
[02:52:20.480 --> 02:52:27.400]  It was our listeners on VHS in 1997, I made America Destroyed by Design, I said, please,
[02:52:27.400 --> 02:52:32.960]  our listeners are so good, they wouldn't copy it unless I said, I sold a thousand VHS the
[02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:39.440]  first month, and by the end of the year, I'd sold like 50,000 VHS, and that funded my equipment,
[02:52:39.440 --> 02:52:40.440]  everything.
[02:52:40.440 --> 02:52:44.480]  I had like a $200 video camera, I was editing an old three quarter inch tape at night at
[02:52:44.480 --> 02:52:48.960]  a city library facility, literally by a crack house.
[02:52:48.960 --> 02:52:53.200]  That money that came in, the few hundred thousand dollars, allowed us to upgrade by digital
[02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:55.440]  equipment and launch everything we did.
[02:52:55.440 --> 02:53:00.600]  And so as you said, I'd walk in gas stations in New Mexico, or upstate New York, and there'd
[02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:07.120]  be, you know, in the early 2000s, a shrine of our films, and people were making copies
[02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:10.480]  and giving them away at the gas station, you know, for a dollar or what it cost to burn
[02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:11.480]  it.
[02:53:11.480 --> 02:53:15.000]  As soon as the sensors come in, all we do is value that again.
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:18.640]  We go back to DVD, we will circumnavigate their ass again.
[02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:21.520]  Oh yeah, DVDs will outlive all of this.
[02:53:21.520 --> 02:53:25.720]  As I said, DVDs are the most important thing to bypass censorship, because you absolutely
[02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:27.160]  can't stop that from happening.
[02:53:27.160 --> 02:53:30.600]  This movie, although it's going to have a huge impact, loads of people are going to see it
[02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:31.600]  online.
[02:53:31.600 --> 02:53:35.280]  I guarantee, at least in a couple of years' time, when the internet shifts forever, this
[02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:36.840]  will never be allowed.
[02:53:36.840 --> 02:53:41.360]  Right now it will be, because we're just on the car, 2020, it'll be all right.
[02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:42.360]  Just on the car.
[02:53:42.360 --> 02:53:47.120]  But a DVD would last 100 years, so that would be a key way.
[02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:53.720]  My wife had never seen an idiocracy, this is two nights ago, and she goes, I want to
[02:53:53.720 --> 02:53:59.800]  see it, so we try to get on Netflix and can't find it, go to Amazon, it's not downloading.
[02:53:59.800 --> 02:54:04.520]  So I tear the house apart, I go, I know I've got a copy, I get in the attic, I find it.
[02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:07.400]  It's HD, it's on our big screen in the bedroom.
[02:54:07.400 --> 02:54:12.360]  She's like, God, this is so much clearer than Netflix, why don't we watch DVDs exactly?
[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:13.360]  It's ours.
[02:54:13.360 --> 02:54:18.400]  It isn't being surveilled that we're watching it, and I watch the movie with her.
[02:54:18.400 --> 02:54:20.600]  So again, folks, it's simple, it's revolutionary.
[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:24.800]  I want this film that actually, I guess you interviewed me like six, eight months ago,
[02:54:24.800 --> 02:54:28.680]  then again a few months ago, so it's not up to the current stuff, but it's all the same
[02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:29.680]  topic.
[02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:32.880]  It's a very powerful, censoredmovie.com.
[02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:37.760]  Please go there, sign up, subscribe now to get it, it'll be sent to you.
[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:41.360]  I want to hold you over there, I've got another guest that's coming on, but I want to play
[02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:45.560]  clips from the film, but to be specific, as you guys are the engineer tech guys, the great
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:48.440]  camera people, and the great marketers, how does it work?
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:52.600]  As you can subscribe, you can go sign up and watch it once, or you can buy it and have
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:53.600]  it forever.
[02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:59.480]  What happens when you go to censoredmovie.com, because I want a hard copy of this right now.
[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:03.480]  So can I put it on my hard drive, my memory stick, what do I do?
[02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:07.480]  So right now it's hosted on Vimeo, so if you go to, youcan'twatchthis.com, that shows
[02:55:07.480 --> 02:55:11.080]  you exactly how you can buy it on there, and then when you have a Vimeo account, you own
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:15.120]  that movie, you can watch it as many times as you want forever, and then very soon we'll
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:18.640]  be able to pre-order a DVD, and then as soon as they come into stock, that'll be shipped
[02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:19.640]  to you.
[02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:22.600]  And you can also rent it, and then that lasts something like 48 hours, then you can watch
[02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:27.200]  that with whoever you want for then, but once you pay for it, it's still yours.
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:30.920]  There might be a way to still download it, I need to just double check that, but it still
[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:33.920]  belongs to you, you can still sign into your Vimeo account, and that will be there.
[02:55:33.920 --> 02:55:39.840]  Well listen, this is your film, but you remember all I asked for when I was in it, for no consideration,
[02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:41.560]  obviously I don't care, it's fine.
[02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:45.800]  I said I promote it, I trust you guys, I really trust you now to see the film, is that it's
[02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:51.760]  somehow be free to air, but usually you could put something on YouTube or Facebook, I guess
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:55.080]  it doesn't matter now, because they probably won't let you put it out for free.
[02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:59.800]  Absolutely, well we want to make sure that the message is absolutely free, so the content
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:03.120]  of it, the message is absolutely free, so right now YouTube, I think it's just, Paul's
[02:56:03.120 --> 02:56:08.280]  just put his segment up, that's already got 50,000 views in 35 minutes, so people are
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:12.040]  already seeing the message, people are already seeing exactly what the core is about, people
[02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:15.560]  are already seeing the arguments being pushed by it, but to own a copy, if you go to Vimeo
[02:56:15.560 --> 02:56:19.480]  then you can have something that you can tangibly own forever that they can't take away from
[02:56:19.480 --> 02:56:23.800]  you, but the exclusive clips, all of the clips and all of the on-air clips, all of that's
[02:56:23.800 --> 02:56:27.600]  being launched pretty much every day, we're putting out different bits of footage, and
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:29.440]  you can find that on You Can Watch The Sa...
[02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:33.080]  Taylor, let me just say, do two more segments with us, and then we're going to have Gerald
[02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:37.760]  Salante take over, but I'm impressed with what you've done, and I've seen the film,
[02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:42.160]  I mean, you say you made a few changes, what were the changes?
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:47.080]  So we just extended certain bits, so for example, when Tommy was talking about the future,
[02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:51.800]  he was predicting that his Facebook would be taken away, that his Twitter, his YouTube
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:55.440]  would be taken away forever, we extended those bits, we went into the arguments a little
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:56:59.080]  bit more, so it really went into detail about exactly what's going to happen, and we did
[02:56:59.080 --> 02:57:00.800]  that because it came true.
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:05.120]  This movie has the last ever interview Tommy did before he was banned on Facebook.
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:09.000]  You can see in the movie, he's holding his phone, while he's live on that phone, that's
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:13.280]  his last ever live stream on camera that you can see, so it's absolutely crazy, it's got
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:17.280]  so many moments like that that we pulled out, just because they're so valuable now, there's
[02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:21.640]  no other footage, there's no other interview with Tommy before that period, so that's something
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:26.320]  we really wanted to focus on and to pull out a little bit in the movie, so you'll see that
[02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:27.320]  as well, which is priceless.
[02:57:27.320 --> 02:57:31.320]  Well, Kailin Robertson, I'm just honored that you and George put me in the film, and I'm
[02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:36.400]  really honored to promote it, because I just know as I'm being silenced, my audience knows
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:40.360]  who I am, and I love them to death, but people outside of this, they literally think I'm
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:44.200]  a Nazi, and I'm just glad there's a film that'll speak for what I believe in.
[02:57:44.200 --> 02:57:52.360]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern
[02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:57.800]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques, based off
[02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:01.680]  of hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions.
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:06.920]  We've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and wake up America
[02:58:06.920 --> 02:58:08.840]  of Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:12.560]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate

[02:59:49.480 --> 03:00:18.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:33.660]  A woman in the kids and the dogs have me.
[03:00:33.660 --> 03:00:37.400]  The woman in the kids and the dogs have me.
[03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:39.640]  You know how high you get?
[03:00:39.640 --> 03:00:41.520]  Out in the woods?
[03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:43.020]  Are you a woman?
[03:00:43.020 --> 03:00:44.020]  You're kids?
[03:00:44.020 --> 03:00:45.020]  You're dogs?
[03:00:45.020 --> 03:00:46.020]  You know how happy you are?
[03:00:46.020 --> 03:00:48.020]  I never want to come home.
[03:00:53.020 --> 03:00:56.020]  I can fly a field all day long.
[03:00:56.020 --> 03:01:00.020]  I can catch catfish from dust till dawn.
[03:01:01.020 --> 03:01:04.020]  So Thomas Jefferson talked about the Yeoman Farmers.
[03:01:11.020 --> 03:01:14.020]  Ain't too many things these old boys can do.
[03:01:14.020 --> 03:01:16.020]  God, the old boys I knew.
[03:01:18.020 --> 03:01:20.020]  You think I feel strong when I go out in public?
[03:01:20.020 --> 03:01:23.020]  I don't see anybody like those men I knew when I was a kid.
[03:01:23.020 --> 03:01:26.020]  My God, I go to those square dances.
[03:01:26.020 --> 03:01:29.020]  I go to those events, those men were strong.
[03:01:32.020 --> 03:01:35.020]  Those men were powerful.
[03:01:36.020 --> 03:01:39.020]  They weren't posing, they weren't fake.
[03:01:39.020 --> 03:01:43.020]  Yeah, sure, they'd done some things.
[03:01:43.020 --> 03:01:45.020]  They were men.
[03:01:45.020 --> 03:01:47.020]  They were hardworking Americans.
[03:01:47.020 --> 03:01:54.020]  We came from the West Virginia coal mines and the rocky mountains and the western skies.
[03:01:58.020 --> 03:02:03.020]  And we can skin a bus, we can run a trot line and a country boy can fly.
[03:02:03.020 --> 03:02:07.020]  It's watching the death of the West.
[03:02:07.020 --> 03:02:09.020]  It's so painful.
[03:02:09.020 --> 03:02:11.020]  The hope.
[03:02:12.020 --> 03:02:15.020]  I used to have an old friend in New York City.
[03:02:15.020 --> 03:02:18.020]  He never called my name just till Billy.
[03:02:18.020 --> 03:02:21.020]  So this last part will go to our guest.
[03:02:30.020 --> 03:02:34.020]  You know, you little secrets in that song, living off the land doesn't mean farming.
[03:02:34.020 --> 03:02:43.020]  It means running banks, running women, running factories and killing people.
[03:02:43.020 --> 03:02:46.020]  That's what living off the land means.
[03:02:50.020 --> 03:02:55.020]  See, you can knock the South almost left of it, but people are taught how to kill folks.
[03:02:55.020 --> 03:02:57.020]  And how to stand up.
[03:02:57.020 --> 03:02:59.020]  That's not taught in the North.
[03:02:59.020 --> 03:03:03.020]  They think it's a few Italians that don't want to do that because they did it back in Italy.
[03:03:03.020 --> 03:03:07.020]  The mafia couldn't operate in the South because you got your ass killed.
[03:03:07.020 --> 03:03:11.020]  Because you can't starve us out.
[03:03:11.020 --> 03:03:14.020]  You can't make us run.
[03:03:16.020 --> 03:03:21.020]  And you can't make us run because these boys was raised on shotguns.
[03:03:21.020 --> 03:03:23.020]  We'll do one more segment.
[03:03:23.020 --> 03:03:26.020]  Kailin, I appreciate you while I'm ranting here today.
[03:03:26.020 --> 03:03:28.020]  And I want to get into this film.
[03:03:28.020 --> 03:03:30.020]  I really want this to be a big film.
[03:03:30.020 --> 03:03:33.020]  I really want more than ever.
[03:03:33.020 --> 03:03:36.020]  It's so like a man in the desert wanting the truth to get out.
[03:03:36.020 --> 03:03:39.020]  You guys have really delivered something special and I salute you.
[03:03:39.020 --> 03:03:44.020]  And everybody needs to tell everybody they know right now to see the forbidden film,
[03:03:44.020 --> 03:03:48.020]  to see what they're not supposed to see and to get this out.
[03:03:48.020 --> 03:03:50.020]  You can't watch this.com.
[03:03:50.020 --> 03:03:53.020]  What do you want to add about seeing this film?
[03:03:53.020 --> 03:03:56.020]  Well, loads of people are going to see this just as you said.
[03:03:56.020 --> 03:04:01.020]  When people see the humanity as well and the way that we're told the stories
[03:04:01.020 --> 03:04:05.020]  of Gavin and you and Tommy, then they'll start telling people about it.
[03:04:05.020 --> 03:04:08.020]  And you'll hear about it from a lot of people because it's really emotional.
[03:04:08.020 --> 03:04:10.020]  I mean, you're getting emotional with this song now.
[03:04:10.020 --> 03:04:11.020]  That's how this film is as well.
[03:04:11.020 --> 03:04:15.020]  You know, there's scenes where Gavin talks like you'll have never ever heard him before.
[03:04:15.020 --> 03:04:20.020]  There's Tommy talking about for the first time having to relocate his young daughters
[03:04:20.020 --> 03:04:24.020]  and his wife out of the UK to leave the country forever.
[03:04:24.020 --> 03:04:26.020]  That's not hype. I'm not bragging.
[03:04:26.020 --> 03:04:27.020]  He even thanked me on air last week.
[03:04:27.020 --> 03:04:31.020]  He was basket case, suicidal, and I got him to not stop.
[03:04:31.020 --> 03:04:32.020]  And I'm not even bragging.
[03:04:32.020 --> 03:04:34.020]  I was like, that guy was ready to quit.
[03:04:34.020 --> 03:04:35.020]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:35.020 --> 03:04:38.020]  And there's so many things like that on the film as well,
[03:04:38.020 --> 03:04:40.020]  which have never been seen before in the right,
[03:04:40.020 --> 03:04:42.020]  which have never been seen before on this side,
[03:04:42.020 --> 03:04:46.020]  proper stories of people who are fighting for what they believe in.
[03:04:46.020 --> 03:04:48.020]  Taylor Robertson, you knocked it out of the park.
[03:04:48.020 --> 03:04:55.020]  I think in 60 seconds, stay with us.
[03:05:48.020 --> 03:06:11.020]  Oh, I mean, there's thousands of songs in there.
[03:06:11.020 --> 03:06:15.020]  And the crew is just playing Keith Whitley right now.
[03:06:15.020 --> 03:06:17.020]  Please don't do that.
[03:06:17.020 --> 03:06:22.020]  You still won't hear my love.
[03:06:22.020 --> 03:06:24.020]  But darling just wants.
[03:06:24.020 --> 03:06:34.020]  But darling, this time that your memories die.
[03:06:34.020 --> 03:06:36.020]  And the globalists think we're weak because we have emotion and we care.
[03:06:36.020 --> 03:06:39.020]  No, they're dead.
[03:06:39.020 --> 03:06:41.020]  What is this cheesy music, cheesy video you're playing?
[03:06:41.020 --> 03:06:43.020]  You gotta stop it.
[03:06:43.020 --> 03:06:45.020]  Don't close your eyes.
[03:06:45.020 --> 03:06:47.020]  Don't close your eyes.
[03:06:47.020 --> 03:06:49.020]  Let it be me.
[03:06:49.020 --> 03:06:52.020]  Don't close your eyes.
[03:06:52.020 --> 03:06:55.020]  Let it be me.
[03:06:55.020 --> 03:06:57.020]  Don't pretend.
[03:06:57.020 --> 03:06:59.020]  That's good stuff right there.
[03:06:59.020 --> 03:07:05.020]  I love good old Kentucky music, Texas music, Tennessee music,
[03:07:05.020 --> 03:07:10.020]  Alabama, Georgia music, Leonard's Kennard, Florida music.
[03:07:10.020 --> 03:07:16.020]  But God, can you imagine if this guy hadn't died?
[03:07:16.020 --> 03:07:18.020]  All the songs are so good.
[03:07:18.020 --> 03:07:22.020]  I appreciate Kailin Robertson joining us today with a great work he's doing.
[03:07:22.020 --> 03:07:24.020]  You can't watch this.com.
[03:07:24.020 --> 03:07:28.020]  It's the name of the main site about the film, censoredmovie.com.
[03:07:28.020 --> 03:07:34.020]  It is what you've put out where people can go and get ready to watch this in less than 48 hours.
[03:07:34.020 --> 03:07:38.020]  I got a few clips I want to play and I appreciate you holding while I babble incoherently.
[03:07:38.020 --> 03:07:44.020]  But other points you'd like to make, and we've got your partner in filmmaking,
[03:07:44.020 --> 03:07:48.020]  you know, coming on with us tomorrow about all this.
[03:07:48.020 --> 03:07:51.020]  And so I'm very proud of the work you've both done.
[03:07:51.020 --> 03:07:55.020]  But this is really a big deal because not just your films excellent,
[03:07:55.020 --> 03:07:58.020]  but you've made a lot of the big films that are good as well.
[03:07:58.020 --> 03:07:59.020]  I think this is your best.
[03:07:59.020 --> 03:08:02.020]  I'm just saying I've seen your ones in South Africa and I watched four or five of them.
[03:08:02.020 --> 03:08:04.020]  They're all really well done.
[03:08:04.020 --> 03:08:07.020]  I think this is your best and all the interviews you've got.
[03:08:07.020 --> 03:08:11.020]  But plus the timing and the risk you're taking.
[03:08:11.020 --> 03:08:13.020]  It's not about making you...
[03:08:13.020 --> 03:08:15.020]  We don't have to tell folks right now we're all taking risk.
[03:08:15.020 --> 03:08:19.020]  The fact that, you know, you're doing what no one else would do,
[03:08:19.020 --> 03:08:23.020]  actually talking to the forbidden devils.
[03:08:23.020 --> 03:08:25.020]  Yeah, thank you so much.
[03:08:25.020 --> 03:08:27.020]  I mean, this film is going to be really big.
[03:08:27.020 --> 03:08:32.020]  I've just got a message from Mike Sernovich then who's just been given a link just before it comes out.
[03:08:32.020 --> 03:08:34.020]  And he said it's incredible as well.
[03:08:34.020 --> 03:08:36.020]  And they've done hoax and loads of films like that.
[03:08:36.020 --> 03:08:41.020]  The feedback from, you know, right wing journalists as well who are going to be writing a couple reviews
[03:08:41.020 --> 03:08:43.020]  has been really, really positive.
[03:08:43.020 --> 03:08:45.020]  People are just blown away.
[03:08:45.020 --> 03:08:50.020]  They've never seen people on our side in that way before.
[03:08:50.020 --> 03:08:56.020]  They've never seen it and they've never seen compassion as well on the right portrayed in this way as well.
[03:08:56.020 --> 03:08:58.020]  It's always people mudslinging.
[03:08:58.020 --> 03:09:02.020]  It's always the left laughing at them or it's always them just, you know, trying to fight back.
[03:09:02.020 --> 03:09:07.020]  This is the most somber look at the right that's probably ever been made.
[03:09:07.020 --> 03:09:08.020]  And it's, no, you're right.
[03:09:08.020 --> 03:09:10.020]  It's a really, really good film.
[03:09:10.020 --> 03:09:12.020]  And people aren't going to be blown away by it.
[03:09:12.020 --> 03:09:17.020]  This is, you know, we don't have to spend, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing it and blowing it up
[03:09:17.020 --> 03:09:21.020]  because people are going to watch it and they're going to say, I have to show my mother this.
[03:09:21.020 --> 03:09:22.020]  I have to show my sister this.
[03:09:22.020 --> 03:09:27.020]  People have to understand what's really going on because for years one particular narrative has been pushed.
[03:09:27.020 --> 03:09:30.020]  And also, if you want to look at how to change culture, you know,
[03:09:30.020 --> 03:09:34.020]  documentaries are the way to change culture more than anything else.
[03:09:34.020 --> 03:09:36.020]  You know, look at what Blackfish did to the sea life industry.
[03:09:36.020 --> 03:09:39.020]  Look at what Super Size Me did to the fast food industry.
[03:09:39.020 --> 03:09:43.020]  Look at what Michael Moore did to the Democrat Party on the left.
[03:09:43.020 --> 03:09:49.020]  I mean, the documentaries are at the front line of changing culture and public opinion
[03:09:49.020 --> 03:09:52.020]  and actually changing how society thinks about things.
[03:09:52.020 --> 03:09:53.020]  And that's why this is so important.
[03:09:53.020 --> 03:09:56.020]  And this film will contribute to that.
[03:09:56.020 --> 03:10:03.020]  More than so many different forms of text and of media, this is the core way that society changes.
[03:10:03.020 --> 03:10:05.020]  Because people look at production value.
[03:10:05.020 --> 03:10:08.020]  They look at films very differently to how they look at anything else.
[03:10:08.020 --> 03:10:09.020]  I mean, humans are storytellers.
[03:10:09.020 --> 03:10:15.020]  You know, we used to camp around fires for thousands of years and tell each other stories about how things work
[03:10:15.020 --> 03:10:17.020]  and about, you know, how religion spread and things like that.
[03:10:17.020 --> 03:10:19.020]  And this is a form of that.
[03:10:19.020 --> 03:10:23.020]  And this is a form of being able to tell people's stories at a human level.
[03:10:23.020 --> 03:10:26.020]  And it is so powerful.
[03:10:26.020 --> 03:10:34.020]  When you see Gavin talking so openly, when you see Tommy talking about things which he has never spoken about in front of a camera before.
[03:10:34.020 --> 03:10:37.020]  And the same with Laura Lumer and the same with you.
[03:10:37.020 --> 03:10:43.020]  Some of the things you've said were, where I was shocked sitting behind the camera thinking, oh my gosh, you know, I wonder,
[03:10:43.020 --> 03:10:45.020]  I can't wait for the world to see this.
[03:10:45.020 --> 03:10:47.020]  And that's what's going to be so crazy.
[03:10:47.020 --> 03:10:53.020]  Well, Caitlin, in the time we've got here, and I can keep you all day, and I've got to go.
[03:10:53.020 --> 03:10:55.020]  When you told me, was it a year ago?
[03:10:55.020 --> 03:10:58.020]  How long was it you came and visited and pitched me this film?
[03:10:58.020 --> 03:11:00.020]  And I had you on the show.
[03:11:00.020 --> 03:11:03.020]  Was that eight, ten months ago? How long ago was that?
[03:11:03.020 --> 03:11:05.020]  Oh, well, we filmed your interview this year.
[03:11:05.020 --> 03:11:06.020]  This isn't an old film.
[03:11:06.020 --> 03:11:08.020]  No, no, no, no. I had you in an interview just a few months ago.
[03:11:08.020 --> 03:11:13.020]  But when you first came and pitched me this film idea and said, well, you're being our film, how long ago was that?
[03:11:13.020 --> 03:11:19.020]  Oh, that was, that was December. That was only six months ago.
[03:11:19.020 --> 03:11:20.020]  That was six months ago.
[03:11:20.020 --> 03:11:24.020]  The fact is, now with mainstream media, they all lie.
[03:11:24.020 --> 03:11:28.020]  And in corporate media or filmmakers, with you, you did everything you said you do.
[03:11:28.020 --> 03:11:31.020]  You know how refreshing that is?
[03:11:31.020 --> 03:11:36.020]  I mean, how refreshing it is that you did what you said.
[03:11:36.020 --> 03:11:38.020]  It makes me love you, man.
[03:11:38.020 --> 03:11:43.020]  You know how, I mean, it's like, it's so rare now that people actually do what they say.
[03:11:43.020 --> 03:11:44.020]  I really appreciate you.
[03:11:44.020 --> 03:11:48.020]  Here, let's play a clip because this is almost over here and we're almost out of time.
[03:11:48.020 --> 03:11:52.020]  Let's play Gavin McGinnis reveals his nightmare situation.
[03:11:52.020 --> 03:11:53.020]  Then Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:11:53.020 --> 03:11:56.020]  But here it is from the film. Here it is.
[03:11:59.020 --> 03:12:04.020]  So two neighbors put up these signs that the leader of a hate group lives in our town.
[03:12:04.020 --> 03:12:09.020]  No, so they put up the signs on my lawn that said, hey, there's no home here.
[03:12:09.020 --> 03:12:12.020]  Instead of talking to me, of course.
[03:12:12.020 --> 03:12:17.020]  And being known as a Nazi is the same as being known as a pedophile in today's society.
[03:12:17.020 --> 03:12:23.020]  If I heard there was a pedophile in my neighborhood, I would not put a sign saying pedophiles have no home here.
[03:12:23.020 --> 03:12:29.020]  I'd knock at his door and go, so what's going on? What did you do?
[03:12:29.020 --> 03:12:35.020]  But I sent them all a letter, not everyone, because some of them weren't about me,
[03:12:35.020 --> 03:12:40.020]  but I saw something where they said, let's put the signs on his lawn and around his house
[03:12:40.020 --> 03:12:42.020]  and show him that hate has no home here.
[03:12:42.020 --> 03:12:46.020]  And again, we're talking about a very shrill minority.
[03:12:46.020 --> 03:12:51.020]  95% of the people in the burbs just want to raise their kids and not have any trouble.
[03:12:51.020 --> 03:12:57.020]  You can go to the full clip at youcan'twatchthis.com, but he came here right after this happened.
[03:12:57.020 --> 03:13:00.020]  And I don't want to tell his secrets. He didn't say it was off record,
[03:13:00.020 --> 03:13:02.020]  but he almost couldn't do the interview.
[03:13:02.020 --> 03:13:07.020]  I don't want to say what happened to his wife, but let's just say she got hospitalized.
[03:13:07.020 --> 03:13:11.020]  They're at her house with torches saying, we're going to get you Nazis.
[03:13:11.020 --> 03:13:13.020]  So what you have in the film isn't even as hardcore as it happened.
[03:13:13.020 --> 03:13:15.020]  So I talked to him right after this happened.
[03:13:15.020 --> 03:13:20.020]  He came here just a few months ago, and I had to convince him not to give up.
[03:13:20.020 --> 03:13:22.020]  And he wasn't being a wimp about this.
[03:13:22.020 --> 03:13:30.020]  It's like home surrounded kids harassed. Again, I don't think people realize how real this is.
[03:13:30.020 --> 03:13:35.020]  There's another scene in the actual film where Gavin's sitting at home watching the fire
[03:13:35.020 --> 03:13:39.020]  where he's got to think of Maker's Mark and his wife isn't in the house
[03:13:39.020 --> 03:13:41.020]  and he talks about, he pretty much talks about that.
[03:13:41.020 --> 03:13:46.020]  And he talks really serious about how he genuinely feels like his life is over sometimes.
[03:13:46.020 --> 03:13:48.020]  You know, he feels like he's got to start again.
[03:13:48.020 --> 03:13:54.020]  And it's something, it was really, really, really powerful putting it together.
[03:13:54.020 --> 03:13:59.020]  That's in the main film, which is out in 48 hours, but it's 10 times more than even that car scene
[03:13:59.020 --> 03:14:05.020]  where he says in detail how it felt inside to be turned from someone who was, you know,
[03:14:05.020 --> 03:14:10.020]  owner of Vice on Fox News every single night to someone who can't even go on their phone,
[03:14:10.020 --> 03:14:17.020]  whose people scream and shout at his house, whose wife is on the verge of having a breakdown.
[03:14:17.020 --> 03:14:21.020]  And all because he doesn't support radical Islam taking over.
[03:14:21.020 --> 03:14:25.020]  Yeah, because he's not, he's very dangerous.
[03:14:25.020 --> 03:14:31.020]  He's very funny and he's very smart and he doesn't go along with the far less agenda
[03:14:31.020 --> 03:14:35.020]  and they are really, really worried about people like that because he has charisma
[03:14:35.020 --> 03:14:37.020]  and people follow him and people like him.
[03:14:37.020 --> 03:14:41.020]  Well, I don't want to take credit for it because you've got this too,
[03:14:41.020 --> 03:14:43.020]  but it's the fighting spirit of not giving up.
[03:14:43.020 --> 03:14:45.020]  That's why they want to shut us down.
[03:14:45.020 --> 03:14:48.020]  That's why they're so angry. Our audience has that fighting spirit.
[03:14:48.020 --> 03:14:50.020]  We salute them. We appreciate them.
[03:14:50.020 --> 03:14:54.020]  I didn't even get to Paul Watson clips, my clips, other clips from the film.
[03:14:54.020 --> 03:14:57.020]  They're all up right now.
[03:14:57.020 --> 03:14:59.020]  You can't watch this dot com.
[03:14:59.020 --> 03:15:02.020]  We're going to try to create an article today and info wars dot com.
[03:15:02.020 --> 03:15:06.020]  The cruise listening that has all that was like eight or nine clips out now.
[03:15:06.020 --> 03:15:10.020]  This just feels good to have a voice and Kalen, I like to work before.
[03:15:10.020 --> 03:15:14.020]  I really appreciate you and George delivering on what you said.
[03:15:14.020 --> 03:15:18.020]  We hope we work together soon and we've got George on tomorrow.
[03:15:18.020 --> 03:15:22.020]  But again, everybody spread this video, override the algorithm, override the sensors.
[03:15:22.020 --> 03:15:24.020]  Thank you so much.
[03:15:24.020 --> 03:15:27.020]  Kalen Robertson, thank you, my friend.
[03:15:27.020 --> 03:15:29.020]  Well, thanks for taking part in this movie.
[03:15:29.020 --> 03:15:31.020]  It was your, your scenes were incredible.
[03:15:31.020 --> 03:15:34.020]  So it's not worry about me. You've knocked it out of the park.
[03:15:34.020 --> 03:15:36.020]  You've done a great job. We want to get this film out.
[03:15:36.020 --> 03:15:38.020]  So we'll talk more about this the next few days.
[03:15:38.020 --> 03:15:43.020]  We've got Gerald Salente, the top trends forecaster about to take over info wars dot com news wars dot com.
[03:15:43.020 --> 03:15:47.020]  I'll introduce Gerald. I appreciate him letting me go 15 minutes into his show.

[03:17:53.020 --> 03:17:57.020]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:17:57.020 --> 03:17:59.020]  Introducing pollen block.
[03:17:59.020 --> 03:18:04.020]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[03:18:04.020 --> 03:18:08.020]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[03:18:08.020 --> 03:18:11.020]  eye comfort and respiratory function.
[03:18:11.020 --> 03:18:16.020]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[03:18:16.020 --> 03:18:20.020]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:18:20.020 --> 03:18:23.020]  They began studying this effect in published trials
[03:18:23.020 --> 03:18:26.020]  and decades later we now have the fruit of this research,
[03:18:26.020 --> 03:18:31.020]  a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:18:31.020 --> 03:18:35.020]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[03:18:35.020 --> 03:18:41.020]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[03:18:41.020 --> 03:18:45.020]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:18:45.020 --> 03:18:48.020]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:18:48.020 --> 03:18:53.020]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block, chewable tablets.
[03:18:53.020 --> 03:18:58.020]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[03:18:58.020 --> 03:19:03.020]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[03:19:03.020 --> 03:19:06.020]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[03:19:06.020 --> 03:19:09.020]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[03:19:09.020 --> 03:19:13.020]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature
[03:19:13.020 --> 03:19:17.020]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infowar.
[03:19:17.020 --> 03:19:19.020]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:19:19.020 --> 03:19:23.020]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year
[03:19:23.020 --> 03:19:28.020]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier
[03:19:28.020 --> 03:19:31.020]  as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family
[03:19:31.020 --> 03:19:34.020]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[03:19:34.020 --> 03:19:39.020]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[03:19:39.020 --> 03:19:44.020]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level
[03:19:44.020 --> 03:19:46.020]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:19:46.020 --> 03:19:49.020]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[03:19:49.020 --> 03:20:18.020]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield.
[03:20:19.020 --> 03:20:24.020]  How you like me now? How you like me now?
[03:20:24.020 --> 03:20:28.020]  How you like me now? How you like me now?
[03:20:28.020 --> 03:20:31.020]  Remember the time.
[03:20:31.020 --> 03:20:35.020]  We now take you along to the Central Texas Command Center
[03:20:35.020 --> 03:20:38.020]  linked up with Kingsville, New York.
[03:20:38.020 --> 03:20:40.020]  The Grand Salons at the top, Central Texas.
[03:20:40.020 --> 03:20:43.020]  The Elm Shires come along.
[03:20:43.020 --> 03:20:48.020]  In the war with three o'clock Central Standard Time.
[03:20:48.020 --> 03:20:50.020]  We're going to go to Gerald the moment.
[03:20:50.020 --> 03:20:54.020]  Trendresearch.com on Twitter, Gerald Salente.
[03:20:54.020 --> 03:20:57.020]  They get this guy back in the studio. Love hanging out with this guy.
[03:20:57.020 --> 03:20:59.020]  What a, what a patriot.
[03:20:59.020 --> 03:21:03.020]  But I didn't plug last hour because I was promoting somebody's film, which is great,
[03:21:03.020 --> 03:21:06.020]  but that's free speech. We need funds and I'm not bitching.
[03:21:06.020 --> 03:21:09.020]  I'm not complaining. I'm not saying, hey, you better pony up.
[03:21:09.020 --> 03:21:11.020]  I'm just saying, you want to win this war?
[03:21:11.020 --> 03:21:14.020]  They have done everything they can to shut us down.
[03:21:14.020 --> 03:21:19.020]  So any guess we have on any host, anything we're doing is something I think is important.
[03:21:19.020 --> 03:21:21.020]  I think you'd think it's important.
[03:21:21.020 --> 03:21:24.020]  So I respectfully, like I respect myself,
[03:21:24.020 --> 03:21:29.020]  ask you to gut up and to realize the level of the war we're in.
[03:21:29.020 --> 03:21:34.020]  And instead of spending a bunch of money at some corporate hotel or some big box store,
[03:21:34.020 --> 03:21:37.020]  some system, get a bag of wake up America coffee.
[03:21:37.020 --> 03:21:39.020]  I thought was the best coffee I ever had.
[03:21:39.020 --> 03:21:41.020]  I got to deal with the Chiapas farmers.
[03:21:41.020 --> 03:21:43.020]  It's Wildcrafted beyond organic.
[03:21:43.020 --> 03:21:47.020]  I got that for you. I got the best vitamin B12 ultra 12,
[03:21:47.020 --> 03:21:50.020]  twice the mythical bottom and the highest quality B12,
[03:21:50.020 --> 03:21:53.020]  the secret 12 had, I signed a multi year contract,
[03:21:53.020 --> 03:21:57.020]  proprietary patented way to give you the purest mythical bottom and out there.
[03:21:57.020 --> 03:22:03.020]  The best B12 is incredible info or store.com 50% off introductory offer out of the gates.
[03:22:03.020 --> 03:22:11.020]  We're ending the get X3 free tri iodine incredible product with the original X2 deep breath crystal iodine,
[03:22:11.020 --> 03:22:15.020]  which is the pure as best you can get, but some people can absorb pure iodine.
[03:22:15.020 --> 03:22:17.020]  So we put on X3.
[03:22:17.020 --> 03:22:22.020]  The point is, get a free bottle of X3 with X2 that special is about to end info or store.com,
[03:22:22.020 --> 03:22:26.020]  info was live.com or triple a 253 3139.
[03:22:26.020 --> 03:22:31.020]  But whatever you do, realize history is being made in your word of mouth.
[03:22:31.020 --> 03:22:38.020]  Overriding big tech, overriding the sensors and the announcement that the Supreme Court says
[03:22:38.020 --> 03:22:43.020]  Apple's a monopoly and whether you're a dog catcher or a Sunday school teacher,
[03:22:43.020 --> 03:22:49.020]  or an auto mechanic or a lawyer or a top trends forecaster or a syndicated radio host,
[03:22:49.020 --> 03:22:53.020]  Apple's running a criminal monopoly that everybody should go after.
[03:22:53.020 --> 03:22:56.020]  I told you, Trump's for real.
[03:22:56.020 --> 03:22:58.020]  And he's about to make a move.
[03:22:58.020 --> 03:22:59.020]  Big history is happening right now.
[03:22:59.020 --> 03:23:01.020]  So thank you all for your support.
[03:23:01.020 --> 03:23:02.020]  Thanks to the great crew.
[03:23:02.020 --> 03:23:05.020]  So for the next 40 minutes, Gerald Salente.
[03:23:05.020 --> 03:23:07.020]  Thanks for letting me take a body of your time.
[03:23:07.020 --> 03:23:08.020]  We respect you.
[03:23:08.020 --> 03:23:09.020]  We appreciate you.
[03:23:09.020 --> 03:23:10.020]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:23:10.020 --> 03:23:12.020]  Tell us what's coming up.
[03:23:12.020 --> 03:23:14.020]  Well, thank you for all that you do.
[03:23:14.020 --> 03:23:16.020]  And you're 100% correct about Facebook.
[03:23:16.020 --> 03:23:19.020]  And of course, the others, the other monopolies.
[03:23:19.020 --> 03:23:20.020]  Apple.
[03:23:20.020 --> 03:23:24.020]  The Google, the Twitter's, the Apple's, one after another.
[03:23:24.020 --> 03:23:26.020]  It's just terrible what's going on.
[03:23:26.020 --> 03:23:31.020]  And you know, it was one of our top trends for 2019 censorship, 2019.
[03:23:31.020 --> 03:23:38.020]  And they're censoring everybody that comes out against the establishment in any way.
[03:23:38.020 --> 03:23:41.020]  You can't talk about not having vaccinations.
[03:23:41.020 --> 03:23:45.020]  You know, you can't talk about anything that they don't want you to talk about.
[03:23:45.020 --> 03:23:51.020]  So the people that are listening, please do what you can to support Infowars.
[03:23:51.020 --> 03:23:59.020]  Because if we keep losing out into them, we're lost out to freedom in so many different ways.
[03:23:59.020 --> 03:24:02.020]  And that's why, and I do what I can to support Infowars.
[03:24:02.020 --> 03:24:05.020]  I love this super male vitality.
[03:24:05.020 --> 03:24:07.020]  In all cat, it keeps me going, you know.
[03:24:07.020 --> 03:24:11.020]  And so do what you can because this is really getting out of hand.
[03:24:11.020 --> 03:24:17.020]  And just an example of the propaganda that's being promoted and how they're teaching us
[03:24:17.020 --> 03:24:20.020]  to hate people around the world.
[03:24:20.020 --> 03:24:28.020]  This past two days in the New York Times, the toilet paper of record, two stories.
[03:24:28.020 --> 03:24:33.020]  Hackers so discord as looms in Europe.
[03:24:33.020 --> 03:24:37.020]  Another one, front page today's paper.
[03:24:37.020 --> 03:24:43.020]  Russia wants US to dread 5G cell phones.
[03:24:43.020 --> 03:24:48.020]  Spreads dubious fears about health on TV.
[03:24:48.020 --> 03:24:51.020]  I'm going to go over these because they're very important.
[03:24:51.020 --> 03:24:57.020]  It's about the propaganda that the establishment is pushing down now with throat.
[03:24:57.020 --> 03:24:59.020]  I'm going to start with the 5Gs.
[03:24:59.020 --> 03:25:03.020]  Do you know in Brussels they banned 5Gs?
[03:25:03.020 --> 03:25:05.020]  That's right.
[03:25:05.020 --> 03:25:08.020]  They don't want them because of the research coming out.
[03:25:08.020 --> 03:25:12.020]  Now, I'm sure that Russia had nothing to do with that.
[03:25:12.020 --> 03:25:19.020]  And Russia didn't have a damn thing to do with our last edition of the Trends Journal.
[03:25:19.020 --> 03:25:26.020]  The government 5G wireless industry perpetrates scientific fraud.
[03:25:26.020 --> 03:25:33.020]  Criminal instigated, terminally pathological, 5G ups the ante.
[03:25:33.020 --> 03:25:43.020]  One story after another, these are the facts, scientific facts about the dangers of 5G technology
[03:25:43.020 --> 03:25:46.020]  that's going to be in a neighborhood near you.
[03:25:46.020 --> 03:25:51.020]  5G technology, a lesson in how elites control and conquer.
[03:25:51.020 --> 03:25:55.020]  How elites control and conquer and that's what they're doing at very different levels.
[03:25:55.020 --> 03:26:01.020]  Not only on 5G, and again, there's a lot of data out there, not only 5G with cell phones,
[03:26:01.020 --> 03:26:06.020]  showing radio frequency radiation hazards.
[03:26:06.020 --> 03:26:09.020]  And now they're going to be putting, rather than having cell towers,
[03:26:09.020 --> 03:26:13.020]  they're going to have them up and down the street in a neighborhood near you
[03:26:13.020 --> 03:26:16.020]  and the big cities even more and more concentrated.
[03:26:16.020 --> 03:26:20.020]  There is no government research to support this.
[03:26:20.020 --> 03:26:25.020]  They've never done this before, the experts that are putting this together
[03:26:25.020 --> 03:26:35.020]  are finding true, true crisis era fatalities that are going to occur as a result of this.
[03:26:35.020 --> 03:26:42.020]  Yet, the New York Times, they call themselves the paper of record, the toilet paper of record
[03:26:42.020 --> 03:26:49.020]  because all this is good is for wiping up, you know what, this is what they say.
[03:26:49.020 --> 03:26:57.020]  The United States intelligence agencies identified the network as a principal meddler.
[03:26:57.020 --> 03:27:02.020]  The first they begin in the 2016 presidential election.
[03:27:02.020 --> 03:27:04.020]  A principal meddler, huh?
[03:27:04.020 --> 03:27:07.020]  Yeah, they found that.
[03:27:07.020 --> 03:27:09.020]  I used to be on Russia today all the time.
[03:27:09.020 --> 03:27:12.020]  I say just what I want to say, like I'm on Alex Jones.
[03:27:12.020 --> 03:27:18.020]  And they don't want people to say what they want to say because you have to be a prostitute.
[03:27:18.020 --> 03:27:23.020]  Okay, you have to be a media whore.
[03:27:23.020 --> 03:27:29.020]  You have to get paid by your corporate Johns and your Washington whore masters.
[03:27:29.020 --> 03:27:35.020]  If you don't, then you are a Russian meddler.
[03:27:35.020 --> 03:27:43.020]  Oh, and in this time of equality, when I say prostitutes, of course I mean men and women.
[03:27:43.020 --> 03:27:53.020]  The story goes on, the Kremlin would really enjoy getting democratic governments tied up in fights
[03:27:53.020 --> 03:27:59.020]  over 5G's environmental and health hazards.
[03:27:59.020 --> 03:28:14.020]  Said Mollie Fianna, a Mollie Q head of Fianna Strategies, a consulting firm in Washington that seeks to counter Russian disinformation.
[03:28:14.020 --> 03:28:19.020]  These are the people that they are quoting.
[03:28:19.020 --> 03:28:31.020]  And this is why it's important to support Alex Jones info wars and all others that are trying to do our best to let freedom ring.
[03:28:31.020 --> 03:28:38.020]  Because this is a front page story, closing down freedom on us.
[03:28:38.020 --> 03:28:40.020]  Read back.
[03:28:40.020 --> 03:28:52.020]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:28:52.020 --> 03:28:56.020]  Okay, so a watch is good and some jewelry, better grab some flowers too.
[03:28:56.020 --> 03:28:57.020]  Hey, whatcha doing?
[03:28:57.020 --> 03:28:58.020]  Mother's Day, remember?
[03:28:58.020 --> 03:28:59.020]  Oh yeah.

[03:29:03.020 --> 03:29:05.020]  You know there's an easier way, right?
[03:29:05.020 --> 03:29:06.020]  I'm guessing you do?
[03:29:06.020 --> 03:29:12.020]  Yes, I'm gonna show you the easy, quick way to shop for mom and save 30% at sunshine-pillows.com.

[03:29:54.020 --> 03:30:01.020]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world.
[03:30:01.020 --> 03:30:05.020]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist.
[03:30:05.020 --> 03:30:11.020]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure,
[03:30:11.020 --> 03:30:14.020]  that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[03:30:14.020 --> 03:30:18.020]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:30:18.020 --> 03:30:20.020]  You are the info ward.
[03:30:20.020 --> 03:30:27.020]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash news letter
[03:30:27.020 --> 03:30:35.020]  and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:30:35.020 --> 03:30:43.020]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[03:30:43.020 --> 03:30:50.020]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:30:50.020 --> 03:30:53.020]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[03:30:53.020 --> 03:31:00.020]  Stacey in the great state of Texas. In FEMA region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:31:00.020 --> 03:31:06.020]  Good to talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[03:31:06.020 --> 03:31:13.020]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force. I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I trust.
[03:31:13.020 --> 03:31:19.020]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins, they don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[03:31:19.020 --> 03:31:20.020]  I appreciate that.
[03:31:20.020 --> 03:31:22.020]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force? Tell us about it.
[03:31:22.020 --> 03:31:27.020]  Well, it's really great. You know, it's like a multivitamin. I take it. It tastes good. It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:31:27.020 --> 03:31:33.020]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste. And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[03:31:33.020 --> 03:31:37.020]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are. They're known to turbo-charge women.
[03:31:37.020 --> 03:31:44.020]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it. So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy, these are amazing things.
[03:31:44.020 --> 03:31:53.020]  And ultimate female force, so I'm glad you plugged it.
[03:31:53.020 --> 03:32:06.020]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[03:32:06.020 --> 03:32:19.020]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant, leftist authoritarians, like the young turds and others, get so butt-hurt when Trump won.
[03:32:19.020 --> 03:32:25.020]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:32:25.020 --> 03:32:29.020]  And that's why the globalist, Hillary, and others are trying to shut in for us now.
[03:32:29.020 --> 03:32:36.020]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:32:36.020 --> 03:32:38.020]  This country is in a war.
[03:32:38.020 --> 03:32:43.020]  So, again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos,
[03:32:43.020 --> 03:32:49.020]  and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:32:49.020 --> 03:33:00.020]  I'm in your hands. You're in my hands. infowarstore.com. Thank you.
[03:33:20.020 --> 03:33:37.020]  Hey, great being on with Alex Jones' show, and info wars, and I thank them for all that they do.
[03:33:37.020 --> 03:33:46.020]  And remember, you do all that you can do to keep supporting them, to get the word out and make it much bigger than it already is.
[03:33:46.020 --> 03:33:54.020]  Because without it, all we're going to keep hearing is the propaganda, or to be proper, I should say, impropaganda,
[03:33:54.020 --> 03:34:06.020]  put out by all these sleazy prostitutes, the people that get paid to put out by their corporate johns and Washington whore masters.
[03:34:06.020 --> 03:34:18.020]  So, again, I put my money where my mouth is, and I love info wars products, high quality, up and down, inside out, to do what you can to support them.
[03:34:18.020 --> 03:34:22.020]  I was talking about the New York Times, the toilet paper of record.
[03:34:22.020 --> 03:34:31.020]  Russia wants U.S. to dredge 5G cell phones, and how there's propaganda piece. It's huge, too.
[03:34:31.020 --> 03:34:38.020]  Look at this front page, front page here of today's toilet paper.
[03:34:38.020 --> 03:34:45.020]  And then big pictures in there, a big picture that means nothing. You know why they had this big photo here?
[03:34:45.020 --> 03:34:55.020]  They had this big photo here because they have less and less reporters, and now they fill up their cartoon newspaper with a moronic photo.
[03:34:55.020 --> 03:35:05.020]  Look at it, that means absolutely nothing. So, pictures take up print, and that's what they do over and over, one page after another.
[03:35:05.020 --> 03:35:17.020]  Going back to the propaganda that they keep selling and the hatred they keep shoving down our throat, who are these sneezers that wrote this?
[03:35:17.020 --> 03:35:21.020]  Well, we have to give credit where credit is due.
[03:35:21.020 --> 03:35:30.020]  William J. Broad. How about Billy Narrow? Narrow Mind Billy.
[03:35:30.020 --> 03:35:40.020]  Billy B.S. Broad. Oh, can't say Broad. I don't want me, too, to come after me. Oh, that's his name. I was only kidding.
[03:35:40.020 --> 03:35:42.020]  Take it easy, everybody.
[03:35:42.020 --> 03:35:57.020]  William J. Broad. Piece of propaganda crap. That's right, Billy Boy. Read the Trends Journal. Everything you wrote about this, 5G is in here in fact.
[03:35:57.020 --> 03:36:03.020]  Here's what else Billy Boy, Narrow, has to say.
[03:36:03.020 --> 03:36:20.020]  Hundreds of blogs and websites appear to be picking up the networks, meaning RTs, 5G alarms, seldom, if ever, noting the Russian origins.
[03:36:20.020 --> 03:36:33.020]  Hey, I can't use the words I'd like to use to call you out, but you piece of garbage. The Russians didn't do our piece. I have anything to do with it.
[03:36:33.020 --> 03:36:44.020]  It was the furthest thought in our mind because we're researchers looking at global research and 5G negativities.
[03:36:44.020 --> 03:36:55.020]  So, and Broad or Narrow, I should say, how come you didn't ask the people from Brussels why they aren't allowing 5G?
[03:36:55.020 --> 03:37:11.020]  Because you're a piece of garbage accusing us of being in bed with the Russians. Broad? No, not a Russian Broad.
[03:37:11.020 --> 03:37:27.020]  You piece of jerk. Off. Here they go again. Analysts call it a treacherous fog.
[03:37:27.020 --> 03:37:43.020]  Ooh, what analysts? This is why you have to support Infowars. Support the trendsjournal, trendsjournal.com. Support the people that speak the truth and nobody can buy us out.
[03:37:43.020 --> 03:37:53.020]  Like this piece of garbage. Crap. Here's what he writes about 5G and why we all should love it so much.
[03:37:53.020 --> 03:38:00.020]  Wireless high speed communications could transform the news industry.
[03:38:00.020 --> 03:38:08.020]  Why is it going to transform by highest speed? You jerk. Oh no, I forgot. I got to keep going.
[03:38:08.020 --> 03:38:21.020]  Oh, and sports. It'll create new sports. Throw that football differently. We have 5G. Get up at bat. Throw that pitch differently. It's 5G.
[03:38:21.020 --> 03:38:30.020]  It'll have nothing to do with that, but you know what we'll have to do with? Shopping. Oh yeah. Entertainment. Transportation.
[03:38:30.020 --> 03:38:42.020]  Yeah, we get on that 5G, man. We're transported across the universe. What up? This is so stupid, so ignorant, so vile.
[03:38:42.020 --> 03:38:52.020]  It's the hatred that they keep selling. Just like they're selling, hackers so discord as vote looms in Europe.
[03:38:52.020 --> 03:38:57.020]  They have the votes now for the EU parliament.
[03:38:57.020 --> 03:39:13.020]  Less than two weeks before pivotal elections to the European Parliament, a constellation of websites and social media accounts linked to Russia or far right groups is spreading disinformation,
[03:39:13.020 --> 03:39:29.020]  encouraging discord and amplifying distrust in the centrist parties that have governed for decades. The centrist parties, a bunch of lion pieces of garbage,
[03:39:29.020 --> 03:39:39.020]  a corrupt government in a country near you that has robbed the people with globalization, created the phony EU parliament,
[03:39:39.020 --> 03:39:47.020]  and the austerity measures that they've shoved down their throat has nothing to do with the Russians.
[03:39:47.020 --> 03:40:04.020]  Let's see who wrote this. Matt Appuzzo and Adam Santariano. Santariano. What garbage. What garbage.
[03:40:04.020 --> 03:40:14.020]  Oh, here's a story in a financial time. German businesses take on populism. That's what they're talking about populism.
[03:40:14.020 --> 03:40:21.020]  The people are tired of being sold out. They don't want floods of migrants and refugees coming into their countries.
[03:40:21.020 --> 03:40:28.020]  Oh, by the way, nobody talks about why the refugees keep flooding into the countries. It couldn't be because of the Libyan war.
[03:40:28.020 --> 03:40:42.020]  That's right. The Libyan war brought to you by the Nobel Peace of Craft Prize winner that everybody loves and adores Barack Obama.
[03:40:42.020 --> 03:40:52.020]  Trends Journal. We wrote a big story in 2011 as it was happening, the war. I'll tell you that Gaddafi has to go. I don't like the way he's treating his people.
[03:40:52.020 --> 03:41:00.020]  Yeah. We wrote the Gaddafi said to all the European leaders, you get rid of me. You're going to have a migrant refugee crisis.
[03:41:00.020 --> 03:41:10.020]  You're not going to handle because he was not allowing refugees or migrants to go out of Libya and into Europe right after he was killed.
[03:41:10.020 --> 03:41:21.020]  Over 500,000 people flooded into Europe. That's right. But that's forgotten. Oh, and again, nobody talks about why they're refugees because all the war started
[03:41:21.020 --> 03:41:33.020]  by the Obama's by the Bush's by the Clintons. Yeah. And by the by the English and by the French and by lovely NATO. Nobody talks about that.
[03:41:33.020 --> 03:41:45.020]  So I was just thinking, you know, you got some crazy kid or a person that blows up innocent people in a school because he doesn't like those people.
[03:41:45.020 --> 03:41:55.020]  What makes that person different in Obama than Bush or Clintons? I don't like that a son. I don't like that who's saying I don't like that Gaddafi.
[03:41:55.020 --> 03:42:06.020]  I'm going to kill anybody that gets an hour away to get rid of him. What's the difference? I'll tell you the difference. No different.
[03:42:06.020 --> 03:42:18.020]  My mind, crazy murder is a crazy murder. What do you call him a president, prime minister or some sick person around the street?
[03:42:18.020 --> 03:42:24.020]  That's why you have to occupy peace as well. That's one of our movements.
[03:42:24.020 --> 03:42:32.020]  This is terrible. What's going on over here? I mentioned German businesses take on populism.
[03:42:32.020 --> 03:42:37.020]  They want to stop the people from wanting their own governments.
[03:42:37.020 --> 03:42:48.020]  They have to be ruled by the globalists. It has nothing to do with the Russian stuff.

[03:47:18.020 --> 03:47:22.020]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.020 --> 03:47:32.020]  Hi, this is Gerald Salenty. Great being on the Alex Jones Show. Great being on InfoWars.
[03:47:32.020 --> 03:47:42.020]  I appreciate all they do to bring out the information that they see is important rather than being told what they should do.
[03:47:42.020 --> 03:47:49.020]  You know, the motto of the trends journalist, think for yourself, but you're not allowed to do that anymore. No, no, no.
[03:47:49.020 --> 03:47:59.020]  Not according to the toilet paper of record. I was mentioning how they are playing this line of a spread of disinformation as European Parliament votes looms.
[03:47:59.020 --> 03:48:05.020]  Let's get this straight. This populist movement has been going on for quite a while.
[03:48:05.020 --> 03:48:14.020]  As the AFD, the alternative for Deutschland and Germany, has nothing to do with the Russians. Oh, the Freedom Party in Austria has nothing to do with the Russians.
[03:48:14.020 --> 03:48:25.020]  As an Italiano, we have Lega and Cinque Stella, the league and five-star movement, have nothing to do with the Russians.
[03:48:25.020 --> 03:48:31.020]  One country after another. Now you have Vox over there in Spain.
[03:48:31.020 --> 03:48:36.020]  Is rising up against the establishment. It has nothing to do with the Russians.
[03:48:36.020 --> 03:48:43.020]  It has to do with people's standard of living declining as the 1% becomes the 0.1%.
[03:48:43.020 --> 03:48:53.020]  Steals more of our money and become bigger. And they are very fearful because who knows the way things are going.
[03:48:53.020 --> 03:48:58.020]  It may be off with their heads 2.0. That's how disgusted the people are.
[03:48:58.020 --> 03:49:04.020]  I mentioned the toilet paper record in New York Times.
[03:49:04.020 --> 03:49:23.020]  Investigators are confident, however, that networks of Facebook profiles, Twitter accounts, WhatsApp groups and websites are spreading false and divisive stories about the European Union, NATO, immigrants and more and more.
[03:49:23.020 --> 03:49:32.020]  Who writes and more? Real writers don't put and more or this kind of garbage without any facts, but they don't need facts.
[03:49:32.020 --> 03:49:50.020]  Because they go on to saying that a long standing debate has been whether this material changes behavior of voters, especially as tech companies have worked to stamp it out.
[03:49:50.020 --> 03:50:05.020]  They're stamping out everything that they don't want you to hear because all they have become is another arm of the government.
[03:50:05.020 --> 03:50:10.020]  And that's again why you have to support InfoWords.
[03:50:10.020 --> 03:50:18.020]  Consider subscribing to the Trends Journal. If we lose our voice, it's over.
[03:50:18.020 --> 03:50:27.020]  Security researchers suggest that swinging elections is a stretch goal for this kind of campaign, if that.
[03:50:27.020 --> 03:50:36.020]  The primary point is to muddle the conversation, make people question what is true and erode trust.
[03:50:36.020 --> 03:50:49.020]  Erode trust in who? How about people figuring out what is true?
[03:50:49.020 --> 03:50:57.020]  No, we'll tell you what's true. We're the mainstream media. We control everything.
[03:50:57.020 --> 03:51:07.020]  I'm only going through parts of this. This is a detailed story. I'm staying on this because it's very important.
[03:51:07.020 --> 03:51:18.020]  The way the media has blackballed InfoWords is disgusting.
[03:51:18.020 --> 03:51:28.020]  There are fake Gerald Salenti blogs up in Gerald Salenti sites. I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to get rid of them.
[03:51:28.020 --> 03:51:39.020]  One court case in New York. Federal District Court forcing Google to take it down.
[03:51:39.020 --> 03:51:50.020]  They're back up and they refuse to take it down. It's all right for them to let fake Gerald Salenti sites up.
[03:51:50.020 --> 03:51:58.020]  That's okay because if somebody's putting out information, it's not mine, but under my name, they like that.
[03:51:58.020 --> 03:52:09.020]  Do what you can to support InfoWords. I want to read you this one line from the Financial Times.
[03:52:09.020 --> 03:52:30.020]  In an interview, the chairman of Deutsche Bank said civil society had to fight back against those who are promising easy populist answers, which are aimed at marginalizing certain social groups.
[03:52:30.020 --> 03:52:46.020]  A similar call came from the German Banking Association, which said it strongly opposed nationalist tendencies, isolationism and protectionism.
[03:52:46.020 --> 03:53:01.020]  Yes, we should believe the banksters. I mean, after all, the criminal banking system. Yeah. How dare we question them?
[03:53:01.020 --> 03:53:17.020]  You know, they did a leavey institute, did a study. Do you know how much the Federal Reserve, the central bank, pumped into the markets to pump up the banksters and the big corporations under the lovely Obama administration?
[03:53:17.020 --> 03:53:32.020]  No, not $9 billion, according to Bloomberg. They missed a 20 in it. Excuse me, I said million. Not $9 trillion. $29 trillion.
[03:53:32.020 --> 03:53:47.020]  And the banksters are complaining about populist movements, complaining that people don't want flood of foreigners coming into their country.
[03:53:47.020 --> 03:53:59.020]  This is the kind of garbage that they're putting out. They even say in this stupid story that they need more foreigners coming in because you're ready for this.
[03:53:59.020 --> 03:54:07.020]  I'm a trend forecaster. I know how to do forecasting, been out of for a long time, almost 40 years.
[03:54:07.020 --> 03:54:23.020]  The recent study found that German economy requires at least 260,000 immigrant workers a year. You ready? By 2060, to make up for the negative demographic trends in the German labor market.
[03:54:23.020 --> 03:54:29.020]  Nobody can figure out what's going to happen between now and 2060.
[03:54:29.020 --> 03:54:38.020]  So I want to mention something quick about the markets down a lot today because of the quote trade wars. We don't see a trade war coming.
[03:54:38.020 --> 03:54:49.020]  Our deficit keeps building. I believe totally in Trump on this one, totally against them on Venezuela and Iran. I agree with them on this.
[03:54:49.020 --> 03:55:11.020]  And again, the toilet paper record does a hit on this showing all the things that we would be paying more money for if they were made in the United States, like apparel, wooden shingles, mattress supports, Christmas lights.
[03:55:11.020 --> 03:55:28.020]  Consumers will feel the pinch. Hey, we wrote this. Jim Tankersley, Jimmy Boy, if they were made in the United States, the people would be making more money and they would love to pay more for it.
[03:55:28.020 --> 03:55:41.020]  But no, we got to buy stuff made from slave labor and all the corporations sold us out. And, oh, Biden's running for president. Thank Billy, Joey Biden for this.
[03:55:41.020 --> 03:55:50.020]  Bill Clinton gave us that. Yep, we're shining to the World Trade Organization. Don't worry, they're a communist country. We love them commies now.
[03:55:50.020 --> 03:56:04.020]  Oh, the world's biggest communist country by far. But we had to hate those Russian commies. Oh, we had to hate those commies too when we destroyed Vietnam. But now it's OK to do business with all of them because we're making more money.
[03:56:04.020 --> 03:56:14.020]  Watch gold prices. Gold prices are up sharp today, not real big, up about 13 bucks, hovering around $1,300 an ounce.
[03:56:14.020 --> 03:56:26.020]  If gold prices skyrocket, and I'm talking, we're looking at $1,400 an ounce gold that goes up $150 and where it is, then the trade war is real.
[03:56:26.020 --> 03:56:36.020]  If gold prices just keep playing and they're not going to be a trade war, they're going to come to a deal. The order to deal, as Trump would say, we're right about.
[03:56:36.020 --> 03:56:47.020]  So anyway, people that are complaining about this, it's garbage. Who would do business under these conditions? So watch gold prices. Gold is the barometer, it's a safe haven asset.
[03:56:47.020 --> 03:56:58.020]  But gold goes, the markets go. I believe there's going to be a trade deal, and it's going to be a big issue in the 2020 presidential reality show.
[03:56:58.020 --> 03:57:08.020]  Even Bernie Sanders will give you free education, free health care. Even he's talking about Trump isn't tough enough on NAFTA.
[03:57:08.020 --> 03:57:16.020]  Hey, but Bernie says it's OK if Trump says it and the media comes down. So watch what's going on.
[03:57:16.020 --> 03:57:30.020]  Watch the markets closely for this week. See if they keep sliding down. When they hit new highs, there's usually a 5% correction. We think that's more of what this is than trade wars.
[03:57:30.020 --> 03:57:42.020]  So thank you again for tuning in. Do what you can to support info wars. Put your money where your mind is, because if you don't, they're going to control your mind and they're doing it now.
[03:57:42.020 --> 03:57:50.020]  The globalists are hyper competitive, scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words.
[03:57:50.020 --> 03:57:57.020]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[03:57:57.020 --> 03:58:02.020]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[03:58:02.020 --> 03:58:13.020]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4slife.com, I couldn't do it.
