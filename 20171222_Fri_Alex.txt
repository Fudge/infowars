[00:00.000 --> 00:08.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have got gigantic news to break down today, absolute must-watch.
[00:08.480 --> 00:11.480]  Let's go ahead and go to this John Bowne report first, it's very important.
[00:11.480 --> 00:15.160]  This is going to mean companies are going to be coming back, you know, I campaigned on
[00:15.160 --> 00:19.360]  the fact that we're not going to lose our companies anymore, they're going to stay in
[00:19.360 --> 00:22.800]  our country, and they're going to stay in our country, and you've been seeing what's
[00:22.800 --> 00:27.440]  been happening even at this prospect, but they have tremendous enthusiasm right now
[00:27.440 --> 00:32.840]  in this country, and we have companies pouring back into our country, and that means jobs,
[00:32.840 --> 00:37.680]  and it means really the formation of new, young, beautiful, strong companies, so that's
[00:37.680 --> 00:40.080]  going to be very, very important.
[00:40.080 --> 00:45.040]  The pass-throughs you know all about, and the small businesses are going to be big beneficiaries,
[00:45.040 --> 00:49.560]  we are going to bring at least four trillion dollars back into this country, money that
[00:49.560 --> 00:55.200]  was frozen overseas, and in parts and worlds, and some of them don't even like us, and they
[00:55.200 --> 01:02.160]  had the money, well they're not going to have the money long, and so it's really, I guess
[01:02.160 --> 01:10.000]  it's very simple, when you think you haven't heard this expression, but we are making America
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.320]  great, again, you haven't heard that, haven't you?
[01:14.320 --> 01:19.400]  On one hand, the Democrats, whose policies of expanding welfare, adding 10 billion to
[01:19.400 --> 01:25.160]  our national debt, and the disastrous unconstitutional Obamacare disruption, pleaded with the American
[01:25.160 --> 01:31.120]  people that they have become increasingly detached from to believe their doomsday scenario
[01:31.120 --> 01:35.080]  regarding the passing of the Republican tax reform bill.
[01:35.080 --> 01:39.560]  Republicans head to the White House for their back slapping and high fives to celebrate
[01:39.560 --> 01:43.840]  passage of a bill against the will of the American people.
[01:43.840 --> 01:48.240]  We have a simple message for our Republican friends.
[01:48.240 --> 01:53.800]  Publicans will rue the day they pass this bill, and you can bet Democrats will make
[01:53.800 --> 01:55.920]  sure of that.
[01:55.920 --> 02:03.000]  We are going to continue to hammer away at why this bill is so unpopular, at why what
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.600]  the Republican rhetoric and the reality is so far apart.
[02:09.600 --> 02:15.360]  Today's passage of the partisan tax bill officially cements the Republican party as the party
[02:15.360 --> 02:22.760]  of the wealthy corporations against the middle class and the working people of this country.
[02:22.760 --> 02:28.160]  On the other hand, Republicans defended the intentions of the bill and endured Democratic
[02:28.160 --> 02:31.000]  talking points from media prostitutes.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.760]  To bring relief to the American families and Nevada families just across this nation, the
[02:35.760 --> 02:43.240]  fact that we're able to create jobs, increase pay wages, and also make sure that our businesses
[02:43.240 --> 02:47.560]  are competitive around this nation makes this a very, very important day.
[02:47.560 --> 02:52.880]  What do you say to Senator Schumer, though, that you guys are going to rue the day that
[02:52.880 --> 02:58.400]  you pass this bill, that the politics of passing long-term, corporate cuts, but short-term,
[02:58.400 --> 03:02.640]  individual cuts is going to catch up to you guys?
[03:02.640 --> 03:06.200]  Your job is to use the Democratic talking points, I understand that.
[03:06.200 --> 03:14.120]  Look, we believe that this product will do two extremely important things for the country.
[03:14.120 --> 03:22.400]  Number one, provide middle-class tax relief, and number two, provide business changes that
[03:22.400 --> 03:24.680]  make us more competitive.
[03:24.680 --> 03:28.920]  With regard to the termination dates, let me tell you what terminates this tax cut.
[03:28.920 --> 03:40.640]  The Democrats taking the Congress next November would turn this into a very short tax bill.
[03:40.640 --> 03:46.400]  So I think focusing on dates that may expire because of the need to fit the reconciliation
[03:46.400 --> 03:49.480]  rules missed the point.
[03:49.480 --> 03:53.280]  Every single Democrat voted for this, they're all committed to repealing and raising taxes
[03:53.280 --> 03:54.920]  on the American people.
[03:54.920 --> 03:58.120]  That's what's at stake in the fall of 2018.
[03:58.120 --> 04:01.040]  All in all, the proof will be in the pudding.
[04:01.040 --> 04:06.080]  After Trump did in his first year what Obama couldn't do in eight, rallying the American
[04:06.080 --> 04:12.040]  economy to 3% GDP growth before the bill was even signed by the president, Wells Fargo
[04:12.040 --> 04:16.880]  and Fifth Third Bank have called for a raise in the minimum wage of their employees while
[04:16.880 --> 04:23.400]  AT&T and Comcast are giving hundreds of thousands of their employees $1,000 bonuses.
[04:23.400 --> 04:28.680]  And when the economic boom continues as a result of this tax reform, maybe it's time
[04:28.680 --> 04:33.880]  that we consider scrapping the Democratic Party, a party that has become nothing more
[04:33.880 --> 04:37.400]  than a bulwark against true American progress.
[04:37.400 --> 05:07.360]  John Bown reporting for Infowars.com.
[05:07.360 --> 05:31.720]  Thank you so much, Alex, for the Infowars live products.
[05:31.720 --> 05:32.720]  They are quality.
[05:32.720 --> 05:38.920]  I can't wait to get some more and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[05:38.920 --> 05:44.640]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand
[05:44.640 --> 05:49.200]  that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good
[05:49.200 --> 06:15.200]  to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[06:15.200 --> 06:40.200]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:40.200 --> 06:51.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[06:51.880 --> 07:01.080]  We're broadcasting worldwide on this Friday, already the 22nd day of December 2017.
[07:01.080 --> 07:03.760]  The year is almost over.
[07:03.760 --> 07:09.760]  I intend to open the phones up today and I intend to cover all the really huge breaking
[07:09.760 --> 07:10.760]  news.
[07:10.760 --> 07:14.880]  We're going to have Lieutenant Colonel Matt Smith-Mech popping back in for part of the
[07:14.880 --> 07:21.280]  next hour to discuss the big news about Obama protecting Hezbollah and allowing them to
[07:21.280 --> 07:28.160]  deal drugs inside the United States and procure weapons inside the United States to then transfer
[07:28.160 --> 07:33.680]  them from Mexico down into Central and South America and then trans ship into the Middle
[07:33.680 --> 07:34.680]  East.
[07:34.680 --> 07:40.560]  It's beyond Reagan's Iran Contra where some elements of the CIA allowed cocaine to come
[07:40.560 --> 07:45.840]  to the United States to finance taking out communists and the Sandinistas, which is
[07:45.840 --> 07:48.400]  bad enough in my book, shouldn't be done.
[07:48.400 --> 07:54.120]  This is letting Islamists do it and Iran do it to go topple governments in the Middle
[07:54.120 --> 07:55.120]  East.
[07:55.120 --> 08:02.960]  So, just next level stuff and that is all coming out now and Matt Smith-Mech was here
[08:02.960 --> 08:06.520]  over a year ago, March of last year, breaking it down so he's going to be popping in but
[08:06.520 --> 08:09.160]  we're going to have open phones throughout the transmission.
[08:09.160 --> 08:15.400]  You know Eric Schmidt is out at Google as the head of it, he's still part owner of it
[08:15.400 --> 08:17.080]  and they're saying, oh, why is that?
[08:17.080 --> 08:21.920]  All the women he loads on his jumbo jet reportedly up to 15 at a time, that's no crime right
[08:21.920 --> 08:22.920]  there.
[08:22.920 --> 08:27.840]  No, the issue is that he's a globalist, he's been anti-Trump the whole time and Google
[08:27.840 --> 08:33.760]  is about to get broken up, ladies and gentlemen, the new head of the Securities and Exchange
[08:33.760 --> 08:39.560]  Commission has been very, very weary of Google for years before he was put in as the head
[08:39.560 --> 08:45.480]  of it by President Trump a few months ago and all the stars are aligning to break up
[08:45.480 --> 08:52.600]  these groups that are anti-free market, anti-free speech and have been censoring massively and
[08:52.600 --> 08:55.760]  they've been caught censoring massively, they've been caught working with the foreign
[08:55.760 --> 09:02.080]  libertarian regimes, Facebook, Twitter, Google, you name it and all the chickens are now coming
[09:02.080 --> 09:06.960]  home to roost so you get next month's news today, next year's news today, always tomorrow's
[09:06.960 --> 09:12.880]  news today, here at Info Wars, there's lots of speculation about why is that happening?
[09:12.880 --> 09:18.520]  Well it's happening because Google basically controlled the Obama government and they have
[09:18.520 --> 09:28.360]  been arrogantly trying to steamroll the president, they have been fighting with everything they've
[09:28.360 --> 09:38.520]  got and now they have been caught in a big, big way so all of that is going to be unfolding
[09:38.520 --> 09:40.600]  ladies and gentlemen.
[09:40.600 --> 09:47.200]  Also we've got reports here out of the New York Times and this is really the big news,
[09:47.200 --> 09:52.320]  New York Times column says Trump is about the stage of coup.
[09:52.320 --> 09:57.480]  Now Trump was elected, Trump passed a tax bill, Trump killed the TPP that the president
[09:57.480 --> 10:01.320]  could do because that was done through executive power, it was unconstitutional, he could kill
[10:01.320 --> 10:07.720]  it, everything he's done has been within the Constitution, federal courts said he couldn't
[10:07.720 --> 10:12.440]  block people from unvetted nations.
[10:12.440 --> 10:18.760]  Put in, ladies and gentlemen, what happened?
[10:18.760 --> 10:19.760]  What unfolded?
[10:19.760 --> 10:22.680]  The Supreme Court said nine to zero, he could.
[10:22.680 --> 10:28.320]  So everything he's done has been constitutional, they're the ones trying to overthrow the president,
[10:28.320 --> 10:34.600]  they're the ones openly saying that they are going to try to kill it on daily basis, they're
[10:34.600 --> 10:41.200]  the ones saying they want a civil war and to resist and to overthrow things and then
[10:41.200 --> 10:45.280]  every time we point that out they go, oh Alex Jones is crazy, that's not happening, well
[10:45.280 --> 10:46.760]  here it is.
[10:46.760 --> 10:50.280]  New York Times column says Trump is about the stage of coup, we're going to get to that.
[10:50.280 --> 10:55.600]  Then there's this little jewel on infowars.com, former Obama advisor and White House press
[10:55.600 --> 11:01.400]  briefer calls for death of GOP leadership on Twitter.
[11:01.400 --> 11:09.040]  Congressman Scalise sent him a tweet back and said you really should reassess what you're
[11:09.040 --> 11:14.920]  saying and what you're doing, this is very, very dangerous, meanwhile media matters takes
[11:14.920 --> 11:17.840]  our tongue and cheek piece we did at the shooting range, Roger Stone and I.
[11:17.840 --> 11:21.960]  Alex Jones and Roger Stone visited the gun range to prepare for civil war if Trump is
[11:21.960 --> 11:22.960]  removed from office.
[11:22.960 --> 11:26.120]  And of course we're just pointing out that they're the ones calling for violence for
[11:26.120 --> 11:30.280]  the overthrow, all we're saying is we will defend ourselves, they try to spin that that
[11:30.280 --> 11:35.280]  it's a call for violence as they always do.
[11:35.280 --> 11:43.720]  So that is going to be coming up here, but every day another Obama administration official,
[11:43.720 --> 11:48.680]  another organization, another group comes out and says we want to kill the Republicans,
[11:48.680 --> 11:52.480]  we want to kill the president, we want to get Alex Jones, we want to do all of this
[11:52.480 --> 11:58.320]  and when we sit there and point out that it's wrong, when we point out that it's them trying
[11:58.320 --> 12:03.600]  to stop our democratic process they go, we're not saying that, we're not doing that but
[12:03.600 --> 12:13.680]  now as they get more and more and more and more hysterical, they're getting more dangerous
[12:13.680 --> 12:14.680]  by the minute.
[12:14.680 --> 12:19.080]  So we've all got to ask ourselves what is going to be coming out of this here in the
[12:19.080 --> 12:26.080]  near future, that's a big, big question, but you know what, I want to go ahead and get
[12:26.080 --> 12:31.640]  into a very, very important area here, this clip from Congressman Jim Jordan and how the
[12:31.640 --> 12:39.800]  media is spinning all of this and spinning everything, saying that he's got talking points
[12:39.800 --> 12:43.840]  and the Republicans are getting talking points from Trump when they talk about the emails
[12:43.840 --> 12:53.760]  and the text messages and everything where the Democrats, the FBI, the Justice Department
[12:53.760 --> 12:58.760]  people, the deputy director at the time, McCabe, are meeting trying to fix the information
[12:58.760 --> 13:01.720]  and make it up and have the insurance policy.
[13:01.720 --> 13:04.280]  Those aren't talking points, those are the facts.
[13:04.280 --> 13:08.240]  If you dig a dead body up in somebody's backyard and catch them killing other people and it
[13:08.240 --> 13:11.480]  goes to trial, it's not a talking point, it's evidence.
[13:11.480 --> 13:14.960]  If you catch your kid with their hand in the cookie jar, it's not talking points, it's
[13:14.960 --> 13:16.600]  catching them red handed.
[13:16.600 --> 13:21.120]  If you catch a guy in bed with your wife, it's not talking points, it's prima facia,
[13:21.120 --> 13:22.800]  it's on its face.
[13:22.800 --> 13:25.800]  So here he is talking about it, I haven't talked to the White House about talking points
[13:25.800 --> 13:28.680]  in Mueller investigation, here's CNN.
[13:28.680 --> 13:33.920]  Have you had conversations or has your office had conversations with the White House about
[13:33.920 --> 13:36.560]  the Mueller investigation?
[13:36.560 --> 13:40.600]  We just had Mr. Sessions, Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. Reinfarms, I did not talk to the White
[13:40.600 --> 13:43.600]  House about what kind of questions I was going to ask, I based it on the evidence and the
[13:43.600 --> 13:46.520]  facts that have come out.
[13:46.520 --> 13:49.080]  How do you get around the text message?
[13:49.080 --> 13:52.480]  Have you had conversations with the White House not about the questions you asked but
[13:52.480 --> 13:55.680]  about the Mueller investigation in general?
[13:55.680 --> 13:58.720]  I've talked with the White House about all kinds of things, we've had talks with the
[13:58.720 --> 14:01.840]  White House about tax policy, we've had talks about welfare policy, we've had talks about
[14:01.840 --> 14:04.720]  Obamacare, of course we've had talks with the White House.
[14:04.720 --> 14:08.800]  But my questions in those committees was driven by the evidence we've received in the last
[14:08.800 --> 14:13.560]  several weeks, like the text message from Peter Strucker, he says where we can't afford
[14:13.560 --> 14:16.520]  to take the risk that the American people are going to elect Donald Trump, so we need
[14:16.520 --> 14:17.520]  an insurance policy?
[14:17.520 --> 14:21.720]  If that doesn't go to intent to have a plan to disrupt the election, I don't know what
[14:21.720 --> 14:22.720]  it does.
[14:22.720 --> 14:24.320]  I want to talk about your argument here in a second, but I'm trying to get to the issue
[14:24.320 --> 14:30.320]  of coordination, you just said, of course we talked to the White House about the Mueller
[14:30.320 --> 14:31.320]  investigation.
[14:31.320 --> 14:34.800]  No, no, but do you talk about talking points or are there talking points on the Mueller
[14:34.800 --> 14:35.800]  investigation?
[14:35.800 --> 14:36.800]  Of course not, of course not.
[14:36.800 --> 14:40.920]  But here's the coordination, the Clinton campaign and the DNC, now we know those are
[14:40.920 --> 14:46.040]  one and the same, paid the law firm, who paid Fusion GPS, who paid Christopher Steele,
[14:46.040 --> 14:52.000]  who paid Russians to get this dossier that was we think taken to the FISA court and was
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.560]  the basis for securing warrants to spy on Americans.
[14:54.560 --> 15:00.400]  If you let me, if you let me, if you let me, I will get to this, I will get to the dossier
[15:00.400 --> 15:03.880]  and the FBI, your charge is on the FBI in just a second, but I want to finish up on
[15:03.880 --> 15:04.880]  this issue of coordination.
[15:04.880 --> 15:05.880]  Those are facts, those are facts.
[15:05.880 --> 15:08.360]  I want to get to the issue, I want to stay on the issue of coordination for one second.
[15:08.360 --> 15:10.360]  I want to talk about the coordination we know.
[15:10.360 --> 15:11.360]  Here's the coordination.
[15:11.360 --> 15:12.360]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[15:12.360 --> 15:17.240]  You've been on Fox News when you say that the FBI was acting to keep Donald Trump from
[15:17.240 --> 15:18.760]  being President of the United States.
[15:18.760 --> 15:21.600]  Before you go on Fox News, do you talk to them?
[15:21.600 --> 15:25.120]  Do you talk to them about these claims that you will make?
[15:25.120 --> 15:29.440]  I talk to my colleagues, I look at the evidence, and I talk with our press people who book
[15:29.440 --> 15:34.120]  us on your show, and we talk about the coordination that exists between the Clinton campaign and
[15:34.120 --> 15:35.120]  the Russians.
[15:35.120 --> 15:36.120]  Now think about this.
[15:36.120 --> 15:39.240]  We know, for a fact, the Clinton campaign paid Russians to do what?
[15:39.240 --> 15:40.240]  To influence the election.
[15:40.240 --> 15:41.240]  Congressman?
[15:41.240 --> 15:44.880]  And yet we've had this month-long investigation by Bob Mueller with no evidence that President
[15:44.880 --> 15:46.880]  Trump worked with Russians in any way to court him.
[15:46.880 --> 15:47.880]  Well, Congressman, well, Congressman, hang on.
[15:47.880 --> 15:48.880]  Hang on, hang on.
[15:48.880 --> 15:49.880]  But we know the Democrats did.
[15:49.880 --> 15:54.160]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, but that's how they try to change the subject.
[15:54.160 --> 15:55.160]  Stay with us.
[15:55.160 --> 16:25.000]  We'll be right back.
[16:56.160 --> 16:58.760]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.

[19:59.760 --> 20:03.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:03.760 --> 20:30.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[20:30.160 --> 20:33.040]  Let me give you an idea of some of what's coming up.
[20:33.040 --> 20:40.760]  Dr. Camille Paglia wrote earlier this year that transgender propagandists are committing
[20:40.760 --> 20:45.120]  child abuse when they go into children three, four, five, six, seven years old and tell
[20:45.120 --> 20:46.640]  them, well, you may not really be a girl.
[20:46.640 --> 20:47.640]  You may not really be a boy.
[20:47.640 --> 20:49.160]  You may be something else.
[20:49.160 --> 20:54.080]  And then now they're going to push gear in the schools on the children where little girls
[20:54.080 --> 20:57.800]  will wear fake genitals.
[20:57.800 --> 21:02.440]  And I'm going to get into that and who's pushing it and what's happening coming up.
[21:02.440 --> 21:03.440]  Wait until you see this.
[21:03.440 --> 21:06.800]  You cannot make this up.
[21:06.800 --> 21:10.200]  And they talk about, we've got the gear for your children.
[21:10.200 --> 21:11.960]  I mean, I don't even really know what that means.
[21:11.960 --> 21:12.960]  I had to look it up.
[21:12.960 --> 21:15.240]  That's all fetishized stuff.
[21:15.240 --> 21:19.400]  I mean, I just, it's a sexualization of children has gone into mock speed.
[21:19.400 --> 21:20.400]  That's coming up.
[21:20.400 --> 21:23.040]  Also, Facebook, we've talked about this, but it's back in the niche and they're getting
[21:23.040 --> 21:24.880]  a lot of trouble for it now.
[21:24.880 --> 21:29.640]  Facebook team helping regimes that fight their opposition, even Bloomberg admits that, but
[21:29.640 --> 21:36.560]  they're doing the same thing here and then it ties into Apple being caught slowing down
[21:36.560 --> 21:38.040]  and killing old phones.
[21:38.040 --> 21:39.040]  They're being sued for that.
[21:39.040 --> 21:43.160]  We knew that was happening and surveillance cams, face scans help China make thousands
[21:43.160 --> 21:48.360]  vanish, gets into all the incredible oppression in China, how they're using social network
[21:48.360 --> 21:55.000]  digital scores to control everybody, AP exclusive, digital police state shackles Chinese minority.
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.560]  But that's what the Washington Post is calling for censorship here of yours truly.
[21:59.560 --> 22:04.520]  So the very programs developed and refined in China of digital oppression are coming
[22:04.520 --> 22:09.560]  here and the very people bringing in here out of the other side of their mouth are criticizing
[22:09.560 --> 22:10.560]  China.
[22:10.560 --> 22:11.560]  This is a big deal.
[22:11.560 --> 22:16.280]  And in many cases, working with China, working with Pakistan, working with others to literally
[22:16.280 --> 22:21.760]  have them arrested for being Christian and disappeared or for being Buddhist.
[22:21.760 --> 22:24.040]  And these sites are more than willing to do it.
[22:24.040 --> 22:28.400]  They're extreme authoritarians with a fake liberal covering.
[22:28.400 --> 22:29.400]  That's how they get away with it.
[22:29.400 --> 22:33.320]  And of course, you see all of that hypocrisy now coming out.
[22:33.320 --> 22:38.240]  But before I go to break and come back with the big news, they're clearly pushing a civil
[22:38.240 --> 22:39.240]  war.
[22:39.240 --> 22:41.560]  They're clearly pushing an attempt to have a coup against the president.
[22:41.560 --> 22:46.400]  We have more Obama administration officials and others calling for it today and yesterday
[22:46.400 --> 22:50.240]  and then saying that Trump is about to stage a coup.
[22:50.240 --> 22:58.320]  When everything he's done has been constitutional, the real coup plot is Trump's is the ridiculous
[22:58.320 --> 23:00.560]  article from the New York Times.
[23:00.560 --> 23:02.680]  So that's all coming up.
[23:02.680 --> 23:03.680]  See, we warn of this.
[23:03.680 --> 23:04.680]  We're crazy.
[23:04.680 --> 23:05.680]  It doesn't exist.
[23:05.680 --> 23:06.680]  But they're the ones actually calling for it.
[23:06.680 --> 23:13.040]  But then, when Trump's doing nothing but restoring the republic, they call that a coup
[23:13.040 --> 23:16.360]  because it's a counter coup against the globalist takeover of the country.
[23:16.360 --> 23:23.120]  But notice, securing the borders more, deploying more sovereignty to our constitution, to our
[23:23.120 --> 23:28.280]  republic, empowering that in the courts, getting a good Supreme Court justice appointed
[23:28.280 --> 23:34.080]  and getting other good federal judges appointed, getting the big tax cuts passed, getting the
[23:34.080 --> 23:41.960]  stock market way up, getting record new hiring and jobs total over the top, incredible miraculous
[23:41.960 --> 23:44.360]  in the first year.
[23:44.360 --> 23:50.000]  Meanwhile, mainstream media grudgingly has to admit the incredible benefits of this for
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.440]  working class and middle class taxpayers.
[23:54.440 --> 23:58.400]  Not only panics the establishment more as their Mueller investigation falls apart.
[23:58.400 --> 24:03.320]  So again, they say Trump is the one doing authoritarian things when they're the ones
[24:03.320 --> 24:07.240]  that have been caught engaged in the authoritarianism and are now getting in trouble for their
[24:07.240 --> 24:11.860]  illegal spying on the American people, their illegal leaking and all the other things illegally
[24:11.860 --> 24:17.440]  letting the U.N. import all the quote refugees and putting us under a migration treaty that
[24:17.440 --> 24:22.760]  was never signed by the president, never passed by Congress, but just implemented by Fiat.
[24:22.760 --> 24:24.560]  Trump is pulling us out of all that.
[24:24.560 --> 24:29.600]  So they see that as a coup because he's chopping off all the globalist tentacles that it almost
[24:29.600 --> 24:32.200]  completely destroyed this nation.
[24:32.200 --> 24:36.960]  You're seeing a miraculous turnaround as soon as the poison of globalism isn't being injected
[24:36.960 --> 24:37.960]  into our veins.
[24:37.960 --> 24:42.880]  Here's a few minutes of the president just an hour and a half ago signing the historic
[24:42.880 --> 24:45.480]  tax bill that passed a few days ago.
[24:45.480 --> 24:46.480]  Here it is.
[24:46.480 --> 24:53.280]  We are going to sign some very important things today.
[24:53.280 --> 25:00.000]  One is a continuing resolution that very importantly gives us the right and we are ordering four
[25:00.000 --> 25:06.240]  billion dollars worth of missile defense equipment and missiles themselves.
[25:06.240 --> 25:07.240]  Very important.
[25:07.240 --> 25:08.240]  Top of the line.
[25:08.240 --> 25:09.240]  Best in the world.
[25:09.240 --> 25:14.160]  We make the best military product in the world and nobody is even close.
[25:14.160 --> 25:19.960]  So we're ordering four billion dollars worth of missile defense and that will be done by
[25:19.960 --> 25:27.600]  signing right here and also by notifying the Speaker of the House and President of the
[25:27.600 --> 25:35.040]  Senate designating the missile defense as an emergency defense fund so it's four billion
[25:35.040 --> 25:41.400]  dollars for that and seven hundred million dollars for various other military forms of
[25:41.400 --> 25:45.400]  equipment and I'm very honored to be doing that our military has been doing a fantastic
[25:45.400 --> 25:50.680]  job in so many ways with ISIS and everything they're touching lately has been working out
[25:50.680 --> 26:03.280]  so we're signing that.
[26:03.280 --> 26:12.320]  This is the letter to Mitch McConnell and separately to Paul Ryan authorizing that having to do
[26:12.320 --> 26:29.200]  with missile defense.
[26:29.200 --> 26:37.560]  And that's what we call triggering right there that big old bold signature law and they know
[26:37.560 --> 26:38.560]  they're up against prosperity.
[26:38.560 --> 26:40.960]  The globalists want to kill prosperity in their own documents.
[26:40.960 --> 26:45.600]  So that's being done today and that's going to be sent out and then when I watched the
[26:45.600 --> 26:53.480]  news as you know we had the largest tax cuts in our history just approved and I was going
[26:53.480 --> 26:58.000]  to wait for a formal signing sometime in early January but then I watched the news this morning
[26:58.000 --> 27:03.480]  and they were all saying will he keep his promise will he sign it by Christmas.
[27:03.480 --> 27:10.280]  But will he sign it by Christmas and I called downstairs I said get it ready we have to
[27:10.280 --> 27:16.840]  sign it now we're going to wait till January 7th or 8th and do a big formal ceremony but
[27:16.840 --> 27:21.760]  every one of the networks was saying will he keep his promise will he sign it for Christmas
[27:21.760 --> 27:27.840]  before Christmas and so I immediately called I said let's get it ready as you know 3.2
[27:27.840 --> 27:33.520]  trillion dollars in tax cuts for American families including the doubling of the standard
[27:33.520 --> 27:39.000]  deduction and the doubling of the child tax credit.
[27:39.000 --> 27:47.400]  The typical family of four earning $75,000 we see an income tax cut of more than $2,000
[27:47.400 --> 27:52.840]  many much higher than that slashing their tax bill in half and they're going to start
[27:52.840 --> 27:58.080]  to see that because we're signing today they're going to start to see that in February.
[27:58.080 --> 28:02.240]  The numbers will speak one of the big things that happened you have some great companies
[28:02.240 --> 28:07.760]  I want to thank AT&T who actually was the first out of the box and Boeing and Sinclair
[28:07.760 --> 28:14.840]  and Wells Fargo and Comcast even though they own NBC which is not so nice to the presidency
[28:14.840 --> 28:22.920]  or the president but Comcast also they all have made tremendous contributions to their
[28:22.920 --> 28:27.640]  employees and tremendous contributions to spending money in this country because of
[28:27.640 --> 28:33.040]  the tax bill and they all say that down because of the tax we're going to come back with more
[28:33.040 --> 28:36.880]  of this on the other side because it's so important and again that's called presidential
[28:36.880 --> 28:42.080]  leadership now even a lot of globalist companies are going okay we're going to be $1,000, $2,000
[28:42.080 --> 28:46.200]  extra bonuses on top of what you got and we're going to move more stuff back here because
[28:46.200 --> 28:53.200]  they can now before you could not compete he's just removing the unfair barriers of

[32:29.280 --> 32:34.240]  up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers non-gmo made right

[33:09.280 --> 33:37.680]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance
[33:37.680 --> 33:42.440]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting worldwide I am your host Alex Jones and it
[33:42.440 --> 33:49.280]  is the 22nd day of December 2017 thank you so much for tuning into the transmission okay
[33:49.280 --> 33:56.920]  let's get right back to the historic tax cuts massive across the board designed to get rid
[33:56.920 --> 34:02.000]  of the globalist barriers that have artificially deindustrialized our nation and allowed the
[34:02.000 --> 34:08.480]  globalist corporations to parlay American gravitas power wealth and military strength
[34:08.480 --> 34:15.360]  ingenuity into a planetary takeover not of America of the world but of the globalist
[34:15.360 --> 34:22.080]  over the nation states and all over the planet that authoritarian operation is coming under
[34:22.080 --> 34:29.800]  major scrutiny major heat major legislative and major populist resistance and that's
[34:29.800 --> 34:37.520]  the facts we're living in an incredibly historic time right now there's a real war going on
[34:37.520 --> 34:43.600]  for the future of humanity against authoritarian unelected private world government and nation
[34:43.600 --> 34:49.000]  states doesn't mean our nation states are perfect but they're here they're local they're
[34:49.000 --> 34:54.840]  made up of us and we can take our country back we can take our world back and it's
[34:54.840 --> 34:59.960]  beginning to happen right now by the way Nikki Haley at the UN threatened to basically pull
[34:59.960 --> 35:07.800]  US funding the US pays close to half the UN funding if they try to basically override
[35:07.800 --> 35:14.560]  the United States and it's moved to put a embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem we've got
[35:14.560 --> 35:19.760]  that report coming up we've got the market roaring forward on news of the massive tax
[35:19.760 --> 35:26.120]  cuts but the next segment I'm going to drill into congressman Scalicia's response to Obama
[35:26.120 --> 35:36.400]  advisor Obama press briefer Ben Rhodes talking about killing GOP leaders and their obituaries
[35:36.400 --> 35:41.920]  and all the rest of it so that's coming up you know Fox News kind of spins it and says
[35:41.920 --> 35:45.760]  oh they're just joking about it no they're not joking about it they're dead serious
[35:45.760 --> 35:51.680]  up on info wars dot com former Obama advisor calls for death of GOP leadership on Twitter
[35:51.680 --> 35:56.320]  so that is coming up then it ties into that New York Times article that I was mentioning
[35:56.320 --> 36:01.480]  but first I want to finish up with the few minutes of the president just a few hours
[36:01.480 --> 36:10.200]  ago breaking down the historic tax cuts that he was signing and the big fact that he ceremonially
[36:10.200 --> 36:14.120]  said okay it's law but they were going to wait until January that's customary on those
[36:14.120 --> 36:22.920]  type bills in the new year but that the media kept saying oh it's all a lie he didn't really
[36:22.920 --> 36:28.600]  plan to sign it it's all fake and so he said okay we'll do it right now I mean that's how
[36:28.600 --> 36:35.760]  they spin every single point that's how they invert into upside down land so let's go ahead
[36:35.760 --> 36:42.080]  and go to the rest of the president AT&T who actually was the first out of the box and
[36:42.080 --> 36:48.080]  Boeing and Sinclair and Wells Fargo and Comcast even though they own NBC which is not so nice
[36:48.080 --> 36:57.480]  to the presidency or the president but Comcast also they all have made tremendous contributions
[36:57.480 --> 37:03.120]  to their employees and tremendous contributions to spending money in this country because of
[37:03.120 --> 37:08.680]  the tax bill and they all said it's because of the tax bill so they're making tremendous
[37:08.680 --> 37:14.600]  investments that means jobs means a lot of things and we're very happy so that's AT&T
[37:14.600 --> 37:20.160]  Boeing Sinclair Wells Fargo Comcast and now many other companies as you see in fact just
[37:20.160 --> 37:26.800]  this morning I see three more companies came on a friend of mine Bob Kraft called me last
[37:26.800 --> 37:31.240]  night he said this tax bill is incredible he owns the New England Patriots but he's in
[37:31.240 --> 37:37.920]  the paper business too and he said based on this tax bill he just wanted to let me know
[37:37.920 --> 37:45.000]  that he's going to buy a big plant in the great state of North Carolina and he's going
[37:45.000 --> 37:51.520]  to build a tremendous paper mill there or paper products plant and I've had many calls
[37:51.520 --> 37:56.400]  such as that where people that are entrepreneurs people in business they're going out and they're
[37:56.400 --> 38:02.680]  going to buy frankly factories that are closed abandoned and now they're not going to be
[38:02.680 --> 38:08.320]  abandoned any longer stop there for me and even that that's critical because again the
[38:08.320 --> 38:14.320]  climate was set up politically and economically where you really couldn't build viable factories
[38:14.320 --> 38:18.840]  and startup industries and many other systems in this country we were being deindustrialized
[38:18.840 --> 38:22.800]  we were told you're going to be a service economy in the 80s and 90s that's contracting
[38:22.800 --> 38:29.680]  as everybody knows and it was made to order for big monopolies like Amazon, Apple, Google
[38:29.680 --> 38:36.120]  and others to come in and just totally consolidate control with their sweatshop style labor practices
[38:36.120 --> 38:41.880]  because again they're allied with authoritarian states like China, Pakistan and others you
[38:41.880 --> 38:48.560]  help oppress their own people that tells you who they are and that's coming up that's coming
[38:48.560 --> 38:52.800]  up later in the next hour I'm going to get into a whole section on that is so vitally
[38:52.800 --> 38:58.560]  important this other goodness too I want to get to but the fact that the president's saying
[38:58.560 --> 39:05.200]  hey we're going to remove these unfair taxes these trade barriers it's it's a tariff when
[39:05.200 --> 39:16.120]  the US has a 38.9% and China has a 15 that's a tariff on money on being located there and
[39:16.120 --> 39:27.960]  that giant tariff of 20 plus points is going bye bye next year bye bye and imagine it's
[39:27.960 --> 39:32.400]  always customary for a president to wait until the new year to sign the full bill sometimes
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.720]  they'll ceremonially show the bill but they'll generally not sign it but the media had to
[39:36.720 --> 39:41.080]  spend that oh you didn't really get that victory to just affect your mind even if you know
[39:41.080 --> 39:45.880]  it's a lie to kind of hit the dopamine reception your brain and tell you no you didn't have
[39:45.880 --> 39:50.880]  a victory it was all a fraud he wasn't real because then you've got to carry out the
[39:50.880 --> 39:55.280]  thought process and find out that they're liars and the president's got a counter strike
[39:55.280 --> 40:05.280]  back and then they whine and complain and go how dare you say that blah blah blah and
[40:05.280 --> 40:11.000]  I mean every time he attacks mainstream media when they're lying about him or us or anybody
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.920]  they get upset and say it's vicious it's mean you're not supposed to do that and they do
[40:14.920 --> 40:22.800]  it over and over and over and over again they're at war with us their position is the opposite
[40:22.800 --> 40:27.840]  of whatever we do that's how they attack the democrats are caught colluding with the FBI
[40:27.840 --> 40:32.400]  to try to make up a dossier they flip it around and claim that congress is colluding with
[40:32.400 --> 40:38.080]  the president and then making all of it up when it's all admitted that's how they lie
[40:38.080 --> 40:43.440]  it's how they're off escape it makes my head quite frankly spend sometimes but let's finish
[40:43.440 --> 40:49.080]  up with the president bigger impact faster than I thought the corporate tax rate as you
[40:49.080 --> 40:55.080]  know will be lowered from 35 to 21 percent that means that more products will be made
[40:55.080 --> 40:59.280]  in the USA a lot of things are going to be happening in the USA we're going to bring
[40:59.280 --> 41:03.840]  back our companies that they've already started coming back I think they had certain confidence
[41:03.840 --> 41:08.600]  in me they figured we were going to get this done but they have already started something
[41:08.600 --> 41:13.640]  very important to me the family farmers and small business owners who lost their business
[41:13.640 --> 41:20.320]  because of the estate tax most of them won't have any estate tax to pay it will be a great
[41:20.320 --> 41:24.640]  thing for their families you can leave your farm to your family you can leave your business
[41:24.640 --> 41:29.360]  your small business to your family not even so small because the numbers are pretty big
[41:29.360 --> 41:34.280]  here so they'll be exempt from having to pay a state tax which will be tremendous they'll
[41:34.280 --> 41:39.160]  keep their farms and their businesses and the family businesses will be able to deduct
[41:39.160 --> 41:44.560]  100% of the cost of their capital investments in the year the investment is made that's
[41:44.560 --> 41:49.560]  called expensing and to do one year expensing I think is going to be one of the biggest
[41:49.560 --> 41:54.560]  things in the bill frankly I think people are going to go out and absolutely go wild
[41:54.560 --> 41:59.960]  over expensing Bob Kraft mentioned that last night in his telephone call the fact that
[41:59.960 --> 42:06.480]  they can expense to one year expensing is a fantastic asset historic small business tax
[42:06.480 --> 42:11.800]  cuts and pass-throughs now are made really really good for the business owner you know
[42:11.800 --> 42:16.680]  they're hiring people I see it on television I'm reading about it all we're gonna come
[42:16.680 --> 42:23.800]  back my friends now to go to work he goes on for a long time but this is such a gift
[42:23.800 --> 42:28.800]  back to the American people their own money and is the boot on our neck being partially
[42:28.800 --> 42:33.960]  removed and everybody had confidence in Trump that's why the economy stabilized despite
[42:33.960 --> 42:37.800]  the fact the globalists were trying to kill it admittedly were and now that the delivery
[42:37.800 --> 42:43.240]  has happened I think we're gonna be at 10% growth rates in a year and a half and we
[42:43.240 --> 42:49.960]  can just maintain this it's gonna absolutely destroy globalism we are witnessing a major
[42:49.960 --> 42:57.240]  turn of events a reversal of the tables right now at the end of 2017 why is the fungus why

[47:29.720 --> 47:35.400]  stock markets up new jobs are exploding small businesses are showing record
[47:36.120 --> 47:44.200]  expansions and new startups the information is simply amazing the facts are in trump is doing
[47:44.200 --> 47:49.560]  what he said he would do even seeing it and others have admitted that he's the promise keeper
[47:49.560 --> 47:55.720]  but i didn't notice yesterday the big headlines were will trump really sign the bill or was it
[47:55.720 --> 48:01.640]  all a big lie what how would he fight so hard to get it passed and then not sign it after the
[48:01.640 --> 48:07.880]  new year like you customarily do so trump said fine you don't want to have a big ceremony then
[48:08.520 --> 48:15.800]  you want to imply we're lying we'll sign it today and he came in and he signed it he talked about
[48:15.800 --> 48:21.720]  other liars now that said i talk a lot about this because they don't want us to and they're really
[48:21.720 --> 48:30.280]  upset about it mainstream media in their own publications as you know as a listener and
[48:30.280 --> 48:35.160]  viewer of the show or somebody that does your own research mainstream media calls for the death of
[48:35.160 --> 48:41.400]  trump the death of his family the death of his supporters for a coup for him to be killed uh phil
[48:41.400 --> 48:45.960]  mud former deputy director of the cia went to the fbi under mulars the deputy director there
[48:46.600 --> 48:53.880]  says that the government's going to kill trump uh police got shot ran paul got attacked uh republican
[48:54.440 --> 48:59.320]  mayors and city council members get shot in the head uh you see trump supporters getting beat up
[48:59.320 --> 49:03.240]  everywhere or people that are white getting beat up just and people saying well you're with trump
[49:04.520 --> 49:09.720]  we've seen the riots the cop killing we've seen all of it and the resist movement and we're going
[49:09.720 --> 49:15.240]  to drive trump from office full page ads the new york times and new york times writers saying somebody
[49:15.240 --> 49:22.680]  killed trump and newsweek it's time to riot and it's time to kill on and on and on and then when
[49:22.680 --> 49:28.680]  we talk about it they go jones is crazy there's no plan and then it comes out to the president has
[49:28.680 --> 49:33.480]  his own private military security that's been there since he was president elect and that they
[49:33.480 --> 49:40.040]  actually do fear rogue cia and fbi groups from the stay behind clinton network trying to kill him
[49:42.280 --> 49:47.400]  so that's the game they play but then as they gear up now because they're russia things falling
[49:47.400 --> 49:52.120]  apart their sexgate stuff's falling apart all of it's falling apart as trump delivers and as we
[49:52.120 --> 49:56.280]  the american people deliver supporting trump supporting ourselves as we begin to turn the corner
[49:57.160 --> 50:03.000]  we enter the maximum danger zone now there's the headline seen an analyst on trump the government's
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.920]  going to kill this guy so he's the former head of counterterrorism of the cia that's the part that
[50:08.920 --> 50:13.160]  has the teeth that's the part that tortures people and all of it he's been in lawsuits over it so
[50:13.160 --> 50:17.960]  i mean he's a killer or a guy that commands killers and he's there saying we're going to kill him the
[50:17.960 --> 50:23.400]  government's going to kill him i pointed out the media goes all you're crazy they had the aspen
[50:23.400 --> 50:29.640]  institute with wolf blitzer brennan and clapper former head of the cia former head of national
[50:29.640 --> 50:36.120]  intelligence and they go he'll be gone by the end of the year and they and blitzer goes impeachment
[50:36.120 --> 50:42.680]  and they go no extra judicially that means outside of law extra judicial means throw a bag over your
[50:42.680 --> 50:48.280]  head throw you in a van and take you to a place to throw you in a vat of acid or put cement shoes
[50:48.280 --> 50:52.920]  on you what it means is we're going to kill him and then congressmen were briefed on this by the
[50:52.920 --> 50:58.360]  democrats that said you better get in line when trump disappears all you republicans speak out
[50:58.360 --> 51:04.280]  when he goes down you're next and republicans have gone public that the democrats have been very
[51:04.280 --> 51:09.640]  threatening in private not just in public so they've been bravadoing around like the big
[51:09.640 --> 51:17.480]  rooster in the in in the barnyard they've been walking around kicking and strutting and getting
[51:17.480 --> 51:23.240]  everybody's face to act powerful so that their own minions hold on inside their bureaucratic
[51:23.240 --> 51:28.440]  stay behind networks and the media runs articles about how great it is and how they're not following

[52:31.800 --> 52:35.720]  if you dare criticize mehler you're making yourself an active accomplice as a quote
[52:35.720 --> 52:40.840]  and deliberate assault on our democracy that's right if you defend yourself from a kangaroo
[52:40.840 --> 52:45.240]  rogue group put in by the clinton's that's been proven to be a fraud if you even speak back at them

[54:49.640 --> 54:57.720]  want to reconsider your rhetoric so this is a literally a down with the usa crown meanwhile
[54:57.720 --> 55:01.880]  myself and roger stungo the shooting range we've tongue-in-cheek joke around you know that they're
[55:01.880 --> 55:05.160]  all calling for martial law and war and you know they're going to come after us we're going to
[55:05.160 --> 55:08.600]  defend ourselves but you know we hope they'll defeat them it doesn't go to that point but we
[55:08.600 --> 55:14.680]  clearly prefaced it five or six times that we don't believe in offensive operations we believe
[55:14.680 --> 55:18.920]  in defensive and so roger admits he doesn't go shooting often so they point out that he did
[55:18.920 --> 55:23.800]  them perfect etiquette and things like that we said that in the video it was an hour and a half
[55:23.800 --> 55:31.240]  live feed but they didn't imply that we are calling for violence and that we are calling for all of
[55:31.240 --> 55:37.320]  this when we're saying you're calling for it we're here to defend ourselves alex jones and
[55:37.320 --> 55:41.400]  roger stone visited a gun range prepared for civil war if trevus removed from office and now
[55:41.400 --> 55:45.160]  that they've written about it now hundreds of publications will write about it which is good
[55:45.160 --> 55:53.400]  i'm trolling them i'm betting on the people seeing through your propaganda all right coming up we're
[55:53.400 --> 55:58.040]  going to look at the shakeup at google and what's really behind that is eric schmidt is out we're
[55:58.040 --> 56:04.360]  going to look at the globalist operations we're going to also look at a facebook team helping
[56:04.360 --> 56:11.080]  regimes round up and imprison and kill people and how that ties into what's happening here inside of
[56:11.080 --> 56:16.360]  the united states we'll look at whore hey ramos saying he's now having the worst time of his life

[56:22.440 --> 56:27.880]  dancy polosi has new statistics come out showing a very high crime rate because statistically some
[56:27.880 --> 56:31.640]  of the group coming over are criminal and they do it because their identity is not known it was like

[58:31.000 --> 58:35.640]  got to remove him see that's what they're doing but they turn it around so when they engage in it
[58:35.640 --> 58:39.880]  they claim they're stopping a dictator when there's no evidence of that what do you think they're
[58:39.880 --> 58:44.440]  going to pull what do you think they've got up their sleeve what do they got in their back pocket

[59:10.440 --> 59:15.560]  power back to our nation it really is a big deal and we got so many other big stories we're going
[59:15.560 --> 59:22.120]  to cover in the next segment first i want to play this piece here dims lead delusional uprising over
[59:22.120 --> 59:29.000]  possible Mueller firing just voices of blind hypocrisy want americans to know that we should
[59:29.000 --> 59:34.360]  ignore all of the overwhelming evidence of a fabricated witch hunt against president trump
[59:34.360 --> 59:40.120]  instead join them in their flabbergasted disgust that anyone would even consider
[59:40.120 --> 59:47.080]  ending special counsel robert moeller's investigation of russia whitehouse collusion fiction
[59:47.080 --> 59:54.040]  mr president i rise today concerned about the threats to the special counsel's critical
[59:54.040 --> 1:00:02.040]  investigation of russian interference in the 2016 election over the last several weeks a growing
[1:00:02.040 --> 1:00:09.880]  chorus of irresponsible and reckless voices have called for president trump to shut down
[1:00:09.880 --> 1:00:18.120]  special counsel moeller's investigation at first these calls came from the fringes of our political
[1:00:18.120 --> 1:00:25.480]  discourse those who would refuse to put our country in our security before base political
[1:00:25.480 --> 1:00:32.120]  instincts yeah none of this is true earlier this year many of my colleagues on the sides of the aisle
[1:00:32.680 --> 1:00:37.880]  were right to push back we don't want to go anywhere now he's totally discredited and urge
[1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:43.240]  that the special counsel be allowed to do his job without interference yeah that means letting
[1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:49.320]  violate the law let him do whatever he wants we don't talk back to him he's god seemed to be growing
[1:00:49.320 --> 1:00:53.320]  in stride and see and involve what's growing as he's discredited he's been caught right handed
[1:00:54.040 --> 1:01:00.840]  one major news organization suggested that special counsel moeller could be involved in a coup against
[1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:08.280]  the president oh but one senior advisor at the white house has now outrageously alleged that the
[1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:13.080]  fix was in against donald trump from the beginning you know said coo first i said through a judiciary
[1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:19.400]  committee uh hearing that i thought was disgraceful with i'm under you on the other side of the aisle
[1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:25.320]  trying to smear not only fbi director chris for a ray but also i mean we can beat these guys these
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:29.880]  are winter moeller trying to play these are good people they're not gonna stop our prosperity
[1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:35.160]  you're not running our lives anymore you're not getting our guns filled march was large wait to
[1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:40.360]  you see what happens if the president actually tries to take these unconstitutional and what
[1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:46.680]  would really amount to criminal actions because he would be obstructing justice yeah uh but ever since
[1:01:46.680 --> 1:01:53.240]  he whipped up chance of a locker up in the 2016 campaign where that come from trump has displayed
[1:01:53.240 --> 1:02:00.840]  complete ignorance of the difference between a constitutional democracy and a banana republic
[1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:06.200]  a complete ignorance yeah they want to kill trump locking him up for no reason we just say
[1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:14.120]  hillary for president locker up and then we're the bad guys for us they inhabit a world of law

[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:18.440]  on trump's first year does he hit the ground running as president elect so i'd say it's
[1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:23.320]  about a year now even though january 20th when he got in officially november you know eight is when
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:28.920]  he got uh became president elect but he hit the ground running so i'd say right about now
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:34.520]  trump has been president for a year so he did hit the ground running you know he understood
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:40.680]  times of the essence he couldn't let the economy stall out first thing he did for even got his
[1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:46.680]  government organized was make thousands of phone calls telling corporations he was gonna cut taxes
[1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:50.680]  and please invest in america where the whole thing's gonna go belly up then he called and
[1:04:50.680 --> 1:04:56.440]  thanked people politically for what they'd done myself and others thousands thousands he's a
[1:04:56.440 --> 1:05:03.400]  tightness workhorse and then he called world leaders and people and and and started talking to them
[1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:09.080]  and uh doing diplomatic stuff and that's all on record what the president did first stabilize
[1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:14.760]  the economy emergency emergency emergency then thank the people that helped then start dealing with
[1:05:14.760 --> 1:05:21.400]  the rest of the world at first stabilize the ship america first america first america first america
[1:05:21.400 --> 1:05:34.200]  first and now a year later trump's been in a year now and this is a fair time to average all the
[1:05:34.200 --> 1:05:41.560]  stuff he did as president elect with when he officially became president he's been a president
[1:05:41.560 --> 1:05:48.440]  in a year and how has he done what do you think about the situation what are the pluses what are
[1:05:48.440 --> 1:05:55.480]  the minuses but just remember he's not god he can't get it all done i'm surprised how much
[1:05:55.480 --> 1:06:01.160]  he's gotten done it's been miraculous and they said he'd never get the tax cuts through on and on
[1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:07.400]  and on and they played all the race games you know there's new statistics out and it's not that his
[1:06:07.400 --> 1:06:13.000]  spanish that make up something like 70 percent of of uh immigrants come to the country are inherently
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:19.400]  criminal it's that there is a contingent already fleeing justice like americans flee to mexico
[1:06:19.400 --> 1:06:25.320]  and vice versa that don't have real names have fake ids that the mexican consulate will give them
[1:06:25.320 --> 1:06:29.000]  all these corrupt state governments and local governments will give them ids and they are
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:33.640]  just above the law and they mainly feed if you look at the statistics on other hispanics
[1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:41.080]  so i'm going to go some new statistics in a moment with tucker carlson breaking that down but
[1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:48.040]  whore hey ramones i mean i can't go to mexico and then go have a baby for free and have it taken
[1:06:48.040 --> 1:06:54.200]  care of they'd laugh at me i can't go to mexico just do whatever i want uh especially if i'm not
[1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:59.400]  working mexico gets illegal aliens from latin america and gives them six months to a year hard
[1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:04.680]  labor and tortures them that's the one in guardian and i'm not defending that the point is acting
[1:07:04.680 --> 1:07:10.680]  like america is the worst thing on earth is not true and then the democrats try to turn hispanics
[1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:17.160]  particularly into a new racial group and make it race-based politics and that's failing and that's
[1:07:17.160 --> 1:07:23.560]  good news for everybody so whore hey ramones says he's now having the worst time of his life in the
[1:07:23.560 --> 1:07:31.320]  us with donald trump there i have never been treated so badly i've never been insulted so much
[1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:38.440]  we've never been attacked so much they have never tried to run us out as much as now ramones vented
[1:07:38.440 --> 1:07:44.440]  in an interview with the spanish radio network ramones who proclaimed himself is not the enemy
[1:07:44.440 --> 1:07:48.760]  but an opponent of trump in the interview complained about the massive blowback he's
[1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:53.480]  received since deciding to use his media platform to openly oppose the choice
[1:07:55.400 --> 1:08:00.440]  over 62 million americans who voted last year's election then he complains about social networks
[1:08:00.440 --> 1:08:05.240]  the social networks are ten to one against libertarians nationalists and conservatives
[1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:09.800]  but we know most of them are bots we know it's fake so we don't care if we get ridiculed we keep
[1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:15.160]  hammering back but everybody knows the democrats the globalists the liberals are way more threatening
[1:08:15.160 --> 1:08:21.480]  way more hateful constantly calling for violence and then when kate stanley gets shot in the back
[1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:28.040]  and the virtue signaling mainly white jury lets the guy who'd been deported what five times
[1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:34.600]  and committed all these crimes lets him go not even manslaughter not even accidental
[1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:43.960]  because they couldn't signal that it was wrong to shoot her in the back what about kate well
[1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:48.840]  signs were put up at the university there in san francisco and folks pulled them down
[1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:54.760]  and said this is racist all it said was she had dreams too like she's a human too she has
[1:08:54.760 --> 1:09:00.440]  rights too but then nancy polosi virtue signals and says illegal migrants embody the best of our
[1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:06.280]  nation not migrants not not not people coming here to work not people coming here to be americans
[1:09:06.280 --> 1:09:13.240]  but migrants which means illegals illegal migrants quote embody the best of our nation says the
[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:18.760]  leader of the democrats and the house representatives nancy polosi the flattery of illegals came
[1:09:18.760 --> 1:09:24.600]  december 21st as polosi urged the house committee on rules to include an amnesty for 3.25 million
[1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:29.240]  dreamer illegals in two-week budget resolution problem is most of those folks are 40 years old
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:33.320]  with fake names they're not really dreamers it's kind of like the islamicist where you got 30
[1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:39.800]  year old and 25 year old men in dutch swish i mean dutch swedish and german schools because they
[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:48.440]  say they're 16 and then she goes on to say they embody the best of our nation's patriotism hard work
[1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:52.840]  persevering polosi said the dreamers she added that congress shouldn't leave them to celebrate the
[1:09:52.840 --> 1:10:01.080]  holidays and fear oh really what about kate stanley meanwhile so it was terrorism attacker who
[1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:07.720]  rammed his car into victims upset at mistreatment of muslims and of course you've had hundreds of
[1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:12.200]  these attacks the last few years in russia europe here all over and most of the time they'll never
[1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:17.800]  even say it's islamicist in fact in sweden and in other areas they won't release the name they've
[1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:23.560]  passed laws and regulations saying it's racist if the guy's name is habip or hamamad or octman or
[1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:30.040]  whatever it's just incredible so that story is up on news wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[1:10:30.040 --> 1:10:35.320]  from paul joseph watson please hear it out to everybody meanwhile morris he comes out more
[1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:39.880]  with the classical liberal and says fake news media get angry if you say something that reflects
[1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:45.080]  the will of europe yeah they're saying it's racist that want to have vetted people coming into the
[1:10:45.080 --> 1:10:51.800]  country when all the globalists are doing is openly erasing people's cultures now let's go to the
[1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:58.120]  tucker carlson piece where they break down these statistics uh never before seen statistics proving
[1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:03.880]  illegal aliens commit massively this proportionate amount of crime see you think we've got brand new
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:09.400]  numbers striking numbers that have never been seen before and they may reshape how you think about
[1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:14.760]  illegal immigration so you've heard the same line a million times it's repeated like a mantra by the
[1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:20.280]  left during every debate on the subject all immigrants are hardworking and law-abiding they
[1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:25.320]  do jobs you wouldn't consider doing and they do them cheerfully they sacrifice for their families
[1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:30.920]  in ways you probably don't in fact and this is always the last point it's always delivered with the
[1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:36.840]  confidence satisfaction of someone shutting down a debate with superior data undocumented immigrants
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:42.440]  actually commit fewer crimes on average than native-born americans not only are immigrants
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:47.880]  more virtuous than you are but they're safer to be around in other words stop complaining they're
[1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:56.120]  your superiors but wait are we sure that that is true are people who are in this country precisely
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:01.960]  because they were willing to break our immigration laws really less likely to break other kinds of
[1:12:01.960 --> 1:12:10.040]  laws it doesn't make a lot of sense yet until today strangely enough no one could say for sure
[1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:16.680]  whether it was true because reliable statistics didn't seem to exist our government tracks pretty
[1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:22.040]  much every trend and every phenomenon you can think of from how many pounds of pistachio nuts are
[1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:26.600]  recalled every year to how many fifth graders are injured on swing sets kind of people die in bathtubs
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:31.560]  this is a nation of record keepers were overseen by an army of spreadsheet-wielding bureaucrats
[1:12:31.560 --> 1:12:37.640]  numbers control our lives except on this subject somehow the government went for years without
[1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:42.360]  honestly trying to track the volume of crime committed by illegal immigrants in this country
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:47.720]  maybe they were too incompetent to do it more likely they didn't want you to know the answer
[1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:51.800]  or to think about it even in any case we now for the first time have the actual numbers in here
[1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:57.880]  they are according to statistics from the u.s sentencing commission non-citizens are actually
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:04.280]  far more likely to commit serious crimes than americans are non-citizens account for 22 percent
[1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:09.480]  more than a fifth of all federal murder convictions you know what let's stop right here let's let's
[1:13:09.480 --> 1:13:13.560]  back this up about 30 seconds i'm going to come back and break this down and the reason i knew this
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:20.280]  was the statistics were already there hispanic immigrants on average have a low crime rate but
[1:13:20.280 --> 1:13:26.680]  there is a minority subgroup of hardened criminals that commit hugely disproportionate amounts of
[1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:31.480]  crime because they can't be tracked that's why you have this anomaly we'll explain it on the other
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:39.160]  side both both sides of this are actually true stay with us

[1:18:07.320 --> 1:18:10.360]  thank you ladies and gentlemen for joining us i'm your host alex jones coming out the
[1:18:10.360 --> 1:18:16.040]  next segment your phone calls so so continuing here i'm a newshound i've been a newshound for 25
[1:18:16.040 --> 1:18:20.120]  years i've been on here 22 years and so i actually look at the statistics and i talked to law enforcement
[1:18:20.120 --> 1:18:26.200]  and i and i check into it and so that's why i've understood that statistically immigrants to this
[1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:31.880]  country from all over the world come here because they want to work they want to be successful now
[1:18:31.880 --> 1:18:35.400]  more and more though you have people coming here to have anchor babies so that's now not people from
[1:18:35.400 --> 1:18:40.600]  mexico that used to be the biggest group it's now chinese women thousands and thousands a week
[1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:46.360]  come here middle class chinese women to have their baby for free then the baby becomes a u.s citizen
[1:18:46.360 --> 1:18:49.240]  and now they have a toehold here in the u.s we shouldn't have to pay for that
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:57.560]  so again we know the statistics piece by piece and on average the cliche that hispanic workers
[1:18:58.360 --> 1:19:03.960]  out of mexico wherever coming off farms down there like farm boys used to you know come off farms
[1:19:03.960 --> 1:19:08.440]  you know here in the 50s and 60s they have just been third world they haven't been industrialized yet
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:12.440]  so they're behind so just like my grandfathers were good hardworking guys that came off the farm
[1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:17.240]  and you know nowadays you know people aren't as tough or strong or hardworking as their
[1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:23.080]  grandfathers we've gotten decadent in america so the cliche is true farm boys coming off a farm in
[1:19:23.080 --> 1:19:29.080]  mexico are going to get the job done and usually aren't criminals and you know they're they're more
[1:19:29.080 --> 1:19:34.200]  country boy than most folk guys in texas that's where cowboy hats and and boots came from spain
[1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:41.080]  and were then developed in mexico and chili but there is a narco terrorist culture and a gang
[1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:48.040]  culture and a drug culture in latin america that is a minority but particularly vicious
[1:19:49.160 --> 1:19:55.240]  that creates a disproportionate amount of crime and that's true just like black on black crime is
[1:19:55.240 --> 1:20:01.880]  is stratospheric these are demographic things that go on and are facts so yes the average
[1:20:01.880 --> 1:20:08.280]  Hispanic person isn't some foaming at the mouth criminal but there are criminal gangs coming in
[1:20:08.280 --> 1:20:13.720]  and criminal groups and mentally ill people and serial killers like the railway killer that killed
[1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:19.000]  they think 40 something people and he had all these different names and stuff it's dangerous
[1:20:19.560 --> 1:20:24.120]  and it's crazy i mean one of these crazy guys shoots a woman in the back the liberal jury won't
[1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:31.400]  even do anything about it and that's the issue that's what's wrong with this is that there's this
[1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:35.960]  thing where they're making people above the law and the argument is well people from latin america
[1:20:35.960 --> 1:20:39.080]  already won't call the police they're already scared of the system and they're scared of
[1:20:39.080 --> 1:20:42.520]  repercussions and that's true because in those countries if you do report on the criminal gangs
[1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:48.760]  they'll kill you and that's where the real statistics are it's much higher than even these
[1:20:48.760 --> 1:20:54.200]  statistics show because hispanics on average report crime or the lowest levels out there you can
[1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:58.280]  look it up and so a lot of people just get disappeared and by the way who mainly gets
[1:20:58.280 --> 1:21:05.560]  disappeared who the gangs usually target mainly their own group the worst thing for hispanics
[1:21:05.560 --> 1:21:11.000]  in america are these undocumented criminal gangs and they'll tell you that but you go see a robert
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:16.280]  rodriguez movie it's redneck's cowboy hat shooting pregnant mexicans in the stomach let me tell you
[1:21:16.280 --> 1:21:21.080]  who's raping and killing mexicans it's the drug cartels and they've dug up hundreds of thousands
[1:21:21.080 --> 1:21:25.880]  over a hundred thousand people and almost all of them got killed by those satanic drug gangs
[1:21:27.480 --> 1:21:33.000]  that's the facts robert rodriguez you are a mexican supremacist races but you're not actually
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:37.160]  helping your people you're not a real supremacist you're not telling don't take Gardasil or whatever
[1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:41.320]  you're sitting there telling them the gringo is killing them when the average gringo is a
[1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:49.480]  self-loathing guilty wamp and i'm sick of it your problem is not your local gringo your problem is
[1:21:49.480 --> 1:21:54.440]  the globalist and your problem is carlo slim and your problem is the big mega combines that are
[1:21:54.440 --> 1:21:59.400]  controlling the society and attacking our families and everybody and your enemy is the
[1:21:59.400 --> 1:22:04.280]  abortuaries that are working as hard as they can to abort your kids am i the leftist trying to get
[1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:08.920]  the hispanic kids aborted hell no am i trying to get the black kids aborted no even though
[1:22:08.920 --> 1:22:13.160]  they're getting turned into weapons against me by the brainwashing machine i'm chivalrous
[1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:18.200]  and i will not go to that level but the real enemy is the globalist that's all of our enemy
[1:22:18.200 --> 1:22:20.920]  and trump is bringing back prosperity for everybody if we want it
[1:22:23.400 --> 1:22:31.880]  now let's go ahead and play the rest uh here with tucker carlson and i'm gonna go to break
[1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:35.720]  and i'm gonna come back go to your calls but i've got to get to some really sickening niche
[1:22:35.720 --> 1:22:40.520]  that just went live on info wars dot com with kit daniels it is so incredible but i'm not going to
[1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:44.440]  tell you about it to the next segment uh let's let's finish up tucker carlson and the statistics
[1:22:44.440 --> 1:22:50.200]  and it's worse than this it's way worse than this i mean my god the the unmarked graves are digging
[1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:56.840]  up 90 of the time there is a hispanic woman her kids in the grave and it's because somebody back
[1:22:56.840 --> 1:23:02.360]  home didn't pay off and it's sick and they're treated like animals by the by the criminal class
[1:23:02.360 --> 1:23:06.520]  in mexico and i'm sick of it that's why everybody should be armed in mexico they should have their
[1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:10.600]  own second amendment they should have their own reformation and turn this around let's go ahead
[1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:15.320]  and go to this clip we now for the first time have the actual numbers and here they are according
[1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:21.000]  to statistics from the u.s sentencing commission non-citizens are actually far more likely to
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:27.720]  commit serious crimes than americans are non-citizens account for 22 percent more than a fifth of all
[1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:33.960]  federal murder convictions 18 percent of fraud convictions 33 percent of money laundering convictions
[1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:39.720]  29 percent of drug trafficking convictions and 72 percent of convictions for drug possession
[1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:46.680]  meanwhile the non-citizen percentage of the american population about seven percent so that
[1:23:46.680 --> 1:23:53.640]  is a massively disproportionate amount of crime not even close no immigrants are not more law abiding
[1:23:53.640 --> 1:23:59.480]  and less dangerous than americans that's totally untrue indeed it's the opposite of the truth
[1:23:59.480 --> 1:24:04.760]  non-citizens are more likely to be arrested convicted and imprisoned for serious crimes
[1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:11.320]  that people who were born here much more likely so why didn't we know this until now why have so
[1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:17.480]  many people been lying to us about this for so long that's a question we plan to ask a whole
[1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:22.520]  bunch of people all right very powerful information extremely powerful we're going to break come back
[1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:28.360]  let's get daniel's news that daria brought to my attention and then i'm going to go to your phone

[1:33:36.280 --> 1:33:43.640]  and the social engineers don't want to have a real debate about this so we didn't see things put out

[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:09.160]  gel genitals are designed for ages 8 to 13 according to their product page this is the
[1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:15.480]  smallest stand-to-pea device that we have seen it states designed especially for younger folks 8
[1:37:15.480 --> 1:37:21.960]  to 13 years old these are discrete enough that they can be worn all day under the clothes if your
[1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:27.800]  child was assigned female at birth that wants to stand up while urinating this just might work great
[1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:33.400]  for them and then we've got the images of it i mean this is the bizarre perversion the weirdness
[1:37:33.400 --> 1:37:38.120]  the mass mental illness just like all over the uk and the us they're now paying to have their eyes
[1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:43.320]  removed or drain oh poured in their eyes and the taxpayers will pay for you to be blind because
[1:37:43.320 --> 1:37:49.240]  you identify as a blind person that's mental illness people are not identifying as dogs
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:55.880]  the store underscores how young children are increasingly being pressured to reconsider
[1:37:55.880 --> 1:38:01.320]  their gender identity which critics have blasted as a form of child abuse and then that's Camille
[1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:05.720]  Paglia talking about it but there's another factor at play estrogen mimicry's and household
[1:38:05.720 --> 1:38:11.720]  goods and grocery stores and groceries especially between all a in plastics and atrazine as well as
[1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:18.360]  foods highly processed with soy ingredients both of which are said to contribute to the low testosterone
[1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:26.040]  soy boy pandemic between all a bpa a particular is known as a gender-bending chemical because of
[1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:30.680]  its link to male impotence and low sperm counts yeah me and my son were driving to work this morning
[1:38:30.680 --> 1:38:37.640]  because he's off because of christmas and i saw a little those little mini cars and the the the
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:43.800]  british one i forget the name and it had a pink license plate and said resist and i said wait it's
[1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:49.560]  going to be a soy boy we drove by the guy looked like a concentration camp victim and and every time
[1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:54.440]  you see it i mean they are just totally leaderless they have no idea they're totally confused they
[1:38:54.440 --> 1:39:00.120]  just glom onto media glom onto the bots that tell them have a pink license plate you know drive the
[1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:06.200]  little mini car uh and again if one person was doing it or 10 people or a thousand it's a cult
[1:39:07.320 --> 1:39:12.520]  estrogen mimicry's increase estrogen's activity in young men leading to social anxiety and bitch
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:17.400]  tits that's romantically called so it's really not surprising there's a generation of celibate
[1:39:17.400 --> 1:39:23.080]  hipsters running around in skinny jeans who are scared to death of the first of fist fights and
[1:39:23.080 --> 1:39:27.400]  women yeah that's it and it's been done so here's the website trans kids and this is what's being
[1:39:27.400 --> 1:39:32.360]  pushed in the schools it's what's being pushed with the sexualization with with drag queens
[1:39:32.360 --> 1:39:37.560]  at the schools and and kids pole dancing and giving drag queens money i mean you wouldn't have a
[1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:43.240]  heterosexual a woman in there pole dancing and three-year-olds and five-year-olds handing them
[1:39:43.240 --> 1:39:51.320]  cash that that's for topless bars stop sexualizing children stop doing it it's child abuse just like
[1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:55.480]  camille paglia said and it's it's all about the sexualization of children it's an agenda of
[1:39:55.480 --> 1:39:59.400]  hollywood and the globalist and it's meant to break up our families and make us leaderless

[1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:18.280]  youtube facebook and others are they're going to take the video down and upload this
[1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:23.080]  or say it's age restricted because that's how they keep the public from learning what's going on
[1:45:23.080 --> 1:45:27.720]  with the children it's all an agenda they can go into three and four and five-year-olds in public
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:32.680]  schools and tell them you're a little girl if you're a boy you're a you're a boy of you're a
[1:45:32.680 --> 1:45:38.360]  little girl you're a girl you're a little boy and vice versa as chamele paglius says serious child
[1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:46.120]  abuse but then if we even try to show you what they publicly put on the website we'll have our
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:51.800]  website shut down so we have it blurred out here but notice the little transgender books
[1:45:51.800 --> 1:45:57.240]  they're giving the kids and the fake prosthetic genitals for little girls they show it in in the
[1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:05.640]  hand now again the hand on the the image of the prosthesis of the artificial genital
[1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:10.280]  and again that's what's on their actual site ladies and gentlemen and people will say hey
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:15.560]  it's okay to have adults tell little kids about this just don't show adults on youtube or other
[1:46:15.560 --> 1:46:22.120]  children good lord get it off the screen i can't look at it anymore and this is how little girls
[1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:27.320]  can urinate and the parents can go in and say it's your choice at age four whether you want to be a
[1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:32.120]  boy or girl you can't go into a child and say it's your choice if you want to take pcp or drink a
[1:46:32.120 --> 1:46:35.400]  bottle of jack daniels or if you want to take inoculations or if you want to date the next
[1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:42.680]  door neighbor you're not at the age of consent this is abuse cut and dry and google and facebook

[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:06.920]  globalist strike back new york time saying that you know the coups going on we're gonna talk about
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:12.600]  it all but zack in morocco hasn't given a secret info but he's been in army special operations
[1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:17.080]  and intelligence he's actually known he's been in the news we know who he is he's not ready to go
[1:49:17.080 --> 1:49:20.840]  public yet but he gets through on the line we should just call zack routinely once a week
[1:49:20.840 --> 1:49:25.560]  get updates not just making fighting on the line that's my fault should have thought of that uh but
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:30.600]  zack uh over there in morocco what do you make of the latest info and top marine general says
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:37.480]  there's a war coming that's in the hill newspaper uh yes alex it's uh great to be back on and i just
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:42.040]  had to uh connect some dots here everything you've laid out it's pretty accurate so far but uh just
[1:49:42.040 --> 1:49:47.720]  wanted to connect some dots about the deep state death hurdle that will commence on the eve of
[1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:52.600]  christmas into the new year because they are going to go for broke um with that being said we need
[1:49:52.600 --> 1:50:00.040]  to start out with some key information last time when uh myself and you were on we brought up the
[1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:05.000]  hrc huma abedin barak who's saying connection that set off some alarm bells and everybody knows
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:10.840]  what's gone there and gone on there with the researchers now um i'm going to drop some
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:15.880]  information that will make the snow and stuff look like snowflakes compared to the avalanche that
[1:50:15.880 --> 1:50:21.160]  i'm about to unleash because the stuff i'm privy to is very important and at this point um this
[1:50:21.160 --> 1:50:26.200]  is a duty to kind of relay it so i'm going to go ahead and do that here um you know when it comes
[1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:32.040]  to this fast and furious thing when it comes to this radical islamic thing let's look at one
[1:50:32.040 --> 1:50:37.800]  individual in particular which we'll bring it all down that individual's name is anwar awalaki
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:46.360]  anwar awalaki the american the new mexico born colorado state educated george washington
[1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:55.160]  university educated anwar awalaki the influencer of major nadal hassan at ford hood that anwar
[1:50:55.160 --> 1:51:03.000]  awalaki is a major point in this this islamic threat is fabricated you know you have the fbi
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  and you have the nsa days after the attack at ford hood coming out and saying wow he was talking
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:14.840]  with anwar awalaki but let me get this straight you have this information two to three days after
[1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:19.640]  this ford hood massacre there how would you have that information two to three days later well later
[1:51:19.640 --> 1:51:24.440]  came out that the cia knew he was talking to him for two years oh well not only talking to him they
[1:51:24.440 --> 1:51:30.600]  they've presented anwar awalaki as a yemenis cleric who is inciting violence with the united
[1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:37.960]  states no anwar awalaki was born in new mexico anwar awalaki was an intellectual anwar awalaki
[1:51:37.960 --> 1:51:44.440]  was educated at the university in colorado state and george washington george washington university
[1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:50.840]  this is critical okay this is very critical because this was all a setup and they went too
[1:51:50.840 --> 1:51:57.000]  far here and i witnessed it so this is all going on while fast and furious is going on
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:01.480]  where they're taking weapons from port blitz and el paso moving them across the border
[1:52:01.480 --> 1:52:08.280]  into the kingdom of morocco through the sahara in algae area eventually making their way to libya
[1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:13.960]  where they will defeat gaddafi's reign there and create isis so this is deep
[1:52:14.600 --> 1:52:18.920]  these are not that's what that's what tosh plumley the cia whistleblower had said here was
[1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:23.880]  was his info he broke down accurate for what you know uh yeah it was pretty accurate but i'm
[1:52:23.880 --> 1:52:29.480]  going to i mean i was witness to it i know exactly what happened there and it's not a secret people
[1:52:29.480 --> 1:52:35.080]  people blew the whistle in morocco in the dts command the dst commander in morocco
[1:52:35.080 --> 1:52:39.400]  so just to boil it down why was obama arming the muslim brotherhood and arming radical jihadist
[1:52:39.400 --> 1:52:45.480]  to destabilize moderate muslim states right so destabilizing moderate muslim states and also
[1:52:45.480 --> 1:52:51.080]  creating isis to wreak havoc as we see in the world today so this is not a blind eye this is
[1:52:51.080 --> 1:52:56.360]  blackoff this is the cia this was funded by the highest powers that be reigning in our country
[1:52:56.360 --> 1:53:02.120]  at the time so this is why this is so critical i mean you know we do have a radical islamic threat
[1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:06.440]  but we need to realize where the funding comes from and who's really involved and it's the left
[1:53:06.440 --> 1:53:11.720]  and it's the deep state without question absolutely that's what the evidence shows and it appears
[1:53:11.720 --> 1:53:15.880]  trump is trying to actually cut that off and in that and make deals actually try to stabilize the
[1:53:15.880 --> 1:53:20.200]  middle east again but that big master and others are double crossing still trying to go back to
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:24.680]  the old game right under trump's nose it's absolutely unbelievable and since the trump
[1:53:24.680 --> 1:53:30.440]  administration has you know been in office since some of the power positions have changed
[1:53:30.440 --> 1:53:35.960]  we've seen incredible changes reach around the world i'm just saying by firsthand information
[1:53:35.960 --> 1:53:40.440]  when this information actually comes out and i'm kind of hitting at some things without getting
[1:53:40.440 --> 1:53:46.520]  into anything very classified but um you know fast and furious is ran by our country fast and
[1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:51.160]  furious is what created ices there's just no way around it this just wasn't this is just wasn't
[1:53:51.160 --> 1:53:57.080]  solved this is with an m4's this was shorter filed weapons this was artillery this was everything
[1:53:57.080 --> 1:54:01.240]  this was a standing up of sure and that was that was obama and and and the e you and the global
[1:54:01.240 --> 1:54:05.720]  is from from all our research and our sources uh now you see the info coming out about arming
[1:54:05.720 --> 1:54:11.960]  hezbollah as well uh i mean why is that suddenly coming out in all places politico well that's
[1:54:11.960 --> 1:54:15.800]  coming out and also what's coming out is sort of this ufo leaking some of this other technology
[1:54:15.800 --> 1:54:20.680]  leaking because what's essentially coming out is some of some of our deepest i guess quote
[1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:24.200]  unquote secrets of what's going on because what we're going to see and you hinted to it earlier
[1:54:24.200 --> 1:54:28.840]  as we got on the phone there will be a strike on north korea i've been calling you and talking
[1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:32.360]  to you about this for six months the ending of strategic patience there will be an attack there
[1:54:32.360 --> 1:54:37.480]  and the real issue there is people think about the collateral damage and what will occur there
[1:54:37.480 --> 1:54:43.800]  but it will be sophisticated we want to unleash weapons that we do currently have that have been
[1:54:43.800 --> 1:54:47.800]  field tested but uh we'll actually be using conventional warfare for the first time these
[1:54:47.800 --> 1:54:53.560]  will be mp these would be strategic nuclear weapons this will be all of it and i did start to call up
[1:54:53.560 --> 1:54:59.240]  i think on the eve of christmas i'm dubbing it to deep state death hurdle they're red-handed
[1:54:59.240 --> 1:55:04.280]  the information that i just laid out is damning and this is nothing special it's going to come out
[1:55:04.840 --> 1:55:09.080]  it's going to come out before they said the nsa wasn't spying comes up they're spying
[1:55:09.720 --> 1:55:13.960]  before they said no we didn't armize this no you did armize this now the house of cards
[1:55:13.960 --> 1:55:18.840]  is following they are desperate and and is it not donald trump for real i mean that's why
[1:55:18.840 --> 1:55:23.560]  they're so scared oh it's for real this is history in the making this is as sensational as i can
[1:55:23.560 --> 1:55:27.560]  be stay right there let's come right back and finish up with zack then all your other calls
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:40.120]  stay with us third hour please spread the links folks
[1:55:45.800 --> 1:55:49.800]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:55:49.800 --> 1:55:58.360]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:06.520]  i'm getting some shocking information from dr. rome coursey with his connections in the white
[1:56:06.520 --> 1:56:11.880]  house of why schmidt has stepped down and i know it's because schmidt's been a globalist and
[1:56:11.880 --> 1:56:18.760]  an obama creature uh but course he says he's tied to just unbelievable information that's
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:24.360]  going to be filed very very soon info wars dot com but you know there's photos of smith
[1:56:24.360 --> 1:56:28.920]  boarding with women that are wearing hoods over their heads their faces covered um kind
[1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:33.240]  like michael jackson would do people and it's just they these people thought they were invincible
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:37.880]  they thought it would never come out uh they thought that they just could get away with anything
[1:56:37.880 --> 1:56:43.880]  and they are flipping out you know that's my next issue for usak they're in the new york time saying
[1:56:43.880 --> 1:56:48.760]  trump is planning a coup when he's already peacefully taken over and got the tax cuts doing
[1:56:48.760 --> 1:56:53.800]  things by the book they've got uh high-level obama advisors and press briefers saying that
[1:56:53.800 --> 1:56:58.840]  they want to kill the republican leadership uh i mean they're clearly telegraphing something big
[1:56:59.640 --> 1:57:03.720]  now we've got two trains traveling at full speed colliding australia multiple injuries
[1:57:03.720 --> 1:57:09.080]  we'll get to that but finishing up uh you know you say this death hurdle of of what you think
[1:57:09.080 --> 1:57:15.880]  they're going to launch uh in the next few weeks please give us your view okay so that's pretty
[1:57:15.880 --> 1:57:19.320]  interesting information that you just kind of predicated our talk with there because that's
[1:57:19.320 --> 1:57:22.520]  what i was going to get into the information that i got out of mountain view california
[1:57:23.240 --> 1:57:28.520]  the suburb outside of palo Alto the the google complex right across the freeway from nasa
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:32.280]  aims research where i've done a lot of work there and everyone well i'm not going to do that but
[1:57:32.280 --> 1:57:37.960]  uh yeah so we have the we have silicon valley literally being the unelected leaders of our
[1:57:37.960 --> 1:57:43.640]  country at least they thought that's the left in the deep state thought um the schmidt information
[1:57:43.640 --> 1:57:47.800]  will come out i'm interested to see what you guys are going to drop i have some certain points on that
[1:57:47.800 --> 1:57:53.960]  but um the writing's on the wall there it's going to happen when trump was elected elon musk told
[1:57:53.960 --> 1:57:59.080]  the line he's smart enough and realistic enough to take the side of humanity over ai and he kind
[1:57:59.080 --> 1:58:03.960]  of publicly came out notice he said look out for those that's talk about ai gods right before they
[1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:09.800]  launched it i mean exactly elon musk is there yeah there's there there's a lot more power coming
[1:58:09.800 --> 1:58:15.080]  out of silicon valley nowadays and there is the beltway in dc and now um trump is to kind of
[1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:19.000]  you know you know reversing that power and allowing people to innovate and do what they're
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  doing but this is deep and this is why that's right the heart of the the heart of globalism is
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:28.680]  the ai takeover the darpen the us built it we're taking it back absolutely so when you see some
[1:58:28.680 --> 1:58:34.680]  sort of inhumane or completely immoral acts coming out how can they smash planes into buildings on
[1:58:34.680 --> 1:58:40.920]  9 11 and how can they kill americans in vegas how can they kill us troops at boardhood well they're
[1:58:40.920 --> 1:58:45.480]  humans so who cares and this is deep and this is beyond comprehension for some individuals
[1:58:45.480 --> 1:58:49.320]  but we need to understand the clip and technology that's really running in the world today it's
[1:58:49.320 --> 1:58:55.400]  astounding and we'll know about it in 10 to 15 years but at the rate technology is the core
[1:58:55.400 --> 1:59:00.440]  the globalists are following basically mass global map ai directives of what they think
[1:59:00.440 --> 1:59:03.960]  will win they think they've already merged cold bloodedly with the technology they actually said
[1:59:03.960 --> 1:59:08.360]  that it's their power trip that's going to undo them and trump is noticing speeches are all about
[1:59:08.360 --> 1:59:13.400]  humans and people and workers this is just a desperate movement to not bring in the global
[1:59:13.400 --> 1:59:18.760]  exterminism is that what you're saying absolutely and schmidt was compromised i'll let you guys
[1:59:18.760 --> 1:59:22.840]  um kind of break that or whatever but i kind of think i know what you guys are going towards
[1:59:22.840 --> 1:59:32.120]  there but uh is it uh is it uh child sex trafficking i gotta stop i can't get into that but uh i
[1:59:32.120 --> 1:59:36.120]  have some very information that i'll be able to release out of palo Alto out of the silicon

[1:59:42.360 --> 1:59:46.040]  yeah you guys are on the trail i would say it's somewhere in that capacity well coursing just
[1:59:46.040 --> 1:59:51.880]  got that from the white house yeah things are happening quickly and it's happening real quick
[1:59:51.880 --> 1:59:57.720]  uh you know yesterday was the shortest day of the year seems like time is speeding up and

[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:48.840]  um yeah so just to kind of wrap up here um the schmidt stepping down let's not lose sight
[2:02:48.840 --> 2:02:53.400]  a lot of people aren't there geographically but in mountain view in palo Alto google complex
[2:02:53.400 --> 2:02:57.800]  directly across the freeway from nasa aims research the tones that connect and obviously the
[2:02:57.800 --> 2:03:03.080]  transfer of information to individuals working there it's no coincidence that you see individuals
[2:03:03.640 --> 2:03:08.280]  and uh releasing information which are you know really done by schmidt there of the pentagon
[2:03:08.280 --> 2:03:14.040]  ufo programs this sort of video that's been put out that's blurry but shows a a navy pilot
[2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:17.400]  they're looking at stuff there were some tactics to kind of see what we could do and what kind of
[2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:21.000]  power he had yeah we ought to show that clip because i mean we showed it a few days ago we
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:25.080]  should show it again the navy pilot following the ufo go ahead so a lot of a lot of this stuff is
[2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:30.760]  leaking it's kind of like no no there are these weird things with power things but um no he had
[2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:34.520]  to step down for a reason they played a couple hands in the weeks before this but i'll let you
[2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:39.640]  guys publish an article there because i i know what it is but uh yeah schmidt schmidt's compromised
[2:03:39.640 --> 2:03:46.040]  not only him a lot of people are compromised there um but just to wrap up um the deep state
[2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:54.040]  predominantly with individuals on the left there have been using since 98 really came to a precipice
[2:03:54.040 --> 2:04:00.840]  in 2001 radical islamist muscle to discuss as a humanity not even just in america but in the west
[2:04:00.840 --> 2:04:06.440]  is general to just completely you know have chaos come in and they were going to introduce this sort
[2:04:06.440 --> 2:04:11.400]  of ai god to say look at all the problems look at the world look at the state that we're in so
[2:04:11.400 --> 2:04:15.880]  you must go with us we have to do this so that's been combated so let's not look at it war against
[2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:22.120]  islamist let's not look at it as a war against drugs let's look at it as a war between humans
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:27.320]  and technology and we're human here and a lot of these people are compromised morally and even
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:32.040]  ethically so they've picked their sides but now they're being swept up by the trump administration
[2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:35.800]  but with all that being said we still have a lot of work to do in the new year there will be a
[2:04:35.800 --> 2:04:41.400]  strike on north korea this has been a long time in the making as trump just passed the tax cuts
[2:04:41.400 --> 2:04:46.200]  here this will kind of give them a little buffer with the american people here and a lot of people
[2:04:46.200 --> 2:04:50.360]  have been trying to solve this north korea problem in north korea yam and iran they're all kind of
[2:04:50.360 --> 2:04:55.720]  connected north korea problem in particular he's to be dealing with he's been speaking about it
[2:04:55.720 --> 2:04:59.960]  as well as pin and mattis for quite some months it doesn't matter what do you make now they're
[2:04:59.960 --> 2:05:04.280]  telegraphing in north korea they better make a deal right now with this top marine corps general
[2:05:04.280 --> 2:05:11.720]  coming out uh saying that the attack is going to happen i think there's no deal i can't get into
[2:05:11.720 --> 2:05:16.120]  certain things i don't think there i don't think there's a deal i think they get there's going to
[2:05:16.120 --> 2:05:23.400]  be a strike um we were willing to play with china china kind of backcross took the meeting with obama
[2:05:23.400 --> 2:05:27.480]  we saw them try to get trump out of office their china was kind of playing both sides because you
[2:05:27.480 --> 2:05:30.920]  know north korea is a proxy but it's really not a proxy of china i mean it is technically but it's
[2:05:30.920 --> 2:05:35.960]  a proxy of the deep state what's what percentage would you say the government as we know the voters
[2:05:35.960 --> 2:05:39.720]  put trump in hillary almost stole the election but we were able to beat it but there are a lot of
[2:05:39.720 --> 2:05:43.480]  people the patriots in the intelligence agencies and the corporations now piling along with the
[2:05:43.480 --> 2:05:48.600]  tax cuts with bonuses trying to boost the economy trying to get us out of this global meltdown they
[2:05:48.600 --> 2:05:53.080]  wanted to bring in and then bring in the ai as the savior after as the top tech giants have been
[2:05:53.080 --> 2:05:58.040]  saying was the plan so there's coup against the globalist and their ai takeover at least at this
[2:05:58.040 --> 2:06:05.960]  point because of everybody at an instinctual and spiritual level basically being warned i mean i
[2:06:05.960 --> 2:06:09.080]  don't want to get into the whole things behind the scenes but a lot of important people have been
[2:06:09.080 --> 2:06:15.080]  basically um been having events where they're seeing what's going to come and uh they're
[2:06:15.080 --> 2:06:20.360]  understanding it because this is so big and our species is so powerful that there's always major
[2:06:20.360 --> 2:06:23.800]  ripples that the globalist thought they could get through that wouldn't happen but since you're going
[2:06:23.800 --> 2:06:30.680]  that direction and getting into that uh our own ai our own brain has already been able to project
[2:06:30.680 --> 2:06:35.560]  forward what was about to happen and but i think people need to understand how dire the straits
[2:06:35.560 --> 2:06:39.560]  are right now to turn this all around and if we're dealing with an ai globalist program
[2:06:39.560 --> 2:06:43.240]  why not deal with it why go ahead and take out north korea because the globalists behind the
[2:06:43.240 --> 2:06:47.480]  scenes are manipulating north korea as a set piece towards something larger we've got to take it out
[2:06:47.480 --> 2:06:53.640]  beforehand uh uh the the research shows before china and russia already that's what scowleson keeps
[2:06:53.640 --> 2:06:58.840]  saying yeah i mean you're you're i mean you're talking about generality generationally just
[2:06:58.840 --> 2:07:04.120]  complete psychosis there like this is sort of a situation where it'd be nice to put the kick
[2:07:04.120 --> 2:07:08.680]  gloves on and kind of you know talk them down and show them you know the prosperity in south korea
[2:07:08.680 --> 2:07:12.520]  but obviously that's not the case there because they've been manipulated this their individuals
[2:07:12.520 --> 2:07:16.600]  are poisoned mentally and obviously physically look at the parasites and everything else and
[2:07:16.600 --> 2:07:21.240]  the individuals coming over the border there i don't want there to be a strike but there has
[2:07:21.240 --> 2:07:26.760]  to be a strike they're literally just or the or the satanic evil just continues on wow well
[2:07:26.760 --> 2:07:31.560]  we'll see what happens exactly got your number right we've got your email so so next time email
[2:07:31.560 --> 2:07:35.400]  is when you want to come on you don't have to just fight to call into the show okay and uh you

[2:07:39.400 --> 2:07:44.120]  their moves right take trump out this this and i open the call with it this i'm dubbing it and
[2:07:44.120 --> 2:07:49.800]  we could put it out there it's the deep state death hurdle um it's gonna it's gonna commence on
[2:07:49.800 --> 2:07:53.240]  the eve of prisoners into the new year and they're going to give it all they got to try to manipulate
[2:07:53.240 --> 2:07:58.040]  and pull up something big here i pray for the i pray for the president's safety i pray for a lot
[2:07:58.040 --> 2:08:02.600]  of individual safety here and around the world um they're going to go for it because you know
[2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:06.280]  trump played it brilliantly and he was willing to play with china in the beginning he was willing
[2:08:06.280 --> 2:08:10.120]  to deal with them but they were playing both sides and now that's gone we got the tax rate
[2:08:10.120 --> 2:08:14.280]  where we need a country to and boy are they panicking right now they're god schmitz falling thank you

[2:08:40.040 --> 2:08:47.480]  and i saw drudge report put on google schmidt stepping down so it got me thinking the net
[2:08:47.480 --> 2:08:53.160]  neutrality law just passed you know was it in response to that can he not hide things now
[2:08:53.720 --> 2:08:59.320]  where does google go from here and what's the next ceo gonna do well we're gonna find out later with
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:02.920]  dr course he's got an article that just went up on info wars dot com from his sources of why this
[2:09:02.920 --> 2:09:08.440]  happened to schmidt uh but schmidt was a very compromised individual a globalist and had been
[2:09:08.440 --> 2:09:12.440]  running a monopoly in this country so i think the company realizes that they've got a at least
[2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:16.920]  at least signal different leadership uh or trump won't work with them
[2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:24.680]  yeah that blows my mind that all this is coming out with coursey today like you mentioned uh
[2:09:25.400 --> 2:09:29.640]  i guess it's no surprise just because of the power structure and the globalists

[2:16:18.600 --> 2:16:24.360]  trump's executive order targeting black money pools worldwide that are involved in the trafficking
[2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:29.880]  of humans and of course that's heavily what the clinton foundation has been caught being involved
[2:16:29.880 --> 2:16:35.320]  in Haiti and all over the world and associated press investigative reports so you have to understand
[2:16:35.320 --> 2:16:43.640]  folks these people literally see other humans as animals so that's just part of it my info
[2:16:43.640 --> 2:16:47.960]  is is that just schmitt's been a globalist have been blocking all this and you know it keeps
[2:16:47.960 --> 2:16:52.520]  accelerating internet censorship against everybody and trying to hand the web over to the un and
[2:16:52.520 --> 2:16:58.520]  george sorrow so this is just a first big shot a lot is happening right now make no mistake
[2:16:59.400 --> 2:17:00.920]  okay who is up next here
[2:17:03.640 --> 2:17:06.680]  quarry in new york or on the year worldwide go ahead then we'll go to phil
[2:17:08.280 --> 2:17:16.040]  hey alex it's a pleasure and an honor to be with you um basically i uh live here in new york
[2:17:16.040 --> 2:17:24.840]  city it is sort of globalist center as you know and this past weekend um i was at this party
[2:17:24.840 --> 2:17:31.800]  actually for ronan farrow who has you know broke the winestein sexual assault uh information um
[2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:38.440]  and i think basically what they're going to do is use his credibility to move you know i can't speak
[2:17:38.440 --> 2:17:44.200]  to if he's gonna uh if they're going to try to kill trump but i can speak to the fact that
[2:17:44.200 --> 2:17:50.280]  i believe they're going to pivot to you know the sexual assault stuff well they're clearly pivoting
[2:17:50.280 --> 2:17:54.840]  to that because uh of the whole rush of things just a ridiculous joke so then they say oh he's
[2:17:54.840 --> 2:17:59.400]  going to fire mewler because mewler's on to him and don't criticize mewler that's impeachable you
[2:17:59.400 --> 2:18:05.000]  can't even talk about about him he's like god he's untouchable he's the lord you know he runs
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  uranium one and gets payoffs and gives uranium on tar max but well reta lynches on tar max with clinton
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:17.080]  and all the fbi folks involved are on the clinton payroll but that's okay don't don't question it or
[2:18:17.080 --> 2:18:22.520]  you're evil and yes they're moving on to having a whole bunch of new fake women come out that's why
[2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:26.280]  tapes are coming out of women that refuse to be paid off and i don't think it's going to be very
[2:18:26.280 --> 2:18:32.680]  effective what do you think um you know obviously the mewler thing is just a complete joke now and
[2:18:32.680 --> 2:18:36.920]  so you know maybe it is at the point where they're going to have to do something physical against
[2:18:36.920 --> 2:18:42.840]  president but you know i think you have to look at ferro uh he worked for illy clinton actually so
[2:18:42.840 --> 2:18:46.360]  i don't know if people look at that but that's public and that's a good point the people that
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:50.200]  are going to lead the movement to save the women and stop the sexual assaults have worked for the
[2:18:50.200 --> 2:18:55.320]  clinton's exactly yeah and he also before he worked for illy clinton at the state department
[2:18:55.320 --> 2:19:01.240]  he was at unicef so i don't know if this is a un clinton sort of operation but you know i don't
[2:19:01.240 --> 2:19:05.960]  think he's a bad guy i think he you know he's just being directed by his handlers kind of thing um
[2:19:05.960 --> 2:19:12.120]  and at the same party actually don levin was there and this was days after uh you know trump
[2:19:12.120 --> 2:19:17.560]  called me moron which you know he was obviously drinking his his sorrows away i think he wants
[2:19:17.560 --> 2:19:23.800]  the uh the president to like him these people are emotionally just bankrupt yeah you hear
[2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:28.680]  chuckie schumer going i hope the president likes me exactly they just worship power not actually
[2:19:28.680 --> 2:19:33.960]  delivering and being good they worship just the office itself and that's why they're so freaked
[2:19:33.960 --> 2:19:38.040]  out great point thank you quarry very interesting intel thank you for calling and thank you for
[2:19:38.040 --> 2:19:41.240]  thank you for holding i have a great christmas i'm going to be a good boy down to the callers
[2:19:41.240 --> 2:19:47.000]  quickly uh phil in new york phil in new york another caller from new york go ahead hi alex
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:52.600]  i just wanted to say uh mary christmas thank you start out with and yeah this first year in
[2:19:52.600 --> 2:19:56.920]  office i mean i didn't vote for donald trump but at the same time i definitely didn't want
[2:19:56.920 --> 2:20:02.360]  hillary clinton getting in and you know it's been a whirlwind year and you know my kids are growing
[2:20:02.360 --> 2:20:07.000]  up and trying to explain all the changes in the world and everything and i think that they just
[2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:11.160]  got to drop the russia thing you know at this point i mean uh i know it's probably not going to
[2:20:11.160 --> 2:20:15.720]  happen but i read and those evil russians brought up the stock market built up our military and and
[2:20:15.720 --> 2:20:20.520]  like you gave us all these new jobs and huge tax cuts those those evil russians i mean well thank
[2:20:20.520 --> 2:20:26.120]  you president putin if it is him doing all this wow you know you read like i read robert parry
[2:20:26.120 --> 2:20:31.080]  you know consortium news i mean this the guy who broke iran contra stories so you figure he'd be a
[2:20:31.080 --> 2:20:35.640]  darling of the democrats and he's writing about how the russia gate narrative is just ridiculous
[2:20:35.640 --> 2:20:41.160]  it's reverse macarthianism so are all the old real liberal real investigative journalists
[2:20:41.160 --> 2:20:46.760]  cy harsh is saying it's fake uh you've got a wiki leak sassan saying it's fake because it is and now
[2:20:46.760 --> 2:20:51.640]  we have all the proof it's totally made up and you have the intelligence guys you got guys like
[2:20:51.640 --> 2:20:56.440]  bill binney and i think colleen rowley and you have all those whistleblowers and colleen rowley
[2:20:56.440 --> 2:21:01.720]  does thing too highly of robert moeller and you know they're saying there's nothing there if anything
[2:21:01.720 --> 2:21:07.240]  else it was a leak but you can't mention that you know they wanted to rail trump no matter what he
[2:21:07.240 --> 2:21:11.880]  does and i said i think you know you got to give him a chance i'm waiting to see how you're saying
[2:21:11.880 --> 2:21:17.080]  you were neutral on it but seeing the witch hunt has made you more pro-trump i i never thought
[2:21:17.080 --> 2:21:21.960]  putin was involved i thought that was just kind of silly course right yeah i what about what about
[2:21:21.960 --> 2:21:26.680]  401k's being up 35 to 40 points that mean i mean because i know leptis they didn't admit that to me
[2:21:26.680 --> 2:21:32.280]  they go yeah mines up over 30 percent but i still hate him yeah mines up that's a good thing i have
[2:21:32.280 --> 2:21:36.760]  no complaints about that i just want a world to be good for the people i care about and even the
[2:21:36.760 --> 2:21:41.800]  people i don't know you know i want a world where trump is very pragmatic but he's not anti-human
[2:21:41.800 --> 2:21:45.960]  he's not a pedophile and he's not a globalist that's why he's not in their club he's very old
[2:21:45.960 --> 2:21:50.200]  fashion very blue collar really uh you know i mean when it comes down to it the other day
[2:21:50.200 --> 2:21:54.840]  and it cares about the cops which is what i like my brother's the detective so that means a lot
[2:21:55.720 --> 2:22:00.200]  well he's just super old-fashioned and the globalist think he's a joke well guess what old
[2:22:00.200 --> 2:22:05.640]  fashion it was new globalism is tyranny we want old-fashioned prosperity and straight shooting
[2:22:05.640 --> 2:22:10.040]  thank you for the call phil have a great christmas coming up god bless you uh let's go to kevin in
[2:22:10.760 --> 2:22:15.640]  what's wv west virginia you're on the air in the great wv getting the coal mining turned back on
[2:22:15.640 --> 2:22:20.840]  go ahead kevin hey um jack hit the nail in the head especially with what i wanted to
[2:22:21.480 --> 2:22:26.280]  especially what i'm thinking and i'm thinking your christmas surprise is the overthrow of
[2:22:26.280 --> 2:22:33.240]  trump and is them trying to kill him and not a christian indictment or or um donald jr indictment
[2:22:33.240 --> 2:22:38.280]  absolutely i think that this is something that they're trying to pull and um one another question
[2:22:38.280 --> 2:22:43.960]  that i wanted that or another point that i wanted to get at was following um off a zack uh remember
[2:22:43.960 --> 2:22:51.400]  gordy rose the guy founder of d wave saying being in front of um the d wave computer their quantum
[2:22:51.400 --> 2:22:57.880]  computer is like being in front of an alien god so yes this is all interconnected and it is a
[2:22:57.880 --> 2:23:06.040]  spiritual thing as well but i do believe that we are facing a huge huge thing like zack said and i
[2:23:06.040 --> 2:23:10.920]  do believe they're going to try to kill trump absolutely he has done more than what kennedy
[2:23:10.920 --> 2:23:16.840]  did and look what kennedy tried to do and what he got killed for excellent points kevin thank you
[2:23:16.840 --> 2:23:21.960]  for holding let me just finish up i appreciate your call what you said the globalists say we
[2:23:21.960 --> 2:23:27.400]  don't believe in god yet we're creating it with ai and genetic engineering and then the media comes
[2:23:27.400 --> 2:23:31.560]  out goes jones is crazy no one's saying that and and there's no aliens been created well you can
[2:23:31.560 --> 2:23:35.800]  supply humans and animals that's alien not of this world but then you read their own writings they
[2:23:35.800 --> 2:23:39.640]  say it now because they can't suppress what i've been doing what you've been doing they go okay yeah
[2:23:39.640 --> 2:23:46.520]  we are and trump and others are just like this is crazy it's one thing to want to develop all this
[2:23:46.520 --> 2:23:51.000]  that might destroy us but something to say we're all obsolete we've got to be gotten rid of because
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:57.080]  your ai god says get rid of the humans and i will let you merge with me i have the answers but first
[2:23:57.080 --> 2:24:01.400]  that's like emperor palpatine telling you know angus skywalker go do evil stuff and you know
[2:24:01.400 --> 2:24:06.040]  i'll save your wife it didn't end up getting her killed i mean it you know it's the oldest thing in
[2:24:06.040 --> 2:24:13.880]  fables you name it is i'm gonna be god if i just kill everybody it says i'll be a god i mean this

[2:29:25.320 --> 2:29:32.040]  dc bureau chief head q anon that's the folks on fourchan links resignation of google schmitt
[2:29:32.040 --> 2:29:35.880]  the trump's executive order dr coursey of course is a Harvard degree in finance and
[2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:39.400]  banking as an expert in the state department advisor on anti-terrorism so he knows how
[2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:42.600]  to scan through these documents and look at these connections he brought up the whole
[2:29:42.600 --> 2:29:48.840]  fanny may freddy mac looting of obama and then trump jumped on that and defunded it as recommended
[2:29:48.840 --> 2:29:51.960]  so i'm just pointing out that of course he doesn't just go read stuff on
[2:29:51.960 --> 2:29:55.880]  fourchan and just believe it but there's a lot of really good stuff on there uh and so if he's
[2:29:55.880 --> 2:29:59.960]  breaking this down and of course schmitt's been the anti-free market guy he's been the globalist
[2:29:59.960 --> 2:30:05.080]  he's got a lot of the DARPA technology for himself the last 20 years or 19 years since google got
[2:30:05.080 --> 2:30:11.080]  founded uh and he's been very very arrogant just saying we're gods now no one can stop us and pushing
[2:30:11.080 --> 2:30:16.920]  the whole anti-human agenda apple the screen sickness all of it the suicide factories i mean
[2:30:16.920 --> 2:30:21.720]  the whole thing from where the process begins to your children the screen time all of it is
[2:30:21.720 --> 2:30:26.440]  screen sickness as i've coined it and a little dopamine receptors being flipped and manipulated
[2:30:26.440 --> 2:30:31.320]  like sean parker of facebook said so suddenly when trump got in all these execs are going it's evil
[2:30:31.320 --> 2:30:35.880]  it's bad we admit it's bad we're sorry it was designed to basically make like your phones a video
[2:30:35.880 --> 2:30:40.760]  game but where we track and control you and add stimuli to politically manipulate you when we
[2:30:40.760 --> 2:30:45.160]  popped out massive amounts of soy products in these areas to create mental illness in men and
[2:30:45.160 --> 2:30:51.640]  women uh i mean they know what they're doing uh and that's why they attack us so just just encapsulating
[2:30:51.640 --> 2:30:56.040]  this doctor of course thanks for popping on on short notice uh what what's going on in the tea
[2:30:56.040 --> 2:31:00.760]  leaves here with the schmitt resignation because you know you and i and others have been hammering
[2:31:00.760 --> 2:31:05.880]  we need any trust comes put in somebody at the scourge exchange commission that is big on any
[2:31:05.880 --> 2:31:10.600]  trust with google facebook twitter uh and so i mean is this a sign of their capitulation because
[2:31:10.600 --> 2:31:16.120]  i've only seen acceleration in their censoring i think this is the beginning i uh when i
[2:31:16.760 --> 2:31:22.600]  noticed the q and on post today and i've been following q and on much more closely he appears
[2:31:22.600 --> 2:31:29.480]  to be an insider who is really uh telegraphing information coming out of the white house uh
[2:31:29.480 --> 2:31:37.720]  and in advance and he's been very very accurate now the post today was that there is a no coincidence
[2:31:37.720 --> 2:31:43.240]  you know one of the fundamental rules of politics nothing's a coincidence that eric schmitt resigns
[2:31:43.800 --> 2:31:51.320]  after trump signs this e o executive order now the executive order is one that's a clamp down
[2:31:51.320 --> 2:31:57.560]  on international human rights abuses and as i read it one of the things it's targeted at is
[2:31:57.560 --> 2:32:02.120]  the international sex trade i mean this is really going after the money what trump has
[2:32:02.120 --> 2:32:12.120]  decided to do is utilize a variety of federal laws to confiscate the money of human rights abusers
[2:32:12.120 --> 2:32:19.960]  worldwide and this i think is a carefully thought out plan i think trump does believe
[2:32:19.960 --> 2:32:25.080]  that the new world order and the whole globalists are of satanists that they have at their heart
[2:32:25.080 --> 2:32:29.880]  the pedophilia and trump is really taking steps i think we're going to see more and more of it over
[2:32:29.880 --> 2:32:35.480]  the next few months to go after those engaging in human rights abuses and take their money away
[2:32:35.480 --> 2:32:40.760]  which is really follow the money it's a very effective just like jerry epstein and and just all
[2:32:40.760 --> 2:32:46.200]  these people this is the satanic glue that holds these people together and the word i've got from
[2:32:46.200 --> 2:32:51.240]  my intelligence sources is that trump and others worldwide is green-lighted open season on these
[2:32:51.240 --> 2:32:57.160]  people that during full panic mode i think that's correct and i think we're going to see a whole
[2:32:57.160 --> 2:33:03.240]  series of indictments and other confiscations of money going on i think trump is extremely
[2:33:03.240 --> 2:33:09.640]  serious about this and and anyone who doubts trumps resolve just has to take a look at how
[2:33:09.640 --> 2:33:15.480]  carefully he passed this tax bill he fulfilled his promises trump has been fulfilling promises
[2:33:15.480 --> 2:33:22.520]  left and right i see increasing devotion to god and increasing statements about his devotion to
[2:33:22.520 --> 2:33:27.480]  god coming from trump i think this is a real turnaround and you know the globalists should
[2:33:27.480 --> 2:33:33.800]  be on the run because i think trump is coming after them and it's not just rhetoric he's delivering
[2:33:33.800 --> 2:33:37.560]  the new york times says trump's planning a coup which of course they're playing the coup and
[2:33:37.560 --> 2:33:42.760]  top democrat officials are you know calling for trump pence uh uh uh you name it to be killed
[2:33:42.760 --> 2:33:51.400]  well obama advisor wants pence uh wants uh mcconnell and once ryan killed the tax cut the sickening
[2:33:51.400 --> 2:33:57.160]  evil left thought they had their foot on the neck of america but now they are just in full
[2:33:57.160 --> 2:34:04.200]  disgusting frothing frenzy but they really had it out for everybody they're sick that's right
[2:34:04.200 --> 2:34:11.240]  and the also treasury came out with an analysis of some 13 people on this executive order that
[2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:17.800]  they've never named the president of gambia uh miramar general and the researchers are already
[2:34:17.800 --> 2:34:23.720]  finding these people have deep ties to the clintons and to the clinton foundation and you know the
[2:34:23.720 --> 2:34:31.000]  the clintons ties to pedophilia go back to this laura sillsby who was arrested in haydee trying
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:37.320]  to smuggle 33 children out and convicted documentation and convicted and she changed her name now
[2:34:37.320 --> 2:34:42.440]  and and and runs a bill for disadvantaged children over and over again the same mo from sandusky on
[2:34:43.640 --> 2:34:48.360]  and and the clintons are very deeply tied with these people with the with sillsby in her operation
[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:54.200]  in haydee uh as they are with eppstein i i think this is all going to come out i think really the
[2:34:54.200 --> 2:35:00.840]  pedophilia in hollywood in new york then among the arts and among the you know the elite i think
[2:35:00.840 --> 2:35:05.320]  this is going to be the next shoot of all and i'm very pleased to see that trump signed this
[2:35:05.320 --> 2:35:10.360]  the executive order got very little attention it was a difficult order to read you had to really
[2:35:10.360 --> 2:35:15.080]  study it you had to go look up the law really it's a it's an executive order targeting sex
[2:35:15.080 --> 2:35:19.240]  traffic women children you name it and other listed human rights violations which we know
[2:35:19.240 --> 2:35:24.520]  isn't just a funding mechanism of these intergovernmental black ops the corrupt networks the black
[2:35:24.520 --> 2:35:31.080]  hat networks it is it's the compromising system it's the initiation and trump realizes that he
[2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:37.480]  can get billions of dollars reducing the deficit reducing the you know the debt by just simply
[2:35:37.480 --> 2:35:42.920]  confiscating the money of these human rights abuse and then cut off their ability to engage
[2:35:42.920 --> 2:35:47.880]  in a few other crimes for future crimes precisely precisely this is the most effective action i've
[2:35:47.880 --> 2:35:53.240]  seen any american president take ever understanding that you know what he did when he got in a year
[2:35:53.240 --> 2:35:57.640]  ago i've talked to all the black ops people they literally wiped out the mexican drug cartels their
[2:35:57.640 --> 2:36:01.880]  networks here just wiped they're almost all gone now and they just wiped them out in the first
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:05.880]  eight nine months of this year uh because it's like trump's like no we're not going to fund
[2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:11.160]  radical islam boom no and then russia helped no we're not going to let the mexican drug cartels
[2:36:11.160 --> 2:36:14.760]  run around we're not doing business with me more wipe them out and now going over the pedophile
[2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:20.200]  rings wipe them out it is incredible and but i really liked about the way trump did this is he
[2:36:20.200 --> 2:36:27.240]  didn't make a fanfare of it the the big news was you know that the tax cut the new you know
[2:36:27.240 --> 2:36:33.320]  that was the news this he just saw it very quietly signed and then you have to watch
[2:36:33.880 --> 2:36:37.800]  and that tells you it's military because he never talks about something military
[2:36:37.800 --> 2:36:42.280]  before it happens so you notice very quietly done but that's what i was talking to some of my uh
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:46.840]  military sources people they're involved in this they said last week we had him on this week
[2:36:47.640 --> 2:36:51.480]  craigs were talking about all these rich families are fleeing they're just running they're leaving
[2:36:51.480 --> 2:36:55.000]  their stuff in their houses and running to the middle east and and these aren't these aren't
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:37:01.160]  muslims these are rich prominent liberals are are hauling ass well and i see the intelligence
[2:37:01.160 --> 2:37:07.160]  connections in here i mean this is the this is the professional way to do it very quietly a very
[2:37:07.160 --> 2:37:13.880]  well-written crafted executive order there's a whole department within treasury for confiscating
[2:37:13.880 --> 2:37:20.200]  the assets overseas and the united states of these international criminals and if trump goes after
[2:37:20.200 --> 2:37:25.640]  the money he's going to make a huge impact and he doesn't have to say much about it but the fact
[2:37:25.640 --> 2:37:30.840]  that he's doing it this way indicates to me it's serious well they already know quietly they already
[2:37:30.840 --> 2:37:34.360]  know because it's like evacuating from saigon or something you know they're hanging off the

[2:42:45.160 --> 2:42:55.160]  you
[2:42:58.680 --> 2:43:03.400]  man we trolled the media i took rodent stone down to my favorite shooting range the range
[2:43:03.400 --> 2:43:08.520]  is what's called here in austin sexes a couple days ago we said we're defensively out here training
[2:43:08.520 --> 2:43:14.200]  for all the liberal sing hashtag hunt republicans so the media is now spinning at new york daily news
[2:43:14.200 --> 2:43:18.680]  you name it that we're out training to kill people and then roger doesn't do a lot of shooting
[2:43:18.680 --> 2:43:23.000]  so he's getting instructed here's the safety here's where you put your finger i'm shooting a
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:26.920]  lot of guns i've never shot before of course i was shooting bullseye but still you know we're not
[2:43:26.920 --> 2:43:31.800]  trying to act like we know everything out there um but it was it was good to see roger shooting we
[2:43:31.800 --> 2:43:37.000]  weren't out there going we're tactical master you know navy seals black ops delta force no we're
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:40.840]  just out there promote the second amendment and i'm a pretty good shot and do quite a bit of
[2:43:40.840 --> 2:43:44.600]  shooting uh but as for roger he's only shot gun three or four times in his life and he got ready
[2:43:44.600 --> 2:43:49.240]  to shoot bullseye after about 30 minutes shooting but it is quite the heyday they're having right
[2:43:49.240 --> 2:43:55.320]  now and we knew they would see because they live in the cloistered compact cities like roger did
[2:43:55.320 --> 2:44:00.840]  and never got around it so we take them back out and then undemestricate them i mean that's what we
[2:44:00.840 --> 2:44:07.080]  do and so we had a lot of fun and we were live streaming it i don't want to bring a bunch of hd
[2:44:07.080 --> 2:44:10.840]  equipment because then we get busy and never gets pulled out we just streamed an hour and a half live
[2:44:10.840 --> 2:44:15.720]  shooting and uh that's why it's got millions of views now of the internet and all over television

[2:44:46.360 --> 2:44:53.080]  deep state are they or the uh uh new world order whatever you want to call them are they
[2:44:54.760 --> 2:45:01.640]  mainly in the senate or the operatives everywhere they're in big corporations they're in big banks
[2:45:01.640 --> 2:45:06.520]  there in hollywood they're globalists that are anti-human that want to domesticate people to control
[2:45:06.520 --> 2:45:11.800]  them in our anti free market so they're ultra rich that don't want other people to become wealthy
[2:45:11.800 --> 2:45:16.040]  and they're just social engineers they're cold-blooded they hate the general public they have an
[2:45:16.040 --> 2:45:20.760]  extreme hatred of everybody and want and want to kill everybody and i know that sounds crazy but
[2:45:20.760 --> 2:45:25.080]  look at what the communists did or hitler i mean it that's what they want it's a global
[2:45:25.080 --> 2:45:29.800]  exterminous world plan they believe that super machines are coming out they're going to merge with
[2:45:29.800 --> 2:45:36.120]  they've already said we're building a world that's anti-human post-human uh and that's whether it's uh
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:41.400]  you know people that the other heads of google or others they're all on record saying it
[2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:50.040]  well they came out in uh tines and um talked about uh uh trump feeling a cool in the united
[2:45:50.040 --> 2:45:56.120]  states and i think uh i've been thinking about this for a couple weeks now i think whatever it
[2:45:56.120 --> 2:46:03.400]  looked like first of all he'd get a new ag somebody who would do it and um he'd see as though he knows
[2:46:03.400 --> 2:46:12.600]  all the names of everybody that you know contradictory to this country what would be the uh
[2:46:14.520 --> 2:46:23.000]  oh i don't know the fact that he uh you know i know uh due to the rules of order they have a
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:28.440]  subject in the senate i'm pretty sure of the congress well sure well i mean here's what's
[2:46:28.440 --> 2:46:33.080]  happened weird the globalists see us as a coup the voters that they think they run the country so
[2:46:33.080 --> 2:46:37.480]  they see us as stealing it back and so they're saying trump restoring the republic through
[2:46:38.360 --> 2:46:43.560]  rule of law and through constitutional process they're dubbing that a coup as they try to run a
[2:46:43.560 --> 2:46:49.640]  crew god bless you john i appreciate your call great points but but again they have nothing
[2:46:49.640 --> 2:46:55.160]  left but violence now they're planning something big we have to be aware of it and that's all we've
[2:46:55.160 --> 2:47:00.440]  beaten them so far in every passing week their chances of turning this around get worse and worse
[2:47:00.440 --> 2:47:06.200]  and worse so good things are happening thank god for that rich in wisconsin then debora rich thanks
[2:47:06.200 --> 2:47:12.040]  for holding her on the air alex merry christmas how are you sir i'm great thanks for calling god
[2:47:12.040 --> 2:47:18.760]  bless you god bless um i want to bring up something you said earlier that we're in a spiritual war
[2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:24.040]  and that could not be more true now than ever before because of the fact that the mainstream
[2:47:24.040 --> 2:47:29.960]  media is coming after us the deep state coming after us i want to bring back uh an editorial that
[2:47:29.960 --> 2:47:35.400]  the l.a times did uh this was a couple years ago i want to say basically stating that the next
[2:47:35.400 --> 2:47:40.680]  targets were going to be uh conservatives and also christians instead of radical islamic terrorists
[2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:46.600]  now more than ever i believe that that's the case and i believe that the establishment of
[2:47:46.600 --> 2:47:51.560]  the deep state the military industrial complex they're going to come after us well that's it
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:56.600]  if they can take out trump then they think they're just going to one by one and an undeclare war
[2:47:56.600 --> 2:48:03.400]  come after us and that's why if that kicks off the best defense is a good offense so if they
[2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:09.240]  strike first and take out the president and do a bunch of stuff a lot of people i know the military
[2:48:09.240 --> 2:48:14.040]  you name it aren't going to roll over to the globalists the democrats the fortune 100 people
[2:48:14.040 --> 2:48:18.120]  and and by the way the globalists know that most of them have already fled to armored redoubts
[2:48:18.120 --> 2:48:24.440]  and undisclosed locations in kawaii uh in tazmania in the cook islands in luxenberg
[2:48:25.080 --> 2:48:30.200]  private areas of the bahamas but most of the time their own security people hate them and
[2:48:30.200 --> 2:48:35.640]  know their pedophiles and stuff so uh very quickly once they've been isolated and are in their
[2:48:35.640 --> 2:48:43.640]  keeps uh those keeps will be their graves without question without question and you said
[2:48:43.640 --> 2:48:48.440]  of you know having a good offense and you know we need to put on the full armor of god but a lot
[2:48:48.440 --> 2:48:54.120]  of people have forgotten to use their swords and i think that now more than ever that's very very
[2:48:54.120 --> 2:48:59.720]  important we need to you know spread christmas cheer we need to to be there for i mean isn't
[2:48:59.720 --> 2:49:06.280]  the sword speaking out telling the truth taking action being heard yes we are truth seekers we are
[2:49:06.280 --> 2:49:10.360]  truth bringers and we get to bring it now more than ever whether it's through a microphone or
[2:49:10.360 --> 2:49:13.880]  a megaphone brother no no i agree whenever the left is getting my face for no reason they always
[2:49:13.880 --> 2:49:17.880]  want to say you're a loser you're a failure they see my family they go i thought you didn't have
[2:49:17.880 --> 2:49:23.560]  your family screw them what do you screw your kids i'm a saving satan oh i mean say it's spiritual
[2:49:23.560 --> 2:49:27.480]  they literally do the even if they don't get on their knees of the devil they're these hateful
[2:49:28.840 --> 2:49:35.400]  they want to run everything they want to run and then that's who they are and and they just
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:41.640]  can't stand it when you just laugh at them and genuinely go ha ha ha they don't know what to do
[2:49:41.640 --> 2:49:47.240]  and they and they can't and they go huh this is like run to their cars because someone actually
[2:49:47.240 --> 2:49:53.640]  stood up to them absolutely maybe uh maybe they need some christmas in their lives maybe they
[2:49:53.640 --> 2:49:58.440]  need jesus in their lives we can we can certainly bring that message to them well that's it i mean
[2:49:58.440 --> 2:50:02.440]  if they wonder why their god isn't delivering why they're so miserable why don't they try something
[2:50:02.440 --> 2:50:06.840]  else if their heart hadn't been completely turned over to evil god isn't like the devil that comes
[2:50:06.840 --> 2:50:12.840]  in by force or manipulates you you have to ask god into your heart god you have to ask jesus
[2:50:12.840 --> 2:50:16.840]  in your heart it's real see what happens that bless you i appreciate your call rich
[2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:23.080]  let's go ahead and talk to jeff in vancouver island why have it up there that is so pretty jeff
[2:50:23.080 --> 2:50:28.840]  thanks for holding her on the air hey thanks alex just uh just i want to echo with the last
[2:50:28.840 --> 2:50:35.480]  the caller was saying you know i think um the way i see it is i'm like i'm super jealous of
[2:50:36.040 --> 2:50:40.760]  your president there we've got uh we've got a long ways to go up here but uh you know i just
[2:50:40.760 --> 2:50:47.000]  want to say the way i see it is the the the cultivator has gone through the guard and the
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:53.800]  weeds are getting taken out but it just is so imperative right now for team trump republicans
[2:50:53.800 --> 2:51:00.520]  those are that are awake those that uh that know god to really plant what you can into that
[2:51:01.480 --> 2:51:07.080]  that which has just been cultivated over because if you don't um there's just going to be another
[2:51:07.080 --> 2:51:12.760]  way but weeds go that's right we have to plant seeds we have to do that or the evil comes back
[2:51:12.760 --> 2:51:18.040]  over we the only thing that evil men in tyranny deflurs is that good men do nothing you're absolutely
[2:51:18.040 --> 2:51:21.800]  right that doesn't mean the fake little glitterbug preachers that just want to be rock stars it
[2:51:21.800 --> 2:51:26.200]  means real men that are already satisfied already have lives we want to be left alone
[2:51:26.200 --> 2:51:31.560]  we don't want power well sorry if we don't go out there and fill the gaps and at least educate
[2:51:31.560 --> 2:51:36.280]  others and find good leaders to be in positions we're going to be controlled by these evil doers
[2:51:37.400 --> 2:51:41.960]  exactly and you know trump i saw an interview with trump where he was sort of like a spectator
[2:51:41.960 --> 2:51:46.840]  watching and saying you know i i i'm not going to run for president if somebody steps up well you
[2:51:46.840 --> 2:51:53.800]  know that he's the leader right now of taking people from a spectator into full action and the
[2:51:53.800 --> 2:51:58.360]  stuff he's done in one year is mind blowing and i want to say to everybody out there what trump
[2:51:58.360 --> 2:52:05.080]  needs is a team of people who that have dropped their NFL tickets that have thrown out hollywood
[2:52:05.080 --> 2:52:11.400]  and big corporations that uh are inspectors and church to step up and you know uh how about
[2:52:11.400 --> 2:52:17.560]  a block barbecue start a flag football team do something because there's a lot of people in
[2:52:17.560 --> 2:52:23.640]  the valley of decisions on the left that when this goes off and they're like deer in the headlights
[2:52:23.640 --> 2:52:27.640]  they're going to eat somewhere to go to and they're going to agree the number one thing is getting
[2:52:27.640 --> 2:52:31.880]  back to the neighborhood barbecues getting out of the system getting out of sitting around and
[2:52:31.880 --> 2:52:35.720]  watching something that isn't even our family and making the center of our lives are absolutely
[2:52:35.720 --> 2:52:41.800]  right it is pure poison all of it is and you're absolutely right god bless you i appreciate you
[2:52:41.800 --> 2:52:46.280]  calling they hate talk radio because it's a bunch of us getting together and you're calling in and
[2:52:46.280 --> 2:52:50.680]  it's not scripted it's not controlled you know they admit on cnn most those callers are vetted
[2:52:50.680 --> 2:52:55.480]  democrats when they you know everyone's will take a call or something it's all fake so they have like
[2:52:55.480 --> 2:53:00.760]  six seven guests on those shows make it look like everybody's in consensus with the baloney
[2:53:00.760 --> 2:53:06.040]  that they're spewing out deborah you're up next in 70 seconds and then louis then i hand the baton

[2:54:26.840 --> 2:54:33.400]  out by thanking you for your wonderful product suite that's impressed guard silver bullet and
[2:54:33.400 --> 2:54:40.840]  survival shield and thank you for giving my husband some sleep back wow and for helping

[2:54:46.520 --> 2:54:52.120]  with those products those are all well documented super high quality products well with the prostitute
[2:54:52.120 --> 2:54:58.440]  guard he was down to being able to sleep only an hour a night and he's up to three hours the night
[2:54:58.440 --> 2:55:02.840]  and he's only been on one bottle oh is that because of swelling in the prostate having a urinary
[2:55:02.840 --> 2:55:10.760]  stomach yes and so just if you could imagine going from one to three hours sleep well even
[2:55:10.760 --> 2:55:13.880]  even the fda that doesn't want people to make claims with supplements because the drug companies
[2:55:13.880 --> 2:55:19.480]  want to buy it all up admit saupon meadow there's no drug that works just good for your prostate
[2:55:19.480 --> 2:55:24.840]  and in other glands as well and then we've got six or seven other concentrated compounds
[2:55:24.840 --> 2:55:28.840]  where i know people that have just thanked me on the street saying man i was taking other
[2:55:28.840 --> 2:55:33.400]  stuff that wasn't as strong why is this so good i sleep to the night not having to urinate now my
[2:55:33.400 --> 2:55:38.040]  prostate i'm just saying hey it's what god gave us saupon meadow you name it so thank you for the
[2:55:38.040 --> 2:55:44.920]  right well big pharma completely failed us i mean you know it's just terrible but i'm a two-time
[2:55:44.920 --> 2:55:49.880]  cancer survivor and i started taking these survival shields because i've had a lot of
[2:55:49.880 --> 2:55:56.760]  radiation a lot of metals from chemo and my thyroid is not good so i need the iodine
[2:55:56.760 --> 2:56:02.600]  and then the silver bullet i'm hoping will help bring me back and i'm hoping to get
[2:56:02.600 --> 2:56:07.000]  vitamins eventually it's just the did you get any good effects from the from the color
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:14.600]  silver i mean from the iodine um yeah i think i think i'm seeing some alex and i'm very excited

[2:56:36.360 --> 2:56:41.240]  as well we just go out whenever it's documented to work that's what we sell uh so so so don't
[2:56:41.240 --> 2:56:47.240]  don't thank me thank you so much uh deborah well and i think dr group pro of his research because
[2:56:47.240 --> 2:56:55.080]  if he hadn't done that well i know what he helps also he just goes out and finds the very best
[2:56:55.080 --> 2:56:59.160]  organic sources too that's why we can't get it half the time though because he wants to make it so
[2:56:59.160 --> 2:57:02.920]  good which i understand but sometimes there's no such thing as perfection on the planet
[2:57:02.920 --> 2:57:08.280]  because the planet's so toxic you know what i mean oh absolutely our food our water and our air
[2:57:08.280 --> 2:57:14.520]  are just horrible arizona has been q engineered to no end for the last two months and i finally
[2:57:14.520 --> 2:57:19.640]  wrote to president trump and to our governor who i will not vote for our governor again
[2:57:20.600 --> 2:57:27.160]  because he he has no either has no clue or he's part of the wrong side of the team but um he's a
[2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:35.320]  republican but uh it just that's what i wanted to talk to you about today alex we cannot afford
[2:57:36.280 --> 2:57:44.440]  to sigh relief just because we got a tax break my big huge concern and and i hope you can help
[2:57:44.440 --> 2:57:53.400]  all the people with this is that we have got to take our voting back uh tucker carlson had um
[2:57:53.400 --> 2:57:58.120]  mayor on from maryland the other day who had said that they passed the law in maryland
[2:57:58.760 --> 2:58:03.080]  isn't whatever town or city he was going to finish up with you deborah then i promised
[2:58:03.080 --> 2:58:06.520]  coda louis and mike service is taking over but he doesn't know how to be right shotgun i want you
[2:58:06.520 --> 2:58:10.120]  to finish your point it's absolutely election fraud's been proven they made fun of trump talking
[2:58:10.120 --> 2:58:16.680]  about it because they know it's their achilles heel it's their only hope fuel your body with carnivore
[2:58:16.680 --> 2:58:21.720]  the new digestive enzyme product by info war's life digestive enzymes assist in the digestive
[2:58:21.720 --> 2:58:26.120]  process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily
[2:58:26.120 --> 2:58:30.760]  absorbable components they also help prevent discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation
[2:58:30.760 --> 2:58:36.120]  of undigested food particles in the gut digestive enzyme production declines as we age carnivore is
[2:58:36.120 --> 2:58:41.080]  filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body enjoy the full potential
[2:58:41.080 --> 2:58:46.360]  of protein rich foods again you can eat protein heavy foods now while minimizing the later
[2:58:46.360 --> 2:58:51.320]  indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets just one pill with every
[2:58:51.320 --> 2:58:56.280]  high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids the building
[2:58:56.280 --> 2:59:02.760]  blocks to your muscles carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates
[2:59:02.760 --> 2:59:08.520]  so you can fully digest all types of meals don't let a meal go to waste use carnivore by info war's
[2:59:08.520 --> 2:59:18.680]  life head to info wars life dot com and secure your bottle now that's info wars life dot com
[2:59:18.680 --> 2:59:31.160]  live from austin texas broadcasting world-wide it's alex jones
[2:59:31.160 --> 2:59:43.640]  so
[2:59:53.480 --> 2:59:57.560]  all right deborah in arizona you were getting into election fraud and i gotta say i'm very proud of
[2:59:57.560 --> 3:00:03.800]  tucker carlson uh sean hattie tucker carlson uh just are so dead on so hardcore with the research
[3:00:03.800 --> 3:00:09.560]  so ahead of the curve of any other mainstream media they're the only thing on broadcast tv or
[3:00:09.560 --> 3:00:13.880]  cable television because they're on some local stations that broadcast it that tells the truth
[3:00:14.840 --> 3:00:19.400]  and it's very refreshing i'm not in competition with mainstream media i wish it was all good
[3:00:19.400 --> 3:00:25.160]  we could you know live in the future together and then you have a great world uh but no that's not
[3:00:25.160 --> 3:00:29.560]  the case most of it as we know is horrible fox business has some great shows i think lou dobbs
[3:00:29.560 --> 3:00:34.280]  ought to be on regular fox uh varni ought to be on regular fox i mean those are good libertarian
[3:00:34.280 --> 3:00:39.800]  people that care about prosperity care about the truth but when you sit there and you look at all
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:44.360]  the other fake conservatives and fake liberals it's truly sickening and remember we had the
[3:00:44.360 --> 3:00:47.720]  pew research and a bunch of others that showed over three and a half million illegals voted
[3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:53.720]  from the election and trump went with that number well instead of saying pew and and george
[3:00:53.720 --> 3:00:59.320]  washington uh university and all these others they just went jones claims it and trump went with it
[3:00:59.320 --> 3:01:05.800]  like i'm this discredited figure so that's the tactic over here i'm covering all these studies
[3:01:05.800 --> 3:01:09.160]  and all the research and all the facts of the past election and the current election and
[3:01:09.160 --> 3:01:14.280]  what had just happened and i'm saying yeah it's over three million then trump reports on that
[3:01:14.920 --> 3:01:19.800]  and they go he got it from alex jones to make it sound like it's discrediting and then the
[3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:25.960]  actual numbers came out this year from harvard it was over seven million potential people voting
[3:01:25.960 --> 3:01:30.600]  the names of dead people they know that happened they just didn't get each specific instance
[3:01:30.600 --> 3:01:35.800]  broken down uh so it's much worse than we thought that the democrats have passed laws all over
[3:01:35.800 --> 3:01:42.680]  to let illegals vote and the feds come in and say they can't do it uh so it's amazing and you got
[3:01:42.680 --> 3:01:47.240]  out of state voters coming in you got hillary sealant the nomination from sanders where he'd
[3:01:47.240 --> 3:01:53.400]  win states that she just take the delegates i mean their stonewalling doesn't work anymore
[3:01:53.960 --> 3:01:58.120]  but you're right uh they definitely and i don't want to die on that hill is one one of the
[3:01:58.120 --> 3:02:01.800]  producers said uh the roya more things we were all just sick of hearing about it we all had
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:07.320]  roya more fatigue not in a bad way but yeah they had a bunch of people from around the state coming
[3:02:07.320 --> 3:02:12.120]  in voting they're on video bragging they had him saying he'd lose by 10 to 15 points in all the polls
[3:02:12.120 --> 3:02:16.360]  and then he lost by half a point that's a way to lie so people think oh i better bandwagon
[3:02:16.360 --> 3:02:21.640]  you know if i if he's gonna lose i better vote for the winner so a lot of stuff happened of course
[3:02:21.640 --> 3:02:27.640]  roya more won you think alabamans want a bunch of outsiders telling them what to do so it's i mean
[3:02:27.640 --> 3:02:34.280]  it's a ruby red state and the evidence shows that they stole it they stole i always get it flipped
[3:02:34.280 --> 3:02:41.480]  because memory doesn't serve they stole five states and hillary tried to steal six others
[3:02:41.480 --> 3:02:46.200]  local state governments confirmed homeland security the justice department was breaking in
[3:02:46.200 --> 3:02:50.360]  loretta lynch was breaking into the computers live time trying to flip it they were like
[3:02:50.360 --> 3:02:56.120]  we have justice department you know isp is hitting us not to mention the buses with
[3:02:56.120 --> 3:02:59.880]  illegals coming to vote the buses with people voting in dead people's names which the democrats
[3:02:59.880 --> 3:03:05.320]  all got caught on tape scores of times by veritas and everybody else but opama went on tv and he
[3:03:05.320 --> 3:03:11.240]  told people that were illegally to go vote so yes we know what's going on and you're right debora
[3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:16.360]  all these states have passed it were no ids needed so they can look at the obituary hand out the
[3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:20.280]  names and have them vote 10 times so how do you counter that because i think your concern
[3:03:20.280 --> 3:03:23.880]  is one of their main ways they're going to get us and we'll talk to lewis in california
[3:03:24.520 --> 3:03:30.120]  well that is my concern i have called down to the board of elections all the way back in 2000
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:38.360]  and probably seven and said hey you know how can i be assured that our votes are being counted and
[3:03:38.360 --> 3:03:43.640]  that the state are by citizens of the united states because like you i'm in a border state alec
[3:03:43.640 --> 3:03:54.200]  i have seen for 20 years or more people pouring into our state pouring into our state and sheriff
[3:03:54.200 --> 3:04:02.440]  joe arpio tried to enforce the laws that the arizona people passed us v 10 70 and jan brewer was in
[3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:09.560]  office and obama came out and shut it down and and everything that we've tried to do for the last
[3:04:09.560 --> 3:04:17.400]  20 years they have stopped it and and it's backfired on us now we are running out of time that i think
[3:04:17.400 --> 3:04:22.920]  the single most important thing that we can do to help our president is to have people get out
[3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:28.200]  there and run for office i don't care i vote for farmer joe at this point before i vote for the
[3:04:28.200 --> 3:04:34.200]  people that are in currently an office on both sides of the fence a lot of them are bad and we've
[3:04:34.200 --> 3:04:38.040]  got and if you run for office you can educate people about the topics even if you don't win great
[3:04:38.040 --> 3:04:42.680]  point deborah god bless you and i appreciate your support i really do get merry christmas and a happy
[3:04:42.680 --> 3:04:47.240]  new year be safe with this big holiday coming up uh louis in california thanks for holding by the way
[3:04:47.240 --> 3:04:51.720]  cernovich is late with an engagement getting to the mic so i'm not taking over this time here
[3:04:51.720 --> 3:04:55.720]  we like mike doing the show uh oh nick there he is now so we got a break we're gonna come back to
[3:04:55.720 --> 3:04:59.560]  him uh so louis in california go ahead and finish up i'm gonna hand them a ton to mike
[3:04:59.560 --> 3:05:05.640]  mike cernovich go ahead thank you alex for your time i'm sitting here looking at a picture of a
[3:05:05.640 --> 3:05:11.560]  norman rockwell painting of the old christmas traditional it's all warm and fuzzy got a little
[3:05:11.560 --> 3:05:18.120]  kitty by the fire and all that and i remember these images from when i was a child of christmas and
[3:05:18.120 --> 3:05:25.560]  all these images have been distorted by the media strategically since we were child children
[3:05:25.560 --> 3:05:35.240]  and then replaced with anti christian imagery in a very uh diabolical way and very similar patterns
[3:05:35.240 --> 3:05:44.920]  of this imagery have shown up in false flag and terrorist uh events in our country for example
[3:05:44.920 --> 3:05:53.480]  the canadian assassination or 9 11 or the las vegas shootings and or the aurora theater shootings
[3:05:53.480 --> 3:06:03.480]  these are all extremely rich in symbolism in a way that could not be done by a single lone wolf
[3:06:05.160 --> 3:06:14.040]  perpetrators these are they're using computers and satellites and high tech to terrify the public
[3:06:14.040 --> 3:06:22.360]  with the media and still steal our humaneness from it no that's absolutely it's like it's an
[3:06:22.360 --> 3:06:26.120]  alien takeover and i'm not saying it's an alien takeover but it's like one god bless you have a
[3:06:26.120 --> 3:06:29.560]  great christmas i'm gonna jump now because mike got here a little bit late but as soon as i said
[3:06:29.560 --> 3:06:33.160]  mike isn't here yet they popped him up he's been waiting i guess five minutes i want to turn over
[3:06:33.160 --> 3:06:37.240]  to mike cernovich investigative journalist mike i just want to get your take on this and then you're
[3:06:37.240 --> 3:06:41.960]  taking over thanks for hosting what do you make of the tax cuts and all the crazy stuff happening
[3:06:41.960 --> 3:06:47.880]  and schmidt stepping down and just and just the the flame thrower tether editing tapes of you and
[3:06:47.880 --> 3:06:52.360]  editing tapes of me we have i've seen stuff about me totally edited uh notice there's no video it's
[3:06:52.360 --> 3:06:56.440]  always like edited where it's we're saying these things we never said we were hypothetically
[3:06:56.440 --> 3:07:01.160]  talking about things i mean they are going to the next level right now they're really desperate
[3:07:02.280 --> 3:07:07.560]  yeah i just held what many people are calling the most successful am a and read it history
[3:07:07.560 --> 3:07:12.920]  so that's why i was a little bit late and you know i think you should do one too maybe because
[3:07:12.920 --> 3:07:17.480]  yours will be even bigger just like yours was the number one podcast ever for joe rogan
[3:07:17.480 --> 3:07:24.120]  and what they've done now and this is a deep state funded operation of course is you and i like
[3:07:24.120 --> 3:07:29.480]  we'll do a podcast and i'll go oh yeah alex like you know me i hate women and then they'll clip
[3:07:29.480 --> 3:07:34.760]  that and they'll go oh my god you know here cernovich and alex and it's like no no we're we're
[3:07:34.760 --> 3:07:40.360]  making fun of people who say that or think we say that and they create these sound boards but the
[3:07:40.360 --> 3:07:47.960]  reason it's backfiring is that their their fabrications have become so elaborate that no intelligent
[3:07:47.960 --> 3:07:55.160]  rational person will believe anything so you and i we're both mortals we're not gods we're just
[3:07:55.160 --> 3:08:01.800]  humble men we will eventually falter but when we do nobody's even gonna believe that because
[3:08:01.800 --> 3:08:06.680]  there have been so many outright lies and fabrications about us that people are go oh what's
[3:08:06.680 --> 3:08:11.320]  that like another edited video what's that like another photoshop oh you know another more fake
[3:08:11.320 --> 3:08:17.160]  news article so it's actually backfiring on them because now nobody will believe anything
[3:08:17.160 --> 3:08:20.840]  bad about us i'm very well just like the women that have been taping people offering a money
[3:08:20.840 --> 3:08:26.840]  a lot about trump quarter million i mean it's just pure bull yeah false accusations are the
[3:08:26.840 --> 3:08:31.960]  best thing that can happen to a public figure because then nobody will believe anything they're
[3:08:31.960 --> 3:08:37.320]  just like oh wow you know we're so used to these people being lied about we're so used to these
[3:08:37.320 --> 3:08:43.240]  people being fabricated about that why would i believe anything negative anybody actually says
[3:08:43.240 --> 3:08:49.560]  so it's actually very helpful for us and i welcome the attacks and that's why i like the attacks and
[3:08:49.560 --> 3:08:53.640]  hope they keep coming we don't just say that they always think we just say that that tough though
[3:08:53.640 --> 3:08:58.520]  these fake attacks made this year bigger than last year for audience everything for info or so
[3:08:58.520 --> 3:09:03.560]  so thank you new world order and they still just don't get it mike sternum it takes over on the other

[3:13:55.160 --> 3:14:01.000]  held history people are saying it was the most promoted by media and journalists they're writing
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:06.840]  about it it's like the biggest story of the day right now and it's pretty amazing actually
[3:14:07.720 --> 3:14:13.000]  eight almost 2,000 comments already so that was why i was a little bit late for my show
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:18.280]  appearance i want to talk to all of you of course but i wanted to do the ama and i hope balance
[3:14:18.280 --> 3:14:25.400]  does one too because what we're doing is we really allow the left to show you know their true colors
[3:14:25.400 --> 3:14:33.480]  and show how unhinged they are by posting over you know thousands of comments tweets articles it's
[3:14:33.480 --> 3:14:40.840]  now like the biggest story of the day but the truth is that why am i the news why is alex jones
[3:14:40.840 --> 3:14:49.160]  the news why won't the media break real stories of consequence like the john cognor story like the
[3:14:49.160 --> 3:14:57.160]  susan rice and masking scandal they are really just gossip boys and gossip girls who don't want to do
[3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:03.720]  real journalism yeah so here's um the new york new york magazine a very prestigious publication
[3:15:03.720 --> 3:15:10.120]  is saying sernovich he's melting down because they think that down voting me right by the way i wore
[3:15:10.120 --> 3:15:15.480]  so my daughter a lot of people asked me what i was wearing the bandana my daughter had a bandana on
[3:15:15.480 --> 3:15:20.680]  and she kind of came in and i thought i'm gonna wear this because i knew that that would meme it so
[3:15:21.400 --> 3:15:26.760]  i knew that if i wore that then it would trigger them and then there would be because this is me
[3:15:26.760 --> 3:15:31.960]  in a suit obviously i could have worn a suit for the ama but i knew if i wore that bandana they would
[3:15:31.960 --> 3:15:38.040]  think oh my god sernovich is melting down you know we really got him good he's so owned we're just you
[3:15:38.040 --> 3:15:44.120]  know he can't handle it he can't take it well that's how you get them talking about this how we
[3:15:44.120 --> 3:15:48.360]  share the message this is what people don't understand about alex is what they don't understand
[3:15:48.360 --> 3:15:52.200]  about me this is what they don't understand about the amazing production work that they do in info
[3:15:52.200 --> 3:15:58.040]  wars that you're listening to right now is you know remember that alex um fidget spinner video
[3:15:58.920 --> 3:16:04.760]  that's the kind of thing that is something for everyone if you hate alex jones you think
[3:16:05.480 --> 3:16:10.840]  what an idiot i can't believe how dummy looks he thinks he's cool this is so stupid i can't
[3:16:10.840 --> 3:16:17.080]  believe it oh my god look at that guy dummy dummy idiot idiot so then they share the video
[3:16:17.080 --> 3:16:22.040]  and then people who like alex go you know i like that alex doesn't take himself seriously
[3:16:22.040 --> 3:16:26.760]  i like that he can just goof off i like that he can just have fun so then those people who like
[3:16:26.760 --> 3:16:31.720]  him share it and so that's what i did with that picture there is i go i'm just gonna wear a big
[3:16:31.720 --> 3:16:37.160]  goofy bandana and the people who like me and you know know how nice i look in a suit are gonna say
[3:16:37.160 --> 3:16:41.640]  oh that's funny you know he took that off his daughter and isn't that goofy he's not afraid to
[3:16:41.640 --> 3:16:47.480]  have a little bit of fun and then the haters are gonna say oh my god he melted down we really got
[3:16:47.480 --> 3:16:52.840]  him good he's so unhinged look at him look at that bandana can't believe it what a freak show and
[3:16:52.840 --> 3:16:59.160]  everything that's how we share a message it's a trojan horse we call it yeah as you remember the
[3:16:59.160 --> 3:17:06.440]  great warriors like achilles right the great trojan horse story was that if you want to get
[3:17:06.440 --> 3:17:13.160]  into the town of the enemy then you can go directly and try to break down the gates
[3:17:14.440 --> 3:17:19.640]  or you can offer a gift you can offer a gift and then so achilles and the great warriors
[3:17:20.440 --> 3:17:25.560]  they went up into the body of a wooden horse and it was left as a gift they even said to the enemy
[3:17:25.560 --> 3:17:32.840]  the greek said to the enemies we are giving you a gift as a surrendering right we will give you
[3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:38.680]  this beautiful horse and then they fled and then the people who are like the mainstream media
[3:17:39.240 --> 3:17:45.400]  are saying we must take this gift into the city and the young people the warriors they said father
[3:17:45.400 --> 3:17:52.040]  no don't hector you know father don't please this is a trap don't allow this in here they said no the
[3:17:52.040 --> 3:17:57.960]  wise men the wise men would be dan rather ted copple remember they brought ted copple back from
[3:17:57.960 --> 3:18:03.480]  a crypt on the megan kelly thing so ted copple and ted kelly i don't even know these people's
[3:18:03.480 --> 3:18:08.760]  names that's how outdated they are they said allow the horse to come in it's a gift it shows that
[3:18:08.760 --> 3:18:13.560]  they've lost and then of course once the horse was in the gates were closed and then while the
[3:18:13.560 --> 3:18:19.240]  people slept slept achilles and the great warriors came out and conquered the city well in this
[3:18:19.240 --> 3:18:26.600]  information war that we're in we are conquering minds of the adversaries because they're going oh
[3:18:26.600 --> 3:18:32.280]  my god look how ridiculous alex jones is with the fidget spinner look how ridiculous alex jones is
[3:18:32.280 --> 3:18:37.720]  with that folk song right remember you know the production team and rob and everybody does the
[3:18:37.720 --> 3:18:43.240]  trade work they go oh look at this video alex looks like a buffoon let we'll share this let's
[3:18:43.240 --> 3:18:49.160]  show everybody this video right let's show this picture of sirnevich with a pink do rag on his
[3:18:49.160 --> 3:18:54.920]  head they're probably you know yeah there's video she sleeps in the same room so the production team
[3:18:54.920 --> 3:19:01.720]  makes these beautiful videos that the enemy shares they don't realize that's a trojan horse
[3:19:01.720 --> 3:19:07.640]  the enemy has now allowed in alex jones in through the gates into the minds of the enemy so now the
[3:19:07.640 --> 3:19:12.200]  enemy right now they're saying look at sirnevich and the do rag they're probably going to say that
[3:19:12.200 --> 3:19:17.640]  it's racist i can predict it right now they're going to go oh sirnevich is wearing a do rag
[3:19:17.640 --> 3:19:24.440]  which is like a stereotype thing probably coded racism it's a coded dog whistle to his followers
[3:19:24.440 --> 3:19:27.640]  that i guarantee that they're going to say that it's another reason i put it on because you know
[3:19:27.640 --> 3:19:34.040]  what they're going to do before they do it but they don't realize that i now have the enemy
[3:19:34.040 --> 3:19:40.120]  bringing me and my message into their city so i didn't have to fight them for that i didn't
[3:19:40.120 --> 3:19:44.680]  have to go with the battering rams and all of my soldiers and try to break down the gate
[3:19:44.680 --> 3:19:51.560]  i just gave them a gift i said here's me wearing a do rag don't i look silly oh my god and then
[3:19:51.560 --> 3:19:56.760]  during the AMA i was like screaming stop the hammering i was throwing around little memes
[3:19:56.760 --> 3:20:00.120]  so now they're going to edit videos of me yelling and saying oh my god look at sirnevich
[3:20:00.120 --> 3:20:05.400]  he's yelling at everybody he's so he's unhinged can you believe this guy and meanwhile shawna
[3:20:05.400 --> 3:20:11.240]  was laying down the whole time just laughing because she knew what was going on so rather than
[3:20:11.240 --> 3:20:17.400]  just batter down the gates which takes so much energy and is a misuse of energy i just give them
[3:20:17.400 --> 3:20:26.680]  a gift i say look at me look at me show me show me how or show your people how badly i've been owned
[3:20:26.680 --> 3:20:31.720]  spread my message every media outlet in the world is going to have to cover this AMA because it's
[3:20:31.720 --> 3:20:37.240]  the biggest story in the world just like that sam cedar story which we're going to talk about jink
[3:20:37.240 --> 3:20:41.800]  in the next segment so we're going to talk about sam cedar jink and all this stuff that they actually

[3:20:48.040 --> 3:20:52.920]  going to a whole segment on this because it's very important in the fake news media doesn't
[3:20:52.920 --> 3:20:59.800]  want to cover this story so we're going to talk about that it all ties in with sam cedar that just
[3:20:59.800 --> 3:21:06.760]  got me introduced to way more people they're saying your own sam cedar and msnbc they owned you
[3:21:06.760 --> 3:21:13.560]  you read at the AMA it owned you oh my god yes you're writing about me spreading my image and my
[3:21:13.560 --> 3:21:20.520]  message to all of your people who would probably never read me or hear about me some of them are
[3:21:20.520 --> 3:21:26.040]  going to laugh but a large percentage are going to say hey that guy looks kind of fun that guy looks
[3:21:26.040 --> 3:21:30.600]  like he doesn't take himself seriously unlike all these fake news people who are you know hi i'm

[3:26:40.760 --> 3:26:47.000]  and we're back mike sernovich uh doing a little bit of reading in real time i'm right now the biggest
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:52.680]  story in the world all because i went on to reddit and did an am a so i'm having a good time i was
[3:26:52.680 --> 3:26:57.720]  reading the articles on break they are saying that i was dunked on they were saying that going and
[3:26:57.720 --> 3:27:04.280]  doing the reddit am a was a complete backfire they're saying that i was owned um one they go one
[3:27:04.280 --> 3:27:10.760]  person asked me aren't you ashamed pro trump conspiracy troll gets hilariously smacked down
[3:27:10.760 --> 3:27:15.960]  this is what i love about the left and this is why we can win as long as you keep up the fight and
[3:27:15.960 --> 3:27:24.040]  you keep supporting the info war and i'll tell you why i have told them my plan in advance alex
[3:27:24.040 --> 3:27:29.800]  and i have told our plans in advance we've told them the story of the trojan horse and how what
[3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:34.840]  we're really doing is the story of a trojan horse by the way some of you watching on youtube live
[3:27:34.840 --> 3:27:38.920]  have noticed and you've you've told me that i have a hair sticking out on the top of my head
[3:27:38.920 --> 3:27:45.880]  and the thing is i'm too busy to get a haircut so i need to get a haircut i know i do but i'm just
[3:27:45.880 --> 3:27:51.720]  too busy to get a haircut because when you're fighting the info war all the time you don't have
[3:27:51.720 --> 3:27:56.360]  time to get a haircut that's just my life maybe you know maybe one day i'll have my own private
[3:27:56.920 --> 3:28:01.720]  salon or something like that but that's why your support is so important and there are some great
[3:28:01.720 --> 3:28:10.040]  specials going on because your support you fund the info wars you fund your own life you improve
[3:28:10.040 --> 3:28:17.000]  your own life everybody wins when you shop at the info war store and go to infowarstore.com
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:23.640]  it's so key that people do this because this is what keeps everything going on and it's a win for
[3:28:23.640 --> 3:28:31.640]  you also so right now we definitely have some big specials for christmas very very big deal
[3:28:31.640 --> 3:28:38.600]  and along with the new product called carnivore so carnivore is an enzyme formula i haven't even
[3:28:38.600 --> 3:28:43.720]  tried it yet it's so new that i haven't even tried it yet but a lot of people have poor digestion
[3:28:43.720 --> 3:28:51.160]  and poor digestive enzymes due to not having a proper diet so when you go from the standard american
[3:28:51.160 --> 3:28:55.480]  or a sad diet it's called to a better diet a lot of times you have issues and that's with these
[3:28:55.480 --> 3:29:01.400]  enzymes and stuff or four and they're great i've taken many different brands of digestive enzymes
[3:29:01.400 --> 3:29:07.480]  very very important very very powerful right now and that's what keeps the info wars going and by the
[3:29:07.480 --> 3:29:14.040]  way people ask how do i have so much energy right all the time i get the well because take care of
[3:29:14.040 --> 3:29:19.880]  myself i take nutritional products i take the protein powders i take the caveman formula i take
[3:29:19.880 --> 3:29:25.080]  the bone broth to function at the level i mean i write last night if you're on my email list you
[3:29:25.080 --> 3:29:31.800]  know that you received an email private list only for now an email for a night of freedom a night
[3:29:31.800 --> 3:29:38.120]  for freedom dot com which is a very special event stefa molyneux is going to be there gabin mckinnis
[3:29:38.120 --> 3:29:43.880]  is going to be there i'm going to be there we're going to do a live podcasting excuse me you can't
[3:29:43.880 --> 3:29:49.560]  even buy tickets yet because it's not even it's not even a public event yet but if you go to a
[3:29:49.560 --> 3:29:56.920]  night for freedom dot com you can see we have a big event plan so last night 11 p.m pacific time
[3:29:56.920 --> 3:30:02.760]  i'm emailing out setting up the event page organizing it booking a venue catering working
[3:30:02.760 --> 3:30:09.800]  with great dj's i wake up i work more do journalism get up do a red a ma now i'm the biggest story in
[3:30:09.800 --> 3:30:14.920]  the world right now get right in here to info wars and that's by the way a lot of you you know because
[3:30:14.920 --> 3:30:20.600]  if you listen and you watch it because that that used to be me when i went into info wars that's
[3:30:20.600 --> 3:30:25.640]  why i always hyped the products i always hyped the products not only because they're good but
[3:30:25.640 --> 3:30:31.320]  because when you see the production team behind the scenes i just come in and show up they have
[3:30:31.320 --> 3:30:36.200]  articles ready videos ready i just show up and like what do you want to talk about i don't even
[3:30:36.200 --> 3:30:40.360]  know what i'm going to talk about that you know probably drives them crazy because i very rarely
[3:30:40.360 --> 3:30:45.480]  send them notes or anything but they're so fast and so responsive and so productive they were
[3:30:45.480 --> 3:30:49.720]  even telling me to fix my hair which i tried to but i used a little bit of coconut oil
[3:30:49.720 --> 3:30:54.520]  for my hair earlier so i think the coconut oil sort of you know coconut oil is great for your
[3:30:54.520 --> 3:30:59.000]  hair by the way but that's the idea is when you take the products and the bone broth and you take
[3:30:59.000 --> 3:31:03.720]  good care of yourself you have energy in fact i have so much energy people accuse me all the time
[3:31:03.720 --> 3:31:09.400]  of drugs which is a joke i haven't even had wine in three or four weeks so shana always gets a kick
[3:31:09.400 --> 3:31:13.960]  out of it like no this is when you feel passion and commitment and know that you're on the side of
[3:31:13.960 --> 3:31:18.520]  truth and you know that you're fighting against the globalist you have all this energy but you
[3:31:18.520 --> 3:31:26.520]  have to take care of body too and of course speaking of the enemy jink alex jones is good friend jink
[3:31:27.640 --> 3:31:34.760]  uh very very bad boy some very very very bad stuff going on some of you may remember you know
[3:31:34.760 --> 3:31:40.760]  jink is promoted by youtube and alex jones is censored by youtube so we can now say that here
[3:31:40.760 --> 3:31:46.520]  is what youtube endorses by the way youtube does allow child abuse content on the website
[3:31:46.520 --> 3:31:53.000]  they allow videos that aren't illegal but they are technically pedo style videos and here is
[3:31:53.000 --> 3:31:57.400]  what they endorse this is i can't even read the whole thing so i don't know what i can show but
[3:31:57.960 --> 3:32:04.440]  he he went on a road trip with a friend of his and his friend said when jink went to get gas
[3:32:05.160 --> 3:32:11.480]  i went and approached some girls that i saw walking by the train tracks they were 14 to 16
[3:32:11.480 --> 3:32:18.440]  they were the w word in training so you can use your imagination that his co-blogger and they
[3:32:18.440 --> 3:32:23.800]  posted this on his blog they referred to you know his co-blogger did and it was on his blog and they
[3:32:23.800 --> 3:32:31.880]  still work together referred to a 14 year old girl as w h fill in the rest in training and he
[3:32:31.880 --> 3:32:38.120]  was hitting on a 14 year old girl so jink goes why never propositioned there's a great line in there
[3:32:38.120 --> 3:32:44.600]  let's read it because i'm a lawyer and i really like to parse things he said i never pro or he
[3:32:44.600 --> 3:32:51.960]  goes we never propositioned underage girls we never propositioned underage girls and i thought man
[3:32:51.960 --> 3:32:58.440]  that is a weird way of putting it you've never propositioned does does that mean they propositioned
[3:32:58.440 --> 3:33:03.560]  you right what if they had propositioned you right the whole thing the whole idea that
[3:33:03.560 --> 3:33:10.360]  well i never pro that is like such a clinton ask it's such a clinton ask answer to this well we
[3:33:10.360 --> 3:33:16.600]  never propositioned ending underage girls wow i can say not only have i never propositioned
[3:33:16.600 --> 3:33:21.320]  but i've never been propositioned and if i had been propositioned i would say please go home
[3:33:21.320 --> 3:33:27.000]  and talk to your family okay please go to your church or your mosque or synagogue please please
[3:33:27.000 --> 3:33:32.280]  don't be walking around the train tracks but this is what they do you know they go on road trips and
[3:33:32.280 --> 3:33:37.160]  and wayward souls you know young girls confused about life maybe they don't have you know maybe
[3:33:37.160 --> 3:33:43.960]  they're from a broken home which by the way does remind me of rutherham that is classic i'm not
[3:33:43.960 --> 3:33:48.520]  saying jink or his friend we're grooming them so i'll be careful with what i'm saying here
[3:33:48.520 --> 3:33:53.800]  because i do believe in only holding people accountable for what they said and not fabricating
[3:33:53.800 --> 3:33:59.160]  things unlike the fake news media but what they would do in rutherham these rape gangs what they
[3:33:59.160 --> 3:34:05.720]  would do is they would go find kind of like wayward souls young girls 1415 and they would
[3:34:06.520 --> 3:34:11.320]  be like maybe seen by their train tracks oh where your parents at oh your parents don't give you
[3:34:11.320 --> 3:34:15.400]  enough attention or maybe your parents are bad or maybe you're poor well how about you know you
[3:34:15.400 --> 3:34:20.520]  ride in a car with me or something this is what they do in rutherham so i'm not saying jink and
[3:34:20.520 --> 3:34:24.920]  his friend i don't know what his friend's name dave or whatever are doing that but when i read that
[3:34:24.920 --> 3:34:31.640]  i want to know why was an adult man who saw girls walking by train tracks why why did he go over
[3:34:31.640 --> 3:34:37.560]  there and talk to him what was his really what was his agenda and doing that right me i'm the opposite
[3:34:37.560 --> 3:34:43.320]  i'm like you kids need to stay over there you know your kids you keep your distance and i said i
[3:34:43.320 --> 3:34:49.880]  wonder why would he do that and then what what kind of person would refer to wayward souls lost
[3:34:49.880 --> 3:34:58.520]  girls as being wh fill in the blank in training well that's the kind of person endorsed by youtube
[3:34:58.520 --> 3:35:06.520]  so my question for youtube and google is why do you censor alex jones why do you censor
[3:35:06.520 --> 3:35:13.400]  mike sernovich they censored my documentary on rape in sweden why do you censor mike sernovich
[3:35:13.400 --> 3:35:20.040]  why do you censor alex jones while endorsing people who are approaching underage girls and
[3:35:20.040 --> 3:35:25.960]  referring to them in very very nasty nasty tones right but but that is the leftist media and that's
[3:35:25.960 --> 3:35:34.040]  why people go it's a conspiracy theory it is not a conspiracy theory to say that people on the left
[3:35:34.040 --> 3:35:40.600]  they want to tear homes down they want broken homes because this makes children vulnerable
[3:35:40.600 --> 3:35:47.400]  and that story that i read i'm holding i'm being very careful here just because i know soros is
[3:35:47.400 --> 3:35:53.640]  trying to really get us framed for something but when i read that i want to know why adult man is
[3:35:53.640 --> 3:35:58.840]  going up to 14 year old girl who's a lost soul and then referring to her as a you know what in
[3:35:58.840 --> 3:36:03.480]  training that isn't okay i don't know why youtube and the liberal media well i do know why they
[3:36:03.480 --> 3:36:11.480]  endorse it i do know why they endorse it we'll talk about that more the next second

[3:40:56.680 --> 3:41:02.600]  um i blame shawna my lovely wife you know she's supposed to make sure that you know maybe i'll
[3:41:02.600 --> 3:41:07.720]  teach her to cut my hair and she'll just clip it up but anyway we're we're back final segment
[3:41:07.720 --> 3:41:13.160]  so much going on in the world and it's very depressing that the fake news media is obsessed
[3:41:13.160 --> 3:41:19.720]  with my reddit AMA right like get a life people as much as i pretend to have a big ego i really
[3:41:19.720 --> 3:41:24.920]  don't the only reason i got into this was to to save america and fight the globalists and to
[3:41:24.920 --> 3:41:32.600]  to speak for all of the people who are attacked by the evil doors in america and i think it's
[3:41:32.600 --> 3:41:37.720]  dumb i think it's dumb that there are now like a hundred journalists tweet over a hundred it's like
[3:41:37.720 --> 3:41:43.080]  thousands tweeting about me and some reddit AMA that i did for two hours goofing off and just
[3:41:43.080 --> 3:41:48.360]  having a good time you know why don't they break stories like john cogners why don't they go after
[3:41:48.360 --> 3:41:53.080]  the bill clinton the rapist why don't they go after the sexual harassment settlements why are they so
[3:41:53.080 --> 3:41:59.080]  obsessed with me well that's because they fear me they fear info wars they fear alex that's because
[3:41:59.080 --> 3:42:06.200]  they fear you because you're the ones who fund the operation you are the ones who keep the operation
[3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:12.200]  going strong and you need to keep your body going strong and that's what's great about alpha power
[3:42:12.200 --> 3:42:19.960]  which is on special again a bunch of specials going in for the holidays and alpha power very
[3:42:19.960 --> 3:42:28.200]  very impressive stuff it has essential nutrients that people need it has what people need especially
[3:42:28.200 --> 3:42:37.160]  men to promote vitality strength focus you know we i hear it all the time from people especially
[3:42:37.160 --> 3:42:43.080]  women that's what i think is funny is you know all these soy boys and male feminists will dig up all
[3:42:43.080 --> 3:42:47.640]  my writing oh my god and they lie about it of course too they're not even honest but when they
[3:42:47.640 --> 3:42:53.960]  share that with women most women are thinking well i mean yeah i wish i wish men were men so the
[3:42:53.960 --> 3:42:59.240]  so the soy boys are the ones well everybody needs this me the whole world because the world is so
[3:42:59.240 --> 3:43:04.840]  poisonous uh the men need it but especially the haters and the male feminists and all the people
[3:43:04.840 --> 3:43:09.320]  on reddit this is the kind of product that they need and your support is so vital and the attacks
[3:43:09.320 --> 3:43:21.320]  on me are just an attack on you and let's compare let's compare me alex info wars paul joseph watson
[3:43:21.320 --> 3:43:26.200]  who by the way i mean you want to talk about crystal crystal clear you know i've done some satire
[3:43:26.200 --> 3:43:32.120]  that maybe i should have done and that it's twisted but let's talk about paul joseph watson
[3:43:32.120 --> 3:43:39.640]  who's attacked by the media versus jink i still want to know why are paul joseph watson's videos
[3:43:39.640 --> 3:43:47.320]  censored but jink and his friend dave who like to drive through small towns and walk around train
[3:43:47.320 --> 3:43:52.680]  tracks you know doing god knows what and the way you know young girls not even women we're talking
[3:43:52.680 --> 3:44:00.120]  14 year olds are being referred to shouldn't they be censored right i mean if you want to if youtube
[3:44:00.120 --> 3:44:07.320]  is going to censor somebody why would they censor paul joseph watson and not censor jink so the
[3:44:07.320 --> 3:44:11.480]  article of course is young turks founder jink apologized thursday after demeaning comments
[3:44:11.480 --> 3:44:19.480]  aimed at women were discovered on an old blog why isn't the media demanding that i mean i'll tell
[3:44:19.480 --> 3:44:27.880]  you right now my reddit am a is a bigger story than jink so go ahead go ahead and tell me why
[3:44:27.880 --> 3:44:33.320]  that is why is it that youtube's golden boy they promote his stuff and even though they promote
[3:44:33.320 --> 3:44:38.280]  it alex jones his stuff is way more successful and paul joseph watson's they had to censor my
[3:44:38.280 --> 3:44:45.000]  channel actually my channel was growing by a thousand subscribers a day and then overnight
[3:44:45.000 --> 3:44:50.360]  i lost a bunch and then ever since then it's like 10 or 15 a day my youtube videos even though i
[3:44:50.360 --> 3:44:57.400]  have 65 000 subscribers only do 500 to a thousand views so youtube they realized that they had to
[3:44:57.400 --> 3:45:04.840]  censor me and attack me because the message is what the people want to hear the message is truth
[3:45:04.840 --> 3:45:12.280]  prosperity the tax cut they had to censor paul joseph watson's they had to censor info wars for
[3:45:12.280 --> 3:45:17.640]  us we're always fighting just for equal rights which by the way in my am a somebody goes why
[3:45:17.640 --> 3:45:23.640]  did you oppose net neutrality well because the same tech companies that want to censor us are the
[3:45:23.640 --> 3:45:29.480]  ones who said we need net neutrality for free and open internet i don't see a free and open
[3:45:29.480 --> 3:45:33.960]  internet the internet doesn't see free and open to me i see my videos getting censored
[3:45:33.960 --> 3:45:40.840]  i see my award-winning documentary on rape in sweden being banned in europe i think about this is
[3:45:40.840 --> 3:45:47.000]  not a joke my documentary on sweden which contained no nudity no foul language and i never even
[3:45:47.000 --> 3:45:52.200]  mentioned muslims it wasn't even a muslim hit piece it was just about sweden and how they're having
[3:45:52.200 --> 3:45:59.480]  a rape problem was age restricted and then they banned it in all of europe it was banned in the
[3:45:59.480 --> 3:46:06.520]  it was banned in the check republic germany so a documentary this is like hitler this is why you
[3:46:06.520 --> 3:46:10.840]  got as you can see this picture if you're if you're reading this on bright part you know you can see
[3:46:10.840 --> 3:46:15.400]  i'm at the white house you know doing journalism reporting everywhere breaking these big stories
[3:46:15.400 --> 3:46:21.560]  so they can't deny that i'm a legitimate journalist and documentary filmmaker so why then is it that
[3:46:21.560 --> 3:46:30.120]  they banned my documentary on rape and i thought they were the feminists if a man or a woman is trying
[3:46:30.120 --> 3:46:36.600]  to help swedish women and trying to help fight against rape culture you would think the left
[3:46:36.600 --> 3:46:41.880]  would be thrilled they would go my god this is amazing they're they're trying to you know join
[3:46:41.880 --> 3:46:48.360]  with us on issues and we should try to fight rape this is amazing instead they ban it in europe
[3:46:48.360 --> 3:46:53.960]  that's what they had they age restricted in the us so by the way age restriction isn't just an r
[3:46:53.960 --> 3:46:59.480]  rating if a video on youtube is age restricted your video will not show up on youtube search
[3:47:00.200 --> 3:47:04.360]  if a person's not logged into his or her account they can't even watch the video
[3:47:04.360 --> 3:47:08.120]  because they have to confirm they're above a certain age you can't make any likes
[3:47:08.120 --> 3:47:14.520]  you can't post any comments you can't share it right so that's that's age age restriction
[3:47:14.520 --> 3:47:20.440]  this is why it's such an orwellian descriptor oh we just age restricted it most people go oh age
[3:47:20.440 --> 3:47:26.440]  restriction it just means you don't want 13 year olds on there no youtube doesn't age restrict his
[3:47:26.440 --> 3:47:32.520]  pedophile videos charlie roosell who you know has been very hard and buzzfeed which has been very
[3:47:32.520 --> 3:47:39.000]  hard and in many cases very unfair at least they did something right and they did report on how youtube
[3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:46.360]  allows child abuse and child exploitation videos on its platform so age restriction doesn't mean
[3:47:46.360 --> 3:47:52.600]  that if you're under 13 you can't watch it because they'll allow children watch abuse videos borderline
[3:47:52.600 --> 3:48:00.440]  snuff films on youtube child kids being kidnapped taped up thrown thrown into garbage dumpsters
[3:48:01.320 --> 3:48:07.880]  syringes being operated on really sick stuff by the way and youtube allows that they don't age
[3:48:07.880 --> 3:48:17.160]  restrict that but if you do a documentary on politics or rape in sweden or paul joseph watson
[3:48:17.160 --> 3:48:25.160]  his video on modern art they tried to censor that just a critique of modern art and come on right
[3:48:25.160 --> 3:48:31.720]  what would you justification for that they will censor you so age restriction doesn't mean oh you
[3:48:31.720 --> 3:48:35.880]  can only watch it if you're over 13 no age restriction means you can't share the link you
[3:48:35.880 --> 3:48:41.480]  can't watch it unless you're signed in and you can't comment on it you can't like it you can't
[3:48:41.480 --> 3:48:46.280]  search for it you can't tell your friends oh my god i watched this amazing documentary on youtube
[3:48:46.280 --> 3:48:53.320]  called invasion by mike sernovich yeah censored by youtube the truth about modern art how how do you
[3:48:53.880 --> 3:48:59.800]  sense it's just a critique on modern art there's no so with with uh the youtube people youtube
[3:48:59.800 --> 3:49:05.080]  does allow jink and they do allow you know child abuse videos so youtube they might go well the
[3:49:05.080 --> 3:49:10.200]  reason we ban sernovich's video in all of europe and the reason we age restricted it and censored
[3:49:10.200 --> 3:49:15.800]  is because he's critical of migrants and that xenophobia i think that's bs because they allow
[3:49:15.800 --> 3:49:20.360]  hatred of swedes and they allow hatred of white people so clearly that's got nothing to do with
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:25.800]  i could at least say well okay i think you're snowballing me i think you're a fraud but okay
[3:49:25.800 --> 3:49:32.280]  that's plausible enough it isn't true it's one of those things where it's a lie but it's a plausible
[3:49:32.280 --> 3:49:41.640]  lie with pjw with paul the greats with paul the greats modern art video what what was he
[3:49:41.640 --> 3:49:48.920]  criticizing he wasn't criticizing any race religion he was just but his video was so powerful and so
[3:49:48.920 --> 3:49:54.680]  poignant that the censors had to shut it down we have cultural censors just like they have in
[3:49:54.680 --> 3:50:01.480]  communist china just like they have the soviet union just like every left-wing culture castro
[3:50:01.480 --> 3:50:10.520]  chay who they celebrate as a hero they have they have cultural critics and cultural censors and
[3:50:10.520 --> 3:50:16.600]  that is now what youtube has become a cultural censorship item and they saw that the paul the
[3:50:16.600 --> 3:50:22.200]  greats video was so compelling they had to censor it they had to shut it down they said no paul you
[3:50:22.200 --> 3:50:30.200]  can't get past the censors but when you share the link you break the algorithm the only way
[3:50:30.200 --> 3:50:36.520]  to break the conditioning the only way to break the algorithm share this link share this video
