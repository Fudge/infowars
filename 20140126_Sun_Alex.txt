[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to Alex Jones
[00:13.000 --> 00:34.000]  My problem isn't what to talk about, my problem isn't trying to find enough to cover, my problem is trying to focus all of the information and try to break it all down
[00:34.000 --> 00:43.000]  It is the 26th day already of January 2014
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  We're going to be here as we are every Sunday live 4-6pm Central
[00:48.000 --> 00:59.000]  Due to all the global warming I was not here Friday because to drive into town when you have an ice sheet on the roads where it only happens every two or three years in the past in Austin
[00:59.000 --> 01:09.000]  The public does not know how to drive on ice, it's kind of like Native Americans coming into contact with smallpox, 90 plus percent would die and only a few percent of Europeans would die from it
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  I liken it to the same thing, it is Crash Up Derby
[01:14.000 --> 01:27.000]  Crash Up Derby everywhere, it froze up Thursday night, I was driving home from work at eight o'clock and went over some overpasses that were frozen black ice and saw cars just smashing and crashing everywhere
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  Because they hit it and feel their car moving, they slam on their brakes and the car turns sideways and crashes
[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  I'm not good on driving on ice like they are in Chicago or places like Minneapolis, St. Paul in Minnesota
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  But I'm better than Austin Ice and all the Californians that have moved here and others who never deal with snow and ice
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  I grew up in Dallas where four or five times a year it would ice up all over the highways and learn how to drive on it
[01:50.000 --> 01:58.000]  But I just was not going to do the death race to come in here Sunday, I mean come in here Friday
[01:58.000 --> 02:06.000]  Because a lot of my crew lives in North Austin, I was not about to have them run the gauntlet of driving 20 miles through road warrior level car crashes
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  I mean every side street, every overpass, they are still fishing cars out of the bushes
[02:12.000 --> 02:22.000]  I was driving over by my parents that live in South Austin yesterday with my kids and there was just smashed cars everywhere
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  And it's an example of how the American people have lived in liberty so long
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  We haven't been perfect but compared to other countries, we were the highest rated for freedom until the last few decades
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  Now we're way down the chart and listed as a tyranny by most major universities, you can look that up
[02:37.000 --> 02:44.000]  But we're not accustomed to tyranny and hardcore corruption running rampant
[02:44.000 --> 02:51.000]  And so it's almost like we don't have an immune system to it and have been taught for decades that no corruption exists in government
[02:51.000 --> 02:58.000]  Corruption is only in the individual, no corruption exists anywhere, there's no secret plans, there's no corrupt groups
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  There's nothing behind Enron doubling and tripling power prices, of course it came out that there was
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.000]  And with Al Gore, they drew up the plan for worldwide robbery called the carbon tax
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.000]  But alas, I digress, I am here and I am live and there is no ice on the roads
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.000]  In fact, it vanished the next afternoon like vampires at high noon
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  When it went up to 65 degrees, it was 70 degrees today
[03:25.000 --> 03:32.000]  And I went for a little swim at the local watering hole at the local Barton Springs area
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  And it was nice to be able to swim a couple laps in the 70 degree broad daylight sun
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  Now, here's the deal, huge broadcasts lined up today
[03:43.000 --> 03:52.000]  When I say I don't feel worthy to bring you this information, there are so many facets, so many angles, I'm just going to try to do the best I can
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  But it is amazing what we're dealing with
[03:55.000 --> 04:03.000]  Obama has launched a chilling purge against political enemies that is red linked on infallwars.com and prismplanet.com
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  I worked on this story yesterday with Paul Watson, he published it this morning
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  No rest for those that don't want to be slaves, I can tell you
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  Why do I work a lot of times at 10 o'clock at night, like I did Friday night putting up a video about the emergency situation
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.000]  Because I can feel the tyrants breath on my neck
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  If you study history folks, this is cancer
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  We know what this is
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  Emergency Obama has launched purge, that ties into Homeland Security Secretary, illegals have right to be citizens
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  Obama will legalize them by dictatorial fiat
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  That ties into huge news on the NSA front
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  Several states considering NSA nullifying bills, NSA also serves as economic interest
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  Giving data to select corporations, Snowden says
[04:51.000 --> 04:58.000]  Told you that many years ago, we just got so much coming up today, you'll want to stay with us on the economic front especially
[04:58.000 --> 05:05.000]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  A practice now banned in nations around the world
[05:09.000 --> 05:13.000]  Guess what else is in the halogen family? Fluoride
[05:13.000 --> 05:21.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, in 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[05:21.000 --> 05:26.000]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record
[05:26.000 --> 05:32.000]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  Bottom line, iodine is important
[05:35.000 --> 05:41.000]  Clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at InfowarsLife.com
[05:46.000 --> 05:51.000]  InfowarsLife Survival Shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies
[05:51.000 --> 05:58.000]  I take it every day, that's InfowarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139
[05:58.000 --> 06:08.000]  Renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas and the Gulf of Tonkin
[06:08.000 --> 06:17.000]  Have today required me to order the military forces of the United States to take action and reply
[06:17.000 --> 06:25.000]  Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of nonviolence in the civil rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee
[06:25.000 --> 06:30.000]  He still has the gun, the gun is pointed at me right at this moment
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  They're going over this moment, break it if you have to
[06:41.000 --> 06:48.000]  People calling themselves members of the weather underground, last night planted bombs in federal office buildings in Washington and Oakland, California
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  They took the babies out of incubators and left their children to die on the cold floor
[06:53.000 --> 07:03.000]  Survivors of the USS Liberty are demanding a congressional investigation into what happened and acknowledgment that the Israeli Air Force bombed a US intelligence Navy ship
[07:03.000 --> 07:09.000]  The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  The Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down a US helicopter
[07:13.000 --> 07:19.000]  More than 30 people were killed and there are reports this morning that most of them are US Navy SEALs
[07:19.000 --> 07:27.000]  There may be a false flag incident where a ship goes down and used for the excuse to accelerate the next war
[07:27.000 --> 07:34.000]  If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between, it's that we all hate that the bank fail out
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.000]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.000]  Today it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.000]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation centers
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up, this isn't a game
[08:02.000 --> 08:08.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones
[08:08.000 --> 08:18.000]  And it is the 26th day of January 2014, I am your host Alex Jones and we're here every Sunday
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  4-6pm Central Standard Time, filling out nationwide, thank you so much for joining us
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  Let me just give you the headlines here
[08:27.000 --> 08:31.000]  Obama launches chilling purge against political enemies
[08:31.000 --> 08:37.000]  That's our top story, we're going to be breaking it down in great detail coming up first here in just a few minutes
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.000]  That ties into Homeland Security Secretary, illegals have earned a right to be citizens
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  That's a quote Bloomberg reports Obama's plan to use executive action triggers criticism
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  It should trigger impeachment
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.000]  Here's the Associated Press, White House warns Obama could go around Congress
[08:52.000 --> 08:59.000]  This is unprecedented tyranny
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.000]  Thank you so much again for joining us on this Sunday Worldwide Edition
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.000]  I am your host Alex Jones, the websites are infowars.com
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  And prisonplanet.com, you can follow us on Twitter at realalexjones
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.000]  So if you just joined us, Obama launches chilling purge against political enemies
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  This is going to be our top story, I cannot even believe how brazen this is
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.000]  And I shot an emergency video on Thursday night when I first learned of this
[09:30.000 --> 09:36.000]  We have a new article out today at infowars.com, Obama launches chilling purge against political enemies
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  Dinesh DeSousa, one of the greatest documentary filmmakers of all time, second highest grossing
[09:42.000 --> 09:49.000]  And of course the former governor of Virginia, McDonald, have both pled not guilty
[09:49.000 --> 09:56.000]  But have been charged literally on stuff that is one, one, ten thousandth what Obama openly does
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.000]  And it's questionable if even an ethics committee would get him in trouble for what they've done
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.000]  I mean it is incredible, and again I'm nonpartisan folks, I was a big critic of Bush
[10:09.000 --> 10:17.000]  If I saw Democrats being persecuted like this, like Nixon was doing, but he was doing, again, one one thousandth on the case of Nixon
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  What Obama's doing, if I saw something like this, I would come out against the Republicans
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.000]  No one is safe when they can persecute a group like this
[10:27.000 --> 10:33.000]  This is how history works, in fact, what's the famous quote by the preacher in England
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  When they came for the workers, I wasn't a worker, when they came for the Socialists, I wasn't a Socialist
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  When they came for the Jews, I wasn't a Socialist
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  You know, when they came for the Catholics, I wasn't a Catholic
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.000]  When they came for me, there was nobody left there to stand up for me, you know, to paraphrase that famous quote
[10:49.000 --> 10:56.000]  That's where all this is going, this is so incredible, I have trouble believing it's even moving this fast
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  So that is coming up, along with Obama announcing he's basically a dictator
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.000]  George Soros is over at the Davos meeting, and Soros and Libs have been meeting with John McCain over there
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.000]  They say cutting off the NSA will imperil, cherish, new deal
[11:12.000 --> 11:19.000]  And it says beware of libertarians bearing gifts, a new way to curb the NSA as a Trojan horse for destroying the new deal
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  That's right, we need to have total lawless spying, or it'll destroy the wonderful communism that's wrecking the country and socialism
[11:25.000 --> 11:32.000]  That the big billionaires are exempt from, why does Warren Buffett lobby tens of millions a year on record
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.000]  Paying for news shows, paying for full page ads, lobbying Congress to raise taxes in the middle class
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  Because he's the biggest recipient of banker bailout money and corporate welfare in the nation
[11:43.000 --> 11:50.000]  The biggest individual person, he got $45 billion in 2008 of bailout money alone
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  His company is $400 billion of it, look it up, it's in a clatchy AP Reuters
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.000]  Just type in Warren Buffett, biggest recipient of bailout
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  And he's the biggest person lobbying, if you make $100,000 a year, folks he wants your money
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  Because he's a disgusting pirate, but he's liberal and hangs out with Obama
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  So it makes it okay
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  And in almost every photo op he eats an ice cream, look I'm a harmless old man
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  Could you walk in a bank with a machine gun and say put all the money in the bag or you're dead but have an ice cream cone
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  And then if you were licking it it would make it okay
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  I think it probably would, if the cops showed up and said come out and they had the bullhorn, come out and we're gonna fire tear gas
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  And you just go ice cream cone and just like in Raiders the Lost Ark the first one
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  When he's running through the jungle and the bad guy gets the idol and holds it up to the natives and they all bow down
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  You just hold up an ice cream cone or hold up a puppy or say you're liberal or call someone racist
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  Or have Obama be supposedly half black and so it's okay
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  He's half black so you gotta let him do whatever he wants
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.000]  I'm not joking about Warren Buffett, type in Warren Buffett into Google click images
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  Most of them are him eating an ice cream cone, hundreds of photos
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  In fact it's worse than that, it's gotta be thousands, I've done a whole report on it two years ago
[13:07.000 --> 13:15.000]  Just showing thousands of the photos, whole screenshots of just full pages of the photos of him with ice cream cones
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  I mean this is a complete joke ladies and gentlemen
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  I'm telling you if Hitler wore a pink uniform and ate ice cream cones constantly
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  We would all be speaking German right now, I'm serious
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  I'm serious folks, that's why they act like liberals in prance around going uh, uh, liberal
[13:30.000 --> 13:39.000]  There's nothing liberal about them, they're savage beasts, savage, rapacious, piratical enemies
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  So that's coming up
[13:41.000 --> 13:47.000]  Also swarms of drones could be next frontier in emergency response, NBC News
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  To watch farmers and others for the environment
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  Oh and guess what, there's been a decade long secret program they're now admitting
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  Oh, remember us being discredited telling you that three years ago?
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  And remember what I told you more than a decade ago?
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  It's in the Washington Post today
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  Here it is, isn't it just sweet?
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  Blimp like surveillance craft set to deploy over Maryland
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  Tighten privacy concerns
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.000]  The Army's gonna launch giant drones to look out for cruise missiles, sure
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  Like the radar wouldn't pick those up
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  This is pure surveillance and they said
[14:21.000 --> 14:27.000]  I first learned of this in 1992 watching Alexander Hague's news hour
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  He had on cable where he said they're gonna have all the telecommunications on blimps
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.000]  And surveil everyone with ground penetrating radar looking through your houses
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  This was on cable in Austin
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  I would get home after I went to the gym at like six o'clock every night
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  And I'd watch C-span or that before I went out with friends
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  You know and play basketball or pool or took the ladies out
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  And I was just into politics and I would watch him
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  Just admit the whole world government came on five nights a week
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  Can look it up
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  In fact, somebody gotta find the archives of those Alexander Hague shows
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  Because it was really good news, he's really evil
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  And he would sit there just for like an hour and talk to a few guests and go
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  Hello, I'm former general Alexander Hague, former head of the National Security Council
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  And we're going to discuss the deployment of blimps over every major city and my company
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  And it was he would just go over it all
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  And then I would tell people that they've had national news stories making fun of me
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  They've had a bunch of them, I think one of them was 2020, one was Nightline
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  It was MSNBC, he thinks they've launched big blimps to watch you
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  Yeah, at 130,000 feet in the edge of space
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  They're flying around watching everybody and I'm sorry, I'm informed
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  I mean, I'm sorry, I know what I'm talking about, okay
[15:33.000 --> 15:38.000]  I mean, I told you 16, 17 years ago the NSA was watching everything you do
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.000]  Mainly for economic data to give it to select corporations to dominate the economy
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  Not for America, by the way
[15:43.000 --> 15:50.000]  By the way, spying by our country is good against economic enemies if they're aggressive towards us
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.000]  But when we do this domestically or to good people, we lose the soft power, we lose our good name
[15:55.000 --> 16:17.000]  And that's happened a long time ago, we'll be right back
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water
[16:34.000 --> 16:45.000]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilic acid
[16:45.000 --> 16:51.000]  The most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands and sodium hexafluorosilicate
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.000]  Get your pro pure with a new pro one filter today at infowarstore.com
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  Or by calling 888-253-3139
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  The facts are in, the studies are legion
[17:02.000 --> 17:09.000]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.000]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  Simple, dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on
[17:18.000 --> 17:24.000]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies

[18:12.000 --> 18:17.000]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply. There's only two ways to avoid this
[18:17.000 --> 18:22.000]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.000]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research
[18:25.000 --> 18:31.000]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  It's made right here in the USA completely non-GMO

[18:59.000 --> 19:02.000]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers
[19:02.000 --> 19:07.000]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse
[19:07.000 --> 19:15.000]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.000]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  These are items that I did research on that I personally use
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.000]  You've got the life straw so you can turn fetted water into safe water anywhere you go
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.000]  The K-Tor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  Strategic relocation third edition by Joel Scousum
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  When disaster strikes by Matthew Stein
[19:40.000 --> 19:45.000]  They're a safe use by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  Hand crank shortwave AMFM radios
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at infowarshop.com
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  And your purchase makes our info war possible

[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  Coast to coast direct from Austin
[20:04.000 --> 20:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[20:11.000 --> 20:13.000]  We are on the march
[20:13.000 --> 20:16.000]  The empire is on the run
[20:16.000 --> 20:21.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[20:21.000 --> 20:27.000]  I'm waiting in my cold cell
[20:27.000 --> 20:33.000]  When the bell begins to chime
[20:33.000 --> 20:39.000]  Reflecting on my past life
[20:39.000 --> 20:45.000]  And it doesn't have much time
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  Because at five o'clock
[20:48.000 --> 20:54.000]  They take me to the gallows pole
[20:54.000 --> 20:57.000]  The sands of time for the republic
[20:57.000 --> 21:04.000]  The sands of time for me are running
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.000]  When the due process goes out the window you can taste everything
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.000]  Prosperity you name it goodbye
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  America thinks liberty is funny in a joke
[21:14.000 --> 21:19.000]  A lot of Americans could care less about due process and our republic
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  Well you're gonna lose everything now
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  Gangster culture everybody acts like thugs and thinks they're cool and tough
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  And it's too lazy to get involved in society
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  Overrun by criminals at every level
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.000]  By the way I mentioned former general Alexander Haig and the blimp plan
[21:33.000 --> 21:38.000]  And the guy's search engine what I talked about August 4th 1997
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.000]  A bid by former secretary of state Alexander M. Haig Jr. and others
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  To build a global communications network with 250 blimps has gotten a boost
[21:47.000 --> 21:51.000]  From federal regulators who have agreed to set aside airwaves
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  That can be used by the ambitious venture
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  This then went black budget folks and has been in the air
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  That I know of at least 15 years
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  And now I'm gonna go with repeated blimps down lower
[22:01.000 --> 22:04.000]  And remember how many times you've heard me talk about this
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  And heard national news say I was insane
[22:07.000 --> 22:10.000]  They had ABC news up in Utah
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  About four years ago say is it a blimp or a UFO
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  And showed the big giant blimps with propellers
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  Over 100,000 feet and said must be a UFO
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  Because there's no secret blimps, there's no NSA
[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  There's no fluoride in the water, there's no GMO in the food
[22:23.000 --> 22:26.000]  And the cancer rates are exploding but that's a good thing
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  And the government loves you and the government cares about you
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.000]  Now let's shift gears into the big news that I was just
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  That I was just mentioning here earlier
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  Let's talk about that
[22:37.000 --> 22:42.000]  Here's the story up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.000]  Right now Obama launches chilling purge against political enemies
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  The political persecution of former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonald
[22:52.000 --> 22:58.000]  And conservative filmmaker Dinesh Desuza for alleged and comparatively minor infractions
[22:58.000 --> 23:03.000]  Are part of an accelerating purge being led by the Obama administration
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  In the run up to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  Throughout history every culture has had maxims in law
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  Denouncing, and banning by the way, the openly corrupt sitting in judgment
[23:16.000 --> 23:21.000]  The Obama Justice Department is openly launching a night of the long knife style purge
[23:21.000 --> 23:27.000]  Up with political enemies that should send chills up the spine of all Americans
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.000]  Now notice the media, the controlled media that won't criticize Benghazi
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  That won't criticize Solyndra, who won't criticize no bid contracts
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  Who won't criticize Obama getting a third of his money from foreign donors
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.000]  Openly illegally and open bundling of tens of millions of dollars
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.000]  And then tiny little fines Obama does stuff literally
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.000]  Literally ten plus thousand times bigger than this
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.000]  On purpose openly and gets, oh you gotta pay one percent of that money back
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.000]  Oh my goodness, oh my, I mean not even a slap on the wrist
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  It's more like rubbing some cream on the wrist or something
[24:01.000 --> 24:07.000]  Okay, I could go on and on and on and on and on and on
[24:07.000 --> 24:11.000]  I mean look at John Corzine, took two billion dollars out of private accounts of banks
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  That his company bought up, he was the former head of Goldman Sachs, former governor of New Jersey
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.000]  But because he was an inside guy at MF Global, he got away with all that
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  Took him years to only pay back a fraction of it
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.000]  And it goes on and on and on, oh and there's gonna be no charges or even an investigation
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  Into the IRS, persecuting the Tea Party, gun owner groups
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  Second amendment organizations, pro-life grips, remember all that
[24:37.000 --> 24:40.000]  And by the way, they're in the news now doing it again
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.000]  Why not? Because if you don't get in trouble, the sky's the limit
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  People go, well this is just politics as usual, both parties attack each other
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  No they don't
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.000]  Look at Tom DeLay for five years persecuted for stuff totally legal
[24:54.000 --> 25:01.000]  And now the local politicians here in Austin and the people involved in that had to step down quietly
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  And then he got part of his name back, but this is the type of stuff they do
[25:05.000 --> 25:10.000]  And that's what I've been told by election lawyers, is that if you are a libertarian or a patriot
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  And are not corrupt, they can find literal white glove inspection garbage on you
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  And send you to prison the way the election laws are written
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  But if you're a wide open gangster who has corporations paying for his houses
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  That he had in other people's names totally illegally from campaign donors in Chicago
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  You know about it all, it goes on and on
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  These are the Clintons that make a thousand dollar investment in cattle futures and you know
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  Get hundreds of thousands back
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  It is wall to wall corruption
[25:37.000 --> 25:41.000]  The Democratic Party is a group of gangsters that use every dirty tactic they can
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  Remember the Democratic Party until the 50s and 60s was the party of the Ku Klux Klan
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.000]  They couldn't beat Republicans and returning veterans and the Republican leader
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  Of course, being Martin Luther King
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  Who was also a pro-gun, you should look that up if you didn't know it
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  That's on record by the way, and so they just shot him of course
[26:02.000 --> 26:07.000]  But the larger in RFK and JFK because they weren't playing along with the old Klan
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  Run Democratic Party as well, like Senator Byrd who just died a few years ago was a grand dragon
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.000]  But that's okay because Arnold Schwarzenegger could be a Nazi and a son of an SS officer
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  As long as he's anti-gun pro open border, it's okay
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  If you're not a Nazi though, they call you one
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  Obama came out last week and said, it's racist, racist
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  That people are criticizing him and he has a low approval rating
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  There's no intellectual debate here, it's just weaponized
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  So the Democrats looked at the demographics and they couldn't win
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  And so they shifted over, Eisenhower really scared him when he left office in 61
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  He was so popular with black people, the Civil Rights Act got passed for Republicans
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  And they flipped out and the memoirs have been written about LBJ and all the rest of them
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  And I'm not going to quote what he said, but you can look it up
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  Just look up what LBJ said about black people and the great society and the rest of it
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  And it was a way to control folks
[26:59.000 --> 27:04.000]  It was a way to get people back on the plantation and they have, big time, big time
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.000]  And they are race baiting all the way and they want to bring in 30 million more illegals on top of the 30 million that are here
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  Who will then do whatever the Democratic Party says and vote illegally on record
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.000]  And get driver's license on record all over the country and vote to take our private property, our guns, everything
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  And the Republican leadership is for it because they're bought and paid for by the same interest
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  But the Democrats are running the show
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  Dinesh DeSousa, an immigrant, an American citizen
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.000]  This movie made $45 million, the second highest grossing documentary ever
[27:34.000 --> 27:37.000]  Despite a controlled dinosaur media blackout
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.000]  Was about unifying all racist colors and creeds around the Bill of Rights Constitution
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  Due process, Bill of Rights, free market
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  He has a new movie coming out called America
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  That's set to be bigger that has the producers and people that were involved in Schindler's List
[27:52.000 --> 28:00.000]  It's got the system really scared that mainline conservatism could reverse the absolute reign of siege
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.000]  In Hollywood that I was talking about Thursday before this broke with former Congress from Bob Barr
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.000]  How it turns out conservatives and libertarians make up a 1500 member secret organization
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  Because they'll be persecuted in Los Angeles and be given no work
[28:14.000 --> 28:20.000]  Take James Woods saying he'll never work again for criticizing tyranny
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000]  Take all these people, take, I mean the Lister Countless
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  It takes so much courage for just a liberty lover
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  Like a Billy Corrigan of Smashing Pumpkins on this show to go public
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  Or Dave Mustaine of Megadeth Countless Others and they get persecuted folks when they do this
[28:37.000 --> 28:45.000]  So now over $20,000 given to his college best friend
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  Something Obama does routinely, he's now been arrested and so has the governor
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  And they've both pled not guilty, I'm gonna break down how big a deal this is
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  And how it's a purge starting when we come back
[28:56.000 --> 29:07.000]  This is all for Hillary to pave the way for her
[29:27.000 --> 29:34.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  That so many other coffees give me personally
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.000]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers

[33:12.000 --> 33:17.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation
[33:17.000 --> 33:22.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[33:22.000 --> 33:35.000]  Nobody writes for free
[33:35.000 --> 33:38.000]  I'm gonna be honest with you, ladies and gentlemen
[33:38.000 --> 33:43.000]  I have been absolutely crazed since I learned this news Thursday night
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  And again, I'm not bragging
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  I want you to know that I'm concerned and I know what I'm talking about
[33:49.000 --> 33:53.000]  I had former Congressman Bob Barron, who's in the lead
[33:53.000 --> 33:56.000]  Running for his district that goes into Atlanta
[33:56.000 --> 34:00.000]  He is like Ron Paul, he's like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.000]  He's the guy that first exposed the NSA back in the mid-90s, former CIA
[34:06.000 --> 34:10.000]  High-level operative and controller
[34:10.000 --> 34:14.000]  And he basically concurs with my analysis of what we're facing
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.000]  Is a takeover by corporate interests that are not free market using the government
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  To use the American system and empire to take over the world while we go bankrupt
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.000]  We're being used up like rocket boosters on the space shuttle
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  And I don't like that
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  Number one, I don't like being part of an immoral operation
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  Number two, I really don't like it destroying the country
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  And believe me, we're being destroyed, ladies and gentlemen
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  And I am literally angry right now
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  I have not felt like this since I was 18 years old
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  The guys were just witnessing during the break
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.000]  I am seriously in absolute battle mode right now
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  And I'm telling you, something big is about to happen
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  I've been telling you for months, ladies and gentlemen, I got a bad feeling
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  It's all this stuff happening, but there's something else
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  I think it's going to be a false flag, a staged terror attack
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  Blamed on libertarians and conservatives
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  And I think they're going to go for everything
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  Because the collectivists, the criminals, the communists, the socialists
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  The people that control that, the corporate interests
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  That are authoritarian and basically criminal in nature
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  Not free market, they're anti-renaissance
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.000]  All their white paper say they need giant catalyzing terror attacks
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  To be able to take over domestically
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  And we've quoted those in the Financial Times of London, you name it
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  And now they know the pendulum worldwide
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  Is swinging against collectivism and against socialism
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  And against all these gangs that these big city corrupt systems create
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  So they're basically cornered rats right now
[35:43.000 --> 35:47.000]  And that's why, if I was Robbie the Robot, I'd be saying
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  Danger Will Robinson, because we're winning right now
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.000]  But the enemy has a lot of tools up their sleeve
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  They can see us peacefully, politically, winning
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  On the fake global warming and the carbon taxes
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.000]  On the open borders, on the restrictions on the Second Amendment
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  On trying to launch wars in Syria to be al-Qaeda's air force
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  And these corporate interests using the Pentagon and NATO
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  As a system to stir stuff up
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.000]  Mainline libertarians and Republicans are now saying
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.000]  Look, we can't start wars just so defense contractors can make money
[36:19.000 --> 36:24.000]  There's an awakening that we need to salvage the Republic
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  And even salvage the empire, what's left of it
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  So that the world doesn't ascend into chaos
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  With the Chai comms running things
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.000]  I mean, this is serious, ladies and gentlemen
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  We can't just cut off the empire today
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  Stuff will really blow up
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  It's got to be phased out immediately
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  We do not want this thing to come crashing down like the Soviet Union
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  As most analysts think it will
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  Because we're going to be left with all the homeland security wreckage
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.000]  And all these bureaucracies that are going to literally eat us alive
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  When they don't have the world to feed on
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  Oh, Katiebar, the door
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  We've already been the blood supply to grow these
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  Metastasizing globalist tumors
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  In our name, in the American Empire's name
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  As they dissolve the old Republic
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  And I try to come in here and be calm
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  But man, I am just absolutely on edge right now
[37:13.000 --> 37:14.000]  Absolutely on edge
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.000]  I mean, let me just read you some of these headlines
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.000]  I mean, Dinesh D'Souza is a more danged, you know, theologian
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  No criminal record, top of his class
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  Standard bundling is to get all your friends to give to somebody
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  And a lot of the friends work for him
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.000]  Yeah, the guy is a big filmmaker and best-selling author
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  And it's standard procedure
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  The Democrats have been caught by the Veritas Project
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.000]  Project Veritas in Battleground, Texas
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  Other places on Tape Sing
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.000]  Yeah, we vote hundreds of times
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  Yeah, we, you know, we register the illegals to vote
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  Yeah, we bundle money to give
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  No one gets in trouble
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  But then Dinesh D'Souza goes
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  And in one case, because it's his best friend from college
[38:01.000 --> 38:06.000]  Raises her $20,000 off five donors
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  That's what you do in campaign operations
[38:08.000 --> 38:09.000]  That's standard
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  They tried to put Tom DeLay in jail for it
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  They were unable to
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  What do you think the PACs do?
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  What do you think George Soros giving hundreds of millions a year
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  Or Bloomberg giving hundreds of millions a year to anti-gun causes
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  I said he spent $50 million of his own money
[38:22.000 --> 38:23.000]  That was in his first campaign
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  The next campaign, I looked it up, over $90 million
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  Show people how much did Bloomberg spend on campaign
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.000]  I think it was $92 million
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  The point is, they can do all this
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  But you can't give $20,000
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  Or somebody trying to beat the Democrat
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  That was taking Hillary Clinton's seat
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  I mean, I looked up the Virginia governor
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  And the stuff he did is maybe an ethics concern
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  That is standard procedure
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.000]  That on the governor's amount of money you can't live
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  And they went and had some guy that wanted him to pitch his supplements
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  Because the governor was a sports enthusiast
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.000]  And he said, yeah, I'll pitch
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.000]  I'll tell folks how much you like your supplements
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  That's standard endorsement
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  And sure, a governor probably shouldn't be doing it
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  But all these Democratic governors do it
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  And they don't get in trouble because it's a gray area
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  And I'm an anti-corruption guy, but let me tell you something
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  You don't put somebody in jail for jaywalking
[39:09.000 --> 39:16.000]  And then let, you know, somebody like Jeffrey Dahmer go free
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  Or Mr. Helter Skelter himself
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  You don't do that
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  You don't let Charles Manson walk free
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  While sending somebody to the Hooskow
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  Because they got caught smoking cigarettes out behind the barn
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  I mean, that's basically what this is
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  DeSousa didn't do anything
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  The governor was so paranoid when good guys started doing bad things
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  He incriminated himself by thinking it was bad
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  If you believe the Democratic Party operative chef
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  Which I don't
[39:42.000 --> 39:43.000]  I mean, let me tell you, I'm in the media
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  And I'm a libertarian patriot
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  I have experienced lying
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  You wouldn't believe by operatives, folks
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  I mean, we let Democratic Party operatives in this office before
[39:52.000 --> 39:53.000]  Not knowing they were operatives
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.000]  And they ran off and make stuff up
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  That's why we have surveillance cameras inside
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  Thank God
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  I mean, you would not believe the stuff people make up
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  So I know what this is like
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  And let me tell you, if you're a patriot
[40:03.000 --> 40:04.000]  And you've got domestic help
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  You better watch your butt
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  They will make stuff up
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  People are forced to sign nondisclosures
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  Not so they don't expose the bad stuff you're doing
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  So they don't use the fact that you let them into your life
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  To then go make stuff up
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  And project on to that relationship
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  Whatever lies they want
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  That's how scum gets ahead in the world
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  And the governor has pled not guilty
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  Vanessa Sousa's pled not guilty
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  Now, why are they both so important?
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  Well, number one, he was the main front-runner
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  Against Hillary
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  Notice who the other big front-runner was
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  Chris Christie, who cozied up to Obama
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  Didn't matter, they're calling it as big as Watergate
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  Over that bridge
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  And of course, Christie's a thug and a pig
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  And an open-border anti-gun trash
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  Compared to Hillary, he's an angel cake
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  He's being destroyed
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  This other governor, McDonald, really good guy
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  Compared to these Democratic operatives
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  I mean, he's about as clean as you're going to get at that level
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  Alright?
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  Then you've got, uh, Vanessa Sousa
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  Completely clean his whole life
[41:03.000 --> 41:06.000]  Tried to get his best friend from college into the Senate
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  And did standard procedure that is openly legal
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  When Democrats do it
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  I mean, folks, a third, look it up
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  A third, a third
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  Of Obama's money came from foreign IP addresses
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  And there was no investigation
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  By the attorney general who covered up
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.000]  Fast and furious he ran
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  Even though he got caught lying-shipping guns to Mexico
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  To one of the Second Amendment salandra
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  I mean, the list just goes on and on
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  I mean, they're protecting John Corzine
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  They're protecting the IRS, persecuting people
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  I mean, listen, Nixon had to step down
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  And the impeachment began
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.000]  Over 120-something people on the list, folks
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.000]  They targeted Fox News, the Associated Press
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  It came out in the news four years ago
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  I am on the White House Enemies list
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  Then it came out later that I indeed am
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  And let me tell you, it's fun
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  Having the bureaucrats show up here every few weeks
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  I just tell them, fly it out
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  You know, you go ahead and try to dig something up
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  I've done nothing knowing when they never find anything
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.000]  But let me just tell you, this country is screwed
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  FBI, ATF, state police, secret service
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.000]  They've all been here over and over again
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  Okay?
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  With white gloves, ladies and gentlemen
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  I never even talk about this on air
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  I know what scum these people are
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  I know who they are
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  They are criminal mafia running the Justice Department
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  And if you don't think that's scary, you're fools
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  And a lot of you out there are like, well, I better shut up
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  No, no, no
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  The answer to this type of bullying is to stand up to them
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  You better be scared of them winning
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  And nobody's standing up to them
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  The truth is, they're doing all this because they're scared
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  Because Dinesh DeSousa, those two governors
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.000]  Could have wrought down Hillary
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  And they're not that they're perfect
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.000]  And now Dinesh DeSousa, whose film's coming out
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.000]  In the summer on July 4th to deprogram the left
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.000]  Out of their race-baiting garbage
[42:57.000 --> 43:26.000]  Oh man, they're trying to stop the production right now
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  By giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs

[44:00.000 --> 44:04.000]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[44:04.000 --> 44:07.000]  And replaced with the halogen bromine
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  A practice now banned in nations around the world
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.000]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[44:13.000 --> 44:14.000]  Fluoride
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.000]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[44:19.000 --> 44:22.000]  To encourage salt producers to add iodine
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.000]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  And the results are on record
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  In areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  Bottom line, iodine is important
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  Unbound, clean
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.000]  In a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family

[46:02.000 --> 46:07.000]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse
[46:07.000 --> 46:12.000]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  Until they acquiesce to the global takeover
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items

[46:59.000 --> 47:04.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation
[47:25.000 --> 47:30.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network

[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  Infowars.com
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  And you've got to understand
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.000]  It's not just a filmmaker with no criminal record
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  Who, I looked at the campaign laws
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.000]  They might get him, if they can prove that
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  He lied to the FBI
[47:54.000 --> 47:57.000]  But they can't get him over the donations
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  And then Obama does stuff thousands of times worse
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  And doesn't get in trouble
[48:01.000 --> 48:02.000]  That doesn't hold water
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  This is Obama's Justice Department
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  We now learned for a year
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  Behind the scenes harassing
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  Dinesh DeSousa
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  Who's met with him a whole bunch of times
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  And they're probably taking one statement he made
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  And claiming it was not true
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  I mean, I had the FBI calling up here
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  Right before Obama deception came out
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.000]  In March of 2009
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  Obama had been in office two months
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  They were calling different employees
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  Asking about the Obama deception
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  From the San Francisco field office
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  And then they showed up here with a subpoena
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  Claiming it was about somebody
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  Making threatening comments on the internet
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  But it was really a phishing expedition
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  And I told them that
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  And they came here with an Austin cop
[48:44.000 --> 48:45.000]  Who brought them
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  And again, the average FBI person
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.000]  They're never bad
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  They're really not
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  And they're just hearing boys to try to find something
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  And I said, look, I'm not talking to you
[48:54.000 --> 48:55.000]  I've done nothing wrong
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  I don't know what you're trying to get me to say
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  You're not even saying why you're really here
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  Get what you're here with a subpoena
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  And get out of here
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  And that's how it works
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  What do you say to the police?
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  Nothing
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  What's the second thing you say to the police?
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  Nothing
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  What's the third thing you say?
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.000]  Nothing
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.000]  What's the fourth thing?
[49:14.000 --> 49:15.000]  Nothing
[49:15.000 --> 49:16.000]  What's the fifth thing?
[49:16.000 --> 49:17.000]  Nothing
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.000]  What's the sixth thing?
[49:18.000 --> 49:19.000]  Nothing
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  Up one side and down the other
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  I'm done talking to the government
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  I'm done
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.000]  The cop was running through my yard
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  Saying, you see a guy run through here
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  Yeah, right there
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  But that's a beat cop
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  I'm not talking to anybody
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  So you could talk to me one month and a month later
[49:36.000 --> 49:37.000]  And my memory's a little different
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  And you twist it and charge me
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  That's what they're doing to Dinesh De Souza
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  Who made the second highest grossing documentary ever
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  About bringing the left and right together
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  together around free market, around the Bill of Rights and Constitution, selling minorities
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.440]  who are really the majority on being part of the American dream and showing them statistically
[49:56.440 --> 50:01.080]  that socialism, collectivism creates a living hell.
[50:01.080 --> 50:02.600]  That's why that film was so wholesome.
[50:02.600 --> 50:07.360]  That's why I had Dinesh D'Souza on multiple times to promote his film.
[50:07.360 --> 50:10.960]  By the way, I've gotten so busy with the new website designs that were almost got done
[50:10.960 --> 50:15.080]  in the new studio and a bunch of TV stuff and a bunch of upgrades that, you know, I just
[50:15.080 --> 50:18.840]  keep getting behind on Obama Deception 2 and I was going to put it out late last year.
[50:18.840 --> 50:19.840]  I'm still adding to it.
[50:19.840 --> 50:21.320]  The stuff keeps happening.
[50:21.320 --> 50:22.320]  Now is time.
[50:22.320 --> 50:24.640]  I'm going to put it out.
[50:24.640 --> 50:29.320]  I'm going to speak at Oxford in the middle of March as well, but we'll try to shoot for
[50:29.320 --> 50:36.080]  late March, maybe April, I don't know, to really chronicle and the film is about, I've been
[50:36.080 --> 50:39.600]  making it for two years, that if we don't impeach Obama, he will try to set the precedent
[50:39.600 --> 50:43.400]  for dictatorship in America and we'll start persecuting his political enemies openly by
[50:43.400 --> 50:44.400]  arresting them.
[50:44.400 --> 50:49.680]  Instead of the IRS harasses people and the NSA harasses the Associated Press and Fox News
[50:49.680 --> 50:52.960]  and I'm on an enemy's list and Matt Rudd's on an enemy's list and Will Nendale is on
[50:52.960 --> 50:59.840]  an enemy's list and, you know, I get followed by cars and I get death-threaded by people
[50:59.840 --> 51:00.840]  that are listening to the phone.
[51:00.840 --> 51:03.880]  This hasn't happened in a while, but it's happened under Obama's watch where they let
[51:03.880 --> 51:06.800]  you know they've been listening and it's like, wow, you really are a coward.
[51:06.800 --> 51:08.560]  You really want to live in the Soviet Union.
[51:08.560 --> 51:10.840]  You really want to live in North Korea.
[51:10.840 --> 51:13.080]  That's how real it is.
[51:13.080 --> 51:17.260]  And people better just get this through their head, that now that they've gotten away with
[51:17.260 --> 51:19.360]  all this, next they're going to go for everything.
[51:19.360 --> 51:23.000]  And if people put up with it, I mean the Republican leadership said two weeks ago, you know what?
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.640]  You decide to do what the NSA that's openly illegal.
[51:25.640 --> 51:29.080]  And you decide to do what you want to know, Obamacare, because the Republican leadership
[51:29.080 --> 51:31.800]  helped write it and it's fighting the Tea Party.
[51:31.800 --> 51:36.440]  And you decide what to do on the power plants and you decide what to do on the open borders
[51:36.440 --> 51:41.080]  and you decide, you decide here, we'll just, he's told Congress, you legalize the 30 million
[51:41.080 --> 51:45.320]  illegals, they say it's 11 in the news, it's 30, including aggravated felons.
[51:45.320 --> 51:46.680]  Or I'll just do it on my own.
[51:46.680 --> 51:51.280]  He already legalized several million illegals last year.
[51:51.280 --> 51:52.280]  Totally illegally.
[51:52.280 --> 51:53.280]  I'm going to explain this again.
[51:53.280 --> 51:57.440]  The president is an executive who executes what the board of directors, the Congress
[51:57.440 --> 51:58.440]  tells them.
[51:58.440 --> 52:06.080]  And the referees are the courts or the president's the quarterback commanding the troops and
[52:06.080 --> 52:10.040]  then you've got the referees that are the courts and then you've got the coaches and
[52:10.040 --> 52:12.120]  the coaching staff of the Congress.
[52:12.120 --> 52:13.640]  And they call the shots, folks.
[52:13.640 --> 52:14.720]  That's the Constitution.
[52:14.720 --> 52:15.720]  Go read it.
[52:15.720 --> 52:17.120]  First it's, oh, it's co-equal.
[52:17.120 --> 52:18.520]  It was never co-equal.
[52:18.520 --> 52:20.360]  Congress is in charge.
[52:20.360 --> 52:21.720]  Go read the founding papers.
[52:21.720 --> 52:23.320]  Go read the Federalist Papers.
[52:23.320 --> 52:27.480]  It's Congress, the courts, then El Presidente, because you want to keep a president on a
[52:27.480 --> 52:31.720]  very short leash, ladies and gentlemen, because every other country they saw presidents or
[52:31.720 --> 52:35.320]  new prime ministers try to become dictators.
[52:35.320 --> 52:38.600]  And whether you think they were good or they were bad, you would get a lot of people who
[52:38.600 --> 52:46.360]  just tried to set themselves up as king again, like Oliver Cromwell, Lord High Protector.
[52:46.360 --> 52:50.080]  And the point is, is that people end up just getting Lord High Protector, whether you think
[52:50.080 --> 52:53.120]  they're good or bad, whether you think Napoleon Bonaparte was good or bad.
[52:53.120 --> 52:56.520]  The point is, the man on the white horse comes, Napoleon wrote a white horse.
[52:56.520 --> 52:59.840]  That's why you hear that saying, and we're here again.
[52:59.840 --> 53:00.840]  You understand that?
[53:00.840 --> 53:04.200]  I mean, look at the news today.
[53:04.200 --> 53:05.920]  I've got news coming up in the next hour.
[53:05.920 --> 53:14.480]  I haven't even hit you, where I told you Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase,
[53:14.480 --> 53:18.920]  HSBC, they're all announcing you're not going to be able to get cash out.
[53:18.920 --> 53:21.320]  They're all announcing they're not going to let you deposit cash.
[53:21.320 --> 53:23.840]  They're all announcing they're not going to let you do foreign wire transfers.
[53:23.840 --> 53:25.080]  That has a name.
[53:25.080 --> 53:28.360]  It's called, wait for it, currency controls.
[53:28.360 --> 53:31.520]  And if you're a new listener or you're somebody that plays the stock market and you think
[53:31.520 --> 53:35.880]  you're real savvy and you're not, folks, every switch they throw to bringing a tyranny
[53:35.880 --> 53:37.920]  they're flipping the last ones.
[53:37.920 --> 53:40.200]  Hundreds of switches have been thrown.
[53:40.200 --> 53:41.200]  Everything is prepared.
[53:41.200 --> 53:47.680]  BBC reports HSBC imposes restrictions on large cash withdrawals.
[53:47.680 --> 53:49.640]  We're talking $3,000.
[53:49.640 --> 53:54.160]  And BBC went in and confirmed, you go in and try to get $10,000, they go, no, $5,000,
[53:54.160 --> 53:56.800]  they go, no, $3,000, okay, maybe.
[53:56.800 --> 54:03.080]  And they say, we want to know where you're spending it, as if cash is illegal.
[54:03.080 --> 54:07.440]  This is after-tax cash in the bank, they're saying you can't get out.
[54:07.440 --> 54:10.920]  And the police have been taught all over the U.S. that if you're caught with $1,000,
[54:10.920 --> 54:11.920]  it's illegal.
[54:11.920 --> 54:15.640]  How many squad car videos are on YouTube where they go, you got $1,000 in here, where'd
[54:15.640 --> 54:16.640]  you get that?
[54:16.640 --> 54:21.080]  I'm going to test this and if I find drugs, they know almost all money has drugs on it.
[54:21.080 --> 54:24.880]  And then they use that with some kangaroo judge, let's see if we can get us a verdict
[54:24.880 --> 54:26.120]  in here.
[54:26.120 --> 54:28.760]  We're going to take the car too.
[54:28.760 --> 54:33.160]  You in New Mexico, that was the case last year, you're not going to let us keep your
[54:33.160 --> 54:38.280]  cash, we're going to keep you in solitary confinement without trial, too, yeah.
[54:38.280 --> 54:44.080]  I mean, you really want to turn loose every thug to be a criminal in a uniform or behind
[54:44.080 --> 54:46.080]  a judge's station.
[54:46.080 --> 54:49.960]  And I'm not saying all the judges are bad, I'm not saying all the police are bad.
[54:49.960 --> 54:53.280]  You better stand up, you better speak out, you better be the light in the world because
[54:53.280 --> 54:55.160]  this isn't a joke.
[54:55.160 --> 54:58.440]  And again, the good news is I hear talk radio, I don't care if it's the biggest conservative
[54:58.440 --> 55:02.320]  host in this country, the biggest libertarians, the local host I listen to every week that
[55:02.320 --> 55:05.840]  do a really good job on 590 AM, Sergeant Sam.
[55:05.840 --> 55:11.400]  And of course, people like Mark Caesar, I'm just mentioning a local group.
[55:11.400 --> 55:17.080]  I mean, even the liberal on the show, who's on with those Clemens is now backing off freaking
[55:17.080 --> 55:18.080]  out.
[55:18.080 --> 55:22.280]  Yes, you're supposed to freak, I listen to local San Antonio, local Dallas, local Houston,
[55:22.280 --> 55:23.480]  they're all starting to freak out.
[55:23.480 --> 55:27.160]  I go on Democrat shows, I'm seeing in radio and Dallas, they're freaking out.
[55:27.160 --> 55:31.120]  I go on, you name it folks, people, this is real.
[55:31.120 --> 55:34.760]  This is real, okay?
[55:34.760 --> 55:35.760]  Charity comes in lots of outfits.
[55:35.760 --> 55:39.320]  It doesn't come like Joe Stalin and Hitler 60, 70 years later.
[55:39.320 --> 55:42.400]  It comes through high tech bureaucracy and Barack Obama.
[55:42.400 --> 55:46.800]  Look at these headlines, Obama launches purge against political enemies.
[55:46.800 --> 55:50.160]  So huge, there's the video and we have the clip of Bob Barr, we're going to play in the
[55:50.160 --> 55:56.600]  next hour where he was on Thursday, six hours before the Dinesh D'Souza situation broke.
[55:56.600 --> 56:00.440]  I had already been told by sources that they're preparing hundreds of indictments against talk
[56:00.440 --> 56:05.640]  show host, film makers, you name it, that's why I was freaking out and I told him, it's
[56:05.640 --> 56:08.680]  a 30 minute interview or 40 minute interview, we're going to play a short clip where he
[56:08.680 --> 56:09.680]  talks about impeachment.
[56:09.680 --> 56:14.360]  I said, you have a lot of courage, they could blow your airplane up and off air, he said
[56:14.360 --> 56:17.440]  I was right, non air, he basically agreed with it.
[56:17.440 --> 56:20.800]  But that's coming up a short clip of that in the next hour, but it's red linked in the
[56:20.800 --> 56:29.400]  article, uponinfowars.com, Obama launches chilling purge against political enemies.
[56:29.400 --> 56:34.400]  We're going to have to do what Ted Cruz did two weeks ago where he said, Obama is dangerous
[56:34.400 --> 56:36.760]  and frightening and is becoming a dictator.
[56:36.760 --> 56:41.240]  You got to call it like it is or they normalize the takeover and then Katie bar the door.
[56:41.240 --> 56:47.720]  Oh look, here's the news today, Dovetailing with Ours, Bloomberg, D'Souza pleads not
[56:47.720 --> 56:53.320]  guilty to U.S. campaign donor violations, Governor pleads not guilty, they're totally
[56:53.320 --> 56:54.320]  not guilty.
[56:54.320 --> 56:57.880]  Now let's move on here, Homeland Security Secretary, illegals have earned right to
[56:57.880 --> 57:03.240]  be citizens, will legalize them all by fiat, Bloomberg, Obama's plan to use executive action
[57:03.240 --> 57:08.480]  triggers criticism, it should trigger arrest, White House warns Obama could go around Congress,
[57:08.480 --> 57:12.120]  AP, they're just testing to see if we'll go along with it, Obama, anyone out there who's
[57:12.120 --> 57:15.720]  ever been assaulted, I've got your back, I'm going to talk about that in the next hour,
[57:15.720 --> 57:20.040]  House Republicans offer broad immigration plan, caving into Obama because the same people
[57:20.040 --> 57:24.360]  pay him off, but the Tea Party won't sell out to the Republican and Democratic leadership
[57:24.360 --> 57:28.280]  are on record, pooling all their money with the big national associations and all the
[57:28.280 --> 57:30.520]  fake Republican groups to gut them.
[57:30.520 --> 57:35.040]  And once the Tea Party falls, folks, they are going to loot everything and economically
[57:35.040 --> 57:36.640]  bankrupt us for control.
[57:36.640 --> 57:40.200]  If you want to save your future, your pension funds and your children, now's the time to
[57:40.200 --> 57:45.400]  act, this isn't coming in the future, it's happening now, a military takeover of America
[57:45.400 --> 57:50.200]  run by foreigners that hate our God's second hour coming up.
[57:50.200 --> 57:54.200]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[57:54.200 --> 57:59.320]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[57:59.320 --> 58:03.360]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[58:03.360 --> 58:07.720]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[58:07.720 --> 58:13.040]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[58:13.040 --> 58:19.440]  Over and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[58:19.440 --> 58:23.960]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and
[58:23.960 --> 58:26.680]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[58:26.680 --> 58:30.880]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[58:30.880 --> 58:33.720]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[58:33.720 --> 58:37.920]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed
[58:37.920 --> 58:41.480]  available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[58:41.480 --> 58:46.440]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[58:46.440 --> 58:50.120]  my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[58:50.120 --> 58:55.400]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with
[58:55.400 --> 59:00.720]  the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[59:00.720 --> 59:02.840]  Guess what else is in a halogen family?
[59:02.840 --> 59:03.840]  Fluoride.
[59:03.840 --> 59:08.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here in 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[59:08.840 --> 59:12.280]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[59:12.280 --> 59:18.160]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented
[59:18.160 --> 59:23.680]  a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[59:23.680 --> 59:29.840]  Bottom line, iodine is important, unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine
[59:29.840 --> 59:32.360]  was the answer for myself and my family.
[59:32.360 --> 59:37.840]  You will find survival shield nascent iodine exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.
[59:37.840 --> 59:42.640]  InfowarsLife survival shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[59:42.640 --> 59:44.120]  I take it every day.
[59:44.120 --> 59:51.160]  That's infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[59:51.160 --> 59:54.920]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[59:54.920 --> 1:00:02.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:08.720]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:00:08.720 --> 1:00:17.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:28.200]  Well Obama's defense of the NSA's constant surveillance of all Americans just reached
[1:00:28.200 --> 1:00:33.520]  a new level of uncertainty when he compared them to Paul Revere.
[1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:37.360]  After blatantly lying, even they realize they don't have any credibility.
[1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:42.720]  We're putting out mindless propaganda is what some of us feel that we're putting out and
[1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:45.160]  that what the American people feel that we're putting out.
[1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:47.240]  What's a tyrant to do?
[1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:51.080]  Well you could pull in some corporate billionaires who work hand in glove with the NSA.
[1:00:51.080 --> 1:00:52.480]  I'm sure that would help.
[1:00:52.480 --> 1:00:59.440]  So it's not as though government surveillance is absolutely bad in all cases.
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:07.960]  Is it done in a way that people trust that the normal privacy concerns are being adhered
[1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:08.960]  to?
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:11.920]  It's interesting that Gates would be talking about trust.
[1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:16.640]  Microsoft was the first company to partner with the NSA on violating your trust and spying
[1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:20.560]  on you without reason and without a warrant.
[1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:24.040]  That companies want you to trust them with your data and the government wants you to
[1:01:24.040 --> 1:01:28.680]  give your data to a third party like Microsoft so they can get that data without a search
[1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:29.680]  warrant.
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:35.840]  They merely ask companies like Microsoft and Microsoft eagerly turns over all of your information.
[1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:38.840]  But it's not just Gates with soothing words for the public.
[1:01:38.840 --> 1:01:43.880]  Mark Andreessen, Netscape founder, now venture capitalist, took to Twitter this week to defend
[1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:44.880]  the NSA.
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:49.160]  And government cheerleaders in the press were relieved that finally someone had the guts
[1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:51.000]  to defend the NSA.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:56.040]  Andreessen tweeted, I increasingly feel like we're on some gigantic collective fainting
[1:01:56.040 --> 1:01:57.040]  couch.
[1:01:57.040 --> 1:02:01.600]  Oh my word, I can't believe that spy agencies spy.
[1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:06.320]  In the US, we all collectively hired tens of thousands of our fellow citizens and gave
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:11.480]  them $75 billion a year with a mission to spy on our behalf.
[1:02:11.480 --> 1:02:13.880]  Do you notice the subtle lie here?
[1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:16.800]  It's not that the NSA is spying on our behalf.
[1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:20.120]  It's that they're spying on us illegally.
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:23.320]  It completely loses the context of FISA.
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:28.520]  The F stands for foreign and it was created because we learned in the 70s during the Church
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:33.400]  Commission that spy agencies weren't just spying, they were engaged in all kinds of criminal
[1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:34.800]  activity as well.
[1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:39.920]  The purpose of FISA was to restrict the CIA and the NSA from spying domestically.
[1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:44.160]  But Andreessen tries to confuse the issue further by saying, to suddenly turn on them
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:50.400]  and blanket accuse them of comprehensive illegality and moral horrors is unfair to them and it
[1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:52.400]  lets us off the hook.
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:57.520]  Is it unfair to accuse the NSA of comprehensive illegality when they lie to Congress, when
[1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:04.080]  they violate FISA and the Constitution and spy on all Americans without a search warrant?
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:07.440]  Andreessen has been trying to cover for the NSA from the very beginning of the Snowden
[1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:12.280]  Leaks, trying to muddy the waters by claiming that the NSA critics are too stupid to understand
[1:03:12.280 --> 1:03:14.280]  the technology involved.
[1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:18.160]  American citizens as well as non-American citizens direct access, no oversight, no court order,
[1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:19.160]  these very sweeping claims.
[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:23.400]  And the things that are frustrating from my perspective is the sort of issue of technology
[1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:28.320]  in our society and the internet in our society is a central issue and to talk about it you
[1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:30.280]  actually have to, people have to understand the technology.
[1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:33.760]  People have to actually be willing to understand the technology and the original reporting simply
[1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:35.360]  did not understand the technology.
[1:03:35.360 --> 1:03:41.200]  Andreessen saying critics simply don't understand technology couldn't be a bigger lie.
[1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:46.480]  Well NSA whistleblowers told us about illegal surveillance 12 years ago.
[1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:51.200]  William Binney who had worked for the NSA for over 30 years, who was the global technical
[1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:55.280]  director for the NSA, knew exactly what the NSA was doing.
[1:03:55.280 --> 1:04:00.120]  Then when I found out they were starting to do the spying on everybody in the United States
[1:04:00.120 --> 1:04:03.480]  I felt I had to get out of there because I couldn't be a party to that.
[1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:08.560]  I would be an accessory to subverting the Constitution, which incidentally in my view
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:14.200]  that's what everybody's doing, including the judge who just ruled that it isn't that awful.
[1:04:14.200 --> 1:04:19.920]  Binney resigned because he understood the technology and did not want to become a criminal.
[1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:23.440]  Andreessen wants to muddy the waters with technology issues and say the public doesn't
[1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:27.840]  understand the mission, that NSA employees don't understand the legal constraints and
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:33.080]  he tweeted that we have a simplified cartoon version of an evil NSA.
[1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:39.240]  Well former NSA technical director William Binney tells us it's not simplistic or cartoon,
[1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:44.480]  but the same techniques that he witnessed in the Toletarian societies for decades.
[1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:49.400]  That's what I've been seeing from the beginning, only because I had all my experience.
[1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:54.480]  Alright folks, that full report's up at prisonplanet.tv and infowarsnews.com.
[1:04:54.480 --> 1:04:58.240]  More banks are now shutting down their ATMs, this is just down breaking.
[1:04:58.240 --> 1:05:01.720]  Stay with us, we're going to look at why does the United States spend the largest percentage
[1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:03.920]  of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:07.000]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:12.560]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:16.120]  It all comes down to one thing, we are what we eat.
[1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:20.800]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:25.040]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:27.600]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[1:05:27.600 --> 1:05:32.480]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:33.800]  desperately needs.
[1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:39.560]  To learn more visit infowarshealth.com, the site is literally packed with audio and video

[1:05:47.680 --> 1:05:49.920]  machine of your sick, tired, and obese.

[1:05:58.680 --> 1:06:12.200]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[1:06:12.200 --> 1:06:17.000]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:21.840]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown
[1:06:21.840 --> 1:06:27.520]  Dallas, the first reports to say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the
[1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:28.520]  shooting.
[1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:32.520]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:42.640]  It was almost as if we were planned in motion, it's just pancake.
[1:06:42.640 --> 1:07:03.760]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands
[1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:09.640]  of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:17.360]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an
[1:07:17.360 --> 1:07:18.360]  American city.
[1:07:18.360 --> 1:07:22.600]  Global governance at last, is it one world, the central bank was in charge, but aren't
[1:07:22.600 --> 1:07:25.920]  we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:32.120]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[1:07:32.120 --> 1:07:38.840]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:44.360]  So I began the broadcast at the start of the last hour, warning you that HSBC and a whole
[1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:48.840]  bunch of other banks are now telling people they can't take out more than $2,000, $3,000,
[1:07:48.840 --> 1:07:53.680]  $4,000 at a time, and are saying that they're going to file suspicious transaction reports
[1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:56.560]  on people that do.
[1:07:56.560 --> 1:08:02.680]  And they've already had a whole bunch of different cases, as you know last year with
[1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:09.720]  bail ins, where as much as 45% of every person's bank account, except insiders in places like
[1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:18.800]  Cyprus, have their money taken out and given to hedge fund owner Mafia bosses that literally
[1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:21.160]  engineered the collapse of the country.
[1:08:21.160 --> 1:08:24.120]  And in the case of Cyprus, they didn't even say the money was owed or there was any type
[1:08:24.120 --> 1:08:26.080]  of paper connection.
[1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:30.600]  This is beyond selling derivatives into the market of the same mortgage a hundred times
[1:08:30.600 --> 1:08:31.600]  or more.
[1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:33.520]  This is beyond credit default swaps.
[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:40.640]  This is just open thieving with paramilitary government in control with banks in control
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:46.080]  of the government saying either give us unlimited bailout money or we will implode your country.
[1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:50.280]  Give us $40 plus trillion in the U.S. alone that's been given to mainly offshore and
[1:08:50.280 --> 1:08:55.960]  foreign banks since 2008, or we're too big to fail and we'll bring you down.
[1:08:55.960 --> 1:09:00.420]  And then we're told this is our debt and we've got to pay it for generations, the average
[1:09:00.420 --> 1:09:07.320]  person born the year Obama got into office 2009 owes a million $300,000 the congressional
[1:09:07.320 --> 1:09:09.920]  budget office came out last week.
[1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:15.440]  Just in six years, those six year olds owe a million plus dollars and folks when they're
[1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:20.000]  done, it's going to be a billion dollars apiece because we're going to be like the Weimar
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:25.480]  Republic in Germany that brought Hitler to power where you needed wheelbarrows to buy
[1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:31.000]  a loaf of bread where you'd come in to buy dinner and you'd want to pay up front because
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.840]  your meal might be twice as much in two hours.
[1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:35.000]  That happened.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.800]  That's happening in Zimbabwe right now.
[1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:39.720]  This is what happens when criminals run things.
[1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:41.600]  They don't just not mismanage things.
[1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:46.440]  They want you poor, but first they've got to have a paramilitary force in place.
[1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:49.320]  First they've got to have police that believe demonstrating is illegal.
[1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:52.400]  First they've got to have a system where you can be disappeared under the National Defense
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:56.240]  Authorization Act and torture school and they've got to have a system where they can
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:58.840]  stage terror attacks and blame it on domestic groups.
[1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:02.600]  Remember, I told you years ago, we broke this, that they were shifting from saying gun owners
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:08.080]  were the main threat, moving it over to just people who were Tea Party folks, period, that
[1:10:08.080 --> 1:10:09.080]  you're some type of terrorist.
[1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:12.680]  And before that, it was Al Qaeda, then gun owners, then returning veterans.
[1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:17.840]  And then now it's, oh, domestic groups on land security say they're about to attack.
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:21.880]  This is in mainstream news that every police department is told, you will be attacked by
[1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:23.400]  the Tea Party and veterans.
[1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:26.640]  They will use IEDs on you, they will bomb you.
[1:10:26.640 --> 1:10:31.700]  So you need these giant armored Iraq trucks to prepare for war and it's all over the
[1:10:31.700 --> 1:10:38.440]  Army times, it's all over stars and stripes, they're normalizing it like it's no big deal.
[1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:45.000]  And here it is, first HSBC halts large withdrawals, now Lloyd's ATM stop working, that's Zero
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:51.400]  Hedge reporting on Sky News, that's Fox News in England breaking right now.
[1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:57.160]  UK wide, this is up on infowars.com as well, you go to drudgerport.com, they have it right
[1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:00.080]  on the right hand side, the HSBC article.
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:03.760]  Now I told you years ago they were getting ready for this before it started, and why
[1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:04.800]  is that?
[1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:09.680]  These criminals like to have the law changed or regulation changed, then they have a bunch
[1:11:09.680 --> 1:11:15.080]  of boards internationally sign off on it, so that when it all ends up happening, they
[1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:19.480]  can blame it on thousands of bureaucrats and no one can be held accountable.
[1:11:19.480 --> 1:11:21.600]  You understand?
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:26.880]  I mean I watch these people, this is what I do, I know how they operate.
[1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:30.560]  And what I love the fact is that Chris Jordan comes in now, he knows when something's big
[1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:33.840]  on the news to print me old articles so I already have it, he put together a folder
[1:11:33.840 --> 1:11:40.360]  just of five or six articles last year, or two years saying get ready for them to charge
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:43.920]  you to have money in the bank and charge you to use your debit card or credit card.
[1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:47.320]  I don't care if you have a hundred million dollars in the bank, your money's worthless
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:51.680]  because the globalists can get all the fiat digits they want, zeros and ones.
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:55.720]  The economy isn't about creating value and bringing value to the table, it's not about
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:12:01.000]  being honorable and building a better society and businesses and companies and lawyers and
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:05.720]  people that are honorable get more popular and those that aren't get run out of business.
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:10.640]  Honorable police get supported and so they can do the right thing.
[1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:15.000]  Well you don't take control of the situation, you get bad police in, they run out the good
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.320]  cops, you get tyranny and this has now happened.
[1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:23.520]  I'm going to open the phones up here in a moment but here it is, Sky News, Lloyd's banking
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:28.200]  group says problems affecting cash machines and debit cards have been resolved, isn't
[1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:29.200]  that nice?
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:33.760]  It's a pseudo attempt at capital controls and what they do is they test it, they send
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:38.920]  letters to their customers and people backlash and they stop but they're conditioning you,
[1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:40.520]  this is a military tactic.
[1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:45.160]  Before they invaded Panama, I'm no fan of Manuel Noriega in the late 80s but he was
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:50.640]  a CIA operative trafficking narcotics and he stopped paying his cut, that's been declassified
[1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:57.360]  so they had that big invasion claiming that they were saving three women that were at
[1:12:57.360 --> 1:13:00.760]  a college that were American citizens, when they got saved it's in the Panama Deception
[1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:04.800]  film they go, no one ever held his houses, this isn't even true.
[1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:10.040]  But the point is that for a month before they invaded they had US military do drills who
[1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:14.880]  were already invited into the country of landing helicopters taking off, doing shooting drills,
[1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:25.040]  dropping grenades, until when they actually invaded the Panamanian military stood down
[1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:27.360]  thinking it was just another drill.
[1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:32.920]  Meanwhile, all of this is going on, now the Grammys are going to have gay weddings headed
[1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:38.920]  on TV just shoving sexual propaganda in everyone's faces, children's cartoons, you name it and
[1:13:38.920 --> 1:13:42.280]  it's not because they're even liberal and want equality for, quote, gay people, they
[1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:47.320]  want to end the family as we know it, they want to absolutely break the back of society,
[1:13:47.320 --> 1:13:56.400]  that's why you see in sitcoms and dramas attacks now on standard nuclear families and because
[1:13:56.400 --> 1:14:01.880]  they have to replace the general bill of rights and constitution that we all had with special
[1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:05.920]  rights, oh we have new bathrooms for five-year-olds that think they're a boy, a girl, or maybe
[1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:06.920]  an animal.
[1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:12.760]  So we have to legalize bestiality now, it's for the children, oh we have to teach five-year-olds
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:19.600]  about daddy having a husband or whatever so that people are so concerned and obsessed
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:24.360]  with all that that meanwhile total tyranny is coming in and you're going to be charged
[1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:27.160]  to use your debit card no matter what you do and everything you do is going to be tracked
[1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:31.840]  and controlled and they use the NSA actuaries on record to be able to predict the future
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:38.080]  in mass and individual movements almost 100% of the time now, 93% six years ago, Amazon
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:42.240]  says it's 100% of the time, do you hear me, they can now predict and have your package
[1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:47.320]  packaging and shipping before you order it, how your mouse goes over things, what you
[1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:51.960]  bought in the past, your habits, these are war-gamed algorithms, the internet is actually
[1:14:51.960 --> 1:14:56.640]  a giant interface with computers to teach the computers how to be artificially intelligent.
[1:14:56.640 --> 1:15:04.080]  I told you this over a decade ago, it's now mainstream, interfacing with predictive analytics
[1:15:04.080 --> 1:15:08.400]  but it's not just to know what you want, they can then steer you and test propaganda and
[1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:14.520]  see what works, this is the end of free will and once they have this in place, the robots
[1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:18.920]  are coming in to replace this, replace the military, everything, you're not going to
[1:15:18.920 --> 1:15:24.640]  have to wait 100 years for Elysium folks, 10 years, 15 years, they're already reporting
[1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:28.120]  in 2014 that most people are going to lose their jobs at robots, what are you going
[1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:31.960]  to buy stuff from the robot factories with, we'll see you're going to get a government
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:36.400]  stipend or a government job minding other people, they have to take over the economy
[1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:41.560]  shut it down so you will go into their controlled economy, their socially engineered economy
[1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:46.080]  and can only work through their system because they control you with money, it's called
[1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:51.440]  slavery, total social engineering, 800, when we come back I'll give you the number because
[1:15:51.440 --> 1:16:00.320]  of the weekend numbers different, it's 877-789-ALIX, 877-789-2539, this is a technocratic takeover.
[1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:05.240]  The facts are in, the studies are legion, sodium fluoride and other toxic members of
[1:16:05.240 --> 1:16:10.160]  the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people,
[1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:16.480]  so why are the social engineers adding it to the water, simple dumb down the host population
[1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:21.280]  that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on, we may not have been able to get fluoride
[1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:25.840]  out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies, I am extremely

[1:18:03.960 --> 1:18:09.520]  for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse, the globalist model is
[1:18:09.520 --> 1:18:15.200]  to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover,

[1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:10.760]  and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world, guess
[1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:16.640]  what else is in the halogen family, fluoride, ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here, in 1924
[1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:22.160]  the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine,
[1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:28.000]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:34.720]  a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine, bottom line iodine
[1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:41.120]  is important, unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself

[1:20:01.200 --> 1:20:08.240]  coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[1:20:08.240 --> 1:20:22.720]  It's always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must
[1:20:22.720 --> 1:20:27.440]  mean that we're running up our debt, raising the debt ceiling which has been done over 100
[1:20:27.440 --> 1:20:34.960]  times does not increase our debt, it does not somehow promote profligacy, all it does is it
[1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:38.880]  sets, you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up Congress.
[1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:47.120]  Tolls remember to join us on any of the topics I've raised, the cash withdrawals, being restricted,
[1:20:51.120 --> 1:20:59.280]  all of it, I'd like to hear what you have to say on that front, what do you think about it 877-789
[1:20:59.280 --> 1:21:06.800]  Alex 877-789-2539, what do you think of the open purging and it's not just Dinesh D'Souza
[1:21:06.800 --> 1:21:12.400]  and the former governor of Virginia for crooked toenails while basically Obama's roasting children
[1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:18.000]  in the White House lawn comparatively, it is announcing we'll do whatever we want executively,
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:22.400]  we'll take your guns via executive, we'll open the borders up via executive order,
[1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:26.960]  we'll control Obamacare that we got passed selectively, we'll decide what you've got to
[1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:32.800]  follow and what you don't on the case by case, that's how royalty and communist dictators like
[1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:37.600]  Kim Jong-un control people because they've got laws but they're all selectively enforced,
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:42.880]  Katie bar the door, you are listening to the Alex Jones show broadcasting worldwide,
[1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:49.120]  only I can introduce myself by cutting off and interrupting the liner that we are live on this
[1:21:49.120 --> 1:21:55.040]  Sunday edition, I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m. central, but the globalists
[1:21:55.040 --> 1:22:00.560]  have committed so many incredible crimes they're going for broke and they have an agenda, a program
[1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:06.880]  of social control called cloward and piven and agenda 21 that is basically just modern forms
[1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:12.160]  of feudalism and serfdom to make you poor so they can politically control you, I don't know how
[1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:17.200]  many times I got to explain that and I know most of you understand that but we got to get the word
[1:22:17.200 --> 1:22:22.720]  out about this and we got a Bob Barcliffe I want to play coming up in a moment and then we'll also

[1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:03.200]  it's okay it's those of you that criticize the system you're the ones causing the problem when
[1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:07.840]  we first reported that people said we were lying for about a week and then the mainstream news had
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:13.600]  to admit they are charging a five dollar fee and then there was a backlash and so they had to back
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:17.360]  off of it but then they came out and said well we'll just do it when all the big banks do it so

[1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:29.920]  be even worse and then they conquer us through economic fraud not through military takeover
[1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:34.240]  but then if you get uppity and don't like to take over well then a paramilitary comes after you
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:39.200]  but most people have jobs in the system it's already that way but it's really going to be
[1:34:39.200 --> 1:34:43.680]  like that soon well hey don't get in the way of the system that's the only job we got this is how

[1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:10.640]  our money is being used by all these special interests to build a cage for this country
[1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:17.600]  and it's very very saddening let's go ahead and go to bob bar thursday six hours before the
[1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:24.320]  dinesh desuza filmmaker indictments by eric holder undoubtedly for interviewing his obama's
[1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:29.360]  estranged brother undoubtedly for exposing on the democratic party race baits undoubtedly for
[1:35:29.360 --> 1:35:34.400]  making a nice friendly wholesome film to bring america together the party of the coup clux klan
[1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:39.280]  the democrats is not going to allow that they killed martin luther king because he would
[1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:43.360]  just shut up about how the republicans were good and passed the civil rights act and they'll do
[1:35:43.360 --> 1:35:48.800]  whatever they have to now they've moved from white racism to minority racism and that's what they sell
[1:35:48.800 --> 1:35:52.240]  and you're not going to have a minority like dinesh desuza sell unity
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:35:59.040]  and i talked to bob bar about how they might blow his airplane up if he gets back into congress
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:03.200]  which he's in the in the lead right now he's the type of guy that'll be afraid you know he
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:08.320]  wins this year and then he could run for president i mean they're scared folks if you think rand paul's
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:15.120]  a rock star or ted cruise bob bar's even better spoken he could be presidential i told him on
[1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:19.600]  air and off air you better watch out you've got incredible courage thursday and then came the
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:28.160]  indictments of desuza that night here it is alex uh i was uh i was with some folks just recently
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:35.280]  and i pulled out him pulled out of a filing office the the house resolution the house resolution
[1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:44.000]  that i introduced on november 5th of 1997 that was the very first official inquiry of impeachment
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:51.440]  filed against bill clinton uh and that was mine and at the time i think i had 18 cosponsors was
[1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:59.680]  all in in november of 1997 and what i did is i took that took that document uh figuratively
[1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:05.280]  kind of dusted it off uh added a little bit of language to it and darned if it doesn't sound
[1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:11.440]  pretty good with barack obama's name in there oh man so i think it's safe to say if you get back
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:17.600]  in congress the evidence is already there you're going to start looking into the inquiry uh to
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:22.960]  begin uh getting the cosponsors for indicting the president in the house and i guess he'll be
[1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:29.280]  tried in the senate i i think it really has come to that now it's not something i like to say when
[1:37:29.280 --> 1:37:35.120]  i left the house before after they after we impeached uh clinton uh you know my hope was
[1:37:35.120 --> 1:37:41.120]  we would never have to go through that process again but we do mr president you are not above
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:47.520]  the law you cannot ignore the law you cannot simply violate the law violate the constitution
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:52.960]  because from a policy standpoint you deem it appropriate to do so we don't operate that way
[1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:57.680]  in america and you are not going to be permitted any longer to do that well listen we need to get

[1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:49.200]  intelligence and your inspiration uh you've allowed me to wake up several a couple dozen people
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:53.440]  with the insight that you've been able to give us so i really appreciate well thank you i just
[1:40:53.440 --> 1:40:57.840]  want to say this before i forget we got it in pete obama to protect ourselves i mean i think he's
[1:40:57.840 --> 1:41:01.920]  he may go for actual dictator and not leave i wasn't saying that before that's what i meant to
[1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:05.440]  say and i apologize for interrupting i just keep forgetting to say that it looks like they think
[1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:09.360]  they can go for broke and it looks like the republicans may give them the power we've got to begin
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:14.160]  the impeachment trial in the house that could bring obama down all the corruption coming out sorry go
[1:41:14.160 --> 1:41:19.920]  ahead no agree completely i think now is make or break uh for us in and for obama so i have two
[1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:24.560]  quick questions for you and then i'll let you respond to them one is you had a guest uh on the
[1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:29.360]  show a couple years ago by the name of benjamin polford who's talking about this uh concept of
[1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:34.480]  white dragon society which is supposedly these white hats we're trying to fight the no no he works
[1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:39.040]  for forbs he does get david rockefeller interviews he's a real guy and just because he's hanging out
[1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:42.320]  i'm not saying he's a bad guy but he's hanging out with the chinese mafia just because our
[1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:47.040]  government's a mafia doesn't mean the russian or the chinese mafia is good there's this human trait
[1:41:47.040 --> 1:41:51.200]  where just because our system's bad it doesn't mean the other guys are good either you see what i'm
[1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:56.640]  saying yeah that is part of the concern it's like he is in one evil taking over the other i mean
[1:41:56.640 --> 1:42:02.640]  what he puts out every monday on his website sounds very compelling but uh again he has
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:07.520]  it just saw me is it like the two black hats fighting one another as opposed to white hats
[1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:11.920]  exactly we need to get full for dawn guys get full for back on i don't think he's a bad guy he
[1:42:11.920 --> 1:42:18.320]  does meet with the japanese and chinese mafia that run those countries uh and i just you know i
[1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:23.760]  don't they're just as bad the thing is the globalists are here running my life that's why
[1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:29.120]  they're problem number one i agree so the last thing i ask you about is like before it's news
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:33.760]  has uh put out something about uh false flag at the super bowl and just want to see what your
[1:42:33.760 --> 1:42:38.000]  thought they all yeah that's a very disreputable site my opinion uh it just constantly puts out
[1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:42.640]  you know just i mean i could say a meteor is going to kill us next week and get 10 million extra
[1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:46.880]  viewers and listeners but then it would discredit me after that so i'm not going to sit there and
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:50.400]  i don't want to be the you know like the you know the truth tester here where people call me like
[1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:54.720]  i'm the food taster and i tell you whether it's good or not uh just figure out the track record

[1:47:46.960 --> 1:47:52.320]  stuff bush did but i mean that that isn't this is nothing the entire republic is being erased
[1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:56.880]  and you democrats better know when they put in some republican puppet these foreign interests
[1:47:56.880 --> 1:48:04.080]  tady bar the door as well and i'll be critical of that but i don't even see that happening now i
[1:48:04.080 --> 1:48:08.240]  mean more and more i've said men maybe obama continues to be worse than i thought it would be

[1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:21.280]  and at the huffington post in places and the boldness of these scallywags is just it's something to
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:27.520]  to witness and and you look at china a journalist activist who mildly criticized the government
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:32.800]  was just sentenced to four years we can put that up on screen for tv viewers a prominent chinese
[1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:38.000]  activist sentenced to four years in prison cnn well i mean here they just trump up some campaign
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:45.120]  thing or claim he did something wrong while they openly engage in incredible crimes that's all the
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:49.040]  elite have to have is a bunch of guys in uniforms to come take you away and they're trying to face
[1:48:49.040 --> 1:48:56.480]  that in i mean it's happening and i look at how sad and weak the average man is out there acting
[1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:02.080]  tough men now think it's cool to be like gangster ish and thuggish and into corruption they're the
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:06.160]  opposite of knights they're the opposite of honorable people and i'm more and more studying
[1:49:06.160 --> 1:49:11.360]  history and art types realize it is the archetype of the night that is going to save us because
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:15.040]  if people discover the fact that being honorable and standing against evil is what you're designed
[1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:20.480]  to do it's so addicting if you get somebody to do it a couple times it's over the journey towards
[1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:28.000]  the light side will be complete not the dark side man liberty creates a cornucopia tyranny
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:32.880]  creates a living hell i didn't get to a lot of the news i want to jam in as many calls as possible
[1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:37.760]  right now but i mean look at these articles look look at fox news gun fights smith and wesson

[1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:51.520]  with regulations they're passing regulations all over the country at state level bankrupting
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:55.360]  selling in that state i mean they're just doing it by fiat why not the president's a dictator

[1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:54.160]  got folks get real i reached a handful of people i've talked to people i talked to a guy in the
[1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:58.800]  military that knows about you he's got a prison planet dot com across this pickup i had a conversation
[1:50:58.800 --> 1:51:03.040]  with him alex the military is waking up i was about to say the only people awake with military
[1:51:03.040 --> 1:51:06.640]  you know i want to bash the cops because they've been taken over by the feds they're more awake than
[1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:12.880]  the public i mean the cops are more awake compared to the public public the public is the problem
[1:51:12.880 --> 1:51:18.640]  look in the mirror folks you've let this happen go ahead absolutely absolutely and i tell you what i
[1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:24.160]  wanted to mention something too i saw a train go by today and it had these 20 foot containers on a
[1:51:24.160 --> 1:51:29.760]  flat car said explosives u.s army i wonder what in those and what's the plan and they got the
[1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:33.360]  military running around domestically like the chickens with their heads cut off and that's
[1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:38.000]  why the military is waking up chris because they know they're being trained to literally take on
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:42.320]  guys in john dear hats and the training missions they're training to go after hank williams jr
[1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:46.800]  anybody who's independent and people that aren't gonna bow to what's coming and they know the good
[1:51:46.800 --> 1:51:52.320]  old boys aren't going to go out offensively they're going to hunt us down just like the green beret
[1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:56.800]  infiltrator of the weatherman got the documents and got them convicted they talked in those meetings
[1:51:56.800 --> 1:52:02.320]  how they're going to kill 25 to 50 million americans when they take over that's that's the goal well i
[1:52:02.320 --> 1:52:08.800]  got news for heirs and all of them you better when all this goes down buddy you better get your butt

[1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:32.560]  animating as a man is to commit yourself doing the right thing and you don't care about yourself
[1:52:32.560 --> 1:52:37.840]  you care about victory over evil that doesn't mean i'm on some high horse either we got pure evil
[1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:44.800]  running rampant all over the place you people are in grave danger don't you see it's all happening

[1:53:06.640 --> 1:53:12.960]  anyway uh my question is how many foreign troops do you think are in this country at least 200 000
[1:53:12.960 --> 1:53:17.840]  they've mainlined them all and it's in the Denver post they trained to fight militias they got russian
[1:53:17.840 --> 1:53:24.800]  german dutch french british uh australian it's unbelievable it's like 1776 with the hessians
[1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:31.040]  landing i got you and that's probably going to be the enemy that we have to fight well they're
[1:53:31.040 --> 1:53:34.320]  gonna they're gonna have a civil war with the cops and military with us first and yeah then
[1:53:34.320 --> 1:53:40.880]  they're going to send those guys in to call the police and military right and when they unleash
[1:53:40.880 --> 1:53:47.600]  those people uh maybe maybe then people will wake up no the average man will go down it was like a
[1:53:47.600 --> 1:53:50.880]  football game and they announced their foreign helpers and will actually would actually give
[1:53:50.880 --> 1:53:55.200]  their wife to them if they wanted them i the average man out there would literally watch as foreign
[1:53:55.200 --> 1:53:58.960]  troops raped their wife and slit their kids' throats and they would thank them for it that's
[1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:03.040]  how cowardly they are as long as they could watch the football game i really but a lot of people
[1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:08.400]  aren't going to stand down that's and that's why we're listed as the enemy yeah well maybe they'll
[1:54:08.400 --> 1:54:14.240]  have the super bowl in the FEMA camp so people will have something to do well what i mean listen
[1:54:14.240 --> 1:54:18.320]  a hundred to one price earnings ratios in the big companies well i mean what's what's gonna
[1:54:18.320 --> 1:54:22.560]  happen with that bubble what do you think of all these banks shutting down getting money out all
[1:54:22.560 --> 1:54:29.920]  of the world it's it's just a sign of what's coming uh they're they're they're conditioned us
[1:54:29.920 --> 1:54:39.280]  as we speak every day and uh do you think there's any chance that uh they'll double cross bill and
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:46.160]  Hillary and run Moshe uh run Michelle Obama is our oh yeah they could do anything all these nasty
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:50.400]  puppets it doesn't matter which one they put in but but i mean here's the deal the military said no
[1:54:50.400 --> 1:54:55.760]  to aiding al Qaeda in Syria and Egypt and that's why Obama had to back down that's why he just purged
[1:54:55.760 --> 1:55:01.200]  300 top officers the last two months the entire nuclear command force including the guys that
[1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:05.520]  launched the missiles the officers i mean they've called from the top generals down it's a coup
[1:55:05.520 --> 1:55:11.120]  folks i don't know what to do i mean i know more than the average folks at you know in the war
[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:16.000]  college because they practiced a conventional warfare i've studied political takeovers but

[1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:09.120]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:15.600]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:22.320]  results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously
[1:58:22.320 --> 1:58:29.040]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base

[2:00:06.960 --> 2:00:17.120]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:00:18.480 --> 2:00:23.920]  we saw the enemy coming a long time ago they were warned by jill scowlsons uncle clion scowlson
[2:00:23.920 --> 2:00:33.280]  by ron paul people like the presidential candidate very goldwater countless others
[2:00:34.320 --> 2:00:40.080]  but now we're toe-to-toe with the main enemy the top takeover their biggest attack ever
[2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:47.280]  and it's just if people knew we could beat it if they knew what they were facing if they knew
[2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:54.960]  this wasn't theatrics if they knew how real it is how evil it is and the enemy knows people
[2:00:54.960 --> 2:00:57.760]  are starting to wake up that's why they're coming down on us because they're all going to go to
[2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:03.600]  prison and it doesn't mean that the whole world's going to be perfect once we beat this wave of
[2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:11.600]  evil that's the cycle but if we win they all go to prison if we end a real golden age of humanity
[2:01:11.600 --> 2:01:17.360]  can begin but if we don't win we don't get that hundred year reprieve like none of us
[2:01:19.360 --> 2:01:24.880]  it's all going to happen very very quickly this is a takeover and i've tried to deny my lying eyes
[2:01:24.880 --> 2:01:30.720]  my lying brain everything i've looked at it's like uh child role in the dark tower came
[2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:36.320]  where he first starts out and the calls him the hoary cripple points it's really him as an old man
[2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:40.640]  towards there's the path of the dark tower there's the truth it's like no it's not that bad you lie
[2:01:40.640 --> 2:01:44.640]  you lie in every word you look at me to see how the lie will affect me but it wasn't a lie
[2:01:45.360 --> 2:01:47.040]  i wish every day it was a lie
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:56.800]  oh i'm sorry andrew in illinois then uh tony
[2:01:56.800 --> 2:02:00.640]  vince kim max and julio that's all i got time for go ahead andrew thanks for holding go ahead

[2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:10.640]  jerry coursey but when i'm talking about the the purge reminds me of the movie that came out a cameo
[2:02:10.640 --> 2:02:20.480]  face of the movie poster it'd be great to add up 200 generals fired and uh the banks being changed
[2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:27.280]  around with the uh all also going currently you know to do that with the backdrop of the movie
[2:02:27.280 --> 2:02:35.440]  poster that'd be kind of neat and and and what's your main pointer question i mean that's interesting
[2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:42.720]  what you said well uh just that uh we've got to be diligent with what's going on our bank accounts
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:47.520]  pay attention to our statements and i agree and when they blow something up like the boston bombing
[2:02:47.520 --> 2:02:53.040]  u.s citizens have to go to it with your cameras hidden and get the footage to expose their next

[2:03:51.040 --> 2:03:56.960]  staged event at the rnc a few years ago and it turned out it was a total setup it is a setup
[2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:02.720]  these uh the undercover officers alex were giving a 20 year old beer they were high on marihuana
[2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:08.080]  alex and these undercover officers paid for the gasoline they encouraged these individuals no
[2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:12.800]  no they're leading the attacks they're not just finding them and frustrating them they're organizing
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:19.040]  them and it is it is very evil absolutely it's very evil and if the jury finds these three men
[2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:24.160]  guilty of terrorism this is the first ever terrorism case in illinois i have lost all faith
[2:04:24.160 --> 2:04:29.600]  in the system i've been at these hearings the hey look at hitari look at the hitari militia
[2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:33.680]  they never said kill anybody they're blowing up they know the fed kept saying well what are the
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:37.120]  u n tech server where they're murdering everybody well we'll have to fight of course we'll have to
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:41.680]  fight this means you're gonna go out and kill people and so right there the the federal judge
[2:04:41.680 --> 2:04:46.400]  everybody said this this trial is over because they were innocent so that's the good news is
[2:04:46.400 --> 2:04:51.040]  there still some justice great points you should have video report on that billy oh we might air
[2:04:51.040 --> 2:04:54.640]  it he's a great reporter out there freelance reporter tony in south carolina you're on the
[2:04:54.640 --> 2:05:02.720]  air go ahead you and alex my brother you've had economists on that warned the people to only
[2:05:02.720 --> 2:05:08.080]  keep enough fed or reserve notes around to handle their immediate needs maybe this warning is just
[2:05:08.080 --> 2:05:12.560]  a way to help the people who aren't awake um to tell them that they should get their money out of
[2:05:12.560 --> 2:05:18.720]  the bank invest it in silver keep only what they need to cover their immediate bill um on a second
[2:05:18.720 --> 2:05:24.080]  notice as the bank runs starting all this gold starting to go back up again the inflation
[2:05:24.080 --> 2:05:28.720]  starting to come out go ahead so if you look at if you do technical analysis you know there's
[2:05:28.720 --> 2:05:33.600]  an up front and a down front line the uh last week and a half silver's been bouncing off the
[2:05:33.600 --> 2:05:39.520]  up front line if it breaks that then we could go down to like 14 14 dollars an hour the three
[2:05:39.520 --> 2:05:43.280]  year downtrend line while we're meeting that too so in the next week you're probably going to see

[2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:40.160]  he has a good heart and i have a good feeling about him i don't believe that that's what i have to say

[2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:18.080]  didn't get into it because we missed it or the you know the email spam we had a tsa naked body
[2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:23.120]  scanner contest like four years ago or three years ago and i was like there's only 100 entries there's
[2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:29.520]  usually 500 and it turns out like 60 70 percent or more weren't making it through because the word
[2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:35.520]  naked you know in the search function i see the it guy smiling out there i was like this is wrong
[2:10:35.520 --> 2:10:41.280]  check it so you know just just just just keep keep sending it brother okay and then one more quick
[2:10:41.280 --> 2:10:47.520]  thing i was wondering what's the likelihood of you doing like an after dark kind of uh no holds bar
[2:10:47.520 --> 2:10:53.520]  uncensored version of the alex jones show i'd really like to hear you uh kind of just let loose and
[2:10:53.520 --> 2:10:58.160]  this is an uncensored i want to be clear and i appreciate your call brother this is uncensored
[2:10:59.440 --> 2:11:07.280]  i mean my crew's here i i run the show uh and half the time i'm not really running things so um
[2:11:08.240 --> 2:11:14.240]  i tell people what i can prove i have a lot of concerns and ideas and theories about what's
[2:11:14.240 --> 2:11:19.120]  going on that i can't prove but so many times i can search my theory and find them saying
[2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:25.200]  that's what's incredible about the the nsa run google and bing and the rest of it is they're
[2:11:25.200 --> 2:11:30.160]  using it to see what we're thinking they're all talking to so i'll have some thought about them
[2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:36.800]  i'll search it and there they are saying it's it's wild it's it's it's wild so i'm just a regular
[2:11:36.800 --> 2:11:43.600]  guy any of you can do what i'm doing here if people tend to focus in on the big major events
[2:11:43.600 --> 2:11:48.560]  that are happening and try to do something about it obama's in trouble politically he and his
[2:11:48.560 --> 2:11:53.520]  controllers a very virulent version of the new world order are trying to have a cultural takeover
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:56.880]  because they're not just globalists they really do hate the family they really are racist
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:02.400]  they really are double dealers and so they're really upset about what's happening right now and
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:07.040]  they know they're beginning to lose the culture war so get ready for another counter offensive
[2:12:07.040 --> 2:12:12.560]  with the empire striking back let's go to francis uh in new york francis you're the last caller go
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:18.160]  ahead hey however you know it's like you're doing i'm all right uh just call me psycho if you call
[2:12:18.160 --> 2:12:23.280]  me francis i'll kill you no you're not psycho you're very informed of your no no no no no that's from
[2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:28.240]  that's from stripes you're my mentor i believe it comes from information but i just want to tell
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:33.840]  you something i am scared what's going on i hear you i think i'm by leaving the country to be honest
[2:12:33.840 --> 2:12:40.640]  yeah i really am i'm i'm terrified for my kids for my wife for my all my family members i really am
[2:12:40.640 --> 2:12:45.920]  i'm terrified what's going on i've been in work for about 10 years already and it's everything you
[2:12:45.920 --> 2:12:50.960]  say i research it and it's to a t you're the best what you're actually you're the best that's out
[2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:55.440]  there believe me you are well brother i thank you but again i don't want to be the best i just want
[2:12:55.440 --> 2:13:00.240]  to stop this these people have a score to settle with us the globalists have wanted to bring down
[2:13:00.240 --> 2:13:04.640]  liberty for hundreds of years thousands of years and they want to dominate us and conquer us and
[2:13:04.640 --> 2:13:08.560]  they're cold-blooded and they've decided to do whatever it takes to do it but waking up to their
[2:13:08.560 --> 2:13:13.520]  illegitimacy is the end of them congress has a six percent approval rating obama's plunging
[2:13:13.520 --> 2:13:18.800]  so the good news is we're tearing them up so it is terrifying what's happening as ted cruz said but
[2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:24.240]  at the same time we've got to get super motivated to call talk radio to call congress to start our
[2:13:24.240 --> 2:13:29.200]  own youtube channels to write books to make your own films and we will just individually with everything
[2:13:29.200 --> 2:13:35.520]  we do if we each talk to 10 people a week not all you'll talk to 16 15 million a week like i do
[2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:40.800]  we will overturn the enemy they need our agreement they need us to let them in like the vampire
[2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:47.520]  ask permission we have to rebuke them call them out we got to get ourselves right with god as well
[2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:52.160]  none of us are perfect we got to get our heart right and we'll turn this around but no i mean
[2:13:52.160 --> 2:13:57.040]  this is it and i've come to the realization they're not going incremental anymore because we're
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:03.280]  beating them they're going to go whole hog very soon with you name it so you're as smart as i am
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:10.960]  we're smarter folks what do we do to defeat these people any ideas you're still there yes i am any
[2:14:10.960 --> 2:14:17.360]  ideas uh oh jesus i mean just give me free to everyone just just give them information just
[2:14:17.360 --> 2:14:21.120]  let them know what's going on that's all you can do that's all you can do that's basically
[2:14:21.680 --> 2:14:25.920]  people are not going to take your advice and that's up to them what you can't force people
[2:14:25.920 --> 2:14:30.000]  to believe you what what you're saying god bless your brother you know in closing i want to say this
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:34.320]  you look at rand paul in a photo with mitch mcconnell we had up on the side a moment ago
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:39.040]  and i don't even think mitch mcconnell is an evil god at the end of the day we know rand paul is a
[2:14:39.040 --> 2:14:44.320]  good guy but they're up in this evil system trying to survive just doing a few good things
[2:14:44.320 --> 2:14:49.920]  that won't do it anymore you got to be like rand paul ted cruise bob bar i mean bob bar has such
[2:14:49.920 --> 2:14:55.680]  courage with the political purge going on that's why i was really thanking him thursday because it
[2:14:55.680 --> 2:15:00.960]  really hit me i know how the system works i know i mean he says he's gonna impeach obama when he gets
[2:15:00.960 --> 2:15:07.680]  in he's in the lead saying that they may pull the stops out to try to block him because they know
[2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:12.800]  he already got clinton almost impeached before this is real this is a real battle bob bar could
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:18.080]  sell out to the new world order you can't sell out with death and destruction and poverty there's
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:25.840]  nothing to sell out to you're selling out to crazy people that's the whole point it's madness it's like
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:31.600]  when gandalf fictionally in the lord of the rings is talking to soran or saruman the top wizard and
[2:15:31.600 --> 2:15:39.520]  he says because we must join with soran he goes windage saruman give up wisdom for madness you
[2:15:39.520 --> 2:15:45.120]  can't join with the one ring you can't join with satan you can't join with the all-seeing eye you
[2:15:45.120 --> 2:15:51.520]  can't share power with it but people are cowards the average person's a coward now they've had it
[2:15:51.520 --> 2:15:56.080]  given to them they have no chivalry no honor and so they're scared they go all just act like a thug
[2:15:56.080 --> 2:16:00.240]  and then people think i'm tough and leave me alone well you're gonna be trodden underfoot i want to
[2:16:00.240 --> 2:16:05.280]  say that you think you cowards think you're gonna escape judgment in this life of the next you think
[2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:10.480]  you're gonna sit there and stand down while this takeover happens and that you won't be held accountable
[2:16:10.480 --> 2:16:19.200]  you have no idea no idea the gate you've opened the danger is the groveling the danger is giving
[2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:23.520]  in we've had so much wealth and power because americans weren't perfect but on average the average
[2:16:23.520 --> 2:16:29.920]  individual would kill you before they'd be your slave now we act like sheep were ruled by wolves
[2:16:29.920 --> 2:16:34.880]  take us out gentlemen great job to the crew that's 16 and a half or 17 minutes of overdrive
