[00:00.000 --> 00:10.660] ...
[01:10.660 --> 01:27.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, September 10th, the year is 2021, and I am your host
[01:27.660 --> 01:30.340]  Alex Jones.
[01:30.340 --> 01:37.940]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours, and I am going to attempt as best
[01:37.940 --> 01:46.020]  I can to calmly go over all the news and information that is breaking here today.
[01:46.020 --> 01:55.660]  Now, we have reached a point where words are not strong enough to describe what is unfolding
[01:55.660 --> 02:01.300]  in our society on this planet here today.
[02:01.300 --> 02:07.260]  And it is critical that the general public understand this is a planetary, directed,
[02:07.260 --> 02:15.660]  corporate, fascist dictatorship being set up that uses leftist, Marxist, Maoist ideology
[02:15.660 --> 02:22.660]  to control the general public, but it itself is multinational and corporate and fascist
[02:22.660 --> 02:30.260]  in its political system and eugenics-based and depopulationist-based in its goal.
[02:30.260 --> 02:36.820]  Now, you saw a president, the puppet Biden, the man that stole his way into the election,
[02:36.820 --> 02:42.060]  the man installed by Big Tech and the globalist.
[02:42.060 --> 02:51.480]  You see him, and you witness him carrying out the operations that are being carried
[02:51.480 --> 02:56.540]  out in Europe and Australia and Canada, and you only see them increasing the measures
[02:56.540 --> 03:01.940]  of control as they claim they are removing the systems of control.
[03:01.940 --> 03:07.780]  This is a planned, great reset, permanent, world-government, technocracy, martial law
[03:07.780 --> 03:10.620]  system that is being put in place.
[03:10.620 --> 03:17.780]  So here's the big takeaway for everyone out there.
[03:17.780 --> 03:23.500]  If you think what Biden announced yesterday, declaring dictatorial powers unto himself,
[03:23.500 --> 03:29.620]  federal takeover of all, but basically business and society, if you think that's bad, you
[03:29.620 --> 03:32.460]  ain't seen nothing yet.
[03:32.460 --> 03:38.420]  And so everything you see in Australia will be here within a year, because we're already
[03:38.420 --> 03:41.340]  where Australia was now a year ago.
[03:41.340 --> 03:44.500]  They are being directed by the corporations.
[03:44.500 --> 03:48.620]  This is a corporate plan, and that's why it's up to all the politicians to execute
[03:48.620 --> 03:53.740]  it along with the corporations, or they will be destroyed by the corporate media and by
[03:53.740 --> 03:54.740]  Big Tech.
[03:54.740 --> 03:57.820]  That's why they act like they've got guns in their heads.
[03:57.820 --> 04:01.260]  Because these politicians are just political whores that are bought and paid for and compromised,
[04:01.260 --> 04:02.780]  they'd like to be popular, actually.
[04:02.780 --> 04:04.700]  They'd like to be rich and powerful.
[04:04.700 --> 04:08.460]  I mean, they'll rob you blind to do that, but they don't want to burn everything down,
[04:08.460 --> 04:09.460]  most of them.
[04:09.460 --> 04:10.460]  Quite a few are pedophiles.
[04:10.460 --> 04:12.380]  They just want to rape children.
[04:12.380 --> 04:15.940]  But there is a group behind them that's even more evil than they are.
[04:15.940 --> 04:20.700]  So we're going to come back, and we've got just the incredible clips from yesterday,
[04:20.700 --> 04:22.340]  and we're going to analyze it all.
[04:22.340 --> 04:26.940]  We have constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes who has filed suits a month ago and more last
[04:26.940 --> 04:29.820]  week with Robert Kennedy Jr. against this fraud.
[04:29.820 --> 04:32.780]  And we've got Mike Adams, loaded for bear, coming up in the fourth hour.
[04:32.780 --> 04:34.460]  I'll be hosting with him.
[04:34.460 --> 04:39.500]  And just so much more today, we have Dr. Zelinko, Vladimir Zev Zelinko, amazing interview
[04:39.500 --> 04:40.900]  a few weeks ago with him.
[04:40.900 --> 04:43.940]  He'll be back today in the third hour.
[04:43.940 --> 04:46.140]  This is going to be one hell of a Friday broadcast.
[04:46.140 --> 04:51.820]  And then, Kamara at 5 p.m., a special report with four different guests you don't want
[04:51.820 --> 04:55.940]  to miss as well on Saturday, and I come back Sunday live, or to 6 p.m. Central.
[04:55.940 --> 04:57.620]  Yeah, we're working hard.
[04:57.620 --> 05:00.580]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[05:00.580 --> 05:03.540]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[05:03.540 --> 05:06.580]  Monday at midnight, we've got to end this sale.
[05:06.580 --> 05:11.180]  We may end it earlier, because we think it'll sell out by then at current sales rates.
[05:11.180 --> 05:12.860]  Vitamin mineral fusion is super popular.
[05:12.860 --> 05:16.100]  It's got all the high-quality vitamins and minerals that are essential, great amino
[05:16.100 --> 05:17.500]  acids, and it tastes great.
[05:17.500 --> 05:22.140]  It's powder formed, so in the water, you absorb it more when you drink the fruit punch.
[05:22.140 --> 05:25.820]  Then we also have, back in stock, this sale will continue through next week.
[05:25.820 --> 05:30.020]  Knockout sleep aid with eight organic ingredients that help you sleep better.
[05:30.020 --> 05:34.620]  It's 50% off, and Ultra 12, one of our best sellers, high-quality vitamin B12 for your
[05:34.620 --> 05:37.940]  whole body, your stamina, your albedo, your energy, your immune system.
[05:37.940 --> 05:43.460]  It's back in stock, and it is 50% off as well at infowarstore.com, so get your vitamin mineral
[05:43.460 --> 05:49.380]  fusion while you still can at infowarstore.com for 33% off, and a bunch of the other supplements
[05:49.380 --> 05:54.060]  are 50% off as well throughout next week, but the sale of vitamin mineral fusion ends
[05:54.060 --> 06:22.300]  Monday night, so get yours now.
[06:24.060 --> 06:34.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, September 10th.
[06:34.140 --> 06:36.900]  The year is 2021.
[06:36.900 --> 06:38.500]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:38.500 --> 06:47.100]  I'll be hosting for the full four hours today Dr. Vladimir Zev Zelinko, the prominent Jewish
[06:47.100 --> 06:53.500]  doctor from upstate New York who treats over 30,000 patients, will be joining us.
[06:53.500 --> 06:58.220]  He is quite the fireball of information and dead on target from my research.
[06:58.220 --> 07:04.300]  In the third hour today, Mike Adams is asking the big question, why are the politicians
[07:04.300 --> 07:08.980]  worldwide acting like a gun to their head and doing all these criminal things as if
[07:08.980 --> 07:13.060]  they know Asteroids about to hit the earth or something, and they want to get rid of
[07:13.060 --> 07:18.620]  as many people as possible, so there's enough resources for them to survive.
[07:18.620 --> 07:22.300]  We're just hypothetically asking, why are they going for broke, why are they so committed
[07:22.300 --> 07:26.580]  to depopulating the planet when the truth is there's still plenty of resources and they've
[07:26.580 --> 07:30.140]  been suppressing new technologies and systems.
[07:30.140 --> 07:34.020]  We have constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[07:34.020 --> 07:39.180]  He has filed suits months ago with Robert Kennedy Jr. against all this tyrannical behavior,
[07:39.180 --> 07:43.540]  and last week and yesterday they filed new suits as they had to change their suits because
[07:43.540 --> 07:48.900]  now they claim that the vaccine is authorized, which I have all the articles and news.
[07:48.900 --> 07:55.420]  They did not FDA approve or the approval process, they just said now, outside of law, we don't
[07:55.420 --> 07:59.620]  go through drug approval, we just say it's approved, but it's a no man's land, so there's
[07:59.620 --> 08:05.300]  no liability protection for the general public, they have liability protection, and there's
[08:05.300 --> 08:12.740]  not even the secret vaccine damage court, and on top of that, you can't sue them.
[08:12.740 --> 08:16.780]  So this is true invincibility that they have.
[08:16.780 --> 08:21.020]  True criminal activity, true above the law, but that, again, you can have on paper that
[08:21.020 --> 08:24.620]  you're above the law, that's never really the case in the court of public opinion and
[08:24.620 --> 08:27.260]  the law of nature in man.
[08:27.260 --> 08:31.580]  So that's coming up today as well, and then I'm going to interview some key people this
[08:31.580 --> 08:41.300]  afternoon and tomorrow for a taped powerhouse transmission that will air at 5 p.m. tomorrow,
[08:41.300 --> 08:44.220]  and I think I'm also going to stream this and send it up on the radio and TV satellite
[08:44.220 --> 08:50.460]  tomorrow and not just post it to man.video and freeworldnews.tv, so look for that.
[08:50.460 --> 08:55.900]  Okay, I really want everybody to take out a pen and paper or get on your word processor
[08:55.900 --> 09:02.580]  as they call it and type up some notes, because this is global corporations charting the rest
[09:02.580 --> 09:08.100]  of your life and the rest of my life and deciding what our destinies are and bringing in a world
[09:08.100 --> 09:14.540]  I.D., a world medical system, a world carbon tax tracker controller that will tell you
[09:14.540 --> 09:16.420]  where you can go and what you can do.
[09:16.420 --> 09:22.900]  In the words of Klaus Schwab and Xixi Ping, under the new global social credit score,
[09:22.900 --> 09:30.100]  you will not be able to set one foot outside your, excuse me, one half foot outside of
[09:30.100 --> 09:36.100]  your house unless the app authorizes you to, and you'll have to have a phone by law or
[09:36.100 --> 09:37.980]  a microchip under your skin.
[09:37.980 --> 09:41.380]  This is now been announced in Australia, it's being announced in the U.K., it's being
[09:41.380 --> 09:44.100]  announced in Canada by Trudeau two weeks ago.
[09:44.100 --> 09:45.580]  This is really happening.
[09:45.580 --> 09:50.340]  They're announcing the new world order is contact tracing one hour outside of your house
[09:50.340 --> 09:54.460]  if you're vaccinated, not allowed to leave your house if you're not injected, what to
[09:54.460 --> 09:59.060]  always say the new world order would be corporations with a U.N., releasing a virus, using it to
[09:59.060 --> 10:04.260]  shut everything down, hold people hostage until they took tracker apps in their phones
[10:04.260 --> 10:08.140]  that would control your carbon output and where you went and what you did.
[10:08.140 --> 10:13.700]  I said in my film in game 14 years ago, because it sent all the Rockefeller Foundation documents
[10:13.700 --> 10:17.300]  and they were on the show, they set up the U.N.
[10:17.300 --> 10:24.740]  And they did the work, they're in charge fraudulently and they are moving forward with this total
[10:24.740 --> 10:25.740]  takeover.
[10:25.740 --> 10:31.900]  So 11 years ago they put out Plantopolis for children's cartoons in the U.K. by the Rockefeller
[10:31.900 --> 10:32.900]  Foundation and the U.N.
[10:32.900 --> 10:36.300]  And it says your smart phone will tell you when you can leave the house and where you
[10:36.300 --> 10:37.300]  can go.
[10:37.300 --> 10:40.460]  Do you understand?
[10:40.460 --> 10:45.300]  I know there's millions of different talk show hosts and views and ideas and sadly enough
[10:45.300 --> 10:48.660]  99% of them don't know what the hell they're talking about.
[10:48.660 --> 10:49.940]  This is the truth.
[10:49.940 --> 10:55.620]  I read the U.N. papers, I read the white papers, I read Agenda 21, I read Agenda 2030, I read
[10:55.620 --> 11:02.860]  Ray Kurzweil, I read Bill Joy, I read it, I study it, I live it, I know it.
[11:02.860 --> 11:10.340]  And the left can pretend they're part of this and it's censoring and bullying and going
[11:10.340 --> 11:13.180]  along with this is cool, they're going to get a universal income and they're not going
[11:13.180 --> 11:14.180]  to have to work.
[11:14.180 --> 11:18.500]  Do you dumbasses really think when this thing comes in, you're not going to have to work?
[11:18.500 --> 11:20.380]  You're going to be dead.
[11:20.380 --> 11:27.060]  Do you know what Merrick's disease is, you stupid leftist.
[11:27.060 --> 11:28.060]  I care about you.
[11:28.060 --> 11:29.060]  I love you.
[11:29.060 --> 11:33.100]  I love Rowdy Piper in the fight and they live because his friend won't put the sunglasses
[11:33.100 --> 11:35.700]  on and just see it for yourself.
[11:35.700 --> 11:39.060]  But what you are is Stockholm syndrome victims.
[11:39.060 --> 11:42.500]  That goes for right wingers, everybody else that goes along with this.
[11:42.500 --> 11:44.820]  You can't handle the truth.
[11:44.820 --> 11:50.260]  You can't handle the horror as Dr. Zelinko said a few days ago on another show.
[11:50.260 --> 11:53.540]  People can't wrap their minds around it so they decide to accept it and that's what
[11:53.540 --> 12:00.100]  Klaus Schwab and Ted Turner and Bill Gates and the whole crew of evil eugenicists are
[12:00.100 --> 12:01.100]  doing.
[12:01.100 --> 12:07.460]  They're so decadent and so miserable and are such dirty pedophiles putting Oprah Winfrey
[12:07.460 --> 12:12.220]  that they want to kill everybody and that's happened throughout history over and over
[12:12.220 --> 12:13.220]  again.
[12:13.220 --> 12:18.820]  So you better wake up.
[12:18.820 --> 12:27.380]  Put the glasses on, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:27.380 --> 12:28.380]  Realize the truth.
[12:28.380 --> 12:31.420]  When we go to break, I'm going to come back and I'm going to play all the key clips of
[12:31.420 --> 12:35.300]  Biden and all the cryptic things he said and all the creepiness of it.
[12:35.300 --> 12:38.260]  But remember, he's designed to take all the heat.
[12:38.260 --> 12:40.740]  He's designed to be the shell who gets the blame.
[12:40.740 --> 12:44.660]  Sure, give him the blame and then give his bosses the blame because he's just a front
[12:44.660 --> 12:45.660]  man.
[12:45.660 --> 12:46.660]  He's not even a capo.
[12:46.660 --> 12:49.500]  And he's certainly not a chief.
[12:49.500 --> 12:53.900]  He's not a Don going to use a Kosanostra allegories.
[12:53.900 --> 12:56.540]  He is a bag man.
[12:56.540 --> 13:00.660]  He is totally and completely expendable.
[13:00.660 --> 13:08.260]  You need to know it is the United Nations that is running this whole globalist operation.
[13:08.260 --> 13:11.060]  It is the powerful corporations that set it up.
[13:11.060 --> 13:15.220]  It is the tax-free foundations and they all get together and decide on their global power
[13:15.220 --> 13:19.860]  and their control and they've created giant Ponzi schemes for thousands of trillions
[13:19.860 --> 13:26.780]  of dollars of garbage, hundreds of times all the wealth in the world, and they want to
[13:26.780 --> 13:30.260]  depopulate the earth because they don't want to look at you and they don't want to give
[13:30.260 --> 13:34.340]  you resources and they don't want you to have a job and they don't want you and your children
[13:34.340 --> 13:37.700]  to contend with the renaissance of their power structure.
[13:37.700 --> 13:43.340]  They want a permanent revolution that reduces the population by 90 percent in their public
[13:43.340 --> 13:47.460]  documents and their internal documents that are now being externalized.
[13:47.460 --> 13:53.940]  They want to remove all humans and merge the machines and become gods, a handful of them.
[13:53.940 --> 13:56.860]  And of course, you know when there's three or four of these globalists left, if they
[13:56.860 --> 14:03.740]  had their way in classic satanic fashion, they will then kill each other trying to be the
[14:03.740 --> 14:05.540]  one.
[14:05.540 --> 14:12.500]  This is total selfishness, total attack on free will, total attack on the life cycle,
[14:12.500 --> 14:17.660]  total attack on all the good things that our Creator has given us.
[14:17.660 --> 14:22.900]  We're going to go to break, but this is a declaration of war against the free republic,
[14:22.900 --> 14:34.700]  it's a declaration of war against humanity, and it is Biden openly declaring, openly declaring
[14:34.700 --> 14:41.580]  a medical dictatorship over this country.
[14:41.580 --> 14:44.140]  It is extremely serious.
[14:44.140 --> 14:46.380]  There are no other words to describe it.
[14:46.380 --> 14:52.020]  Now, briefly, a lot of you watching on TV probably saw that lower third pop up.
[14:52.020 --> 14:56.980]  We're running it till Monday night at midnight, it'll probably sell out before then, 33 percent
[14:56.980 --> 15:01.100]  off, vitamin mineral fusion, all the vitamins, all the minerals, key amino acids, such a
[15:01.100 --> 15:05.100]  good formula for children, adults, but especially old folks, can eat neat and eat, but your
[15:05.100 --> 15:09.260]  guts aren't good when you get older on average and absorbing as much of the nutrients.
[15:09.260 --> 15:13.140]  So a liquid vitamin mineral with the amino acids to get into your bloodstream and into
[15:13.140 --> 15:16.300]  your body's muscles and other parts of your body is key.
[15:16.300 --> 15:21.620]  This is a great formula, it's got quality product in it, it's not garbage, it's organic,
[15:21.620 --> 15:24.300]  it funds our operations, so it's a win-win, I want to thank you all for your support.
[15:24.300 --> 15:27.780]  I'm going to get your vitamin mineral fusion right now while you still can, and there's
[15:27.780 --> 15:31.140]  a bunch of other stuff up there for sale that's also going to be ending on Monday.
[15:31.140 --> 15:36.060]  But the new sale is knockout, 50 percent off, ultra 12, back in stock, I call it B12 under
[15:36.060 --> 15:37.700]  the tongue, liquid form.
[15:37.700 --> 15:44.020]  That is 50 percent off, and more, that will be next week's sale, and we sold out of the
[15:44.020 --> 15:47.900]  Rainforest Ultra, so more of that should come in a few months.
[15:47.900 --> 15:51.020]  Wow, it is incredible.
[15:51.020 --> 15:52.420]  Twice as strong as Rainforest Plus.
[15:52.420 --> 15:55.500]  So be right back, stay with us.
[15:55.500 --> 15:59.340]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[15:59.340 --> 16:04.020]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:04.020 --> 16:08.980]  Here's why, we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:08.980 --> 16:13.980]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:13.980 --> 16:19.140]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and
[16:19.140 --> 16:23.060]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:23.060 --> 16:26.980]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[16:26.980 --> 16:31.740]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:31.740 --> 16:37.020]  And better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[16:37.020 --> 16:38.020]  too.
[16:38.020 --> 16:41.660]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[16:41.660 --> 16:43.620]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[16:43.620 --> 16:48.260]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and
[16:48.260 --> 16:52.100]  medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[16:52.100 --> 16:54.100]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[16:54.100 --> 17:00.020]  Hey everybody, if you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food,
[17:00.020 --> 17:01.020]  I've got great news.
[17:01.020 --> 17:03.860]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:03.860 --> 17:04.860]  Here's the thing.
[17:04.860 --> 17:10.380]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.
[17:10.380 --> 17:15.660]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[17:15.660 --> 17:18.460]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:18.460 --> 17:19.620]  The best part?
[17:19.620 --> 17:24.700]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are
[17:24.700 --> 17:28.940]  coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[17:28.940 --> 17:29.940]  Gets even better.
[17:29.940 --> 17:34.580]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want
[17:34.580 --> 17:39.820]  to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the
[17:39.820 --> 17:40.820]  world, period.
[17:40.820 --> 17:47.260]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com, and discover the real reason we're giving
[17:47.260 --> 17:56.700]  this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[17:56.700 --> 18:02.180]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[18:02.180 --> 18:07.820]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection
[18:07.820 --> 18:12.020]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[18:12.020 --> 18:17.140]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[18:17.140 --> 18:21.980]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[18:21.980 --> 18:26.260]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening, and
[18:26.260 --> 18:31.260]  it's unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[18:31.260 --> 18:34.380]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[18:34.380 --> 18:37.740]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[18:37.740 --> 18:42.380]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[18:42.380 --> 18:43.380]  an end.
[18:43.380 --> 18:49.140]  And so we must prepare, get up to a years worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival
[18:49.140 --> 18:56.540]  gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[18:56.540 --> 19:03.060]  What was the most important point in Joe Biden's declaration of war against America on Thursday,
[19:03.060 --> 19:05.560]  September 9, 2021?
[19:05.560 --> 19:10.260]  Was it the announcement of forced inoculations of 80 to 100 million Americans?
[19:10.260 --> 19:15.100]  Was it the announcement of federalization of all the major cities, the bypassing of
[19:15.100 --> 19:18.100]  state governors, the threat to basically remove them?
[19:18.100 --> 19:19.460]  No, it wasn't.
[19:19.460 --> 19:21.460]  That was all bad enough.
[19:21.460 --> 19:27.300]  It's the fact that he's following a UN globalist great reset blueprint that Australia, the
[19:27.300 --> 19:32.620]  U.K., Europe, and the rest of the western world is, and that this is just the beginning.
[19:32.620 --> 19:38.820]  More lockdowns, national medical IDs approved by the United Nations, carbon taxes that don't
[19:38.820 --> 19:43.060]  just track a trace to attach you, but actually tell you when you can go somewhere and what
[19:43.060 --> 19:44.060]  you can do.
[19:44.060 --> 19:46.300]  It's all been announced at the UN level.
[19:46.300 --> 19:52.460]  This is a UN world government takeover, corporate revolution through global governance.
[19:52.460 --> 19:59.380]  It's illegal, and Congress must stand up and stop it now.
[19:59.380 --> 20:17.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:17.820 --> 20:34.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:34.140 --> 20:44.700]  Because there's a war on for your mind, your heart, your soul, your body, your destiny,
[20:44.700 --> 20:47.200]  your whole future.
[20:47.200 --> 20:52.900]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday global transmission.
[20:52.900 --> 20:54.380]  World government has already been announced.
[20:54.380 --> 21:00.540]  The UN is in charge of even what members of the U.S. Senate can say on the floor when
[21:00.540 --> 21:06.620]  they say things that are true like learned immunity is 13 to 27 times better than the
[21:06.620 --> 21:10.900]  Pfizer shot according to the Israeli government's own study.
[21:10.900 --> 21:17.180]  Google, Facebook, and Twitter all remove Senator Paul a month ago and said, that's not official
[21:17.180 --> 21:24.260]  policy of the WHO.
[21:24.260 --> 21:29.460]  And Paul did nothing.
[21:29.460 --> 21:33.700]  And he's doing more than most when it comes to exposing Wuhan lab and calling for Fauci's
[21:33.700 --> 21:35.340]  arrest and five years in jail.
[21:35.340 --> 21:36.340]  He's our champion.
[21:36.340 --> 21:45.220]  He's the best we've got, but he's so conditioned to the censorship.
[21:45.220 --> 21:52.340]  The former president's band who had the election stolen from him, still our president, that
[21:52.340 --> 21:54.660]  he just took it too.
[21:54.660 --> 21:55.660]  See how it works.
[21:55.660 --> 21:57.180]  See how they break your will.
[21:57.180 --> 22:07.700]  See how you adapt to being a slave, just like when I had to sit next to one of the heads
[22:07.700 --> 22:14.300]  of the fourth largest bank in the U.S., I said, I recognize you and I said, where have I seen
[22:14.300 --> 22:15.300]  you?
[22:15.300 --> 22:18.660]  Because the guy looked very aristocratic, very like something out of a Hollywood movie
[22:18.660 --> 22:24.140]  of a corporate executive, suit perfect, tie perfect in the American Airlines first class
[22:24.140 --> 22:28.700]  visiting his dad, retired general here in Austin.
[22:28.700 --> 22:30.940]  And so we talked about an hour and a half at the end of the flight, he wouldn't talk
[22:30.940 --> 22:31.940]  to me at first.
[22:31.940 --> 22:38.140]  He laughed and he said, Alex, you think they're going to adapt to what we're doing and overcome
[22:38.140 --> 22:39.140]  it?
[22:39.140 --> 22:40.140]  No, no.
[22:40.140 --> 22:41.140]  The public's going to submit.
[22:41.140 --> 22:48.900]  They're going to adapt to submitting to corporate rule over the planet because we're much better
[22:48.900 --> 22:50.940]  managers than the government.
[22:50.940 --> 22:56.220]  Oh, you're much better managers at selling the same mortgage 50 times, you're much better
[22:56.220 --> 22:59.940]  managers at taking old ladies' houses, you're much better managers at setting the tax rates
[22:59.940 --> 23:02.460]  for poor people in middle class and then exempting yourself.
[23:02.460 --> 23:03.460]  Yeah, you know what?
[23:03.460 --> 23:12.620]  You are much more together and you work to put bad people into government like Joe Biden
[23:12.620 --> 23:15.300]  and then censor good people to make sure you can carry it out.
[23:15.300 --> 23:21.020]  Yeah, you've really screwed the planet up and you set China up to deindustrialize us
[23:21.020 --> 23:22.260]  so you can make trillions.
[23:22.260 --> 23:27.580]  And now China has backstabbed you and Xi Jinping has come out and said, and it's all over the
[23:27.580 --> 23:32.540]  foreign news and all the news here, that George Soros is a criminal terrorist who's destroyed
[23:32.540 --> 23:35.220]  more than 30 economies and should be in prison.
[23:35.220 --> 23:36.220]  Which is true.
[23:36.220 --> 23:37.220]  Do I like Xi Jinping?
[23:37.220 --> 23:38.720]  Do I like communism?
[23:38.720 --> 23:40.900]  Do I like them putting people in camps?
[23:40.900 --> 23:41.900]  No.
[23:41.900 --> 23:45.900]  But I do like seeing a fisher like Stalin and Hitler in World War II of two evil groups
[23:45.900 --> 23:51.020]  against each other.
[23:51.020 --> 23:53.740]  And so you see their new old order and go in the way they thought it would.
[23:53.740 --> 23:55.460]  It's going to destroy everything.
[23:55.460 --> 23:57.100]  You're getting rid of the checks and balances.
[23:57.100 --> 24:01.260]  You're getting rid of the chivalry, which has protected everybody.
[24:01.260 --> 24:03.940]  Oh, but you decided you didn't need that.
[24:03.940 --> 24:07.780]  You decided you were going to be masters of the universe and you'd control China, too.
[24:07.780 --> 24:13.620]  And you've lost control just like that because you have the same hubris that Hitler and Mao
[24:13.620 --> 24:20.100]  and Stalin and all the rest and all of those people, the guy you own, that little communist
[24:20.100 --> 24:27.980]  manager that put Venezuela into debt to the bankers, the IMF and World Bank, Hugo Chavez.
[24:27.980 --> 24:29.420]  Let's start getting to the videos here.
[24:29.420 --> 24:33.460]  Here's Biden in December of 2020.
[24:33.460 --> 24:37.460]  That's nine months ago.
[24:37.460 --> 24:44.260]  Here he is saying he doesn't want a federal COVID vaccine mandate.
[24:44.260 --> 24:47.260]  No, I don't think it's mandatory.
[24:47.260 --> 24:53.380]  I would demand to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power.
[24:53.380 --> 24:56.420]  Just like I don't think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide.
[24:56.420 --> 25:01.940]  I'll do everything in my power as President of the United States to encourage people to
[25:01.940 --> 25:05.780]  do the right thing and when they do it, demonstrate that it matters.
[25:05.780 --> 25:07.100]  And then he puts the diaper back on.
[25:07.100 --> 25:08.900]  Now he wants it mandated.
[25:08.900 --> 25:14.180]  Now he wants 800 million workers to be made to do it, or they'll have OSHA fine you $14,000.
[25:14.180 --> 25:15.180]  All criminal.
[25:15.180 --> 25:19.780]  While he exempts the White House, while he exempts 600,000 postal workers, oh, that's
[25:19.780 --> 25:20.940]  the key to tyranny.
[25:20.940 --> 25:24.100]  The party members, they're always exempt.
[25:24.100 --> 25:32.900]  All an act of submission and federalization of you look at that dandruff covered mask.
[25:32.900 --> 25:33.900]  So here he is.
[25:33.900 --> 25:39.420]  There's a little compilation of some of the nightmare stuff of Biden saying it's you,
[25:39.420 --> 25:41.580]  the unvaccinated.
[25:41.580 --> 25:42.780]  This is your pandemic.
[25:42.780 --> 25:47.260]  Even though I have all the studies right here in my stack, it's admitted mainline virology
[25:47.260 --> 25:52.980]  that the vaccines all over the world knocked out a whole bunch of regular cold viruses
[25:52.980 --> 25:59.100]  and had some effect on the COVID, but had all sorts of side effects, but then created
[25:59.100 --> 26:03.100]  the Delta variant that is immune to all the vaccines.
[26:03.100 --> 26:04.260]  It's in the news.
[26:04.260 --> 26:08.900]  It's in the sign of reports immune to all the vaccines and spreads much faster and is
[26:08.900 --> 26:10.580]  very, very strong.
[26:10.580 --> 26:11.980]  And now there's making people sick everywhere.
[26:11.980 --> 26:13.980]  They never want to real sick folks last year.
[26:13.980 --> 26:16.300]  That was exaggerated and basically made up.
[26:16.300 --> 26:19.740]  Now the sickness is everywhere.
[26:19.740 --> 26:20.740]  And they're blaming us.
[26:20.740 --> 26:22.660]  Oh, some towns have hundreds.
[26:22.660 --> 26:23.660]  Dying.
[26:23.660 --> 26:24.660]  Little towns.
[26:24.660 --> 26:25.660]  Oh, oh my gosh, hospitals are full.
[26:25.660 --> 26:33.180]  Yeah, they really are now because of your GMO Franken shot that created the mutants on
[26:33.180 --> 26:34.180]  record.
[26:34.180 --> 26:35.180]  I've shown all the graphs.
[26:35.180 --> 26:37.980]  So here it is.
[26:37.980 --> 26:44.940]  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated and it's caused by the fact that despite America
[26:44.940 --> 26:50.900]  having unprecedented and successful vaccination program, despite the fact that for almost
[26:50.900 --> 26:58.380]  five months, free vaccines have passed back in five seconds, please.
[26:58.380 --> 27:02.700]  Despite a successful vaccination program, you say 70% of adults have been injected at
[27:02.700 --> 27:03.700]  least once.
[27:03.700 --> 27:08.500]  Well, then why the hell is the record hospitalizations of the vaccinated?
[27:08.500 --> 27:12.020]  And they're lying and saying, Oh, if you've been vaccinated, you're a little safer.
[27:12.020 --> 27:13.020]  That's not true.
[27:13.020 --> 27:19.060]  Remember the Whopper a month ago, 99% of the people in the hospitals didn't have the shot
[27:19.060 --> 27:22.340]  and he used statistics from 2020 when no shots have been given.
[27:22.340 --> 27:24.420]  So it's a double lie.
[27:24.420 --> 27:29.620]  It's 100% of people in the hospital are unvaccinated because no one has been vaccinated, not 99.
[27:29.620 --> 27:30.620]  So he lies.
[27:30.620 --> 27:31.620]  It's like a double lie.
[27:31.620 --> 27:32.620]  How do you even do that?
[27:32.620 --> 27:35.540]  He could have said 100, but that wouldn't sound right.
[27:35.540 --> 27:38.420]  Oh, 99.
[27:38.420 --> 27:40.780]  They sit around in boardrooms and think up these lies.
[27:40.780 --> 27:43.140]  We're going to come back with a compilation on the other side.
[27:43.140 --> 27:46.500]  We'll just start over from the beginning and I'm going to try to shut up.
[27:46.500 --> 27:51.260]  You know, if you want to see me decipher the whole thing, I stayed up here late last night
[27:51.260 --> 27:57.660]  with a Zach, one of our great camera guys and researchers, and he was up till 1230 at
[27:57.660 --> 27:58.660]  night.
[27:58.660 --> 28:03.380]  This didn't get up actually until today and it's titled, it's up on info wars.com.
[28:03.380 --> 28:12.420]  Alex Jones responds to Joe Biden's declaration of war against America announcement of dictatorial
[28:12.420 --> 28:15.260]  powers forced injections.
[28:15.260 --> 28:19.740]  And it's the featured video at man dot video.
[28:19.740 --> 28:21.700]  And it's very, very well done.
[28:21.700 --> 28:22.700]  Yeah.
[28:22.700 --> 28:26.100]  The screenshot on the site is not actually from the video, but you can you can go see
[28:26.100 --> 28:27.100]  the video itself.
[28:27.100 --> 28:30.900]  Biden declares war on America announces dictatorial powers forced injections.
[28:30.900 --> 28:31.900]  Okay.
[28:31.900 --> 28:34.060]  So we're going to lay all this out.
[28:34.060 --> 28:36.180]  It's got 300,000 views.
[28:36.180 --> 28:38.500]  It needs 50 million if you want to be free.
[28:38.500 --> 28:42.020]  And if you get excited about it and share it and tell folks to share it on their email,
[28:42.020 --> 28:44.860]  on their text messages, word of mouth, it'll get tens of millions.
[28:44.860 --> 28:49.260]  I've had, I've had films seen a hundred million times plus.
[28:49.260 --> 28:52.260]  And that's when you get excited about it to spread the word.
[28:52.260 --> 28:58.940]  Hey, everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture, me too.
[28:58.940 --> 29:03.300]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[29:03.300 --> 29:05.980]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:05.980 --> 29:10.340]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:10.340 --> 29:12.060]  You probably already believe that.
[29:12.060 --> 29:13.220]  I certainly do.
[29:13.220 --> 29:14.220]  So here's the thing.
[29:14.220 --> 29:18.580]  If you wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[29:18.580 --> 29:23.820]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support, now you'll have to sign
[29:23.820 --> 29:28.420]  a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[29:28.420 --> 29:29.940]  No cures or treatments there.
[29:29.940 --> 29:34.420]  Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune
[29:34.420 --> 29:38.980]  support product based on that research called Immune10x.
[29:38.980 --> 29:39.980]  And the best part?

[29:52.700 --> 30:02.340]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[30:02.340 --> 30:07.900]  Not in Communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[30:07.900 --> 30:11.500]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[30:11.500 --> 30:13.220]  That's done by design.
[30:13.220 --> 30:19.260]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[30:19.260 --> 30:24.140]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral
[30:24.140 --> 30:29.300]  Commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[30:29.300 --> 30:33.900]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg Group didn't
[30:33.900 --> 30:34.900]  exist.
[30:34.900 --> 30:39.260]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public in its former head, shown in the steering committee,
[30:39.260 --> 30:43.980]  is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[30:43.980 --> 30:49.060]  And as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head-on about the fact
[30:49.060 --> 30:51.460]  that they are a worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover.
[30:51.460 --> 30:52.460]  We don't have a shot.
[30:52.460 --> 30:53.460]  We do expose them.
[30:53.460 --> 30:54.460]  We can beat them easily.
[30:54.460 --> 30:59.340]  Just a week ago, we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion back in stock, and it
[30:59.340 --> 31:04.260]  was only half of the order we wanted to get, but because we won't cut corners on the quality
[31:04.260 --> 31:08.740]  of what goes into it, the factory can only get limited supply, so again, it was half
[31:08.740 --> 31:09.740]  the order we wanted.
[31:09.740 --> 31:14.700]  But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33% off, so everybody on the fence will get

[31:38.220 --> 31:42.860]  But we have another great product, hair and beard formula, that's really a great multivitamin
[31:42.860 --> 31:46.660]  mineral system that's one of the best multivitamin mineral systems out there.

[31:50.420 --> 31:54.140]  It's great for women, great for children, but it's designed for men, infowarstore.com.
[31:54.140 --> 31:59.900]  Around the world, the general public has woken up the fact that this isn't a left or right
[31:59.900 --> 32:00.900]  issue.
[32:00.900 --> 32:07.620]  This is a global, corporate, a 10 to 21, a 10 to 30, great reset takeover.
[32:07.620 --> 32:10.060]  This is a technocracy.
[32:10.060 --> 32:15.540]  But very few leaders, Orban, Bolsonaro, and just a few others, are addressing it for what
[32:15.540 --> 32:23.180]  it is to their people, a foreign, anti-human, anti-family, anti-god takeover of the very
[32:23.180 --> 32:25.380]  biological system of humans.
[32:25.380 --> 32:30.060]  This is a corporate takeover of our bodies, of ourselves, with the World ID, the medical
[32:30.060 --> 32:32.860]  tracking system, that'll be tied to the carbon taxes.
[32:32.860 --> 32:33.860]  It's all been announced.
[32:33.860 --> 32:40.140]  It is a dystopic nightmare, and humanity is starting to organize, but our leaders aren't.
[32:40.140 --> 32:44.300]  We need Senator Paul and Senator Holley and others that have shown some understanding
[32:44.300 --> 32:50.180]  of this, and Senator Cruz, to organize against this foreign, multinational, corporate takeovers
[32:50.180 --> 33:20.100]  or big pharma, big banks, and big tech, or we have no hope.
[33:20.100 --> 33:26.620]  The globalists are betting on you being weak.
[33:26.620 --> 33:32.380]  The globalists are betting on you not having a memory, and not having a destiny to build
[33:32.380 --> 33:35.060]  a better world to stand up against them.
[33:35.060 --> 33:44.340]  They're counting on you to be like they are, selfish, and by only caring about yourself,
[33:44.340 --> 33:50.420]  they're able to take over the planet and set up a world where you really deserve to die.
[33:50.420 --> 33:53.220]  You deserve to be depopulated because you didn't really exist.
[33:53.220 --> 33:55.380]  Now, does that mean the globalists are good?
[33:55.380 --> 33:56.380]  No, they're bad.
[33:56.380 --> 34:01.260]  They're worse than people that are just lazy and decide to not really live.
[34:01.260 --> 34:08.300]  They understand the laws of nature and decide to use dirty tricks, black magic, corruption,
[34:08.300 --> 34:13.060]  the knowledge of evil against their fellow humans, and they lie to themselves and believe
[34:13.060 --> 34:19.580]  that they will escape the tyranny they've set up for us, but they will, history shows,
[34:19.580 --> 34:24.300]  be consumed by the traps they set for us.
[34:24.300 --> 34:29.820]  So Biden last year said, no, we're not going to have a federal mandate, it's unconstitutional.
[34:29.820 --> 34:36.820]  And Saki said that too, but now, he said that in December before he was even president,
[34:36.820 --> 34:45.100]  he didn't want to scare Americans that time, but he knew that there was a whole plan coming
[34:45.100 --> 34:46.580]  and he knew that it was a global agenda.
[34:46.580 --> 34:51.340]  So the most important thing you can know about this is the planetary agenda to shut down
[34:51.340 --> 34:54.620]  small businesses to make you obsolete, to get you to take a tractor system in your phone
[34:54.620 --> 34:56.500]  that'll be used for the carbon tax tracking.
[34:56.500 --> 34:59.980]  That's the real holy grail of this, but also to put in your body what they want, when they
[34:59.980 --> 35:02.900]  want for sterilization and depopulation.
[35:02.900 --> 35:08.060]  And I thought they'd put out a placebo type vaccine up front, so it wouldn't cause mutants,
[35:08.060 --> 35:11.820]  wouldn't cause autoimmune diseases, wouldn't cause heart attacks, because I said if they
[35:11.820 --> 35:16.300]  really put out a vaccine for the spike protein, it's going to be a disaster.
[35:16.300 --> 35:20.180]  That's what all the scientists were saying, the top scientists, now who's who, Nobel Prize
[35:20.180 --> 35:27.780]  winners and chief scientist at Pfizer and chief EU advisors, and it was ridiculous 16, 17,
[35:27.780 --> 35:28.780]  18 months ago.
[35:28.780 --> 35:33.740]  I said, well, I mean, obviously it's going to be a placebo, and we found in a lot of
[35:33.740 --> 35:39.140]  the U.S. and Europe, especially politicians and people and police and others, they're
[35:39.140 --> 35:45.700]  giving them sugar water, they're just giving them salt water, they're giving them fake
[35:45.700 --> 35:46.700]  shots.
[35:46.700 --> 35:51.980]  That's come out in the news, because the kill rate was so high, they decided to substitute
[35:51.980 --> 35:55.700]  a lot in there, because it was like, whoa, this kills way too many, it's okay to kill
[35:55.700 --> 35:59.580]  some to test and see if they put up with it, to test the media to make sure we can cover
[35:59.580 --> 36:02.980]  it up, this is all a big test, a beta test, Gates admits that.
[36:02.980 --> 36:14.260]  He said, now, 18 months ago, he said, on several shows, CBS, NBC, and on Stephen Colbert, he
[36:14.260 --> 36:22.540]  said, well, this has really just been a test, soon terrorists will release a bio weapon
[36:22.540 --> 36:27.980]  that kills many, many, many times what COVID-19 has, and of course, if you know about their
[36:27.980 --> 36:35.740]  code words, we are called terrorists to the earth and terrorists of the global future,
[36:35.740 --> 36:40.620]  like weevils caught in the pantry eating their flour or eating their grain, so we need to
[36:40.620 --> 36:47.420]  be exterminated like roaches or bull weevils, and so he says, the terrorists are about to
[36:47.420 --> 36:54.180]  release it, and now you've seen the Delta variant that is incredibly communicable, and
[36:54.180 --> 36:58.940]  if you don't get early treatment, it'll kill you, a lot of people, and so you go to the
[36:58.940 --> 37:03.740]  hospital, they just lay right down, they give you no medicine, and then you get pneumonia
[37:03.740 --> 37:08.980]  and you die, you're supposed to walk around, supposed to take ivermectin, supposed to take
[37:08.980 --> 37:13.180]  hydroxychloroquine, course it's supposed to take certain type of oral steroids, inhalable
[37:13.180 --> 37:19.380]  steroids, if that doesn't work, which it works 99% of the time, Regeneron, people hate Big
[37:19.380 --> 37:23.580]  Pharma so much, they're like, oh my god, Regeneron's evil, you must own stock in it, I just looked
[37:23.580 --> 37:26.900]  at the studies and know people that have taken it, and know it's a company around since
[37:26.900 --> 37:30.940]  88, and it doesn't have liability protection, and I understand the technology, they clone
[37:30.940 --> 37:36.780]  mouse white blood cells, and then put them in vats with COVID viruses and different variants
[37:36.780 --> 37:43.460]  and learn how to kill them, and then they put that into your body, and they just go and
[37:43.460 --> 37:47.860]  get it all, and then you pass them out of your body in two to three weeks.
[37:47.860 --> 37:50.540]  If you ask me, it's probably got some side effects down the road, but if you're gonna
[37:50.540 --> 37:56.580]  die, I'd do it, and they created 500 million doses of it, Trump paid for it with your tax
[37:56.580 --> 38:00.380]  money, and now Biden's trying to block red states from getting it and trying to do a
[38:00.380 --> 38:05.260]  litmus test, have you been vaccinated, that's in the news, just like they blocked all the
[38:05.260 --> 38:10.820]  other treatments, so Biden doesn't want you to have Regeneron, and the Eli Lilly one only
[38:10.820 --> 38:23.380]  has one of the antibodies, this one has two, so the word is Eli Lilly isn't working anymore,
[38:23.380 --> 38:28.500]  and so it's the Regeneron you want, and if they hold on to those 50 million, 500 million
[38:28.500 --> 38:31.700]  doses, it may stop working as well, but let me just stop and get into the meat potatoes,
[38:31.700 --> 38:37.740]  because we were supposed to get Robert Barnes on right now, I know a lot's going on back
[38:37.740 --> 38:42.420]  in the control room, but we're gonna shoot to get my guests on, I know a lot's going
[38:42.420 --> 38:47.860]  on, I know a lot's happening, but we'll see if he's still able to come on now, no big
[38:47.860 --> 38:54.460]  deal, but the key to freedom is having a memory, memory is everything, we're trained by the
[38:54.460 --> 38:59.220]  phones and the TVs have seven second, eight second attention span, so we're just to the
[38:59.220 --> 39:04.020]  next thing, the next thing, people work hard, myself included, but we forget things, don't
[39:04.020 --> 39:05.020]  we?
[39:05.020 --> 39:09.140]  Yes, we sure do, that's the nature of it, isn't it?
[39:09.140 --> 39:13.620]  So let's start going to the Biden clips, here is again a compilation, some of the nightmare
[39:13.620 --> 39:16.620]  things he declared yesterday.
[39:16.620 --> 39:23.660]  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, and it's caused by the fact that despite America
[39:23.660 --> 39:29.580]  having unprecedented and successful vaccination program, despite the fact that for almost
[39:29.580 --> 39:37.380]  five months, free vaccines have been available in 80,000 different locations, we still have
[39:37.380 --> 39:43.100]  nearly 80 million Americans who have failed to get the shot, this is not about freedom
[39:43.100 --> 39:49.340]  or personal choice, it's about protecting yourself and those around you, the people
[39:49.340 --> 39:55.140]  you work with, the people you care about, the people you love.
[39:55.140 --> 40:01.700]  My job as president is to protect all Americans, I'm announcing that the Department of Labor
[40:01.700 --> 40:09.300]  is developing an emergency rule to require all employers with 100 or more employees
[40:09.300 --> 40:18.620]  that together employ over 80 million workers to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated
[40:18.620 --> 40:22.140]  or show a negative test at least once a week.
[40:22.140 --> 40:31.020]  We've been patient, but our patience is wearing thin, and the refusal has cost all of us.
[40:31.020 --> 40:34.900]  You know, it's kind of fun for so much of the public to think I'm psychic, super psychic,
[40:34.900 --> 40:39.340]  we're all little psychic, and Nostradamus, but I always try to explain the card trick
[40:39.340 --> 40:45.300]  to people, they're following an exact script they've already tested in Europe, Australia,
[40:45.300 --> 40:50.820]  New Zealand, areas of Canada.
[40:50.820 --> 40:56.780]  And so I told you, next would be the mandate of the businesses, but oh, or you can do testing
[40:56.780 --> 41:02.540]  each week, and then in six months, maybe even a month, they're going to say, oh, you can't
[41:02.540 --> 41:07.460]  do the instant testing anymore, that's what's already happened in the UK and Australia.
[41:07.460 --> 41:12.780]  This is all formulaic, he's not in charge, his White House isn't in charge, they're just
[41:12.780 --> 41:16.780]  there to suppress their enemy, the American people, while they get ready for the financial
[41:16.780 --> 41:21.020]  collapse, the megabents have engineered, with a great reset, instead of them all going to
[41:21.020 --> 41:25.540]  jail for the huge Ponzi scheme, they will then say, oh, COVID caused it, break down, it's
[41:25.540 --> 41:29.220]  the new world, you're all going to get $1,200 a month of free money, and we're going to
[41:29.220 --> 41:32.940]  make the nouveau rich handover half their money, that means somebody making a half million
[41:32.940 --> 41:33.940]  dollars a year.
[41:33.940 --> 41:37.980]  But the billionaires and the Jeff Bezos's of the world and all the globalists, they're
[41:37.980 --> 41:40.940]  going to sit offshore and pay no taxes.
[41:40.940 --> 41:45.660]  So they're just getting you ready for the dystopia and shutting down businesses and
[41:45.660 --> 41:50.220]  paying people not to have businesses and destroying American businesses with these mandates, we're
[41:50.220 --> 41:55.020]  at the employees quit, the hospitals fall apart, that's how you deindustrialize people,
[41:55.020 --> 41:59.220]  and then they just get used to being in a depression and don't notice the hyperinflation
[41:59.220 --> 42:01.820]  of the currency that's already begun.
[42:01.820 --> 42:06.100]  9% increase in just the last three months in food prices, I have the articles right
[42:06.100 --> 42:07.100]  here.
[42:07.100 --> 42:12.340]  If you look back in the last year, it's over 15%, you see, it's accelerating, and they're
[42:12.340 --> 42:17.740]  making the food packages more air less food, and everything's costing more because they're
[42:17.740 --> 42:22.060]  devaluing the currencies, the big banks get the money first, they used to buy businesses,
[42:22.060 --> 42:27.780]  real assets, politicians, weapons systems, patents, you name it, and then they pass all
[42:27.780 --> 42:31.980]  of the debt onto you and the devalued currency, and then go, we don't even need the military
[42:31.980 --> 42:35.820]  anymore, we're going to have combat robots, because they'll follow orders.
[42:35.820 --> 42:41.500]  This is dystopia by design, UN World Corporate Takeover, and it gets worse.
[42:41.500 --> 42:45.180]  Roger Barrs, we got him on the line, he's coming up next, he was a 45 minutes constitutional
[42:45.180 --> 42:46.180]  lawyer.
[42:46.180 --> 42:47.180]  It gets worse.
[42:47.180 --> 42:54.260]  Biden says, oh, the next pandemic is about to happen, oh, of course it is.
[42:54.260 --> 42:57.860]  Biden and his corporate controllers are lying to you.
[42:57.860 --> 43:04.700]  This is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated, this is an engineered virus in a lab that
[43:04.700 --> 43:11.740]  they then injected into the public using their poison vaccine, so the body then created mutations
[43:11.740 --> 43:15.340]  that actually spread even worse, like the Delta variant.
[43:15.340 --> 43:20.980]  That is scientifically admitted, that is mainline science and not even debated, but the general
[43:20.980 --> 43:24.100]  public does not even know that.
[43:24.100 --> 43:31.420]  So when that criminal with his pedophile crackhead son gets up there on television and tells
[43:31.420 --> 43:37.620]  you that you are to blame because you didn't take your poison shot, that is a giant lie.
[43:37.620 --> 43:43.020]  Countries like Israel and Singapore with the highest vaccine rate, have the highest
[43:43.020 --> 43:47.220]  death and highest illness rates, that is the facts.
[43:47.220 --> 43:50.540]  Get that information out to your friends, family, and strangers, like your life depends
[43:50.540 --> 43:52.340]  on it, because it does.
[43:52.340 --> 43:57.140]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[43:57.140 --> 43:59.140]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[43:59.140 --> 44:04.780]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational,
[44:04.780 --> 44:05.780]  but we failed.
[44:05.780 --> 44:09.820]  Yes, a lot of people are awake, yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are
[44:09.820 --> 44:15.380]  going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization, great reset.
[44:15.380 --> 44:19.660]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[44:19.660 --> 44:24.260]  they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[44:24.260 --> 44:27.500]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, and
[44:27.500 --> 44:30.900]  we've also got to get personally prepared, and one of the number one things to do is
[44:30.900 --> 44:34.620]  high quality, storeable food, we've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable

[45:59.700 --> 46:00.700]  Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[46:00.700 --> 46:01.700]  Go ahead.
[46:01.700 --> 46:04.100]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your products.
[46:04.100 --> 46:09.620]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[46:09.620 --> 46:15.100]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[46:15.100 --> 46:21.060]  Since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[46:21.060 --> 46:27.140]  People think I'm 55 years old, and I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought,
[46:27.140 --> 46:30.900]  you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless
[46:30.900 --> 46:35.220]  situation, but when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but,
[46:35.220 --> 46:40.700]  you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket,
[46:40.700 --> 46:43.940]  this is working, this is wonderful, you know.
[46:43.940 --> 46:49.260]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully,
[46:49.260 --> 46:56.900]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[46:56.900 --> 47:11.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:11.020 --> 47:18.180]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[47:18.180 --> 47:22.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:22.020 --> 47:28.380]  Well, I don't say this with pride, I don't say it as a power trip, I say it as very
[47:28.380 --> 47:32.860]  ominous, because I know it makes me an even bigger target, but if you go on Instagram,
[47:32.860 --> 47:36.740]  Facebook, or Twitter, people send me this stuff, Joe Rogan sends it to me, you name it,
[47:36.740 --> 47:38.620]  not bragging, this is true.
[47:38.620 --> 47:45.580]  Wow, the whole world is Alex Jones now, wow, it's like Alex Jones' head is becoming the
[47:45.580 --> 47:51.380]  world, no, it's not Alex Jones, it's Paul Schwab, it's David Rockefeller's brain, because
[47:51.380 --> 47:57.100]  even though he's dead, it's his world, his dad's world, his grandfather's world, this
[47:57.100 --> 48:00.620]  is their vision, and they spent generations to build it.
[48:00.620 --> 48:05.700]  So the fight we had 120 years ago with the robber barons that, you know, Teddy Roosevelt
[48:05.700 --> 48:13.060]  put them in their place, to a great extent, is now the fight of them regrouping 115, 16
[48:13.060 --> 48:17.460]  years ago, when they really lost part of that fight, they went underground and took over
[48:17.460 --> 48:19.660]  society.
[48:19.660 --> 48:23.580]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes joins us to the bottom of the next hour, then Mike
[48:23.580 --> 48:29.300]  Adams is joining us as well, and Dr. Vladimir Zeb Zelinko, who's so amazing, talk about
[48:29.300 --> 48:33.140]  on target, because I know my stuff, he knows more than I do, when it comes just to politics
[48:33.140 --> 48:37.580]  at many levels, and how they're using Stockholm syndrome, that's coming up as well.
[48:37.580 --> 48:42.540]  But I wanted to get constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes on, because he filed lawsuits
[48:42.540 --> 48:46.260]  months ago, he filed lawsuits three weeks ago.
[48:46.260 --> 48:49.740]  And of course, then the FDA came out and said, oh, we've approved it.
[48:49.740 --> 48:53.260]  But they didn't approve it, and Barnes first exposed that.
[48:53.260 --> 48:58.220]  Now we have the two heads of the vaccine program quitting a week and a half ago, and saying,
[48:58.220 --> 49:01.700]  it's not over the booster like the media said, they actually said, you can find it even in
[49:01.700 --> 49:08.140]  Bloomberg, business pages, that we don't agree with saying this is an authorized vaccine,
[49:08.140 --> 49:11.580]  it didn't go through real trials, that couldn't happen until 2025.
[49:11.580 --> 49:16.460]  So that's the real reason, also shots for under 16 booster shots, they disagree with
[49:16.460 --> 49:17.540]  all of it.
[49:17.540 --> 49:24.580]  So now you got Biden that puppet, that they have put out there by himself, to push this
[49:24.580 --> 49:27.820]  globalist agenda, this is just incredible.
[49:27.820 --> 49:32.860]  So Barnes did file suits yesterday and last week with Robert Kennedy Jr. and others against
[49:32.860 --> 49:37.620]  this, because again, they changed the lands, they had to refile the suits.
[49:37.620 --> 49:41.140]  But in a way, Barnes has told me on the phone that it's even better, it's more ridiculous
[49:41.140 --> 49:42.140]  what they've done.
[49:42.140 --> 49:46.900]  So to lay out the speech, to lay out the way to fight back, to lay out the incredible
[49:46.900 --> 49:53.380]  bizarreness of Biden, exempting 600,000 postal workers and other certain people, the White
[49:53.380 --> 49:57.660]  House, I mean, talk about discriminatory, talk about unjust weights and measures.
[49:57.660 --> 50:00.500]  This is just screams injustice.
[50:00.500 --> 50:04.540]  So we're going to walk through all of it, play more clips, the next hour, we're going
[50:04.540 --> 50:08.580]  to open up with him saying, oh, what a new pandemic is coming, believe me.
[50:08.580 --> 50:13.820]  We know they've engineered new stuff and we know the vaccines cause the Delta variant.
[50:13.820 --> 50:18.300]  That's a fact, just like too much antibiotics creates a mutated bacteria.
[50:18.300 --> 50:19.300]  This is science.
[50:19.300 --> 50:21.220]  So this is an incredible moment.
[50:21.220 --> 50:23.300]  What would you call what Biden did?
[50:23.300 --> 50:27.660]  My headline today for M4 Wars for the show is President Biden has officially established
[50:27.660 --> 50:31.220]  a federal dictatorship, Friday emergency broadcast.
[50:31.220 --> 50:35.820]  Is that not accurate or what would you call these measures, Robert Barnes?
[50:35.820 --> 50:41.820]  Well, I mean, it's, it's unprecedented, unparalleled, I mean, he basically asserted complete control
[50:41.820 --> 50:48.460]  and authority over local governments, complete control and authority over local employers.
[50:48.460 --> 50:50.260]  Without any restriction or without any restraint.
[50:50.260 --> 50:54.460]  I mean, basically he said if governor's getting it in his way, he's just going to ignore them.
[50:54.460 --> 50:57.380]  If the legislative branch gets in the way, he's going to ignore them.
[50:57.380 --> 51:01.740]  I mean, this is what he did with the CDC mandate, where he said, yeah, I know it's unconstitutional,
[51:01.740 --> 51:03.780]  but let the courts do something about it.
[51:03.780 --> 51:07.700]  And by the time they do something about it, I'll got the remedy that I wanted anyway.
[51:07.700 --> 51:12.100]  And so what he's mostly banking on is the idea that neither the state governors nor
[51:12.100 --> 51:16.220]  more importantly, the federal courts will push back on this.
[51:16.220 --> 51:19.700]  And I think that's the sort of frightening and terrifying thing is that we are to a place
[51:19.700 --> 51:23.020]  where they're ordering an experimental drug, and that's what this is.
[51:23.020 --> 51:29.100]  And it still is legally, the vaccine is not widely available as the FDA has admitted.
[51:29.100 --> 51:33.620]  We filed suit in the Eastern District of Tennessee with Bobby Kennedy and others for children's
[51:33.620 --> 51:34.620]  health defense.
[51:34.620 --> 51:40.420]  We have a stay motion pending before the court to make clear to the world that in fact, they,
[51:40.420 --> 51:45.580]  the authorized vaccine, the approved vaccine is not available at all.
[51:45.580 --> 51:49.980]  So if people are being required to take is still the experimental emergency use authorized
[51:49.980 --> 51:53.980]  drug, which has, which if there's anything wrong with it, there's nothing you can do
[51:53.980 --> 51:56.420]  about it because you can't sue anybody.
[51:56.420 --> 51:58.060]  It has complete immunity.
[51:58.060 --> 52:02.940]  The only immunity this vaccine provides is immunity from suit if they did something wrong
[52:02.940 --> 52:04.140]  and lied to you.
[52:04.140 --> 52:08.380]  There is that it's not providing functional health immunity as we are seeing in Israel
[52:08.380 --> 52:12.500]  as we are seeing in Gibraltar as we are seeing in Iceland as we are seeing in Europe as we
[52:12.500 --> 52:14.540]  are seeing across America.
[52:14.540 --> 52:20.180]  I mean, how is it that if this vaccine is so good for us, we're seeing higher death
[52:20.180 --> 52:23.700]  rates in some places than we did last year when there were no vaccine?
[52:23.700 --> 52:24.700]  How does that make any sense?
[52:24.700 --> 52:25.700]  Well, let's be clear.
[52:25.700 --> 52:27.220]  It's approaching and it's real numbers, folks.
[52:27.220 --> 52:29.220]  I've seen it with my family, my crew, all over the country.
[52:29.220 --> 52:30.220]  It's bad.
[52:30.220 --> 52:31.500]  The Delta variant is real.
[52:31.500 --> 52:36.500]  It's almost a 400% increase in illnesses and cases from last year.
[52:36.500 --> 52:41.900]  I mean, and again, mainline scientists, you know, Barnes admits that the vaccines created
[52:41.900 --> 52:43.060]  the Delta variant.
[52:43.060 --> 52:48.460]  So when the public president tries to divide America and says it's the unvaccinated, you're
[52:48.460 --> 52:51.500]  causing death, you're bad people, that's not just a lie.
[52:51.500 --> 52:53.060]  He's trying to get people killed.
[52:53.060 --> 52:54.060]  Yeah, absolutely.
[52:54.060 --> 52:57.260]  And this is a legal precedent that is unparalleled.
[52:57.260 --> 53:02.100]  I mean, even the eugenics era limited who they said they were going to exterminate or
[53:02.100 --> 53:05.140]  get rid of or limit from population perspective.
[53:05.140 --> 53:09.140]  Going back to the buck decision that in the Jacobson case, the forced vaccination case
[53:09.140 --> 53:14.500]  was the only precedent establishing the precedent for forced sterilizations and then of course
[53:14.500 --> 53:19.020]  the forced detention camps in Korematsu, which I've called the Trilogy of Infamy.
[53:19.020 --> 53:23.380]  What they're trying to establish is something they have never tried before, which is the
[53:23.380 --> 53:30.340]  right of the government to force you to take some gene therapy into your body against your
[53:30.340 --> 53:35.940]  will, against your interest for a disease that's simply not very deadly to most people.
[53:35.940 --> 53:40.660]  And if they are allowed to establish this precedent, then the government basically owns your body.
[53:40.660 --> 53:45.980]  You will no longer have legal control, legal autonomy over what goes into your cells, what
[53:45.980 --> 53:50.420]  goes into your bloodstream, whether or not your DNA is altered or not.
[53:50.420 --> 53:54.860]  If you don't have a right against this vaccine, you don't have a right against any drug, any
[53:54.860 --> 53:56.940]  time, anywhere, any place.
[53:56.940 --> 53:57.940]  Which let's go further.
[53:57.940 --> 54:01.980]  What do you make of the FDA yesterday or two days ago now quietly changing the definition
[54:01.980 --> 54:07.340]  of a vaccine to basically any gene therapy they put in you that, that quote, lessens
[54:07.340 --> 54:08.340]  the effect?
[54:08.340 --> 54:09.340]  Absolutely.
[54:09.340 --> 54:12.540]  This is not a vaccine by any historic definition at all.
[54:12.540 --> 54:19.860]  A vaccine is a sterilizing, neutralizing drug that actually prevents and immunizes against
[54:19.860 --> 54:20.860]  a disease.
[54:20.860 --> 54:23.060]  This does not do that.
[54:23.060 --> 54:26.580]  That's clear in the, actually it's clear in the literature, but it's particularly clear
[54:26.580 --> 54:28.980]  in all of the studies and the example of Israel.
[54:28.980 --> 54:33.460]  What is the country that has done the most Pfizer vaccines as a percentage of the population
[54:33.460 --> 54:38.780]  of any country in the world, and it has had the worst outbreak of COVID and the most excess
[54:38.780 --> 54:41.780]  deaths that it has ever had during this time period?
[54:41.780 --> 54:45.740]  There's an overhead shot right here, Robert, of what you're saying.
[54:45.740 --> 54:46.740]  Yeah, exactly.
[54:46.740 --> 54:51.660]  I mean, it's, if you just look at the chart, look at Sweden, where Sweden is, chart goes
[54:51.660 --> 54:56.940]  like this, Sweden's not mandating vaccines, Sweden's not mandating masks, Sweden never
[54:56.940 --> 54:59.500]  locked down, and look at what Sweden's got.
[54:59.500 --> 55:05.540]  Sweden's got just a flat line of excess deaths in new cases, and Israel's going room parabolic,
[55:05.540 --> 55:06.540]  and it's absurd.
[55:06.540 --> 55:09.100]  And by the way, it's the same all over the world.
[55:09.100 --> 55:12.980]  The more vaccinated, you're like 10, 15 times the deaths and illnesses.
[55:12.980 --> 55:13.980]  It's ridiculous.
[55:13.980 --> 55:15.980]  I don't need to be a scientist to see that.
[55:15.980 --> 55:18.260]  Oh, India's 10% vaccinated.
[55:18.260 --> 55:19.260]  Same graph.
[55:19.260 --> 55:20.340]  They're way down here.
[55:20.340 --> 55:22.980]  All the countries that are injected, the U.S. everywhere, way up.
[55:22.980 --> 55:25.140]  My God, this is insane, Barnes.
[55:25.140 --> 55:28.620]  And by the way, all over the world, within two weeks of taking the shot, you see all
[55:28.620 --> 55:29.620]  the deaths and hospitalization.
[55:29.620 --> 55:33.820]  I mean, it's like you walk up, shoot somebody in the head, blood squirts out of their head.
[55:33.820 --> 55:38.300]  You don't need to be a coroner or a pathologist to know the bullet killed them.
[55:38.300 --> 55:42.180]  If I walk up to somebody and shoot them with a 12-gauge shotgun and blow their head off,
[55:42.180 --> 55:45.460]  it's clear a freaking 12-gauge double-lock buck did that.
[55:45.460 --> 55:50.500]  Same thing, take the shot, hospitalizations, illness explode, deadly variants explode.
[55:50.500 --> 55:51.500]  Absolutely.
[55:51.500 --> 55:56.340]  I mean, Richard Barris just did extensive surveys looking at the population, and almost
[55:56.340 --> 56:04.740]  4% of Americans report severe, serious, disabling, long-term consequences from the vaccine, not
[56:04.740 --> 56:06.340]  from the virus from the vaccine.
[56:06.340 --> 56:09.180]  This doesn't include, obviously, the people who have already died from it.
[56:09.180 --> 56:10.180]  So what that is that.
[56:10.180 --> 56:11.180]  And I saw those findings.
[56:11.180 --> 56:12.180]  I want the crew to pull them up.
[56:12.180 --> 56:14.900]  We're going to come back with this in a few minutes, but tell people again the name of
[56:14.900 --> 56:17.740]  the researcher and what they found very slowly.
[56:17.740 --> 56:18.740]  Sure.
[56:18.740 --> 56:21.860]  So this is Richard Barris, people's pundit.
[56:21.860 --> 56:28.220]  He was the most accurate pollster in 2014, the most accurate pollster in 2016, the most
[56:28.220 --> 56:33.620]  accurate pollster in 2018, the most accurate pollster in 2020.
[56:33.620 --> 56:39.500]  And using the CDC's own data, he was the first one to do a nationwide survey asking people
[56:39.500 --> 56:44.980]  whether they have had this certain consequences either from the virus or from the vaccine.
[56:44.980 --> 56:52.100]  And what he found was that almost 4% of Americans already report severe, disabling consequences
[56:52.100 --> 56:54.620]  from the vaccine, not from the virus.
[56:54.620 --> 57:00.860]  And if you look at that, you're talking about that's 6 million, 7 million, 8 million Americans.
[57:00.860 --> 57:06.060]  That means that for the average person, they are far more at risk of suffering imminent
[57:06.060 --> 57:09.820]  injury from the vaccine than they are from the virus.
[57:09.820 --> 57:14.760]  And this doesn't even get into the long-term risk, which is disproportionately on the side
[57:14.760 --> 57:15.940]  of the vaccine.
[57:15.940 --> 57:20.540]  So it shows that an ordinary person's health risk-benefit analysis should not be getting
[57:20.540 --> 57:25.180]  this vaccine, and yet we have a president forcing it into people's bodies as a condition
[57:25.180 --> 57:26.180]  of employment.
[57:26.180 --> 57:28.660]  We're going to break right now, but look at the Jerusalem Post.
[57:28.660 --> 57:30.860]  Think of the Orwellian nature of this headline.
[57:30.860 --> 57:35.260]  Israel experts analyze mRNA COVID vaccines' long-term effects.
[57:35.260 --> 57:36.700]  They didn't do the studies.
[57:36.700 --> 57:37.700]  Now they're seeing it.
[57:37.700 --> 57:39.020]  It's the same with pregnant women.
[57:39.020 --> 57:40.700]  It's killing 80 plus percent of the babies.
[57:40.700 --> 57:46.140]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[57:46.140 --> 57:47.140]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[57:47.140 --> 57:49.580]  Monday at midnight, we've got to end this sale.
[57:49.580 --> 57:54.300]  We may end it earlier, because we think it will sell out by then at current sales rates.
[57:54.300 --> 57:55.860]  Vitamin mineral fusion is super popular.
[57:55.860 --> 57:58.820]  It's got all the high-quality vitamins and minerals that are essential.
[57:58.820 --> 58:00.460]  Great amino acids, and it tastes great.
[58:00.460 --> 58:05.380]  It's powder formed, so in the water, you absorb it more when you drink the fruit punch.
[58:05.380 --> 58:09.220]  Then we also have, back in stock, this sale will continue through next week, knockout
[58:09.220 --> 58:12.980]  sleep aid with eight organic ingredients that help you sleep better.
[58:12.980 --> 58:17.580]  It's 50 percent off, and ultra-12 of our best sellers, high-quality vitamin B12 for your
[58:17.580 --> 58:20.900]  whole body, your stamina, your albedo, your energy, your immune system.

[58:25.620 --> 58:30.540]  So get your vitamin mineral fusion while you still can at infowarstore.com for 33 percent
[58:30.540 --> 58:34.980]  off, and a bunch of the other supplements are 50 percent off as well throughout next
[58:34.980 --> 58:41.740]  week, but the sale of vitamin mineral fusion ends Monday night, so get yours now.
[58:41.740 --> 58:48.620]  In late August, infowar saw an explosion of orders, because our audience understands that
[58:48.620 --> 58:54.860]  the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[58:54.860 --> 58:57.980]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[58:57.980 --> 59:01.220]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[59:01.220 --> 59:02.220]  have.
[59:02.220 --> 59:06.700]  There are lots that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[59:06.700 --> 59:08.980]  self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[59:08.980 --> 59:12.380]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.
[59:12.380 --> 59:15.740]  Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[59:15.740 --> 59:21.180]  It's high-quality, it's very, very low-cost at infowarstore.com, because in the future,
[59:21.180 --> 59:25.620]  you're going to see more food supply shortages, and you're going to see food supply price increases
[59:25.620 --> 59:27.140]  that are already taking place.
[59:27.140 --> 59:32.140]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price, and fund the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[59:32.140 --> 59:37.260]  That's how you fight the great reset, is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[59:37.260 --> 59:38.260]  control.
[59:38.260 --> 59:44.860]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[59:44.860 --> 59:49.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:49.820 --> 1:00:04.540]  All right, we got cut off by the break, Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer with Robert Kennedy
[1:00:04.540 --> 1:00:06.060]  filing suits around the country.
[1:00:06.060 --> 1:00:09.780]  He's going to talk about the avalanche of suits we're going to see now, how can Biden
[1:00:09.780 --> 1:00:12.340]  exempt some federal employees and not others.
[1:00:12.340 --> 1:00:14.100]  This is the definition of discriminatory.
[1:00:14.100 --> 1:00:18.700]  So while they have us chasing our tails about Black Lives Matter and transgender men being
[1:00:18.700 --> 1:00:24.060]  able to go in women's bathrooms, when they're convicted sex offenders, all those faux rights,
[1:00:24.060 --> 1:00:28.780]  all of our basic rights are being raped, the surveillance of the system, the control of
[1:00:28.780 --> 1:00:33.340]  it, the federalization of local cities, the blocking of governors, I mean, this was like
[1:00:33.340 --> 1:00:38.460]  something out of a science fiction, dystopic film, and now Israel's saying, we're now going
[1:00:38.460 --> 1:00:43.180]  to start studies of the long-term effects of this on the public of mRNA admitting they
[1:00:43.180 --> 1:00:44.540]  did no testing.
[1:00:44.540 --> 1:00:46.940]  So not safe and effective, folks.
[1:00:46.940 --> 1:00:51.660]  This is like suicidal self-destructiveness by Big Pharma, in my view, because they're
[1:00:51.660 --> 1:00:55.100]  trying to eat the whole world like a bubble constrictor.
[1:00:55.100 --> 1:00:58.780]  But even with their jaw unhinged, they're not going to get a third of this down.
[1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:00.340]  They have bitten off more than they can chew.
[1:01:00.340 --> 1:01:01.340]  Do you agree?
[1:01:01.340 --> 1:01:02.340]  Yeah, no doubt.
[1:01:02.340 --> 1:01:07.140]  I mean, what's extraordinary is they're actually bragging in their internal reports about the
[1:01:07.140 --> 1:01:12.020]  fact that the vaccine doesn't fully work, means that they have doesn't work in the way
[1:01:12.020 --> 1:01:16.260]  that Joe Biden, President Biden said it would, said that if you took the vaccine, you could
[1:01:16.260 --> 1:01:21.260]  not get infected, that because it does not work like that at all, that's what guarantees
[1:01:21.260 --> 1:01:23.020]  them long-term profits from this.
[1:01:23.020 --> 1:01:24.580]  So all they're looking at is the profits.
[1:01:24.580 --> 1:01:25.580]  They know there's no risk.
[1:01:25.580 --> 1:01:31.860]  It doesn't matter how much their vaccine completely backfires, because they can't be sued, especially
[1:01:31.860 --> 1:01:34.220]  while it's in the emergency use authorization stage.
[1:01:34.220 --> 1:01:38.220]  And that's what all of these are, contrary to what the FDA misled people about.
[1:01:38.220 --> 1:01:43.140]  I mean, the FDA is out there advertising on Facebook and elsewhere saying, come get the
[1:01:43.140 --> 1:01:45.460]  FDA-approved vaccine.
[1:01:45.460 --> 1:01:48.420]  But you dig in and you find out that isn't even available.
[1:01:48.420 --> 1:01:49.420]  It's a bait and switch.
[1:01:49.420 --> 1:01:52.100]  And we'll talk about that next segment, but let me back you up.
[1:01:52.100 --> 1:01:53.100]  It's not just internal documents.
[1:01:53.100 --> 1:01:57.060]  I've read a bunch of it and seen David Bauer that heads up the COVID program at the top
[1:01:57.060 --> 1:01:59.020]  British Milo Weapons Lab.
[1:01:59.020 --> 1:02:00.020]  He's on there bragging.
[1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:02.900]  He also works for Pfizer that, oh, this gets rid of your immunity.
[1:02:02.900 --> 1:02:04.860]  You'll need shots for the rest of your life.
[1:02:04.860 --> 1:02:08.580]  And smiling about it, they're admitting it's a business model.
[1:02:08.580 --> 1:02:09.580]  Absolutely.
[1:02:09.580 --> 1:02:13.540]  And I mean, they're not only going to be doing booster shots, they're talking about doing
[1:02:13.540 --> 1:02:16.140]  a daily pill regimen.
[1:02:16.140 --> 1:02:21.300]  So I mean, this is just, this is big pharma taking over your body at the will and behest
[1:02:21.300 --> 1:02:27.300]  in behalf of the government through your private employers by government mandates to have,
[1:02:27.300 --> 1:02:28.300]  to basically own your body.
[1:02:28.300 --> 1:02:31.060]  I mean, you're basically now a living guinea pig.
[1:02:31.060 --> 1:02:36.500]  You're now a living lab rat for the government to do with whatever they want, whenever they
[1:02:36.500 --> 1:02:37.500]  want.
[1:02:37.500 --> 1:02:41.780]  And because if they can do it for this circumstance, they can do it for any circumstance.
[1:02:41.780 --> 1:02:44.120]  Because here you have a virus that's not that deadly.
[1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:47.660]  You have a vaccine that they has all kinds of risk attendant to it.
[1:02:47.660 --> 1:02:51.700]  And so if they can compel this one, then by golly, they can do anything they want.
[1:02:51.700 --> 1:02:56.180]  Then up next will be the rest of the Bill Gates agenda, the, the digital certification,
[1:02:56.180 --> 1:03:00.300]  the digital identification, the digital, the little bank chip, the social credit score
[1:03:00.300 --> 1:03:04.100]  that will basically be inside your body, which they were, the government will decide what
[1:03:04.100 --> 1:03:05.100]  you get to do.
[1:03:05.100 --> 1:03:08.300]  What you get is officially being rolled out in areas of Europe and Australia, and they
[1:03:08.300 --> 1:03:09.380]  admit coming here.
[1:03:09.380 --> 1:03:12.100]  This is no longer debatable.
[1:03:12.100 --> 1:03:13.100]  Absolutely.
[1:03:13.100 --> 1:03:16.700]  I mean, people should watch what's happening in Australia, New Zealand, these other locations,
[1:03:16.700 --> 1:03:20.900]  because they're previews of what they're testing out there to bring here.
[1:03:20.900 --> 1:03:23.980]  Because a lot of us, when we watched what happened in China last year, thought, we'll
[1:03:23.980 --> 1:03:26.180]  never do any of that insanity.
[1:03:26.180 --> 1:03:29.940]  Even the Imperial College guy in London, who, who was the Bill Gates guy putting out all
[1:03:29.940 --> 1:03:34.660]  those crazy models, he said, we could never get away with doing what the Chinese did because
[1:03:34.660 --> 1:03:36.820]  no way in the West will they go along with it.
[1:03:36.820 --> 1:03:40.500]  That's what teams from Australia to Ireland, to areas of Canada and the US are dragging
[1:03:40.500 --> 1:03:42.620]  people out of their houses.
[1:03:42.620 --> 1:03:43.620]  That's exactly right.
[1:03:43.620 --> 1:03:44.620]  I mean, they're monitoring.
[1:03:44.620 --> 1:03:49.380]  They have helicopters and drones monitoring whether you're doing a barbecue in your backyard.
[1:03:49.380 --> 1:03:52.020]  They're intercepting beer coming to your house.
[1:03:52.020 --> 1:03:55.100]  They don't want your, I mean, they're going to dictate, I mean, literally we're under
[1:03:55.100 --> 1:03:59.180]  mass house arrest is what, is what has happened in Australia, New Zealand, it's what's coming
[1:03:59.180 --> 1:04:00.180]  here.
[1:04:00.180 --> 1:04:02.420]  It's they, they're going to own our bodies and then they're going to own everything
[1:04:02.420 --> 1:04:05.460]  else related to us because once they own that, they own everything.
[1:04:05.460 --> 1:04:09.660]  And that's why the fight about this is the foundational fundamental fight for the future
[1:04:09.660 --> 1:04:11.220]  of freedom in the world.
[1:04:11.220 --> 1:04:14.260]  What happens now will dictate the next century.
[1:04:14.260 --> 1:04:17.420]  I want to talk about the speech, which we know is the globalist talking points.
[1:04:17.420 --> 1:04:22.420]  It's, Biden is just a puppet, but how you see this fight unfolding and why you think
[1:04:22.420 --> 1:04:26.380]  the establishment is going for broke is because they never get held accountable because clearly
[1:04:26.380 --> 1:04:31.700]  if the Supreme Court did the obvious right thing was very clear and said, no, CDC can't
[1:04:31.700 --> 1:04:33.260]  federalize all rents.
[1:04:33.260 --> 1:04:35.620]  Well, this is way beyond that.
[1:04:35.620 --> 1:04:37.020]  So what are they thinking?
[1:04:37.020 --> 1:04:41.580]  I mean, I guess they just think claws, much as they can get because we are their enemy.
[1:04:41.580 --> 1:04:43.780]  Distract us politically from all the other crimes that committing.
[1:04:43.780 --> 1:04:46.260]  We'll be back in 60 seconds with Robert Barnes.
[1:04:46.260 --> 1:04:51.460]  Tell folks to tune in now.
[1:04:51.460 --> 1:04:55.940]  Just a week ago, we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion back in stock and
[1:04:55.940 --> 1:04:58.740]  it was only half of the order we wanted to get.
[1:04:58.740 --> 1:05:03.220]  But because we won't cut corners on the quality of what goes into it, the factory can only
[1:05:03.220 --> 1:05:04.220]  get limited supplies.
[1:05:04.220 --> 1:05:06.500]  So again, it was half the order we wanted.
[1:05:06.500 --> 1:05:09.900]  But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33% off.
[1:05:09.900 --> 1:05:11.940]  So everybody on the fence will get it.
[1:05:11.940 --> 1:05:15.420]  It's critical for your immune system and your whole body, all the essential vitamins, all
[1:05:15.420 --> 1:05:19.500]  the essential minerals and a bunch of key amino acids at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:24.860]  So while supplies last until it runs out, we're selling it for 33% off and it'll be
[1:05:24.860 --> 1:05:26.740]  months till more comes in.
[1:05:26.740 --> 1:05:31.420]  So get yours today at infowarstore.com because it's not just a great product.
[1:05:31.420 --> 1:05:33.540]  We need those funds to keep operating as well.
[1:05:33.540 --> 1:05:34.940]  We're all in it occasionally too.
[1:05:34.940 --> 1:05:39.620]  But we have another great product, hair and beard formula that's really a great multivitamin
[1:05:39.620 --> 1:05:43.420]  mineral system that's one of the best multivitamin mineral systems out there.
[1:05:43.420 --> 1:05:45.420]  It's just called hair and beard.
[1:05:45.420 --> 1:05:47.180]  So get that as well for your immune system.
[1:05:47.180 --> 1:06:01.740]  It's great for women, great for children, but it's designed for men in infowarstore.com.
[1:06:01.740 --> 1:06:14.500]  We now take you live to America under a corporate medical dictatorship.
[1:06:14.500 --> 1:06:27.500]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance.
[1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:31.900]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:06:31.900 --> 1:06:33.420]  Here's the biggest takeaway in my view.
[1:06:33.420 --> 1:06:38.580]  If you think what Biden announced yesterday, a federal dictatorship was bad, oh, you know
[1:06:38.580 --> 1:06:42.540]  the song, baby, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[1:06:42.540 --> 1:06:43.980]  I know what's going to happen.
[1:06:43.980 --> 1:06:46.380]  These globalists are committed.
[1:06:46.380 --> 1:06:50.660]  They are trying to collapse civilization and depopulate, and they mean to carry this out.
[1:06:50.660 --> 1:06:54.180]  I remember reading New York Times articles 10 years ago where they were defending the
[1:06:54.180 --> 1:06:58.820]  UN going into a Central African village and killing 15,000 people because they wouldn't
[1:06:58.820 --> 1:07:04.420]  move off their ancestral lands for a carbon sink because they were going to build a mine
[1:07:04.420 --> 1:07:10.580]  nearby, a corporation was, so they said, oh, we'll just set this aside for a carbon offset.
[1:07:10.580 --> 1:07:16.020]  When the villagers wouldn't leave, they killed them with helicopters and armored vehicles.
[1:07:16.020 --> 1:07:19.420]  And the New York Times reported it like, well, it's good.
[1:07:19.420 --> 1:07:25.540]  So understand when they cut off things last year at starve and extra 20 million people
[1:07:25.540 --> 1:07:30.460]  to death that you admit, they want to kill everybody.
[1:07:30.460 --> 1:07:35.820]  That's why you see nothing but black spokesperson for big corporations and TV shows.
[1:07:35.820 --> 1:07:39.660]  And I saw four black people on MSNBC last night.
[1:07:39.660 --> 1:07:41.900]  All lecturing is we should take the shots so we're bad.
[1:07:41.900 --> 1:07:45.500]  It's corporations using them as their front while they kill them.
[1:07:45.500 --> 1:07:48.500]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, is our guest.
[1:07:48.500 --> 1:07:51.660]  I really don't need to play more Clebson Biden, though there's one I haven't gotten to.
[1:07:51.660 --> 1:07:56.980]  But his declaration of war, his announcement that the unvaccinated are killing people when
[1:07:56.980 --> 1:07:57.980]  it's the opposite.
[1:07:57.980 --> 1:07:58.980]  The numbers are there.
[1:07:58.980 --> 1:08:02.380]  It's the vaccinated that are sick and dying, and spreading the Delta variant.
[1:08:02.380 --> 1:08:06.100]  Barnes, I could ask a thousand questions, but the 25 minutes we have left, I'm going
[1:08:06.100 --> 1:08:09.860]  to try to give you the floor and shut up here and let you go through the suit should follow
[1:08:09.860 --> 1:08:14.620]  Robert Kennedy, what you make of Biden, what you think people should do, what the recourses
[1:08:14.620 --> 1:08:20.340]  are, and what you think the most important takeaway last night in that unprecedented,
[1:08:20.340 --> 1:08:23.100]  as you said last hour, declaration of tyranny.
[1:08:23.100 --> 1:08:27.540]  Well, I think it's critical for everybody to fight back by every means possible.
[1:08:27.540 --> 1:08:31.220]  I mean, we are seeing right now, Senate candidate J.B.
[1:08:31.220 --> 1:08:36.980]  Vance asking people to engage in massive civil disobedience on a scale of the civil rights
[1:08:36.980 --> 1:08:39.900]  movement of the 1950s and 1960s.
[1:08:39.900 --> 1:08:44.580]  So I think on a scale of the American Revolution, I mean, American Revolution began by people
[1:08:44.580 --> 1:08:49.020]  just exercising their civil rights of political dissidents and not going along with these
[1:08:49.020 --> 1:08:50.020]  kind of...
[1:08:50.020 --> 1:08:53.700]  We need to do what Chris Sky and others are doing, what they're doing in Europe when Robert
[1:08:53.700 --> 1:08:55.580]  Kennedy Jr. speaks to a million Germans.
[1:08:55.580 --> 1:08:58.060]  We need to take the streets over peacefully.
[1:08:58.060 --> 1:08:59.060]  Absolutely.
[1:08:59.060 --> 1:09:04.860]  I mean, people need to find every legal means they can to resist because these means being
[1:09:04.860 --> 1:09:10.140]  used by the Biden administration are not constitutionally consistent or not legally authorized.
[1:09:10.140 --> 1:09:11.300]  I mean, look at this.
[1:09:11.300 --> 1:09:17.740]  He's using a loophole in the OSHA laws that are about emergency safety issues.
[1:09:17.740 --> 1:09:19.900]  This is not an emergency safety issue.
[1:09:19.900 --> 1:09:22.980]  It's ludicrous to call this an emergency safety issue.
[1:09:22.980 --> 1:09:24.260]  That's problem number one.
[1:09:24.260 --> 1:09:32.380]  Problem number two is the rules require that this be of grave danger, and let's remember
[1:09:32.380 --> 1:09:33.460]  what this is all about.
[1:09:33.460 --> 1:09:38.460]  All these mask mandates, all these vaccine mandates are solely about the limited risk
[1:09:38.460 --> 1:09:42.900]  that an asymptomatic person, because if you're symptomatic, you stay home.
[1:09:42.900 --> 1:09:43.900]  You self-quarantine.
[1:09:43.900 --> 1:09:46.340]  If you've been exposed to somebody, you stay home.
[1:09:46.340 --> 1:09:47.500]  You self-quarantine.
[1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:52.380]  So this is only dealing with people who are showing no symptoms and haven't been exposed
[1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:53.380]  at all.
[1:09:53.380 --> 1:09:58.260]  So it's dealing with asymptomatic people with even crouchy admits that, in fact, those
[1:09:58.260 --> 1:10:02.700]  people do not spread the virus at all, that it is, quote, very rare, even according to
[1:10:02.700 --> 1:10:03.700]  Fauci.
[1:10:03.700 --> 1:10:07.940]  So for this very rare risk, they're calling a grave imminent danger.
[1:10:07.940 --> 1:10:10.180]  There's no factual basis for this at all.
[1:10:10.180 --> 1:10:15.380]  This is the Biden administration dictating to its supposedly independent OSHA people
[1:10:15.380 --> 1:10:16.380]  what to do.
[1:10:16.380 --> 1:10:19.420]  And they're just making things up, just like the FDA did.
[1:10:19.420 --> 1:10:23.580]  The suit we have pending, it's the FDA, that we have a motion to stay before a federal
[1:10:23.580 --> 1:10:29.300]  court asking the federal court to recognize the obvious that, in fact, there is no vaccine
[1:10:29.300 --> 1:10:33.580]  that's been approved that's also widely available by the FDA's own admission.
[1:10:33.580 --> 1:10:36.020]  It's buried in their footnotes in the small print.
[1:10:36.020 --> 1:10:40.580]  And force the FDA to quit lying to the American people, quit lying to the military, quit lying
[1:10:40.580 --> 1:10:41.740]  to employers.
[1:10:41.740 --> 1:10:45.340]  How hard can that be to just stop them from lying?
[1:10:45.340 --> 1:10:48.820]  That's all we're asking federal courts to do, because in the end, this will come up
[1:10:48.820 --> 1:10:49.820]  to federal courts.
[1:10:49.820 --> 1:10:55.140]  Either they are going to enforce our Constitution or the coronavirus and Joe Biden just killed
[1:10:55.140 --> 1:10:56.140]  it.
[1:10:56.140 --> 1:10:59.380]  Either they're going to enforce and protect people's civil liberties and civil rights
[1:10:59.380 --> 1:11:04.620]  against these illicit mandates that are not based in good science, put them to the test,
[1:11:04.620 --> 1:11:08.340]  put them to the evidentiary test, as it's supposed to occur.
[1:11:08.340 --> 1:11:13.820]  Or they're going to defer to the white lab coat crowd, like the courts did in the early
[1:11:13.820 --> 1:11:19.460]  20th century with the Jacobson decision and the Buck decision with forced sterilizations.
[1:11:19.460 --> 1:11:22.220]  And people should be aware that's where they're going back to.
[1:11:22.220 --> 1:11:26.380]  When they're citing these old cases, they're saying they want to have the power for forced
[1:11:26.380 --> 1:11:27.380]  sterilization.
[1:11:27.380 --> 1:11:30.500]  And that's why you were here when Amy Comey Barrett was being confirmed or it's about
[1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:31.500]  to be listed.
[1:11:31.500 --> 1:11:36.660]  You warned that she's one of the only people in modern jurisprudence that agreed with
[1:11:36.660 --> 1:11:40.700]  those archaic laws that allow the sterilization of poor whites and blacks, that allowed forced
[1:11:40.700 --> 1:11:43.580]  inoculations, that allowed just hellish behavior.
[1:11:43.580 --> 1:11:45.700]  For folks that don't know, please recap them on history.
[1:11:45.700 --> 1:11:49.580]  And we hope Amy Comey Barrett's good, but by having the left attacker and then suddenly
[1:11:49.580 --> 1:11:53.060]  they didn't really block her, they didn't make up stuff like that on Kavanaugh and others,
[1:11:53.060 --> 1:11:56.100]  they snuck her in and this woman's pretty damn scary.
[1:11:56.100 --> 1:11:57.100]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:11:57.100 --> 1:12:02.260]  I mean, she's the one who is the sole reason the election cases never went to the Supreme
[1:12:02.260 --> 1:12:03.260]  Court.
[1:12:03.260 --> 1:12:07.300]  She's the one who just turned down the Indiana University vaccine mandate case, didn't even
[1:12:07.300 --> 1:12:09.660]  let the rest of the justices hear the case.
[1:12:09.660 --> 1:12:15.100]  So that's, I mean, she's going to be a risky justice just like Roberts was and is and continues
[1:12:15.100 --> 1:12:16.100]  to be.
[1:12:16.100 --> 1:12:21.100]  But yeah, the trilogy of infamy that put all of this into process in the first place
[1:12:21.100 --> 1:12:28.020]  was the Jacobson decision of 1905, the Buck decision of 1927, and the Korematsu decision
[1:12:28.020 --> 1:12:31.700]  of 1945, and they all relied upon one another.
[1:12:31.700 --> 1:12:35.940]  And the Jacobson decision said you could be fined if you didn't take a vaccine.
[1:12:35.940 --> 1:12:41.420]  Then the Buck decision said the government could have four sterilizations against any
[1:12:41.420 --> 1:12:44.340]  group they decided to forcibly sterilize.
[1:12:44.340 --> 1:12:48.620]  And then the Korematsu decision said, based on who your great-granddaddy was, we can take
[1:12:48.620 --> 1:12:52.300]  away your business, take away your church, take away your school, take away your home
[1:12:52.300 --> 1:12:55.740]  and put you in a camp during just because it's wartime.
[1:12:55.740 --> 1:12:59.940]  And they're using the same logic in all three cases that the government has carte blanche
[1:12:59.940 --> 1:13:03.300]  control to do whatever it wants, particularly in an emergency context.
[1:13:03.300 --> 1:13:07.300]  And that's where we're going, Bargess Interjectors, I want you to elaborate on this.
[1:13:07.300 --> 1:13:10.100]  They're using the exact same language and saying they're going to do it.
[1:13:10.100 --> 1:13:11.500]  The left knows they're unpopular.
[1:13:11.500 --> 1:13:13.740]  They know the world's turned against them everywhere.
[1:13:13.740 --> 1:13:17.900]  That's why the globalists admit they launched this worldwide to stop populist movements everywhere
[1:13:17.900 --> 1:13:19.940]  and they're following the same formula.
[1:13:19.940 --> 1:13:25.100]  How critical is it that we've had regulators in Europe say don't inject under 16 because
[1:13:25.100 --> 1:13:27.780]  they have a, you know, can feel metaphysically this is evil.
[1:13:27.780 --> 1:13:32.740]  One thing to trick adults into something deadly or bad, but to do it to children is really
[1:13:32.740 --> 1:13:35.260]  criminal at every level because they're not of the age of consent.
[1:13:35.260 --> 1:13:36.900]  That's a metaphysical rule.
[1:13:36.900 --> 1:13:40.180]  And then you've got the two regulators over the vaccine's quitting and saying, we don't
[1:13:40.180 --> 1:13:41.260]  agree with rolling out.
[1:13:41.260 --> 1:13:42.260]  We don't agree with the mandates.
[1:13:42.260 --> 1:13:44.260]  We don't agree with boosters.
[1:13:44.260 --> 1:13:48.540]  Even the head of the UN, WHOs, a monster said, don't do boosters.
[1:13:48.540 --> 1:13:52.420]  So I think they realize the boosters are going to kill even more people as it just happened
[1:13:52.420 --> 1:13:53.420]  in Israel.
[1:13:53.420 --> 1:13:55.260]  And they think that's a breaking point too far.
[1:13:55.260 --> 1:13:56.260]  What do you think's happening?
[1:13:56.260 --> 1:13:57.500]  And how big is it for your cases?
[1:13:57.500 --> 1:13:58.500]  I don't know.
[1:13:58.500 --> 1:13:59.500]  Can you amend them?
[1:13:59.500 --> 1:14:03.020]  Or has somebody to do an amicus brief that now regulators are quitting, including in
[1:14:03.020 --> 1:14:06.020]  the U S and saying what you're saying, that's got to be big.
[1:14:06.020 --> 1:14:07.020]  Oh, yes.
[1:14:07.020 --> 1:14:10.820]  And we're including that in our arguments that were the people are resigning for reasons
[1:14:10.820 --> 1:14:15.500]  that nobody can explain high ranking officials are resigning suddenly and summarily at a
[1:14:15.500 --> 1:14:20.820]  critical juncture, which clearly indicates there's deep seated concerns about this rushed
[1:14:20.820 --> 1:14:22.820]  drug to the mass marketplace.
[1:14:22.820 --> 1:14:26.660]  This mass vaccination effort that's already failing, I mean, it's failing everywhere.
[1:14:26.660 --> 1:14:31.180]  I mean, for everybody to remember, this same President Biden told us several months ago
[1:14:31.180 --> 1:14:34.100]  that come July 4th, everything would be back to normal.
[1:14:34.100 --> 1:14:35.940]  Well, is it back to normal?
[1:14:35.940 --> 1:14:36.940]  Is vaccine mandates?
[1:14:36.940 --> 1:14:37.940]  Or is that back to normal?
[1:14:37.940 --> 1:14:38.940]  Are mask mandates?
[1:14:38.940 --> 1:14:39.940]  Is that back to normal?
[1:14:39.940 --> 1:14:42.620]  Are making kids being suffocated eight hours a day?
[1:14:42.620 --> 1:14:43.940]  Is that back to normal?
[1:14:43.940 --> 1:14:48.140]  Are kids being told that they can't participate in sports unless they get some drug injected
[1:14:48.140 --> 1:14:49.140]  in their body?
[1:14:49.140 --> 1:14:50.140]  Is that normal?
[1:14:50.140 --> 1:14:53.980]  Even though in particular for young men, it's almost indisputable at this point.
[1:14:53.980 --> 1:14:58.940]  The vaccine poses a much higher risk than the virus does because of the myocardous and
[1:14:58.940 --> 1:15:01.860]  pericarditis that it presents for the heart.
[1:15:01.860 --> 1:15:04.860]  In particular, that could be a risk for young athletes and young soldiers.
[1:15:04.860 --> 1:15:07.020]  So we're risking people's lives.
[1:15:07.020 --> 1:15:12.460]  Essentially we are back to the really the stone ages of human sacrifice.
[1:15:12.460 --> 1:15:17.260]  We're reinstating human sacrifice to serve the cause of this elite group of people who
[1:15:17.260 --> 1:15:22.860]  want to sacrifice some of our bravest people, some of our most extraordinary people for
[1:15:22.860 --> 1:15:28.540]  this idolatry cause of basically letting the state control your body.
[1:15:28.540 --> 1:15:29.540]  That's right.
[1:15:29.540 --> 1:15:35.180]  Under 20 males are 15 times more likely in a new Israeli study to have heart attacks
[1:15:35.180 --> 1:15:37.220]  when they take the Pfizer and Urna shot.
[1:15:37.220 --> 1:15:40.500]  My God, this is freaking Russian roulette.
[1:15:40.500 --> 1:15:41.820]  These people are killing us.
[1:15:41.820 --> 1:15:43.060]  They're coming after us.
[1:15:43.060 --> 1:15:51.780]  We'll be right back on How to Fight Back with Robert Barnes.
[1:15:51.780 --> 1:15:53.780]  Your voice counts.
[1:15:53.780 --> 1:15:58.780]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[1:15:58.780 --> 1:16:01.340]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:16:01.340 --> 1:16:02.860]  They know you're angry.
[1:16:02.860 --> 1:16:07.140]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[1:16:07.140 --> 1:16:08.140]  we've got.

[1:16:53.540 --> 1:16:55.700]  and not spend thousands doing it?

[1:17:22.700 --> 1:17:28.020]  Have you ever thought about turning your Glock, XD family or 1911 handgun into a semi-automatic
[1:17:28.020 --> 1:17:29.020]  carbine?
[1:17:29.020 --> 1:17:31.100]  It only takes about 30 seconds.

[1:17:46.180 --> 1:17:54.980]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies
[1:17:54.980 --> 1:17:55.980]  we are told.
[1:17:55.980 --> 1:18:01.380]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated
[1:18:01.380 --> 1:18:03.660]  water is a big problem.
[1:18:03.660 --> 1:18:08.420]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts
[1:18:08.420 --> 1:18:13.660]  down its natural functions, natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[1:18:13.660 --> 1:18:16.380]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[1:18:16.380 --> 1:18:20.100]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[1:18:20.100 --> 1:18:25.020]  Also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal gland is what connects us to higher
[1:18:25.020 --> 1:18:30.380]  levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[1:18:30.380 --> 1:18:35.020]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[1:18:35.020 --> 1:18:40.380]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride
[1:18:40.380 --> 1:18:44.180]  free and the propure shower head will seal the deal.

[1:18:50.300 --> 1:18:57.220]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[1:18:57.220 --> 1:19:02.820]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[1:19:02.820 --> 1:19:06.460]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[1:19:06.460 --> 1:19:08.220]  That's done by design.
[1:19:08.220 --> 1:19:14.260]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[1:19:14.260 --> 1:19:18.300]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg
[1:19:18.300 --> 1:19:22.140]  group, the Trilateral Commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds
[1:19:22.140 --> 1:19:24.260]  and the Rockefellers.
[1:19:24.260 --> 1:19:29.060]  Well ten years ago the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg group, didn't
[1:19:29.060 --> 1:19:30.060]  exist.
[1:19:30.060 --> 1:19:33.740]  Well now the Bilderberg group is public and its former head, the show on the steering
[1:19:33.740 --> 1:19:38.940]  committee, is Klaus Schwab and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[1:19:38.940 --> 1:19:44.100]  And if as a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the globalist head on about the second
[1:19:44.100 --> 1:19:47.740]  figure of worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[1:19:47.740 --> 1:19:52.860]  We do expose them, we can beat them easily.
[1:19:52.860 --> 1:19:57.060]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:19:57.060 --> 1:20:11.620]  All right, final segment, a great patriot constitutional lawyer fighting back against
[1:20:11.620 --> 1:20:17.380]  the tyrants of Robert Kennedy Jr., Robert Barnes, and I appreciate him joining us and
[1:20:17.380 --> 1:20:22.380]  always getting ready for a trial next week, battling the IRS in a big criminal case for
[1:20:22.380 --> 1:20:24.420]  a client.
[1:20:24.420 --> 1:20:29.340]  In the nine minutes we have left here, where do you see this going?
[1:20:29.340 --> 1:20:30.940]  How do we fight back?
[1:20:30.940 --> 1:20:33.940]  You agree with me that obviously they're going to follow the globalist model of after this
[1:20:33.940 --> 1:20:37.380]  they're going to announce more and more and more to make the last measures not look as
[1:20:37.380 --> 1:20:39.500]  bad so we give in to those and fight the new ones.
[1:20:39.500 --> 1:20:44.100]  I mean, there's clearly an authoritarian tactic there and then separately, how do you think
[1:20:44.100 --> 1:20:48.500]  it's going for Biden with the collapse in Afghanistan, everything else that's happening?
[1:20:48.500 --> 1:20:51.340]  Obviously now CNN's even coming on against him, who do you think they're going to try
[1:20:51.340 --> 1:20:53.980]  to replace him with?
[1:20:53.980 --> 1:20:54.980]  I think no question.
[1:20:54.980 --> 1:20:58.380]  This is going to be the deciding line about whether or not we have control and freedom
[1:20:58.380 --> 1:21:02.060]  moving forward because we have to win these cases and people have to fight back as much
[1:21:02.060 --> 1:21:06.100]  as possible through the legal means that are available to us to see whether the courts
[1:21:06.100 --> 1:21:13.140]  can succeed because we cannot revisit, recreate, reinstate the precedents that said forced
[1:21:13.140 --> 1:21:18.460]  detention camps, forced sterilizations, forced vaccinations are okay like we did at the beginning
[1:21:18.460 --> 1:21:22.780]  of the 20th century because what that gave us, what that birth was some of the most dangerous
[1:21:22.780 --> 1:21:26.700]  fascism and communism the world has ever seen, whether it was the left or the right, whether
[1:21:26.700 --> 1:21:28.900]  it was the Soviet style or the Nazi style.
[1:21:28.900 --> 1:21:34.500]  So we have to fight it all the way through by every means possible, by every means achievable,
[1:21:34.500 --> 1:21:38.860]  by every means attainable and I know that we definitely will be doing that wherever
[1:21:38.860 --> 1:21:43.740]  and whenever and however we can, not only in the suit that we brought against the FDA
[1:21:43.740 --> 1:21:48.580]  directly and against the CDC directly and against the Secretary of Health and Human
[1:21:48.580 --> 1:21:53.260]  Services directly, but we're looking at class action suits against Tyson Foods, class action
[1:21:53.260 --> 1:21:57.900]  suits against a range of government actors and private employers all across the country,
[1:21:57.900 --> 1:22:02.220]  including the Biden administration directly over this latest mandate and there's going
[1:22:02.220 --> 1:22:07.740]  to be an avalanche of litigation coming from lawyers all across the country, those that
[1:22:07.740 --> 1:22:11.980]  are conscientious and concerned about this and we've been leading that effort now for
[1:22:11.980 --> 1:22:13.460]  several months.
[1:22:13.460 --> 1:22:17.500]  And so it's critical, essential and fundamental that people continue to march on in that same
[1:22:17.500 --> 1:22:18.500]  path.
[1:22:18.500 --> 1:22:22.700]  Now, I think this move by Biden was a desperate move and I think it will backfire.
[1:22:22.700 --> 1:22:26.100]  There are some people that honestly we were having a hard time getting to be on board
[1:22:26.100 --> 1:22:31.180]  recognizing the significance and constitutional consequence of these decisions that Biden
[1:22:31.180 --> 1:22:33.780]  helped clarify everybody's vision for.
[1:22:33.780 --> 1:22:36.780]  Some governors who are sitting on their hands suddenly woke up.
[1:22:36.780 --> 1:22:39.940]  Some Senate candidates who are sitting on their hands suddenly woke up.
[1:22:39.940 --> 1:22:42.900]  Some congressmen who are sitting on their hands suddenly woke up.
[1:22:42.900 --> 1:22:44.580]  Some lawyers who are sitting on their hands suddenly woke up.
[1:22:44.580 --> 1:22:49.620]  I was about to say Barnes, I could psychically, because we're all connected, there's a magnetic
[1:22:49.620 --> 1:22:55.980]  ether, it's scientific, it's not just spiritual, I could feel the awakening and the anger and
[1:22:55.980 --> 1:22:57.620]  the determination last night.
[1:22:57.620 --> 1:22:59.340]  The energy was very strong.
[1:22:59.340 --> 1:23:02.180]  I could feel the giant awakening last night.
[1:23:02.180 --> 1:23:03.180]  Exactly.
[1:23:03.180 --> 1:23:08.140]  A Biden poked a bear and he poked a bear called American Freedom and I think that people are
[1:23:08.140 --> 1:23:10.900]  going to see that bear wake up and take action.
[1:23:10.900 --> 1:23:15.100]  And that's the good news because I think the Biden administration, all those West Wing
[1:23:15.100 --> 1:23:19.860]  wannabe Democrats that are up there working in the White House really believe that all
[1:23:19.860 --> 1:23:26.420]  of these compulsory Munchinson syndrome, be everybody's mommy, nanny state policies of
[1:23:26.420 --> 1:23:29.380]  the COVID lockdown era were deeply popular.
[1:23:29.380 --> 1:23:30.380]  They really believe this.
[1:23:30.380 --> 1:23:34.220]  They don't understand these policies have never been deeply popular.
[1:23:34.220 --> 1:23:37.420]  If they were deeply popular, Cuomo would still be governor of New York.
[1:23:37.420 --> 1:23:40.980]  If they were deeply popular, Newsom wouldn't be facing a recall election.
[1:23:40.980 --> 1:23:45.900]  If they were deeply popular, Trudeau wouldn't be facing a high risk election that he thought
[1:23:45.900 --> 1:23:49.100]  was going to be an easy no winner and no brainer.
[1:23:49.100 --> 1:23:52.300]  And so you look at this kind of dynamic, I think that the Biden administration and its
[1:23:52.300 --> 1:23:56.380]  key people overestimate the popularity of these mandates.
[1:23:56.380 --> 1:24:01.620]  Additional polling that Richard Barris did found that 75 to 80% of Americans strongly
[1:24:01.620 --> 1:24:06.900]  opposed firing someone over a vaccine, strongly opposed denying someone access to educational
[1:24:06.900 --> 1:24:09.980]  resources based on whether they took a vaccine.
[1:24:09.980 --> 1:24:14.620]  Strongly deny any of these restrictions, whether it be travel, whether it be culture, whether
[1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:18.260]  it be a restaurant, whether it be a public accommodation, whatever it is, they don't
[1:24:18.260 --> 1:24:22.820]  believe that people should have to condition their rights on taking an experimental vaccine.
[1:24:22.820 --> 1:24:25.420]  And Martin, you're on fire today, I can tell this pisses you off.
[1:24:25.420 --> 1:24:27.940]  You're always great, but you're amazing today.
[1:24:27.940 --> 1:24:28.940]  Clearly I want to be clear.
[1:24:28.940 --> 1:24:32.140]  I'm not defending Biden, but I don't want their shield to take all the heat and the
[1:24:32.140 --> 1:24:36.460]  people behind it, Soros and others to get away with this Bill Gates.
[1:24:36.460 --> 1:24:37.460]  This is corporate governance.
[1:24:37.460 --> 1:24:38.820]  That's what the new world order is.
[1:24:38.820 --> 1:24:42.460]  I've met with globalist off-record folks, okay?
[1:24:42.460 --> 1:24:45.660]  And my one crew member saw Rothkopf out of the Kissinger Group, tried to get me to come
[1:24:45.660 --> 1:24:46.660]  to New York.
[1:24:46.660 --> 1:24:49.540]  He said it in front of the crew member and said, this is not off-record.
[1:24:49.540 --> 1:24:52.580]  So I told the story, but I've had at least five, six of those meetings.
[1:24:52.580 --> 1:24:53.580]  One was unintentional.
[1:24:53.580 --> 1:24:58.340]  The head of the fourth largest bank in the U.S. now 14 years ago, Times Lies, on a flight
[1:24:58.340 --> 1:24:59.660]  to New York in first class.
[1:24:59.660 --> 1:25:05.060]  But this is very real and people see it's very real right now.
[1:25:05.060 --> 1:25:06.940]  But Biden is a puppet.
[1:25:06.940 --> 1:25:07.940]  He's a front man.
[1:25:07.940 --> 1:25:10.780]  I think it's very important to realize it's big pharma.
[1:25:10.780 --> 1:25:12.300]  It's the big corporations.
[1:25:12.300 --> 1:25:16.100]  He's trying to give cover to the Fortune 500 to carry this out.
[1:25:16.100 --> 1:25:17.260]  This is really their goal.
[1:25:17.260 --> 1:25:23.020]  So we understand this is corporate fascism in its nature and then basically aim our
[1:25:23.020 --> 1:25:24.300]  angst at the real culprit.
[1:25:24.300 --> 1:25:25.700]  Do you agree with that, Barnes?
[1:25:25.700 --> 1:25:26.700]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:25:26.700 --> 1:25:33.060]  I mean, this is a century-old agenda that's been recrafted and recreated for a new age
[1:25:33.060 --> 1:25:37.260]  of which this is half of it and climate change is the other half of it that started a dozen
[1:25:37.260 --> 1:25:43.380]  years ago in its current formulation when Bill Gates, David Rockefeller, Oprah, Bloomberg,
[1:25:43.380 --> 1:25:48.740]  George Soros all sat down at Rockefeller University in New York City in a secret meeting that
[1:25:48.740 --> 1:25:52.860]  a janitor and some maid saw and they were the ones who leaked out what happened.
[1:25:52.860 --> 1:25:54.340]  And the agenda was clear.
[1:25:54.340 --> 1:25:57.860]  And then they were portrayed by the press as superheroes, which was absurd.
[1:25:57.860 --> 1:26:02.580]  But they made clear their goal was the same population, eugenics-driven agenda that they're
[1:26:02.580 --> 1:26:03.580]  in.
[1:26:03.580 --> 1:26:07.180]  In Bill Gates's case, grandparents had been advocates of a century before.
[1:26:07.180 --> 1:26:09.020]  And so they're trying to put it in again.
[1:26:09.020 --> 1:26:13.460]  This is about the government, the state, the corporate medical apparatus, the elites controlling
[1:26:13.460 --> 1:26:18.300]  everything about us, controlling our thoughts, our ideas, controlling literally, physically,
[1:26:18.300 --> 1:26:20.300]  the genes of our bodies.
[1:26:20.300 --> 1:26:21.660]  And that's why we have to push back.
[1:26:21.660 --> 1:26:23.460]  It's why they believed in it in the first place.
[1:26:23.460 --> 1:26:25.340]  The Rockefellers loved the Nazis.
[1:26:25.340 --> 1:26:28.220]  They were some of the biggest backers and supporters of the Nazis.
[1:26:28.220 --> 1:26:29.860]  And so fighting them is critical.
[1:26:29.860 --> 1:26:34.660]  I mean, it's an old battle, but it's come back in a nasty way to confront us.
[1:26:34.660 --> 1:26:38.700]  And it's right, confronting us right now, because if they win legally and politically
[1:26:38.700 --> 1:26:43.780]  on what they're trying to do, then we will lose our freedoms for a century with ease.
[1:26:43.780 --> 1:26:46.900]  Because it's what happened last time, and last time it forced the World War to solve
[1:26:46.900 --> 1:26:47.900]  the problem.
[1:26:47.900 --> 1:26:49.460]  We don't want to go through that again.
[1:26:49.460 --> 1:26:53.700]  So that's what requires everybody being proactive and active, because this is a Bill Gates,
[1:26:53.700 --> 1:26:57.140]  George Soros, David Rockefeller, old elite agenda.
[1:26:57.140 --> 1:27:02.460]  We're trying to reinforce, literally, force down our throats and enforce into our bodies
[1:27:02.460 --> 1:27:06.820]  and force into our children's bodies, even when they know the risk to the kids.
[1:27:06.820 --> 1:27:11.460]  This is some of the most outrageous behavior by the medical establishment since the Milgram
[1:27:11.460 --> 1:27:14.780]  experiment and the MK Ultra experiments half a century ago.
[1:27:14.780 --> 1:27:18.620]  This is the externalization on a mass scale of MK Ultra.
[1:27:18.620 --> 1:27:19.620]  That's exactly right.
[1:27:19.620 --> 1:27:20.620]  It's the same logic.
[1:27:20.620 --> 1:27:24.500]  It's the same logic when they took soldiers in World War I and World War II and secretly
[1:27:24.500 --> 1:27:27.940]  tested mustard gas on them, secretly tested radioactivity on them.
[1:27:27.940 --> 1:27:28.940]  I mean, is it a coincidence?
[1:27:28.940 --> 1:27:33.300]  Tuskegee experiment, all of it, in closing, Barnes, I'm going to try to get some time
[1:27:33.300 --> 1:27:36.780]  for you today to elaborate so you can be on the big tape show we're doing.
[1:27:36.780 --> 1:27:38.260]  I'm going to be up here at eight tonight, folks.
[1:27:38.260 --> 1:27:41.420]  We've got so many huge doctors, so many huge scientists.
[1:27:41.420 --> 1:27:42.420]  Some have never been on before.
[1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:45.700]  Wait till you see the show that airs at 5 p.m. tomorrow.
[1:27:45.700 --> 1:27:48.780]  We're going to scream it out on all the screams as well.
[1:27:48.780 --> 1:27:51.300]  So Robert Barnes, how do people find your great shows?
[1:27:51.300 --> 1:27:52.300]  You're doing a lot.
[1:27:52.300 --> 1:27:56.100]  And I love seeing your shows getting hundreds of thousands, even millions of views out there.
[1:27:56.100 --> 1:28:01.100]  That excites me to see you going from popular to super popular as you champion Liberty.
[1:28:01.100 --> 1:28:02.340]  Absolutely.
[1:28:02.340 --> 1:28:08.580]  So people can go to VivaBarnsLaw.locals.com, and that's where they can find exemplars.
[1:28:08.580 --> 1:28:13.820]  They can find information about fighting the vaccines, exemplars of how to fight the vaccines,
[1:28:13.820 --> 1:28:18.220]  sources and referrals to fighting the vaccines, breakdowns of the existing suits that already
[1:28:18.220 --> 1:28:19.220]  exists.
[1:28:19.220 --> 1:28:20.220]  Yeah, a lot of battle plans.
[1:28:20.220 --> 1:28:21.220]  We're almost out of time.
[1:28:21.220 --> 1:28:23.780]  We're going to go on AM and FM, and we'll even do it on the Internet and TV.
[1:28:23.780 --> 1:28:24.780]  Give them the URL.
[1:28:24.780 --> 1:28:26.780]  One more time for radio listeners driving down the road.
[1:28:26.780 --> 1:28:27.780]  Sure.
[1:28:27.780 --> 1:28:28.780]  It's VivaBarnsLaw.locals.com.
[1:28:28.780 --> 1:28:29.780]  All right.
[1:28:29.780 --> 1:28:34.860]  I'm going to talk to you again this afternoon.
[1:28:34.860 --> 1:28:35.860]  Don't hang up.
[1:28:35.860 --> 1:28:37.140]  I think they found out what time I can interview you.
[1:28:37.140 --> 1:28:38.140]  You can do it.
[1:28:38.140 --> 1:28:39.420]  I just want to squeeze you in for tomorrow.
[1:28:39.420 --> 1:28:40.420]  There's so much to say.
[1:28:40.420 --> 1:28:41.420]  Barnes on fire.
[1:28:41.420 --> 1:28:42.420]  Infowars.com.
[1:28:42.420 --> 1:28:43.420]  Tomorrow's news today.
[1:28:43.420 --> 1:28:44.420]  Stay with us.
[1:28:44.420 --> 1:28:45.420]  Big news coming up.
[1:28:45.420 --> 1:28:49.140]  Attention radio listeners.
[1:28:49.140 --> 1:28:54.060]  If you're concerned about the coming chaos after the November elections, this will be
[1:28:54.060 --> 1:28:56.100]  an extremely important message.
[1:28:56.100 --> 1:28:57.100]  Here's why.
[1:28:57.100 --> 1:29:03.860]  No matter what the outcome in November, catastrophic social upheaval is a very real possibility.
[1:29:03.860 --> 1:29:05.260]  Here's why this is important.
[1:29:05.260 --> 1:29:09.940]  Listen, we all know that silver and gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain
[1:29:09.940 --> 1:29:13.780]  waves of social chaos and unstable currencies.
[1:29:13.780 --> 1:29:18.460]  But did you know that there's been times in the past during times of extreme hardship
[1:29:18.460 --> 1:29:22.900]  when Americans put another store of value above even silver and gold?
[1:29:22.900 --> 1:29:23.900]  It's true.
[1:29:23.900 --> 1:29:28.620]  Open pollinated seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store of value in
[1:29:28.620 --> 1:29:30.340]  the coming hard times ahead.
[1:29:30.340 --> 1:29:34.460]  Go to survivalseedbank.com to get heirloom seeds below wholesale.

[1:29:42.380 --> 1:29:44.020]  But above all, don't wait.

[1:30:13.940 --> 1:30:18.380]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening, and
[1:30:18.380 --> 1:30:20.900]  it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[1:30:20.900 --> 1:30:23.440]  But there's only two things to do.
[1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:26.580]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[1:30:26.580 --> 1:30:29.940]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[1:30:29.940 --> 1:30:34.580]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to

[1:31:47.700 --> 1:31:50.660]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[1:31:50.660 --> 1:31:53.620]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[1:31:53.620 --> 1:31:56.660]  Monday at midnight, we've got to end this sale.
[1:31:56.660 --> 1:32:01.380]  We may end it earlier because we think it will sell out by then at current sales rates.
[1:32:01.380 --> 1:32:02.940]  Vitamin refuge is super popular.

[1:32:51.500 --> 1:33:09.540]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:09.540 --> 1:33:24.860]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country, arping
[1:33:24.860 --> 1:33:25.860]  on the wars we fight, griping about the way things ought to be, and I don't mind them
[1:33:25.860 --> 1:33:31.860]  switching sides and standing up for things they believe in, but when they're running
[1:33:31.860 --> 1:33:41.940]  down our country, they're walking on the fighting side of me.
[1:33:41.940 --> 1:33:42.940]  Yeah, walking.
[1:33:42.940 --> 1:33:43.940]  They're walking on the fighting side of me.
[1:33:43.940 --> 1:33:44.940]  Running down.
[1:33:44.940 --> 1:33:49.620]  Running down a way of life, our fighting men have fought and died.
[1:33:49.620 --> 1:33:51.620]  You don't love it, leave it.
[1:33:51.620 --> 1:33:53.820]  If you don't love it, leave it.
[1:33:53.820 --> 1:33:58.740]  Let this song that I'm singing be a warning to you.
[1:33:58.740 --> 1:34:04.740]  When you're running down our country, you're walking on the fighting side of me.
[1:34:04.740 --> 1:34:11.180]  Now let's be clear, what we're dealing with is a global government takeover with the National
[1:34:11.180 --> 1:34:16.500]  Archives saying the Constitution Bill of Rights is racist and putting a trigger warning on
[1:34:16.500 --> 1:34:17.500]  them.
[1:34:17.500 --> 1:34:19.300]  No, they need to have their asses fired and thrown out of there.
[1:34:19.300 --> 1:34:23.700]  It's Marxist-Leninist taking over, thinking they're having a communist takeover run by
[1:34:23.700 --> 1:34:27.020]  offshore mega banks and big tech.
[1:34:27.020 --> 1:34:29.860]  It's preposterous.
[1:34:29.860 --> 1:34:39.540]  They want a one-child policy here, but China has come out and said, quote, George Soros
[1:34:39.540 --> 1:34:44.660]  is an international criminal terrorist, running an international group of terrorists and globalists
[1:34:44.660 --> 1:34:49.100]  hell-bent on bankrupting nation-states and starving populations to death.
[1:34:49.100 --> 1:34:50.100]  I've got the op-ed.
[1:34:50.100 --> 1:34:51.860]  That guy's, I know you gave it to me this morning.
[1:34:51.860 --> 1:34:52.860]  I sent it to you.
[1:34:52.860 --> 1:34:54.540]  I can't find it in the stack.
[1:34:54.540 --> 1:34:58.500]  You guys print me the copies of the Beijing dailies and stuff that are in English that
[1:34:58.500 --> 1:35:00.020]  have those headlines.
[1:35:00.020 --> 1:35:03.860]  Yeah, China declares George Soros a global economic terrorist.
[1:35:03.860 --> 1:35:06.620]  They want to call him the globalist kingpin.
[1:35:06.620 --> 1:35:10.460]  Folks, do you know how big this is?
[1:35:10.460 --> 1:35:14.700]  The globalist sucked America dry, set up one side of deals to transfer everything we had
[1:35:14.700 --> 1:35:22.660]  in our military to China for 40 years, accelerated under Clinton 30 years ago.
[1:35:22.660 --> 1:35:29.540]  And so they did all of this, were totally de-industrialized, and now Xi Jinping says
[1:35:29.540 --> 1:35:33.420]  we're going to have three children, and we're going to execute homosexuals, and we're going
[1:35:33.420 --> 1:35:41.700]  to kick any sissy men off TV, and we're about men and women and families.
[1:35:41.700 --> 1:35:47.780]  I'm not saying execute homosexuals, I'm a libertarian.
[1:35:47.780 --> 1:35:53.060]  But the point is, we've been given this culture, and China funds and owns four of the six production
[1:35:53.060 --> 1:35:58.940]  houses promoting all of this weakness to undermine us.
[1:35:58.940 --> 1:36:06.540]  Paul Watson had an excellent video yesterday about Peter Thiel building a giant underground
[1:36:06.540 --> 1:36:12.340]  bunker in New Zealand, because that's the globalist redoubt where they're hiding out.
[1:36:12.340 --> 1:36:15.340]  And I'm not saying Peter Thiel's a globalist, he's actually come out against the globalist
[1:36:15.340 --> 1:36:16.340]  and a lot of other things.
[1:36:16.340 --> 1:36:23.020]  I'm not saying the jury's out on that guy, but the point is, is that they're all there,
[1:36:23.020 --> 1:36:28.420]  and they're in Kauai, and they're in Fiji, and they're in Northern Canada, right up by
[1:36:28.420 --> 1:36:32.180]  the Arctic Circle under mountains, and they're not building this and hanging out there and
[1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:36.460]  building private airfields that are camouflaged for no reason.
[1:36:36.460 --> 1:36:42.540]  They're doing it because they know that they've created giant Ponzi schemes and scams and sold
[1:36:42.540 --> 1:36:48.660]  houses 50 times a piece in derivatives, and they know that it's all rigged, and they know
[1:36:48.660 --> 1:36:54.700]  that the public has become corrupt and dumbed down and decadent by design, and that we're
[1:36:54.700 --> 1:36:58.780]  going into a collapse cycle, so they're trying to control the collapse and trigger it so
[1:36:58.780 --> 1:36:59.980]  they can control it.
[1:36:59.980 --> 1:37:00.980]  That's what all this is.
[1:37:00.980 --> 1:37:05.700]  That's what the Great Reset is, and I sit here, I don't want to kill the public, but
[1:37:05.700 --> 1:37:09.580]  I know that within five days of no electricity, most people rob and steal.
[1:37:09.580 --> 1:37:17.140]  Within 10 days, around 70% rob and steal and begin to engage in cannibalism.
[1:37:17.140 --> 1:37:24.900]  By 15 days, a large portion commit suicide, and then 90% plus of those don't commit suicide
[1:37:24.900 --> 1:37:26.700]  engage in cannibalism.
[1:37:26.700 --> 1:37:30.540]  So when you see a zombie movie that Hollywood puts out, that's the archetype of a crowd
[1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:37.380]  of people that's starving for 10 days, and they will eat the paint off the walls.
[1:37:37.380 --> 1:37:40.860]  They will, I mean humans have a really good nose when you're starving, it gets like a
[1:37:40.860 --> 1:37:45.220]  dog's nose, it gets way better, and that's why in World War II in starving cities, Germans,
[1:37:45.220 --> 1:37:54.300]  Russians, they all did it, Italians did it, there used to be a paste of flour was what
[1:37:54.300 --> 1:37:57.620]  you use, you still do, for wallpaper.
[1:37:57.620 --> 1:38:04.580]  People ate the wallpaper off the walls, people ate their shoes, people ate their dogs, then
[1:38:04.580 --> 1:38:08.700]  Miss Weyla ate their dogs and cats a decade ago, then seven years ago they ate all the
[1:38:08.700 --> 1:38:09.700]  zoo animals.
[1:38:09.700 --> 1:38:18.260]  Now there's no pigeons left, there's no nothing, because just like North Korea, they eat everything.
[1:38:18.260 --> 1:38:23.700]  So that's where the world's going, that's what's happening, that's what's unfolding,
[1:38:23.700 --> 1:38:30.100]  and they've decided to artificially collapse everything.
[1:38:30.100 --> 1:38:33.980]  And by the way, people tune into me and they think, man this guy talks fast, this guy says
[1:38:33.980 --> 1:38:35.900]  all this stuff, he's so full of crap.
[1:38:35.900 --> 1:38:40.820]  The crew doesn't know what I'm about to say, they just type into search engines what I
[1:38:40.820 --> 1:38:45.940]  say, your TV viewer, and it's Washington Post, Forbes, they ate the zoo animals, actually
[1:38:45.940 --> 1:38:46.940]  ate their dogs and cats.
[1:38:46.940 --> 1:38:52.900]  By the way, Miss Weyla has more timber, more better land for cows and everything else,
[1:38:52.900 --> 1:38:59.540]  more jewels, more diamonds, more gold, more silver, more oil than any other country in
[1:38:59.540 --> 1:39:03.020]  the world except oil, Saudi Arabia beats them, but barely.
[1:39:03.020 --> 1:39:08.660]  They have per capita as much oil, a lot of it's sweet, meaning it barely has to be refined,
[1:39:08.660 --> 1:39:15.460]  comes out of the ground like gasoline, and they are starving to death because the communists
[1:39:15.460 --> 1:39:20.460]  want it that way, just like Cuba.
[1:39:20.460 --> 1:39:32.380]  Comprende, Venezuela had a higher GDP in 1978 than we have per capita, and they had a higher
[1:39:32.380 --> 1:39:37.940]  standard of living in the 70s than we did, and before that we then surpassed them.
[1:39:37.940 --> 1:39:43.180]  But they don't have that anymore because the people that built Venezuela, their grandkids
[1:39:43.180 --> 1:39:47.300]  got spoiled, their great grandkids become little commie punks, and the communists came
[1:39:47.300 --> 1:39:51.900]  and said, you don't need that creamery, you don't need that dairy, you don't need that
[1:39:51.900 --> 1:39:58.860]  factory, you don't need to work for that, we're going to take over and that will be yours.
[1:39:58.860 --> 1:40:04.180]  And of course, now all they get to do is starve to death.
[1:40:04.180 --> 1:40:08.300]  Around 2,000 people die a week, it's estimated Venezuela last time I checked, but the government
[1:40:08.300 --> 1:40:12.660]  passed a law that you're not allowed to sit, call it starvation.
[1:40:12.660 --> 1:40:16.860]  That's going on for year after year after year.
[1:40:16.860 --> 1:40:21.420]  How can Venezuela be so rich in resources, but so low in supplies?
[1:40:21.420 --> 1:40:27.420]  Because communism is a satanic religion of the Jacobean Illuminati in the French Revolution,
[1:40:27.420 --> 1:40:31.780]  that's when it was created.
[1:40:31.780 --> 1:40:36.260]  That's how this works.
[1:40:36.260 --> 1:40:39.580]  And I have begged everyone on their knees to understand this, and I know our audience
[1:40:39.580 --> 1:40:42.420]  gets it better than I do many of you, but you've been around the world, many of you
[1:40:42.420 --> 1:40:45.340]  have been in the military or in business, you've seen it firsthand.
[1:40:45.340 --> 1:40:49.900]  And I've been quite a few places, but not as much as a lot of people, and I've read
[1:40:49.900 --> 1:40:53.580]  about it, I've taught people that have been there, I've not been in Venezuela, that we
[1:40:53.580 --> 1:40:54.980]  can see the hell.
[1:40:54.980 --> 1:40:59.860]  But you talk to the average young person, 50 plus percent, like 52 percent depending
[1:40:59.860 --> 1:41:02.860]  on the poll, 49 to 55, they vary.
[1:41:02.860 --> 1:41:08.420]  Their scientific polls of universities and high schools, over 50 percent on average,
[1:41:08.420 --> 1:41:10.340]  want communism.
[1:41:10.340 --> 1:41:14.340]  They want to live in North Korea, they want to live in Venezuela, they want to live in
[1:41:14.340 --> 1:41:15.340]  Cuba.
[1:41:15.340 --> 1:41:18.900]  China is not communist, it's not communist for at least 20 years.
[1:41:18.900 --> 1:41:29.620]  It's a fascist authoritarian engine that's taking over the planet.
[1:41:29.620 --> 1:41:33.660]  And George Soros is trying to crash the Chinese economy right now.
[1:41:33.660 --> 1:41:36.100]  That's not going to help us if they crash the Chinese economy.
[1:41:36.100 --> 1:41:37.100]  That's not going to help us.
[1:41:37.100 --> 1:41:39.020]  That's when countries go to war.
[1:41:39.020 --> 1:41:46.300]  And that 91-year-old monster, that Nazi collaborator, that living fossil wants to see the world
[1:41:46.300 --> 1:41:47.780]  burn down before he dies.
[1:41:47.780 --> 1:41:51.980]  Let me pull up the photo of him and Nancy Pelosi and that demon son of his, Alexander.
[1:41:51.980 --> 1:41:58.140]  All right, I'll play the clips, I'll get into Biden, and then Dr. Vladimir Zevzolenko,
[1:41:58.140 --> 1:42:00.980]  of all these amazing doctors, he's one of the most interesting because he's really informed
[1:42:00.980 --> 1:42:02.700]  on politics and the world.
[1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:08.060]  He gets what's really going on, that it's deliberate, that it's depopulation.
[1:42:08.060 --> 1:42:14.580]  Out of all these doctors, he's overall the most well-rounded, and then they're all amazing.
[1:42:14.580 --> 1:42:20.220]  I've got one on tomorrow, Dr. Bartlett, the big one that discovered all the steroids and
[1:42:20.220 --> 1:42:23.900]  stuff for COVID, and is also endorsing Regeneron.
[1:42:23.900 --> 1:42:26.900]  He's really smart, runs a major hospital here in Texas.
[1:42:26.900 --> 1:42:36.300]  He will be with us tomorrow, 5 p.m. Central, 6 p.m. Eastern, 4 p.m. Mountain, 3 p.m. Pacific,
[1:42:36.300 --> 1:42:39.060]  or the emergency Saturday transmission.
[1:42:39.060 --> 1:42:41.860]  This is the live Friday emergency transmission.
[1:42:41.860 --> 1:42:44.100]  We are now officially under martial law.
[1:42:44.100 --> 1:42:47.620]  The question is, will he carry it out?
[1:42:47.620 --> 1:42:53.620]  The puppet leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their allegiance to the
[1:42:53.620 --> 1:42:59.060]  New World Order, and Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well.
[1:42:59.060 --> 1:43:04.860]  That means allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government established by the Rockefellers
[1:43:04.860 --> 1:43:09.940]  through the UN, and they want inside your bodies to put in you what they want, when they want,
[1:43:09.940 --> 1:43:16.540]  to have the global digital tracking COVID passes or vaccine passes to form the backbone
[1:43:16.540 --> 1:43:18.820]  of their New World ID.
[1:43:18.820 --> 1:43:23.620]  And now their puppet Biden has announced the forced inoculation of 100 million Americans
[1:43:23.620 --> 1:43:27.820]  to keep their jobs in total violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[1:43:27.820 --> 1:43:32.140]  This is criminal, and he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine, but they did not approve
[1:43:32.140 --> 1:43:33.140]  it.
[1:43:33.140 --> 1:43:34.740]  They say that's a 20, 25, maybe.
[1:43:34.740 --> 1:43:37.260]  They just expanded the emergency authorization.
[1:43:37.260 --> 1:43:40.140]  That's why the two top scientists quit a week and a half ago.
[1:43:40.140 --> 1:43:43.700]  Well, you live to see an absolute New World Order world government.
[1:43:43.700 --> 1:43:46.060]  If you submit, they will totally enslave you.
[1:43:46.060 --> 1:43:50.860]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[1:43:50.860 --> 1:43:52.940]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:43:52.940 --> 1:43:58.620]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[1:43:58.620 --> 1:43:59.620]  But we failed.
[1:43:59.620 --> 1:44:01.100]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:44:01.100 --> 1:44:06.860]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[1:44:06.860 --> 1:44:09.220]  deindustrialization, great reset.
[1:44:09.220 --> 1:44:13.540]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[1:44:13.540 --> 1:44:18.140]  they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:44:18.140 --> 1:44:21.460]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've
[1:44:21.460 --> 1:44:23.660]  also got to get personally prepared.
[1:44:23.660 --> 1:44:25.980]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[1:44:25.980 --> 1:44:30.980]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:30.980 --> 1:44:34.980]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[1:44:34.980 --> 1:44:40.380]  to ship right now, lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long
[1:44:40.380 --> 1:44:43.820]  lines and waits because believe me, serious times are coming.
[1:44:43.820 --> 1:44:47.220]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:47.220 --> 1:44:51.860]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[1:44:51.860 --> 1:44:54.500]  from beta testing to operational.
[1:44:54.500 --> 1:44:59.180]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[1:44:59.180 --> 1:45:00.180]  takeover.
[1:45:00.180 --> 1:45:03.500]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working
[1:45:03.500 --> 1:45:07.940]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[1:45:07.940 --> 1:45:09.060]  Humanity is strong.
[1:45:09.060 --> 1:45:12.700]  We're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance
[1:45:12.700 --> 1:45:13.700]  of defeating it.
[1:45:13.700 --> 1:45:16.020]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[1:45:16.020 --> 1:45:20.220]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning
[1:45:20.220 --> 1:45:21.940]  others is absolutely essential.
[1:45:21.940 --> 1:45:26.420]  And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high quality products to keep us
[1:45:26.420 --> 1:45:30.060]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're
[1:45:30.060 --> 1:45:32.460]  also funding our operation.
[1:45:32.460 --> 1:45:37.940]  infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com is incredible, a lot of our products that have been sold
[1:45:37.940 --> 1:45:42.100]  out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasobites and others.

[1:45:46.140 --> 1:45:49.100]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[1:45:49.100 --> 1:45:51.980]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[1:45:51.980 --> 1:45:54.980]  Monday at midnight, we've got to end this sale.
[1:45:54.980 --> 1:45:59.500]  We may end it earlier because we think it'll sell out by then at current sales rates.
[1:45:59.500 --> 1:46:02.500]  Info fusion is super popular, it's got all the high quality vitamins and minerals that
[1:46:02.500 --> 1:46:05.020]  are essential, great amino acids and it tastes great.
[1:46:05.020 --> 1:46:09.860]  It's powder formed so in the water, you absorb it more when you drink the fruit punch.

[1:46:42.620 --> 1:47:11.540]  down.
[1:47:11.540 --> 1:47:16.500]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, most days I host the first three hours and we always
[1:47:16.500 --> 1:47:21.020]  have a great, a lot of times a great guest host for the fourth hour or something, I do
[1:47:21.020 --> 1:47:24.140]  it, it's weird, nobody else does it, people like it and then you have the war with Owen
[1:47:24.140 --> 1:47:28.780]  Schroder coming up after that but today I'm hosting all four hours, at least once a week
[1:47:28.780 --> 1:47:35.540]  I do that and so we're going to have Mike Adams on who's really upset and focused and
[1:47:35.540 --> 1:47:39.300]  knows what's going on, we're going to bring up some questions about what's really happening
[1:47:39.300 --> 1:47:43.860]  and then really give some answers about what's over the horizon, we already told you this
[1:47:43.860 --> 1:47:47.420]  dictatorial power was coming, we already told you the mandates were coming, new lockdowns
[1:47:47.420 --> 1:47:51.500]  were coming, we already told you forced inoculations were coming, we told you the shot wasn't an
[1:47:51.500 --> 1:47:54.820]  inoculation that it was deadly, we told you it would lower your immune system and create
[1:47:54.820 --> 1:47:59.460]  super variants so now we're going to break down from the science, from the history, from
[1:47:59.460 --> 1:48:04.020]  understanding the globalist what's coming next, I'm going to ask that of Mike Adams,
[1:48:04.020 --> 1:48:11.940]  I'm going to ask that of Dr. Vladimir Zelensko and so much more today but just for lay folks
[1:48:11.940 --> 1:48:16.660]  out there who don't have legal degrees or drive along their cars, listen to this for
[1:48:16.660 --> 1:48:20.700]  the first time, I want to explain something to you that you should say to your employers
[1:48:20.700 --> 1:48:26.700]  when they tell you well you've got to take the shot, they went and lobbied to do that
[1:48:26.700 --> 1:48:33.740]  because their lawyers told HR you will be liable for people getting COVID if you don't
[1:48:33.740 --> 1:48:39.140]  do this, well that's a fraud, you can pull up the numbers, even the CDC estimates that
[1:48:39.140 --> 1:48:45.420]  80% of Americans have now had COVID or been exposed to it, you understand?
[1:48:45.420 --> 1:48:51.180]  So this is highly contagious, the Delta variant, it's all over the place and it came out of
[1:48:51.180 --> 1:48:56.340]  the vaccine knocking out all the other COVID variants and then created this very communicable
[1:48:56.340 --> 1:49:00.900]  one that kills a lot of people, some people it's no big deal, it's like a regular cold,
[1:49:00.900 --> 1:49:05.620]  I had it, felt like a gorilla was sitting on my chest and I toughed it out for a few
[1:49:05.620 --> 1:49:09.220]  days and then got on the regimen and it knocked it out in a day or two, I felt a lot better
[1:49:09.220 --> 1:49:16.220]  the next day and two days later, 80% better, three days later, 99% better, okay?
[1:49:16.220 --> 1:49:21.020]  My parents didn't tell me they had it for a week, almost killed my dad and I got him
[1:49:21.020 --> 1:49:27.260]  on the regimen and it absolutely turned him around where he was about 80 something percent
[1:49:27.260 --> 1:49:34.020]  low oxygen, couldn't get out of bed, wouldn't he, didn't know who he was to the next day,
[1:49:34.020 --> 1:49:43.900]  I got him on the regimen of hydroxychloroquine and Z-PAC and the remdesivir, let me go over
[1:49:43.900 --> 1:49:48.020]  this because I have to remember these things and I didn't put him on Regeneron, I just
[1:49:48.020 --> 1:49:49.860]  said that wrong.
[1:49:49.860 --> 1:49:53.220]  People always think people are talking in my ears, probably once a day they do talk
[1:49:53.220 --> 1:49:58.140]  in my ear to tell me a guest is there or whatever and remember I said Regeneron, which is a
[1:49:58.140 --> 1:50:05.620]  terrible drug from the studies, they said, we're not Regeneron, see, see, what happens
[1:50:05.620 --> 1:50:13.060]  here sometimes is my mind's very quick and then I get derailed, that's because I did
[1:50:13.060 --> 1:50:17.740]  too much during that break, I'm going to have to stop doing videos during the break,
[1:50:17.740 --> 1:50:23.940]  I went and got a piece of pizza, ate it in 30 seconds and then I shot a minute and a
[1:50:23.940 --> 1:50:28.900]  half video about the illegality of these vaccines and this mandate and then I barely
[1:50:28.900 --> 1:50:31.540]  got in my seat by the time I was supposed to go in there and it just derailed the entire
[1:50:31.540 --> 1:50:37.620]  segment and see it's not their fault talking in my ear, once I get to that point that distracted,
[1:50:37.620 --> 1:50:42.060]  I can't do a segment, just the way it is, no other talk show host would do stuff during
[1:50:42.060 --> 1:50:45.180]  the breaks, I have to stop it, okay, so we're going to have to set up a new system where
[1:50:45.180 --> 1:50:48.060]  they come in there and interview me and I'm not mad at them, I just can't do it anymore,
[1:50:48.060 --> 1:50:50.980]  I can't do it anymore, can't do it anymore, can't do it anymore, can't do it anymore,
[1:50:50.980 --> 1:50:56.140]  so I'm going to reset, I'm going to reset and we just get this straight, so I go over
[1:50:56.140 --> 1:51:02.180]  there and my father is definitely ill, he hadn't told me he was sick for a week, he
[1:51:02.180 --> 1:51:05.540]  can't get out of bed, doesn't know he has, my mother says I've never been this sick,
[1:51:05.540 --> 1:51:10.620]  oh my God, she was like asleep on the couch, couldn't remember how she got there and I
[1:51:10.620 --> 1:51:15.820]  go get the prescription, get doctors to come to the house to see him, they did a great
[1:51:15.820 --> 1:51:23.940]  job, got them the oral steroids, the inhalable steroids, the ivermectin, anabiotic, in case
[1:51:23.940 --> 1:51:29.500]  there was any secondary infections caused by the virus, zinc and holes in their body
[1:51:29.500 --> 1:51:39.780]  and then vitamin D, zinc, chloroquine, that's how you say the name, Horsetin and with by
[1:51:39.780 --> 1:51:46.260]  the next morning when I came over, when I first got there there was five boxes of pool
[1:51:46.260 --> 1:51:50.180]  chairs out front of their house that had I guess been there for a week, it was raining,
[1:51:50.180 --> 1:51:54.300]  they were all mushy cardboard boxes and it was pool chairs my dad hadn't put together
[1:51:54.300 --> 1:52:00.460]  because his old chairs fell apart, the next morning I get there at 7am and my dad has
[1:52:00.460 --> 1:52:08.020]  drugged them in the house and is putting them together on the floor, so from 82% oxygen
[1:52:08.020 --> 1:52:15.980]  to 90% oxygen in one day and I don't own stock at any of that, I own no stock, the left is
[1:52:15.980 --> 1:52:22.700]  so selfish I always think what's he own stock in that, I'm telling you what works and it
[1:52:22.700 --> 1:52:27.460]  worked for me and it worked for my wife and it worked for my family and it worked for countless
[1:52:27.460 --> 1:52:33.980]  members of this operation that suddenly wouldn't be at work two months ago and I'd call and
[1:52:33.980 --> 1:52:38.100]  say I don't know what it is I'm really sick, they'd get tested, they would have it, we'd
[1:52:38.100 --> 1:52:42.020]  get them on the regimen and in a day or two they'd be better, so that's what they don't
[1:52:42.020 --> 1:52:45.860]  want you to know, that's what they don't want you to understand, that's what they don't
[1:52:45.860 --> 1:52:52.580]  want you to be aware of and now they're trying to block the Regeneron which I keep calling
[1:52:52.580 --> 1:52:56.660]  Rindesivir because in my brain it's followed the same, totally different because it has
[1:52:56.660 --> 1:53:01.660]  incredible success, I've seen it for myself and they go oh you're down for a big pharma,
[1:53:01.660 --> 1:53:05.860]  oh you're down right, I'm for most of stuff big pharma puts out that's properly tested
[1:53:05.860 --> 1:53:11.700]  and works and is good, if I've got an infection and it's bad I like antibiotics, I don't like
[1:53:11.700 --> 1:53:16.340]  the fact that over time it makes them not work anymore, I take probiotics after, so
[1:53:16.340 --> 1:53:21.500]  the left is all very deceptive about how they have their debates and their arguments, I'm
[1:53:21.500 --> 1:53:25.100]  all for computers, I'm all for smartphones except they're tracking me and watching me
[1:53:25.100 --> 1:53:30.180]  and are going to be used to totally control me, I'm all for a hammer to drive nails, I
[1:53:30.180 --> 1:53:36.060]  don't want to be beat over the head with it and these big pharma companies have got vaccines
[1:53:36.060 --> 1:53:40.980]  with liability protection and no testing now and can push them on us and do what they want
[1:53:40.980 --> 1:53:44.820]  and that's not right and that's dangerous and that's not the American way and if you
[1:53:44.820 --> 1:53:50.980]  want to be in North Korea or some other authoritarian place go there, Australia's reverting back
[1:53:50.980 --> 1:54:00.100]  to being a prison colony, the whole world is reverting back to becoming whatever tyranny
[1:54:00.100 --> 1:54:05.740]  it was, tyranny is the old thing, liberty is the new thing, so I had a bunch of these
[1:54:05.740 --> 1:54:11.460]  clips, I'll plan a little short segment coming up before Dr. Zelenko comes on with us but
[1:54:11.460 --> 1:54:17.540]  I'm not bitching and I'm not complaining but I am overwhelmed, I have definitely reached
[1:54:17.540 --> 1:54:22.140]  an overwhelmed level now where I know you're overwhelmed as well but that's the thing about
[1:54:22.140 --> 1:54:25.900]  naked tyranny, it finally builds up, builds up and then boom hits you, people are like
[1:54:25.900 --> 1:54:30.620]  whoa what is this and they think we're just going to comply with it, do you understand
[1:54:30.620 --> 1:54:34.260]  it's going to get ten times worse if you do, that's the main takeaway, that's the main
[1:54:34.260 --> 1:54:37.860]  thing I'm trying to get across to people and I really appreciate the listeners because
[1:54:37.860 --> 1:54:43.060]  we're all in this fight together and that's why I want to encourage you to support the
[1:54:43.060 --> 1:54:46.900]  broadcast while you get things you need, if they keep shutting down the economy and food
[1:54:46.900 --> 1:54:50.740]  prices keep exploding, we're going to see a total breakdown of the supply chain like
[1:54:50.740 --> 1:54:55.020]  it's happening in Australian areas of Europe and the UK, you need to go to infowarstore.com
[1:54:55.020 --> 1:55:00.060]  where you have a wide selection of high quality, made in America food that is very, very good
[1:55:00.060 --> 1:55:04.140]  at the lowest price you're going to find for quality that's good, it's also packed great,
[1:55:04.140 --> 1:55:08.340]  great containers and most importantly it's ready to ship to you right now, a lot of these
[1:55:08.340 --> 1:55:13.020]  companies take your money and wait a month or whatever, no this stuff turns around within
[1:55:13.020 --> 1:55:17.220]  a day of the order coming in unless it's Sunday, the order on Sunday might take an extra day
[1:55:17.220 --> 1:55:19.140]  or something.
[1:55:19.140 --> 1:55:25.260]  So that's going on infowarstore.com and we also have vitamin mineral fusion, very popular,
[1:55:25.260 --> 1:55:29.220]  all the vitamins, all the essential minerals, all the essential vitamins with key amino
[1:55:29.220 --> 1:55:33.260]  acids and other things that are so good for your immune system and your skin and your
[1:55:33.260 --> 1:55:38.900]  body and everything going on because people die within a month of not having food because
[1:55:38.900 --> 1:55:44.100]  food has all the vitamins and minerals in it and all the major disorders out there in
[1:55:44.100 --> 1:55:50.580]  the problems are generally connected to not having the critical vitamins and minerals,
[1:55:50.580 --> 1:55:53.700]  that's why they call them essential but if they're synthetic or they're not the proper
[1:55:53.700 --> 1:55:57.980]  amount then it doesn't have the same effect and most of it doesn't get into your cells.
[1:55:57.980 --> 1:56:03.860]  This is from all the high quality, highly sourced areas and it is going to end up selling out
[1:56:03.860 --> 1:56:07.420]  by Monday because we've not had enough money to put in big enough orders and before that
[1:56:07.420 --> 1:56:10.780]  we couldn't get it for almost what was it, four or five months because the supply chain
[1:56:10.780 --> 1:56:16.500]  broken down and then so we're going to catch 22 but hopefully it's not a whole or end
[1:56:16.500 --> 1:56:21.580]  but it's like a weird treadmill where there's not enough money to buy enough product to
[1:56:21.580 --> 1:56:25.140]  fund ourselves and we don't buy enough product and then we don't sell enough products, we
[1:56:25.140 --> 1:56:28.380]  don't have enough money to buy more product and it just becomes a catch 22, that's why
[1:56:28.380 --> 1:56:33.460]  I've been really pushing and working harder to plug better and promote better and you
[1:56:33.460 --> 1:56:37.420]  guys have been coming through to get more money to then order more product and launch
[1:56:37.420 --> 1:56:40.780]  some new products that are going to be amazing that are really going to help us not just
[1:56:40.780 --> 1:56:45.500]  sit where we're at but hire more reporters, sponsor more reporters and get more done because
[1:56:45.500 --> 1:56:49.860]  it's our job, we've been so effective together in this fight that we've got to go to the
[1:56:49.860 --> 1:56:52.980]  next level and you've been pulling your way and I salute you and thank you so you got
[1:56:52.980 --> 1:56:57.140]  told Monday, it may sell out before then but I think it looks like Monday, to get vitamin

[1:57:14.900 --> 1:57:18.940]  the vitamin refusion is selling out as we speak but for adults, for children, for old
[1:57:18.940 --> 1:57:23.140]  folks especially black folks, you don't absorb much suns, you've got usually the big vitamin
[1:57:23.140 --> 1:57:27.380]  D deficiencies, it is critical to have it and it's 1995, the highest quality you're
[1:57:27.380 --> 1:57:34.300]  going to find out there, we'll be right back with Drs. Jev Zalinko.
[1:57:34.300 --> 1:57:39.820]  If you think the puppet president, Joe Biden, coming out and announcing that 100 million
[1:57:39.820 --> 1:57:45.460]  Americans are going to be forced to take experimental shots or lose their jobs, understand
[1:57:45.460 --> 1:57:50.300]  we know the blueprint of the UN, they stated their plan, contact tracers coming to your
[1:57:50.300 --> 1:57:56.620]  house, 10 forced injections a year, the destruction of your immune system, the depopulation of
[1:57:56.620 --> 1:58:02.300]  the planet and the vaccine passport on your quote iPhone or droid, tracking and tracing
[1:58:02.300 --> 1:58:05.940]  everything you do and telling you when you can go outside your house or where you can
[1:58:05.940 --> 1:58:12.060]  go, not just for COVID-19 but for carbon taxes, so as I've said a thousand times, submission
[1:58:12.060 --> 1:58:17.100]  is death, you get into this just for your job or to be able to go to the bar or to be
[1:58:17.100 --> 1:58:21.980]  able to quote fly on an airplane, then they're going to slowly put the screws in with these
[1:58:21.980 --> 1:58:26.660]  apps on your phone to control where you go and what you do and dog train you riding a
[1:58:26.660 --> 1:58:27.660]  total slavery.
[1:58:27.660 --> 1:58:35.940]  This is criminal, it's illegal, it's tyranny and we must resist and not comply.
[1:58:35.940 --> 1:58:45.620]  This headline is not a joke, this is America in September of 2020, DC court sends man to
[1:58:45.620 --> 1:58:54.060]  jail for watching conspiracy theory videos online, yes it says the police did a spot
[1:58:54.060 --> 1:59:03.260]  check for quote compliance at his home and found him in his garage watching rumble social
[1:59:03.260 --> 1:59:10.780]  media site which they say is a conspiracy site, also he admitted to watching Mike Lindell's
[1:59:10.780 --> 1:59:15.980]  three day cyber symposium, yes it was part of the conditions of his bail, the judge
[1:59:15.980 --> 1:59:23.140]  said he could not look at any videos questioning the election, no joke and so they sent the
[1:59:23.140 --> 1:59:28.940]  stars into his house and caught him doing it, so now he's going into solitary confinement.
[1:59:28.940 --> 1:59:48.100]  Time has come to America, the republic has fallen.
[1:59:48.100 --> 1:59:52.780]  Man the system is really scared of Donald Trump because he's actually a president, he's
[1:59:52.780 --> 1:59:56.500]  actually a nationalist, he actually cares, he was wrong about the vaccines, he got set
[1:59:56.500 --> 1:59:59.940]  up with that, I wish he'd come out against it, at least he's not for forced injection
[1:59:59.940 --> 2:00:04.380]  like Biden is, but that big Roger Stone interview where he talked to Trump, Trump was intending
[2:00:04.380 --> 2:00:07.500]  to run now, he wasn't before he was telling Roger he wasn't going to, now he's pissed
[2:00:07.500 --> 2:00:12.980]  off what's happening and is going to run, that is so huge, that interview is a banned
[2:00:12.980 --> 2:00:18.620]  video, not one story picked it up, you think that's newsworthy, that Trump told him he
[2:00:18.620 --> 2:00:26.340]  was going to run and nowhere, but you know about it and you can share it, just incredible.
[2:00:26.340 --> 2:00:30.940]  We've got Dr. Vladimir Zelinko coming on, I'm really impressed with him, he's a great
[2:00:30.940 --> 2:00:36.300]  guy that first buy under treatments that have saved millions of lives, we're going to talk
[2:00:36.300 --> 2:00:44.340]  about the new variants and what's coming next with him in the next segment, then I host
[2:00:44.340 --> 2:00:49.580]  the fourth hour with my cat, there's a lot of areas I haven't hit as well, we'll obviously
[2:00:49.580 --> 2:00:53.900]  be going over it with Dr. Zelinko, we'll also talk about Iver Mectin with him and does it
[2:00:53.900 --> 2:00:59.340]  really cause sterility like one study says, I meant to get to this yesterday, I never
[2:00:59.340 --> 2:01:03.940]  did, I will bring it up with Dr. Zelinko at the end of the hour, I've done a bunch of
[2:01:03.940 --> 2:01:08.780]  research and it found out the truth and I'll tell you at the end of the segment what my
[2:01:08.780 --> 2:01:15.380]  finding was but I'm not a doctor like him, here's some reports I want to hit.
[2:01:15.380 --> 2:01:22.380]  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated and it's caused by the fact that despite America
[2:01:22.380 --> 2:01:30.380]  having an unprecedented and successful vaccination program, from the mutated vaccine, five months,
[2:01:30.380 --> 2:01:34.860]  free vaccines have been available in 80,000 different locations, so all the sickest countries
[2:01:34.860 --> 2:01:38.900]  took the most vaccine, we still have nearly 80 million Americans who have failed to get
[2:01:38.900 --> 2:01:44.940]  the shot, this is about freedom for personal choice, that's about tyranny, it's about protecting
[2:01:44.940 --> 2:01:50.020]  yourself, you're a liar, it doesn't protect you, the people you work with, the people
[2:01:50.020 --> 2:01:53.820]  you care about, oh no and show your stay, I made this point and then Greg Guffield did
[2:01:53.820 --> 2:02:02.740]  as well, that's about dividing Americans, what about people that already have learned
[2:02:02.740 --> 2:02:07.860]  a million of you little jackass monkey, with 100 or more employees, I'll just say it'll
[2:02:07.860 --> 2:02:14.740]  hurt you if you take the shot out for it, you murderer, is a murderer, murdering America,
[2:02:14.740 --> 2:02:20.580]  are fully vaccinated, or show a negative test at least once a week, coming up he predicts
[2:02:20.580 --> 2:02:25.780]  a new pandemic, we've been patient, but our patience is wearing thin, our patience sick
[2:02:25.780 --> 2:02:29.940]  of you you punk, refusal has cost all of us, stole the election you maggot, any parts of
[2:02:29.940 --> 2:02:35.740]  my pandemic preparedness plan so that America isn't caught flat footed with a new pandemic
[2:02:35.740 --> 2:02:42.580]  comes again, as it will, great unifier is saying that all those are vaxed are mad at
[2:02:42.580 --> 2:02:47.540]  those that aren't, so this is not true, it's all there to just gin up more animosity and
[2:02:47.540 --> 2:02:52.660]  cause division, basically he said the unvaxxed are the new terrorists, that's what he did,
[2:02:52.660 --> 2:02:57.260]  like he showed more anger towards that 80 million, this amorphous 80 million that he
[2:02:57.260 --> 2:03:02.340]  actually won't specify what constitutes the 80 million, which is kind of interesting,
[2:03:02.340 --> 2:03:07.580]  but he showed more anger towards them than the orderly and kind Taliban, right, the very
[2:03:07.580 --> 2:03:11.580]  business like, he also lied, he lied so much, and he was basically this whole thing was
[2:03:11.580 --> 2:03:17.340]  he was blowing his own horn, because he blew it in Afghanistan, this was his way to show
[2:03:17.340 --> 2:03:22.020]  that maybe he is competent, so he had to gin up the fear, it was a interesting little game
[2:03:22.020 --> 2:03:27.020]  of saying everything's great, but it could just totally go to hell in a minute, and
[2:03:27.020 --> 2:03:30.820]  it wouldn't be my fault, and it wouldn't be my fault, it's these other people's faults,
[2:03:30.820 --> 2:03:37.380]  and then he's comparing the past, like before he got there to now, people have to remember,
[2:03:37.380 --> 2:03:44.980]  this is a guy that said don't trust the vaccines, that's the guy, the same guy who said that
[2:03:44.980 --> 2:03:54.220]  is now saying people who say that are publicly dangerous or endangering public health, and
[2:03:54.220 --> 2:04:01.220]  blocking public health was the word that he used, he talked a lot, I think the thing that
[2:04:01.220 --> 2:04:08.460]  bugs me most about it is that he found an easy target, and it's a target that the media
[2:04:08.460 --> 2:04:13.220]  likes to punch, it's a punching down thing, but he won't say who they are, right, and
[2:04:13.220 --> 2:04:18.540]  I don't trust anyone, especially him, who says the only way to get back to normal is
[2:04:18.540 --> 2:04:25.340]  to do X, but they keep changing X, because on how it affects them politically, so his
[2:04:25.340 --> 2:04:30.380]  government said we're not doing mask mandates as much as like three weeks ago, I'm sorry,
[2:04:30.380 --> 2:04:35.300]  three mandates, that changed, and now he has basically created unlimited power, he has
[2:04:35.300 --> 2:04:42.820]  unlimited power, he can have private businesses fire employees.
[2:04:42.820 --> 2:04:47.460]  Just a week ago we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion back in stock, and it was
[2:04:47.460 --> 2:04:52.340]  only half of the order we wanted to get, but because we won't cut corners on the quality
[2:04:52.340 --> 2:04:56.860]  of what goes into it, the factory can only get limited supply, so again it was half the

[2:06:15.060 --> 2:06:18.620]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:18.620 --> 2:06:25.380]  He joined us a few weeks ago and was really informative, Dr. Vladimir Zevselenko, the
[2:06:25.380 --> 2:06:30.820]  board certified family physician with over 20 years experience, he is the doctor who recommended
[2:06:30.820 --> 2:06:36.340]  that President Trump take hydroxychloroquine and help get that out to the world, Zelinko
[2:06:36.340 --> 2:06:42.180]  protocol is using 99% survival of high risk COVID-19 patients, Dr. Zelinko has been nominated
[2:06:42.180 --> 2:06:47.300]  for the Presidential Medal of Freedom of the Nobel Prize, he's recognized as a hero
[2:06:47.300 --> 2:06:51.060]  at U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing, he's published in top tier review
[2:06:51.060 --> 2:06:55.140]  journals with world renowned physicians, Dr. Zelinko provided counsel, the White House
[2:06:55.140 --> 2:07:02.020]  personnel, multiple governments, hospitals, physicians, public figures, and ZStackLife.com
[2:07:02.020 --> 2:07:09.420]  is an excellent website, the letter ZStackLife.com, and Dr. I've been following you since I saw
[2:07:09.420 --> 2:07:16.220]  you early last year, and you know, heard you in that Giuliani interview and saw you on
[2:07:16.220 --> 2:07:20.220]  Fox News and saw them demonize you, but what you said was true and it's gotten out there,
[2:07:20.220 --> 2:07:24.540]  so we can talk about the attacks on that and hydroxychloroquine and now I've remefted
[2:07:24.540 --> 2:07:30.380]  it and we can talk about the Delta variant and how Biden's saying deny people health
[2:07:30.380 --> 2:07:37.020]  care and his surrogates like Jimmy Kimmel and Howard Stern deny health care to people
[2:07:37.020 --> 2:07:40.740]  that haven't taken these shots, they say we don't care, we've already got learned immunity,
[2:07:40.740 --> 2:07:46.100]  as Israeli study shows 13 to 27 times better than the poison shot, the death shot as you
[2:07:46.100 --> 2:07:50.980]  call it, and him declaring this federal takeover, I talked to three constitutional lawyers
[2:07:50.980 --> 2:07:55.460]  yesterday, one on the air today, and they all said no, this is a federal dictatorship
[2:07:55.460 --> 2:08:00.980]  being set up, he's announcing it, the question is will he successfully implement it, the
[2:08:00.980 --> 2:08:06.860]  takeover of the states, 80 million people forced to be injected, Dr, where do you want
[2:08:06.860 --> 2:08:12.260]  to start here, because you're not just smart and informed when it comes to treatments and
[2:08:12.260 --> 2:08:17.500]  what's happening, I've also seen you on Australian TV, that's where I want to go with you, talking
[2:08:17.500 --> 2:08:21.260]  about the mindset of these people, it's key to understand and the fact that we who are
[2:08:21.260 --> 2:08:27.860]  not homicidal control freaks, megalomaniacs, we can't wrap our minds around this is deliberate,
[2:08:27.860 --> 2:08:33.620]  because most people say oh, Pfizer and Fauci engaged, they're just idiots, well no, I've
[2:08:33.620 --> 2:08:38.380]  read their white papers, they planned all this, they say they want to depopulate us over here,
[2:08:38.380 --> 2:08:42.260]  but now they want to save us with these shots over there, and so you get into that, so you
[2:08:42.260 --> 2:08:47.700]  can start wherever you want, but I do want to get to that during the next 50 minutes,
[2:08:47.700 --> 2:08:50.420]  53 minutes that we have, so thanks for joining us.
[2:08:50.420 --> 2:08:51.500]  Thanks for having me.
[2:08:51.500 --> 2:08:57.980]  So this vaccine, which was always the point of the artificially made buyer weapon was to
[2:08:57.980 --> 2:09:06.660]  motivate 7 billion people to get inoculated, is a weapon of eugenics, it serves multiple
[2:09:06.660 --> 2:09:09.420]  purposes and accomplishes multiple goals.
[2:09:09.420 --> 2:09:16.420]  So for example, it will eliminate a group of people that are prone to blood clots, it
[2:09:16.420 --> 2:09:21.740]  will weaken the hearts of certain people and cause miscarriages, then it will increase
[2:09:21.740 --> 2:09:28.140]  the risk of cancers and or immune diseases, which will lower the lifespan, most likely
[2:09:28.140 --> 2:09:34.020]  affect fertility as well in women, and then a certain large chunk of humanity may go because
[2:09:34.020 --> 2:09:38.500]  of antibody dependent enhancement according to world experts.
[2:09:38.500 --> 2:09:44.900]  Now whoever actually survives these three rounds in the eyes of the eugenicist is someone
[2:09:44.900 --> 2:09:52.180]  who is robust and worthy to propagate the human gene pool, I mean this is no different
[2:09:52.180 --> 2:09:59.100]  than what the Nazis did, they divided humanity into three categories, the superhuman, the
[2:09:59.100 --> 2:10:04.140]  human, and the subhuman, sounds like a fairy tale, except it killed 200 million people,
[2:10:04.140 --> 2:10:10.300]  and they conceived themselves as the superhumans because they were descendants of Nordic gods,
[2:10:10.300 --> 2:10:15.700]  the humans with the Anglo-Saxons that needed to be enslaved to serve the Nordic descendants
[2:10:15.700 --> 2:10:22.020]  of Nordic gods, and the subhumans which I belong to, and Gypsies and Slavs and handicapped
[2:10:22.020 --> 2:10:29.820]  and political prisoners, they needed to be thrown into ovens and vaporized, first they
[2:10:29.820 --> 2:10:30.820]  were gassed.
[2:10:30.820 --> 2:10:40.140]  So what is going on right now is a group of sociopaths that have band together to actualize
[2:10:40.140 --> 2:10:46.820]  a global imprisonment and takeover of the soul of man, and in doing so eliminate a large
[2:10:46.820 --> 2:10:49.860]  percentage of us because we're useless eaters.
[2:10:49.860 --> 2:10:56.540]  This is all ideas that they've expressed going back to David Rockefeller just saw a video
[2:10:56.540 --> 2:11:01.300]  where he was just spewing the stuff and Margaret Sanger and way before that.
[2:11:01.300 --> 2:11:07.140]  So this is nothing new under the sun except that it's an attack on the sanctity of life
[2:11:07.140 --> 2:11:14.460]  itself, an attack on the oneness of God, and the denial of God's creating us and that
[2:11:14.460 --> 2:11:16.900]  we're made in his image.
[2:11:16.900 --> 2:11:21.780]  I would say that is an absolutely 100% spot on from my research, Dr. Zalinko, so how do
[2:11:21.780 --> 2:11:25.580]  we fight back against this from your historical understanding because we know humans do the
[2:11:25.580 --> 2:11:29.180]  same things over and over again and don't seem to learn from our mistakes, hopefully
[2:11:29.180 --> 2:11:33.300]  we can learn from our mistakes now instead of millions dying it's going to be billions
[2:11:33.300 --> 2:11:34.820]  clearly if we don't wake up now.
[2:11:34.820 --> 2:11:40.780]  Well, you know, it's interesting that during World War II, one Nazi with a German Shepherd
[2:11:40.780 --> 2:11:47.220]  and a machine gun could corral a few thousand Jews into a gas chamber, which everyone asks
[2:11:47.220 --> 2:11:51.660]  the question why just turn around and trample him, maybe a few would die around him, but
[2:11:51.660 --> 2:11:57.180]  the majority would live, and the answer is because of the successful psychological warfare
[2:11:57.180 --> 2:12:04.020]  that has softened the targets, the human soul and the human mind, what's happened was that
[2:12:04.020 --> 2:12:08.260]  prolonged fear coupled together with human isolation are two of the most powerful forces
[2:12:08.260 --> 2:12:11.140]  to psychologically destroy a human being.
[2:12:11.140 --> 2:12:16.860]  And once they sustain this type of state, there's a psychological decompensation and
[2:12:16.860 --> 2:12:24.420]  it makes it extremely easy, it will become gullible to run after anything that promises
[2:12:24.420 --> 2:12:27.300]  to reduce their anxiety that they live in.
[2:12:27.300 --> 2:12:28.620]  So it doesn't even have to be true.
[2:12:28.620 --> 2:12:32.620]  So you can wave a fake vaccine in front of them, a golden calf, and they will worship
[2:12:32.620 --> 2:12:39.060]  it because at least in temporary, for the short term, it reduces their anxiety or fear.
[2:12:39.060 --> 2:12:43.220]  Now if you challenge their narrative or you challenge their beliefs, they become belligerent
[2:12:43.220 --> 2:12:47.340]  and violent, because really what you're doing is you're causing them to go back into that
[2:12:47.340 --> 2:12:50.580]  anxiety state that they so deathly don't want to be in.
[2:12:50.580 --> 2:12:56.260]  But it has nothing to do, they've literally lost their minds, it's a mass psychosis.
[2:12:56.260 --> 2:13:01.020]  While you were talking, I was telling the crew, pull up some of the graphics about mass
[2:13:01.020 --> 2:13:04.740]  psychosis, they know exactly what they're doing, how they apply the pressure, then take
[2:13:04.740 --> 2:13:09.860]  it off, apply the pressure, take it off, but over time, I mean this is all very scientific
[2:13:09.860 --> 2:13:12.900]  what they're doing, very cold blooded.
[2:13:12.900 --> 2:13:17.260]  And this is not a theory, you know, it's definitely a conspiracy, but it's not a theory.
[2:13:17.260 --> 2:13:23.020]  The word conspiracy theorist, I don't know if you ever heard that word, but it's been
[2:13:23.020 --> 2:13:27.380]  designed to marginalize anyone who has a working mind.
[2:13:27.380 --> 2:13:33.220]  So in reality, it says in the Bible, NOAA was technically a conspiracy theorist until
[2:13:33.220 --> 2:13:36.340]  it ran, it then stopped being a theory.
[2:13:36.340 --> 2:13:42.700]  So same thing here, the COVID-19 is an artificially made bioweapon, we have proven knowledge
[2:13:42.700 --> 2:13:47.660]  and patents of exactly how it was modified, and we know who did it and when.
[2:13:47.660 --> 2:13:53.540]  So not even the liberal media has the audacity to deny that this is artificially made bioweapon,
[2:13:53.540 --> 2:14:00.300]  that was released on humanity to create a false justification for a eugenics program.
[2:14:00.300 --> 2:14:07.340]  And for example, there's a, I want to give you a patent number, there was a new patent
[2:14:07.340 --> 2:14:10.660]  approved August 31st.
[2:14:10.660 --> 2:14:21.500]  What I should hear is 11107588, US patent 11107588, what it is is explanation on the
[2:14:21.500 --> 2:14:29.420]  mechanics of how the vaccines are going to be used as tracking human beings and monitoring
[2:14:29.420 --> 2:14:35.100]  internal physiological data like temperature and heart rate and other things like that.
[2:14:35.100 --> 2:14:39.820]  So they're admitting now, this is a patent, it was just approved, that in these vaccines
[2:14:39.820 --> 2:14:44.460]  is the groundwork for laying a tracking system.
[2:14:44.460 --> 2:14:52.300]  And that's not surprising because in 2016, the sociopath, Klaus Schwab, in an interview
[2:14:52.300 --> 2:14:58.860]  in French said that within 10 years, the entire population will be tagged with a digital
[2:14:58.860 --> 2:14:59.860]  identifier.
[2:14:59.860 --> 2:15:05.860]  So the beauty with these people, or I call them devolved pagans, is the fact that they
[2:15:05.860 --> 2:15:07.580]  tell you upfront what they're going to do.
[2:15:07.580 --> 2:15:12.100]  His little road mind come many years before it took power.
[2:15:12.100 --> 2:15:15.260]  He lays out the road map of exactly what it's going to do.
[2:15:15.260 --> 2:15:23.420]  And these people are, have the same type of audacity and arrogance because if you look
[2:15:23.420 --> 2:15:26.500]  at Bill Gates in 2015 in a TED lecture.
[2:15:26.500 --> 2:15:27.780]  Dr. Zeliga, stay there.
[2:15:27.780 --> 2:15:31.460]  This is really important history, amazing, riveting, life-saving stuff.
[2:15:31.460 --> 2:15:32.460]  Stay with us.
[2:15:32.460 --> 2:15:36.460]  We'll be right back, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[2:15:36.460 --> 2:15:40.540]  Tomorrow's news today, tell everybody you know, tune in.
[2:15:40.540 --> 2:15:44.340]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:15:44.340 --> 2:15:49.020]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:15:49.020 --> 2:15:50.020]  Here's why.
[2:15:50.020 --> 2:15:53.940]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:15:53.940 --> 2:15:58.940]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:15:58.940 --> 2:16:04.100]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and
[2:16:04.100 --> 2:16:08.060]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:16:08.060 --> 2:16:11.980]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[2:16:11.980 --> 2:16:16.740]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:16:16.740 --> 2:16:22.020]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[2:16:22.020 --> 2:16:23.020]  too.
[2:16:23.020 --> 2:16:26.660]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.

[2:16:39.100 --> 2:16:40.860]  Hey, everybody.
[2:16:40.860 --> 2:16:45.780]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great
[2:16:45.780 --> 2:16:46.780]  news.
[2:16:46.780 --> 2:16:48.860]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[2:16:48.860 --> 2:16:49.860]  Here's the thing.
[2:16:49.860 --> 2:16:55.420]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.
[2:16:55.420 --> 2:17:00.660]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[2:17:00.660 --> 2:17:03.460]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[2:17:03.460 --> 2:17:04.620]  The best part?
[2:17:04.620 --> 2:17:09.540]  We've dropped the price by 33 percent this week for listeners who know higher food prices
[2:17:09.540 --> 2:17:13.900]  are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[2:17:13.900 --> 2:17:14.900]  Gets even better.
[2:17:14.900 --> 2:17:19.580]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want
[2:17:19.580 --> 2:17:24.780]  to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the
[2:17:24.780 --> 2:17:25.780]  world, period.

[2:17:32.220 --> 2:17:41.260]  this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[2:17:41.260 --> 2:17:48.180]  In late August, info or saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that
[2:17:48.180 --> 2:17:54.380]  the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[2:17:54.380 --> 2:17:57.620]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[2:17:57.620 --> 2:18:01.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[2:18:01.140 --> 2:18:06.220]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[2:18:06.220 --> 2:18:08.500]  self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[2:18:08.500 --> 2:18:11.980]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.

[2:18:20.660 --> 2:18:25.100]  going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases
[2:18:25.100 --> 2:18:26.620]  that are already taking place.
[2:18:26.620 --> 2:18:32.860]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at infoorstore.com.
[2:18:32.860 --> 2:18:37.480]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:41.980]  So get prepared now at infoorstore.com.
[2:18:41.980 --> 2:18:49.260]  On September 9th, 2021, the public president, Joe Biden, publicly declared war against America.
[2:18:49.260 --> 2:18:56.620]  He then announced dictatorial powers unto himself and announced forced inoculations against
[2:18:56.620 --> 2:18:57.620]  the American people.
[2:18:57.620 --> 2:19:02.940]  He is a puppet of the United Nations and the Rockefeller Combined of Corporations that
[2:19:02.940 --> 2:19:07.340]  put him in power and he is making a very serious move against the American people.
[2:19:07.340 --> 2:19:11.980]  But the attack he's launched is being launched against every other western country on the
[2:19:11.980 --> 2:19:15.940]  planet by these corporations that have already enslaved the third world.
[2:19:15.940 --> 2:19:20.340]  What they're doing is illegal on its face, violates our federal and state laws and the
[2:19:20.340 --> 2:19:23.460]  Geneva Convention as well as the Nuremberg Code.
[2:19:23.460 --> 2:19:24.740]  It's very, very simple.
[2:19:24.740 --> 2:19:29.180]  We have to decide whether we're going to surrender to this globalist corporate takeover, whether
[2:19:29.180 --> 2:19:33.620]  we're going to stand up with our birthright and say no, and then prosecute these criminals
[2:19:33.620 --> 2:19:37.620]  for their crimes against humanity so other criminals in the future don't dare try it.
[2:19:37.620 --> 2:19:44.260]  The choice is up to us.
[2:19:44.260 --> 2:19:54.260]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:19:54.260 --> 2:20:14.140]  Dr. Vladimir Zelikos, our guest at the end of the hour, I really appreciate him joining
[2:20:14.140 --> 2:20:15.140]  us.
[2:20:15.140 --> 2:20:19.020]  I know he's very, very busy and we'll tell you more about his website and some of the
[2:20:19.020 --> 2:20:21.820]  things he's up to before he leaves us here today.
[2:20:21.820 --> 2:20:25.180]  He got cut off by the break, these are hard breaks with the satellites, the radio stations,
[2:20:25.180 --> 2:20:27.180]  or I'd skip them.
[2:20:27.180 --> 2:20:29.420]  I used to, the station's got mad.
[2:20:29.420 --> 2:20:31.860]  You were getting into David Rockefeller and this whole project.
[2:20:31.860 --> 2:20:35.460]  That's what's so frustrating to me is you can find them at the World War II because
[2:20:35.460 --> 2:20:38.780]  we know the Rockefellers funded Hitler and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and Cold Springs
[2:20:38.780 --> 2:20:40.540]  Harbor Eugenics Lab in New York.
[2:20:40.540 --> 2:20:45.060]  It's in mainline history, they have congressional hearings, they said we've got to go underground
[2:20:45.060 --> 2:20:49.060]  with this and now they've done it hiding behind medicine, hiding behind vaccines, the Rockefeller
[2:20:49.060 --> 2:20:53.220]  Foundation, Operation Lockstep talks about a global dictatorship they're going to set
[2:20:53.220 --> 2:20:58.900]  up using the fear of a virus and so now here we are and you were just giving a patent about
[2:20:58.900 --> 2:21:03.900]  vaccines that have these little nanoparticles that then become part of a tracking system.
[2:21:03.900 --> 2:21:11.540]  So yes, this is their whole rollout, it's here, it's insane, please continue, Dr. Zelinko.
[2:21:11.540 --> 2:21:19.340]  So the solution, the prescription for staying a human being with sovereign rights and staying
[2:21:19.340 --> 2:21:25.540]  alive is very simple, just look at what King David writes in Psalms, he writes, turn away
[2:21:25.540 --> 2:21:29.260]  from bad, do good and live.
[2:21:29.260 --> 2:21:33.740]  So let's define the terms, turn away from bad means do not give into the fear and to
[2:21:33.740 --> 2:21:39.100]  the isolation, in other words you'll keep your mind and stay away from this weapon of
[2:21:39.100 --> 2:21:42.180]  hemogenics or this poison death shot that has no medical indication.
[2:21:42.180 --> 2:21:47.580]  If you do that, you're halfway there and if you're high risk or moderate to high risk,
[2:21:47.580 --> 2:21:56.180]  do good means you should be on antiviral prophylaxis, cheap and safe generic drugs that will prevent
[2:21:56.180 --> 2:22:01.340]  you from getting COVID or if you do get COVID, it will make it mild and if you do get sick
[2:22:01.340 --> 2:22:06.100]  because nothing's 100%, you have to start aggressive early antiviral treatment, meaning
[2:22:06.100 --> 2:22:09.780]  within the first five days of the disease and you'll live.
[2:22:09.780 --> 2:22:16.900]  This is a very simple formula, this is common sense, everyone knows in medicine that suddenly
[2:22:16.900 --> 2:22:18.820]  you treat something to better the outcomes.
[2:22:18.820 --> 2:22:22.100]  And I want to talk about Ivern Mectin and hydroxychloric the next segment, but you got
[2:22:22.100 --> 2:22:26.780]  cut off and I apologize, get in back to David Rockefeller, you were saying something about
[2:22:26.780 --> 2:22:31.980]  David Rockefeller when we had to go to break to understand why they're doing this and laying
[2:22:31.980 --> 2:22:37.660]  it out and then trying to suppress known prophylaxis and then known early treatments and if you
[2:22:37.660 --> 2:22:41.860]  like to get into it now, speak to people and explain what Ivern Mectin or hydroxychloric
[2:22:41.860 --> 2:22:42.860]  one do.
[2:22:42.860 --> 2:22:47.620]  Oh, they're very dangerous, what they do is they get zinc inside the cell, that's all
[2:22:47.620 --> 2:22:54.860]  they do, it's all about the zinc, the zinc inhibits the viruses from growing and you just
[2:22:54.860 --> 2:22:59.460]  have to get enough zinc inside the cell to be able to do the job fully, the zinc cannot
[2:22:59.460 --> 2:23:06.900]  get into the cell, it's like oil and water, they don't mix, so there are a class of compounds
[2:23:06.900 --> 2:23:12.660]  that open up a door and let the zinc go inside, there are four of them that are readily available,
[2:23:12.660 --> 2:23:18.580]  two of them are prescription, it's Ivern Mectin and hydroxychloric, and two of them are over
[2:23:18.580 --> 2:23:25.300]  the counter, which is quercetin and EGCG, which is a green tea extract, and that's all
[2:23:25.300 --> 2:23:27.980]  they do and they're safe.
[2:23:27.980 --> 2:23:31.020]  Just in Australia today, they banned Ivern Mectin.
[2:23:31.020 --> 2:23:36.500]  So if you really want to know what works, you just have to do the opposite of what the
[2:23:36.500 --> 2:23:41.740]  federal agencies are recommending, because whenever we get over-target, whenever we are
[2:23:41.740 --> 2:23:47.860]  close to a solution and we have a way of reducing the global fear, that's when the opposition
[2:23:47.860 --> 2:23:52.500]  against any substance, it could be a paperclip, if I tell people that this paperclip holding
[2:23:52.500 --> 2:23:58.060]  on to it will save your life, the government will eventually make paperclips illegal.
[2:23:58.060 --> 2:24:03.740]  My point being, it's all about the control of the fear narrative so that they can manipulate
[2:24:03.740 --> 2:24:09.380]  your behavior into self-executing yourself or enslaving yourself.
[2:24:09.380 --> 2:24:12.740]  Well, doctor, let me just back you up, you don't just have all the studies, you don't
[2:24:12.740 --> 2:24:18.700]  just have them, you can go to the NIH website, you can go to the CDC website, FDA website,
[2:24:18.700 --> 2:24:22.180]  type in Ivern Mectin studies, hydroxychloric studies, and there's hundreds of them and
[2:24:22.180 --> 2:24:26.140]  almost all of them are positive and they say what you just said about zinc into the cell.
[2:24:26.140 --> 2:24:29.500]  But when you were wrong with us two weeks ago, I didn't have authorization at that time
[2:24:29.500 --> 2:24:32.880]  to talk about it, because my parents are very private, they wanted people to know after.
[2:24:32.880 --> 2:24:37.820]  My dad and mother didn't tell me they had COVID, the Delta variant for a week, they didn't
[2:24:37.820 --> 2:24:43.100]  get medical help, my dad was like an 80% oxygen, looked like he was dead, within one day of
[2:24:43.100 --> 2:24:48.100]  going on the regimen that you and others have been promoted, my dad was back up putting
[2:24:48.100 --> 2:24:53.300]  furniture together that had just come, you know, some lawn chairs, pool chairs, and was
[2:24:53.300 --> 2:24:56.140]  literally completely, basically better in two days.
[2:24:56.140 --> 2:24:59.500]  And if I took him to the hospital, they would have given him nothing and stuck a tube down
[2:24:59.500 --> 2:25:03.500]  his throat and I would have been burying him weeks ago, so I experienced it, I experienced
[2:25:03.500 --> 2:25:07.980]  most of my crew getting it, and friends and family, it's just raced through Texas and
[2:25:07.980 --> 2:25:11.460]  when they get on this, it's amazing if they get early treatment.
[2:25:11.460 --> 2:25:15.820]  So to watch them try to suppress that, they're literally trying to murder me and my family
[2:25:15.820 --> 2:25:20.260]  and murder everybody else, this is criminal.
[2:25:20.260 --> 2:25:25.380]  It's the worst crime in human history.
[2:25:25.380 --> 2:25:32.900]  And I think the amount of malfeasance and malevolence that has been venomous, feudant,
[2:25:32.900 --> 2:25:37.300]  decent normal people is a biblical scale.
[2:25:37.300 --> 2:25:43.060]  And all we need to do, and it's just to wake up, because there's many more of us in them,
[2:25:43.060 --> 2:25:48.740]  the difference between Australia and us is we have 450 million guns in the hands of citizens,
[2:25:48.740 --> 2:25:55.380]  which the Second Amendment allows us to have to bear arms against tyrannical government.
[2:25:55.380 --> 2:26:01.820]  So the reason why the Biden's not sending in people literally into your house to hold
[2:26:01.820 --> 2:26:06.020]  you down is because there's going to be a different type of shot given.
[2:26:06.020 --> 2:26:11.180]  You think normal Americans will allow for their innocent children to be inoculated with
[2:26:11.180 --> 2:26:13.220]  something with a hundred to one killer ratio?
[2:26:13.220 --> 2:26:19.300]  Dr. Michael Yiddon, who ran Pfizer, said the following, that for every one child that dies
[2:26:19.300 --> 2:26:27.300]  from COVID naturally, a hundred die from the vaccine, but a hundred to one killer ratio.
[2:26:27.300 --> 2:26:30.940]  So if that's not child sacrifice, then how would you define it?
[2:26:30.940 --> 2:26:35.940]  What's the difference of me throwing a child into a volcano or me injecting a child with
[2:26:35.940 --> 2:26:38.460]  a liquid that he doesn't need?
[2:26:38.460 --> 2:26:43.260]  Why does every culture throughout the last 6,000, 7,000 years record history always end
[2:26:43.260 --> 2:26:45.580]  up sacrificing children?
[2:26:45.580 --> 2:26:46.980]  You're a smart guy.
[2:26:46.980 --> 2:26:47.980]  Where is that coming from?
[2:26:47.980 --> 2:26:52.300]  Well, good and evil work in not-as-a-dways.
[2:26:52.300 --> 2:26:59.020]  In good, the normal parent will wish for their children to have a better life than them.
[2:26:59.020 --> 2:27:02.500]  They, the parents, will sacrifice for their children.
[2:27:02.500 --> 2:27:09.180]  In evil societies, we sacrifice children for the adults.
[2:27:09.180 --> 2:27:16.020]  In other words, the rationale for giving children who don't need it is so that a grandma doesn't
[2:27:16.020 --> 2:27:17.020]  get sick.
[2:27:17.020 --> 2:27:23.340]  If you're such a believer in this vaccine, so give it to grandma, leave the kids alone.
[2:27:23.340 --> 2:27:29.340]  So they simply go after the youth because there's a satanic thrill or an evil thrill in going
[2:27:29.340 --> 2:27:32.780]  against your instincts and hurting a child.
[2:27:32.780 --> 2:27:43.380]  Look, I think we're dealing with the primordial serpent incarnate that we're dealing with.
[2:27:43.380 --> 2:27:44.980]  It has many heads.
[2:27:44.980 --> 2:27:48.620]  Biggest head is perhaps China, but it's not the only head.
[2:27:48.620 --> 2:27:52.220]  And there's nothing new under the sun.
[2:27:52.220 --> 2:27:54.540]  They're replaying biblical narratives.
[2:27:54.540 --> 2:27:56.940]  All the forces that play between good and evil.
[2:27:56.940 --> 2:28:03.140]  If you look at the first war in human history, it was between two brothers, Cain and Abel.
[2:28:03.140 --> 2:28:05.100]  And what was the reason for that war?
[2:28:05.100 --> 2:28:11.660]  Well, they both brought an offering, and God took Abel's, but not Cain's.
[2:28:11.660 --> 2:28:13.940]  So he created a dominant hierarchy.
[2:28:13.940 --> 2:28:19.060]  So Cain was upset, so God said to him, why are you upset?
[2:28:19.060 --> 2:28:22.500]  Improve yourself, and I will take your offering as well.
[2:28:22.500 --> 2:28:23.500]  What did he choose to do?
[2:28:23.500 --> 2:28:25.700]  He killed the competition, killed his brother.
[2:28:25.700 --> 2:28:27.300]  That's human history in the nutshell.
[2:28:27.300 --> 2:28:30.860]  Wow, that is the best description I would ever say there, Doc, longer segment coming
[2:28:30.860 --> 2:28:31.860]  up.
[2:28:31.860 --> 2:28:32.860]  Man, amazing.
[2:28:32.860 --> 2:28:33.860]  Absolutely amazing.
[2:28:33.860 --> 2:28:38.740]  We'll give you his website when we come back.
[2:28:38.740 --> 2:28:42.540]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:28:42.540 --> 2:28:47.220]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:28:47.220 --> 2:28:48.220]  Here's why.
[2:28:48.220 --> 2:28:52.180]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:28:52.180 --> 2:28:57.180]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:28:57.180 --> 2:29:02.380]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and
[2:29:02.380 --> 2:29:06.260]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:06.260 --> 2:29:10.180]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[2:29:10.180 --> 2:29:14.940]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:14.940 --> 2:29:20.180]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[2:29:20.180 --> 2:29:21.180]  too.

[2:29:39.500 --> 2:29:44.260]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[2:29:44.260 --> 2:29:46.300]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[2:29:46.300 --> 2:29:52.020]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[2:29:52.020 --> 2:29:53.020]  But we failed.
[2:29:53.020 --> 2:29:54.460]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[2:29:54.460 --> 2:30:00.260]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[2:30:00.260 --> 2:30:02.620]  deindustrialization great reset.
[2:30:02.620 --> 2:30:06.900]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[2:30:06.900 --> 2:30:11.500]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[2:30:11.500 --> 2:30:14.740]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, and
[2:30:14.740 --> 2:30:16.540]  we've also got to get personally prepared.
[2:30:16.540 --> 2:30:19.420]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[2:30:19.420 --> 2:30:24.380]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[2:30:24.380 --> 2:30:28.380]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[2:30:28.380 --> 2:30:29.780]  to ship right now.
[2:30:29.780 --> 2:30:34.940]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[2:30:34.940 --> 2:30:37.180]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[2:30:37.180 --> 2:30:39.820]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[2:30:39.820 --> 2:30:44.700]  There are numbers of three humans across the planet, from Australia to Germany to the United
[2:30:44.700 --> 2:30:51.140]  States to Canada to Mexico, from Brazil to South Africa, understand we're under a great
[2:30:51.140 --> 2:30:54.380]  reset UN globalist attack.
[2:30:54.380 --> 2:31:00.620]  But none of our leaders other than Bolsonaro had trumped a little bit, seemed to understand
[2:31:00.620 --> 2:31:01.620]  that.
[2:31:01.620 --> 2:31:07.180]  And so no one is addressing the fact that this is a 21st century corporate economic war
[2:31:07.180 --> 2:31:12.500]  on the general population and the conversion of the planet into a high tech technocracy
[2:31:12.500 --> 2:31:19.620]  with a global IP, global medical system, global medical, control, ID, and of course a carbon
[2:31:19.620 --> 2:31:23.300]  taxes that tied to that, the tractor every movement.
[2:31:23.300 --> 2:31:24.300]  This is their takeover.
[2:31:24.300 --> 2:31:28.420]  They've admitted it, they've said it, for no, the Prime Minister of Canada is on TV
[2:31:28.420 --> 2:31:33.580]  yesterday saying this is an environmental takeover plan, and the whole lockdowns have
[2:31:33.580 --> 2:31:35.740]  just taught you to prepare for climate lockdowns.
[2:31:35.740 --> 2:31:39.180]  So they're announcing their takeover, we've got to resist it and say no.
[2:31:39.180 --> 2:31:42.140]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[2:31:42.140 --> 2:31:45.060]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[2:31:45.060 --> 2:31:48.140]  Monday at midnight we've got to end this sale.
[2:31:48.140 --> 2:31:52.860]  We may end it earlier because we think it'll sell out by then at current sales rates.

[2:32:42.460 --> 2:33:01.500]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:01.500 --> 2:33:08.900]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:08.900 --> 2:33:15.140]  ZStackLives.com is the great site, great literature, great information and also we'll tell you
[2:33:15.140 --> 2:33:19.900]  about it next segment, a great combination of things the doctors put together that are
[2:33:19.900 --> 2:33:24.860]  absolutely documented, give your body incredible natural defenses, we'll talk about that.
[2:33:24.860 --> 2:33:28.020]  The enemy doesn't want people ready, they don't want you prepared, they try to demonize
[2:33:28.020 --> 2:33:29.460]  folks and give people prepared.
[2:33:29.460 --> 2:33:34.780]  We're not trying to mandate vitamins and minerals and course it into people, we're just simply
[2:33:34.780 --> 2:33:39.140]  saying you should obviously try to defend your body as much as you can.
[2:33:39.140 --> 2:33:42.700]  Dr. Zalinko, I want to get you on one of my commercial free podcasts sometime we can
[2:33:42.700 --> 2:33:46.820]  take in the evening or do Sunday or something so you're commercial free but that's part
[2:33:46.820 --> 2:33:50.380]  of the thing being on hundreds of radio stations as there's 14 minutes at ads an hour which
[2:33:50.380 --> 2:33:53.780]  is fine, I just really like to hear from you.
[2:33:53.780 --> 2:33:56.140]  You bring up so many great points that I've been guiding the interview.
[2:33:56.140 --> 2:33:59.620]  If you want to finish up with Ken and Abel and why the globalists are targeting us to
[2:33:59.620 --> 2:34:04.180]  get rid of their competition or do you want to elaborate on the speech last night because
[2:34:04.180 --> 2:34:07.140]  you're a smart guy and I want to ask you where do you want to go next?
[2:34:07.140 --> 2:34:11.180]  I've got plenty of questions but what do you want to impart to this audience of over two
[2:34:11.180 --> 2:34:13.580]  million people tuned in right now?
[2:34:13.580 --> 2:34:17.740]  I'm incredibly optimistic about the future, it's going to be bumpy until we get there
[2:34:17.740 --> 2:34:27.140]  but I do believe we're on the cusp of a redemptive event and there's no room in this new society
[2:34:27.140 --> 2:34:28.780]  per slave mentality.
[2:34:28.780 --> 2:34:32.740]  So what we're seeing is the segregation of two groups, there's going to be some cities
[2:34:32.740 --> 2:34:38.900]  of refuge where people want to live in a God-centered consciousness way and there will be the rest
[2:34:38.900 --> 2:34:44.580]  of everyone else which will coalesce into continents of tyranny and that will naturally
[2:34:44.580 --> 2:34:45.580]  self-select itself.
[2:34:45.580 --> 2:34:54.620]  In other words, I think that God has had enough of this falsehood of the child sacrifice,
[2:34:54.620 --> 2:35:02.220]  the human sacrifice, aborting the innocent and I just, you know, it says in the Talmud
[2:35:02.220 --> 2:35:07.740]  that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed and everyone says because of immorality and that's
[2:35:07.740 --> 2:35:10.740]  not true because every place in the world is immoral.
[2:35:10.740 --> 2:35:14.860]  The difference between Sodom and Gomorrah and everywhere else was they codified immorality
[2:35:14.860 --> 2:35:16.740]  into the law of the land.
[2:35:16.740 --> 2:35:24.340]  It became part of the law and became normalized and that's where, that's been the crux of
[2:35:24.340 --> 2:35:34.740]  America's problem, its demoralization, its loss of Judeo-Christian values and this drive
[2:35:34.740 --> 2:35:37.980]  towards paganism and atheism.
[2:35:37.980 --> 2:35:47.620]  And so in his time there was a, what's the name, psychoanalyst, he wrote that the moral
[2:35:47.620 --> 2:35:53.260]  degradation of the society, the moral degradation of the society begins with the degradation
[2:35:53.260 --> 2:35:56.620]  of the individual and the opposite is also true.
[2:35:56.620 --> 2:36:00.500]  The moral improvement of the society is by the elevation of the individual.
[2:36:00.500 --> 2:36:04.460]  And that goes back to Carl Jung and what you're talking about mass psychosis.
[2:36:04.460 --> 2:36:08.060]  As you're saying one group's going to get deeper into psychosis and have psychotic breaks
[2:36:08.060 --> 2:36:11.380]  and then another group's going to get closer to God and closer to reality and we're just
[2:36:11.380 --> 2:36:15.620]  going to naturally, you know, the goats from the sheep, the wheat from the chaff, we're
[2:36:15.620 --> 2:36:16.620]  going to separate.
[2:36:16.620 --> 2:36:22.460]  Well, you know, in the Garden of Eden, there was a tree of knowledge or good and bad.
[2:36:22.460 --> 2:36:24.820]  The implication is that there was good and bad.
[2:36:24.820 --> 2:36:26.980]  However, before the sin, it wasn't mixed up.
[2:36:26.980 --> 2:36:30.740]  It was very clear where it was good and where it was bad.
[2:36:30.740 --> 2:36:33.460]  After the sin, it became a very confused world.
[2:36:33.460 --> 2:36:39.420]  However, right now I see it self-selecting back into that Garden of Eden state from the
[2:36:39.420 --> 2:36:45.660]  perspective of clarity because you could see clearly that the forces of evil, if you want
[2:36:45.660 --> 2:36:51.260]  to talk about Biden's speech, anything, anyone or anything that increases fear and panic
[2:36:51.260 --> 2:36:54.940]  and anxiety, you should know it's coming from the primordial serpent.
[2:36:54.940 --> 2:36:57.980]  Now, Biden's demented.
[2:36:57.980 --> 2:37:00.020]  He has, I think, Parkinson's disease.
[2:37:00.020 --> 2:37:07.140]  You could tell by the shuffle gate and the blunted affect or some type of atypical dementia.
[2:37:07.140 --> 2:37:11.420]  But he should be receiving elder care, not being abused.
[2:37:11.420 --> 2:37:12.420]  This is elder abuse.
[2:37:12.420 --> 2:37:18.460]  They're pumping up with so many stimulants in order just to keep him from just to say
[2:37:18.460 --> 2:37:19.980]  he could read a script.
[2:37:19.980 --> 2:37:22.580]  So he's not the think tank behind this.
[2:37:22.580 --> 2:37:26.940]  Obviously, he's a puppet that's being, a marionette that's being pulled, the strings
[2:37:26.940 --> 2:37:28.820]  are being pulled by someone else.
[2:37:28.820 --> 2:37:31.500]  So it really doesn't matter to me what he says.
[2:37:31.500 --> 2:37:37.940]  I just view him as a demented old man that I believe should be with his family.
[2:37:37.940 --> 2:37:41.220]  But what he did puppet was increasing fear.
[2:37:41.220 --> 2:37:42.220]  And that is evil.
[2:37:42.220 --> 2:37:50.020]  And if you want to see what good is, it's the movement to, to faith and to in the mix
[2:37:50.020 --> 2:37:55.500]  of this chaos, you see, anxiety lives in a psychological space for God's action.
[2:37:55.500 --> 2:38:02.020]  So to fill the void with faith is the solution to not succumbing to the fear and the anxiety
[2:38:02.020 --> 2:38:04.740]  and choosing to walk yourself into it.
[2:38:04.740 --> 2:38:07.940]  And Dr, what you're saying is beautiful and it's timeless and it's touching me.
[2:38:07.940 --> 2:38:12.380]  I've had so, I've had so much anxiety about fighting this and knowing it was coming, but
[2:38:12.380 --> 2:38:14.620]  I've also been calm and fulfilled in many ways.
[2:38:14.620 --> 2:38:19.380]  But it happened about three, four weeks ago, actually, my parents were sick.
[2:38:19.380 --> 2:38:24.500]  I just prayed to God to give me clarity and literally I just felt God say, this is a test.
[2:38:24.500 --> 2:38:27.980]  You need to lead others and stand up and be good.
[2:38:27.980 --> 2:38:29.820]  This is going to separate the good from the evil.
[2:38:29.820 --> 2:38:32.180]  This is what you've been asking for.
[2:38:32.180 --> 2:38:35.980]  And I just felt clarity and strength and that quiet place.
[2:38:35.980 --> 2:38:40.220]  The most high King David talked about, I am more and more feeling that is that what you're
[2:38:40.220 --> 2:38:41.220]  talking about?
[2:38:41.220 --> 2:38:50.660]  Yeah, I have the same sense of confidence that my, I'm living my purpose, but it seems
[2:38:50.660 --> 2:38:57.420]  into intuition that God has placed me in a, in a certain place in history where now I
[2:38:57.420 --> 2:39:03.980]  feel like all my skills and, and turbulence is and problems suffering life, they all gave
[2:39:03.980 --> 2:39:09.620]  me the skill set to be able to manage the pressure and that is, that's what I exactly,
[2:39:09.620 --> 2:39:12.060]  I feel like I'm fulfilled now.
[2:39:12.060 --> 2:39:13.060]  That's it.
[2:39:13.060 --> 2:39:14.060]  It's, it's, I'm not even afraid.
[2:39:14.060 --> 2:39:15.060]  I'm focused.
[2:39:15.060 --> 2:39:19.860]  I'm not some of my old arrogance and maybe my or evil side that we all have is like falling
[2:39:19.860 --> 2:39:22.420]  away and I'm feeling like I'm becoming sanctified.
[2:39:22.420 --> 2:39:23.420]  Is that what you're saying?
[2:39:23.420 --> 2:39:24.420]  You feel?
[2:39:24.420 --> 2:39:30.180]  Well, that's what God decided for other people, you know, I get a lot of praising being, I'm
[2:39:30.180 --> 2:39:34.420]  praise a lot for sitting people and I have like cognitive dissonance, I, I don't view
[2:39:34.420 --> 2:39:35.420]  myself that way.
[2:39:35.420 --> 2:39:40.460]  I'm just that, you know, but, but I'm not stupid and I see that I, I was thrust into
[2:39:40.460 --> 2:39:42.260]  a very unique position.
[2:39:42.260 --> 2:39:47.620]  So I don't take it, I try not to get my ego in the way because I think that that, that
[2:39:47.620 --> 2:39:53.900]  is a weighted self-destruction, especially what I'm saying is they say people are made
[2:39:53.900 --> 2:39:55.860]  by the times they're in, but God prepares them.
[2:39:55.860 --> 2:39:59.500]  I'm saying everybody I know who's awake is feeling this as well.
[2:39:59.500 --> 2:40:04.020]  They have this sense of confidence and overcoming and I think that that's what you're saying
[2:40:04.020 --> 2:40:07.340]  is you're, you're really feeling that as well.
[2:40:07.340 --> 2:40:08.340]  Truth is truth.
[2:40:08.340 --> 2:40:13.300]  What you're saying and what I think they're saying, what I feel is that when someone finds
[2:40:13.300 --> 2:40:19.060]  truth, he doesn't need to be convinced that it's an intuition and I've never been more
[2:40:19.060 --> 2:40:26.500]  certain in the unity of God and his omnipresence is ubiquitous omnipresence and his love for
[2:40:26.500 --> 2:40:29.300]  anyone who just chooses to have a relationship with that.
[2:40:29.300 --> 2:40:31.900]  The problem is most people are choosing to run away from that.
[2:40:31.900 --> 2:40:39.140]  And I think that this is the, a global opportunity to, you know, it said that Noah, it took him
[2:40:39.140 --> 2:40:41.460]  120 years to build the ark.
[2:40:41.460 --> 2:40:42.980]  So why?
[2:40:42.980 --> 2:40:45.980]  Because he was supposed to, people were coming and asking him, Noah, what are you doing?
[2:40:45.980 --> 2:40:49.700]  And he should have said, well, God is really angry at you, you should repent and join the
[2:40:49.700 --> 2:40:51.460]  team and you'll be saved as well.
[2:40:51.460 --> 2:40:52.460]  And he didn't do that.
[2:40:52.460 --> 2:40:58.980]  But the point is that we have an opportunity to spread higher levels of consciousness.
[2:40:58.980 --> 2:41:03.700]  And I don't really care about organized religion in that context, because whenever it's organized,
[2:41:03.700 --> 2:41:04.700]  it becomes corrupt.
[2:41:04.700 --> 2:41:09.580]  But more of the concept, the intuition and the belief that there's a power greater than
[2:41:09.580 --> 2:41:14.180]  you that's making you every second from nothing and that you have to get the homage to that
[2:41:14.180 --> 2:41:15.180]  power.
[2:41:15.180 --> 2:41:18.500]  And from that, you derive the confidence and the strength to persevere.
[2:41:18.500 --> 2:41:20.780]  And that's true for every religion, by the way.
[2:41:20.780 --> 2:41:23.900]  So I try to focus on what unites us.
[2:41:23.900 --> 2:41:28.500]  There's enough force in trying to separate us and when we get separate, we can get conquered.
[2:41:28.500 --> 2:41:35.260]  But to go against the entropy, to go against chaos and to find order, to organize nonviolent
[2:41:35.260 --> 2:41:36.260]  resistance.
[2:41:36.260 --> 2:41:37.660]  Because that's all it takes.
[2:41:37.660 --> 2:41:44.380]  It just takes enough people, critical mass of people, just to say, no, no, I will not
[2:41:44.380 --> 2:41:46.500]  take this shot.
[2:41:46.500 --> 2:41:49.580]  And I'm ready to sacrifice everything to protect my family.
[2:41:49.580 --> 2:41:51.900]  You see, I'm not so afraid of dying.
[2:41:51.900 --> 2:41:55.020]  And you can see how upset they are, Dr. Zomeko.
[2:41:55.020 --> 2:41:56.940]  I mean, they are being driven.
[2:41:56.940 --> 2:41:57.940]  You look at these world leaders.
[2:41:57.940 --> 2:41:58.940]  They're clearly not leaders.
[2:41:58.940 --> 2:41:59.940]  They're puppets.
[2:41:59.940 --> 2:42:03.940]  They're slaves being driven by this evil force that's got dirt on them.
[2:42:03.940 --> 2:42:09.500]  You know, you don't become a leader of a country without becoming a prostitute first.
[2:42:09.500 --> 2:42:12.540]  I think that's a job prerequisite in description.
[2:42:12.540 --> 2:42:14.620]  You sell yourself.
[2:42:14.620 --> 2:42:15.620]  I agree.
[2:42:15.620 --> 2:42:16.620]  Final segment with Dr. Zomeko.
[2:42:16.620 --> 2:42:17.620]  We're going to talk about science.
[2:42:17.620 --> 2:42:21.380]  We're going to talk about protecting ourselves and more, whatever he wants to hit.
[2:42:21.380 --> 2:42:26.220]  I've got to say, of all these amazing doctors, he's my favorite guest, definitely we are
[2:42:26.220 --> 2:42:28.860]  in simpatico on what's going on.
[2:42:28.860 --> 2:42:29.860]  Stay with us.
[2:42:29.860 --> 2:42:30.860]  We'll be right back.
[2:42:30.860 --> 2:42:37.660]  And then Mike Adams, a health ranger, he's loaded for bear.
[2:42:37.660 --> 2:42:44.140]  What was the most important point in Joe Biden's declaration of war against America on Thursday,
[2:42:44.140 --> 2:42:46.700]  September 9, 2021?
[2:42:46.700 --> 2:42:51.420]  Was it the announcement of force inoculations of 80 to 100 million Americans?
[2:42:51.420 --> 2:42:56.220]  Was it the announcement of federalization of all the major cities, the bypassing of
[2:42:56.220 --> 2:42:59.220]  state governors, the threat to basically remove them?
[2:42:59.220 --> 2:43:00.620]  No, it wasn't.
[2:43:00.620 --> 2:43:02.620]  That was all bad enough.
[2:43:02.620 --> 2:43:08.540]  It's the fact that he's following a UN globalist great recent blueprint that Australia, the
[2:43:08.540 --> 2:43:13.820]  UK, Europe, and the rest of the Western world is, and that this is just the beginning.
[2:43:13.820 --> 2:43:20.020]  More lockdowns, national medical IDs approved by the United Nations, carbon taxes that don't
[2:43:20.020 --> 2:43:24.260]  just track the trace to attach you, but actually tell you when you can go somewhere and what
[2:43:24.260 --> 2:43:25.260]  you can do.
[2:43:25.260 --> 2:43:27.460]  It's all been announced at the UN level.
[2:43:27.460 --> 2:43:33.660]  This is a UN world government takeover, corporate revolution through global governments.
[2:43:33.660 --> 2:43:37.340]  It's illegal, and Congress must stand up and stop it now.
[2:43:37.340 --> 2:43:42.820]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[2:43:42.820 --> 2:43:48.500]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection
[2:43:48.500 --> 2:43:52.740]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[2:43:52.740 --> 2:43:57.860]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[2:43:57.860 --> 2:44:02.700]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[2:44:02.700 --> 2:44:06.980]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening, and
[2:44:06.980 --> 2:44:12.020]  it's unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[2:44:12.020 --> 2:44:15.100]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[2:44:15.100 --> 2:44:18.460]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[2:44:18.460 --> 2:44:23.100]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[2:44:23.100 --> 2:44:24.100]  an end.
[2:44:24.100 --> 2:44:29.860]  And so we must prepare, get up to a years worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival
[2:44:29.860 --> 2:44:38.100]  gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[2:44:38.100 --> 2:44:41.580]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[2:44:41.580 --> 2:44:45.700]  I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[2:44:45.700 --> 2:44:48.860]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[2:44:48.860 --> 2:44:51.980]  The big, loveless publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they
[2:44:51.980 --> 2:44:53.260]  can to shut us down.
[2:44:53.260 --> 2:44:57.580]  So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air, and please support the local station you're
[2:44:57.580 --> 2:44:58.580]  listening to as well.
[2:44:58.580 --> 2:45:03.740]  And at the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can, and get a book, get
[2:45:03.740 --> 2:45:08.800]  a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay
[2:45:08.800 --> 2:45:11.020]  on air in the face of this thing.
[2:45:11.020 --> 2:45:13.140]  I need your help more than ever now.
[2:45:13.140 --> 2:45:17.460]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[2:45:17.460 --> 2:45:22.460]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy
[2:45:22.460 --> 2:45:28.060]  great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.

[2:45:32.740 --> 2:45:37.620]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[2:45:37.620 --> 2:45:38.620]  Thank you so much.
[2:45:38.620 --> 2:45:41.740]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[2:45:41.740 --> 2:45:44.660]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[2:45:44.660 --> 2:45:47.700]  Monday at midnight, we've got to end this sale.
[2:45:47.700 --> 2:45:52.420]  We may end it earlier, because we think it'll sell out by then at current sales rates.
[2:45:52.420 --> 2:45:53.980]  Vitamin mineral fusion is super popular.

[2:45:57.180 --> 2:45:58.620]  acids, and it tastes great.

[2:46:41.100 --> 2:46:45.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:46:45.100 --> 2:46:55.340]  Welcome back to Alex Jones Show.
[2:46:55.340 --> 2:46:58.900]  We've got Dr. Vladimir Zevkin-Lenko with us.
[2:46:58.900 --> 2:47:04.940]  His Pelosi in April of this year is saying, we cannot require someone to be vaccinated.
[2:47:04.940 --> 2:47:07.620]  That's just not what we do.
[2:47:07.620 --> 2:47:12.860]  Take down the math, but so far, that's not what we can do.
[2:47:12.860 --> 2:47:14.740]  So here's the thing.
[2:47:14.740 --> 2:47:18.620]  We cannot require someone to be vaccinated.
[2:47:18.620 --> 2:47:21.220]  That's just not what we can do.
[2:47:21.220 --> 2:47:24.900]  It is a matter of privacy to know who is or who isn't.
[2:47:24.900 --> 2:47:28.860]  I can't go to the capital physician and say, give me the names of people who aren't vaccinated.
[2:47:28.860 --> 2:47:34.660]  So I can go and encourage them or make it known to others to encourage them to be vaccinated.
[2:47:34.660 --> 2:47:36.980]  So we can't do that.
[2:47:36.980 --> 2:47:42.180]  And now they've exempted 600,000 postal workers from it.
[2:47:42.180 --> 2:47:47.260]  So sometimes Pelosi slips back into gear and is actually a human, but the people controlling
[2:47:47.260 --> 2:47:51.860]  her are creating the World ID, the World Social Credit Score through this system.
[2:47:51.860 --> 2:47:56.140]  Klaus Schwab has said this, he said it five years ago on French TV, Dr. Zevkin-Lenko brought
[2:47:56.140 --> 2:47:57.140]  that up.
[2:47:57.140 --> 2:48:00.420]  We're going to chip in, we're going to have a World ID, medical ID, we're going to use
[2:48:00.420 --> 2:48:02.540]  the fear of a virus to do this.
[2:48:02.540 --> 2:48:05.940]  And so, Doc, you've agreed to stay five minutes until next hour.
[2:48:05.940 --> 2:48:07.660]  I appreciate that Mike Adams is coming on.
[2:48:07.660 --> 2:48:10.100]  We're going to talk about solutions, ways to protect ourselves then.
[2:48:10.100 --> 2:48:15.340]  But now, other key points you'd like to add are, I mean, what do you make of this declaration
[2:48:15.340 --> 2:48:18.380]  by Biden that's so un-American, so dictatorial?
[2:48:18.380 --> 2:48:20.540]  And then, of course, I have a matter to show TV viewers.
[2:48:20.540 --> 2:48:24.060]  The majority of states, as you can see, governors have already come out and said they're going
[2:48:24.060 --> 2:48:25.060]  to block it.
[2:48:25.060 --> 2:48:29.260]  But they had to know it was unconstitutional, just like the CDC saying it controlled all
[2:48:29.260 --> 2:48:32.500]  rents in America and tried to federalize that.
[2:48:32.500 --> 2:48:36.420]  So it just seems like a zombie just attacking, like, give me power, give me power, give me
[2:48:36.420 --> 2:48:37.420]  power.
[2:48:37.420 --> 2:48:38.420]  What's your view on that?
[2:48:38.420 --> 2:48:44.780]  Well, all these tactics are, they are effective, it's going to motivate more and more people
[2:48:44.780 --> 2:48:47.300]  to get this poison depth shot.
[2:48:47.300 --> 2:48:52.780]  And you know, I personally, my philosophy is like this, I believe everyone has the right
[2:48:52.780 --> 2:48:57.460]  to be exposed to all their information about something and let them choose whatever they
[2:48:57.460 --> 2:48:58.460]  want to do.
[2:48:58.460 --> 2:49:01.900]  If you know, you hear what I'm saying, let's say, and you still feel like you should take
[2:49:01.900 --> 2:49:04.780]  a vaccine, fine, that's your choice.
[2:49:04.780 --> 2:49:15.140]  But the coercion, the forcing and psychological pressure of the government on innocent people
[2:49:15.140 --> 2:49:17.460]  is a violation of the Geneva Convention.
[2:49:17.460 --> 2:49:23.940]  The Geneva Convention does not allow for human experimentation without the informed consent
[2:49:23.940 --> 2:49:26.260]  of the patient.
[2:49:26.260 --> 2:49:28.500]  And this is not being done.
[2:49:28.500 --> 2:49:33.140]  There's a tremendous amount of suppression of the side effects of these terrible vaccines.
[2:49:33.140 --> 2:49:37.540]  And there's a lot of suppression about how efficacious they are.
[2:49:37.540 --> 2:49:47.620]  And what our CDC director analyzed the Israeli data and said that based on the Israeli data,
[2:49:47.620 --> 2:49:54.620]  anyone who got vaccinated early is much more likely to end up in the ICU.
[2:49:54.620 --> 2:49:56.620]  Therefore you should take another shot.
[2:49:56.620 --> 2:50:03.140]  I'm just listening to you and trying to grab a graph here I have.
[2:50:03.140 --> 2:50:07.740]  We have all these graphs from Israel and it's not just Israel, Singapore, the U.K., the
[2:50:07.740 --> 2:50:12.020]  U.S., it shows way more hospitalizations, deaths, and illnesses than Sweden who's not
[2:50:12.020 --> 2:50:13.140]  doing a bunch of vaccines.
[2:50:13.140 --> 2:50:14.140]  Same thing, India.
[2:50:14.140 --> 2:50:19.020]  I mean, isn't this the proof here, doctor, and what does this mean these shots are doing
[2:50:19.020 --> 2:50:20.020]  to people?
[2:50:20.020 --> 2:50:23.340]  I guess you simplified it down, poison death shots.
[2:50:23.340 --> 2:50:26.700]  Yeah, it's really killing a lot of people.
[2:50:26.700 --> 2:50:33.060]  And according to Dr. Robert Malone, people that are vaccinated are experiencing much
[2:50:33.060 --> 2:50:35.780]  higher tidal levels than unvaccinated.
[2:50:35.780 --> 2:50:42.500]  So in other words, someone who's vaccinated can get much sicker, not milder, much sicker
[2:50:42.500 --> 2:50:47.100]  than the unvaccinated, simply because they reproduce more virus.
[2:50:47.100 --> 2:50:52.540]  And that was consistent with the Israeli data from the University of Tel Aviv that concluded
[2:50:52.540 --> 2:50:57.180]  that anyone who got the Pfizer vaccine is six times more likely to get the South African
[2:50:57.180 --> 2:50:59.820]  variant of COVID-19.
[2:50:59.820 --> 2:51:04.660]  So these vaccines were never meant to be vaccines.
[2:51:04.660 --> 2:51:11.980]  They're tools of death to get rid of a certain percentage of us, to make another percentage
[2:51:11.980 --> 2:51:20.620]  infertile, and then track to brilliant, evil, but it's brilliant, and then put it in an
[2:51:20.620 --> 2:51:24.740]  internal tracking device, internal easy pass, where you can't even remove it anymore, it's
[2:51:24.740 --> 2:51:27.540]  you're permanently bonded to it.
[2:51:27.540 --> 2:51:32.900]  And there's going to be a few people, look, 70% of the corporate wealth in the world is
[2:51:32.900 --> 2:51:35.900]  essentially owned by 150 people.
[2:51:35.900 --> 2:51:42.580]  And those 150 people control all the industries, media, politics, pharmaceuticals for sure,
[2:51:42.580 --> 2:51:44.740]  academia with their funding.
[2:51:44.740 --> 2:51:54.380]  So this is a very well-coordinated and extremely well-financed global takeover, and that's a
[2:51:54.380 --> 2:51:55.380]  conspiracy.
[2:51:55.380 --> 2:51:56.380]  It's just not a theory.
[2:51:56.380 --> 2:51:58.260]  We're living through it.
[2:51:58.260 --> 2:52:04.100]  And people who choose not to see it are, in my opinion, contributing to the problem,
[2:52:04.100 --> 2:52:07.140]  because your compliance emboldens the enemy.
[2:52:07.140 --> 2:52:13.340]  All evil needs is for good people to do nothing, rise up in a nonviolent way, violence is completely
[2:52:13.340 --> 2:52:18.820]  unnecessary here, by the way, you just rise up in mass, and what are they going to do?
[2:52:18.820 --> 2:52:19.820]  Fire all of us?
[2:52:19.820 --> 2:52:23.540]  Not let all of us go to school, not let all of us travel?
[2:52:23.540 --> 2:52:24.540]  Absolutely.
[2:52:24.540 --> 2:52:29.460]  They're trying to mark us all like cattle, not to control us, but to depopulate us in
[2:52:29.460 --> 2:52:31.380]  all of their admissions.
[2:52:31.380 --> 2:52:37.020]  I've had a lot of questions about this, Dr. Soap, please entertain my question on this.
[2:52:37.020 --> 2:52:43.340]  I've seen probably, no exaggeration, I've been sent hundreds of times this last week,
[2:52:43.340 --> 2:52:47.620]  I've seen it all over Facebook, Twitter, people send it to me, aha, Alex Jones has
[2:52:47.620 --> 2:52:51.940]  been sterilized, he took ivermectin, his dad took ivermectin, thank god I don't ever have
[2:52:51.940 --> 2:52:56.860]  any more children, I was prescribed it by a doctor, and then I went and spent hours
[2:52:56.860 --> 2:53:01.580]  the other night, I saw one study out of Nigeria that looked like they were just paid to put
[2:53:01.580 --> 2:53:04.860]  it out so people wouldn't take ivermectin and die, it looks like it was written years
[2:53:04.860 --> 2:53:10.900]  ago, we know it was written more than a decade ago, and so overhead shot, please guys, ivermectin
[2:53:10.900 --> 2:53:16.620]  causes sterilization, 85% of men's study finds, well, I actually went and read that study
[2:53:16.620 --> 2:53:24.380]  and then I found dozens of others in rats, in mice, in rams, in rabbits, and it did find
[2:53:24.380 --> 2:53:31.460]  a 5 to 10 to 15% reduction in sperm for about 60 to 90 days, but then no ill problems after
[2:53:31.460 --> 2:53:32.460]  that.
[2:53:32.460 --> 2:53:38.420]  Sir, what is your view on fertility and ivermectin, and how does it act then, I understand to
[2:53:38.420 --> 2:53:43.700]  put zinc into the cells, but how does it secondarily kill worms in you, I've had other medical
[2:53:43.700 --> 2:53:47.980]  doctors on saying it's anti-cancer, I mean what is the mechanism there and is there any
[2:53:47.980 --> 2:53:52.380]  truth to long term sterilization, because all the other studies say that's not the case
[2:53:52.380 --> 2:53:57.460]  that I could find, this one Nigerian study that basically looks like it was, you know,
[2:53:57.460 --> 2:54:01.500]  written as a joke, has no evidence, or am I wrong, does ivermectin attack fertility
[2:54:01.500 --> 2:54:02.500]  long term?
[2:54:02.500 --> 2:54:07.660]  No, you're not wrong, and I know Nigeria is known for its academic research in medicine,
[2:54:07.660 --> 2:54:16.080]  but this was in 2011, and it was specific with a certain type of parasite that causes
[2:54:16.080 --> 2:54:22.780]  river blindness, but if you look into what else this parasite does, it destroys the scrotum
[2:54:22.780 --> 2:54:28.060]  of men, so let me ask you a question, don't you think it's possible that the actual parasitic
[2:54:28.060 --> 2:54:32.180]  infection, which is eating up the scrotum of men, may affect the sperm count?
[2:54:32.180 --> 2:54:33.180]  Absolutely.
[2:54:33.180 --> 2:54:38.980]  So, if that's the, listen, if that mystic globalist, that's the best he can do, drum
[2:54:38.980 --> 2:54:46.300]  up a Nigerian study from 10 years ago as the biggest proof that ivermectin is bad, you're
[2:54:46.300 --> 2:54:48.020]  in pretty bad shape, I have to tell you.
[2:54:48.020 --> 2:54:52.700]  Is there a truth to the study in rabbits and rams, that it does cause a short term, and
[2:54:52.700 --> 2:54:58.260]  then if so, what is the mechanism that stops all sorts of things from growing?
[2:54:58.260 --> 2:55:03.140]  So I don't know, I haven't seen those studies, so I'm sorry, I don't even know how to comment,
[2:55:03.140 --> 2:55:09.100]  but I can tell you that ivermectin has been used four billion times, and I think there's
[2:55:09.100 --> 2:55:14.740]  only six reported deaths, and also there are studies, by the way, which show that it actually
[2:55:14.740 --> 2:55:21.940]  preserved pregnancies in women infected, so there's a lot of confusing data, but everything
[2:55:21.940 --> 2:55:25.980]  in life is a risk versus benefit analysis, you know, driving a car could also reduce
[2:55:25.980 --> 2:55:32.860]  your sperm count if you crash and die, so do we not drive a car because of it, we make
[2:55:32.860 --> 2:55:39.860]  a risk versus benefit analysis, now, if you look in the high risk group, now who do I
[2:55:39.860 --> 2:55:44.940]  treat, by the way, ivermectin, it's patients in the high risk group, who are usually over
[2:55:44.940 --> 2:55:49.340]  the age of 45, or have chronic medical problems, most likely these people are not having babies
[2:55:49.340 --> 2:55:50.340]  anyway.
[2:55:50.340 --> 2:55:54.580]  Sure, but let's expand on that, COVID-19 attacks the testicles according to these studies,
[2:55:54.580 --> 2:55:58.100]  so I mean, it's just ridiculous, obviously, that's what I'm saying, I read like 20 plus
[2:55:58.100 --> 2:56:02.780]  studies, found nothing in there, but a few saying maybe a little bit of reduction, and
[2:56:02.780 --> 2:56:07.100]  hey, if I get that, that's great compared to dying.
[2:56:07.100 --> 2:56:12.660]  Listen, I probably have more respect for the mangerian medical system than, say, Lancet
[2:56:12.660 --> 2:56:19.940]  from now, but I don't know how well run this study was, and it's only one study from ten
[2:56:19.940 --> 2:56:20.940]  years ago.
[2:56:20.940 --> 2:56:23.060]  No, no, I totally understand what you're saying, sir, and it won the Nobel Prize, we don't
[2:56:23.060 --> 2:56:27.100]  see any evidence of that, and all I know is my dad was almost dead, and a day later on
[2:56:27.100 --> 2:56:31.100]  it, he was doing 90% better, I mean, that's all I had to see, doctor.
[2:56:31.100 --> 2:56:36.420]  Yeah, that's pretty dramatic, and that's what I initially noticed with hydroxychloroquine,
[2:56:36.420 --> 2:56:40.700]  subsequently, I started using all these drugs, because they all work, if you use them in the
[2:56:40.700 --> 2:56:46.420]  right timeframe with the right patient, and so it's an art, but the key, the fundamental
[2:56:46.420 --> 2:56:50.940]  principles is put out to fire before it takes the whole house down.
[2:56:50.940 --> 2:56:53.340]  So it's much easier to treat a small problem than a big problem.
[2:56:53.340 --> 2:56:57.300]  Which is what we see the hospitals directed by the technology turn people away.
[2:56:57.300 --> 2:57:02.100]  My security guys, good friend, a great lady in shape, a nurse, she went in sick, they said,
[2:57:02.100 --> 2:57:05.940]  nope, turned her back, two weeks later, comes back sick, innovators, she was dead, two days
[2:57:05.940 --> 2:57:06.940]  later.
[2:57:06.940 --> 2:57:13.380]  Final segment with Dr. Vladimir Zev Zelinko, amazing guy, ZStackLife.com, if you want to
[2:57:13.380 --> 2:57:17.980]  find his side in so much great material, we're going to come back with some final comments
[2:57:17.980 --> 2:57:22.380]  about how he recommends people as much as they can to boost their body's natural defenses
[2:57:22.380 --> 2:57:26.900]  period.
[2:57:26.900 --> 2:57:30.740]  Biden and his corporate controllers are lying to you.
[2:57:30.740 --> 2:57:33.180]  This is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[2:57:33.180 --> 2:57:40.500]  This is an engineered virus in a lab that they then injected into the public using their
[2:57:40.500 --> 2:57:47.500]  poison vaccine so the body then created mutations that actually spread even worse like the Delta
[2:57:47.500 --> 2:57:48.500]  variant.
[2:57:48.500 --> 2:57:53.780]  That is scientifically admitted, that is mainline science and not even debated, but the general
[2:57:53.780 --> 2:57:56.940]  public does not even know that.
[2:57:56.940 --> 2:58:04.220]  So when that criminal with his pedophile crackhead son gets up there on television and tells
[2:58:04.220 --> 2:58:10.460]  you that you are to blame because you didn't take their poison shot, that is a giant lie.
[2:58:10.460 --> 2:58:33.940]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class, not
[2:58:33.940 --> 2:58:40.340]  in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere, is there a real
[2:58:40.340 --> 2:58:43.140]  study of the planet's ruling class?
[2:58:43.140 --> 2:58:44.860]  That's done by design.
[2:58:44.860 --> 2:58:50.860]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[2:58:50.860 --> 2:58:55.740]  that look into say the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the Trilateral
[2:58:55.740 --> 2:59:00.860]  Commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[2:59:00.860 --> 2:59:05.540]  Until 10 years ago the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't
[2:59:05.540 --> 2:59:06.540]  exist.
[2:59:06.540 --> 2:59:10.380]  Well now the Bilderberg group is public and its former head, the show on the steering
[2:59:10.380 --> 2:59:16.100]  committee, is Klaus Schwab and he has set up the great reset in global government and
[2:59:16.100 --> 2:59:20.460]  if as a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the globalist head on, about the
[2:59:20.460 --> 2:59:24.340]  fact that they are a worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[2:59:24.340 --> 2:59:28.740]  We do expose them, we can beat them easily.
[2:59:28.740 --> 2:59:46.500]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:46.500 --> 2:59:47.500]  Welcome back folks.
[2:59:47.500 --> 2:59:53.300]  Final segment with Dr. Zev Zelenko here with us and I wanted to just close out here with
[2:59:53.300 --> 2:59:57.860]  the Israeli state, there's a bunch of others, 13 to 27 times better immunity from people
[2:59:57.860 --> 3:00:04.220]  that have had COVID or the Delta variant than people that have had the Pfizer shot.
[3:00:04.220 --> 3:00:08.060]  And then it just happened last night, we have the clip, I'm not going to even air it, everybody's
[3:00:08.060 --> 3:00:14.740]  probably seen it, Anderson Cooper, they have Fauci on there and they say, is natural immunity
[3:00:14.740 --> 3:00:15.740]  any good?
[3:00:15.740 --> 3:00:18.660]  He goes, I just don't know if it's even any good, that's the quote, I don't even know
[3:00:18.660 --> 3:00:23.620]  about natural immunity he says and I guess that's not a big a lie as the Surgeon General
[3:00:23.620 --> 3:00:29.700]  saying it's not as good, so this level of gaslighting doctor when 101 in biology, 101
[3:00:29.700 --> 3:00:33.820]  even for a medical student is, natural immunity is way better than a vaccine immunity and
[3:00:33.820 --> 3:00:34.820]  this is even a vaccine.
[3:00:34.820 --> 3:00:40.020]  So just briefly, what do you say to this level of gaslighting?
[3:00:40.020 --> 3:00:41.820]  You're a prostitute.
[3:00:41.820 --> 3:00:48.020]  You sold your soul out to whoever pays the most or whoever is threatening you or whatever
[3:00:48.020 --> 3:00:54.460]  it is, but you are spreading lies, everyone can see that, we can read, we interpret it,
[3:00:54.460 --> 3:01:04.940]  we sense it in your mannerisms, it was just one fountain of falsehood and you will pay
[3:01:04.940 --> 3:01:08.620]  the price, you will pay the price in this world and in the world to come.
[3:01:08.620 --> 3:01:14.660]  But I beg the people to spread the truth and not listen to these instruments of death.
[3:01:14.660 --> 3:01:18.660]  Because if you look at that age, that age says don't treat COVID until you're in the hospital
[3:01:18.660 --> 3:01:24.420]  with an oxygen level less than 92, that's a government that wants you to die.
[3:01:24.420 --> 3:01:27.940]  Now doctor, last time you were on you didn't mention this, but I did more research and
[3:01:27.940 --> 3:01:32.780]  I know that you have a very, very popular natural supplement compound that is obviously
[3:01:32.780 --> 3:01:36.380]  really essential and really great for people and you have an affiliate program and your
[3:01:36.380 --> 3:01:40.220]  folks were gracious enough to say, hey, last time we came on, we had a really great response
[3:01:40.220 --> 3:01:43.900]  and that's wonderful because I want to get this, I'm sure a lot of the people want to
[3:01:43.900 --> 3:01:48.260]  get this because it's really, really important, particularly in this day and age.
[3:01:48.260 --> 3:01:53.380]  So ZStacklife.com forward slash Alex and it's an affiliate program, he helps support our
[3:01:53.380 --> 3:01:58.700]  broadcast and get an amazing product, spend a few minutes telling us about this product
[3:01:58.700 --> 3:02:02.100]  and what's in it and how it came about, doctor.
[3:02:02.100 --> 3:02:09.740]  The ghoul ex-governor of New York, Cuomo, in April of last year issued an executive order
[3:02:09.740 --> 3:02:14.460]  that blocked access, pharmacies could not dispense hydroxychloroquine.
[3:02:14.460 --> 3:02:19.340]  So and that was an order directly against my practice and my patients because no one
[3:02:19.340 --> 3:02:20.860]  else was doing it.
[3:02:20.860 --> 3:02:23.220]  And so I needed to innovate.
[3:02:23.220 --> 3:02:29.020]  So I looked on the NIH servers, believe it or not, and I found something called Corsitin
[3:02:29.020 --> 3:02:32.100]  that together with vitamin C gets zinc into the cell.
[3:02:32.100 --> 3:02:37.100]  To be honest, I didn't know what Corsitin was, so I googled it and I see it's over the counter.
[3:02:37.100 --> 3:02:41.140]  I said, oh my God, I just found the cure to tyranny because of the two risk factors to
[3:02:41.140 --> 3:02:45.300]  die from COVID is your moronic doctor and the tyrannical government because the doctor
[3:02:45.300 --> 3:02:49.260]  delays treatment and government blocks access to life-saving medicines.
[3:02:49.260 --> 3:02:56.020]  So now I could say, Alex, go to the vitamin shop, buy Corsitin, vitamin C, zinc, and vitamin
[3:02:56.020 --> 3:02:59.700]  D is probably the most important vitamin for your immune system.
[3:02:59.700 --> 3:03:04.540]  It's not a COVID thing, but you want to make sure that your vitamin D levels, D3 are between
[3:03:04.540 --> 3:03:09.100]  15, 70, that it essentially shuts down any ICU admissions.
[3:03:09.100 --> 3:03:13.140]  All the data is showing that people with high levels of vitamin D, normal, high normal,
[3:03:13.140 --> 3:03:15.740]  do not end up in the stick in the ICU.
[3:03:15.740 --> 3:03:16.740]  So it just makes sense.
[3:03:16.740 --> 3:03:20.620]  So I open sourced all this information and people came back to me and they said, listen,
[3:03:20.620 --> 3:03:22.740]  we're having trouble putting the puzzle together.
[3:03:22.740 --> 3:03:25.340]  We can't find it all in one place or whatever.
[3:03:25.340 --> 3:03:27.420]  Can I put it all in one bottle?
[3:03:27.420 --> 3:03:28.780]  So that's what I did.
[3:03:28.780 --> 3:03:34.580]  I combined it in the right dosing that I feel is correct.
[3:03:34.580 --> 3:03:40.300]  And Corsitin, look, it's all that the, let's me say, is that this is a nutritional supplement
[3:03:40.300 --> 3:03:45.380]  and an immune booster, which is true, and I can just tell you the ingredients.
[3:03:45.380 --> 3:03:51.580]  Again, zinc stops RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from making, from viruses making RNA copies
[3:03:51.580 --> 3:03:54.140]  of its genetic material.
[3:03:54.140 --> 3:03:59.140]  Corsitin gets into the cell with the Corsitin and vitamin C and D is like a bulletproof
[3:03:59.140 --> 3:04:01.620]  vest that it up regulates your immune system.
[3:04:01.620 --> 3:04:03.180]  So it works much more efficiently.
[3:04:03.180 --> 3:04:07.020]  But that was the idea and the response has been great.
[3:04:07.020 --> 3:04:09.340]  People, but it's not for high risk patients.
[3:04:09.340 --> 3:04:13.140]  It's really for low to moderate risk patients.
[3:04:13.140 --> 3:04:19.660]  I do prefer adroxychloroquine and ivermectin for the higher risk patients because those
[3:04:19.660 --> 3:04:20.660]  are the best weapons.
[3:04:20.660 --> 3:04:24.620]  Sure, but you're saying as a supplement of natural things, it's a good booster for your
[3:04:24.620 --> 3:04:25.620]  immune system.
[3:04:25.620 --> 3:04:30.380]  You can find it all, ladies and gentlemen, at ZStackLife.com forward slash Alex if you'd
[3:04:30.380 --> 3:04:34.620]  like to sponsor us and support us because he's doing that to help fund the operation.
[3:04:34.620 --> 3:04:35.620]  Thank you, doctor.
[3:04:35.620 --> 3:04:40.020]  Just a week ago, we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion back in stock and
[3:04:40.020 --> 3:04:42.780]  it was only half of the order we wanted to get.
[3:04:42.780 --> 3:04:47.300]  But because we won't cut corners on the quality of what goes into it, the factory can only
[3:04:47.300 --> 3:04:48.300]  get limited supply.
[3:04:48.300 --> 3:04:50.580]  So again, it was half the order we wanted.
[3:04:50.580 --> 3:04:53.940]  But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33% off.
[3:04:53.940 --> 3:04:56.020]  So everybody on the fence will get it.
[3:04:56.020 --> 3:04:59.500]  It's critical for your immune system and your whole body, all the essential vitamins, all
[3:04:59.500 --> 3:05:03.540]  the essential minerals and a bunch of key amino acids and infowarstore.com.
[3:05:03.540 --> 3:05:08.900]  So while supplies last until it runs out, we're selling it for 33% off and it'll be
[3:05:08.900 --> 3:05:10.780]  months till more comes in.

[3:05:19.020 --> 3:05:23.700]  But we have another great product, hair and beard formula, that's really a great multivitamin
[3:05:23.700 --> 3:05:27.420]  mineral system that's one of the best multivitamin mineral systems out there.
[3:05:27.420 --> 3:05:29.420]  It's just called hair and beard.
[3:05:29.420 --> 3:05:31.220]  So get that as well for your immune system.
[3:05:31.220 --> 3:05:45.500]  It's great for women, great for children, but it's designed for men in infowarstore.com.
[3:05:45.500 --> 3:05:53.860]  On Thursday, September 9th, yesterday, Huppet Joe Biden declared war on America and announced
[3:05:53.860 --> 3:06:05.820]  dictatorial powers of the federal government not seen in U.S. history.
[3:06:05.820 --> 3:06:12.860]  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated and it's caused by the fact that despite America
[3:06:12.860 --> 3:06:18.780]  having unprecedented and successful vaccination program, despite the fact that for almost
[3:06:18.780 --> 3:06:24.700]  five months, free vaccines have been available in 80,000 different locations.
[3:06:24.700 --> 3:06:26.100]  All of this is lies.
[3:06:26.100 --> 3:06:30.020]  We still have nearly 80 million Americans who have failed to get the shot.
[3:06:30.020 --> 3:06:31.020]  The shots cause the mutation.
[3:06:31.020 --> 3:06:33.660]  This is not about freedom or personal choice.
[3:06:33.660 --> 3:06:34.660]  It's about turning.
[3:06:34.660 --> 3:06:37.260]  It's about protecting yourself and those around you.
[3:06:37.260 --> 3:06:38.260]  It's about the new world order.
[3:06:38.260 --> 3:06:44.100]  The people you work with, the people you care about, the people you love.
[3:06:44.100 --> 3:06:47.900]  My job as president is to protect all Americans.
[3:06:47.900 --> 3:06:53.940]  I'm announcing that the Department of Labor is developing an emergency rule to require
[3:06:53.940 --> 3:07:02.180]  all employers with 100 or more employees that together employ over 80 million workers to
[3:07:02.180 --> 3:07:11.020]  ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a week.
[3:07:11.020 --> 3:07:19.860]  We've been patient, but our patience is wearing thin and your refusal has cost all of us.
[3:07:19.860 --> 3:07:24.260]  Well, we told you it was coming, medical tyranny.
[3:07:24.260 --> 3:07:25.780]  Everything you see overseas is coming here.
[3:07:25.780 --> 3:07:27.300]  It's from other same people.
[3:07:27.300 --> 3:07:30.260]  And I couldn't get a more informative guest on than Mike Adams.
[3:07:30.260 --> 3:07:35.100]  We talked quite a bit yesterday, and we're, Symponico again, forces with us as they would
[3:07:35.100 --> 3:07:40.060]  say is, how does the link I was saying, we are on board with pro-human movement.
[3:07:40.060 --> 3:07:41.540]  And I see this as an opportunity.
[3:07:41.540 --> 3:07:46.700]  I see this as God throwing us all in the deep end, evil and good and saying, okay, it's
[3:07:46.700 --> 3:07:49.460]  time for folks to really make the decision about which direction they want this planet
[3:07:49.460 --> 3:07:50.460]  to go.
[3:07:50.460 --> 3:07:53.540]  You're seeing Mark and the Beast rolled out.
[3:07:53.540 --> 3:07:56.740]  And it doesn't mean it's a foregone conclusion because we can get 100 years in reprieve like
[3:07:56.740 --> 3:08:01.500]  Nineveh, but we know in the end, this evil will build up so big and defeat us.
[3:08:01.500 --> 3:08:05.140]  We're about to decide if that's going to happen now or 20 years or 100 years in the future.
[3:08:05.140 --> 3:08:07.620]  But again, it's up to us to choose our own adventure.
[3:08:07.620 --> 3:08:11.300]  The bigger question Mike Adams is going to bring forward after he responds to Biden and
[3:08:11.300 --> 3:08:16.300]  the illegality of this and the martial law, he sent me a text last night that was so on.
[3:08:16.300 --> 3:08:20.860]  I use that as the description of the video I shot last night with the headline Biden
[3:08:20.860 --> 3:08:22.100]  declares war on America.
[3:08:22.100 --> 3:08:26.940]  What was crazy is I was over there shooting at 7 at night, didn't go out until like midnight.
[3:08:26.940 --> 3:08:31.060]  I didn't watch Fox News last night and I learned separately Fox News was even calling it war
[3:08:31.060 --> 3:08:34.740]  on America and federal government declares dictatorial powers.
[3:08:34.740 --> 3:08:37.340]  I mean, even Fox News gets it now.
[3:08:37.340 --> 3:08:39.940]  This is so brazen.
[3:08:39.940 --> 3:08:43.860]  Even a lot of Democrats are like, whoa, I mean, wait a minute.
[3:08:43.860 --> 3:08:45.300]  So this is quite a time to be alive.
[3:08:45.300 --> 3:08:50.660]  But the big question we're going to answer here today is why are they acting like a
[3:08:50.660 --> 3:08:51.940]  gun to their head?
[3:08:51.940 --> 3:08:55.660]  Why are they acting like they're all going to walk the plank if they don't?
[3:08:55.660 --> 3:08:59.540]  Do they know a giant extinction event is coming and they know if there's seven and a half
[3:08:59.540 --> 3:09:04.300]  million people will chew into their underground bunkers, will, will, will, you know, take
[3:09:04.300 --> 3:09:08.380]  over these underground bases, they admittedly have built everywhere and they're all staying
[3:09:08.380 --> 3:09:12.100]  in scared to death before COVID ever showed up.
[3:09:12.100 --> 3:09:13.100]  So what's happening?
[3:09:13.100 --> 3:09:14.100]  Have aliens shown up?
[3:09:14.100 --> 3:09:15.100]  So we're going to blow the planet up.
[3:09:15.100 --> 3:09:20.300]  If you don't do this or what's happening, I'm not saying that literally, I'm trying
[3:09:20.300 --> 3:09:24.180]  to war game out folks, the rest of the story, we already told you what was coming off their
[3:09:24.180 --> 3:09:25.180]  documents.
[3:09:25.180 --> 3:09:26.180]  We already laid all that out.
[3:09:26.180 --> 3:09:29.020]  There's no reason to talk about what currently is here now.
[3:09:29.020 --> 3:09:32.900]  We need to war game what they're really doing, what they're going to do next from their own
[3:09:32.900 --> 3:09:36.620]  documents, but also what's driving them, not just power, not just control.
[3:09:36.620 --> 3:09:37.620]  They look scared.
[3:09:37.620 --> 3:09:40.140]  I guess it's their master, the serpent.
[3:09:40.140 --> 3:09:42.460]  So Mike Adams, naturalnews.com.
[3:09:42.460 --> 3:09:43.900]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[3:09:43.900 --> 3:09:45.660]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[3:09:45.660 --> 3:09:50.140]  I'm smiling today because I want to thank Joe Biden for perfectly following the script.
[3:09:50.140 --> 3:09:56.020]  And so he has now solidified resistance against the vaccine mandates and resistance against
[3:09:56.020 --> 3:09:57.980]  his authoritarian regime.
[3:09:57.980 --> 3:10:04.100]  He basically just said that he's going to essentially remove the governors and remove
[3:10:04.100 --> 3:10:10.900]  states rights and attempt to rule as a kind of medical Adolf Hitler over America, and
[3:10:10.900 --> 3:10:17.900]  that you don't own your body, that he as the dictator can determine anything to be injected
[3:10:17.900 --> 3:10:22.580]  into you, whether or not it's approved, whether or not it's safe, he can inject you with radiological
[3:10:22.580 --> 3:10:25.580]  material and you have no choice according to him.
[3:10:25.580 --> 3:10:30.460]  Of course, the pushback against the red states, the governors, the attorneys general, the
[3:10:30.460 --> 3:10:35.460]  people, and even conservative media is exactly what we were hoping to see.
[3:10:35.460 --> 3:10:37.100]  Alex, I'm ecstatic.
[3:10:37.100 --> 3:10:41.340]  I almost couldn't stop smiling last night after this because the pushback is even greater
[3:10:41.340 --> 3:10:43.400]  than what I had anticipated.
[3:10:43.400 --> 3:10:45.020]  Look at what Governor Abbott did.
[3:10:45.020 --> 3:10:49.340]  Look at what's happening in Missouri and all the red states are pushing back so aggressively
[3:10:49.340 --> 3:10:51.580]  against this and saying, no, guess what?
[3:10:51.580 --> 3:10:52.580]  We're not going to comply.
[3:10:52.580 --> 3:10:58.380]  And even conservative media like the Daily Caller put out a video and said, no, we're
[3:10:58.380 --> 3:10:59.380]  not going to comply.
[3:10:59.380 --> 3:11:03.140]  I mean, even Breitbart is so strong against us.
[3:11:03.140 --> 3:11:07.460]  And like you said, Fox News, which has been pro vaccine, pro vaccine, pro vaccine.
[3:11:07.460 --> 3:11:08.700]  Well, guess what?
[3:11:08.700 --> 3:11:09.900]  Even they've reached their limit.
[3:11:09.900 --> 3:11:12.820]  So the backlash is something to celebrate, Alex.
[3:11:12.820 --> 3:11:13.820]  I totally agree.
[3:11:13.820 --> 3:11:16.220]  So let's, that goes back to what we talked about last night.
[3:11:16.220 --> 3:11:21.060]  Why are they carrying out a course that will destroy them like a gun is to their head?
[3:11:21.060 --> 3:11:22.060]  Because they already run the planet.
[3:11:22.060 --> 3:11:23.220]  They already control it.
[3:11:23.220 --> 3:11:25.740]  125 families have 90 percent of the wealth.
[3:11:25.740 --> 3:11:27.940]  What the hell are they doing?
[3:11:27.940 --> 3:11:31.180]  Well, there are several interesting theories on this.
[3:11:31.180 --> 3:11:35.420]  And it's clear, as you and I talked about on the phone, it's clear that there's something
[3:11:35.420 --> 3:11:40.820]  bigger that is arriving or coming that the globalist fear and they feel like they must
[3:11:40.820 --> 3:11:45.700]  exterminate billions of human beings before this other thing becomes obvious.
[3:11:45.700 --> 3:11:49.180]  Maybe we're about to achieve a higher level of consciousness, quite frankly, already feeling.
[3:11:49.180 --> 3:11:50.700]  Maybe that's what's arriving.
[3:11:50.700 --> 3:11:53.420]  Yeah, yeah, maybe so.
[3:11:53.420 --> 3:11:57.020]  But the categories of what could be happening in folks are just with the disclaimer.
[3:11:57.020 --> 3:11:58.020]  These are thought experiments.
[3:11:58.020 --> 3:12:01.620]  I don't have any direct evidence that any of these things are about to happen.
[3:12:01.620 --> 3:12:05.780]  But there are things that could happen on earth, such as, for example, if Yellowstone
[3:12:05.780 --> 3:12:10.820]  Blue, the supervolcano, and it would deposit particulate matter into the atmosphere and
[3:12:10.820 --> 3:12:14.300]  it would block the food supply for two or three years, let's say, right?
[3:12:14.300 --> 3:12:15.700]  Crop failure worldwide.
[3:12:15.700 --> 3:12:23.300]  Or some other natural geological event, massive volcanoes, earth changes, pole shifts, these
[3:12:23.300 --> 3:12:24.300]  kinds of things.
[3:12:24.300 --> 3:12:26.700]  So those are earth-based scenarios.
[3:12:26.700 --> 3:12:31.120]  Clearly the globalists would not want very many humans to be alive before they become
[3:12:31.120 --> 3:12:35.540]  aware of this event because society would collapse immediately and then they would have
[3:12:35.540 --> 3:12:40.740]  all of the people that they call useless eaters then competing for the resources that the
[3:12:40.740 --> 3:12:43.300]  globalists want for themselves so they can survive.
[3:12:43.300 --> 3:12:46.220]  They don't care about your survival, but they want to survive.
[3:12:46.220 --> 3:12:52.820]  But then there are exopolitical types of events beyond earth, extraterrestrial scenarios
[3:12:52.820 --> 3:12:58.220]  or demonic scenarios, supernatural types of scenarios.
[3:12:58.220 --> 3:13:03.260]  And I want to mention something that just struck me yesterday about this.
[3:13:03.260 --> 3:13:08.100]  Forming of earth is now underway, Alex, and your producers can pull this up.
[3:13:08.100 --> 3:13:09.260]  Here's what you search for.
[3:13:09.260 --> 3:13:10.940]  It's from the Daily Mail.
[3:13:10.940 --> 3:13:15.460]  World's biggest carbon-sucking machine is switched on in Iceland.
[3:13:15.460 --> 3:13:21.900]  A $15 million device will capture 4,000 tons of CO2 per year and could help reverse climate
[3:13:21.900 --> 3:13:22.900]  change, they say.
[3:13:22.900 --> 3:13:27.180]  Well, that's not a climate change machine, that's a terraforming machine.
[3:13:27.180 --> 3:13:32.020]  So terraforming of planet earth has begun, and if you take the CO2 out of the atmosphere,
[3:13:32.020 --> 3:13:34.700]  you collapse the food crops, of course.
[3:13:34.700 --> 3:13:39.820]  You cause plagues, mass starvation, famine, the collapse of human civilization.
[3:13:39.820 --> 3:13:44.660]  But you also make the planet colder, which is more like a planet that's further from
[3:13:44.660 --> 3:13:46.620]  its own sun.
[3:13:46.620 --> 3:13:51.300]  So combined with the biological weapons that have been designed to attack human tissue,
[3:13:51.300 --> 3:13:57.580]  it's very clear to me, Alex, that there is a war against the humanity on planet earth,
[3:13:57.580 --> 3:14:05.020]  not just to exterminate humanity and prepare the planet for a post-human future, but also
[3:14:05.020 --> 3:14:09.540]  to terraform the atmosphere and alter it so that humans cannot survive.
[3:14:09.540 --> 3:14:13.900]  And by the way, all these big globalists say, we're going to merge the machines, humans
[3:14:13.900 --> 3:14:14.900]  are traveling at riddles.
[3:14:14.900 --> 3:14:19.460]  It's like they've been told in a transmission, like, we are arriving at this time, kill off
[3:14:19.460 --> 3:14:24.780]  the rest of them, we will let you merge with us, if not you will be destroyed, lower carbon,
[3:14:24.780 --> 3:14:25.780]  we do not like your atmosphere.
[3:14:25.780 --> 3:14:29.460]  I mean, it sounds like they act like they're aliens, the elites act like they're damn
[3:14:29.460 --> 3:14:30.460]  aliens.
[3:14:30.460 --> 3:14:34.980]  Well, yeah, they do, and according to, you know, some people out there, some experts
[3:14:34.980 --> 3:14:38.300]  that I've interviewed, they may actually not all be human.
[3:14:38.300 --> 3:14:39.300]  I mean, who knows?
[3:14:39.300 --> 3:14:42.180]  I don't know what the situation is with that, but I do know that...
[3:14:42.180 --> 3:14:46.660]  Well, they sure as hell don't act like humans, they act like a bunch of psychotic demons.
[3:14:46.660 --> 3:14:49.900]  Well, and they celebrate the mass murder of humans.
[3:14:49.900 --> 3:14:54.060]  And there's also the demonic possession element of this, it is very real with the Satanic
[3:14:54.060 --> 3:14:58.900]  Temple announcing that abortion is their religious cult ritual.
[3:14:58.900 --> 3:15:02.860]  And that's why they're suing Texas to stop the heartbeat law, because they say that they
[3:15:02.860 --> 3:15:05.420]  have to kill babies, it's part of their religion.
[3:15:05.420 --> 3:15:08.780]  And then the Democrats said, that sounds great, let's go with them.
[3:15:08.780 --> 3:15:09.780]  So...
[3:15:09.780 --> 3:15:12.740]  That's what the Democrats say, they're our savior, they're our only hope.
[3:15:12.740 --> 3:15:14.660]  Help me Satanist, you're my only hope.
[3:15:14.660 --> 3:15:17.540]  All right, we'll be right back with Mike Adams at Religious.com.
[3:15:17.540 --> 3:15:22.300]  He is knocking it out of the park, because hey, we're vindicated, what a weird feeling.
[3:15:22.300 --> 3:15:27.500]  Man, I'll tell you, this is crazy, we'll be right back, we'll talk about more of these

[3:16:07.500 --> 3:16:08.500]  Me too.
[3:16:08.500 --> 3:16:12.620]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[3:16:12.620 --> 3:16:15.380]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:15.380 --> 3:16:19.740]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[3:16:19.740 --> 3:16:21.460]  You probably already believe that.
[3:16:21.460 --> 3:16:22.660]  I certainly do.
[3:16:22.660 --> 3:16:23.660]  So here's the thing.
[3:16:23.660 --> 3:16:28.020]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[3:16:28.020 --> 3:16:32.100]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[3:16:32.100 --> 3:16:37.900]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[3:17:02.260 --> 3:17:04.380]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:17:04.380 --> 3:17:08.300]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:08.300 --> 3:17:09.820]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:17:09.820 --> 3:17:12.820]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:12.820 --> 3:17:16.060]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:17:16.060 --> 3:17:18.300]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[3:18:34.980 --> 3:18:41.140]  The puppet leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their allegiance to the new
[3:18:41.140 --> 3:18:46.420]  world order, and Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well.
[3:18:46.420 --> 3:18:52.220]  That means allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government established by the Rockefellers
[3:18:52.220 --> 3:18:56.540]  through the UN, and they want inside your bodies to put in you what they want, when
[3:18:56.540 --> 3:19:02.860]  they want, and to have the global digital tracking COVID passes or vaccine passes to
[3:19:02.860 --> 3:19:06.220]  form the backbone of their new world ID.
[3:19:06.220 --> 3:19:11.020]  And now their puppet bite has announced the forced inoculation of 100 million Americans
[3:19:11.020 --> 3:19:15.220]  to keep their jobs in total violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[3:19:15.220 --> 3:19:19.540]  This is criminal, and he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine when they did not approve
[3:19:19.540 --> 3:19:20.540]  it.
[3:19:20.540 --> 3:19:22.140]  They say that's a 20, 25, maybe.
[3:19:22.140 --> 3:19:24.140]  They just expanded the emergency authorization.
[3:19:24.140 --> 3:19:27.540]  That's why the two top scientists quit a week and a half ago.
[3:19:27.540 --> 3:19:31.100]  Well, you live to see an absolute new world order world government.
[3:19:31.100 --> 3:19:37.260]  If you submit, they will totally enslave you.
[3:19:37.260 --> 3:19:44.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:19:44.620 --> 3:19:57.180]  All right, folks, and we are back live.
[3:19:57.180 --> 3:20:03.620]  Thank you so much for joining us here on this live Friday transmission.
[3:20:03.620 --> 3:20:08.580]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, naturalnews.com, is with us, and he was just going into this
[3:20:08.580 --> 3:20:14.620]  cult-like commitment of the globalist lockstep, as the Rockefeller documents said, from Australia
[3:20:14.620 --> 3:20:20.140]  to the United States, all the Western countries, to make us take these shots that make us sick,
[3:20:20.140 --> 3:20:25.100]  that make us die, that make us create these deadly mutants, even though it's destroying
[3:20:25.100 --> 3:20:30.740]  their system, they are doing it like it's a war, because it is a war, and the Rockefellers
[3:20:30.740 --> 3:20:36.620]  were behind so much of this, and they created the UN, and so here we are, what a time to
[3:20:36.620 --> 3:20:37.620]  be alive.
[3:20:37.620 --> 3:20:39.500]  Mike Adams, please continue where you left off.
[3:20:39.500 --> 3:20:40.500]  Well, you're right.
[3:20:40.500 --> 3:20:45.140]  This is a war against humanity, but also a war against the United States, and just like
[3:20:45.140 --> 3:20:53.100]  in most wars, the very entities carrying out this war try to pose as your saviors.
[3:20:53.100 --> 3:20:58.580]  I'd like to bring up the science fiction movie Oblivion, starring Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman,
[3:20:58.580 --> 3:21:03.540]  because I think it's a very good model of what we're experiencing, and in that movie,
[3:21:03.540 --> 3:21:08.660]  humanity was attacked and nearly wiped out by aliens, again, it's science fiction, but
[3:21:08.660 --> 3:21:12.660]  there's a metaphor in here that makes sense, and those aliens were then, they had giant
[3:21:12.660 --> 3:21:17.820]  ocean water sucking machines, stealing the water, taking the resources away from Earth,
[3:21:17.820 --> 3:21:24.180]  but they had convinced the remaining survivors, who were actually clones, that they were defending
[3:21:24.180 --> 3:21:29.820]  Earth, and they were relocating humanity to save humans, but it was all a giant alien
[3:21:29.820 --> 3:21:35.380]  false flag, and they were actually being completely deceived, and the planet was being destroyed
[3:21:35.380 --> 3:21:41.420]  and looted by the enemy forces that had launched the war, so what does that have to do with
[3:21:41.420 --> 3:21:42.420]  today?
[3:21:42.420 --> 3:21:46.300]  Well, you've got the globalists who are looting our planet, the resources, the money, the
[3:21:46.300 --> 3:21:51.740]  productivity of the workers through their fake currency, fiat currency printing machines,
[3:21:51.740 --> 3:21:56.700]  they are waging war on humanity with the biological weapons, while they claim to be the saviors
[3:21:56.700 --> 3:22:01.900]  that are saving us with vaccines, which are actually spreading the pandemic, so it's
[3:22:01.900 --> 3:22:06.540]  actually perfect, except it doesn't, it doesn't even require aliens to do this, Biden and
[3:22:06.540 --> 3:22:12.540]  the globalists are doing it, so we're actually living out a science fiction dystopian apocalypse
[3:22:12.540 --> 3:22:18.660]  right now, fortunately, governors and the conservatives are saying no, and we're pushing
[3:22:18.660 --> 3:22:25.700]  back hard, and that is the answer here, Alex, is global, taking away your consent, just say
[3:22:25.700 --> 3:22:31.420]  no, no, do not comply, we need mass civil disobedience in a peaceful manner in order
[3:22:31.420 --> 3:22:35.340]  to peacefully rise up and say no to this, and that's exactly where this is headed.
[3:22:35.340 --> 3:22:39.260]  And by the way, I totally agree with you that oblivion is really the system telling you
[3:22:39.260 --> 3:22:44.020]  what's going on, but again, the globalists say they're going to become the machines,
[3:22:44.020 --> 3:22:48.340]  take earth resources and blast off, when you read Ray Kurzweil or all these other top
[3:22:48.340 --> 3:22:53.020]  Google advisors, they write this in the white papers, I've read them on air, I don't believe
[3:22:53.020 --> 3:22:56.860]  in God yet, I'm going to become God, we're just going to use the resources and blast
[3:22:56.860 --> 3:23:02.140]  off and build universes, and it's all just delusional craziness, or are they inter-dimensionally
[3:23:02.140 --> 3:23:07.580]  being possessed by a trans-dimensional transmission, which is what they actually believe they're
[3:23:07.580 --> 3:23:11.700]  getting, it's my royalty, inter-breeds, not just to keep power, but to keep bloodlines
[3:23:11.700 --> 3:23:15.180]  that help them align with this, that's really what the occultists believe.
[3:23:15.180 --> 3:23:19.980]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely, of course, David, I can speak to that with a lot more detail,
[3:23:19.980 --> 3:23:24.940]  but I do want to mention that in that movie, Oblivion, the Tom Cruise character, essentially
[3:23:24.940 --> 3:23:29.300]  throughout the entire movie, he is getting red-pilled, he's getting red-pilled, and he's
[3:23:29.300 --> 3:23:34.180]  coming to understand the truth behind the lie, and this is what is happening now in
[3:23:34.180 --> 3:23:39.860]  record numbers across America, thanks to Joe Biden, who is perfectly playing out his scripted
[3:23:39.860 --> 3:23:45.020]  role, by the way, America's getting red-pilled, people are waking up like never before, the
[3:23:45.020 --> 3:23:51.860]  resistance against vaccine tyranny, and against the pharma vaccine fascist police state that
[3:23:51.860 --> 3:23:57.060]  has emerged, the resistance is now stronger than ever, because the American people, internally
[3:23:57.060 --> 3:24:02.540]  they've already made the decision, we're not going to go down the road of Australia, we're
[3:24:02.540 --> 3:24:07.340]  not going to have COVID death camps where the police are in there on video saying, we're
[3:24:07.340 --> 3:24:11.420]  going to gas you, we're not going to release you after your 14-day quarantine, you're a
[3:24:11.420 --> 3:24:16.300]  prisoner, we control you, we're not going to do that in America, and you know why?
[3:24:16.300 --> 3:24:20.620]  Because well, we have a second amendment, we are Americans, we're going to be peaceful,
[3:24:20.620 --> 3:24:25.220]  but we're also going to say no, and when we say no, we mean it, Joe Biden, you do not
[3:24:25.220 --> 3:24:31.020]  own our bodies, we control our bodies, oh, I'm glad you brought up the map, because people
[3:24:31.020 --> 3:24:36.500]  now need to understand, you've got to get to a vaccine rebellion state, if you want
[3:24:36.500 --> 3:24:42.220]  to live, if you're going to stay in California, Oregon, or New York, or wherever, unless you're
[3:24:42.220 --> 3:24:47.420]  in some very remote rural area, you are now at grave risk of being taken to a COVID death
[3:24:47.420 --> 3:24:49.340]  camp under the CDC and it's permanent.
[3:24:49.340 --> 3:24:52.460]  And by the way, you said that a year ago, so did I, now they're announcing it to the
[3:24:52.460 --> 3:24:56.380]  CDC documents that you wrote about a month ago, first place I saw it, they're like, oh,
[3:24:56.380 --> 3:25:00.020]  we're going to have shield in place for the healthy, we're going to take your children
[3:25:00.020 --> 3:25:05.340]  to protect you, even if you're not sick to a FEMA run camp, I mean, I mean, Biden's
[3:25:05.340 --> 3:25:08.460]  getting ready for this, we got to talk about what's the trigger for that, I think they
[3:25:08.460 --> 3:25:12.020]  know the third booster and I've talked to some scientists who agree, is going to create
[3:25:12.020 --> 3:25:17.460]  more of a Merrick's like effect that creates even more deadly viruses far worse than the
[3:25:17.460 --> 3:25:18.460]  Delta variant.
[3:25:18.460 --> 3:25:23.500]  Well, all that is necessary now that they've achieved mass vaccination with this version
[3:25:23.500 --> 3:25:30.020]  1.0 experimental vaccine, they've actually set up America to be to suffer mass death
[3:25:30.020 --> 3:25:37.860]  from the binary weapon release, which is another morphological version of COVID that has a
[3:25:37.860 --> 3:25:43.220]  different protein morphology on its outer surface, that the vaccine doesn't touch, but
[3:25:43.220 --> 3:25:48.220]  the immune system over responds to now you've covered this a lot, it's called antibody dependent
[3:25:48.220 --> 3:25:53.180]  enhancement, but what I'm saying is it's going to be provoked, not organic.
[3:25:53.180 --> 3:25:57.220]  In other words, it's not just natural mutations that are going to lead to this, I believe
[3:25:57.220 --> 3:26:03.980]  that Fauci and others involved in the bio weapons research, they already have the next
[3:26:03.980 --> 3:26:10.140]  version of this that can evade the vaccines, but elicit an immune hyper inflammatory response
[3:26:10.140 --> 3:26:12.300]  and that they are about to release that weapon.
[3:26:12.300 --> 3:26:16.380]  It's a binary weapon system, Alex, the vaccine, as you've said many times, the vaccine wasn't
[3:26:16.380 --> 3:26:17.860]  really designed to kill you.
[3:26:17.860 --> 3:26:22.620]  It was designed to set up your immune system with pathogenic priming, so that the release
[3:26:22.620 --> 3:26:29.300]  of this next phase would actually kill you, and then they could blame it on the unvaccinated
[3:26:29.300 --> 3:26:31.100]  rather than the vaccines themselves.
[3:26:31.100 --> 3:26:37.140]  So that's what's coming next, which we've now seen flying 180 degrees into the wind,
[3:26:37.140 --> 3:26:44.300]  the lie that this is a outbreak of the unvaccinated, almost 400% more hospitalizations, illnesses,
[3:26:44.300 --> 3:26:49.420]  deaths exploding, not as deadly as the original, but that has much better legs, very hard to
[3:26:49.420 --> 3:26:56.100]  get COVID-19 manmade, they over blew it, cancer patients, shotgun wounds, cancer, you know,
[3:26:56.100 --> 3:26:58.820]  people that had heart attacks, people that had died of pneumonia.
[3:26:58.820 --> 3:27:04.700]  Now though, they're trying to downplay it some until they get the really big numbers,
[3:27:04.700 --> 3:27:09.180]  and then again, as you just said, start blaming the unvaccinated, which they're doing, but
[3:27:09.180 --> 3:27:13.780]  I don't see that working, because even now Fox News is going, wait, learned immunity
[3:27:13.780 --> 3:27:16.460]  13 to 27 times better.
[3:27:16.460 --> 3:27:17.460]  What are you saying?
[3:27:17.460 --> 3:27:19.060]  What did you make, Mike, of last night?
[3:27:19.060 --> 3:27:23.540]  I'm sure you've seen it, Anderson Cooper had Fauci on and they said, is learned immunity
[3:27:23.540 --> 3:27:24.540]  better?
[3:27:24.540 --> 3:27:25.540]  What do you make of this?
[3:27:25.540 --> 3:27:29.140]  He said, I don't know if learned immunity does anything, or natural immunity, what do
[3:27:29.140 --> 3:27:30.140]  you make of that?
[3:27:30.140 --> 3:27:33.180]  Well, yeah, of course they're dismissing natural immunity, but I want to bring in one more
[3:27:33.180 --> 3:27:34.940]  point before we go to break here.
[3:27:34.940 --> 3:27:39.420]  And that is that Biden, by declaring this mandate against federal workers, Biden has
[3:27:39.420 --> 3:27:43.660]  just mass murdered federal workers who are willing to comply with this.
[3:27:43.660 --> 3:27:50.380]  So think about this, Alex, the upcoming financial insolvency of America, as Janet Yellen warned,
[3:27:50.380 --> 3:27:55.620]  the debt bubble is about to implode perhaps in October, unless the debt ceiling is lifted
[3:27:55.620 --> 3:27:58.380]  yet again, the money printing continues.
[3:27:58.380 --> 3:28:02.900]  How is the federal government going to pay federal workers if the dollar collapses?
[3:28:02.900 --> 3:28:04.540]  The answer is they can't.
[3:28:04.540 --> 3:28:08.260]  Maybe they want to get rid of them as quickly as possible so they don't have to meet payroll
[3:28:08.260 --> 3:28:09.260]  and pensions.
[3:28:09.260 --> 3:28:10.260]  Think about that.
[3:28:10.260 --> 3:28:12.900]  Mike, you just brought me where I wanted to go when I was thinking about your own show
[3:28:12.900 --> 3:28:15.700]  this morning, because I was thinking about him coming on today, what I want to ask him.
[3:28:15.700 --> 3:28:20.180]  I want to ask you about the debt bubble, China, what's happening with their housing market,
[3:28:20.180 --> 3:28:24.540]  and where all this is going, Afghanistan, how it all geopolitically ties together with
[3:28:24.540 --> 3:28:25.780]  the health ranger, naturalnews.com.
[3:28:25.780 --> 3:28:31.940]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones with IMPO Wars.
[3:28:31.940 --> 3:28:36.940]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:28:36.940 --> 3:28:42.860]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support,
[3:28:42.860 --> 3:28:47.460]  and for word of mouth, and we're all this together, and you know, it gets old having
[3:28:47.460 --> 3:28:51.140]  to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:28:51.140 --> 3:28:52.140]  But it's true.
[3:28:52.140 --> 3:28:55.860]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:28:55.860 --> 3:28:59.820]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors, and they've harassed and almost shut down
[3:28:59.820 --> 3:29:00.820]  everybody else.
[3:29:00.820 --> 3:29:04.780]  They crippled all the other groups, and we're still here, and as this whole new world order
[3:29:04.780 --> 3:29:07.660]  comes out and we open, our credibility is going up.
[3:29:07.660 --> 3:29:09.180]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:29:09.180 --> 3:29:11.300]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:29:11.300 --> 3:29:15.700]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America is still quasi-free.
[3:29:15.700 --> 3:29:19.620]  You can't have IMPO Wars has been proven right, be it on air, with all the craziness that's
[3:29:19.620 --> 3:29:20.620]  about to unfold.
[3:29:20.620 --> 3:29:22.900]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:29:22.900 --> 3:29:27.780]  So thank you all, and get an IMPOWARSTORE.COM, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements,
[3:29:27.780 --> 3:29:28.780]  and so much more.
[3:29:28.780 --> 3:29:30.780]  They're wonderful products, and they support the IMPOWAR.
[3:29:30.780 --> 3:29:31.780]  Thank you.
[3:29:31.780 --> 3:29:36.980]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[3:29:36.980 --> 3:29:39.020]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[3:29:39.020 --> 3:29:44.660]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[3:29:44.660 --> 3:29:45.660]  But we failed.
[3:29:45.660 --> 3:29:47.180]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[3:29:47.180 --> 3:29:52.860]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[3:29:52.860 --> 3:29:55.260]  deindustrialization great reset.
[3:29:55.260 --> 3:29:59.540]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[3:29:59.540 --> 3:30:04.180]  they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[3:30:04.180 --> 3:30:07.420]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, and
[3:30:07.420 --> 3:30:09.220]  we've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:30:09.220 --> 3:30:12.540]  And one of the number one things to do is high-quality, storeable food, you've got the
[3:30:12.540 --> 3:30:17.060]  best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at IMPOWARSTORE.COM.
[3:30:17.060 --> 3:30:21.060]  So whether it's a month or a six-month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[3:30:21.060 --> 3:30:22.460]  to ship right now.
[3:30:22.460 --> 3:30:27.620]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[3:30:27.620 --> 3:30:29.900]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[3:30:29.900 --> 3:30:32.460]  Get ready at IMPOWARSTORE.COM.
[3:30:32.460 --> 3:30:37.380]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight,
[3:30:37.380 --> 3:30:39.660]  and I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[3:30:39.660 --> 3:30:44.180]  I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[3:30:44.180 --> 3:30:48.740]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[3:30:48.740 --> 3:30:51.820]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that too, you had, you know, with a deep
[3:30:51.820 --> 3:30:54.740]  burden of tourists, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[3:30:54.740 --> 3:31:01.060]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[3:31:01.060 --> 3:31:04.340]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[3:31:04.340 --> 3:31:08.740]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[3:31:08.740 --> 3:31:10.860]  take basically all of your supplements.
[3:31:10.860 --> 3:31:12.860]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[3:31:12.860 --> 3:31:17.140]  The one I like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[3:31:17.140 --> 3:31:18.140]  It's amazing.
[3:31:18.140 --> 3:31:19.140]  It works.
[3:31:19.140 --> 3:31:22.300]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[3:31:22.300 --> 3:31:26.300]  the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our
[3:31:26.300 --> 3:31:27.300]  own hands.
[3:31:27.300 --> 3:31:28.300]  Beautifully said, brother.
[3:31:28.300 --> 3:31:30.740]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[3:31:30.740 --> 3:31:34.900]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[3:31:34.900 --> 3:31:40.100]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days, Monday at midnight, we've got to end
[3:31:40.100 --> 3:31:41.100]  this sale.
[3:31:41.100 --> 3:31:45.500]  We may end it earlier because we think it'll sell out by then at current sales rates.
[3:31:45.500 --> 3:31:47.140]  Vitamin refuge is super popular.
[3:31:47.140 --> 3:31:50.340]  It's got all the high quality vitamins and minerals that are essential, great amino
[3:31:50.340 --> 3:31:51.780]  acids, and it tastes great.
[3:31:51.780 --> 3:31:52.900]  It's powder formed.
[3:31:52.900 --> 3:31:56.340]  So in the water, you absorb it more when you drink the fruit punch.
[3:31:56.340 --> 3:31:58.620]  Then we also have back in stock.
[3:31:58.620 --> 3:32:03.100]  This sale will continue through next week, knock out sleep aid with eight organic ingredients
[3:32:03.100 --> 3:32:04.300]  that help you sleep better.

[3:32:56.860 --> 3:33:01.860]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:01.860 --> 3:33:05.780]  By the way, we're going to go right back to my good friend Mike Adams to cover the most
[3:33:05.780 --> 3:33:12.260]  important issues yet of this four hour transmission or three hours and 33 minutes in right now.
[3:33:12.260 --> 3:33:14.580]  But tomorrow, it'll air at five o'clock.
[3:33:14.580 --> 3:33:16.100]  I'm doing some of the interviews today.
[3:33:16.100 --> 3:33:17.100]  Some tomorrow.
[3:33:17.100 --> 3:33:18.100]  I'm a busy beaver.
[3:33:18.100 --> 3:33:19.100]  So is this great crew.
[3:33:19.100 --> 3:33:26.100]  Ernest Ramirez, who lost his son after he took the Pfizer shot, we're also going to have
[3:33:26.100 --> 3:33:29.900]  Dr. Richard Barrett has not been on with the shit that heads up that hospital, the major
[3:33:29.900 --> 3:33:34.260]  Texas city who has pioneered so much of saving people.
[3:33:34.260 --> 3:33:37.420]  He's going to be joining us.
[3:33:37.420 --> 3:33:39.740]  Also Steve Quayle, always an incredible interview.
[3:33:39.740 --> 3:33:42.740]  Robert Barnes, very informative and Joel Scalzen.
[3:33:42.740 --> 3:33:47.620]  So that's five interviews and more commercial free.
[3:33:47.620 --> 3:33:51.100]  When I say that we won't run the regular commercials for TV and radio station, we'll run a few
[3:33:51.100 --> 3:33:52.100]  breaks.
[3:33:52.100 --> 3:33:53.100]  So let's say commercial light.
[3:33:53.100 --> 3:33:55.100]  I mean, I'm going to take a few breaks, obviously.
[3:33:55.100 --> 3:33:57.100]  So that'll air at five p.m. tomorrow.
[3:33:57.100 --> 3:33:58.860]  We're, these are just such incredible times.
[3:33:58.860 --> 3:34:01.860]  I'm seven days a week.
[3:34:01.860 --> 3:34:07.540]  And I have been working, let's not exaggerate, 17 hours a day, 16 hours a day.
[3:34:07.540 --> 3:34:09.340]  And when all this got confirmed, I knew it was coming.
[3:34:09.340 --> 3:34:16.060]  I suddenly, like in my place, in my, what I was meant for, and I've just less, almost
[3:34:16.060 --> 3:34:18.620]  no anxiety, almost none of my anger issues.
[3:34:18.620 --> 3:34:20.140]  I hope this continues.
[3:34:20.140 --> 3:34:24.260]  It's a bad time to be in, but I guess when you're in a foxhole, you get your act together
[3:34:24.260 --> 3:34:25.260]  or SH-D together.
[3:34:25.260 --> 3:34:29.460]  And I've kind of had myself squared away, but I've gotten a lot better.
[3:34:29.460 --> 3:34:30.460]  So it's quite a transformation.
[3:34:30.460 --> 3:34:32.500]  I think a lot of you are going through it as well.
[3:34:32.500 --> 3:34:35.300]  My friends and family are the same.
[3:34:35.300 --> 3:34:36.300]  It's a quickening.
[3:34:36.300 --> 3:34:37.300]  We can all feel it.
[3:34:37.300 --> 3:34:39.020]  So what a time to be alive.
[3:34:39.020 --> 3:34:44.660]  So the health ranger, Mike Adams of naturalmoves.com, brought this up.
[3:34:44.660 --> 3:34:47.540]  You have George Soros trying to crash the Chinese market.
[3:34:47.540 --> 3:34:51.140]  Now, as much as I don't like the Chi-Coms, a global collapse in China is going to hurt
[3:34:51.140 --> 3:34:52.140]  us there.
[3:34:52.140 --> 3:34:53.140]  It's a constant world depression.
[3:34:53.140 --> 3:34:56.260]  He's also trying to crash markets here and in Europe on record.
[3:34:56.260 --> 3:34:58.780]  Remember, he used to be known as a terrorist when I was young.
[3:34:58.780 --> 3:35:00.580]  I was 10 years old.
[3:35:00.580 --> 3:35:04.060]  My mom had a color TV, has a big deal back then, you know, in the kitchen, cooking dinner
[3:35:04.060 --> 3:35:05.060]  every night.
[3:35:05.060 --> 3:35:07.420]  You know, she cooked two meals a day, three meals on Saturday and Sunday.
[3:35:07.420 --> 3:35:08.620]  Great cook.
[3:35:08.620 --> 3:35:11.420]  And I'd be in there in the kitchen trying to get food early when I got home from school.
[3:35:11.420 --> 3:35:15.940]  You know, get in the refrigerator, get a popsicle earlier or whatever, she'd be slapping my hand.
[3:35:15.940 --> 3:35:20.380]  Literally get in the cookie jar and it'd be George Soros, you know, just trying to crash
[3:35:20.380 --> 3:35:24.380]  the power of international criminal, James Bond villain, but then he bought the media
[3:35:24.380 --> 3:35:25.900]  and now he's the hero.
[3:35:25.900 --> 3:35:28.460]  So he's trying to crash the Chinese markets.
[3:35:28.460 --> 3:35:30.060]  They've labeled him a criminal terrorist.
[3:35:30.060 --> 3:35:32.900]  Here's the big national, you know, Chinese news.
[3:35:32.900 --> 3:35:33.900]  Some of this paradox.
[3:35:33.900 --> 3:35:34.900]  I don't like G.C.
[3:35:34.900 --> 3:35:35.900]  Pinker Communist.
[3:35:35.900 --> 3:35:38.300]  But at the same time, I know the globalists are frankly worse.
[3:35:38.300 --> 3:35:43.180]  They put the Chi-Coms in power, but at the Chi-Coms saying, we're going to have three children.
[3:35:43.180 --> 3:35:45.020]  Men are going to be men, women, women.
[3:35:45.020 --> 3:35:46.500]  We're going to execute homosexuals.
[3:35:46.500 --> 3:35:47.500]  I don't agree with that.
[3:35:47.500 --> 3:35:53.860]  It's how far right-wing they're going to pair to the leftist alien, new world order.
[3:35:53.860 --> 3:36:00.300]  So I wanted to get your take on this and who you think the power structures are and what
[3:36:00.300 --> 3:36:02.780]  do you think is on the surface or whether it's real.
[3:36:02.780 --> 3:36:03.780]  I think it's real.
[3:36:03.780 --> 3:36:07.740]  We saw Stalin and Hitler, you know, have a break up from their little palsy, walsy thing.
[3:36:07.740 --> 3:36:11.660]  And I think that's where you were going with this debt bubble has been pumped to a level
[3:36:11.660 --> 3:36:12.660]  beyond Zimbabwe.
[3:36:12.660 --> 3:36:14.580]  Where do you see it going Mike Adams?
[3:36:14.580 --> 3:36:19.660]  Well, we have actually an incredible opportunity ahead here after the collapse of this current
[3:36:19.660 --> 3:36:20.660]  system.
[3:36:20.660 --> 3:36:25.380]  And let's be clear, the central banks are the terrorists and they've been terrorizing
[3:36:25.380 --> 3:36:31.780]  the workers of the world, the producers of the world, you know, for over a century.
[3:36:31.780 --> 3:36:38.540]  When your earnings can be looted and stolen by just unrestricted money printing, which
[3:36:38.540 --> 3:36:44.980]  really took off after 1971, when Nixon took us off the gold standard, then that's economic
[3:36:44.980 --> 3:36:45.980]  terrorism right there.
[3:36:45.980 --> 3:36:51.220]  So yeah, George Soros has his own forms of assaulting humanity, but the central banks
[3:36:51.220 --> 3:36:54.020]  are by far, I think, the bigger risk now.
[3:36:54.020 --> 3:36:55.020]  That's right.
[3:36:55.020 --> 3:36:58.020]  He's like a 10 foot shark or 5,000 foot long shark stop.
[3:36:58.020 --> 3:36:59.020]  Right.
[3:36:59.020 --> 3:37:00.020]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:37:00.020 --> 3:37:01.020]  Exactly.
[3:37:01.020 --> 3:37:02.660]  Now this current system, I believe, is absolutely going to collapse.
[3:37:02.660 --> 3:37:06.460]  We don't know the timing, but we can do the math and we know it will end.
[3:37:06.460 --> 3:37:12.020]  The question is, are we the people who survive all of this, which won't be a lot of the vaccinated
[3:37:12.020 --> 3:37:13.700]  people, by the way.
[3:37:13.700 --> 3:37:18.260]  But those who survive all of this, are we smart enough to say, let's not rebuild the
[3:37:18.260 --> 3:37:20.700]  same broken system again?
[3:37:20.700 --> 3:37:24.940]  Or are we stupid enough to say, yeah, let's have the same system again that will eventually
[3:37:24.940 --> 3:37:29.380]  print money and cause the same collapse, you know, in another three generations or so.
[3:37:29.380 --> 3:37:30.380]  So this is an opportunity.
[3:37:30.380 --> 3:37:35.900]  And I believe that cryptocurrency has paved the way for a conceptual framework that can
[3:37:35.900 --> 3:37:38.460]  actually decentralize money.
[3:37:38.460 --> 3:37:43.060]  And this is why, I believe, by the way, at least temporarily, Bitcoin is going to completely
[3:37:43.060 --> 3:37:46.660]  skyrocket once the dollar collapse becomes evident to people.
[3:37:46.660 --> 3:37:50.260]  Now it may not stay that way, but obviously people are going to flee out of the dollar
[3:37:50.260 --> 3:37:54.420]  into other kinds of cryptocurrencies and so into gold and silver.
[3:37:54.420 --> 3:37:56.140]  You're thinking we do see a dollar collapse.
[3:37:56.140 --> 3:37:59.740]  I mean, everything Biden's doing, the way he left Afghanistan, the way he's attacking
[3:37:59.740 --> 3:38:04.020]  America, the way he's pushing forced inoculations to break up businesses, that's how you'd kill
[3:38:04.020 --> 3:38:10.420]  a currency, you'd put a puppet creep keeper in to make the whole world leave your currency.
[3:38:10.420 --> 3:38:11.420]  Well that's right.
[3:38:11.420 --> 3:38:15.780]  We're already seeing the breakdown of the corporations and the supply lines of everything
[3:38:15.780 --> 3:38:21.300]  from steel to resins and plastics and food and minerals and so on, aluminum, electronic
[3:38:21.300 --> 3:38:25.020]  and inflation boards, right, and inflation, like you said.
[3:38:25.020 --> 3:38:28.820]  So think about what's going to happen now with Biden announcing that all companies with
[3:38:28.820 --> 3:38:32.420]  a hundred or more employees have to mass vaccinate their own employees.
[3:38:32.420 --> 3:38:35.180]  Well a lot of those employees are going to quit at this point.
[3:38:35.180 --> 3:38:38.700]  In fact a large number have said they would quit according to recent polls.
[3:38:38.700 --> 3:38:44.340]  So you're going to have, this is the controlled or engineered demolition, 9-11 style.
[3:38:44.340 --> 3:38:47.500]  This is like building seven of the economy.
[3:38:47.500 --> 3:38:52.060]  Controlled demolition of the economy, they planted the charges, they pulled it, they're
[3:38:52.060 --> 3:38:54.340]  bringing down the economic system.
[3:38:54.340 --> 3:39:00.540]  This is one of the explosive charges in essence by demanding the vaccine mandates in these
[3:39:00.540 --> 3:39:01.540]  companies.
[3:39:01.540 --> 3:39:05.780]  You're rapidly arriving at a place where you won't be able to engage in commercial transactions
[3:39:05.780 --> 3:39:08.620]  with any sense of reliability.
[3:39:08.620 --> 3:39:14.300]  Once that happens, the efficiencies of a highly fluid market collapse quite rapidly and then
[3:39:14.300 --> 3:39:18.140]  you get into what I'm going to call the Peter Schiff scenarios.
[3:39:18.140 --> 3:39:22.860]  And he's been right about this all along, Schiff, you know, he's, you should have him
[3:39:22.860 --> 3:39:27.660]  back on soon to talk about this, I think, because he understands what this collapse
[3:39:27.660 --> 3:39:28.660]  looks like.
[3:39:28.660 --> 3:39:31.900]  And I see being a little bit in Bitcoin and other things as just having different eggs
[3:39:31.900 --> 3:39:32.900]  and different baskets.
[3:39:32.900 --> 3:39:34.580]  Schiff is such a purist against it.
[3:39:34.580 --> 3:39:36.060]  I'm like, hey, I like what Schiff's saying.
[3:39:36.060 --> 3:39:37.060]  That's a real scenario.
[3:39:37.060 --> 3:39:38.700]  And then there's a scenario over here.
[3:39:38.700 --> 3:39:40.060]  How about we be diversified?
[3:39:40.060 --> 3:39:41.540]  That seems smart to me.
[3:39:41.540 --> 3:39:43.180]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[3:39:43.180 --> 3:39:46.140]  And I think cryptocurrency is the answer.
[3:39:46.140 --> 3:39:50.780]  Some form of it, maybe not Bitcoin itself, but some form of a decentralized peer-to-peer
[3:39:50.780 --> 3:39:51.780]  system.
[3:39:51.780 --> 3:39:52.780]  I agree.
[3:39:52.780 --> 3:39:53.780]  We need something separate from them.
[3:39:53.780 --> 3:39:54.780]  And they're trying to drive it down.
[3:39:54.780 --> 3:39:55.780]  That's why I'm supporting it.
[3:39:55.780 --> 3:39:58.860]  These big central bankers are trying to collapse it right now every day.
[3:39:58.860 --> 3:39:59.860]  That's why I'm supporting it.
[3:39:59.860 --> 3:40:01.500]  It doesn't mean it doesn't have pitfalls and problems.
[3:40:01.500 --> 3:40:03.440]  Let me ask you this question.
[3:40:03.440 --> 3:40:09.100]  What do you think is going to come out of this when the dollar collapses?
[3:40:09.100 --> 3:40:14.220]  Because obviously all these global currencies at one point are going to collapse via hyperinflation.
[3:40:14.220 --> 3:40:17.660]  Well, it's very clear what James Rickards talks about.
[3:40:17.660 --> 3:40:22.540]  And remember, he was at long-term capital management in 1997 when they were the first
[3:40:22.540 --> 3:40:27.020]  example of too big to fail, and they got the bailout, that this will be a cascading failure
[3:40:27.020 --> 3:40:30.740]  that ripples through the central banks and the currencies of the world because of the
[3:40:30.740 --> 3:40:33.180]  interconnectedness of the financial system.
[3:40:33.180 --> 3:40:37.300]  We're going to have global bank freezes, transactional freezes that will lead to the
[3:40:37.300 --> 3:40:42.540]  inability of even local power companies to purchase coal or raw materials to run the
[3:40:42.540 --> 3:40:43.540]  power grid.
[3:40:43.540 --> 3:40:47.420]  And they're going to call that the great reset, because they know what collapse is coming,
[3:40:47.420 --> 3:40:51.340]  so they're doing a controlled collapse like Red Deer using explosives to put on an oil
[3:40:51.340 --> 3:40:55.380]  fire, and they're going to call the great reset, and act like it's a good thing that
[3:40:55.380 --> 3:40:56.940]  they did on purpose, right?
[3:40:56.940 --> 3:40:58.460]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:40:58.460 --> 3:41:04.140]  This is the engineered great reset, and it leads very quickly to mass starvation, to widespread
[3:41:04.140 --> 3:41:10.300]  famine, and then people running for the FEMA camps, which will be the death camps in America.
[3:41:10.300 --> 3:41:14.500]  And by the way, Alex, just on a personal note, isn't it fascinating, you and I, we've studied
[3:41:14.500 --> 3:41:20.240]  this for decades, isn't it fascinating that we know so much of how this is going to play
[3:41:20.240 --> 3:41:25.460]  out, and it's unfolding exactly as we've been describing, especially you.
[3:41:25.460 --> 3:41:27.820]  You were ahead of me by many years on this.
[3:41:27.820 --> 3:41:32.820]  It's like, again, they're calling you Nostradamus now, but as you say publicly, you're just
[3:41:32.820 --> 3:41:34.740]  reading the blueprints of the globalists.
[3:41:34.740 --> 3:41:37.540]  It's all happening as the plan is.
[3:41:37.540 --> 3:41:41.780]  Well, that's what's frustrating, is people didn't want to believe that there's a bad
[3:41:41.780 --> 3:41:45.340]  powerful group of ultra wretched that want to have total control and populate, but they're
[3:41:45.340 --> 3:41:48.860]  saying it, and I looked, hey, they're in charge, and they've done most of what they said they
[3:41:48.860 --> 3:41:49.860]  do.
[3:41:49.860 --> 3:41:51.780]  So I'm like, hey, folks, it's going to happen.
[3:41:51.780 --> 3:41:52.780]  It's going to happen.
[3:41:52.780 --> 3:41:56.380]  And I knew we'd have explosive credibility once they finally launched it.
[3:41:56.380 --> 3:41:59.340]  That's what they tried to get me off air the last three years and you and others.
[3:41:59.340 --> 3:42:01.940]  So we wouldn't be on air once this all launched.
[3:42:01.940 --> 3:42:04.100]  But now we're still on air once it launched.
[3:42:04.100 --> 3:42:06.940]  Now they kill us or imprison us, it only makes us more powerful.
[3:42:06.940 --> 3:42:11.100]  So again, we know, we know what's coming next.
[3:42:11.100 --> 3:42:14.780]  You know, I know, your guests know, we absolutely know.
[3:42:14.780 --> 3:42:19.780]  So folks, you know, Info Wars is your headquarters for knowing the next stage.
[3:42:19.780 --> 3:42:20.780]  And natural news.
[3:42:20.780 --> 3:42:23.740]  The more the more the more the merriest we were all targets here.
[3:42:23.740 --> 3:42:24.740]  I'm not that bored.
[3:42:24.740 --> 3:42:25.740]  Folks, don't get me globblestone.
[3:42:25.740 --> 3:42:26.740]  We'll be right back.
[3:42:26.740 --> 3:42:37.740]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:42:37.740 --> 3:42:58.740]  Info Wars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[3:42:58.740 --> 3:43:00.700]  The great awakening is here.
[3:43:00.700 --> 3:43:07.420]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[3:43:07.420 --> 3:43:27.100]  The information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[3:43:27.100 --> 3:43:29.580]  Info Wars.com.
[3:43:29.580 --> 3:43:36.340]  In late August, Info Wars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[3:43:36.340 --> 3:43:42.660]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[3:43:42.660 --> 3:43:45.780]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[3:43:45.780 --> 3:43:49.060]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[3:43:49.060 --> 3:43:50.060]  have.
[3:43:50.060 --> 3:43:52.900]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water
[3:43:52.900 --> 3:43:56.780]  filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[3:43:56.780 --> 3:44:00.420]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[3:44:00.420 --> 3:44:03.540]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[3:44:03.540 --> 3:44:04.540]  It's high quality.
[3:44:04.540 --> 3:44:09.300]  It's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future, you're going to see
[3:44:09.300 --> 3:44:13.620]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[3:44:13.620 --> 3:44:14.940]  already taking place.
[3:44:14.940 --> 3:44:21.220]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the Info War at infowarstore.com.
[3:44:21.220 --> 3:44:25.060]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[3:44:25.060 --> 3:44:26.060]  control.
[3:44:26.060 --> 3:44:30.500]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[3:44:30.500 --> 3:44:35.860]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something.
[3:44:35.860 --> 3:44:40.220]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[3:44:40.220 --> 3:44:41.220]  the years.
[3:44:41.220 --> 3:44:44.820]  It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the
[3:44:44.820 --> 3:44:45.820]  listeners of this show.
[3:44:45.820 --> 3:44:48.660]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[3:44:48.660 --> 3:44:52.260]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter you got red
[3:44:52.260 --> 3:44:53.260]  blood.
[3:44:53.260 --> 3:44:57.980]  And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[3:44:57.980 --> 3:45:02.300]  and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you
[3:45:02.300 --> 3:45:03.300]  over the years.
[3:45:03.300 --> 3:45:06.660]  And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[3:45:06.660 --> 3:45:10.260]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[3:45:10.260 --> 3:45:15.340]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[3:45:15.340 --> 3:45:17.660]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[3:45:17.660 --> 3:45:21.260]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[3:45:21.260 --> 3:45:26.740]  done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully
[3:45:26.740 --> 3:45:29.260]  God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse.
[3:45:29.260 --> 3:45:30.260]  God bless.
[3:45:30.260 --> 3:45:34.900]  Just a week ago, we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion back in stock
[3:45:34.900 --> 3:45:37.940]  and it was only half of the order we wanted to get.
[3:45:37.940 --> 3:45:42.380]  But because we won't cut corners on the quality of what goes into it, the factory can only
[3:45:42.380 --> 3:45:43.380]  get limited supply.
[3:45:43.380 --> 3:45:45.500]  So again, it was half the order we wanted.
[3:45:45.500 --> 3:45:50.580]  But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33% off so everybody on the fence will get
[3:45:50.580 --> 3:45:51.580]  it.
[3:45:51.580 --> 3:45:53.500]  It's critical for your immune system and your whole body.
[3:45:53.500 --> 3:45:57.300]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals, and a bunch of key amino acids at
[3:45:57.300 --> 3:45:58.660]  infowarsstore.com.
[3:45:58.660 --> 3:46:04.020]  So while supplies last until it runs out, we're selling it for 33% off and it'll be
[3:46:04.020 --> 3:46:05.900]  months until more comes in.
[3:46:05.900 --> 3:46:10.820]  So get yours today at infowarsstore.com because it's not just a great product, we need those
[3:46:10.820 --> 3:46:12.700]  funds to keep operating as well.
[3:46:12.700 --> 3:46:14.100]  We're all in a catch-22.
[3:46:14.100 --> 3:46:18.780]  But we have another great product, hair and beard formula, that's really a great multivitamin
[3:46:18.780 --> 3:46:22.580]  mineral system that's one of the best multivitamin mineral systems out there.
[3:46:22.580 --> 3:46:24.580]  It's just called hair and beard.
[3:46:24.580 --> 3:46:26.340]  So get that as well for your immune system.
[3:46:26.340 --> 3:46:33.540]  It's great for women, great for children, but it's designed for men in infowarsstore.com.
[3:46:33.540 --> 3:46:44.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:46:44.860 --> 3:46:48.660]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show final segment in the war rooms on and then I am
[3:46:48.660 --> 3:46:54.140]  going to do three interviews today and like two or three tomorrow for the 5 p.m. special
[3:46:54.140 --> 3:46:56.940]  report that you don't want to miss, and I hope you'll share because that's what it's
[3:46:56.940 --> 3:46:57.940]  really all about.
[3:46:57.940 --> 3:47:01.940]  Now, talk about being Shimpotico, being linked up, being synced.
[3:47:01.940 --> 3:47:07.420]  I meant to, at the very first interview, ask Mike Adams what he thinks about September
[3:47:07.420 --> 3:47:11.460]  11th, and these fake Pentagon reports they're putting out, I mean, they're real reports
[3:47:11.460 --> 3:47:16.660]  with their fake info with the Southern Primary Law Center and ADL and the FBI that the right
[3:47:16.660 --> 3:47:21.140]  wing is linked up with the Taliban, no, that's Biden, and they're going to blow stuff up
[3:47:21.140 --> 3:47:26.580]  and kill people on September 11th, and my phone's blowing up with a lot of great people
[3:47:26.580 --> 3:47:29.860]  saying, you know, it's tomorrow going to be horrible, it's tomorrow going to be a big
[3:47:29.860 --> 3:47:33.860]  crisis, so I was about to ask Mike about that, and then he comes on during the break and
[3:47:33.860 --> 3:47:35.940]  says, hey, Alex, I want to get into this.
[3:47:35.940 --> 3:47:39.180]  Mike, you can always get in whatever you want, so I'm glad you brought this up.
[3:47:39.180 --> 3:47:44.900]  I mean, clearly this would be a big day on the 20th anniversary of 9-11 to pull something.
[3:47:44.900 --> 3:47:45.900]  What do you think?
[3:47:45.900 --> 3:47:51.300]  Well, I want to share with your audience here today a credible source that shared with me
[3:47:51.300 --> 3:47:57.540]  just recently that the intelligence community and the State Department is reportedly aware
[3:47:57.540 --> 3:48:03.500]  that there have been 12 surface-to-air missiles of Chinese origin smuggled into the United
[3:48:03.500 --> 3:48:09.380]  States that crossed the U.S. Southern border in Texas specifically, and in addition to
[3:48:09.380 --> 3:48:14.980]  those SAMs, that there's also believed to be 150 pounds of Semtex explosives that's
[3:48:14.980 --> 3:48:22.060]  in the hands of terrorists who are being groomed by the Chinese, you know, the PLA military
[3:48:22.060 --> 3:48:27.540]  that works with the Mexican drug cartels that run these trafficking routes.
[3:48:27.540 --> 3:48:32.900]  So this, my understanding is that the intelligence community and the State Department are right
[3:48:32.900 --> 3:48:38.700]  now trying desperately to locate and reacquire these materials before they can be used in
[3:48:38.700 --> 3:48:39.860]  terror attacks.
[3:48:39.860 --> 3:48:44.940]  Tomorrow, obviously, September 11th is an obvious target, but other target dates extend
[3:48:44.940 --> 3:48:49.980]  for the next several months, including November 11th and November 9th because of the, you
[3:48:49.980 --> 3:48:52.140]  know, the occult numerology there.
[3:48:52.140 --> 3:48:56.980]  The obvious targets of this, Alex, should these terrorist weapons be unleashed, might
[3:48:56.980 --> 3:48:59.780]  be civilian jetliners.
[3:48:59.780 --> 3:49:05.940]  They might be infrastructure targets such as refineries or dams or power grid substations.
[3:49:05.940 --> 3:49:10.980]  So, you know, we pray for the safety of all Americans, we hope that these weapons can
[3:49:10.980 --> 3:49:16.740]  be discovered and reacquired and locked down, and I also pray that the deep state doesn't
[3:49:16.740 --> 3:49:21.740]  try to use these to set up conservatives for some kind of a false flag, you know, to blow
[3:49:21.740 --> 3:49:26.940]  something out of the sky in collusion with the Chinese communists and then somehow blame,
[3:49:26.940 --> 3:49:30.940]  you know, right-wing Bubba for doing it because, you know, right-wing Bubba doesn't want to
[3:49:30.940 --> 3:49:31.940]  blow jetliners out of the sky.
[3:49:31.940 --> 3:49:38.140]  And we've seen massive preparatory brainwashing of, oh, the FBI says the right-wing's linking
[3:49:38.140 --> 3:49:42.460]  up with Taliban, just ridiculous crap, but they think the public's dumb enough to buy
[3:49:42.460 --> 3:49:43.460]  it.
[3:49:43.460 --> 3:49:47.420]  Well, right, I mean, typical conservative Americans, they just want their country back,
[3:49:47.420 --> 3:49:50.220]  they want their freedom back, they want peace and abundance, they want to be able to go
[3:49:50.220 --> 3:49:55.300]  back to their businesses and be left alone by Biden that's now, you know, pushing the
[3:49:55.300 --> 3:50:01.220]  vaccine mandates and so on, but I would just caution everybody to be very, very aware of
[3:50:01.220 --> 3:50:02.660]  these possibilities.
[3:50:02.660 --> 3:50:08.380]  Maybe tomorrow's not a great day to be in a high-rise building or a crowded, you know,
[3:50:08.380 --> 3:50:10.140]  population area or things of that nature.
[3:50:10.140 --> 3:50:15.580]  Just be cautious, be on the lookout and wherever you are, if the weird things start to happen,
[3:50:15.580 --> 3:50:16.780]  start recording.
[3:50:16.780 --> 3:50:20.780]  Start recording and don't let the FBI confiscate your phones, by the way, because-
[3:50:20.780 --> 3:50:24.820]  I'll say that with another big advance, since you mentioned that, they've been helping people
[3:50:24.820 --> 3:50:29.140]  for almost eight months in solitary confinement, many of which were not violent, were waved
[3:50:29.140 --> 3:50:30.140]  into the Capitol.
[3:50:30.140 --> 3:50:34.500]  They're not defending the 30 or 40 that attacked the police or pooped on Nancy Pelosi's table,
[3:50:34.500 --> 3:50:35.500]  that's wrong.
[3:50:35.500 --> 3:50:38.580]  You still don't deserve a solitary confinement, they deserve to have trials.
[3:50:38.580 --> 3:50:41.940]  But the former FBI director came out and called people terrorists that want to demonstrate
[3:50:41.940 --> 3:50:46.780]  next Saturday for the bad treatment of the people held for January 6th.
[3:50:46.780 --> 3:50:48.540]  There's a lot of people going.
[3:50:48.540 --> 3:50:52.100]  We also see them said they're going to put a fence back up around the Capitol.
[3:50:52.100 --> 3:50:56.460]  Pelosi says they're coming to celebrate those that wanted to kill members of Congress on
[3:50:56.460 --> 3:50:57.460]  January 6th.
[3:50:57.460 --> 3:51:00.660]  They're seeing a lot of really bizarre rhetoric coming out of them.
[3:51:00.660 --> 3:51:01.660]  What do you make of that?
[3:51:01.660 --> 3:51:06.820]  Well, I think that the precedent being set by the treatment of the January 6th peaceful
[3:51:06.820 --> 3:51:13.060]  protesters, again, with a few who did odd things, but the treatment of them really tells
[3:51:13.060 --> 3:51:16.300]  you how Biden plans to treat the unvaccinated.
[3:51:16.300 --> 3:51:20.100]  Because the unvaccinated are going to be considered to be engaged in dissent.
[3:51:20.100 --> 3:51:23.900]  And it's possible that Biden might even declare governors of red states to be involved in
[3:51:23.900 --> 3:51:24.900]  an insurrection.
[3:51:24.900 --> 3:51:29.740]  The talking point all over the news in late night comedy in the White House is you're
[3:51:29.740 --> 3:51:30.740]  a murderer.
[3:51:30.740 --> 3:51:31.740]  You're a terrorist.
[3:51:31.740 --> 3:51:34.980]  If you don't wear a mask or take the shots.
[3:51:34.980 --> 3:51:35.980]  That's right.
[3:51:35.980 --> 3:51:36.980]  They're trying to set that precedent.
[3:51:36.980 --> 3:51:42.340]  Now, I thought that Biden might have announced nationwide highway checkpoints, you know,
[3:51:42.340 --> 3:51:43.940]  vaccine checkpoints last night.
[3:51:43.940 --> 3:51:45.260]  He didn't go that far.
[3:51:45.260 --> 3:51:49.100]  It's clear that that's one of the next steps that he will invoke if he gets away with the
[3:51:49.100 --> 3:51:50.300]  current effort.
[3:51:50.300 --> 3:51:54.300]  But there's so much backlash now that I think the White House is backing away from highway
[3:51:54.300 --> 3:51:55.420]  checkpoints there.
[3:51:55.420 --> 3:51:58.220]  They know that that would never fly, especially in red states.
[3:51:58.220 --> 3:52:03.300]  So we really have to thank our state legislatures, our governors, our attorneys general.
[3:52:03.300 --> 3:52:06.700]  Yeah, let them know more of this, more leadership.
[3:52:06.700 --> 3:52:08.780]  Yeah, exactly right.
[3:52:08.780 --> 3:52:13.180]  You need to call your attorney general in your state and tell them it's time to push
[3:52:13.180 --> 3:52:16.580]  back against this lawlessness by the Biden regime.
[3:52:16.580 --> 3:52:21.620]  And it's time to reassert the 10th Amendment states rights and also medical choice for
[3:52:21.620 --> 3:52:23.300]  the citizens of your state.
[3:52:23.300 --> 3:52:27.260]  And by the way, Alex, you know, the attorneys general of these states, they have the power
[3:52:27.260 --> 3:52:30.500]  to issue criminal indictments against Fauci.
[3:52:30.500 --> 3:52:34.980]  So what Senator Rand Paul and Senator Cotton are calling for, which is the criminal investigation
[3:52:34.980 --> 3:52:38.700]  indictment of Fauci, this can actually be done by states.
[3:52:38.700 --> 3:52:40.340]  They can issue arrest warrants.
[3:52:40.340 --> 3:52:43.900]  If Fauci ever sets foot in those states, he can be arrested on site.
[3:52:43.900 --> 3:52:46.580]  And let's explain that's how tyrants always are.
[3:52:46.580 --> 3:52:49.620]  They push, they push, they get away with it, they get really arrogant, pushing them more.
[3:52:49.620 --> 3:52:54.580]  Then they go crazy, megalomania, then they go too far, they go to prison, or they get
[3:52:54.580 --> 3:52:57.380]  up and died and then convicted and then get executed.
[3:52:57.380 --> 3:53:02.180]  And so, yeah, it's either us or them and absolutely it must happen, because as you said, they've
[3:53:02.180 --> 3:53:06.300]  been caught with the Wuhan documents, it's open and shut, gain of function, lied to Congress,
[3:53:06.300 --> 3:53:11.100]  they did this on purpose, and now they need to fry for it, or they're going to totally
[3:53:11.100 --> 3:53:13.540]  run our lives and poison and kill us.
[3:53:13.540 --> 3:53:14.540]  It's us or them.
[3:53:14.540 --> 3:53:22.220]  Yeah, and it's very important that we, the conservatives of America, the pro-human people
[3:53:22.220 --> 3:53:25.940]  of this country, do not get baited into any kind of a violent reaction.
[3:53:25.940 --> 3:53:26.940]  I agree.
[3:53:26.940 --> 3:53:31.500]  So we must maintain peace, do not bring weapons to protest because you're being set up.
[3:53:31.500 --> 3:53:33.060]  Do not be offensively violent.
[3:53:33.060 --> 3:53:36.340]  Take over your government through voting, through the system, through protesting, and
[3:53:36.340 --> 3:53:39.180]  then have them indict and arrest these people.
[3:53:39.180 --> 3:53:40.180]  That's right.
[3:53:40.180 --> 3:53:45.180]  Congress needs to be done Gandhi-style, which is civil disobedience, and remember that Biden
[3:53:45.180 --> 3:53:49.220]  and the tyrants are going to continue to show their hands with each passing week.
[3:53:49.220 --> 3:53:53.420]  I mean, they are, in essence, destroying themselves with their tyranny.
[3:53:53.420 --> 3:53:54.420]  Right.
[3:53:54.420 --> 3:53:59.140]  I mean, all we've got to do is watch them commit political suicide, which is exactly
[3:53:59.140 --> 3:54:00.140]  what Biden-
[3:54:00.140 --> 3:54:01.140]  And stay out of their way so they don't crush us.
[3:54:01.140 --> 3:54:02.700]  I want to raise two points for you.
[3:54:02.700 --> 3:54:04.500]  They can't even get their propaganda straight.
[3:54:04.500 --> 3:54:09.260]  Pelosi, Fauci, all of them sit before, oh no, we don't want to have forced injections,
[3:54:09.260 --> 3:54:15.860]  but now even the CDC's own website says, other myths and facts, CDC cannot mandate that I
[3:54:15.860 --> 3:54:17.900]  get a COVID-19 vaccine.
[3:54:17.900 --> 3:54:22.020]  So they're now even backing off what's on their own sites and now trying to gaslight
[3:54:22.020 --> 3:54:23.020]  us.
[3:54:23.020 --> 3:54:24.140]  This is not going well.
[3:54:24.140 --> 3:54:28.940]  Well, as your previous guest today, Robert Barnes, correctly mentioned, there's not even
[3:54:28.940 --> 3:54:31.540]  a vaccine that's approved in the United States.
[3:54:31.540 --> 3:54:34.660]  You know, the FDA approved community, which you can't get.
[3:54:34.660 --> 3:54:36.940]  So this whole thing is a fraud.
[3:54:36.940 --> 3:54:39.860]  And the reason they're trying to rush it, I believe, Alex, is because they know that
[3:54:39.860 --> 3:54:44.300]  legally this is all going to be picked apart day by day, month by month.
[3:54:44.300 --> 3:54:50.060]  I mean, the whole vaccine regime is collapsing and the Biden regime is also collapsing.
[3:54:50.060 --> 3:54:52.820]  But that the legal challenges take time.
[3:54:52.820 --> 3:54:56.660]  So in the meantime, they're just trying to do a mad rush, like a bum rush of getting
[3:54:56.660 --> 3:55:00.260]  as many people injected as possible because that's their extermination agenda.
[3:55:00.260 --> 3:55:02.980]  Because exactly, because the globalists don't care if their puppets get destroyed.
[3:55:02.980 --> 3:55:03.980]  That's right.
[3:55:03.980 --> 3:55:05.480]  They're throwing a mess.
[3:55:05.480 --> 3:55:08.180]  Last point, this is a meme that goes around, it's totally true.
[3:55:08.180 --> 3:55:13.700]  Why is it that your boss says, have sex with me or you're fired, it's considered coercion.
[3:55:13.700 --> 3:55:17.100]  But your boss says, take the shot or you're fired and it's not coercive.
[3:55:17.100 --> 3:55:20.340]  They both want to stick something in you that you don't want.
[3:55:20.340 --> 3:55:23.940]  Well, I would argue, unless the guy had a disease, and I'm not arguing for rape of
[3:55:23.940 --> 3:55:28.740]  your employees, I'm saying that would be least less offensive than Bill Gates's eugenics
[3:55:28.740 --> 3:55:32.820]  based system that give you heart attacks, cancer permanently affects you, I'd rather
[3:55:32.820 --> 3:55:37.460]  be raped than take the shot because it's something even more deadly.
[3:55:37.460 --> 3:55:39.540]  So I mean, that's really what this is.
[3:55:39.540 --> 3:55:44.380]  Well, it is the vaccine coercion is a form of medical rape.
[3:55:44.380 --> 3:55:51.180]  And that meme is exactly accurate here because your boss has a position of power over you.
[3:55:51.180 --> 3:55:58.060]  Biden is essentially ordering corporations to exploit that power in order to coerce subordinates
[3:55:58.060 --> 3:56:00.940]  into submitting their bodies to medical rape.
[3:56:00.940 --> 3:56:03.300]  Demons groups should be up in arms over this.
[3:56:03.300 --> 3:56:08.300]  The ACLU should be up in arms, but instead, they're on the side of vaccine mandates.
[3:56:08.300 --> 3:56:12.140]  So this is a great filtering out of evil versus good.
[3:56:12.140 --> 3:56:15.020]  And that's what's beautiful about this moment in history, Alex.
[3:56:15.020 --> 3:56:17.880]  The silver lining to all of this is that it's all coming out.
[3:56:17.880 --> 3:56:19.720]  We now have full transparency.
[3:56:19.720 --> 3:56:24.540]  We know who worship Satan, who are the demons, who are the medical rapists, who are the baby
[3:56:24.540 --> 3:56:26.500]  killers, who are the tyrants.
[3:56:26.500 --> 3:56:28.460]  There's no longer any question whatsoever.
[3:56:28.460 --> 3:56:32.020]  So we needed this moment, Alex, so that we could process this.
[3:56:32.020 --> 3:56:38.900]  We could mature as a civilization and then move forward under liberty, individual liberty,
[3:56:38.900 --> 3:56:43.860]  and rebuild society, refound America on these principles after the collapse of these principles.
[3:56:43.860 --> 3:56:44.860]  I totally agree.
[3:56:44.860 --> 3:56:45.860]  We all feel that same spirit.
[3:56:45.860 --> 3:56:48.780]  I've got a lot more optimistic just in the last month.
[3:56:48.780 --> 3:56:49.780]  Everybody can feel it.
[3:56:49.780 --> 3:56:50.780]  They can see it.
[3:56:50.780 --> 3:56:51.780]  NaturalNews.com.
[3:56:51.780 --> 3:56:53.740]  Mike, thank you for spending Friday afternoon with us.
[3:56:53.740 --> 3:56:54.740]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:56:54.740 --> 3:56:59.340]  Well, I've had a lot of amazing shows in the last few months, but this is probably the
[3:56:59.340 --> 3:57:02.460]  best one that's going to be re-airing all this weekend.
[3:57:02.460 --> 3:57:05.860]  And then you're going to have that new show that's going to be four hours longer more
[3:57:05.860 --> 3:57:09.740]  of just jam-packed, I mean, information warfare truth.
[3:57:09.740 --> 3:57:10.740]  So join us.
[3:57:10.740 --> 3:57:11.740]  Spread the word.
[3:57:11.740 --> 3:57:12.740]  I love you viewers and listeners.
[3:57:12.740 --> 3:57:13.740]  Love the crew.
[3:57:13.740 --> 3:57:28.140]  I love you viewers and viewers, showers coming up right now at infowars.com.
