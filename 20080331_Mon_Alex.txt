[00:00.000 --> 00:07.440]  mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:07.440 --> 00:30.520]  Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:30.520 --> 00:38.320]  Welcome, my friends. Welcome. It is the final day of March 2008. Tomorrow will be April
[00:38.320 --> 00:44.280]  Fools and, of course, the general public will be fooled, not just by their neighbors, bosses,
[00:44.280 --> 00:50.640]  friends, and families with different practical jokes, but the very central banks that have
[00:50.640 --> 00:56.400]  engineered the financial implosion that is taking place will fool the general public
[00:56.400 --> 01:03.120]  into, quote, accepting their bailout, which will only intensify the severity of the crisis
[01:03.120 --> 01:09.240]  and the monstrous debts that each American will owe in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:09.240 --> 01:15.080]  Now, over $90,000, so the average American currently owes in government expenditures,
[01:15.080 --> 01:22.320]  that's with what is just due currently not what has been committed to. It is in the millions
[01:22.320 --> 01:27.600]  of dollars. If you look at the derivatives and all the leveraging that each person owns, impossible
[01:27.600 --> 01:35.120]  to pay back, slaves of the New World Order, human resources, chattel. Let's just admit
[01:35.120 --> 01:40.480]  what the enemy sees us as, and to a great extent admit what we are so we can set about
[01:40.480 --> 01:50.440]  reversing this course, instead of being arrogant, well-fed cattle. Masses of important news
[01:50.440 --> 01:58.800]  and information for you today, FedEye's Nordic-style nationalization of U.S. banks. We'll break
[01:58.800 --> 02:03.760]  down what that really means. That means governmental power for the private Federal Reserve and
[02:03.760 --> 02:09.120]  the complete takeover of the economy. Bush and Brown in push to deal with crisis, they're
[02:09.120 --> 02:13.840]  going to save us the two of them that both call for world government. Paulson promises
[02:13.840 --> 02:21.160]  financial overhaul, so we'll go over that financial news, and then remember about four
[02:21.160 --> 02:32.480]  months ago, Fox News, British papers came out and said thousands of blonde-haired blue-eyed,
[02:32.480 --> 02:38.600]  basically the Swedish bikini team meets ABBA, have been recruited by Al Qaeda. There is
[02:38.600 --> 02:44.280]  an army of blonde-haired blue-eyed Al Qaeda's, they are everywhere, trust no one, report
[02:44.280 --> 02:52.680]  on everyone, everyone is a terrorist. Well, good old Hayden, the guy that says there's
[02:52.680 --> 02:58.000]  no such thing as a Fourth Amendment, before the Congress he said that they don't need
[02:58.000 --> 03:05.240]  warrants to spy on the American people. Intel sources, Al Qaeda recruiting Westerners, possibly
[03:05.240 --> 03:13.960]  US citizens, new Al Qaeda agents, look Western, new headline out of Reuters today by Hayden,
[03:13.960 --> 03:22.120]  he went on Meet the Press this weekend, and he said Al Qaeda is everywhere. He said Al
[03:22.120 --> 03:29.880]  Qaeda is everywhere, recruiting Westerners, just, it's unbelievable, don't trust your
[03:29.880 --> 03:35.440]  neighbors, don't trust the mailman, don't trust anyone, they're just, it's only trust
[03:35.440 --> 03:40.280]  the government, only trust the face-scanning cameras, only trust the National ID card,
[03:40.280 --> 03:44.960]  never mind the borders are wide open, just totally give up all of your freedoms, we've
[03:44.960 --> 03:50.080]  got to convert to domestic checkpoints, life on the streets will be like life in an airport,
[03:50.080 --> 03:54.080]  we've got to do it now, they're announcing that, it's already in England, they're going
[03:54.080 --> 03:59.400]  to have loudspeakers just announcing look for terrorists, look for bombs, look for weapons,
[03:59.400 --> 04:06.200]  trust your neighbors, spy on everyone, just like in an airport, don't leave bags unattended,
[04:06.200 --> 04:10.400]  here in Austin it happens every week, there'll be a paper box on the side of the highway
[04:10.400 --> 04:14.800]  that blows out of the back of a truck and they'll have the bomb squad and robots will
[04:14.800 --> 04:23.040]  scoot up next to it and blow it up, just just wriggling with fear everyone, land of the
[04:23.040 --> 04:28.600]  cowards home of the slaves, we really are land of the cowards home of the slaves, and
[04:28.600 --> 04:33.240]  if you don't like hearing that, some of you don't like it, I'm sorry we really are the
[04:33.240 --> 04:41.120]  dumbest, the most unhealthy, the most cowardly, the stupidest people on earth, now I'm not
[04:41.120 --> 04:49.880]  saying all of us are, but we have to admit what we've become, there's a paper box on
[04:49.880 --> 04:58.200]  the side of I-35, it is a big idea, a new world order,
[04:58.200 --> 05:04.640]  in the near future, earth is dominated by a powerful world government, it's known as
[05:04.640 --> 05:10.840]  the builder bird, but their objective being world domination, for thousands of years their
[05:10.840 --> 05:16.720]  dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream
[05:16.720 --> 05:25.120]  of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand, for the first time in history, the elites

[07:52.320 --> 07:55.560]  the U.S.
[07:55.560 --> 08:02.120]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues,
[08:02.120 --> 08:23.000]  with Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:23.000 --> 08:30.560]  Reuters today, now I told you three months ago that it was a talking point.
[08:30.560 --> 08:46.000]  We have seen every major host from Chris Matthews to Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity,
[08:46.000 --> 08:54.640]  Joe Scarborough, all of them have gone on their TV shows repeatedly and said that people
[08:54.640 --> 09:00.040]  protesting the government, people going to public events and standing up and asking tough
[09:00.040 --> 09:07.640]  questions, are domestic terrorists need to have the military used against them, need
[09:07.640 --> 09:14.280]  to be taken to secret camps, need to be tortured at secret camps, need to be tasered, need
[09:14.280 --> 09:21.080]  to be beaten, need to be killed.
[09:21.080 --> 09:26.000]  And then they had official Fox reports that they spun out of nothing where a British
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.720]  anti-terror expert said in a British newspaper he believed there could be evidence, it was
[09:32.720 --> 09:38.640]  very sketchy put out to be propaganda, you can always tell the M.O. that they could be,
[09:38.640 --> 09:42.040]  there's evidence that they could be, not that they could be, there's evidence that they
[09:42.040 --> 09:44.040]  could be.
[09:44.040 --> 09:55.200]  And then didn't give the evidence, recruiting thousands of blonde-haired blue-eyed westerners
[09:55.200 --> 09:59.920]  to carry out terror attacks in the West.
[09:59.920 --> 10:03.240]  No evidence totally made up completely.
[10:03.240 --> 10:08.440]  Now they understand that the public, still about 30% at the time of the war, about 55%
[10:08.440 --> 10:16.760]  major polls, believed that Saddam Hussein is bin Laden, they couldn't even tell the difference.
[10:16.760 --> 10:21.280]  I'm not joking for sane, rational people, go pull up the reports.
[10:21.280 --> 10:23.800]  They believed it was the same person.
[10:23.800 --> 10:30.040]  The average individual just drives along thinking about how they want fancier clothes to act
[10:30.040 --> 10:36.360]  cool at work, to look like a peacock, who they want to have sex with, a bigger house,
[10:36.360 --> 10:44.280]  how they want to get chrome on their truck, or how much they hate their boss, or how much
[10:44.280 --> 10:52.520]  they like their secretary, or how do they save enough money to buy a $10,000 bag of
[10:52.520 --> 10:59.880]  golf clubs to look cool on the golf course, and maybe then they'll get the raise.
[10:59.880 --> 11:05.320]  I'll never forget working on the golf course, watching those guys kiss up to their bosses
[11:05.320 --> 11:11.960]  on the golf course, and all the monkey behavior, it makes me so sick, just a nation of plastic
[11:11.960 --> 11:15.480]  fake people, but I'm already digressing.
[11:15.480 --> 11:20.800]  They just have no idea about anything, nothing.
[11:20.800 --> 11:28.880]  Maybe they're little niche at work, and whether it's auto parts or eye surgery.
[11:28.880 --> 11:33.400]  And so they still think, and they still say that Saddam attacked us on 9-11, while at
[11:33.400 --> 11:41.680]  the same time they claim Iran has al-Qaeda and attacked us and is Sunni.
[11:41.680 --> 11:46.920]  No connection to reality, and I'm not joking, I'm not overplaying this when I say it.
[11:46.920 --> 11:50.400]  You need to talk to these people, you need to read their writings, you need to listen
[11:50.400 --> 11:54.520]  to them on talk radio, they really believe this.
[12:25.040 --> 12:37.520]  Well I won't back down, no I won't back down, you can stand me up at the gates of hell,
[12:37.520 --> 12:51.480]  but I won't back down, no I'll stand my ground, won't be turned around, and I'll keep this
[12:51.480 --> 13:01.600]  world from dragging me down, gonna stand my ground, and I won't back down.
[13:01.600 --> 13:07.920]  A little interruption there in our connection with the phone company in downtown Austin where
[13:07.920 --> 13:12.480]  they admit the problem is with the ISDN and the network in Minnesota, that's why we put
[13:12.480 --> 13:15.720]  in backup systems, we'll be switching over to those in the break.
[13:15.720 --> 13:23.360]  Okay, continuing with the news and information that I was covering.
[13:23.360 --> 13:33.280]  So we have massive scripting going on, we have the talking points going out previous
[13:33.280 --> 13:42.560]  to the intelligence agency announcements that yes there might be some truth to thousands
[13:42.560 --> 13:48.600]  of blonde haired blue-eyed al-Qaeda fighters that are just in every city all around us
[13:48.600 --> 13:51.400]  about to attack any minute.
[13:51.400 --> 14:03.280]  And then Fox even showed some training videos of British commandos doing terrorist role
[14:03.280 --> 14:10.840]  playing white guys dressed up as terrorists, and they even show you a training simulation
[14:10.840 --> 14:16.640]  video and then say look there's the white al-Qaeda there.
[14:16.640 --> 14:21.560]  Over almost three years ago they had a big press conference and said ladies and gentlemen
[14:21.560 --> 14:26.640]  al-Qaeda was about to blow up the Liberty Tower in Los Angeles.
[14:26.640 --> 14:35.080]  And then they cut to video from Independence Day of a giant black flying saucer firing
[14:35.080 --> 14:42.320]  an energy beam into the building and blowing it up.
[14:42.320 --> 14:49.120]  But Fox had this up within two minutes of President Bush's press conference announcing
[14:49.120 --> 14:53.280]  how they had thwarted al-Qaeda, within two minutes they had already scrambled and had
[14:53.280 --> 15:01.840]  video of the building from a science fiction movie being blown up.
[15:01.840 --> 15:04.640]  There was just one problem.
[15:04.640 --> 15:09.800]  The building was never called Liberty Tower, is not called Liberty Tower.
[15:09.800 --> 15:15.520]  So how did Fox, even in two minutes, if it was the proper name, scramble and figure out
[15:15.520 --> 15:20.640]  that there was a movie that showed the Liberty Tower being blown up, but then it turned out
[15:20.640 --> 15:24.200]  that wasn't even its name.
[15:24.200 --> 15:27.800]  And then the little controversy erupted and a few national media outlets said why did
[15:27.800 --> 15:31.200]  you call it the Liberty Tower and the White House just said well that's what we like to
[15:31.200 --> 15:32.200]  call it.
[15:32.200 --> 15:38.480]  So they had to have that propaganda image of al-Qaeda wanted to blow up our Liberty Tower.
[15:38.480 --> 15:40.560]  They wanted to blow up our Liberty.
[15:40.560 --> 15:46.400]  Meanwhile, it's the federal government taking our liberties so fast, don't blink because
[15:46.400 --> 15:54.280]  if you do blink, you'll miss that last look at your freedom.
[15:54.280 --> 16:00.720]  I mean this is a massive military buildup bigger than World War II or World War I or
[16:00.720 --> 16:02.680]  Vietnam or any of the wars.
[16:02.680 --> 16:07.320]  I mean it's just a huge hundreds of billions of dollars being spent to turn the U.S. into
[16:07.320 --> 16:14.520]  a giant prison grid with agents and spies and tattletales and every industry being ordered
[16:14.520 --> 16:24.320]  to spy on their customers from major bookstores to libraries to doctors to lawyers to just
[16:24.320 --> 16:31.680]  spooks everywhere, borders wide open, cities burning, rocket attacks on our borders, never
[16:31.680 --> 16:37.000]  makes the news to keep that real quiet.
[16:37.000 --> 16:44.280]  And so it's the same thing here, just all of this scripting.
[16:44.280 --> 16:51.160]  Al-Qaeda recruiting Western fighters, CIA boss.
[16:51.160 --> 16:55.720]  And so the feds bombed the Murrah building because it was a big move against the U.N.
[16:55.720 --> 17:04.760]  and the buildup of the police state.
[17:04.760 --> 17:09.640]  And then they tried to set up that whole apparatus and the FBI put out training manuals saying
[17:09.640 --> 17:15.760]  gun owners, people that talk about the Constitution, frequent references, land rights groups, they're
[17:15.760 --> 17:20.200]  all terrorists and then you go to Marine Corps and Army drills and that's who they're training
[17:20.200 --> 17:23.000]  to fight.
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.600]  They admit it's for U.S. citizens and it's land rights groups.
[17:25.600 --> 17:28.440]  They train mowing farmers and ranchers down.
[17:28.440 --> 17:31.160]  They train to kill men, women and children.
[17:31.160 --> 17:38.320]  It's their main mission, preparing quietly for decades.
[17:38.320 --> 17:45.160]  Al-Qaeda recruiting Western fighters and so now the CIA boss, the criminal, Mr. Hayden
[17:45.160 --> 17:50.520]  who ran the NSA criminally, they had to go into Congress and retroactively, which is
[17:50.520 --> 17:55.200]  by the way illegal and the Constitution says you can't do it, but they did it.
[17:55.200 --> 17:59.560]  It says you can't spy on people without warrants either, but they did it.
[17:59.560 --> 18:06.640]  They admitted they had to pass this retroactively just so he wouldn't go to jail and others
[18:06.640 --> 18:09.320]  wouldn't go to jail.
[18:09.320 --> 18:17.840]  So this criminal, this felon now runs the CIA and all the atrocities they're engaged
[18:17.840 --> 18:26.280]  in and he comes out and says, yep, they're recruiting people and they're just, they're
[18:26.280 --> 18:27.280]  everywhere.
[18:27.280 --> 18:28.280]  They're going to get you any minute.
[18:28.280 --> 18:32.520]  Al-Qaeda recruiting Western fighters, CIA boss, Al-Qaeda's training fighters that look
[18:32.520 --> 18:37.480]  Western could easily cross U.S. borders without attracting attention, CIA director Michael
[18:37.480 --> 18:38.760]  Hayden said on Sunday.
[18:38.760 --> 18:43.480]  Let's go back to the Fox News Pentagon piece right now and we'll play the rest after the
[18:43.480 --> 18:44.480]  break.
[18:44.480 --> 18:45.480]  Here it is.
[18:45.480 --> 18:50.160]  Have you heard about this new thing going on in Great Britain that Al-Qaeda wrote not
[18:50.160 --> 18:56.080]  all these Britons essentially, 1400 strong apparently in a new, what's being called a
[18:56.080 --> 19:02.400]  new white Al-Qaeda army, tougher to detect potentially, because they're not Muslims.
[19:02.400 --> 19:06.520]  They look just like regular British people, they're converts.
[19:06.520 --> 19:11.120]  Also we're going to talk more about the controversial subject regarding Al-Qaeda.
[19:11.120 --> 19:14.040]  Are they recruiting a white army now in Great Britain?
[19:14.040 --> 19:17.200]  Some people say it's 1400 people strong and why is that important because this is what
[19:17.200 --> 19:18.200]  we've always talked about.
[19:18.200 --> 19:20.080]  We're going to come back and finish the rest of it.
[19:20.080 --> 19:25.360]  So see, they build up this massive system, one in ten college graduates for Homeland
[19:25.360 --> 19:27.000]  Security related fields.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.360]  They got to have jobs.
[19:28.360 --> 19:29.880]  There is no Al-Qaeda.
[19:29.880 --> 19:32.000]  There is no real threat.
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.680]  And so they've got to flip it now.
[19:35.680 --> 19:40.440]  And by the way, here it is in the Associated Press, Mukasey, Attorney General, terrorist
[19:40.440 --> 19:46.160]  behind copyright violations, copyright violations, terrorism.
[19:46.160 --> 19:50.560]  See all white collars, civil stuff is now terrorist.
[19:50.560 --> 19:55.600]  Mestemeanor, civil, just terrorist everywhere.
[19:55.600 --> 19:58.280]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[19:58.280 --> 20:03.120]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods you are not correctly attacking the
[20:03.120 --> 20:07.760]  cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[20:07.760 --> 20:13.160]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning and the poisoning of your entire system are
[20:13.160 --> 20:15.600]  totally unnecessary?
[20:15.600 --> 20:21.760]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die, with laced med inks, patented methodology.

[20:54.680 --> 20:58.920]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[20:58.920 --> 21:03.400]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[21:03.400 --> 21:05.920]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[21:05.920 --> 21:09.440]  Could their objective be world domination?
[21:09.440 --> 21:12.600]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[21:12.600 --> 21:18.520]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[21:18.520 --> 21:22.960]  of humanity is at hand.
[21:22.960 --> 21:28.400]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[21:32.320 --> 21:35.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[21:35.000 --> 21:36.000]  Most people have no idea.
[21:36.000 --> 21:37.000]  They're not after money.
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  They have all the money they need.
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  They're after power.

[22:55.560 --> 22:59.240]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[22:59.240 --> 23:01.640]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[23:01.640 --> 23:04.720]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[23:04.720 --> 23:08.960]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[23:08.960 --> 23:10.480]  World Order master plan.
[23:10.480 --> 23:14.780]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[23:14.780 --> 23:19.960]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[23:51.880 --> 23:52.880]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[23:52.880 --> 24:06.280]  All right, I'm going to finish up with this Pentagon propaganda, and that's what it is
[24:06.280 --> 24:08.480]  taxpayer paid for.
[24:08.480 --> 24:11.040]  Fox is an organ of the private banks that own our government.
[24:11.040 --> 24:15.520]  I'm going to be getting into the new financial bailout, the latest military news.
[24:15.520 --> 24:19.360]  We're going to get into Gary Hart being confronted by We Are Changed, Colorado, play some of
[24:19.360 --> 24:20.360]  that in the third hour.
[24:20.360 --> 24:26.400]  In the second hour, we're going to be breaking down the illegal DNA databases that everyone
[24:26.400 --> 24:32.400]  has put in at birth, just to, again, illustrate the total criminality, and the organization
[24:32.400 --> 24:33.400]  of the government.
[24:33.400 --> 24:34.400]  This is all organized.
[24:34.400 --> 24:37.240]  This isn't haphazard or, oh, they accidentally did it.
[24:37.240 --> 24:42.600]  This is going on for decades.
[24:42.600 --> 24:48.760]  But understand, just as I told you they would do, they're building this giant mechanism
[24:48.760 --> 24:53.400]  to track everything you do, trace everything you do, micromanage you, turn your national
[24:53.400 --> 24:56.400]  ID card off.
[24:56.400 --> 25:01.240]  Your pharmacist, your doctor, your lawyer, school teachers, everyone spying, publicly
[25:01.240 --> 25:07.880]  truck drivers, neighbors, neighborhood tattletale squads recruiting the high schoolers.
[25:07.880 --> 25:14.760]  I mean, it's massive hiring the former head of the Stozy to train the feds how to do this,
[25:14.760 --> 25:16.280]  hiring the former head of the KGB.
[25:16.280 --> 25:29.720]  I mean, they're really doing it, going for broke, and always Afghanistan.
[25:29.720 --> 25:31.480]  It's to kill the Middle Easterners.
[25:31.480 --> 25:35.720]  Don't tell them that they're not Middle Easterners, Afghanistan and the Middle East boys.
[25:35.720 --> 25:39.360]  It's all for you.
[25:39.360 --> 25:40.360]  It's all for you.
[25:40.360 --> 25:44.160]  So when they take your ranch and you say no, they can bring the SWAT team up and burn your
[25:44.160 --> 25:49.720]  house down with you in it.
[25:49.720 --> 25:52.160]  And you know what they're going to say?
[25:52.160 --> 25:56.200]  You know what they're going to do?
[25:56.200 --> 26:03.360]  You know what they're going to push?
[26:03.360 --> 26:10.520]  They're just going to come right in there and burn your house down, burn your farm down.
[26:10.520 --> 26:16.960]  And they're going to announce on the news that they were fighting al-Qaeda, but it's
[26:16.960 --> 26:21.720]  all about you are al-Qaeda.
[26:21.720 --> 26:25.320]  You are the terrorist.
[26:25.320 --> 26:31.400]  You go in the criminal database, a million Americans in the terrorist database, head
[26:31.400 --> 26:36.880]  marshals resigning, going public, telling the Denver Post that they're ordered to put
[26:36.880 --> 26:44.840]  families in it for no reason, just to create the image of a false threat.
[26:44.840 --> 26:50.120]  You my friends, you the American people are the terrorist.
[26:50.120 --> 26:52.520]  Let's finish up with this Fox News clip.
[26:52.520 --> 26:58.400]  Also, we're going to talk more about the controversial subject regarding al-Qaeda.
[26:58.400 --> 27:01.280]  Are they recruiting a white army now in Great Britain?
[27:01.280 --> 27:03.320]  Some people say it's 1,400 people strong.
[27:03.320 --> 27:04.320]  Why is that important?
[27:04.320 --> 27:09.120]  Because this is what we've always talked about, that if you have people in one country transplaining
[27:09.120 --> 27:14.600]  to another religion and they maybe aren't exactly what you think they are, that can be more
[27:14.600 --> 27:15.600]  difficult to fight.
[27:15.600 --> 27:19.400]  Yeah, they're converting them in prison to kill us.
[27:19.400 --> 27:20.400]  To kill us.
[27:20.400 --> 27:21.400]  Yeah.
[27:21.400 --> 27:22.400]  Okay, great.
[27:22.400 --> 27:23.400]  Now, here's Mr. Happyburn kill me.
[27:23.400 --> 27:24.880]  I'm always happy because Mike Baker's here.
[27:24.880 --> 27:28.840]  There's word that al-Qaeda is building up a white terror army of up to 1,500 operatives
[27:28.840 --> 27:29.960]  in the U.K.
[27:29.960 --> 27:31.240]  How soon could they strike us?
[27:31.240 --> 27:35.280]  Here, and would they be trying to do something similar using convicted criminals?
[27:35.280 --> 27:39.080]  Mike Baker served for more than 15 years as a covert operations officer until I blew
[27:39.080 --> 27:40.080]  his cover.
[27:40.080 --> 27:41.080]  He's here in studio.
[27:41.080 --> 27:42.080]  Mike, how?
[27:42.080 --> 27:43.080]  Thanks for that, by the way.
[27:43.080 --> 27:44.920]  Yeah, I owe you a favor.
[27:44.920 --> 27:48.520]  So Mike, I forced you out of the business, so tell me, pretend you're back in.
[27:48.520 --> 27:49.520]  Is this a big deal?
[27:49.520 --> 27:51.640]  It is a big deal, in a sense.
[27:51.640 --> 27:56.080]  This is an area where al-Qaeda and the CIA and other intel services around the country
[27:56.080 --> 27:57.720]  actually have something in common.
[27:57.720 --> 28:01.480]  We're all looking for the same thing, which is individuals who can blend in.
[28:01.480 --> 28:05.520]  From our side, we're looking for people, obviously, who can penetrate al-Qaeda.
[28:05.520 --> 28:11.640]  Most agency officers, most officers from other liaison services don't blend in to al-Qaeda.
[28:11.640 --> 28:15.000]  So we're looking for people who we can fit into there as penetrations.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.200]  Al-Qaeda on the other side of the fence, they're doing the same thing.
[28:17.200 --> 28:21.640]  I mean, obviously, if they could recruit a Scandinavian, that's the holy grail for them.
[28:21.640 --> 28:24.720]  They need people who can move around freely and do their bidding.
[28:24.720 --> 28:28.640]  The converted, people who convert Islam, sometimes are more militant than those who
[28:28.640 --> 28:29.640]  were born that way.
[28:29.640 --> 28:30.640]  Correct?
[28:30.640 --> 28:33.400]  And they always go to prisons, too, to get the recruits.
[28:33.400 --> 28:34.400]  Right.
[28:34.400 --> 28:37.080]  You can argue that converts are always a little bit more zealous in terms of their religious
[28:37.080 --> 28:38.080]  fervor.
[28:38.080 --> 28:44.920]  But part of the problem with al-Qaeda is that to go into a prison and try to recruit individuals,
[28:44.920 --> 28:46.760]  that person's already tainted, what they really need.
[28:46.760 --> 28:52.800]  They need people who haven't run afoul of law enforcement in the past, in a sense.
[28:52.800 --> 28:58.800]  And then it goes on and on that it is, just like the FBI training manual say, white male
[28:58.800 --> 29:05.000]  who locks his desk, a lot of times it says we're in management positions.
[29:05.000 --> 29:06.160]  It says we're quiet.
[29:06.160 --> 29:11.800]  We keep to ourselves, they're evil white males, and they're al-Qaeda.
[29:11.800 --> 29:14.240]  They're everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[29:14.240 --> 29:17.040]  The guy pumping your gas, al-Qaeda.
[29:17.040 --> 29:20.160]  That's school teacher, al-Qaeda.
[29:20.160 --> 29:24.520]  In fact, the FBI manual says that priest, al-Qaeda.
[29:24.520 --> 29:28.280]  It says the Caucasian woman pushing the baby carriage, al-Qaeda.
[29:28.280 --> 29:30.280]  That's a quote.
[29:30.280 --> 29:31.280]  Al-Qaeda.
[29:31.280 --> 29:32.280]  Everywhere.
[29:32.280 --> 29:34.560]  They're just, they're everywhere.
[29:34.560 --> 29:37.240]  Take all my rights away, government.
[29:37.240 --> 29:39.160]  Take all my freedoms.
[29:39.160 --> 29:44.520]  Put a bracelet around me with a taser, keep me safe, they're everywhere.
[29:44.520 --> 29:45.800]  We're on the march.
[29:45.800 --> 29:48.240]  The empire's on the run.
[29:48.240 --> 29:54.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:54.960 --> 29:58.440]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[29:58.440 --> 30:02.320]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[30:02.320 --> 30:03.920]  than when drinking the water?
[30:03.920 --> 30:07.760]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[30:07.760 --> 30:08.920]  into the skin.
[30:08.920 --> 30:13.600]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to
[30:13.600 --> 30:19.120]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold,
[30:19.120 --> 30:20.440]  algae, and fungus.
[30:20.440 --> 30:25.320]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever
[30:25.320 --> 30:26.320]  comes first.
[30:26.320 --> 30:30.440]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[30:30.440 --> 30:32.520]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[30:32.520 --> 30:33.520]  What about you?

[32:55.800 --> 33:02.120]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show, because there's
[33:02.120 --> 33:29.920]  a war on for your mind.
[33:29.920 --> 33:38.920]  Okay, we're back live here, all of us American Al-Qaeda, Intel sources, Al-Qaeda recruiting
[33:38.920 --> 33:45.360]  Westerners, possibly US citizens, and by the time Fox News gets it, it is transmuted
[33:45.360 --> 33:52.720]  into, they are everywhere, we're all dead, Hayden while he was on, meet the press, declined
[33:52.720 --> 33:56.880]  to comment directly on the post article saying American Al-Qaeda is under every bed, but
[33:56.880 --> 34:02.160]  he stressed that the, it's very sensitive, the situation along the Afghan-Pakistan border
[34:02.160 --> 34:06.080]  presents a clear and present danger to Afghanistan, to Pakistan, to the West in general and the
[34:06.080 --> 34:09.000]  United States particular Hayden said.
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.800]  Now it's been in the BBC, it's been in the one in telegraph, it's been all over foreign
[34:12.800 --> 34:20.200]  news, that in the months before 9-11, the CIA was visiting Ben Laden, that they also
[34:20.200 --> 34:25.840]  visited him when he was in Dubai having kidney work done at a dialysis center, and it is
[34:25.840 --> 34:32.480]  a fact, it was a bignam Brzezinski likes to brag, he wrote in his latest book that what
[34:32.480 --> 34:35.560]  we'd already told you, because it had been released and declassified, but it had never
[34:35.560 --> 34:40.200]  really been national attention, but now it's admitted by the guy that ran it, in 79, six
[34:40.200 --> 34:45.200]  months before the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, the people running our government, I don't
[34:45.200 --> 34:49.960]  even want to say the US, I'm even programmed where I keep using the term us, the US, not
[34:49.960 --> 34:54.920]  the US, criminal elements that control and use our government, and use our tax money
[34:54.920 --> 35:01.000]  and our energies to carry out evil, launched a tax into several of the Russian republics
[35:01.000 --> 35:09.800]  bordering Afghanistan, and so the Russians then poured in to Afghanistan and did engage
[35:09.800 --> 35:14.280]  in a lot of slaughter and very oppressive activities, similar to what our government's
[35:14.280 --> 35:18.720]  doing, and it's bad when both sides do it.
[35:18.720 --> 35:22.600]  And the rest is history, you know, we're told that US involvement didn't start until
[35:22.600 --> 35:26.200]  the mid-80s and that has now been proven to be a complete fraud, you see something like
[35:26.200 --> 35:33.080]  Charlie Wilson's war, it is a fairy tale, you might as well go see a Disney movie like
[35:33.080 --> 35:39.440]  Fantasia, it has more reality in it than that movie Charlie Wilson's war with Tom Hanks,
[35:39.440 --> 35:43.560]  but it makes Americans feel good.
[35:43.560 --> 35:54.280]  Al-Qaeda means the base in Arabic, and it is the name of the CIA computer program and
[35:54.280 --> 36:06.800]  file section, basically the operation, and our government with Saudi Arabia created Al-Qaeda,
[36:06.800 --> 36:12.160]  Saudi Arabia matched the funds that the US gave, Israel put in large amounts of armaments
[36:12.160 --> 36:22.440]  and money as well, and Al-Qaeda is a creation of British, US, Israeli and Pakistani intelligence.
[36:22.440 --> 36:28.600]  In exchange the US of course gave Pakistan the bomb to menace India, the British have
[36:28.600 --> 36:35.520]  not liked India since the Indians, the peaceful Indians, our friends, their friends with the
[36:35.520 --> 36:43.840]  US doesn't matter, they must be destroyed by the little buddies in Pakistan, it's just
[36:43.840 --> 36:50.160]  so disgusting, but you try to explain the complex nuances of the geopolitical actions
[36:50.160 --> 36:55.360]  to the average American who literally cannot find the US on a map, and there's just no
[36:55.360 --> 36:59.920]  point, it's like talking to Helen Keller.
[36:59.920 --> 37:07.960]  Left dumb and blind cannot understand a single word you say to them, not that they're mentally
[37:07.960 --> 37:14.820]  retarded, they are pre-programmed, where it just sounds like gibberish right now to them.
[37:14.820 --> 37:20.520]  You tell them that Bush publicly for four years has been commanding Al-Qaeda in Eastern
[37:20.520 --> 37:25.760]  Iraq into Western Iran, that the White House last year even put a press release out about
[37:25.760 --> 37:32.480]  it, admitting that number three in Al-Qaeda is commanding the US-backed forces against
[37:32.480 --> 37:38.080]  the Shiite Iran, and they will laugh at you, I've gotten the emails, I've gotten calls,
[37:38.080 --> 37:42.760]  where they're just going, I can't believe you make stuff up like that, you're nuts man,
[37:42.760 --> 37:50.360]  and I'm like, no, no, it's all admitted, they go, sure it is, I mean what's wrong with you,
[37:50.360 --> 37:57.560]  do you like being stupid, and I don't enjoy in some sardonic fashion sitting up here calling
[37:57.560 --> 38:01.280]  you stupid, I'm not talking about our main listeners, I'm talking about dumbbell liberals
[38:01.280 --> 38:12.040]  and dumbbell conservatives, mainline people, this isn't funny, it isn't funny, the people
[38:12.040 --> 38:16.960]  running our government flew those planes into buildings, they're dangerous, fighting them,
[38:16.960 --> 38:23.240]  freaking out against them, isn't funny, it's dangerous, I have to live with this every day,
[38:23.240 --> 38:31.280]  but I have to do it because it's my mission, it's my duty, they must be opposed, these
[38:31.280 --> 38:39.800]  are very ruthless, wicked people, and they think you're stupid, they get up on Rush Limbaugh
[38:39.800 --> 38:46.920]  and Sean Hannity and Michael Savage and John McCain and Fox News and they say every day,
[38:46.920 --> 38:53.840]  Iran is al-Qaeda, Iran is al-Qaeda, Iran is al-Qaeda, Iran is al-Qaeda, Iran is al-Qaeda,
[38:53.840 --> 39:00.800]  they are not, even if you believe al-Qaeda is real, and you believe that fairytale, even
[39:00.800 --> 39:06.280]  if you believe the official line, they come out of Saudi Arabia and it's the warring sect
[39:06.280 --> 39:12.240]  against the Shiites, and I know I keep talking about it, I just can't believe the public
[39:12.240 --> 39:24.920]  doesn't understand this, it's dangerous to be this ignorant.
[39:24.920 --> 39:29.760]  So now they're going to be 10 times more paranoid at the TSA at the airports and the cops when
[39:29.760 --> 39:32.400]  they pull you over and they're giving them briefings all over the country the last few
[39:32.400 --> 39:37.000]  months of the police, telling them look for al-Qaeda, anyone and everyone can be al-Qaeda,
[39:37.000 --> 39:43.120]  and it just adds to all the insane paranoia and you see the cops creeping around everywhere,
[39:43.120 --> 39:45.040]  scared to death, it's just unbelievable.
[39:45.040 --> 39:50.280]  Meanwhile, their number one cause of death is automobile accidents and being hit by cars
[39:50.280 --> 39:53.560]  hanging their butts out in the middle of the highway, writing tickets, but see the government
[39:53.560 --> 39:58.880]  doesn't tell them to be scared of that and doesn't give them briefings on that and I've
[39:58.880 --> 40:03.120]  watched all these videos of police training seminars in these big classrooms and the way
[40:03.120 --> 40:07.600]  they talk to the cops is like their two year olds and about how we're going to keep you
[40:07.600 --> 40:13.640]  safe and how we're a brotherhood and it's all like a third grade level and the cops
[40:13.640 --> 40:19.160]  just suck it up like they're in a brotherhood, they're in a club, oh they're being given
[40:19.160 --> 40:28.680]  the inside scoop, if you were being given the inside scoop they'd tell you don't give
[40:28.680 --> 40:37.320]  your kids the mercury shots, the vaccines, don't drink fluoride water, don't eat and
[40:37.320 --> 40:44.040]  drink corn syrup, don't eat GMO food if the globalists cared about you, they tell you
[40:44.040 --> 40:49.680]  don't use cell phones, they don't care about you, the whole art of the military, the whole
[40:49.680 --> 40:56.760]  art of the police system is to control you and to manipulate you and to play you off
[40:56.760 --> 41:05.120]  against us, just like a leader of a gang, whether it's the Crips, the Bloods, the Vatos, it
[41:05.120 --> 41:13.960]  doesn't matter, the Latin Kings, it's all about manipulating you in gang culture and
[41:13.960 --> 41:17.840]  in the more abusive you get towards us, the more the people hate you and then they say
[41:17.840 --> 41:27.280]  see it's us against them, they hate you, only your brothers care about you, hey man they
[41:27.280 --> 41:32.280]  don't like you, they don't like the family, they don't like the gang, they don't like
[41:32.280 --> 41:44.800]  what we become brother, it's all you got is your family, it's all you got now, and that's
[41:44.800 --> 41:49.240]  how it works, they play you like a fiddle, just like they play the dumb down public.
[41:49.240 --> 41:56.360]  Meanwhile, Mukase, Attorney General Mukase says that they have to treat copyright violation
[41:56.360 --> 42:06.840]  as terrorism not just as civil or criminal because it's aiding terrorists, see, general
[42:06.840 --> 42:12.760]  crimes in Section 802, it's been like this for six years, it says in Section 802 any
[42:12.760 --> 42:19.240]  action that endangers human life, it's a violation of any federal or state law, misdemeanor.
[42:19.240 --> 42:23.760]  Now they're expanding that, Mukase, terrorists behind copyright violations, now that Michael
[42:23.760 --> 42:29.400]  Mukase is firmly installed as Attorney General, we begin to get a whiff of his agenda as directed
[42:29.400 --> 42:33.880]  by the bankers and their neocon collaborators from the Associated Press, remarks of Silicon
[42:33.880 --> 42:38.880]  Valley executives at the Tech Museum of Innovation, Mukase said the economy and national security
[42:38.880 --> 42:43.040]  in the United States are increasingly threatened by violations involving copyright software
[42:43.040 --> 42:49.120]  code, patented innovations and trademark properties, so terror groups are taking their
[42:49.120 --> 42:54.360]  cues from organized crime increasingly, funding their operations from counterfeit and piracy
[42:54.360 --> 42:58.640]  and it goes on to say they've got to treat any copyright violations terrorism, go read
[42:58.640 --> 43:00.720]  it for yourself.
[43:00.720 --> 43:10.120]  So see they're shifting it all over now, just as they always plan to do, here's one out
[43:10.120 --> 43:16.960]  of USA Today, notice how they phrase it and sell it and term it, USA Today is the worst,
[43:16.960 --> 43:21.920]  they make all their big propaganda announcements there, I've noticed, of like hey guess what,
[43:21.920 --> 43:26.680]  the government reads everything you do in your bank account every day, didn't exist ten
[43:26.680 --> 43:31.120]  years ago when we told you but now they announce it there last week and they tell you why it's
[43:31.120 --> 43:34.600]  good and keeps you safe from al-Qaeda, yeah we look at everybody's bank accounts with
[43:34.600 --> 43:37.320]  no warrant but it's freedom.
[43:37.320 --> 43:43.560]  Well here's this week's announcements, civilians handle minor duties for strapped police, about
[43:43.560 --> 43:47.720]  twelve years ago they started suddenly having the police, you'd be at a demonstration or
[43:47.720 --> 43:53.080]  at any event and they'd say, stand back civilians, a civilian means one of the constitution
[43:53.080 --> 43:58.160]  bill of rights, when they start calling everyone civilians that's because you're under military
[43:58.160 --> 44:03.880]  rule, now mayors call us civilians, see they're part of the military, now the police train
[44:03.880 --> 44:10.200]  with the military, hey police you're under civilian law too, but see now we're not under
[44:10.200 --> 44:17.120]  the executive orders of last year PDD 51, John Warner Defense Authorization Act, we're
[44:17.120 --> 44:26.160]  being eased into martial law, they're just slowly turning the dial up, but see they'll
[44:26.160 --> 44:31.840]  come out and say, hey you're gonna have tattletail squads and spies everywhere now, which they've
[44:31.840 --> 44:36.680]  already had for decades, or what's in the Philadelphia Daily News a few years ago about
[44:36.680 --> 44:41.080]  where they recruited the juniors and gave them M16s and had them do warrant service
[44:41.080 --> 44:48.080]  and gun confiscation drills, no no they sell it like, oh it's to help, you can't get the
[44:48.080 --> 44:52.320]  cops to your house when it gets robbed, it's because there's not enough officers, no they've
[44:52.320 --> 44:57.320]  just gone from 300,000 cops to 2 million in the last 15 years, there's not enough cops,
[44:57.320 --> 45:03.000]  there's more cops than ever, back when there was hardly any police, 50, 60 years ago though
[45:03.000 --> 45:08.280]  they took all crime very seriously, and crime you got the book thrown at you, but see now
[45:08.280 --> 45:12.880]  they don't mess with real criminals, they just throw the book at nonviolent people, and
[45:12.880 --> 45:17.600]  then now the general public are all being made criminals.
[45:17.600 --> 45:22.040]  Civilians handle minor duties for strapped police, see how that one line, just every
[45:22.040 --> 45:28.800]  word is propaganda, weren't, we're all civilians, police included, handle minor duties for strapped
[45:28.800 --> 45:32.880]  police, and then the minor duties are your house being robbed, listen to this, departments
[45:32.880 --> 45:38.800]  under budget, burdens higher outside help, facing tighter budgets, law enforcement agencies
[45:38.800 --> 45:45.040]  across the country are increasingly turning to civilians to respond to some calls that
[45:45.040 --> 45:50.200]  sworn officers and deputies are usually responsible for, that means people calling 911 to report
[45:50.200 --> 45:56.160]  a traffic accident, a burglarized home or stolen car may be greeted by a civilian in
[45:56.160 --> 46:01.600]  a polo shirt instead of a gun at toting officer, now see that sounds reasonable, this is really
[46:01.600 --> 46:07.320]  all about the spy corps, and see you think 2 million cops is bad, they're talking about
[46:07.320 --> 46:17.360]  10 million by 2015, 10 million just everywhere, and they're gonna find stuff to report on,
[46:17.360 --> 46:22.720]  they're gonna find stuff, they're gonna find to justify their job, just like the federal
[46:22.720 --> 46:27.720]  marshals are ordered, put innocent people, thousands a month being added on the terror
[46:27.720 --> 46:36.840]  list for the rest of their lives, the new economy is gonna be prisons, checkpoints,
[46:36.840 --> 46:40.520]  your daughter's gonna bring guys home in black uniforms, you're gonna have to be quiet and
[46:40.520 --> 46:44.160]  not even tell her you don't like them or shoot your mouth off to them, or they'll send you
[46:44.160 --> 46:49.720]  to prison, that's how it worked in Germany and Russia, you're not even gonna be able
[46:49.720 --> 46:56.160]  to talk back to them, you understand they're gonna rule, people with no skills, no nothing,
[46:56.160 --> 47:08.040]  no background, no work, no nothing, they just go get a black uniform and they are God.
[47:08.040 --> 47:17.400]  Just as Dr. Roberts told you on the show last week, this is the new system, that means people
[47:17.400 --> 47:21.920]  calling 911 report traffic action, a burglarized home or stolen car may be greeted by a civilian
[47:21.920 --> 47:25.120]  in a polo shirt, and who are they, they work in the banks, they work in the hospitals,
[47:25.120 --> 47:30.760]  they get off on their little badges, they have, they love it, they love being toadies
[47:30.760 --> 47:36.000]  of the Stasi system, they didn't hire the former head of the Stasi, six years ago, Marcus
[47:36.000 --> 47:42.880]  Wolfe had just died last year, the former head of the Stasi, the East German police,
[47:42.880 --> 47:48.240]  they didn't hire them to play paddy cake, it hasn't been universally adopted throughout
[47:48.240 --> 47:52.840]  the country, but most areas have at least thought about the alternative and are more
[47:52.840 --> 47:57.720]  open to it now because of the economy, said Richard Bradley, President of Polo Alto, California
[47:57.720 --> 48:02.800]  based matrix consulting group that has worked with more than 250 law enforcement agencies.
[48:02.800 --> 48:07.000]  The idea of using civilians who require less training and are less expensive than sworn
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.920]  officers is responsible to minor police calls and has been around since the 1980s, and we
[48:11.920 --> 48:15.520]  have all these videos, I sent them to John a few weeks ago, I didn't play him, where
[48:15.520 --> 48:21.240]  it shows auxiliary cops with tasers, with guns, not supposed to in small towns, pulling
[48:21.240 --> 48:26.680]  people out of cars, running checkpoints, and it's the exact person that shouldn't be a
[48:26.680 --> 48:31.040]  cop, you know who becomes a cop now, the control freak, the bully from high school, the person
[48:31.040 --> 48:37.680]  who can't get a girl, the person who wants that power, I saw this footage out of Portland
[48:37.680 --> 48:41.320]  where the cops are randomly going down the street demanding people's IDs, so somebody
[48:41.320 --> 48:45.840]  starts videotaping it with their camera phone, they're about 50 feet back and the cop walks
[48:45.840 --> 48:54.640]  over, all muscle bound, about three feet tall, and he walks over a little Napoleon and he
[48:54.640 --> 48:59.520]  just says, you're not allowed to tape me, you're getting audio, give me that camera
[48:59.520 --> 49:04.360]  and grabs it, and of course then tried to, and you can type into Google, man arrested
[49:04.360 --> 49:08.200]  for videotaping police, they come to people's houses now and arrest them, and it doesn't
[49:08.200 --> 49:13.920]  matter if the courts say that there's no reasonable expectation of privacy, doesn't matter if there's
[49:13.920 --> 49:18.520]  no law, they still charge you with wiretapping and usually go to jail, because the juries
[49:18.520 --> 49:25.080]  are a bunch of bootlicking toties too, just it's all about, that's who they put on there,
[49:25.080 --> 49:29.600]  the husbands and wives of the police and the prosecutors and the good old boys, and they
[49:29.600 --> 49:34.640]  just sit in there all day sending innocent people to jail, they just love toting, they
[49:34.640 --> 49:40.160]  love corruption, they love kissing up to uniforms, they love killing this country, and don't
[49:40.160 --> 49:44.080]  worry you're going to enable the bankers to do everything they want to do, don't worry
[49:44.080 --> 49:49.440]  you're going to enable them to have their way, you know President Bush throughout the
[49:49.440 --> 49:58.800]  opening pitch at the Atlanta Braves stadium and he was universally booed, now a few years
[49:58.800 --> 50:09.920]  ago when he would get booed, Fox and others were caught fading up cheers over it, and
[50:09.920 --> 50:14.720]  I do have the original ESPN feed, ESPN it appears put some kind of delay in because you can
[50:14.720 --> 50:18.560]  hear the tape jump and it cuts to something else, but they messed up, some of the booing
[50:18.560 --> 50:28.280]  went through, then they fade cheering over it, but see that's the good news, you may
[50:28.280 --> 50:34.520]  hire 10 million scum suckers who will destroy this country, but the rest of us know the
[50:34.520 --> 50:41.080]  score now and we're going to stand up against you, and so we'll come back, play this, play

[53:48.560 --> 53:50.120]  Shank, someone who cares.
[53:50.120 --> 54:05.080]  Yeah, just a correction, it was the nationals, I was reading the AP headline here and it says
[54:05.080 --> 54:10.400]  that the Washington Braves tried to get him to wear a braves jacket and he said, oh no,
[54:10.400 --> 54:16.440]  they might boo me, that's the quote and then he went out wearing a nationals jacket and
[54:16.440 --> 54:21.720]  they boo him and then the announcer just kisses up and just says, oh that's the best
[54:21.720 --> 54:27.440]  throw by any president ever, he's God, we ought to dig up that Fox News when we hear
[54:27.440 --> 54:31.160]  the booing and they just fade it down and then fade up cheering and they go, they love
[54:31.160 --> 54:36.520]  him, it's like in martial law, I have that clip from his second inauguration where they're
[54:36.520 --> 54:44.200]  saying, cheer for him, let him know that you love America, do you see the propaganda in
[54:44.200 --> 54:48.800]  that, it's saying Bush is America, you love America don't you, cheer for him as hundreds
[54:48.800 --> 54:54.160]  of thousands booed and screamed and spit, but the national news cut back to wide shot
[54:54.160 --> 55:00.160]  and said, they love him, I have that martial law, it's like something out of a dystopic
[55:00.160 --> 55:05.320]  science fiction movie made 50 years ago where the emperor is driving through and everyone's
[55:05.320 --> 55:13.400]  booing and then the announcer is going, they love him, but it isn't about him, he's only
[55:13.400 --> 55:17.520]  a puppet, it's just an example of the propaganda, Bush gets first pitch, first look, president
[55:17.520 --> 55:21.560]  Bush had enough to worry about like not flubbing the first pitch in front of a crown that might
[55:21.560 --> 55:25.640]  not exactly be his biggest fans anyway, so before the game when a couple of Atlanta Braves
[55:25.640 --> 55:29.520]  gave him a team jersey and suggested he wear it to throw out the first pitch at the nationals
[55:29.520 --> 55:34.800]  park, Bush laughed, oh no thanks guys, might as well put a sign on me that says booming,
[55:34.800 --> 55:38.880]  I'm not going to give them any excuses Bush said, the 40,000 plus people gathering at
[55:38.880 --> 55:45.200]  the opening of Washington's gleaming baseball stadium, and then it says that he went out
[55:45.200 --> 55:54.880]  and was massively booed, let's go ahead and play that, there's the president, the 43rd
[55:54.880 --> 56:00.200]  president of the United States, George W. Bush, he'll be throwing the first pitch out
[56:00.200 --> 56:05.480]  to Manny Atta, and here's the announcement by Jerome Harusker, manager of the Washington
[56:05.480 --> 56:19.400]  Nationals, Manny Atta, and managing principal owner of the Washington Nationals, Ted Lerner,
[56:19.400 --> 56:24.480]  and here to throw out the inaugural pitch at nationals park to mark a new era of Washington
[56:24.480 --> 56:36.240]  baseball, the president of the United States, okay, that's enough.
[56:36.240 --> 56:40.280]  Now let's play Carl Rove, in fact I gave you the time code John, did you see where I told
[56:40.280 --> 56:45.120]  you to play it from, oh darn it, we're not going to be able to play it this time though,
[56:45.120 --> 56:50.240]  I did send it in the IM, pull it up, I think it, no, you know what, from memory, it's 130
[56:50.240 --> 56:54.880]  again, if not you'll get a big Carl Rove question beforehand, this is Carl Rove with
[56:54.880 --> 57:03.560]  people protesting him and the crowd is chanting, Tase him, Tase him, Tase him, here it is.
[57:03.560 --> 57:09.320]  Well Senator Obama says, sounds pretty good, the only problem is, is he fails to back it
[57:09.320 --> 57:10.800]  up with his actions in Congress.
[57:10.800 --> 57:15.000]  Well my question for you tonight is, why is it that you think you evoke such a visceral
[57:15.000 --> 57:19.240]  reaction in many of your detractors, we've seen tonight's people here at Cusumigal.
[57:19.240 --> 57:23.920]  It's not it, just forget it, yeah, I mean these clips are like 10, 20 minutes long,
[57:23.920 --> 57:30.840]  so we have to have the exact time code to be able to play it for you, it's up at infowars.com
[57:30.840 --> 57:36.640]  and prisonplanet.com, if you want to see it, we'll try to find the exact spot and play
[57:36.640 --> 57:49.200]  it for you after this quick break, I, it just blows me away that you have the crowd chanting
[57:49.200 --> 57:53.840]  Tase him, Tase him, Tase them, Tase them.
[57:53.840 --> 57:57.120]  Remember the fellow that just stood up and said, hey what about Scullin' Bones, you're
[57:57.120 --> 58:02.760]  in it with Bush and then they grab him, tackle him, he's got his hands out, he's not even
[58:02.760 --> 58:06.760]  resisting, he's got his hands up and he says, please don't Tase me and the officers just
[58:06.760 --> 58:09.600]  go ehhh and just repeatedly Tase him.
[58:09.600 --> 58:13.320]  The national news said good, you shouldn't ask questions, you shouldn't stand up and
[58:13.320 --> 58:14.320]  disrupt.
[58:14.320 --> 58:20.280]  It's a message of shut up, let the illusion go forward.
[58:20.280 --> 58:23.760]  I wonder if they could just Tase the whole crowd, we'll see after we're all fitted with
[58:23.760 --> 58:28.600]  our Taser Bracelets, as Homeland Security is considering doing, by the way I'm not joking,
[58:28.600 --> 58:32.960]  then if you do boo, Bush, we will all be Tased, it's the new system.
[58:32.960 --> 58:44.920]  Thank you for listening to GCN, be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:44.920 --> 58:49.160]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[58:49.160 --> 58:53.760]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:53.760 --> 58:59.720]  It's known as the Builder Bird, could their objective be world domination?
[58:59.720 --> 59:05.120]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world
[59:05.120 --> 59:11.320]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:11.320 --> 59:18.240]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:18.240 --> 59:22.560]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[59:22.560 --> 59:25.240]  The old America is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:25.240 --> 59:28.360]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[59:28.360 --> 59:30.280]  they're after power, yes they're after music.
[59:30.280 --> 59:37.000]  Order in-game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or Infowars.com or watch it online right now
[59:37.000 --> 59:47.000]  at PrisonPlanet.tv in-game, blueprint for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[59:47.000 --> 59:58.920]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:58.920 --> 1:00:01.960]  Government cover-ups, you want answers?
[1:00:01.960 --> 1:00:10.800]  Well so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas,
[1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:19.960]  Alex Jones.
[1:00:19.960 --> 1:00:24.880]  The only problem is those words of Senator Obama are not backed up.
[1:00:24.880 --> 1:00:42.240]  The only problem is those words of Article 6 of the Nuremberg Trial Proceedings which
[1:00:42.240 --> 1:00:58.800]  will be sausages and bracers, who won't give up!!
[1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:11.160]  Well, Senator Obama says it sounds pretty good.
[1:01:11.160 --> 1:01:15.200]  With him chanting later, tasem, tasem, tasem.
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:23.240]  And when you watch this crowd of mainly young Republicans at a university, it is like a
[1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:27.680]  Kurt Vonnegut character of a sycophant.
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:34.360]  These are supposedly 18, 19, 20, 22-year-old young conservatives, and they're wearing tight
[1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:35.360]  neck suits.
[1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:41.540]  They have pudgy, fat cheeks with rosy, you know, red circles on them.
[1:01:41.540 --> 1:01:47.360]  They're giggling and snickering and just getting off on all of it.
[1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:54.000]  They look just absolutely weak and evil and pathetic and shameful.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  And they're not conservatives.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:56.200]  They're not pro-Second Amendment.
[1:01:56.200 --> 1:01:58.460]  They're not pro-national sovereignty.
[1:01:58.460 --> 1:02:07.560]  They are just baggage picked up by the propaganda of the fake conservatives, neutralized, who
[1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:09.440]  are helping destroy this country.
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:11.440]  They've been neutralized.
[1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:13.160]  And I'm sure their parents are real proud of them.
[1:02:13.160 --> 1:02:15.560]  They all think they're real rich and elitist and powerful.
[1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:19.600]  Most of them, you know, might live in a $500,000 house and think they're members of the elite
[1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:21.840]  when they're nothing.
[1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:25.240]  And their whole future, everything's being destroyed right now in front of them.
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:27.640]  And they just have no idea and can care less.
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:34.680]  They're just saying, tase him, tase him, tase him, just like the liberals were calling for
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:40.160]  a local Austin group, Project for New American Citizen, who just held up a sign in front
[1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:42.160]  of Bill Clinton saying, Investigate 9-11.
[1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:45.920]  And they were screaming and attacking and punching him and grabbing him and ripped his
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:46.920]  sign away.
[1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:49.520]  And people were calling for him to be tased, too.
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:55.080]  You're the exact same type of person, but instead of being in a little overweight, pudgy-faced
[1:02:55.080 --> 1:03:00.720]  white-skinned, red-cheeked, piggy-people, you're these little sandals wearing, take all the
[1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:01.720]  guns.
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:02.720]  I love government.
[1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:06.360]  Oh, ma'am, Bill Clinton, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm bedwetting right now.
[1:03:06.360 --> 1:03:08.040]  I love you.
[1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:11.520]  Just just just red diaper doper babies.
[1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:15.680]  There's nothing more disgusting than people that love the government and love corruption
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:19.640]  and love these political parties and love being totes.
[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:23.720]  If you believe in this corrupt system, you're an idiot.
[1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:25.920]  If you can't see, this is corruption.
[1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:31.160]  If you can't see the Democrats work for the bankers and the Republicans work for the bankers
[1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:36.440]  and one group gives you fascism and the other gives you fascism and they call it conservatism
[1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:41.120]  and they call it socialism, it's none of the above.
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:47.160]  I mean, the Federal Reserve publicly engineered the liquidity crisis, the, the, the mega-bubble
[1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:53.360]  in 93 and 99, and now they're going to quote, save us by the Federal Reserve being given
[1:03:53.360 --> 1:03:55.600]  more power than they had in 1913.
[1:03:55.600 --> 1:04:01.720]  Now they're going to have governmental power to go around in forcibly nationalized banks
[1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:05.560]  and they're calling this anti-corruption.
[1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:08.600]  Oh, they're not going to just bail out banks.
[1:04:08.600 --> 1:04:10.560]  They're not going to bail out brokerage houses.
[1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:12.680]  The Federal Reserve is just going to take them over.
[1:04:12.680 --> 1:04:17.760]  The government is, no, this is the Federal Reserve becoming the government, taking full
[1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:22.920]  control of the economy and then going out and gobbling up all the other banks and brokerage
[1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:30.840]  firms and then backing it up with our tax money and devaluing the currency.
[1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:36.520]  So after our guest joins us, the next 30 minutes or so, we're going to get into what's really
[1:04:36.520 --> 1:04:39.320]  happening with the financials.
[1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:44.800]  The next phase of it, they implode the economy, then they set themselves up as a saviors and
[1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:49.640]  take over whatever's left and set up a domestic police state to control us in the new third
[1:04:49.640 --> 1:04:50.640]  world system.

[1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:20.240]  Here's the background.
[1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:28.080]  Our modern sciences were generally founded by or dominated from their inception by adherents
[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:29.280]  of eugenics.
[1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:38.120]  It was the governing umbrella science that all other major sciences were directed into.
[1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:46.080]  Going back about 150 years ago, reaching rock star mania by the 1930s in the western world.
[1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:48.560]  That's why Hitler was a rock star in the US.
[1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:52.880]  Our media doesn't like that to be generally known, but that's the mainstream history.
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:57.720]  Just go pull up news headlines from 33, and it's just how wonderful this young man is
[1:08:57.720 --> 1:09:04.800]  and how loving and good he is, and how it's so good that he's killing the retarded children.
[1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:10.400]  The apparatus of 500,000 plus women sterilized in this country and blacks given syphilis
[1:09:10.400 --> 1:09:17.520]  and not just allowed to die of syphilis, the full ramifications of that have now come out,
[1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:24.160]  and thousands of above ground tests of chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals on our own military,
[1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:26.240]  in some cases killing them.
[1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:31.680]  This attitude came from the general public or animals, the elite, the scientific minds
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:33.320]  are a different species.
[1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:37.880]  We have a right through survival of the fittest to cull out the gene pool, and so it's a good
[1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:43.920]  thing to basically sterilize, cull, kill these people.
[1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:44.920]  Now I'm bringing that up.
[1:09:44.920 --> 1:09:48.760]  I don't know our guest views on this, and she's got quite a bio.
[1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:53.400]  Out of that attitude, you kind of have this secretiveness and this elitist behavior by
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:09:59.000]  a lot of the healthcare systems in the country, whereas the public view on eugenics isn't
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:06.760]  even there anymore, within the mid-level elites, the direction of the ship and the architecture
[1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:10.680]  of the healthcare system is in that direction.
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:16.240]  And I learned about 12 years ago that for 35 years, England, the US, Australia, Canada,
[1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:21.000]  New Zealand, take blood at birth and send it to the health departments and put it in
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:25.800]  an international slash national database, that they use it for genetic testing, genetic
[1:10:25.800 --> 1:10:26.800]  engineering.
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:32.960]  It went to the human genome project, Colesprings Harbor, the former head of the eugenics records
[1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:37.600]  office last year, the head of the human genome who was working there when it was the eugenics
[1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:38.600]  office.
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:43.240]  I said blacks basically weren't humans, see, this is the ruling elite, and it kind of bleeds
[1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:45.160]  through there.
[1:10:45.160 --> 1:10:51.320]  And so that's why I give you the eugenics background is because that's why this is happening.
[1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:56.240]  Now they've announced that it's going to Homeland Security and criminal databases, and there's
[1:10:56.240 --> 1:11:00.960]  a lot I know about this, I've had congressmen on, I've had members of the parliament from
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:06.000]  Australia on, I've had members of the British government on about this over the years, but
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:12.960]  I saw a story in op-ed news states hand over DNA of newborns to DHS, and they quoted a
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:17.520]  lady who had testified before the Minnesota legislature, and then I spent hours reading
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:21.960]  the organization she heads up research and found out even more, then I found out University
[1:11:21.960 --> 1:11:25.680]  of Texas in the US runs a lot of this.
[1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:35.360]  So I learned a lot more, and Twyla Brace, R-N-P-H-N, Public Health Nurse, Public Citizens
[1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:42.480]  Council on Healthcare is our guest, and her bio is so lengthy that it'd be hard to go
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:48.120]  through her, but she's been on CNN, I mean just USA Today, Washington Post, if I tried
[1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:55.080]  to go over all the legislatures she's testified before, Ms. Brace, why don't you in a nutshell
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:59.440]  tell us about yourself and your credentials and how you got into this and what your organization
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:01.240]  does, and then we'll get into the blood.
[1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:04.840]  Sure, thanks so much.
[1:12:04.840 --> 1:12:10.280]  Our organization's been around for about 12 years, and we started getting into the privacy
[1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:17.240]  issue realizing that the newborn, or that privacy really allows you to give control.
[1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:23.200]  Our, allows the individual to get control, and so our organization has looked at privacy
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:29.720]  and we have testified at the national level before national committees and at the state
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:34.080]  level here in Minnesota because here is where a lot of the national policy, health care
[1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:40.480]  policy comes from, and I have also been in different publications either in op-eds or
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:45.960]  been quoted particularly on privacy it seems, although we also are a free market health
[1:12:45.960 --> 1:12:49.360]  care policy organization and work on that issue as well.
[1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:55.600]  Yeah, Blue Cross Blue Shield is based up there and I've learned that a lot of policy
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:58.800]  not just in health care is developed in Minneapolis, St. Paul.
[1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:04.640]  Right, the HMO actually came out of someone who was here now living in Jackson Hole but
[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:06.600]  was here at the time.
[1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:11.560]  Alright, I mean overall your organization deals with a lot of privacy issues but give
[1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:19.520]  us the skinny on what they're doing with the blood samples they take from the babies,
[1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:22.280]  where it goes, and what is really happening with it.
[1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:27.400]  I think that most of the public, I mean most mom and dads, they come into the hospital,
[1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:32.800]  you know the mom is in labor and delivery, and everything is very exhausting and exhilarating
[1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:33.800]  all at the same time.
[1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:37.840]  They have this baby and then they're just like recuperating.
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:45.520]  In the first 24 hours, 24 to 48 hours, a lab tech or a nurse comes into the room, sometimes
[1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:49.000]  they'll just take the baby out and say we'll give the baby a bath and while they're giving
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:53.400]  the baby a bath they also have the lab tech come and prick the baby's heel.
[1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:57.080]  Sometimes they'll do it in the room, sometimes as I said it's a nurse or sometimes it's a
[1:13:57.080 --> 1:13:58.080]  lab tech.
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:03.280]  Now, mothers and fathers are just thinking that this is just like one of the tests that
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:06.560]  happens just like when the mother's blood got drawn, etc.
[1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:12.280]  They don't understand that the hospitals are essentially contractors for the state government
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:18.400]  in every state of this nation, and that that blood is then sent to the Department of Health
[1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:26.400]  in that state, and that the, it used to be that it was just the PKU, the phenylketonuria,
[1:14:26.400 --> 1:14:31.080]  which was a devastating disease if you had it, but it's very, very rare.
[1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:34.440]  But now the states have expanded and are doing many more tests.
[1:14:34.440 --> 1:14:38.240]  Let me stop here right there, I want to go back because you're just going off the modern
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:40.440]  manifestation of this.
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:46.560]  This was set up between five nations 35 years ago and the big red flag at first should have
[1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:50.780]  been, well the hospital could do this blood test, why is it sent to the state or county
[1:14:50.780 --> 1:14:52.360]  health department?
[1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:56.600]  So that was their cover story, but then it was rapidly expanded to what it is today.
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:57.600]  Go ahead.
[1:14:57.600 --> 1:14:58.600]  Correct.
[1:14:58.600 --> 1:15:01.560]  And so, I mean that is the question, right?
[1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:05.780]  When parents try and get this done privately, it's almost impossible, although there is
[1:15:05.780 --> 1:15:11.000]  pediatrics now that does it privately, but also does it for some of the states.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:16.480]  So what we have in essence is the health department, and many of them are just able to expand the
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:19.640]  number of conditions for which they test the baby at infant item.
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:24.920]  So we have the health department being able to take and own the blood of the newborn,
[1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:29.400]  and every newborn is a newborn citizen, they're not just a newborn baby, they're a newborn
[1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:34.640]  citizen, and now suddenly the state owns and has control over the DNA and the complete
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:35.640]  genetic profile.
[1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:40.080]  Now, let's be clear, they've had court cases, federal court cases where they've taken
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:45.480]  blood, didn't tell the people, and then later, biotech companies contract, buy it, patent
[1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:49.480]  certain proteins and things in blood, and then they claim ownership of it.
[1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:50.480]  That's true.
[1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:53.960]  I think that is, you know, there are different levels to look at here.
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:58.240]  There is the whole commercial level, which is sort of what you're talking about there,
[1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:03.800]  but there's also the level at the government actually knowing the genetic profile of an
[1:16:03.800 --> 1:16:09.840]  individual, and you have to understand that what they say out there is that we have five
[1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:15.280]  to seven defects each of us, well, you know, what does that mean, and what if somebody
[1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:23.360]  looks into your blood and says, you had this defect, when, how can you possibly as an individual
[1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:26.520]  change anybody's mind about that, and what does that really mean?
[1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:32.920]  And here, what you have at the state level is the state health departments are building
[1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:39.560]  genetic or DNA warehouses of the blood of infants, and that will be the blood of all
[1:16:39.560 --> 1:16:41.240]  citizens as it grows.
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:46.560]  Now, some states are only keeping the blood for three months, but more and more the states
[1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:52.400]  are saying that they're going to keep it indefinitely, and the Centers for Disease Control had a
[1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:58.080]  meeting in 2002, they convened a meeting to look at the possibility of taking all these
[1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:04.400]  dried bloodspots from newborns and combining them into either regional or a national registry
[1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:10.640]  of bloodspots for research purposes, and so really what we're talking about here is government
[1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:17.240]  research, unconsented government research on the citizens of the states or the citizens
[1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:23.200]  of the entire country, where you can be examined for genetic defects.
[1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:28.480]  Yeah, bottom line, it's deceptive, you're paying them money, you go in there to supposedly
[1:17:28.480 --> 1:17:33.400]  have this privacy, you're trusting of the nurse, she's sitting there hooked into the
[1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:38.360]  health department, she sends the husband out of the room, honey, is he beating you?
[1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:43.040]  No judge, no jury, no due process, no reading of your rights, there's even that whole level
[1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:48.400]  of tattletailing working for the government, as the Stasi, then you expand, they take the
[1:17:48.400 --> 1:17:53.920]  blood, most parents don't even know they do it, they trick you to sign a form, as you're
[1:17:53.920 --> 1:17:59.480]  being inducted into the hospital, then it's sent, the companies are buying it up, it's
[1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:02.480]  going into Homeland Security Database, please continue.
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:08.120]  Yes, and they're also doing biomonetry now with those bloodspots to look at potential
[1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:12.920]  causes of or environmental problems in different regions of the state or different regions
[1:18:12.920 --> 1:18:14.360]  of the country.
[1:18:14.360 --> 1:18:20.880]  And so, you know, I think that the real bottom line here is that we do not know what purpose
[1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:27.560]  those bloodspots could be used for, what purpose that genetic profile or those defects could
[1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:35.840]  be used for, the states are what they're creating child health profiles, they're connecting
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:42.560]  the birth certificate of the child with the newborn genetic testing results with any cancer
[1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:47.800]  registry that might be in the state if a child eventually ends up having cancer with a defects
[1:18:47.800 --> 1:18:51.400]  registry of any child that's diagnosed with the birth defect.
[1:18:51.400 --> 1:18:56.640]  And so, you know, at the government level, they are creating and they call it a child
[1:18:56.640 --> 1:18:57.640]  profile.
[1:18:57.640 --> 1:19:02.640]  And they also want one-third of the time, just on the blood disease test, get false
[1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:07.000]  positive, doesn't matter, that goes to the insurance companies, I mean, they're just
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:09.800]  devokes, this is criminal.
[1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:14.600]  And the thing about the false positive is it causes long-term anxiety for the parents
[1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:19.720]  like five years worth of anxiety where they think, well, okay, they say it was false,
[1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:22.200]  but it's probably really true.
[1:19:22.200 --> 1:19:28.480]  And so, they've found that to be kind of harmful for the parent-child relationship.
[1:19:28.480 --> 1:19:33.440]  But I just think the fact that citizens don't know that they're losing their genetic privacy
[1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:38.120]  rights, they're losing parent rights, they're losing patient rights, because any other tests
[1:19:38.120 --> 1:19:41.760]  that would be done in the hospital, you'd actually know about, you'd be able to ask questions
[1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:42.760]  about.
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:47.000]  Look, if you told the parents your child's going in the Homeland Security criminal database,
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:48.280]  they'd say, hell no.
[1:19:48.280 --> 1:19:51.760]  But they don't tell the cattle, we'll be right back.
[1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:56.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:00.600]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:20:00.600 --> 1:20:06.560]  It's known as the Bilderberg, but their objective being world domination.
[1:20:06.560 --> 1:20:09.720]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:09.720 --> 1:20:14.720]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:18.760]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:18.760 --> 1:20:25.520]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:29.400]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:20:29.400 --> 1:20:32.080]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:20:32.080 --> 1:20:35.200]  Most people have no idea they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[1:20:35.200 --> 1:20:37.200]  They're after power, yes they're after music.

[1:20:50.920 --> 1:20:57.400]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[1:20:57.400 --> 1:21:00.640]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American Empire, instead of what's
[1:21:00.640 --> 1:21:02.360]  fair for the American people.
[1:21:02.360 --> 1:21:06.600]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be

[1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:53.240]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:57.760]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[1:21:57.760 --> 1:21:59.320]  hour there is hope.
[1:21:59.320 --> 1:22:02.400]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:06.680]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:08.200]  World Order master plan.
[1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:12.480]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:22:12.480 --> 1:22:17.680]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:20.720]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:55.640]  The national savings rate is plummeted to an all-time low, while household debt is at
[1:22:55.640 --> 1:22:56.640]  an all-time high.
[1:22:56.640 --> 1:22:58.880]  The answer is not the creation of more debt.
[1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:02.600]  Using the innovative Interest Canceling Money Merge Account program, along with existing
[1:23:02.600 --> 1:23:06.640]  banking tools, we offer you the power to pay off your mortgage in a fraction of the time
[1:23:06.640 --> 1:23:10.840]  and potentially save thousands in interest, all without refinancing an existing mortgage

[1:23:12.280 --> 1:23:16.320]  This is not a bi-weekly or a debt roll-down program, but a powerful and unique interest
[1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:17.320]  cancelling mechanism.

[1:24:07.320 --> 1:24:16.780]  As you drive along in your car in Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New York, Illinois, Ohio,
[1:24:16.780 --> 1:24:24.020]  California, this is just one more example of the type of government we have, the type
[1:24:24.020 --> 1:24:27.260]  of institutions we have.
[1:24:27.260 --> 1:24:36.500]  Most states don't even slip a form in, quote, about blood testing in the hundreds you sign.
[1:24:36.500 --> 1:24:41.420]  Most states just take your baby's blood and they sell it to private companies and now
[1:24:41.420 --> 1:24:49.940]  they're giving it to Homeland Security.
[1:24:49.940 --> 1:24:53.460]  They do what they want when they want and they treat you like dumb animals, stop acting
[1:24:53.460 --> 1:24:55.780]  like it, get mad, sue them.
[1:24:55.780 --> 1:25:01.540]  If you didn't sign a consent form or they had you sign it through fraud, you're a plaintiff.
[1:25:01.540 --> 1:25:03.460]  You need to sue the Texas Health Department.
[1:25:03.460 --> 1:25:07.020]  You need to sue the University of Texas.
[1:25:07.020 --> 1:25:09.500]  You need to sue the federal government.
[1:25:09.500 --> 1:25:12.940]  They took your baby's blood and put it in a criminal database.
[1:25:12.940 --> 1:25:15.380]  They take your baby's blood and they say they own it.
[1:25:15.380 --> 1:25:19.940]  They're going to take your baby's blood and claim your baby's got genetic malfunctions
[1:25:19.940 --> 1:25:24.820]  and your child's going to wonder why their insurance is three times where everybody else's
[1:25:24.820 --> 1:25:26.580]  is for no reason.
[1:25:26.580 --> 1:25:33.580]  These dirty crooks while a brace heads up a national organization that's testified before
[1:25:33.580 --> 1:25:41.620]  Congress, state legislature sees a registered nurse and PHN and she heads up council on
[1:25:41.620 --> 1:25:43.820]  health care, citizens' council on health care.
[1:25:43.820 --> 1:25:49.060]  Why don't you fire out some of the websites so people can check out more information?
[1:25:49.060 --> 1:26:03.180]  Sure, our website is www.cchconline.org or simply citizens' council on healthcare.org.
[1:26:03.180 --> 1:26:09.140]  Please elaborate on the fact that most states don't even tell you they're stealing the
[1:26:09.140 --> 1:26:10.140]  blood.
[1:26:10.140 --> 1:26:18.220]  Well, because for most states it is just law that this is a legal program, I believe
[1:26:18.220 --> 1:26:24.180]  there's only two states that require parent consent and that is Massachusetts and Wyoming
[1:26:24.180 --> 1:26:30.260]  I believe and the rest of them is that you don't even have an opportunity to object.
[1:26:30.260 --> 1:26:36.020]  It's simply a state program and there's no need for any paperwork, it just happened.
[1:26:36.020 --> 1:26:41.300]  And then the results of the testing are sent to the doctor's office, they're not sent
[1:26:41.300 --> 1:26:45.940]  to the parent and so a lot of times there's no real way for the parents to understand
[1:26:45.940 --> 1:26:48.220]  that this is the government that has done the testing.
[1:26:48.220 --> 1:26:52.100]  Now let's be clear, the government comes and gets in the middle of your private health
[1:26:52.100 --> 1:26:55.380]  care, your body, your child's body.
[1:26:55.380 --> 1:26:58.540]  They had it for DNA databases since it was found that I've had congressmen on who've
[1:26:58.540 --> 1:27:00.340]  been involved investigating it.
[1:27:00.340 --> 1:27:03.100]  It's an illegal eugenics program, I don't know if you're aware of that, I know you're
[1:27:03.100 --> 1:27:09.660]  a nurse but that's a separate area of my research and I'm sure go ahead.
[1:27:09.660 --> 1:27:15.060]  Well, I was just going to say that it has been a concern of ours that the newborn genetic
[1:27:15.060 --> 1:27:19.300]  screening, they call it newborn screening, we call it newborn genetic screening, it has
[1:27:19.300 --> 1:27:24.460]  been a concern of ours that it will be used in a genetic way, that it will be used to
[1:27:24.460 --> 1:27:28.980]  determine which parents should have which kids and when they shouldn't have children
[1:27:28.980 --> 1:27:35.420]  and here in Minnesota there's a bill that would allow the state to actually have ownership
[1:27:35.420 --> 1:27:40.940]  of this blood and to not require consent at all just to make sure that they aren't under
[1:27:40.940 --> 1:27:42.460]  our genetic privacy law.
[1:27:42.460 --> 1:27:48.620]  Well, England's pushing for forcing people to be genetically tested but I want to add
[1:27:48.620 --> 1:27:58.060]  the key point here and that is that this is the government playing God and this is a violation
[1:27:58.060 --> 1:28:01.180]  of our Fourth Amendment, go ahead.
[1:28:01.180 --> 1:28:06.180]  When the author was asked by one of the other senators here in Minnesota why they needed
[1:28:06.180 --> 1:28:12.780]  this data bank of all these DNA specimens, she said well this whole program is not just
[1:28:12.780 --> 1:28:16.820]  about the screening of the child, it's not just about the infant and the parent, it's
[1:28:16.820 --> 1:28:22.660]  about cost containment and prevention and I think you know it's good for your listeners
[1:28:22.660 --> 1:28:29.220]  to let that roll around in their brains a little bit because cost containment and prevention
[1:28:29.220 --> 1:28:35.020]  likely means that we don't want any child that's not perfect and we worry about the
[1:28:35.020 --> 1:28:42.060]  day where the genes of a child are fished into to find the imperfections and it will
[1:28:42.060 --> 1:28:46.780]  be part of whether or not you can be married, whether or not you should have children,
[1:28:46.780 --> 1:28:51.340]  that that in the future when you have the DNA of every child and every citizen in this
[1:28:51.340 --> 1:28:57.660]  country and you start looking at cost and prevention and perfection then you do set
[1:28:57.660 --> 1:29:01.580]  yourself up for a eugenics agenda.
[1:29:01.580 --> 1:29:06.020]  Well that's what this is all about, the guy running this whole program and who helped
[1:29:06.020 --> 1:29:11.660]  30 years ago set this up is the one Dr. Watson saying blacks aren't really humans.
[1:29:11.660 --> 1:29:16.540]  So he by the way ran the program, did you know he was instrumental in setting it up?
[1:29:16.540 --> 1:29:21.260]  Well it has been going since the 1960, early 1960 and so I-
[1:29:21.260 --> 1:29:24.780]  Okay well maybe you've got info that I don't know, according to the Australian Member of
[1:29:24.780 --> 1:29:30.740]  Parliament and the U.S. Congressman it's 35 years so but I believe your research you've
[1:29:30.740 --> 1:29:33.900]  got so much it's unbelievable we're going to come back and talk about that with our
[1:29:33.900 --> 1:29:38.460]  guests you need to support this organization ladies and gentlemen as we fight the eugenicists

[1:31:51.700 --> 1:31:56.380]  around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline
[1:31:56.380 --> 1:32:01.380]  environment but as you know most people are overly acidic due to stress acidic diet and
[1:32:01.380 --> 1:32:06.180]  lack of exercise pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as
[1:32:06.180 --> 1:32:11.020]  well as prevention of disease people who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized
[1:32:11.020 --> 1:32:16.260]  blood sugar mental clarity and loss of weight it was intended for human beings to drink alkaline
[1:32:16.260 --> 1:32:21.340]  water but due to modern way of life most people are overly acidic the fact is that disease
[1:32:21.340 --> 1:32:25.940]  simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person consumes too much
[1:32:25.940 --> 1:32:31.300]  acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it do your part alkalize and supercharge your

[1:33:15.780 --> 1:33:25.420]  is the president of citizens council on health care registered nurse and a public health nurse
[1:33:25.420 --> 1:33:36.260]  as well I have studied the quote state laws and it's all regulatory it's just like governor
[1:33:36.260 --> 1:33:41.300]  Perry saying it's the law every girl has to take the live cancer virus HPV which they
[1:33:41.300 --> 1:33:46.380]  admit doesn't even protect you from the human papillomavirus what he did was direct the
[1:33:46.380 --> 1:33:51.660]  health department under law that they make it a quote mandated vaccine in the schools
[1:33:51.660 --> 1:33:56.660]  tell you it's the law now only spots checked a few of the states but it's looks like it's
[1:33:56.660 --> 1:34:01.180]  the same I'm sure she can correct me if I'm wrong though what they say is oh it's the
[1:34:01.180 --> 1:34:06.300]  law that we're going to take this blood and blood tested for deadly childhood diseases
[1:34:06.300 --> 1:34:14.180]  and disorders and then of course the lawmakers thought that sounded reasonable but it isn't
[1:34:14.180 --> 1:34:18.060]  in the law that they take your blood and use it for research and that they own it and that
[1:34:18.060 --> 1:34:25.820]  they put you in a criminal database your newborn baby you can't do that to you know a citizen
[1:34:25.820 --> 1:34:29.420]  you pull over you can't take their blood and put it in a database how are you going to
[1:34:29.420 --> 1:34:38.460]  do though the police are trying now in Denver in other areas miss braces is is not a correct
[1:34:38.460 --> 1:34:43.820]  statement I just made about pulling them over and taking their blood well no I mean that's
[1:34:43.820 --> 1:34:49.060]  going on all over the country now but but but I mean that that that the law is only
[1:34:49.060 --> 1:34:55.100]  dealing with a blood test for a disease that the law doesn't give them shelter on all the
[1:34:55.100 --> 1:35:00.820]  other things they're doing yes it really does depend on the state and as you said very
[1:35:00.820 --> 1:35:06.340]  correctly some of the state it is within the rules and some of them it is an actual law
[1:35:06.340 --> 1:35:11.660]  but the rules if the rules are allowed to exist the rules function as a law but no legislator
[1:35:11.660 --> 1:35:17.260]  actually voted on them so you know it's called a public law and they just operate through
[1:35:17.260 --> 1:35:23.700]  force majeure or like takings if you can go to somebody's property and for even five years
[1:35:23.700 --> 1:35:28.220]  put a fence around it and guard it then it becomes yours and that's what they do they
[1:35:28.220 --> 1:35:33.500]  just they just practice these new laws go ahead well and I think that the DNA I mean
[1:35:33.500 --> 1:35:39.100]  you have to look at this whole thing about DNA and start to say that you know we have
[1:35:39.100 --> 1:35:43.140]  DNA property rights and I think that's one of the things that we should be claiming
[1:35:43.140 --> 1:35:49.540]  is our right to determine who can have access and use our DNA because we need to look at
[1:35:49.540 --> 1:35:55.100]  this well beyond the privacy aspect and look at it as the property aspect because it can
[1:35:55.100 --> 1:35:58.780]  be used against you and it can be used for commercial purposes and it can be used for
[1:35:58.780 --> 1:36:04.540]  all sorts of things without your consent unless you actually claim a property right to it.
[1:36:04.540 --> 1:36:11.220]  Now in some states you found some documentation about 45 days you have to demand it back and
[1:36:11.220 --> 1:36:13.260]  claim ownership.
[1:36:13.260 --> 1:36:19.460]  In actually here in Minnesota several years ago we got a law that allowed parents to object
[1:36:19.460 --> 1:36:25.060]  we couldn't get the actual opt-in informed consent but if you knew enough you could object
[1:36:25.060 --> 1:36:29.740]  and then you could have the blood specimen and the test destroyed.
[1:36:29.740 --> 1:36:33.860]  You don't have to do it in 45 days you can do it any time but they have to destroy it
[1:36:33.860 --> 1:36:37.820]  within a certain length of time after you have requested it.
[1:36:37.820 --> 1:36:42.940]  So we do have here in Minnesota something that most people do not have because our organization
[1:36:42.940 --> 1:36:46.140]  is in this state and that's sort of how we discovered what's going on in every other
[1:36:46.140 --> 1:36:47.140]  state.
[1:36:47.140 --> 1:36:52.260]  But that's really not good enough it really has to be informed consent from the get-go
[1:36:52.260 --> 1:36:57.140]  and they can't have ownership to it you have to have the parents consent before you start
[1:36:57.140 --> 1:37:01.900]  doing genetic research on children before you start claiming ownership to this DNA.
[1:37:01.900 --> 1:37:06.180]  You know one thing that I would tell you for your listeners is that we have done a YouTube
[1:37:06.180 --> 1:37:12.620]  on this issue and they all they have to do is put in either my name or DNA warehouse
[1:37:12.620 --> 1:37:17.460]  citizens council on health care and they will come up with this YouTube and you can have
[1:37:17.460 --> 1:37:21.900]  a something that you can share with other parents and other people to let them know
[1:37:21.900 --> 1:37:23.060]  what's happening.
[1:37:23.060 --> 1:37:27.260]  We also have a DNA survey which talks about ownership that's on our website and we'd
[1:37:27.260 --> 1:37:30.700]  love to have more people fill it out as to whether they think that you have ownership
[1:37:30.700 --> 1:37:31.700]  rights.
[1:37:31.700 --> 1:37:34.820]  I haven't seen this YouTube I'm sorry I missed it how long is it?
[1:37:34.820 --> 1:37:37.900]  Oh it's only a seven or eight minutes.
[1:37:37.900 --> 1:37:41.500]  Is it okay of next hour after you're gone if I play that here?
[1:37:41.500 --> 1:37:42.500]  Sure.
[1:37:42.500 --> 1:37:45.180]  It's going to be good because I just want to inform people.
[1:37:45.180 --> 1:37:50.860]  Now it doesn't just stop here have you looked at US Code Title 50 Chapter 32 subsection
[1:37:50.860 --> 1:37:56.220]  1520A paragraph B.
[1:37:56.220 --> 1:38:01.660]  I can tell that I have missed something in all my research but before you go on let me
[1:38:01.660 --> 1:38:06.700]  just tell you that the Senate, the US Senate and the US House have a sort of a nationalizing
[1:38:06.700 --> 1:38:11.580]  newborn genetic testing bill the Senate has already passed theirs and the House has yet
[1:38:11.580 --> 1:38:15.900]  to discuss it so but go ahead and tell me about this thing that I have apparently missed.
[1:38:15.900 --> 1:38:20.740]  No tell me about that first you're saying that they're about to nationally codify pro
[1:38:20.740 --> 1:38:23.900]  pro DNA snatching?
[1:38:23.900 --> 1:38:28.500]  Right they would that's right they would standardize it across the country and they
[1:38:28.500 --> 1:38:35.780]  would allow research on sort of like what the CDC wanted to do allow these multiple
[1:38:35.780 --> 1:38:41.540]  state or regional research banks to be set up and do research accordingly and.
[1:38:41.540 --> 1:38:45.340]  So that's what they were really doing going back to the 60s when it was under federal
[1:38:45.340 --> 1:38:51.300]  direction set up I thought it was in about 72 you're saying can we go back when did you
[1:38:51.300 --> 1:38:54.180]  learn this really started?
[1:38:54.180 --> 1:39:00.940]  Well when you say it the newborn screening started in 1961 that was the first test and
[1:39:00.940 --> 1:39:07.380]  the very last state to put it into place was like in 1992 I think so some states have
[1:39:07.380 --> 1:39:13.780]  been way ahead so to speak of doing it and others have been far farther behind but the
[1:39:13.780 --> 1:39:22.020]  whole thing about keeping the blood our state decided to do that Minnesota 10 years ago
[1:39:22.020 --> 1:39:26.420]  and some other states are not yet to that point but I think there's about 10 states
[1:39:26.420 --> 1:39:31.380]  or so or no it's more than 10 states they keep it they say either they keep it indefinitely
[1:39:31.380 --> 1:39:35.460]  or they say they keep it more than two years so you don't know what that means.
[1:39:35.460 --> 1:39:41.100]  Now this is a clear violation of people's property rights and we need parents or children
[1:39:41.100 --> 1:39:45.300]  as plaintiffs to start suing and I don't have the time or energy folks I can't do everything
[1:39:45.300 --> 1:39:51.060]  you need to do it you need to confer with our guest and find out more but if you want
[1:39:51.060 --> 1:39:56.340]  to stop Big Brother and really fight the system they're setting up this is a key area do you
[1:39:56.340 --> 1:40:00.660]  run into the problem of telling people they're putting you in an illegal database and now
[1:40:00.660 --> 1:40:05.300]  even giving it to Homeland Security with them going that's impossible this isn't
[1:40:05.300 --> 1:40:08.860]  Russia because I've been telling people about this for years I've been having congressmen
[1:40:08.860 --> 1:40:13.700]  on and members of parliament and experts on and they just laugh and say it's not true
[1:40:13.700 --> 1:40:18.300]  it's not true you know oh the black helicopter is going to get me I mean have you run into
[1:40:18.300 --> 1:40:20.740]  the public being in denial about this?
[1:40:20.740 --> 1:40:26.940]  Well I think it's less likely to happen now they're not really in denial about it they
[1:40:26.940 --> 1:40:32.300]  remembered the prick of the heel and now that we have started to expose that this is happening
[1:40:32.300 --> 1:40:38.260]  but the fact of the matter is until the last few years they only did the PKU and sickle
[1:40:38.260 --> 1:40:43.900]  cell and some things that people didn't understand but now that people are starting to see that
[1:40:43.900 --> 1:40:50.300]  these government entities are keeping the blood I mean this keeping the blood is not
[1:40:50.300 --> 1:40:55.020]  all that long ago that it started in Minnesota it's been a decade and it took a while for
[1:40:55.020 --> 1:40:59.180]  us to figure out that they were keeping the blood right so keeping the blood is not even
[1:40:59.180 --> 1:41:03.660]  in statute here they just had it did it by an executive decision they just decided we've
[1:41:03.660 --> 1:41:08.140]  got it why not keep it well you know a lot I don't know and and and I know a lot you
[1:41:08.140 --> 1:41:15.420]  don't know because it's such a big subject my intel is it's 35 years international program
[1:41:15.420 --> 1:41:20.300]  well that is interesting I I know that there are other countries lots of other countries
[1:41:20.300 --> 1:41:25.860]  that are doing newborn genetic testing oh they even follow the same protocols right
[1:41:25.860 --> 1:41:31.980]  no that's absolutely true but the fact that you say that what's his name Dr Watson started
[1:41:31.980 --> 1:41:37.100]  this that is news to me and that I certainly will be looking at to see what kind of connections
[1:41:37.100 --> 1:41:42.500]  I can find yeah well he's been heading up the human genome since the 60s right he was
[1:41:42.500 --> 1:41:48.380]  there is a top eugenicist in the late 40s when they changed the name from the cold springs
[1:41:48.380 --> 1:41:54.780]  harbor eugenics records bank to the human genome and then he's been the director for
[1:41:54.780 --> 1:42:00.100]  decades right and yes he has but he was involved and then they have a lot of the blood they're
[1:42:00.100 --> 1:42:05.420]  also using national geographic as a front for this global find your roots thing and
[1:42:05.420 --> 1:42:14.700]  it's very sinister do you know about bio shield yeah yeah I mean 36 level 4 bio weapons labs
[1:42:14.700 --> 1:42:19.860]  it all ties into that right well I think a lot of these things tie together and they
[1:42:19.860 --> 1:42:24.980]  have a variety of purposes because I think there are people in the health department
[1:42:24.980 --> 1:42:32.780]  who are focused on trying to cut costs by essentially eliminating any you know imperfect
[1:42:32.780 --> 1:42:38.780]  children there are other people who have commercial purposes for it and other people who just
[1:42:38.780 --> 1:42:43.220]  want to advance their research careers I mean I think there's a lot of different things
[1:42:43.220 --> 1:42:47.180]  going on here well you're right in every case in every case where we have this type of people
[1:42:47.180 --> 1:42:51.940]  stuff happening it's a perfect storm where you have a cost benefit analysis where industry
[1:42:51.940 --> 1:42:56.620]  wants to pay a lot of money for the samples of the big genetic engineering firms and then
[1:42:56.620 --> 1:43:00.540]  you've got the government and institutional interest that want to do studies and create
[1:43:00.540 --> 1:43:04.940]  maps and law enforcement that wants a national DNA database and then they come in with our
[1:43:04.940 --> 1:43:09.820]  tax money and and that's key what you mentioned earlier they're paying the hospitals as their
[1:43:09.820 --> 1:43:15.340]  agents go ahead right and I think that something that happened recently in England which you
[1:43:15.340 --> 1:43:20.260]  may or may not have told your listeners about is that they decided that doctors and teachers
[1:43:20.260 --> 1:43:24.420]  should be on the lookout for children that they think might be criminals and then they
[1:43:24.420 --> 1:43:30.060]  would like to collect the DNA of those children in advance of the possibility that they might
[1:43:30.060 --> 1:43:35.380]  be criminals I mean this sort of thinking is the kind of thinking that's out there and
[1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:41.940]  I think it's well it's eugenics and it's you know it's a tyrannical it's you know this
[1:43:41.940 --> 1:43:46.860]  kind of control where you take their their blood and their DNA and you wait and you've
[1:43:46.860 --> 1:43:52.020]  already classified them as a problem that could be a problem yes I did see the British
[1:43:52.020 --> 1:43:59.620]  piece last week but if you in my film in game that just came out a few months ago we have
[1:43:59.620 --> 1:44:04.460]  news clips and the news articles and then government documents where two-year-olds in
[1:44:04.460 --> 1:44:10.620]  England are put on probation because if one of their parents has a criminal conviction
[1:44:10.620 --> 1:44:16.140]  without any medical testing nothing they just say you are genetically a criminal and so
[1:44:16.140 --> 1:44:21.500]  they put you on probation at age two for the crimes of your parents so it's even worse
[1:44:21.500 --> 1:44:27.060]  it's not just let's take blood from five-year-olds if they show traits of aggressiveness which
[1:44:27.060 --> 1:44:31.740]  we claim means criminality and then getting you in a system they're already putting two-year-olds
[1:44:31.740 --> 1:44:39.340]  I mean I have the headline well I think that I think that you know what people could be
[1:44:39.340 --> 1:44:44.740]  tested for there are genetic collaborations that have said that we envision a time where
[1:44:44.740 --> 1:44:49.780]  children will be tested for 200 conditions some of those conditions are things probably
[1:44:49.780 --> 1:44:57.180]  like Alzheimer's, diabetes, leukemia but there are other conditions like crime, right and
[1:44:57.180 --> 1:45:02.580]  crime and behavior and I mean 200 conditions and well let me stop you again because you
[1:45:02.580 --> 1:45:05.500]  just keep bringing up so many keys we've got to have you back up again you're an amazing
[1:45:05.500 --> 1:45:09.740]  lady I mean your understanding of this we already caught with the new freedom initiative
[1:45:09.740 --> 1:45:16.420]  three years ago now in play in 50 states where first you know zero to 18 now pregnant women
[1:45:16.420 --> 1:45:21.220]  they claim you must be psychologically screened and it turned out the drug companies wrote
[1:45:21.220 --> 1:45:26.820]  the screening to maximize profits and claim a bunch of disorders that don't even exist
[1:45:26.820 --> 1:45:32.660]  to put you on dangerous psychotropic drugs so they're going to engineer this as well.
[1:45:32.660 --> 1:45:40.060]  Well I do have to say that there is sort of a medicalizing of every possible error or
[1:45:40.060 --> 1:45:45.580]  defect or problem that there is and saying that it can be treated somehow and that someone
[1:45:45.580 --> 1:45:48.020]  has the solution for whom you must pay money.
[1:45:48.020 --> 1:45:53.300]  Well they say aggressive they say aggressive rebellious boys are mentally ill no that's
[1:45:53.300 --> 1:46:00.660]  a man that's what men do they say I mean this is ridiculous they say kids lying and being
[1:46:00.660 --> 1:46:08.340]  rude is a disease no they haven't been disciplined sorry go ahead yeah well I think that's absolutely
[1:46:08.340 --> 1:46:14.020]  true but when you when when the people think that it can be medicalized it sets a whole
[1:46:14.020 --> 1:46:19.700]  another thing into play and it takes the child and it takes the parents out of the equation
[1:46:19.700 --> 1:46:25.700]  and it puts other people into the equation to fix the child or to fix the parents and
[1:46:25.700 --> 1:46:30.380]  there's money to be made and there's political agendas to be made and there are bigger departments
[1:46:30.380 --> 1:46:36.140]  to build for this kind of medicalizing of everything and I think that that is one of
[1:46:36.140 --> 1:46:41.700]  the ways that government is being expanded is just to look at all these problems which
[1:46:41.700 --> 1:46:47.300]  have to do with things as you say like discipline and time with children and all those sorts
[1:46:47.300 --> 1:46:52.340]  of things and instead to say no there's a medical reason and we will build a bigger
[1:46:52.340 --> 1:46:54.540]  agency to deal with it.
[1:46:54.540 --> 1:46:57.660]  Exactly the nanny state in their own documents and I've had the number two department of
[1:46:57.660 --> 1:47:02.660]  education on other top educators this was admitted 30 years ago 20 years ago 10 years
[1:47:02.660 --> 1:47:09.340]  ago in the highest councils that it is about the corporate system being able to label everybody
[1:47:09.340 --> 1:47:14.420]  either gets you on welfare gets you in the criminal justice system or gets you in the
[1:47:14.420 --> 1:47:21.220]  mental health system or gets you in debt everything is about getting you into a slave position
[1:47:21.220 --> 1:47:28.700]  where oh you've got your bill of rights but only one out of 100 can keep from being designated
[1:47:28.700 --> 1:47:32.900]  in one of these categories where you don't have your rights you see they're finding us
[1:47:32.900 --> 1:47:39.540]  all incompetent that's basically the new form of slavery is incompetence and they advertise
[1:47:39.540 --> 1:47:44.660]  all these diseases and all these illnesses and all these mental problems and then their
[1:47:44.660 --> 1:47:50.420]  cure is worse than the disease and then you try to go buy a gun and oh sorry you got you
[1:47:50.420 --> 1:47:54.620]  were diagnosed remember your you know your your wife said your husband said you should
[1:47:54.620 --> 1:47:58.860]  go in since your mother died to a counselor and the counselor says oh I'm gonna get you
[1:47:58.860 --> 1:48:04.780]  on some meds but then they diagnose you with post-traumatic stress and then your life's
[1:48:04.780 --> 1:48:11.980]  over you have no rights well and I think that people really don't understand how the information
[1:48:11.980 --> 1:48:15.820]  travels and someday I would love to talk just about the whole national health information
[1:48:15.820 --> 1:48:21.900]  system but what you said about you know them deciding that you're incompetent we have here
[1:48:21.900 --> 1:48:27.900]  from the holocaust museum here in Minnesota they're showing this this little expedition
[1:48:27.900 --> 1:48:32.780]  which is called deadly medicine and there's something from the american eugenics society
[1:48:32.780 --> 1:48:38.780]  in the 1920s and it has these flashing light bulbs and one of them says the light flashes
[1:48:38.780 --> 1:48:41.980]  every seven and a half minutes and here's a little thing that it says underneath it
[1:48:41.980 --> 1:48:49.180]  says every seven and a half minutes a good person is a high i'm sorry a high grade person
[1:48:49.180 --> 1:48:53.820]  is born in the united states who will have ability to do creative work and be fit for
[1:48:53.820 --> 1:49:01.300]  leadership about four percent of all americans come within this class so they're saying
[1:49:01.300 --> 1:49:06.860]  they're only four percent this is the american eugenics society back in 1920 but it fits with
[1:49:06.860 --> 1:49:11.620]  what you were saying about finding this all incompetent because they would say that only
[1:49:11.620 --> 1:49:17.420]  four percent of the american population is fit for leadership everyone else has some
[1:49:17.420 --> 1:49:25.220]  incompetencies that need to be dealt with absolutely incredible uh... we don't actually
[1:49:25.220 --> 1:49:30.660]  even says uh... on one side less of these other words we need less of these people
[1:49:30.660 --> 1:49:37.500]  who are born uh... mentally at a lower level or are criminal and then it says more of these
[1:49:37.500 --> 1:49:42.820]  and that's at that the level of those four percent i mean you know this thinking is old
[1:49:42.820 --> 1:49:48.380]  thinking now i've seen that he has gone away now i've seen the big uh... you know photographs
[1:49:48.380 --> 1:49:54.940]  of that in fact that very photo is in in game where it uh... shows what they put out nationwide
[1:49:54.940 --> 1:49:59.660]  and really this is a way for the elite to just sit up there and then they can decide who's
[1:49:59.660 --> 1:50:03.780]  good and who's bad and it's really just a mode of total control and then you find out
[1:50:03.780 --> 1:50:09.220]  the eugenicists want ninety five percent population reduction some only one eighty percent population
[1:50:09.220 --> 1:50:13.540]  reduction but that's why they believe that because they believe only five to ten percent
[1:50:13.540 --> 1:50:20.420]  of us are worth living right and then it when you combine that with what they want to do
[1:50:20.420 --> 1:50:25.060]  with health care and how they want to cut costs in the health care system you see who

[2:07:57.380 --> 2:08:04.380]  uh...
[2:08:15.340 --> 2:08:19.740]  okay i'm going to play a few minutes of gary hardening and being holy music in front of
[2:08:19.740 --> 2:08:23.620]  people asking him serious questions about the north american union government sponsored
[2:08:23.620 --> 2:08:30.740]  by chair that's we are change colorado it's up on jones report dot com right now that's
[2:08:30.740 --> 2:08:34.420]  coming up in a few minutes but right now here's a few minutes of the eight minute clip about
[2:08:34.420 --> 2:08:42.020]  dna warehousing illegal dna databases of your children as the government does genetic testing
[2:08:42.020 --> 2:08:47.300]  gives it to homeland security does whatever they want when they want here it is the minnesota
[2:08:47.300 --> 2:08:53.820]  department of health has been collecting the blood and dna of the children of minnesota
[2:08:53.820 --> 2:09:00.100]  for over ten years the department did that without statutory authority or without any
[2:09:00.100 --> 2:09:07.100]  parent consent or knowledge and uh... in march of two thousand seven a judge said that the
[2:09:08.580 --> 2:09:15.060]  two thousand six genetic privacy law would require the department of health to get informed
[2:09:15.060 --> 2:09:22.060]  of parent consent for both the genetic testing of the program as well as the collection of
[2:09:22.220 --> 2:09:28.540]  the blood and the retention of the blood and for research genetic research on the blood
[2:09:28.540 --> 2:09:33.780]  the department decided that they would appeal that decision they lost the appeal and now
[2:09:33.780 --> 2:09:40.060]  they have come to the legislature asking for the newborn genetic program to be exempted
[2:09:40.060 --> 2:09:46.420]  from the state genetic privacy law and one of the things that the people of minnesota
[2:09:46.420 --> 2:09:52.180]  need to understand about that is that there are seventy three thousand children born
[2:09:52.180 --> 2:09:59.020]  every year and the blood and dna of those children now become state property of the
[2:09:59.020 --> 2:10:06.020]  minnesota government that means that the government holds on to the dna and can provide that dna
[2:10:06.020 --> 2:10:11.980]  and provide that dna for genetic research on the children of the state in eighteen years
[2:10:11.980 --> 2:10:18.580]  every child turns a voting adult and their dna will still be the property of the state
[2:10:18.580 --> 2:10:25.060]  of minnesota so what we're saying is if there is a genetic privacy law here in minnesota
[2:10:25.060 --> 2:10:32.060]  as there is why are we going to exempt the dna of every citizen born since july of nineteen
[2:10:32.060 --> 2:10:39.060]  ninety seven from that genetic privacy law and continue that exemption in perpetuity
[2:10:39.620 --> 2:10:44.060]  because clearly that means that the genetic privacy of all the citizens of minnesota
[2:10:44.060 --> 2:10:48.780]  starting since nineteen ninety seven or at least since those who were born in nineteen
[2:10:48.780 --> 2:10:54.100]  ninety seven that they don't have genetic privacy the state of minnesota does a variety
[2:10:54.100 --> 2:10:59.580]  of things with the blood and dna that they could stop right there thus far we're only
[2:10:59.580 --> 2:11:02.060]  going to play a few more minutes of this you can we're going to post the whole thing up
[2:11:02.060 --> 2:11:07.900]  on jonesreport.com that's kind of the live action site while i'm on air and it's right
[2:11:07.900 --> 2:11:11.820]  to the window posting wherever we talk about air doing a great job remember when she's
[2:11:11.820 --> 2:11:15.380]  talking about minnesota it's the rest of the country because it's the main model so is
[2:11:15.380 --> 2:11:20.460]  texas the two states working wicked tandem together the university of texas runs the
[2:11:20.460 --> 2:11:24.620]  national program when it comes to dna testing and putting in the database and then handing
[2:11:24.620 --> 2:11:30.300]  it over to homeland security back to her. The state of minnesota does a variety of things
[2:11:30.300 --> 2:11:37.300]  with the blood and dna that they collect thus far as we see in this chart here there are
[2:11:39.900 --> 2:11:44.900]  as i said there you know since nineteen ninety seven seven hundred and eighty thousand children
[2:11:44.900 --> 2:11:50.220]  whose dna is the property of the state of minnesota but if you look down here there's forty two
[2:11:50.220 --> 2:11:55.820]  thousand two hundred and ten who have had their dna given to genetic researchers and
[2:11:55.820 --> 2:12:01.340]  genetic research has been done on those children without the consent or the knowledge of their
[2:12:01.340 --> 2:12:08.340]  parents i know that the department also conducts their own internal research looking at the
[2:12:08.340 --> 2:12:14.260]  potential for having new genetic tests on every newborn child. What the state of minnesota
[2:12:14.260 --> 2:12:20.140]  does is it collects five blood spots on every newborn child typically before twenty four
[2:12:20.140 --> 2:12:26.980]  hours or at twenty four hours after birth and they send two of the blood spots to male
[2:12:26.980 --> 2:12:31.420]  and then they keep three of them and the male clinic does part of the testing and the state
[2:12:31.420 --> 2:12:36.740]  of minnesota does another part of the testing. We give the names of susie and henry and dakota
[2:12:36.740 --> 2:12:43.380]  and mary an and aden and kiko and taiisha to give an understanding that these are all
[2:12:43.380 --> 2:12:49.780]  the children from every nationality and every walk of life who have their blood spots owned
[2:12:49.780 --> 2:12:57.380]  as state property by the government. The genetic testing of babies has grown exponentially
[2:12:57.380 --> 2:13:03.940]  in two thousand three the department was i believe testing babies for only five conditions
[2:13:03.940 --> 2:13:08.900]  they came to the legislature in two thousand three and asked for asked the legislature
[2:13:08.900 --> 2:13:14.900]  to give the department of health the ability to increase or expand the number of conditions
[2:13:14.900 --> 2:13:19.540]  for which children are tested well that's enough back to the legislature and again they do
[2:13:19.540 --> 2:13:23.660]  all of this it's kind of like they ask for wiretapping ability forty years after they
[2:13:23.660 --> 2:13:30.180]  start doing it without warrants it's thirty five years at least the major western nations
[2:13:30.180 --> 2:13:34.340]  that goes in international dna database and then i have them articles right here where
[2:13:34.340 --> 2:13:39.700]  it now goes to homeland security in the criminal database let me go ahead and get these audio
[2:13:39.700 --> 2:13:43.060]  clips out of the way because then i want to get into the economy i want to get into the
[2:13:43.060 --> 2:13:47.380]  latest war developments a mobile phone news and i've just decided i'm not going to take
[2:13:47.380 --> 2:13:52.420]  any calls today i'm going to take a lot of calls tomorrow and then we got a special guest
[2:13:52.420 --> 2:13:57.780]  several special guests actually on wednesday and then before i forget i keep forgetting
[2:13:57.780 --> 2:14:05.060]  to do this there is going to be the biggest announcement this radio show has ever made
[2:14:07.220 --> 2:14:11.620]  the biggest announcement in the history of this particular manifestation of my radio show
[2:14:12.260 --> 2:14:18.900]  that's been here for i don't know i've been doing this show since 98 so 10 years the syndicated
[2:14:18.900 --> 2:14:25.620]  show the biggest announcement in the history of this radio show coming up next monday about

[2:14:47.620 --> 2:14:51.220]  so it's not like i'm going to make an announcement and you're going to have to wait to see
[2:14:51.220 --> 2:14:56.900]  that announcement manifest you will see it immediately manifested

[2:15:27.380 --> 2:15:29.460]  second hour if you like to know the announcement time
[2:15:35.380 --> 2:15:43.620]  and uh don't ask me to tell you what is this going to be till then that's the fun part about surprises
[2:15:43.620 --> 2:15:49.300]  all right um
[2:15:51.940 --> 2:15:56.500]  this is we are change colorada the first question is about the north american union security
[2:15:56.500 --> 2:16:01.860]  prosperity partnership trans-texas corridor stuff like that and gary hard just says i've never heard
[2:16:01.860 --> 2:16:06.180]  of that that doesn't exist have any of you heard of that about half the crowd says yeah we've heard
[2:16:06.180 --> 2:16:12.820]  of it that's just like governor riddes saying i'm for a national driver's license not a national
[2:16:12.820 --> 2:16:19.540]  id then you read the actual federal documents it's a global id they play stupid then he says he
[2:16:19.540 --> 2:16:24.420]  knows nothing about government-sponsored terror and he's too tired to talk about false flag terror
[2:16:24.420 --> 2:16:30.900]  no he just writes letters publicly publishing newspapers to akhmet denigit of iran saying our
[2:16:30.900 --> 2:16:35.380]  government stages terror attacks you better do what we say or we'll stage one and blame it on you
[2:16:35.380 --> 2:16:39.700]  and attack you just you know don't think for a minute that just because 80 percent of people
[2:16:39.700 --> 2:16:45.780]  in polls are against attacking you that there won't be some stage provocation we stage the main
[2:16:45.780 --> 2:16:54.260]  we stage tonkin we stage stuff i mean he publicly writes letters with the thinnest veil
[2:16:56.740 --> 2:17:03.140]  of saying the government did it because he knows the public doesn't read what is it less
[2:17:03.140 --> 2:17:12.340]  than four percent of the country reads a book a year i'm not being sardonic or mean i realize more
[2:17:12.340 --> 2:17:20.020]  and more they get away with all of it because people get up they take a shower they eat breakfast
[2:17:20.020 --> 2:17:23.620]  they start watching television while they're eating breakfast they go to work they try to make as much
[2:17:23.620 --> 2:17:29.620]  money as possible they go to the sports bar they or they got kids they go home cook them dinner do
[2:17:29.620 --> 2:17:34.740]  laundry get up again and they just know how to turn on their blinker you know start their car
[2:17:34.740 --> 2:17:39.540]  turn on the blinker they know how to put their tie on and they know how to sell insurance or
[2:17:39.540 --> 2:17:45.060]  they know how to run checkpoints or they know how to change oil filters and that's it
[2:17:50.980 --> 2:17:55.940]  meanwhile we've got a bunch of psychopathic power tripping
[2:17:55.940 --> 2:18:02.500]  scientists working at the behest of the biggest banking families who literally own the planet
[2:18:04.180 --> 2:18:07.940]  with delusions of grandeur with life extension technologies thinking they're never going to
[2:18:07.940 --> 2:18:12.980]  die but saying the planet's got to be saved by culling the mass of humanity and then i get
[2:18:12.980 --> 2:18:15.940]  emails every day saying well the public is dumb maybe they should die
[2:18:19.060 --> 2:18:23.940]  meanwhile the elite are doing things pale male that could destroy the planet and i'm going to list
[2:18:23.940 --> 2:18:28.100]  some of those at the bottom of the hour that's why i decided not to take calls so i can have time to
[2:18:28.100 --> 2:18:34.980]  cover that big news coming up we'll play the gary hard after the break then i'm going to come back
[2:18:34.980 --> 2:18:38.340]  blitz through some economic news and some other stuff then i'm going to spend the rest of show
[2:18:38.340 --> 2:18:43.060]  the last 15 minutes or so i'm going to do whole shows on this i'm going to put physicists on
[2:18:43.060 --> 2:18:46.580]  scientists and experts and quantum mechanics physicists and
[2:18:49.460 --> 2:18:53.380]  i've been doing a lot of research on this for more than a decade and now it's just really starting
[2:18:53.380 --> 2:19:02.820]  to get a lot of attention so we'll be breaking that down because the elite say that they're taking
[2:19:02.820 --> 2:19:07.860]  all our freedoms away at the at the higher levels you know when they're calling in governors and
[2:19:07.860 --> 2:19:13.060]  presidents and ceo's they openly may write books about it and put out corporate minutes saying
[2:19:13.060 --> 2:19:16.340]  yeah we got to get rid of 80 percent of the people to save the earth it's real sad but
[2:19:16.340 --> 2:19:20.260]  we got to do it and we got to have a tyrannical world government to stop the spread of super
[2:19:20.260 --> 2:19:25.620]  technologies that can destroy the planet if they're not controlled meanwhile it's the very elitist
[2:19:26.900 --> 2:19:32.340]  that have already controlled those technologies and are running around like a lunatic who sets
[2:19:32.340 --> 2:19:39.220]  themselves on fire in a fireworks factory running across a carpet of fuses hooked into
[2:19:39.220 --> 2:19:44.500]  kegs of dynamite as big as the empire stage building we'll be right back stay with me

[2:20:09.940 --> 2:20:14.500]  their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand
[2:20:17.380 --> 2:20:22.820]  for the first time in history the elitist plan for world government is blown wide open

[2:26:40.980 --> 2:26:47.860]  crowd saying that the king has no clothes what is your position on a proposed north american
[2:26:47.860 --> 2:26:54.180]  union given that is likely to reduce our national sovereignty and we're under irrelevant our constitution
[2:26:54.180 --> 2:27:00.340]  and build right i'm sorry first first part again uh what is your position on a proposed north american
[2:27:00.340 --> 2:27:08.900]  union proposed normal america union north american union yeah never heard of it as a pp
[2:27:08.900 --> 2:27:16.020]  who's proposing uh george bush signed a treaty back in 2005 with our prime minister
[2:27:16.820 --> 2:27:25.220]  canada and the president of lexco combined into the three nations as one you never heard of that
[2:27:25.220 --> 2:27:32.820]  anybody everybody was recommended yeah push aside this company
[2:27:32.820 --> 2:27:46.420]  for some reason when you're watching video with bad audio you see the lips moving and it sounds
[2:27:46.420 --> 2:27:50.660]  like good audio and when you play it it just sounds terrible but i know you can make that out
[2:27:51.860 --> 2:27:57.940]  heart has actually been on the council on foreign relations board that helped codify some of these
[2:27:57.940 --> 2:28:05.140]  plans he was also on the cfr board that came up with the 9 11 uh homeland security plan years before
[2:28:05.140 --> 2:28:09.940]  it happened he's the guy that said we need to use this disaster for a new world order he's a
[2:28:09.940 --> 2:28:15.860]  consummate globalist and he's like what is that and for everybody out there listening
[2:28:17.300 --> 2:28:21.780]  remember last year they had the 50th anniversary of the european union remember
[2:28:21.780 --> 2:28:28.260]  and they celebrated it as the treaty of roam 1957
[2:28:31.220 --> 2:28:34.820]  but the whole world was told the european union was founded in 2000
[2:28:36.180 --> 2:28:41.860]  see people in europe 20 30 40 years ago would complain and say they didn't want to be integrated
[2:28:41.860 --> 2:28:47.060]  and they would just say it doesn't exist what are you talking about now it isn't going to take
[2:28:47.060 --> 2:28:52.180]  50 years in this case it's we're taking and we're talking 20 years and we're already decades into

[2:29:20.260 --> 2:29:26.020]  a yuppie see a yuppie's threatened by that so they'll say it doesn't exist so they don't have to
[2:29:26.020 --> 2:29:32.580]  deal with it and then they'll act cool that's what it's really all about acting cool thinking

[2:33:13.380 --> 2:33:17.940]  and then everybody says we know what it is and he's like oh man all these people can see they're
[2:33:17.940 --> 2:33:24.420]  all wearing black sunglasses from they live they also bring up how he called for a new world order
[2:33:24.420 --> 2:33:33.540]  and he says new world order what is that i don't know what that is what again talking to everyone
[2:33:33.540 --> 2:33:43.300]  like their children he goes oh wait a minute is that what george bush senior called for in 1991 i
[2:33:43.300 --> 2:33:50.660]  think only once scripting exactly what he said two days after 9 11 where he says i remember
[2:33:50.660 --> 2:33:55.060]  president bush and he only said it once he he called for a new world order and that's what we
[2:33:55.060 --> 2:34:01.940]  need to do is use this disaster and make lemonade out of lemons and use this disaster for a new
[2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:07.540]  world order see it's all scripted all scripted when they talk to you and they talk real slow
[2:34:07.540 --> 2:34:13.780]  like they're talking to a baby well more and more of us can see you scumbag
[2:34:15.700 --> 2:34:22.180]  the jigs up criminal you think you can write letters to iran saying back off or will stage
[2:34:22.180 --> 2:34:28.180]  terror and we won't make a big deal i mean you think we're that dumb you think you can write
[2:34:28.180 --> 2:34:33.780]  white house memos saying crush children's body parts we're not like you we're not with you
[2:34:33.780 --> 2:34:39.780]  and we're tired of you using america's good name and dragging into the mud and there is an awakening
[2:34:39.780 --> 2:34:44.820]  happening again i want to say this i've studied history and the us has been the most amazing
[2:34:44.820 --> 2:34:50.980]  country in history for its form of government its revolution its ideals the leaders that set it up
[2:34:51.940 --> 2:34:55.860]  we had more patents than anybody else in the world more innovation more liberty
[2:34:55.860 --> 2:35:03.140]  just incredible people whether you came here as a black slave you were the strongest because half
[2:35:03.140 --> 2:35:07.940]  your people died on the way over or whether you came here as a white and injured servant you were
[2:35:07.940 --> 2:35:13.940]  tough or whether you know it was adventurers it was criminals it was it was black sheep it was a
[2:35:13.940 --> 2:35:20.420]  nation made up of misfits the dirty the dirty dozen and this has been the greatest nation ever
[2:35:20.420 --> 2:35:30.420]  but even back in the time of the philosophers at their heyday in greece they knew that and
[2:35:30.420 --> 2:35:33.940]  they'd seen it already happen in their different kingdoms greece had a lot of different kingdoms
[2:35:33.940 --> 2:35:40.820]  in it where whoever got on top for a couple hundred years will then fall because the grandchildren
[2:35:40.820 --> 2:35:47.620]  and the great-grandchildren of those that were as hard as nails and fast as a rattlesnake
[2:35:47.620 --> 2:35:53.060]  well the next kids pretty tough and dad makes them work hard but then they kind of spoil the next
[2:35:53.060 --> 2:35:57.060]  kids and then they spoil the next kids it's hard work to make children be tough and strong and
[2:35:57.060 --> 2:36:02.660]  make them march up hills and make them clean up their plates and make them you know throw out the
[2:36:02.660 --> 2:36:10.980]  trash it's real basic stuff and so people turn into spoiled brats they turn into weak brats uh
[2:36:10.980 --> 2:36:15.780]  then the then they say oh protect people don't let kids have fistfights don't let them grow up let
[2:36:15.780 --> 2:36:22.660]  them let them learn how to call the cops instead you see and and so the men are soft and they're on
[2:36:22.660 --> 2:36:28.020]  tons of hormones in the milk and the food and the plastics and so they're effeminate the women are
[2:36:28.020 --> 2:36:39.060]  hyper feminine and so that's very upset about the fact that in every statistic we're the worst there
[2:36:39.060 --> 2:36:46.100]  is we're becoming one of the least free we're becoming the dumbest the fattest myself included
[2:36:46.100 --> 2:36:51.220]  i'm not up on some high horse uh we just really are becoming slovenly
[2:36:56.660 --> 2:36:58.180]  we're becoming slovenly
[2:37:01.780 --> 2:37:02.820]  we're falling apart
[2:37:02.820 --> 2:37:12.500]  and in a vacuum when you have a nation of brain lazy sheep who just think that life is disneyland
[2:37:12.500 --> 2:37:16.100]  and that everything's fine and everything's wonderful when you have people that have that
[2:37:16.100 --> 2:37:25.460]  attitude the wolves come and they're institutionalized they're in power they love it that everybody's
[2:37:25.460 --> 2:37:30.900]  stupid they've done everything they could to accentuate it and to and to accelerate the
[2:37:30.900 --> 2:37:35.780]  dumbing down in the last hundred years and they've done it
[2:37:38.500 --> 2:37:46.020]  and our biggest weakness isn't even that we can't find england on a map or can't find iraq on a map
[2:37:47.140 --> 2:37:54.500]  or don't understand the order of the planets or just in which are wonderful things i mean
[2:37:54.500 --> 2:38:01.380]  interesting dynamic exciting i mean i'm braced every day and chilled with the incredible wonderment
[2:38:01.380 --> 2:38:08.260]  of consciousness and being living on this on this giant molten rock that's covered with the thin
[2:38:08.260 --> 2:38:16.180]  skin of life hurtling through deep space i know i talk a lot about that because i am just chasing
[2:38:16.180 --> 2:38:22.260]  i am thankful i am completely blown away i mean it when the sun sets you're looking up through
[2:38:22.260 --> 2:38:29.220]  the gaseous atmosphere and you see distant stars winking into visibility in the moon rising above
[2:38:29.220 --> 2:38:35.780]  the trees the giant dead satellite that orbits our planet and the birds in the trees and hopping
[2:38:35.780 --> 2:38:43.940]  around on their colors and their sharp eyes and just everything it's amazing you're only here one
[2:38:43.940 --> 2:38:48.420]  time and you're unhappy you've been made to feel inadequate by Madison Avenue you've been made to
[2:38:48.420 --> 2:38:54.580]  feel pathetic you've been made to feel weak you've been made to be focused on on issues that don't
[2:38:54.580 --> 2:39:03.460]  matter and and and and you feel inadequate because you don't have some stupid black corvette or
[2:39:04.900 --> 2:39:07.060]  Cadillac or Mercedes
[2:39:07.060 --> 2:39:17.620]  you feel unfulfilled when the universe is open before you and i'm not saying a black Cadillac
[2:39:18.340 --> 2:39:19.940]  is a bad thing i think they look sharp
[2:39:23.540 --> 2:39:29.300]  i'd have one but it's not my style i'm low key the point is that that if that's your god you've
[2:39:29.300 --> 2:39:33.380]  got a problem and people say well what do you mean you know things are bad i'm not saying we
[2:39:33.380 --> 2:39:38.260]  should be a bunch of communists i'm saying when it is everything you're focused on everything you
[2:39:38.260 --> 2:39:48.340]  live for when that is the object of your i mean i remember being like 18 years old and looking
[2:39:48.340 --> 2:39:53.060]  at women and lusting after them and like a unhappily wishing i could have them all
[2:39:53.060 --> 2:40:01.460]  you know that feeling that anxiousness of man she's gorgeous man i just want her
[2:40:03.940 --> 2:40:10.660]  to now i've developed to the point where i don't even desire
[2:40:12.420 --> 2:40:18.500]  women i mean i do but but that's a smaller part of my psyche i just admire their beauty
[2:40:18.500 --> 2:40:27.140]  i i share in it and it's not even sexual i don't even know how to explain it it's like i've grown
[2:40:27.780 --> 2:40:30.980]  and i realize that very few people i don't even think ever even get to this level
[2:40:31.860 --> 2:40:38.740]  and it's so much fun it's so great to be able to appreciate beauty all around you and see it
[2:40:38.740 --> 2:40:45.060]  everywhere but i'm already digressing and i said i'd get into things that you'll
[2:40:45.060 --> 2:40:48.500]  lead are doing that endanger the whole planet but i need to get into this news first here
[2:40:51.460 --> 2:40:54.820]  the long and short of it on the financial end is this just as we told you
[2:40:56.900 --> 2:41:03.380]  the federal reserve the private banking group of families that own our nation most banks are
[2:41:03.380 --> 2:41:08.340]  not federal reserve owners they are members meaning they're regulated by the private fed
[2:41:08.340 --> 2:41:15.140]  that there's a handful of european and u.s and british banks like jp morgan chase
[2:41:15.780 --> 2:41:20.500]  who own the private stock in the secret of private federal reserve and they're the ones
[2:41:20.500 --> 2:41:24.900]  at lobby they're the ones that pushed for changing the laws to flood everything with liquidity
[2:41:26.020 --> 2:41:30.580]  knowing it wouldn't be paid back then it caused a chain reaction which they initiated three years
[2:41:30.580 --> 2:41:36.580]  ago the popping of it now they pose as a saviors and the federal reserve is going to be given more
[2:41:36.580 --> 2:41:44.740]  governmental power to nationalize banks forcibly and to quote not bail them out just give the other
[2:41:44.740 --> 2:41:52.740]  bank chairman and even their stockholders and brokerage firm heads to give them nothing and
[2:41:52.740 --> 2:41:57.860]  then take all the real assets and have the u.s taxpayer bail it out so it's not a so they're
[2:41:57.860 --> 2:42:07.140]  spending it as it's not a bailout we're going to go with the nordic style bailout of the early
[2:42:07.140 --> 2:42:12.260]  nineties and we're going to give nothing to the to the shareholders and nothing to the corrupt
[2:42:12.260 --> 2:42:18.260]  ceo's and corrupt officers of the corporations and we're going to nationalize it but then you
[2:42:18.260 --> 2:42:22.500]  look at their nationalization plan it's the they're saying the national federal reserve
[2:42:22.500 --> 2:42:27.300]  will have governmental power and will have no regulations on itself it's i mean just any
[2:42:27.300 --> 2:42:32.980]  regulations they admit i was driving and listening to fox news driving into my sunday show yesterday
[2:42:32.980 --> 2:42:39.220]  and i heard them during the news say well the federal reserve is going to be taking over most
[2:42:39.220 --> 2:42:43.700]  of the banks in the country and having even more power and strangely enough that means even less
[2:42:43.700 --> 2:42:52.660]  regulation to fix things and so they're just made absolute god over everything with armies of police
[2:42:52.660 --> 2:42:57.700]  and military ready for the politicians to snap their fingers to just gun people down on the streets
[2:42:57.700 --> 2:43:03.220]  if we get too upbeat when they take your pension funds everything else you got i mean it's just
[2:43:03.220 --> 2:43:10.260]  raw total domination and when the cops are out there beating your head in with their clubs they're
[2:43:10.260 --> 2:43:15.220]  going to really think that they're doing this to save the economy but as the imf document state
[2:43:15.220 --> 2:43:20.420]  they want the riots they want the total breakdown to our total confidence is lost and then the
[2:43:20.420 --> 2:43:35.860]  bankers get it all i mean this is the takedown of the us financially and so the federal reserve
[2:43:35.860 --> 2:43:42.340]  reserve gets to take over everything and then we get left holding the bag and then they get worshiped
[2:43:42.340 --> 2:43:50.980]  as usual the media is talking about what genius is brunacky and what genius is green span are oh
[2:43:50.980 --> 2:43:57.140]  we're so lucky to have them when they set the policies that did this fed eyes nordic style
[2:43:57.140 --> 2:44:02.260]  nationalization of us banks the fed has been criticized for its rescue of bear sterns which
[2:44:02.260 --> 2:44:07.940]  critics say has degenerated into a taxpayer gift for the rich bankers a senior official at one of
[2:44:07.940 --> 2:44:13.220]  the scandinavian central banks told the daily telegraph that the fed strategists have stepped
[2:44:13.220 --> 2:44:19.300]  up contracts and contacts to learn how norway sweden and finland managed their traumatic crises
[2:44:19.300 --> 2:44:25.700]  in 91 and 93 which brought the net regions economy to its knees is understood that fed vice
[2:44:25.700 --> 2:44:31.380]  chairman don cohen remains very concerned about the depth of the u.s crisis and his eye when
[2:44:31.380 --> 2:44:38.260]  nordic approach for contingency options scandinavia's bank rescue proved successful it is now a model
[2:44:38.260 --> 2:44:44.420]  for central banks unlike japan's drawn out response which ailing banks were propped up in a half
[2:44:44.420 --> 2:44:50.100]  public limbo for years while the response varied in each nordic country there was a major effort to
[2:44:50.100 --> 2:44:56.260]  avoid the sort of moral hazard that has bedeviled efforts by the fed and the bank of england and
[2:44:56.260 --> 2:45:00.980]  the bank of england in trying to stabilize their banking systems norway ensured that shareholders
[2:45:00.980 --> 2:45:06.900]  of insolvent lenders received nothing and the senior management was entirely purged two of the
[2:45:06.900 --> 2:45:16.580]  country's top bankers christina bank were seized by force majeure we're determined not to get caught
[2:45:16.580 --> 2:45:26.660]  in the game we've seen with bear sterns yeah right oh we're so lucky to have bernacky oh thank you
[2:45:26.660 --> 2:45:31.860]  bernacky for making everybody social security check worth half what it was oh and you're gonna get
[2:45:31.860 --> 2:45:37.300]  rid of all its value oh thank you thank you but to a public who can't find the us on a map
[2:45:38.900 --> 2:45:41.780]  that they believe it it's a ball headed guy in a suit he must know what he's doing
[2:45:41.780 --> 2:45:49.300]  man in suits never bad bush and brown and push to deal with crises financial times one
[2:45:49.300 --> 2:45:55.460]  president bush us president gordon brown the uk prime minister have agreed to step up cooperation
[2:45:55.460 --> 2:45:59.780]  over the crisis and financial markets they are setting up a joint working group which will develop
[2:45:59.780 --> 2:46:03.780]  plans to monitor and regulate the banking system and then you read the banking plan
[2:46:03.780 --> 2:46:07.380]  it's unlimited power to the bank of england and the private fellow reserve
[2:46:07.380 --> 2:46:13.220]  oh i'm so glad they're saving us
[2:46:14.420 --> 2:46:18.900]  paulson proposes financial overhaul administration unveils sweeping plan to overall financial
[2:46:18.900 --> 2:46:24.020]  regulation ap the bush administration money proposed the most far-reaching overhaul of
[2:46:24.020 --> 2:46:29.140]  national regulatory system since the stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing great depression
[2:46:29.140 --> 2:46:34.100]  the plan would change how the government regulates thousands of businesses from the nation's biggest
[2:46:34.100 --> 2:46:39.140]  banks and investment houses down to the local insurance agent mortgage broker treasurer secretary
[2:46:39.140 --> 2:46:45.540]  henry paulson unveiled the 218 page plan in a speech the treasurer's ornate cash room he declared
[2:46:45.540 --> 2:46:50.020]  that the strong financial system was important not just to wall street but also for working americans
[2:46:51.460 --> 2:46:56.660]  and you look at bush with a devilish laugh in the photo and paulson and brunacky they are looking
[2:46:56.660 --> 2:47:01.860]  like they have just won the lottery and they have they're raping us destroying the dollar
[2:47:01.860 --> 2:47:06.180]  destroying the nation's financial future but they're taking over everything that's left
[2:47:09.220 --> 2:47:15.060]  and they're getting total nazi-like power over all the other banking and lending and brokerage
[2:47:15.060 --> 2:47:22.020]  and stock institutions see now you're just gonna have a few people with it all and then there'll
[2:47:22.020 --> 2:47:28.100]  be another crisis and then they'll offer the next solution as the tourniquet it's kind of like one
[2:47:28.100 --> 2:47:32.900]  of those traps the more you struggle the tighter it gets and they're just always there going i'm
[2:47:32.900 --> 2:47:42.900]  your friend never mind my hands around your neck there you go there you go yes i love you so much
[2:47:43.540 --> 2:47:49.460]  don't don't struggle i'm just just helping your neck just wiping some sand off don't you mind that
[2:47:49.460 --> 2:47:57.380]  and all you're passing out now i'm your friend i'm the government
[2:48:01.700 --> 2:48:06.340]  well it's gotten a lot of attention and i'm glad we had uh high ranking well the chief
[2:48:06.340 --> 2:48:14.180]  guys in his party and he's on the council of advisors the highest level of the japanese
[2:48:14.180 --> 2:48:18.980]  parliament had him on yesterday for 30 minutes from tokyo on the sunday show it's up on prison
[2:48:18.980 --> 2:48:24.260]  planet dot com info wars dot com member of japanese diet doubts official 911 fairytale
[2:48:24.900 --> 2:48:33.060]  don't expect the new york time cnn report on fujita yuka he says grilling of japanese prime
[2:48:33.060 --> 2:48:39.220]  minister over the official 911 fairytale and then it well the new story we've got actually
[2:48:39.220 --> 2:48:43.540]  had it here in my stack that's an old one paul wrote he's calling for a global investigation
[2:48:43.540 --> 2:48:47.700]  and for other governments to investigate and now the european parliament's looking at it so
[2:48:47.700 --> 2:48:53.540]  more and more is coming out more and more is starting to happen there on that front so that's
[2:48:53.540 --> 2:49:00.340]  exciting and we're going to get that audio of that interview posted up on prison planet dot
[2:49:00.340 --> 2:49:06.180]  com i noticed it wasn't there last night is it there today my computer's sick here in the studio
[2:49:06.180 --> 2:49:10.900]  so i had a computer all day it's out there in the hall being worked on or i need to get another one
[2:49:10.900 --> 2:49:18.340]  i guess that was being used for something i think um you know i said i would get into all this black
[2:49:18.340 --> 2:49:24.020]  whole news on the other side but i don't think i can really give it justice in five minutes
[2:49:26.740 --> 2:49:30.980]  i'm gonna start the show tomorrow and i'm good and fresh with this and do a full hour on and
[2:49:30.980 --> 2:49:37.700]  then we got a bunch of guests coming on we'll also take calls because i don't think i can really do
[2:49:37.700 --> 2:49:43.700]  justice to this and i want to try to maybe even just in 30 minutes calmly in a focused manner sum
[2:49:43.700 --> 2:49:53.140]  this up because i've got us government reports top physicists i've got the british royal society
[2:49:53.140 --> 2:50:08.100]  head saying it's very dangerous um this is something that needs to be covered in great detail
[2:50:08.820 --> 2:50:16.180]  and i need to spend time on this and properly break it all down so i'm gonna do that tomorrow
[2:50:16.180 --> 2:50:22.820]  we've talked a lot about genetic engineering but when you deal with well they have the equations
[2:50:23.940 --> 2:50:29.940]  a hundred years ago for a bombs they had the equations for hydrogen bombs 80 years ago
[2:50:30.820 --> 2:50:35.300]  and they were detonating a bombs 65 years ago
[2:50:39.620 --> 2:50:44.100]  i'll finish up i'll get back i'll get a little bit into this now what do you think they have now
[2:50:44.100 --> 2:50:56.740]  well they've told us it is a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is dominated by a
[2:50:56.740 --> 2:51:03.460]  powerful world government it's known as the builder bird put their objective be world domination
[2:51:04.020 --> 2:51:10.100]  for thousands of years their dark order grew now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[2:51:10.100 --> 2:51:14.660]  their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand
[2:51:17.540 --> 2:51:22.980]  for the first time in history the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open
[2:51:22.980 --> 2:51:26.820]  you will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda
[2:51:26.820 --> 2:51:30.580]  builder bird is making great progress toward a world government most people have no idea
[2:51:30.580 --> 2:51:34.260]  they're not after money they have all the money they need they're after power that's their after

[2:52:49.620 --> 2:52:56.340]  too well these days you're going to start taking this hemp I say go to hempusa.org
[2:52:58.340 --> 2:53:03.860]  you may not like what I'm about to say but you know I'm going to say it anyway the government
[2:53:03.860 --> 2:53:09.860]  doesn't want the best for you they keep you down they keep you blue they starve your body for all
[2:53:09.860 --> 2:53:17.540]  its nutrients they won't let you grow industrial hemp it really doesn't make any kind of sense
[2:53:17.540 --> 2:53:24.900]  when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you my friends I hope mr bush will hear this song
[2:53:24.900 --> 2:53:33.780]  for the heart of america wants this one go to hempusa.org if you're a true thurin anarchist
[2:53:33.780 --> 2:53:42.660]  or renegade you only want things that god has made go to hempusa.org we offer free shipping
[2:53:42.660 --> 2:53:53.460]  anywhere in the states go to hempusa.org
[2:53:53.460 --> 2:54:04.260]  so
[2:54:11.060 --> 2:54:17.060]  final segment covered in china news had a very important guest on about the illegal
[2:54:17.060 --> 2:54:24.260]  dna databases in the second hour that already starts on the web at infowars.com coming up in
[2:54:24.260 --> 2:54:29.380]  about five minutes you've got to go there to listen to those streams be able to hear the show
[2:54:31.620 --> 2:54:36.340]  yeah there was an article of friday in the new york times that got me talking about this sunday
[2:54:36.340 --> 2:54:39.780]  a little bit but tomorrow i'm going to do at least 30 minutes on it probably an hour on it
[2:54:40.420 --> 2:54:46.020]  asking a judge to save the world and maybe a whole lot more and then it gets into super
[2:54:46.020 --> 2:54:52.420]  conducting super colliders and the physicist to believe it will has the probability to create
[2:54:53.140 --> 2:54:57.140]  amongst a bunch of other things that will destroy the entire planet the solar system in some cases
[2:54:59.140 --> 2:55:07.540]  that will create black holes but that's one of many now max plank and a lot of others had the
[2:55:07.540 --> 2:55:16.500]  equations for the a bomb in 1905 1906 that's why hg wells that hung around with all of them
[2:55:17.060 --> 2:55:25.700]  wrote a book in 1912 where there were atom bombs that term was used now it wasn't science fiction
[2:55:28.180 --> 2:55:33.220]  you think they just went out in the desert in 4044 and just pulled one of these out of their nose
[2:55:33.220 --> 2:55:42.660]  was the big problem was enriching the uranium by the way their first test succeeded boom
[2:55:45.060 --> 2:55:50.180]  1944 tested it rolled it out and dropped it on the japanese in 45
[2:55:56.580 --> 2:56:00.820]  now um a bunch of top physicists and i'm going to go over those tomorrow i have said that
[2:56:00.820 --> 2:56:06.820]  that the superconducting super colliders would probably create black holes very small ones
[2:56:06.820 --> 2:56:12.580]  they predicted they would fall apart and decay and sure enough in 2005 laboratories and now a
[2:56:12.580 --> 2:56:17.620]  bunch of them have done it have made miniature black holes they've got these big magnetic systems
[2:56:17.620 --> 2:56:22.260]  that supposedly hold them in place and they've created artificial suns and they did that 30 years
[2:56:22.260 --> 2:56:27.140]  ago and they can they've created new elements that didn't exist before okay it is buck rogers
[2:56:27.140 --> 2:56:34.260]  it's just you're not told about it i mean it's declassified but it's not popularly discussed
[2:56:35.060 --> 2:56:41.220]  now imagine what is classified and i got articles here about about any matter bombs and what the
[2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:46.500]  air force has got and the rest of it and the point here is the scientists doing this admit
[2:56:46.500 --> 2:56:51.380]  they don't know what's going to happen each time they do these tests and they're they're messing
[2:56:51.380 --> 2:56:57.300]  around with more and more dangerous particles accelerating heavy particles into other heavy
[2:56:57.300 --> 2:57:03.860]  particles and the scientists that warned people were right about the black holes and then now
[2:57:03.860 --> 2:57:07.140]  there's these strangelets and then these other things that can be created
[2:57:09.700 --> 2:57:15.300]  and then you got the genetic engineering uh going wild i'll talk about it tomorrow it's just
[2:57:15.300 --> 2:57:23.220]  just the elite is out of their minds and i'll never forget watching that film trinity came out
[2:57:23.220 --> 2:57:30.020]  in the late 90s about atomic program and hydrogen program and it showed in the early 60s where
[2:57:30.020 --> 2:57:34.820]  out in arizona or was it new mexico they they definitely like a hundred hydrogen bombs in
[2:57:34.820 --> 2:57:42.100]  the atmosphere in one night to see if it would catch the atmosphere on fire or cause
[2:57:42.100 --> 2:57:49.300]  emp globally and it did blow up stuff around the world blow up transistors and things and some of
[2:57:49.300 --> 2:57:53.780]  the scientists thought it was going to catch the atmosphere on fire and they said okay let's try to
[2:57:53.780 --> 2:57:58.980]  let's try to catch the earth on fire that's who runs things so go ahead and enjoy your
[2:57:58.980 --> 2:58:04.580]  checkpoints cops go ahead and enjoy sending pottas to jail go ahead and put everybody in fema camps
[2:58:04.580 --> 2:58:08.340]  and go ahead and drink your fluoride and think you've got all the problems handled and go ahead
[2:58:08.340 --> 2:58:12.820]  and hide under your bed from al-qaeda they're genetic engineering things that have already
[2:58:12.820 --> 2:58:17.780]  given rise to superviruses and bacteria already mass crises going on being covered up they're
[2:58:17.780 --> 2:58:22.180]  that they're messing with the very fabric of any matter and everything else you can imagine
[2:58:22.820 --> 2:58:27.940]  just god help us please god help us we'll be right back at info wars dot com go there listen
