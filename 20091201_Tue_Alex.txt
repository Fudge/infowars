[00:00.000 --> 00:09.800]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.800 --> 00:10.800]  You want answers?
[00:10.800 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:23.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23.440 --> 00:36.520]  It is Tuesday, December 1, 2009, we're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:36.520 --> 00:42.880]  Colonel Craig Roberts will be joining us coming up in the last hour today to chronicle all
[00:42.880 --> 00:47.120]  of the police state activities unfolding here in the United States.
[00:47.120 --> 00:55.960]  He's a former police officer, helicopter pilot, SWAT team commander, a Vietnam Marine Corps
[00:55.960 --> 01:00.120]  sniper, and an Oklahoma City bombing investigator.
[01:00.120 --> 01:02.360]  He'll be joining us today.
[01:02.360 --> 01:07.880]  We also have our once-a-month visit from Hawaii with Mike Rivera, always informative.
[01:07.880 --> 01:12.360]  We'll be talking about Climate Gate and a lot more, some huge developments on that from,
[01:12.360 --> 01:15.240]  I'll tell you about after the break.
[01:15.240 --> 01:20.280]  Former UN documented surfaced talking about how to deceive the public, how to brainwash
[01:20.280 --> 01:27.080]  children, and how the UN must not let the public know that this is about global government.
[01:27.080 --> 01:31.180]  Wow, I guess they didn't tell the head of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, who writes editorials
[01:31.180 --> 01:32.680]  calling for world government.
[01:32.680 --> 01:36.680]  I guess they didn't tell Von Rompuy, or however he pronounces his name, the new head of the
[01:36.680 --> 01:43.000]  EU calling for global government, admitting the carbon tax, Copenhagen is the key to that.
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.920]  But this shows the incredible internal deception of these people.
[01:45.920 --> 01:49.320]  This could be as big as the Climate Gate documents.
[01:49.320 --> 01:54.000]  If we recognize how big it is and force it out there into the mainstream media, Paul
[01:54.000 --> 02:02.200]  Watson's got several key reports on this up at PrisonPlanet.com today.
[02:02.200 --> 02:08.880]  I want to go out to break with this great music video, hide the decline, dealing with
[02:08.880 --> 02:09.880]  Climate Gate.
[02:09.880 --> 02:10.880]  Here it is.
[02:10.880 --> 02:20.880]  I'm going to show you all the news on the other side of this quick break.
[02:20.880 --> 02:30.280]  Making up debt at the old hard way, fudging the numbers day by day, ignoring the snow
[02:30.280 --> 02:37.440]  and the cold in a downward line.
[02:37.440 --> 02:49.320]  Hide the decline, Michael Mann thinks he's so smart, totally inventing the hockey stick
[02:49.320 --> 02:58.880]  chart, ignoring the snow and the cold in a downward line.
[02:58.880 --> 03:16.480]  Hide the decline, the climate gate, I think you have sealed your fate, I hope you do a
[03:16.480 --> 03:24.600]  lot of time, cause what you did was such a crime.
[03:24.600 --> 03:38.200]  Hide the decline, hide the decline, the tree ring data was very thin, you should have chopped
[03:38.200 --> 03:50.320]  more trees instead of hugging them, ignoring the snow and the cold in a downward line.
[03:50.320 --> 04:06.680]  Hide the decline, hide the decline, the climate gate, I think you have sealed your fate, I
[04:06.680 --> 04:15.960]  hope you do a lot of time, cause what you did was such a crime.
[04:15.960 --> 04:33.400]  Hide the decline, hide the decline, hide the decline, hide the decline, hide the decline,
[04:33.400 --> 04:48.000]  How to Decline
[05:03.400 --> 05:07.700]  is even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying
[05:07.700 --> 05:12.420]  their processed food that makes you sick? Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't
[05:12.420 --> 05:17.220]  have to cooperate. There is a solution. Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and

[07:24.540 --> 07:28.540]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[07:28.540 --> 07:32.860]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[07:32.860 --> 07:35.660]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[07:35.660 --> 07:40.500]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[07:40.500 --> 07:44.260]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science,
[07:44.260 --> 07:49.900]  one of my old sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's

[08:00.700 --> 08:06.620]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's
[08:06.620 --> 08:10.620]  a war on for your mind.
[08:10.620 --> 08:15.260]  Colonel Craig Roberts to talk about the state of the world, the world government openly
[08:15.260 --> 08:21.180]  being announced, the police state will be joining us coming up in the last hour today,
[08:21.180 --> 08:25.060]  Mike Rivera, with his monthly report from www.mysolarbackup.com. We'll be joining us
[08:25.060 --> 08:30.060]  coming up in the next hour.
[08:30.060 --> 08:35.260]  I've gotten a lot of emails and phone calls and questions saying, why aren't you talking
[08:35.260 --> 08:44.260]  about the gatecrashers at the White House last week? Why aren't you talking about Tiger
[08:44.260 --> 08:54.620]  Woods? Because Tiger Woods wrecking his car and having zero privacy and the stupid wannabe
[08:54.620 --> 09:02.780]  socialites sneaking in or not sneaking in, whatever the case really is, doesn't matter.
[09:02.780 --> 09:09.940]  The plunging dollar matters. Open world government and carbon taxes over every facet of our lives
[09:09.940 --> 09:21.180]  being publicly set up is what matters. And I just cannot talk about issues of little
[09:21.180 --> 09:26.700]  or no significance. I cannot and I will not do it. You know, why does the media love this
[09:26.700 --> 09:32.540]  White House party crashing story? Because they get to obsess over getting to be near
[09:32.540 --> 09:37.940]  the president and his celebrity and how he runs everything and how people fight kings
[09:37.940 --> 09:45.740]  and queens and movie stars to go to his galas and oh, are we keeping him safe and how can
[09:45.740 --> 09:52.020]  anyone get near the emperor and he runs everything. You know, I told you they were going to build
[09:52.020 --> 09:57.900]  Obama up as a God and then destroy him and that he would probably only be a one-term
[09:57.900 --> 10:02.780]  president. People laughed at me over a year ago when he was first elected in November.
[10:02.780 --> 10:08.420]  They laughed in January. They laughed in March when I released Obama Deception. Now you've
[10:08.420 --> 10:13.180]  seen his approval rating, depending on the poll, dropped to as low as 40% the lowest
[10:13.180 --> 10:21.140]  of any president a year into their administration ever. But if we sit here and oh, great, we
[10:21.140 --> 10:26.740]  defeated Obama, his whole agenda is in trouble, we will miss the point that in a couple years
[10:26.740 --> 10:31.380]  they're just going to put a Republican in who will continue the same operation until
[10:31.380 --> 10:36.060]  we shadow the left-right paradigm and realize that both parties may put out different rhetoric
[10:36.060 --> 10:41.780]  and different propaganda, but at their core, they are the same. Things are only going to
[10:41.780 --> 10:49.460]  get worse and I know the general audience knows that better than even I do. It's just
[10:49.460 --> 10:53.940]  that the issue here is we have to get out to the general public and explain to them
[10:53.940 --> 10:58.540]  if you want to keep your standard of living and if you want to keep the hard one, hard
[10:58.540 --> 11:03.220]  fought Bill of Rights and Constitution and Declaration of Independence that our ancestors
[11:03.220 --> 11:09.020]  gave us and that our soldiers fought and died for, then you had better stop living the
[11:09.020 --> 11:15.620]  tabloid lifestyle. You'd better stop being led around by the nose by the controlled corporate
[11:15.620 --> 11:22.580]  media that feeds you on a steady diet of kidnappings and OJ Simpsons and Anna Nicole Smith and
[11:22.580 --> 11:29.460]  they're going to have huge congressional hearings tomorrow about the gatecrashers.
[11:29.460 --> 11:35.020]  This is turning into one of the biggest stories of the year. We should be having giant hearings
[11:35.020 --> 11:40.220]  now about climate gate, but we're a week and a half into this and they're only discussing
[11:40.220 --> 11:45.900]  having some small hearings that the media won't cover in the next few weeks. We should
[11:45.900 --> 11:50.700]  be having giant televised hearings on every major channel. They're saying these hearings
[11:50.700 --> 11:58.420]  tomorrow are going to preempt daytime soaps and news with these two morons, these two
[11:58.420 --> 12:05.100]  painted trollops, these two worldly peons up there testifying that they were really
[12:05.100 --> 12:10.860]  invited. So what? Who cares? They should be preempting all the stupid soap operas with
[12:10.860 --> 12:18.860]  climate gate. You have the head UN research center talking to the head US research center,
[12:18.860 --> 12:25.940]  Goddard, who studies the climate Goddard Space Center with the UN engaged red handed in absolute
[12:25.940 --> 12:35.060]  total unmitigated red handed hand in the cookie jar fraud. That criminal that sold us on NAFTA
[12:35.060 --> 12:39.660]  and GATT and claims he invented the internet and is involved with Enron is running around
[12:39.660 --> 12:47.020]  all over every major television show media dramas in paid for. It's admitted government
[12:47.020 --> 12:53.340]  has paid to have Al Gore on all these television shows telling the audiences, you've got to
[12:53.340 --> 12:57.540]  get politically involved. You've got to go get legislation passed to save the earth.
[12:57.540 --> 13:02.820]  And what's that legislation? Taxes paid to the private IMF, the new center of the open
[13:02.820 --> 13:13.860]  public world government. But no, Tiger Woods crashed his car. We better talk about that
[13:13.860 --> 13:18.460]  for the next six months and did his wife do it. So what? Leave them alone. Let them live
[13:18.460 --> 13:26.820]  their lives. So what? How many people have had their wife before take a swing at them?
[13:26.820 --> 13:31.460]  How many people jumped in the car before and sped off and wrecked it? I know a lot of people
[13:31.460 --> 13:39.620]  done that. I had a girlfriend in college one time started punching me in the face and scratching
[13:39.620 --> 13:46.660]  me. I went jumped in my car and it was icy outside, slid off the road. Was there a big
[13:46.660 --> 13:52.900]  national investigation about it? I mean, how many of you hypocrites who love to see Tiger
[13:52.900 --> 13:57.620]  Woods in trouble because you're jealous and envious of his success. And so you live vicariously
[13:57.620 --> 14:05.580]  through his, his, his stumbling, his failure. How many of you were ever involved in something
[14:05.580 --> 14:14.620]  like this? Huh? It's just unbelievable. All right. I'm already ranting and I've got so
[14:14.620 --> 14:22.820]  much vital news to cover. It is just paramount mental illness, paramount mass mental illness.
[14:22.820 --> 14:29.700]  We are in the state we are in right now today because from birth we've all been trained
[14:29.700 --> 14:42.340]  and fed on a steady, continual diet of issues of no significance, of trivia, of fluff. And
[14:42.340 --> 14:48.480]  we're drowning in fluff. Meanwhile, we're in a sea of red hot tyranny. If we could only
[14:48.480 --> 14:52.740]  alert the public to it and get them to realize the full magnitude of what we're living in
[14:52.740 --> 15:05.540]  and what we're going into, we could turn this around instantly.
[15:05.540 --> 15:09.580]  So here's the deal. I am not going to talk about the congressional hearings tomorrow
[15:09.580 --> 15:18.280]  about two vapid, hollow, preening peacocks sneaking in to that theater, that, that White
[15:18.280 --> 15:23.660]  House state dinner that's meant to make everybody think the buck stops with Obama so the new
[15:23.660 --> 15:29.780]  world order can in the end blame everything on him. Not going to talk about it. And I'm
[15:29.780 --> 15:33.940]  not going to talk about Tiger Woods. Okay. That's all I have to say about it. And it
[15:33.940 --> 15:43.500]  just, it just absolutely blows my mind that this is going on. Now, what's going on in
[15:43.500 --> 15:50.140]  real news? What's going on in the real world that actually matters? Suspected cop killer
[15:50.140 --> 15:58.420]  slain by police. A lone officer chased him. He ran and he killed him. And this guy witnesses
[15:58.420 --> 16:04.340]  have now ID'd him as the person at the scene. Looks like he is the man that did this and
[16:04.340 --> 16:08.420]  it fits into a larger pattern of people targeting police officers and killing them. This is
[16:08.420 --> 16:12.700]  racially motivated, clearly just like in Oakland, California, or what's happening in Denver.
[16:12.700 --> 16:16.900]  And it's a real tragedy, but we don't want the media to use this to get everybody at
[16:16.900 --> 16:25.360]  each other's throats in an even greater fashion. But that is, that is certainly going on there.
[16:25.360 --> 16:28.820]  And we're glad this guy is off the streets because he'd been convicted of armed robbery
[16:28.820 --> 16:36.660]  and theft and couldn't, uh, rested for rape, child rape. The list just went on and on.
[16:36.660 --> 16:43.500]  So, and, and, and, you know what? I don't really like Huckabee because he is a fake neocon,
[16:43.500 --> 16:49.340]  but the way the media is trying to blame him for this, when it was the parole board that's
[16:49.340 --> 16:54.540]  told him, give him clemency and all governors do is sign off on it. Again, I'm tired of
[16:54.540 --> 17:05.760]  hollow, shallow, baloney. I'm tired of fake news events where you can have the treasury
[17:05.760 --> 17:10.500]  secretary and the last treasury secretary before him, Paulson, making hundreds of millions
[17:10.500 --> 17:15.660]  of dollars a piece off the bailout money that they directed to themselves. They don't get
[17:15.660 --> 17:23.580]  in trouble, but the governor of New York visits a hooker and his career is over. And I'm not
[17:23.580 --> 17:26.940]  defending him. It's just that the, the, the crime is nothing compared to the crime of
[17:26.940 --> 17:36.740]  robbing everyone. Uh, you've got, um, Huckabee has nothing to do with this guy. Uh, I mean,
[17:36.740 --> 17:42.100]  he was convicted again of a bunch of armed robberies and assaults and was released again
[17:42.100 --> 17:49.420]  by another state. He had raped a child reportedly and attacked a police officer. And this was
[17:49.420 --> 17:55.940]  a two months ago and was released on bail. I mean, are we going to blame the, uh, governor
[17:55.940 --> 18:04.740]  of Washington state? No, you blame the criminal justice system itself and the judges and the
[18:04.740 --> 18:10.460]  system that statistically keep nonviolent offenders in prison longer than violent offenders.
[18:10.460 --> 18:14.820]  They let them out on purpose to carnage the public. So the public calls for more police
[18:14.820 --> 18:20.540]  and more control. A Chicago police chief admitted this, what, 20 something years ago in an
[18:20.540 --> 18:28.380]  interview with playboy, another police chief wrote a book about it criticizing it. And
[18:28.380 --> 18:33.180]  so yeah, cops, you're going to get killed by the monsters that your corrupt system
[18:33.180 --> 18:39.860]  lets out. I'm not blaming the police. I'm blaming the criminal justice system. And you
[18:39.860 --> 18:47.260]  know what? The statistics from the justice department are 90% of cop killers get caught
[18:47.260 --> 18:53.940]  and get the death penalty. 90% get caught. You know what percentage of murders of homicides
[18:53.940 --> 19:06.420]  of general peasants of the general citizenry get caught 10%. Now I don't like that. I want
[19:06.420 --> 19:12.100]  everybody brought to justice. And if you don't have a sense of justice, Hey cops, next time
[19:12.100 --> 19:16.260]  you beat up some teenager and you go ahead and just falsely charge them with assaulting
[19:16.260 --> 19:21.140]  you because when you punch them in the face and they flail on the ground, their leg bumped
[19:21.140 --> 19:27.700]  into you or something, just remember, you filled the prisons up with innocent people
[19:27.700 --> 19:32.980]  and you are somewhat to blame for all these cops getting killed by hardcore murderers
[19:32.980 --> 19:39.780]  because the government continues to release them. Now most of the time they're just raping
[19:39.780 --> 19:44.260]  and robbing us, the general public and look at Chicago and New York where the crime bosses
[19:44.260 --> 19:48.980]  that run the government don't want the citizens to have firearms to defend ourselves from
[19:48.980 --> 19:54.820]  pigs like this guy that just got killed. So I say good riddance to this guy. We'll be
[19:54.820 --> 20:01.220]  right back with huge, gigantic world government news. But Paul Watson. You have a mortgage
[20:01.220 --> 20:05.380]  and a load of other debt. Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away? No more mortgage

[20:24.740 --> 20:28.500]  about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody. Whenever I have a friend or someone

[22:04.100 --> 22:08.660]  one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it. You wouldn't buy
[22:08.660 --> 22:13.460]  gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out
[22:13.460 --> 22:17.940]  trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that social security would be there for you. That's
[22:17.940 --> 22:23.540]  not what's happening. You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation,
[22:23.540 --> 22:28.100]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure. If all looks
[22:28.100 --> 22:32.740]  rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold. For the realists, there have never been more
[22:32.740 --> 22:39.220]  sobering reasons to diversify with gold. Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while
[22:39.220 --> 22:45.060]  gold has risen 300%. Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios. You should,

[23:57.300 --> 24:16.820]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded. Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[24:16.820 --> 24:29.620]  Everybody knows the war is over. Everybody knows the good guy's lost. Everybody knows the fight
[24:29.620 --> 24:37.540]  was fixed. The poor stay poor. The rich get rich. We are back live. Ladies and gentlemen,
[24:37.540 --> 24:44.420]  thank you so much for joining us today. Okay, a week and a half ago, I went on air
[24:44.420 --> 24:52.740]  and I said to listeners and you responded. I pointed out that climate gate emails were the
[24:52.740 --> 24:58.820]  smoking red handed documents that could defeat the new world order, the beginning of the end.
[24:58.820 --> 25:05.380]  The key to their world government is the Copenhagen cap and trade tax grid. They have auxiliary
[25:05.380 --> 25:11.300]  funding systems, but this is the funding system to make the world government completely autonomous
[25:11.300 --> 25:17.380]  in and of itself as the main rule maker of the planet. We have Ban Ki-moon, the head of the UN
[25:17.380 --> 25:23.060]  saying it. We have Van Rompey saying it. The head of the EU. This is in their own documents.
[25:25.060 --> 25:30.260]  A new document has come out and AP and Fox and others linked to this yesterday. Paul Watson wrote
[25:30.260 --> 25:34.100]  an article about it, but it didn't get much attention. He's written a new one today with
[25:34.100 --> 25:43.460]  the latest developments and this needs to break and be giant. Global government gate, UN takeover
[25:43.460 --> 25:50.660]  gate, UN gate. I don't know. We need to dub it something bombshell. UN documents outlined plan
[25:50.660 --> 25:56.580]  to use climate gate crooks in in run around national sovereignty strategy paper calls for
[25:56.580 --> 26:01.140]  United Nations to boss economies and erect world government under pretext of environmentalism.
[26:01.140 --> 26:08.100]  Now, we have that from previous club of Rome documents. We have that restated in the UN treaty,
[26:08.100 --> 26:13.700]  the Copenhagen treaty, but this is specifically about being deceptive specifically about not
[26:13.700 --> 26:21.780]  letting the public know specifically just like SPP documents that got leaked or judicial watch
[26:21.780 --> 26:25.620]  sued three years ago to get them through a four year request admitted that they had to do it by
[26:25.620 --> 26:31.940]  stealth. That's a quote and use carbon taxes as the funding mechanism of the North American Union.
[26:33.380 --> 26:37.620]  Strategy papers call for United Nations to boss economies and erect world government
[26:37.620 --> 26:43.780]  under pretext of environmentalism. And in the documents, they talk about how to brainwash
[26:43.780 --> 26:47.380]  children. Now, we already know the federal government and other governments around the world
[26:47.940 --> 26:52.420]  are spending billions a year brainwashing kids. We have links to New York Times articles saying,
[26:52.420 --> 26:56.100]  isn't it great that the seventh graders come home and tell their parents what to do
[26:56.100 --> 27:00.900]  and write them mock climate cop tickets for leaving the sink on while they brush their teeth
[27:00.900 --> 27:05.940]  or taking a hot bath. These are quotes and we have Al Gore saying, tell your parents
[27:06.660 --> 27:13.620]  that they're wrong about this. This is in the documents. Okay. The UN is in control of your
[27:13.620 --> 27:20.580]  local schools taking your children from you. Now, for this segment, the next, I want to bring
[27:20.580 --> 27:28.100]  Paul Watson up to go over this. This is so huge. And Paul, before we get into this, what's a good
[27:28.100 --> 27:34.580]  name for is people need a name. Climate gate was what it was dubbed a week and a half ago.
[27:34.580 --> 27:43.940]  What do you call this UN gate, UN dictatorship gate, dictatorship gate? I mean, what do we call
[27:43.940 --> 28:02.180]  it, Paul? Well, this is getting no attention. And I'm begging our incredible activist audience to
[28:02.180 --> 28:06.500]  get this article you've written that details it all and get it out to everyone they know.
[28:06.500 --> 28:12.180]  Bombshell UN documents outlined plan to use climate gate crux and in run around national
[28:12.180 --> 28:17.700]  sovereignty. I mean, we have them. We have them in the document talking about how to deceive the
[28:17.700 --> 28:24.580]  public. I mean, it's just outrageous. These arrogant crux, Paul Watson. Yeah, this is actually
[28:24.580 --> 28:31.140]  two separate documents that were put out by the United Nations Environment Program, UNEP,
[28:32.020 --> 28:40.100]  which is the regulatory body that established the IPCC, which of course produced the politicized
[28:40.100 --> 28:46.420]  reports saying that the lid was shut on global warming. It's a done deal. Now, that ties into
[28:46.420 --> 28:54.660]  climate gate because two days ago, the IPCC came out and said that despite the fact that the climate
[28:54.660 --> 29:00.980]  gate emails and the data reveals that these scientists who were closely affiliated with the
[29:00.980 --> 29:08.260]  IPCC, they produced the data for them. They were caught manipulating the data to hide the decline
[29:08.260 --> 29:14.260]  in global warming. That's the quote, hide the decline. And the fact that these scientists that
[29:14.260 --> 29:23.300]  were exposed in the climate gate scandal engaged in academic witch hunts to ensure that reports
[29:23.300 --> 29:29.460]  and data that they disagreed with was blocked from appearing in the IPCC's fourth assessment report.
[29:30.420 --> 29:34.180]  So they're directly tied into the scam and we'll talk about what's in these.
[29:34.180 --> 29:40.420]  Yes, this directly links the UN to their head climatology unit that fixed the numbers globally.
[29:40.980 --> 29:49.140]  This is amazing. UN documents directly link them to climate gate fraud. That's another important
[29:49.140 --> 29:57.540]  headline. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[32:00.900 --> 32:04.900]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[32:04.900 --> 32:09.620]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[32:09.620 --> 32:13.220]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[32:13.220 --> 32:18.660]  We have turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[32:18.660 --> 32:24.580]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[32:24.580 --> 32:30.340]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held
[32:30.340 --> 32:35.460]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[32:35.460 --> 32:39.780]  Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[32:39.780 --> 32:44.420]  who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington,
[32:44.420 --> 32:51.460]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[33:07.460 --> 33:10.740]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:18.980 --> 33:25.220]  Bombshell, U.N. documents outlined plan to use climate gate crooks in in run around national
[33:25.220 --> 33:30.260]  sovereignty. Strategy papers call for United Nations to boss economies and erect world government
[33:30.260 --> 33:35.700]  under pretext of environmentalism. Shocking, newly uncovered U.N. strategy documents reveal
[33:35.700 --> 33:40.660]  how elitist are recruiting members of academia from all over the globe in an effort to hide
[33:41.540 --> 33:48.260]  the end run. Remember the SPP documents say by stealth to hide, this is a quote, the end run
[33:49.220 --> 33:53.220]  around national sovereignty that their agendas represent, emphasizing how the climate gate
[33:53.220 --> 33:58.820]  crooks who were recently caught manipulating scientific data from the head U.N. research facility
[33:58.820 --> 34:04.740]  in order to hide the decline in global warming are working with the United Nations in pursuit
[34:04.740 --> 34:10.020]  of world government justified by the global warming fraud that they are helping to perpetuate.
[34:10.740 --> 34:15.300]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, that's all this is, is a global corporate takeover. The U.N.
[34:15.300 --> 34:19.940]  is a private corporate holding company of the IMF and World Bank themselves holding companies for
[34:19.940 --> 34:27.220]  private banks. And they're just taking over. One of the planning papers entitled the U.N. EP
[34:27.220 --> 34:34.820]  that we want was produced by a specially selective group of influential environmental bureaucrats
[34:34.820 --> 34:44.820]  and delivered to the U.N. EP executive director, Akeem Steiner. The United Nations Environment
[34:44.820 --> 34:49.700]  Program, U.N. EP is the regulatory body that established the Intergovernmental Panel on
[34:49.700 --> 34:56.500]  Climate Change, IPCC, the politicized organization that has attempted to slam the lid shut on global
[34:56.500 --> 35:01.540]  warming skeptics by claiming it is the supreme authority, despite the fact that scientists
[35:01.540 --> 35:07.460]  used by the IPCC were caught manipulating data and conspiring to hide evidence of global cooling
[35:07.460 --> 35:14.020]  during the climate gate scandal. The IPCC has attempted to deny the gravitas of climate gate
[35:14.020 --> 35:17.780]  by claiming that it has no bearing on the conclusions about global warming. Now, they just
[35:17.780 --> 35:22.180]  keep saying, we have peer review journals. We have peer review journals using the data directly
[35:22.180 --> 35:27.460]  from the head U.N. climate research facility in East Anglia and the Goddard Space Center in the U.S.
[35:29.860 --> 35:34.740]  Despite the fact that scientists at the University of East Anglia used intimidation and academic
[35:34.740 --> 35:38.580]  witch hunts to ensure that the data they didn't agree with politically was blocked
[35:38.580 --> 35:43.940]  from appearing in the IPCC's fourth assignment report, which was published in 2007. We're going
[35:43.940 --> 35:49.460]  back to Watson in a moment, but here's what's important. The U.N. got 25 select scientists
[35:49.460 --> 35:55.540]  out of hundreds of thousands of hydrologists, climatologists, geologists, atmospheric experts,
[35:57.860 --> 36:03.140]  meteorologists. Just 31,000 in the U.S. sent letters to Congress saying it was a fraud,
[36:03.140 --> 36:08.740]  so we have 31,000. They have 2,500 and they keep saying every scientist on Earth agrees with us.
[36:08.740 --> 36:13.540]  Just that's another giant hoax. These people say polar bears can't swim and they're all dying
[36:13.540 --> 36:19.140]  when their numbers are exploding. They say the North and South ice caps were going to melt by 2008.
[36:19.140 --> 36:24.900]  They're there bigger than ever. It's all lies. They point video cameras at glaciers
[36:24.900 --> 36:28.980]  that every year in the spring, it piles up during the winter and during the spring,
[36:28.980 --> 36:34.100]  it sluffs off icebergs. And they tell you, look, it's melting. They use parlor-level
[36:34.100 --> 36:39.620]  five-year-old tricks on you. I mean, Al Gore says he invented the Internet. He said NAFTA
[36:39.620 --> 36:44.420]  and GATT was going to be great. He's in league with Enron. Participants who contributed to the
[36:44.420 --> 36:51.220]  first UNEP document included Janos Pasteur, currently head of the team, pushing the U.N.
[36:51.220 --> 36:56.340]  Secretary General Bankai Moon's unprecedented Seal the Deal lobbying campaign to pressure the U.N.
[36:56.340 --> 37:00.980]  member governments into signing a new environmental agreement at Copenhagen. And it goes on. And then
[37:00.980 --> 37:05.380]  there's a whole other level of these documents that Paul's linked to where they talk about how
[37:05.380 --> 37:10.260]  to brainwash kids, how to have the kids rebuke their parents. These are quotes. Now I'm going to
[37:10.260 --> 37:15.060]  try to shut up, Paul. I'm going to turn my mic off for the next 10 minutes, and I want you to go over
[37:15.620 --> 37:21.460]  the latest on Climate Gate, how this ties into it, the open, their own document on how to brainwash
[37:21.460 --> 37:25.780]  kids, how to turn them against their parents. I mean, this is outrageous. The actual quotes
[37:26.340 --> 37:31.940]  go over all of that. And then how we see the brainwashing manifesting in the high schools,
[37:31.940 --> 37:37.140]  in the middle schools, mainstream news reporting how their kids come home and start singing,
[37:37.140 --> 37:40.980]  global warming's going to kill us. We've got to have the global government. I mean,
[37:40.980 --> 37:45.940]  they have the, I mean, this is like Mao Zedong took over. This is it. This is happening. Paul
[37:45.940 --> 37:52.660]  Joseph Watson, you've got the floor. Yeah, the key quote to arise are these newly uncovered
[37:52.660 --> 38:00.900]  documents. And bear in mind that they were produced two years ago. So everything that they lay out
[38:00.900 --> 38:06.740]  is already happening. They talk about tagging the environmental agenda to the economy,
[38:06.740 --> 38:12.580]  which is exactly what happened immediately after the collapse. They really push that because they
[38:12.580 --> 38:17.860]  can get their regulation through easier by saying it's also to save the economy and green jobs and
[38:17.860 --> 38:23.540]  all this kind of propaganda. So everything in there is already happening. Now, the main quote
[38:23.540 --> 38:29.780]  to arise out of it in relation to Climate Gate is they talk about how they have to
[38:29.780 --> 38:40.020]  get academics on board. The quote is they have to recruit the academic world in order that they
[38:40.020 --> 38:47.700]  can be, quote, harnessed to the UNEP mission without appearing to make an end run around the
[38:47.700 --> 38:55.460]  member government. Now, there's several we can break that down. Firstly, quote, harnessed to the UNEP
[38:55.460 --> 39:01.140]  mission. These are scientists that are supposed to produce unbiased, accurate, fair data about
[39:01.140 --> 39:07.700]  global warming. And yet the United Nations is talking about recruiting them and harnessing them
[39:07.700 --> 39:13.220]  to the UNEP mission. And what is the UNEP mission? Well, it's laid out in these documents,
[39:13.220 --> 39:19.300]  global regulatory powers over nation states in all areas of the environment and the economy.
[39:19.300 --> 39:25.540]  And then, quote, environmental breadth and width to the 21st century is about global government.
[39:25.540 --> 39:31.780]  So they're saying we need to get these academics on board so that they can help us create this
[39:31.780 --> 39:38.900]  global government without appearing. The keyword is appearing to make an end run around the member
[39:38.900 --> 39:44.980]  government. So they're basically admitting that it is making an end run around the member
[39:44.980 --> 39:50.580]  government, but they just don't want it to appear as if it's doing so by reaching out to these
[39:50.580 --> 39:55.700]  academics and hiring them and getting them to carry the propaganda about global warming.
[39:56.820 --> 40:02.820]  And the rest of the document is basically an outline of how they're going to erect this
[40:02.820 --> 40:09.220]  dictatorial, unelected, regulatory global government. And it ties in with the same
[40:09.220 --> 40:16.900]  method that they're pushing at Copenhagen, with reference to the reaching out to the children.
[40:17.700 --> 40:23.540]  Yesterday, there was an article in the New York Post, which we linked to in the first article I
[40:23.540 --> 40:28.740]  wrote about this, the headline of which is shocking UN document divulges climate court
[40:28.740 --> 40:35.860]  brainwashing. Now, it ties into this New York Post article because the New York Post writer
[40:35.860 --> 40:42.260]  Andrea Pazer wrote about how her daughter came home from school singing the words,
[40:42.260 --> 40:48.900]  you can hear the warning global warming. And basically, her daughter told her that at school
[40:48.900 --> 40:55.380]  they'd been coerced into learning and singing this song about global warming. And the kids
[40:55.380 --> 41:02.180]  had also been taught that their own parents were to blame for killing the polar bears. Of course,
[41:02.180 --> 41:08.260]  we know polar bears population are exploding at record levels, but they taught the kids that
[41:08.260 --> 41:13.140]  the parents were the enemy that they were to blame, which is exactly what the Club of Rome
[41:13.140 --> 41:19.700]  called for in their 1991 document, The First Global Revolution. They talked about making
[41:19.700 --> 41:26.420]  humanity the enemy and that that's what would sell the idea of climate change and global warming
[41:26.420 --> 41:34.980]  as a new enemy to mankind. So with these new documents, newly uncovered, as I said that
[41:34.980 --> 41:42.100]  they were written two years ago, but they've just come to life, they talk about how they need a core
[41:42.100 --> 41:50.420]  element of the program is an extensive propagandizing role for the UNEP that reaches beyond its
[41:50.420 --> 41:57.140]  member governments. Again, this is about the global government reaching into schools, reaches
[41:57.140 --> 42:02.660]  beyond its member governments and traditional environmental institutions to children and youth.
[42:03.460 --> 42:08.820]  And it says civil society, including children and youth in the private sector, will be reached
[42:08.820 --> 42:14.740]  through tail made outreach, products and campaigns. So they're talking about bypassing
[42:14.740 --> 42:21.220]  nation, state and member governments and local schools and local school authorities
[42:21.860 --> 42:27.380]  and just making this part of the curriculum, this climate called brainwashing, which is now
[42:27.380 --> 42:33.860]  manifesting itself. And Paul, just to interrupt briefly, I know you wrote a key article on this
[42:33.860 --> 42:39.620]  yesterday and I asked you to do a new detailed one with more of the background on this today.
[42:39.620 --> 42:46.340]  You did it in a hurry. I'm going to really promote this article. So beef it up with Al Gore caught
[42:46.340 --> 42:51.380]  brainwashing elementary kids to question their parents and boss them around that New York Times
[42:51.380 --> 42:56.980]  article where I want people to see this for themselves from the other side directly from them.
[42:56.980 --> 43:01.460]  Kathleen Sobellis saying, telling kids to go tell their parents they're wrong and everyone
[43:01.460 --> 43:06.500]  needs the flu shot. We need to post the New York Times where it describes the little girls coming
[43:06.500 --> 43:10.980]  home and telling their mother they can't have a hot bath and writing reports on them to the school.
[43:10.980 --> 43:16.420]  The climate cop ads in the US and in England where the kids are given red jackets just like
[43:17.460 --> 43:24.980]  City Year and told to report on their parents. We need to really show people that this is actually
[43:24.980 --> 43:32.420]  happening. The UN with federal funding in every nation state is brainwashing your children.
[43:32.420 --> 43:38.260]  They are going after them. You could pull up that statesman article from three or four months ago
[43:38.260 --> 43:44.820]  where a former special forces black ops CIA commander is now running the environmental
[43:44.820 --> 43:50.180]  takeover and carbon tax in Austin. And then I found a pattern of other cities putting Pentagon
[43:50.180 --> 43:58.180]  people in. I mean, this is a savage feudal system, military precision being run. And once they have
[43:58.180 --> 44:04.980]  your kids tattling on you for the environment, that's a way to break the ice. Now it's what's in
[44:04.980 --> 44:10.900]  mommy's medicine cabinet. Does mommy smoke cigarettes? Does mommy drink? I mean, ladies and
[44:10.900 --> 44:19.860]  gentlemen, this is 110% grade A thoroughbred, un-American total tyranny and it's going on in
[44:19.860 --> 44:25.060]  Australia, England, Europe, Canada, the US. It's a global system. That's what we always point out.
[44:25.060 --> 44:31.140]  The same names of the programs, the same talking points, the same system. It's globally directed.
[44:31.140 --> 44:39.220]  Paul Watson, continue. Yeah, don't forget the electricity companies and the big oil companies
[44:39.220 --> 44:44.020]  are on board as well. Yes, brainwashing the kids in free comic books, telling them to
[44:44.020 --> 44:48.740]  spy on their parents. Oh, and at the ABC news article where they teach the kids to commit
[44:48.740 --> 44:54.500]  suicide at 11 when their carbon credits run out at age 11, people won't believe that they must
[44:54.500 --> 44:58.580]  see how they're teaching the children how to kill themselves. These people are, I mean,
[44:58.580 --> 45:03.780]  folks, you're supposed to freak out about this. This is insane. Wake up. Get angry. I'm sorry,
[45:03.780 --> 45:12.260]  Paul. Go ahead. Yeah, electricity gas company N Power had a program called climate cops where
[45:12.260 --> 45:18.500]  the kids would inform and compile reports on their parents if they, as he said, had a hot bath or
[45:18.500 --> 45:26.100]  used the heating for too long. And then there's a regulatory level which is going to come to us
[45:26.100 --> 45:32.180]  and be in our faces on a day-to-day basis. In England, they're introducing fines for if you
[45:32.180 --> 45:39.620]  leave your car on idle. Say it's a cold day. It's been snowing your windows iced up. You want to warm
[45:39.620 --> 45:46.580]  your car up. If you leave it on for more than two minutes without being in it, it's fine. Environmental
[45:46.580 --> 45:52.740]  cops will find you for that. And that's the level of tyranny that it's going to be coming to
[45:52.740 --> 45:57.620]  when they get all this through after Copenhagen and in the coming years. And it's already happening.
[46:04.260 --> 46:09.700]  So, I mean, the rest of these documents, the information in them, as I said, is bombshell.
[46:09.700 --> 46:17.620]  The only report that was done on it was Fox News that was any kind of incisive report
[46:17.620 --> 46:24.660]  talking about what's actually in it. And as part of the course, they talk about how they need to
[46:25.220 --> 46:34.180]  raise finances from global warming hysteria and that's how they will fund the mechanism of global
[46:34.180 --> 46:42.020]  government. So, again, it's coming out of cap and trade. It's their funding, slush fund for the
[46:42.020 --> 46:49.220]  global government. They talk about efforts at local, national, global levels to raise
[46:49.220 --> 46:54.260]  quote, sufficient finance to meet environmental challenges, including climate change. So,
[46:54.260 --> 47:00.820]  they're saying they need to get more money out of it to grease the skids of the tyrannical,
[47:00.820 --> 47:06.340]  authoritarian global system that they're building. And, I mean, that's evident
[47:07.460 --> 47:15.380]  with another report that we put out today where the UN has banned World Net Daily and Jerome
[47:15.380 --> 47:21.620]  Corsey, who is a two-time New York bestseller number one. And he's also reported on previous
[47:21.620 --> 47:27.380]  events at the UN. But they've banned him from even attending and reporting on
[47:27.380 --> 47:34.820]  the Copenhagen summit because they claim that World Net Daily is linked to this
[47:36.340 --> 47:41.860]  Western capitalist media organization. I forgot the name of it, but it's
[47:42.500 --> 47:46.740]  so it's fine to be political. In fact, if you're not a supporter of the UN, you don't get to be
[47:46.740 --> 47:51.140]  part of the select media. They're admitting that if you have any links, even if they're made up,
[47:51.140 --> 47:55.300]  to anyone that disagrees with them, you can't come and we have their, we have their letter.
[47:55.300 --> 48:02.260]  Yeah. They're basically saying, you know, you only have free speech in the new order if you agree
[48:02.260 --> 48:07.780]  with what the globalists are doing. Well, remember the European Parliament last week with the
[48:07.780 --> 48:11.540]  British member of the European Parliament? He brought up the fact that it was unelected and
[48:11.540 --> 48:16.740]  a fraud. And they said, we're turning your mic off. You're not allowed to criticize people.
[48:16.740 --> 48:20.340]  Now we're going to cut to the lady from Poland. And she goes, you're a monkey in a tree. We can
[48:20.340 --> 48:27.780]  see your rear end. And everyone laughs at him. And so, I mean, again, totally rigged. They're
[48:27.780 --> 48:33.860]  allowed to do whatever they want. This is the new Soviet Union. Well, the EU passed a ruling that
[48:33.860 --> 48:42.340]  says it's illegal to criticize the EU. So when the UKIP member last week, Nigel Farage was
[48:42.340 --> 48:49.460]  criticizing, he dared to criticize Van Rompuy and the other, you know, his right-hand woman,
[48:49.460 --> 48:55.860]  who's never been elected to any position, political position in her life. He criticized them and
[48:55.860 --> 49:00.740]  they basically reprimanded him and cut his mic because it's illegal to criticize the EU.
[49:01.380 --> 49:07.620]  And that's exactly what the UN is now mirroring by barring anyone who expresses skepticism
[49:07.620 --> 49:14.020]  towards global warming from the Copenhagen event next week. Paul, there is no doubt this is classical
[49:14.020 --> 49:18.820]  tyranny. Great article you've written. I want everybody to make it go mega viral. I'm going to
[49:18.820 --> 49:24.580]  do a YouTube later today, part two on Climate Gate with this bombshell that I'm asking listeners
[49:24.580 --> 49:29.700]  to just absolutely get out to everyone. And I want to just salute the great work you're doing,
[49:29.700 --> 49:34.260]  but beef it up, add more to the article so people get the full picture of what's happening,
[49:34.260 --> 49:38.900]  because they really are brainwashing your children right now. All the public schools are
[49:38.900 --> 49:44.100]  federalized. They're independent in name only. They're teaching your children songs about worshiping
[49:44.100 --> 49:50.500]  Obama and worshiping the UN and how carbon dioxide is evil. Nickelodeon has all these messages, TV,
[49:51.380 --> 49:56.660]  the mainline TV shows, Al Gore up there saying we've got to pass the Copenhagen tax. I mean,
[49:56.660 --> 50:02.340]  this is a full court press. They're attempting to take over right now. Climate Gate documents are
[50:02.340 --> 50:07.780]  a godsend. It has blown a huge hole in their entire facade, but we've got to go through that breach
[50:08.340 --> 50:13.700]  and continue to press the issue. Paul, what's your gut on this? I mean, do you think they're
[50:13.700 --> 50:18.100]  going to be able to get a lot of signatories to this and ram it through or is this thing really
[50:18.100 --> 50:24.340]  starting to flounder? Well, they were already saying they wouldn't get it through before Climate
[50:24.340 --> 50:31.780]  Gate, so it's highly unlikely that they're going to get it through now. So they'll just try and,
[50:31.780 --> 50:36.260]  you know, how they do it. They do it. They take two steps forward and one step back,
[50:36.260 --> 50:41.380]  and if they don't get what they want, then they just introduce the exact same thing again under a
[50:41.380 --> 50:46.740]  deceptive heading the year down the line like they did with the Lisbon Treaty. So they'll just
[50:46.740 --> 50:52.260]  try and get it through piecemeal. Exactly. And they'll also, through the states and sub-bureaucracies,
[50:52.260 --> 50:56.100]  the regions implement it, which they're already doing, Schwarzenegger running around,
[50:56.100 --> 51:02.180]  banning and taxing television sets. Great job, Paul Watson. Hey, folks, this is Alex Jones,
[51:02.180 --> 51:06.420]  and I want to tell you about Oxy Silver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr.
[51:06.420 --> 51:10.740]  Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable. You've heard Dr. Leonard
[51:10.740 --> 51:16.260]  Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance. Instead, use vitamin Cd and Oxy Silver along
[51:16.260 --> 51:22.020]  with Zeolife for broad spectrum detoxification. Using NASA science, Oxy Silver is nano silver
[51:22.020 --> 51:27.700]  covalently bonded to water. Oxy Silver safely electrocutes pathogens, oxygenates for faster
[51:27.700 --> 51:33.700]  healing, then delivers a 528 Hertz frequency homeopathic-like energy. The Dr. Horowitz proves
[51:33.700 --> 51:38.260]  his fundamental to life in recovering health. He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and
[51:38.260 --> 51:43.540]  GIFlora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity. Help others and earn extra income. Become a

[54:04.180 --> 54:10.420]  This is a world government takeover. Alert, alert, alert battle stations.
[54:10.420 --> 54:16.420]  This is a tyrannical, oppressive group of criminals who in every one of their textbooks and
[54:16.420 --> 54:22.180]  white papers that we link to daily at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com,
[54:24.420 --> 54:33.620]  they talk about how world government is only the beginning. Once their world government is in
[54:33.620 --> 54:38.900]  place, you will live worse than they live in communist China. One child policies, carbon credit
[54:38.900 --> 54:48.580]  taxes, with a national ID card tracking everything you do, everything you buy, it is mind blowing.
[54:48.580 --> 54:52.980]  But the good news is people are finally talking about world government. They're finally reading
[54:52.980 --> 54:57.780]  the U.N. documents. They're finally listening to the U.N. Secretary General when he brags about
[54:57.780 --> 55:05.940]  what they're doing. These arrogant creatures think that they've defeated us and we may stop.
[55:05.940 --> 55:09.700]  I believe Obama's going to sign the treaty. They still have to ratify it. And then he's going to
[55:09.700 --> 55:15.380]  have the bureaucracy, which they're already doing, implement it. And you're going to have to fight it
[55:15.380 --> 55:19.940]  at the state level, the county level, the city level, the federal level, the international level.
[55:20.500 --> 55:25.940]  As Lord Moncton talked about globally, a freedom party in every nation against the new world order,
[55:25.940 --> 55:31.220]  against the globalist, against the crux. We have forced this issue out in the open. As Lord
[55:31.220 --> 55:36.340]  Moncton said, they're being forced to admit their plan more and more because we have exposed them.
[55:39.060 --> 55:43.700]  And you need to also, ladies and gentlemen, support freedom fighters, support people that
[55:43.700 --> 55:48.260]  are telling the truth. We've got Mike Rivera coming up via video link. We're going to go live
[55:48.260 --> 55:54.420]  at prismplanet.tv at eight after. So you'll have two hours and 52 minutes of live TV,
[55:54.420 --> 56:03.780]  simulcasting with a radio show. And we need to expand our operations and we expand our operations
[56:03.780 --> 56:09.140]  with your funding, your support by supporting the sponsors, by supporting the bookstore,
[56:09.140 --> 56:15.300]  the video store, by buying the DVDs, the films. By the way, we've sold out of four sizes of the
[56:15.300 --> 56:24.180]  Obama Joker t-shirts. It's a limited edition. We're never printing it again. We've sold out
[56:24.180 --> 56:32.260]  of four sizes, but we still have a lot of sizes available. And I've decided to add the co pepper
[56:32.260 --> 56:37.380]  minute man don't tread on me shirts. That's being added right now to the online shopping
[56:37.380 --> 56:42.900]  cart info wars.com for a limited time. I'm not going to discontinue those though. I'm going to offer
[56:43.620 --> 56:49.940]  a bunch of different designs of the don't tread on me flag shirts that have info wars.com on them
[56:49.940 --> 56:54.100]  to spread the word on the street and meet like minded people. You get one of those shirts free

[1:01:27.140 --> 1:01:31.940]  a red herring they're talking about a new war tax we're going to go over that we're going to go

[1:02:09.460 --> 1:02:13.300]  are going to sign it and then ratify it at their legislative parliamentary level
[1:02:14.500 --> 1:02:20.660]  how do we beat this at the public school and college level where the un has been caught redhanded
[1:02:20.660 --> 1:02:25.060]  in secret documents now this is his biggest climate gate about how they've taken over
[1:02:25.060 --> 1:02:30.900]  all the scientists how they're brainwashing kids how this is communism how they're they're

[1:09:06.820 --> 1:09:12.660]  fraud the earth is getting colder here's how you fool the data here's how you hide the decline as
[1:09:12.660 --> 1:09:18.180]  we've been ordered to do they gave it to other countries now new zealand has been caught manipulating
[1:09:18.180 --> 1:09:25.460]  their numbers to fit now we have the official united nations documents that are in an article
[1:09:25.460 --> 1:09:31.060]  written by paul joseph watson bombshell un documents outline plan to use climate gate crux
[1:09:31.060 --> 1:09:37.780]  and end run around national sovereignty and in here they talk about how to go out and this
[1:09:37.780 --> 1:09:44.020]  and politically get control of all the scientists this was years ago how to get them on the payroll
[1:09:44.020 --> 1:09:49.460]  for world government how this is world communism how it's meant to shut down freedom how they've
[1:09:49.460 --> 1:09:54.820]  got to do this by stealth that it's to set it up so the un can make all the world rules and make all
[1:09:54.820 --> 1:10:00.580]  the laws the un itself a private holding company for private central banks engage in a private
[1:10:00.580 --> 1:10:06.660]  corporate takeover of the planet this article is so important and then secondarily in the
[1:10:06.660 --> 1:10:13.940]  un documents that have just now surfaced that the un admits are theirs and this is all admitted
[1:10:15.060 --> 1:10:19.220]  they talk about how to take over your children and then we see al gore giving speeches to
[1:10:19.220 --> 1:10:22.820]  elementary kids about don't listen to your parents you teach them that the earth is dying
[1:10:22.820 --> 1:10:28.100]  we've got to have the tax he's all over tv promoting it he's in dramas sitcoms the news
[1:10:28.100 --> 1:10:33.620]  it comes out the government's paying for this this is hardcore program that's worse than the
[1:10:33.620 --> 1:10:38.180]  soviet union i mean at least there they admitted they were doing it here they try to hide it but
[1:10:38.180 --> 1:10:45.620]  it is publicly available so that's going on it's kind of a public secret we have the new york
[1:10:45.620 --> 1:10:50.020]  times bragging how kids are trained seventh graders to come home and tell their mom you
[1:10:50.020 --> 1:10:55.220]  can't have a hot bath and to write them climate tickets and bring it back to their teachers and
[1:10:55.220 --> 1:11:00.900]  report on them we already knew this was being implemented globally because it's the same programs
[1:11:00.900 --> 1:11:05.860]  everywhere but now we have the internal un documents it is up to the viewers and the
[1:11:05.860 --> 1:11:12.420]  listeners of this radio slash tv transmission just like you helped drive climate gate out
[1:11:12.420 --> 1:11:18.020]  like no one else and it's up to all the activist sites the libertarians conservatives true liberals
[1:11:18.020 --> 1:11:21.780]  people that want freedom people that are shattering the left right paradigm that want justice
[1:11:21.780 --> 1:11:30.740]  to get this latest un world government gate un takeover of the children gate you know un
[1:11:30.740 --> 1:11:35.460]  children gate hell the un's always caught running child kidnapping rings i'm not talking about that
[1:11:35.460 --> 1:11:41.380]  child kidnapping gate but this child takeover this brainwashing gate from australia to
[1:11:41.380 --> 1:11:48.100]  canada to england to the u.s to germany it's global to japan we are under global management
[1:11:48.100 --> 1:11:52.580]  they're just admitting the world government now mike revero of what really happened dot com joining
[1:11:52.580 --> 1:12:00.900]  us from hawaii uh via video skype uh mike i mean the magnitude of these documents first i want to
[1:12:00.900 --> 1:12:06.580]  get your take on how we help push this out to everyone to show how the un and their own documents
[1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:12.820]  is talking about how they recruited scientists to fix the data this completes the circuit of fraud
[1:12:12.820 --> 1:12:19.460]  from nasa and the u.s government to the un to england and so a how do we get this out be
[1:12:20.740 --> 1:12:25.380]  your take on climate gate and these latest revelations as just like with watergate or
[1:12:25.380 --> 1:12:31.700]  something the deeper we dig the worse it gets yeah it is absolutely a monumental scandal
[1:12:31.700 --> 1:12:36.660]  right now and it is important to get all of this information out there it is important to get to
[1:12:36.660 --> 1:12:42.260]  people who normally do not get their news off the internet and get this to them as well we're in an
[1:12:42.260 --> 1:12:47.780]  absolute war it is an information war right now the corporate media with the exception of fox news
[1:12:48.420 --> 1:12:53.140]  and a couple of uh individual organizations like wall street journalists covering this with a great
[1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:57.780]  deal of fairness and objectivity but for the most part the corporate media is still trying as hard
[1:12:57.780 --> 1:13:02.500]  as they can to put a lid on this they're still trying to sell copenhagen is a good thing they're
[1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:07.140]  trying to get this through it's a bum's rush they're trying to get it done as fast as they can before
[1:13:07.140 --> 1:13:12.500]  the rest of the world wakes up to what's going on and just talking to everybody posting everywhere
[1:13:12.500 --> 1:13:18.100]  flood the net call your newspapers just get in their faces and let them know you know there's
[1:13:18.100 --> 1:13:25.060]  a huge monumental fraud going on here now with regard to climate gate uh the the global warming
[1:13:25.060 --> 1:13:31.300]  hoax if you will was one of three pillars on which this push for global government was built
[1:13:31.300 --> 1:13:37.220]  the other two were swine 11 the phony global pandemic which hasn't really worked out and
[1:13:37.220 --> 1:13:42.260]  of course the global financial crisis so right now the global government agenda is in serious
[1:13:42.260 --> 1:13:48.740]  serious trouble they see this fight over climate gate as possibly being uh the final battle because
[1:13:48.740 --> 1:13:53.540]  of the global warming hoax becomes exposed to the whole public and that pillar collapses
[1:13:53.540 --> 1:13:58.580]  then the whole global government agenda is going to start unraveling and coming apart
[1:13:58.580 --> 1:14:02.580]  now the thing i've been telling my listeners and my readers over at my website is really very
[1:14:02.580 --> 1:14:07.540]  simple that for everybody who ever said oh the government doesn't engage in such massive
[1:14:07.540 --> 1:14:12.740]  conspiracies you've got one right in front of you staked out for all the world to see
[1:14:12.740 --> 1:14:18.660]  and after you look at this with government the media and it wasn't just hadly cru new zealands
[1:14:18.660 --> 1:14:24.820]  climate research centers been compromised noa has been caught fudging uh their data it is truly
[1:14:24.820 --> 1:14:30.180]  a massive conspiracy to trick the people of the world into accepting the yoke of global taxation
[1:14:30.180 --> 1:14:34.980]  and global government look at this and then ask what else have they been lying to us about
[1:14:34.980 --> 1:14:40.660]  and more importantly if they get away with it this time what else will they lie to us about in the
[1:14:40.660 --> 1:14:46.980]  future and mike expanding on a point you just made there's all these famous fbi hidden video
[1:14:46.980 --> 1:14:57.540]  uh clips of the mafia new york and new jersey and illinois meeting around a pool tables or in bars
[1:14:57.540 --> 1:15:02.580]  talking about murders they've committed talking about whores they're running talking about drugs
[1:15:02.580 --> 1:15:09.620]  they're bringing in talking about cops and judges they're buying we have that with the climate gate
[1:15:09.620 --> 1:15:14.580]  emails and the computer program with the notes for those that don't know computer programs
[1:15:14.580 --> 1:15:20.740]  if there's glitches in them or designed fraud there'll be internal manuals just like dibold got
[1:15:20.740 --> 1:15:26.580]  caught with the programs with internal messages to how to manipulate things they have been caught
[1:15:26.580 --> 1:15:35.300]  in spades red-handed across the board in premeditated fraud from the head un climate change facility
[1:15:35.300 --> 1:15:42.900]  that they chose who would announce the bench line fraud and then everyone else in in un controlled
[1:15:42.900 --> 1:15:48.180]  academia would then line up and parrot that and fix their data along with it and now we have the
[1:15:48.180 --> 1:15:54.100]  latest un documents where they're talking about fixing the data with all the regional groups i
[1:15:54.100 --> 1:16:02.180]  mean this is a giant 30-year takeover program that is now blowing up before our eyes and this is
[1:16:02.180 --> 1:16:07.780]  beautiful yeah it absolutely is that this is mother nature telling al gore booga booga because
[1:16:07.780 --> 1:16:12.900]  obviously the earth has been cooling for the last nine to ten years it's forces them to talk about
[1:16:12.900 --> 1:16:18.100]  hiding the decline because if you think about what is really invested i mean look at all the people
[1:16:18.100 --> 1:16:23.140]  who have put their own personal fortunes into these new green industries al gore is heavily
[1:16:23.140 --> 1:16:29.540]  invested in his brokerage obama is hooked in with this climate chicago climate exchange operation
[1:16:29.540 --> 1:16:33.700]  they've all put their money into it it's the new big moneymaker plus you've got the global
[1:16:33.700 --> 1:16:39.060]  government agenda there are trillions of dollars on the line here and they're seeing it all blow up
[1:16:39.060 --> 1:16:43.140]  in front of their faces just because the earth happened to get cooler well these people didn't
[1:16:43.140 --> 1:16:46.820]  become rich and powerful by letting a little thing like the truth get in their way so they're
[1:16:46.820 --> 1:16:51.060]  out there just trying to propagandize this thing they're already out there spinning saying well
[1:16:51.060 --> 1:16:56.180]  okay we caught a few bad scientists but we have all this other data which says what we wanted to
[1:16:56.180 --> 1:17:01.620]  say here but common sense has to tell you if you have 10 reports that all say the same thing and
[1:17:01.620 --> 1:17:06.820]  one is a proven fraud then the other nine are going to be a fraud as well and then we have the
[1:17:06.820 --> 1:17:13.220]  latest un document internal document not for publication which the un confirms has now been
[1:17:13.220 --> 1:17:18.660]  released where they're going back over the last few years getting all their scientists lined up
[1:17:18.660 --> 1:17:24.580]  recruiting them like secret agents to be part of this political takeover for global governance
[1:17:24.580 --> 1:17:30.820]  we have them red-handed yes we absolutely do and people should be very very angry about this
[1:17:30.820 --> 1:17:35.860]  not only because of the push for global enslavement because when you talk about taking taxes away
[1:17:35.860 --> 1:17:41.380]  from people on the basis of a hoax and giving thing back that's slavery i mean they're in there
[1:17:41.380 --> 1:17:44.820]  they're going to be in there raking in the trillions of dollars in carbon taxes and saying yeah yeah
[1:17:44.820 --> 1:17:47.780]  yeah we're saving you from global warming give me the money we're saving you from global warming
[1:17:47.780 --> 1:17:54.580]  here it's a hoax and that is a form of enslavement it is a covert form of enslavement but it is still
[1:17:54.580 --> 1:18:00.420]  planetary enslavement that's what they're trying to do and people should be furious about this right
[1:18:00.420 --> 1:18:06.260]  now anger is the appropriate survival response and i just want to point out to everybody
[1:18:06.260 --> 1:18:11.780]  that we've been right about this all along we have been here telling the truth that it was a
[1:18:11.780 --> 1:18:16.100]  fraud that it was for global government that it was a way to wage war against humanity it was a
[1:18:16.100 --> 1:18:20.820]  way to give us carbon credits with national ID cards to track everything we were saying and doing
[1:18:21.540 --> 1:18:26.500]  and we were only going off their own documents now they're caught out in the open because now
[1:18:26.500 --> 1:18:30.980]  they're to the point of where they can't deny it anymore because they're openly taking over
[1:18:30.980 --> 1:18:35.460]  and right at their weak point when they were going from denying it to admitting it this
[1:18:35.460 --> 1:18:40.900]  blows up in their face and more and more the evidence shows and mainstream media is reporting
[1:18:40.900 --> 1:18:47.540]  this as you mentioned that that the british government said oh this was a hack so that
[1:18:47.540 --> 1:18:55.540]  they could try to cloud the providence of these internal documents and emails and block it from
[1:18:55.540 --> 1:19:01.300]  being admissible in court but now it's coming out that the scientists admit it is their emails it is
[1:19:01.300 --> 1:19:07.140]  their documents and that in the emails there are other scientists junior scientists in these universities
[1:19:07.140 --> 1:19:13.780]  saying this is illegal we shouldn't be doing this and that it's those scientists that leaked this
[1:19:13.780 --> 1:19:18.820]  because there was just the four year request a few months ago that was criminally blocked
[1:19:18.820 --> 1:19:22.820]  with the british government and the university of east anglia and so people said i'm not going
[1:19:22.820 --> 1:19:28.180]  to engage in fraud for you and that this was given to the police this was given to the bbc
[1:19:28.180 --> 1:19:33.780]  six weeks ago seven weeks ago now and they criminally blocked it so now the conspiracy
[1:19:34.420 --> 1:19:40.100]  of fraud is getting bigger and as the criminals try to cover it up the charges are racking up
[1:19:41.220 --> 1:19:45.860]  it is becoming very obvious i mean we used to say the fastest way to expose a dictator make
[1:19:45.860 --> 1:19:51.860]  them act like one in public they're doing it right now yeah what about the un saying if you

[1:24:29.460 --> 1:24:34.820]  i want to open the phones up in the next segment but only on climate gait i want that to be the
[1:24:34.820 --> 1:24:44.500]  main focus in this hour uh only on this situation with the new united nations documents where they're
[1:24:44.500 --> 1:24:49.220]  organizing a global government corporate takeover from state government federal government local
[1:24:49.220 --> 1:24:54.180]  government right down to your children how to turn your children against you now if this doesn't
[1:24:54.180 --> 1:24:59.540]  make you angry folks i don't know what does creating a false consensus micro vero where do you see
[1:24:59.540 --> 1:25:04.500]  this going as their banking takeover blows up in their faces their global warming tax blows up in
[1:25:04.500 --> 1:25:12.260]  their face as their but obama doesn't care 34 000 more troops to afghanistan yeah obama has already
[1:25:12.260 --> 1:25:17.540]  indicated he is just fully in accord with this agenda remember when he was campaigning for
[1:25:17.540 --> 1:25:21.940]  president he said i'm going to end the war and you can take that to the bank now he's sending
[1:25:21.940 --> 1:25:27.300]  another 30 000 troops into afghanistan he's going to kopenhagen his white house spokes people are
[1:25:27.300 --> 1:25:31.460]  standing there with their hair on fire regarding climate gait and insisting they can't smell any
[1:25:31.460 --> 1:25:34.980]  smoke they're saying oh well the science has settled we're going to go in and we're going to
[1:25:34.980 --> 1:25:39.460]  sign away in your sovereignty now the important thing for people to understand and again getting
[1:25:39.460 --> 1:25:43.780]  angry right now is appropriate because it's obvious they're going to steamroller this plan
[1:25:43.780 --> 1:25:49.300]  through regardless of the fact that everybody knows it's a fake and a hoax their attitude is well as
[1:25:49.300 --> 1:26:03.860]  long as they're well we just lost mike revero from hawaii just a few years ago video skype
[1:26:04.500 --> 1:26:12.900]  cut out every 30 seconds now it cuts off every 20 30 minutes but hey that is the magic of
[1:26:12.900 --> 1:26:19.140]  technology that i can be sitting here in austin texas going out on satellites to am and fm stations
[1:26:19.140 --> 1:26:26.820]  global shortwave satellite internet at info wars dot com at prison planet dot com we can connect to
[1:26:26.820 --> 1:26:34.580]  mike in hawaii on an island three four thousand miles out in the middle of the pacific ocean
[1:26:35.700 --> 1:26:41.780]  that that can be beamed to satellites or through undersea cables into our studio and out to you
[1:26:41.780 --> 1:26:50.980]  instantaneously that is certainly something very very exciting so uh that happens occasionally we
[1:26:50.980 --> 1:26:55.060]  just did over a phone line it wouldn't be cutting out but i know the prison planet dot tv viewers
[1:26:55.060 --> 1:27:04.100]  like to be able to see mike revero complete with his uh hula shirt i tell you i got to envy him
[1:27:04.100 --> 1:27:08.820]  living out in hawaii but we couldn't live in hawaii because the cost of living is too high
[1:27:08.820 --> 1:27:14.500]  i wouldn't be able to run this office the way we do texas is pretty cheap folks very uh
[1:27:16.100 --> 1:27:22.500]  very low cost of living comparatively austin great place to have our operation if we lived
[1:27:22.500 --> 1:27:29.380]  in new york or city or los angeles and ran this operation out of hawaii somewhere like that plus
[1:27:29.380 --> 1:27:35.940]  i'm a texan i love texas but i i do envy mike revero and uh living out in in hawaii the problem
[1:27:35.940 --> 1:27:41.940]  is i live in hawaii i'd be swimming every day probably even try to take up surfing i know i'd
[1:27:41.940 --> 1:27:48.580]  be scuba diving every week so maybe it's a good thing i'm here in the texas and i'm here in the
[1:27:48.580 --> 1:27:56.820]  texas uh hill country but uh we are we are getting uh mike revero line back up and if there's any
[1:27:56.820 --> 1:27:59.940]  problems we'll just go ahead and go to regular phone line with him you know we can we can always do
[1:27:59.940 --> 1:28:05.780]  that we can okay great we got mike via the phone okay mike you got cut off uh mike revero
[1:28:05.780 --> 1:28:11.780]  joining us by telephone from hawaii finish up your point okay well my point is very simple
[1:28:11.780 --> 1:28:17.620]  it is a founding principle of the united states of america that we were all raised to cherish
[1:28:17.620 --> 1:28:22.900]  that governments rule with the consent of the govern and you need to look at everything the
[1:28:22.900 --> 1:28:28.660]  united nations is doing regarding the the imposition of a global government none of it is being done
[1:28:28.660 --> 1:28:33.780]  with the consent of the people they're trying to trick us into going along by creating these
[1:28:33.780 --> 1:28:39.700]  false monsters of human cause global warming so that we'll feel guilty and say yeah i guess we
[1:28:39.700 --> 1:28:44.820]  got to do it or they're going to try and scare us with the global pandemic so that we'll run to
[1:28:44.820 --> 1:28:50.500]  them and say please please save us from the nasty virus or they'll crash the economy and say so
[1:28:50.500 --> 1:28:54.900]  that we'll run to them and say please give us give us some bread give us some water so that we
[1:28:54.900 --> 1:29:00.500]  can survive another day and it's not being done with our consent it's being done with trickery
[1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:07.060]  and deception and the manufacturing of a false consent out of fear this is not democracy it is
[1:29:07.060 --> 1:29:13.620]  not even republic it is the imposition of a global oligarchy and it is being done through fraud
[1:29:13.620 --> 1:29:20.260]  everybody listening to the show should be furious right now you should be angry i mean screw anger
[1:29:20.260 --> 1:29:25.940]  management i am seriously kicked off here and so should you be and if you're not angry about this
[1:29:25.940 --> 1:29:32.020]  what's wrong with you you know i was just about to make that point when you made that point mike
[1:29:32.020 --> 1:29:37.460]  we're on the same page i yell and scream i get angry because we're meant to get angry over
[1:29:37.460 --> 1:29:44.180]  being usurped being enslaved by a bunch of swindling degenerate parasites caught red-handed
[1:29:44.180 --> 1:29:50.020]  and they're just continuing on with their fraud everybody needs to stop just accepting this tyranny

[1:33:18.180 --> 1:33:24.980]  aid but some of these other issues obama sent close to 40 000 additional us troops to afghanistan
[1:33:25.700 --> 1:33:30.420]  in the last 11 months but the media never talked about that we would just see little blurbs
[1:33:30.420 --> 1:33:35.940]  about incremental four thousand five thousand ten thousand two thousand and they've sent more
[1:33:35.940 --> 1:33:43.860]  un troops they've sent uh you know more nato forces they've hired more afghan troops over
[1:33:43.860 --> 1:33:49.220]  three hundred and forty thousand troops now the associated press reports against the taliban
[1:33:49.220 --> 1:33:55.060]  outnumbering them 12 to 1 but the taliban doesn't even really exist there's just different tribes
[1:33:55.060 --> 1:34:00.180]  out there it's on record that most of the taliban is working for the coalition forces the
[1:34:00.180 --> 1:34:05.700]  war is over the pipeline it's over the opium it's over the black hole of profit that this war
[1:34:05.700 --> 1:34:11.780]  causes this huge racket as spedley butler so eloquently said but now obama has announced 34
[1:34:11.780 --> 1:34:16.980]  thousand additional that we're never leaving afghanistan that they're going to escalate it now
[1:34:16.980 --> 1:34:22.660]  they've announced russia's giving advisors they're giving black shark attack helicopters their latest
[1:34:22.660 --> 1:34:30.820]  type hind just crazy alliances going on what is afghanistan really about and what are all the
[1:34:30.820 --> 1:34:37.700]  lefty saying now about their god obama the anti-war guy escalating and keeping us in iraq well i
[1:34:37.700 --> 1:34:42.340]  think a lot of attention is focusing on a statement obama made last week where he's going to finish
[1:34:42.340 --> 1:34:47.620]  the job and everybody's saying what job why are we there is that the no opium poppy left behind
[1:34:47.620 --> 1:34:54.180]  concept uh... we really don't know why we're in there except that politically obama doesn't
[1:34:54.180 --> 1:34:58.500]  want to be the president who lost another war more and more observers are saying that afghanistan
[1:34:58.500 --> 1:35:05.380]  is starting to shape up like a new vietnam and uh... you know linden johnson took a huge hit
[1:35:05.380 --> 1:35:10.980]  for vietnam and so did richard nixon so nobody wants to be the president in charge of a losing
[1:35:10.980 --> 1:35:16.420]  war even though obama promised he was going to end the war and bring our troops home now maybe his
[1:35:16.420 --> 1:35:21.780]  promise was that he thought he could win a quick decisive victory in afghanistan despite its long
[1:35:21.780 --> 1:35:26.420]  history to the contrary and he could bring his uh... the the kids home that way but it's obvious
[1:35:26.420 --> 1:35:31.060]  that whatever obama is doing he is not listening to the people and that is what he's supposed to be
[1:35:31.060 --> 1:35:42.740]  doing well that's well said mike uh... expanding on that we have these different democrats saying
[1:35:42.740 --> 1:35:47.300]  that and now republicans are saying they're looking at it may agree to it
[1:35:47.300 --> 1:35:56.420]  here's a headline g o p wages internal debate over tax increase for afghan war obey congressman obey
[1:35:57.380 --> 1:36:03.940]  that that's really his name tells obama afghanistan war tax or no surge so they're saying
[1:36:04.500 --> 1:36:08.420]  you can have your surge but we're gonna have another tax i mean how many taxes
[1:36:08.420 --> 1:36:14.660]  is has obama raised uh... i mean he he's lied about everything all he's doing is raising people's
[1:36:14.660 --> 1:36:20.340]  taxes well there they're not so much raising them as they're simply adding new ones all the time i
[1:36:20.340 --> 1:36:25.460]  mean this latest one they want to do a carbon tax it's a tax literally on the air there they've
[1:36:25.460 --> 1:36:30.340]  run out of things to tax we've run out of money to pay the taxes for the government is broke
[1:36:30.340 --> 1:36:33.700]  uh... there was a breaking story just before we went to air time where they're talking about a
[1:36:33.700 --> 1:36:39.460]  major major uplift on the government's official debt ceiling which we know they've already violated
[1:36:39.460 --> 1:36:44.660]  many times over the bottom line is they're out of money they can't get any money they're trying
[1:36:44.660 --> 1:36:50.260]  to come to us to loot the last few nickels out of our pockets all government knows how to do is
[1:36:50.260 --> 1:36:56.580]  raise taxes and take money that's all they do that's all they know how to do and they're absolutely
[1:36:56.580 --> 1:37:06.900]  never going to stop until we make them stop but again i go back to this question on every front
[1:37:07.460 --> 1:37:12.740]  the government is openly corrupt openly run by foreign corporate interest openly setting up
[1:37:12.740 --> 1:37:18.660]  world government openly expanding the empire openly setting up a police state domestically
[1:37:18.660 --> 1:37:24.420]  and no matter what we do they just accelerate their program and i guess they're counting on
[1:37:24.420 --> 1:37:30.820]  north com to keep people under control real unemployment's over 22 percent msnbc admits
[1:37:30.820 --> 1:37:38.020]  and cnbc admits it's 17 plus percent uh... i mean where is all this going mike well i think the
[1:37:38.020 --> 1:37:42.420]  the game plan right now when we're seeing this certainly with the climate gate stonewalling
[1:37:42.420 --> 1:37:46.820]  is their ideas we're just going to do what we're going to do anyway and they're basically relying
[1:37:46.820 --> 1:37:50.260]  on the idea that the american people are not going to kick down the doors and rush into the
[1:37:50.260 --> 1:37:55.540]  legislative chambers with torches and pitchforks to deal with the matter themselves of course other
[1:37:55.540 --> 1:38:00.660]  rulers have had that same arrogance before like louis the sixteenth and charles the first
[1:38:00.660 --> 1:38:06.260]  and chow chescu and musolini so governments do make these kind of critical mistakes and i think
[1:38:06.260 --> 1:38:11.780]  this is a critical mistake for the government to go on acting as if uh... we the american people
[1:38:11.780 --> 1:38:16.260]  don't have an opinion that's worth listening to there was a rasmus and poll came out just yesterday
[1:38:16.260 --> 1:38:22.020]  where seventy one percent of americans said flat out they are angry with the federal government
[1:38:22.020 --> 1:38:27.540]  at some point if almost feels like a confrontation has become inevitable i don't like the idea i
[1:38:27.540 --> 1:38:31.380]  don't like the idea of violence i've been hoping the federal government would collapse the way the
[1:38:31.380 --> 1:38:36.340]  ussr did but it almost seems like our government is going to keep on abusing the people until
[1:38:36.340 --> 1:38:40.660]  somebody fights back maybe that's what they want because then they can bring in the armies of the
[1:38:40.660 --> 1:38:44.900]  united nations and conquer the reconquer the american continent for the new world order
[1:38:44.900 --> 1:38:51.540]  and by the way people ten twelve thirteen fourteen years ago when we would read u n documents west
[1:38:51.540 --> 1:38:57.860]  point training manuals colonel craig roberts can talk about his nephew being trained uh...
[1:38:57.860 --> 1:39:02.900]  they had wesley clark there and he said you will serve the u n we may use u n troops in america
[1:39:02.900 --> 1:39:08.500]  to quell the american people now that's in the north com documents they had n l e o nine with
[1:39:08.500 --> 1:39:14.100]  fema a few months ago fema dot gov saying troops from fourteen foreign nations are training
[1:39:14.100 --> 1:39:18.980]  to take on the american people and people and folks couldn't believe that just like they couldn't
[1:39:18.980 --> 1:39:23.540]  believe the copenhagen treaty was world government now the u n says it's world government i mean
[1:39:24.660 --> 1:39:29.780]  people have got to face the facts we are being conquered right now by a group of illegitimate
[1:39:29.780 --> 1:39:34.660]  crooks it's absolutely right and you need to understand something about the global government
[1:39:34.660 --> 1:39:39.060]  i mean i'm opposed to the concept completely for reasons already gone into but if you have a
[1:39:39.060 --> 1:39:44.820]  government that is coming into being by way of deception and lie and fraud then this will be
[1:39:44.820 --> 1:39:49.780]  a government that can never be honest with its population can never allow dissent can never
[1:39:49.780 --> 1:39:54.900]  allow examination they're already talking about making climate denial on a crime on the par with
[1:39:54.900 --> 1:40:00.660]  holocaust denial uh... it is going to be a an absolute tyranny because they will not be able
[1:40:00.660 --> 1:40:05.140]  to allow any freedom whatsoever or the first thing that's gonna happen is the people gonna say wait
[1:40:05.140 --> 1:40:12.980]  a minute why are we listening to you if it's all a lie so again how does this come to a head how
[1:40:12.980 --> 1:40:19.460]  how do you see this ending i i see it ending with enough people getting angry around the world
[1:40:19.460 --> 1:40:24.020]  to to start kicking on the doors of the legislature and and the and the ruling palace and say look
[1:40:24.020 --> 1:40:28.740]  we're not going to go for this anymore you can sign all the copenhagen treaties you want
[1:40:28.740 --> 1:40:34.420]  we're not going to go along with it it's like gandhi did in india non-cooperation you can pass
[1:40:34.420 --> 1:40:38.340]  all the laws you want you can print up all the little fancy pieces of paper that say you have a
[1:40:38.340 --> 1:40:44.580]  right to my money in my property but if i don't go along with it if i refuse to believe it if i
[1:40:44.580 --> 1:40:50.820]  no longer and enslaved by these beliefs that you are trying to put in me then it's not going to work
[1:40:50.820 --> 1:40:55.540]  you can run around with your fancy papers and stuff there are you know three hundred million
[1:40:55.540 --> 1:41:00.580]  americans out here they're buying up guns and ammo and if it comes down to a question of absolute
[1:41:00.580 --> 1:41:05.060]  force the federal government is going to lose and i know they've got the portable torture machines
[1:41:05.060 --> 1:41:09.780]  those pain ray guns and tasers and all this other stuff they're buying with our money i might add
[1:41:09.780 --> 1:41:14.980]  but the bottom line is they can target a few small dissenters and put them through a great
[1:41:14.980 --> 1:41:20.340]  deal of grief but if the american people all 300 million got angry at the same time this federal
[1:41:20.340 --> 1:41:26.500]  government would be gone 24 hours later and they know that it and it took five percent
[1:41:26.500 --> 1:41:32.100]  three to five depending on which historic numbers you look at to defeat the british we have way more
[1:41:32.100 --> 1:41:37.140]  than five percent i mean as you said over 50 percent are ready for revolution the left right
[1:41:37.140 --> 1:41:41.060]  paradigm where they play the left and right off against each other so the people never actually
[1:41:41.060 --> 1:41:46.980]  deal with the actual power structure that's wearing thin so they're coming off the rails
[1:41:46.980 --> 1:41:52.820]  they're stuck in the mud their whole juggernaut is grinding to a halt right now and i just hope
[1:41:52.820 --> 1:42:00.500]  listeners realize we are in one of the greatest times that we've ever seen we are going into a time
[1:42:00.500 --> 1:42:07.620]  when the future of humanity is going to be uh basically charted and every email every phone
[1:42:07.620 --> 1:42:13.700]  call every letter written to the editor every uh speech you give at church every every video you
[1:42:13.700 --> 1:42:18.980]  give your co-workers every person you send to prisonplanet.com or info wars.com or what really
[1:42:18.980 --> 1:42:25.940]  happened.com news article two is one more person we begin to wake up because people are now ready
[1:42:25.940 --> 1:42:30.660]  to hear the truth when they weren't ready to hear it in the past we've been proven right about
[1:42:30.660 --> 1:42:36.260]  everything we talked about we're only going off the global of stone playbook their own reports
[1:42:36.260 --> 1:42:40.900]  their own white papers something this big can't be hidden people say well that this was happening
[1:42:40.900 --> 1:42:46.500]  there'd be leaks we'd have whistleblowers we'd have documents we do you know that's the whole point
[1:42:46.500 --> 1:42:55.700]  here and uh i mean i can rant and rave about this all day it's just so mind-blowing to to now be
[1:42:55.700 --> 1:43:03.620]  alive in this time let's go to callers on climate gait carry in kansas you're on the air hey guys as
[1:43:03.620 --> 1:43:11.060]  you who know this is uh not only a horrible front against poverty this is a money-making scheme for
[1:43:11.060 --> 1:43:17.540]  the united nations as part of the clean development mechanism it's in the key otoprotocol there's
[1:43:17.540 --> 1:43:23.700]  what's called the share of proceeds united nations is literally collecting money off of all of these
[1:43:23.700 --> 1:43:28.580]  emissions credits that they're creating through the clean development mechanism and they suspect
[1:43:28.580 --> 1:43:36.020]  that they're going to have almost three billion emissions credits created by 2012 right now those
[1:43:36.020 --> 1:43:42.900]  credits the cer's a certified emission reductions credits are going on sand or is uh european
[1:43:43.780 --> 1:43:49.460]  climate exchange which is the european copy of the chicago climate exchange that you were discussing
[1:43:49.460 --> 1:43:55.300]  earlier richard sand or owns both of those companies through climate exchange plc these cer's are
[1:43:55.300 --> 1:44:00.420]  going on the european market right now for twenty one dollars it's like thirteen and a half euros
[1:44:00.420 --> 1:44:06.020]  brock obama during the uh campaign he said that he thought that a reasonable price for carbon by the
[1:44:06.020 --> 1:44:12.020]  ton was forty dollars that's twice what it's what it is in europe which is the mandatory market
[1:44:12.020 --> 1:44:17.620]  the price for these same instruments in the united states on the ccx where it's still voluntary
[1:44:17.620 --> 1:44:24.660]  right now is like seventy five cents so there's a total push by the money-making organizations on
[1:44:24.660 --> 1:44:29.460]  the planet specifically the united nations and especially the world bank all of the other banks
[1:44:29.460 --> 1:44:34.420]  that are affiliated with these gangsters and gangsters and criminals because they're making money off
[1:44:34.420 --> 1:44:40.740]  of it exactly and that's why newt gingrich is for it that's why all the big banks are for it
[1:44:40.740 --> 1:44:47.220]  that's why all the big oil companies are pushing it that's why this is all happening and a lot of
[1:44:47.220 --> 1:44:52.020]  the public really thinks the earth's dying and polar bears are drowning they believe polar bears
[1:44:52.020 --> 1:44:59.620]  can't swim just the the simplistic fraud is so over the top and the carbon taxes and carbon credits
[1:44:59.620 --> 1:45:06.980]  is only a small piece of all this they're going to tax beef and poultry and fish and television sets
[1:45:06.980 --> 1:45:13.460]  and your dog california is already doing it with the tv sets this is being announced this is literally
[1:45:13.460 --> 1:45:18.580]  thousands of taxes microvera absolutely and it's more than just the taxes we have an article at
[1:45:18.580 --> 1:45:24.260]  whatreallyhappen.com today where basically it's going down the list of the world's richest people
[1:45:24.260 --> 1:45:29.940]  and how much of their personal fortunes they've invested in these new so-called green industries
[1:45:29.940 --> 1:45:35.140]  they're all lining up to invest in these brand new companies because one of the the effects of
[1:45:35.140 --> 1:45:41.700]  this global warming hoax is to encourage people to stop buying old products that are now declared to
[1:45:41.700 --> 1:45:46.980]  be dangerous to earth and to start buying these new products well the new products are all owned
[1:45:46.980 --> 1:45:51.620]  by these very rich people who are getting on board the green revolution and it's not about
[1:45:51.620 --> 1:45:56.980]  saving the earth it is simply about stealing market share away from existing companies
[1:45:56.980 --> 1:46:02.180]  through the use of this propaganda and trick as i said there's trillions of dollars on the line here
[1:46:02.180 --> 1:46:07.140]  and this is why they're not going to walk away from this hoax without a fight well said i'll
[1:46:07.140 --> 1:46:12.100]  tell you carry you were extremely informed i wish more people knew what you knew what are you doing
[1:46:12.100 --> 1:46:17.540]  in your area to wake up folks that have no idea they're they're told hey green cars electric cars
[1:46:17.540 --> 1:46:23.060]  windmills sounds great but that's the the the sugar coating of this global government the
[1:46:23.060 --> 1:46:28.340]  globalists have nothing to do with that they could care less about all that that's just a facade they
[1:46:28.340 --> 1:46:33.780]  put up so when people hear oh the u n wants me to have an electric car isn't that good it has
[1:46:33.780 --> 1:46:38.740]  nothing to do with this yeah we know that for a fact i posted up an article on the prison
[1:46:38.740 --> 1:46:45.140]  plan of form called the Kyoto protocol oppressing people enriching banks what you're talking about
[1:46:45.140 --> 1:46:50.900]  what these electric cars what the united nations is doing right now in third world countries are in
[1:46:50.900 --> 1:46:56.340]  the name of quote unquote saving the environment is funding these clean development mechanisms
[1:46:56.340 --> 1:47:02.100]  so instead of instead of uh from from our perspective we say oh well coal is dirty and
[1:47:02.100 --> 1:47:06.500]  we need to save the environment we need to put windmills up well that's fine but when you live
[1:47:06.500 --> 1:47:11.060]  in china and the u n comes in with funding from the world bank and says we're going to build a
[1:47:11.060 --> 1:47:16.260]  hydroelectric dam here because it's clean and by the way all you 1 million people who live here
[1:47:16.260 --> 1:47:21.540]  yeah just leave the clean development it's worse than that it's worse than that it allows the u n
[1:47:22.500 --> 1:47:29.140]  to selectively give the contracts and the money to select corporations that fund the
[1:47:29.140 --> 1:47:33.780]  united nations so it's a takeover of the global economy by a select group of corporations thank
[1:47:33.780 --> 1:47:41.060]  you carry great points rusty in texas rusty you're on the air i alex uh last night i received a a
[1:47:41.620 --> 1:47:47.140]  recorded message from randy nagabowler our congressman here uh in west texas
[1:47:48.020 --> 1:47:53.060]  and he was talking about the carbon tax uh the carbon credits and everything
[1:47:53.060 --> 1:47:57.940]  and he said in that in the recorded message that it would raise everybody's energy bills
[1:47:57.940 --> 1:48:05.380]  per family thirty four hundred dollars a year yeah no the united nations and the democrats
[1:48:05.380 --> 1:48:12.740]  admit that that is a very low estimate uh the the plan will double the price of coal powered
[1:48:12.740 --> 1:48:18.660]  electricity so 51 percent of our electricity comes from that and and and even if you're
[1:48:18.660 --> 1:48:23.300]  you don't have a coal plant in your area the energy is all pooled and shared in most areas
[1:48:23.300 --> 1:48:30.180]  so most of the electricity we get has coal uh generated power in it and that alone
[1:48:30.900 --> 1:48:36.340]  will devastate the economy and this is just the beginning uh i mean it's like they promise the
[1:48:36.340 --> 1:48:41.940]  health care plan wouldn't have penalties around having insurance it's got five thousand dollar
[1:48:41.940 --> 1:48:48.500]  penalties uh it's got a quarter million dollar fines five years in prison it takes two point five
[1:48:48.500 --> 1:48:55.940]  to five percent out of your check uh i mean it look these big banks want profit centers and
[1:48:55.940 --> 1:49:01.460]  they use government to come in with excuses health care the environment whatever it is to loot us
[1:49:01.460 --> 1:49:06.420]  just like the banker bailout was to unfreeze mortgages the day after they passed it october
[1:49:06.420 --> 1:49:10.100]  third they said we're not going to spend it on mortgages and we're not going to tell you where
[1:49:10.100 --> 1:49:14.580]  the money's going and then it turned out it was going to george soros and al gore and others
[1:49:14.580 --> 1:49:21.940]  i mean we have total criminal swindlers stealing everything and that isn't enough for them they
[1:49:21.940 --> 1:49:28.260]  want even more micro vero that's absolutely wealth is an addiction we're dealing with people who are
[1:49:28.260 --> 1:49:34.340]  addicted to your money they can't get enough of it they get a thrill from having it to spend
[1:49:34.340 --> 1:49:40.180]  buying another yacht another another car another piece of jewelry they're addicted to money and
[1:49:40.180 --> 1:49:49.460]  it is time for an intervention or absolutely go go ahead resting uh the 35 000 troops of course you
[1:49:49.460 --> 1:49:57.300]  know i was in the gulf war and 35 000 troops after eight years is is who came up with that
[1:49:57.300 --> 1:50:02.580]  number if you're going to finish something why not send 200 000 what's the difference
[1:50:03.380 --> 1:50:08.420]  well they don't have to beat them with overwhelming force well i i i i mean i thought i might recognize
[1:50:08.420 --> 1:50:12.820]  your voice but i know i didn't know you were in the gulf war rusty but i appreciate your call
[1:50:13.380 --> 1:50:19.860]  look i there's different democrats here saying what's the point of the war this is all stupid this is
[1:50:19.860 --> 1:50:27.700]  all a failure i'm looking for the exact quote uh one democrat had democrat war tax proponent
[1:50:27.700 --> 1:50:35.860]  obey calls expect a troop surge a fools errand well no i mean if you believe the fake objectives
[1:50:35.860 --> 1:50:42.180]  were told on the news bring democrat seat afghanistan give me a break but for the real objectives
[1:50:42.180 --> 1:50:47.540]  it's a great success 500 billion a year in opium hundreds of billions in oil hundreds of billions
[1:50:47.540 --> 1:50:54.100]  in no-bid weapons contracts for all these fat cat companies not a fools errand our troops are there
[1:50:54.660 --> 1:50:59.460]  to engage in the looting they're there to hold the grounds of the banks to take over

[1:54:32.260 --> 1:54:40.900]  my revero is our guest let's go ahead and talk to craig in washington craig you're on the air
[1:54:40.900 --> 1:54:49.940]  hello yes sir oh just mentioning on this climb the gate or at least illegal activities regarding
[1:54:49.940 --> 1:54:59.300]  that washington state an employer has to pay a tax on how they're their employees get to work
[1:54:59.300 --> 1:55:05.460]  so if they drive a car they pay x amount oh yeah they're already hundreds of carbon taxes
[1:55:05.460 --> 1:55:11.060]  i'm trying to explain to people there's hundreds in place now thousands going into place
[1:55:12.580 --> 1:55:15.940]  yeah then you know people just kind of overlook it or don't pay attention but
[1:55:15.940 --> 1:55:22.500]  you know when it quietly started i mean no one like pieces of together how could this be legal
[1:55:22.500 --> 1:55:29.300]  or you know choosing making people either come to work a certain way or charge them like well
[1:55:29.300 --> 1:55:34.340]  if you carpool then you pay x amount if you look at what that does it also tracks how you travel
[1:55:34.340 --> 1:55:40.260]  travel what you're doing it gives your employer more work to do more jobs get lost because of the
[1:55:40.260 --> 1:55:47.140]  increased expenses micro vero what about the weather channel founder talking about filing suit
[1:55:47.140 --> 1:55:52.580]  i mean we have real evidence now of these big climatologists for the un trying to persecute
[1:55:52.580 --> 1:55:57.300]  other climatologists get them fired not let their stuff get published that right there's a major
[1:55:57.300 --> 1:56:03.780]  civil suit open and shut caught red-handed we have criminal charges with the british university
[1:56:03.780 --> 1:56:07.700]  the head university working with the british government to block for your request behind
[1:56:07.700 --> 1:56:13.460]  the scenes illegally we have the fraud of al gore trying to make everybody pay him a tax i mean
[1:56:13.460 --> 1:56:20.260]  isn't civil lawsuits a way to go i think it's definitely one way to go i mean frankly given
[1:56:20.260 --> 1:56:24.340]  the fact that a lot of these institutions that have been caught rigging the data are funded
[1:56:24.340 --> 1:56:29.620]  with public tax money i think a class action suits appropriate here i think we absolutely
[1:56:29.620 --> 1:56:35.540]  have a right to sue pretty much the entire institution of global warming for perpetrating
[1:56:35.540 --> 1:56:42.420]  a fraud using taxpayer funds no has been compromised nwa ai has been compromised on new zealand
[1:56:42.420 --> 1:56:48.340]  had these compromised in great britain the whole structure is a gigantic hoax i would hope there
[1:56:48.340 --> 1:56:53.300]  might be a legal remedy unfortunately you have to remember that those judges in the courts are
[1:56:53.300 --> 1:56:58.020]  basically being paid by the same government that was hiring all these scientists to rig the climate
[1:56:58.020 --> 1:57:07.700]  change data and we now have the newest internal un documents where they admit a covert operation
[1:57:07.700 --> 1:57:13.380]  to take over the university's the scientist to help them covertly set up world government
[1:57:13.380 --> 1:57:19.860]  and to brainwash children i mean this is sensational level information right now at
[1:57:19.860 --> 1:57:24.980]  prisonplanet.com it absolutely is but you need to remember one more thing and that is that the
[1:57:24.980 --> 1:57:29.620]  government has started invoking sovereign immunity for pretty much everything it does
[1:57:29.620 --> 1:57:33.300]  which is this idea that we can't sue the government no matter what it does
[1:57:33.300 --> 1:57:37.860]  now i've never seen sovereign immunity in the constitution but it has been used in a lot of
[1:57:37.860 --> 1:57:43.140]  federal cases recently involving vaccinations involving various other malfeasances by the
[1:57:43.140 --> 1:57:47.780]  government where they simply say we own the courts you can't sue us and of course on that
[1:57:47.780 --> 1:57:55.700]  path lights the road to a real revolution listen uh kreg just get involved with locals point out
[1:57:55.700 --> 1:58:01.060]  that washington state now wants along with california and texas to put a box in your car
[1:58:01.060 --> 1:58:07.620]  by law that taxes you by the mile on top of gas tax that's now been proposed by obama i'd tell
[1:58:07.620 --> 1:58:11.860]  people about that 10 years ago because the department of transportation was proposing it
[1:58:11.860 --> 1:58:18.420]  people laugh at me the time for procrastination must end now absolutely this is the final battle

[2:00:47.780 --> 2:00:56.340]  i want to play three minutes from a interview last night with larry king live that jesse
[2:00:56.340 --> 2:01:02.020]  ventura had of course you heard the former minnesota governor jesse ventura on with us
[2:01:02.020 --> 2:01:07.940]  last friday in that exclusive interview along with lord montan uh his tv show he says he's
[2:01:07.940 --> 2:01:12.740]  going to really be surprised if it ends up airing coming up tomorrow night 10 p.m eastern
[2:01:12.740 --> 2:01:22.180]  9 p.m central on true tv formerly court tv and of course i'm a big part of what five of the seven
[2:01:22.180 --> 2:01:26.900]  episodes and consulted on the whole enchilada and it looks like it's going to be leaning towards
[2:01:26.900 --> 2:01:31.700]  our side i haven't seen all the episodes i've just seen pieces of some of the episodes and in part
[2:01:31.700 --> 2:01:43.060]  i'm in but i'm going to go ahead and go out to break with this clip where he gets into 9 11 truth
[2:01:43.060 --> 2:01:49.780]  with larry king live he has a lot of courage and we salute jesse ventura who we've really
[2:01:49.780 --> 2:01:55.860]  woken up to a great extent here it is just within the last decade we we won't be covering
[2:01:55.860 --> 2:02:01.940]  john f kennedy or dr martin luther king or any of the stuff back then we kept it to the 10 year
[2:02:01.940 --> 2:02:07.700]  last decade and believe me the problem larry wasn't finding conspiracies it was choosing
[2:02:07.700 --> 2:02:16.100]  which ones we wanted to cover oh what is the 9 11 conspiracy well the 9 11 conspiracy simply that
[2:02:16.660 --> 2:02:23.220]  the government uh it hasn't been truthful with us i mean larry a couple weeks ago the the head
[2:02:23.220 --> 2:02:29.220]  of the 9 11 commission legal uh i believe his former attorney general farmer from new jersey
[2:02:29.220 --> 2:02:34.820]  came out publicly and stated unequivocally that at some point the government decided the american
[2:02:34.820 --> 2:02:41.140]  citizens would not hear the truth about 9 11 i find that very disturbing which is i don't know
[2:02:42.180 --> 2:02:47.940]  well we can't find it naturally because i don't have subpoena power we don't have the ability to
[2:02:47.940 --> 2:02:52.260]  put people under oath and threaten them with prosecution what would they be what would they
[2:02:52.260 --> 2:02:57.700]  be hiding in that building i don't know what you think in your wildest imagination what what
[2:02:57.700 --> 2:03:02.980]  what do you think well in my wildest imagination i find it very difficult that those buildings
[2:03:02.980 --> 2:03:09.140]  could fall at the at the speed of gravity without being assisted in some way and i used to do
[2:03:09.140 --> 2:03:14.740]  demolition for a living and how could those buildings fall as fast as i used to free fall
[2:03:14.740 --> 2:03:20.900]  out of an airplane i mean if you took a billiard ball and dropped at the height of the of the twin
[2:03:20.900 --> 2:03:26.900]  towers and you just merely stopped it and started it every floor in free fall it would take over a
[2:03:26.900 --> 2:03:33.540]  minute and a half to reach the ground the buildings were down in 10 seconds so you think it might have
[2:03:33.540 --> 2:03:38.740]  been something inside i think that the most definitely our government has not been honest
[2:03:38.740 --> 2:03:45.380]  with us i think and here's the big point i make on 9 11 why is it off limits to talk about it
[2:03:45.380 --> 2:03:51.300]  why is it off limits to question and ask questions you know when i went through duty seal training

[2:08:24.260 --> 2:08:30.180]  okay here is the deal i've got a bunch of other economic and war news i want to go over obama
[2:08:30.180 --> 2:08:35.060]  is set to give a speech as you know but they're set to release ahead of the speech the timetable
[2:08:35.060 --> 2:08:41.700]  for the war i know they're past timetables they will lie and say in two years they will
[2:08:41.700 --> 2:08:46.660]  look at reducing forces then in two years they will decide they need more forces
[2:08:48.100 --> 2:08:52.260]  then in two years when they say that they'll say but in two years we'll look at it again
[2:08:52.260 --> 2:08:57.700]  and then in two years they'll decide more forces unless they've already attacked a new country and
[2:08:57.700 --> 2:09:02.820]  need to take some of those forces out but the main force will never leave so you know there'll be
[2:09:02.820 --> 2:09:10.900]  400 000 troops uh in between coalition troops nato troops un troops british us which are the
[2:09:10.900 --> 2:09:18.660]  coalition the afghan troops so they've gone from 100 000 to 200 000 to 300 000 to 340 plus
[2:09:18.660 --> 2:09:23.940]  thousand right now with this latest uh 35 000 34 000 there's two different numbers we're seeing
[2:09:24.900 --> 2:09:30.740]  being sent and they'll say oh well we're going to cut back to 300 000 in a couple years isn't that
[2:09:30.740 --> 2:09:37.860]  nice of us and the wars never end we've been in afghanistan eight years in iraq we've been there
[2:09:37.860 --> 2:09:44.340]  for six and a half years never leaving in iraq they were building giant bases calling them embassies
[2:09:45.060 --> 2:09:50.900]  that would hold 3000 people per base they're never leaving and the internal pentagon documents
[2:09:50.900 --> 2:09:55.620]  that are publicly available but not put in the newspaper they're saying we're going to be there
[2:09:55.620 --> 2:10:02.580]  in 2020 our troops haven't left korea have they have the troops left germany have the troops
[2:10:02.580 --> 2:10:08.420]  left britain have the troops i mean we've got troops in 160 countries hundreds and hundreds
[2:10:08.420 --> 2:10:13.140]  and hundreds of bases these aren't our troops these are troops of the new world order empire
[2:10:14.420 --> 2:10:20.820]  and they use our bases to bring in narcotics and laundered money those are sovereign bases of the
[2:10:20.820 --> 2:10:28.580]  new world order empire to bring in assassins to bring in hit men to bring in child sex slaves
[2:10:28.580 --> 2:10:33.460]  that's come out with a u n in our own government and dinecore and haliburton chicago tribune
[2:10:34.420 --> 2:10:41.140]  that's what this is all about drug dealing kidnapping murder uh and of course 99 percent of
[2:10:41.140 --> 2:10:46.260]  the military they're cooking dinner carrying out the trash cleaning their guns you know pressing
[2:10:46.260 --> 2:10:54.180]  their uniforms marching around the square they're just doing jobs but the commanders and the cia and
[2:10:54.180 --> 2:11:00.820]  the intelligence units they are running the real criminal operation so these are globalist tentacles
[2:11:00.820 --> 2:11:05.620]  and just like the global system is taking over america and used america to take over the world
[2:11:06.820 --> 2:11:09.220]  it's the same thing happening in these third world nations
[2:11:11.940 --> 2:11:18.260]  obama wants afghan war over in three years see they told me that cnn just announced
[2:11:18.260 --> 2:11:27.620]  that in mere minutes obama will release his new timetable and i said two years no he says three
[2:11:27.620 --> 2:11:34.980]  so even longer and in three years that pushes him up into the next election and he can promise
[2:11:34.980 --> 2:11:41.460]  then to maybe bring some home and then you read oh it says they'll start drawing them down in three
[2:11:41.460 --> 2:11:48.980]  years the new troop development deployment would increase the total us commitment to over a hundred
[2:11:48.980 --> 2:11:55.060]  thousand troops bolstered by 45 000 NATO forces and of course they don't mention all the other forces
[2:11:55.060 --> 2:12:05.220]  here he's going to go to the west point military academy later today to officially announce his
[2:12:05.220 --> 2:12:11.700]  plans it will be his second escalation of us forces in the war tour in islamic country
[2:12:12.660 --> 2:12:17.780]  since he came to power in january see he's already put in an additional 40 but no one ever talked
[2:12:17.780 --> 2:12:23.540]  about that for the last 11 months it was all will he do a surge will he do a surge to politically
[2:12:23.540 --> 2:12:30.900]  distract you from what happened previously so we're going to go to uh derrick andrew ron johnny
[2:12:30.900 --> 2:12:35.620]  brandon and others and then colonel craig roberts is going to be joining us to go over a host of
[2:12:35.620 --> 2:12:43.780]  issues in the in the in the wider view on the new world order but i wanted to briefly bring
[2:12:43.780 --> 2:12:49.220]  ted anderson up as we do most days now to give us a gold report he wasn't on with us yesterday
[2:12:49.220 --> 2:12:58.020]  gold is way up again today and again joining us is ted anderson ted good to have you here with us
[2:12:58.020 --> 2:13:02.580]  yeah good to have good to be up with you uh yesterday real busy getting those uh spots
[2:13:02.580 --> 2:13:07.300]  running on rush limbaugh it'll be great to have some of those neo conservatives order your end
[2:13:07.300 --> 2:13:12.100]  game video and actually see what's going on in the real world maybe we can wake up a couple people
[2:13:12.740 --> 2:13:18.420]  man i tell you the dollar sure is crumbling today and gold just went over 1200 uh up as high as
[2:13:18.420 --> 2:13:23.700]  1200 and two today unbelievable 10 let me stop you right there because i meant to preface this with
[2:13:23.700 --> 2:13:28.420]  the scores of news articles that everyone i'm sure have seen where they're announcing gold
[2:13:28.420 --> 2:13:34.340]  mines are running out of gold worldwide they have to mine more ore to get a small amount of gold
[2:13:34.900 --> 2:13:41.300]  so the veins are running out the production price is increasing the asians are buying it up the
[2:13:41.300 --> 2:13:47.940]  chinese the indians the japanese uh institutional investors big central banks are hoarding gold
[2:13:47.940 --> 2:13:52.260]  the yuppies are starting to buy gold we've been warning people as we watch the run up
[2:13:52.260 --> 2:14:01.060]  up from 260 bucks an ounce right up to 1200 today and for people that don't understand
[2:14:01.700 --> 2:14:06.820]  when you look at the dubai default and and and that country going starting to go under
[2:14:06.820 --> 2:14:13.140]  when you look at which was supposedly the apple of everyone's eye when i get up here on the radio
[2:14:13.140 --> 2:14:18.580]  and i tell people they are out of their minds if they don't buy gold and silver from mitis resources
[2:14:18.580 --> 2:14:24.100]  that has the best prices out there that i've seen bar none it is such a no-brainer and and and so i
[2:14:24.100 --> 2:14:30.740]  want you to comment on all these different factors ted well i mean it's all that stuff is obviously
[2:14:30.740 --> 2:14:36.180]  a play in the marketplace what happened this morning while we're sleeping again the london market
[2:14:36.180 --> 2:14:41.540]  went up over 1200 an ounce on gold the dubai thing was thought it was thought that that might drive
[2:14:41.540 --> 2:14:48.340]  actual gold prices down and it hasn't at all gold has gone up over 1200 an ounce in london again
[2:14:48.340 --> 2:14:54.260]  while the united states is in bed and now that the u.s. market has opened up at 1 over 1202
[2:14:54.260 --> 2:15:00.580]  corrected back into the real high 1190 range and that's where it's sitting right now i the
[2:15:00.580 --> 2:15:06.420]  alex this is too fast i was expecting gold to be between 12 and 1300 dollars an ounce before we
[2:15:06.420 --> 2:15:12.100]  turn to january 1 i don't think you know that i think the chances are will be well over 1300
[2:15:12.100 --> 2:15:21.220]  just because it happens so soon well this is again a bad thing overall because this means
[2:15:21.220 --> 2:15:25.780]  they are planning to kill the dollar there's no longer any denial the imf the world bank the
[2:15:25.780 --> 2:15:31.540]  un our own government have said before they were debating should they kill the dollar now they're
[2:15:31.540 --> 2:15:37.620]  saying how are we going to kill it we are going to kill it and it looks like they're going to engage
[2:15:37.620 --> 2:15:43.460]  in this accelerated but still incremental but accelerating the incremental decline of the dollar
[2:15:44.020 --> 2:15:50.100]  which will then suck other currencies down and only real commodities like gold will go up but
[2:15:50.100 --> 2:15:56.900]  gold isn't just a commodity it's also seen as a portable hedge against inflation and in times of
[2:15:56.900 --> 2:16:02.900]  uncertainty gold isn't really going up the dollar is beginning to die it's long painful death in
[2:16:02.900 --> 2:16:07.380]  front of us i didn't ask you this question before i got you live today tad before you pitch people
[2:16:07.380 --> 2:16:12.340]  this great opportunity and i hope they take advantage of it just like i did when gold was 260
[2:16:12.340 --> 2:16:16.340]  270 dollars an ounce and i was pitching it to people saying it was only going to go up because
[2:16:16.340 --> 2:16:22.100]  all the economic real data showed that last week you said you were almost out of gold you bought
[2:16:22.100 --> 2:16:31.220]  at the $1,050 level now gold is at $1,200 tell us the last buys you did and what you have left
[2:16:31.220 --> 2:16:36.740]  if any at that super low price or what your new low price is now that it's gone up well averaging
[2:16:36.740 --> 2:16:42.100]  at about 1130 dollars an ounce i mean i was trying to buy into the depths i didn't get too many this
[2:16:42.100 --> 2:16:46.340]  last time around i didn't get to buy that much product but one of the things that i picked up
[2:16:46.340 --> 2:16:51.460]  a couple of million dollars worth here a few few months ago where those walking liberty halves and
[2:16:51.460 --> 2:16:57.380]  i am at the very very bottom end of what i have and that was when silver was about 16 and right
[2:16:57.380 --> 2:17:03.460]  now it'll be the very last day because anything i commit to today is going to put me upside down
[2:17:03.460 --> 2:17:09.940]  so i'm changing it at midnight and that would be the price of the walking liberty half there at 869
[2:17:09.940 --> 2:17:15.620]  right now there'll be well over $9 a piece starting tomorrow so if you want to take advantage of
[2:17:15.620 --> 2:17:21.140]  something that's on its way up there's a good buy for you so you made a mega buy of silver months
[2:17:21.140 --> 2:17:27.860]  ago silver is way above what you bought it for at that time so you're literally the i've never
[2:17:27.860 --> 2:17:33.220]  heard of a deal that good on silver but you're saying this is it this again alex i've been holding
[2:17:33.220 --> 2:17:38.580]  these prices since august so that'll give you an idea of where it's been silver at that time was
[2:17:38.580 --> 2:17:45.780]  about 16 dollars an ounce and right now silver's at 19 dollars and has been as high as 19 dollars
[2:17:45.780 --> 2:17:53.460]  and 36 explain that to me if if if if you're selling silver at eight dollars and 60 what sense
[2:17:54.500 --> 2:18:00.980]  presently right now it is the walking liberty half that eight dollars and 69 cents okay so so
[2:18:00.980 --> 2:18:07.700]  literally you're selling it for what silver cost right now which nobody can ever do because
[2:18:07.700 --> 2:18:11.860]  because there's the added price of shipping and there's the added price of you having to buy it
[2:18:11.860 --> 2:18:16.580]  and there's the added price of it being in coin form right everything carries a bit of a premium
[2:18:16.580 --> 2:18:22.580]  but this here is just like buying it at spot i mean and it really is because you the silver the
[2:18:22.580 --> 2:18:28.500]  walking liberty half is half the size of the us dollar and the us dollar silver dollars from the
[2:18:28.500 --> 2:18:34.660]  turn of the century right now are trading upwards right now they're just poking into the 26 dollar
[2:18:34.660 --> 2:18:40.100]  level of peace and so these right now are just incredibly i mean ten quickly tell folks about
[2:18:40.900 --> 2:18:45.220]  the gold you've got left well the gold that i have left the stuff that's going to be sitting at
[2:18:45.220 --> 2:18:52.340]  the lower price range is the ten dollar liberty at 865 the francs currently right now 263 the
[2:18:52.340 --> 2:18:58.340]  british sovereign at 325 those all reflect the older prices in gold so i haven't had a chance to
[2:18:58.340 --> 2:19:05.620]  increase those prices yet i won't tell my material or my uh my inventory sold but uh but i'll have to
[2:19:05.620 --> 2:19:10.340]  because now a 1200 dollar gold there's no way i can sell those at those so let's be clear you
[2:19:10.340 --> 2:19:16.900]  still have gold you bought at the 1050 level with it 150 plus dollars above that right now
[2:19:17.460 --> 2:19:22.900]  ted that is because you keep breaking every record this is your all-time best deal ever
[2:19:22.900 --> 2:19:27.700]  yeah but just a few of the items that i have left are in that particular price range most folks you
[2:19:27.700 --> 2:19:32.740]  gotta tell them alex jones sent you or you'll be paying the higher price it's still a great deal
[2:19:32.740 --> 2:19:42.340]  800 686 2237 800 686 2237 don't procrastinate don't be foolish this is a wonderful deal it's
[2:19:42.340 --> 2:19:49.380]  like getting in a time machine and going back a few months ago to buy cheaper gold 800 686 2237
[2:19:49.380 --> 2:19:56.340]  here's that number one more time 800 686 2237 tell them alex jones sent you the brokers will be
[2:19:56.340 --> 2:20:03.060]  there till midnight thank you ted anderson yeah thanks alex you have a mortgage and a load of other

[2:26:05.140 --> 2:26:10.900]  of these criminals to justice we have the smoking gun what say you to that you're absolutely correct
[2:26:10.900 --> 2:26:15.540]  mr jones and i think that you know you said it in uh the obama deception and uh endgame
[2:26:15.540 --> 2:26:19.620]  and paul republic where uh they use all these public distractions like you know your mtvs
[2:26:19.620 --> 2:26:24.020]  and all that jazz to uh distract people from you know what they really want to hear but instead
[2:26:24.020 --> 2:26:28.980]  they want to see these two folks who came in and crashed brock obama's dinner party you know
[2:26:28.980 --> 2:26:35.620]  is is that gunfire it is i'm sorry i'm at the range today no that's fine so are you a policeman
[2:26:35.620 --> 2:26:44.260]  or in the military military are the are the i love that sound sound of freedom uh the sound of gunfire
[2:26:44.260 --> 2:26:52.340]  in the morning it smells like like victory uh are the troops starting to wake up um well
[2:26:52.340 --> 2:26:57.620]  i myself personally um myself and my wife have been both impacts and outfall of republic
[2:26:57.620 --> 2:27:03.140]  throughout all of our units um i've talked to probably about 15 people who said they've
[2:27:03.140 --> 2:27:08.020]  recently just joined the oathkeepers but uh i know that uh it's it's starting to wake up because
[2:27:08.020 --> 2:27:11.940]  people are looking at all this stuff going on saying well that may not be right you know
[2:27:11.940 --> 2:27:19.860]  you know the founder go ahead i honestly believe that everyone or i would hope that most people
[2:27:19.860 --> 2:27:24.100]  who join the military joined for that oath that they took you know i was asked to protect and
[2:27:24.100 --> 2:27:28.820]  defend the constitution united states means foreign foreign and domestic you know and uh
[2:27:29.540 --> 2:27:34.980]  these uh people are starting to wake up instead the mayak and homeland security reports that we
[2:27:34.980 --> 2:27:40.740]  broke earlier this year say the domestic enemies are veterans and gun owners and libertarians did
[2:27:40.740 --> 2:27:45.860]  that wake anybody up in the military that north com and homeland security is really for the american
[2:27:45.860 --> 2:27:51.220]  people it i mean i i personally believe so a lot of people i showed father republic some of them
[2:27:51.220 --> 2:27:55.540]  they know that um a lot of them here are brainwashing they say yeah i can't wait to go back to
[2:27:55.540 --> 2:27:59.300]  arkansas and i can't wait to go back to iraq and they just they have this mentality that's just
[2:27:59.940 --> 2:28:04.260]  way off kilter and uh i i talked to a couple people about martial law and stuff and they
[2:28:04.260 --> 2:28:07.940]  said they'd have no problem with it because you know a lot of people here and this is another
[2:28:07.940 --> 2:28:12.580]  thing i thought about a lot of people here in hawaii they're far away from home so they don't
[2:28:12.580 --> 2:28:17.300]  mind imposing martial law on people that they don't know so then i said because it's just it's the
[2:28:17.300 --> 2:28:21.540]  same exact thing is when they go to iraq and afghanistan and they police that state because
[2:28:22.580 --> 2:28:25.860]  if they impose martial law here it's just people they don't know people different than what they
[2:28:25.860 --> 2:28:30.900]  are but then when i ask them the question well how about when you know joe blow just like you is
[2:28:30.900 --> 2:28:34.740]  imposing martial law and stopping your mom at a checkpoint stopping your father your wife your
[2:28:34.740 --> 2:28:40.740]  kid at a checkpoint what what then they will you know uh it's probably not so good so i think
[2:28:40.740 --> 2:28:46.260]  that yeah do they understand that criminal banks have hijacked the country and open world government
[2:28:46.260 --> 2:28:50.820]  and the end of our freedom is being announced i mean do they understand that they better
[2:28:50.820 --> 2:28:56.980]  relearn what it is to be an american really fast uh i would i would hope most of them do a lot of
[2:28:56.980 --> 2:29:02.100]  people i've shown a lot of obama deception to and follow the republic they think that uh
[2:29:02.100 --> 2:29:06.420]  you know some of them take it to heart a lot of them think oh that's just crazy conspiracy junk
[2:29:06.420 --> 2:29:12.580]  you're not one of those nine eleven truth seekers and all that jazz you know so it just it uh it
[2:29:12.580 --> 2:29:20.420]  kind of it frustrates me that's why i'm personally getting out but uh i think overall there is a
[2:29:20.420 --> 2:29:24.900]  large number of people in the military who are waking up it was a person in the military who
[2:29:24.900 --> 2:29:30.820]  showed me in game and then from there i just you know spiral down downward into the world of mr
[2:29:30.820 --> 2:29:37.860]  jones and uh i've uh slowly and but surely started opening people's eyes and this kind of stuff but
[2:29:37.860 --> 2:29:42.020]  you always have your naysayers and there's plenty of them in the middle god bless you derrick good

[2:37:33.140 --> 2:37:39.460]  to put regular trips on the streets now happening incrementally some of his family uh at west point
[2:37:39.460 --> 2:37:44.980]  getting speeches from wesley clark admitting they want to use foreign troops in america
[2:37:44.980 --> 2:37:52.500]  in leo nine four months ago fema's own website admitting troops from 14 different nations here
[2:37:52.500 --> 2:37:57.460]  quote training to take on american terrorist the mayac report the homeland security reports that
[2:37:57.460 --> 2:38:02.580]  we released that two state police officers gave us separately from california and missouri
[2:38:02.580 --> 2:38:07.220]  another one was a federal marshal that gave us the material saying that veterans gun owners
[2:38:07.220 --> 2:38:12.340]  conservatives ron paul supporters people that want to audit the fed are the main terror threat in
[2:38:12.340 --> 2:38:18.900]  america and what homeland security and north com are really set up for and kernel craig roberts
[2:38:18.900 --> 2:38:24.580]  years ago five six years ago exposed that here on air because he has so many military and police
[2:38:24.580 --> 2:38:29.700]  sources and a lot of his he's retired now a lot of his tulsa oklahoma police department buddies
[2:38:29.700 --> 2:38:33.860]  and state police buddies would laugh at him deer hunting 10 years ago about the new world order
[2:38:33.860 --> 2:38:38.020]  they're not laughing now they're calling him up wanting to understand what's happening
[2:38:38.020 --> 2:38:43.380]  so without further ado kernel craig roberts for the balance of the radio transmission
[2:38:43.380 --> 2:38:48.500]  craig it's great to have you with us all right i looks good to be back uh where to start i mean
[2:38:48.500 --> 2:38:53.300]  you know we've gone from being called kook's a conspiracy theorist because we know how to read
[2:38:53.300 --> 2:38:59.460]  club of roam un documents textbooks written by the white house science are like eco science
[2:38:59.460 --> 2:39:04.420]  because nobody would look at this stuff to now it's finally being announced i mean where do we
[2:39:04.420 --> 2:39:09.460]  start well you know it's really hard because it all depends on what's tentacle of the octopus you
[2:39:09.460 --> 2:39:14.900]  want to grab uh you know there's there's so many organizations involved that interlink on this deal
[2:39:14.900 --> 2:39:22.260]  because it's uh the globalist organization that's trying to bring in this new world order of theirs
[2:39:22.260 --> 2:39:26.580]  has been around for you know over 200 years but what they finally done if they finally created
[2:39:26.580 --> 2:39:31.300]  enough different organizations interlinked to handle their logistical and their political
[2:39:32.180 --> 2:39:36.580]  problems that they had in the past before you know he had separate nations uh you had borders
[2:39:36.580 --> 2:39:40.020]  you had everybody taking care of themselves but they've taken all that away they've gotten rid of
[2:39:40.020 --> 2:39:45.060]  the borders uh they're combining the monetary institutions uh they're doing everything they
[2:39:45.060 --> 2:39:49.700]  can to destroy the first world and take and redistribute the wealth to the third world
[2:39:49.700 --> 2:39:53.940]  so they lower us down to second world status and bring the third world up to second world status
[2:39:53.940 --> 2:39:58.420]  and then they've they've succeeded with their new world order uh the only i mean almost all the
[2:39:58.420 --> 2:40:03.460]  dominoes have fallen over on this deal uh except us and we're next and they're doing a pretty good
[2:40:03.460 --> 2:40:06.980]  job with it right now they're going a lot faster than i ever thought they would i figured it would
[2:40:06.980 --> 2:40:12.340]  be another few years before they would get as far as they did this year alone so we're seeing more
[2:40:12.340 --> 2:40:17.940]  things happen with this bunch of washington we've got right now that is totally uh trying to destroy
[2:40:17.940 --> 2:40:23.940]  this country with very few people uh able to to to slow them down or stop them it's just incredible
[2:40:23.940 --> 2:40:27.780]  we i mean it's almost like we just have to sit in the grandstands and watch it happen alexon
[2:40:27.780 --> 2:40:31.780]  and you know we talked about this years ago you and i did we we tried getting on the radio and
[2:40:31.780 --> 2:40:35.700]  telling people about it like you said there's people that do call in and say now this could
[2:40:35.700 --> 2:40:39.540]  ever happen here and you know i had people uh in our own special operations or special
[2:40:39.540 --> 2:40:44.900]  investigations division on the police department that were watching me uh because they're they
[2:40:44.900 --> 2:40:48.980]  said this this robert's guy he's nuts he's talking about all this weird stuff you know he's talking
[2:40:48.980 --> 2:40:53.940]  about this new world order he's talking about you know these uh you know the rob a child plan and
[2:40:53.940 --> 2:40:58.580]  and you know all the rest of it you know we gotta watch this guy he's he's he's off the range here
[2:40:58.580 --> 2:41:03.700]  and now uh but you know about uh oh i don't know six or eight months ago one of those guys came to
[2:41:03.700 --> 2:41:07.780]  me he's retired now he says you know he says they all thought you were nuts back then and now they
[2:41:07.780 --> 2:41:10.980]  think you're you know you're way ahead of your time you're an actual profit and i said all they
[2:41:10.980 --> 2:41:14.820]  had to do was do their homework all they had to do was read the material that was available
[2:41:14.820 --> 2:41:19.140]  out there and i would have given them some of it i got open my files to them but uh now they're
[2:41:19.140 --> 2:41:22.820]  they're saying okay what do we do now you know how do we deal with this uh what what do we do
[2:41:23.700 --> 2:41:27.540]  and i said well for a lot of you guys it's just a little bit too late to start worrying about how
[2:41:27.540 --> 2:41:32.820]  to deal with it uh you've got to uh start preparing what are you going to do to protect your family
[2:41:32.820 --> 2:41:36.180]  what are you going to do to protect your neighbors what are you going to do to protect your community
[2:41:36.180 --> 2:41:39.940]  because that's what's going to boil down to it's going to have to be a grassroots effort from the
[2:41:39.940 --> 2:41:46.740]  bottom up to where this entire country uh has a a culture that that comes up from the bottom up
[2:41:46.740 --> 2:41:52.340]  educates our kids educates our friends and neighbors and then is able to to stand up and resist all
[2:41:52.340 --> 2:41:57.060]  this globalist activity that's going on we're going to have to do something about securing the
[2:41:57.060 --> 2:42:01.860]  borders you're down there close to the mexican border uh you know your texas yeah i'm sitting
[2:42:01.860 --> 2:42:06.340]  here in oklahoma and we look at texas as a buffer zone right now you know we passed a law that if
[2:42:06.340 --> 2:42:12.260]  you hired an illegal immigrant you would go to jail uh and so most of the the illegals left
[2:42:12.260 --> 2:42:17.620]  oklahoma but they went to texas they went to arkansas they went to kansas um but as long as
[2:42:17.620 --> 2:42:21.540]  we've got open borders and we're not doing anything about it our own government is discouraging
[2:42:22.100 --> 2:42:27.220]  doing anything about it and actually prosecuting border agents if they do anything about it uh
[2:42:27.220 --> 2:42:31.380]  we're going to have we're going to have a problem because it's an it's an it's an illegal immigrant
[2:42:31.380 --> 2:42:36.340]  invasion it's not it's not guys coming over here to pick fruit like it was 30 years ago
[2:42:36.340 --> 2:42:40.180]  it's people coming over here with ms-13 they're coming over with drugs they're coming over with
[2:42:40.180 --> 2:42:46.180]  weapons and they're smuggling in islamic terrorist uh it's just wide open and so what what do we do
[2:42:46.180 --> 2:42:50.820]  about that i don't know we you know if we're not willing to get the military involved in
[2:42:50.820 --> 2:42:56.820]  securing our own borders then what are we doing with the military you know we've got over right now
[2:42:56.820 --> 2:43:05.540]  well we've gone active duty we've got 1,445,000 troops of all services now out of that you've
[2:43:05.540 --> 2:43:13.220]  got 1,083,000 stationed inside the united states uh what are they doing you know we we need to have
[2:43:13.220 --> 2:43:17.060]  our borders protected we're not doing it and i've had people tell me well you can't use
[2:43:17.060 --> 2:43:21.380]  the military to protect the borders i'm going where did you get that that's what that's the
[2:43:21.380 --> 2:43:25.300]  primary function of the military this country is to protect the borders of this country
[2:43:25.300 --> 2:43:30.100]  that's the primary mission defense of the nation and it starts at the border you know
[2:43:30.100 --> 2:43:35.700]  it doesn't start in afghanistan it doesn't start in south korea it starts here if we have to go
[2:43:35.700 --> 2:43:40.900]  someplace else to protect ourselves by taking out enemy elements or the ability to fight or
[2:43:40.900 --> 2:43:45.860]  create terrorism that's fine but but our main operation for the military is to protect this
[2:43:45.860 --> 2:43:50.420]  nation and we're not doing it we're not using those guys we've got governors and border states
[2:43:50.420 --> 2:43:55.220]  and well i can use the national guard to do that and they're told no you can't that's that's a us
[2:43:55.220 --> 2:43:59.380]  equipment that is not state equipment they've got and they're you're not going to use us equipment
[2:43:59.380 --> 2:44:04.260]  owned by the army or the navy or the Marines to go to the border and do this well let me stop you
[2:44:04.260 --> 2:44:08.980]  right there and go back to something you said three minutes ago you said we've got to take over
[2:44:08.980 --> 2:44:13.540]  the grassroots because they've taken over the high ground they've taken over the federal and and and
[2:44:13.540 --> 2:44:18.020]  many of the state governments but there is a revolt by the states redeclering their ninth and
[2:44:18.020 --> 2:44:25.140]  tenth amendment not for succession but to declare states rights and that's why we now have this
[2:44:25.140 --> 2:44:31.060]  internal un document not just climate gate but this new internal un document two of them
[2:44:31.620 --> 2:44:35.940]  where they admit they've taken over all the universities they admit in their own words
[2:44:35.940 --> 2:44:43.860]  it's a communist system they admit in here uh that that they've got to be deceptive uh just
[2:44:43.860 --> 2:44:48.740]  like the spp documents from two years ago said they had to do north american integration by stealth
[2:44:49.300 --> 2:44:55.380]  they say in here we've got the youth and and the un has programs that are teaching the kids to
[2:44:55.380 --> 2:45:00.980]  sing global warming songs i have mainstream links to the new york times where seventh graders come
[2:45:00.980 --> 2:45:06.660]  home and write mock tickets to their parents about taking a hot bath or shower saying it's too big a
[2:45:06.660 --> 2:45:11.940]  carbon footprint al gore is caught on video and audio teaching school kids to tell your parents
[2:45:11.940 --> 2:45:19.860]  what to do cathleen sableis has been caught doing it on on c span i mean they admit they have now
[2:45:19.860 --> 2:45:27.060]  we have a former special forces colonel assigned to black ops in austin this was in the statesman
[2:45:27.060 --> 2:45:34.180]  the paper saying oh i now run the new environmental carbon tax so we have the cities through the un
[2:45:34.180 --> 2:45:42.100]  control with the military we have north com not just not defending our borders but saying our
[2:45:42.100 --> 2:45:48.420]  real mission is dealing with libertarians and conservatives and veterans and gun owners
[2:45:48.420 --> 2:45:53.140]  because they're not going to go along with the new world order i mean so it's not just that the
[2:45:53.140 --> 2:45:58.100]  military isn't allowed to do their job you've read the articles about brigade homeland and
[2:45:58.100 --> 2:46:05.380]  tell that story about leslie clark uh or was it uh or or yeah general mccaffrey that's right
[2:46:05.940 --> 2:46:09.860]  i'd read a separate article of leslie clark saying foreign troops may be needed i mean this is
[2:46:09.860 --> 2:46:15.220]  really happening here's the point i'm making we've been right this far about what was going to happen
[2:46:15.220 --> 2:46:20.260]  get into the foreign troops get into how they're planning to lock things down stage terror attacks
[2:46:20.260 --> 2:46:24.900]  blaming on patriots i mean we know the next big attacks aren't going to be blamed on muslims
[2:46:24.900 --> 2:46:30.820]  it's going to be blamed on people like craig robertson alex jones well you know they've got
[2:46:30.820 --> 2:46:34.180]  a they've got to have some kind of a patsy they've got to have some type of a skate
[2:46:34.180 --> 2:46:38.980]  scapegoat for everything they do it's the olreich's tag fire deal it's the Oklahoma city mcvay did
[2:46:38.980 --> 2:46:44.340]  it deal it's the kind of assassination oswald did it by himself deal uh you know backed by the
[2:46:44.340 --> 2:46:48.900]  cubans so we can invade cuba i mean what they do is they set an objective and then they figure
[2:46:48.900 --> 2:46:54.260]  out how can they get the american couch potato off the couch to support us in doing this uh
[2:46:54.260 --> 2:46:58.660]  because americans are the worst ones in the world about sitting around and doing nothing until we
[2:46:58.660 --> 2:47:02.820]  get punched in the nose it took pearl harbor to get us into world war two took the lucid tanya
[2:47:02.820 --> 2:47:08.260]  to get us into world war one uh so you know how do we wake up the american people and get them on
[2:47:08.260 --> 2:47:13.140]  our side to go do whatever it is we want to do and so what they do is they come up with with some
[2:47:13.140 --> 2:47:18.740]  type of a of a uh situation a terrorist event whatever and it could be anything i mean we
[2:47:18.740 --> 2:47:23.780]  could see something in their future very you know we were being prepped right now with all of these
[2:47:23.780 --> 2:47:28.500]  different reports leaking out of islamic terrorist types coming across the border and i've been in
[2:47:28.500 --> 2:47:34.260]  contact with one of the border sheriffs down there uh by the way who they found muslim prayer rugs
[2:47:34.260 --> 2:47:39.860]  they found backpacks and they found karan's and they found um uh military patches from a commando
[2:47:39.860 --> 2:47:44.260]  unit syria inside an abandoned ranch house down there near the border where the people just gave
[2:47:44.260 --> 2:47:48.580]  up at the left and these people were coming across and staying there at night time and uh the deputies
[2:47:48.580 --> 2:47:52.100]  drove up in this house and they just ran off into the desert they didn't catch him it was at night
[2:47:52.100 --> 2:47:56.980]  and but uh he you know he put this out he put it on the internet he showed pictures of this patch
[2:47:56.980 --> 2:48:02.020]  and i had uh uh someone i know who who speaks arabic and all of that who's from that region
[2:48:02.020 --> 2:48:06.100]  identified the patch he said these are syrian commandos that are coming over here and that
[2:48:06.100 --> 2:48:11.780]  could be his bola too because they you know they work out syria and lebanon and so they're here
[2:48:11.780 --> 2:48:18.820]  okay we're being prepped mentally to expect some type of an of a jihadist attack here in this country
[2:48:18.820 --> 2:48:26.660]  and let me stop you again and then continue along that line we're now seeing singing in fox bbc saying
[2:48:26.660 --> 2:48:34.500]  the militias and and they're having imams that we know our cia front say we are the muslim extremists
[2:48:34.500 --> 2:48:41.140]  we're going to release 100 pounds of anthrax we work with your militias which is completely made
[2:48:41.140 --> 2:48:48.420]  up so now they're trying to nexus and tie in the fake mcvay types with the muslims yeah i mean
[2:48:48.420 --> 2:48:54.340]  they're right there you know there's how many of them out there have some dupe uh who who's working
[2:48:54.340 --> 2:49:01.780]  for uh this whatever shadow organization that's behind this whole deal that is ready to be used
[2:49:01.780 --> 2:49:10.100]  as a throwdown to place the blame on militias right wingist christians uh you know whoever
[2:49:10.100 --> 2:49:16.340]  they fear and they fear us they fear christians they fear conservatives they fear uh patriotic
[2:49:16.340 --> 2:49:21.060]  america and that's what the mayac report states i mean did you get angry when you read the homeland
[2:49:21.060 --> 2:49:27.060]  security reports saying ron paul stickers mean you're a terrorist oh yeah and nr a stickers and
[2:49:27.060 --> 2:49:31.300]  and all this other stuff you know anything on there and you know there was i talked to a guy
[2:49:31.300 --> 2:49:37.940]  and who was an um uh got stopped in new mexico and uh he got stopped simply because they had a nr a
[2:49:37.940 --> 2:49:42.420]  sticker in the back of one of his truck and they wanted to search his truck for guns and he said
[2:49:42.420 --> 2:49:47.860]  i'm a farmer yeah i've got guns because i've got coyotes you know and and he says i'm an american
[2:49:47.860 --> 2:49:52.180]  i've got the second amendment says well you've got that that that uh extremist sticker in your
[2:49:52.180 --> 2:49:58.900]  back window and he says the nr a i mean that's how far it's gone the nr a is a constitutionally
[2:49:58.900 --> 2:50:04.340]  uh chartered organization that goes back to teddy roosevelt it's a very patriotic uh gun
[2:50:04.340 --> 2:50:09.220]  over owners of america same thing they're you know that they're they're very patriotic they want to
[2:50:09.220 --> 2:50:14.180]  well and that's the issue they're declaring that real americans who are the last line
[2:50:14.180 --> 2:50:18.580]  against the new order takeover i mean the point is when we get their internal documents
[2:50:18.580 --> 2:50:23.220]  they're not talking about muslims they're talking about us yeah because we stand in the way of what
[2:50:23.220 --> 2:50:29.780]  they want to do because we are the last domino look europe's gone uh the u k is gone australia

[2:54:34.820 --> 2:54:41.940]  colonel in intelligence i want to take calls quite a bit next hour and get into a host of other
[2:54:41.940 --> 2:54:47.700]  issues and get your take on climate gate but but but first i mean from the perspective of this
[2:54:47.700 --> 2:54:52.020]  moving so fast we knew that once they got their program in place they were going to unveil it
[2:54:52.020 --> 2:54:55.540]  and launch it we've been saying that forever that when they emerge it was going to start moving
[2:54:55.540 --> 2:55:01.300]  quicker but but it it has amazed me as well that it's been so lightning speed but a lot of analysts
[2:55:01.300 --> 2:55:06.580]  believe that's being done because there is so much resistance forming there is a lot of positive
[2:55:06.580 --> 2:55:12.340]  things happening as well but with the purposeful implosion of the economy with all these attempts
[2:55:12.340 --> 2:55:17.460]  at forced flu inoculations with all the preparation for new wars and terror attacks
[2:55:18.340 --> 2:55:24.100]  what do you see in your crystal ball happening in the next 12 months well i think it'd be
[2:55:24.100 --> 2:55:30.100]  even less than that i think we're we're within uh within six months of a total financial collapse
[2:55:30.100 --> 2:55:34.980]  in this country you've got the chinese buying up all the gold they can dumping the dollar i've got
[2:55:34.980 --> 2:55:39.380]  contacts down in south america who are saying that no one wants to deal in the dollar anymore
[2:55:39.380 --> 2:55:44.020]  they want to deal in the euro and they want to deal in in the swiss frank and and that sort of thing
[2:55:44.580 --> 2:55:49.140]  uh... they'll deal in golden diamonds and uh... and you know commodities and things like that but
[2:55:49.140 --> 2:55:54.180]  they don't want the american dollar anymore uh... used to be the dollar was the the main uh currency
[2:55:54.180 --> 2:55:58.180]  the entire planet you could go anywhere and everybody wanted it now everybody's trying to
[2:55:58.180 --> 2:56:02.260]  get rid of it now when that happens when when you got somebody like obama who's a you know
[2:56:02.260 --> 2:56:09.380]  communist muslim up in uh... washington spending money as fast as it could be printed uh... just
[2:56:09.380 --> 2:56:14.420]  you know throwing it out the window with with no tracking of it i mean this you know this this last
[2:56:14.420 --> 2:56:19.540]  stimulus package uh... where they you know they put out a gazillion that dollars out there no one
[2:56:19.540 --> 2:56:24.180]  knows where it really went because it didn't trickle down they won't say where it went on record
[2:56:24.740 --> 2:56:29.780]  no and and and never got down to the people who you know it was supposed to help i mean you had
[2:56:29.780 --> 2:56:34.020]  all these people losing their homes that wanted to refinance uh... at a different interest rate
[2:56:34.020 --> 2:56:37.780]  at lower payments and they would stay in their homes they can still do that and the mortgage
[2:56:37.780 --> 2:56:42.740]  companies wouldn't budge on it instead they they went through foreclosures uh... you know you've
[2:56:42.740 --> 2:56:47.460]  got the unions who supported this guy because the unions are pretty much controlled by you know
[2:56:47.460 --> 2:56:52.020]  communist and socialist anyway have been you know since the beginning uh... you've got them and voted
[2:56:52.020 --> 2:56:56.420]  for this guy who are now losing the members of those unions are losing their jobs right
[2:56:56.420 --> 2:57:00.340]  and left you've got chevrolet closing down plants all over the place you've got christ
[2:57:00.340 --> 2:57:03.940]  for closing down past saturday's gone away so what i'm getting from you and i want you to
[2:57:03.940 --> 2:57:08.020]  elaborate on this but i've never heard this from you i don't think it's a defeatist attitude
[2:57:08.020 --> 2:57:14.020]  but i believe you're saying we've been overrun now you're saying batten down the hatches get ready
[2:57:14.020 --> 2:57:20.980]  for basically the red terror i think i think we're at right now is is the next thing we could see
[2:57:20.980 --> 2:57:26.020]  could very easily be uh... terrorist or a series of terrorist events in this country
[2:57:26.900 --> 2:57:31.700]  that uh... there there's two possible scenarios here and you could probably even have both of
[2:57:31.700 --> 2:57:35.940]  them at the same time one is a financial collapse and the other is a terrorist event it could be a
[2:57:35.940 --> 2:57:40.820]  biological it could be a nuclear you know some backpack nukes that they've smuggled across the
[2:57:40.820 --> 2:57:46.340]  mexican border brought in through uh... you know canada or whatever if they have anything at all
[2:57:46.340 --> 2:57:50.340]  and they can play in whether they blame it on the militias you know like the militias have a whole
[2:57:50.340 --> 2:57:54.340]  lot of vikings but you never really talked like this you mean you're really seeing a convergence
[2:57:54.340 --> 2:57:58.980]  of things you think they're about to jump to an even greater acceleration well i think the next
[2:57:58.980 --> 2:58:06.260]  stage if i were if i were them planning to uh... you know completely uh... go to auto decay or another
[2:58:06.260 --> 2:58:11.140]  order out of chaos uh... and and build up you know they're uh... like a phoenix program
[2:58:11.140 --> 2:58:17.220]  i would have to start by by destroying uh... people's ability to do anything except be
[2:58:17.220 --> 2:58:22.340]  dependent on me the government and make them dependent on me they gotta depend be dependent
[2:58:22.340 --> 2:58:27.460]  on me for the financial situation their food situation their water situation their ability
[2:58:27.460 --> 2:58:31.620]  to travel and their ability to communicate uh... stay there we gotta break back in one minute so
[2:58:31.620 --> 2:58:36.900]  they're going with the linen model the mousey tongue model the pole pot model i agree their

[3:00:29.940 --> 3:00:36.020]  you know alex i brought this up uh i think it's last year sometime uh i found out about it about
[3:00:36.020 --> 3:00:41.780]  five years ago when i wrote my book kill zone about the kind of assassination i chased you know who
[3:00:41.780 --> 3:00:46.020]  would benefit who would profit who had the capability of pulling it off and then covered it up no
[3:00:46.020 --> 3:00:50.820]  matter who was in the white house for until you know 2029 because that's when they said they would
[3:00:50.820 --> 3:00:56.180]  release whatever records they had and i kept chasing you know who would benefit who you know
[3:00:56.180 --> 3:01:00.500]  it met all that criteria up above the white house was there an entity above the white house that
[3:01:00.500 --> 3:01:04.340]  could actually control the entire country no matter who was in office was there an entity that
[3:01:04.340 --> 3:01:10.900]  could control uh the monarchies of europe did that entity exist did uh you know control things
[3:01:10.900 --> 3:01:16.420]  and events in asia well yes i found that entity that entity i thought i'd found him anyway and it
[3:01:16.420 --> 3:01:20.660]  was up but you know i found about out about the council of formulations the royal society for
[3:01:20.660 --> 3:01:24.180]  international affairs the roundtable group and they were linked to the rough child money that
[3:01:24.180 --> 3:01:30.340]  went goes back to 1773 and i thought well boy there it is right there and i'd let my uh my
[3:01:30.340 --> 3:01:34.980]  my wife's cousin read the book who had over 30 years in the cia and he said you know he said you
[3:01:34.980 --> 3:01:38.100]  hit everything on this book right here's got everything in it this is this is the way that
[3:01:38.100 --> 3:01:43.780]  you left out a few things don't i said like what he says well on on the kennedy's thing uh you know
[3:01:43.780 --> 3:01:47.780]  yeah he was going to shut down the federal reserve but he was also going to do something else i said
[3:01:47.780 --> 3:01:52.420]  what's that he said he was pulling this out of out of uh southeast asia which included laos and
[3:01:52.420 --> 3:01:57.700]  cambodian the golden triangle which means that we were not going to have black funding for the cia
[3:01:57.700 --> 3:02:01.380]  that goes back all the way to os s team 101 during world war two when they seized
[3:02:01.380 --> 3:02:06.180]  indochina away from the japanese and after they kicked the french out which we helped them do
[3:02:06.180 --> 3:02:11.780]  help help help the vietnam too then uh we ended up with with a heroin trade he said
[3:02:11.780 --> 3:02:16.020]  we're talking billions of dollars of black funding that no one can account for
[3:02:16.020 --> 3:02:19.700]  he says in kennedy was going to pull us out of that so you know that alan dellis you know put
[3:02:19.700 --> 3:02:24.980]  the stop to that well anyway i thought okay fine but where are you going with this he said well he
[3:02:24.980 --> 3:02:29.220]  said you have to understand he said i've read all of this stuff that these people have written
[3:02:29.220 --> 3:02:33.780]  about the committee of 300 and all this sort of thing and he said the council of 30 or the committee
[3:02:33.780 --> 3:02:40.500]  of 33 he says but there's one at the very top that's called the council of 13 the council of 13
[3:02:40.500 --> 3:02:47.060]  controls the banks they control all all leaders of all countries they control the uh communication
[3:02:47.060 --> 3:02:55.860]  systems they control uh shipping they control uh education uh medicine uh uh uh media the whole
[3:02:55.860 --> 3:03:01.140]  bit and uh he said he said you have to understand that that's what he said the members change all
[3:03:01.140 --> 3:03:04.580]  the time he said at one time he said he was pretty sure that Henry Kissinger said on that council
[3:03:04.580 --> 3:03:10.420]  and named a few others that i didn't know but uh that's where it starts and these people have one
[3:03:10.420 --> 3:03:15.380]  goal in mind and that is a one world government a one world currency and they're in charge
[3:03:15.380 --> 3:03:21.940]  is just that simple and it doesn't have to do with money it has to do with power it has to do

[3:08:45.460 --> 3:08:52.100]  were bringing up committee of 13 and they call those steering groups you've got the bilderberg
[3:08:52.100 --> 3:08:57.220]  group 125 members you've got the trilateral commission with a couple hundred you got the cfr
[3:08:57.220 --> 3:09:02.500]  a lower level group of 4 000 but if you look at who's the head of the club of rome or the head
[3:09:02.500 --> 3:09:08.340]  of the un or the head of the european union or the head of the council on foreign relations
[3:09:08.340 --> 3:09:15.140]  it's less than 20 people it's it's less than 20 people that share all those groups and then routinely
[3:09:15.860 --> 3:09:21.140]  we will see multiple members of those groups meeting for what they call steering committees
[3:09:21.700 --> 3:09:26.500]  and every once in a while you'll even see a blurb like oh the library of congress was locked down
[3:09:26.500 --> 3:09:30.900]  for two days all the steering committee of the bilderberg group was meeting in secret so they
[3:09:30.900 --> 3:09:35.940]  just kind of throw it out there to acclimate people and we were getting into they want world
[3:09:35.940 --> 3:09:40.660]  government now kernel why do you think they've now gone from denying their building world government
[3:09:40.660 --> 3:09:47.460]  to von rumpi the head of the european union van kyman the head of the un the secretary general
[3:09:47.460 --> 3:09:52.900]  al gore hundreds of these leaders in the last six months have announced world governments here
[3:09:52.900 --> 3:09:56.900]  we're killing the dollar we're going to tax everything you do we're going to federalize
[3:09:56.900 --> 3:10:00.820]  your local neighborhood we're going to take over your farms and ranches we're going to brainwash
[3:10:00.820 --> 3:10:05.700]  your kids we're going to fund the world government with carbon taxes they are just flaunting and in
[3:10:05.700 --> 3:10:11.380]  our face well that's because they they have the power now they think they've got the power
[3:10:11.380 --> 3:10:15.540]  to where no one can stop them they think they've gone over the hump they're they've come out into
[3:10:15.540 --> 3:10:21.700]  the open from the shadows and and now what they're trying to do is rally support globally from anybody
[3:10:21.700 --> 3:10:25.780]  they can and they they you know they they sugarcoat everything and they say it's for your own good
[3:10:25.780 --> 3:10:29.140]  this is what we're trying to do we're trying to protect the ocean we're trying to protect the air
[3:10:29.140 --> 3:10:33.140]  we're trying to protect the climates are trying to protect the children we're trying to protect
[3:10:33.140 --> 3:10:36.980]  your health we're trying to make sure everybody has health insurance we got and they just go on
[3:10:36.980 --> 3:10:41.540]  and on everybody's going yeah that's a good idea i'll sit back and you can take care of me uh
[3:10:42.260 --> 3:10:48.340]  which kills absolutely destroys the original american spirit of you just give me a chance
[3:10:48.340 --> 3:10:52.980]  and i'll take care of myself and i'll take care of my family that was the pioneer spirit that
[3:10:52.980 --> 3:10:58.100]  built this nation above all the others and now that's being taken the rugs being jerked out
[3:10:58.100 --> 3:11:02.820]  for others it's being bought we're being bought and sold at the same time we're turned into chattel
[3:11:02.820 --> 3:11:09.300]  we're slaves uh you know when they started the income tax it was a step toward uh national slavery
[3:11:09.300 --> 3:11:14.660]  and when we get a global tax it'll be international slavery because if you don't pay your tax you go
[3:11:14.660 --> 3:11:18.820]  to jail if you don't pay your tax they seize your house they seize your assets your bank account and
[3:11:18.820 --> 3:11:22.660]  so on down the line so you got to pay the tax that means you've got to go to work well here's the
[3:11:22.660 --> 3:11:27.300]  job we're going to give you because this is what we say you can do and here's how much we're going
[3:11:27.300 --> 3:11:31.380]  to pay you and we're not we're going to make sure that you spend so much time working that you don't
[3:11:31.380 --> 3:11:36.820]  have any time to plot against us organize against us or do anything to pose a threat and that's
[3:11:36.820 --> 3:11:42.900]  that's how you do that you keep everybody uh so busy and so brain dead with the education system
[3:11:42.900 --> 3:11:48.020]  and the idiotic media we have now that doesn't report anything uh that that you have a problem
[3:11:48.020 --> 3:11:51.940]  and you know i want to make one point i want everybody just listen to this one little thing
[3:11:51.940 --> 3:11:58.500]  right here if you noticed and a lot of you have i know i have have you noticed that when you put on
[3:11:58.500 --> 3:12:06.020]  cbs news uh in the evening and and they they have a news story and you switched to nbc there they have
[3:12:06.020 --> 3:12:11.140]  the same news story at the same time and you go to a bc they have the same news story at the same
[3:12:11.140 --> 3:12:14.980]  time they have the commercial breaks at the same time when they come back it's a different news story
[3:12:14.980 --> 3:12:22.100]  but they all do the same news story somebody orchestrates all three uh branches of the media
[3:12:22.820 --> 3:12:26.820]  as far as you know what we're allowed to see and hear what stories are stories what stories
[3:12:26.820 --> 3:12:32.180]  art stories we know we we have stuff that comes up like this these hackers that got into uh uh
[3:12:32.180 --> 3:12:36.260]  that the computer systems and found out that the global warning thing was this giant hoax
[3:12:36.260 --> 3:12:41.620]  and not one major media out there government control media reported or even breathe the
[3:12:41.620 --> 3:12:47.220]  word of it you've got people out there that have been trying to say hey just show us obama's
[3:12:47.220 --> 3:12:52.580]  birth certificate just show it to us well years ago the media would have jumped all over that
[3:12:52.580 --> 3:12:56.820]  you know like a crow on a piece of corn and now they won't they won't even touch it they won't
[3:12:56.820 --> 3:13:02.740]  even mention it in fact if you even mention it then you're a birther you're a weirdo you wear
[3:13:02.740 --> 3:13:09.540]  tinfoil hats and so what they've done is they've taken and and uh decided what you're gonna see
[3:13:09.540 --> 3:13:14.100]  and what you're gonna hear and it goes back to the original 1773 Rothschild plan that i've got a
[3:13:14.100 --> 3:13:20.100]  whole chapter on in my book hill zone that says control all outlets of public information that's
[3:13:20.100 --> 3:13:25.620]  the one of the main tenants you have to do and then you can use the media for mind control
[3:13:25.620 --> 3:13:30.740]  because you tell everybody what's good what's bad and they believe it and of course obviously
[3:13:30.740 --> 3:13:36.660]  everybody doesn't believe it but i mean the point is that uh what is the end game though we they
[3:13:36.660 --> 3:13:42.180]  openly want world government from your research what are they planning to do once they have
[3:13:42.180 --> 3:13:47.940]  the world government well once they get world government it's going to be very temporary uh
[3:13:47.940 --> 3:13:51.860]  there's no way they're going to be able to to keep it and the reason they're not going to be able to
[3:13:51.860 --> 3:13:56.500]  keep it is they but is there's they're going to be breaking too many natural laws of nature
[3:13:57.140 --> 3:14:05.460]  you know uh people the human race typically uh goes back to tribalism small communities
[3:14:05.460 --> 3:14:11.300]  small groups uh you know small countries and each one of them pretty much sticks to themselves
[3:14:11.300 --> 3:14:15.540]  don't they may trade back and forth they may invade each other once in a while but pretty much
[3:14:15.540 --> 3:14:19.780]  their home is their home the Spartans never got along with the Athenians until the the Peloponnes
[3:14:19.780 --> 3:14:25.380]  or till the uh the Persians invaded uh and that was a very small country in Greece you know uh
[3:14:25.380 --> 3:14:29.700]  they're not going to be able to blend everybody they're trying real hard but the more they do it
[3:14:29.700 --> 3:14:34.340]  it's trying to mix oil and water and it just isn't going to happen as soon as you stop stirring
[3:14:34.340 --> 3:14:38.820]  the pot the oil separates from the water it's that way with people too they're not going to be able
[3:14:38.820 --> 3:14:43.700]  to maintain it the problem is there's going to be a certain amount of time where they will try
[3:14:43.700 --> 3:14:50.180]  real hard and they can use everything at their disposal to clamp down and to tyrannically control
[3:14:50.180 --> 3:14:53.860]  the planet and they're going to do it with the environment they're going to do it with a monetary
[3:14:53.860 --> 3:14:58.660]  system they're going to do it with food the food supplies the farms the ranches you know all of
[3:14:58.660 --> 3:15:03.060]  that they're going to do it with transportation you know if they control all the ships and all the
[3:15:03.060 --> 3:15:09.620]  trucks and all the airplanes then they control who eats who who is resupplied who receives fuel
[3:15:09.620 --> 3:15:13.620]  and so on you know Saddam Hussein controlled Iraq for a long time by simply setting off the
[3:15:13.620 --> 3:15:18.260]  electricity to the village they are shutting off the water and if you don't have electricity or you
[3:15:18.260 --> 3:15:22.020]  don't have water then you got a problem without the desert so that's how you control the country
[3:15:22.020 --> 3:15:26.660]  you shut down the infrastructure by controlling the infrastructure and that's what morris strong
[3:15:26.660 --> 3:15:32.260]  publicly said at the un in 92 that's what the un documents say that's what the new internal
[3:15:32.260 --> 3:15:38.660]  un documents that just got released say they for environmental reasons want world government
[3:15:38.660 --> 3:15:44.020]  to carry out or orderly population reduction now you brought that up to meter in the break
[3:15:44.020 --> 3:15:48.340]  give us your take your research on what they're planning once they have their world government
[3:15:48.340 --> 3:15:52.900]  in place with population reduction well even before they get world government in place they're
[3:15:52.900 --> 3:15:58.020]  going to they they'll start population reduction you know you can you can uh you can look at the
[3:15:58.020 --> 3:16:02.340]  bible you can look the book of revelation the writer of the pale horses pestilence and disease
[3:16:02.340 --> 3:16:12.260]  um you know h1n1 flew uh for one thing uh it's not that big of a deal but the media is making it
[3:16:12.260 --> 3:16:16.980]  a huge deal and it's not anywhere near as bad as some of the other things we've got going on in
[3:16:16.980 --> 3:16:22.820]  the you know uh in the disease area uh but what are they doing they're using the media to scare
[3:16:22.820 --> 3:16:28.660]  everybody to go in and get vaccinated and if go back to my youth we were all forced when i was in
[3:16:28.660 --> 3:16:35.700]  the fourth grade uh to to march over to the auditorium and get the salk polio vaccine i didn't even
[3:16:35.700 --> 3:16:38.740]  know what we're going over there for the next thing i knew they were sticking me with needles
[3:16:39.380 --> 3:16:45.380]  every kid my age got the salk polio vaccine and it wasn't until later that they found out that all
[3:16:45.380 --> 3:16:52.420]  of that salk polio vaccine had been contaminated with a green monkey virus so you know uh the
[3:16:52.420 --> 3:16:56.420]  the problem with that is you can make links if you do a lot of research and talk to the right
[3:16:56.420 --> 3:17:01.060]  doctors you can make links between the salk polio vaccine that we received and the cancer
[3:17:01.060 --> 3:17:06.500]  outbreaks from age 40 on of my generation no that's confirmed in fact we have the internal
[3:17:07.060 --> 3:17:11.220]  uh food and drug administration reports where they talk about over a hundred million americans
[3:17:11.220 --> 3:17:19.220]  that was by the 70s had gotten these very rare but very deadly cancers from the sv 40 uh
[3:17:19.860 --> 3:17:25.540]  simian virus 40 which is a deadly cancer virus yeah and and i ended up with colon cancer and
[3:17:25.540 --> 3:17:31.060]  almost died from that or did die from that back in 97 uh and that's right you came back to them
[3:17:31.060 --> 3:17:37.540]  all of my friends uh have had one form of cancer another that are my age and we didn't have that
[3:17:37.540 --> 3:17:43.620]  you know in in 1880 we didn't have it in 1920 we had it after the 50s after everybody was
[3:17:43.620 --> 3:17:48.260]  vaccinated so now we're looking at the age one in one vaccinate vaccine and who's to say what's
[3:17:48.260 --> 3:17:53.140]  really in it i mean go back to the gulf war all those guys took shots for nerve gas i don't even
[3:17:53.140 --> 3:17:56.580]  know how you can come up with a shot for nerve gas the only thing you've got for nerve gas is
[3:17:56.580 --> 3:18:02.740]  an atropine ejection after you get the nerve gas um uh they took shots for you know other
[3:18:02.740 --> 3:18:06.260]  strange diseases they come home with a gulf war syndrome and everybody goes gee we don't know
[3:18:06.260 --> 3:18:10.340]  what happened well they were fine when they went over the people who live there don't have a problem
[3:18:10.340 --> 3:18:16.260]  but the only difference that happened was these guys had to take shots and they took shots uh
[3:18:16.260 --> 3:18:20.580]  it for for nerve gas or whatever it was they had i don't have any shots they had over there
[3:18:20.580 --> 3:18:25.860]  it was squailing and anthrax is what the army admits did a lot of it well it whatever it was
[3:18:26.420 --> 3:18:30.820]  the human body has a great immune system if you give it a chance but we pump ourselves
[3:18:30.820 --> 3:18:35.220]  full of so much garbage that the immune system doesn't know what to do and then when you read
[3:18:35.220 --> 3:18:40.660]  john p holdren's book eco science why how science are he says we're going to put stuff in your water
[3:18:40.660 --> 3:18:45.300]  supply and vaccines to sterilize and kill your butt that are in a hammer i mean these guys can
[3:18:45.300 --> 3:18:50.500]  write government policy books bragging what they're doing well go back to fluoride you know
[3:18:50.500 --> 3:18:55.700]  we had dbt we didn't have a problem with mosquitoes and and uh all these other critters but then we
[3:18:55.700 --> 3:18:59.540]  go to fluoride they start putting fluoride in the water it's supposed to be good for your teeth but
[3:18:59.540 --> 3:19:04.420]  look at all the stuff that fluoride does it's it's just and they still do it and then it still give
[3:19:04.420 --> 3:19:12.020]  us fluoride treatments uh it's there's so much going on that eventually reduces the population
[3:19:12.020 --> 3:19:16.900]  but the big thing is if they get into here's here's the other the point i was going to make
[3:19:16.900 --> 3:19:22.980]  is let's say this global government takes over and there is rebellions that occur
[3:19:22.980 --> 3:19:27.300]  in different countries united states has a bunch of people that stand up against them and so does
[3:19:27.300 --> 3:19:33.700]  canada and uk and germany and whatever they don't care because they don't mind killing as many of us
[3:19:33.700 --> 3:19:41.860]  if they have to because that also is population reduction and his henry kissinger state department
[3:19:41.860 --> 3:19:49.700]  random 200 states that they said we'll use famine we'll use war uh we'll use population reduction
[3:19:50.340 --> 3:19:56.500]  to to to carry this out and the public better grow up and face this calls are coming up at
[3:19:56.500 --> 3:20:00.740]  the bottom of the hour but when we come back i got some other key questions for colonel craig robertson

[3:26:12.580 --> 3:26:17.220]  testify for congress in nineteen ninety five i spent some time visiting with some of the senators
[3:26:17.220 --> 3:26:22.660]  congressman up there and i said do you ever do a litmus test on the laws you passed he said was
[3:26:22.660 --> 3:26:27.460]  you made what do you mean i said do you compare it to what the tenth amendment says is that law
[3:26:27.460 --> 3:26:34.900]  legal for you to even come up with uh... on a national level uh... it or is it in violation
[3:26:34.900 --> 3:26:40.260]  of the constitution the tenth amendment says if it if it's not covered in one of the aspects of
[3:26:40.260 --> 3:26:46.740]  the constitution that law is null and void upon inception and uh... you've got it you guys are
[3:26:46.740 --> 3:26:50.820]  up here passing stuff in violation of the constitution which makes you criminals it
[3:26:50.820 --> 3:26:55.540]  it makes you traitors you're guilty of treason you know and and they just look at you like
[3:26:55.540 --> 3:26:59.940]  well what are you talking about where the where the bosses craig i want to go back here
[3:26:59.940 --> 3:27:05.860]  tell people briefly the general bary mccaffrey story uh... at you know telling the young graduates
[3:27:06.500 --> 3:27:11.940]  in the in the military of the officers that we're gonna have to use foreign troops in america
[3:27:11.940 --> 3:27:18.100]  this was at the cascue class and uh... four eleven were kansas and my nephew a young captain just
[3:27:18.100 --> 3:27:22.740]  back from somalia was going there and it's the uh... it's a class you take before you go to command
[3:27:22.740 --> 3:27:28.900]  general staff college and uh... he was uh... when his class went through uh... the graduation
[3:27:28.900 --> 3:27:34.340]  speaker was general bary mccaffrey when it was over uh... brian called me and he said he said hey
[3:27:34.340 --> 3:27:37.540]  and he said you know i taught you i taught the boy well ever since he was an eagle scout he knew
[3:27:37.540 --> 3:27:42.580]  all about the cfr and all that sort of stuff and uh... he he said uh... they introduced
[3:27:42.580 --> 3:27:46.900]  this general bary mccaffrey as a member of the council on foreign relations so i started taking
[3:27:46.900 --> 3:27:51.460]  copious notes he says and let me tell you what he said he said that with the build down of the
[3:27:51.460 --> 3:27:55.700]  military this was during the clinton administration he says with the build down i hate that word
[3:27:55.700 --> 3:28:02.260]  of the military uh... and the shape the military is in right now if we get deployed on two or more
[3:28:02.260 --> 3:28:08.340]  fronts overseas that's the key this is nineteen ninety four ninety five right in there two or
[3:28:08.340 --> 3:28:15.460]  more fronts overseas then if they we have a declared national emergency at home we will be
[3:28:15.460 --> 3:28:21.540]  forced to rely upon foreign assets to pull up patrol our streets foreign assets that means
[3:28:21.540 --> 3:28:27.460]  u n troops and that mirrors what henry kissinger said well absolutely i mean this is the plan
[3:28:27.460 --> 3:28:32.740]  that's why the world we're still funneling all his money into the u n is that we cannot we can
[3:28:32.740 --> 3:28:39.380]  pull in people from everywhere from manchuria to to uh... russia to china to uh... montgolea who
[3:28:39.380 --> 3:28:46.500]  knows and divide the country up and give me your part you know uh... i heard earlier when the
[3:28:46.500 --> 3:28:52.580]  young man was talking about whether or not uh... american troops would fire upon uh... american
[3:28:52.580 --> 3:28:57.780]  citizens here in the home front and uh... my sources of the military at higher levels uh...
[3:28:57.780 --> 3:29:03.060]  say that there's no way that's gonna happen well the the words out that you know these people
[3:29:03.060 --> 3:29:06.900]  tipping their hat they're tipping their hand in washington right now has got the military
[3:29:06.900 --> 3:29:11.300]  pretty much jazzed up against them and they know it so what do they do they send more troops to
[3:29:11.300 --> 3:29:15.540]  get a stand to get them out of the country if they start using foreign troops it's not going
[3:29:15.540 --> 3:29:19.620]  to be a problem it's not going to be an issue they'll fire on whoever they're told to now here's
[3:29:19.620 --> 3:29:25.860]  the thing i talked to uh... several years ago i talked to uh... marina uh... porter who

[3:33:31.460 --> 3:33:35.060]  big interview i'm doing tomorrow in dallas we'll be hearing that later in the week so i'm traveling
[3:33:35.060 --> 3:33:40.420]  to dallas just for this interview uh going back to colonel craig roberts okay finishing up your
[3:33:40.420 --> 3:33:48.900]  berry mccafrey uh story go ahead well when when my uh my nephew called he said that uh that uh you
[3:33:48.900 --> 3:33:53.300]  know hey with mccafrey being a member of the council on foreign relations he knew that he would
[3:33:53.300 --> 3:33:58.100]  probably be a uh you know globalist and so he started taking his notes and he told that story
[3:33:58.100 --> 3:34:05.540]  that uh uh uh should we uh you know uh need troops on our our soil and our our guys are all
[3:34:05.540 --> 3:34:10.180]  committed overseas we would call on for ass entrance for you and troops well they wouldn't
[3:34:10.180 --> 3:34:15.140]  have a problem dealing with americans that that are armed and form of resistance and when i talked
[3:34:15.140 --> 3:34:22.260]  to marina porter uh who was originally marina oswald the army oswald's widow uh she said you
[3:34:22.260 --> 3:34:28.420]  know mr robert she said in russia she said when when the uh they had to deal with the people uh
[3:34:28.420 --> 3:34:32.260]  with the army she said they would take the troops from the north and they would send them to the
[3:34:32.260 --> 3:34:35.620]  south and they would take the troops from the south and they would send them to the north
[3:34:35.620 --> 3:34:40.260]  in other words u kranians would go north and russians would go to the ukraine or chechnya
[3:34:40.260 --> 3:34:44.500]  or something like that he says and then because of the culture difference no one was related
[3:34:44.500 --> 3:34:48.900]  to anybody they had no problems in shooting the people so that's the same mentality you
[3:34:48.900 --> 3:34:53.380]  take people from someplace else you bring them here it's going to be like sending us to the
[3:34:53.380 --> 3:34:58.980]  afghanistan or iraq or vietnam or korea or whatever we're shooting somebody else besides our own
[3:34:58.980 --> 3:35:04.740]  people well meanwhile they've got people here shooting our our family so that's the mentality
[3:35:04.740 --> 3:35:08.740]  of that type of an operation well let me expand on that though because i know you're a police
[3:35:08.740 --> 3:35:13.220]  officer and swat team guy and police helicopter pilots so you're deep into that culture and we've
[3:35:13.220 --> 3:35:18.660]  had long car rides together uh you know traveling to events where we've had discussions about this
[3:35:18.660 --> 3:35:23.060]  and the average police officer is just a good guy their families in it they get out of the
[3:35:23.060 --> 3:35:29.140]  military it's the job they take but the commanders the system i mean take our austin police chief
[3:35:29.140 --> 3:35:33.700]  he took a federal grant they passed a law at the state level they take blood without warrants now
[3:35:33.700 --> 3:35:39.620]  they just announced no more warrants i was uh at a lawyer's office signing some documents last night
[3:35:39.620 --> 3:35:45.220]  the lawyer happened to be a former travis county judge and he brought it up and said i just can't
[3:35:45.220 --> 3:35:51.700]  believe america's turned into this uh and and uh they have militarized the police they have taught
[3:35:51.700 --> 3:35:57.380]  the police taser somebody if they even argue with you for two seconds uh the police were caught in
[3:35:57.380 --> 3:36:04.340]  canada last year at the spp north american union meeting dressed up like an argus attacking other
[3:36:04.340 --> 3:36:09.380]  cops people videotaped their boots and their staged arrest the royal amount of police admitted
[3:36:09.380 --> 3:36:15.860]  they staged it uh last year at the dnc in denver i was there it was later confirmed we had our
[3:36:15.860 --> 3:36:20.340]  suspicions but couldn't confirm it but the police blew the whistle and said yeah they had other denver
[3:36:20.340 --> 3:36:25.780]  police attack other police for the news cameras and didn't even tell the police that they were
[3:36:25.780 --> 3:36:30.900]  being attacked only the commander told them stand down let them throw bottles at you that was
[3:36:30.900 --> 3:36:37.540]  declassified in seattle in 99 and i sent my camera guys rob dude no criminal record got arrested
[3:36:37.540 --> 3:36:44.420]  for filming police they said no one in the city is allowed outside day or night a million people in
[3:36:44.420 --> 3:36:48.660]  the city of pittsburgh g20 is coming to town and we videotaped the and this is coming out in the
[3:36:48.660 --> 3:36:55.780]  new film with sound cannons the police and military driving around shooting people coming out of
[3:36:55.780 --> 3:37:01.220]  stores old women with shopping bags would walk out during the day nowhere near the convention
[3:37:01.220 --> 3:37:04.740]  center cops would come up with billy clubs and say get back you're not allowed on the street
[3:37:04.740 --> 3:37:10.820]  and the old woman goes i just was shopping the police dog bites her then no one was resisting
[3:37:10.820 --> 3:37:16.260]  them that their sound cannoning and attacking nine-year-old kids in their front yards playing
[3:37:16.260 --> 3:37:20.900]  people on their front porches you know it's old it's old fashioned in pittsburgh driving by shooting
[3:37:20.900 --> 3:37:28.660]  them announcing like out of a science fiction movie uh uh that uh no right to redress no right to
[3:37:28.660 --> 3:37:34.180]  assemble under this code and we played the video here many times and they would fire it at them
[3:37:34.180 --> 3:37:39.700]  then even though it was over friday night they went to the university to the kids out at the park
[3:37:39.700 --> 3:37:45.140]  and said you're not allowed to assemble like the police didn't just want marshal law they and they
[3:37:45.140 --> 3:37:48.820]  brought them in from all over the country and the military and they and then later the g20
[3:37:48.820 --> 3:37:54.020]  meant they had private goons and police uniforms like you can pull up the video guys snatching and
[3:37:54.020 --> 3:37:59.860]  grabbing just go to youtube and type in snatching grab a secret arrest in pittsburgh and guys would
[3:37:59.860 --> 3:38:06.020]  just jump out of vehicles and grab people and drag them away setting the president and i don't
[3:38:06.020 --> 3:38:09.700]  have a hatred of police i don't want to have a fight with them i don't want to dislike their
[3:38:09.700 --> 3:38:15.460]  culture but it's wrong women would be on bicycles at the university and the police would say off
[3:38:15.460 --> 3:38:20.820]  the streets they go okay they would chase them in billy club little women like 90 pounds and
[3:38:20.820 --> 3:38:26.740]  fundamentally as a man that makes me mad cops in garth vader outfit stomping and beating women
[3:38:26.740 --> 3:38:32.260]  and then there'd be like 30 anarchists as usual paid the cops would wait while they would in front
[3:38:32.260 --> 3:38:37.700]  of the news throw rocks then the anarchists would move to the back and then the police would attack
[3:38:37.700 --> 3:38:44.020]  the peaceful people it was all rigged craig i mean so they don't even need foreign troops in many
[3:38:44.020 --> 3:38:49.940]  respects because so many police just i mean we've seen the footage probably from miami where they
[3:38:49.940 --> 3:38:53.940]  said no protest allowed they were shooting women in the face with rubber bullets and laughing about
[3:38:53.940 --> 3:39:00.580]  it later at the debriefing i mean they think of us is lower than you know shooting squirrels or
[3:39:00.580 --> 3:39:06.740]  something i mean you understand the culture and where it's gone i don't again there are a lot of
[3:39:06.740 --> 3:39:12.100]  good police in the system but what about the system itself well i you know i can't speak for what
[3:39:12.100 --> 3:39:16.020]  happens back east because that's a different breed of cat but i know around here none of that would
[3:39:16.020 --> 3:39:23.140]  happen i i have lunch with a lot of our officers all the time in this area and you know i'm retired
[3:39:23.140 --> 3:39:29.540]  i'm not an outcast yet uh and they basically say if that ever comes here uh you know we're going
[3:39:29.540 --> 3:39:33.220]  home and putting on our fatigues we're not going to be you know we're not going to be out you know
[3:39:33.220 --> 3:39:37.940]  doing uh you know all this globalist stuff like that you know we're going to the house and i you
[3:39:37.940 --> 3:39:41.940]  know because i you know i told him a story i said look what happens someday guys when you get called
[3:39:41.940 --> 3:39:47.300]  to the station everybody the dispatch comes on and tells all cars 10 19 the station and you get there
[3:39:47.300 --> 3:39:51.540]  and they take you into this assembly center and they've got all these tables lined up and they say
[3:39:51.540 --> 3:39:55.780]  we want you to turn your guns in and we want you to turn your handcuffs in we're going to replace
[3:39:55.780 --> 3:39:59.700]  them with a new style something something or other something rather than this afternoon
[3:39:59.700 --> 3:40:03.620]  meanwhile go over to the cafeteria and get something to eat so we can do the paperwork and
[3:40:03.620 --> 3:40:06.980]  you're going to draw new weapons when you come out when you come out there's no new weapons
[3:40:06.980 --> 3:40:11.300]  instead you've been disarmed and they hand you a night stick or a can of mason's they now go to
[3:40:11.300 --> 3:40:15.780]  your job with this because we don't trust you as cops anymore because you're not on our side so
[3:40:15.780 --> 3:40:19.780]  we're going to disarm you as well and of course everybody says well that's not going to happen
[3:40:19.780 --> 3:40:24.580]  here well it's happened all over the world and it can't happen any place as long as everybody
[3:40:24.580 --> 3:40:29.940]  blindly follows the idiots up there who are running the show you know our police chiefs
[3:40:29.940 --> 3:40:35.380]  around this country right now a lot of them are being indoctrinated into this globalist mentality
[3:40:35.380 --> 3:40:40.900]  into this very socialist anti-second amendment mentality we got a chief in Tulsa that came in
[3:40:41.460 --> 3:40:46.420]  and uh when he first arrived um they hired him off he was the first chief of police it's also
[3:40:46.420 --> 3:40:51.380]  common that it was ever hired outside the department he came from the east coast and uh when he came
[3:40:51.380 --> 3:40:57.780]  on board someone uh that the NRA sent him a complimentary free membership and he walked into
[3:40:57.780 --> 3:41:05.380]  internal affairs took that NRA membership and with his uh with his uh ad camp uh who another idiot
[3:41:05.380 --> 3:41:12.100]  and and they they shredded it and laughed and said i was the NRA think about this and he shredded
[3:41:12.100 --> 3:41:16.340]  it like that and everybody in internal affairs looked at him with a strange look and
[3:41:16.340 --> 3:41:21.140]  he said what's wrong and he said one of the lieutenant there uh said chief do you realize
[3:41:21.140 --> 3:41:26.180]  that 90% of the officers of the Tulsa police department are NRA members and he just kind of
[3:41:26.180 --> 3:41:30.260]  just well i didn't know that he turned out walked off but that that that shows you the mentality
[3:41:30.260 --> 3:41:34.740]  of chiefs all across the country with our hope lies in our sheriffs because our sheriffs don't
[3:41:34.740 --> 3:41:39.300]  get hired by mayors they get they get elected and if we can elect the right sheriff the sheriff is
[3:41:39.300 --> 3:41:45.140]  chief law enforcement officer of the county and the sheriff can is above the federal government
[3:41:45.140 --> 3:41:50.660]  operations the county is above the mayor is above all the chiefs of police and that's the guy you
[3:41:50.660 --> 3:41:56.580]  need to get in and support is a good patriotic american sheriff and if we can do that and keep
[3:41:56.580 --> 3:42:00.740]  that going like sheriff mack and some of the others up there sheriff craig and some of the others
[3:42:00.740 --> 3:42:06.500]  then and increase those uh those numbers that that's where we're starting to grasp well well
[3:42:06.500 --> 3:42:10.740]  i mean you brought up history and and what for those that don't know you obviously know this but
[3:42:10.740 --> 3:42:16.580]  in these control grids fascist or communist all command and control they first create special
[3:42:16.580 --> 3:42:20.980]  paramilitary units like swat teams which you've been a member of and i'm not saying there isn't
[3:42:20.980 --> 3:42:26.660]  some use for those in bigger departments the point is then they expand those units but then
[3:42:26.660 --> 3:42:34.420]  disarm the main units england and places do this and only allow the secretive pretorian
[3:42:34.420 --> 3:42:41.460]  internal police to have the high powered weapons or the lethal weapons and uh there is an agenda
[3:42:41.460 --> 3:42:46.100]  in this i've noticed when the media likes to demonize local police for things they do wrong
[3:42:46.100 --> 3:42:50.980]  but then the feds are always billed as the saviors who come in and federalize things and then make
[3:42:50.980 --> 3:42:56.340]  departments put in the chiefs they say and then bring in the hate laws and and turn the police
[3:42:56.340 --> 3:43:02.260]  into political officers that spy on everybody else and that's now the conversion we're seeing i
[3:43:02.260 --> 3:43:08.020]  mean did that upset any of your cop buddies when they found out that the my act report and homeland
[3:43:08.020 --> 3:43:12.260]  security reports i guess they'd also been seeing them said that veterans were the main threat to
[3:43:12.260 --> 3:43:17.220]  america well yeah i mean everybody went ballistic around here i mean i don't think those those morons
[3:43:17.220 --> 3:43:22.820]  that that came out with that realized uh the blowback they would get from the uh the local
[3:43:22.820 --> 3:43:27.300]  law enforcement communities across the nation especially you know in this part of the country
[3:43:27.300 --> 3:43:33.300]  the midwest and then the southwest and at some parts of northwest where where you know these guys
[3:43:33.300 --> 3:43:37.140]  are a lot of other you know there's so many veterans who are now police officers there's so
[3:43:37.140 --> 3:43:41.380]  many christians who are police officers as in our a members who are police officers there's
[3:43:41.380 --> 3:43:45.940]  you know every category they came up with they're in law enforcement and they're in the military
[3:43:46.580 --> 3:43:52.180]  and so when you start rubber stamping who the enemy of the government is and you come up with
[3:43:52.180 --> 3:43:57.140]  something without without thinking it through and then it gets released to where everybody sees it
[3:43:57.140 --> 3:44:01.380]  you got a major problem because well that's why we got it was because police and and and even
[3:44:01.380 --> 3:44:08.020]  a federal marshal were upset by it but uh what about how they're now and this was confirmed
[3:44:08.020 --> 3:44:11.940]  people didn't believe it six months ago now it's been in you know washington post everywhere else
[3:44:11.940 --> 3:44:19.540]  all the vfw's even that had 150 year old plugged cannons spiked cannons they had to register them
[3:44:19.540 --> 3:44:24.980]  all and then turn a lot of it in the government said oh you know that rifle you've got we have a
[3:44:24.980 --> 3:44:30.500]  record of that you had from world war one you can't have that hanging above your vfw now you
[3:44:30.500 --> 3:44:36.420]  got to turn it into us i mean folks this is serious well we didn't have that happen here i mean these
[3:44:36.420 --> 3:44:40.660]  guys still got the springfields and the m ones they march with with the flags and all of that and
[3:44:40.660 --> 3:44:45.460]  there's their their fully operational they haven't plugged or anything um they you know they got them
[3:44:45.460 --> 3:44:52.020]  years and years ago uh who but what we are seeing is is with the bat fe you know it gets me used to
[3:44:52.020 --> 3:44:57.460]  be the atf then it was the batf now it's the bat fe they just get more alphabet uh you know all the
[3:44:57.460 --> 3:45:04.980]  time uh there they got people there working as agents out there enforcing so-called gun control
[3:45:04.980 --> 3:45:09.540]  laws that don't know anything about firearms and they couldn't tell you an automatic weapon from
[3:45:09.540 --> 3:45:13.460]  a semi-automatic weapon well let me say this you've had run-ins with them and you've clearly
[3:45:13.460 --> 3:45:19.700]  evidence that the batf was involved in Oklahoma city at certain levels uh but and you can comment
[3:45:19.700 --> 3:45:24.420]  on that if you want to elaborate but i want to take a few final calls here but i've had a couple
[3:45:24.420 --> 3:45:31.220]  run-ins at gun shows and uh a few other times with the with the batf bat fe whatever it is today
[3:45:32.020 --> 3:45:40.580]  and these guys came off like real mercenary criminal types i mean i've never gotten such a
[3:45:40.580 --> 3:45:47.940]  criminal bad vibe and their mannerism they were very psychopath psychopaths are the i mean where
[3:45:47.940 --> 3:45:54.820]  do they recruit these guys well you know i don't know what i i run into and have over the years
[3:45:54.820 --> 3:45:59.460]  is they'll have agents who try to go in and enforce laws and areas where they have minimal training
[3:46:00.100 --> 3:46:07.540]  and it's it's like well in their own mind in their own attitude is gee you have too many guns or
[3:46:07.540 --> 3:46:13.460]  you have too much ammunition you almost have an arsenal you don't need all these guns well there's
[3:46:13.460 --> 3:46:19.220]  nothing anywhere that limits the amount of guns or ammunition you can own exactly every month i see
[3:46:19.220 --> 3:46:25.300]  an article about some old vets cleaning his gun in his garage the neighbor sees it the batf comes
[3:46:25.300 --> 3:46:30.740]  and then they arrest him and say he had 45 guns it was an arsenal well what it's not illegal no it's
[3:46:30.740 --> 3:46:37.300]  not illegal where's a guy in california who's a member of the 50 caliber association who was arrested
[3:46:37.300 --> 3:46:44.660]  in the state of california because he had links left over from some 50 caliber ammo belts he bought
[3:46:44.660 --> 3:46:50.180]  delinked around so he could shoot him in his barracks out on the range and the the links were in a
[3:46:50.180 --> 3:46:56.740]  a bucket or a coffee can or something and they came in and arrested him because he had large capacity
[3:46:56.740 --> 3:47:03.220]  ammunition feeding device for machine gun lengths you know and you and he didn't have a machine gun
[3:47:03.220 --> 3:47:06.980]  i mean what are you going to feed with those things anyway i mean that's ridiculous it's that
[3:47:06.980 --> 3:47:13.060]  kind of mentality that pushes people over the edge and causes blowback and uh you know i mean look
[3:47:13.060 --> 3:47:20.580]  at what about people that'll have a ar-15 that's a legal ar-15 it misfires they go and tattle on
[3:47:20.580 --> 3:47:26.740]  themselves the police show up and they get charged like that veteran and go to prison oh i know i know
[3:47:26.740 --> 3:47:32.500]  this is a total lack of common sense and flexibility and street officers and federal agents that we
[3:47:32.500 --> 3:47:37.460]  were starting to see more and more of we did not have this 20 30 years ago we had people with common
[3:47:37.460 --> 3:47:42.660]  sense uh you know i don't know how many people that i caught you know playing around with silencers
[3:47:42.660 --> 3:47:46.980]  and stuff and they weren't really silencers they take a lot more muffler and or a pop bottle or
[3:47:46.980 --> 3:47:50.980]  something and they put it on the end of a 22 to see what it sounded like well yeah that could be a
[3:47:50.980 --> 3:47:55.460]  federal offense because once you put those two things together you have a sound suppress but
[3:47:55.460 --> 3:48:00.180]  everybody's done that at one time or another they live on the farm oh yeah everybody's done that
[3:48:00.180 --> 3:48:04.020]  and and you know what's the big deal but you can all of you could you can go out you can go out
[3:48:04.020 --> 3:48:10.740]  right now and you can buy a real sound suppressor with a threaded pistol barrel and the whole bit
[3:48:10.740 --> 3:48:15.060]  and and register for 200 bucks and have it and carry it do whatever you want to with it but you
[3:48:15.060 --> 3:48:20.660]  can't build your own it's a tax thing and that's where they get used the federal tax thing but
[3:48:20.660 --> 3:48:25.060]  you know like you say i know a guy that he called me up and he said i got a problem with miss ks i
[3:48:25.060 --> 3:48:30.260]  bought i said what's that he said i squeezed the trigger and it emptied six rounds all of a sudden
[3:48:30.260 --> 3:48:34.660]  he said sound like a machine gun and i said i i said well you better get a check well he did what
[3:48:34.660 --> 3:48:40.900]  happened was there's he left it out in the shed and it rusted some of the internal parts in the
[3:48:40.900 --> 3:48:45.140]  in the receiver in the trigger mechanism they cleaned it up it was fine but if somebody had
[3:48:45.140 --> 3:48:49.060]  heard that you know they say some deputies driving down the road heard that they would arrest him
[3:48:49.060 --> 3:48:53.620]  for having a machine gun when it's not a machine gun but it just happened to be defective the same
[3:48:53.620 --> 3:48:58.740]  type of case you're talking about also there's this magical thing about a fully auto when my
[3:48:58.740 --> 3:49:04.740]  experience is i don't want a full auto i want single shot or burst because that you you can
[3:49:04.740 --> 3:49:11.060]  more effectively put your lead where you want it well you know i'm my background you know what that
[3:49:11.060 --> 3:49:17.140]  is uh i i'm better with a bold action deer rifle you know you give me a scope and a deer rifle and
[3:49:17.140 --> 3:49:21.860]  give me a hill i'm i'm good to go uh somebody out here is going to get some kind of an automatic
[3:49:21.860 --> 3:49:25.140]  weapon the only thing they're going to find out is they're going to run out of ammunition real soon
[3:49:25.140 --> 3:49:32.580]  i mean you know what's the point uh so everybody's got their own ideas on this stuff um but you know
[3:49:32.580 --> 3:49:42.180]  the the bottom line is i never saw such a resurgence uh people buying uh weapons and ammunition as
[3:49:42.180 --> 3:49:48.260]  went up as as when obama got supposedly elected now he wasn't even in office yet but just the
[3:49:48.260 --> 3:49:55.300]  rumors of him going to office or the election results he he caused a stampede and we saw it
[3:49:55.300 --> 3:49:59.140]  you know i mean i don't i don't know where you can find 380 ammo today i mean this stuff just
[3:49:59.140 --> 3:50:04.180]  dries up but isn't that a strong message of the new world order that weren't that this country
[3:50:04.180 --> 3:50:09.060]  isn't going down without a fight yeah i think so and i think it shocked him i don't and you haven't
[3:50:09.060 --> 3:50:13.460]  seen any mention of any gun control laws even from schumer and baxter and by no they've got
[3:50:13.460 --> 3:50:16.580]  them introduced though but they won't talk about them they won't talk about it they don't want to
[3:50:16.580 --> 3:50:23.460]  say anything because they know it would cause a massive uh uh blowback now remember what happened
[3:50:23.460 --> 3:50:29.220]  during the assault weapons ban uh the democrats lost congress well now this medical uh care deal
[3:50:29.220 --> 3:50:32.740]  that they've got going through right now could cause the same thing i expected well i expect
[3:50:32.740 --> 3:50:37.300]  that these people are committing political but i don't think they're gonna let a group of patriots
[3:50:37.300 --> 3:50:41.460]  come in next year i think they're gonna stage terror attacks before then well they could very

[3:54:32.260 --> 3:54:38.180]  gate don't worry about it they've already started spinning it i look at bbc story what people in
[3:54:38.180 --> 3:54:43.300]  america and canada both have to understand is the that the crews have already taken place
[3:54:43.300 --> 3:54:50.420]  especially in america you have a republic we don't okay and if i'm not mistaken your constitution
[3:54:50.420 --> 3:54:55.620]  tells american people straight out that when tyranny comes that you have to go and change
[3:54:55.620 --> 3:55:00.500]  things now i've talked to some other people on radio stations down in the united states um i think
[3:55:00.500 --> 3:55:06.260]  craig is from oklahoma i was living to a senator from oklahoma and he said it very simply uh there's
[3:55:06.260 --> 3:55:10.740]  very few of them and a lot of us all we have to do is stand up and they're forced to stand down
[3:55:10.740 --> 3:55:16.740]  um now the coup has taken place from the top all the way down to your local uh municipal
[3:55:16.740 --> 3:55:22.980]  governments go get those first get your people get all of those local governments the other option
[3:55:22.980 --> 3:55:28.100]  is to take a half a million people or however many people you think is is necessary and i don't know
[3:55:28.100 --> 3:55:33.380]  why the american people haven't done it yet um it's all most of this stuff is just noise that's
[3:55:33.380 --> 3:55:39.300]  going on it is your duty to go back and take back your government all right let's not appreciate
[3:55:39.300 --> 3:55:44.980]  your call and this is a good final point to make here before maybe jam in one or two more and i
[3:55:44.980 --> 3:55:50.340]  apologize the callers if we tried to march on washington they would detonate truck bombs or
[3:55:50.340 --> 3:55:56.180]  something and say we did it okay that the i mean this is a very sophisticated game we're up against
[3:55:56.180 --> 3:56:00.420]  here sure the declaration of independence says we could all lock and load this government's
[3:56:00.420 --> 3:56:04.580]  criminal and start cleaning them out but then innocent people would get killed the media would
[3:56:04.580 --> 3:56:10.420]  hype that up this is a 21st century battle we have got to continue to educate people it's all
[3:56:10.420 --> 3:56:15.460]  not just a bunch of noise you're right there's been a coup we now have the secret un documents
[3:56:15.460 --> 3:56:20.660]  how they covertly took over your local towns and cities and it's un curriculum brainwashing
[3:56:20.660 --> 3:56:27.300]  your kids right now this article bombshell un documents outlaw plan out outlined plan to use
[3:56:27.300 --> 3:56:33.860]  climate gate crooks in run around national sovereignty i mean we have the proof but i'm
[3:56:33.860 --> 3:56:38.900]  at craig roberts final comments on what he just said well he's right you know you have to organize
[3:56:38.900 --> 3:56:43.060]  at the lowest level you have to get control but you have to educate your owners local politicians
[3:56:43.060 --> 3:56:46.660]  that they're the bosses not those guys in washington washington is the little government
[3:56:46.660 --> 3:56:52.900]  we're the big one what happened if we had a 500 000 person march on washington uh about the same
[3:56:52.900 --> 3:56:57.780]  things that the party the media wouldn't report it uh so therefore it didn't happen no i think he
[3:56:57.780 --> 3:57:02.900]  was talking about a physical takeover well yeah if you had 500 000 people with guns and leaders
[3:57:02.900 --> 3:57:07.140]  and stuff like that head for washington you find a ghost town by the time you got there
[3:57:07.140 --> 3:57:13.220]  and and all the politicians would be uh and bureaucrats would be someplace else um you know
[3:57:13.220 --> 3:57:18.100]  that it's it's you know people think about that kind of stuff but that that's just not gonna
[3:57:18.100 --> 3:57:21.460]  happen you're not you know you got a lot of people out there said well i sure like has something
[3:57:21.460 --> 3:57:25.940]  happened but we need leadership we need somebody to do it we need you know gotty gotty got it the
[3:57:25.940 --> 3:57:32.180]  problem with with that is um it just isn't going to happen the way our society's built up to the
[3:57:32.180 --> 3:57:37.540]  look the first person who really was real if it's some provocateur they let him call for it but let's
[3:57:37.540 --> 3:57:42.100]  say i mean i'm the real deal you're the real deal if we started saying let's have an armed march
[3:57:42.100 --> 3:57:46.980]  next month on washington they had to rest our butts so fast the swat teams would say we
[3:57:46.980 --> 3:57:51.060]  tried to do something and kill us deader than a hammer well i'm sure there's something in
[3:57:51.060 --> 3:57:56.420]  the patriot act or something that prohibits even talking like that you know anytime anybody
[3:57:56.420 --> 3:58:01.940]  i mean we've lost the first amendment we've lost a lot of the second amendment uh the tenth
[3:58:01.940 --> 3:58:06.740]  amendment's being ignored the fifth amendment is kind of pushed off to one side and we've got
[3:58:06.740 --> 3:58:11.860]  politicians in Washington right now who's never read the whole constitution and dc is like a
[3:58:12.660 --> 3:58:20.500]  a a a auction block the globalist or corporate that i mean we got places like shy and mountain
[3:58:20.500 --> 3:58:24.420]  and places in colorado springs that really run the country that's just a bunch of political
[3:58:24.420 --> 3:58:28.980]  horrors in washington we have to take the minds and hearts back riflewarrior.com
