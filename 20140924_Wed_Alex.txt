[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:35.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:35.040 --> 00:43.040]  well you've seen the terror alerts they put up on television from mild to imminent to
[00:43.040 --> 00:49.880]  fear monger well now they're going to have know them the National Weather Service to the
[00:49.880 --> 01:00.320]  world putting out climate alerts every time there's a tornado or a hurricane or a typhoon it's
[01:00.320 --> 01:05.880]  our fault and they'll have lots of graphics up on television telling us why it's hot in the
[01:05.880 --> 01:11.360]  summer why it's cold in the winter and how all the penguins drowned in Antarctica and now the
[01:11.360 --> 01:16.720]  polar bears died and the Arctic of course won't matter if there's five times the polar bears today
[01:16.720 --> 01:23.280]  that there were in 1955 according to the federal government and its survey and the Russian numbers
[01:23.280 --> 01:29.440]  show the same thing reality doesn't matter you know I hate to say I told you so but they
[01:29.440 --> 01:34.920]  just follow a playbook I've had to have said at least a hundred times the last couple months
[01:34.920 --> 01:42.520]  that when they finally strike supposed Isis to really cover up the fact that our government is
[01:42.520 --> 01:56.240]  running the whole show it has been for four years that they would come out and say that they had
[01:56.240 --> 02:01.280]  struck some little subgroup because there are a bunch of different jihadi groups that aren't
[02:01.280 --> 02:07.800]  under Western NATO CIA control that they would actually destroy groups that were competing
[02:07.800 --> 02:14.480]  like Coruscant that has 50 members they think and there was an imminent attack coming from them
[02:14.480 --> 02:20.800]  and I said earlier this week I said last week I said a month ago I said probably every day
[02:20.800 --> 02:28.560]  till everyone was sick of hearing it that they would not even strike real Isis because that's
[02:28.560 --> 02:33.760]  the entire real force you can't bomb the force you just armed and trained but you've got to have
[02:33.760 --> 02:39.840]  the PR excuse to start bombing outside of the Constitution and congressional authorization
[02:39.840 --> 02:45.120]  inside Syria and this is how they do it they may come out in a month and say that Assad's
[02:45.120 --> 02:55.440]  secretly with Isis or something I mean that's how stupid they think you and I are but sure enough
[02:55.440 --> 03:01.440]  I was just talking and the guys pulled up the Noah weather alerts and it says soon they're
[03:01.440 --> 03:07.360]  going to give us climate alerts so you it always starts with something legitimate sounding your
[03:07.360 --> 03:18.160]  phone turns on high water alert high water alert or wildfires in your area now it's hot weather
[03:18.160 --> 03:23.600]  because of climate change extreme weather climate change with the authority of government saying
[03:23.600 --> 03:28.800]  it's it's quote global warming climate change well there's always change now the government
[03:28.800 --> 03:35.760]  messages this is how it starts from the president about terror threats and from Noah and from the
[03:35.760 --> 03:42.080]  department of education and oh get your vaccines bs bs bing bing depending on how you have your
[03:42.080 --> 03:49.520]  phone set and now it's constant it'll be the middle of the night and my phone and it wasn't
[03:49.520 --> 03:56.960]  like this whole few months ago will turn on and start giving me alerts before it would had to be
[03:56.960 --> 04:01.760]  on to do that so I have to turn it off and put it in another room when it's raining in Austin
[04:01.760 --> 04:07.520]  or the government messages I remember they were trying this back in the 80s and I covered it in
[04:07.520 --> 04:11.760]  the 90s people didn't believe it when I was reading articles about it now it's here and
[04:11.760 --> 04:16.800]  this is all part of the internet kill switch government taking over radio tv the eas alert
[04:16.800 --> 04:22.560]  systems but what's important is they're now rolling it out which tells you we're closer

[09:32.240 --> 09:40.000]  locked and loaded it is wednesday the 24th day of september 2014 and our news director and great
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.160]  graphics designer rob do of your tv viewer uh just uh put out that little video intro promo
[09:46.160 --> 09:51.920]  that we just premiered to kick off the official transmission here today we had some guests
[09:51.920 --> 09:57.360]  lined up but i want to head and have the decks cleared because i want to cover news in depth i
[09:57.360 --> 10:03.520]  want to play big pieces of obama's un speech today and analyze it from invoking ferguson
[10:03.520 --> 10:10.400]  that america's a horrible police state uh while they push the police state uh to saying that they're
[10:10.400 --> 10:16.160]  going to save the world from isis and corazon uh and they're going to save the world with global
[10:16.160 --> 10:21.840]  carbon taxes and taking over your cell phones and the internet with all sorts of climate change
[10:21.840 --> 10:28.000]  fear mongering alerts see i told you the amber alerts start with kidnapped kids and
[10:28.800 --> 10:35.760]  flash floods and wildfires sounds reasonable but the plan since 1997 when i learned about it
[10:35.760 --> 10:40.240]  from the texas association of broadcasters where i was talking to one of their high-level people
[10:40.240 --> 10:45.200]  he put me in touch with some engineers and then they gave me the restricted documents that i made
[10:45.200 --> 10:51.840]  a film about police state 2000 where they were already getting them ready then saying government's
[10:51.840 --> 10:59.040]  going to take over hours of programming a day we're going to jack into radio and tv we're going
[10:59.040 --> 11:04.400]  to jack into the internet and there's going to be smartphones in the future that little little
[11:04.400 --> 11:12.240]  handheld computers and we are going to force our programming over it for the public service no more
[11:12.240 --> 11:18.080]  will you play public service announcements that'll still happen but it won't just be that we will
[11:18.080 --> 11:26.000]  take over when we want now people watched police state 2000 about 20 minutes of the two hour film
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.760]  got into that they thought this is crazy even though i showed the eas machines even though i showed
[11:31.760 --> 11:41.440]  the secret documents even though they actually at the time fired figured out who one of the
[11:41.440 --> 11:51.120]  engineers was and fired him over it i've never told the story and he blew his head off that's
[11:51.120 --> 12:02.240]  how screwed up this country is this guy managed 10 stations in town blew his head off so that's
[12:02.240 --> 12:06.640]  what people have gone through just so we can tell you what's coming before it happens so don't let
[12:06.640 --> 12:11.920]  this be pearls before swine here ladies and gentlemen they don't want you knowing this intel
[12:11.920 --> 12:24.000]  before it's rolled out okay and now they've announced no has come out the national oceanic
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.440]  atmospheric administration i guess what it stands for and is saying in a press release we're going
[12:29.440 --> 12:37.520]  to be giving you climate change global warming scare tactic written by al gore alerts they already
[12:37.520 --> 12:44.000]  have little kids in the u.s and australia you can pull this up counting their carbon calories and
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.040]  deciding when to die and if they don't decide to commit suicide i'm not made this a bc news you can
[12:49.040 --> 12:56.560]  pull it up then little animals die and blood squirts out of baby pigs and chickens your new
[12:56.560 --> 13:03.680]  listener i'm not joking you can't make this up you can't make up two plus two equals five
[13:06.560 --> 13:12.560]  other common core stuff seven plus three equals eleven seven plus eight equals
[13:12.560 --> 13:19.680]  the wrong numbers this is about them getting away with committing crime out of the open
[13:19.680 --> 13:25.840]  to trample us underfoot and break our will and that's the admitted policy of saying i'm going to
[13:25.840 --> 13:29.520]  open the borders up without even an executive order that that would be illegal but just forget
[13:29.520 --> 13:35.600]  the executive order i'm going to execute carbon taxes and shut down half our power plants when
[13:35.600 --> 13:39.840]  congress says no and votes it down just because i feel like it i'm going to launch strikes even
[13:39.840 --> 13:52.480]  though congress says no authorized i don't need your authorization that's what this is all about
[13:52.480 --> 14:01.680]  now that's what it's all about is completely training us to accept anything and everything
[14:01.680 --> 14:05.920]  kind of like oh the nsa isn't spying on anybody without a warrant then it comes out they're spying
[14:05.920 --> 14:11.920]  on everything and then people find secret cell phone towers up everywhere stealing our data in
[14:11.920 --> 14:18.400]  live time and the fbi comes out on national television says it must be hackers and then
[14:18.400 --> 14:23.360]  of course it comes out on the associated press that they've in the washington post yesterday
[14:24.320 --> 14:29.520]  that they've ordered the police departments to lie to the public when people say what are these
[14:30.320 --> 14:39.840]  that is called an organized crime conspiracy a racketeering operation 101 a criminal state
[14:41.680 --> 14:45.040]  and i want to be clear this is the administration doing this in the power structure
[14:45.040 --> 14:53.600]  the federal marshals the fbi the secret service are all completely freaked out about this and
[14:53.600 --> 14:58.560]  they're the ones being spied on they're the ones being set up the officers at the pentagon
[14:58.560 --> 15:02.320]  get called into briefings just come out in the news and say all 10 000 of you have been found
[15:02.320 --> 15:06.480]  with child porn on your computer and they go excuse me we didn't do doesn't matter it's on
[15:06.480 --> 15:15.520]  your computer so you play ball or you're going to be indicted see all this hacking is two ways folks
[15:15.520 --> 15:21.040]  all these chips already on the computers from intel and microsoft it's come out
[15:21.040 --> 15:25.200]  that are remote controlled by design they don't even need to be plugged into the internet or
[15:25.200 --> 15:32.400]  wireless they can be controlled by the cell signals we told you that seven years ago
[15:32.400 --> 15:38.240]  though because engineers brought us the documents seven years ago it was in the news in january
[15:38.240 --> 15:44.400]  of this year that oh new intel chips can be energized from a distance under a secret nsa
[15:44.400 --> 15:51.680]  contract there it's not new we're not in kansas anymore that's what i keep trying to get through
[15:51.680 --> 16:05.040]  to people there it is secret g3 intel chip gives snoops backdoor pc access
[16:05.920 --> 16:10.720]  people want me to give the name out of the engineer you know what i think the family
[16:10.720 --> 16:16.560]  asked me not to talk about it when he blew his head off 14 years ago 15 years no it was 15 years
[16:16.560 --> 16:23.920]  ago but it's been 15 years maybe maybe i should talk about it talk about kevin who was in those
[16:23.920 --> 16:29.440]  meetings with the feds and then everybody else was just so scared and then he spoke out and then
[16:29.440 --> 16:34.240]  they fired him and then he went bankrupt a year later and he blew his head off people people
[16:34.240 --> 16:39.360]  people people basically were forced to suicide over this just basic information in america
[16:39.360 --> 16:43.920]  that you should know the preachers or government spies you should know their government program
[16:43.920 --> 16:49.520]  you should know about infregard you should know about all this you have a right this is a scientific
[16:49.520 --> 16:54.800]  takeover it's evil people say oh you have so much courage to fight it alex thank you courage
[16:55.360 --> 17:02.560]  i'd have to be the most crazy brave person on earth not to fight this that's why i don't people
[17:02.560 --> 17:07.920]  calling and complimenting me ever again what i'm doing is what you're supposed to do
[17:07.920 --> 17:13.600]  do i'll tell the story about raccoons in the garage multiple times
[17:14.880 --> 17:18.160]  usually come in your garage you forget leave it up and they're in there in the dog food
[17:18.160 --> 17:23.920]  pull home you know late at night garage doors left open walk out in the morning and there's
[17:23.920 --> 17:27.920]  a whole family of raccoons in your thing as long as you're nice to them they'll run off but if they
[17:27.920 --> 17:36.400]  feel cornered they're completely vicious it's not that they have courage it's that they are alive
[17:36.400 --> 17:42.160]  and have their basic instincts we're cornered folks i'm not looking for a fight i don't want to be in
[17:42.160 --> 17:46.400]  these criminals face i don't have a choice have you figured that out they're not going to leave
[17:46.400 --> 17:52.000]  anything standing it's a full takeover because criminals have to destroy good criminals have
[17:52.000 --> 17:57.360]  to destroy checks and balances criminals have to destroy honor and dignity and good people
[17:58.320 --> 18:02.400]  even if you don't think you're good you you are compared to these people they want a system of total
[18:02.400 --> 18:08.640]  oppression because they believe it's the only system they're safe in now they're really ignorant
[18:08.640 --> 18:13.360]  because historically tyrannies end up destroying the people that set it up every time it's the most
[18:13.360 --> 18:20.640]  unstable system but it's their instinct that's twisted it's what they do and i've only covered
[18:20.640 --> 18:27.440]  like one article so far it's it's it's the fact that you know now i'm going to get deadly extreme
[18:27.440 --> 18:32.960]  climate due to climate change and global warming from the government and then you read articles
[18:32.960 --> 18:38.160]  about google restricting conservatives on the web and saying well microsoft already banned them we
[18:38.160 --> 18:47.200]  won't stand for climate change denial and there's a total consensus no no scientist disagrees that
[18:47.200 --> 18:53.920]  man-made global warming is happening they've got international polls out the vast majority say it's
[18:53.920 --> 19:04.720]  a complete flaming fraud but they set up there on the news saying no everyone agrees not one scientist
[19:07.440 --> 19:13.920]  the funny thing is though the la times came out and said it's pure bull because now if you look at
[19:13.920 --> 19:18.960]  the different studies and numbers over 90 percent of real scientists climatologist
[19:18.960 --> 19:25.040]  planetologists you could call them astrophysicists meteorologists say it has nothing to do with
[19:25.040 --> 19:29.200]  carbon dioxide and the graphs show that when it heats carbon dioxide goes up a year later because
[19:29.200 --> 19:33.840]  there's more life there's more plants they're releasing more oxygen and carbon dioxide
[19:35.920 --> 19:44.240]  they release more carbon dioxide we release we release carbon dioxide they release oxygen
[19:44.240 --> 19:50.080]  oxygen and it's the carbon cycle it's just so ridiculous all right we're gonna come back get
[19:50.080 --> 19:55.600]  into all the news open the phones up get into obama's un address it is off the chart evil
[19:55.600 --> 20:02.880]  i'm alex jones stay with us you heard the discussions all over the radio you couldn't
[20:02.880 --> 20:09.360]  believe what you were hearing you trusted them you felt betrayed your emotions began to
[20:09.360 --> 20:16.160]  consume you outrage set in then nothing days turned weeks and months then
[20:17.680 --> 20:25.360]  but they happened they're still monitoring your every move it's coming monitor blocket pocket
[20:25.360 --> 20:32.160]  dot com or will you forget are you ready to surrender your right to buy body armor no joke
[20:32.160 --> 20:38.320]  congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor and if house bill hr 5344 becomes law you
[20:38.320 --> 20:43.120]  can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye don't put off your body
[20:43.120 --> 20:48.880]  armor purchase any longer go now to infidel body armor dot com thousands of military veterans
[20:48.880 --> 20:56.720]  trust their lives to infidel body armor you should too spelled i n f i d e l infidel body armor
[20:56.720 --> 21:03.440]  just won't quit americans prepare for financial ruin that is what one of the world's richest men
[21:03.440 --> 21:08.320]  donald trump said just a few weeks ago what are you doing to prepare the problems that caused the
[21:08.320 --> 21:13.360]  last financial crisis were never fixed in fact they're even worse now the total amount of debt
[21:13.360 --> 21:19.920]  in the us has grown by more than 57 percent since september 2008 the two big to fail banks are much

[24:15.440 --> 24:25.040]  if you study human activity human populations we know the cycles that countries people's
[24:25.040 --> 24:32.160]  civilizations go through you look at the cycle we're in every major historian every major
[24:32.160 --> 24:39.920]  analyst now concurs with what ron paul and myself and bob Chapman and gerald solente
[24:39.920 --> 24:47.040]  and john williams and mark faber and jim rogers and
[24:49.360 --> 24:54.400]  so many other people were saying 30 years ago 20 years ago 15 years ago
[24:56.240 --> 25:01.840]  it's not hard to know that if you start deficit spending and you start accelerating fiat currency
[25:01.840 --> 25:08.720]  printing that it may be 20 years it may be 50 years you will go weimar republic hyper inflation
[25:08.720 --> 25:22.160]  and the system has been doing this on purpose gearing up the police state gearing up the apparatus
[25:22.160 --> 25:29.760]  of state control gearing up a system of oppression and it'd be bad enough if they'd done this on
[25:29.760 --> 25:34.400]  purpose to consolidate control and then we're just getting ready for all the poor people they had to
[25:34.400 --> 25:40.960]  corral uh-uh they're getting ready to use the collapse to bring in total totalitarianism
[25:43.360 --> 25:45.840]  to target the intelligentsia
[25:49.440 --> 25:55.840]  because the elite want everything for themselves the life extension technologies they do not want
[25:55.840 --> 26:03.280]  to share it because they believe that if you give super augmentation we're talking having a 2000
[26:03.280 --> 26:09.520]  iq is what they believe is going to happen curse well joy all of them and they're now open about it
[26:09.520 --> 26:13.520]  they weren't 20 years ago when i was first warning you it was in more you know deep
[26:13.520 --> 26:17.760]  DARPA documents and things that were semi-public a lot of this stuff will get released and by the
[26:17.760 --> 26:21.840]  national federation of scientists and i'd cover it on air and then it would say the federation
[26:21.840 --> 26:27.120]  of scientists has been requested by the department of defense to reclassify this when they would send
[26:27.120 --> 26:36.400]  marine corps officers to ut austin and to the sunshine project in uniform to demand documents
[26:36.400 --> 26:43.120]  back and things i mean i mean this this was in the news documents that we cover in my book that's
[26:43.120 --> 26:48.800]  now in a e-book it's i've been on a print for a long time um 9 11 the road to tyranny but but
[26:48.800 --> 26:52.240]  in there we have the shots of the documents and things where where DARPA said
[26:52.240 --> 27:01.680]  that first you'll have a phone then you'll have uh contact lenses then it'll be a chip
[27:02.240 --> 27:05.520]  and then you'll basically merge with it and then to bring total peace
[27:08.160 --> 27:13.680]  everyone will live in tanks and you'll live in virtual reality from birth to death
[27:13.680 --> 27:19.120]  and it'll be an artificial programmed reality and then we will power the computers off the human
[27:19.120 --> 27:24.480]  heat and have basically these big algae tanks and things that produce the protein for for the
[27:24.480 --> 27:30.560]  new humanoid species and you're probably saying you know i've heard of this before it's the matrix
[27:30.560 --> 27:37.440]  yeah folks the wachowski brothers are basically just made a movie about what DARPA
[27:38.480 --> 27:43.440]  believes they're going to do to humans now i don't know if that's going to happen
[27:43.440 --> 27:49.600]  but this was in government documents released by the federation of american scientists
[27:50.240 --> 27:52.240]  and the sunshine project and others
[27:56.560 --> 27:58.880]  you know what else sunshine project released that they have
[28:00.320 --> 28:07.360]  helicopter drone bases they had this in like 1996 with the knockout gas that the
[28:07.360 --> 28:11.760]  estimate will kill about 11 percent of the people the drones take off they fly over a
[28:11.760 --> 28:16.080]  couple thousand feet they spray it one whiff you're knocked out but they said it'll cost fires
[28:16.080 --> 28:22.320]  wrecks and a large portion of people will just die of course that's what was declassified and
[28:22.320 --> 28:28.080]  the marines wanted it reclassified the deeper documents are those helicopters serviced by
[28:28.720 --> 28:33.840]  robot conveyor belts just a robot loading system loads what what canisters are there
[28:34.400 --> 28:40.160]  nerve gas their helicopters placed all across the country with grids with lethal nerve gas ready
[28:40.160 --> 28:43.120]  that's who really runs our government
[28:45.440 --> 28:51.360]  and see i've got all this news here to cover and it sounds to insane but it's really happening
[28:51.920 --> 28:54.640]  i'm giving you the rest of the story what i'm really thinking about
[28:57.600 --> 29:02.720]  i mean do people really just want to go along with this elite and just think oh it's too extreme
[29:02.720 --> 29:08.320]  that'll never happen really obama care with death panels and the veterans put on secret death list
[29:08.320 --> 29:14.480]  to not give them cancer care and things and a wink wink with the yuppies and Ezekiel Emmanuel
[29:14.480 --> 29:19.360]  saying yeah go ahead don't give them treatment let them die don't give old people treatment
[29:21.680 --> 29:26.240]  they're just coming out in the open with everything they're going to continue until we
[29:26.240 --> 29:31.200]  freak out what they're trying to do is just titrate the dose that's how people that work
[29:31.200 --> 29:35.200]  with poisonous snakes they give them a dose of the poison up and up and up and up until they
[29:35.200 --> 29:40.240]  can take a full dose and not die well that can work to reverse where they give us tyranny by
[29:40.240 --> 29:45.600]  increment until we just end up accepting everything like a frog in the pot that's what's happening
[29:45.600 --> 29:51.360]  we're going to come back and get into the news stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run

[33:55.600 --> 34:04.240]  on corruption i'm your host alex jones akel taylan one of our great writers who was living in
[34:04.240 --> 34:09.280]  seattle last year he's now moved here to work with us received directly from someone inside
[34:09.280 --> 34:18.320]  government the documents on a secret network of cell towers that were had video audio uh
[34:18.320 --> 34:23.760]  a private internet network for the police paid for by homeland security that doubled as a cell
[34:23.760 --> 34:31.680]  phone array to steal everybody's data and we reported last year that the that that homeland
[34:31.680 --> 34:36.480]  security and the fbi were ordering people not to talk about it well well how do they order people
[34:36.480 --> 34:41.040]  not to talk about something that's criminal and the city council and the state admitted it was
[34:41.040 --> 34:45.200]  illegal and then claimed they turned it off so we'll go over some of those articles i want to
[34:45.200 --> 34:50.880]  spend a few minutes with mckayl because here's our article from last month august 27th remember
[34:50.880 --> 34:56.480]  this is from the washington post yesterday fbi ordered police department to conceal stingray
[34:56.480 --> 35:03.680]  use police tell city council device user detect ied's well if it's for ied's no it's to grab
[35:03.680 --> 35:09.920]  everybody's data so mckayl i mean you wrote the articles and we don't care about quote us getting
[35:09.920 --> 35:15.280]  the credit but they're supposed to do that and that's what the you know just like we said millions
[35:15.280 --> 35:19.360]  could die from Ebola because virologists were saying in a month ago now it's in the news this week
[35:19.360 --> 35:23.760]  in the new york times just like three weeks before it was in the new york times we went down with
[35:23.760 --> 35:29.600]  video cameras showed the emergency manager uh in a major city down in texas uh border with
[35:29.600 --> 35:36.080]  mexico mcowan showed the buses with the illegals them being given the vouchers and it took three
[35:36.080 --> 35:41.280]  weeks to get mainstream news to admit it the government premeditatedly is bringing them in
[35:41.280 --> 35:48.240]  advertising to get them here we broke that and we continue to break it they don't want you to know
[35:48.240 --> 35:54.080]  and the issue here is the mainstream media knows all this stuff and their job is to lie to you
[35:54.640 --> 35:59.040]  and to keep you from knowing it and then once it finally breaks remember cbs news last week
[35:59.040 --> 36:05.120]  i made a big deal out of it was like oh this fbi agent says the towers must be hackers but the
[36:05.120 --> 36:11.120]  police aren't investigating big cell phone towers and hidden cell phone arrays and property owners
[36:11.120 --> 36:14.720]  are saying what is this and they're just like just don't worry about it we're sure it's something
[36:14.720 --> 36:21.520]  illegal but it's not us because the fbi wouldn't get data without warrants that was a quote in cbs
[36:21.520 --> 36:27.760]  on the tv piece i mean this is how dumb they think we are when the city council is on record a
[36:27.760 --> 36:33.120]  month ago in seattle saying we were told to shut up and they were on record last year in fact what
[36:33.120 --> 36:38.240]  were those headlines we'll pull some of them up uh secret mesh network secret secret spy network
[36:38.240 --> 36:44.560]  discovered in seattle info wars dot com behind it you search it it comes right up uh mckayle failan
[36:44.560 --> 36:52.960]  seattle uh there it is tech company finds mysterious fake cell towers in dc that's brand new two days
[36:52.960 --> 37:01.200]  ago oh look the tech company discovered them all i'm saying is we broke this just like we break
[37:01.200 --> 37:06.720]  almost everything else and it's so frustrating because now they're still playing dumb we don't
[37:06.720 --> 37:13.600]  know what these are oh gg you know jiminy crickets we have no i in fact mckayle i'm gonna bring you
[37:13.600 --> 37:17.760]  back in here in a minute i want you to go out and get your original articles because i want those
[37:17.760 --> 37:21.280]  and as soon as we have those i want you to come back in and talk about this all right because i want
[37:21.280 --> 37:25.440]  to show those to people 100 so there's no doubt so we'll talk to you in a few minutes as soon as
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.760]  you can get those and i want to have a permanent file on this because i want to show the city
[37:29.760 --> 37:33.680]  documents you know we have all the documents in the articles and the rest of it so as soon as we
[37:33.680 --> 37:38.240]  can do that we'll do it there it is fbi forces police departments across the u.s to keep quiet about
[37:38.240 --> 37:41.920]  cell phones spying here yeah but that's from august this year it's not enough for us to
[37:41.920 --> 37:46.880]  break it a month before i want to show people middle of last year so when when we get it we'll
[37:46.880 --> 37:54.320]  bring it up okay continuing here ladies and gentlemen we told you they were using drones
[37:54.320 --> 37:59.600]  to spy on rural farmers and ranchers it was it was in federal documents that were public
[37:59.600 --> 38:06.080]  public in prosecutions of people for for building a barn when they're in a recharge area and the
[38:06.080 --> 38:13.280]  feds say they can't that they were using unmanned aerial vehicles predator drones folks remember
[38:13.280 --> 38:20.080]  and they had ap in thousands of newspapers and and tv covered it saying alex jones is a liar

[38:25.360 --> 38:30.400]  there it is there's kurt nemo's article 2012 epa using drones to spy on cattle ranchers
[38:31.760 --> 38:38.480]  in nebraska and iowa and they came out and attacked that article that drudge carried
[38:38.480 --> 38:43.360]  and said none of it was true oh really they've now announced that yes we're watching everything you
[38:43.360 --> 38:50.800]  do with blimps with drones uh they're building drone bases in every major state uh drone delivery

[40:18.080 --> 40:26.400]  and just shoveling shoveling shoveling i told you four years ago that they would let al qaeda
[40:27.040 --> 40:36.560]  renamed all these other names chorison isis isle to confuse you because the paradigm broke last
[40:36.560 --> 40:45.120]  year the military knows the players and all the fake bin laden killings now they say the
[40:45.120 --> 40:50.960]  turk is dead another ace card in the deck of bad guys has been taken out by barack obama
[40:50.960 --> 40:58.560]  who fights muslim extremists worldwide on seven continents and two oceans and five seas as well as
[40:58.560 --> 41:04.640]  on mars the moon and pluto yes ladies and gentlemen he's the super duper president who can do anything
[41:04.640 --> 41:10.240]  he'll save the earth from climate change he'll save the earth from racism he'll save the earth
[41:10.240 --> 41:16.080]  from the pesky muslim extremists he's barack h obama he'll also save the earth from returning
[41:16.080 --> 41:25.280]  veterans the tea party and those pesky gun owners barack h obama who loves you and who
[41:25.280 --> 41:37.760]  do you love barack h obama our lord and saviour to quote jayme fox
[41:40.640 --> 41:46.480]  and as soon as we have those five articles written by mckelphalan this is kind of a pet peeve i've
[41:46.480 --> 41:54.000]  got i'm gonna find him i'm gonna find him right now look at this story mysterious virus spreading
[41:54.000 --> 42:02.800]  across us and canada and primarily affecting vaccinated children vaccines are causing an
[42:02.800 --> 42:09.680]  unprecedented number of mutations oh and and now they're not the old-fashioned you know vaccines
[42:09.680 --> 42:16.160]  where it's dead polio or dead attenuated something else no no no now they're quote high tech ones
[42:16.160 --> 42:22.560]  where they mutate the viruses and release them and now the cdc gets the awareness of the outbreak that
[42:22.560 --> 42:31.040]  that they ladies and gentlemen are basically pushing
[42:36.960 --> 42:43.200]  now ladies and gentlemen i do want to get into obama's address and i do want to talk about
[42:43.200 --> 42:52.960]  um we have a bunch of these clips from obama and uh his his address which one should we go to first
[42:52.960 --> 43:06.640]  here because there's a lot of them i've had a lot of clips of obama before the show today
[43:06.640 --> 43:13.920]  say hey what you just take whichever one you want out of the hopper and i'll go i'll i'll i'll analyze it
[43:16.080 --> 43:21.760]  i realized that america's critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to
[43:21.760 --> 43:30.320]  live up to our ideals that america has plenty of problems within its own borders this is true
[43:30.320 --> 43:38.400]  in a summer marked by instability of the middle east and eastern europe i know the world also took
[43:38.400 --> 43:45.520]  notice of the small american city of ferguson missouri where a young man was killed and a community
[43:45.520 --> 43:56.480]  was divided so yes we have our own racial and ethnic tensions and like every country we continually
[43:56.480 --> 44:02.720]  wrestle with how to reconcile the vast changes wrought by globalization and greater diversity
[44:03.520 --> 44:05.120]  with the traditions that we hold dear
[44:08.560 --> 44:10.880]  but we welcome the scrutiny of the world
[44:13.120 --> 44:17.840]  because what you see in america is a country that has steadily worked to address our problems
[44:18.880 --> 44:20.800]  to make our union more perfect
[44:20.800 --> 44:29.040]  to bridge the divides that existed at the founding of this nation
[44:33.040 --> 44:38.480]  so it's all about america has guilt america is bad america is run by the new world order
[44:38.480 --> 44:44.080]  offshore mega banks mainly in europe so instead he's there like yeah we're bad but we're working
[44:44.080 --> 44:49.200]  to make it better thank you so much for bossing us around and i'm launching these strikes under
[44:49.200 --> 44:53.600]  nato authority not congressional authority i don't even want their authorization he's just
[44:53.600 --> 44:59.760]  they're groveling to the un and then i love how they give the police the training the armored
[44:59.760 --> 45:06.160]  vehicles the militarization the sniper equipment they send them out day one they're run by the feds
[45:06.160 --> 45:12.320]  with with with fake mall off cocktails out there we caught them we found the mall off cocktail cash
[45:13.440 --> 45:17.440]  the police were told don't go get it by the feds it was all staged okay
[45:17.440 --> 45:23.680]  okay all stirred up and then they go oh the feds are going to investigate local police and federalize
[45:23.680 --> 45:31.840]  them so they won't be so fuggish when it was pure globalist ran corporation national stabilization
[45:31.840 --> 45:38.400]  police force training that's been going on since the 90s and up better each year that did that those
[45:38.400 --> 45:43.440]  uniforms are federal grants there's two different ones you can get those armored vehicles federal
[45:43.440 --> 45:52.000]  grants the sniper training the tactics every single bit of it honed in fallujah iraq
[45:53.200 --> 45:59.600]  honed in areas of afghanistan like cobble all of it brought back here
[46:02.320 --> 46:07.680]  and i already knew it before i read it but i read mit magazine like six years ago seven years ago
[46:07.680 --> 46:14.240]  and they admitted that everything in iraq was a beta test for a smart grid to control everything
[46:14.240 --> 46:19.040]  we do domestically and they went on to say that disney world in disneyland and then whatever that
[46:19.040 --> 46:27.040]  weird disney community people live in out on the east coast and disney europe were all psych warfare
[46:27.040 --> 46:33.360]  tests run by the pentagon in real time on how to turn everything into a present for our security
[46:33.360 --> 46:39.920]  i mean you cannot make up how in the actual trade publications that the professors and people read
[46:39.920 --> 46:45.760]  it's all there because they want fellow travelers to understand they're led in on all this
[46:47.760 --> 46:49.520]  when the austin police chief's in here
[46:53.120 --> 46:56.800]  and his deputy chief or whatever we're sitting there talking about spiger and he goes oh you
[46:56.800 --> 47:00.800]  have no idea what we've got and i go yeah you got stuff that grabs all the cell phones in lifetime
[47:00.800 --> 47:06.720]  and he went oh and then the police chief turns and he goes no no we don't uh he's just joking
[47:08.560 --> 47:11.840]  i was like come on man i'm not the average idiot out there
[47:14.880 --> 47:18.160]  and i told asia vet i said you're gonna lose everything you got when this new order comes in
[47:18.160 --> 47:21.920]  serve it as much as you want it's the end of humanity as we know it it's the singularity
[47:21.920 --> 47:33.680]  without humans it's the transhumanist eugenics takeover hitler squared on pcp you don't join
[47:33.680 --> 47:40.640]  with this you don't work with it it's cancer we either eradicate the tyranny or it's over folks
[47:41.600 --> 47:45.840]  now michael you did find the articles because you came in and said hey uh you know we broke all this
[47:45.840 --> 47:50.800]  and i was like yeah i i know we broke it and you know look at ap look at the washington post why
[47:50.800 --> 47:56.000]  the fbi caught ordering police to not tell people about the stingray system stingray is only one
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.160]  part of it they don't even want to go to the telecoms now this has been going on for a long time
[48:00.160 --> 48:04.400]  and pay for the data without warrants and the telecoms are getting cold feet so they already
[48:04.400 --> 48:08.880]  want internet too because when they do the internet kill switch the police and the military and the
[48:08.880 --> 48:14.560]  government have to have their own grid so first and foremost michael you do a master article on this
[48:14.560 --> 48:22.800]  okay first and foremost it is a global grid in the west russia's putting in their own china's
[48:22.800 --> 48:26.800]  putting in their own government internet that's how it started to begin with if they call the
[48:26.800 --> 48:31.040]  internet to the university's major facilities that's the command hubs but they're putting in the
[48:31.040 --> 48:36.960]  saturation web to grab all the data outside of google so it's a race with google and microsoft
[48:36.960 --> 48:43.280]  and apple and amazon separately building their own grids but you've got the the feds and cyber
[48:43.280 --> 48:47.760]  command building their own grid the british already pioneered this a decade ago with these
[48:47.760 --> 48:52.160]  cell phone towers that grab everything these doppelganger cell phone towers so a mccail
[48:53.360 --> 48:57.760]  this is a master analysis my master analysis i mean just the master blueprint a gets their
[48:57.760 --> 49:01.520]  own internet so they can kill our internet and have communications as they wage war against their
[49:01.520 --> 49:07.120]  enemy homo sapien sapien because they see themselves as this homo sapien sapien transcendent
[49:07.120 --> 49:13.600]  and they've got other names for it but this is it this is a total war against humanity they are
[49:13.600 --> 49:17.520]  skynet the elite believe they're gonna merge with machines they are skynet you understand that
[49:17.920 --> 49:21.920]  just like in the last terminator it's a woman who merged with the computer turns out it's a human
[49:21.920 --> 49:27.920]  in there it's them merging with it attacking us this is skynet this is it folks and i'm here
[49:27.920 --> 49:35.040]  warning you before they roll the whole thing out okay now we've got that going on that's number one
[49:35.040 --> 49:38.400]  number two yes you got the secret documents on how it's their own communication network and
[49:38.400 --> 49:43.120]  they're stealing our data that's good then it's a story of how the media lied to people alternative
[49:43.120 --> 49:46.320]  media forced it out there so now they're having to admit it they don't ever want to have a debate
[49:46.320 --> 49:50.400]  about what they're doing whether it's drug running or child kidnapping people that run our government
[49:50.960 --> 49:55.680]  so good job i want to show people we're going to skip this homework break it's too important
[49:55.680 --> 50:01.200]  i want to show people here's an article you wrote in august of this year fbi ordered police
[50:01.200 --> 50:06.800]  department to conceal stingray use that's a month that's 25 days before the washington post
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.680]  but hey that's not good enough for you and to get you already mckayl felon november 12 2013
[50:11.680 --> 50:17.680]  exclusive government document reveals dhs domestic spy takeover with the secret cell phone towers
[50:17.680 --> 50:24.640]  with the documents with the photos from the police department city of seattle secret operations
[50:24.640 --> 50:29.520]  guy okay and they think you're so dumb there's their there's their grid they're not putting in
[50:29.520 --> 50:34.480]  quote free wi-fi because they love you understand they don't give you free shots because they love
[50:34.480 --> 50:38.480]  you they want you deader than a hammer and a lot of you won't listen but cops when your kid rolls
[50:38.480 --> 50:42.640]  over dead when they're 10 from the shots you gave when they were two remember i told you and you
[50:42.640 --> 50:47.040]  keep serving that government all you want because it's gonna bash your brains out when they're done
[50:47.040 --> 50:53.280]  they're gonna suck your soul real good see i have transcended them i know their plan i'm warning
[50:53.280 --> 50:58.480]  people and my soul's in the clear look at this right here you think you're part of the system
[50:58.480 --> 51:04.240]  because you've been given access to this you think yeah you got the fate of ring rates okay so there's
[51:04.240 --> 51:09.680]  the secret documents here's another one november 16th new mesh network documents confirm police
[51:09.680 --> 51:15.360]  vehicles real-time access to dhs spy cameras boom exclusive mystery of rogue cell towers
[51:15.360 --> 51:21.440]  discovered feds attempt to downplay growing spy grid they need to be able to kill grids selectively
[51:21.440 --> 51:30.320]  takeover radio and tv under the eas system your cell phone still gonna work but only to receive
[51:30.320 --> 51:36.000]  their data where they'll only have the communications during the takeover so they can put up video
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.760]  with me slitting kids throats or mackayle doing it or ron paul this is so they can jack whatever
[51:41.760 --> 51:46.800]  propaganda they want and show alex jones with a suicide vest blowing up the police department
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.200]  and of course really all we'll do is drive by and fire a missile into the police department
[51:51.200 --> 51:57.200]  this is how it's directly out of the running man directly so they could show militias blowing up
[51:57.200 --> 52:02.320]  daycares and then really it's the feds doing it it's not the feds this is globalists that have
[52:02.320 --> 52:11.840]  taken over and it's scientific it's a 21st century war and it's against humanity they called this
[52:11.840 --> 52:21.600]  grid in the 70s skynet they called putting up the gps the dozens and dozens of satellites
[52:21.600 --> 52:29.760]  orbiting the earth they called it the grid look it up they called it skynet all of this ladies
[52:29.760 --> 52:35.840]  and gentlemen and it's so funny to them with movies like the matrix and movies like terminator
[52:35.840 --> 52:43.280]  and all of this to just be preparing you preparing you preparing you they are skynet i don't know if
[52:43.280 --> 52:48.320]  they've got an artificially aware computer yet i don't know if they've gone as far as they say but
[52:48.320 --> 52:54.000]  i know that a lot of technology's 30 40 50 years behind and they selectively deploy what they want
[52:54.000 --> 53:02.640]  to us let's put it to you this way they had stuff like iphone six 30 years ago but they had to figure
[53:02.640 --> 53:09.200]  out how to deploy it all as trojan horses and how to test take and we put out vaccines and have
[53:09.200 --> 53:13.840]  thousands of girls in the u.s die from Gardasil shots and when the people learn it's Gardasil
[53:13.840 --> 53:20.800]  then we call it hpv then when they learn it's hpv we then call it papilloma and then when
[53:20.800 --> 53:25.680]  and then when they get you they keep changing the name the enemy keeps recloking recloking
[53:25.680 --> 53:30.480]  recloking recloking we discover their whole operation how they're running al-qaeda they
[53:30.480 --> 53:38.400]  changed the name to is isis isil khorasan and i said hundreds of times over a hundred they'll
[53:38.400 --> 53:43.600]  they'll bomb some little separate rogue group that may not even be real may be real and all
[53:43.600 --> 53:47.760]  these things they're bombing are clearly empty nothing's in them they're not killing anybody
[53:49.200 --> 53:52.160]  they may recycle some old gun footage or something now that i've been saying that and
[53:52.160 --> 53:56.080]  bringing it out and i'm not saying like i'm on a power trip folks they really do listen to what
[53:56.080 --> 54:04.400]  we say because they use any resistance as a war game theater to let us as they see us as a simulation
[54:04.400 --> 54:10.800]  even though we're real they use our resistance to make their computer smarter well let me just
[54:10.800 --> 54:15.120]  tell you something the ability to blow the planet up with thermal nuclear weapons doesn't mean you
[54:15.120 --> 54:21.680]  should do it and the ability to wage war psychological biological positronic spiritual
[54:21.680 --> 54:30.560]  energy war against humanity is the same thing you have released a singularity path you have
[54:30.560 --> 54:37.840]  released a singularity blueprint that anyone could look at and tell is going to be an abject total
[54:37.840 --> 54:42.640]  nightmare the public is going under mind control they're they're they're going into their own
[54:42.640 --> 54:47.680]  boxes they're going into virtual reality they're already being absorbed into the matrix right
[54:47.680 --> 54:54.240]  now the iqs are plunging the connectivity all the psychologists say the kids are like sociopaths now
[54:54.240 --> 55:01.200]  they aren't real people they are literally sucking the intellect sucking the destiny out of everyone
[55:01.200 --> 55:06.320]  right now they are hitting us with chemical biological radiological they are hammering us
[55:06.320 --> 55:12.800]  with electromagnetic they are hammering us with everything but being aware of it and fighting it
[55:12.800 --> 55:18.000]  is your body's resistance if you don't just try to adapt to the poison you won't actually adapt
[55:18.000 --> 55:24.000]  they're using our adaptability against us you don't just go along with it and just adapt when
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.600]  it's designed to incrementally destroy you that's a false adaptation you adapt by seeing it admitting
[55:29.600 --> 55:34.080]  the battle plan telling your subconscious mind come up with answers against it praying to god for
[55:34.080 --> 55:39.200]  answers and beginning to resist in small ways it will create wavelengths of mass movement and energy
[55:39.200 --> 55:44.880]  where we will actually take their attack and it will cause psychological positive what you could
[55:44.880 --> 55:52.240]  call mutations in thinking and thought that will allow us at so many levels to defeat the enemy
[55:55.040 --> 55:59.760]  the syndicate and in the science fiction movie it's real i've been studying it for 23 years
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.400]  ladies and gentlemen and i was one of the first people at this level to fight it so i was given
[56:04.400 --> 56:11.840]  the intel early on all of it and let me tell you the intel i was given was accurate the intel i was
[56:11.840 --> 56:19.200]  given was spot on a lot of i never even covered on air because it was so far out you better know
[56:19.200 --> 56:24.960]  the people in the system are absolutely beyond being scared now they realize it's all true it's
[56:24.960 --> 56:29.600]  all real it's all happening mckelth great job i'm now i just drug you in here earlier and you
[56:29.600 --> 56:34.320]  didn't have the articles i wanted to show people it's not about us going oh we're big we broke it
[56:34.320 --> 56:41.680]  uh brave people gave us this information absolutely we'll just say it yeah i'm gonna say it brave
[56:41.680 --> 56:46.800]  people gave us this info and it shows what horrors the media are they know all this they've been lying
[56:46.800 --> 56:52.240]  but now they're having to admit it i believe because they were already made obsolete they're
[56:52.240 --> 56:56.880]  lying and denying it existed didn't work and so now they're having to admit it just have any
[56:56.880 --> 57:02.160]  credibility so they still have a conduit to jack lies absolutely yeah last month you know i talked
[57:02.160 --> 57:06.320]  to a guy named pete mosec from washington state who actually did the public's records request
[57:06.320 --> 57:10.640]  and found out that the fbi has been pushing these out of course because the fed they're pushing this
[57:10.640 --> 57:14.800]  out locally it all funnels back up to the nsa we have all these local governments doing even talking
[57:14.800 --> 57:20.800]  to nsa whistleblowers off record yeah and on yes exactly they've confirmed all this so uh yeah it's
[57:20.800 --> 57:25.680]  interesting that now a month later they're coming out and finally saying yes the fbi does do this and
[57:25.680 --> 57:31.680]  which uh you know it's not really new news but as you said the media is trying so hard to remain
[57:31.680 --> 57:37.600]  credible because uh real journalists and real people independent media and some of the you know
[57:37.600 --> 57:41.600]  of course mainstream media are doing a great job at getting actual real documentation showing that
[57:41.600 --> 57:46.000]  the spy grid isn't you know a quote conspiracy and that we're actually seeing all these technologies
[57:46.000 --> 57:49.600]  being deployed from the fed stand to the local level and even if you don't want to have a cell
[57:49.600 --> 57:53.200]  phone now they're stealing your data and tracking you a lot of time and listening to you they admit
[57:53.200 --> 57:58.400]  listening to you without a warrant so they also go to jail but no no it's to keep it safe mcale
[57:58.400 --> 58:03.520]  so now it's face scanning software just went nationwide it was already nationwide well it's
[58:03.520 --> 58:07.280]  interesting also is that someone else in seattle they were outside of a protest recently and they
[58:07.280 --> 58:11.760]  noticed when they turned on their phone to check out some wi-fi connections that one of the nodes
[58:11.760 --> 58:15.600]  was happened to be on right near them and it was a node right next to where the protest was and that

[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:21.440]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:31.840]  cal you want to tell that ci story sure absolutely uh you know right before i moved here i don't want
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:40.080]  to say too much but a person i know sort of who has ci training the military i ran into him and
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:44.000]  i hadn't seen him in a couple years he said hey what are you doing i said oh i'm about to move
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.960]  here in a few days go to texas uh worked for alex jones he said oh i know alex jones i said really
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.880]  so what do you think about him and this guy uh does a lot of black operations to the cia
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.960]  psychological operations he said you know i've listened to him before and i and i always say
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.760]  to myself how does he know some of the things he does and i said well you know there's a lot of
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.400]  high-level people have been on the show and whistleblowers have come forward to move the
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:10.080]  year so he talked about a situation seattle he said where they were using um of course kind of
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.400]  cell phone tracking devices to find a guy that they said they thought was in isis in seattle and
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.920]  he said some pretty crazy stuff so but he was trying to be kind of hush hush but it was but
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.640]  do you see there's real isis they're letting them come in so that mid-level and low-level
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.680]  actually have something to fight just as a simulant like you put dye into a vein to track things
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.160]  but then they're going to flip it on the american people just like they've already done with with
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.200]  homeland security but again they have to get the patriots that are in the government to do it going
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.960]  up against simulated but also real terrorists absolutely yeah and so uh he said um you know he
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.480]  said i wouldn't trust me which was kind of interesting because he said some of the things he
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.560]  had to do and black ops but i mean he at least had some remorse that seemed like he knew that
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:55.360]  a lot of things they asked him to do were pretty out there well it's all a test and then if you
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:00.080]  don't do a certain point then they know your type and then they put you in a filed area and they
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.000]  you know send you off to do this or do that and then the people that they don't they don't want
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.080]  the ones that are total psychopaths because those really can't be trusted they want people that are
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.880]  intelligent but it'll do bad things believing is for a greater good and they can psychologically
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.240]  test them and decide though that they can never admit that they were wrong so they will stay
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:21.440]  under their control forever but then they also have actuaries and computer models to know when
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:25.520]  that person might actually wake up and say no and so they're scheduled to be killed
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.080]  before they wake up let's say they're 35 doing it they're scheduled to be killed when they're
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:35.840]  say 56 because the computer model shows that by 60 they would wake up then they're killed at 56
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:42.560]  so it it's all about deception it's all about betrayal it's all about dishonor it's all about
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:50.080]  pure evil mckill yeah i'm not surprised i mean what can you say well they got a lot of killers
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:54.320]  on their payroll and uh i just think it's interesting because i mean i don't want to die
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:58.160]  in stuff but that's you know kind of a cool way to go out and one of their people kills me i mean
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:02.400]  you know hell that's uh it's like the vikings die with a sword in your hand you know what i mean
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.480]  all i know is i'm not signing on to shooting all these kids up with all these deadly viruses and
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:10.160]  garbage in the industry little kids everywhere looking like they're half dead you out there on
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.960]  the street the kids look like walking dead brother yeah little kids don't look don't look they look
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.440]  really sick and here's the deal i know you're doing it and i'm not signed on to it and all of
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:24.560]  you that serve the system you're signed on go to a cemetery with all those dead kids and remember
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.240]  that's your work feel good about it that's the good thing about being in the right and just doing
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.080]  what you know is more leave right because uh no matter what happens to you you know you did all
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:37.200]  you could so uh there's no regrets no there are no regrets hey well what do you think working on
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.840]  the operation and it's incredible uh you know people always ask me that too what's it like and
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:46.240]  you know i'm i'm still an info wars fan you know i spend my weekends watching info wars video so i
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:50.640]  i still kind of have that outside perspective uh so yeah it's really incredible to see the huge crew
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:56.720]  and uh how uh the general himself working oh give me a break no no seriously though i mean
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.920]  you're not really directed we can see you're a good rider you understand what's going on
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.800]  here's basically left your own devices yeah i think that's what i think that's what you do
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.240]  with a lot of your employees you find people who are self-sustaining who you don't need to
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.000]  you know tell what to do all the time and then it just kind of runs on its own the whole operation
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.360]  you know we just seek the truth we're openly biased about telling truth openly bias against
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:20.480]  tyranny and that's just that's all we say you know go with the truth go with what's full spectrum
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:25.680]  though not one sided not we have to look at everything yeah i mean too many people want
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.400]  to make so many issues black and white when things are multi-layered you know all issues are so
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.720]  especially with these overseas situations you know people want to say a sod is good or a sod is
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:38.480]  bad it's not that simple you know it's things are much more complicated than people yeah i mean a
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:43.680]  sod didn't he's bad but he he's like on a scale of one to ten he's a two yeah compared to al-qaeda
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:50.160]  it's like a ten and but who's worse like spinal tap 11 is our government because
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.600]  they're one fun in al-qaeda like who's worse than al-qaeda the people that are funding them and all

[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:11.760]  enemy lines the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.680]  well i got pretty wound up in the last hour
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:28.720]  the u.s. is carrying out vast majority of strikes on ices military officials say well i went and
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.840]  read very carefully this morning when i got about six a.m the press released the data sheets and the
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:40.800]  video is being put out by the pentagon of these so-called strikes and most of them are against
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:53.040]  the corazon group that is an al-qaeda group spin-off and they all fit the mo of double triple agents
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.720]  who've been able to survive for more than a decade
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.520]  and if they did want to try to launch a terror attack this would be the kind of group that doesn't
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:12.240]  but basically this is a wahhabis suni jihad against shia and held areas and is a repeat of
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:17.280]  three or four wars that have happened in the last 300 years between these groups
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:26.160]  that's all that's happening and our government is backing the sunis out of saudi arabia to run this
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:33.760]  jihad and so everybody freaked out in our military and i literally cried when they said we're not
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:38.000]  going to bombard syria and turn it over to al-qaeda to chop everybody's heads off they already killed
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.880]  over 300 000 people at that point i literally got a tear in my eye thinking maybe we can save america
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:49.840]  we beat their main propaganda push terry 15 months ago said if we do not attack they will nuke us
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:56.400]  uh senator graham came out and said the the east coast will be nuked remember all that
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.680]  one day after we said there's missing nukes from dais
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:10.400]  and guess what that was that that really happened boys and girls that really happened
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:16.480]  i don't know exactly what's going on but it didn't look good then obama says a week after
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.760]  that my number one fear is a mushroom cloud in manhattan a nuke didn't say who
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:32.560]  and we had to attack Assad or they said al-qaeda would nuke america the arm services committee
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:47.600]  had graham and others saying take out Assad or al-qaeda will hit us when Assad is a Shiite alawai
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:57.120]  arch enemies with them in a death battle see it's the preying on the ignorance that just when
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:03.600]  you know the players it's like saying batman works for the joker
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:15.920]  it's like saying the dallas cowboys are in dc it's just patent absolute ball-faced baloney
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:26.480]  to bamboozle the public and then i ask if poll shows 67 one isa struck well i want to kill isis
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:32.080]  i want to see isis dead i mean these are really craze-eyed scum of the earth psychos that are
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.160]  allowed to travel out of the u.s in england and europe in the middle east it's in mainstream news
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:42.160]  that they let them fly into turkey drive around on buses with guns in front of her but when nobody
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:47.040]  else can have guns they're openly being armed they're being protected they're allowed to use the
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.120]  internet they're allowed to use facebook and twitter and we're getting frustrated all the time and
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:58.480]  blocked they obviously have been armed by the west they've obviously been protected they're 95 percent
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:05.280]  of the jihad forces over there not 65 that's directly from high level congressional level
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:13.280]  meetings two week old information in congress two weeks ago they were told 95 percent are actually
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:22.000]  al-qaeda they fly the flags openly everyone knows okay and then obama gets up there and is bombing
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.800]  some group that was imminently about to attack us and i said over and over again they'll bomb
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:32.880]  some little subgroup real or not i don't know because they can't bomb the quote good militants
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:40.640]  that's al-qaeda renamed isle all these other names because that's where they're arming and resupplying
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:48.080]  right now the real story is the 500 million publicly because they're so worried about impeachment
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:53.680]  or hearings about arming al-qaeda the last four years in libya and syria that they're now doing
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:58.880]  all this to cover up what really happened and get public approval and congressional approval to the
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:06.960]  500 million and then more will flow to resupply al-qaeda to take out a sod but they don't want
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:18.080]  you to know they're funding al-qaeda and that's what's happening there are no ifs ands or buts
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:23.760]  from any way you slice it now i'm gonna do this right now i rarely do this i should do it more
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:29.200]  often occasionally we say only obama supporters can call in i'm gonna do that again today in this
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:35.440]  hour second hour only people that support obama or if you think i'm wrong about the players in
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:40.480]  the middle east and you want to disagree with me and i don't want joke callers that call in and go
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:45.840]  oh hi alex i think you raised those because you're not against it you know uh bombing uh
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:51.040]  you know blah blah blah you're not for bombing isis you're for them i want serious people i know
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:55.600]  there are millions of people listening right now to conservatively there are three million people
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.720]  listening right now very conservative low number three million people are listening right now i know
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:06.160]  you're out there let me give the number out for you slowly one well under common core you could
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.520]  just give out any number that would call me but that's not how things work we can't say two plus
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:17.280]  two equals five here so or 11 and you know seven uh i'm sorry folks that does equal 18 and common

[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:03.600]  that's who i work for is my conscience i work for not being a coward i work for being honorable at
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:13.280]  the end of my days i work for being bonafide not in the sight of this system but the sight of god
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:22.560]  that's who i work for oh yeah he works for god well i mean i'm against abortion i'm against

[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.040]  headchoppers and that's why i'm against this intervention because it's all fake and it's
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:37.760]  an excuse and a smokescreen to arm them for the next phase and you watch in three four months
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:44.720]  they're going to be trying to bring down a side again hell the us ambassador the un said sunday
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:49.600]  we aired it monday she said no this is about toppling a side so i guess they're already doing it
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:58.720]  see it's so oxymoronic it's such a fraud it's bizarro land it's like allison wonderland's tea
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.960]  party with just insanity with like glasses with holes in the bottom as you pour the tea in it's
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:08.880]  just it it's that's maxi of ellian the policy is so twisted so evil the average person just can't
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:18.400]  even understand it they did the same thing and i ran in 53 a secular pro america leader but he
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.720]  wanted some of the oil money to build their country and build universities mohammed mozadek so they
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:27.280]  hired a bunch of radical jihadis to blow up government buildings and shoot people then they
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:34.560]  blamed mozadek arrested him executed his whole command and then double crossed the jihadis and
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:39.600]  put the shawian so i i mean i think they will double cross the jihadis down the road here but
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:45.440]  you don't say oh to win in the middle east we turn al-qaeda loose to murder the oldest christian
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:54.880]  areas in the world the globalists have the same bad will against us they have against the poor
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.120]  syrians and the poor egyptians and the poor libeans they hate everybody
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.920]  the globalists get off on their disdain it would be so easy just to start hating everybody it'd be
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:11.680]  so easy to not play by the rules it'd be so easy to be cold-blooded it'd be so easy to turn off
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:18.960]  my emotions but i'd be that would be turning my soul off and i will not do it but they've done it
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:25.760]  eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one you want that number eight hundred two

[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:09.360]  come your masters of war by the way the headline on drugs report is war on war
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:16.000]  I say give them another four or five Nobel Peace Prizes for arming al-Qaeda and now bombing some
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  little subgroup may not have even happened I don't know how I know exactly what they're gonna do
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:25.040]  because I'm on record I wish we had the staff to find it but any listener who listens every week
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:31.440]  knows I've said in the last month probably 30 times that they would bomb some little subgroup
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:38.480]  and not the real group because the whole thing is ISIS all the rebels are ISIS so now Obama says
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:44.960]  quote we have to have a war on war that's like you and peacekeepers running around slaughtering
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:50.560]  people and it's always peaceful it makes me cry John Harmon who answers the phones I wouldn't
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.440]  really call it screams them because we don't really screen them we get your name or your
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.240]  calling from or if you have a topic you want to bring up so so we know we're talking about when
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:03.840]  we go to you and when he asked do you support Obama do you think Alex is wrong about what's
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:09.200]  happening in the Middle East do you think the sky's really red not blue at high noon they all begin
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:16.320]  laughing okay how about just general Obama supporters or how about folks that like Boehner
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:22.400]  funding Obamacare supporting open borders saying Obama's right to have this fake war on ISIS
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:29.440]  to act like they're not running them and that's all this is I would like to hear
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:35.920]  from you out there or maybe carbon taxes are good maybe maybe you believe paying Al Gore money
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:42.160]  will save us 800 259 92 31 you notice Tuesday I give the number out like two or three times on the
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:46.800]  show and we have enough callers the last 10 years but not when I'm calling for Obama supporters
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:55.760]  800 259 92 31 what about Obama supporters for Obamacare how you liken them apples
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:01.760]  Ron in Canada are you really a supporter of our dear leader
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:09.680]  one sec yes I am actually I am an Obama supporter because I like Obamacare
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:14.560]  and but you're in Canada you're in Canada yes
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.720]  can you talk yes well basically what I want to say is I like I see what Obama is doing in
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:30.160]  Syrian Iraq he's right now he's bombing them can you hear that can your viewers hear this
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:38.320]  they're firing hellfire missiles on ISIS right now that's the proof on YouTube well that's better
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:43.520]  than when CNN did the fake chemical attacks on Riyadh Saudi Arabia and it was all on a blue screen
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:47.200]  and then the live feed went out and TV stations grabbed it with them joking and laughing with
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:55.280]  the blue screen off so I mean I guess it is real in fact we're here Alex Jones reporting for CNN
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:03.120]  I am here in Syria and I'm battling al Qaeda here here in fact I'll draw a picture for TV viewers
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:10.960]  which proves it this is a this is real here document cam shot please here we go here is
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:17.840]  the jihadi and we're going to drop a missile on him he's got his little machine gun here
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:26.400]  and like my missile goes there we go I blow him up I'm against al Qaeda I'm a peace prize winner
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:33.520]  here I mean how's that sound sound good everybody
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:39.920]  it's no it's true I said so I'm the media it's true two plus two equals five
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:46.240]  we're blowing up al Qaeda it's a real attack down with al Qaeda down with them we're we're
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:52.960]  defeating Coruscant how's that sound okay the incident is actually kicking some ass right now
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:58.160]  hey listen I appreciate your call can as we go to break can we turn up the the the the
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:02.720]  original hours of singing in laughing at their viewers and then they come back live
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:06.880]  and then they fall down and say nerve gas attacks have happened I remember watching this as a teenager
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:14.320]  I was like 14 at my girlfriend's house with her dad and her and and just thinking man this
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:19.600]  really looks fake when they were on tv going oh my mask nerve gas oh my gosh we're under attack
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.960]  in Saudi Arabia here here let's go out to break with someone just play it randomly go ahead
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:27.840]  from my right to my left and there's a cloud of something it looks like it might have been an
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:39.600]  explosion of crowd they were in Atlanta
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.600]  you're not watching on tv it's not as funny
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:53.280]  look at how that's scared there hasn't been in the gas
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:59.120]  and they're in the breaks he's certainly not laughing smoke cigarettes you probably may smell
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.280]  some of the fumes from a uh and missile exhaust going off he's laughing
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:08.400]  he's using a block at a chord I tell me sort of burning and we just heard a little funk just then
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.040]  but I have to apologize for that I just heard a little thump he's heard a little thump
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:15.040]  he's heard a little thump he's heard a little thump he's heard a little thump he's heard a little thump

[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:33.840]  jumped out of bed uh hearing the air raid want to go on your run down three flights of stairs
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:37.200]  to get out of here it's probably a hundred yards you hike in the middle of a little bit
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:41.600]  then your nerves look at that act as they are one thing we have to point out just bring on them right

[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:29.680]  alex jones so the establishment had a problem our military woke up to the fact that it was true
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:33.200]  criminal elements of our government were arming al qaeda the muslim brotherhood and others
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:38.880]  to actually take over the middle east so our military wouldn't go along with it so now there's
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:46.320]  a big pr campaign to bomb some little chorus on group so obama looks like he's tough on muslim extremist
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:50.320]  that's that's what's going on we're going to go to your phone calls now we do have
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:54.400]  people claiming they're obama supporters but we just opened the phones up in general now
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:58.240]  because it is hard to get obama supporters to call in because they don't know how to dial
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:06.000]  telephones and i'm not you watch msnbc it's all about how smart liberals are well the average
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:14.320]  well-meaning person that supports some liberal issues like you know sexual equality or you know
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:18.880]  trying to help the poor they might be intelligent in ways but they're still being manipulated
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.680]  i can disagree with some of their ideas but they're nice people but the folks up on top of it
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:32.400]  are literally praying on the dumbest of the dumb and i have found that democrats in general are
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:45.360]  are the most conceited know-it-all state-loving acolytes it's a religion of the state and it's
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:49.040]  very very sad they're fake liberals thomas jefferson was a liberal they're not liberals
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:53.280]  now you can see the new team america video that we played at the start of the show today
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:57.520]  that rob do put together it's pretty hilarious but also sad tying it into how our government's
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:03.440]  funding al-qaeda we need that video to go viral i think it will it's on info wars dot com
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.680]  and prison planet dot com and we're going to tweet it out right now at real alex chones
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:17.520]  new team america released also special report obama wants amnesty for murderers and rapists
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:21.760]  john bown i i want to play that in the next hour guys john bown did a great report yesterday on
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:28.880]  abola i never aired on air that too moderate us armed syrian rebels slam obama's airstrikes on
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:33.760]  extremist that's all for public consumption folks are being told to do that we're so angry how dare
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:43.600]  you obama one yeah i like you you have uh the truth about us airstrikes on syria with syrian
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:48.400]  girl paul Watson interviewed her grandfather formerly ran syria and is on a fan of a sod
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:53.840]  uh representative jones on syria attacks says why do we have a constitution by the way i want to
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:58.960]  get walter jones on asap guys that's at the top of my list let's go after him who introduced the
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:04.000]  bill to release the 28 pages uh and there's another report detailing from washington's blog with all
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:10.320]  the proof u.s forces u.s foreign policy created many more terrorists than it killed
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:17.920]  and tony cartelucci article u.s aggression drags world into age of global anarchy that's
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:23.360]  because it's not u.s aggression it's globalists running our country to destabilize things so
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:26.720]  the globalists can come in with no blame and take over the wreckage
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:38.800]  look at this headline out of the national journal why is kansas preparing for a zombie
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:43.440]  apocalypse we were telling you about this for three years now state and local governments
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:52.320]  trained to quote shoot zombies that's a simulation of shooting abola patients or shooting rioting
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:57.040]  crowds i'm gonna say this again if they have the police and military training to mow down
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:02.480]  unarmed civilians it'd be a major controversy just call it zombie training and they now admit that
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:11.520]  so i'm gonna be breaking that down as well let's go to your calls who says they uh support obama
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:16.400]  dj claims he does we're going to robert tim terrence james and others okay dj are you a real
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:26.880]  caller uh yes alex this is dj from alabama and um i will say that i voted for obama twice
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:32.640]  the first time i voted for him was because well you know i guess john mccain was pretty much a
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:38.720]  treasonous traitor who sold secrets to the vietnam so it was the lesser of two evils and then i voted
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:47.200]  when uh and then i voted for obama against um um what's what's his name he got from
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:54.000]  mitten's romney yeah romney yeah romney i voted for him against romney because i thought romney
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:03.680]  was a buffoon but it's like to be uh to be completely uh um honest alex it's like i uh no
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:08.240]  doubt first when i first heard you on jesse ventura i thought you were crazy and then i saw you on
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:13.600]  pierce morgan i was like holy crap and it's like now i've read like two books i've read
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:18.800]  david rocher foe's memoirs and i've read the big new brazinski's book the job and it's like i feel
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:25.120]  like an idiot for voting for obama now because i really feel bad and it's like now i like go around
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:30.000]  all the black communities because i'm black now because at first what i heard you say is i thought
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.600]  you were crazy but you said that 40 percent of black babies are aborted and i was like this guy has
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:40.560]  to be lying and then i did my research and found out it was true so now all i do is walk around with
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:46.000]  the info wars and i tell black people all around the country man you know i just go around telling
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.360]  them that hey 40 percent of black babies are aborted that margaret stanger was a eugenicist
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:56.080]  that bill gates probably used to be the head of uh planned parenthood and that man to just completely
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:00.800]  get away from these organizations so yes i did vote for obama but i do think i'd vote for
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:06.160]  probably ran poll or somebody like that now well that's awesome but listen i was sick of bush
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:11.520]  after eight years but bush was just a front like obama is it's that you know obama they tried to
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:16.960]  create a cause celeb that they could sell their whole agenda on and then say you were racist if
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:22.720]  you didn't support him i quite frankly don't get caught flat footed very often i got caught flat
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:29.040]  footed by obama it's been much worse than i thought it would be um he came off kind of as a nice guy
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.560]  even though he was anti-gun i didn't support him i hope there could be racial reconciliation i
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:40.960]  bought into maybe 10 of the kool-aid because it was just such an onslaught of propaganda
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:46.960]  but in hindsight i i know people wanted to believe there could be change people wanted to
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:50.640]  believe that things could be better he said he wouldn't come after our guns he said he would
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.360]  get jobs going again he he said just like we're gonna believe in the next republican and then
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:00.400]  try to vote for them and they'll betray us until we look past the puppets and look to the actual
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:06.400]  controllers i get people that voted for obama over mccain or over romney uh because they were conned
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:12.160]  what i don't get is people that still support it and still don't admit that he was their greatest
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:21.520]  tool and that he was literally the first synthetic president we see an obama the 2.0 puppet and they
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:29.600]  are just really taking this country down by design and they're investing in him and placing on him
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:38.480]  dictatorial powers and they're not being blocked so that the president is set to make the bureaucracy
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:44.480]  a dictatorship with a titular head that is a president they control and so for all intents
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:50.880]  and purposes we can officially say america is in an oligarchy run by an executive branch
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:59.360]  and bureaucratic uh hierarchy that has overthrown the republic and is waging systematic scientific
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:07.120]  cultural war on any pillar of society because they see any pillar of society as something
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.760]  that we might organize around even if those pillars aren't perfect they want them destroyed
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:19.280]  because they want total control it is a just a sickening will to power i want to hear from
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:24.000]  republicans that the neocons and the fake conservatives are a scourge working with obama
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:29.120]  i want to hear them admit they were wrong we all have to admit how we were wrong we've all got
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:34.800]  to admit we were once dumb as dirt and it's a process that we won't get fooled again and i think
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:39.120]  that's starting to happen uh but i was being a little bit sarcastic earlier you know saying call
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:44.960]  in and tell me that obama isn't just smoke screening the fact that they funded al qaeda so the fact
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:51.040]  they're having to do all this shows how thin uh their storyline is getting but very powerful
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:57.360]  story dj anything else uh yes alec i want to make this last point that when i was reading
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:04.000]  burzinski's book he said that when he was on the trilateral coalition um when he formed with uh
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:11.440]  david rockfeller that um that basically he actually picked jimmy carter to be president yes and basically
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:16.960]  we basically don't have any presidents who are really picked by the people all you know uh basically
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.880]  all these presidents are picked by the council on four relations in the trilateral commission
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:27.600]  so obama's basically picked and you know and um basically obama got his orders from him and kissinger
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:31.760]  when general james jones went down there and said that hey you know we basically get our foreign
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:37.040]  policy from kissinger so man we're basically screwed but out you know um alex but i'm out here trying
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:43.600]  to awake everybody black people white people and all the mexicans that hey man if we all just unite
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:48.240]  for liberty and freedom and we can really take back the new world that's right that's why they
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:52.400]  want divide and conquer god bless you we've got to unite around basic common sense of the truth
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:59.840]  and see that's why i'm frustrated i've read i think four or five of brazinski's books i've read all
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:12.400]  three of um tragedy and hope authors books i have just i've gotten the point i'll be honest
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:16.080]  that i haven't read a lot of books lately i read a lot of magazine articles news articles stuff that
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:20.080]  comes in and i end in clips i've just already know who they are i already know what they do
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:25.680]  i've already been to six billderberg meetings i've already had them threatened to murder my family
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:28.960]  and i mean that's when the phone rings and no numbers come up and they're threatening you and
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:32.960]  then tell you what you were doing two minutes ago in your backyard and start laughing at you
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:39.600]  but doesn't intimidate me i just say you know glad i'm not you bring it
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:46.320]  and i know how real this is folks get involved in the fight against the new world order you'll
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:51.760]  discover as well only reason they haven't killed me yet is they don't want to make me a martyr
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:44:00.160]  no exaggeration it's got to be 25 times i'll be at a book signing a video signing an event
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:05.520]  and here comes the you know the plainclothes informant or whatever and hey alex let's uh

[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:13.680]  new york we're gonna move quick now go ahead robert hey alex good to talk to man uh i actually got
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:19.040]  turned on to you by jel salante who's been a friend of mine for 30 years and started following you
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:24.640]  for for for a very long time and totally back the uh the cause and and what you're doing but
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:32.560]  my point is is um uh years ago uh i got injured and needed you know just spinal cord injury
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:37.360]  and needed a wheelchair went through the um process of getting you know durable medical
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:44.960]  equipment as they call it and back in 79 it was it was you know pretty easy to get through uh uh
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:51.440]  and get the equipment i needed needless to say i went on to get off the system was self afforded
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:59.920]  25 years paid my taxes i ran a jewelry store and uh and then recently due to due to some um
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:06.800]  some other medical problems had to get had to get rid of the store and um and get back on
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:13.840]  disability but the issues and and the problems that i'm facing going through this obama care
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:23.520]  mays are just absolutely absurd and insane and it's just it's it's a it's a joke it's a joke
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:29.360]  well what you just said is how they govern us they govern us by confusion by denial by making
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:34.000]  things so weird that no one can ever figure it out and then at the end of the day you find out
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:39.840]  years later it was a giant tax increase that's how these screw jobs work now we've seen a fourth
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:47.840]  name given to al-qaeda court assigned to confuse everyone that's what they do that's all they do
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:54.080]  why do you think common core tells kids they don't have a spell right or know how to add two plus two
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:58.880]  it's all meant to turn people into a bunch of idiots and you know it's come out in federal court
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:04.000]  cases um that for at least 20 years they won't hire cops in most departments with over a hundred
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.920]  iq because they found quote they won't follow orders well i don't think it's work because the
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:14.960]  police i talk to are pretty smart and know that there's a setup going on but they're sure trying
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:19.120]  so that so if they can't do that they'll just dump everybody down with fluoride in the water
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:26.080]  that's how you know the the papa lion will sometimes eat the baby lion to knock out his
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:33.040]  competition or or the you know the male grizzly bear will come find the female grizzly bear
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:39.600]  and will kill the males will kill a male baby because he doesn't want that competition and
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:44.000]  that's what eugenics is it isn't trying to make the race better as they say it's actually targeting

[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:11.200]  an iron supply in the host to thrive and replicate just as chemical poisons parasites are
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:16.800]  propagated via the food and water supply and vaccines those born after 1945 have the vaccine
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:21.840]  parasites the vaccine parasites have a virulence level that will trigger mass activation now
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:26.480]  due to iron accumulating at an unprecedented rate this is why disease symptoms and conditions are
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:31.120]  exploding in prevalence disease is caused by the same underlying condition iron poisoning and low
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:37.680]  copper status measles ebola enteroviruses are nano particle parasites so when the officials say to
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:42.160]  prepare for pandemics it is because they know of attempts to release a virulent parasites into
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:47.200]  the population and they know the vaccine parasites are about to activate on a mass scale this is

[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:52.320]  just say that um english being my third language i'm not as an eloquent speaker as you so i'm sorry
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:58.880]  for the audience well you sound pretty smart buddy go ahead uh so you know i i found out about you
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:04.160]  you know via the pierce morgan interview and you know the you know the whole point was about you
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:09.680]  know gun control and the second amendment and then slightly share with the viewers uh my experience
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:16.880]  when i was in algeria in the 90s we had uh you know an islamic insurgency there so islamists were
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:22.640]  trying to take over you know the country and so they were killing left and right and then you had the
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:28.880]  you know the criminal syndicate in the garments there so as a you know free human being who just
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:33.280]  happened to be born there you know you stuck right so you had the garment who's armed who's
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:39.200]  corrupt and then you have the islamists right and they were killing left and right and things
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:45.280]  change when people got fed up and they told the garment they said you know if he don't give us
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:50.640]  weapons to defend ourselves we'll start killing you your families and the islamist that means you
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:55.600]  know they were that's right i followed that with the islamists from the north funded by the cia
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:56:00.960]  attacking to destabilize and put pressure on the mainly christian and animus government
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:06.240]  there in ijeria the people started demanding their own second amendment tell folks more about that
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:14.080]  yes so and this is in algeria and uh so it's funny you said algeria because similar things
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:22.960]  happened uh also in ijeria yeah so you know that right yeah you know with the whole you know christian
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:29.440]  and muslim situation going on in ijeria there but you know in the 90s in algeria uh so at first
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:35.040]  the government said no so then people start forming uh death you know death squad so you
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:40.800]  had civilians uh you know just grabbing knives and whatever and going into you know islamic
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:45.840]  territories and start killing off people well yeah the same thing happened uh in mexico after they
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:50.800]  took all the guns crime rates exploded they came and got guns here illegally and they're actually
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:56.880]  shutting the crime down in areas all over mexico with the with the small caliber and single shot
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:02.160]  and and you know street-bought guns against the drug cartels that are buying military equipment
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:08.480]  uh so very powerful story tell folks more about algeria so i mean i mean you know the broader
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:12.480]  point even like in the whole arbor pretty pretty much you know you know you always hear about people
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:16.400]  will complain you know where are the moderates you know where are the you know the you know the
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:21.120]  normal people there we know that they're the problem is you know if you want to say freedom
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:26.720]  you know or have a republic you know the government will shoot at you if you want to grab a bear after
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:31.600]  a long day of work the islamists will shoot at you so you know people they're stuck the
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:36.080]  i hear you the vast majority of what i've seen in the middle east north africa are just moderate
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:41.360]  folks hard working smart people want to have a life and then the west is busy funding the radical
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:48.080]  jihads to basically try to turn the place into a stone age area and the entire middle east
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:56.400]  to north africa and other areas was very advanced until the last 1400 years and it has been basically
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:01.760]  brought backwards unfortunately because of all the warfare caused by the clashes and the expansion
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:06.640]  of islam it is just a fact i'm not bashing muslims themselves but you can look at the middle east
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:13.520]  pre islam versus after islam and the the the wars to first dominate the middle east and then
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:20.400]  dominate around that and to invade europe and have not been good and that that allowed
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:24.000]  a leech to entrench themselves in the west and christened them because of the outside
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:29.040]  threat as well war is good for thugs to stay in power good to hear from you abdel in canada

[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:05.920]  by real clinical studies the new oxy powder available through info wars life was invented
[01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:11.200]  during doctor group's research on the toxification of our bodies many herbal colon cleansers are
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:16.880]  harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients oftentimes full of synthetic
[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:22.880]  fillers gmo's additives or worse gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start

[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:46.640]  saudis from the kataris weapons by the truck load and we are now forced to fight against
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:02:10.480]  our own weapons and this body wants to throw more weapons into the mix but what happens
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:19.360]  if the terrorist game is through then the military industrial complex doesn't have a
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:22.640]  war to fight anymore and the big banks don't have a distraction to get us into debt
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:29.280]  they would make our trip serve five six seven eight tours on average about three
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:35.680]  and then put them on death list and not give them basic medical care because it would quote save money
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:44.480]  that's an elite that are scum and it's time to admit it america america has a lot of good

[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:26.160]  he has he has as a propagandist forum he got a lot done but it's also backfired in many respects
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:33.360]  i agree with you um that uh the the establishment's in trouble sorry about that but no i mean the
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:38.720]  first thing i think he said was he was gonna finance a trillion dollar deficit by uh magical means
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:43.920]  and then he was one of the first presidents ever that didn't get a war when he demanded it
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:50.720]  people don't believe him the mistakes this guy has made has just outed the establishment left
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:56.080]  right and center well let's not just blame obama let me the elite are so macchiavellian that they
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:01.120]  don't even have a narrative anymore and then they lose the soft power they had but i agree with you
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:06.320]  that they are making us a joke that's why we've got to explain they're not us
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:13.760]  bush got away with and the belief that he commanded versus the absolute disbelief that
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:21.040]  obama causes by walking into rooms if you want to expose corruption this guy for some reason tried
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:25.680]  to sell a war i think the only president in the united states that didn't get it and what do you
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:32.800]  guys average a war per president or a war per term so i mean for a president to say war i think it
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:40.480]  was syria and then not get it plus i mean he hasn't the coalition behind him the bush had
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:46.960]  the coalition being a natal force which is mostly british commonwealth country nobody's
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:51.280]  following obama this guy can't tell a straight story that birth certificate of his

[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:42.320]  the main reason we went into iraq at the time was we thought he had weapons of mass destruction
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:46.480]  it turns out he didn't but he had the capacity to make weapons of mass but i also talked about
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:52.880]  the human suffering in iraq hello boys and girls i have a special message for you from the president

[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:10.960]  that iraq has weapons of mass destruction well the first things they told me was
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:16.320]  you're not even to acknowledge the drone program you're not even to discuss that it exists
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:23.680]  renewed hostile actions against united states ships on the high seas in the Gulf of Tonkin

[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:42.720]  and reply that reply is crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:48.720]  radio network we've only aired that a few times jacquard jackson made that a few months ago
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:52.720]  what a talent jacquard is not just on air but his research of stories and
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:58.800]  his video editing and that's he's a real artist man that's just so good to have jacquard here
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:04.480]  and leon and joe bigs and darin mcgreen and john bound and all the writers but then the crew that

[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:16.080]  got to have some roundtable show in the new studio sometime where we get everybody mic'd up in there

[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:38.880]  ice cream social a little bit more serious here um i've been talking about hypocrisy a lot
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:43.440]  but obama's carbon tax post he's gonna do that without congressional approval
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:52.000]  just like he's launching the war without congressional approval but what i want to
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.960]  do now is finish up with phone calls and then we'll go back to calls but i want to go to jeff
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:04.560]  and others that have been patiently holding the first thing i want to hit is a story on
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:12.400]  the right hand side of drudge report dot com about halfway down and at the top of info wars dot
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:19.920]  com because that's where it came from it's the new top story by mckel failen a school has openly
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:25.520]  come out of public school announced that they were ordered to spy uh on all of their students
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:31.520]  basically and that's their excuse for spying on their students internet activity uh because the
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:40.560]  nsa contacted them school secretly monitors students facebook pages after receiving call from nsa
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:47.280]  people are very good about if you see something say something close quote school officials in
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:52.080]  huntsville alabama say phone call from the national security agency led them to create a secret
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:58.480]  surveillance program to monitor their students social media accounts hordes superintendant
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:06.560]  and former u.s army colonel kc wardensky the program began 18 months ago after the nsa alerted
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:12.160]  al langford this is all part of a recruiting program folks they use anything to recruit dentists
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:19.120]  doctors lawyers power plant managers and it always sounds reasonable when they first recruit them
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:24.800]  and then later it's uh we need you to you know go set somebody up the school security officer to a
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:30.560]  violent threat made by a student on facebook wardensky says school officials immediately
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:35.280]  searched the student's vehicle and found very good sized knife leading to the student's expulsion
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:43.520]  so because of the nsa telling him about that now everyone had to be spied on see we found a knife
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:50.880]  now we're going to spy on you the nsa denied any involvement with the student whatsoever when
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:55.840]  contacted by al dot com the news group that obtained documents relating to the school's
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:03.200]  safe program sa fe or students against fear monitoring program
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:09.360]  then uh tell what's fearful is this program the national security agency has no record
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:13.840]  that it passed any information to the huntsville school district and the uh description of what
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:18.720]  supposedly occurred is inconsistent with the nsa's practices says nsa public affairs specialist
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:25.600]  vanae vines let me explain what's really going on there are eight hundred and eighty something
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:32.080]  thousand last time i checked that was in the washington post private contractors with nsa access
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:38.800]  now if i wanted to bring down a country security and i've had the former head of an nsa division
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:46.080]  number four argument number three at the nsa an nsa director on to concur with my analysis
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:53.120]  now i'm no genius but if i wanted to bring a country security down i would put 800 plus thousand
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:59.440]  people in with top secret and above top secret clearances to spy on everybody because then
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:05.520]  foreign corporations and governments pay them off blackmail them compromise them and you got full
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:11.920]  penetration see because these doors are two way and that's why our country is completely
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:20.240]  penetrated seven ways to sunday it's so absurd i don't even know what to say at this point
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:25.200]  they've built back doors and all the major computer chips all the major computers
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:30.880]  all the switches all the telecoms on record globally it's been standardized so now it's
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:36.480]  an orgy of governments and corporations just breaking in stealing swapping planting framing
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:43.920]  to clearly wreck the first internet that's the big organic one and to bring in their new
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:48.320]  certified one that's all biometrically access and that's the remitted plan
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:54.640]  i told you 15 years ago now it's a minute and i'm not saying i told you i told you i told you
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:16:00.640]  because i i'm up here on the ego trip folks you need to understand my narrative of what's going on
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:05.360]  is super accurate and if they shut me down or something you need to know this is precious
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:09.280]  information you can replicate it what i've reverse engineered
[02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:15.760]  our particular insight into how it works
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:24.240]  they tried to put william benny in jail two separate times claiming he violated national
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:29.840]  security for speaking out against the nsa he's going out there to defend your right to privacy
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:34.000]  and they are trying to put him in jail they've tried to put
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:39.680]  Wayne madson in jail he had guys breaking in and following him to leave the u.s for six months
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:46.400]  a few years ago i mean this is real and i'm not there whining about it i'm just saying it's real
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:52.880]  it's real it has nothing to do with keeping you safe the border is wide open the government ordered
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:57.280]  the border patrol since january to load the illegals on the buses
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:06.960]  is with no id and give them a computer voucher that greyhound will accept for a month to take
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:15.600]  them anywhere they want in the country but the nsa and police departments are grabbing the data
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:20.400]  of political people and tracking everything and and doing all this and they're framing congress
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:28.080]  and and and mi6 has been caught blackmailing parliament this is bureaucracies and 880 000
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:33.040]  private people and over a million government people with top secret and above top secret
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:38.320]  clearances just in a clearinghouse of corruption and infiltration and takedown
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:46.080]  do you have any idea i'm sure you do
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:54.880]  do that previously to 9 11 they had all this nsa data and they didn't use it and they stood down
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:18:00.160]  that's come out so a it didn't keep you safe now they say more spinal keep you safe when
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:07.840]  they are the ones that gave 600 tons of weapons to ices just last year and now they're saying all
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:12.880]  over the news imminent attack get ready they're gonna hit us in the u.s they're gonna hit us just
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:17.360]  like it's it's like it's like watching paint dry it's so obvious
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:26.320]  it's a total narrative because they think the media thinks they've got such control
[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:28.160]  which they don't have
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:32.960]  people see what they're doing they're just there with their mouth hanging open
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:41.520]  and that they're going to be able to let ices or whatever new name they've given it
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:47.680]  derka derka mohammed jihad whatever you want to call it i mean you call that the new group

[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:49.440]  of us constitution lovers are going to become their new enemy next i want to talk about transhumanism
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:57.600]  and that's really at the top as you know is luciferianism all of us are here on earth
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:05.680]  essentially to learn how to have faith in god to have faith in jesus christ satan stands in
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:12.320]  complete opposition to that plan uh he does not have a body and so his goal is to destroy us
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:19.120]  his goal is to destroy our bodies the vehicle in which god has blessed us with to carry out
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:25.520]  that eternal plan of learning how to trust in him and progress and have full faith in his son
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:32.560]  jesus christ um transhumanism is the lie that lucifer has given the globalist that's how
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:39.280]  he offers eternal life or godhood back to the apple correct correct you're absolutely right
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:44.400]  alex i want well it's not hard i mean look at apple with the apple symbol with the bite out of
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:49.680]  it they're they're openly telling you what they're doing i mean i could play clips of top transhumanist
[02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:55.600]  saying we're going to become gods get out of our way or we'll kill you i mean this is their attitude
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:27:03.840]  that's right we think of god our our god as the ultimate engineer of our bodily machine
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:10.320]  and satan is trying to mimic that to deceive us all of us even the globalists who we need to pray for
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:17.040]  for a change of heart to deceive them to possess their bodies and ultimately get complete tyranny
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:22.000]  to destroy us well look at how all of the computer stuff they come out with has a
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:27.680]  another use than what they tell us and it's meant to dumb us down spy on us lower our awareness
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:35.280]  lower our psychological brainwaves everything the globalist deploy is destructive it always
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:40.400]  sounds great it's addictive it's wonderful until we get deeper into it i hear you good points
[02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:47.520]  let's talk to michael in california you're on the air hello yes sir uh i want to say amen to the
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:57.840]  fellow that just was on and uh my thoughts uh continue on um i am a roman catholic layman who
[02:27:57.840 --> 02:28:05.040]  is an exorcist and i found out that catholics who have the sacrament of confirmation which is
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:10.640]  the scent of the holy spirit upon the apostles that pentecost can do exorcisms but they don't
[02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:17.360]  know it the knowledge was hidden 1794 years ago the reason i know this is because the
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:25.760]  colleague of mine and i from 84 to 90 did research on the church and uh we found this out and we
[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:33.440]  worked with a priest who was a personal friend of john paul the second he met john paul in 1938
[02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:39.200]  in poland he was one of the priests that mentored him into the priesthood and protected him from
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:48.800]  the nazis father continued and then the protected him against the soviets and uh father was uh
[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:59.360]  caught by the soviets and kept in a gulag until 1947 when the state department on the influence
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:05.840]  of rom was told that where he was and that he was an american citizen and so they finally
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:14.000]  coughed him up in 1947 and he was brilliant and we we uh sort of brainstormed with him at the time he
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:24.640]  was 80 and but he was brilliant what was his name pardon me what was his name oh um father um oh my
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:31.680]  gosh i'm getting a metal block he died in 80 in 91 at the saran father you want to do a youtube video
[02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:34.720]  about that write an article about it it's very interesting and i'm interested to hear what he
[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:40.160]  had to say about exorcisms because um i tell you a lot of people it's like mental illness is like
[02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:44.400]  viral or something and it's like they're demon possessed mentally ill people i've dealt with

[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:42.080]  looking out over the hell country and the lights and i just thought how fantastic consciousness
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:46.640]  and being alive is you could say what you want about life after death you could say what you
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:51.840]  want about where we came from where we're going but man this is fantastic to be alive
[02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:58.480]  and i know that hollywood and air force one and red carpets is not the end all be all
[02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:05.840]  this life is a test you know i wanted to go to that caller about the exorcism story
[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:10.960]  and i said please hold over and i don't know what it is when i say hold over they never do
[02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:17.120]  it or rarely but i was talking to
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:25.680]  someone who follows the Carl Jung system of psychology swiss psychology which i think is
[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:31.120]  the most accurate out there of constructs to look into the human mind from a secular perspective
[02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:42.160]  and this is a well-known psychologist i'll just leave it at that that quietly underground
[02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:50.320]  does exorcisms even though they weren't religious until they began to investigate it all
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:57.760]  but then did it and even if people aren't christian in their background they only respond to the name
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:02.160]  jesus christ and i actually know someone quite well who was involved in
[02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:10.080]  close to a hundred exorcisms with this well-known psychologist slash phd
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:17.840]  and the stuff they saw doing this first time i know just couldn't even do it anymore it was too
[02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:26.000]  intense uh with with with people that thought they were possessed it's just amazing and those
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:31.200]  aren't areas i really get into here on air but you can call it mental illness whatever you want
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:36.160]  but where people just their face changes and their whole demeanor changes and it's a different person
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:39.840]  and it doesn't matter if what they're doing hurts them and hurts others
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:44.960]  and isn't even good for them to do they will do it because it's destructive and it's bad
[02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:52.880]  and i've talked to a one of the best known psychologists here in austin texas who i know
[02:37:52.880 --> 02:38:00.640]  is a listener but i ended up meeting him through a separate uh issue and they said after 40 years of
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:05.840]  doing what they do at the bottom of the rabbit hole they weren't religious and they become religious
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:09.440]  that's happened to so many genetic engineers and people when they really start looking at stuff
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:15.840]  they go this has been made this didn't this didn't just fall off a turnip truck this didn't
[02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:21.360]  just appear in the middle of the desert or in the ocean obviously ladies and gentlemen everything
[02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:26.400]  we're being told is not the full story and the entire illuminati system is about the public
[02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:33.440]  not learning these secrets and i know a lot more than i even get into on air because people just
[02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:41.760]  aren't ready for this information people aren't ready to know that there's a long declassified
[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:48.480]  history of adding sterilants and other horrible stuff to vaccines that or yuppies go there are too
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:52.960]  many people and i'm like but they're targeting your kids it's like taking your kids up to the
[02:38:52.960 --> 02:39:00.240]  temple and tire 2500 years ago and throwing them on a burning altar in front of molik i mean why
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:12.480]  well all the states said do it or 3 000 years ago and what's wales today in central england north
[02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:22.960]  of london and the welsh hills the the priest would come around the druidic priest and some years
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:29.120]  he might just want your cat or maybe your oxen for the summer solstice or winter solstice or
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:38.720]  whatever event it was sowing halloween sometimes they'd say i want you they take the man and put
[02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:43.360]  him in a wicker basket and burning so the crops would grow the next year
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:52.800]  sometimes they said i want your son or i want your daughter and right in front of everybody they'd
[02:39:56.160 --> 02:40:01.040]  let them get the little kid drunk a little six-year-old girl or boy i guess they were nice to them
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:04.720]  the Aztecs did that too they got them drunk and they'd lean them out there right over that peat
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:09.440]  bog and they take that dagger and they slit that throat and just let that little kid's blood pour
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:14.000]  right into that bog to that god or sometimes they just club their head in right there or
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:21.920]  sometimes they take little kids bound and throw them into a big pit of coals to just swell up
[02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:27.680]  and pop and burst and i know you don't want to hear that but every culture did that and it's the state
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:38.080]  the religious state demanding that children be killed to to the god i mean look at the bible
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:47.920]  abraham god says take your only son i guess he had another brother as well but you take that one
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:53.120]  your heir the one you really wanted the one you have with your wife not with your concubine
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:41:02.560]  take him up there and stab him in the heart but then we talk about him kidnapping kids they
[02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:06.160]  oh no nobody's involved in that there's like tens of thousands of missing kids
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:13.840]  they can't find them with the nsa and i'll tell you why they can't find them because the nsa is
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:18.720]  not allowed to look into that they're only allowed to watch what the tea party's doing and oh look
[02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:30.560]  danessa susan you know he's in a divorce two years ago and then magically the word comes down that
[02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:35.120]  he got some friends to donate money and he gave money to her so let's put him in jail
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:42.320]  see i think well it's the law and they said mr susan i was reading the court ruling yesterday
[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:49.760]  the transcript while it read lights and traffic i literally pulled it up was reading it at red
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:55.840]  lights and the judge all appointed by clinton the prosecutor appointed by obama
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:06.880]  said to the susan how dare you do an interview and they played the transcript
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:11.520]  it was only a transcript i couldn't see the tv in the courtroom they played him on fox news and
[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:16.960]  they played him on this radio show shang was politically sparking he said because of your
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:24.640]  speech i'm gonna put you in a reeducation center therapeutic therapy for mental illness
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:32.480]  for 10 months or is it eight months you have to pull up the transcript i think it's
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:39.280]  eight or ten months you have to look it up the memory fails for a moment but the point is is
[02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:47.680]  that he has to go to daily brainwashing about how he's mentally ill with at a actual shrink medical
[02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:55.200]  center therapeutic for his thought crime and the judge sat there and said how dare you say this
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:43:04.240]  was selective or political we don't do that five years probation they pulled it up here
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:08.480]  yeah but it's how many how many months to a quote community center it's like a giant open-air prison
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:11.120]  it'll say how many uh
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:22.000]  yeah it's eight okay they had sought 16 months prison sentence but it said it's eight months in
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:27.440]  basically a locked up halfway house hellhole i'd rather be in prison than one of those halfway
[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:30.880]  houses where the criminals go in and out and then there's like weird criminals that run them
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:35.040]  feeding on people and praying on them i mean what a nightmare and all these nobodies that
[02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:40.400]  couldn't get jobs that mess with you all day and all these probation people i mean what a hellhole
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:46.880]  but but what's amazing is if you read the judge's ruling and statements it's online
[02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:51.280]  you can read the indictment everything else when i got home i read that again
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:58.640]  this is just fascinating tyranny because you spoke out i'm going to go ahead and give you a
[02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:02.400]  sentence of eight months and i'm going to go ahead and give you five years probation and
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:07.840]  thirty thousand dollar fine i wouldn't have if you wouldn't have said this was political i mean
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:13.840]  they're politically saying you talked about us so we're going to punish you but this isn't political
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:22.160]  like taking a bottle of vodka and going this is an alcohol and guzzling 15 shots of it
[02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:30.640]  the judge indicts himself in the statement of just hubris and just arrogance
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:37.200]  and they'll be like well the nation says they gave i kept saying 30 it was 20
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:42.640]  thousand dollars 10 thousand was legal through donors that's all clinton and obama and all of
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:46.880]  them do is go out and get straw donors it's on record they say it's legal and they do it not
[02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:52.720]  when somebody else does it but let me tell you when you've punished those that funded al-qaeda
[02:44:54.480 --> 02:44:59.600]  when you've punished all those that put flora in the water when you punish those that gave live
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:04.480]  polio vaccine to millions when you've punished those that put our troops on death list secret
[02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:08.960]  death list not given treatment at the va nation wine when you punish the people kidnap and little
[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:14.400]  kids when you've punished all the illegals pouring across burning down houses and killing people
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:18.560]  then once you've gotten to all them if you want to get to dinesh to susan then i would say it
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:23.200]  wasn't political of course it's political when rick perry who i don't even like
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:30.240]  is forced because of incredible public pressure to go after the travis county da who's on video
[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:35.520]  spitting on police flopping around kicking like she's possessed looks like linda blare
[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:43.440]  she runs a state agency seven million dollars for the county public integrity fund he says step
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:47.840]  down or i'll cut the money tries to get the democrats quietly to appoint a new person who's
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:54.800]  democrat and they indict him and then say it's not political it's just flaunting this stuff in
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:46:05.040]  people's faces flaunting it arrogantly mentally ill i got a bunch of reports i've got to get to
[02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:15.760]  and boy there are a lot of them i want to go to this uh john mown report that'll go into the
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:20.960]  break i'll come back and finish it obama wants amnesty for murderers and rapists just to talk about
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:27.120]  what's really going on how above the law i'll launch wars if i want above the law the borders
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:31.920]  above the law shut down your power plants i'm above the law i'm above the law i'm above the law
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:35.920]  and the people that are above the law that have the irs persecuting people and have been caught
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:44.640]  lying about it now they're going to go out and put denisha susan in prison at a reeducation camp
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:51.520]  therapeutic therapy psychological therapeutic therapy here it is here's the report new york
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:57.360]  los angeles and chicago have formed a big city coalition to grease the skids for illegal immigration
[02:46:57.360 --> 02:47:03.280]  in the united states this coalition will push our tax dollars along with big corporate donations
[02:47:03.280 --> 02:47:09.040]  towards a greater voting procedure educational assistance and micro loans for illegal immigrants
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:14.080]  they are going full steam ahead with a cloud pivot induced privileged society that is already
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:20.160]  destroying the american middle class the nsa tracks the movements phone calls and emails
[02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:26.000]  of every u.s citizen but we can't know where these illegals are as they continue to miss their
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:31.840]  immigration hearings by 90 percent so where are they apparently a growing number of them have been
[02:47:31.840 --> 02:47:37.280]  flooding the southeast of the united states and they are raping the children of these communities
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:43.040]  at an alarming rate spokeswoman for the david's agonist sheriff's office said you said it was in
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:48.480]  this country illegally gurau aguilar faces three counts of aggravated sexual battery of a person

[02:47:54.400 --> 02:48:00.000]  believe 19-year-old sergio perez an illegal immigrant attacked the woman in her home sunday
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:07.840]  418 children were raped by illegals in the state of north carolina in the month of august 2014 alone
[02:48:07.840 --> 02:48:12.880]  i spoke with james johnson the founder and president of north carolinians for immigration
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:18.960]  reform enforcement about the history of his organization and methods needed to document this
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:25.200]  full-blown attack on america's youth in c five started out set 2007 and it came about as a result
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:30.320]  of me getting injured on the job as i was going through physical therapy and rehab under work
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:38.160]  with comp started seeing uh a lot of individuals who could not speak english that had interpreters
[02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:45.280]  with them in the rehab process in the therapy sessions and so i started inquiring about you
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:51.840]  know what's going on and then you know the other things you'd see uh non-american citizen obvious
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:56.800]  people at the grocery stores you know paying for two or three shopping carts full of groceries with
[02:48:56.800 --> 02:49:02.800]  the uh uh uh food stamp card and then buying you know the last carts full of alcohol to pay for
[02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:08.320]  that will watch the cash and then i started noticing you know crime in this newspaper report
[02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:14.160]  crime on this television report here you know about hispanic hyphenated surname individuals
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:20.960]  creating crimes or and in north carolina it's just not has not been a bastion of uh hyphenated
[02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:27.120]  surname doggy flag red flag started coming together and it just led me to the point where
[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:31.760]  you know what's going on here and i started looking into it and the more you look into it
[02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:39.040]  the more you find the effort is to hide it um there's no there's the crimes by illegal
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:45.280]  aliens are not compiled by any government agency anywhere in the united states as far as the public
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:52.640]  being able to access it so i just decided that you know what i'll start cataloging it in north
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:56.800]  carolina and we first started out just listing all the crimes that we could find and here's
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:03.360]  how we do it we just started scouring them the web um any kind of news reports police reports
[02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:08.240]  in north carolina there are 100 counties so the first thing i did was go to all of the
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:15.600]  county sheriff's departments arrest records and they're all online um and then we started going
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:23.520]  through all of the uh like tv station websites newspaper websites radio station websites they'll
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:30.160]  have a crime section there on every one of those and obviously uh in every county there are cities
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:36.080]  and towns and municipalities that have their own police agencies and so all of this stuff is online
[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:41.280]  and it takes we're gonna come back with the rest of this important report and and the reasons

[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:22.560]  world state nafta and gat was about collapsing us it's done a pretty good job this is about the
[02:55:22.560 --> 02:55:26.880]  north american union let's finish up with john bounds report where he interviews one of the
[02:55:26.880 --> 02:55:32.640]  people that started the organization with the examiner to expose all the news reports
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:38.320]  in just north carolina that a large portion of not the majority of the rapes and murders
[02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:45.120]  now are illegals and it's just a happy hunting ground uh of illegals rob and then they rob
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:50.640]  hispanics blacks whites they don't care it is just people with no names who can do whatever they want
[02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:58.400]  here it is and so all of this stuff is online and it takes a here to her a herpulean effort to try
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:04.720]  to compile this stuff the numbers you're seeing now are not nearly all of it because it's physically
[02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:11.520]  impossible for us as an organization with the limited people and resources we have to to uh
[02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:18.720]  actually you know check all of those resources and so we go through every day of every county of
[02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:29.360]  every name from a to z and pick out the ones that we suspect of being an illegal and because of the
[02:56:29.360 --> 02:56:35.120]  charge in decent liberties with a child is more prevalent to an illegal or someone from central
[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:42.480]  america or uh you know hispanic or spanish background nation now that's not to say that americans don't
[02:56:42.480 --> 02:56:48.800]  do it too however um that's right it's socially acceptable once we get the downwork date it has
[02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:55.040]  the arrest record number the court docket number and the we take that number and go to the specific
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:57:03.360]  county where the person was arrested and get that agency's police report and on there it'll say
[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:10.720]  needs an interpreter first for uh for court well that's a dead giveaway to first of all
[02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:16.640]  person doesn't speak english well then obviously they 99 percent chance 99.9 percent chance
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:22.080]  that uh they're illegal they're illegally in the country now down at the bottom of all of our reports
[02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:29.120]  underneath the uh all the court dockets we have listed the uh the articles the news articles that
[02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:34.240]  we find with the links to them and and many of those they will actually say this person is an
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:40.880]  illegal immigrant or being held on ice charges oh it's killing us literally and figuratively uh in
[02:57:40.880 --> 02:57:47.760]  the pocketbook and you know i mean literally we have people are dying from dwi hitting runs guys
[02:57:47.760 --> 02:57:53.600]  the full report there's a few minutes left to this uh we're going to post it to youtube it's from the

[03:00:36.480 --> 03:00:45.040]  on the air go ahead hey alex how's it going good brother uh i want to get into how obama is actually
[03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:51.760]  a terrorist under his own law but real quick i have to get to song 37 uh starting at 12
[03:00:53.040 --> 03:00:57.440]  the wicked plot against the righteous and nash their teeth at them but the lord
[03:00:57.440 --> 03:01:03.280]  laughs at the wicked for he knows their day is coming the wicked draw the sword bend the bow
[03:01:03.920 --> 03:01:09.360]  to bring down the poor in the needy and slay those whose ways are upright but their swords will
[03:01:09.360 --> 03:01:15.200]  pierce their own hearts and their bows will be broken better the little that the righteous have
[03:01:15.840 --> 03:01:22.320]  than the wealth of many wicked yeah i've read that verse it's powerful it's true too
[03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:31.680]  yeah so anyways under the national defense authorization act our counterterrorism section
[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:41.120]  1021 subparagraph b it talks about covered persons or quote-unquote terrorist and it says
[03:01:41.120 --> 03:01:47.200]  any covered a covered person under this section is any person that follows number two a person who
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:54.640]  was a part of or substantially supported al-qaeda the taliban or associated forces that are engaged
[03:01:55.200 --> 03:02:00.480]  in hostilities against the united states or coalition partners including any person
[03:02:00.480 --> 03:02:05.680]  who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities
[03:02:05.680 --> 03:02:12.000]  and aid of such enemy forces yeah that's been pointed out that arming al-qaeda the last four
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:17.280]  years especially Benghazi two years ago is an act of terrorism and that's why they're so scared of
[03:02:17.280 --> 03:02:21.840]  this this coming out they're always arresting like mentally ill people that they trick into
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:26.800]  saying they're going to bomb something but then our own government's arming them and it's not being
[03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:33.040]  discussed i forget that subsection again a plug where you find that uh and the subsection again
[03:02:34.160 --> 03:02:43.280]  uh if you just type in ndaa covered person uh section 1021 subparagraph b that's right yeah
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:51.120]  but it gets deeper than that though because obama is actually extorting all taxpayers money
[03:02:51.120 --> 03:02:57.440]  like all taxpayers yeah now he's making us aid nabed them publicly and then doing a fake bombing
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:03.360]  uh of one of these subgroups as we predicted this chorus in situation excellent point brother
[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:08.640]  i'm going to try to do a special report on that in the next few days headline a proof obama is a
[03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:14.480]  terrorist by his own definition let's jam in one more call sorry to the others let's talk to greg
[03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:24.400]  and connecticut on global warming go ahead hi um i got a couple i got um i just want to

[03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:35.600]  you for um opening my eyes up to all this thank you brother because you know i was a huge obama
[03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:42.880]  supporter and everything but you exposed the truth and everything and um i was going to talk about
[03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:50.240]  global warming and everything last winter here was absolutely horrible like it was um
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:57.520]  10 below and all that and i was just thinking to myself like how does that happen you know
[03:03:57.520 --> 03:04:01.920]  well we didn't pay al-gore enough money so i got cold i've got to jump i want to talk to john
[03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:06.000]  real fast you say after next fall's flag operation valkyrie what does that mean
[03:04:06.880 --> 03:04:12.160]  well uh alex as you know the us military has plans to attack every single nation on earth
[03:04:12.160 --> 03:04:17.600]  in the 1920s they had plans to attack great britain and they also have their own version
[03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:23.120]  of operation valkyrie that's the operation that was put into effect after they tried to
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:29.520]  assassinate hitler and anyway the next false flag that's coming up any loyal military officers
[03:04:29.520 --> 03:04:35.600]  that are involved in the planning and implementation of operation valkyrie must put it into motion
[03:04:35.600 --> 03:04:42.560]  once the false flag hits and arrest obama arrest biden and all the leadership of the house and
[03:04:42.560 --> 03:04:48.080]  senate and we that's the only way we're going to get these criminals off our back we can't
[03:04:48.080 --> 03:04:54.560]  solve this peacefully through politics anymore that's over that option is gone we have to have
[03:04:54.560 --> 03:04:58.640]  the military move on these criminals because well for those that don't know that's what they
[03:04:58.640 --> 03:05:06.400]  try to get settler but
