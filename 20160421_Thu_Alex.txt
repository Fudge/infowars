[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:12.000 --> 00:18.000]  Dr. Steve Pachennick, former member of the Council on Farm Relations, one of the founders of Delta Forest, General Boykin.
[00:20.000 --> 00:27.000]  The guy that Jack Ryan character is based off of in the Patriot Games series of books and films.
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  Has been in the meetings where the globalists openly discussed how they staged on 11.
[00:35.000 --> 00:46.000]  So when he talks about it being an inside job on my show 14 years ago, a year after it happened, when he talks about it now, you have to understand he gets Justice Department visits, MI6 visits,
[00:46.000 --> 00:54.000]  massage visits, CIA visits, and threats. And he says, fine, I'll just release everything I know. Go ahead and try to kill me.
[00:54.000 --> 01:04.000]  And it's talk about pearls before swine, not you the audience, but the mainstream media. This is a high level guy who's come on the show and just started naming names before.
[01:04.000 --> 01:15.000]  We're going to talk 9-11 with Pachennick today. And quite frankly, for my safety and his safety, I want him to just get everything he knows out here on the table.
[01:17.000 --> 01:25.000]  Basically everything I know has been put out there. And it's not that I'm even really afraid of being killed, but I don't want to get killed for no reason.
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  I mean, I just want to, you know, that's why I don't let people give me information unless it's going to be on air.
[01:30.000 --> 01:39.000]  I had the DC Madame one time on the phone, right in front of John Harmon, trying to give me names. I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  I said, they're going to kill you, lady. Do not tell me that unless you go on air with it.
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  Then I went on air and said, you were just starting to tell me stuff. Get it all on air now.
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  And she didn't do it. A couple weeks later, they killed her dad in the hammer.
[01:54.000 --> 02:01.000]  So this is the real world we live in. This isn't games. It isn't playtime.
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  That's why Info Wars basically wags the dog, not the other way around.
[02:06.000 --> 02:21.000]  I'm not bragging. It's actually very dangerous. It's very scary to so many times be the progenitors of the breaking intel that ends up changing history.
[02:21.000 --> 02:32.000]  I mean, just three weeks ago, it was only Matt Drudge and I simultaneously that were pointing out that they were stealing the popular vote and canceling elections.
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  All the rest of the media was acting like it was completely normal and not even saying in the news what was happening.
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  People think, well, aren't you proud of the fact that, you know, you keep being cutting edge? No, it's dangerous.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  And it means we're not getting the word out enough.
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  Now, I've got a TV video coming up after the break. I wasn't going to air it now, but it's so important.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  I'm going to air it coming up because it needs to be promoted and hyped a little bit.
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.000]  It hasn't gone on info wars.com yet. It's being uploaded to YouTube as we speak.
[03:01.000 --> 03:09.000]  Darren McBrain, who can put together incredible video intros in a few hours, has spent off and on a few weeks on this because he thought it was so important.
[03:09.000 --> 03:19.000]  And I agree with him. So we've taken the parable of the snake that Donald Trump has been reciting on the road and we've added some powerful video to it.
[03:19.000 --> 03:25.000]  I've seen other people add some video. This is really powerful, not pooping those that took action.
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  We're just taking it and making it even more powerful.
[03:27.000 --> 03:34.000]  And so we want this to go viral and I'm going to premiere it here coming up in the next segment.
[03:34.000 --> 03:44.000]  But here's the opportunity we have. Info wars understands the battle space, understands the globalist operation from reading their own white papers.
[03:44.000 --> 03:51.000]  We don't sit here and analyze their false paradigm, their false historical narrative that they project at the public.
[03:51.000 --> 04:01.000]  I mean, we'll show how it's twisted and how they're deceiving and things, but we actually go to the direct New World Order operation manual, which is public.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  Their operations are public at the academic level.
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  And then we basically don't even connect the dots because there's no dot to connect. It's just there. It's on its face.
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  A fascistic anti human eugenics based world government.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  But we've got to get this paradigm understanding this blueprint.
[04:21.000 --> 04:30.000]  The Death Star plans basically duplicated where everybody else understands the paradigm so they can't shut down the signal.
[04:30.000 --> 04:39.000]  Because currently the New World Order can tell a couple hundred people and there would not even be a brain trust out there to understand what we're fighting.
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  My job and your job is to boil this down. It's very complex.
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  It's simply as we can, though, so that it can be gotten out to everyone.
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  So then there's no way to stop the signal once you understand the blueprint.
[04:51.000 --> 04:58.000]  Understanding the blueprint of the architecture of this thing shows you what it does and how evil it is and brings it down.
[04:58.000 --> 05:02.000]  Once again, the social justice warriors are back at it again.
[05:02.000 --> 05:09.000]  Andrew Jackson, who fought Central Bank, removed from $20 bill, but they'll leave Hamilton on the $10 bill.
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  And he was pro-Central Bank as public concern for liberty erased.
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  Article up by Max Slavo.
[05:16.000 --> 05:22.000]  The latest battle is for the face of the currency itself and the Central Bankers, who control the front anyway,
[05:22.000 --> 05:29.000]  have imposed a symbolic defeat against the leaders in America's past who have fought against the stranglehold of the money makers.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  Naturally, there are liberal politics at play fighting for every inch of ground in the war,
[05:33.000 --> 05:41.000]  cardiological re-engineering, history is being whitewashed, various figures of antiquity rolling in their graves.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  We keep seeing this time and time again.
[05:43.000 --> 05:50.000]  We were just at the Portland State University and surprisingly there was still a statue of Abraham Lincoln.
[05:50.000 --> 05:55.000]  I'm sure it's only going to be a matter of time before that racist statue is removed as well.
[05:55.000 --> 06:24.000]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.
[06:25.000 --> 06:32.000]  We drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[06:36.000 --> 06:39.000]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[06:39.000 --> 06:43.000]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield, nascent iodine,
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[06:51.000 --> 06:58.000]  It is exclusive to infowarslife.com and the infowarslife family of incredible products.
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[07:07.000 --> 07:10.000]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[07:50.000 --> 07:55.000]  It's 1159 on Radio Free America and this is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  The chair is against the wall. The chair is against the wall.
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  The chair is against the wall.
[08:06.000 --> 08:10.000]  The chair is against the wall.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  The chair is against the wall.
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  The chair is against the wall.
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.000]  The chair is against the wall.
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  Care is against the wall. John has a long mustache.
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  John has a long mustache.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  It's 12 o'clock American, another day closer to victory.
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  But they took a lot of people away.
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  People that had guns and things they wanted, they just took them away.
[08:45.000 --> 08:46.000]  Where?
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  And we need the type of camps that you all run.
[09:06.000 --> 09:07.000]  I mean, really.
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  Now they were taken to race tracks and fairgrounds
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.000]  where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  I'm a soft citizen.
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitution lists, a lot of people that start by with us.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.000]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  and they're disloyal to the United States.
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  This whole thing is doing here and let's not kid about it.
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.000]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  Put your gun down, really?
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.000]  It's Thursday, the 21st day of April, 2016.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  Thank you so much for joining us for this worldwide broadcast.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  We have a lot of very important guests joining us.
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  Larry Nichols, the consulate Clinton insider with more of his intel
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  is going to be popping in for about $29,000.
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  We have a lot of very important guests joining us.
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.000]  Larry Nichols, the consulate Clinton insider with more of his intel
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  is going to be popping in for about 20 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  Roger Stone, again, has major bombshells.
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  He's been in New York.
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.000]  Inside, obviously, the inner sanctum with his former business partner, current business partner,
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.000]  who is now heading up the Trump campaign.
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  We're going to have a lot of inside baseball for you on what's happening currently there.
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  Dr. Steve Pochenick is going to be coming on to talk about the 9-11 dam breaking on the truth,
[11:25.000 --> 11:31.000]  the criminal elements of our government working with Saudi Arabia, Turkey and others.
[11:32.000 --> 11:40.000]  Other nations were involved in the September 11th attacks as a pretext to frame Saddam Hussein in Iraq
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.000]  and as a pretext to take the American people's liberties
[11:45.000 --> 11:52.000]  and, of course, the liberties of populations all over the world using the sword of Islam.
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  And yes, there have been non-radical forms of Islam before.
[11:56.000 --> 12:03.000]  Islam has had a golden age for about 200 years where most historians admit that it was a source of science and light
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  during some of the dark ages in Europe.
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  But you can say that dominant Islam today is radical Islam.
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  It's been financed by the robber barons to take over.
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  So you can't debate now that whatever it was before,
[12:16.000 --> 12:23.000]  Sunni Islam, that is the dominant Islam and that is carried out by the Islamist,
[12:23.000 --> 12:29.000]  is spreading across the world and killing every non-Sunni Muslim they get their hands on,
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  killing the Sunni Muslims that they see as backsliders,
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  very oppressive in killing Shiites, Christians, Jews, you name it.
[12:38.000 --> 12:47.000]  And it's just a fact that Shiites compared to Wahhabists is like a Quaker.
[12:47.000 --> 12:53.000]  Who was that that was on? I think it was Dr. Corsi made that statement last week when he was on.
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.000]  And I'm not saying there aren't some serious issues with some of the Shiite leadership.
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.000]  It's just they don't kill Jews. It's because they're Jews or Christians and will let you live in peace.
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.000]  The form of Islam we have coming out of Syria right now,
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  the failed invasion force of Saudi Arabia and Turkey is being directed into Europe
[13:15.000 --> 13:21.000]  as a Tet offensive, sneak attack, sleeper cell, time bomb.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  And we're going to cover that right now.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  But Steve Pachett is going to be joining us to talk all things 9-11,
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  now that 9-11 dam is breaking.
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  They misrepresent and say that 9-11 truth is saying that space beams did it or Easter bunnies did it
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  or Santa Claus with his, you know, Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer shot laser beams into it.
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  And they've got groups and organizations and a real underground vicious PR campaign
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.000]  to try to bully everyone into going with all these, you know, sci-fi scenarios,
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.000]  whether they're real or not, and most of it's pure bulb,
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.000]  to discredit the entire 9-11 treatment that's just saying, hey, there was a norad stand down.
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.000]  The bin Laden's were allowed to escape and evacuate out of the country.
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  Saudi Arabia got caught financing and it was used to take our freedoms.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  Now our government's funding ISIS and Al Qaeda caught with their pants down.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  The Pentagon saying no to it.
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  America is waking up really at the top.
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.000]  9-11 truth really reached the top brass and a lot of people inside intelligence agencies
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  who don't like what happened.
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  I mean, how many former high-level CIA agents, I mean, folks that were field commanders
[14:31.000 --> 14:39.000]  and then head analyst for Ronald Reagan, you name it, have come on this show
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  and laid out how it's an inside job.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  And so what you see now is that dam is collapsing and the cover-up is collapsing
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  and it's a big, big deal.
[14:50.000 --> 14:59.000]  And the guy that helped push it over the edge was Donald J. Trump.
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  Now the Republicans are claiming that they're warming to him
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  and that's sophisticated psychological warfare.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  They're finally not as arrogant as they were.
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.000]  That is meant to make him look more establishment and hopefully slow him ahead of these final states.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  Guaranteed that this is a sneak attack playing possum, a foil.
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.000]  Guaranteed by Ren's previous and the rest of these jolly old pirates
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  and that they're still going to try to steal it at the convention.
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.000]  This is 110% total possum behavior.
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  And people will say, oh really, well it'll just give Trump more credibility if they say
[15:37.000 --> 15:45.000]  he's the prima facie winner and then that will drop out opposition and make it all go to him.
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  Watch, they're going to balance that delicately and then have a group of scandals
[15:49.000 --> 15:55.000]  right before the convention so they'll be conscious of the Republican Party
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  and the delegates to go against Trump.
[15:58.000 --> 16:04.000]  Now that analysis doesn't come from Roger Stone or Donald Trump or any of his crew.
[16:04.000 --> 16:14.000]  It comes from Alex Jones and I'm telling you that that is their plan right now.
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  Looking at all the angles. Doesn't mean it's their only plan but that's their plan.
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.000]  Now some of it is a Hitler and the bunker scenario where all their brainwashing, all their propaganda,
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  all the King's horses, all the King's men at CNN, Fox News, MSNBC.
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.000]  They couldn't convince the public that you never voted.
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  There was never voting in primaries. Votes never counted, silly.
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  Silly kids.
[16:38.000 --> 16:43.000]  So now Hitler's in his bunker kind of commanding armies that don't exist.
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.000]  And so they're imagining that they'll now act like, okay, we're warming to Trump
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.000]  only to try to see if they can get him to compromise and sell out to him on one front,
[16:53.000 --> 17:01.000]  make him think he's winning, destroy his outsider underdog aura
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.000]  and get him to stop spending money which he's starting to do
[17:05.000 --> 17:11.000]  and getting the infrastructure and brains and the muscle in place to fight them in Cleveland.
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.000]  It's like saving Private Ryan where one of the soldiers, the American soldiers,
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.000]  is rolling around in a fight with a German soldier and the American soldier starts getting
[17:20.000 --> 17:29.000]  the leverage with the dagger, with the field short sword, the bayonet,
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.000]  and the German says, no, no, let's be friends. No, no, no, stop, stop, stop.
[17:33.000 --> 17:40.000]  And that's actually a tactic that's used at the smallest level of military action up to the highest,
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.000]  obviously, is to act like you're surrendering for a moment to get someone to give up on their initiative
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  and then he's able to turn the knife and drive it in.
[17:48.000 --> 17:56.000]  Know that treachery is so complete with these people and so absolute that they're extremely transparent.
[17:56.000 --> 18:03.000]  They're so dark, so hidden, so twisted, so Machiavelli that once you study Machiavelli systems
[18:03.000 --> 18:11.000]  that they've expanded on and you look at the tells and all the other things they do
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.000]  and the type of think tanks that they get their marching orders from.
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.000]  I mean, Cruz has paid over a million dollars to a firm in England that specializes,
[18:19.000 --> 18:27.000]  they admit in brainwashing deception, I mean, the terms they use, manipulating the public, confusing people.
[18:27.000 --> 18:35.000]  But the biggest con is on Ted Cruz and his crew themselves because anyone could just come up with ball face lies
[18:35.000 --> 18:41.000]  and say, everyone's voting, the people who voted, I'm winning landslides, these aren't voterless.
[18:41.000 --> 18:48.000]  You could only do that 20, 30 years ago when there was no alternative media and there was a vacuum.
[18:48.000 --> 18:57.000]  But this is like raping a woman at the Super Bowl halftime show on the Jumbo Tron out in the middle of the field
[18:57.000 --> 19:01.000]  and then saying you didn't do it in front of everyone.
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  Now, there is some cognitive dissonance there where people are watching this going,
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  am I lying, I seeing that?
[19:07.000 --> 19:15.000]  And so sometimes the bold move actually works, but the problem is that there are people there
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.000]  like infowars.com and drudgereport.com and others that day one said, look, they're stealing it,
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  they're planning it, here's how they're doing it, and here's how they're propagandizing you
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  and using psych warfare, basically high tech con game.
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  And folks go, really, I'm not alone.
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  Yeah, we should have voting in America.
[19:30.000 --> 19:31.000]  They always said we did have it.
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  So I'm not a conspiracy theorist that there's voting.
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.000]  No, you're not.
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.000]  The sun came up this morning.
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  You're normal, they're lying to you.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  So there's that understanding of solidarity.
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  You mean the sky's blue in the middle of the day?
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.000]  Yes, it is.
[19:45.000 --> 19:46.000]  You're right.
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  You mean, really, it's not right to have them saying my kids belong to the government?
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  No, no, no, that's not good.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  See, so we're now realizing that we're normal.
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  That's what's happening.
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  So the facade is imploding.
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  Key video coming up, Donald Trump video.
[19:59.000 --> 20:01.000]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan.
[20:01.000 --> 20:07.000]  My father, President Ronald Reagan, believes so strongly in gold they change gold ownership forever
[20:07.000 --> 20:13.000]  by bringing back physical gold to the American public, allowing gold coins to be minted and sold
[20:13.000 --> 20:17.000]  to U.S. citizens just like you, starting in 1985.
[20:17.000 --> 20:24.000]  Gold ownership can help protect your financial future, especially when our national debt is spiraling out of control.
[20:24.000 --> 20:30.000]  Many smart Americans have kept their retirements from being wiped out during America's financial crisis
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  thanks to physical gold coins.
[20:32.000 --> 20:39.000]  I strongly urge you to call the U.S. Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD,
[20:39.000 --> 20:46.000]  or go online to usmoneyreserve.com as for a special gold guide with new never-before-released information

[21:58.000 --> 22:03.000]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  It's true. Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[23:52.000 --> 24:21.000]  DefenderShield.com, the worldwide leader in mobile radiation shielding.
[24:21.000 --> 24:31.000]  I disagree with that statement, but it's a subtle disagreement that is key to everything.
[24:31.000 --> 24:41.000]  And it's one of those stories that if you understand this story, you understand everything in that entire realm of psychological warfare.
[24:41.000 --> 24:50.000]  So I'm going to speak about this right now. Come back and air this exclusive Donald Trump warning to America.
[24:50.000 --> 24:59.000]  That's right, that Darren McBrain put together, because it's going to be going up in the next 5, 10 minutes on infowars.com.
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  And I want to premiere it here and then give everybody a chance to go grab the video piece for themselves and send it out to everyone they know,
[25:06.000 --> 25:14.000]  posted on the enemy platform, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and all other globalist conduits while we still can.
[25:14.000 --> 25:25.000]  Then I want to get into incredible political correctness and what it's really designed to do. I mean, we've gone from like one insane political correct article a week to hundreds a day where I can't even cover them all.
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  I mean, and it's getting bad. They're showing their power. This is a takeover.
[25:29.000 --> 25:38.000]  Now, let's get into the situation with Harriet Tubman.
[25:38.000 --> 25:45.000]  And let's talk about what Donald Trump has come out and said. On the surface, what Donald Trump is saying is right.
[25:45.000 --> 25:53.000]  And he has courage to say it. Here's NBC New York. Donald Trump says Harriet Tubman on $20 is pure political correctness.
[25:53.000 --> 25:59.000]  Speaking on NBC's Today Show, Trump said Tubman's likeness should go on a different denomination.
[25:59.000 --> 26:14.000]  Now, there are hundreds of layers to this, but number one, they're phasing out and getting rid of cash. Just like I told you, they're going to put women in the frontline military to destroy it and the capability because they're bringing in the machines.
[26:14.000 --> 26:24.000]  That's admitted. So you have the debate about women deserve to fight and women deserve to die and women can, you know, are just as tough as, you know, Tim Kennedy or Chris Kyle or Jesse Ventura.
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.000]  Give me a break. Can I have a baby? No, we're different.
[26:29.000 --> 26:37.000]  We're equal in God's eyes with our potential because we all balance out with different gifts, but we aren't all having the same gift.
[26:37.000 --> 26:49.000]  I mean, it's ridiculous. I don't have the same gift as the potential of, say, a, oh, here's an example, one I use quite often, a Kenyan long distance runner.
[26:49.000 --> 26:57.000]  Almost all the top runners in the world are Kenyan long distance runners because it's genetic.
[26:57.000 --> 27:06.000]  That's just the way it is. Africans can't even compete with them. So, so, so you get into this position. It's just ridiculous.
[27:06.000 --> 27:11.000]  So he's right to say generally they're doing this about political correctness, but it's tokenism.
[27:11.000 --> 27:19.000]  The globalist Cecil Rhodes British Empire World Government plan that he wrote books on in 1900. Read them.
[27:19.000 --> 27:37.000]  It's pushing political correctness to remove Queen Elizabeth statues and others from Oxford and other schools to act like it's not part of the empire when it's the empire pushing the end of free speech.
[27:37.000 --> 27:50.000]  It's now getting rid of its old trappings and selling political correctness as a system of anti free speech and giving these tokens out.
[27:50.000 --> 27:59.000]  But oh, we're going to return this South African bronze statue of a bird to South Africa because someone says it might have been stolen 100 years ago.
[27:59.000 --> 28:05.000]  It's all garbage while they have mercenaries all over Africa just murdering people to keep them from getting their own land.
[28:05.000 --> 28:16.000]  The UN is in the New York Times admitting they go in and kill whole villages that won't leave their ancestral property to make it a carbon allotment sink.
[28:16.000 --> 28:22.000]  Where they build over here but don't let you build over there so they kick the humans off. This is the type of garbage we're talking about.
[28:22.000 --> 28:29.000]  While huge atrocities are going on, 300,000 dead Christians at the hands of Al Qaeda and ISIS in Libya and Syria alone.
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  Tens of thousands of Christians killed in Libya in places like Egypt. Our government backing it.
[28:35.000 --> 28:43.000]  But don't worry, we're going to put Harriet Tubman on one side of the $20 bill.
[28:43.000 --> 28:50.000]  It's all just to create a big fight. I say get the private Federal Reserve out of the money as David Knight said yesterday.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  Harriet Tubman helped create the Underground Railroad and free slaves.
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  The private Federal Reserve railroads everyone into being financial debt slaves.
[28:58.000 --> 29:02.000]  So see, here's the private Federal Reserve that's run our money since 1913.
[29:02.000 --> 29:07.000]  It's maneuvered us all into debt slavery, black unemployment's doubled, on and on and on.
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.000]  Half the blacks in the country don't even get born, but none of that matters.
[29:11.000 --> 29:18.000]  We're going to put Harriet Tubman on the $20. I think she was an amazing lady, it was very brave.
[29:18.000 --> 29:25.000]  I say absolutely, we have a free of the Republic and we actually get the Federal Reserve off our money and we actually bring cash back.
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.000]  Well, this is a war on cash. Then let's come out with all sorts of denominations of money.
[29:29.000 --> 29:33.000]  And I say put people like her on some of the money.
[29:33.000 --> 29:42.000]  But the point is, it's acting like the founders were bad when they started the movement that spread to England and Europe that ended slavery.
[29:42.000 --> 29:47.000]  See, they should put Thomas Jefferson and own slaves that tried to end it right next to her.
[29:47.000 --> 29:52.000]  He was the trailblazer. But because he tried to end it, he now gets blamed for it.
[29:52.000 --> 29:58.000]  That's because they hate him. They hate the Renaissance men. They hate the people that are here to free the humans.
[29:58.000 --> 30:04.000]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[34:07.000 --> 34:13.000]  And then subscribers to the Nightly News. You get all my films, the Nightly News, exclusive live events and so much more.
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  $5.95 a month. 20 people can use each membership. It takes about a minute to sign up.
[34:19.000 --> 34:26.000]  InfoWarsNews.com. InfoWarsNews.com or PrismPlanet.tv. I want to thank all the members out there.
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.000]  What I was getting at is that this is teleprompter free radio and television.
[34:31.000 --> 34:36.000]  Donald Trump, you know, that makes a big deal out of the fact and he should that he doesn't use a teleprompter.
[34:36.000 --> 34:52.000]  Now they want him when he gives policy speeches to go off one because it's complex issues, even when I get up to give a complex speech, say on economics or on the history of the New World Order
[34:52.000 --> 34:59.000]  and it's some two hour speech I've given before and it'll be on C-SPAN. I've got five or six pages of notes to remind me of where I'm going.
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  Sometimes I'll bring a stack of news articles so I can hold it up and say on this date, this happened.
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  So it's not that even a teleprompter in and of itself is bad.
[35:08.000 --> 35:18.000]  Even it's exhibits like a slide show you're showing, but when someone else writes it and you sit there like these anchors do and act like it's your own ideas
[35:18.000 --> 35:33.000]  and it'll say pause for intent or behave like you're angry or grimace or frown, they are now puppets, they are now actors.
[35:33.000 --> 35:39.000]  When you tune into Fox News or CNN or MSNBC, that's why the teleprompter is bad.
[35:39.000 --> 35:50.000]  Because it turns pundits and reporters and analysts into complete and total regurgitating monkeys, basically.
[35:50.000 --> 35:55.000]  Just vomiting out what they were already fed. It turns them into repeaters.
[35:55.000 --> 36:06.000]  But we are teleprompter free here and that's because I don't want to get in the mindset of everything being scripted and polished and supposedly perfect.
[36:06.000 --> 36:18.000]  The only thing that is perfect in this universe is imperfection and the fact that things do change and things do evolve and things are basically based on natural selection.
[36:18.000 --> 36:26.000]  You see, I don't believe in Darwinistic evolution. It's been proven to be a total lie.
[36:26.000 --> 36:35.000]  And it's the religion of the left to say we came from nothing, we are nothing, we have no free will because they know we have free will and want to sabotage that.
[36:35.000 --> 36:46.000]  But there is natural selection. A woman goes out and picks a man who she believes is attractive, nice to her, can protect her and will provide for her.
[36:46.000 --> 36:57.000]  And a man goes out and looks for a woman who looks healthy and sweet and nurturative and intelligent.
[36:57.000 --> 37:05.000]  Someone to build a family with, someone to build a village with, someone to build a civilization with, someone to reach for the stars and attain it with.
[37:05.000 --> 37:13.000]  How dare the globalist commit the great crime of getting between the most ancient of relationships, men and women and our species.
[37:13.000 --> 37:24.000]  We are together. We are one. And all this political correctness is an attack on that humanity by design. The debate's over.
[37:24.000 --> 37:36.000]  So finishing up with the whole Donald Trump situation, he's come out and said that Harriet Tubman of Underground Railroad should be on the 20.
[37:36.000 --> 37:52.000]  He says, pure political correctness for the Treasury Department's decision to feature the African-American abolitionists who was born into slavery and led the Underground Railroad instead of the nation's 17th president slave owner, Andrew Jackson.
[37:52.000 --> 38:03.000]  The total disconnect of the modern trendy, whose religion is political correctness, who doesn't care that Saudi Arabia basically still has slavery.
[38:03.000 --> 38:11.000]  The slavery is in dozens of countries. There's more slaves now than there's ever been. The people of China, 90-something percent of them are slaves.
[38:11.000 --> 38:30.000]  They can just be killed anytime. They're organs harvested for no reason by the political class. And the modern totalitarians cover up all of their criminal activity and all of their discrimination against all of us with the warrantless spying, all the different forms of treason,
[38:30.000 --> 38:42.000]  signing us on to these debts that aren't ours, by obsessing all day long. Yeah, there's the Daily Beast inside the world of Gulf state slavery.
[38:42.000 --> 38:51.000]  One of my daughters was talking about how horrible slavery was, and I said, yeah, I was just so terrible. I said, did you know that it was going on in over 60 countries until the 70s?
[38:51.000 --> 39:00.000]  Do you know there's still more than a dozen or so countries that have it officially going? Did you know a lot of UN members actually bring their slaves with them to New York?
[39:00.000 --> 39:07.000]  Sometimes off the airplanes with chains on their necks. Did you know that? She's like, no, dad, really, you're joking. And I pulled it up mainstream news.
[39:07.000 --> 39:22.000]  She goes, wow, why am I only told about black slavery? And I said, that's to create guilt in you so you feel like you're a bad person, not to help black people, but to then go along with the agenda of the social engineers to basically say you're convicted
[39:22.000 --> 39:30.000]  because you're wide of being bad. You've got to live the way we say, you've got to talk the way we say, you've got to do what we say, or we're going to announce that you're a bad person.
[39:30.000 --> 39:40.000]  So I say, good, take on that guilt. Let them tell you you're evil and bad because they're the people engaged in psychological warfare.
[39:40.000 --> 39:50.000]  And she goes, oh, I get it. They're bullying me. That's what this is all about. And I said, absolutely, from a, from an 11 year old, they're, oh, they're bullying. That's right.
[39:50.000 --> 40:01.000]  That's what this is, is bullying. There's an article out in the Guardian saying when people don't use proper English, and I've been over to England, I mean, it's disintegrating.
[40:01.000 --> 40:10.000]  Half the people can't speak English. I don't care whether they're from Eastern Europe or the Middle East or China or wherever they're from. It is a tower of Babel.
[40:10.000 --> 40:25.000]  And so then all these stores and shops become cloistered, where they only hire Spanish speaking or they only hire Chinese speaking Mandarin, or they only hire people that are speaking, you know, Russian or Slovak.
[40:25.000 --> 40:36.000]  It's meant to not bring us together, but to absolutely turn us into these little in fighting enclaves, which is the British Empire Great Game, back to square one again.
[40:36.000 --> 40:45.000]  I hype this up all the time because it needs to be pushed. I mean, this is how they're controlling everything. So on the surface, this was an amazing lady.
[40:45.000 --> 40:56.000]  And I think, you know, we should celebrate things like this, but they're not celebrating that they tried to get rid of slavery in the first Declaration of Independence, or in the Constitution of Bill of Rights.
[40:56.000 --> 41:07.000]  It was almost a civil war then. Then it was almost a civil war when they tried to get rid of slavery when Andrew Jackson was in. You weren't basically in most areas allowed to free your slaves.
[41:07.000 --> 41:18.000]  A lot of people that came to Texas were run out of Alabama. This is in the history books because they were arming the quote slaves and they were living in houses and were basically just part of the family.
[41:18.000 --> 41:31.000]  See, I'm not defending, he's defending the Constitution. No, I'm not. It's like slavery in a lot of areas of Africa. It's one group's grab is like a subclass under the other, but they're not the equivalent of color purple people being beaten to death.
[41:31.000 --> 41:39.000]  And that went on. You got mentally ill people and abusive, crazy people and folks that did that kind of stuff. That goes on in Saudi Arabia today.
[41:39.000 --> 41:49.000]  But this is the real history of it and they dumb it down. Not that George Washington wanted to free slaves, not that before he died, not that Thomas Jefferson wanted to.
[41:49.000 --> 42:01.000]  They have that movie killing you softly with Brad Pitt and at the end he goes, I don't want to hear about Thomas Jefferson. He just wanted to rape black women. What? Rape black women?
[42:01.000 --> 42:12.000]  So it wasn't loving that he had children with some of these women and that basically they were free and then he tried to get slavery ended.
[42:12.000 --> 42:22.000]  It's that he raped them, see, because all sex is rape now. They take anything and turn it evil and then don't talk about the fact that the West led the movement.
[42:22.000 --> 42:33.000]  Christians led the movement in the West. Protestants led the movement. So did Catholics in many areas of the world in Latin America to end slavery.
[42:33.000 --> 42:46.000]  Wars were fought over it and it still goes on. But as long as it's brown people doing it, it's okay. As long as communists are doing it, it's okay.
[42:46.000 --> 42:56.000]  This is the mental illness. So yes, Trump's right that this is being done. There's so much other news. I'm just taking this as an example to educate newcomers mainly to the show.
[42:56.000 --> 43:05.000]  I know most of our audience understands this better than I. That this is how they distract from all the real issues, all the real discrimination that humanity is going under by the globalist.
[43:05.000 --> 43:18.000]  Islamic states selling sex slaves to wealthy clients from Saudi Arabia and Turkey because it's basically legal in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, folks. You know what a harem is? It's enslaved sex slaves.
[43:18.000 --> 43:33.000]  That you then rent out to other men. Where's Gloria Steinem? Where? Where? Where? I say decriminalized prostitution, not that I support it, but because it at least empowers the women who are going to do it to be in charge of it
[43:33.000 --> 43:41.000]  and doesn't put it on the underground where the organized crime can control it.
[43:41.000 --> 43:54.000]  But where are the quote feminists? Well, there's no such thing, folks. It was created by the Department of War to get women into the workforce in the 1920s and 30s and to begin to end the family structure.
[43:54.000 --> 44:05.000]  The robber barons financed it. Eber Bernays wrote the public plans. He wrote three books on it. One of them is called Propaganda. He basically created that term.
[44:05.000 --> 44:14.000]  Sigmund Freud's nephew. I mean, you might want to read them brag about it and how they were going to do all of this because they've done it.
[44:14.000 --> 44:20.000]  And a politically correct person can sit there. Well, this is their whole world and they went to college and high school to learn all this bull.
[44:20.000 --> 44:26.000]  They don't know how to get a job or be charming or get along with people. They just know how to go around and henpeck everybody.
[44:26.000 --> 44:32.000]  And it's getting bad where people come up and henpeck. I got three kids and whole foods or come up and henpeck, you know, did your daddy hit you?
[44:32.000 --> 44:38.000]  You've got a, you know, a birthmark on the side of your head. I mean, they're in your business. They don't have a family. They don't have a life.
[44:38.000 --> 44:49.000]  They don't know how to do anything, but they know how to get in your business and tell you how you should do things.
[44:49.000 --> 45:00.000]  It just goes on and on. I want to get to the other news right now, but this all intersects and comes in and it's about a war on cash.
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.000]  It's about getting conservatives to give up on cash because they're going to turn it into this whole political correctness garbage.
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.000]  It's a well thought out program to train you that everything's coming down.
[45:09.000 --> 45:21.000]  If a hall is called Lynch Hall, it doesn't matter if the guy was a liberal 50 years ago and helped fund the school or was a great educator at that Pennsylvania institution.
[45:21.000 --> 45:32.000]  They take the name off the building because it scares people. The Irish name that is attached popularly to people being hung outside of law.
[45:32.000 --> 45:40.000]  And the system caters, oh, yes, you're scared of a Halloween party. Oh, yes, you're scared of a, you're scared of a, and now they're just saying, we don't want whites in our school.
[45:40.000 --> 45:47.000]  We want our whole areas. We want it segregated. And the schools are going, okay, we're going to let you segregate because they wanted them segregated again.
[45:47.000 --> 45:53.000]  First, they do forced integration to destroy all culture, not defending segregation.
[45:53.000 --> 46:03.000]  I'm saying the way they did it, destroy everybody's culture, create artificial culture, destroy local economies that segregation forced groups to have.
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.000]  Blacks are becoming too wealthy because that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[46:07.000 --> 46:13.000]  Own hotels, own restaurants, own bowling alleys, own movie theaters, own doctors, own colleges, own everything.
[46:13.000 --> 46:21.000]  Oh man, this is a problem. We got a plan and LBJ wrote letters about it and they did it.
[46:21.000 --> 46:28.000]  And they took the black community in 40 years, 50 years and made it unrecognizable.
[46:28.000 --> 46:34.000]  Lower illegitimacy rates in the 1940s, the black community, the white community, reversing those numbers.
[46:34.000 --> 46:40.000]  That's devastation. That's social engineering. That's weaponized culture.
[46:40.000 --> 46:49.000]  And now that weaponized culture is being imported and exported all over the world and wrecking societies within a decade.
[46:49.000 --> 46:59.000]  This is not black culture, it's CIA, weaponized crime culture.
[46:59.000 --> 47:08.000]  It's mind control people and they know what they're doing and they mean business.
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.000]  Big time. Big time.
[47:11.000 --> 47:14.000]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[47:14.000 --> 47:19.000]  Learn how the enemy operates. Learn their plans. Have you been brainwashed by it? Free yourself from it.
[47:19.000 --> 47:24.000]  Doesn't mean there isn't still going to be other systems that they've created out there that do oppress you.
[47:24.000 --> 47:29.000]  It doesn't mean you won't go through some racism or this or that, regardless of the color you are.
[47:29.000 --> 47:36.000]  But it's synthetic. It's artificial. Rise above it. Transcend it. That's where the power is.
[47:36.000 --> 47:45.000]  So when they stop having it be a private federal reserve that finances terrorist organizations, I say put Harriet Tubman on there, fine with me.
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.000]  But you know they're trying to put Margaret Sanger on there.
[47:50.000 --> 47:56.000]  Pretty sick. I'm going to go to break, come back. The Donald Trump video is now up on infowars.com.
[47:56.000 --> 48:07.000]  The premier here, Donald Trump's warning to America. Donald Trump releases video, an emergency warning to the American people.
[48:07.000 --> 48:12.000]  And it is a video he released. It did go viral. We promoted it and played it.
[48:12.000 --> 48:18.000]  We've now taken it and really doled it up and really added amazing footage and graphics that Darren McBrain put on there.
[48:18.000 --> 48:27.000]  This needs to go mega viral everywhere now, infowars.com. Presidentplanet.com has the video. Put it on your Facebook, Wall, Twitter, YouTube.
[48:27.000 --> 48:34.000]  Use free speech or lose it. This will wake people up. Donald Trump releases video, an emergency warning to the American people.
[48:34.000 --> 48:41.000]  Trump urges caution when allowing people into this country.
[48:41.000 --> 48:50.000]  Well, it's more than that. Trump urges, Trump puts out an emergency alert that this is the engineered collapse of the West.
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  We need to change that sub-headline. Not the Chris Fault. I didn't give him a headline. I'm doing that live here on the fly.
[48:55.000 --> 49:04.000]  We're going to come back into that and get into just the latest incredible social control, anti-free speech egalitarianism that they call political correctness in the United States and Europe.
[49:04.000 --> 49:18.000]  And our story that was the top story on Drudge Report last night, the big banner headline, because it is important, authorities buying more riot control gear over fear of civil unrest sweeping America.
[49:18.000 --> 49:26.000]  But before I go any further, I'm not going to hype this. Again, I'm just going to tell you the facts.
[49:26.000 --> 49:37.000]  We launched the joint formula, I don't know, six months ago. It's got five-star reviews. It's just the known concentrated organic compounds that are great for your joints and your skeleton.
[49:37.000 --> 49:47.000]  And from turmeric root extract, rosemary leaf extract, ginger root extract, the holly basil leaf extract, the green tea leaf extract, Japanese knotweed root extract,
[49:47.000 --> 50:06.000]  Barbary root extract, oregano leaf extract, Chinese skullcap root extract. It's concentrated the highest quality at a price at the same level or below one of these ingredients at the same dose level as you put filler in that you buy at a major store like Walgreens.
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.000]  That's the type of game changer we're talking about.
[50:11.000 --> 50:23.000]  This is so important. Joint formula, ladies and gentlemen, is amazing. And even if you haven't gotten older yet, you're wearing out your joints. Everybody needs to be on stuff like this.
[50:23.000 --> 50:32.000]  I've been taking it and it's amazing. I couldn't do 400-pound deadlifts six months ago, even though I could do it, it was hurting my joints.
[50:32.000 --> 50:44.000]  I started taking this right when it came out and I do not have any pain when I do 400 pounds. I'm going to videotape it soon. I'm going to do it like six times.
[50:44.000 --> 50:50.000]  I just haven't set it up or when I've had a camera, I'm just sweating with such a pig that I'm like, I can't put that out, but there's video of it.
[50:50.000 --> 50:57.000]  And I'm not sitting 400 pounds that much for how much I weigh. It's good. I could probably do 500 pounds right now, 600.
[50:57.000 --> 51:02.000]  I'm going to shoot to get to 600 about six months. I'm not even really into powerlifting, but it's just good to do.
[51:02.000 --> 51:06.000]  You know, show folks how I've gotten in shape. This is so important.
[51:06.000 --> 51:15.000]  Bone support is our latest product. And that's what I'm announcing is that this is part of the Skeletal Defense Package.
[51:15.000 --> 51:21.000]  20% off, we never do that when something first comes out. But I really want people to realize these aren't the sexy products.
[51:21.000 --> 51:29.000]  These aren't the things like, you know, X2, that's just the results are so incredible, you know, isn't so quickly or something like Supermell Vitality.
[51:29.000 --> 51:38.000]  But overall, you take this a few months. I mean, it's just amazing. And again, the nutraceutical Nazis out there, the soup Nazis out there to use a Seinfeld analogy.
[51:38.000 --> 51:43.000]  I don't mean literal Nazis. You know what I mean? The sites that are really into the highest quality and into reviewing them and just give us reviews.
[51:43.000 --> 51:54.000]  Nobody else gives because they go, wow, this is really a powerful formula that other people would sell for $50, $60 per bottle.
[51:54.000 --> 52:05.000]  I mean, it comes down to that, that there's such a huge discount.
[52:05.000 --> 52:14.000]  Now, again, it's $29.95 for the bone support should be $50, $60 for something comparable. And it's the same price for the joint formula.
[52:14.000 --> 52:23.000]  They go together in the Skeletal Defense Pack, you get 20% off that. And there's no reviews yet for bone support because it just came out.
[52:23.000 --> 52:31.000]  You can read the five star reviews for the joint formula. And the joint formula, again, is amazing.
[52:31.000 --> 52:37.000]  I haven't been taking the bone support yet. It was her taking a few weeks ago when the first run batch came in.
[52:37.000 --> 52:42.000]  But I haven't seen the results yet, obviously, because I just started taking it.
[52:42.000 --> 52:49.000]  But I'm told it synergistically works with the joint formula. And regardless, your purchase supports the broadcast.
[52:49.000 --> 52:56.000]  It's got vitamin D from a true organic form, 400 IUs. Calcium is calcium orate, which they say is the best type.
[52:56.000 --> 53:05.000]  110%. 110 mg. It's got magnesium and other things in it. Just check it out for yourself.
[53:05.000 --> 53:12.000]  And look at a bunch of fancy, you know, by CQ9 or 43Z1 where they just basically change the molecule and call it that.
[53:12.000 --> 53:21.000]  It's just the basic stuff that works as a fusion, the bone support with the joint formula and your purchase makes the broadcast possible.
[53:21.000 --> 53:27.000]  I want to thank you all for your support as we try to defend the Renaissance and basic freedom.
[53:27.000 --> 53:33.000]  So bone support is in.
[53:33.000 --> 53:39.000]  It's also got MSM. I should add that. That's really one of the key, key ingredients there for everybody to be aware of.
[53:39.000 --> 53:43.000]  Also, stop up on supermailvitalityinforwardslife.com. We know that our bodies are under

[54:46.000 --> 54:49.000]  And sometimes I babble through this stuff because it's teleprompter-free.
[54:49.000 --> 54:56.000]  And when you're teleprompter-free, I tell you, it is a lot more exhausting than folks that just sit there and go off talking points.
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  And believe me, so many radio shows will have every 15 minutes of topic.
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.000]  They play a clip. They kind of go off news articles and talking points.
[55:04.000 --> 55:09.000]  Hardly any of it is their own original thoughts and they just come back and take a few calls.
[55:09.000 --> 55:15.000]  And by the end of a three or four-hour show, the hosts I know are laying on their microphones so exhausted
[55:15.000 --> 55:20.000]  they've got to go lie down for a few hours because they're not into it.
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  But I will never trade my passion for glory.
[55:24.000 --> 55:30.000]  I go with my passion. There is no way I could be on air talking about all these issues
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  and shooting videos and doing the nightly news and working on the weekend
[55:34.000 --> 55:42.000]  if I didn't understand it was a primal war against humanity, a globalist takeover.
[55:42.000 --> 55:51.000]  Now, Donald Trump has been doing the parable of the snake for a long time.
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.000]  It's a very good two-minute parable.
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.000]  But added video of what he's talking about actually happening
[55:59.000 --> 56:03.000]  and the numbers and the graphics and the news stories is extremely powerful.
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  This is one of the most powerful videos ever.
[56:05.000 --> 56:08.000]  And I hope Donald Trump will retweet it. I'm going to tweet it at Trump.
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  He's retweeted a lot of our videos.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  I hope that everybody else will retweet it at Trump to make sure he gets it out.
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  And also put it on Facebook, Twitter, you name it.
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  I put this call out, folks. A lot of you do it, but if a majority of you did it,
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.000]  everything we do would be the number one news story.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  I mean, we used to take over Google hundreds of times and have the top search every day.
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  Remember that? Until they changed the entire Google algorithm to stop us.
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  There were news articles about it.
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  For two years, they couldn't figure out what to do.
[56:37.000 --> 56:43.000]  And I didn't want to exhaust the audience, so I would only do it every week or so.
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  I should have said troops. It's a key weapon.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  We could lose it any time. Let's do this now.
[56:47.000 --> 56:55.000]  We could put a headline up there with a key word in it and make it the number one story any time we want it.
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  We lost the Google bomb, but we have the people bomb.
[56:58.000 --> 57:01.000]  We have the viral resistance to tyranny bomb.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  We barely have time to play it, but let's go out to break.
[57:04.000 --> 57:07.000]  You know what? I'll have to do it.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  I'll have to do it at the start of the next hour.
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  But the video, the video is up on infowars.com right now.
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  And it is so important that you get this out to everyone you know.
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  Donald Trump releases video, an emergency warning to the American people.
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.000]  And we'll scroll down. Folks can actually see the video there on the site.
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  There it is.
[57:33.000 --> 57:40.000]  And it is so important for everyone to go see this video and to send it to everyone they know, your email list,
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  your Twitter, your Facebook, maybe you've got an old MySpace account, is that still around?
[57:44.000 --> 57:50.000]  And send this out because one of the biggest things they've got against him is his claim that he just hates anybody coming into the country.
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.000]  No, they stopped vetting people from the Middle East as part of a sleeper cell takeover.
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  And that's all it could be.
[57:57.000 --> 58:03.000]  And they have staged videos, totally fake of people throwing, you know, Arab children on railroad tracks.
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.000]  And they staged dead babies on the beach and, you know, say they drowned and just all this bull.
[58:07.000 --> 58:12.000]  And the Pope runs around saying open the borders. This is global government. This is the end of nation states.
[58:12.000 --> 58:21.000]  This is the globalist waging war against what's left of good economies with poor desperate throngs of people who won't be saved by coming here.
[58:21.000 --> 58:30.000]  Because when they get here, they get propagandized and brainwashed and sheep dipped and inducted into the cult of political correctness
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  that we're going to cover when we come back in 70 seconds.
[58:32.000 --> 58:38.000]  And take action. You are the info warriors. Send out the link to this Trump video and to infowars.com for its last show.
[58:38.000 --> 58:42.000]  There's Roger Stones coming up so much more with Key Inside Baseball.
[58:42.000 --> 59:05.000]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down.
[59:05.000 --> 59:09.000]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it. And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[59:09.000 --> 59:16.000]  I got my bottle of brain force right there. I popped two of them. And about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything just kind of clears up.
[59:16.000 --> 59:23.000]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[59:23.000 --> 59:28.000]  because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.000]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force.
[59:32.000 --> 59:38.000]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in.
[59:38.000 --> 59:48.000]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  Waging War on Corruption is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  I haven't even gotten into the political correctness brainwashing news. It's a tsunami now. This is directed, this is planetary, this is planned.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  Let me just hit some of these headlines and then I'm going to come back and start the next segment.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  I will air the Donald Trump video that is so powerful.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  Donald Trump has issued a video that is an emergency warning. And obviously I say that to catch people's attention to make it go viral.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  And it's true. He did do it in the video. He did do the parable of the snake that already went viral. We've taken it and squared it.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  We've taken it to the next level. Donald Trump released this video, an emergency warning to American people.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  And we've changed the headline. The sub-headline of you guys hit a question mark or a refresh. I can give them the new headline.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  But Kit Daniels just had another story go up on infowars.com. ESPN facing backlash after firing, shilling over anti-PC views.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  Network's decision to terminate shilling backfiring. They don't care if you're mad though because they want you to know we will not tolerate anybody who doesn't say that your children belong to the state
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  and who doesn't use the language we want and who doesn't submit. As I mentioned earlier, in England they're going on TV and saying, look, using proper English is racist.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  They want language to disintegrate. So only the ruling class uses it. Remember the founder of Apple, the creator of the iPad?
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  He said, I won't let my son or daughter have an iPad. I don't want brain damaged idiots. That's for your kids.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  So we're going to get into that. But look, report, authorities buying more riot control gear over fear of civil unrest sweeping America.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  Well, you guys print me the thing about Chicago and the elites going into bunkers too. I want to tie this together.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  But getting back into political correctness, the Guardian correcting people's bad grammar is racist.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  Let me have the video of them saying that. That's a Paul Joseph Watson article up on infowars.com.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  Here's another one. As we mentioned, ESPN fires shilling for conservative views. We're going to be breaking that down coming up at the start of the next segment.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  And then this, CBC won't name Lethbridge Swimming Pool Sex Assault Suspect because he's a Muslim migrant.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  Whether it's Sweden or Germany or Canada, you name it. When it's a Muslim or a migrant, they will not say they're an illegal alien.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  They will not say they're a Muslim. And then they have feminist groups go out and say, it's white German males.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  That was on TV. Then they have the Green Party come and apologize for German men raping women.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  And people go, man, that is sick. It's psych warfare to overthrow reality. It's like saying you never voted in primaries.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  There were never elections. The people have spoken. The grass, the grass roots uprising has happened. I'm Ted Cruz.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  You're like, canceling votes is not the grass roots. Yes, it is.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  Campus pro abortion display, baby shaped cookies with heads broken off. See, they tell you to adopt whatever language they want.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  But in the PC crowd, they're allowed to use the N word and the F word and they're allowed to say, quote, my vagina is too pretty to let a fetus crawl out.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  And I use terms like, but this is what they do at the campus. And then everybody, they raise money off of little pieces of body parts that they made off what they saw in the pro life videos.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  But of course, the pro lifers that got the video are being arrested and rounded up and, you know, imprisoned. Everything's so loving. So everything's so trendy.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  And then they celebrate. I've seen the women wearing these shirts about, I don't want an ugly baby. I killed mine. Remember?
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  We have video that I kill my kids. They're like, wow, that's right. A plan will.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  We're like, whoa, man. Is this like space aliens or something? I mean, interdimensional or they just mentally ill? I mean, we're not ill.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.900]  The potatars, yeah, kill the cellar, yeah, burn that rowy, decide the language you use,
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:05:12.900]  your children are ours, yeah, kill them, yeah, say tonight, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:28.920]  Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:31.440]  was dehumanizing, adding that it is embarrassing
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.240]  and quite frankly, disgusting.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.240]  I'm surprised she didn't just say watermelon.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.800]  Just go all the way where the Clark added.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.200]  If any other candidate were to say something like that
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.000]  about black people, it would derail their campaign,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.760]  but the rules seem to be different for the Clintons.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.960]  And that is something that we continue to see.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.200]  Black people know they're being panned or too Clark said,
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.600]  nothing has gotten better under Democrat control.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.760]  You go to all the cities where there's high poverty.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.840]  They're all run by liberal Democrat mayors.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.880]  This is Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.960]  Hi, yeah, first of all, I want to say,
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.120]  secret 12, that's a two, super male,
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.440]  brain force, prostagart, silver bullet.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.440]  I use them all.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.400]  They're phenomenal.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.240]  They work.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.080]  Buy info.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:09.920]  Thanks brother.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.560]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.400]  I am a relatively short time listener
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:18.240]  and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.600]  Welcome to the info war.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.160]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:25.440]  that support your health and the info war at the same time.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.280]  And I'm your listener.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.680]  I buy all the nutraceuticals,
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.120]  Casio effects,
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:29.960]  Nathan.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:30.800]  Why, God, let me ask you a question.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.120]  Have they worked for you?
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.480]  They're the most unbelievable products
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.720]  I've ever had in my life.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.000]  What products are you taking?
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:36.840]  Are you taking?
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:39.720]  Everything from super male to brain force,
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:44.080]  to winter sun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:45.920]  So when I just free up everything
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.720]  and I just went to auto bill.

[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:02.680]  Secret 12, Info Wars Life's vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.880]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.440]  and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.280]  by the body.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.640]  That's why for real results,
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.960]  so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections,
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.320]  which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.000]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.240]  that we can bring you our most bioactive,
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.480]  powerful form of B12 that has been developed

[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:34.600]  methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections,
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.400]  and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.360]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth,
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.040]  right on the tongue and then swallowed.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.920]  No needles, no injections.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.560]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.800]  Try it for yourself.

[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.400]  InfoWarslife, Secret 12.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.840]  From his central Texas command center,
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.240]  deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:11.720]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.920]  In the last five minutes, masses of news has broken.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:17.400]  If you're a radio listener, you go to dredgereport.com
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.520]  and you can see if yourself will put it up on screen
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.560]  for TV viewers.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:24.280]  So much traffic that dredge actually
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:28.320]  crashed the TMZ website, the sites he linked to.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:31.000]  Prince Dead, we have a siren right there.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.280]  And when you try to go to it,
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:37.720]  it's a 503 service unavailable brought down that website.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.320]  So we're just gonna take the screenshot
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.920]  and get it up on infowars.com for folks.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.240]  But for TV viewers already,
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.640]  it looks like I can now read you the article.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.720]  Again, broke first there
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.920]  and then dredge linked to it, so it's down.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.840]  The artist known as Prince has died, TMZ has learned.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.280]  He was 57.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.080]  It's pretty hard to crash TMZ.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.760]  Prince's body was discovered
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.440]  at his Paisley Park compound in Minnesota
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.880]  early this morning.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:06.200]  Multiple sources connected to the singer confirmed
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.400]  he has passed.
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.160]  I just asked the question, was it drugs
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.480]  when she was found in a bathtub with Whitney Houston?
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:14.400]  Everybody said I was so evil and so horrible.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:16.080]  With this, I'm not saying it's that.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.760]  I'm saying is it one of these weaponized flues?
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.800]  The singer, full name Prince Rogers Nelson,
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.840]  had a medical emergency on April 15th
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.280]  that forced his private jet
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:27.040]  to make an emergency landing in Illinois.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.640]  But he appeared at a concert the next day
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.920]  to assure his fans he was okay.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.760]  You know, that was a mistake.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.560]  His people told TMZ he was battling the flu.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.120]  Prior to his most recent appearance,
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.760]  however, Prince had canceled two shows
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.880]  due to health concerns.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.640]  Prince became an international superstar in 82
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.080]  after his breakthrough album, 1999.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:50.680]  So we lost Merle Haggard two weeks ago
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:54.080]  and listeners said, is it all the geoengineering spring,
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.120]  the aluminum dioxide?
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.160]  They had myths going on, but a secretive
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.760]  with the record numbers of people having respiratory problems.
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.000]  And then I didn't even know that Merle Haggard
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.040]  had made a song about chemtrails.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.920]  We actually played it.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.960]  And we were already talking about
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:11.080]  what they call the chemtrail cough around the country
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.960]  that even doctors are testing with soil
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.920]  and stuff and finding, you know, all this aluminum.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.800]  And then I realized Prince went on everything
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.040]  from Arsenio Hall back when he was still on
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.120]  to like late night, you name it,
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.960]  talking about geoengineering and chemtrailing.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.840]  So we're gonna put an article out here
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.840]  that Daniels is doing and asking, you know,
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.640]  did, was Prince killed by the chemtrails
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:38.040]  he spoke out against, like Merle Haggard spoke out against.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.840]  I mean, the point is they thought people
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.760]  were being sprayed in a second and they're dead.
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.640]  And all I'm saying is we can obviously use this sad death
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:48.640]  for some good, get people to look into what Prince believed.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.760]  Very, very reclusive individual.
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.040]  I like a lot of his music, I was a great artist.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.920]  Boy, I tell you, I've known a lot of girlfriends
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.120]  that were just huge fans.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.840]  So that is just some of the news on that front.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:09.480]  Other breaking news that we're gonna be getting into.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.040]  There is just so much of it.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.800]  And then we're going to Larry Nichols here in just a moment.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.600]  We have some new Paul Watson articles
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.960]  that I'm going to be getting into
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.160]  and breaking down that are just too incredible
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.720]  and I can't air them here.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:25.160]  There's a new Mark Dice video
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.960]  where they wanna ban cash, the trend these do,
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:28.800]  and there's another one.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:31.120]  Social Justice Warrior tells ex-Soviet citizen
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.560]  he should be thrown in a labor camp for being racist.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:36.680]  I believe in the dictatorship of the proletariat.
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.360]  So the communists are here
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.720]  and folks that ran away from them are freaking out.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.640]  That video that is so over the top, we can't play it,
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.360]  because it's so vile and there's so much cussing.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.360]  It is an overload of information right now.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.880]  Now, we've only got him at the bottom of the hour,
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.360]  but I'm gonna have him pop in weekly
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.080]  and he's battling cancer himself.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:01.280]  Folks really need to pray for and support Larry Nichols.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.400]  He's the guy that helped get Clinton impeached
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.760]  at the house level that is indicted.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.760]  It didn't get him convicted in the Senate.
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.120]  He's the guy behind the Clinton Chronicles and so much more.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.200]  I mean, the original mother load of exposing the Clintons
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.240]  and he knows how they operate
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.560]  because he used to basically run their campaigns.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.880]  Farmer Green Beret, obviously brought in
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:23.080]  by the establishment to run their domestic operations.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.360]  And that's why he knew the Clintons,
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.600]  but he wouldn't commit all these crimes,
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.760]  so he got out of it.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.200]  Now, we don't have a lot of time today.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.920]  Someone go right to him because
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.840]  this is what he's been hammering the last few months
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.040]  and now we're seeing it in the news.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.040]  DrudgeReport.com linked to this last night
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.320]  was the top store eats on him,
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.440]  AppleWars.com right now, had it moved back to the top.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:44.160]  Report, authorities buying more riot control gear
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:48.280]  over fear of civil unrest sweeping America.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.040]  Concerns about Ferguson style disorder continue to build.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.240]  I'm gonna get more into this.
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.400]  This is the Snadler research.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.120]  You've got Lloyds of London saying
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.800]  they believe this is imminent, basically.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.400]  Other top research in crisis firms.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.480]  They say we're in the worst position ever, basically.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.520]  Millionaires fleeing Chicago over fear of civil unrest.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.480]  Remember that last week in FullWars.com.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.080]  We've got the other reports of the billionaires
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.520]  buying armored redouts and leaving to New Zealand,
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.920]  which we told you eight years ago.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:19.640]  Now that's confirmed that people like James Cameron
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.960]  left over the economic concern.
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.640]  Sure, they open up shop when they're overseas
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.120]  and still make movies, but people are getting out of dodge.
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:31.400]  And I've had that from high level, Congress, Senate,
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.560]  billionaires, I mean, famous people,
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:35.400]  top Hollywood, top producers.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:38.000]  And so the truth is, they all know
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.160]  that what we're talking about is accurate and real.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.360]  They just don't know when it's coming.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:45.640]  Next week, two years from now, it's a time bombs all we know.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.240]  Just like the big one to hit LA.
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.880]  We know it's years overdue.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.360]  Will it be this month or 10 years from now?
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.240]  We don't know, but it's coming.
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.240]  It's like death's coming.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.920]  But let's say you're an 89 year old man
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:59.480]  who's had 14 heart attacks, 20 splints or whatever.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:02.200]  And you're gonna try to go climb a 5,000 foot mountain.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.840]  There's a good chance you're gonna blow
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.640]  your A word of sky high.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.200]  And I'd say our economy is just like that right now.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.200]  An 89 year old man who's had 14 heart attacks,
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:14.320]  the heart is rotten and they've got us
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.720]  on an elliptical at full speed.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.040]  Now I don't know when he's gonna have a stroke
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.200]  or when he's gonna have a heart attack
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.040]  or what's gonna happen.
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.880]  But we're on top a ticking time bomb.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.280]  I don't know, cause I can't see
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.400]  cause we're sitting on it's down there.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:29.200]  I can't see where that egg timer is.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.480]  But all I hear is, that's what I'm telling you.
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.560]  And the elites are running to the hills.
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.960]  Now some say, oh, you do all this.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.240]  This will actually destroy confidence and bring it on.
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.960]  They set this up to do this
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:42.600]  and get total power out of the collapse.
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.960]  I'm trying to get people warned and ready.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.040]  And personally, I've been getting more storable food
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.360]  and medical supplies and I buy my own product.
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.800]  M4Ware Select is the best out there.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.560]  That's what I'd super high quality for very low price.
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.880]  M4Ware Select and M4WareSelect.com, M4WareStore.com.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.040]  I didn't mean to go into a plug,
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.960]  but I'm like, why aren't I plugging food?
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.360]  I'm the one selling it.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.920]  I personally am hoarding it.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.120]  I'm buying a bunch for the office.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.160]  I've got gas generators put in and all sorts of other stuff.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.360]  Put solar panels in, everything else.
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:13.280]  Putting wells in, I mean folks, this is real.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.920]  Now I hope we have a miracle
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.240]  and we land this plane that's got both engines out
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.000]  and is on fire with psycho hijackers
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.160]  running around with belly bombs.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.800]  But that's the allegory, that's the analogy.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.600]  Larry Nichols, thank you so much for joining us
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.440]  for these two short segments.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.080]  This is what you've been harping on.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.200]  You say it's imminent from your sources and more.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:36.040]  Nobody's really talked about it, but it was in the news.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.240]  A few weeks ago, the secret meeting of Yellen
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:39.880]  and the Treasury Head, the Federal Reserve Head,
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.240]  and Obama, that's not supposed to happen under law.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.440]  Larry Nichols, what's really going on?
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.160]  And I hope you're wrong that it's imminent
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.000]  in the next few weeks.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.640]  I mean, we need more time to get folks ready.
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.400]  We need to try to pull out of this.
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.880]  There's so much more to get to.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.880]  You know, Alex, let me just say to everybody,
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.960]  you better provision yourself.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.760]  How do I know it's imminent?
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.760]  Well, first off, you have to understand, Alex,
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:09.320]  I've got the perfect cover right now with this election.
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:10.680]  This election, as you know,
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.600]  covers the news from morning till night.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.840]  Nothing's out there,
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.680]  but there are tons of things going on.
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:21.400]  This economy is about to collapse.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.280]  Look, they're not gonna have a meeting
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.800]  with Biden, Obama, and the Federal Reserve Lady,
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.680]  they're not gonna have that meeting.
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.760]  They're not gonna talk about what in that meeting,
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:35.480]  martial law, are you kidding me?
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.240]  Listen, it's coming.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.440]  Is it coming this week?
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.920]  Is it coming next week?
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:42.320]  I don't know that, but I will tell you this.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.920]  Every morning, Alex, every morning I wake up
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:48.080]  and I turn on the television
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:51.320]  and I turn it on to see has it happened yet?
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.800]  Has it triggered?
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.320]  Has it started?
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.560]  It's coming, folks.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:59.240]  Anybody that has eyes should be able to see
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.120]  that there is a collapse of the financial structure.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.880]  Then they go around, the FDIC announces,
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.680]  the FDIC announces that two of the five major banks
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.320]  cannot cover the insurance fund.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.120]  You think you've got $100,000 in the bank
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:18.160]  and it's covered because it's an FDIC-insured bank.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:21.200]  Let me tell you, you'll be lucky
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.880]  if when this thing happens, I didn't mean to say if.
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.680]  When this thing happens, you'll be lucky to get
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.560]  two cents on a dollar.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.400]  Why?
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.720]  Because they don't have the money in reserve
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.480]  to cover the insurance policy.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.840]  They're out there talking about this stuff.
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:38.320]  When you see lords of London raising
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.560]  their entrance rates,
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.760]  you know, I was talking to one of their people last week.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:47.720]  They're 25 miles of ships, of tankers,
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.120]  super tanks or tankers.
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.880]  Just stop that in the ocean.
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.800]  Why? Because there's no place to sit in the oil.
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.320]  Well, they're sitting there wanting to know,
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.520]  for me, what do you think?
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.520]  I said, well, guys, I can get my anti-powered group ready
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.760]  because you're gonna start seeing pirates
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:05.000]  sitting out there taking those ships over.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:07.760]  Alex, it's coming.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760]  Can't you see it?
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.760]  And don't you see the purpose of using this election
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.720]  as the perfect cover grid?
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.560]  No, I get it.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.400]  You said this a year ago.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.200]  They'll cover the economic collapse
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.360]  under a race war blaming Trump.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.640]  Classic communist tactic.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.000]  And, you know, I saw this morning, Alex,
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.040]  I saw Renz Priebus and they were trying to get out of him.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.600]  Is there a white knight candidate
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.520]  gonna get the nomination?
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:33.800]  You know, when they go to convention,
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:37.760]  he spent five minutes trying to enter it without entering it.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.480]  Folks, I promise you,
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:44.080]  you know why they won't let Donald Trump be president?
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:47.120]  Is because if Donald Trump gets to be president,
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.640]  there is a chance.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.600]  There's a chance.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.320]  He can mess this system up that they've got plans.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.880]  And he's also said he's gonna start trying
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:54.960]  to arrest these people behind it.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.040]  He wants to save the country.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:56.880]  That's right.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:57.720]  He's not that he's perfect.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.800]  He just doesn't want to kill the golden goose.
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:00.640]  That's right.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.840]  Look, I'm not, you're not, I know you're not.
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:05.240]  I'm not trying to say Donald Trump is a fantasy
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.760]  for the world's problems.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.600]  I'm not saying that at all.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.480]  No, they're scared of him because he's a nationalist
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.400]  and isn't in on the plan to bring the country down.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.360]  But I've been told by high level folks,
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.440]  I'm as high as they get to Donald Trump.
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.440]  I'll put to you that way.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:17.760]  He knows about the new world order.
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:18.600]  He doesn't like it.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.200]  And he believes he almost didn't run.
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.080]  And this came out after I was told about it.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.280]  I'm saying it was confirmed.
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.640]  Politico see for like a month,
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:27.960]  he went to Scotland and almost didn't do it.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.800]  But he said, I just can't watch him destroy the country.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.880]  And he, and he does have a big ego.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.560]  He thinks he can save us.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.480]  And you know, the question is,
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.280]  are we smart enough to realize they're throwing everything
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.240]  they've got against him?
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.000]  Because they've been tapping his phones.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.600]  They know he knows what's going on.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.320]  And they are absolutely scared to death of him.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.400]  But listen, here's what I'm saying, Larry.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.000]  Some of the intel I've got is,
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.200]  and I want to know if you were specifically told by insiders
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.080]  or you're looking at this and can see it happening.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.480]  So I know you have a lot of sources
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.560]  that they want to plunge it once Trump gets in
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.720]  and have it be race riots around that time.
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:00.240]  Are you saying they may pull it beforehand
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.480]  because they can't control it?
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.080]  Because once they set something like this in motion,
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:06.640]  obviously they don't fully control it
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.920]  once the cow gets out of the barn.
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.600]  There are two dynamics going.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:15.160]  Number one, Obama and his guys are getting all ready
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.240]  because they see when they yank,
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.400]  if they go to convention in Cleveland,
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.680]  Trump wins a majority of the vote
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.040]  and they pull the nomination away from him.
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:29.120]  Obama's people see a wonderful opportunity to step in
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.440]  when the riots and the fits are thrown.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:32.520]  They won't have to be much,
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.160]  but if there's any kind of throw up and fit
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.960]  and blowback from that,
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.000]  he's set ready to bring in a female provisional government.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.080]  In other words, he'll say, look,
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.840]  there's no reason to have an election
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.520]  due to the instability with all the people.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:47.120]  And by the way, the Pentagon and the police admit
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.960]  they've been given orders to get ready.
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.360]  There's massive gear of that.
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.480]  That's in the news.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.520]  Drugs linked to our story.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.000]  You can go to our Twitter or Paul's Twitter
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.240]  and see it yesterday.
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:56.080]  Top story.
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.000]  I mean, this is really going on.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.680]  This is actually going on.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.800]  So now you've got Obama.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.640]  He's set ready to take this.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.680]  Now folks, I'm not kidding you.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.880]  They're not gonna give Trump.
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.760]  They're not gonna give Trump that nomination.
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:09.960]  Now there's something we can do.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.560]  We'll talk about when we can.
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.680]  Then you've got on the other side,
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:15.520]  you've got the Democrat,
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:18.400]  I mean, the Republican party establishment.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:22.080]  They want to be, Alex is crazy in this sense.
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.400]  They want to be in charge when this thing collapses.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.240]  Why?
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.800]  Because when the provisional government is activated,
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:33.280]  they are the elite central leadership.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.160]  You said this a year ago
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.480]  when you first started coming back on the show.
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:39.080]  You said that they're getting it ready.
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.560]  And you were there when the Clintons were licking
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.360]  their lips even back then.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.600]  That's right.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:44.800]  That it's coming
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.680]  and everything's moving to this crescendo.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.240]  Do I believe they're gonna wait
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.920]  until Trump gets it and then do it?
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.880]  No, I don't.
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.920]  This is gonna happen before Trump gets it.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:57.240]  Look, I don't even know now, Alex, if they can stop
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.320]  that the economy is in such bad shape.
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:05.480]  Such bad shape that all they're able to do now, Alex,
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:10.480]  is to spread us out on looking at other things
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:14.400]  and not looking at the essentials to this economy.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.760]  Well, yeah, that's what's scary is
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.600]  they're just buying time and diverting
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.600]  while the elites themselves run and buy farmhouses
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.440]  and dig bunkers.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:23.560]  I mean, that's crazy.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.840]  I've never seen such a movement
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.360]  by the billionaires, by the ruling class.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.560]  And I guess they think they'll just grayed out the collapse
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:31.200]  and then come out on top.
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.640]  And isn't it crazy, Alex,
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:35.080]  that you're sitting here trying to tell your people
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.760]  you really need to get ready.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:39.320]  You need to kinda provision yourself
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:42.400]  in case this thing falls and they make it out like
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:46.240]  you're a nut when all the time they're doing it,
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.880]  they're doing it, they just don't want you doing it.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.680]  So folks, I wanna tell you,
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.080]  and I'm not here to promote that thing.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.560]  That ain't what I do,
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:57.600]  but you better provision up yourself.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:02.600]  You better make plans because this thing is going to fall in.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:05.120]  Police departments are stockpiling
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:07.720]  giant amounts of goods, emergency goods,
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.360]  weapons, armored vehicles,
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.160]  and they're being told, civil war, civil war,
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.560]  the last six, seven years.
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.280]  And now you see them,
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.120]  Obamacare to shut the economy down
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.560]  and regulations in Europe at 100% taxes in France
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.080]  to shut everything down and 5 million immigrants,
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.240]  just bedlam all by design to bring the civilization down.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:29.080]  Then you wonder, why did Obama go to Cuba?
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:32.160]  Why do we need to open relationships with Cuba?
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.520]  What on earth do we get out of that?
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.800]  Nothing, unless you understand what I knew
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:38.880]  from back in the days
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.720]  when I was floating around Central America in Nicaragua,
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:44.360]  Cuba can put on the ground,
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:47.440]  Alex, in this country in six hours,
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:50.040]  250,000 troops.
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.600]  And by the way, people make jokes about this
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.440]  who are ignorant.
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.920]  This is not the badly organized Iraqis.
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:57.320]  The Soviets trained the Cuban military
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.600]  as they're excellent ground fighters.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.520]  They've got a lot of high tech technology.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:02.360]  And the point is,
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.480]  they were even using them in Syria.
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.320]  Yes, folks.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.040]  And they've used them all over Africa.
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:10.400]  These are basically what Cuba sells is its troops.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.720]  They basically have a mercenary force.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.800]  I have fought what's called the Cuban black cats.
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.840]  I've literally been fighting them.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.120]  I have actually fought them.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.840]  They are a worthy opponent.
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.680]  Now imagine in six hours,
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:26.480]  you can have 250,000 here in this country
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:27.720]  to do what?
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.200]  To put us into submission.
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.480]  As soon as you say, well, we're America,
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:33.320]  we're not gonna be able to do that.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.160]  We're super decadent.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.360]  They attack all the power plants.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.760]  They attack the few cities that don't capitulate.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.040]  That's why they even have the Pentagon train
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:41.320]  to take over Texas and T cities
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.760]  where they know we're gonna put up a defense
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.880]  with legitimate government.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:44.720]  They're gonna come in here
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:47.080]  with the communist merc forces.
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.480]  And folks, they'll blow all the power plants.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.920]  They're not gonna come fight us right away.
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.880]  They're gonna blow the water plants, everything.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.640]  Take over the TV and radio stations
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.880]  and then tell us,
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:58.640]  with local English speakers that we run by the UN,
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.840]  submit and we'll turn the power back on.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.800]  They're gonna claim the militias and patriots
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.320]  have blown up the power plants, guaranteed.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:08.320]  Yeah, now ask yourself this about Flint, Michigan.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.080]  Is Flint, Michigan this great fiasco
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:13.920]  of how they got the water system all screwed up?
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:18.280]  Or what if that was a pilot project to find out,
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.640]  see if they could take the community to its knees
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:23.840]  by polluting the water system?
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:27.120]  Look, y'all, do yourself a favor.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.040]  It don't do me no good.
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.040]  Probably not even gonna do me any good,
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.680]  but it can help you.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:34.960]  You better stock up.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:39.160]  And like I say, I'm not here to sell anything.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.000]  That's your call.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.040]  But you can see it with Cleveland
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.560]  and the election and canceling primaries.
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.520]  I mean, this is so incredible.
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.640]  Larry, what do we do to try to stop this?
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:50.960]  I mean, there's got to, I guess, expose the plan.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.360]  Well, number one, there's one thing
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.280]  that I will be announcing next Monday.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.760]  There's a way to stop them taking this thing from Trump.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.120]  Our only defense, Alex, and it's crazy,
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.320]  but our only defense is to stop them
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.360]  from taking the nomination from Trump.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.240]  How do you do it?
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:11.920]  I'm trying to talk fast and then they ain't my strong seat.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:13.280]  The first thing you gotta realize,
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.040]  there's not a politician in Washington or in your state.
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:18.560]  All they care about, Alex, is their job.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.600]  They don't care about you.
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.640]  They don't care about me.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.120]  They don't care about our grandkids.
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.920]  They want to keep their job.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.920]  John McCain and three or four other establishment,
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:33.240]  you know, Republican congressmen and senators
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:34.600]  have announced what?
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.120]  They're not going to the convention.
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:36.960]  Why?
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:40.160]  Because they know they're gonna steal
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.360]  that nomination from Trump
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:45.360]  and they don't want to be at that convention
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.320]  because it'll cause them to lose their race.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.600]  Monday on my Facebook page,
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.120]  I'm gonna put out a script and I'm gonna name
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.760]  four or five congressmen and senators, Alex,
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:00.400]  and I need people to call these senators and congressmen
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.120]  and read that script.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:02.960]  All right, let's do this.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.760]  Let's get you on for 15, 20 minutes on Monday.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:06.760]  If you can do it today,
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:07.720]  I want to get you back home
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.880]  and Gucci Artie host the fourth hour
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.600]  for a full 30 minutes to have plenty of time.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.200]  Recap this and go over it all.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.480]  Do you want to come on?
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.320]  Not yet.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.160]  We have to.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.000]  I gotta let you go.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:18.960]  I've got a short of time.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:19.920]  Yes, we're going to break.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.600]  We'll show your Facebook on screen.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.600]  Folks that want to support Larry battling cancer as well,
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.520]  go to his PayPal.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.000]  He's giving up everything he's doing to do this
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.240]  so he needs your support, NicholsLive at aol.com
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.680]  and we'll talk about that again with him in the fourth hour.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.520]  He'll be back in two hours.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.240]  You're good in two hours, right, Larry?
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.400]  Yes, sir, I'll be here.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.480]  We'll do it in this studio in two hours
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.440]  with Anthony Gucci Artie.
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.280]  God bless you.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:43.160]  Important stuff, stay with us.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.720]  Now, I said I get to this Donald Trump video.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:46.120]  Do we have time to get to this before we go to break?
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:46.960]  We don't do it.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:50.760]  I've got Roger Stone coming on.
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:53.560]  You guys don't have your mic open
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.400]  or you're just open it for a moment.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.440]  Okay, that's fine.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:00.720]  Anyways, what this comes down to is all hell
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.440]  is breaking loose, okay?
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:05.920]  All over the world, not just here domestically.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:09.200]  Now, I hope Larry's wrong about the things he's saying,
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.840]  but we're seeing moves and preparations
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.160]  that all point towards something like this.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:18.120]  Look on every political front,
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.560]  things are happening that have never happened before,
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:24.640]  all over the world, and the globalists are more brazen,
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:29.640]  more naked, more out of control than they've ever been.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:36.000]  And the preparations for total collapse have accelerated.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.120]  And I'm sitting here realizing that I've gotten
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:41.160]  somewhat ready, but I told people last week,
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:42.600]  I said I want to get a bunch of storable food
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.800]  from Info or Select, our own brand.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:48.520]  This is a plug, but I mean, it's literal for enough,
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.560]  for basically everybody that works here for a year.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:51.560]  I don't know if I have that much money,
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.320]  but it is very affordable.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:56.040]  And I said more medical supplies, more everything,
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.040]  get ready.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:00.000]  And I did this years ago because the world is untenable.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:02.520]  The world is being set up to collapse.
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:03.720]  It's clowered and piven.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:05.320]  It's a June 21.
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.960]  And I keep always pushing it back in time,
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.720]  hoping we're slowing it down, hoping they're not this crazy.
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:12.560]  The problem is they are.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.720]  But then my crew gets so busy, they kind of just take it
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.280]  like, oh, he just said get a bunch of storable food.
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:17.280]  It hasn't happened.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.440]  I understand you not getting ready,
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.280]  because I don't either.
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:24.240]  I'm too busy myself.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.320]  Dealing with the doctor's appointments and the bills
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.800]  and the in-laws and the employees and the taxes
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:34.160]  and the garbage and covering the news and all the rest of it.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.080]  But we need to get politically active,
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:38.400]  like our lives depend on it, to warn people
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.280]  that the globalists are setting us up for a fall
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:42.360]  and that they're behind it so they can't come in
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:44.440]  and act like they're the savior during the crisis.
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.520]  This is a war, an info war.
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:48.640]  And we need to be prepared and self-sufficient.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:52.160]  On the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:55.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:02.320]  Once again, the social justice warriors are back at it again.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.280]  Andrew Jackson, who fought Central Bank,
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:07.720]  removed from $20 bill, but they'll leave Hamilton
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:11.840]  on the $10 bill, and he was pro-Central Bank
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:14.160]  as public concern for liberty erased.
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:15.840]  Article up by Max Lavo.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:19.320]  The latest battle is for the face of the currency itself
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:22.360]  and the central bankers who control the front anyway
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.960]  have imposed a symbolic defeat against the leaders
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:26.520]  in America's past who have fought
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:29.320]  against the stranglehold of the money makers.
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.600]  Naturally, there are liberal politics at play,
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.680]  fighting for every inch of ground in the war,
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:37.080]  cardiological re-engineering, history is being whitewashed,
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:41.000]  various figures of antiquity rolling in their graves.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.480]  We keep seeing this time and time again.
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:46.240]  We were just at the Portland State University,
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:50.080]  and surprisingly, there was still a statue of Abraham Lincoln.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.920]  I'm sure it's only gonna be a matter of time
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:55.040]  before that racist statue is removed as well.

[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:33.200]  because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.200]  that you need each month.

[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:02.240]  When sales become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.280]  No one has put together a formula
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.360]  that focuses directly on brain health,
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.520]  nerve growth factors,
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:10.520]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.680]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ,

[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:27.320]  On her way to work one morning down the path along the lake,
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:35.320]  a tender-hearted woman saw a poor, half-brozen snake.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:39.320]  His pretty-colored skin had been all frosted with a dew.
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:44.320]  Oh well, she cried, I'll take you in and I'll take care of you.
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:48.320]  Take me in, O tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:55.320]  Take me in, O tender woman, side the vicious snake.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:36:00.320]  Take me in, O tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:06.320]  Take me in, O tender woman, side the vicious snake.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:09.320]  Now she clutched him to her bosom.
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:12.320]  You're so beautiful, she cried.
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:17.320]  But if I hadn't brought you in, by now you might have died.
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:23.320]  She stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight.
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:31.320]  But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:37.320]  I saved you, cried the woman, and you've bit me, heaven's why.
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:43.320]  You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:48.320]  Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:55.320]  You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:24.320]  So this is Salvo 1 on a bunch of pro-Trump, pro-reality videos we're about to be putting out.
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:29.320]  Roger Stone joins us now. Roger you're in New York, you're in Florida, you're in California.
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:31.320]  You're all over the place. Where are you today?
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:35.320]  I know you were in New York the last few days in those big important powwows.
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:38.320]  So let's talk about the new order.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:48.320]  Of the Trump campaign that I know you don't like to brag but that you've been seminal in working towards.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:58.320]  And then we're going to get into moving forward the big rally that you and others are organizing for the integrity of the popular vote and so much more.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:09.320]  Well Alex I'm actually in Florida today where the Republican National Committee is meeting in Hollywood, Florida for three days as the run up to the Republican National Convention.
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:14.320]  I am very, very excited about the big win in New York.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:21.320]  I think it was a manifestation of the new focus of the Trump campaign.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:28.320]  But let me be really clear, the changes made to Donald Trump's campaign were made by Donald Trump.
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:31.320]  He's the big picture man and I am merely a supporter.
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:43.320]  As is Paul Manafort, his new convention director and essentially the guy guiding the campaign towards the magic number of 1237.
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:59.320]  This was a big victory in New York and I think it shows a new technology on the part of the Trump people.
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:11.320]  I think they very skillfully overlaid Donald Trump's very effective public appearances and rallies with those congressional districts that were most competitive.
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:21.320]  And they emerged not only with a sweep, but with tricky Ted Cruz running a really poor and I would argue embarrassing third.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:32.320]  So it is interesting to me that as we go forward, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, I see these as Trump country.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:38.320]  These are places where both public and private polls show Donald Trump with strong leads.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:44.320]  And Ted Cruz is now reduced to bragging about South Dakota in Montana.
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:52.320]  And while those are wonderful states, they're small states in the far West, where I frankly think Trump is still competitive.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:58.320]  So I don't see Ted Cruz being competitive in any of the states moving forward.
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:02.320]  California, of course, is the big enchilada.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:15.320]  Now, in all honesty, I can tell you as someone who's experienced in nine Republican presidential campaigns, California is too big to organize on a grassroots basis.
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:20.320]  I love grassroots activity. I'm obviously for it, but I view it as gravy.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:28.320]  This is the ultimate media state and it's a state where celebrity has great importance.
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:35.320]  Donald Trump is, of course, the ultimate celebrity. He has a star quality that no other candidate can match.
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:46.320]  His campaigning, as I think you have seen, Alex, has become more focused and more effective in just days since a leadership change in his campaign.
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:55.320]  So I am more bullish than ever before that he will get 1,237 votes on the first ballot.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:41:16.320]  And before I stop and let you ask a question, let me say I'm also more bullish that we can shed enough light on the corrupted system to stop the steal that the party regulars have in mind in the event that Donald Trump does get 1,237 delegates.
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:22.320]  Now, Roger Stone again joining us via video Skype from Florida crisscrossing the country.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:25.320]  I'm not crying, but I'm dealing with a iPad.
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:33.320]  Sure. We're working on some of his Skype real quick. So taking care of that, we're going to go right back to him here in just a moment.
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:41.320]  Now, going back to Roger Stone. Roger, let me ask you this question. Obviously, you want to talk about Donald Trump, you want to talk about winning, you want to talk about the campaign.
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:52.320]  But so much of it is about the campaign and people want to know now that there has been a lot of leadership change, you know, you're a team player, but just let us know why that leadership is so good.
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:58.320]  Your business partner and others basically more and more heading up the campaign. What is the real structure of the campaign?
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:10.320]  I mean, isn't it just Trump and then he has a group of advisors he talks to and whoever really is the head is the person that he actually listens to the most because I am seeing a lot more sophistication come in.
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:23.320]  That's question number one, Roger. Then number two, and this is obviously even more important, is the Republican Party really warming to him?
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:33.320]  Or do they realize that it's backfiring on them stealing these primaries and so they're going to play possum until they get to Cleveland?
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:42.320]  Well, let me say a couple of things. First of all, unlike these career politicians that were so used to, Donald Trump runs Donald Trump's campaign.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:57.320]  He's his own strategist and he decides the pace of the campaign, the message of the campaign, the campaign stops of the campaign, and those of us who support him really key off of his leadership.
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:07.320]  So this idea that he is scripted or programmed or managed or coached is really inaccurate.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:20.320]  Now, I do think you've seen a new discipline on the candidates part as he begins to focus on wrapping up this nomination and then taking on Hillary Clinton.
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:41.320]  At the same time, and the New York Times noted this on page one, his presentation on primary in New York was very disciplined where he stayed focused on jobs, trade, immigration and terrorism as the big four issues that I think ultimately will sweep him to the White House.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:44:02.320]  I think there is a growing recognition within the Republican Party that Trump will be the ultimate nominee and therefore you have, I think, some number of those in the establishment beginning to recognize that not only is he the likely nominee,
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:18.320]  but he's a more than competitive contender against the very flawed candidacy of Hillary Clinton. You may have noticed on Tuesday night when he referred to her as crooked Hillary.
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:31.320]  What politician would have the Cajones to do that? He's taking her out in front of Lee. He's calling it like it is. He is pointing out to the American people that she is desperately corrupt.
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:39.320]  That's right. None of the other candidates will ever take on the Democrats for their corruption. Trump's willing to do it and that's why he's ahead of her in most polls and gaining.
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:46.320]  That's why so many Democrats are announcing they're switching over to him. So many blacks and others because the truth is people are seeing through this more and more.
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:52.320]  This is amazing. So I want to talk about how they're going to try to stop him because obviously they're still going to try some dirty tricks.
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:45:05.320]  Looking at this and looking at where it's all going back to the campaign. Let me crystallize this then. You're saying Trump is his own man. Everybody knows that he makes pretty much all the big decisions.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:16.320]  He does have advisors to bounce things off of. But now he's got more of a seasoned team that can carry out his wishes and his master plan better.
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:22.320]  He has a more complete support group to be more disciplined. Is that what you're saying?
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:30.320]  Well, and beyond that he has a newer level of competence. Look, Donald Trump sets the pace in his own campaign. He has from the beginning.
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:36.320]  And I think it's what the American people are finding refreshing and interesting about his candidacy.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:49.320]  The fact that he isn't scripted, that he's not reading off a teleprompter, that he's not operating off of polling or sophisticated focus groups that tell him what he needs to say in order to be popular.
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:52.320]  He's operating off his gut, dead reckoning and his own moral compass.
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:46:01.320]  Exactly right. But now when he gives an instruction he has competent people to carry it out. And I think it was demonstrated in the victory.
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:05.320]  So he's the Field Marshal, but he's got some more competent generals.
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:10.320]  That's a fair way to put it. I'm very optimistic, for example, about Pennsylvania.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:17.320]  Now, Pennsylvania has an extremely convoluted delegate selection process.
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:24.320]  It in essence has what amounts to a beauty contest and a delegate contest on the same day.
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:35.320]  Therefore, people who want to vote for Trump delegates need to know who the Trump delegates are because it's not clearly indicated on the ballot.
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:39.320]  That is a massive communications challenge.
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:48.320]  I do think that there is growing sophistication now on the Trump campaign in Pennsylvania.
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:47:03.320]  Jim Schultz, former top assistant to the last Republican governor, David Urban, longtime assistant in the U.S. Senate, two of the most knowledgeable guys in Pennsylvania, people who know the county chairman, people who know the dynamics.
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:12.320]  He's got the experts he needs. So I've seen Fox and CNN now go to the point of saying, okay, it looks like Trump will probably get the 1236, 1237.
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:21.320]  So you predicted everything with almost complete accuracy. It's scary, Roger. Usually folks put some spin on things. I mean, you just put it out so dry, so accurate.
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:29.320]  So inside baseball here, because the troops want to know what do we have to worry about? How will the Empire strike back?
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:40.320]  I'm looking at what some big huge scandals they bring out right before the week before the convention and then say, for conscience, the delegates are going into Trump or something like that.
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:42.320]  What are the dirty tricks you've got to look out for?
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:48:00.320]  Well, you've already seen some of this today in planted stories in Politico making the case that some of those who are volunteers, by the way, in the reordered Trump campaign have worked as lobbyists, some of them as long ago as 20 and 30 years ago.
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:26.320]  Extraneous. They don't run Trump. Trump runs them. And Trump is his own man. And he has no fear of taking on the Republican establishment and challenging the Bush Clinton, Bush Obama orthodoxy when it comes to our fiscal situation, our trade situation, our immigration policy, or our failed interventionist foreign policy.
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:40.320]  But these attacks trying to say that some of those now volunteering for the Trump campaign have worked in the past as lobbyists, this is the kind of disinformation that they're trying to use.
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:50.320]  Sure, he's trying to end the lobbyist system. He's exposing it so they claim he's that. They're also going, now his advisors are going to get him to use a teleprompter in policy.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:58.320]  This shows he scripted, but then they have to admit, but he said, no, I'm not going to use a teleprompter. I mean, they are just spinning everything.
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:06.320]  Yeah, it's mostly extraneous inside baseball. Let's cut to the bottom line. Alex, I'm going to say it again, there will be no second ballot.
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:24.320]  Donald Trump will achieve 1237 votes on the first ballot. It's then, once he has that locked up, but prior to the vote that we have to look for the big deal. And I've outlined on Breitbart and at info wars.com exactly how this will work.
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:38.320]  Either in the rules committee or the credentials committee, the Cruz Bush Romney Cabal will attempt to unseat Trump delegates to undermine his majority.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:46.320]  And then they will seek to stop those delegates from voting on their own fate before the entire convention.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:50:09.320]  When they ratify the big deal. That's why I have been so insistent that it's important that Trump supporters reach their duly elected delegates, particularly their Trump delegates, and ask them to take a voluntary pledge to support Donald Trump on all ballots.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:22.320]  It sheds light on who the rats are. It sheds light on who are the Trojan horses, the Quizlings, the hacks who have been inserted into Trump.
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:32.320]  We've got to investigate the so called Trump delegates because we know they're infiltrating their people and the media acts like that's evil for us to engage in First Amendment activities. That's our civic duty.
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:44.320]  Well, and they try falsely to imply that we've advocated violence against these people. What we've advocated is outing them, exposing them as betraying the democratic...
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:52.320]  That's right. Stay there, Roger Stone. We're coming right back to talk about Ted Cruz. I want to get into that and also want to talk about the rally coming up to defend free speech.
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:58.320]  It's amazing, folks, what's happening. This is an incredible time to be alive. Roger Stone of StonesZone.com is our guest.

[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:53.320]  From the Robert Allen System, current returns, not indicative of future results.
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:54:08.320]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am cutting out the intro music and going right to Roger Stone. We've only got him until five minutes the next hour.
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:17.320]  And the stuff he tells me off air is just incredible. It always comes true. I mean, it's amazing. I cannot tell you how important this guy is right now in this election.
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:27.320]  And in integrity, he has banned on a whole bunch of TV networks, CNN, MSNBC, and he was talking about how he has great Skype, except when he does interviews with me and some other big shows.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:34.320]  And I said, listen, we've had him break in our computers, all of it. And he goes, oh yeah, my wife just, she came in and they were remote accessing in her records.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:41.320]  He could see the person going into her computer. Folks, this, if you don't think they're going into the Trump campaign, you're crazy.
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:47.320]  And to he advisors. So retell that story to the audience, sir. Let's get into Ted Cruz.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:56.320]  Phyllis Schlafly was on yesterday said no that Cruz is using her list. They've confirmed that suddenly Cruz has her list. If that's confirmed, that's a felony.
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:03.320]  I mean, really, Cruz is all the stops are being pulled out. So tell us about your computers and then let's get into the Cruz situation, sir.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:16.320]  Sure. Look, I understand Alex that some on the left are going to say, oh, these conspiracy theorists are they're so paranoid. But the truth is, I have a very heavy duty IT guy works with me.
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:24.320]  There is no question whatsoever that my own computer system and those of others in my family have been penetrated.
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:33.320]  Fortunately, we've been very careful not to put anything terribly confidential there that could be used. But the establishment will pull out all stops.
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:48.320]  Folks like David Brock media matters for America, like his mentors, the Clintons, the law means nothing to them. They will use any means necessary to subvert the democratic process.
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:56:01.320]  I think we know that based on the long history of crimes by the Clintons and their cronies. So I think we have to assume that all our communications are penetrated.
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:17.320]  Doesn't matter. We tell the truth. And I think Ted Cruz attacking me on the networks by name and then particularly CNN, not affording me a fair opportunity to respond.
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:37.320]  That's journalistically unethical. That's journalistic malpractice is the essence of turning polite email to Kerry Pritcher, who is the producer for Anderson Cooper, who was the host of two different programs where Ted Cruz falsely accused me on air.
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:49.320]  I don't even get a polite response. That's the arrogance of the mainstream media bottom line. CNN is not a news organization. It's a left wing advocacy group.
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:57:09.320]  They do not even bow to the niceties of journalistic ethics. They are prepared to do whatever it takes to subvert the nomination process to distort the truth and to try to set the stage for a hijacking of this nomination from Donald Trump.
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:20.320]  Cruz is not a happy camper, though. Even Hannity blew up at him and said, stop saying you're winning grassroots landslides. You've been winning canceled elections. I think this blew up in their face spectacularly.
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:41.320]  Well, particularly that exchange with Sean Hannity the other night, in which Hannity asked him a perfectly appropriate question, which I think is on the minds of Sean's viewers and listeners, and Cruz blew up at him, proving once again that tricky Ted does not have the temperament to be president of the United States.
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:55.320]  This guy is a pathological liar. He lies about me. He lies about the sweetheart secret Wall Street loans from Goldman Sachs that have financed his political ascendancy.
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:58:12.320]  He lies about planting a story at CNN that Dr. Ben Carson was getting out of the race hours before the Iowa caucuses and then contacting a pre identified list of Carson supporters in Iowa.
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:24.320]  Let me ask this as we go to break. We'll come back in five more minutes, sir. Roger Stoner guest on zone.com. Does he have any ideology from your Intel or is he a complete sociopath slash count Dracula psychopath?
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:35.320]  Got to be very, very tough to go through life and not be able to fart without the approval of Jeb, Neil Bush and Mitt Romney. That's got to be very tough on Ted.
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:38.320]  So he's a robot. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:43.320]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCN.com.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:59:09.320]  Back in 70, 70 seconds, more of a stone.
[01:59:09.320 --> 01:59:28.320]  We do the super male and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy. We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:40.320]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source. So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:50.320]  Visit info wars at life.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from info wars life.
[01:59:50.320 --> 02:00:07.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:26.320]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:40.320]  Well, Roger Stone was about to drop bombshells on the cruise campaign and on the Obama operation and his Skype cut out. So he's not here with us. We're trying to call him on the phone so he can finish up.
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:45.320]  We have Dr. Steve Pachennick coming out on the huge 9 11 truth.
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:53.320]  In the next segment, I mean, that is just gonna be a monster interview. So important to the future of humanity.
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:01:13.320]  In fact, did you guys, I forgot to tell you, did you guys pull the articles in the New York Daily News, New York Post headlines, how the US government covered up the Saudis role, and stuff like that, because that's just the beginning of the collapse of their cover up.
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:18.320]  Are we hooking the phone system up or something calling.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:33.320]  Good, he's back. All right. All right, the sky point out but Roger Stone is back with us on phone so rushing through what you were trying to say and then getting into how we stopped the big deal and the rally in Cleveland for free speech and the right of voters.
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:35.320]  Roger Stone.
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:48.320]  So continuing. Look, I think Ted Cruz is an increasingly cornered man. I think he recognized that it's now mathematically impossible for him to be nominated. There will not be a second ballot I say yet again.
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:57.320]  And therefore all these scenarios that the mainstream Republicans and the establishment are trying to lay out are not going to come to pass.
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:13.320]  I'm very excited about the stop the steal rally. If you want details, you can go to stop the steal.org. We are now being cosponsored. We are cosponsors with citizens for Trump, the largest grassroots pro Trump organization in the country.
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:32.320]  So we will walk.com. Some patriots there, longtime supporters of Pat Buchanan, who have built yet another grassroots organization. 45,000 people have now signed a petition saying that if the nomination is stolen from Donald Trump, they will walk.
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:45.320]  Alex, I know you're going to be speaking. I intend to speak. There's an entire headliner group being put together. And again, this is a nonviolent peaceful demonstration.
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:03:01.320]  What we want to show the world are numbers. Patriots coming from all over the country to peacefully demonstrate in favor of the democratic process, in favor of the voters deciding who this nomination should be.
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:12.320]  So there will be a march and a rally with the proper permitting from the city of Cleveland with the cooperation of local law enforcement who we are in touch with.
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:23.320]  Unlike moveon.org, unlike Black Lives Matter, we cooperate with local law enforcement so that we can have a major impact with a peaceful demonstration.
[02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:33.320]  And if my email is any indication, there are thousands of Americans coming to Cleveland. There's going to be tens of thousands. This has to be the biggest thing ever.
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:39.320]  And I'm not attacking Len Beck, but he would make this all about him. He invited me to be an absolutely key part of it. My listeners are a key part.
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:49.320]  But I'm just there as this is all about everybody's free speech in our vote. This is not about Roger Stone. It's not even about Donald Trump at the end of the day. It's about free and open elections in this country.
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:56.320]  Well, and what I'm hoping, and this, of course, would be subject to the secret service and to Donald Trump's security.
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:06.320]  But if we can prove that we are multitudes and that we are peaceful and that we are nonviolent, I'm hoping Donald Trump will decide to come outside the hall of the Dresden.
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:08.320]  That would be the greatest honor yet.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:15.320]  That would be absolutely huge and wonderful. And obviously, Trump supporters are peaceful. We're patriots.
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:20.320]  It's going to be the other side that will try stuff. But the fact is, the police absolutely know the game that's going on.
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:23.320]  And we're going to have the police on the side of free speech.
[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:31.320]  Well, and I think this is the key thing. If your listeners cannot get to Cleveland, then go to StopTheSteal.org.
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:39.320]  Help us pay for buses to get others who can go into town. Help us find inexpensive housing where they can bunk.
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:48.320]  Obviously, the Republican National Committee is in total control of every hotel within a hundred mile radius of Cleveland.
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:54.320]  But we are making progress in finding low income or I should say low cost lodging.
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:58.320]  Hold on, Roger. We're going to break. You probably got to go, but let me talk to you during the break. Stay there.
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:03.320]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com. Sheriff Clark, Hillary's hot sauce comment dehumanizing.
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:05.320]  What's something that you always carry with you?
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:06.320]  Hot sauce.
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:07.320]  Really?
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:08.320]  Yeah.
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:10.320]  Are you getting information right now?
[02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:11.320]  Hot sauce.
[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:13.320]  Hot sauce in my back swag?
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:14.320]  Hot sauce.
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:15.320]  Really?
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:16.320]  Yes.
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:21.320]  Now listen, I just want you to know people are going to see this and say, okay, she's better than the black people.
[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:23.320]  Okay, is it working?
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:25.320]  Article up by Steve Watson.
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:32.320]  Appearing on Fox News' Fox and Friends Wednesday, Clark said Clinton's performance was dehumanizing, adding that it is embarrassing and quite frankly disgusting.
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:36.320]  I'm surprised she didn't just say watermelon. Just go all the way where the Clark added.
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:41.320]  If any other candidate were to say something like that about black people, it would derail their campaign.
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:44.320]  But the rules seem to be different for the Clintons.
[02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:46.320]  And that is something that we continue to see.
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:48.320]  Black people know they're being pandered to, Clark said.
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:51.320]  Nothing has gotten better under Democrat control.
[02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:53.320]  You go to all the cities where there's high poverty.
[02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:55.320]  They're all run by liberal Democrat mayors.
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:06:24.320]  This is Joe Biggs with infowars.com.

[02:06:56.320 --> 02:07:21.320]  More than two years ago, infowars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy and told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:28.320]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:41.320]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.320]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:52.320]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[02:07:52.320 --> 02:08:21.320]  For more information, visit infowarsteam.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:27.320]  Welcome, my friends, welcome to the third hour worldwide broadcast.
[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:43.320]  It's actually going to be David Knight hosting the fourth hour, and he's going to be interviewing Larry Nichols about the secret Federal Reserve meeting where his intel shows they were discussing economic collapse, basically martial law.
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:53.320]  And we have some mainstream headlines with government gearing up for civil unrest, trying to claim it's over Donald Trump.
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:09:06.320]  But basically using the whole Black Lives Matter, civil unrest, Ford Foundation, strategy of tension, great game system, using that as a cover when they're going to be really imploding the economy.
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:09.320]  Or the signs of the economies imploding will be that much clearer.
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:22.320]  Now, for the balance of the hour, Dr. Steve Pachennick joins us, and he's been a guest on the show probably 80, 90 times over the last 14 years.
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:26.320]  He came on about six, seven months after 9-11.
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:41.320]  Because I read an article where he was quoted talking about the fact that criminal elements of our government working with Saudi Arabia and others carried out a false flag attack on 9-11.
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:42.320]  Now, I knew that.
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:44.320]  I saw the preparation of the media for it.
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:46.320]  I saw the scripting that day.
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:49.320]  I saw building sevens and the bombs in the building.
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:52.320]  I had whistleblowers on about the NORAD stand down.
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:56.320]  And then years later, all this stuff came out.
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:03.320]  Now, I'm not up here to talk about getting credit for this just so Steve Pachennick and I get the credit for it.
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:10.320]  It's like getting the credit for tying yourself down, you know, at the railroad tracks when a train's coming.
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:15.320]  But we have to historically talk about it so that other people can learn from it.
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:22.320]  And so the Liberty Lovers out there who are the tip of the spear, you're the foot soldiers that got this information out through the grassroots.
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:25.320]  So you understand the power you have.
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:30.320]  In a war, major battles we've won that could win the war.
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:34.320]  We now are beginning to turn the tide and win the war against the crony capitalists and the insiders.
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:35.320]  A very nasty crew.
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:39.320]  Doesn't mean some utopias at the end of the rainbow and everything's gonna be fine.
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:49.320]  But for generations, tyrants and people using different systems of deception are going to have a big problem going forward.
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:11:02.320]  Because when the quote conspiracy collapses, when it's known we were all lied to, when it's known the tactics they used were deployed against the people.
[02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:09.320]  Fourth, fifth generation warfare psychological systems, knowing is the battle.
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:17.320]  And they won't be able to sit there and ridicule and call someone a conspiracy theorist that questions basic integrity in the government.
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:18.320]  There's a loss of confidence.
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:22.320]  Mainstream media has a 6% trust rate in Gallup.
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:24.320]  Congress has a 9%.
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:29.320]  That's worse than Chalcescu and Romania.
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:32.320]  I mean, in dictatorships, you get 20, 30% not liking it.
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:35.320]  It's gonna end up falling or being overthrown.
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:38.320]  Historically.
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:42.320]  So they're in a desperate position, a desperate situation.
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:50.320]  And it's an oligarchy, a bunch of bureaucrats and a bunch of corporate connections and a bunch of combines, basically hiding who's in charge.
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:12:00.320]  But once people realize there's a shadow government of multinational interest that weren't just feather in their nest or giving themselves first whack at the trough,
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:05.320]  but who wanted to end free market itself to consolidate control.
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:08.320]  Pull up the ladder from everybody else.
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:14.320]  When the public learns about this, which they're starting to do, it is seismic, it will be generational.
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:31.320]  And we will see a new enlightenment, a new renaissance of lower taxes, of people being involved, of the population electing good people that really want to serve and who are really on the team.
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:39.320]  Because historically, you go through something this bad, and it then comes out later, really good things come of it.
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:55.320]  If this dictatorship globally doesn't collapse before another group gets in and takes over and basically exposes some of what's happened, but not all of it.
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:13:00.320]  We could have this turned not into a restoration, but a revolution.
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:13.320]  That'll just be randomly targeted that the foundations have tailored to be a leftist, moron, social justice warrior, anti free speech, race based bloodbath.
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:20.320]  So they've got their competing revolution against our renaissance revolution of restoration.
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:33.320]  1776 squared. 1776 to the power of 10. 1776 next level.
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:36.320]  The renaissance never ended. It just got sabotaged at a few points.
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:42.320]  And the future is here. It's not just been evenly distributed. It's been hoarded and hidden.
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:45.320]  And this is a revolution against that.
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:55.320]  And the reason I'm prefacing this, I'm going to go to Dr. Pachennick is he always wants to thank me and thank the audience and talk about how historical it is and how it's devastated to them and how this will end up bringing them down.
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:14:01.320]  And I know he believes that. I know he's taken down a bunch of dictatorships and corrupt governments and I mean, don't you name it.
[02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:06.320]  He's got to be careful about what he talks about because the Justice Department, you know, shows up and subpoenas him when he does.
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:19.320]  And this is serious stuff, folks. He's the guy that the Jack Ryan characters based on wrote a bunch of the books with Tom Clancy as his advisor, top psychological warfare expert for the State Department, top hostage negotiator.
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:27.320]  You know, the guy that was the person that oversaw the Camp David Accords with the only successful peace deliverer in the Middle East.
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:34.320]  I mean, so he's a big wig. Obviously, as I pointed out, the average young person doesn't know who Chuck Yeager is or Chuck Norris for that matter at the time.
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:40.320]  So he's one of those quiet professionals, but he doesn't want your thanks either.
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:44.320]  He just wants to let you know how important you are and how historical this fight is.
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:55.320]  But in the interest of history, and I'm going to go to him in here in 60 seconds, we all have to realize how big this is, how dangerous this is and how the future battle space is being affected.
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:59.320]  And then we all have to be involved in maximum effort right now with the truth.
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:03.320]  So this collapse doesn't come and then they inject more control as the answer.
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:09.320]  People have to know who the authors of this are, who the men and women are in the smoking rooms and what they did.
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:13.320]  And the fact, what am I speaking of? I always get to it at the end, not the first.
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:19.320]  9-11 fraud is imploding. It's much bigger than the Saudis, obviously.
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:24.320]  But everything we told you 15 years ago, 14 years ago has been vetted. It's been confirmed.
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:27.320]  It's not just like we had a wild guest. We knew.
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:34.320]  Because of great whistleblowers in the military and in these different agencies and in the grassroots, many of which got killed.
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:36.320]  I've interviewed a lot of people who got killed.
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:41.320]  Now, I'm out in the sunshine, like Jim Garrison said, so I haven't been killed, but I've been attacked.
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:45.320]  My credibility has been assassinated. I've had black ops run against my family.
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:47.320]  They'll go after folks they think they can affect.
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:49.320]  And let me tell you, it's been out of a movie.
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:53.320]  I'm not whining about it. It's what I expect even more, quite frankly.
[02:15:53.320 --> 02:16:02.320]  But you have to know that the answer is so many of us taking action against tyranny that they just are overwhelmed.
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:07.320]  And that's already happening. And the 9-11 veil is falling. Other veils are falling.
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:10.320]  The fact that the stock market's rigged is falling. It's all happening.
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:13.320]  The political class is already giving up. They're already running.
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:18.320]  They're already running to armored redoubts. They're already going to New Zealand and Switzerland and Monte Carlo.
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:21.320]  They're already getting plastic surgery and changing their names. They're already in an exodus.
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:25.320]  They already think the Death Star is going to blow up. They've just already evacuated.
[02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:29.320]  Just so you know, it's like in a battle, the generals have already left the hill and are running.
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:33.320]  The real generals that run it. They've still got their figureheads up there.
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:37.320]  And the armies, though, are going, is anybody leading us? This isn't working. This isn't making sense.
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:43.320]  We are hitting a mass sea change. And you can't just put it back away with new front people
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:48.320]  because it's an understanding in the people of how stuff really works. The facade is falling.
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:52.320]  Now, I don't like being the presenter of 9-11 Truth, the father of it.
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:57.320]  I don't like being the guy 9 times out of 10 on the very tip of the spear just because I understand the paradigm.
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:01.320]  I want everybody else to understand the paradigm, understand the real blueprint,
[02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:07.320]  so that then I don't have a near monopoly on this and it's not so dangerous.
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:11.320]  But it's not just that I don't want to get killed. I'm willing to. I'll do whatever it takes.
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:15.320]  But I'm not stupid. I want to be here for my kids.
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:19.320]  A part of me is, you know, fatalistic. Everything kind of gets into it. I mean, I'll just be honest.
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:23.320]  You can't do that and not be a man.
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:29.320]  But once this understanding, this master key is out in the public's mind, it's over, folks.
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:35.320]  And we're reaching that critical mass. It's dangerous to be a Steve Pachettic or an Alex Jones or a Matt Drudge.
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:39.320]  Like Mark Twain said, in the beginning a Patriarch scarce man hated, feared, and scorn.
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:43.320]  Because when his cause succeeds, the timid joined him because then it causes him to be a patriot.
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:46.320]  We're reaching the point where it costs stuff to be a patriot.
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:51.320]  Okay. And we can win this thing for real.
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:54.320]  Donald Trump is just a manifestation of that. He's not perfect.
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:58.320]  This is just the beginning. Our strength is only intensifying.
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:01.320]  And our strength is all of us together.
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:03.320]  We have reached a critical mass point.
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:06.320]  I'm going to skip this network break because I don't want to cut into Pachettic's time too much.
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:08.320]  And I want to be able to really go over what's happening.
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:14.320]  But a few times ago he was on, he described this show as a focal point or a catalyst,
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:19.320]  like rock and roll coming out of the South or out of Louisiana or out of places like Texas.
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:24.320]  Because it wasn't perfect. It had problems, but it was sincere. It was real. It was human.
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:30.320]  And that's why I've been successful. I've been teleprompter-free, stuttering, interrupting, all of it.
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:34.320]  But the information was a true quest for the truth.
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:38.320]  And that's why the truth does live here at InfoWars.
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:42.320]  It doesn't mean we always get it right, but our soul wants the truth.
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:46.320]  And we want justice. We want prosperity. We want to make America free and great again.
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:50.320]  We want to have a society of open association and free association.
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:54.320]  We don't want political correctness banning the word mother and father.
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:57.320]  We've fallen so far that now we can see we've fallen.
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:01.320]  And that's the beginning of climbing out of this mess and it's already begun.
[02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:06.320]  But the fact that 9-11 Truth has been vindicated, that Steve Pacinac has been vindicated,
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:11.320]  that all of us, the whistleblowers who are much bigger heroes than I, and even you, the listeners,
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:16.320]  but all of us that got ridiculed, the rest of it, the stations I lost, the money we lost, whatever.
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:21.320]  I will not sell my passion for glory ever. I could care less.
[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:27.320]  It's the truth that matters. It's the most valuable possession. And it's what creates good civilization.
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:33.320]  And that's all I can give my kids is the truth, nothing more. So Steve, I don't normally do a 10-minute intro to you,
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:39.320]  but I mean, this is a big time. I mean, this is huge when mainstream newspapers have the headline,
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:42.320]  how the U.S. government covered up the Saudi Arabian role.
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:46.320]  We know the 28 pages show the stand down in the congressional report,
[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:49.320]  and we know the military knows what really went on.
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:55.320]  And I know you've talked on air and I think it's been lost because you're dropping such bombshells about CFR meetings you've been in,
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:20:00.320]  meetings with generals where it just gets right down to everybody knows it's inside job and everybody knows who did it.
[02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:07.320]  And there's discussions about what went on and some people say, well, we did it, you know, to expose the radical Muslim threat.
[02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:11.320]  Oh, really? So you could double-cross us and then bring them in and overtake Europe with them?
[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:16.320]  I mean, this is so sophisticated what they've done and hopefully as a top spy master,
[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:24.320]  you know, one of the most famous out there, not known, you know, in your real person, but best known in movies and the rest of it,
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:32.320]  have I accurately crystallized this? And have we reached a point where it's a lot safer for people like you and I that helped punch the detonator
[02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:39.320]  that is now, many years later, brought down the 9-11 fraud and what does that domino falling?
[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:44.320]  Because even if the Saudis are successful, blocking the release, they've convicted themselves, that's even better.
[02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:54.320]  Dr. Peschenik. Well, it's been a great honor and a pleasure, but the truth of the matter is we do owe it to you, Alex,
[02:20:54.320 --> 02:21:02.320]  and I certainly owe it to the American public that's been listening to the alternative media since, you know, God knows when 2001,
[02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:08.320]  and you all have done a phenomenal job. It's not about me and it's not about Alex.
[02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:15.320]  It's about a lot more people and believe it or not, it's the people within the intelligence community and the military.
[02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:22.320]  I can't tell you how many times I'm stopped by individuals who recognize my voice, not necessarily my name,
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:29.320]  who work within the system and are grateful for what we have done because the civilians who were involved,
[02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:40.320]  Bush, Cheney, Rumpfel, Condoleezza, Steve Hadley, Hillary Clinton, the Wolfowitz, the Neocons, the Neocon Jews, Israel, Dubai,
[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:46.320]  Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, will all be implicated in what's happened in 9-11.
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:50.320]  But what eventually arose from all of this was several factors.
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:22:00.320]  One was the emergence of a very unique individual who no one could have predicted. I did not predict that a Trump would arise at a moment
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:07.320]  when our history required a self-made American entrepreneur, an American-made entrepreneur.
[02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:16.320]  Not somebody who depended on the kindness of strangers, but somebody who was able to take whatever assets he had and built it into a fortune,
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:22.320]  which he then dedicated to creating something better for others, namely America.
[02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:28.320]  He doesn't need the power, he doesn't need the money, he doesn't need the accolades of any of these Republicans.
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:34.320]  That's why we are now in the crux of the revolution, as Alex just said.
[02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:43.320]  You have all deserved this moment, but we can't stop because the Republican Party has now become the face of the enemy.
[02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:53.320]  The prebuses, the Mitt Romney's, the Jeff Bushes, the Neil Bushes, the Marvin Bushes, the Paul Singers, the Ricketts family,
[02:22:53.320 --> 02:23:02.320]  the Hubbard family, all those families who never served our country, but who were able to take and extract our slave labor
[02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:06.320]  and our monies in order to aggrandize their fortunes.
[02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:11.320]  Now, the irony is many of these companies, particularly the Koch brothers,
[02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:16.320]  his father made his fortune, not in America, but under Stalin.
[02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:22.320]  So I usually call the Koch brothers, who graduated where I did at MIT, the Red Babies,
[02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:26.320]  because the real fortunes were not made in the American oil fields.
[02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:34.320]  They were made under Stalin in the Soviet oil fields, and they were ashamed to talk about that because they had died for babies.
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:44.320]  Unlike us right now, we're in the midst of a revolution where Trump is the spear and the cutting edge to cut into what's called the rules of the party.
[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:52.320]  The rules of the Republican Party are no more rules than fictitious rules that we have in any other institution of fascism.
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:59.320]  I saw those rules in the Soviet Union, and the more rules they imposed on me when I worked in the Soviet Union,
[02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:05.320]  the easier it was for me and others in the intelligence community to take the Soviet Union apart.
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:11.320]  So the Credentialist Committee that's run by men like Sununu who worked with George Bush Sr.
[02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:18.320]  and were also able to alter the election machines because they were MIT software engineers
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:22.320]  and who were also corrupt in New Hampshire as a governor.
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:33.320]  These men are trying to reinstate their political legitimacy in a time when a man like Trump who's backed by the American people,
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:38.320]  independents, Democrats, Republicans, is saying enough is enough.
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:45.320]  The will of the people has to be expressed by one man, one vote, not one delegate and no vote.
[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:52.320]  Dr. Pachennick, I want you to have the floor pretty much for the whole hour. I did my long, timid intro, and I relate this to Nico.
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:55.320]  I mean, I've been relayed to you. They do a great job. It's overwhelming.
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:58.320]  I know you don't like to talk about yourself or the other whistleblowers.
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:02.320]  You were basically up in the government, the CFR and high level. You were a whistleblower.
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:07.320]  You didn't call it that when you came out. I know they came after you. They threatened you. I remember what happened in 2002.
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:14.320]  A lot of people got killed. So people need to understand the risk here and what members of the intelligence community and others told Congress.
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:20.320]  So I want to get into the election and the current battle. But so folks know the power that the people have.
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:27.320]  We come from nowhere 15 years ago exposing this. Look at it today and you can follow those roots up to now.
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:35.320]  And as time compresses, more and more of their lives are imploding faster, not in 15 years, but in six months.
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:41.320]  So I want to spend a few months before we go to break and we'll come back into the election and how historical all this is and what you see into the future.
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:49.320]  And as a guy that would overthrow dictatorships and corrupt regimes, what you think we should do and what you think the establishment is going to pull.
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:57.320]  But first, specifically on 9-11, I mean, you've talked about being in there with the generals and CFR people where they pretty much just admit, yeah, it's inside job.
[02:25:57.320 --> 02:26:03.320]  And then you have debates with them. We have the Rumsfeld tape where he's with the generals. They say, sir, we need another attack.
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:06.320]  We sure need it. And he goes, yeah, we kind of do need another one, don't we?
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:11.320]  I mean, how many people in the ruling establishment know what really happened?
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:16.320]  Where do you expect this to go in a few minutes on from your best intel exactly what happened on 9-11?
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:23.320]  Well, what actually happened on 9-11, even before 9-11, I wasn't just a whistleblower.
[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:31.320]  I was literally the opposition that existed within the group who helped Bush Jr. get into power.
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:37.320]  On one of the conditions I said is that there should be no acts against this country.
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:44.320]  And I could smell it because Bush, who's pretty dumb, and so is his entourage, was talking about peace overseas.
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:53.320]  Yet the people he put in were neocons who had never served our country, who already were creating the American initiative in the Middle East.
[02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:57.320]  People like Zalme Halazad, Paul Wolfer, and others.
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:07.320]  So within a year before the time when he came to power, as I was asked to come into the Pentagon, to the office of low-intensity conflict,
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:14.320]  I began to see the CIA civilians totally take over the Pentagon.
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:20.320]  It was an amazing feat. And I went to one of the senior officials who was a civilian, as well as another general,
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:27.320]  and said, you are now being infiltrated by the CIA. You are going to be involved in some kind of dirty trick,
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:30.320]  which I suspect will be a stand-down and a false flag.
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:34.320]  I could see the pre-programming just interrupt. They were on the news going, we're going to be attacked.
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:36.320]  When we're attacked, we're going to take care of rights.
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:38.320]  I saw the Hart-Rubin Commission a year before say that.
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:42.320]  I saw the PNAC document about a Pearl Harbor event so they could take over.
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:46.320]  I mean, they were, you saw the telegraphing, but from the inside. Please continue.
[02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:53.320]  So, it was clear to me who would be involved. It would be Paul Wolfowitz. It would be Walter Yeko.
[02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:58.320]  It would be Zalming Hollisot. All of these people whom I'd worked with, Richard Pearl,
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:05.320]  Doug Zugheim, who's a rabbi I didn't know, but I didn't like Elliot Abrams, who I almost killed in another iteration.
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:09.320]  He knew I was going after him. I'm not a Panama thing.
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:18.320]  And when it occurred, I knew immediately that this was a stand-down false flag because Israeli operatives immediately
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:24.320]  called me up and said the planes had attacked the towers and they were collapsing.
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:31.320]  And I said, there is no precedence in the history of any building where a plane has crashed and collapsed the building.
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:37.320]  And immediately they said, within minutes of the time, I said, this is a false flag or you must be an Arabist.
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:44.320]  And I said, now I know who's involved. So, it was Israel. I knew the Pakistani senior intelligence officer was coming here
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:52.320]  because I was forewarned by one of his predecessors, Yahub Khan, that the Pakistani generals were involved in a potential coup.
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:29:00.320]  I was forewarned that the Saudis would be involved. I knew that the Israelis would be involved because they had people like
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:07.320]  Michael Chertoff, who should have been indicted because he has double citizenship here and in Israel,
[02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:15.320]  and was in charge of Homeland Security along with Richard Perl and others who, with loyalty, have never been to the United States.
[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:21.320]  Unfortunately, these American Jews, whose loyalty is to Israel, have never served the American government,
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:31.320]  never been in the American military, but are more than happy to serve the Israeli military, as Zab Daghima has done, as Rami Emanuel,
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:35.320]  and as the whole family, both on the Republican and Democratic side.
[02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:41.320]  Sure. Steve Pachennick, we've got to go to break. StevePachennick.com. Folks, you're hearing it from somebody inside the system.
[02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:45.320]  He's going to tell you, okay, and just let the chips fall where they may because it's all going to come out anyways.
[02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:47.320]  Just get ready, stay with us.
[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:55.320]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:26.320]  The face of the currency itself and the central bankers who control the front anyway have imposed a symbolic defeat against the leaders in America's past
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:29.320]  who have fought against the stranglehold of the money makers.
[02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:33.320]  Naturally, there are liberal politics at play fighting for every inch of ground in the war.
[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:48.320]  For more on the war, on the war, on the war, on the war, on the war, on the war.
[02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:49.320]  We were just at the Portland State University, and surprisingly, there was still a statue of Abraham Lincoln.
[02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:53.320]  I'm sure it's only going to be a matter of time before that race of statue is removed as well.
[02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:58.320]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.
[02:30:58.320 --> 02:31:00.320]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say,

[02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:05.320]  Prostagart, Silver Bullet.

[02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:09.320]  They work by info.
[02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:10.320]  Thank you, brother.
[02:31:10.320 --> 02:31:11.320]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:14.320]  I am a relatively short-time listener
[02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:17.320]  and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[02:31:17.320 --> 02:31:19.320]  Welcome to the InfoWar.

[02:31:26.320 --> 02:31:28.320]  all the nutraceuticals, CasioFX,
[02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:29.320]  Nacin...
[02:31:29.320 --> 02:31:30.320]  Right, God, let me ask you a question.
[02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:31.320]  Have they worked for you?
[02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:33.320]  They're the most unbelievable products
[02:31:33.320 --> 02:31:34.320]  I've ever had in my life.
[02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:35.320]  What products are you taking?
[02:31:35.320 --> 02:31:39.320]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce
[02:31:39.320 --> 02:31:41.320]  to Wintersun, X2,
[02:31:41.320 --> 02:31:43.320]  even got a little DNA force.
[02:31:43.320 --> 02:31:44.320]  Nice.
[02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:45.320]  So, and I just free up everything

[02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:36.320]  If you are receiving this transmission
[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:41.320]  live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:43.320]  you are the Resistance.
[02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:48.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:50.320]  Lock up your life and children now.
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:52.320]  It's time to wheel the blade
[02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:54.320]  because now you've got some company.
[02:33:54.320 --> 02:33:59.320]  Horsemen are drawing nearer.
[02:33:59.320 --> 02:34:10.320]  The sound of hooves knock at your door.
[02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:13.320]  Horsemen are drawing nearer.
[02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:16.320]  And when you run the trouble, they get closer.
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:18.320]  And you run towards them, they get further away.
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:23.320]  A little secret about freedom and about life.
[02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:26.320]  As a civilization, it's true, not so much for individuals.
[02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:32.320]  That's a choice men have to make.
[02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:35.320]  Now, I'm going to go back to Dr. Pachennik here in a moment
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:37.320]  and I knew he was specifically going to Israel
[02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:42.320]  in its connection to 9-11.
[02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:47.320]  It comes down to this.
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:51.320]  There is a large block of people that blame Israel
[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:53.320]  if a banana peel is on the ground
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:56.320]  and they step on it and fall down.
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:34:59.320]  There's also another group of people that think that
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:03.320]  whatever the politicians do in Israel is perfectly fine
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:06.320]  because that's where the end of the world is going to happen
[02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:09.320]  and it's like breaking a mirror.
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:11.320]  If you say anything wrong about anybody in Israel,
[02:35:11.320 --> 02:35:13.320]  you're going to go to hell.
[02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:15.320]  And that's just as stupid.
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:17.320]  And I've tried to really stay out of all of it.
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:19.320]  Israel is run by different political factions.
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:23.320]  It does all the same stuff other corrupt governments do.
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:26.320]  Israel openly has backed ISIS for the first four years
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:28.320]  in Al-Qaeda along with our government in the French
[02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:30.320]  and the Turks and everybody else.
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:32.320]  People say, and then the white supremacists say,
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:34.320]  oh, look, you're defending Israel, saying other people do it too.
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:37.320]  No, I'm just not mentally ill like you.
[02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:39.320]  I don't just mindlessly hate Israel.
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:41.320]  I can actually find it on a map.
[02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:43.320]  I actually know a lot of the history.
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:45.320]  I know what went on in Russia.
[02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:47.320]  I knew that Stalin wanted to make a new Israel
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:50.320]  in the south-east of it.
[02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:53.320]  I know about the Rothschilds and the British-Israelism
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:57.320]  that's basically turned into Protestant religion today.
[02:35:57.320 --> 02:36:00.320]  I've done my research and I know where Steve Pochenik comes from
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:03.320]  in Russia and then trying to get out through Nazi Germany
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:06.320]  and his family really being killed by the Nazis.
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:08.320]  And then Pochenik's mad.
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:11.320]  He's told the story about how the rich Jews
[02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:14.320]  wanted money to let middle-class Jews out.
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:17.320]  And that's in best-selling books written by Jews.
[02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:19.320]  I mean, it's a fact.
[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:21.320]  That's why FDR and others wouldn't let the Jews come in.
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:23.320]  He said, you keep your ships right there.
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:25.320]  They didn't pay up.
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:27.320]  Didn't pay up to Herr Hitler.
[02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:29.320]  So it's far worse than everyone knows.
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:32.320]  And look, my grandfather wasn't Jewish, but he's German.
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:35.320]  He lived in a German community in Dallas, wealthy Germans,
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:40.320]  the guy that invented refrigeration and freezers.
[02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:42.320]  He had a big workstation.
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:45.320]  My grandfather loved him. He worked in his shop.
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:48.320]  My grandfather became an inventor because of his experience
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:50.320]  from the time he was six years old going down the street
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:52.320]  at the inventor's laboratory.
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:55.320]  And my grandfather hated the Nazis and went and joined
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:37:01.320]  the Army Air Corps because he saw the Nazis quietly
[02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:04.320]  from 1935 or so up till the start of the war.
[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:06.320]  Suck everything out of that guy.
[02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:08.320]  Billions of dollars in today's numbers
[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:11.320]  because he had family in Germany and he was German.
[02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:14.320]  They were threatened to kill.
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:16.320]  So that's why I hate all these white supremacists on their sites
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:19.320]  about how great Hitler was and what a hero and how great he was
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:21.320]  and all this crap.
[02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:23.320]  Let's just say you hate Jews and want to kill them all.
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:26.320]  Hitler robbed and murdered millions of Germans
[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:28.320]  and everybody else.
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:31.320]  Hitler was a criminal with a bunch of criminals under him.
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:35.320]  But because Hitler's bad, it doesn't mean everything Jews do
[02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:37.320]  or Israel does is perfect.
[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:42.320]  Like rich Jewish organizations not letting Jews out
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:44.320]  and making a deal with the Nazis.
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:46.320]  This is on record, by the way.
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:49.320]  This is in bestselling books when Pulitzer Prizes.
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:51.320]  It's just not popularly known.
[02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:54.320]  Making deals that only Jews could immigrate there
[02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:57.320]  and had to pay upwards of a million dollars.
[02:37:57.320 --> 02:38:00.320]  So that's why Pachennik will go all the way
[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:02.320]  and talk about the neocons.
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:04.320]  Do people like Richard Pearl really represent Jews?
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:06.320]  Is that who Jews want representing them?
[02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:08.320]  There's a lot of wonderful Jews out there.
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:10.320]  And that's where I stand.
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:12.320]  I love some of the best people I know are great,
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:14.320]  super smart, amazing.
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:16.320]  Give me the shirt off, they're back Jews.
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:18.320]  And then I see powerful neocons and others.
[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:20.320]  And I'm not saying the world conspiracies run by Jews either.
[02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:24.320]  But there are corrupt Jewish organized crime guilds
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:27.320]  that have been so successful they've transcended organized crime.
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:29.320]  That's who founded the ADL was organized,
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:31.320]  was set up by Jewish organized crime.
[02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:33.320]  That's on record, 1913.
[02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:35.320]  And I'm going to give them the rest of the floor to talk about this
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:37.320]  because I made a film
[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:39.320]  called Fabled Enemies
[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:41.320]  about the Israeli connection.
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:44.320]  And that made the white supremacist attack me even more
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:47.320]  because it wasn't an anti-Semitic film.
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:49.320]  And because they're controlled and run from the top
[02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:51.320]  by the globalist to control the dialectic.
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:53.320]  And it's come out.
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:55.320]  Almost every major white supremacist leader is controlled.
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:58.320]  That's the Brzezinski model he writes about in the technotronic era,
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:00.320]  controlling all the major factions.
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:02.320]  Well, I'm a faction that's not controlled.
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:05.320]  I want everybody's kids to be able to go to space if they want.
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:07.320]  I want life extension technology.
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:11.320]  I want a society based on renaissance and free ideas and not scams.
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:13.320]  I want a society based on chivalry
[02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:17.320]  and nationalism
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:20.320]  and on the family and on manhood
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:22.320]  and the incredible feminine energy.
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:25.320]  I'm a pro-human guy. I'm a real philanthropist.
[02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:27.320]  That's what it means, somebody that loves humanity.
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:29.320]  And it's not because I'm some goody tissue.
[02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:31.320]  I come from this. I'm a human.
[02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:33.320]  I want empathy.
[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:35.320]  I mean, I might sound the toughest guy around,
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:37.320]  but look at what I've done with my attitude politically,
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:39.320]  and that's what I was celebrating today.
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:42.320]  Saying everybody else should emulate it and take it to the next level.
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:44.320]  The courage of the whistleblowers and others.
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:46.320]  I'd see bullies when I was 12 years old.
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:48.320]  16, 17 year old bullies beating up some kid,
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:52.320]  I'd go over there and say and try to stop them.
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:55.320]  And I got my teeth loosened and knocked out, my nose broken,
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:57.320]  but you know what? I got stronger in the process.
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:39:59.320]  And it wasn't because I wanted to fight.
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:03.560]  I saw people ganging up on some 10 year old or 11 year old robbing them
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:10.000]  I was gonna go fight people that were basically men because I had the instinct and the genetics from my forebearers
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:13.800]  To want to attack people that are criminal
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:17.120]  And that's the only instinct I've got basically folks
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:22.280]  I it makes me sick and I've done everything I can to learn how they operate to learn what they do to try to stop them
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:25.480]  And I've done it in a stumbling, toddling way for 21 years
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:29.360]  But just that pathetic resistance has hurt the enemy badly
[02:40:29.680 --> 02:40:35.880]  You are the power of this broadcast when you spread the word about it when you send out the podcast on the videos when you buy the products and
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:41.600]  So God bless you on a thank you, but understand you're just as important as I am or pochetic or the whistleblowers
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:44.440]  And you have to become radio hosts and TV hosts and leaders and
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:49.800]  You have to take action and you have to understand what's happening and you have to see what's going on
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:54.000]  But yes, every major Western country heavily involved in 9-11
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.560]  They're not gonna have a 9-11 and not include
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:02.040]  Criminal elements of these intelligence agencies because then the other agency could blow the whistle on them
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:06.880]  That's why they included as many as 10 nations Pakistan Turkey Israel
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:12.080]  So Bell Edmond said they were all in on it running guns funding al Qaeda white slavery all the stuff
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:20.040]  You see ISIS doing it was already going on and then Dr. Pachennik is against war against he recognizes radical Muslims being funded
[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:25.720]  He's against that, but he doesn't want to destabilize the whole region and just demonize Muslims. So then they say, oh, he's a bad guy
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:28.960]  Now now I've put it in my words. We've got 10 minutes the next break
[02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:33.880]  I'm trying to give you the floor to finish up with 9-11 to go through what happened and then get into the election and the
[02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:38.640]  Crossroads we've hit and if I misspoke on your history or your view that you've
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:46.400]  Related to me privately on air before about your experience, you know as as someone that has been at every level
[02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:54.160]  From from Russia to Cuba to the United States MIT special secret operations in the field all the secret stuff
[02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:56.160]  You've done overthrowing governments. I
[02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:02.040]  Don't think of any other spy or spy master in in in reality. It's probably done more than you have
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:05.240]  I know there's a lot of folks that have probably done more. They're just so secret if we don't know about it
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:10.240]  But Dr. Pachennik I mean you're uniquely able to speak to this and so I know I'm running on about this
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:15.440]  I just want listeners to understand the epicness that we're all involved in them included
[02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:20.160]  This is a real war. This is 21st century warfare the attempted take down of the West
[02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:26.200]  Because the elite is so threatened by renaissance. How do we stop it? What happened on 9-11 and and yes
[02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:28.600]  What is the Israeli connection and where do you see this going forward?
[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:35.800]  Well, let me just say go on to say a lot of what's happened is that our
[02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:44.600]  Internal military system our internal intelligence those in the White House and other places have been very effective in
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:52.720]  in political warfare economic warfare and turning the entire geopolitical area away from
[02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:55.200]  Saudi Arabia which was our major
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:02.640]  Creator of ISIS al Qaeda and all the Sunni terrorist groups at the inspiration of the CIA
[02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:05.440]  However, there are elements of the CIA that fought it
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:11.560]  No institution that we have is monolithic. No institution is all bad or all great
[02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:15.760]  Within our intelligence system and the and I've worked extensively
[02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:22.640]  I have the good the bad and the ugly and very often I'm working against my own people with other sorts of people
[02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:28.160]  So I've had generals and I won't name who they are who worked with me in order to explain
[02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:32.280]  to people like Rumsfeld that if you continue to remain here and
[02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:39.760]  Sacrify 75,000 of our soldiers in a war that was from the very beginning poorly planned out
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:45.040]  It had no a success capability and was planned out by
[02:43:45.720 --> 02:43:52.240]  Neocons like Wolfowitz and others who had no experience in war. We will overthrow you
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:44:00.200]  When that happened on that day, I wasn't formed by Jeb Bush and his people that I was brought up on charges of treason
[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:02.360]  I won't tell you which generals worked with me
[02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:09.560]  But it had it not been for those generals and the people within the core of our military and our intelligence community
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:14.520]  You would not have gotten rid of Rumsfeld a disastrous individual
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:18.920]  I may have to go into the next hour. Yes, sir. Just so people understand
[02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:22.720]  I remember over the years you hinting at this you getting at it and then what you said four years ago
[02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:26.240]  And then it came out that Dempsey did go and say we're not gonna bomb Syria
[02:44:26.240 --> 02:44:32.480]  There's basically been a counter coup the media hasn't reported it and finally Cy Hirsch did this is so epic
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:35.400]  That's what I'm saying. You've got all the secrets. They're dangerous for you
[02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:42.080]  No, I want to say to you the generals that I can't talk about are generals like Jerry Boykin special forces
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:48.080]  General Schumacher head of special forces. These weren't men who worked against our government
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:54.440]  They're the men and heroes who work with the American people Keith Alexander. I mean, there's a whole group of them
[02:44:54.440 --> 02:45:01.080]  Even David Petraeus when we put him into the CIA to control it all these men and Michael Flynn
[02:45:01.320 --> 02:45:07.480]  All these men were dedicated to the American people knowing fully well that we could no longer have
[02:45:07.760 --> 02:45:14.800]  Civilians who had no military experience had no war experience despite whatever they were in background religion
[02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:16.000]  It really didn't matter
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:22.240]  But mattered was that they wanted to go to war without the notion that our military was
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:29.240]  Ended with our military was not willing or capable of fighting a war that was limited in size
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:36.800]  75,000 as opposed to what Shinseki had ordered a quarter of a million and our military was overturned by
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:43.360]  incompetent civilians that changed and then they've had a major culling of the general so
[02:45:43.360 --> 02:45:46.720]  So what's the real battle space now culling of the generals is we've had now
[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:53.080]  That's going to continue until we get to the captain and the 04 level 05 level
[02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:55.080]  So you're saying that's actually a good thing
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:45:56.000]  Not well
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:01.840]  I think it some of it is good and some of it is bad many people have argued against General Dempsey
[02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:07.240]  I don't think General Dempsey Martin Dempsey has gotten his full reward for what he really did
[02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:13.560]  He stopped us our involvement in Syria. It would have been catastrophic had we gotten into a civil war
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:16.720]  He took the bold move to start giving the Russians intelligence
[02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:22.080]  Outside of the neocons of the CIA trying to run an al-qaeda takeover. I mean do people get that?
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:23.640]  I mean that is so epic
[02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:29.400]  American military said we're not gonna do this and quietly joined with Russia to stop the head choppers
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:33.240]  That is so epic. That's exactly correct at the same time
[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:40.440]  We had a man whom I didn't know named a Jewish guy named Dan Conn who's deputy director of the CIA and the Treasury
[02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:48.880]  to affect an amazing economic warfare against Iran over a period of five to seven years and
[02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:53.120]  Literally take down Iran with our economic weapons
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:56.160]  Forcing the their currency to drop
[02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:00.480]  Forcing their bonds to be junk bond and putting them into bankruptcies
[02:47:00.480 --> 02:47:07.160]  So this is not about Jew or a Christian or Muslim. There were no Muslims involved in 9-11
[02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:12.760]  The ones who were involved in 9-11 who are Muslims were the countries like Turkey, Pakistan, Dubai
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:16.640]  Qatar and the Bush family who worked for the Dubai
[02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:23.160]  Security company the actual Muslims weren't even on the plane. There was no such thing
[02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:29.440]  So what happened in effect is the whole Bush family of the entourage of what you're seeing now in the Republican Party
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:34.360]  Created this 9-11 so we could have the war machinery go into effect
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:39.880]  Without the consensus of our military without the agreement of our intelligence community
[02:47:40.120 --> 02:47:44.080]  Without the support of the American people. That was an act of treason
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:48.520]  Have you seen the video where our reporters talked to Jeb Bush about 28 pages twice?
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:53.720]  And he actually has an adrenaline rush and it looks like he's seen a ghost and it looks totally scared
[02:47:54.320 --> 02:47:59.760]  Yeah, but Jeb Bush is an idiot. He's a coward and he's an idiot and it came out very clearly
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:05.520]  He didn't know what he was talking about. He had no idea what he was talking about in terms of the Iraq War
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:09.920]  He was involved in 9-11. The man was a disaster as a governor
[02:48:09.920 --> 02:48:12.480]  He brought me up to basically try to
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:16.840]  Impress me that he had an intellectual fort day when he had none
[02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:22.720]  The truth of the matter is the entire Bush family has been a great criminal enterprise
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:28.480]  They sent the kids to Andover where I have had that family there and then went on to Yale
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:35.360]  They are a disaster as the Clintons are but the beauty of what the American public has done and your audience has done
[02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:37.360]  Is number one the Panama Papers?
[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:41.960]  Trust me. It is our intelligence community that released
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:51.520]  Thousand millions eleven point five million pieces of paper that did not come from an entourage of a hundred different media groups
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:49:00.720]  It did not come from a hundred and forty countries. It came from an intelligence community that responded to the will of the American people to say
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:05.480]  Okay, now we're going to start cleaning out the entire world
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:11.560]  System that has the neocon agenda that has the
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:18.320]  Transnationalism elements, let's do it by one thing showing the corruption that goes through Panama
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:21.880]  Even when I worked in Panama and trying to take out Noriega
[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:26.160]  I never suspected that there were greater criminals than Noriega for me
[02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:29.000]  Noriega was pretty honest relative to everybody else
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:34.160]  Although he could put he was a bad guy in certain ways. He was pretty straightforward
[02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:40.360]  But the point of fact is the American people has compelled our intelligence community to release that
[02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:43.880]  Secondly, they have compelled James Comey of the FBI
[02:49:43.880 --> 02:49:49.120]  Loretta Lynch of the Attorney General and this administration to investigate
[02:49:49.320 --> 02:49:57.280]  The Clinton Foundation and the email scandals to the point where she will she may well be indicted
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:03.960]  If she is indicted that is the culmination of everything the American people have wanted
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:08.600]  I was about to say is it the 9-11 info coming out like the string on the sweater
[02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:16.120]  That was a very important part of all of this Hillary. I mean, so so so I'm right and saying we're seeing a slow-motion
[02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:21.400]  Collapse of the nastiest parts of the establishment. Yes, correct
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:26.720]  Alex, you're absolutely we are all witnessing the collapse of what happened 9-11
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:32.760]  But it did not happen just out of blue it happened because we had loyal military individuals
[02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:34.760]  We had loyal intelligence officials
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:43.400]  We had 16 different units of our intelligence community that really worked together and we had people within the executive branch and the
[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:45.080]  Legislative branch
[02:50:45.080 --> 02:50:49.120]  Including senators who were brave enough to say we've had it. That's right
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:52.240]  They're the heroes. They're the heroes folks and they were all there
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:57.960]  Leaking the info the entire time who said they you know, they wouldn't do something like that and speak out. No, they did speak out
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:03.600]  Are you concerned about the power grid about the new war on the power grid?

[02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:26.080]  Especially when our national debt is spiraling out of control many smart Americans have kept their

[02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:29.640]  Coming up we got a sneak peek with an interview that Billy Corrigan take with Lee and McAdoo about
[02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:33.880]  How to take back social media basically the deals with Donald Trump and more
[02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:39.360]  We're gonna play five minutes that interview that won't be out for a week or so coming up in the fourth hour
[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:41.120]  The David Nines gonna be hosting
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:46.960]  We also have a lot of other news to be breaking but says here momentum slows for Saudi 9-11 investigation
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.840]  That's in the Hill Lindsey Graham one of the neocons
[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:55.800]  Heavily heavily involved in trying to suppress that but we already know people that have read it
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:55:01.200]  What's in it a stand-down Saudi Arabia involved Saudi Arabia financing with supposed hijackers that were really the decoys
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:05.400]  And then now our own elite would actually try to fund ISIS and Al Qaeda
[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:08.640]  As a proxy army dr. Pachinik
[02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:15.520]  What is the state of the establishment I know they're scared I know there a lot of them are leaving the country right now
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:21.760]  But shows they think something really big is about to come out Bill Clinton said something political so big globally is about to come out
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:25.120]  It'll almost split the planet. He said that's why Hillary's needed
[02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:30.240]  They're all telegraphing huge stuffs coming from your intel your sources, but also your trained eye
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:36.400]  What else big is about to happen that you think people should be made aware of the most important thing?
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:43.440]  That should happen and will happen is Trump overriding the Republican Party restrictions in terms of voting and representation
[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:50.640]  The American people have to continue to insist one vote one person not a delegate
[02:55:50.880 --> 02:55:58.960]  Not some quorum not some caucus at the party can no longer exist the party is not relevant to the existence of our Republic
[02:55:59.160 --> 02:56:04.480]  The Republican Party is dead for all practical purposes. So is the Democratic Party
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:12.480]  Those of you who believe in what the Republicans stood for really should insist now that Trump be the front runner without any more
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:19.440]  Qualifications or restraint and those of you who believe that Bernie Sanders should represent the Democratic Party then do so
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:26.320]  But the reality is Hillary Clinton should be indicted the two major aspects that will come forth on the Republic
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:33.520]  will be the indictment of Hillary Clinton for crimes against the state and national security and the
[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:40.200]  crowning of Trump to come forth if that does not happen on either case
[02:56:40.200 --> 02:56:43.640]  You will have what we call a political revolution
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:52.400]  Whether it's an agitation in the streets. I don't think so whether it will be an outcry from the American public through social media
[02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:57.320]  I suspect that will happen. All right, dr. Pachennick. We've only got five more minutes left with you
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:57:00.920]  We're gonna come back in front of give you the floor to break down more other key points
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:04.240]  We think this is going and I forgot you've got the new book out about your mom
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:08.720]  I have been intending to read it. It sounds so interesting the whole history of your family
[02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:14.040]  The great perspective I want to get you set up now in the next few weeks to come on for a full hour
[02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:20.840]  Just to talk about the new book tiadora at Steve Pachennick dot com people can find out more there about that stay right there
[02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:22.840]  We're gonna come back to you here in just a moment
[02:57:22.960 --> 02:57:26.920]  So please set that up Nico. I want to get him on I know it's been a lot of news taking place
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:30.120]  But this is really important to go back to the history of what he and his mother
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:36.580]  Witnessed and some of the things that helped develop his understanding of things. It's a very clear. I think very accurate understanding
[02:57:36.580 --> 02:57:38.660]  I briefly we got a new product out
[02:57:39.620 --> 02:57:45.940]  It of course goes with our bone support and that is the bone support with the joint support
[02:57:45.980 --> 02:57:50.060]  These are just basically the best formulas you you could come up with if you didn't want them
[02:57:50.860 --> 02:57:52.860]  you know

[02:58:03.020 --> 02:58:06.540]  And then put a fair price on it. You have to pay
[02:58:07.740 --> 02:58:15.060]  double basically to get a similar formula and we have a skeletal defense pack that is the new bone support with the joint formula
[02:58:15.060 --> 02:58:16.300]  That's so popular
[02:58:16.300 --> 02:58:19.900]  bone supports a new product 20% off the already discounted
[02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:28.020]  Product so there you go and that supports the broadcast not just your skeletal makeup and your bones and joints joint formulas

[03:00:09.580 --> 03:00:11.580]  the answer to
[03:00:11.700 --> 03:00:13.620]  1984 is
[03:00:13.620 --> 03:00:15.220]  1776
[03:00:15.220 --> 03:00:18.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:00:18.860 --> 03:00:22.460]  All right, Dr. Pichett, I've got another question for you and I know we're out of town time
[03:00:22.460 --> 03:00:25.740]  I appreciate you coming on and going back and forth you know in this kind of discussion today
[03:00:27.100 --> 03:00:31.200]  But here the questions I'm getting on info wars comm did Trump really say
[03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:37.500]  Transgenders use any bathroom they want or is this media spin? No, he said we shouldn't build them their own bathrooms
[03:00:37.740 --> 03:00:40.460]  Because it'll bankrupt people like the access ramps
[03:00:40.460 --> 03:00:46.460]  It that's what he said so everybody's just going to single-person bathrooms because of all this weirdness
[03:00:46.460 --> 03:00:52.580]  And this is admitted psych warfare going after the family political correctness attacking mother and father
[03:00:52.860 --> 03:00:58.100]  This is stuff you'd use to kill a civilization. It's like ant killer. You know like we're ants or something
[03:00:58.420 --> 03:01:04.020]  Dr. Pichett, what do you think the political correctness? I think that's their only weapon is just getting us all to end fight with each other
[03:01:04.020 --> 03:01:06.460]  I think that's backfiring. What's your view on that?
[03:01:06.460 --> 03:01:12.720]  Well, I think it's backfiring. I think that you know you have to be sensitive differences and cultural
[03:01:13.620 --> 03:01:15.620]  Variations, but it doesn't mean you over
[03:01:15.900 --> 03:01:20.700]  You overstep your bounds and and it means you don't spend a lot of time on that issue
[03:01:20.700 --> 03:01:22.060]  We've had
[03:01:22.060 --> 03:01:25.060]  America should be proud of the fact that we've had number one
[03:01:25.060 --> 03:01:27.940]  We have a an African-American president number two
[03:01:28.340 --> 03:01:34.740]  We have women on you know the the Supreme Court number three. We've really advanced quite a lot and
[03:01:34.740 --> 03:01:35.780]  and
[03:01:35.780 --> 03:01:43.100]  You know advancement takes some amount of push and pushback and that's part of our revolution
[03:01:43.100 --> 03:01:47.660]  You know, we have always been in constant motion and we always will be in constant motion
[03:01:47.780 --> 03:01:53.460]  But the key right now is to focus in on the fact that the American will has to be represented
[03:01:53.620 --> 03:01:59.300]  By a president who represents the American will and not the American political correctness
[03:01:59.300 --> 03:02:06.300]  That has to be determined by Trump Hillary or whoever they want to put up there if Hillary's indicted
[03:02:06.940 --> 03:02:08.580]  That's their problem
[03:02:08.580 --> 03:02:13.860]  The key issue now is that we have massive amounts of corruption that's occurred domestically
[03:02:14.540 --> 03:02:18.540]  Internationally has been exposed by our own internal intelligence system
[03:02:18.740 --> 03:02:26.940]  We have a republic that will continue to go on but unfortunately we're sending soldiers overseas without the permission of the American people
[03:02:26.940 --> 03:02:31.100]  I know of a group of young men who are going now into the Horn of Africa
[03:02:31.660 --> 03:02:34.540]  They're coming out of Florida and the question is why?
[03:02:34.940 --> 03:02:40.300]  Why are we continuing to send our young men and women into harm's way when in fact?
[03:02:40.300 --> 03:02:43.820]  We haven't declared a state of war and we're not in the state of war
[03:02:44.380 --> 03:02:48.780]  Terror does not exist. I know about I know about some of those
[03:02:49.140 --> 03:02:51.500]  African operations that are going on to this is a great find
[03:02:51.500 --> 03:02:58.500]  I mean they're doing and they give them with these wild cover stories to make the special ops people think that it's for a greater good
[03:02:58.500 --> 03:03:01.140]  But it's very limited. They like have the intro mission
[03:03:01.140 --> 03:03:04.820]  That's the cover mission and then and then the rest of the mission aren't those soldiers
[03:03:04.820 --> 03:03:06.820]  I think they are smart enough to figure that out
[03:03:07.180 --> 03:03:10.540]  well, most of them are highly trained many of them are our
[03:03:11.700 --> 03:03:17.820]  Masters in political science many of them are advanced politicians in our communities
[03:03:17.820 --> 03:03:22.540]  Many of them are far superior in intelligence than you would have imagined
[03:03:22.540 --> 03:03:30.420]  But nevertheless they join to serve our country the issue at hand isn't the fact that they're serving our country the issue at hand is
[03:03:30.420 --> 03:03:37.100]  Where are we deploying our troops and why and why isn't our president or whoever's in charge explaining?
[03:03:37.100 --> 03:03:45.060]  Why we're deploying thousands of men into the Horn of Africa and why are we still continuing in a 15-year war in Afghanistan?
[03:03:45.060 --> 03:03:51.380]  That is certainly self-destructed and why are we still in Iraq for the god knows how many times so
[03:03:51.580 --> 03:03:56.260]  These are the issues that have to be quickly resolved. Trump has articulated the problem
[03:03:56.820 --> 03:04:03.860]  Trump has said look we have to look at this in a serious way and we meet and we need generals like Mike Flynn and others
[03:04:03.980 --> 03:04:08.620]  To address the issues of where we can and where we shouldn't be involved
[03:04:08.620 --> 03:04:12.900]  I don't think we belong in the Horn of Africa if we need the Horn of Africa
[03:04:12.900 --> 03:04:19.300]  there are many mercenary companies that can go there instead of our own men and women and I think we have to
[03:04:19.580 --> 03:04:26.220]  Reconsider where our deployments are occurring and what we need them for all right. I know you're a busy guy
[03:04:26.220 --> 03:04:30.680]  But I said this a few months ago when you were on will you come on soon and talk about your new book?
[03:04:31.020 --> 03:04:36.300]  No problem. It's always a pleasure to be on and God bless your people and thank you all for everything
[03:04:36.300 --> 03:04:40.260]  You've done for this country all of you dr. Pachinik does it feel good?
[03:04:40.260 --> 03:04:42.260]  Absolutely, I mean just in ten seconds
[03:04:42.900 --> 03:04:46.140]  How good does it feel those see a 9-11 truth come out and that's got to feel good?
[03:04:46.140 --> 03:04:51.200]  Well, it feels wonderful, but we still have a lot of work to do and I think the American public should
[03:04:51.420 --> 03:04:58.100]  Congratulate itself and also continue to fight and thanks to all of you for a wonderful wonderful. Absolutely. Thank you, dr.
[03:04:58.100 --> 03:05:05.660]  Pachinik. Hey Joe Biggs here with some brand new information about the social justice warrior fight for freedom and allowing men to go into women's
[03:05:05.660 --> 03:05:12.340]  Restrooms target stores open women's bathrooms and changing rooms to men. Yeah, now our women and daughters are safe
[03:05:12.340 --> 03:05:14.660]  It's so accepting and progressive. It's cool
[03:05:14.660 --> 03:05:20.420]  The target apartment store chain has jumped into the transgender bathroom debate by declaring that men who claim to be women may use
[03:05:20.420 --> 03:05:25.580]  Whatever bathroom or changing room they choose. Yeah, we're making such progressive waves
[03:05:26.140 --> 03:05:34.340]  Inclusivity is a core belief a target a new company statement reads it's something we celebrate we stand for equality and strive to make our guests and team members feel
[03:05:34.340 --> 03:05:39.460]  Accepted respected and welcomed in our stores and workplaces every day
[03:05:39.460 --> 03:05:43.220]  We're not even worried about the actual transgendered people. It's the pedophiles
[03:05:43.220 --> 03:05:46.980]  It's the ones you're gonna go in there put on a dress and go after young girls
[03:05:46.980 --> 03:05:52.500]  That is what we're worried about. This has got to end the social justice warrior. Bulls is
[03:05:53.660 --> 03:05:56.980]  Ridiculous, I'm Joe Biggs, and I do not approve this message
[03:05:56.980 --> 03:06:05.060]  Oh, yeah, first of all, I want to say take the 12 act to Superman brain force plastic art silver bullet

[03:07:08.380 --> 03:07:12.580]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8 30
[03:07:12.580 --> 03:07:14.460]  I was kind of run down, you know
[03:07:14.460 --> 03:07:17.980]  I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview
[03:07:17.980 --> 03:07:22.180]  I got my bottle of brain force right there pop two of them and about 20 minutes later
[03:07:22.180 --> 03:07:25.060]  It's like being everything just kind of clears up

[03:07:30.380 --> 03:07:37.660]  Neutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off
[03:07:37.660 --> 03:07:41.740]  I haven't pulled it all night or like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force
[03:07:41.740 --> 03:07:47.700]  I went home about 645 this morning took three hours of sleep got up took two more brain force and came in
[03:07:47.700 --> 03:07:56.700]  You will find a brain force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139
[03:07:56.700 --> 03:08:16.700]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you right from the front lines of the info war
[03:08:16.700 --> 03:08:26.700]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show this fourth hour. I'm David Knight. We're gonna be talking to
[03:08:27.100 --> 03:08:29.100]  Larry Nichols live at the bottom of the hour
[03:08:29.100 --> 03:08:32.740]  We're gonna play a report for you here just a moment from Billy Corrigan
[03:08:32.740 --> 03:08:34.740]  We pull this out because it's very interesting what he talked about
[03:08:35.260 --> 03:08:42.260]  How Facebook is trying to ban a Trump page, so we're going to play that report in just a moment before we do I want you to
[03:08:42.260 --> 03:08:47.340]  Be aware of the many different ways that tricks are being used in this election
[03:08:47.340 --> 03:08:50.020]  This is one of the key things about this election. I think win or lose
[03:08:50.020 --> 03:08:56.260]  It's key that we educate people about the crooked games that are being played. Here's an example of one, okay?
[03:08:56.820 --> 03:09:02.020]  In Pennsylvania, there's this article from Bloomberg Trump wave bills in a steel town
[03:09:02.020 --> 03:09:04.180]  That's been forsaken by the world economy
[03:09:04.180 --> 03:09:08.940]  Of course they talk about it being a Trump wave because this is the town of Johnstown, Pennsylvania
[03:09:08.940 --> 03:09:13.100]  It's been devastated by floods not once or twice but three times in less than a century
[03:09:13.140 --> 03:09:20.060]  But the thing that really wiped them out was the economic wave as they point out that washed away the steel industry
[03:09:20.060 --> 03:09:23.500]  And the way of life in that area so Trump has a very large
[03:09:24.260 --> 03:09:31.900]  Lead and Pennsylvania the latest CBS survey shows him 20 points ahead of his closest rival and yet
[03:09:32.380 --> 03:09:37.260]  There are stories about how the election is going to break down when they have the election
[03:09:37.260 --> 03:09:42.300]  It's going to be a nice beauty contest again, and there's going to be some delegates that follow
[03:09:43.060 --> 03:09:47.260]  Whoever wins this contest, but that's not that many delegates
[03:09:47.860 --> 03:09:53.180]  Most of the delegates are going to be done later in an election that most people are not talking about
[03:09:53.180 --> 03:09:59.420]  They don't want you to talk about it because just like in Colorado like the GOP establishment person told one of the people that we interviewed
[03:09:59.420 --> 03:10:06.120]  They told her well, she said why hasn't this been publicized nobody's talking about this election and how this is being done
[03:10:06.120 --> 03:10:08.300]  He goes well, we don't want the wrong people to show up
[03:10:08.820 --> 03:10:13.620]  Now in Pennsylvania, not only are they not talking about the true election of the delegates
[03:10:14.060 --> 03:10:21.180]  But they don't even allow on the election ballot for it to be indicated as to who the delegates
[03:10:21.660 --> 03:10:26.420]  Support so you're going to be going if you bother to go to the second election that you probably won't know about
[03:10:26.900 --> 03:10:31.220]  You're going to be going there to vote for some anonymous delegates
[03:10:31.220 --> 03:10:40.340]  Okay, you don't know who these guys are but believe me the insiders will know who is who so if Trump really wants to win that state
[03:10:40.340 --> 03:10:45.340]  He needs to do essentially what Roger Stone has said we're going to do at the Cleveland Commission
[03:10:45.340 --> 03:10:46.860]  So we're going to go around we're going to talk to the delegates
[03:10:46.980 --> 03:10:49.580]  We're going to say declare who you support
[03:10:49.580 --> 03:10:54.980]  I you know do you come from a state like South Carolina where Trump won all the delegates then tell us do you support Trump?
[03:10:54.980 --> 03:11:00.740]  Or do you support Cruz who are you really who are you really and like I said yesterday when we the reason we have this
[03:11:00.740 --> 03:11:06.400]  Language of delegates and we say it's Trump's delegates or Cruz's delegates is because of the electoral college
[03:11:06.400 --> 03:11:14.220]  And in that situation the guy who wins the state gets to send his slate of candidates in so if the Republican Party
[03:11:15.060 --> 03:11:19.100]  Wins they've already got a slate of delegates that they've registered with Board of Elections saying
[03:11:19.340 --> 03:11:24.620]  These are the delegates that are going to go for the Republican candidate likewise for Democrats even for the Libertarian parties
[03:11:24.620 --> 03:11:29.420]  I point out yesterday. I was on a slate of delegates in case the Libertarian Party candidate one
[03:11:29.420 --> 03:11:34.940]  You would expect wouldn't you that the candidates delegates are going to be loyal to the candidate now
[03:11:34.940 --> 03:11:39.060]  They can always change their mind as delegates if we get into several rounds of voting
[03:11:39.060 --> 03:11:45.220]  But you you still wanted to make sure this person is going to be loyal to the voters wishes
[03:11:45.220 --> 03:11:51.620]  Because it's the voters that were really taking them away from so what Trump needs to do is he needs to run some ads in that state saying hey
[03:11:52.020 --> 03:11:58.980]  Yeah, they're trying to rig Pennsylvania to they're gonna have I want you to vote in this election because there's some delegates up in this
[03:11:58.980 --> 03:12:04.340]  Beauty contest and that's important beauty contest, but the real election is coming is such and such a date and
[03:12:04.980 --> 03:12:12.380]  Here are the slate of candidates that you should be voting for or send them to a website to say these are the delegates
[03:12:12.380 --> 03:12:16.980]  You should be voting for we need to get smart about how this game is played and we need to educate the people
[03:12:17.500 --> 03:12:20.020]  That there is a game that is being played about this
[03:12:20.020 --> 03:12:26.380]  Let's talk about let's let's run this report of Billy Corgan talking about how Facebook is banning Trump pages a
[03:12:26.380 --> 03:12:32.220]  Lot of my friends are what I would qualify quantify as average Americans is my family
[03:12:33.500 --> 03:12:40.740]  What do they do at a participatory level to either encourage or discourage things that they don't agree with and
[03:12:41.180 --> 03:12:48.940]  I think it takes a little bit more savvy if we're in the info or it takes a little bit more savvy to know how to get into those systems
[03:12:48.940 --> 03:12:53.500]  In a way that we can leverage our own position just like the social justice warriors do
[03:12:53.500 --> 03:13:00.300]  But at the same time not resort to the kind of the scummies part of it all which is sort of leading people astray
[03:13:01.020 --> 03:13:03.580]  Look when you use the word liberty
[03:13:04.220 --> 03:13:06.220]  Most people don't find that word sexy
[03:13:06.460 --> 03:13:11.340]  You know racist has a lot more to it than libertarian
[03:13:11.820 --> 03:13:17.060]  Libertarian sounds like you're stuck in the back of a truck with Ron Paul and he's talking to you about like, you know
[03:13:17.060 --> 03:13:23.380]  For you see papers and freedom. It doesn't sound very exciting to me. Okay, you know, I tend to like the social argument
[03:13:25.060 --> 03:13:27.460]  You have to start this would be my argument
[03:13:27.460 --> 03:13:34.220]  You have to start by identifying that the most powerful thing in the world right now are these technocratic systems that are in place
[03:13:34.700 --> 03:13:36.700]  search engines
[03:13:36.700 --> 03:13:39.540]  The way we connect on these on these social platforms
[03:13:39.540 --> 03:13:47.500]  Governments he have either encouraged these things to come along or quickly realizes that they were the new element arms of control
[03:13:47.500 --> 03:13:53.260]  And so you have to ask yourself whether your participation in these systems is actually enslaving you
[03:13:53.460 --> 03:13:57.380]  Then you have to drill down a little further and you have to want to ask questions about
[03:13:58.140 --> 03:14:02.900]  if what you're doing and participating in is is truly as
[03:14:03.780 --> 03:14:05.780]  open as it seems
[03:14:05.780 --> 03:14:11.100]  So if Twitter for example is full of people of a diversity of opinions and you feel like hey
[03:14:11.100 --> 03:14:15.900]  It's the it's it's capitalist. It's my idea versus yours who tweets more who gets more retweets
[03:14:15.900 --> 03:14:21.500]  Who says the right incendiary thing who does the right mean great that's America great
[03:14:21.500 --> 03:14:26.460]  And I would only argue, you know, where do you cross the line and you see it all the time?
[03:14:26.460 --> 03:14:28.460]  I mean infowars puts up articles
[03:14:28.980 --> 03:14:33.220]  As somebody who's in the in the world and I have to watch what I say when you see a page
[03:14:33.220 --> 03:14:37.060]  That's literally and the pages the Facebook page is assassinate Donald Trump
[03:14:37.060 --> 03:14:42.660]  And and I believe Facebook comes out and says that doesn't violate our standards and practices. Okay, that's where
[03:14:43.420 --> 03:14:49.340]  Somebody like myself has to ask is my participation in the Facebook system and I would call it a system
[03:14:49.580 --> 03:14:56.500]  Am I actually encouraging something which as an American I find offensive and I also find an offensive that a business would support
[03:14:57.020 --> 03:15:02.940]  You can call I would have no problem with the page that said Donald Trump's a racist Donald trust a home
[03:15:02.940 --> 03:15:08.900]  Oh, Donald Trump's a homophobe because because that's just opinion the many you talk about killing someone
[03:15:09.700 --> 03:15:13.340]  Sorry, that's where you need to step in as a business. I will not support that
[03:15:14.420 --> 03:15:16.700]  So why does that? Why is that okay?
[03:15:16.900 --> 03:15:21.500]  But you can imagine what page you could create on Facebook today and there would be calls for you to never work here
[03:15:21.500 --> 03:15:25.060]  Infowars ever again, right? That's that's where it gets funky
[03:15:25.180 --> 03:15:31.200]  So you have to be sophisticated enough to look at those systems and say is my participation encouraging something that I know deep down is
[03:15:31.200 --> 03:15:36.260]  Intrinsically not only flawed but counterintuitive to what I what I want to be part of
[03:15:36.800 --> 03:15:42.520]  Mm-hmm, and in essence your participation is condomin. Now. I run a business. I have a Facebook page
[03:15:42.520 --> 03:15:48.600]  I need the Facebook page at this day to run my business. It's an effective system. I don't like everything
[03:15:48.600 --> 03:15:53.120]  So that's just another piece of information that may ultimately push me off Facebook
[03:15:53.120 --> 03:15:55.120]  and I'm willing to take the commercial and
[03:15:55.120 --> 03:16:01.560]  Public hit of not having that reach that I have to the four million plus people that follow us on Facebook
[03:16:01.680 --> 03:16:06.600]  Because at the end of the day I as an American can't support that so does it bother me? Yes
[03:16:06.960 --> 03:16:09.080]  Do I have to have the argue in my head? Yes
[03:16:09.080 --> 03:16:13.360]  And to this point I haven't made that decision if you're not having that argument in your own head
[03:16:13.360 --> 03:16:16.000]  Then you're not participating and then to use Alex's term
[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:22.040]  You're just a drone who's just falling around you're pretending you have no influence and you do and I think too
[03:16:22.040 --> 03:16:28.720]  It's really time for a lot of us who are libertarians and who are for freedom and who are concerned and who do
[03:16:29.360 --> 03:16:34.680]  We're not kind of in the trance. We do see we do need to start coming together and
[03:16:35.440 --> 03:16:42.040]  Working and setting up our own systems to counteract their systems that they have that's why we'd use the word empowerment
[03:16:42.400 --> 03:16:48.120]  Empowering people with let's not call it the facts and the truth the facts and truths are always kind of ephemeral
[03:16:48.120 --> 03:16:54.840]  It's just I have the beholder stuff empowering people to have a better range of decision-making as far as how they approach their social systems
[03:16:54.840 --> 03:16:56.640]  I think that's powerful
[03:16:56.640 --> 03:17:03.160]  Then if you take the extra step and you say like maybe info war sets up its own version of social media
[03:17:03.440 --> 03:17:09.680]  So that like-minded businesses are able to participate in a system that is ultimately holistic to the idea is that you would believe
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:14.160]  Okay, and that was Billy Corgan with Leanne McAdoo talking about
[03:17:14.160 --> 03:17:19.840]  Facebook and banning you know, they're trying to ban cash and we've got an article at infowars.com
[03:17:20.720 --> 03:17:26.840]  It's Mark dice and yet another man on the street. This has been picked up by the drudge report
[03:17:26.840 --> 03:17:32.680]  I want to play some of Mark Dice's report banning cash. Will people sign a petition to ban cash?
[03:17:33.360 --> 03:17:38.640]  All and move forward in a cashless society most people don't even carry any cash on them
[03:17:38.640 --> 03:17:40.640]  So we're gonna be issuing a new digital currency
[03:17:40.640 --> 03:17:45.360]  Instead of cash for people to use to help the economy
[03:17:45.680 --> 03:17:50.880]  How is it gonna help the economy? Well, it'll eliminate the black market with no cash
[03:17:52.240 --> 03:17:54.880]  eliminate people avoiding paying taxes and
[03:17:55.920 --> 03:18:00.520]  With the digital just print print birthday signature with the digital currency
[03:18:00.960 --> 03:18:06.360]  People's purchases will always be tracked traced in database for more accountability
[03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:11.640]  I want my purchases tracked. Well, just what do you I'm not sure what you have to hide
[03:18:12.240 --> 03:18:14.760]  Just give us a quick print here
[03:18:16.280 --> 03:18:22.580]  Print birthdate signature just to help move America forward just to help keep everybody safe
[03:18:24.120 --> 03:18:31.360]  This will help to encourage everyone's purchases or tracks and traced in database to just to make sure they're not buying things
[03:18:31.360 --> 03:18:34.920]  They shouldn't be buying well, maybe I like buying stuff. I shouldn't be well
[03:18:34.920 --> 03:18:39.720]  We're gonna put it into that. Now. You can see the rest of that report at info wars.com and again
[03:18:39.720 --> 03:18:45.560]  You can also find it at the dredge report. It's currently linked there. That's mark dice getting people to sign a petition
[03:18:45.800 --> 03:18:47.800]  So whether or not we should ban cash
[03:18:48.440 --> 03:18:52.720]  Now they're not just banning cash. They're changing our money. They're changing the people on money
[03:18:52.720 --> 03:18:58.240]  We're gonna talk about what's really behind that. They got everybody fighting now. That's what Obama does really well
[03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:00.520]  Divide people along racial lines
[03:19:00.520 --> 03:19:05.840]  We're also going to talk about the pissing contest that's going on in all of our bathrooms across the country
[03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:09.720]  Trump has stepped into that now. We're gonna talk about that coming up before we do real quickly

[03:24:09.520 --> 03:24:13.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David I we're gonna be talking to Larry Nichols
[03:24:13.080 --> 03:24:17.160]  It's gonna be rejoining us who is on with Alex earlier in the broadcast
[03:24:17.160 --> 03:24:21.760]  He's gonna be rejoining us in the next segment before we do. I want to talk about some of these
[03:24:21.760 --> 03:24:26.240]  Crazy issues that we're dealing with right now and of course the first one
[03:24:26.240 --> 03:24:30.880]  We just had Mark Dias asking people would they sign a petition to ban cash because you know
[03:24:31.280 --> 03:24:36.400]  If you're using cash, maybe you got something to hide. Maybe you're a bad person
[03:24:36.440 --> 03:24:44.720]  Maybe you aren't controlled enough by the central banks. Okay, so we need to ban cash and it's ironic to me
[03:24:44.720 --> 03:24:52.480]  That is our government and as the Federal Reserve moved to ban cash. They're playing games with whose faces are on our bills
[03:24:52.920 --> 03:24:54.360]  now look
[03:24:54.360 --> 03:24:58.440]  We need to understand what's really going on here. Okay, this is not only political correctness
[03:24:58.600 --> 03:25:02.400]  Donald Trump was right to call it out and say changing Jackson
[03:25:02.880 --> 03:25:06.440]  Taking him off and putting Harriet Tubman on is nothing but pure political correctness
[03:25:06.440 --> 03:25:13.480]  He was absolutely right and he said exactly the same thing as been Carson did we've got the story up an info wars.com Steve Watson
[03:25:13.480 --> 03:25:18.800]  Quoting Donald Trump. He said I think Harriet Tubman is fantastic, but Andrew Jackson had a great history
[03:25:18.800 --> 03:25:21.200]  I think it's very tough when you take somebody off of a bill
[03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:25.200]  He said I'd love to leave Jackson on see if maybe we can come up with another denomination
[03:25:25.200 --> 03:25:27.200]  Maybe the $2 bill or another
[03:25:27.400 --> 03:25:33.240]  Denomination this is essentially what Ben Carson said he said I'd like to honor both of them. So let's come up with something new
[03:25:33.240 --> 03:25:36.160]  That's what Greta van Cestern said. She said let's come up with something new
[03:25:36.160 --> 03:25:40.240]  She proposed the $25 bill because actually we've already got a $2 bill with
[03:25:40.240 --> 03:25:46.080]  Jefferson on it. I think nobody uses it. She thinks the $25 bill will be more useful. She goes on to say this, you know
[03:25:46.080 --> 03:25:51.760]  I'm a feminist I love to see women acknowledge for the great things they do to contribute to our nation Harriet Tubman did great things
[03:25:51.760 --> 03:25:58.240]  But what I don't get is this rather than dividing the country between those who happen to like the tradition of our currency
[03:25:58.240 --> 03:26:02.560]  I want president Andrew Jackson to stay put and those who want to put a woman on the bill
[03:26:02.560 --> 03:26:07.840]  It's so easy to make everybody happy just come up with a new bill put it a Harriet Tubman on it as well
[03:26:07.840 --> 03:26:12.360]  Look. Yeah, Andrew Jackson was a great president. Did he own slaves? Yes
[03:26:12.960 --> 03:26:21.080]  Did Alexander Hamilton own slaves? Yes, he did in spite of the Broadway play where they've got black people and women playing the founding fathers
[03:26:21.720 --> 03:26:26.240]  Alexander Hamilton own slaves as well. He even bought slaves. Okay. Now
[03:26:26.960 --> 03:26:31.000]  Let's understand the real issue here. Okay, like I said, they're banning cash
[03:26:31.160 --> 03:26:35.600]  The real issue is that you are a slave folks
[03:26:35.600 --> 03:26:44.440]  Obama owns slaves. The Federal Reserve owns slaves. They own you. You are the slave. Aren't you upset about that?
[03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:50.520]  All right, let's get the Federal Reserve off of our money. Okay, get their hands off of our money
[03:26:50.520 --> 03:26:55.880]  Let's go back to constitutional money. That's what Jackson was fighting for they put his face on the bill
[03:26:56.400 --> 03:27:04.080]  because he fought them and he won but then in the 20th century when they made these bills again, they won
[03:27:04.080 --> 03:27:12.400]  It was kind of bragging rights, but now that everybody's forgotten that you know, they've moved on look Andrew Jackson is the only general who fought in both
[03:27:12.760 --> 03:27:19.080]  Revolutionary and the it war of 1812. Okay, he saved this country. The British had burned down the White House
[03:27:19.080 --> 03:27:23.080]  He saved this country in the battle of 1812 probably should have played that as we came in
[03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:25.080]  he also
[03:27:25.080 --> 03:27:30.760]  Saved people from not just the British, but he saved him from the Federal Bank slavery
[03:27:30.760 --> 03:27:38.040]  He talked about the how they should not be given this monopoly power over people how they should not be able to
[03:27:38.600 --> 03:27:43.440]  Manipulate the economy and of course we had people in the 20th century make that same argument about the Federal Reserve
[03:27:44.200 --> 03:27:53.800]  He also saved the country from the Supreme Court and its overreach from the Supreme Court saying you don't have to obey the Constitution
[03:27:53.800 --> 03:28:01.520]  And have gold and silver behind your money. He also saved the country from the idea that the Supreme Court
[03:28:01.760 --> 03:28:05.240]  Has the final say but of course now all those things have been put into place
[03:28:05.560 --> 03:28:08.240]  That was always a struggle and we need to remember
[03:28:08.800 --> 03:28:13.720]  That Andrew Jackson beat them at that game and we can beat them at that game again
[03:28:13.720 --> 03:28:16.600]  And you know the interesting thing is how he beat the British. You know how he did that
[03:28:17.040 --> 03:28:20.680]  he did that with militiamen with riflemen the militia
[03:28:21.240 --> 03:28:23.040]  untrained soldiers and
[03:28:23.040 --> 03:28:28.160]  Freed slaves and even some pirates. Okay, that's how he beat the British
[03:28:28.160 --> 03:28:36.720]  And so that's the lesson from Andrew Jackson and we need to remember that now we get to the bathroom wars this cultural pissing contest
[03:28:36.720 --> 03:28:38.720]  That's going on
[03:28:38.720 --> 03:28:43.920]  Kind of the focus is in North Carolina. Well today we had Donald Trump step into it big time
[03:28:43.920 --> 03:28:48.440]  I think and some of his remarks I think are being misconstrued, but some of them aren't
[03:28:48.440 --> 03:28:53.000]  Let's first look at what's happening to some of these other people Kurt Schilling was fired by Disney
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:56.760]  Well ESPN, but you know Disney owns that Disney the people who are trying to
[03:28:57.400 --> 03:29:03.080]  Propagandize your children with their worldview. I tell you I took my family because I've got a young daughter
[03:29:03.240 --> 03:29:09.520]  We always go to see movies that the older crowd likes to see so we thought let's go to Zootopia
[03:29:09.520 --> 03:29:13.840]  It had great reviews. It had a funny trailer. So it's all right. Let's go watch this
[03:29:13.840 --> 03:29:18.720]  Took the whole family to it and after about 10 or 15 minutes
[03:29:18.720 --> 03:29:25.440]  I was so disgusted with a social engineering of feminist roles and this that I said we're leaving
[03:29:25.440 --> 03:29:30.800]  We got up whole family. I said give me my money back. I am tired of the social engineering of Disney
[03:29:30.840 --> 03:29:37.400]  Well, I got Kurt Schindler saying I got Kurt Schilling saying a man is a man no matter what they call themselves
[03:29:37.400 --> 03:29:43.640]  I don't care what they are who they sleep with a men's room was designed for the penis women's not so much now
[03:29:43.640 --> 03:29:46.600]  You need laws telling us differently. That's pathetic. Well, you know what?
[03:29:47.480 --> 03:29:50.960]  Fired for that say with us. We'll be right back. Empires on the run
[03:29:51.800 --> 03:29:54.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:29:58.600 --> 03:30:06.360]  Hey Joe Biggs here with some brand new information about the social justice warrior fight for freedom and allowing men to go into women's restrooms
[03:30:06.440 --> 03:30:10.080]  Target stores open women's bathrooms and changing rooms to men. Yay
[03:30:10.080 --> 03:30:14.760]  Now our women and daughters are safe. It's so accepting and progressive. It's cool
[03:30:14.760 --> 03:30:20.800]  The target apartment store chain has jumped into the transgender bathroom debate by declaring that men who claim to be women may use whatever
[03:30:21.000 --> 03:30:25.640]  Bathroom or changing room they choose. Yeah, we're making such progressive waves
[03:30:26.200 --> 03:30:30.680]  Inclusivity is a core belief a target a new company statement reads it's something we celebrate
[03:30:30.680 --> 03:30:35.160]  We stand for equality and strive to make our guests and team members feel accepted

[03:30:42.480 --> 03:30:43.320]  It's the pedophiles
[03:30:43.320 --> 03:30:47.160]  It's the ones you're gonna go in there put on a dress and go after young girls
[03:30:47.160 --> 03:30:53.200]  That is what we're worried about. This has got to end the social justice warrior bulls**t is f*****g
[03:30:53.840 --> 03:30:57.120]  Ridiculous. I'm Joe Biggs and I do not approve this message

[03:33:28.440 --> 03:33:30.080]  Bone support

[03:33:32.760 --> 03:33:37.560]  I'm going to definitely use this bone support contains the highest quality forms of calcium
[03:33:37.560 --> 03:33:48.160]  Or rotate magnesium or rotate vitamin D3 even msm they say some formulas containing msm or magnesium alone can cost as much as one
[03:33:48.160 --> 03:33:54.120]  Bottle of bone support, but you have these additional nutrients in here and as part of the introductory offer
[03:33:54.120 --> 03:33:59.400]  We're offering this in a skeletal defense pack with joint force now
[03:33:59.400 --> 03:34:03.800]  This is something our joint formula that we've had for a while here
[03:34:03.800 --> 03:34:07.960]  This is our new product bone support is joining joint formula

[03:34:26.200 --> 03:34:32.760]  Take away your mobility that is something that is very important is something that is especially important as we start to age
[03:34:32.760 --> 03:34:37.400]  We need to make sure that we have the correct nutrients even for younger people because we have
[03:34:37.640 --> 03:34:40.680]  Such our food has been stripped of nutrients
[03:34:40.680 --> 03:34:45.840]  You need to make sure that you have these supplements so you don't develop these kinds of problems at a much much earlier age
[03:34:45.840 --> 03:34:48.120]  It's something that happens commonly to people as they get older
[03:34:48.320 --> 03:34:54.320]  But without the kind of supplement that you need to make sure that you're getting that you're possibly not getting in your food
[03:34:54.800 --> 03:34:58.240]  You may have these kind of skeletal problems at a much earlier age

[03:35:23.360 --> 03:35:30.000]  For a long time for more than 10 years he helped Clinton get elected and re-elected as governor of Arkansas and
[03:35:30.680 --> 03:35:35.840]  He has blown the whistle on the Clintons joining us again now is Larry Nichols. Welcome Larry

[03:35:42.800 --> 03:35:49.960]  You were talking to Alex earlier today and you were saying that talking about repercussions that the elite will resort to if Trump wins
[03:35:49.960 --> 03:35:56.960]  I think it's interesting that John McCain and Jeb Bush have said that they're not going to be at the convention
[03:35:56.960 --> 03:35:58.960]  What do you make of that? They're not even going to be down
[03:36:00.680 --> 03:36:05.360]  You know, it's not just Jeb Bush and John McCain. There's been three or four other
[03:36:06.640 --> 03:36:08.640]  senior
[03:36:08.720 --> 03:36:16.960]  Establishment Republican congressmen and senators that have announced because they're in races they've announced they're not going to the convention David
[03:36:16.960 --> 03:36:20.440]  That's probably the biggest thing
[03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:24.520]  To tell people what's going to happen at the convention. Yeah
[03:36:25.640 --> 03:36:27.640]  The fix is that right?
[03:36:28.120 --> 03:36:32.360]  Yeah, the fix is in and David, you know this these guys that are running for office
[03:36:33.280 --> 03:36:39.560]  They use this convention as their time to get FaceTime on TV. Oh, yeah
[03:36:39.560 --> 03:36:48.200]  They get in front of a big crowd, you know, they get to be somebody for them to turn down this opportunity is huge
[03:36:48.640 --> 03:36:54.640]  Why why are they doing? Well because they know when they pull that
[03:36:55.520 --> 03:36:58.600]  nomination for Trump when he justifiably should get it
[03:36:58.680 --> 03:37:06.480]  There's going to be outrage and so guess what they don't want it to come back on them in their down ballot race
[03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:10.280]  Yeah, that's right or future races that they're going to do
[03:37:10.280 --> 03:37:13.600]  Yeah, our future races that they're going to do it looks like they are very I mean
[03:37:13.600 --> 03:37:17.360]  We keep hearing them say that their other support the Clintons than to support Trump
[03:37:17.360 --> 03:37:24.080]  They're willing to burn down the party so they can forward this globalist agenda that they've got just as we've seen them do over and over again
[03:37:24.080 --> 03:37:28.480]  With a keystone pipeline that's been their first priority. It doesn't matter that they got elected to
[03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:31.400]  Control the borders or to turn back Obamacare
[03:37:31.400 --> 03:37:38.560]  No, the thing that kept focusing on was keystone party a keystone pipeline because they are the keystone party and now they're focused on
[03:37:38.800 --> 03:37:45.520]  Still keeping the borders open, but also getting these trade treaties through getting the climate treaties through that's their real agenda
[03:37:45.880 --> 03:37:49.960]  Hillary will give them all of that and they're willing to burn their little party down
[03:37:50.320 --> 03:37:53.840]  So that they can get that agenda forwarded, you know, David
[03:37:54.320 --> 03:37:59.600]  You've known it. I've known it Alex has known it. We've all talked about it for years
[03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:04.920]  There's not two parties. That's right. There isn't there
[03:38:05.720 --> 03:38:07.280]  it's just
[03:38:07.280 --> 03:38:13.960]  It's a system and the system says you've got to make people believe they have a choice
[03:38:14.480 --> 03:38:17.320]  Yeah, so they set up a blue team or red team
[03:38:17.840 --> 03:38:22.800]  But as you're seeing on the Democrat side, they got the super delegate
[03:38:22.800 --> 03:38:29.680]  So before you even get in the race somebody that gets all the super delegates in this case like Hillary
[03:38:29.680 --> 03:38:33.520]  Well technically she's already won the Republicans don't have super delegates
[03:38:33.520 --> 03:38:38.600]  What they've got is they have their delegates and their delegates are
[03:38:39.400 --> 03:38:41.000]  party people
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:45.560]  There's not a person that is a delegate for the RNC
[03:38:45.960 --> 03:38:51.600]  That there's not a party loyalist from top to bottom. What does that mean? That means whatever
[03:38:51.600 --> 03:38:57.800]  Whatever the power says at the management level with the party to do they're gonna do it
[03:38:58.480 --> 03:38:59.760]  so
[03:38:59.760 --> 03:39:04.280]  Here you've got the perfect setup. They're gonna go in the convention
[03:39:04.320 --> 03:39:11.480]  They're gonna say golly gee for whatever reason the rules committee and remember the rules committee has said
[03:39:11.920 --> 03:39:14.600]  They can do whatever they want to do with the rules
[03:39:15.200 --> 03:39:17.040]  Yeah
[03:39:17.040 --> 03:39:23.480]  We're fighting the referees as well as the league aren't we and people think well
[03:39:23.480 --> 03:39:29.920]  They've got to they've got it. No, they don't have to do anything the RNC and the DNC are private clubs
[03:39:30.080 --> 03:39:36.880]  They can do anything they want to do now this gives us our last
[03:39:37.920 --> 03:39:45.360]  Opportunity David when we lose this one if we lose this one there will not be David another election
[03:39:45.360 --> 03:39:48.320]  They won't this last election. We're gonna have
[03:39:49.080 --> 03:39:56.080]  This is it. I agree part of that part of that is with all the illegal aliens that they're gonna be able to make me able to vote with the
[03:39:56.240 --> 03:39:58.760]  Mexicans the Syrians Muslims, etc
[03:39:59.320 --> 03:40:08.960]  The average American white guy black guy anybody in the category of average everyday American the people that have made this nation great
[03:40:09.160 --> 03:40:12.240]  We're not gonna be relevant. We're not gonna have enough votes
[03:40:12.240 --> 03:40:16.440]  But worse than that, let me ask you this David
[03:40:16.440 --> 03:40:21.400]  After what has come out in this campaign about the system and how it works
[03:40:22.080 --> 03:40:28.800]  How could there ever be another election? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely and one of the things that's good about this is that so far
[03:40:29.240 --> 03:40:34.680]  Donald Trump hasn't just shut up and gone along with it like unfortunately Ron Paul did last time
[03:40:34.680 --> 03:40:39.920]  You know you're talking about the Democrats or Republicans are the Democrats got their super delegation the Republicans have got their
[03:40:39.920 --> 03:40:44.000]  Secret delegates the people like we're talking about just the beginning of this
[03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:48.600]  They're now starting to talk about how in Pennsylvania. They're gonna have a beauty contest
[03:40:48.600 --> 03:40:50.440]  Which we think is the election
[03:40:50.440 --> 03:40:54.080]  But then there's going to be another election that follows after that
[03:40:54.240 --> 03:40:58.840]  There'll be delegates, but they won't list on the ballot who these delegates support
[03:40:58.840 --> 03:41:05.120]  And so that's where we need to have our voice except Larry when we talk about it and we say we want to do something about this
[03:41:05.120 --> 03:41:07.800]  We want to expose us. We want to show who these people are
[03:41:07.800 --> 03:41:10.280]  We want to show up and lobby these delegates
[03:41:11.000 --> 03:41:14.920]  Cruises allowed to lobby the delegates and that's just politics. That's just fine
[03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:22.800]  But if we talk about lobbying the delegates, we're accused of inciting a riot and citing violence because we're a mob, right?
[03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:28.680]  Well, the other problem we've got is show me a delegate show me a delegate. Yeah
[03:41:29.280 --> 03:41:35.200]  Anybody listening to this program tell me somebody you know that is a delegate. You can't find them
[03:41:35.200 --> 03:41:38.640]  You cannot find them. There's secrets. They're secret
[03:41:39.040 --> 03:41:45.200]  Now that's why I tell you if you understand and believe as I do this is the last election
[03:41:45.200 --> 03:41:47.520]  We're gonna have either we win this one
[03:41:48.040 --> 03:41:54.560]  Or our country is done now. Let me say all those people are going old conspiracy not conspiracy not yeah
[03:41:54.560 --> 03:42:02.440]  There might be an election in four years, you know, Russia and Cuba quote-unquote have elections. Oh, yeah, that's right
[03:42:02.440 --> 03:42:06.480]  But it's not going to be the elections like we thought we were supposed to be happy
[03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:14.040]  But after what has come out just in this election, they would tell me why any man woman or child would go vote
[03:42:14.640 --> 03:42:21.800]  In a Republican or Democratic primary election. Why would you go vote because you now know?
[03:42:22.760 --> 03:42:24.760]  You're wasting your time
[03:42:24.760 --> 03:42:29.280]  The establishment the hierarchy they're gonna pick who they want
[03:42:29.280 --> 03:42:35.040]  That's right. Oh, we can feel good that we went and voted but that's all we can do is feel good
[03:42:35.040 --> 03:42:37.040]  We went and voted because we had no say so
[03:42:37.040 --> 03:42:39.000]  I think you can another election
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:45.000]  I think that's why the the anger is building with the people because we have seen over a period of time unfolding
[03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:50.160]  We knew that they were doing these trans Pacific partnership. They called a partnership and not a treaty
[03:42:50.160 --> 03:42:57.120]  They played all these semantic games like we see crews the establishment playing now when they called a partnership or they call it a
[03:42:57.120 --> 03:43:00.760]  Trade agreement say well, that's not a treaty. We don't have to use a treaty process
[03:43:00.760 --> 03:43:04.120]  It's in the Constitution to approve that and oh by the way, we're working on this for years
[03:43:04.240 --> 03:43:06.000]  But you're not allowed to see it
[03:43:06.000 --> 03:43:10.000]  We're not even gonna allow your elected representative to see it for a long time
[03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:15.600]  Okay, and then once they allowed it guess what the elected representatives could care less except for senator Sessions
[03:43:15.600 --> 03:43:21.120]  And he's the only one who the only senator who has endorsed Donald Trump is the guy who read the
[03:43:21.480 --> 03:43:25.840]  This this deal that is set up to screw us a secret trade deal
[03:43:25.840 --> 03:43:29.240]  And so we've seen these secret trade deals being done
[03:43:29.240 --> 03:43:32.760]  We've seen all these insiders doing this and this is not free trade
[03:43:32.760 --> 03:43:37.840]  This is about managing our economy with a small group of people and we've seen this
[03:43:37.840 --> 03:43:42.480]  We've been getting angry about this and then we got one guy who comes out of nowhere and says you know what?
[03:43:42.480 --> 03:43:48.440]  I'm angry about that too, and I'm gonna run up against that as well, and I'm gonna expose that and not only that I'm gonna take back
[03:43:49.160 --> 03:43:54.200]  Nafta we're going to either renegotiate or end nafta because that's been a horrible deal for us
[03:43:54.200 --> 03:43:57.340]  I mean talking about getting Mexico to build a fence Mexico is making
[03:43:58.280 --> 03:44:02.560]  $60 billion a year in a trade surplus with the US because of nafta
[03:44:02.560 --> 03:44:09.720]  I mean it was an even situation sometimes would be a two or three or five billion dollar surplus one way the other until they
[03:44:09.720 --> 03:44:16.160]  Passed nafta then it jumped to 15 billion dollars when as high as 90 something and now we have you know
[03:44:16.160 --> 03:44:20.500]  We've settled at this last year at about 60 billion dollar trade deficit. We've lost
[03:44:21.480 --> 03:44:23.360]  so much money to
[03:44:23.360 --> 03:44:29.280]  Just Mexico not even Canada over this deal, and they're about to roll this out in steroids
[03:44:29.280 --> 03:44:32.560]  And that's the secret government now we have the secret election
[03:44:32.560 --> 03:44:37.080]  They're running the election the same way they put these trade treaties and that's what people are getting upset about
[03:44:37.080 --> 03:44:39.080]  That's what they're waking up to as well
[03:44:39.080 --> 03:44:43.320]  Well remember the health care bill, you know Nancy Pelosi
[03:44:43.320 --> 03:44:48.880]  You're gonna have to vote and vote and approve the bill before you get to read and see what's inside
[03:44:48.880 --> 03:44:54.200]  Well, that's right insane, right? That's right. That's the way they do it while you're being told now go vote
[03:44:54.200 --> 03:45:00.600]  Yeah, but you just have to go vote. We'll tell you who's gonna be the nominee now having said all of this
[03:45:00.880 --> 03:45:02.880]  There's one thing
[03:45:03.280 --> 03:45:06.440]  One thing David that I know and I know you know it
[03:45:06.440 --> 03:45:12.720]  There's one thing all these politicians won't want anything on earth one thing. They're afraid of more than anything on earth
[03:45:12.720 --> 03:45:19.760]  It's not me. It's not you it's not our kids grandkids. It's not the country. It's not anything their job
[03:45:20.000 --> 03:45:22.000]  It's all about their job
[03:45:22.120 --> 03:45:24.120]  So come Monday
[03:45:24.360 --> 03:45:26.280]  We're gonna fight back
[03:45:26.280 --> 03:45:33.400]  We are now I've done this trick before by the way it works every time. I did it with the Dubai ports thing
[03:45:33.400 --> 03:45:35.400]  That's how we got that turned around
[03:45:35.560 --> 03:45:37.560]  Come Monday on my Facebook
[03:45:38.080 --> 03:45:41.720]  Go to it. There's gonna be a script
[03:45:41.720 --> 03:45:49.720]  And there's gonna be phone numbers for four or five senators and congressman's the ones that are in races
[03:45:50.040 --> 03:45:53.840]  And we're gonna basically say David in this script
[03:45:53.840 --> 03:45:59.360]  We want people to call you won't call up that congressman and say you're gonna say hey listen to his staffer
[03:45:59.360 --> 03:46:02.640]  But you're not gonna talk to that person. You're gonna say this
[03:46:03.520 --> 03:46:05.520]  if congressman blank
[03:46:06.320 --> 03:46:08.040]  does not
[03:46:08.040 --> 03:46:17.600]  Fight and support whichever candidate actually wins the majority of votes from the people in that convention
[03:46:17.960 --> 03:46:24.960]  If you let it get stripped away, you don't even have to say Trump whichever one actually wins the vote from the people
[03:46:25.080 --> 03:46:30.600]  If you don't fight to make sure that person gets the rightful nomination
[03:46:30.600 --> 03:46:36.480]  I'm gonna do everything in my power with my family my friends everyone. I know
[03:46:36.480 --> 03:46:44.840]  And I'm gonna see to it that you lose your election this time, and you'll never hold public office again ever now
[03:46:44.880 --> 03:46:50.440]  That's excellent, and you've been around you know how this works. You helped to get Bill Clinton elected and reelected
[03:46:50.440 --> 03:46:52.440]  Let me give them your Facebook
[03:46:52.640 --> 03:46:56.540]  It's Facebook comm forward slash Larry dot
[03:46:56.960 --> 03:47:05.120]  Nichols dot nine two one that's Larry dot Nichols dot nine two one and that's how they can find that information
[03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:08.760]  That's gonna start on Monday. You're gonna give them a game plan on what they can do as activists
[03:47:08.920 --> 03:47:13.640]  We when you go to Facebook, you'll know it's mine cuz it'll say up at the top of it revolution
[03:47:13.640 --> 03:47:18.520]  Yeah, I'll 2.0. So please kind of look and maybe Larry Nichols Conway
[03:47:18.520 --> 03:47:24.080]  I don't know. I can't figure that stuff out, but go there. It's gonna be there, but David. This is important
[03:47:25.600 --> 03:47:30.640]  There's a rule I wrote it so I know about it did it for the Clintons now it's a part of Washington
[03:47:30.640 --> 03:47:37.680]  You can never make someone love you enough David to work as hard to get you elected as somebody that hates you
[03:47:37.680 --> 03:47:43.040]  We'll work to the future. That's right. I'm in a law politics. That's right to use that
[03:47:43.200 --> 03:47:50.440]  We've never had more power and we're gonna have right now and we can destroy the Republican Party down ballot
[03:47:50.440 --> 03:47:55.760]  I mean we can destroy congressmen senators chances of getting elected judges
[03:47:56.600 --> 03:47:57.720]  governors
[03:47:57.720 --> 03:47:59.720]  state reps you name
[03:47:59.720 --> 03:48:05.480]  If we can get enough people and it doesn't have to be as many as you think David
[03:48:05.880 --> 03:48:12.280]  Cuz we're gonna use what's called force multiplication. You know if I call you one time. That's one call, right?
[03:48:12.280 --> 03:48:13.320]  Yeah, that's right
[03:48:13.320 --> 03:48:20.800]  But if I call your office five times and each time I call it on you know each time I call I get another
[03:48:21.360 --> 03:48:22.860]  staffer
[03:48:22.860 --> 03:48:24.860]  I'm now five people
[03:48:24.860 --> 03:48:33.660]  Well think about it if I got a thousand people calling that congressman's office or your office and each one calls five times that
[03:48:34.460 --> 03:48:36.260]  that's
[03:48:36.260 --> 03:48:43.300]  5,000 people then their old minds start working remember they're scared of us at election time only time
[03:48:43.300 --> 03:48:46.940]  But they're scared election time all of a sudden they think well my god
[03:48:47.300 --> 03:48:51.660]  You know David if there's 5,000 people that have called and said this I
[03:48:51.660 --> 03:48:59.260]  I met there's five million that feel that way, but just haven't called and that's key because people typically don't participate
[03:48:59.260 --> 03:49:02.500]  I mean I've done a lot of political rallies with
[03:49:03.460 --> 03:49:07.300]  With the Republican Party for example that we were covering and nobody shows up
[03:49:07.300 --> 03:49:12.780]  I've had situations where it was the Republicans and Democrats that we were filming and nobody showed up
[03:49:12.780 --> 03:49:16.060]  And so when you have a situation we got tens of thousands of people show up for Trump
[03:49:16.060 --> 03:49:21.140]  That's amazing and if nobody calls them on issues and we've seen this happen over and over again
[03:49:21.140 --> 03:49:24.020]  I've seen when they've tried to restrict homeschooling
[03:49:24.020 --> 03:49:30.980]  I've seen what a determined group of homeschoolers can do to turn that legislation around as you pointed out if they know that
[03:49:30.980 --> 03:49:35.020]  People are going to hate them on this particular issue and they can make that go away
[03:49:35.100 --> 03:49:39.460]  They know that it's if they're on the other hand if people are motivated to get them out
[03:49:39.900 --> 03:49:43.340]  Motivated enough to call them. That's a big issue. So you're going to focus
[03:49:44.100 --> 03:49:46.100]  These people on some key
[03:49:46.100 --> 03:49:52.260]  Individuals and how are you picking these individuals? That's the key thing is how you pick these individuals. I know
[03:49:52.260 --> 03:49:58.500]  I know most all of the long-time standing congressman and senators and I know which ones are
[03:49:58.820 --> 03:50:05.900]  Two things we need number one scared and then number two the ones that will spread the word to the others
[03:50:06.300 --> 03:50:09.300]  We only have to call all the congressmen and all the senators
[03:50:09.300 --> 03:50:14.220]  Hey, we want to pick three or four congressmen and senators call that group pour the cold to them
[03:50:14.220 --> 03:50:20.540]  They'll spread the word. They'll spread the word now another product. I'm gonna find out people that aren't going to the convention
[03:50:20.900 --> 03:50:27.620]  Yeah, you're not going to the convention. I got you and that's what people gotta know David because they're already scared aren't they Larry
[03:50:27.620 --> 03:50:31.540]  They're already afraid of the public. That's why they're not going to the convention in the first place
[03:50:31.540 --> 03:50:33.040]  That's the key point
[03:50:33.040 --> 03:50:37.980]  The convention folks you say these words. I got you buddy. I got you
[03:50:37.980 --> 03:50:44.700]  Jeb's not going to use Jeb's not going because Jeb is a mess. He can very easily be intimidated
[03:50:44.700 --> 03:50:47.980]  We've seen him be intimidated. He was intimidated by Donald Trump
[03:50:47.980 --> 03:50:51.820]  But we know Donald Trump supporters can intimidate him. Hang on. We got to take a commercial break
[03:50:51.820 --> 03:50:57.220]  We're gonna be right back with Larry Nichols a great plan of action. Stay with us. We'll talk more about that just been
[03:50:59.420 --> 03:51:03.420]  Do you or someone you know suffer from chest pain blood pressure
[03:51:03.420 --> 03:51:10.300]  Cholesterol or irregular heartbeat? Are you looking for a more natural solution to overcome these health challenges?
[03:51:10.620 --> 03:51:17.020]  You hear the ads all the time if this stuff's so good. Why doesn't my doctor prescribe it? That's easy
[03:51:17.060 --> 03:51:19.060]  There's more money in treating symptoms

[03:54:09.980 --> 03:54:19.980]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and we're talking to Larry Nichols and he has a strategic plan to apply political pressure to key people
[03:54:19.980 --> 03:54:24.980]  This is a grassroots plan. It's something you can participate in. It doesn't cost anything but your time
[03:54:24.980 --> 03:54:33.980]  This is something we all need to do. What is it worth to you in terms of your time to keep your country, to keep your freedom, to keep your rights?
[03:54:33.980 --> 03:54:39.980]  This is what you can do to make sure that you keep the elections, at least the voice of the people are heard
[03:54:39.980 --> 03:54:44.980]  This is a new level of corruption that we've not seen openly in elections before
[03:54:44.980 --> 03:54:51.980]  And we need to react to this. We need to react when they take our freedoms. I'll go back to Larry Nichols in just a moment
[03:54:51.980 --> 03:54:55.980]  I had Rob do pop his head in here during the break and say, you know, Prince just died
[03:54:55.980 --> 03:55:00.980]  He had some interesting comments when he was talking to people. He's talked in the past about Kim Trails
[03:55:00.980 --> 03:55:04.980]  But he also talked about copyright protection on his art
[03:55:04.980 --> 03:55:08.980]  And he said, you know, pretty soon they're going to come after our DNA
[03:55:08.980 --> 03:55:15.980]  So this is a guy who was awake on a number of levels, Prince, who just died today
[03:55:15.980 --> 03:55:20.980]  And before I go back to Larry Nichols, I just want to mention briefly that we have a new product, Bone Support
[03:55:20.980 --> 03:55:27.980]  And we are offering that in conjunction with Joint Formula for 20% off in a Skeletal Defense Pack
[03:55:27.980 --> 03:55:34.980]  Now Bone Support is an exclusive formula that contains key compounds that are known to support healthy bones and teeth
[03:55:34.980 --> 03:55:39.980]  And also you get that with Joint Formula. We call that the Skeletal Defense Plan

[03:55:55.980 --> 03:56:00.980]  Let's go back to Larry Nichols. Larry, tell us how people can help you
[03:56:00.980 --> 03:56:06.980]  First, before we go back to talking about your plan on putting pressure on key people
[03:56:06.980 --> 03:56:11.980]  To tell them to follow what the voters are saying, tell people how they can help you with PayPal
[03:56:11.980 --> 03:56:15.980]  Because I know you're facing some very serious health issues
[03:56:15.980 --> 03:56:21.980]  Well, I need it, I hate begging, but I need it desperately. You can go to PayPal
[03:56:21.980 --> 03:56:27.980]  And go to NicholsLive at AOL.com. NicholsLive at AOL.com
[03:56:27.980 --> 03:56:35.980]  And that's N-I-C-H-O-L-S. NicholsLive at AOL.com
[03:56:35.980 --> 03:56:42.980]  And folks, if you can help, please do. I wish I were well enough, David, where I wouldn't have to ask people for help
[03:56:42.980 --> 03:56:51.980]  I wish I wouldn't have to ask people to give me help to make these phone calls
[03:56:51.980 --> 03:56:58.980]  But folks, all I'm asking, all David, we're asking people to do is you're going to get these guys' number
[03:56:58.980 --> 03:57:03.980]  You're going to make five phone calls to four or five different people
[03:57:03.980 --> 03:57:07.980]  We're talking about making 20 to 25 phone calls to save your nation
[03:57:07.980 --> 03:57:09.980]  If you're not willing to do that
[03:57:09.980 --> 03:57:11.980]  That's right, that's right, we're dead
[03:57:11.980 --> 03:57:15.980]  If you're not willing to do that, don't look in the mirror and call yourself a patriot because you're not
[03:57:15.980 --> 03:57:20.980]  Boy, when you think about what people have done in the past, have they put everything on the line
[03:57:20.980 --> 03:57:26.980]  They've put all their property, their reputation and their lives on the line in so many different ways
[03:57:26.980 --> 03:57:30.980]  I talked to a guy who was a historical interpreter for George Washington
[03:57:30.980 --> 03:57:34.980]  We think about what the guys went through at Valley Forge during that winter
[03:57:34.980 --> 03:57:37.980]  What many people have gone through over our history
[03:57:37.980 --> 03:57:45.980]  If you won't pick up the phone and make a few calls to make sure that these politicians are, that their feet are held to the fire
[03:57:45.980 --> 03:57:48.980]  That they do what the people want them to do
[03:57:48.980 --> 03:57:51.980]  This is a single issue, over and over again
[03:57:51.980 --> 03:57:55.980]  We've elected them for particular issues and they turned their backs on us
[03:57:55.980 --> 03:58:00.980]  I'm going to say one other thing, when I heard today's program with Alex
[03:58:00.980 --> 03:58:04.980]  I got to tell you something, David, with the things that are coming, folks
[03:58:04.980 --> 03:58:10.980]  David will tell you, I hope he'll tell you, I'm not here to hawk product or sell anything
[03:58:10.980 --> 03:58:14.980]  But I'm going to tell you all something and you better listen tight
[03:58:14.980 --> 03:58:16.980]  We've got about 20 seconds
[03:58:16.980 --> 03:58:20.980]  This country is coming down if we're not careful and if we don't win
[03:58:20.980 --> 03:58:21.980]  That's right
[03:58:21.980 --> 03:58:26.980]  Y'all better get stocked up on the things that you can get right here with
[03:58:26.980 --> 03:58:27.980]  That's serious now
[03:58:27.980 --> 03:58:29.980]  That's serious now, yes, thank you so much
[03:58:29.980 --> 03:58:47.980]  And that, thank you Larry Nichols, join us tonight, 7 central, 8 p.m. Eastern for the Nightly News
