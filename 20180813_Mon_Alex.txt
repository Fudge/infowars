[00:00.000 --> 00:14.340]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:14.340 --> 00:28.320]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:28.320 --> 00:32.520]  Crashing wicked this way comes.
[00:32.520 --> 00:42.620]  We are two months and 25 days out from the most important election in U.S. history, undoubtedly
[00:42.620 --> 00:44.400]  getting Trump in was only the beachhead.
[00:44.400 --> 00:49.320]  This is holding the beach and going inland.
[00:49.320 --> 00:54.220]  Anyone associated with the return of the Republic and the return of Americana and the
[00:54.220 --> 00:58.780]  free market dream and reality is under unprecedented attack.
[00:58.780 --> 01:03.640]  If you are a TV or radio listener, more and more, that's the only place you can find us.
[01:03.640 --> 01:04.640]  God bless you.
[01:04.640 --> 01:06.040]  Please spread the word.
[01:06.040 --> 01:11.480]  When we come back, I have a stack from just today of the services and we've talked to
[01:11.480 --> 01:12.840]  lawyers clearly.
[01:12.840 --> 01:15.240]  These are all antitrust issues.
[01:15.240 --> 01:21.560]  These are all very, very actionable, but they're doing it in mass, believing if hundreds
[01:21.560 --> 01:23.000]  of them hit us.
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.760]  That's what it takes to run a technology operation, a multimedia operation, that they'll just
[01:27.760 --> 01:33.280]  get away with it because something big is about to happen and it's not going to matter
[01:33.280 --> 01:34.280]  anymore.
[01:34.280 --> 01:40.200]  We've got a very good idea of what that big thing is and it's in multiple letters we
[01:40.200 --> 01:44.200]  got when they do tell us why they're cancelling us off services.
[01:44.200 --> 01:46.120]  This will be exclusive.
[01:46.120 --> 01:51.080]  These companies blacklisting us are new ones to the 20 plus have already done it.
[01:51.080 --> 01:53.480]  They tell us what we're not allowed to say.
[01:53.480 --> 01:54.960]  They said it's fake news.
[01:54.960 --> 01:57.480]  There are no Islamic training camps.
[01:57.480 --> 02:00.400]  No one is trying to kill police officers.
[02:00.400 --> 02:07.280]  No one is trying to overthrow Trump.
[02:07.280 --> 02:12.960]  That is now not to be discussed because they want us with our feet flat and asleep and
[02:12.960 --> 02:15.320]  the civil unrest hits.
[02:15.320 --> 02:17.680]  It's unbelievable.
[02:17.680 --> 02:18.960]  Doesn't matter how real it is.
[02:18.960 --> 02:29.080]  And then we need to break down what is this big event because it's not just the Islamic
[02:29.080 --> 02:32.760]  training camps being activated to carry out terror attacks across the country.
[02:32.760 --> 02:38.480]  It's not just Hezbollah that I first broke, same-field strike with terror groups inside
[02:38.480 --> 02:39.480]  the U.S.
[02:39.480 --> 02:42.880]  Then a week later they came out and said, yes, we'll do that.
[02:42.880 --> 02:49.360]  They're planning to accelerate the censorship, which is already happening, to engage in all
[02:49.360 --> 02:54.440]  sorts of serious election fraud, to foment serious civil unrest all over the country.
[02:54.440 --> 03:00.240]  They've already been caught doing anti-foot beating up NBC reporters yesterday in D.C.
[03:00.240 --> 03:01.760]  and NBC covered it up.
[03:01.760 --> 03:05.040]  People were able to film it.
[03:05.040 --> 03:12.280]  They're building towards something huge and they've radicalized the general Democrat
[03:12.280 --> 03:17.280]  to do mutinous things.
[03:17.280 --> 03:24.040]  Remember just four months ago, Google reinstated the Alex Jones channel and said on YouTube
[03:24.040 --> 03:26.080]  and said, okay, he didn't say those things.
[03:26.080 --> 03:29.120]  We had people that weren't trained properly.
[03:29.120 --> 03:34.400]  I told you days before that they had a mutiny inside Apple, inside Google, inside YouTube,
[03:34.400 --> 03:35.960]  inside all these platforms.
[03:35.960 --> 03:38.880]  And now that mutiny is admitted.
[03:38.880 --> 03:45.240]  So we have the leftist SJW trained class from the universities, trained in Maoist philosophy
[03:45.240 --> 03:50.040]  nationwide by design by the big banks that funded it, same ones that put Mao in.
[03:50.040 --> 03:53.920]  It was a Western-funded operation.
[03:53.920 --> 04:01.560]  And they are intending to become very lawless and just escalate their saboteur operations.
[04:01.560 --> 04:08.840]  And that means lying about the president, lying about me, doing anything you can imagine
[04:08.840 --> 04:14.080]  So this is it, ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake.
[04:14.080 --> 04:21.880]  It's all about to come down in the next two months, 20-something days, and it's just going
[04:21.880 --> 04:24.360]  to get more and more out of control.
[04:24.360 --> 04:27.680]  And the left has said, go out, hashtag hunt Republicans.
[04:27.680 --> 04:28.680]  Republicans have been shot.
[04:28.680 --> 04:29.680]  They have been beaten.
[04:29.680 --> 04:35.520]  And I've been told in corporate letters, I'm going to show you, you don't talk about
[04:35.520 --> 04:36.520]  that.
[04:36.520 --> 04:41.120]  And I've also been told to the grapevine, you know all hell broke those last two weeks
[04:41.120 --> 04:43.320]  against me.
[04:43.320 --> 04:50.880]  Whistleblowers inside Google went public and said, we're building a search engine censorship
[04:50.880 --> 04:55.200]  in China, in the U.S., and we're planning to use it in the U.S. too.
[04:55.200 --> 04:56.560]  And then Apple's moving to China.
[04:56.560 --> 04:57.560]  It's all happening.
[04:57.560 --> 05:00.320]  We've been sold out.
[05:00.320 --> 05:01.320]  We knew it was coming.
[05:01.320 --> 05:03.320]  The whole thing was for me leg.
[05:03.320 --> 05:08.600]  Just demonize info wars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility
[05:08.600 --> 05:14.060]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[05:14.060 --> 05:16.400]  children and Islamophobia.
[05:16.400 --> 05:17.400]  And then, wallah.
[05:17.400 --> 05:23.360]  Two weeks later, ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we
[05:23.360 --> 05:27.800]  were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds.
[05:27.800 --> 05:28.800]  of the free podcast.
[05:28.800 --> 05:29.800]  Just click on the link.
[05:29.800 --> 05:33.240]  Whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[05:33.240 --> 05:38.000]  It's also critical to go to infowords.com or slash newsletter and give us your emails
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.840]  so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[05:42.840 --> 05:48.380]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowords.com or slash show how they can download the free
[05:48.380 --> 05:53.040]  Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and
[05:53.040 --> 06:00.040]  coin out. This is the verboten info. This is what they don't want you to see.
[06:00.040 --> 06:02.040]  We've got it.
[06:02.040 --> 06:05.040]  The Christmas is coming soon.
[06:05.040 --> 06:11.040]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:11.040 --> 06:19.040]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:19.040 --> 06:32.040]  In the last two weeks, you have seen a total concerted global effort by all the top tech
[06:32.040 --> 06:40.040]  giants, openly working with the Chinese Communist, Democratic Party and major law firms to absolutely
[06:40.040 --> 06:47.040]  demonize yours truly and build me into a total monster to then be de-platformed in a giant
[06:47.040 --> 06:53.040]  concerted racketeering operation to set the precedent to do it to everybody else.
[06:53.040 --> 06:57.040]  And since it began two weeks ago, it's happening to thousands and thousands of mainline second
[06:57.040 --> 07:04.040]  amendment sites, pro-veterans groups, pro-Trump groups, Gavin McGinnis, the list goes on and
[07:04.040 --> 07:06.040]  on, Laura Loomer.
[07:06.040 --> 07:13.040]  Now, the banning is coming in so fast that they use my banning as just the smoke screen
[07:13.040 --> 07:17.040]  though that it's happening to Alex.
[07:17.040 --> 07:18.040]  One man dies.
[07:18.040 --> 07:19.040]  It's a tragedy.
[07:19.040 --> 07:20.040]  A million die.
[07:20.040 --> 07:21.040]  It's a statistic.
[07:21.040 --> 07:22.040]  Joseph Stalin.
[07:22.040 --> 07:27.040]  And I'm going to list not just Vimeo but a bunch of others that totally banned us today
[07:27.040 --> 07:33.040]  and read you their letters on air of why they say they're doing it.
[07:33.040 --> 07:35.040]  And it's unbelievable.
[07:35.040 --> 07:42.040]  But I'm not going to get into Info Wars until the bottom of the hour.
[07:42.040 --> 07:48.040]  I'm going to wait and I'm going to go through these letters that I have blacked out, their
[07:48.040 --> 07:49.040]  emails and numbers.
[07:49.040 --> 07:53.040]  I'm not like they are or they dox everybody.
[07:53.040 --> 07:55.040]  And it's incredible.
[07:55.040 --> 08:00.040]  We have letters from Google and their general counsel.
[08:00.040 --> 08:04.040]  We have letters from Vimeo and we have letters from other groups.
[08:04.040 --> 08:09.040]  I'm going to break on air coming up and it's all unified.
[08:09.040 --> 08:11.040]  It's all concerted.
[08:11.040 --> 08:15.040]  And you know my crime.
[08:15.040 --> 08:18.040]  You know my crime.
[08:18.040 --> 08:21.040]  China had basically merged with the U.S. under globalism.
[08:21.040 --> 08:22.040]  That's official.
[08:22.040 --> 08:24.040]  Council on Foreign Relations reported that.
[08:24.040 --> 08:28.040]  All 50 state-run universities were almost completely chai-com run.
[08:28.040 --> 08:31.040]  That's even foreign affairs had to admit that.
[08:31.040 --> 08:33.040]  Because Trump said now they're going, oh, we're loyal.
[08:33.040 --> 08:34.040]  We're loyal to America, sir.
[08:34.040 --> 08:35.040]  So it's coming out.
[08:35.040 --> 08:37.040]  Look at Drudge just today.
[08:37.040 --> 08:42.040]  U.S. probes sell a Mexican radio near LA for ties to Beijing propaganda.
[08:42.040 --> 08:44.040]  Oh, it's everywhere.
[08:44.040 --> 08:49.040]  Google woos partners for China expansion.
[08:49.040 --> 08:56.040]  Google whistleblowers went public two weeks ago and said we're preparing a total censorship
[08:56.040 --> 08:57.040]  system here.
[08:57.040 --> 08:59.040]  That was really what they said.
[08:59.040 --> 09:03.040]  The intercept went with the fact that they're building the total censorship system for
[09:03.040 --> 09:05.040]  China in the U.S.
[09:05.040 --> 09:11.040]  But they're already doing it here and they're incrementally turning it on.
[09:11.040 --> 09:19.040]  Google, Facebook, and Apple have 93% of the total coverage of the Internet in their own
[09:19.040 --> 09:20.040]  numbers.
[09:20.040 --> 09:27.040]  They are worth $3 trillion combined with their subsidiary companies.
[09:27.040 --> 09:35.040]  All the other major ad companies are going bankrupt or being susumed into Google for a
[09:35.040 --> 09:38.040]  total monopoly of advertising.
[09:38.040 --> 09:45.040]  And they're always doing what the monopolists do.
[09:45.040 --> 09:47.040]  They're shutting down everyone.
[09:47.040 --> 09:49.040]  It's not just me.
[09:49.040 --> 09:51.040]  I'm going to explain this again.
[09:51.040 --> 09:56.040]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to show you documents.
[09:56.040 --> 10:03.040]  These big companies, the top four tech companies, I should add Amazon to that, control 93% of
[10:03.040 --> 10:08.040]  the advertising, the marketing, the web searches, everything.
[10:08.040 --> 10:17.040]  And now they're using me as the example to go after everyone.
[10:17.040 --> 10:20.040]  And it's happening.
[10:20.040 --> 10:29.040]  And the corporate media is covering it saying, oh, we're just getting rid of hate speech.
[10:29.040 --> 10:32.040]  And they give examples in these letters of the hate speech.
[10:32.040 --> 10:36.040]  You claim there's Muslim training camps, training to shoot up schools and police.
[10:36.040 --> 10:40.040]  That's associated press.
[10:40.040 --> 10:43.040]  You claim transgender liberal groups are sexualizing children.
[10:43.040 --> 10:47.040]  It's their own admission.
[10:47.040 --> 10:52.040]  So they are all consolidating the entire market.
[10:52.040 --> 10:54.040]  They're all grossly overvalued.
[10:54.040 --> 10:59.040]  They're teetering because of their too big to fail nature.
[10:59.040 --> 11:02.040]  It makes them tend to fall apart.
[11:02.040 --> 11:05.040]  It's an oxymoron, but it's a paradox.
[11:05.040 --> 11:14.040]  And even mainline news admits that Google is involved in total censorship of everything.
[11:14.040 --> 11:16.040]  They're teaching China how to do it.
[11:16.040 --> 11:19.040]  They're running China's censorship.
[11:19.040 --> 11:24.040]  They got called out, probably the original intercept article, please, came up to us.
[11:24.040 --> 11:28.040]  I read this on Arab of the weekend again, but it's transcripts.
[11:28.040 --> 11:31.040]  How am I going to go to the C-SPAN's archive with the dates and actually get the video?
[11:31.040 --> 11:35.040]  Because all of its archive now, it's so powerful.
[11:35.040 --> 11:39.040]  And they say on there, the congressman is going, you are now merged with the communist Chinese
[11:39.040 --> 11:43.040]  that are rounding up their dissidents and they're using your own system to do it.
[11:43.040 --> 11:48.040]  And you are now aiding and abetting against America and you better stop it.
[11:48.040 --> 11:52.040]  And they say they stopped it in 2010.
[11:52.040 --> 11:54.040]  They never stopped.
[11:54.040 --> 12:05.040]  And so you've got this system, the gulag of Google or the blinders of Google, the goggles of Google, it's here.
[12:05.040 --> 12:10.040]  And they were going to make their move in 2017 when Hillary was in, but she didn't get in.
[12:10.040 --> 12:13.040]  So now they've been trying to still launch it for a year and a half.
[12:13.040 --> 12:15.040]  And they've decided Katie bar the door.
[12:15.040 --> 12:18.040]  The Republican Congress doesn't know exactly what's going on.
[12:18.040 --> 12:23.040]  Trump's figured some of it out, but not completely.
[12:23.040 --> 12:29.040]  And so they are making their move with hundreds of billions equivalent of advertising
[12:29.040 --> 12:35.040]  to block all conservatives so only globalist messages can get out, to let the Chai comms come in,
[12:35.040 --> 12:40.040]  to set the precedent for total censorship and then towards the centerference and economic sabotage
[12:40.040 --> 12:42.040]  and going after our servers.
[12:42.040 --> 12:53.040]  And they just kicked us off another big ad platform after Google, after we had kicked off Adblade last year.
[12:53.040 --> 12:58.040]  So this is a real 21st century war and here's the big announcement.
[12:58.040 --> 13:00.040]  We're going to cover next segment.
[13:00.040 --> 13:04.040]  There is a big event coming.
[13:04.040 --> 13:08.040]  They're trying to sabotage the economy and implode the recovery.
[13:08.040 --> 13:10.040]  And the economy has major problems.
[13:10.040 --> 13:16.040]  Trump's trying to fix it like an emergency engineer, you know, in Star Trek.
[13:16.040 --> 13:18.040]  Scotty, can you get me more power?
[13:18.040 --> 13:22.040]  We got gremlins in the reactor trying to blow it up, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:22.040 --> 13:29.040]  And they're gearing up civil unrest and murder squads and promoting it everywhere.
[13:29.040 --> 13:32.040]  And full page ads saying, uprise, overthrow Trump.
[13:32.040 --> 13:34.040]  And they go, look, full page ads, New York Times.
[13:34.040 --> 13:36.040]  And they go, Jones is lying. No one's attacking.
[13:36.040 --> 13:37.040]  Lay down, lay down.
[13:37.040 --> 13:40.040]  I mean, this is military tactics, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:40.040 --> 13:45.040]  And the unified scripting of mainstream media lying about me, the president, is unbelievable.
[13:45.040 --> 13:48.040]  So we have to discuss what the big event is.
[13:48.040 --> 13:49.040]  You can feel it.
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.040]  You can see it, but they wouldn't be making bold moves.
[13:53.040 --> 13:55.040]  Not just against me, but against others.
[13:55.040 --> 13:59.040]  If they didn't know they were about to lose their whole globalist plan over America.
[13:59.040 --> 14:02.040]  And China has said they're behind it.
[14:02.040 --> 14:03.040]  It's treason.
[14:03.040 --> 14:07.040]  The people who have signed on to this are just the worst type of mercenaries, but they're worse than that.
[14:07.040 --> 14:16.040]  They've got some weird trained hatred of America that they were taught in the colleges.
[14:16.040 --> 14:24.040]  And if they just can't get over it, they just can't stop.
[14:24.040 --> 14:32.040]  So I'm going to say this right now, beyond info wars.
[14:32.040 --> 14:34.040]  People better spread the word.
[14:34.040 --> 14:36.040]  They better call in the talk radio.
[14:36.040 --> 14:37.040]  They better call Congress.
[14:37.040 --> 14:38.040]  They better call the White House.
[14:38.040 --> 14:41.040]  They better go to events and tell Trump, hey, they're getting ready to try to take you out.
[14:41.040 --> 14:42.040]  He knows that, obviously.
[14:42.040 --> 14:53.040]  But this is an, this country is under siege from within and from without all these sellouts like I'm a Rosa and everybody else that are just absolutely going along.
[14:53.040 --> 14:55.040]  With the system.
[14:55.040 --> 15:04.040]  So we're going to go over it all today and I'm going to get into struck finally being fired and the Amorosa tapes and we're going to get it all of it.
[15:04.040 --> 15:15.040]  You have to understand the things that are happening absolutely mean they don't want me to have viral reach on Facebook and on Google and on YouTube.
[15:15.040 --> 15:17.040]  You type in my name.
[15:17.040 --> 15:22.040]  There's hundreds and hundreds of videos and articles that are negative before you find anything positive.
[15:22.040 --> 15:26.040]  They are burying not just us, but Trump in the country and the economy.
[15:26.040 --> 15:28.040]  These are real enemies against the nation.
[15:28.040 --> 15:30.040]  And it is a true.
[15:30.040 --> 15:32.040]  Shadding event that we've reached this point.
[15:32.040 --> 15:35.040]  But bottom line is it would have been worse if we went along with Hillary.
[15:35.040 --> 15:37.040]  It would have happened quicker.
[15:37.040 --> 15:39.040]  And at least now we're putting up a fire here.
[15:39.040 --> 15:42.040]  It's better to die on our feet and live on our knees as slaves as everybody knows.
[15:42.040 --> 15:44.040]  So I'm not even worried about info wars or me.
[15:44.040 --> 15:47.040]  I'm worried about you and your family because let me tell you something.
[15:47.040 --> 15:51.040]  They're getting ready for a violent overthrow and they're going to shut everything down.
[15:51.040 --> 15:52.040]  And they're crazy enough.
[15:52.040 --> 15:57.040]  The left is they're going to start a civil war and they're going to have some stupid cover story for it.
[15:57.040 --> 15:59.040]  So get ready.
[15:59.040 --> 16:02.040]  This is Jessica Armand, founder of My Magic Mud.

[17:55.040 --> 17:58.040]  That's DIYLN.co.
[18:26.040 --> 18:29.040]  They began studying this effect in published trials.
[18:29.040 --> 18:32.040]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[18:32.040 --> 18:37.040]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:37.040 --> 18:40.040]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:40.040 --> 18:42.040]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:42.040 --> 18:47.040]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[18:47.040 --> 18:52.040]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.040 --> 18:54.040]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.040 --> 19:00.040]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[19:00.040 --> 19:02.040]  InfoWarsLife is launching its newest product.

[19:49.040 --> 19:51.040]  It's sold out for another month and a half.
[19:51.040 --> 19:54.040]  We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[19:54.040 --> 19:57.040]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[19:57.040 --> 20:14.040]  Get yours today in FoursLife.com.
[20:27.040 --> 20:38.040]  You know, Mark Zuckerberg publicly bragged that he's going to hold the hands
[20:38.040 --> 20:44.040]  of all other online web publishers, website owners, like you hold somebody's hand in hospice.
[20:44.040 --> 20:48.040]  He's going to kill you.
[20:48.040 --> 20:52.040]  He's going to kill your independence. He's going to create one corporate hive mind.
[20:52.040 --> 20:56.040]  And you know what? He's pretty much got it. He's got two and a half billion users.
[20:56.040 --> 21:04.040]  And he's linked arms with Tim Cook, who funds and runs the most oppressive factories in the world.
[21:04.040 --> 21:09.040]  And they use Apple iCloud systems to help round up dissidents
[21:09.040 --> 21:12.040]  and have gays arrested and sent for organ harvesting.
[21:12.040 --> 21:17.040]  But he's the big gay activist, so it's okay as long as he is doing it.
[21:17.040 --> 21:22.040]  When a gay guy supports gays being rounded up and killed,
[21:22.040 --> 21:28.040]  like Tim Cook does through his death machine Apple, then it's cute and funny.
[21:28.040 --> 21:32.040]  So I'm going to give you the big news in the next segment, the evil coming this way.
[21:32.040 --> 21:38.040]  But I wanted to get to this first because when I show you these documents from major platforms banning us,
[21:38.040 --> 21:45.040]  they say that we lie and claim there's Islamic training camps preparing to kill police,
[21:45.040 --> 21:47.040]  even though it's in the Associated Press,
[21:47.040 --> 21:52.040]  and that we claim there's a plan to overthrow the president,
[21:52.040 --> 21:54.040]  even though there's full-page ads The New York Times saying do it,
[21:54.040 --> 22:01.040]  and articles saying the case for rioting, and that I'm a danger.
[22:01.040 --> 22:07.040]  And then I got told something this morning, and I got told something about another individual over the weekend about Jack Dorsey,
[22:07.040 --> 22:11.040]  that I'm going to be revealing next segment, that that's actually positive.
[22:11.040 --> 22:15.040]  And folks know I don't hold back what I say to stay on platforms.
[22:15.040 --> 22:22.040]  So I've said I don't know what Jack Dorsey is doing, leaving me on, everybody else is checking me off.
[22:22.040 --> 22:26.040]  And then I got some phone calls telling me about it.
[22:26.040 --> 22:30.040]  And I almost don't want to say it because I don't want to get Jack Dorsey in more trouble with people,
[22:30.040 --> 22:34.040]  but I know some folks that have had dinner privately with Dorsey.
[22:34.040 --> 22:40.040]  I know some folks that actually talked to him about two years ago, and then again a year ago, and then six months ago.
[22:40.040 --> 22:47.040]  And they said, no. Well, I asked both parties, I said, how much of this can I say?
[22:47.040 --> 22:49.040]  And they said, well, don't just say where it was and who it was.
[22:49.040 --> 22:52.040]  And then I was told specifically what I could say.
[22:52.040 --> 22:57.040]  But if you say what both of them told me, it kind of gives you too big a picture.
[22:57.040 --> 23:01.040]  So I have to, I'm not even ready to say all this shit, I need to write this down.
[23:01.040 --> 23:09.040]  Let me just say this, everybody better hold onto their hat and strap yourselves in.
[23:09.040 --> 23:12.040]  That's all I'm saying.
[23:12.040 --> 23:16.040]  I'm getting chills right now so hard I can't even.
[23:16.040 --> 23:23.040]  I'm not even worried about info works quite frankly, even though we're a key outpost and critical to support and God bless you all for doing it.
[23:23.040 --> 23:25.040]  This is really happening.
[23:25.040 --> 23:30.040]  You know, it's like when you drive out in the four-way stop or the red light, and this has happened to me once,
[23:30.040 --> 23:37.040]  and I've seen it a few other times, you see somebody drive out and then you go, oh my God, that person just ran a red light.
[23:37.040 --> 23:41.040]  And it's like it slows down.
[23:41.040 --> 23:45.040]  And then you see, you know, a little kid fly at the back of the station wagon.
[23:45.040 --> 23:49.040]  When I was a kid, I saw that and.
[23:49.040 --> 23:50.040]  Well, they died later.
[23:50.040 --> 23:51.040]  They didn't die that day.
[23:51.040 --> 23:58.040]  And then I saw Corvette flip and people, guys head get cut off, pulled over and gave aid.
[23:58.040 --> 24:00.040]  There's fire ants all over everywhere.
[24:00.040 --> 24:01.040]  The Corvette spun through all the muds.
[24:01.040 --> 24:02.040]  There's fire.
[24:02.040 --> 24:04.040]  It was just insane.
[24:04.040 --> 24:07.040]  The other people are still alive at Blood Spring everywhere.
[24:07.040 --> 24:13.040]  And it's like this slow motion thing where, I mean, I'm sitting here.
[24:13.040 --> 24:17.040]  And I'm next to go and I watch this family in a station wagon roll out.
[24:17.040 --> 24:18.040]  That's the allegory.
[24:18.040 --> 24:21.040]  And I look over and there's a Mack truck doing 60.
[24:21.040 --> 24:23.040]  And I'm just like, oh my God.
[24:23.040 --> 24:25.040]  And now everything's slow motion.
[24:25.040 --> 24:28.040]  And I'm like.
[24:28.040 --> 24:31.040]  And the average leftist is like, yeah, yeah, bring everybody down.
[24:31.040 --> 24:33.040]  Kill Trump, murder, death.
[24:33.040 --> 24:37.040]  And I'm just sitting here going, whoa.
[24:37.040 --> 24:43.040]  I mean, let me tell you, I'm not bored.
[24:43.040 --> 24:44.040]  I'm scared for this country.
[24:44.040 --> 24:45.040]  I'm scared for Trump.
[24:45.040 --> 24:46.040]  I'm scared for you.
[24:46.040 --> 24:51.040]  I'm scared for my kids and the spirit of evil that's been poured out by all the people that
[24:51.040 --> 24:54.640]  are anti Trump, the way they've been craved and the way they're like this, this brown
[24:54.640 --> 24:58.040]  shirt army and how and how what liars they are.
[24:58.040 --> 25:01.040]  And I can tell you, Jack Dorsey is actually scared of it.
[25:01.040 --> 25:05.040]  Of course, he's a big mainline liberal and then they had some big censorship over there,
[25:05.040 --> 25:09.040]  but he's almost like a captain on a ship of just leftist insanity and mutiny.
[25:09.040 --> 25:16.040]  And he doesn't like fascism and he's seeing a lot of it in his own people.
[25:16.040 --> 25:20.040]  And the stuff on Twitter, if they could ever take me down for what I say, my God, I mean
[25:20.040 --> 25:25.040]  Twitter is a leftist frothing lynch mob.
[25:25.040 --> 25:27.040]  So, but whatever, that's free speech.
[25:27.040 --> 25:35.040]  What is it free speech is this video shot at the rally in DC yesterday.
[25:35.040 --> 25:38.040]  Citizen journalists has leftist progressives outside the White House at a rally.
[25:38.040 --> 25:45.040]  What they would do if they could basically take control of the country.
[25:45.040 --> 25:48.040]  They all talk about killing the president.
[25:48.040 --> 25:50.040]  So the Daily Caller has a big article.
[25:50.040 --> 25:54.040]  It's also up on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[25:54.040 --> 25:56.040]  Let's go ahead and go to that tape.
[25:56.040 --> 25:58.040]  Hey guys, my name is Benny Johnson.
[25:58.040 --> 26:04.040]  I'm here at the counter protest, the United of the Right, Washington, DC and Lafayette Square.
[26:04.040 --> 26:10.040]  We are asking people what they would do if President Trump were to show up at this march.
[26:10.040 --> 26:13.040]  Some of the answers have been pretty stunning.
[26:13.040 --> 26:14.040]  Here they are.
[26:14.040 --> 26:16.040]  What'd you do?
[26:16.040 --> 26:19.040]  Burn them for the people?
[26:19.040 --> 26:21.040]  How about you, man?
[26:21.040 --> 26:26.040]  Trump could get on the floor and scrub those toilets himself.
[26:26.040 --> 26:28.040]  He's going to know how to clean.
[26:28.040 --> 26:29.040]  He needs to learn.
[26:29.040 --> 26:31.040]  He needs to learn how to clean?
[26:31.040 --> 26:32.040]  Scrub some toilets?
[26:32.040 --> 26:33.040]  Yeah.
[26:33.040 --> 26:36.040]  I mean, no, he's America's scissor and stuff.
[26:36.040 --> 26:39.040]  Okay, so we got to take him down.
[26:39.040 --> 26:40.040]  Trump!
[26:40.040 --> 26:41.040]  Trump!
[26:41.040 --> 26:43.040]  Trump!
[26:43.040 --> 26:48.040]  If it came down to it and it was a group effort, we'd have to do him like a doffy.
[26:48.040 --> 26:49.040]  Like a doffy?
[26:49.040 --> 26:50.040]  Yeah.
[26:50.040 --> 26:52.040]  What would you do, Dom, from showdom?
[26:52.040 --> 26:54.040]  Yeah, no, I'm going to lie low.
[26:54.040 --> 26:55.040]  You're going to lie low?
[26:55.040 --> 26:56.040]  Yeah.
[26:56.040 --> 26:57.040]  Yeah?
[26:57.040 --> 26:58.040]  Good possible, quick.
[26:58.040 --> 26:59.040]  This is the new America.
[26:59.040 --> 27:03.040]  These are zombie TV heads, low nutrition, full of vaccines.
[27:03.040 --> 27:07.040]  They all look just, uh, kill, kill him.
[27:07.040 --> 27:16.040]  Brains, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[27:16.040 --> 27:20.040]  And that's not cherry picking.
[27:20.040 --> 27:23.040]  And they don't want you to see that.
[27:23.040 --> 27:27.040]  And that's why they're banning and blocking every major conservative Facebook account
[27:27.040 --> 27:28.040]  you can imagine.
[27:28.040 --> 27:31.040]  YouTube, Google's banning because they're getting ready for the big event.
[27:31.040 --> 27:32.040]  Let's go back to it.
[27:32.040 --> 27:33.040]  Can you lie low?
[27:33.040 --> 27:34.040]  Yeah.
[27:34.040 --> 27:35.040]  Yeah?
[27:35.040 --> 27:36.040]  Oh, f**k it.
[27:36.040 --> 27:37.040]  F**k it up.
[27:37.040 --> 27:38.040]  You f**king come up?
[27:38.040 --> 27:39.040]  Yeah.
[27:39.040 --> 27:41.040]  If I get a tattoo, I would do that.
[27:41.040 --> 27:42.040]  What's that?
[27:42.040 --> 27:44.040]  If I get a tattoo, f**king come up, I would.
[27:44.040 --> 27:50.040]  They've got millions of people amped up to burn down every city in the U.S.
[27:50.040 --> 27:52.040]  And he's got his knife right there.
[27:52.040 --> 27:55.040]  And it's the lawlessness and the police standing down in blue cities.
[27:55.040 --> 27:58.040]  And it'll be Mr. President, you must go.
[27:58.040 --> 28:02.040]  And this is literally run by the Communist Chinese and big foreign banks who think we're
[28:02.040 --> 28:05.040]  so weak and our people are so stupid that they would do this.
[28:05.040 --> 28:11.040]  And then the executive branch would let CNN and MSNBC push for all conservatives to be
[28:11.040 --> 28:13.040]  silenced and be platformed.
[28:13.040 --> 28:19.040]  And then point their finger at Trump and say that he's the one calling for violence.
[28:19.040 --> 28:23.040]  That he's the one doing all this by speaking back to them.
[28:23.040 --> 28:26.040]  Let's continue.
[28:26.040 --> 28:27.040]  All right.
[28:27.040 --> 28:28.040]  You better stay away.
[28:28.040 --> 28:29.040]  Not that.
[28:29.040 --> 28:30.040]  Burn it out.
[28:30.040 --> 28:31.040]  Yeah.
[28:31.040 --> 28:32.040]  How about you?
[28:32.040 --> 28:33.040]  What would you do?
[28:33.040 --> 28:34.040]  I would just smack him.
[28:34.040 --> 28:35.040]  Smack him?
[28:35.040 --> 28:36.040]  Yes.
[28:36.040 --> 28:37.040]  I would smack the f**k out of him, son.
[28:37.040 --> 28:38.040]  Like that?
[28:38.040 --> 28:39.040]  Like for real.
[28:39.040 --> 28:40.040]  Yeah.
[28:40.040 --> 28:41.040]  All right.
[28:41.040 --> 28:42.040]  How about you, sir?
[28:42.040 --> 28:49.040]  If the president showed up to this march, what would you do, sir?
[28:49.040 --> 28:50.040]  Beat his a**.
[28:50.040 --> 28:51.040]  Trump showed up today.
[28:51.040 --> 28:52.040]  What would you do, sir?
[28:52.040 --> 28:54.040]  I'd throw the f**k the bell at him.
[28:54.040 --> 28:55.040]  You'd throw a bell at him?
[28:55.040 --> 28:56.040]  Yeah.
[28:56.040 --> 28:57.040]  We'll be right back.
[28:57.040 --> 29:00.040]  This is the rise of the lazy dumb stupid people.
[29:00.040 --> 29:02.040]  Let's talk tough.

[29:11.040 --> 29:12.040]  Remember.
[29:12.040 --> 29:18.040]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[29:18.040 --> 29:27.040]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you the way they fit.
[29:27.040 --> 29:33.040]  And put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[29:33.040 --> 29:37.040]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[29:37.040 --> 29:41.040]  We're good old fashioned comfort, get diamond gusset jeans.
[29:41.040 --> 29:46.040]  Every stitch guaranteed and our Defender motorcycle gene comes cavilar reinforced.

[29:56.040 --> 29:58.040]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[29:58.040 --> 29:59.040]  Others don't.
[29:59.040 --> 30:07.040]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from info wars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world.
[30:07.040 --> 30:11.040]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist.

[33:03.040 --> 33:26.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:26.040 --> 33:36.040]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:36.040 --> 33:44.040]  So info wars has been punished for pointing out that Apple, Google and others are officially helping China
[33:44.040 --> 33:53.040]  censor their own media and oppress their own people while owning and running slave factories in the case of Apple particularly.
[33:53.040 --> 33:59.040]  Amazon is allied with China for a lot of their cheap goods, but Alibaba is China's answer to that.
[33:59.040 --> 34:04.040]  So I wouldn't even put bazos in the Chinese Chai Kong camp.
[34:04.040 --> 34:08.040]  But he's certainly not in the pro-America camp. He is in the opportunist camp.
[34:08.040 --> 34:15.040]  But Tim Cook is unbelievable.
[34:15.040 --> 34:18.040]  He runs the biggest company in world history, a trillion dollars.
[34:18.040 --> 34:27.040]  It's all based in China. He's officially moved there and then he lectures the world how I need to be taken down and blacklisted
[34:27.040 --> 34:35.040]  because I involve in hate speech and fake news.
[34:35.040 --> 34:39.040]  Unbelievable.
[34:39.040 --> 34:46.040]  So I'm going to give you the big announcements here on the latest censorship and attacks and torches interference and economic sabotage we're going through.
[34:46.040 --> 34:49.040]  But it's all over the news without me telling you about it.
[34:49.040 --> 35:03.040]  That 90 plus percent of the Internet and of web searches and of web traffic and sales and advertising is on just three platforms and then a few dozen of their subsidiaries.
[35:03.040 --> 35:15.040]  And that they're now making their move monopolistically everywhere, not just against us and not just against conservatives or nationalists against everybody.
[35:15.040 --> 35:20.040]  I mean, even Newsweek says who controls the Internet.
[35:20.040 --> 35:24.040]  Facebook and Google dominance could cause the death of the web.
[35:24.040 --> 35:29.040]  That's Barry Diller. He owns Newsweek now and he's always mad wanting them to carry newspapers and TV.
[35:29.040 --> 35:32.040]  He wants a partnership with them instead of them screwing them over.
[35:32.040 --> 35:35.040]  So he's been calling for me to be shut down for a while.
[35:35.040 --> 35:40.040]  And he said earlier this year, by 2019, the web will be paid. No more free web.
[35:40.040 --> 35:46.040]  The new head of news course said that four and a half months ago in the Wall Street Journal and a big article about me.
[35:46.040 --> 35:48.040]  And then that was a subscription article.
[35:48.040 --> 35:49.040]  You want to read the derivative?
[35:49.040 --> 35:52.040]  It's hold on to your tinfoil hat.
[35:52.040 --> 35:56.040]  Alex Jones is about to be banned off YouTube.
[35:56.040 --> 35:58.040]  And voila.
[35:58.040 --> 36:00.040]  Voila.
[36:00.040 --> 36:02.040]  There you go.
[36:02.040 --> 36:05.040]  Shazam.
[36:05.040 --> 36:12.040]  The left. Oh my gosh, this is such a juicy, wonderful celebration.
[36:12.040 --> 36:17.040]  So let's go over the new big breaking news.
[36:17.040 --> 36:23.040]  Number one, Google and Apple are the two big giants working together.
[36:23.040 --> 36:30.040]  Cook's at the top when he gave the order Saturday night, Sunday, they all lined up and I was gone.
[36:30.040 --> 36:45.040]  And then all the other companies struggling to survive that just operate like a few little feeder fish following a great white shark or a whale shark or a killer whale.
[36:45.040 --> 36:54.040]  They're just hoping for tidbits and they let them straggle along like a fig leaf over the fact that they are a monopoly.
[36:54.040 --> 37:01.040]  I mean, they're tiny compared to it, but they just kind of, oh look, Congress run a monopoly.
[37:01.040 --> 37:07.040]  There's still these 10 or 15 little companies we haven't bought up that we let go out and organize advertisers and then bring them to us in our market.
[37:07.040 --> 37:14.040]  And of course, the market's all rigged, the prices are going up, the quality's going down, but it doesn't matter.
[37:14.040 --> 37:16.040]  And then everyone grovels.
[37:16.040 --> 37:20.040]  Tim Cook says, hey, I run slave factories that kill gays in China.
[37:20.040 --> 37:22.040]  I don't say a damn word, even though I'm the big gay activist.
[37:22.040 --> 37:31.040]  He says, I'm a total monopolist kingpin, totally ruthless ally with the biggest mass murderers in history.
[37:31.040 --> 37:46.040]  But I'm on a high and mighty Alex Jones's band and almost everybody else pisses their pants and rolls over except for Matt Drudge and Jack Dorsey and a few other people.
[37:46.040 --> 37:55.040]  And then howling mobs call for their heads.
[37:55.040 --> 37:57.040]  Yeah, life and death and apples forbid the city.
[37:57.040 --> 38:15.040]  Even just a few years ago, the news would report on China and the suicide vans and the mobile execution vans and the suicide nets and the forced abortions and the 18 hour work days and people living in 100 square foot apartments and shipping containers.
[38:15.040 --> 38:21.040]  And how they forced drug them, but not anymore.
[38:21.040 --> 38:27.040]  Even though China is even worse now because the media has learned to line up and all that's coming here.
[38:27.040 --> 38:29.040]  And that's why they said silence me.
[38:29.040 --> 38:36.040]  But ahead of that, they've got a big event coming.
[38:36.040 --> 38:42.040]  They've got a big event coming and we're going to talk about that in the second hour and have some special guests joining us.
[38:42.040 --> 38:43.040]  What is the big event?
[38:43.040 --> 38:57.040]  We already know with their projected operations what that constellation of attacks is and we know the general shape of it from their past operations and what they've done in other countries and from the pre programming we've seen in news and in pop culture.
[38:57.040 --> 39:09.040]  And I can give you a very good approximation of over the horizon radar what's incoming and baby, you get ready because they're going to come over those mountains.
[39:09.040 --> 39:16.040]  You want to use this science fiction analogy?
[39:16.040 --> 39:24.040]  It's like that movie extinction keeps telling them they're coming and all of a sudden points up in the sky and in here it comes incoming man the attack ships and I'm already got a telescope.
[39:24.040 --> 39:29.040]  I could see him coming in with their burners on coming into the atmosphere and they're going to go.
[39:29.040 --> 39:42.040]  I believe aliens are attacking it's an allegory but it might as well be these are super tech companies tracking everything you do spying on you in real time bragging they're doing it telling you to go to hell.
[39:42.040 --> 39:51.040]  And Trump's tried to do something about it but he's surrounded by the swamp.
[39:51.040 --> 40:01.040]  He just doesn't get why they don't just root for the country because it's in the way of their consolidation they're bringing the Chinese control here their allied with it they're married to it they've merged with it.
[40:01.040 --> 40:14.040]  It's a corporate merger with the Communist Party of China and America doesn't fit into that under globalism that's admitted it's in the WikiLeaks it's everywhere.
[40:14.040 --> 40:21.040]  So they're making their move on us right now and on you.
[40:21.040 --> 40:23.040]  And it's here.
[40:23.040 --> 40:31.040]  So I'll go to break and I promise I'll come back into the latest bannings and just how big this is because this isn't banning us off.
[40:31.040 --> 40:36.040]  Apple or banning us off YouTube or Google.
[40:36.040 --> 40:52.040]  This is banning us from commerce itself which is the last thing you ship people first to a ghetto to people forget about them you can get control find out who the leaders are kind of arrest them get the sheep ready for the trains.
[40:52.040 --> 40:56.040]  Get this you get the people ready to be taken to the wolves.
[40:56.040 --> 41:06.040]  It's been done all over the world it's been done over and over again it's a formulae so we're in a digital ghetto right now.
[41:06.040 --> 41:21.040]  And now people like myself and Laura Loomer and Gavin McGinnis and others are being totally shut down ahead of the lawsuits and the attacks and the death threats and all of it it's all being prepared.
[41:21.040 --> 41:30.040]  People say well then why did you not go along with it I can't go along with trillion dollar tax exempt corporations.
[41:30.040 --> 41:37.040]  And Tim Cook up there going I'm gay I'm gay so it's okay that China kills gays.
[41:37.040 --> 41:45.040]  And just the incredible hypocrisy of all of this it's unbelievable and it's in my blood.
[41:45.040 --> 41:49.040]  I can't go along with this situation.
[41:49.040 --> 41:54.040]  And I know you can either and believe me it's better to stand up to it than be on your knees.
[41:54.040 --> 41:58.040]  And Tim Cook said last week we're watching his app it's number one.
[41:58.040 --> 42:01.040]  We're watching it we'll probably take it down you know we're watching him.
[42:01.040 --> 42:12.040]  You think I'm scared of you man I'm scared of being somebody like you a heartless soulless vampire cultural spiritual vampire that's only into himself and rationalizes all the stuff you do.
[42:12.040 --> 42:19.040]  And then prances around everybody how you're this high and mighty guy with the New York Times owned by another corrupt kingpin.
[42:19.040 --> 42:27.040]  One of your colleagues Carlos Slim saying oh Apple is known to be the leader in the high road.
[42:27.040 --> 42:32.040]  They're the worst they're the worst.
[42:32.040 --> 42:38.040]  But they've got this whole liberal facade they're wrapped up in so it's like oh but it's all right it's all right.
[42:38.040 --> 42:44.040]  So we'll get into that news my letter to Tim Cook and that's up on Twitter at real Alex Jones for now.
[42:44.040 --> 42:51.040]  And I'll give you my take on Jack Dorsey when I've been told about him by people that know him and had dinner with him and what he really said to them.
[42:51.040 --> 42:55.040]  And you know does he really mean it I don't know he's showing some signs he does.
[42:55.040 --> 42:59.040]  So is he having his road to Damascus moment who knows.
[42:59.040 --> 43:08.040]  We knew it was coming the whole thing was for me leg first demonize info wars lie about us build a straw man then sue us to add credibility to that.
[43:08.040 --> 43:15.040]  Then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[43:15.040 --> 43:29.040]  And then wallah two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds go to info wars dot com forward slash show.

[47:56.040 --> 48:01.040]  World government designed to reduce population.
[48:01.040 --> 48:11.040]  And everybody's supposed to just watch football and baseball and reality TV and not know what's going on and just move on into the future with this austerity based anti human system.
[48:11.040 --> 48:21.040]  And Trump and some nationalists come along and say we don't want that and the whole power structure goes into complete insane overdrive to keep their agenda going.

[48:51.040 --> 49:02.040]  But if you go back to February of 2017 after Trump got it off as they were pissed.
[49:02.040 --> 49:12.040]  Adroll one of the big companies that works with Google that we were bringing in about four million dollars a year. Thank you with.
[49:12.040 --> 49:18.040]  It's not bad to make money but but we brought that into fund the operation outside advertising.
[49:18.040 --> 49:20.040]  We were banned for hate speech.
[49:20.040 --> 49:23.040]  They didn't say what the hate speech was they just said the products were hateful.
[49:23.040 --> 49:30.040]  They were water filtration air filtration high quality supplements.
[49:30.040 --> 49:35.040]  And so we were probably spending $500,000 and the product cost 50% of what it was.
[49:35.040 --> 49:43.040]  We're making a couple million dollars to put back into the operation from that and that was a lot of the extra money we had to hopefully expand.
[49:43.040 --> 49:45.040]  They took it away.
[49:45.040 --> 49:52.040]  We had some big sales and got a lot of it back but then they took a bunch of other sponsors away.
[49:52.040 --> 50:07.040]  And so this is just the continuing thing well they've hit over 20 of our platforms just in the last week and a half and I'm going to show you the latest document cam shot please.
[50:07.040 --> 50:19.040]  Now we took these out in a word document from the emails so I'm not going to show you the sensitive stuff and some of these we blacked out with document cam shot.
[50:19.040 --> 50:22.040]  This is credit.
[50:22.040 --> 50:28.040]  So they reached out to us and they were one of the groups that advertises on drugs.
[50:28.040 --> 50:30.040]  You mean they're like an ad agency.
[50:30.040 --> 50:32.040]  Others do as well.
[50:32.040 --> 50:34.040]  And they said hey we see this happen to you.
[50:34.040 --> 50:36.040]  We're libertarians.
[50:36.040 --> 50:39.040]  And we'd like your business.
[50:39.040 --> 50:48.040]  So we went and spent something that's over a half million dollars with them didn't bring in as much as has had roll but like three million and if you had all the cost in me a million and a half bucks or something.
[50:48.040 --> 50:50.040]  The fun thing sounds like a lot.
[50:50.040 --> 50:58.040]  It's not when you got 60 something full time career 20 something contractors satellite up links equipment bandwidth all of it or bandwidth cost millions a year.
[50:58.040 --> 51:00.040]  And our mission is to get the word out.
[51:00.040 --> 51:07.040]  We make money doing it on top of that great we don't take care of our families but the missions fight the globalists don't sell out don't ever compromise as you've seen.
[51:07.040 --> 51:11.040]  Try to deliver a rebirth of the country.
[51:11.040 --> 51:17.040]  And so they sent us the message August 10th you can see.
[51:17.040 --> 51:21.040]  We got this on Friday and saw it yesterday.
[51:21.040 --> 51:23.040]  Hi Garrett.
[51:23.040 --> 51:25.040]  I hope your week is going well.
[51:25.040 --> 51:30.040]  I'm ties manager and I'm reaching out on his behalf as he is currently out of the office.
[51:30.040 --> 51:37.040]  I'm writing to let you know that we've been instructed by our general counsel that's their lawyer to pause the credio campaigns.
[51:37.040 --> 51:48.040]  For info or store effectively immediately this decision has been reached and it has come to our attention that your side is in violation of our advertising guidelines.
[51:48.040 --> 51:53.040]  Of course they don't tell you what those are water filters air filters highest rated supplements.
[51:53.040 --> 51:55.040]  If you have further questions please let me know.
[51:55.040 --> 52:05.040]  Thank you Darren senior account strategy mid-market U.S.
[52:05.040 --> 52:08.040]  It gets better.
[52:08.040 --> 52:18.040]  We've got some more of these we've got the complaints sent to the server companies to shut us down and some people even add their names like Adam Flanders.
[52:18.040 --> 52:20.040]  And says this is hate this is big.
[52:20.040 --> 52:21.040]  This is evil.
[52:21.040 --> 52:24.040]  They say recently Apple Google Facebook all removed it.
[52:24.040 --> 52:26.040]  That's like saying Germany invaded France.
[52:26.040 --> 52:28.040]  So why not invade more countries.
[52:28.040 --> 52:33.040]  Content due to the fact that it's constitutes hate speech no judge no jury.
[52:33.040 --> 52:37.040]  Tim Cook that runs slave factories in China doesn't say a word about the executing gaze.
[52:37.040 --> 52:38.040]  He says so.
[52:38.040 --> 52:52.040]  So Tim Cook this horrible immoral person who's put the iCloud keys in China national security violation working with Google to censor the Chinese people and Americans this horrible immoral monster.
[52:52.040 --> 53:03.040]  Says so the Domino's fall has a company that shot us out and that we knew they were says our general counsel says.
[53:03.040 --> 53:08.040]  And then again you read these are the things going out to our servers.
[53:08.040 --> 53:13.040]  These are the things going out to the companies.
[53:13.040 --> 53:18.040]  Logs or evidence of abuse info wars dot com there's the evidence we exist.
[53:18.040 --> 53:26.040]  This is an abuse report regarding your client info wars dot com which publishes hateful material targeting minorities and other protected groups which is right out of SJW.
[53:26.040 --> 53:30.040]  No proof no nothing.
[53:30.040 --> 53:32.040]  But even if we did it's a right to exist.
[53:32.040 --> 53:37.040]  Recently Google Apple and Facebook remove all their content due to hate speech.
[53:37.040 --> 53:41.040]  Please discontinue your contract with this client.
[53:41.040 --> 53:46.040]  And they've kicked me off of LinkedIn so I guess they bankrupt me I can't get a job at McDonald's.
[53:46.040 --> 53:48.040]  This is put me in a ghetto.
[53:48.040 --> 53:50.040]  And they go through the same thing.
[53:50.040 --> 53:52.040]  These are the type.
[53:52.040 --> 53:54.040]  Of.
[53:54.040 --> 53:59.040]  Complaints that come into the server companies and into others.
[53:59.040 --> 54:02.040]  This is the type of harassment here's Google's letter came.
[54:02.040 --> 54:04.040]  Over the weekend.
[54:04.040 --> 54:10.040]  And it says they're breaking all ties with us and it says signed by the representative and no one signed it.
[54:10.040 --> 54:14.040]  And then here's the really interesting one I'll get to when we come back.
[54:14.040 --> 54:19.040]  This is just one of many places we were streaming.
[54:19.040 --> 54:27.040]  They say that it came to their attention that we're saying.
[54:27.040 --> 54:32.040]  That we're criticizing China.
[54:32.040 --> 54:35.040]  Racist characters of Chinese worth worth the proof of it.
[54:35.040 --> 54:39.040]  What does it even mean no I'm about China taking over our country.
[54:39.040 --> 54:52.040]  It claims that Islamic training camps I was showing Associated Press across the U.S. and suggestions that fifth column enemy will engage in low intensity warfare including the assassination of police officers CNN said well you know the police.
[54:52.040 --> 54:55.040]  Deserve what's happening because they're bad people remember that.
[54:55.040 --> 54:59.040]  In light of the above we have removed public access to your account blah blah blah.
[54:59.040 --> 55:00.040]  So I'll get more into that when we come back.
[55:00.040 --> 55:06.040]  Meanwhile here's the terrorist training camps training for mass shootings at schools you name it.
[55:06.040 --> 55:13.040]  Linda source or linked to father of New Mexico Jihad who allegedly trained kids to shoot up schools on and on and on.
[55:13.040 --> 55:14.040]  So.
[55:14.040 --> 55:18.040]  First their artillery softens us up.
[55:18.040 --> 55:28.040]  And says we're fake news and they sue us and all this to add credibility to it and then they just remove us everywhere and then the famous.
[55:28.040 --> 55:42.040]  With their claims that we've done all these things we haven't done and that's how they carry it out and then Tim Cook sells off in the sunset and brings Chinese Communist style censorship here in the United States.

[59:52.040 --> 59:59.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:59.040 --> 01:00:06.040]  When I grow up I want to live in a free country in a free world.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:14.040]  I grow up I want to defeat the kingpacks.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.040]  To show how weak they are.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.040]  They're afraid of us.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.040]  They're on the wrong side of history.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.040]  We're making their move.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.040]  They bet against you.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.040]  They're betting against me.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.040]  We now take you live.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:37.040]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance you're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:01:06.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got to tell you right now I feel good to be the tip of the spear.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:11.040]  Now the enemy coming down on me like this but that's just my soul saying I'm doing the right thing.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:21.040]  Then I pull back to the 35,000 foot level and you know what this all says and I'm going to open the phones up this hour and get your take on this specific issue.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:26.040]  Do you agree that this signifies the mass censorship that the big events coming?
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:35.040]  What is the big event or group of big events that lead towards the overthrow of Trump and the march against nationalists and populist worldwide?
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.040]  They're banning free speech in France.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.040]  They're banning it in Brazil because nationalist patriots are set to win.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.040]  They're banning it in Germany because patriots are set to win.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.040]  They are just absolutely out of control.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.040]  They're totally ruthless.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:55.040]  They are allied with the most autocratic, evil, cold-blooded groups.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:05.040]  Apples had a long-term plan to censor the web along with Google and now officially struck camp in the US and moved to China.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:10.040]  And the fact that I've been ringing the alarm bell is why they're after me.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:14.040]  But they have decided to shut the country down.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:21.040]  They have decided to shut the West down because it gets in the way of their centralized control.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.040]  And all their medical experiments and playing God and believing they're going to merge with Silicon and live forever.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.040]  Tim Cook's not going to live forever.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:31.040]  Zuckerberg's not going to live forever.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:41.040]  But these guys are worth hundreds of billions of dollars and they've married themselves to the soulless communist Chinese.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.040]  And they believe they can do whatever they want.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:50.040]  They have this weird, mentally ill operating system that while China's killing gay people and following God and Christians,
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.040]  Tim Cook poses with a rainbow flag with his boyfriend.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.040]  Everything's okay.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:58.040]  And everyone goes, but he's got a rainbow and slave factories.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:02.040]  So when we come back, I'm going to read a message to Mr. Cook.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.040]  It's on infowars.com.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.040]  And I'm just asking listeners this.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.040]  I love you.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.040]  You're awesome.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.040]  Paul's put at the bottom of every article.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.040]  I'm going to ask the other folks to do this.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.040]  A link, handwritten, not just a link.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:18.040]  Oh, share here, but a link to Facebook, to Twitter, to YouTube.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.040]  Everyone in America that has a YouTube account did a video about how this was wrong.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.040]  They'd have to back off.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:31.040]  And you understand, folks, I have worked so hard in this and been so dedicated that I don't want to be taken out of the game.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.040]  And I'm going 110%.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.040]  I can't quit.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:42.040]  But you have to understand, if they, I'm going to fight, it's 110% to stay on the air and everything.
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.040]  And I think we can if you help us.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:49.040]  But if we get knocked out, I'm just upset for the country and the world because they're going after everybody already.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:55.040]  So we are the main promontory as the enemy attacks.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.040]  And we're right up front and under the main attack.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:06.040]  And I appreciate your prayers, but I pray a long time ago on air in a minute that we be lifted up like a standard against the globalist.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:13.040]  And that we be given the information and the words and the stamina to wake people up against the evil anti-human market.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.040]  The beast, one world government, Chinese social score plan that's down here.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.040]  And it's, it's happened.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.040]  We've worked with others like Drudge and other patriots.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.040]  And you really learn who's good and who's bad.
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:30.040]  Tucker Carlson is good and Michael Savage is good and a few others are good.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:41.040]  Stingram, Matt Drudge, so far Jack Dorsey and it's going to be at one hell of an adventure.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.040]  I mean, that's the thing.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.040]  This is one hell of an adventure.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:49.040]  Flying around in private jet airplanes and owning slave factories doesn't sound too fun to me.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:53.040]  Fighting the guys that own the slave factories, that's, that's, that sounds really exciting.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:58.040]  I feel good when I do that, don't you?
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:03.040]  I want to plow into all of this, that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first,
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:11.040]  just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:18.040]  or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.040]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:24.040]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:28.040]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.040]  and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.040]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.040]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.040]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.040]  infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:47.040]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.040]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:55.040]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:10.040]  Aborted babies incinerated to eat in UK hospitals.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.040]  Soilent green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of pecan.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:21.040]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:25.040]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:30.040]  What is the secret of soilent green?
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:35.040]  The powdered flesh from dead babies. Some people believe they can cure disease.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:40.040]  Because of its enormous popularity, soilent green is in short supply.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:44.040]  Remember, Tuesday is soilent green day.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:49.040]  The supply of soilent green has been exhausted. You must evacuate the area.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.040]  Today is Tuesday!
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:57.040]  It's an important rule that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group Company,
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:04.040]  are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for and the flavoring, but we already know.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.040]  So enjoy the flavor.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:11.040]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:18.040]  I'm consistently pro-death. I'm for assisted suicide. I'm for regular suicide. I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:26.040]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those ten teachers
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:34.040]  and to make that trade up in medical costs? But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:41.040]  Tell me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:55.040]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in? Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.040]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:07.040]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.040]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:18.040]  The scoops are on their way. The scoops are on their way. I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:25.040]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life. You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.040]  We've got to stop them. Come on.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:35.040]  Soylent Green is people.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:45.040]  Global government is based on dumbing you down, sucking you dry, and then blowing you out the air duct.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:58.040]  I'm just glad I'm on the good side of history. Not a perfect person, but I'm not out to f-over little people.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:03.040]  I'm not out to trip, you know, autistic kids.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:15.040]  I saw that. I was out shopping with my daughters. We can actually see some kids being mean to an autistic kid. To try to trip him, I felt like going over and saying something to him.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.040]  That'd be bully.
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.040]  Alright.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:37.040]  Yes, there's attempt to censor us because we'd already been shadow banned on Google and YouTube and other platforms like Apple didn't do anything.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:43.040]  Other than blow up in their face and send us the highest traffic we've ever had times five last week.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:52.040]  We're still huge at newswars.com and infowars.com and make our apps number one on the internet and everything else.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:09.040]  But they hit us with something just like they hit us last year, getting rid of AdRole, and it was bringing in four million dollars after costs and advertising and product, couple million dollars to fund things.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:14.040]  And that was basically the discretionary budget to expand.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:23.040]  And basic TV switchers at work right are like $50,000, you know. I mean, the equipment's expensive. Crew, everything, insurance, everything we do here.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:28.040]  We couldn't have an operation one-third as big in New York or LA. The expense is lower here.
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:38.040]  But Credio banned us. They said, oh, our general counsel said you violated our terms. Folks, we sell water filters, air filters, and supplements.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:44.040]  We never ran ads with the T-shirts, any of it.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:52.040]  Because we tried years ago as Obama as a joker on Apple's platform and they banned us and they said that's racist.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:57.040]  We're also selling a George Bush joker shirt.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:04.040]  It's anything they want to say is bad, is banned. We always knew it was coming. They've done it in Europe. It's here.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:10.040]  I told you a few years ago, we're a few years away from being arrested if you criticize radical Islam. It's here.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:19.040]  Vimeo, some dying third-rate video streaming service, just some backup who approached us years ago to put stuff on their platform,
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:25.040]  sent us a letter. I'm going to cover it next segment and said, you said there's Muslim training camps. That's not true.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:28.040]  And you made fun of Chinese people.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:36.040]  What, the ones getting killed in the death camps or committing suicide at Tim Cook's factories?
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:41.040]  And it's this new American celebration of getting me off the air.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:44.040]  Drudge has an excellent article linked.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:50.040]  Rise of corporate censorship that I forgot to read this weekend. I forgot to read it on air. I did read it.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:59.040]  From spiked, we'll talk about going against the grain, one of thousands of articles, pro-ban Alice Jones, one just saying this is dangerous. Please print that for me again.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:08.040]  You'd think Noam Chomsky coming out Saturday and saying this is very, very dangerous, me being banned by monopolies. You think that'd be anywhere?
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:19.040]  Zero. But good for Noam Chomsky. At least he stands up for what he believes in. He said he disagrees with me. You mean the straw man they built about me?
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:25.040]  So here's the big issue and the reason I'm going to open the phones up on this one issue.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:30.040]  Do you agree with me that all this massive censorship would be used against others? And of course it's now happened.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:36.040]  Do you agree they're getting ready for civil unrest, which they're already doing, and they're going to make their move on Trump in the midterms?
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:46.040]  And is it election fraud? Is it mass shootings of their facilities? Is it false flags against CNN or against Google or Apple or something?
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:53.040]  To then be blamed on us? And then I've been silenced on most platforms so I can't even speak out? And so it's been legitimized?
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:13:03.040]  What they're going to say about me? Because let me tell you, I figured out their tricks. And they can wind up, cementally yell people, and just not stop them.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:10.040]  And then direct them where they want. The same folks that lie about WMDs, the same people that lie about the Arab Spring and fund that whole thing.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:20.040]  These people are monsters and they mean business. So we need folks to take action and understand.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:28.040]  Right now we're winning because you spread the articles, you spread the videos, you went and got the apps, you went and signed up for the free podcast so we can get to you no matter what they try.
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:43.040]  The free email infowars.com forward slash email to get news alerts and videos. They're trying to keep from people getting infowars.com forward slash newsletter. They took down WebChimp with a big company that people use to follow all the email rules.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:55.040]  They're doing it to us on so many fronts. And now they took us off MEO saying we're bad to Chinese people because we don't kill them in slave factories or report them like Google does.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:14:03.040]  They can be arrested. That's mainstream news. But almost no one picks it up though. We're saying C, C, C, C. This is the sellout. This is globalism.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:11.040]  And they don't want that catching hold like it did in the election or like it's done worldwide. They've tracked it back to this broadcast.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:20.040]  And yes, this is the broadcast along with Drudge that sent us over the top. But I almost don't want to say that. It's not like I beat my chest here.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:29.040]  I'm saying, look, we did the fighting. We took action. We're taking the heat. We're your champions. And they're trying to destroy us right now.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:37.040]  People say, why don't you roll over? I'm more afraid of what happens if we roll over and they take over than what happens to me if I fight them, but we still beat them.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:46.040]  Get that. I care about my children. I care about you. I'm not a sociopath like Tim Cook, probably a psychopath or Zuckerberg.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:53.040]  I'm going to read you some quotes when we come back of him saying worse stuff than calling his users that trust him dumb ass.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:15:00.040]  He says, all you other websites are going to die and I'm going to hold your hand like hospice when you die.
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:13.040]  And I guess if your big monopoly can't kill me, you got to go pure monopoly and go after my sponsors and my advertising platform where I can't go in the marketplace and sell
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:21.040]  multivitamin fruit punch for adults and children.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:27.040]  Oh my God, I'm so evil or fish oil, the highest quality or air filtration or water filtration.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:32.040]  So listen, belly up folks to the bar here.
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:39.040]  And I know you've been buying the products, but commit sign up for auto ship every 15 days, every month, every two months, every three months, every nine months.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:45.040]  You can sign up and it just auto ships and goes through and then that'll let me budget and know what I need to do.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:57.040]  I got to make up on top of all the other lawsuits and everything else like $5 million here pretty quick to know if we can go to our next launch phase or whether I have to announce their beatings.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:01.040]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:08.040]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart and body extract.

[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:08.040]  Let's talk about down home value made in the USA blue jeans like you wore as a kid.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.040]  Remember?
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:17.040]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:50.040]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:26.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:48.040]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWarsLife.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:59.040]  Okay, so Google is officially moving to China, Wall Street Journal is reporting, they're running censorship search engines, they're building it here, they're testing it on Americans, they're already censoring everybody.
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:07.040]  Mexican radio to beam Chinese propaganda into the United States, this is just what's happening.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:22.040]  It's okay because we have our little good buddy, Tim Cook, the head of Apple and its Foxcom laboratories and all the horrible things they're doing.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:26.040]  The New York Times says he is the moral high ground.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:37.040]  So the big event, a bunch of big events, stock market crash, civil insurrection, assassination attempts on Trump, fake inward tapes.
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.040]  The left is going into overdrive right now.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:47.040]  I played videos earlier of Antifa at the White House, dozens of people saying we're going to kill Trump.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:54.040]  They wouldn't be doing the type of deplatforming and torches interference and things they're doing to InfoWars right now.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:22:00.040]  And two, all these other conservatives, nationalists and patriots, unless they had a big event planned.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:12.040]  And let me tell you, I've got from inside sources why Guilfoyle left, what they're doing to Hannity, what they're doing to Carlson, what they're doing to Ingram, they are this close to being removed.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:17.040]  And they're just looking for dirt, looking for reasons not to have the Fox audience leave them.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:25.040]  They've already heard them so bad when they ran off some of the other hosts with twisted and exaggerated things and there's nothing on Carlson and Hannity.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:29.040]  They're such family men or on Ingram, they don't know what to do.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:33.040]  They ran Matt Drudge out of there a long time ago saying you can't show pro-life stuff.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:40.040]  So Fox is owned by globalists, but they lost half their viewers a year and a half ago going after Trump.
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:45.040]  So they backed off to get their viewers back and they just don't know what to do.
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.040]  But once they make their move, they're going to make their move.
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.040]  The big event, here's the toll-free number.
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.040]  They still can't keep you from calling in.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:55.040]  They tried to ban our comments, tried to take away our email to you.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:23:01.040]  I mean, it's insane, folks, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:03.040]  We now know we weren't a test case.
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:06.040]  They're going after everybody else.
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:09.040]  What an incredible time to be alive on this subject.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.040]  What is the big event?
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.040]  Do you think I'm right?
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.040]  How do we counter this?
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:18.040]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:21.040]  Great to hear first-time callers, but everybody's welcome to call in.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:26.040]  Just have a good phone and be ready to give us your point or move the next person.
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:30.040]  Now, let's get to this article called Joseph Watson put out with some of my tweets.
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:34.040]  Alex Jones calls on Tim Cook.
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:37.040]  Alex Jones calls out Tim Cook.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.040]  So I'm calling Tim Cook out.
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:43.040]  Everything they're doing in China will come to America.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:47.040]  Infowars founder Blast Apple CEO hypocrisy.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:53.040]  Alex Jones has blasted CEO Tim Cook for spearheading big techs ban of Infowars,
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:57.040]  calling Cook a hypocrite who is trying to bring communist Chinese internet censorship to America.
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:02.040]  Last week, it was reported that Tim Cook personally made the call to ban Infowars podcast.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:05.040]  Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg then immediately followed suit.
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:11.040]  After learning of Cook's decision, Infowars founder Jones slammed Cook in a series of tweets today
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.040]  at Real Alex Jones for now.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:17.040]  It's still there, calling him the same guy who contracts with the oppressive regime in China
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:24.040]  and Foxconn factories at which mistreated workers to commit suicide at the highest rate in the world.
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:30.040]  A reference to employees who build Apple products laboring under intolerable nightmare conditions.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:35.040]  Tim Cook is proud of the fact that he orchestrated big tech silencing of Infowars
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.040]  and the media celebrated him.
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:42.040]  This is the same guy who contracts with the oppressive regime in China
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:47.040]  at Foxconn factories in which mistreats its workers to commit mass suicide.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.040]  Moral high ground, no, you don't have it.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:56.040]  Cook also styles himself as a gay rights activist yet moves Apple to China,
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:01.040]  a software that bans LGBT marches, discriminates against gays, including executing him.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.040]  Jones added.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:05.040]  Cook also styles himself as a gay rights activist.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:09.040]  But again, that's what he does.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.040]  I go on.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:16.040]  In the arbitrary silencing of Infowars, Cook is bringing communist Chinese style web control to America
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:21.040]  while Google simultaneously is building a censorship version of its search engine in China.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:26.040]  Everything they do in China will eventually come to America. Mark my words, it already is.
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:32.040]  Warren Jones.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:37.040]  He then turned his attention to Mark Zuckerberg who reportedly said privately
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:42.040]  that he doesn't care about publishers before warning them,
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:47.040]  I'll be holding your hands when you're dying business like in a hospice.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:52.040]  These are the thugs we are allowing to control the public discourse
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:58.040]  and so-called liberals celebrated. Bizarre said Jones.
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:02.040]  He finished by announcing that Infowars will be launching a meme contest
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:07.040]  based around ridiculing Cook and that the tales will follow.
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.040]  We'll be launching a meme contest based on Cook and the rampant hypocrisy.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:15.040]  Satire is the best way to ridicule corrupt authoritarian corporate bullies
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:20.040]  who have amassed way too much power over free speech until they ban that too,
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:23.040]  which they have been trying to stop memes because their AI computers
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:27.040]  have trouble seeing it, understanding it and blocking it.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:30.040]  So, you're the geniuses out there.
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:33.040]  Tweet him at Real Alex Jones.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:34.040]  Email him to show tips.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:40.040]  We're going to post him on Infowars.com and retweet him on my Twitter and at Paul's
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:47.040]  at Prison Planet of how do you show Tim Cook? Hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:53.040]  I run the richest company in the world and I pay Chinese slave laborers, you know,
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:56.040]  a dollar a day. Or I'm Tim Cook.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:59.040]  I've moved Apple to China and given your iCloud keys to their government
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:03.040]  and now I'm bringing Chinese censorship here to America and working with Google to do it.
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:06.040]  I mean, it's crazy. Hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:13.040]  The New York Times says, quote, I lead the moral high ground that Apple via Tim Cook leads the moral high ground.
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:20.040]  So, hi, I'm Tim Cook. Our company pays zero taxes in China.
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:24.040]  And we run slave factories, but I'm helping shut down free speech in America.
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:27.040]  That makes me liberal. I mean, I don't know the angle or how you say it,
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:33.040]  but this guy needs to be dealt with because he's a monster.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:36.040]  He's an absolute monster. Hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:42.040]  I'm gay, but I don't say a word to China, even though I'm the biggest company in China,
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:45.040]  about how they execute gays.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:50.040]  I mean, it was a restaurant. I have the article I'll cover it.
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.040]  I forgot to give it to you guys to print.
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:57.040]  It's like KXAN, the popular restaurant, and the governor went there and ate dinner
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.040]  and so they took a photo and posted on Facebook.
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:03.040]  And now there's been months of protesting and saying shut it down
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:07.040]  and how dare you, the gay community, so upset that you let the governor eat in there.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:12.040]  And I mean, this is the craziness of some governor's done nothing to you.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:16.040]  You don't care about China killing or Islamists is throwing gays off buildings.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:20.040]  And you know, no, no, no, it's the governor is pro God and pro Trump.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:23.040]  And so why you're letting him eat in there?
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:28.040]  So I've got that article. This is the wild eyedness.
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:32.040]  But whatever you do, get that article. Alex Jones calls out Tim Cook.
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:35.040]  Everything you're doing in China will come to America.
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:39.040]  It already is. And send that to everybody you know that's got an iPhone.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.040]  Everybody you know that has Apple devices. Everybody you know.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.040]  And just say, hey, do you know slaves built your phone?
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.040]  Hey, do you know that they're spying on everything you do?
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.040]  Hey, do you know the Chinese government runs Apple?
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:50.040]  Because that's what Cook wants to shut down.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:52.040]  He thinks he's better than you. He thinks he's smarter than you.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.040]  And he hates America.
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:59.040]  If you like alkaline water or know someone that does,

[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.040]  Your power's a weak old man.
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.040]  You can't win, Darth.
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:59.040]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:07.040]  No!
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:13.040]  Let's ignore kids!
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:17.040]  We are number one trending app in news.
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:23.040]  Number one trending. Click on that for a larger image, please.
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:25.040]  Number one trending.
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:33.040]  Guess what we are total out of thousands of news apps? We are number three total in the world
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:37.040]  surpassing CNN and Fox News.
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:43.040]  Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:49.040]  You know, there've been a lot of authoritarians come and go. They always follow the same pattern.
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:58.040]  In the Bible, in the final book, John the Revelator has the vision on the Isle of Patmos
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:05.040]  of a future with like giant insects that drop bombs and mountains of fire and world system
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:10.040]  with 20 foot high images that are holograms and speak of the world government and the one religion
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:14.040]  and if you don't serve that one world government, you cannot buy or sell
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:19.040]  and that there's basically a mark that's your digital fingerprint of your face or your hand
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:22.040]  you can buy or sell with it.
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:24.040]  And it's here.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:31.040]  We knew this was going on with the payment processors at infowarestore.com
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:34.040]  and they tried this with the NRA and lawyers got involved.
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:39.040]  It is complete racketeering, total tortuous interference.
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:43.040]  When these groups didn't say, you can't have access to the marketplace,
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:48.040]  you can't spend money, you can't, whatever, especially when, get this,
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:54.040]  they say our supplements are drugs and are illegal, basically.
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:36:00.040]  Even though we sell the exact same stuff that Amazon and then they own Whole Foods sells,
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:04.040]  some of the products that we sell at Amazon, and again I criticize Amazon,
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:07.040]  we have to be there to control the market or they can sell counterfeits on there.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.040]  So I don't plug that we're on Amazon normally.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:12.040]  It's a small business for us to fund things.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:17.040]  They took away the choice, Amazon choice.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:21.040]  So implying it's, you know, not good or something.
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.040]  There it is.
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:24.040]  Amazon seems to have quietly stopped recommending Amazon products.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:25.040]  Well, that's nothing.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:26.040]  Look what just came in.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:33.040]  Credio, where we bring in gross $3 million a year, $3,100,000.
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:37.040]  After advertising, after costs, maybe a million, $2,200,000 to fund things.
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:38.040]  That's nothing.
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:42.040]  But it's critical that last bit of money we need to expand.
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:47.040]  Just like they banned us off Adroll last year, that costs us like $4 million.
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:50.040]  And so we went somewhere else.
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:53.040]  Now, this just came in.
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.040]  Document cam please.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:58.040]  Shopify.
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:03.040]  One of our main shopping carts, they say,
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:08.040]  it says right here that you are selling pseudo pharmaceutical products.
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.040]  So I'm selling many of the exact same products, BioPQQ, CoQ10,
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.040]  but just in really high quality.
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:21.040]  Our turmeric has the highest 95% curcuminum level that you can get out of any organic factory.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.040]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:26.040]  But it's, I mean, they sell this on Amazon.
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.040]  They sell this everywhere.
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:29.040]  Pseudo pharmaceutical products.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.040]  See, it's not hate now.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:33.040]  It's just to find a pseudo, oh, you're hateful, you're banned.
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.040]  Oh, you're racist, you're banned.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:42.040]  Oh, you're, no, now it's pseudo pharmaceutical products cannot be sold through Shopify payments.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:48.040]  And then it just goes on right there saying, you're shut down.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:57.040]  Every hour it's coming in and they're hitting the servers with false reports of child porn, racism,
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:03.040]  violence, all total lies.
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:05.040]  That's where we are as a country.
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.040]  That's where we are as a culture.
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:09.040]  That's where we are ahead of the big event.
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:11.040]  And they also think you're a bunch of cowards.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:17.040]  Hey, rip Alex Jones apart in front of everyone and everyone will bow to us like communist China.
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:24.040]  China, we learned five years ago, was creating a global social score working with Google and Apple,
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:28.040]  everything you do with your purchases is what you say in the real world, what people report on you,
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:30.040]  what goes on goes into social score.
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:37.040]  And then if you drop down to three stars, you can fly on planes, buses or anything.
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:40.040]  11 million flights already banned.
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:43.040]  So people thought black mirror two years ago.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:46.040]  They kept saying watch black mirror, watch black mirror, you're talking about black mirror.
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:49.040]  We broke it five years ago at info wars.com.
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:50.040]  Pull it up.
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:54.040]  Chinese developing social score market the base for total control info wars.com.
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:59.040]  It was three years before it was any mainstream news.
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.040]  We broke the smart TVs listening and watching you.
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:04.040]  We broke the smart phones tracking and watching you 20 years ago.
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:08.040]  We broke it all because we do the research.
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:12.040]  Coming to America, China introduces credit score for obedient citizens.
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:13.040]  That's 2015.
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:14.040]  Yeah, that's not the first one.
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:18.040]  There was one in 2014.
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:22.040]  But that article is the second one to ever report it in the world.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:25.040]  We're first and second baby.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:28.040]  And by the way, I'm proud that I'm not a sellout.
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:29.040]  I'm proud.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.040]  I'm on the right side of history.
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:38.040]  I'm proud to be persecuted because China is the most murderous authoritarian system.
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:40.040]  It's killed five times what Hitler killed.
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:44.040]  And they are openly with Apple officially based there.
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.040]  Google never left.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.040]  They're using same censorship here.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.040]  They're state run.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:51.040]  This is an enemy attack.
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:53.040]  And I'm an American patriot.
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.040]  We got Trump in.
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:55.040]  Things started turning around.
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:58.040]  They're trying to stop him turning it around.
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.040]  Trump's totally surrounded.
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:01.040]  What does he do about Apple and Google?
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:02.040]  I don't know.
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:05.040]  But man, now they're saying, hey, you can't go to info wars.com and comment.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.040]  Discuss us.
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.040]  Bands us.
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.040]  Alex can't send you an email.
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:10.040]  Webchimp says we banned it.
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:12.040]  So we got another system.
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:14.040]  You can't take credit card orders.
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:23.040]  You can't spend your money in info wars.com and buy anything we say.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:27.040]  But again, we have multiple payment processors.
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.040]  That was done with just one of them.
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:32.040]  But they're all piling on all just Nazi, Nazi, Nazi.
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:33.040]  They're a Nazi.
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:34.040]  Take them down.
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:35.040]  They're a Nazi, Nazi, Nazi.
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:37.040]  You know, like the Nazis did.
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:39.040]  Not let people involve in commerce.
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:40.040]  Not let people be involved.
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:41.040]  This is what they're doing.
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.040]  This is their plan.
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:45.040]  This is their operation.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:47.040]  This is their program.
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.040]  This is really happening.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:50.040]  This is it.
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:55.040]  Everything we talked about, this is 50,000 times the censorship ever seen in this country.
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:56.040]  And it's in Europe.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.040]  They're arresting people.
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:01.040]  They talked about arresting the former mayor of London, a liberal nationalist because he
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:05.040]  said, it looks like, you know, these women are in beekeepers suits or whatever, or like
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:07.040]  they're about to rob a bank.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:14.040]  With the men walking behind them with canes telling them where to go and if a woman gets caught kissing even their husband in public, she can be executed.
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:16.040]  Where are the feminists?
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:22.040]  So we told you five years ago, there's a global social score being set up by Apple, China and Google.
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.040]  And now Bloomberg tells you, it's here.
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:27.040]  This is it.
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.040]  And I'm being dehumanized.
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:33.040]  I'm being de-platformed, literally.
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:37.040]  And the old Soviet Union, if you were a Christian or a nationalist, first you didn't have a job.
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.040]  Then you couldn't buy stuff at the store.
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:39.040]  Then you couldn't grow stuff.
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:44.040]  Then they rape your wife, kill your daughter, and ship you to a gulag.
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:48.040]  This is like the bona fide evil, baby.
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:50.040]  This isn't some facsimile.
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:51.040]  It's not a side issue.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.040]  It's not whatever.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:42:02.040]  So while infowarsstore.com is still up, while you can still even buy products from us, you might want to, while the website's still up, you might want to say, hey, this is America.
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:04.040]  This is a guy that stood up as a globalist.
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:08.040]  This is a guy that stood up for the Second Amendment in Christianity and property rights, and he's under attack.
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:14.040]  Infowars.com, even if they shut us down, Information War, you can hang up banners in your town about what's happening.
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:15.040]  You can call and talk radio.
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.040]  You can run for office.
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:19.040]  You can go talk at your city council about what's happening.
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:21.040]  Every little bit changes this.
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:27.040]  You can go to Apple stores and hand out flyers outside of them.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.040]  You can go and wake people up.
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:33.040]  You can go talk about peacefully what's happening ahead of the big event.
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:37.040]  I believe they're going to attack fake news institutions and some of these tech giants.
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:38.040]  They're preparing to attack themselves.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.040]  We already predicted this.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:44.040]  They're going to blame me, and they're going to say that legitimizes the total reign of terror.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:48.040]  They'll then probably kill the president, and we're going to go into a true dark age of hell.
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:50.040]  So this is their plan.
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:51.040]  They're moving.
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:52.040]  They're getting ready.
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:54.040]  They wouldn't be dropping the hammer if they weren't serious.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:56.040]  Stay with us, Emergency Transmission.

[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:50.040]  But whatever you do, tell folks about Infowars.com, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:55.040]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out this is the verboten info.
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:45:14.040]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:36.040]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.

[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:58.040]  I think this is a national security error. We have clear things that we do not understand how they were operating in areas that we can't control.
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:13.040]  Is this global governance at last? Is it one world with central bankers in charge?
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:19.040]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:28.040]  Russian scum denied everything. He called it all fake news. And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:34.040]  If they killed Trump or removed Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:38.040]  This is a female high-level religion.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:45.040]  We are at war with Russia. Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and Wikileaks?
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:50.040]  The White House and the President are citing Infowars.
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:57.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's endless.
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:03.040]  By the way, I'm not kissing Matt Rudge's butt, but he deserves it.
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:15.040]  He is the most pro-America, pro-West, pro-freedom icon who raised the alarm first. He's been dead on and without him, we would have already not gotten Trump elected.
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:19.040]  We'd already be done with Hillary in full command and literal persecution.
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:24.040]  They're announcing mass roundup plans, you name it. Once they get Trump out, he's linked.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:34.040]  Noam Chomsky says big tech wrong. And Paul Watson's got his article coming out soon about us kicked off of Cridio online advertising.
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:38.040]  That's the same one that is an ad agency that advertisers are used to on Drudge.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:44.040]  They go get the advertisers and bring them there. So they're going after everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:49.040]  I don't know if Drudge still uses them, but we got kicked off ad role. That's what we went to.
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:54.040]  And Paul should have the article any minute for an update for everybody about this happening.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:50:00.040]  But now they've gotten one of our payment processors down and one of our shopping carts shut down.
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:12.040]  That was our backup shopping cart. So this is just, again, you're in live time witnessing them making their move against anybody that's patriotic.
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:15.040]  And I'm going to say this because here's the deal.
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:22.040]  I'm not an Israel file. I'm not an Anglo file. I'm an American file. I mean, I'm into Americana.
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:30.040]  But I've had a lot of great Jewish friends and a lot of great, really smart people have done great things for me.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:34.040]  I've also had, you know, leftist, that would be Jewish to mean things to me, but it's like a black guys mean to me.
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:39.040]  Do I blame all blacks that they're mean or white guys mean to me? Do I blame all whites?
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:50.040]  But this whole Israel thing is like this bellwether of attacking Israel and I'm noticing everybody being taken off the air is not against Israel's right to exist.
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:57.040]  I mean, if you let the radical Islamists take over Israel, the Palestinians, they'd be killing each other forever. It'd be another destroyed area.
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:02.040]  I mean, Israel is civilization in the Middle East.
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:11.040]  Just like Gaddafi. I'm not a total fan of Gaddafi, but he worked with the West and was building up Africa and they blew that up. I mean, it's like, why blow up civilization?
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:18.040]  And I'm telling you, man, they're trying to get rid of Netanyahu, Trump, everybody because Soros documents came out in the WikiLeaks.
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:29.040]  He wants to get rid of Israel completely and they just have this plan to turn the whole planet over to third world populations and drive everything down to absolute squalor.
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:38.040]  So, and I'm only throwing that in because this is an anti-Israel system.
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:45.040]  And then I noticed when I talk about China taking over the web or all this stuff, people just in the comments on YouTube go, shut up Israel scum.
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:48.040]  And I'm like, I've never even been to Israel. I'm not anti-Israel.
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:51.040]  And I've been, you know, people used to attack me saying I was anti-Israel.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:52:02.040]  The ADL say I'm anti-Semitic in the Southern Barbery Law Center. It's all just craziness. I'm for everybody. If you're a Muslim, if you've got brown skin, white skin, if you want black skin, you want freedom, I'm into you.
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:11.040]  But if you're not into me, then I'm not into you. And so I just want to add this point in here.
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:24.040]  That the average American Jew now is a Jew-hating, crazy leftist. And I'll say that about the average American too, just black, white, doesn't matter.
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:30.040]  Like, what's so bad about America? Why does everybody want to get here if it's so bad?
[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:33.040]  And everything that made the country great is dying right now.
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:55.040]  Trump is like trying to restore it, and you see how angry they are. And Bill Maher is a great example, running around how he doesn't believe in God, how much he loves suicide, how he wants everybody to die, how he loves abortion, how he loves assisted suicide, you know, how much he wants America to implode so that we get rid of Trump, because he's worth $100 million.
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:53:04.040]  All right, I'm going to start the next hour and go right to your phone calls. Will you guys launch the call board in here for me? Thanks. Just launch that form as I see the callers. Thank you.
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:11.040]  And what else is going on while all this is happening? You've got Amarosa.
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:24.040]  Amarosa illegally taping stuff in the Situation Room, you know, when she's getting fired, running around doing all her reality TV drama queen crap.
[01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:30.040]  Trump says they're going to retaliate. She begged for her job, had tears in her eyes.
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:47.040]  Stormy Daniels confirmed for Celebrity Big Brother. This is all just liars, in my view, that goes say and do all this so they can get the establishment to give them their 10 minutes of fame. It's sick.
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:54.040]  And then she says, you know, the headline is she heard the inward tape and then low, no, she knew someone that heard the inward tape.
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:54:01.040]  Meanwhile, they've got Adobe software. They developed three years ago. They had a lot of other software, too, that 100% can beat voice print analysis.
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:12.040]  Where if you get 30 seconds of someone recorded, clearly, if you had me talking about how Info Wars has been banned and how we're under attack and how, you know, Tim Cook's out of control.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:21.040]  And, you know, looking into the big moral authority when he's covering his monstrous activities as this big Chinese chai-kong kingpin with a sellout of the country.
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:31.040]  You could take that and have me say Mary Poppins flew into my bedroom last night, flying a purple carpet with six dolphins pulling her named Snap, Papal and Glooblet.
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:47.040]  That's total gibberish, but you could have me say all that with that program. And they put it on the market for some testing and pulled it back from reviewers because it was so dangerous and could break voice print.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:54.040]  We did videos on it a couple of years ago, but those have all been deleted by, you guessed it.
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:55:06.040]  Old YouTube. So you got to go to infowars.com. You got to go there where we're now every day taking our most powerful clips and we're going to create an area on the site that's basically banned videos of the day and the day.
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:16.040]  And then everyone's free to air for your TV station, your radio show, your own podcast, your own YouTube, your own Facebook to take it, edit it, whatever you want with it and say, here's the verboten information.
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:25.040]  Here's your analysis of it. They're going to try to say you can't do that, but you can. They're trying to de-platform my voice from the web. How many times did I tell you that was coming?
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:33.040]  And they have technology where they can voice print my voice and then ban my voice being heard on their platforms.
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:41.040]  But let's see if we can push them to that point. But that's what they're doing testing it in China and testing it over here and it's been announced.
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:49.040]  This is it. Fight the bullies, save the internet, save info war. Super special. We already had this sale going because all the censorship, they're trying to take our payment processors.
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:59.040]  They've taken one. They are taking everything from us. We've got IT scrambling around the clock just to keep the websites up, just to deal with the false complaints, just to deal with this.
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:06.040]  And listen, I'm not bitching. I wasn't looking for an easy way here. I wanted to change the world, but we're in a fight now. This is your fight.
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:19.040]  This isn't Fortnite. This isn't Pac-Man. This isn't Zelda. This isn't World of Warcraft, baby. This is third dimension warfare for the planet's future and humans' future on terra firma.
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:26.040]  And we're here fighting for the Renaissance and a pro-human future where we believe in your free will. And we're here fighting hard. We're energized by God's spirit.
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:32.040]  And we feel good that we're under enemy attack. That means we're directly over the target and I'm bombs away, bombs away.
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:44.040]  It's like, what are we going to attack the most for? Chemicals in the water, breaking up the family, world government, Apple, Google, moving to China, oppressing their people, bringing censorship here, already implementing it, 93%.
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:52.040]  Already strangling us down to nothing. No one knowing this is incremental. I've got to go in. I've got to point out the chai comms. I've got to point out the globalist. I've got to point it in.
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:57:01.040]  And the more I go to that, it's just total fires. And I just steer into it because that's how you win. And they're blowing holes in our wings and we're on fire.
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:07.040]  We're just boom, boom, boom. We have unlimited truth bombs. We're just drop, drop, drop, drop, drop. And we fly back over, turn back in.
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:13.040]  And we're just like, they're just coming at us. We try to take my kids out of the woodwork. It's like Agent Smith dealing with possession.
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:20.040]  People on the street see me and just act normal and go, I'm going to attack me. And it's just like, and it doesn't make me scared. It's like, okay, God's real. Jesus is real.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:26.040]  We've got a whole future. We've got to do this. God, mark of the beast. It's all happening. We've got to fight for what's right. God's real.
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:35.040]  Revelation is real. Thank God we know. Thank God we know Jesus. Thank God we know the truth. Thank God we're taking action. Thank God as bad as it gets. Thank God.
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.040]  Thank God.
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:43.040]  But whatever you do, spread the links, spread the articles. Info Wars is the future. It is your freedom. It is the truth.
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:47.040]  But we need your support and we need you to buy products so we can hold on and fight.
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:57.040]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage. And that's why we need you to go to the site now if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals.
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:17.040]  Please consider a contribution. 25, 50, 100, 250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:27.040]  Hey, how would you like to take Info Wars with you wherever you go? Well, now you could do just that with the new official Info Wars app. And here's the best part.

[01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:58.040]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:06.040]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:14.040]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:17.040]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:26.040]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:38.040]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, poudarco bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful microbalancing properties.
[01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:56.040]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com. That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:19.040]  And the heart of the resistance, rallying Patriots worldwide.
[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:22.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:32.040]  You know, the other night, the devil dropped by.
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:40.040]  I swam the door in his face.
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:45.040]  Oh, the devil's pretty.
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:48.040]  But it's only skin deep.
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:52.040]  The devil like a big old snake says, look into my eyes.
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:54.040]  I looked.
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:57.040]  I said, no.
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:03.040]  You're about to receive.
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:06.040]  God gives us everything we need.
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:07.040]  Not you.
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:13.040]  You distort everything.
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:18.040]  Hang on to the good times.
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:26.040]  We have been running on everything our ancestors built with their will, their good will, and their strength.
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:28.040]  The bell is about to rock.
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:30.040]  We salute you.
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:38.040]  You can feel the pro-human energy coming back in the world, and it's spiritual, and nothing can stop it.
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:40.040]  We're gonna win, folks.
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:45.040]  Our spirit is a trillion times stronger than the enemy's.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:53.040]  The problem is, most people get captured in this globalist paradigm.
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:59.040]  You know, I'm very positive because the enemy's attacking us, and I know I've been dead on about my analysis.
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:03.040]  And I opened the phones up, and I said, I specifically want to know about the big event, though we shouldn't be too confident.
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:05.040]  They're gonna launch major stuff.
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:10.040]  I believe false flags against themselves to be the victims and to legitimize all the censorship, and they're going for broke and they're desperate.
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:13.040]  And I see the callers are all over the map.
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:15.040]  It's fine. Support from a fan, support from fan.
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:19.040]  What the new move of the Dems is, that's the kind of question I want.
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:21.040]  I want to hear what you're saying.
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:25.040]  Complaints about Facebook, Marcus, censorship, and what's next.
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:27.040]  It's people saying they've been censored and I get it.
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:29.040]  We're gonna go to everybody, but bam, bam, bam.
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:35.040]  And people are saying, man, they're trying to ban your payment processors in R.
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:37.040]  They're shutting down everything you got.
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:39.040]  All this, why are you so happy?
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:45.040]  Because we've got, I don't know, five times our record traffic.
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:49.040]  It isn't about me getting that traffic.
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:51.040]  It shows you get what's happening.
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:57.040]  And just look at Matt Drudge how great he is.
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:01.040]  I mean, for two days, Drudge probably wasn't listening or would have been up there.
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:05.040]  Noam Chomsky came out and said, this is very dangerous monopolies.
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:07.040]  And, you know, he's the big guru of the left.
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:09.040]  No one would pick it up because they know it's powerful.
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:11.040]  Well, Drudge just linked to it.
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:13.040]  That's a very, very important article.
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:16.040]  And during a break earlier, I wrote a little comment.
[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:19.040]  I'm going to add to the article and update.
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:22.040]  That's going to get added very, very soon, but that's on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:28.040]  And, you know, I'm going to feel good here because they haven't run a year and a half demonization program against Drudge.
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:33.040]  They've done some demonization.
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:36.040]  But I feel good knowing there's people like Drudge out there.
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:43.040]  I mean, I feel good seeing Tucker Carlson knock it out of the park and being so accurate.
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:48.040]  John Hannity now, way more awake than he used to be, I mean, and Lou Dobbs and Laura Ingram and to know that's still there.
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:51.040]  And we're still strong enough as people that are awake to have that.
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:04:02.040]  But then I learned the behind the scenes of how they're trying to take them all off the air and how they're harassing them and what they're going through and how it's all intensifying.
[02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:10.040]  And how everybody's getting harassed and everybody's getting messed with and everybody's getting, I mean, this is bad, folks.
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:13.040]  And so I want to ask you when we come back, what's the big event?
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:15.040]  We all know they're going to try to overthrow Trump.
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:17.040]  Economically, they're trying to crash things they admit.
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:19.040]  They're trying to start big wars.
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:25.040]  It's only, there's articleinforwards.com by Steve Watson out of Politico about how only Rand Paul's keeping him from launching war with Iran.
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:27.040]  Iran's begging for it.
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:30.040]  That'll trigger terror squads all over.
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:34.040]  It's just, we're in an incredibly volatile time.
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:38.040]  And so I'm getting all excited knowing I'm over the target.
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:45.040]  But at the same time, then I got to think, no, wait a minute, they wouldn't be pulling this unless they got something big planned.
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:51.040]  So we need to have a brainstorm in 60 seconds on this info wars.com, news wars.com.
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:05:17.040]  If they're able to bring down info wars, news wars, news wars, news wars.
[02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:25.040]  Go to infowars.com,
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:28.040]  forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast.
[02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:32.040]  Just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:42.040]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter and give us your emails so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:49.040]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com, forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps,
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:53.040]  how they can then reach out to others with the information coin out.
[02:05:53.040 --> 02:06:22.040]  This is the verboten info, this is what they don't want you to see.
[02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:28.040]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too.
[02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:33.040]  The fire musket, but I'll run you through.
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:07:01.040]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too.
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:10.040]  You'll take my life, but I'll run you through.
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:12.040]  All right, let's get to your phone calls right now.
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:14.040]  Have you just joined us?
[02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:22.040]  We have major espionage by the mainstream media in the globalist and chat coms with their made for TV operatives begging and slithering and then causing all the.
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:31.040]  I mean, I was told we had Roger Stone on with other sources about this lady who's now recorded things and violated federal law.
[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:40.040]  And it was like, oh my God, reportedly she was involved in the sucking off of Haiti and just the democratic operative everything.
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:47.040]  But Trump has a sweet spot for charismatic and looking women, black women included, because he's so racist, let me tell you.
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:56.040]  And it's not like he wants to try to have sex with them. It's just that, you know, he likes women and he wants a bunch of women in his cabinet.
[02:07:56.040 --> 02:08:02.040]  And that's just the way it is. And he put searches out. That's why he had Kelly. Kelly first got in a year ago.
[02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:09.040]  Kelly's like, we want black applicants. We know there are blacks out there. Why aren't you applying?
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:16.040]  We know there are blacks out there that are up to stuff and who have the requirements.
[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:25.040]  Kelly. Hey, it's like we put ads out until lately and no black folks put it in for him because, you know, the Tea Party is racist and Alan Jones is racist.
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:30.040]  It's totally made up.
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:36.040]  So Trump's like trying to do all this and then of course they got to her.
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:40.040]  And she reportedly started trouble and did all sorts of sabotage for the beginning.
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:46.040]  And they just called around. They're like, you know, what is your problem?
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:56.040]  But see, a lot of these folks that were originally liberals, I don't care whether they are.
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:09:06.040]  Stormy Daniels or this later anybody, they want the attention of mainstream news. They think when they walk out on the view.
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:11.040]  The view shot in the studio like rotting walls and a bunch of people look like they're half dead.
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:14.040]  It's like you're like in the Crip Keeper tomb or something.
[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:18.040]  That's what I'm saying. They have nothing to offer. They are nothing. It's all a joke.
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:24.040]  But most people though, oh my God, Hollywood. Oh my God, a director's house. Oh my God. Oh my God.
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:31.040]  And it's just pathetic to watch people line up like Tom Arnold and tell all these lies.
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:39.040]  And, you know, I never even played the clip last week. I should have played it with Rosie O'Donnell on TV like last Monday, like eight, nine days ago.
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:47.040]  And she's on CNN and she goes, no one is real at his rallies. It's all fake. He's unpopular. They're all actors.
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:52.040]  Now they're always saying, I'm saying everybody's actors and I deserve to be taken off the air for it when I'm not.
[02:09:52.040 --> 02:10:02.040]  But they just caught ABC News covered over the weekend with actors in a piece where people in Trump hats kick people within peach shirts out.
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:11.040]  When in reality, that's them. And they know everybody's getting turned off by their bullying, so they just produce.
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:20.040]  That's coming up to a bad time. I just got so much fake videos.
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:25.040]  That's what I'm telling you. They got something big planned. Something big's coming.
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:29.040]  They don't want me questioning mass shootings. They don't want me questioning terror attacks.
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:35.040]  They're trying to just desperately, you know how, how I, I mean, I don't want to win these lawsuits. I don't have time to mess with it.
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:38.040]  We're in too big a war right now. That's not what we're...
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:41.040]  I'm gonna have to follow some emergency injunctions and I've to get the lawyers follow the suits right now.
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:45.040]  I mean, I have to do it now. It's survival. Try to take our payment processors, everything right now.
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:53.040]  Servers, the sites you're barely hanging on.
[02:10:53.040 --> 02:11:00.040]  And again, the issue is something big's coming. They don't want us on air to question it when it goes down.
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:06.040]  Everyone knows it. Two plus two equals four. What is it? We need citizens with cameras all the time.
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:11.040]  We need people ready to upload all the time to multiple sources. You see a terror attack, go get video.
[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:16.040]  Something happens, you get there. But I'm telling you, they are planning something big to legitimize all this
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:20.040]  and take down America's recovery and all I want to do is beat them.
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:25.040]  I'm not worried about me. That's my biggest problem is that we're a key outpost in this and I need your financial help.
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:29.040]  While the shopping carts are still up and while you still want the great products,
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:33.040]  as the shopping carts will be up, it's the payment processors. Your payment goes through, it'll be good.
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:36.040]  And then we'll have to do some lawsuits and junctions. You'll have to mail it in for a while.
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:39.040]  We're already ready for that. Try to operate. But it's that bad, folks.
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:45.040]  Tortoise interference, racketeering, mafia tactics, beyond what they did to blacks in the south in the 50s and 60s.
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:50.040]  I mean, they are trying to suppress us and grind us into the ground and drive us into the ground.
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:56.040]  And I got such a fight spirit that I'm actually in euphoria right now and it's not good.
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:00.040]  It's a positive I have, but it's also not a positive.
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:05.040]  I know I'm over the target right now, so I'm drooling because I want to take the target out,
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:11.040]  but I need you to realize they're cutting us up really bad right now. And it's the euphoria being cut up.
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:15.040]  And these crazy maniacs don't know it, and everybody else right after it does.
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:21.040]  The Google rollouts, the censorship, it's all here. So we have a Supercell going, infowarstore.com.
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:28.040]  We have the best fish oil, the best krill oil, the best honor rolls, the concentrated fish oils that are good for your kids' brains,
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.040]  and the others are good for everything. That's well-known documented.
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:38.040]  That's 40% off. 40% off X2, the amazing deep earth crystal halogen that we may not be able to get soon
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:42.040]  because they're gouging the prices of it, just who the hell knows. These are all amazing products.
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:46.040]  It's just all in today. Go in there and make some big orders, infowarstore.com,
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:50.040]  to give me a gauge of how much you're going to support us into this.
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:55.040]  And it's not like a challenge. We're like, oh, you better. I'm trying to like gauge here.
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:59.040]  We're like, we are literally being bombarded. And I'm like, well, do people get it?
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:04.040]  Do they know this is the time to support? This is the time to pray for us too.
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:07.040]  That's the most important thing, and to share the articles and the videos.
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:12.040]  And they just sent us a letter saying your 35,000 videos will be deleted.
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:15.040]  I've got the date right here. I think it's the end of the month.
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:20.040]  And it's like that gets to me though, because I love those videos. I love those articles.
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:25.040]  I love the work we put in and how they kept growing and millions of people watching them every day.
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:32.040]  And it's just they're going to burn it all. Burn it. Just like China does to the Christians.
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:36.040]  After they take all their organs and set their blood out.
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:43.040]  They take the fat and put it in college and for women's injections.
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:46.040]  I mean, how do we think we're not cursed when we're doing that?
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:50.040]  And Tim Cook though, he's virtually signaling, Alex is hateful. He's bad.
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:54.040]  He reported on us moving to China. Shut him up.
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:59.040]  But I'm seeing articles about universities with Chinese agents caught in Chinese radio transmitters
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:03.040]  beaming Chinese Communist propaganda into Chinese Americans in Southern California.
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:08.040]  And Chinese caught, you know, printing notes and, you know, they counterfeit our money.
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:11.040]  They don't just supply the world with their currency for other countries.
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:17.040]  They're also printing the notes so they can, you know, the biggest counterfeiters on the planet.
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:22.040]  And, you know, and five million Chinese women have come here the last two years to have their babies for free
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:26.040]  and have it all paid for. We're a giant joke.
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:31.040]  And Trump's trying to just put up a basic negotiation so they use lubrication.
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:36.040]  They're like, no, dude, we're using sandpaper because the whole religion is hating America
[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:42.040]  because the devil sees it as the seeds of the revolution against the system of the mark of the beast.
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:48.040]  And we were a Christian nation. And because we were a Christian nation, we are now marked for death.
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:52.040]  I said, I go to your calls. We'll come back and go right to them or they can come punch me in the face.
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:56.040]  And we have a guest joining us. I don't know what to do anymore. It's just such an insane time.
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:03.040]  I'll probably end up taking over the fourth hour, but Salente has a lot to say to infowars.com, newswars.com.
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:07.040]  I haven't even told the Jack Dorsey stories. You know, I got a call Saturday and I got a call this morning
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:11.040]  and they're like, listen, unless Jack Dorsey's a really good liar, he's an introvert.
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:15.040]  He's really shy. He's really smart. And he is a liberal.
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:20.040]  And he believes in original liberal ideas, but he is scared of the burn.
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:28.040]  The conservatives beat everybody up, take their speech to and he legitimately does not.
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:33.040]  It's scared. And I got one call this weekend and I said, Dorsey, tell you, call me.
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:37.040]  No, you just need to know. Then I got another call.
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:42.040]  And then I put a call into some of our White House sources and they, they, they have it called me back in a few days.
[02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:45.040]  So there's a lot going on, ladies and gentlemen. And I don't know.
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:47.040]  I just know I'm going to try to be true to God and the truth.
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:53.040]  And this is one hell of a time at infowars and maybe shut down any time they're battling to shut us down right now.
[02:15:53.040 --> 02:16:22.040]  They may send who knows who in here.
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:25.040]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:57.040]  Get the ultimate knife at an ultimate price.
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:17:01.040]  The Fox Karambit knife finally available in the U.S.
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:10.040]  The Fox Karambit knife opens with one hand faster than you can pull a handgun for utility, for defense and for way less than other knives of this caliber.

[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:22.040]  Supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word. You are the info war.
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:31.040]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email.
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:38.040]  So there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:46.040]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:53.040]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:19:22.040]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:31.040]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:41.040]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:48.040]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:58.040]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and infowarslife.com.
[02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:07.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:16.040]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:24.040]  Alright, we're back live. The article just went live on infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watson showing screenshots of tailing what I told you earlier.
[02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:29.040]  Ad platform, caves to mob outrage, bands, info wars.
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:32.040]  So honesty is my only policy.
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:38.040]  And so their hits against us only made us bigger thanks to Drudge and others and thanks to you.
[02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:48.040]  Making away the second ad platform in a year and a half that took away Adroll before is a crippling blow of $3 million.
[02:20:48.040 --> 02:20:53.040]  That's not money I make. That was money to fund things. It takes a lot to fund this.
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:21:01.040]  You know, little local TV stations cost $5 million a year to run. This baby costs like 30 something million or more.
[02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:07.040]  So infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, get in there, buy the products, whatever you do because it's on.
[02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:10.040]  So Paul Watson's article is up on infowars.com right now.
[02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:13.040]  Okay, we're going to go to your calls. I apologize for making you hold 30 minutes. I had a lot to cover.
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:18.040]  Laura Limbers popping in for a segment about these Islamists is running and then assaulting her.
[02:21:18.040 --> 02:21:22.040]  It's on video. We're going to show the video and then Facebook Bander.
[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:27.040]  So that's all coming up right now. Let's go to Carter and Texas. Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:34.040]  What do you make of this epic time? Do you agree with me that the fact that they would do stuff this bold shows they're getting ready to do something big?
[02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:41.040]  Alice, I agree with you 100%. You've been spot on for years. You told us about 9-11.
[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:50.040]  And I think what we're going to see here is I believe that we're going to see more school shootings because they've got to distract us from what's going on,
[02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:59.040]  what's the battle that's going on right now at an international scale. We're seeing people all over the world rising up and exposing things.
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:04.040]  I mean, we've had to do true fair in the heart of this and over there in Belgium.
[02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:10.040]  No, you're right. I was told by Google and Vimeo and others, you claim there's Muslims planning mass shootings.
[02:22:10.040 --> 02:22:17.040]  That's completely confirmed. It's the true stuff. Like when Congress said, Paul Watson lied and said a Muslim ran over folks in New York.
[02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:19.040]  It was true.
[02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:30.040]  Yeah, there's Muslim camps all. There's extremist Islamic camps all over across America, United States and Canada. I mean, this has been exposed for years now.
[02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:36.040]  And nothing has been done about it during the Obama administration. They've been flooding through Mexico.
[02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:50.040]  No, I totally agree. So we got CHICOM radio stations, 50,000 watts beaming into the U.S. CHICOM operatives, clearly Cook and Google think they're going to win. They've moved. They're taking us down because we're reporting that.
[02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:58.040]  Exactly. And they can't have you. They can't have you exposing that the Satanic system that's being created is losing power right now.
[02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:07.040]  And they're desperate to maintain their power so that they can. They've been trying to institute the Antichrist, the beast system, the false.
[02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:15.040]  Listen, listen, even people don't believe the Bible. You're absolutely right, Carter. China is creating a global social score with Apple and Google now coming to the U.S.
[02:23:15.040 --> 02:23:21.040]  Where if you don't serve them and say what they want, you're not allowed to have a job. I've been kicked off LinkedIn.
[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:28.040]  No banking. No, no, you starve to death in China now. They are literally bringing this year and it's being hailed by the left. God bless you.
[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:38.040]  I mean, that's so sensational. You can't even describe it. It's total control. Thank you, Carter.
[02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:44.040]  Who's up next here? Marcus in Texas. Another call from Tejas. Marcus, you're on the air. God bless you.
[02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:55.040]  Yeah, I just want to say I work at a paintball shop in in Louisville, Texas, and I run the door at this paintball shop and I've got a microphone in my hand.
[02:23:55.040 --> 02:24:06.040]  And when the lobby gets nice and full, I like to just flip the microphone on and say Alex Jones being censored. You're next. Alex Jones is being censored. You're next.
[02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:15.040]  And you know what? I got a little bit of trouble, but I think it's worth it. I think everybody to get out there. They need to start screaming about it. They need to start getting pissed off. Excuse me.
[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:17.040]  I'm a little mad.
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:29.040]  Brother, I am too. We got trillion dollar companies out loud with China that since Christians to have their organs taken and kills gays for no reason, we got weird day activists like Tim Cook saying it's OK.
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:36.040]  Yeah. And and how long have you been saying? How long have you been saying this is coming? How long have we been asked for Frank's help?
[02:24:36.040 --> 02:24:45.040]  Matt Drudge met with top government officials and they said if Hillary wins, the Internet's going to be banned. And it's all happening. They don't care that Hillary lost. They're going ahead with it.
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:57.040]  Exactly. And I want to tell you what's next. What's next is they are going to do a false flag and they need you off the air because what happened last time, whenever you thought that basically you called Vegas.
[02:24:57.040 --> 02:24:59.040]  And that's one of one of many.
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:06.040]  I called Vegas that day. I said they're going to shoot up a rock and roll event or something probably like 10 at night to get people leaving.
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:13.040]  I literally just grabbed us out of the ether. I can't explain it because it's all data, but then there's something, something extra, a little bit of a six cents there.
[02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:23.040]  But but everybody's been saying, I think they're going to hit their own facility CNN, MSNBC, Google, Apple, they're going to hit them and then blame us. I think that's what they're going to do.
[02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:32.040]  They will. They will hit you. They will hit their own facility. It's just like the weird YouTube lady who was the first woman, the first woman mass shooter, but I was down there.
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:33.040]  I was down there.
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:41.040]  I agree. That was a trial run to get all their people scared and to have the security drills going so it's all compartmentalized when they do it for real.
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:48.040]  Yep, exactly. Set the president so that the policy within the company can be set so that everybody knows how to act.
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:56.040]  But we've got I went down there during during the bill Clinton protest and I met Owen. I've added Owen on Twitter. Owen added me on Twitter.
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:26:02.040]  I made a report. I sent it to Owen. I'm going to make a bunch more reports. I think a lot of the other info.
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:10.040]  Well, that's the answer. Everybody go on to Facebook, say you're a Democrat, say you're a liberal at first to block their AI, put out some, you know, dis info.
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:19.040]  And then when it comes time, hit them with live feeds, hit them with everything and that's how we'll sabotage their AI. They're all counting on you being lazy.
[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:22.040]  You take action. Nothing can stop you.
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:32.040]  One more thing I have to ask. You remember how you were talking about and I know there's a lot more important things going on, but if you still want to do the art department.
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:39.040]  Brother, I do that to because people love art. They love a piece of quality. It goes up in value. We can put out limited stuff, funder operation.
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:41.040]  So, yes, I do want to do that.
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:48.040]  I have at least 10 anti-globalist songs that are very good.
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:56.040]  Send it to us. I want to do it all right now. We're just, I'm watching that show Pacific from what I've read and talked to folks in the Pacific conflict. It was very accurate.
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:27:02.040]  And I kind of got like Japanese soldiers trying to ban at me right now, but I'm kind of waiting.
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:07.040]  I'm going from expansion mode to just hold the fort mode, but I hear you. God bless you, Marcus.
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:14.040]  Let's do one more. Plan to make a difference, censorship, false flags. Let's go to Jeffrey and we'll go to others as well. Love you all.
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:17.040]  Jeffrey in New York are on the air. Go ahead.
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:19.040]  Hey, Alex. Can you hear everybody?
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:21.040]  Yes, sir. Thanks for calling.
[02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:25.040]  Hey, red alert. You are absolutely on target.
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:32.040]  It's huge and we need to stop it before it happens. If it happens, I think it'll be too late.
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:39.040]  If the false flags start to happen, I think it'll be too late because they have all sorts of technology.
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:50.040]  The geospatial information that they have with Google, the direct energy weapons, the scalar wave weapons, the non-lethal ride control weapons.
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:58.040]  Well, that's why they were so confident. They did the handover to the Chai comms and they thought Hillary get in, but Patriots blocked it.
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:05.040]  And then they openly tried to intimidate cops by killing them everywhere. They only made the cops wake up and join America.
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:12.040]  Let me tell you something. They don't have full control of these agencies, though, man. A lot of the folks for Patriots in there, that's why they're scared right now.
[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:18.040]  Well, they don't, but a lot of these agencies aren't even in control of the United States military.
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:23.040]  Oh, I totally agree. Let me tell you. That's why the globalists hate the military so much.
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:30.040]  The average military man and woman is still loyal to the country. That's why they can't crack that group.
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:33.040]  That's why they're so pissed right now. What do you think?
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:36.040]  I agree. I agree. Thanks for giving me a platform.
[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:40.040]  Oh, thank you, brother. Thank you for holding it and putting it up with my crap.
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:47.040]  Woo! I tell you, man. Let me tell you. I mean, the censorship is unbelievable. They're trying to shut us down right now. Everything we're doing is under attack.
[02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:53.040]  Pray for M4s. That's the most important thing you can do. We'll be back with Laura Lummer, who just got banned as well.

[02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:18.040]  This is it, boys and girls. Ta-da-ta-da.
[02:33:18.040 --> 02:33:31.040]  Mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:43.040]  You are watching Apple and Google move to China and admit they're censoring Chinese and Americans. You are witnessing Soros' plan to overthrow Europe, Israel, the U.S., and literally create a third world hellstorm.
[02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:55.040]  Happen. You are witnessing Operation Chaos in full swing. Laura Lemurs with us for this segment, part of the next. I'll get to all the callers that are holding about the big event and what they're planning.
[02:33:55.040 --> 02:34:05.040]  But you've got the Democrats looking at demographically 1.8 billion Muslims. I can't go to any of their countries and live. Nothing against the Muslims, they just want to kill me. That's a fact.
[02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:16.040]  And the big third rail of San Francisco and big tech is don't talk about the Muslims. I was told by New York Times reporter in an off-record meeting a year ago, this isn't really about a report.
[02:34:16.040 --> 02:34:29.040]  Leave the Muslims alone or you'll be destroyed. I'm like, what? They're good people. And the person telling me this was Jewish.
[02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:41.040]  And I'm going, mm-hmm. Can I go to Saudi Arabia or anywhere? Or anywhere there was a non-radical Muslim, they've been overthrown? I mean, what's the game plan? Just there. It's good, Alex. It's loving.
[02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:46.040]  If you need to go along with it and we'll leave you alone. Well, I'm not leaving you alone.
[02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:54.040]  Then I got told, leave Soros alone for being a Nazi collaborator. Thank God, as soon as this film at the end exposes all that. And it's just like, these people are crazy.
[02:34:54.040 --> 02:35:00.040]  And so I love the Muslims. Most Muslims are being killed by their Muslims. I just want to live in peace.
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:16.040]  But Laura Loomer has had her finger on the pulses of independent investigative journalists with a lot of courage going out there and ferreting out what happened. And all over the country, especially in Michigan and New York and other areas, they have Islamists set to win.
[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:25.040]  Everybody's focusing on the socialist Alexandria Cortez. And my God, that woman's as dumb as a box of rocks. These Islamists are smart.
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:33.040]  So she goes in just like Democrats go and hit people in the head with bike locks. She didn't do that. She goes into the event last night. Facebook bans her for it.
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:47.040]  We've still got the Twitter will play whenever she's ready. And she starts trying to talk to these women who are in bed with Linda Sorcerer, who's got her family with the Muslim training camps or about the attack of schools reportedly.
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:59.040]  And she's calling for Jihad overthrow of Trump. And she's asking real questions, a woman by herself with men grabbing on her and women grabbing on her and all this. And then she gets to lead it off Facebook, showing you where Zuckerberg is.
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:12.040]  There's about to be three billion Muslims. And Europe says and the EU says and the UN says that's the replacement. Well, okay, but I'm not the food is the issue.
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:22.040]  So joining us is Laura Loomer. Let's eliminate the truth with her website. She's still on Twitter for now and talk about Jack Dorsey.
[02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:30.040]  She's getting out of make Jack Dorsey's the hero here. But my God, he's got rid of a lot of folks, but Laura Loomer's still there. Laura, thanks for coming on with this.
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:37.040]  Boil down who the players are what's happening. And the fact that the media really is working hard to cover this up.
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:49.040]  Thanks so much for having me, Alex. Yeah, so there are currently 90 Muslims who are running for office running for Congress here in the United States across the country during the 2018 midterms.
[02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:58.040]  Several of those candidates include Ilhan Omar who's running to replace Keith Ellison seat in the fifth congressional district here in Minnesota.
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:09.040]  And then you have Rashida Talib, who recently won her primary in Michigan. So now she's running uncontested and she will be the first Palestinian Muslim woman elected to Congress.
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:17.040]  Then you have Keith Ellison, who was the first Muslim elected to Congress. And then Abdul El Said, who is a Muslim Brotherhood affiliate.
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:31.040]  And he lost his election in Governor thanks for governor thanks to me and my investigation. But it's really concerning because, as you mentioned, a lot of these candidates are campaigning with Linda Sarsour and they've been endorsed by care, which is the Council on American
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:45.040]  Islam. And we're going to talk about that. But let me just go back in a rabbit because you brought something up central. We're not tooting our horn. The reason you're getting banned and I'm getting banned and others, we're effective. And you've been credited with doing the original reports that finally got out nationally and exposed.
[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:55.040]  These people are like involved in all this stuff. So you're like one lone woman by yourself. And then now Facebook Zuckerberg comes into ban you.
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:38:11.040]  Yeah, so I went to Ilhan's event the other night here in Minnesota where I am right now investigating Jihad on the ground. And Rashida was there for this joint campaign event. And I started asking them, I said, Why did you guys vote against legislation that would have made FGM a felony?
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:22.040]  Why did you guys vote against legislation that would have stopped insurance payments to the family members of terrorists? Why did you marry your brother Ilhan? She married her brother to commit immigration fraud, of course.
[02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:32.040]  But why do you guys hate Jews? Why do you hate Israel so much? Is Hamas a terrorist organization? Why are you campaigning with Linda Sarsour who called for Jihad against President Trump?
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:44.040]  Imports and questions that the American people deserve answers to that the mainstream media will never ask people like Linda Sarsour or any of these Muslim candidates running for office because they're too scared of being labeled as Islamophobes as
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:53.040]  this is bigots. You name it, right? But what I want to know, when did it become illegal in the United States to ask a Muslim a question or to criticize a Jihadi?
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:39:06.040]  Well, ask Tommy Robinson then after two and a half months in solitary confinement losing 40 pounds or me. They're taking our payment processors, our email, our comments. We are under unmitigated attack right now.
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:15.040]  Yeah, I know. And so less than eight hours after I posted the video, I got a message from Facebook saying that my Facebook was unpublished and I'm not going to be able to post anything for 30 days.
[02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:21.040]  So I got a 30 day ban, which of course is a way to silence conservatives like yourself.
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:28.040]  They're doing it to everyone ahead of the midterms. And I like Trump. But let me tell you, I've gotten messages to him and I know for a fact he knows this.
[02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:37.040]  And he met with Tim Cook days after I got this. I mean, and Trump needs to get on this man that they are stealing the election now.
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:43.040]  They're giving billions in campaign contributions to the Democrats because if you block conservatives, it's the same as an ad for them.
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:47.040]  I mean, Trump needs to get it together right now.
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:40:00.040]  I agree. And I also think that Brad Pascal, who's going to be working on Trump's campaign as his campaign manager, really needs to, you know, start calling for congressional action on this as well, because this is exactly what you set out.
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:09.040]  It's the Democrats away. It's big tech's way to shut down conservatives ahead of the midterms in order to influence American politics in the election.
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:13.040]  I mean, you want to talk about collusion. Forget about the Russians. All right, there's nothing to see there.
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:19.040]  The real collusion is big tech companies literally taking the side of the Democrats who are campaigning with jihadis.
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:34.040]  Linda Sarsour, she said that her mentor and her favorite person is the father of the jihadi who was just arrested in New Mexico for training 11 kids who he kidnapped and starved to be school shooters.
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:45.040]  Oh, listen, she is the worst of the worst. And Soros made her the head of the women's march and the Democrats love her. This is a sick nightmare. And meanwhile, you know, Vimeo banned us saying we made it up.
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:49.040]  I have the letter. There are no training camps. There's nothing happening.
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:58.040]  Yeah. And the media is doing a total blackout on this story. They're calling it school shooters. I'm sorry, but there's a really big difference between schools.
[02:40:58.040 --> 02:41:06.040]  Imagine if Christians or a devil cult or a Jewish group or a Buddhist group had 12 kids training for school shootings.
[02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:14.040]  They'd say, you know, out at this camp of X, they were training. You tell people the cult. Every group's got cults. No, it's Islamic.
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:22.040]  And I'm told I'm banned because I made this up. I did not make up Niagara Falls or the sun coming up. Laura.
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:28.040]  Well, I mean, I'll just give you another example of these companies making Muslim a word that you cannot say on social media.
[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:34.040]  No, I agree. I've even been told in all these strikes and stuff, you know, do not talk about Muslims. Well, why can't I talk about it?
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:38.040]  Because I don't want my daughters growing up under this. Damn it.
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:46.040]  Listen to this. So in India, two weeks ago, eight Muslim men gang raped a goat, a pregnant goat, and the goat ended up dying.
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:52.040]  This was this was news in India. It caused outrage in India. I released that story and I put it on my Facebook.
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:57.040]  And they said that I violated by posting facts about a news story.
[02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:06.040]  Exactly. We have gang rapes up 90 plus percent Islamists in Europe. No coverage. But if a goat gets raped, it's big news.
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:14.040]  Well, yeah, but you're not even allowed to report on the bestiality that's being carried out by by jihadi. So I mean, it's a serious issue.
[02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:22.040]  I got the Vimeo note right here banned and it says that I made fun of Chinese people. That's not true.
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:32.040]  And claims of Islamic training camps unsupported in the U.S. I should Fox News and AP and a fifth column enemy with low intensity warfare,
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:37.040]  including assassination of police officers CNN said Black Lives Matter killing police was good.
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:44.040]  Yeah, it's wild. It's a communist style censorship here in America, Donald Trump. Well, yeah, Laura Loomer's with us.
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:50.040]  It's like saying you're banned for saying again, the sun is yellow. We'll be right back with your calls and Laura Loomer.
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:54.040]  Stay with us. Something begs coming.
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:43:01.040]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage. And that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:07.040]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:20.040]  25, 50, 100, 250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:32.040]  in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:55.040]  And with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:44:02.040]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here in Lailania States.
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:08.040]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:16.040]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:22.040]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:28.040]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:35.040]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:39.040]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:44.040]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:50.040]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:56.040]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:56.040 --> 02:45:02.040]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:05.040]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:09.040]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:14.040]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:18.040]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:29.040]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and so much more.
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:34.040]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:39.040]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:48.040]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:22.040]  You are the InfoWarsLife.
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:38.040]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:53.040]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:47:10.040]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:24.040]  The answer to tyranny, the answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:42.040]  You know I think back reading the history books, not bragging, the genetics is amazing on my ancestors, both sides of the family I never got into on air really, and they're just bigger, larger than live people, the generals, captains and the colonels and the patriots, the inventors and the pastors.
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:45.040]  Now look at that, I say, how are they so great?
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:59.040]  They weren't that great, it was the times they lived in and what they decided to do to make sure that their shadow wasn't taller than their soul. Let's turn this up for a moment and I'm going to show you some powerful information.
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:09.040]  This is the time ladies and gentlemen, the dark forces of the globalists are attempting to take over the planet right now. Evil believes you're weak, believes it can capture you and dominate you.
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:24.040]  Now is the time to realize the power of individualism and what you can do because the big event is coming. I'll ask Laura Loomer what it is in a moment.
[02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:40.040]  Alright we're back live here ladies and gentlemen, we've got this footage that we're going to get to. Laura described this footage that they call hateful, they call evil, they've banned this woman, you said running on a post, she's now a congresswoman, and so wow it's the first Muslim woman.
[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:52.040]  They don't let Muslim women run for office in the Middle East, but they love the little, they know how to manipulate America though, and so they fund it, they put it in, all these men are there, you're there by yourself, describe this footage.
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:49:05.040]  Yeah so I confronted these socialist leftist candidates who are Muslims, who are tied to terror organizations like CARE and Hamas and Muslim Brotherhood, and I asked them to explain themselves.
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:20.040]  I wanted to know why they're campaigning with Linda Sarsour who's calling for Jihad against Trump, why they're voting against legislation to criminalize FGM, why they're endangering our national security and if they would admit that Hamas was a terrorist organization.
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:24.040]  So I was doing what the mainstream media should be doing, right, but they're not.
[02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:32.040]  And so then I posted this video and Facebook, like I said, gave me a 30 day ban almost immediately.
[02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:37.040]  And not to mention the Muslim candidate assaulted me.
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:44.040]  We should roll some of this video, the audio is kind of choppy, but again describe where you were and when this happened.
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:51.040]  I was in Minnesota at Elon Omar's campaign event which was at a Palestinian restaurant here in Minnesota.
[02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:59.040]  And I was just surrounded by Somalians and Palestinians and I was probably the only Jew there.
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:14.040]  Well, let me add this point, they don't let Palestinians, that's just a made up group, they don't let them into Saudi Arabia or into Egypt or anywhere because you let them run things, all they do is then kill each other.
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:25.040]  It's like whatever this group is, it's people that just came in to that area of Israel at that crossroads and are just always claiming they're in charge of everything.
[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:30.040]  I mean, I've looked it up, Palestinians literally is a made up thing from what I've researched.
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:34.040]  And again, why won't any Muslim countries take one of them?
[02:50:34.040 --> 02:50:39.040]  Well, I know I've studied the history, you let them in, they're like revolutionaries, it's all they do.
[02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:44.040]  And they're constantly trying to kill Israelis, they're constantly trying to kill them.
[02:50:44.040 --> 02:50:56.040]  And Laura Loomer, Skype is breaking up, she's in Minnesota right now, we'll go back to her as soon as it comes back. And again, I'm not against Muslims or any other group.
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:07.040]  They will not take Palestinians in Jordan, they will not take them in Egypt, they will not take them in Syria, they will not take them in Saudi Arabia because literally it is just a political group.
[02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:14.040]  It's kind of like the cliche that just doesn't even matter anymore.
[02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:15.040]  It's just totally insane.
[02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:26.040]  Laura, you're Skype's back, you were saying, you did have a lot of courage going in Minnesota that is basically Somali and Palestinian run.
[02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:31.040]  You go in there as a woman, tell us what happened.
[02:51:31.040 --> 02:51:42.040]  So I went in there and I confronted them and, like I said, I was assaulted. You can see Rashida, Khalid, the candidate, she assaulted me on camera and tried to steal my cell phone.
[02:51:42.040 --> 02:51:49.040]  And I just love the arrogance, she is running unopposed, she just won the primary, you're there.
[02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:52.040]  And so all, it's just, oh, it's all of it's so fake.
[02:51:52.040 --> 02:52:00.040]  Here, here, let's, oh my God, let's go ahead and roll this video from the start, go ahead and roll it.
[02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:02.040]  Hi, my name is Laura Lumer.
[02:52:02.040 --> 02:52:08.040]  I just thought it was good for you, I was wondering if, since you're now going to become the first, I know my hands are cold, it's so cold in here.
[02:52:08.040 --> 02:52:14.040]  I was wondering since, congratulations on your primary, since you're going to be the first Palestinian Muslim.
[02:52:14.040 --> 02:52:15.040]  I'm so sorry.
[02:52:15.040 --> 02:52:16.040]  Are you willing to?
[02:52:16.040 --> 02:52:18.040]  No, I can tell.
[02:52:18.040 --> 02:52:19.040]  I actually, I see the law.
[02:52:19.040 --> 02:52:20.040]  Are you a card?
[02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:21.040]  Yes.
[02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:23.040]  Thank you.
[02:52:23.040 --> 02:52:28.040]  Rashida, are you willing to admit, as a congresswoman, that Hamas is a terrorist organization?
[02:52:28.040 --> 02:52:33.040]  I really need to know that if this woman is going to be elected to Congress, she is going to be elected to Congress.
[02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:34.040]  She is going to be elected to Congress.
[02:52:34.040 --> 02:52:35.040]  I heard about her.
[02:52:35.040 --> 02:52:36.040]  Yeah.
[02:52:36.040 --> 02:52:37.040]  Rashida.
[02:52:37.040 --> 02:52:38.040]  No, no, I heard she liked strong citizenship.
[02:52:38.040 --> 02:52:42.040]  I have an opportunity for us to be able to come together as one community.
[02:52:42.040 --> 02:52:44.040]  What about your Jewish constituents?
[02:52:44.040 --> 02:52:47.040]  I'm now going to be a member of Congress, inshallah.
[02:52:47.040 --> 02:52:51.040]  So, the most important thing is that we fight back.
[02:52:51.040 --> 02:52:53.040]  But I love coming from a place of love.
[02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:57.040]  And why are you campaigning with Linda Sarsour, who called for Jihad against President Trump?
[02:52:57.040 --> 02:52:59.040]  So, that is afforded to all of us.
[02:52:59.040 --> 02:53:01.040]  What about justice for little girls, Ilan?
[02:53:01.040 --> 02:53:06.040]  You voted against legislation that would have made the SDM a felony.
[02:53:06.040 --> 02:53:09.040]  Why is she so hateful against Israel?
[02:53:09.040 --> 02:53:16.040]  Are they going to recognize the United States' decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel?
[02:53:16.040 --> 02:53:18.040]  10, 4, 1.
[02:53:18.040 --> 02:53:20.040]  She married her brother.
[02:53:20.040 --> 02:53:22.040]  Ilan, why did you marry your brother?
[02:53:22.040 --> 02:53:27.040]  She committed immigration fraud so that her brother could get a green card.
[02:53:27.040 --> 02:53:34.040]  And the government has decided that immigration fraud is a crime and incest is illegal in the United States of America.
[02:53:34.040 --> 02:53:41.040]  It is a violation of campaign finance rules to use your campaign funds to pay for your divorce from your brother.
[02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:46.040]  CARE is recognized as a designated terrorist organization in United Arab Emirates.
[02:53:46.040 --> 02:53:51.040]  Both of these candidates have been endorsed by CARE, a terrorist organization.
[02:53:51.040 --> 02:53:57.040]  The federal government's found during the Holy Land Foundation trial that CARE ties to terrorism.
[02:53:57.040 --> 02:54:02.040]  They were funding Hamas, which Rashida, candidate for Congress, supports.
[02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:05.040]  She needs to decide whether she's an American or a Muslim first.
[02:54:05.040 --> 02:54:08.040]  Is she a Palestinian or is she an American first?
[02:54:08.040 --> 02:54:11.040]  All right, and they got the stuff going.
[02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:13.040]  All that happened in the background.
[02:54:13.040 --> 02:54:19.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can't go to any of those countries as a Christian and hand out Bibles.
[02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:21.040]  They don't run for office.
[02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:25.040]  And under Sharia law, they don't respect, in their own admissions, our law.
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:27.040]  They say it supersedes it.
[02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:28.040]  So it's here.
[02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:33.040]  And we're going to have a lot of Muslim radical jihadis and people elected to things now.
[02:54:33.040 --> 02:54:35.040]  And it's just very sad.
[02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:39.040]  But again, their husbands and people let them out without the burqas and things.
[02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:41.040]  Only for these political events.
[02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:43.040]  And I guess they're using women as their trojan horse.
[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:49.040]  How like Antifa puts women up front when they're blocking you to an event so that you push past them, you've attacked a woman.
[02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:51.040]  This is just truly, truly frightening.
[02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:52.040]  Laura Loomer.
[02:54:52.040 --> 02:54:54.040]  Yeah, no, that's exactly what's happening.
[02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:57.040]  And it's a complete infiltration of our government.
[02:54:57.040 --> 02:55:06.040]  And, you know, for what I want to know is why is it that the Democrat Party is campaigning with people like Linda Sarsour who has called for jihad against President Trump?
[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:12.040]  The Democratic Party says it's mean to talk about MS-13 torturing five-year-old girls to death.
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:13.040]  Well, you know what?
[02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:20.040]  Are they going to say it's mean when terrorists decide to ram another plane into a building and they kill another 3,000 or 6,000 Americans?
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:22.040]  Because that's where we're headed, Alex.
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:26.040]  We're going to have another 9-11 if people don't get their act together and wake up and understand.
[02:55:26.040 --> 02:55:28.040]  Well, that's my next question.
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:29.040]  Let me ask you this.
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:31.040]  They're gearing up for a big event.
[02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:33.040]  I think a false flag on themselves censoring everybody.
[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:35.040]  They're openly saying overthrow Trump.
[02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:36.040]  This is older crescendo.
[02:55:36.040 --> 02:55:37.040]  What do you think?
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:38.040]  Do you think I'm right?
[02:55:38.040 --> 02:55:40.040]  A big event's coming or big events?
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:43.040]  And if I'm right, what is it?
[02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:44.040]  I do agree.
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:51.040]  I think that there's going to be some type of assassination attempt or some type of terror attack on a grand scale.
[02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:55.040]  And it's going to be very tragic and it's going to probably be very bloody and it's going to be very bad.
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:55:59.040]  But, you know, we've been warning people, Alex, that's why we've been shut down.
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:00.040]  That's why we've been banned.
[02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:01.040]  We've been telling people the truth.
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:06.040]  We've been warning them about the subversion and infiltration of jihadis in our United States.
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:07.040]  No, I agree.
[02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:13.040]  And I got banned on two platforms for saying they found Muslim training camps that were going to attack schools and kill cops.
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:14.040]  That's associated press.
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:16.040]  They're banning me for that.
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:21.040]  On two different platforms, who's giving the orders that we don't give that warning?
[02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:22.040]  Well, exactly.
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:26.040]  And that's why this is such an unholy alliance, Alex.
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:29.040]  You have the alliance with the communists, right?
[02:56:29.040 --> 02:56:35.040]  These Marxist candidates, these extreme left-wingers with the Islamic jihadis, okay?
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:38.040]  And this is what's going to, this is their goal.
[02:56:38.040 --> 02:56:41.040]  They have this, what it's called, a red-green alliance.
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:47.040]  And they want this red-green alliance to take over and overthrow America, all right?
[02:56:47.040 --> 02:56:49.040]  And we need to fight back against it.
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:55.040]  Because if you heard, if you listened to my video, you have Linda Sarsour, you have Rashida, you have Keith, you have Ilan.
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:56.040]  And what are they all saying?
[02:56:56.040 --> 02:56:59.040]  We need to fight, fight back against it.
[02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:04.040]  Well, I was about to say, why didn't they run some Islamic person that didn't have a background of all this?
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:05.040]  Run the worst people.
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:08.040]  I guess they're proud of it, and they think we're that dumb.
[02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:12.040]  Well, because they're proud of it, and the media just doesn't cover it.
[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:14.040]  I mean, look, Alex, I was in Michigan, all right?
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:18.040]  And I did a full-blown expose on Abdul al-Sahid, all right?
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:22.040]  He literally held a fundraiser with a 1993 co-conspirator in the World Trade Center.
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:23.040]  No, no, no.
[02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:26.040]  Who's now connected to the New Mexico thing.
[02:57:26.040 --> 02:57:27.040]  Exactly.
[02:57:27.040 --> 02:57:29.040]  And look, I'm exposing this by myself.
[02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:30.040]  I'm on the ground.
[02:57:30.040 --> 02:57:31.040]  I'm a woman.
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:32.040]  I'm Jewish.
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:33.040]  I'm American.
[02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:36.040]  And I'm doing this, and the mainstream media needs to step up.
[02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:38.040]  They're a slave of the switch being politically correct.
[02:57:38.040 --> 02:57:41.040]  At Laura Loomer on Twitter, website, Laura Loomer.us.
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:42.040]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:42.040 --> 02:57:43.040]  Amazing courage.
[02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:45.040]  We'll be back with your phone calls.
[02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:48.040]  InfoWarsLife is launching its newest product.
[02:57:48.040 --> 02:57:50.040]  We're really, really proud of it.
[02:57:50.040 --> 02:57:53.040]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[02:57:53.040 --> 02:58:00.040]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds
[02:58:00.040 --> 02:58:05.040]  that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:10.040]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live, active culture, for a life,
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:15.040]  as well as Myco ZX that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses and the gut.
[02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:19.040]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product
[02:58:19.040 --> 02:58:21.040]  and these other products.
[02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:24.040]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings
[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:26.040]  and get high quality products at the same time.
[02:58:26.040 --> 02:58:28.040]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[02:58:28.040 --> 02:58:31.040]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:34.040]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we can come up with.
[02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:36.040]  It's sold out for another month and a half.
[02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:39.040]  We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[02:58:39.040 --> 02:58:42.040]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[02:58:42.040 --> 02:58:46.040]  Get yours today in FoWarsLife.com.
[02:58:46.040 --> 02:58:49.040]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products,
[02:58:49.040 --> 02:58:51.040]  we have it in FoWarsLife.
[02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:52.040]  They take hours.
[02:58:52.040 --> 02:58:55.040]  Myco ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:58:55.040 --> 02:58:56.040]  It's stronger.
[02:58:56.040 --> 02:58:58.040]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:58:58.040 --> 02:59:01.040]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:59:01.040 --> 02:59:02.040]  It's back in stock.
[02:59:02.040 --> 02:59:05.040]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:59:05.040 --> 02:59:09.040]  It's got the preglonone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:59:09.040 --> 02:59:12.040]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[02:59:12.040 --> 02:59:13.040]  So you can upload it.
[02:59:13.040 --> 02:59:17.040]  And our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver
[02:59:17.040 --> 02:59:22.040]  and iodine 4 to 5 toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[02:59:22.040 --> 02:59:23.040]  That's a spray you do.
[02:59:23.040 --> 02:59:24.040]  You can also swallow it.
[02:59:24.040 --> 02:59:30.040]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[02:59:30.040 --> 02:59:31.040]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:59:31.040 --> 02:59:36.040]  So thank you all for remembering in FoWarsLife.com and remembering that it's not just you
[02:59:36.040 --> 02:59:39.040]  that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake.
[02:59:39.040 --> 02:59:41.040]  It's so essential to spread the word.
[02:59:41.040 --> 02:59:55.040]  And again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:00:12.040 --> 03:00:15.040]  So we figured out how to launch our own radio and TV network.
[03:00:15.040 --> 03:00:21.040]  We became number one on YouTube, Google, Apple, and podcast on the apps.
[03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:23.040]  And their answer is BANAS.
[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:26.040]  They're not just going to try some bold moves trying to de-platform us,
[03:00:26.040 --> 03:00:31.040]  take our credit card clearance away, take our comments away, take everything away
[03:00:31.040 --> 03:00:33.040]  unless they were getting ready to make a big move.
[03:00:33.040 --> 03:00:35.040]  I'm taking a ton of your calls this segment and the next.
[03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:36.040]  We're going to everybody.
[03:00:36.040 --> 03:00:41.040]  And then, Gerald Solente, the trans forecasters coming up in the War Room with Owen Schreuer
[03:00:41.040 --> 03:00:44.040]  and Roger Stone with Big Breaking News.
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:46.040]  But we're going to go to your calls right now.
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:49.040]  Who was I going to go to first here?
[03:00:49.040 --> 03:00:50.040]  We got Mike.
[03:00:50.040 --> 03:00:52.040]  Let's talk about next event, Detention Centers.
[03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:54.040]  James, False Flag, Next 9-11.
[03:00:54.040 --> 03:00:56.040]  Bill Kentucky, Purge Movie, Precursor.
[03:00:56.040 --> 03:00:58.040]  Oh yeah, that's a whole race war movie.
[03:00:58.040 --> 03:00:59.040]  I saw it.
[03:00:59.040 --> 03:01:01.040]  Melanie wants to talk about other school shooting.
[03:01:01.040 --> 03:01:03.040]  Chris, support from a family.
[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:05.040]  Get to everybody here.
[03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:08.040]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Virginia.
[03:01:08.040 --> 03:01:09.040]  Next big event.
[03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:11.040]  Go ahead, Mike, you're on the air.
[03:01:11.040 --> 03:01:13.040]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:15.040]  First time caller.
[03:01:15.040 --> 03:01:17.040]  Welcome, sir.
[03:01:17.040 --> 03:01:19.040]  Well, quick plug real quick.
[03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:21.040]  Putting mom on the bodies.
[03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:23.040]  She had arthritis real bad and everything.
[03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:27.040]  And I mean, it's not a cure-all, but the aches have gone.
[03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:29.040]  She had a catch in her right shoulder.
[03:01:29.040 --> 03:01:32.040]  She's got more flexibility now in that.
[03:01:32.040 --> 03:01:34.040]  Her mood's even increased.
[03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:39.040]  I've been taking the iodine, the red pill, and the brain force.
[03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:42.040]  And I became a truck driver about a year ago.
[03:01:42.040 --> 03:01:44.040]  I take that and I get ready to leave.
[03:01:44.040 --> 03:01:45.040]  And I'm focused.
[03:01:45.040 --> 03:01:47.040]  I'm awake.
[03:01:47.040 --> 03:01:48.040]  It's a great day.
[03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:49.040]  Well, let me just say.
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:53.040]  Cochumatin, what's in the turmeric, we have a 95% rating.
[03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:55.040]  The average thing sold 3%.
[03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:57.040]  It's really expensive to get this organic concentrate.
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:00.040]  We have the best turmeric product you can get.
[03:02:00.040 --> 03:02:03.040]  And it is a known anti-inflammatory.
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:05.040]  And so just like my info is hardcore, brother,
[03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:07.040]  it is the best product you can get.
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:10.040]  So exactly my wife played competitive tennis a lot
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:13.040]  for 20-something years and she's like,
[03:02:13.040 --> 03:02:16.040]  get me more bodies because the Advil doesn't work.
[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:18.040]  This works for her.
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:21.040]  And so that's just an example of what you're talking about.
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:22.040]  Absolutely.
[03:02:22.040 --> 03:02:24.040]  And I bought some stickers, but I can't find them right now.
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:27.040]  I've resorted to scrawling info wars on the walls of bathroom stalls
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:28.040]  everywhere I go.
[03:02:28.040 --> 03:02:29.040]  So.
[03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:30.040]  Well, we're in a war, brother.
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:31.040]  What do you think is going on here?
[03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:33.040]  What do you think of that as?
[03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:39.040]  Well, the left sacred cows are race and children.
[03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:41.040]  And especially with this whole gun thing.
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:44.040]  I agree with the other caller about more school shootings
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:47.040]  and everything, but school shootings have kind of
[03:02:47.040 --> 03:02:49.040]  become now commonplace.
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:52.040]  I'm worried about these detention centers on the border.
[03:02:52.040 --> 03:02:54.040]  You know, the ones with the children there.
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:55.040]  Oh, exactly.
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:59.040]  Have some wound up crazy PCP head going attack one of those.
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:00.040]  Yeah.
[03:03:00.040 --> 03:03:01.040]  So right there, you got the race.
[03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:02.040]  You got the immigration.
[03:03:02.040 --> 03:03:03.040]  You got the children.
[03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:05.040]  You've worked the guns in there.
[03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:10.040]  I mean, that, yeah, that could set off a whole cluster of.
[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:13.040]  And again, they're shutting me down and everybody else down
[03:03:13.040 --> 03:03:15.040]  right now ahead of this.
[03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:18.040]  Clearly they're going to make some big move.
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:21.040]  And the attacks against the mainstream media.
[03:03:21.040 --> 03:03:24.040]  I'm not really sure about, I mean, I'm sure it'll happen.
[03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:27.040]  I'm sure it's in their deck of cards.
[03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:30.040]  You know, attacking like say Congress or something might be
[03:03:30.040 --> 03:03:33.040]  a little bit too big right now, but I think something like that
[03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:37.040]  works everything in with the attacks on the border.
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:38.040]  I agree, brother.
[03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:40.040]  One quick thing to ask about Parkland.
[03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:42.040]  Yes.
[03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:44.040]  Florida has those sunshine laws.
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:47.040]  This is something I've never, I haven't heard you guys bring up.
[03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:50.040]  Florida has those sunshine laws that I saw on TV.
[03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:53.040]  They were talking about, oh, the sunshine laws.
[03:03:53.040 --> 03:03:55.040]  We could get the tapes and see what happens.
[03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:57.040]  This was like a day.
[03:03:57.040 --> 03:03:59.040]  No, no, I mean, here's the deal.
[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:01.040]  I never said the shooting didn't happen until they said I did
[03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:03.040]  and said, don't question it.
[03:04:03.040 --> 03:04:05.040]  Oh, I wasn't questioning at all.
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:07.040]  It just, I mean, but the way they say, don't question it
[03:04:07.040 --> 03:04:10.040]  and then lie and say we are, but the police stood down.
[03:04:10.040 --> 03:04:11.040]  That's now confirmed.
[03:04:11.040 --> 03:04:12.040]  That's been admitted.
[03:04:12.040 --> 03:04:15.040]  And hog is on three videos saying I wasn't at school,
[03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:17.040]  went there after the shooting and then he's in a closet going,
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:18.040]  they're in here.
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:19.040]  They're after me.
[03:04:19.040 --> 03:04:20.040]  I'm here during the shooting.
[03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:23.040]  And I, okay, maybe he can like jump time or something.
[03:04:23.040 --> 03:04:25.040]  Fine, but those videos are real.
[03:04:25.040 --> 03:04:27.040]  That said, and they say, don't question him.
[03:04:27.040 --> 03:04:29.040]  He's a public figure.
[03:04:29.040 --> 03:04:32.040]  They want me off Twitter right now and there's porn,
[03:04:32.040 --> 03:04:34.040]  everything else on there.
[03:04:34.040 --> 03:04:35.040]  It's just crazy.
[03:04:35.040 --> 03:04:37.040]  So, so, so what do you think's happening?
[03:04:37.040 --> 03:04:42.040]  I just want to see those surveillance tapes.
[03:04:42.040 --> 03:04:44.040]  Well, absolutely, but you're not supposed to ask questions.
[03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:45.040]  So you're a bad person.

[03:05:36.040 --> 03:05:39.040]  stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles
[03:05:39.040 --> 03:05:40.040]  on our own platform.
[03:05:40.040 --> 03:05:43.040]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com,
[03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:46.040]  forward slash show, how they can download the free Android
[03:05:46.040 --> 03:05:47.040]  and iPhone apps.
[03:05:47.040 --> 03:05:50.040]  How they can then reach out to others with the information
[03:05:50.040 --> 03:05:52.040]  and point out this is the verboten info.
[03:05:52.040 --> 03:05:54.040]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:05:54.040 --> 03:05:56.040]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:06:25.040 --> 03:06:28.040]  Our servers, it's just everything.
[03:06:28.040 --> 03:06:31.040]  They are doing this to just test censorship and see
[03:06:31.040 --> 03:06:32.040]  of America and Congress.
[03:06:32.040 --> 03:06:34.040]  And the president will put up with it.
[03:06:34.040 --> 03:06:38.040]  So far, everybody's focused on people in the White House
[03:06:38.040 --> 03:06:41.040]  recording Kelly secretly and all sort of stuff.
[03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:42.040]  That's all distractions.
[03:06:42.040 --> 03:06:45.040]  They're making their move to shut down political debate ahead
[03:06:45.040 --> 03:06:47.040]  of 2018, two and a half months out.
[03:06:47.040 --> 03:06:50.040]  This is the big move.
[03:06:50.040 --> 03:06:54.040]  Bill, Purge Movies, The Future, James, False Flag,
[03:06:54.040 --> 03:06:56.040]  we got Greg, Complete Censorship next.
[03:06:56.040 --> 03:06:58.040]  We'll go to everybody here.
[03:06:58.040 --> 03:07:00.040]  Greg, you're on the air from Florida.
[03:07:00.040 --> 03:07:02.040]  Go ahead.
[03:07:02.040 --> 03:07:04.040]  Holy crow, Alex.
[03:07:04.040 --> 03:07:06.040]  Alex, I've been submitting to your contest.
[03:07:06.040 --> 03:07:08.040]  Everything I could do to get in touch with you.
[03:07:08.040 --> 03:07:11.040]  I think I have the answer and the answer is going after
[03:07:11.040 --> 03:07:17.040]  businesses and making them money.
[03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:21.040]  I mean, are you saying the boycotts, the classic fascism
[03:07:21.040 --> 03:07:25.040]  of targeting patriots economically is what's coming?
[03:07:25.040 --> 03:07:31.040]  Yeah, like a velvet revolution of businesses supporting
[03:07:31.040 --> 03:07:34.040]  themselves, strong local businesses supporting their
[03:07:34.040 --> 03:07:35.040]  strong local businesses.
[03:07:35.040 --> 03:07:38.040]  Oh, you're saying that's the counter to all their censorship?
[03:07:38.040 --> 03:07:39.040]  Yes, yes.
[03:07:39.040 --> 03:07:42.040]  Like I want to get open source, decentralized, like with the
[03:07:42.040 --> 03:07:45.040]  gab, with everything else, lead gen sites.
[03:07:45.040 --> 03:07:47.040]  No, no, I totally agree.
[03:07:47.040 --> 03:07:48.040]  That's the answer.
[03:07:48.040 --> 03:07:50.040]  And people are kind of doing that here in a small scale.
[03:07:50.040 --> 03:07:53.040]  As a beta test, I'm saying, what's their big event?
[03:07:53.040 --> 03:07:55.040]  They wouldn't be engaging in all this censorship and
[03:07:55.040 --> 03:07:58.040]  shutdowns unless they didn't want us being in the public
[03:07:58.040 --> 03:08:01.040]  square when they launched this thing.
[03:08:01.040 --> 03:08:04.040]  Oh, their big event is totally putting us in the dark and
[03:08:04.040 --> 03:08:05.040]  then hitting us.
[03:08:05.040 --> 03:08:08.040]  Like you said, it's straight up, you know, from Google,
[03:08:08.040 --> 03:08:11.040]  the mothership, taking us down.
[03:08:11.040 --> 03:08:12.040]  It is, God bless you.
[03:08:12.040 --> 03:08:15.040]  Let's go to Bill in Kentucky.
[03:08:15.040 --> 03:08:16.040]  Let's get Bill's take.
[03:08:16.040 --> 03:08:17.040]  He says purge the movies of precursor.
[03:08:17.040 --> 03:08:18.040]  Yeah.
[03:08:18.040 --> 03:08:21.040]  The army works KKK outfits and goes around and kills black
[03:08:21.040 --> 03:08:22.040]  people.
[03:08:22.040 --> 03:08:23.040]  That's not happening.
[03:08:23.040 --> 03:08:24.040]  It's blacks killing blacks on average.
[03:08:24.040 --> 03:08:25.040]  It's terrible.
[03:08:25.040 --> 03:08:26.040]  We want to stop it.
[03:08:26.040 --> 03:08:27.040]  But that's all in leftist cities.
[03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:28.040]  And so I saw the movie.
[03:08:28.040 --> 03:08:30.040]  I reviewed it before I'd seen it.
[03:08:30.040 --> 03:08:33.040]  I read the synopsis and it's like all these other hundreds
[03:08:33.040 --> 03:08:35.040]  of movies and shows about race war.
[03:08:35.040 --> 03:08:37.040]  I think that's part of the big event they've got coming.
[03:08:37.040 --> 03:08:38.040]  Go ahead, Bill.
[03:08:38.040 --> 03:08:42.040]  Yes, sir, Alex, go ahead and get on with you.
[03:08:42.040 --> 03:08:46.040]  Can't say enough good things about all the products they use
[03:08:46.040 --> 03:08:48.040]  and have time for that.
[03:08:48.040 --> 03:08:53.040]  No, I just wondered, you've always told that the
[03:08:53.040 --> 03:08:56.040]  Illuminati kind of gives out hints and stuff through their
[03:08:56.040 --> 03:09:02.040]  movies and, you know, the purge just sticks in my mind.
[03:09:02.040 --> 03:09:07.040]  I see it and it just, maybe it's not a race war, but it's
[03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:10.040]  the same kind of scenario where they make it look like it's a
[03:09:10.040 --> 03:09:12.040]  race war to trigger it.
[03:09:12.040 --> 03:09:13.040]  No, I agree.
[03:09:13.040 --> 03:09:16.040]  They send out paramilitary multinationals to kill a bunch
[03:09:16.040 --> 03:09:19.040]  of minorities, say whites did it like they tried in
[03:09:19.040 --> 03:09:22.040]  Charlottesville a year ago and then triggered the whole deal.
[03:09:22.040 --> 03:09:23.040]  Absolutely.
[03:09:23.040 --> 03:09:27.040]  And I can see something like that happening and with the
[03:09:27.040 --> 03:09:31.040]  people still, a lot of them still asleep, they wouldn't
[03:09:31.040 --> 03:09:32.040]  know what hit them.
[03:09:32.040 --> 03:09:35.040]  Well, I agree with you because I never said that the
[03:09:35.040 --> 03:09:37.040]  government itself stayed Charlottesville.
[03:09:37.040 --> 03:09:39.040]  I said the police stood down.
[03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:41.040]  You had a bunch of the white supremacists being government
[03:09:41.040 --> 03:09:42.040]  operatives.
[03:09:42.040 --> 03:09:44.040]  And so they herded them all in to have that crisis and
[03:09:44.040 --> 03:09:45.040]  somebody died.
[03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:48.040]  They're suing me saying, I said the CIA ran it and it was
[03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:51.040]  all staged and I sat back when that happened and I went,
[03:09:51.040 --> 03:09:54.040]  wow, they're really scared of me asking that question.
[03:09:54.040 --> 03:09:57.040]  So they don't want me to ask that question when it
[03:09:57.040 --> 03:09:58.040]  actually happens.
[03:09:58.040 --> 03:10:00.040]  Because I'm not saying it happened in Charlottesville,
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:02.040]  but I've actually laying in my bed at night like really
[03:10:02.040 --> 03:10:05.040]  deeply thinking, I've thought exactly what you're saying
[03:10:05.040 --> 03:10:08.040]  before I even saw the Purge movie a month ago.
[03:10:08.040 --> 03:10:09.040]  Absolutely.
[03:10:09.040 --> 03:10:11.040]  My father explained it to me.
[03:10:11.040 --> 03:10:18.040]  He's a pretty biblical scholar and he explained to me,
[03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:21.040]  he's up in his 80s, I'm 62.
[03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:26.040]  He said the devil works through manipulation,
[03:10:26.040 --> 03:10:29.040]  intimidation and domination.
[03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:32.040]  And if you break what's going on in the world down to the
[03:10:32.040 --> 03:10:34.040]  least common denominators of all things,
[03:10:34.040 --> 03:10:38.040]  that's what we've had going on for the length of this.
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:43.040]  And the only way we can fight it is to not be dominated and
[03:10:43.040 --> 03:10:45.040]  not let us intimidate us.
[03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:47.040]  Exactly, because here's what happens.
[03:10:47.040 --> 03:10:51.040]  Once you give in to one level of censorship and intimidation
[03:10:51.040 --> 03:10:54.040]  and them controlling what you say, then you give in to any
[03:10:54.040 --> 03:10:55.040]  of it.
[03:10:55.040 --> 03:10:57.040]  Then you look at all their leftists on Twitter, Facebook,
[03:10:57.040 --> 03:11:00.040]  Google, they can say whatever they want, do whatever they
[03:11:00.040 --> 03:11:03.040]  want, attack whoever they want, but then you say it's wrong
[03:11:03.040 --> 03:11:07.040]  and they censor you and it's all about just give in to the
[03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:09.040]  manipulation, the intimidation, the domination.
[03:11:09.040 --> 03:11:12.040]  The devil goes about roaring like a lion,
[03:11:12.040 --> 03:11:16.040]  seeing who he can devour, who falls down to the devil,
[03:11:16.040 --> 03:11:19.040]  who rolls over, they get devoured.
[03:11:19.040 --> 03:11:21.040]  Absolutely.
[03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:23.040]  What else do you think they might pull?
[03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:25.040]  I think they're openly trying to crash the economy.
[03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:27.040]  I really appreciate Trump and know he's overwhelmed,
[03:11:27.040 --> 03:11:29.040]  but I don't know why he doesn't make a bigger deal about the
[03:11:29.040 --> 03:11:31.040]  censorship.
[03:11:31.040 --> 03:11:36.040]  Well, I question myself, you know, President Trump has to know
[03:11:36.040 --> 03:11:41.040]  based on what you've information that you've made sure he
[03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:47.040]  saw and I question if there's something that's not being
[03:11:47.040 --> 03:11:52.040]  given out that is why all this hasn't already started to,
[03:11:52.040 --> 03:11:55.040]  the dominoes haven't started to fall.
[03:11:55.040 --> 03:12:00.040]  I mean, the censorship on their part of it makes sense,
[03:12:00.040 --> 03:12:05.040]  like he said before the election, to silence the voice of his
[03:12:05.040 --> 03:12:10.040]  base, but I just don't understand why President Trump
[03:12:10.040 --> 03:12:12.040]  hasn't acted.
[03:12:12.040 --> 03:12:16.040]  He's got the power to act and, you know, sessions and...
[03:12:16.040 --> 03:12:18.040]  I think that's it.
[03:12:18.040 --> 03:12:20.040]  I think he drew from a bunch of people that lied to him and
[03:12:20.040 --> 03:12:22.040]  they've got operatives all around him.
[03:12:22.040 --> 03:12:24.040]  And he just thinks he brings the economy back.
[03:12:24.040 --> 03:12:26.040]  We'll go, hey, this is great.
[03:12:26.040 --> 03:12:27.040]  It's a crazy time.
[03:12:27.040 --> 03:12:28.040]  God bless you.
[03:12:28.040 --> 03:12:30.040]  I appreciate your call, Bill.
[03:12:30.040 --> 03:12:33.040]  Folks, all I can tell you is we've got censorship.
[03:12:33.040 --> 03:12:35.040]  Thousands of times what's ever happened, they are trying to
[03:12:35.040 --> 03:12:37.040]  shut us down right now.
[03:12:37.040 --> 03:12:39.040]  And that tells me something big is coming.
[03:12:39.040 --> 03:12:42.040]  And you built info wars, you supported info wars.
[03:12:42.040 --> 03:12:45.040]  Imagine a world without info wars.
[03:12:45.040 --> 03:12:47.040]  And that's the world they're trying to build.
[03:12:47.040 --> 03:12:51.040]  They believe if they can dominate us, they can win the whole
[03:12:51.040 --> 03:12:52.040]  ball of acts.
[03:12:52.040 --> 03:12:55.040]  But thanks to the crew and thanks to you, the supporters,
[03:12:55.040 --> 03:12:57.040]  all together, I think they're going to have a really tough
[03:12:57.040 --> 03:12:59.040]  time doing it.
[03:12:59.040 --> 03:13:01.040]  But if you do not go to infowarstore.com and check out the
[03:13:01.040 --> 03:13:03.040]  great products that are great for you and your family to begin

[03:13:06.040 --> 03:13:08.040]  They're trying to shut that down right now.

[03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:13.040]  regardless of what happens.
[03:13:13.040 --> 03:13:15.040]  But we are trying to keep info wars.com down.
[03:13:15.040 --> 03:13:18.040]  If it goes down, news wars.com, present body.com.
[03:13:18.040 --> 03:13:20.040]  But just the power of you.
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:23.040]  I say this, but it's so big.
[03:13:23.040 --> 03:13:27.040]  The power of you.
[03:13:27.040 --> 03:13:31.040]  Telling people now, hey, you've heard info wars demonized.

[03:13:50.040 --> 03:13:53.040]  as long as you're fighting.
[03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:55.040]  infowarstore.com.

[03:14:00.040 --> 03:14:01.040]  I am the resistance shirt.
[03:14:01.040 --> 03:14:03.040]  I think should be the big viral shirt.
[03:14:03.040 --> 03:14:06.040]  One of the leaders, the sill team six designed it and he
[03:14:06.040 --> 03:14:08.040]  thought it would be a big hit and we've sold a lot of, but
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:10.040]  it's, it's not a big hit yet.
[03:14:10.040 --> 03:14:12.040]  I just think everybody should wear that shirt.
[03:14:12.040 --> 03:14:15.040]  And then info wars.com and American flag, that says it all
[03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:17.040]  so we can meet like minded people and nothing can stop you
[03:14:17.040 --> 03:14:20.040]  putting flyers out at night and talking to people when you
[03:14:20.040 --> 03:14:23.040]  get engaged, when you take action, it changes the world.
[03:14:23.040 --> 03:14:26.040]  That's why they want to shut down because they know we have
[03:14:26.040 --> 03:14:29.040]  an engaged audience.
[03:14:29.040 --> 03:14:31.040]  You got a hundred percent reviews on that shirt.
[03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:35.040]  Established 1776 info wars.com on the resistance, but whatever
[03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:37.040]  you do, support the local radio stations, support the local
[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:39.040]  TV stations.
[03:14:39.040 --> 03:14:43.040]  And just know that I don't have hype enough to describe how
[03:14:43.040 --> 03:14:47.040]  serious this is at the big events coming and that they're
[03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:51.040]  going to pull out the stops.
[03:14:51.040 --> 03:14:53.040]  And it looks like it's going to be a bunch of school shootings
[03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:58.040]  and they don't want us questioning those when they happen.
[03:14:58.040 --> 03:14:59.040]  They're going to blame gun owners.
[03:14:59.040 --> 03:15:01.040]  They're going to blame America.
[03:15:01.040 --> 03:15:03.040]  Not going to blame China killing a hundred million of their
[03:15:03.040 --> 03:15:05.040]  own people and not going to blame Tim Cook with the
[03:15:05.040 --> 03:15:09.040]  suicide factories, you know, and his suicide nets and all of it.
[03:15:09.040 --> 03:15:11.040]  These people think you're stupid and they're making their
[03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:13.040]  move on you right now.
[03:15:13.040 --> 03:15:16.040]  And I had to do this course.
[03:15:16.040 --> 03:15:19.040]  I mean, this is the course I'm on because I'm not joining them,
[03:15:19.040 --> 03:15:21.040]  but I really don't want to lose these people.
[03:15:21.040 --> 03:15:26.040]  So we still got Robert and Justin and James and Melanie and
[03:15:26.040 --> 03:15:27.040]  Chris.
[03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:28.040]  I apologize.
[03:15:28.040 --> 03:15:29.040]  I didn't get to y'all.
[03:15:29.040 --> 03:15:30.040]  Not that I don't even want it.
[03:15:30.040 --> 03:15:31.040]  Everybody gets a free.
[03:15:31.040 --> 03:15:32.040]  I'm the resistance T shirt.
[03:15:32.040 --> 03:15:34.040]  If you guys get their name and number, we'll call them.
[03:15:34.040 --> 03:15:36.040]  We'll give them a free shirt while we're still here.
[03:15:36.040 --> 03:15:39.040]  I think we're going to continue on 23 years, but 24 years
[03:15:39.040 --> 03:15:41.040]  almost, but it's up to you.
[03:15:41.040 --> 03:15:43.040]  I got to go.
[03:15:43.040 --> 03:15:46.040]  The war rooms coming up in 45 minutes, whatever you do,
[03:15:46.040 --> 03:15:47.040]  spread those live links.
[03:15:47.040 --> 03:15:49.040]  This is a historic time and they're hitting us every hour.
[03:15:49.040 --> 03:15:50.040]  A new stuff.
[03:15:50.040 --> 03:15:53.040]  So who knows how long we'll be here.
[03:15:53.040 --> 03:15:57.040]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[03:15:57.040 --> 03:16:00.040]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[03:16:00.040 --> 03:16:02.040]  Get a sunny Bay heating pad.
[03:16:02.040 --> 03:16:06.040]  Life can be a pain in the neck or back or shoulder.
[03:16:06.040 --> 03:16:09.040]  And the best relief for that pain is a sunny Bay heating pad.
[03:16:09.040 --> 03:16:12.040]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said
[03:16:12.040 --> 03:16:15.040]  that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy.
[03:16:15.040 --> 03:16:19.040]  Sunny Bay heating pads are handmade with high quality can be
[03:16:19.040 --> 03:16:23.040]  used at home or at work and have a lifetime 100% positive
[03:16:23.040 --> 03:16:25.040]  rating on both Amazon and Etsy.
[03:16:25.040 --> 03:16:26.040]  Why take another pill?
[03:16:26.040 --> 03:16:30.040]  Many people use our sunny Bay heating pads alone and got rid
[03:16:30.040 --> 03:16:31.040]  of the neck pain.
[03:16:31.040 --> 03:16:34.040]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer
[03:16:34.040 --> 03:16:36.040]  can take its toll on your body.

[03:19:16.040 --> 03:19:19.040]  and to destroy their campaign of censorship
[03:19:19.040 --> 03:19:48.040]  in which they want
[03:19:48.040 --> 03:19:50.040]  to be a part of the globalist at point-blank range.
[03:19:50.040 --> 03:19:52.040]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it,
[03:19:52.040 --> 03:20:18.040]  we are unstoppable.
[03:20:18.040 --> 03:20:23.040]  Hi, I'm Gerald Salenci.
[03:20:23.040 --> 03:20:27.040]  I don't look quite like Alex Jones.
[03:20:27.040 --> 03:20:29.040]  Anyway, thank you for having me on.
[03:20:29.040 --> 03:20:32.040]  I admire Alex Jones, a true gentleman.
[03:20:32.040 --> 03:20:36.040]  I've known him many years, as well as the people on the staff.
[03:20:36.040 --> 03:20:39.040]  And it's very disturbing to me to see what's going on
[03:20:39.040 --> 03:20:44.040]  with the prestitute media selling their lives about Info Wars,
[03:20:44.040 --> 03:20:47.040]  who they are, what they represent, what they speak about.
[03:20:47.040 --> 03:20:52.040]  And I've been on Info Wars probably hundreds of times,
[03:20:52.040 --> 03:20:56.040]  never been censored, we don't always agree on issues,
[03:20:56.040 --> 03:21:00.040]  whoever does, and I'm always free to say what I believe
[03:21:00.040 --> 03:21:03.040]  and what the trends are showing as I see them.
[03:21:03.040 --> 03:21:07.040]  So it's very upsetting to me the censorship that's going on
[03:21:07.040 --> 03:21:12.040]  in the United States and how they targeted one of the biggest,
[03:21:12.040 --> 03:21:16.040]  the biggest name out there that's really giving you alternative news
[03:21:16.040 --> 03:21:20.040]  and helping you to think for yourself, Info Wars.
[03:21:20.040 --> 03:21:27.040]  This is a story from the toilet paper of record, the New York Times.
[03:21:27.040 --> 03:21:30.040]  Google withdrew from China eight years ago
[03:21:30.040 --> 03:21:35.040]  to protest the country's censorship on online hacking.
[03:21:35.040 --> 03:21:40.040]  Now the Internet giant is working on a censored search engine
[03:21:40.040 --> 03:21:45.040]  for China that will filter websites and search terms
[03:21:45.040 --> 03:21:49.040]  that are blacklisted by the Chinese government.
[03:21:49.040 --> 03:21:53.040]  Google has teams of engineers working on search apps
[03:21:53.040 --> 03:21:58.040]  that restrict content banned by Beijing.
[03:21:58.040 --> 03:22:02.040]  Google's reversal in China is the latest example
[03:22:02.040 --> 03:22:07.040]  of how American tech companies are trying to tailor their products
[03:22:07.040 --> 03:22:10.040]  to enter the huge Chinese market,
[03:22:10.040 --> 03:22:16.040]  even if it means tamping down on free speech.
[03:22:16.040 --> 03:22:19.040]  LinkedIn censors content in China,
[03:22:19.040 --> 03:22:23.040]  and Facebook develops software to suppress certain posts
[03:22:23.040 --> 03:22:26.040]  from appearing on the social network with the aim
[03:22:26.040 --> 03:22:32.040]  of potentially deploying it in China.
[03:22:32.040 --> 03:22:40.040]  This is August 1st, 12 days ago,
[03:22:40.040 --> 03:22:47.040]  before the crusade to censor Alex Jones.
[03:22:47.040 --> 03:22:53.040]  Look how it's okay when the New York Times
[03:22:53.040 --> 03:22:56.040]  derides censorship in China,
[03:22:56.040 --> 03:22:59.040]  but how they applaud it in America.
[03:22:59.040 --> 03:23:02.040]  It's one constitutional right after another
[03:23:02.040 --> 03:23:05.040]  that we're losing in this country,
[03:23:05.040 --> 03:23:11.040]  and freedom of speech being the number one.
[03:23:11.040 --> 03:23:15.040]  One after another.
[03:23:15.040 --> 03:23:21.040]  One constitution that gave us freedom and liberty,
[03:23:21.040 --> 03:23:24.040]  they keep stealing from us.
[03:23:24.040 --> 03:23:27.040]  The hypocrisy is everywhere
[03:23:27.040 --> 03:23:32.040]  with the toilet paper of record, the New York Times.
[03:23:32.040 --> 03:23:37.040]  This was a story that came out on August 8th.
[03:23:37.040 --> 03:23:39.040]  Feed your gladiator.
[03:23:39.040 --> 03:23:43.040]  Jones urges fans to fight back and send money.
[03:23:43.040 --> 03:23:45.040]  No, don't fight back.
[03:23:45.040 --> 03:23:46.040]  Don't send money.
[03:23:46.040 --> 03:23:48.040]  Bend over and take it.
[03:23:48.040 --> 03:23:51.040]  Become a slave and slave landier.
[03:23:51.040 --> 03:23:54.040]  Only listen to the propaganda that's proper.
[03:23:54.040 --> 03:23:57.040]  Any time you disagree with them,
[03:23:57.040 --> 03:23:59.040]  it's a conspiracy theory.
[03:23:59.040 --> 03:24:03.040]  Like Saddam Hussein didn't have weapons of mass destruction.
[03:24:03.040 --> 03:24:05.040]  Why, how can you say that?
[03:24:05.040 --> 03:24:07.040]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[03:24:07.040 --> 03:24:10.040]  The government said it's true, so therefore it must be.
[03:24:10.040 --> 03:24:15.040]  From the Gulf of Tanken incident and on and on.
[03:24:15.040 --> 03:24:20.040]  Talk about the dangers of GMOs.
[03:24:20.040 --> 03:24:22.040]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:24.040]  There's no hard evidence.
[03:24:24.040 --> 03:24:26.040]  There's no scientific fact.
[03:24:26.040 --> 03:24:28.040]  Hey, didn't that guy just win the poor fellow
[03:24:28.040 --> 03:24:32.040]  that's dying of cancer from using Roundup?
[03:24:32.040 --> 03:24:36.040]  He was awarded that money over the weekend.
[03:24:36.040 --> 03:24:39.040]  It's all right for them to keep selling lies,
[03:24:39.040 --> 03:24:41.040]  but when you come out against them,
[03:24:41.040 --> 03:24:43.040]  you're called a conspiracy theorist.
[03:24:43.040 --> 03:24:46.040]  To doubt him.
[03:24:46.040 --> 03:24:50.040]  Who would believe one thing that this government says,
[03:24:50.040 --> 03:24:52.040]  and you know the motto of the transjournal,
[03:24:52.040 --> 03:24:54.040]  think for yourself.
[03:24:54.040 --> 03:24:59.040]  All they have is a cast of lies
[03:24:59.040 --> 03:25:05.040]  that have supported them over the millennia,
[03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:07.040]  and they just keep coming.
[03:25:07.040 --> 03:25:10.040]  I want to read to you some of the propaganda
[03:25:10.040 --> 03:25:17.040]  and how it's written here by the toilet paper of record.
[03:25:17.040 --> 03:25:22.040]  Just one of his four Facebook pages had 1.7 million followers,
[03:25:22.040 --> 03:25:24.040]  now also gone.
[03:25:24.040 --> 03:25:31.040]  Apple banned five of the six info war podcasts on its service,
[03:25:31.040 --> 03:25:37.040]  having determined that the sixth real news with David Knight,
[03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:41.040]  and now here's what the New York Times is saying,
[03:25:41.040 --> 03:25:46.040]  did not violate its policies which prohibit podcasts
[03:25:46.040 --> 03:25:52.040]  that quote could be construed as racist.
[03:25:52.040 --> 03:25:56.040]  Construed by racist by home.
[03:25:56.040 --> 03:26:03.040]  Do I need you to tell me what is racist or not?
[03:26:03.040 --> 03:26:08.040]  How about free speech and free thinking?
[03:26:08.040 --> 03:26:15.040]  How about how the United States has taught us to hate other countries?
[03:26:15.040 --> 03:26:17.040]  Hate them Russians, huh?
[03:26:17.040 --> 03:26:19.040]  Oh, what about that?
[03:26:19.040 --> 03:26:20.040]  That's all right.
[03:26:20.040 --> 03:26:24.040]  Those Iranians, oh yeah, hate them.
[03:26:24.040 --> 03:26:27.040]  But they keep going on.
[03:26:27.040 --> 03:26:34.040]  Misogynist and homophobic or depict graphic sex,
[03:26:34.040 --> 03:26:42.040]  violence, gore, illegal drugs, or hate things.
[03:26:42.040 --> 03:26:48.040]  Who is deciding this, and this, for all the years that I've known Alex Jones,
[03:26:48.040 --> 03:26:53.040]  tuned into info wars, this is not the agenda.
[03:26:53.040 --> 03:26:56.040]  This is not what's being talked about.
[03:26:56.040 --> 03:26:59.040]  Who are these people to determine this?
[03:26:59.040 --> 03:27:09.040]  What are we all too stupid, and they have to tell us what to do and how to do it?
[03:27:09.040 --> 03:27:12.040]  There's a very disturbing article here.
[03:27:12.040 --> 03:27:21.040]  Info wars is the tip of the giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube
[03:27:21.040 --> 03:27:28.040]  to tear our nation apart, blab a little another low life.
[03:27:28.040 --> 03:27:33.040]  I can say that, and you could decide for yourself, because he's a politician.
[03:27:33.040 --> 03:27:36.040]  And Google up the definition of politician.
[03:27:36.040 --> 03:27:42.040]  Someone who's manipulative or devious to gain advancement within an organization.
[03:27:42.040 --> 03:27:47.040]  That quote was by Senator Chris Murphy.
[03:27:47.040 --> 03:27:51.040]  Yep.
[03:27:51.040 --> 03:27:57.040]  One piece of propaganda after another.
[03:27:57.040 --> 03:28:07.040]  And that's why it's really important for everyone listening to put your money where your heart and your mind is, and support info wars.
[03:28:07.040 --> 03:28:15.040]  We got to fight the bullies, save the internet, save info wars super special.
[03:28:15.040 --> 03:28:21.040]  The mainstream media is doing everything they can to shut info wars down.
[03:28:21.040 --> 03:28:32.040]  While the tech giants work to remove us from the internet, we're dropping our credible product prices to help you support the info war.
[03:28:32.040 --> 03:28:47.040]  So look at info war, some of the great deals there, the current specials, brain force, plus 40% off, plus free shipping, and much, much more.
[03:28:47.040 --> 03:28:53.040]  Read back in a little bit, and remember, money, where your mind and heart is.
[03:29:17.040 --> 03:29:30.040]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[03:29:30.040 --> 03:29:34.040]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey purified water.
[03:29:34.040 --> 03:29:42.040]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size, for incredibly delicious water now and in an emergency.

[03:30:19.040 --> 03:30:20.040]  You are the info war.
[03:30:20.040 --> 03:30:29.040]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever, that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter, and sign up via email,

[03:31:13.040 --> 03:31:16.040]  workout, brain formula that is safe.

[03:31:53.040 --> 03:31:57.040]  We knew it was coming, the whole thing was for me leg.
[03:31:57.040 --> 03:32:10.040]  First demonize info wars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia,
[03:32:10.040 --> 03:32:11.040]  and then wallah.
[03:32:11.040 --> 03:32:21.040]  Two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[03:32:21.040 --> 03:32:30.040]  You can find info wars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[03:32:30.040 --> 03:32:40.040]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your emails so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[03:32:40.040 --> 03:32:50.040]  But whatever you do, tell folks about info wars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and coin out.
[03:32:50.040 --> 03:32:52.040]  So this is the verboten info.
[03:32:52.040 --> 03:33:21.040]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:33:22.040 --> 03:33:37.040]  I want to be very, very appreciative and implore all of you at listening to do what you can.
[03:33:37.040 --> 03:33:55.040]  To buy those great info war products and to support Alex Jones and the team on info wars for the great work that they do in helping to inform us at a time when the prostitutes are the only people that they used to be called journalists are selling what their corporate
[03:33:55.040 --> 03:34:13.040]  jobs are telling them to put out. I was talking about primary prostitute paper over here the New York Times, of course they call themselves the paper record, what by their track record I call them the toilet paper record.
[03:34:13.040 --> 03:34:23.040]  And I read all information I just want to see what's going on out there and then I decide for myself because the model again of the trends journal is think for yourself.
[03:34:23.040 --> 03:34:47.040]  So, in following up this full page that they did on Alex Jones, free speech experts argue against info wars founder free speech experts scholars they call them four of them.
[03:34:47.040 --> 03:34:56.040]  They don't mention their names, but these are their experts. How's that for propaganda propaganda is okay.
[03:34:56.040 --> 03:35:07.040]  But conspiracy theories. In other words, if you don't believe in the crap that they're trying to sell you and won't swallow it, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:35:07.040 --> 03:35:20.040]  But propaganda is fine. Again, I'm going to show you how they sway the public with dirty words and a vile pitch.
[03:35:20.040 --> 03:35:40.040]  The removal of Mr. Jones and info wars came after months of mounting pressure on technology companies to spread to tackle the spread of misinformation online.
[03:35:40.040 --> 03:35:52.040]  Months of mounting pressure. Hey, you're supposed to be a reporter, little boy and girl who wrote this. I shouldn't say boy or girl.
[03:35:52.040 --> 03:36:02.040]  I don't want to be misogynist on the girl in so I can say boy, little boy, because that's what they would accuse me of.
[03:36:02.040 --> 03:36:16.040]  Who wrote this? Alan fewer. Yeah, fewer brains than a P. Oh, I didn't mean that kind of P. P. E. A.
[03:36:16.040 --> 03:36:36.040]  I'm going to get censored now. Who did the mounting pressure come from? How come you're not saying that? I'll tell you why because we're prostitutes and get paid to put out what we're told.
[03:36:36.040 --> 03:36:52.040]  Alan. Mr. Jones and info war have for years used social media to push unfounded conspiracy theories. How about founded conspiracy theories?
[03:36:52.040 --> 03:37:10.040]  Oh, if you don't believe in 9 11, the way they tell you, but we can't ever see all the documents because we're not allowed to, then you're a conspiracy theorist. If you don't believe of why Iraq war was started based on lies, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:37:10.040 --> 03:37:23.040]  If you look at how the banksters are holding us all up and robbing the nation and the world of all its wealth, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:37:23.040 --> 03:37:47.040]  This is the quote from the experts. The scholars scholars quote full speech does not serve. The public interest, the way that true speech does the scholars wrote. And indeed, there is no constitutional value in false statements of that.
[03:37:47.040 --> 03:38:01.040]  Like Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda. Oh, that's only a war or what Obama lied about Gaddafi and destroy their whole nation and turn it into a hellhole.
[03:38:01.040 --> 03:38:14.040]  And a haven for them terrorists. That's fine. Those lives are permitted because they sell them.
[03:38:14.040 --> 03:38:31.040]  And then he goes on quote it will allow unscrupulous news organizations to couch their language as opinions and mask their meaning with implication and insinuation. The scholars wrote scholars.
[03:38:31.040 --> 03:38:45.040]  I don't want to cause any more trouble for Alex, then, you know, he's going through so I could like to use another word to describe these scholars, but I get censored on that one.
[03:38:45.040 --> 03:39:10.040]  And it was very important to understand it's not only info wars, it's under attack. In July 2017, the world's socialist website published an expose of the fact that charges to Google search or algorithms had massively slashed traffic to left wing anti war and socialist publications.
[03:39:10.040 --> 03:39:28.040]  Over the course of dozens of articles, the world's socialist organization established at Google together with other technology monopolies has engaged in a campaign of censorship of oppositional viewpoints in close.
[03:39:28.040 --> 03:39:37.040]  You ready for this collaboration with the United States intelligence apparatus.
[03:39:37.040 --> 03:39:47.040]  In suing you every claim made by the world's work WSWS, initially denied by the technology giants has been established as fact.
[03:39:47.040 --> 03:40:01.040]  Google, Facebook and Twitter have all acknowledged that I've promoted quote trusted news outlets, while restricting the distribution of quote alternative sources of information.
[03:40:01.040 --> 03:40:18.040]  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has stated that is promoting publications like the toilet paper of record, the New York slime.
[03:40:18.040 --> 03:40:45.040]  The Wall Street Journal, while demoting and blocking quote sites that have intense following like Alex Jones and quote. This is Zuckerberg's quote, but supposedly quote, not widely trusted beyond their core audience, not widely trusted beyond their core audience.
[03:40:45.040 --> 03:40:56.040]  This is total censorship. And more than that, it's a shot between the eyes of every thinking person.
[03:40:56.040 --> 03:41:12.040]  In other words, if it's not trusted beyond their core audience, you got to believe the crap that's being shoveled out by MSNBC, CBS, ABC, Fox and all of the rest.
[03:41:12.040 --> 03:41:29.040]  If you have a core audience of people that believe in your belief systems and information that you're putting out there, that's not acceptable by the Zuckerberg.
[03:41:29.040 --> 03:41:41.040]  Companies justify the actions against Mr. Jones claiming he violated policies against hate speech and harassment.
[03:41:41.040 --> 03:41:48.040]  This is a fundamental violation of freedom of speech. It's an outrage.
[03:41:48.040 --> 03:41:56.040]  And I believe as well, the conspiracy theory that they're setting us up for something big.
[03:41:56.040 --> 03:42:04.040]  And it's going to be much bigger than this. And we will be closed out, locked down and silenced.
[03:42:04.040 --> 03:42:25.040]  Another front page from yesterday's toilet paper. Students return to armed guards and lockdowns, campus shooting fears, efforts to keep children safe as schools open across the U.S.S.A.
[03:42:25.040 --> 03:42:37.040]  Prisons, not schools. Hey, you want to home school your child? Or you want to send them to brainwashing at one of the school prisons near you?
[03:42:37.040 --> 03:42:43.040]  Because that's what's coming down. They're taking away our rights. They could care less about them.
[03:42:43.040 --> 03:42:52.040]  So again, do what you can to support Alex Jones, get those great specials that are available now, and we'll be right back.
[03:42:52.040 --> 03:43:04.040]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue. InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower and sink in your home.
[03:43:04.040 --> 03:43:09.040]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[03:43:09.040 --> 03:43:22.040]  The Pro Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system that will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[03:43:22.040 --> 03:43:32.040]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[03:43:32.040 --> 03:43:39.040]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.

[03:43:52.040 --> 03:44:10.040]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarsstore.com,

[03:45:54.040 --> 03:46:00.040]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[03:46:00.040 --> 03:46:14.040]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now. I remember back when infowars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and it had to load down the page on my dial-up into there, and I thought it was pretty cool.
[03:46:14.040 --> 03:46:21.040]  I've read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your get, and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[03:46:21.040 --> 03:46:30.040]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the SuperMail Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, MycoZX body. It's all amazing. Thank you, brother.
[03:46:30.040 --> 03:46:43.040]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit, and it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[03:46:43.040 --> 03:46:51.040]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[03:47:14.040 --> 03:47:18.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:24.040 --> 03:47:36.040]  Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back. And of course, some Gerald Salenti sitting in for Alex Jones, a real honor for me to be hosting a show on Infowars.
[03:47:36.040 --> 03:47:56.040]  I highly respect Alex Jones, known him for many, many years, the true gentleman, his passion is for freedom, love, joy and beauty, all elements that I too fight for and live for, and do what you can to keep that going.
[03:47:56.040 --> 03:48:12.040]  This is from my magazine, The Trends Journal, when it was an eight-page magazine 20 years ago. It actually began in 1991. This is 1997. Of course, now it's about 50 pages.
[03:48:12.040 --> 03:48:30.040]  Media dumb-sizing trend, jeopardizing nation. Right there. This has been going on for a long time. And what Alex Jones has done and what we've done and others has filled that gap. This is what I wrote. Again, this is 20 years ago.
[03:48:30.040 --> 03:48:49.040]  Despite proclamations that high technology has created a rich new information age, America has entered a period of information ignorance, an era in which the majority of people are uninformed about the news and events shaping their lives in the nation's future.
[03:48:49.040 --> 03:49:07.040]  This knowledge deficit is in large part a result of media dumb-sizing. A trend that's leaving society and its institutions unprepared for the revolutionary changes that will define life in the new millennium.
[03:49:07.040 --> 03:49:26.040]  And I go on to make the cases of what was going on back then to put it into perspective. The media victims of corporate downsizing increasingly passed off unimportant information as news.
[03:49:26.040 --> 03:49:41.040]  Besides jeopardizing the nation's high standards, a professional journalism this trend toward ersatz news lowers society's collective consciousness and expectations.
[03:49:41.040 --> 03:49:56.040]  Hey, I don't know what Stormy Daniels is doing right now. Need any more proof? And this is very important when I read you next. And for those of you that are young, you won't remember this.
[03:49:56.040 --> 03:50:12.040]  Media dumb-sizing began in the in earnest in the 1980s. The three major TV networks facing new competition and financial pressure cut the hearts out of the news gathering operations.
[03:50:12.040 --> 03:50:29.040]  They closed bureaus, slashed staffs and replaced seasoned journalists and expert commentators with lower priced journeymen and overpriced quote, star quality readers.
[03:50:29.040 --> 03:50:53.040]  And that's all you got. And they call a lemon like on CNN, a star quality or a Chris Cuomo, a little boy of nothing. If his daddy wasn't Mario, born on third base like Anderson Cooper, whose mama was a Vanderbilt and also he was an intern with the CIA,
[03:50:53.040 --> 03:51:10.040]  born on third base and thought they had a home run. When I used to be on CNN all the time, I remember Chris Cuomo. He was a nice young guy at the time. He was doing sports and pop culture, two aides with him, ushering him around.
[03:51:10.040 --> 03:51:35.040]  That's what the media has become. The concept of news continues to be devalued with the networks that fastedly insisting the OJ saga, the Who Did It? Joan Benet Ramsey case and the sexploits of national personalities warrant saturation coverage.
[03:51:35.040 --> 03:51:47.040]  That's what the news have become. I'm a trend forecaster. This is 21 years ago. And again, now what do you hear about Stormy Daniels with that guy Cohen did? You know, one stupid thing after another.
[03:51:47.040 --> 03:52:01.040]  And people like myself with the Trends Journal, of course, Infowars, which I'm honored to be on, are giving you the alternatives to the dumbed down news of America.
[03:52:01.040 --> 03:52:16.040]  And that's why it's important for you to support Infowars and take advantage, fight the bullies, save the Internet, save Infowars and look at some of their super specials.
[03:52:16.040 --> 03:52:45.040]  I mean, Force Plus, 40% off plus free shipping, SuperMail Vitality, which I enjoy, and Super Female Vitality, 50% off plus free shipping, Secret 12, Winter Sun, both of those 40% off plus free shipping, DNA, Force Plus, 50% off plus free shipping,
[03:52:45.040 --> 03:53:07.040]  Survival Shield, X2, 40% off, Alpha Power, 50% off, all those with free shipping, all super blue products, 50% off, Ultimate Fish Oils Combo, 40% off, and BioTrue Selenium, 50% off, all with free shipping.
[03:53:07.040 --> 03:53:23.040]  Do what you can to buy what you can, give this to friends trying to get healthy. Because to me, the only way to survive and thrive is to be in the best physical, emotional and spiritual condition you can be in.
[03:53:23.040 --> 03:53:30.040]  And of course, that means eating healthy and staying healthy, one of the key factors in it.
[03:53:30.040 --> 03:53:44.040]  I want to read to you a story in the toilet paper on Sunday. He wants to debate and offers $10,000 per reply, no, and stop the cat calling.
[03:53:44.040 --> 03:54:05.040]  This is this guy, Ben Shapiro, who offered $10,000 to have Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the woman that won the election primary against the Democrat in New York, recently, unexpectedly.
[03:54:05.040 --> 03:54:29.040]  And here's how she replied. Miss Ocasio-Cortez, who transferred Mr. Crowley, a long time and powerful member of Congress and Queens, likened the offer to cat calling, the practice of whistling or making unwanted comments to women who pass by on the street.
[03:54:29.040 --> 03:54:50.040]  In a Twitter post on Thursday night, she roundly rejected his proposal, quote, I don't owe a response to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions and also like cat calling.
[03:54:50.040 --> 03:54:56.040]  For some reason, they feel entitled to one.
[03:54:56.040 --> 03:55:06.040]  His reply, I would offer Bernie Sanders $50,000 a debate. Absolutely. This is this guy, Shapiro.
[03:55:06.040 --> 03:55:13.040]  What in the world does this have to do with her being a woman?
[03:55:13.040 --> 03:55:29.040]  And this is the kind of arrogant stupidity and bringing down innocent people. And you read that quote by the editorial person that the New York Slime brought on who hates old white men.
[03:55:29.040 --> 03:55:48.040]  Yep. Or words to that effect don't have the exact quote. And that's what's going on over here. Cat calling? The guy offered to debate her. And $10,000 to the campaign.
[03:55:48.040 --> 03:56:00.040]  That's what's going on in the country. And it ties into the censorship movement. You're censored. If you don't say everything, that's politically correct.
[03:56:00.040 --> 03:56:07.040]  And politically correct is an oxymoron because there's nothing correct about anything political.
[03:56:07.040 --> 03:56:18.040]  Again, Google up the definition, a person that is manipulative and devious, typically to gain advancement within an organization.
[03:56:18.040 --> 03:56:47.040]  So when you're politically correct, you're manipulative and devious, and you are also a Alexandria, a Casio Cortez, because this is a cheap shot against men for making a statement that if it came from a woman, she would never have said that.
[03:56:47.040 --> 03:56:57.040]  So wrapping it up quickly, watch out what's going on in the markets, particularly with the sanctions that are just another form of economic terrorism.
[03:56:57.040 --> 03:57:03.040]  Approve them or disapprove them. Bringing down countries. You see what's going on in Turkey. Turkey.
[03:57:03.040 --> 03:57:14.040]  Emerging market currencies are crashing. They're loaded with debt. How they have to pay back that debt? With declining currencies, it's going to cost them a lot more.
[03:57:14.040 --> 03:57:27.040]  Gold now, we're looking at a 1,200 range where we said it would go and saying it for a year. We believe gold is at the bottom. I do not give financial advice.
