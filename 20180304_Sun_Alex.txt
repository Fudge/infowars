[00:00.000 --> 00:29.960]  Well, Info Wars is in the middle of one of the biggest news stories.
[00:29.960 --> 00:35.600]  In the news cycle for the last week, and I don't say that as if I'm happy about that.
[00:35.600 --> 00:36.600]  I don't say that.
[00:36.600 --> 00:40.880]  Oh, and Troyer riding shotgun here with me like I'm happy about that.
[00:40.880 --> 00:46.480]  I am very, very, very upset this is going on because we see Apple moving to communist
[00:46.480 --> 00:49.720]  China saying they're going to merge with the government to be state run because they can
[00:49.720 --> 00:51.080]  be tax exempt.
[00:51.080 --> 00:52.080]  That's in Reuters.
[00:52.080 --> 00:54.080]  That's in AP, but they report it like it's boring.
[00:54.080 --> 00:55.080]  This is just sensational.
[00:55.080 --> 00:59.360]  We've got the other telecoms and other big tech giants saying they're going to line up
[00:59.360 --> 01:00.360]  with China.
[01:00.360 --> 01:02.560]  So they can have entry into the market.
[01:02.560 --> 01:06.240]  So that's what's happening right now, Owen.
[01:06.240 --> 01:14.720]  And Info Wars is in the middle of just absolutely giant, massive censorship.
[01:14.720 --> 01:17.920]  And what's crazy is I'm going to go through this today is I've talked to some people that
[01:17.920 --> 01:19.960]  work at YouTube that are pretty high level.
[01:19.960 --> 01:21.480]  Those are obviously off record.
[01:21.480 --> 01:25.320]  They've gone in and looked at the accounts and they say the problem is YouTube gives
[01:25.320 --> 01:30.200]  too many people access, Google does to the people that work at YouTube.
[01:30.200 --> 01:34.000]  And so there are tens of thousands of people that have access.
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.640]  And you've got SJWs that as an act of rebellion, just like deep state won't do what the president
[01:39.640 --> 01:43.880]  says, even though it's constitutional or won't follow laws, there is a mutiny inside YouTube.
[01:43.880 --> 01:46.600]  Now that's what Bloomberg said on Wednesday.
[01:46.600 --> 01:48.800]  That's what the Verge said on Wednesday.
[01:48.800 --> 01:50.160]  That's what we said.
[01:50.160 --> 01:55.300]  And I'm giving the Verge and Bloomberg credit because their reporters went out and actually
[01:55.300 --> 01:57.560]  found out what was going on.
[01:57.560 --> 01:59.800]  They found out what was happening.
[01:59.800 --> 02:07.000]  And they reported that indeed we had been wrongfully terminated, blocked, frozen.
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.080]  The account was frozen one step from being deleted with two strikes and that thousands
[02:11.080 --> 02:12.080]  of others had.
[02:12.080 --> 02:20.160]  I mean, mainline famous preachers, liberals, centrist, any liberals like Sarkat of Akkad
[02:20.160 --> 02:24.960]  or Sarkan of Akkad were very popular who said, hey, I'm a liberal, but don't ban conservatives.
[02:24.960 --> 02:26.800]  He got banned.
[02:26.800 --> 02:27.920]  Mike Adams of Natural News.
[02:27.920 --> 02:28.920]  He's still currently banned.
[02:28.920 --> 02:30.480]  Dr. Jerome Corsi of InfoWars.
[02:30.480 --> 02:31.480]  He got banned.
[02:31.480 --> 02:33.440]  Nothing to do with the Parkland shooting.
[02:33.440 --> 02:38.080]  Thousands of accounts show that's one group is they're saying there's a rebellion inside
[02:38.080 --> 02:39.400]  because they hired the Southern Barbery Law Center.
[02:39.400 --> 02:40.400]  You can't make that up.
[02:40.400 --> 02:41.400]  Come up and run it.
[02:41.400 --> 02:42.400]  We're going to cover all this.
[02:42.400 --> 02:46.920]  But the other school of thought is no, they're playing Operation Crying Wolf and that they're
[02:46.920 --> 02:51.760]  claiming it's rogue employees, but they're just banning and unbanning and blocking and
[02:51.760 --> 02:57.080]  striking people until we all just get tired and then it's a non-story because it is a
[02:57.080 --> 02:58.080]  big deal to have a purge.
[02:58.080 --> 02:59.760]  We'll have it be an on purge and off purge.
[02:59.760 --> 03:01.560]  You know, it's the old thing of World War One.
[03:01.560 --> 03:04.480]  They started going over loudspeakers, the German first.
[03:04.480 --> 03:08.200]  The Austrian-Hungarian Empire would say, don't run.
[03:08.200 --> 03:10.920]  You know, we've stopped fighting.
[03:10.920 --> 03:11.920]  Just lay down your arms.
[03:11.920 --> 03:12.920]  We're not going to attack you.
[03:12.920 --> 03:15.160]  And then they would kill them when they came over the top.
[03:15.160 --> 03:17.160]  And they kind of memorialized that as a fictional account.
[03:17.160 --> 03:21.080]  But it was a real historical battle in saving Private Ryan where the GIs about to kill the
[03:21.080 --> 03:22.080]  German with the bayonet.
[03:22.080 --> 03:24.880]  And the German goes, no, no, no, no, friend, friend, stop.
[03:24.880 --> 03:28.680]  And the American stops when he has the initiative for just a second for the German to flip him
[03:28.680 --> 03:30.460]  over and run the knife into it.
[03:30.460 --> 03:35.480]  And so the smarter money and some of my Army intel buddies I talked to this morning, they
[03:35.480 --> 03:41.480]  and some CIA folks, they think that this is a rebellion going on, but they're doing it
[03:41.480 --> 03:44.480]  over and over again until we just get tired and give up.
[03:44.480 --> 03:48.440]  And then CBS, everybody else who'd admit that this was happening, they came out today
[03:48.440 --> 03:53.860]  and said is Jones lying his YouTube's up and he's uploading new videos well
[03:53.860 --> 03:59.000]  that's because in the last nine days eight days and nine days they have put
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.040]  five strikes on four we have copies of one just disappeared and then we had
[04:04.040 --> 04:07.080]  three strikes yesterday and I was told well three strikes usually in a few
[04:07.080 --> 04:11.120]  hours or a day it'll roll over you're deleted I was told that by a source who
[04:11.120 --> 04:13.760]  could look into our account but he couldn't change it because he was in a
[04:13.760 --> 04:17.680]  different a division of YouTube but he was high level in marketing but he
[04:17.680 --> 04:21.640]  wasn't one of the moderators and so he said yeah you'll probably be gone at
[04:21.640 --> 04:25.600]  least by tomorrow I reported that we had three strikes I'll show you the three
[04:25.600 --> 04:29.720]  strikes from internally in the control panel but then suddenly those are gone
[04:29.720 --> 04:33.920]  but then they come back for the same videos again so oh and shroyer we're
[04:33.920 --> 04:36.560]  going to break but in your gut what do you think's happening of the two
[04:36.560 --> 04:39.480]  scenarios are there other scenarios I think that there's that and I think
[04:39.480 --> 04:43.240]  there's one more scenario where you have people reporting our videos and flagging
[04:43.240 --> 04:46.520]  our videos saying we said they're Christ actors so they strike it and then
[04:46.520 --> 04:49.800]  YouTube goes and reviews the videos they find out that we never said that and
[04:49.800 --> 04:53.120]  then whoever flagged that video lied about it so then they reinstate the
[04:53.120 --> 04:55.840]  video because they lied about what we said they're just keep reflagging yes
[04:55.840 --> 04:59.960]  basically because it's the same videos well the right button

[06:23.640 --> 06:32.680]  Jones well the United States is in the biggest censorship in its history not
[06:32.680 --> 06:36.920]  just by statistical magnitude because there's more people alive today than
[06:36.920 --> 06:40.840]  we're a hundred years ago or 200 years ago but I've studied history we're in
[06:40.840 --> 06:45.120]  the biggest censorship we've ever seen and it is modeled after the Communist
[06:45.120 --> 06:49.560]  Chinese and Owen shroy arrived shotgun with me here info wars dot com anchor and
[06:49.560 --> 06:53.600]  host as well investigative journalist we're right in the middle of it at
[06:53.600 --> 06:59.360]  the Wall Street Journal met with Google Facebook and Twitter the CEO of news
[06:59.360 --> 07:03.520]  core that runs the Wall Street Journal I should say said we're going to start
[07:03.520 --> 07:08.720]  with WikiLeaks Alex Jones and ISIS and we're going to ban those and set the
[07:08.720 --> 07:12.480]  precedent and then within a year there'll only be about a hundred providers
[07:12.480 --> 07:18.880]  online of on Facebook Twitter Google YouTube all of it and we'll make a lot
[07:18.880 --> 07:23.800]  more money well I saw that and people had derivative headlines that said hold
[07:23.800 --> 07:27.240]  on to your genfoil hat YouTube's coming for Alex Jones well about a week and a
[07:27.240 --> 07:31.480]  half later it happened all the fake strikes and here's the key they are
[07:31.480 --> 07:35.560]  setting the precedent with us because they think that there's enough people
[07:35.560 --> 07:39.040]  that hate us that somehow they'll just accept getting rid of free speech but
[07:39.040 --> 07:42.640]  once they've set the precedent it's for everybody so we've got huge
[07:42.640 --> 07:48.160]  developments this is one of the biggest stories thousands of articles the last
[07:48.160 --> 07:51.260]  week hundreds and hundreds and hundreds in the first few days when it kicked
[07:51.260 --> 07:54.960]  off before that so I mean we're talking the last week and a half since this
[07:54.960 --> 08:01.720]  kicked off thousands and thousands of articles and if it wasn't for drudge
[08:01.720 --> 08:05.760]  report calm info or is this big our affiliates are big and it was going to
[08:05.760 --> 08:11.920]  be a big story but it wasn't for drudge who for a week when no one else picked
[08:11.920 --> 08:16.720]  it up wrote about it and linked to it every day because he supports free
[08:16.720 --> 08:24.400]  speech we would not have gotten this big breakthrough so CNN starts lobbying nine
[08:24.400 --> 08:27.920]  days ago to take us down in three articles and two TV reports we showed
[08:27.920 --> 08:31.960]  those to you you can pull them up CNN info wars is two strikes away from being
[08:31.960 --> 08:35.040]  banned and they said we initiated it we're calling for the videos we take it
[08:35.040 --> 08:38.880]  down I've talked to the antitrust lawyers towards the center we we have
[08:38.880 --> 08:41.980]  them the thing is they have so much money and the globalists don't care they
[08:41.980 --> 08:44.600]  think they're gonna have the country sewn up the next year before we went in
[08:44.600 --> 08:48.920]  court that's why this every lawyer we talked it goes oh my god this is this
[08:48.920 --> 08:53.120]  is open and shut but see they don't seem to care so I get your take on that oh
[08:53.120 --> 08:57.080]  and these this other big news concerning new Nash saying they found evidence of
[08:57.080 --> 09:02.200]  massive Hillary collusion they're gonna seek a major investigation and so
[09:02.200 --> 09:05.080]  that's all coming up Devon you know drops the Moab of the Russian
[09:05.080 --> 09:07.720]  investigation claims there's evidence of collusion but Owen you're gonna be
[09:07.720 --> 09:10.480]  hosting yourself the special reports you're on the street covering any for
[09:10.480 --> 09:15.720]  this weekend you're gonna be taken over the second hour but yeah all I can say
[09:15.720 --> 09:22.920]  the listeners is this this is so huge because because you have CNN saying ban
[09:22.920 --> 09:29.320]  info wars and then we can go into our control panel on our YouTube channels
[09:29.320 --> 09:32.040]  that have over three billion views on our channels almost two billion on the
[09:32.040 --> 09:35.200]  main on on the main channel and of course billions others on other channels
[09:35.200 --> 09:38.240]  that we let carry our material it's all copyrights free free to air just just
[09:38.240 --> 09:47.200]  get it out there folks and my head spins because they then came out and had a
[09:47.200 --> 09:53.880]  bunch of sponsors that never sponsored us the UN Nike all these groups go
[09:53.880 --> 09:58.200]  spend 20 to 160 dollars that was their biggest sponsors and then we only get
[09:58.200 --> 10:02.960]  like a third of that or something only for like a week they went and sponsored
[10:02.960 --> 10:07.840]  us on Google which anybody can do and then so they could all announce they
[10:07.840 --> 10:11.880]  were pulling after CNN called them Friday so that's a big national headline
[10:11.880 --> 10:16.240]  look at the CNN pushes YouTube to ban Alex Jones he monetized video channel
[10:16.240 --> 10:22.080]  Breitbart daily caller company suspend ads on Alex Jones info wars YouTube
[10:22.080 --> 10:25.680]  channel up for CNN contacts them now I'm reading them because they're real news
[10:25.680 --> 10:29.600]  and actually quote real quotes and quote us and get the facts you want
[10:29.600 --> 10:33.840]  thousands of others it's CBS New York Times Washington Post it's this idea
[10:33.840 --> 10:38.520]  that I'm being destroyed that everyone's leaving me that I'm gonna collapse I've
[10:38.520 --> 10:44.680]  never had the UN sponsor us I've never had Nike I've never had it suddenly they
[10:44.680 --> 10:47.800]  were all this week we could go into the content of the fact I'm checking with
[10:47.800 --> 10:51.400]  YouTube to see if it violates rules of service because I think it does that's
[10:51.400 --> 10:54.120]  what's getting the advertisers issues and how much they're spending they've
[10:54.120 --> 10:57.800]  already published all this so I can say what they've published I'm talking to
[10:57.800 --> 11:00.800]  lawyers tonight that's one reason I'm going off early so I'm not going to
[11:00.800 --> 11:04.360]  violate people's privacy like YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and and the
[11:04.360 --> 11:10.560]  Southern Poverty Law Center hoping run this for YouTube and CNN I mean CNN is
[11:10.560 --> 11:13.960]  in my account they brag about it the Southern Poverty Law Center has been
[11:13.960 --> 11:18.360]  hired by Google for YouTube and they're in my life and then they run this stunt
[11:18.360 --> 11:22.560]  where they go get a bunch of people to spend 20 is the smallest advertiser
[11:22.560 --> 11:27.920]  160 for the week's the biggest they all put in like pennies to have their ads so
[11:27.920 --> 11:32.720]  then they can pull them virtue signal and be in thousands of newspapers against
[11:32.720 --> 11:39.520]  Alex Jones now that is a scam and they've done it and it's next level so I
[11:39.520 --> 11:44.160]  asked the question earlier to you I'm told by our YouTube sources and the
[11:44.160 --> 11:47.720]  media calls me let's give us your sources and I go no they go that's weird and I
[11:47.720 --> 11:52.760]  go oh yeah the media never has secret sources but they told us that the day
[11:52.760 --> 11:55.560]  before Bloomberg reported it last week and the day before the Verge got it
[11:55.560 --> 12:00.320]  right YouTube apologized on Wednesday saying we're sorry a lot of
[12:00.320 --> 12:02.920]  conservatives got banned because the new moderators we hired from the Southern
[12:02.920 --> 12:08.520]  Poverty Law Center 10,000 of them and jump at any time Owen it's just that my
[12:08.520 --> 12:14.440]  head spinning and then they put our channel back then they pulled it back
[12:14.440 --> 12:18.320]  down so I'm gonna go over coming up the history with the actual strikes that we
[12:18.320 --> 12:22.240]  printed off here so that people can see for themselves because the new thing Owen
[12:22.240 --> 12:25.800]  since they removed the strikes again today after putting them back again
[12:25.800 --> 12:31.240]  yesterday for the fourth or no fifth time is that now it never happened Owen
[12:31.240 --> 12:35.040]  because they failed to ban us and because YouTube managers came in and
[12:35.040 --> 12:38.560]  lawyers said you can't do this he didn't say what you said we're wide open for
[12:38.560 --> 12:43.960]  lawsuits anti-trust horses interference unfair business practices racketeering
[12:43.960 --> 12:48.920]  they're now saying and I have reporters calling me saying show us the strikes we
[12:48.920 --> 12:52.680]  don't believe you so CNN's up there they're in thousands of publications
[12:52.680 --> 12:56.720]  celebrating our channels got one strike then two then three headlines it's
[12:56.720 --> 13:01.240]  about to be taken down hooray we blew up the Death Star Owen and then when they
[13:01.240 --> 13:07.160]  fail they say we made it up Owen I've got all the articles I can't even compute
[13:07.160 --> 13:11.160]  what this is are they putting strikes in removing them so it sounds like we're
[13:11.160 --> 13:17.520]  crying wolf or is it the mutiny like the people told me and what Google says when
[13:17.520 --> 13:22.520]  we broke the day before Google said no we've got people muting inside a civil
[13:22.520 --> 13:27.840]  war in Google controlling YouTube or is it that people keep putting fake strikes
[13:27.840 --> 13:32.440]  and so it's automated and kicks back through but our channel is not automated
[13:32.440 --> 13:35.640]  because it's a partner not just a regular partner a partner partner with
[13:35.640 --> 13:38.760]  YouTube which they don't want me to talk about one back eight years just will try
[13:38.760 --> 13:42.440]  to embarrass YouTube big deal I'm a news organization CNN's partnered with them so
[13:42.440 --> 13:45.600]  I mean I get a lot of the inside baseball I just don't leak it out there
[13:45.600 --> 13:49.280]  because it's private information what the hell do you think's going on Owen well
[13:49.280 --> 13:53.520]  I actually think it's it's all of that and there's a bigger agenda to create an
[13:53.520 --> 13:58.200]  environment of thought that you're losing that you've been defeated it's the
[13:58.200 --> 14:02.640]  same type of stuff they do whenever you have to go to court for legal stuff or
[14:02.640 --> 14:06.360]  with your family they say oh Alex Jones family's abandoning him you know I had to
[14:06.360 --> 14:08.640]  hear that yesterday on the streets I'm like that's not true at all Alex spends
[14:08.640 --> 14:13.080]  a ton of time with his kids I mean so so they want to I have my I have my
[14:13.080 --> 14:18.640]  children my four children if you average together 75% of the time no no no
[14:18.640 --> 14:22.200]  no this one my newborn baby I got a hundred percent of the time since it's a
[14:22.200 --> 14:26.360]  math I have my three children 75% of the time and then I have my newborn baby
[14:26.360 --> 14:31.800]  well she's now 10 months old God time flies 100% so what's 75 if I have the
[14:31.800 --> 14:35.960]  three and then how do you average in the other one it's that's like 85 90% like
[14:35.960 --> 14:39.200]  that something I have my children 90% of the time but that's but that's what they
[14:39.200 --> 14:42.080]  do they create this environment of thought where people think you've been
[14:42.080 --> 14:45.560]  defeated they think you've lost oh you've been banned from YouTube you said
[14:45.560 --> 14:49.120]  there were crisis actors oh you lost your kids and it's all fake it's the
[14:49.120 --> 14:53.640]  same thing it's all pseudo but Alex I have to tell you it was deja vu today for
[14:53.640 --> 14:58.920]  me and I don't know if you remember this but last Sunday we you started the
[14:58.920 --> 15:02.920]  broadcast kind of the same way and you actually said something last Sunday it's
[15:02.920 --> 15:07.640]  probably one of my favorite quotes my favorite moments ever of the Alex Jones
[15:07.640 --> 15:13.640]  show you come on air and you're like you know I feel sick because we're getting
[15:13.640 --> 15:18.040]  banned they're trying to censor us I feel sick and then and then you go but at a
[15:18.040 --> 15:23.720]  fleshly level I want them to ban me at a fleshly level it's almost like sweet
[15:23.720 --> 15:27.440]  victory that they can't defeat us so they have to ban us and they're only
[15:27.440 --> 15:31.880]  going to make us bigger so as the more they ban us the more they strike us the
[15:31.880 --> 15:35.240]  more the audience supports us the more people go to the Alex Jones channel the
[15:35.240 --> 15:39.320]  more people go to info wars.com so it's this weird thing we're like well
[15:39.320 --> 15:42.600]  exactly I want them to do the right thing it hurts me they're banning us I'm
[15:42.600 --> 15:44.940]  being corrupt and evil and working with the Communist Chinese and Southern
[15:44.940 --> 15:48.120]  Barber Law Center but at a Machiavellian level I'm like don't you
[15:48.120 --> 15:52.000]  idiots get it exactly and that's where we are right now so they can try to stop
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.400]  the First Amendment and that's what they want to do but they're gonna show their

[20:06.040 --> 20:08.320]  show
[20:17.400 --> 20:23.080]  well I know this they can try to ban us they can call us lies any semitics they
[20:23.080 --> 20:26.760]  were sexually assaulting people with no proof they can make up whatever they want
[20:26.760 --> 20:31.400]  the last week they can try to take our sponsors away they already took them all
[20:31.400 --> 20:35.320]  away so then they have big corporate sponsors come back and become sponsors
[20:35.320 --> 20:39.920]  for a week as a stunt so they can pull their support and then they spent like
[20:39.920 --> 20:46.840]  $20 $50 $160 hundreds of big names so they could be listed virtue signaling
[20:46.840 --> 20:52.800]  that they pulled away from info wars they already when Trump won demonetized
[20:52.800 --> 20:58.960]  us 97% for about six months we used to bring in about $40,000 a month on
[20:58.960 --> 21:04.520]  YouTube that's in the top 10 to 1% and that wasn't that much money to fund our
[21:04.520 --> 21:09.400]  operation total and then they cut it down to about $3,000 a month and that
[21:09.400 --> 21:12.960]  hurt them so bad with thousands of conservative libertarian channels that
[21:12.960 --> 21:20.560]  they went to about 70% demonetization now but it's all regional patriots that
[21:20.560 --> 21:26.560]  are advertising and second amendment groups and universities and and and other
[21:26.560 --> 21:30.960]  organizations came and filled the gap but then to have them have these
[21:30.960 --> 21:34.200]  simulated victories I was trying to explain to my 15 year old son how this
[21:34.200 --> 21:38.040]  works he finally got it I was saying son they want to have this illusion that
[21:38.040 --> 21:41.040]  we're falling and if you're associated with us you're gonna go bankrupt to
[21:41.040 --> 21:44.720]  intimidate everybody else that if you stick your head up and you're for the
[21:44.720 --> 21:48.920]  second amendment we're gonna destroy you and listen it's not just me they tried
[21:48.920 --> 21:51.480]  to take down the NRA they're trying to take away their banking they're trying
[21:51.480 --> 21:54.680]  to say they they don't have a right to commerce that's serious racketeering that's
[21:54.680 --> 21:59.360]  serious oppression I was talking to Ted Nugent at his house I was there about
[21:59.360 --> 22:02.040]  three hours and we're gonna play some clips of this coming up the next hour
[22:02.040 --> 22:05.920]  to sneak peek so the amazing two plus hours of interviews we have and I've
[22:05.920 --> 22:09.440]  met him before about the crowded situation and he's been on the show
[22:09.440 --> 22:16.320]  probably 50 times the last 18 19 years I've been on there 23 years but I'm gonna
[22:16.320 --> 22:21.680]  talk about that right now because Ted was telling me off record no I'm not
[22:21.680 --> 22:26.640]  gonna say what he said oh and off record but but he's he said on record and if we
[22:26.640 --> 22:29.080]  don't have that clip today you can play that tomorrow in your house things I'm
[22:29.080 --> 22:35.320]  taking a few days off you about children for spring break I had a spring break he
[22:35.320 --> 22:39.120]  told me he said yeah he goes I don't need any money obviously yeah I sold 50
[22:39.120 --> 22:42.760]  million records or whatever but he said I give a lot of my money to charity this
[22:42.760 --> 22:49.040]  and that you know as you know and he said but before Trump got elected they
[22:49.040 --> 22:54.760]  were bringing in large amounts of money every year and he's more popular than
[22:54.760 --> 22:58.360]  ever that's what's popular is the evergreen you know famous stars and
[22:58.360 --> 23:02.040]  going out and playing that's only money in music and he said but as soon as he
[23:02.040 --> 23:08.960]  continued to back the NRA the last year that you talk about a sacrifice I mean
[23:08.960 --> 23:13.040]  the sacrifice he's making is is is unbelievable because he gave me the
[23:13.040 --> 23:16.280]  numbers and he was telling me about it and and sometime he said if they don't
[23:16.280 --> 23:20.520]  fix it soon he's gonna go public because it is racketeering and I told Ted I
[23:20.520 --> 23:23.400]  said you need to go public the fact that we've done this has made him back off
[23:23.400 --> 23:28.880]  quite a bit but this is savage bullying going on against the American people and
[23:28.880 --> 23:32.520]  it's got to stop it's like they'll hit you in the head if you got a mag I had on
[23:32.520 --> 23:36.320]  with a bike lock or whatever and the media or they'll shoot cops you know
[23:36.320 --> 23:40.840]  black lives matter or antifa and then CNN says well cops are bad so this is
[23:40.840 --> 23:44.680]  justice some random cop gets killed because maybe a cop did something bad a
[23:44.680 --> 23:51.000]  thousand miles away this is terrorism and when I got up here 20 minutes ago on
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.800]  air and I started the show saying communist China has allied with the big
[23:55.800 --> 23:59.320]  tech firms to help censor and they're moving their headquarters over there
[23:59.320 --> 24:04.440]  Apple is and giving the iCloud keys you read the article to the Chinese
[24:04.440 --> 24:08.520]  government because the Chinese government offered them zero tax remember
[24:08.520 --> 24:12.920]  Trump lowered our deal from 40 to 15 they just went to zero they've made the
[24:12.920 --> 24:16.720]  deal and they said they're gonna help police the internet from China and that
[24:16.720 --> 24:21.440]  this week they took Easter off the calendar a month before Easter and said
[24:21.440 --> 24:27.040]  no Christianity's basically bad pull that up I mean if I'd have heard this 20
[24:27.040 --> 24:30.800]  years ago even with my brain I wouldn't have believed it Owen this is the big
[24:30.800 --> 24:34.600]  push this is the big launch to see what they can get away with and because people
[24:34.600 --> 24:39.440]  got upset they go oh it's a mistake oh we didn't mean it but they don't
[24:39.440 --> 24:43.280]  coordinate CNN's flogging saying we called all the sponsors to get them
[24:43.280 --> 24:46.880]  removed when they guaranteed geared up the stunt of having them go advertise
[24:46.880 --> 24:51.200]  with no real money to run this I mean when you understand they're given over
[24:51.200 --> 24:55.480]  to total fraud they're given over to total lies and then you get angry drudge
[24:55.480 --> 24:59.600]  gets angry everybody links test being banned so they reinstate the channel pull
[24:59.600 --> 25:04.080]  the channel off reinstate the channel pull it off Bloomberg calls and Google
[25:04.080 --> 25:08.240]  goes no this is mistaken Rogan poise then they take us off again
[25:08.240 --> 25:12.960]  Owen shroyer what would you call this period of history because the psych
[25:12.960 --> 25:17.640]  warfare chiefs are trying to make things as confusing as they can well there's
[25:17.640 --> 25:24.280]  never been more of a centralized control over media and content and opinion so
[25:24.280 --> 25:29.120]  what you have is I mean there's a reason why info wars is the most bad-ass news
[25:29.120 --> 25:32.320]  organization on the planet there's a reason why they hate us there's a reason
[25:32.320 --> 25:36.560]  why they want us banned so you have this huge pushback and you have this huge
[25:36.560 --> 25:41.880]  awakening this this resurgence of America this resurgence of humanity but
[25:41.880 --> 25:45.520]  the power structure and the establishment and the centralized control
[25:45.520 --> 25:49.320]  cannot allow that to happen that's what they're so afraid about they're afraid
[25:49.320 --> 25:52.480]  of competition they're afraid about somebody reporting on the unethical
[25:52.480 --> 25:56.640]  business practices of Apple I mean my god the unethical business they own the
[25:56.640 --> 26:01.080]  worst factories it's one thing to work somebody 14 hours in you know a sweat
[26:01.080 --> 26:04.160]  shop that's bad enough but compared to other people starving outside in
[26:04.160 --> 26:06.920]  Guatemala you know they're happy to be there because I've been to some of the
[26:06.920 --> 26:10.000]  sweatshops and covered it Mexico in places okay yeah it's rough but it's
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.040]  kind of what America went through you know 100 years ago in the jungle T.S.
[26:15.040 --> 26:18.840]  Elliott or I forget I read the book everybody wrote at the point is is it
[26:18.840 --> 26:23.200]  exactly 18 hour work days till their fingers bleed forced abortions they put
[26:23.200 --> 26:27.000]  them on drugs to control them and they have suicide nets in the hallways and
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.320]  around the buildings because someone will commit suicide I and if you speak up
[26:30.320 --> 26:35.840]  they execute you and then they'll give you a phone and when they release a new
[26:35.840 --> 26:40.360]  phone two years three years later they make that phone obsolete they which we
[26:40.360 --> 26:44.880]  always knew and my phone works great but the new one came out suddenly it's
[26:44.880 --> 26:48.920]  ten times slower and then it came out they make it ten times slower and so how
[26:48.920 --> 26:51.840]  is I mean where are the lawsuits against Apple but this is but see that's
[26:51.840 --> 26:55.200]  what I'm saying this is why they have because they virtue signal and fun
[26:55.200 --> 26:58.720]  black lives matter and get it to all fight with each other it's all just a
[26:58.720 --> 27:01.680]  cover this is why they have to ban you because you're gonna report on this this
[27:01.680 --> 27:04.000]  is why they have to ban our videos because we're gonna report on this I
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.920]  forgot the number I saw a report between Apple and Amazon and Facebook and
[27:08.920 --> 27:15.400]  Google they bought like some like $550 billion worth of businesses in the last
[27:15.400 --> 27:18.200]  calendar year or something so they're going for full control and they all
[27:18.200 --> 27:22.560]  paid zero tax and they're going for full control okay they're going for full
[27:22.560 --> 27:26.360]  centralized power full sense they're bigger than the government and then
[27:26.360 --> 27:31.360]  Google's bigger is in the top 10 GDPs in the world okay it's bigger than most
[27:31.360 --> 27:36.240]  governments okay it's in the top 10 GDPs so there is a there is a civil war
[27:36.240 --> 27:39.360]  inside because they are reinstating it because they realize we can win lawsuits
[27:39.360 --> 27:43.040]  but that's only for now when they bring in the full authoritarianism it's over
[27:43.040 --> 27:47.360]  so here's a story they got Apple Amazon Facebook Google spent 50 million to
[27:47.360 --> 27:50.880]  influence US government 2017 that's just that's just money they spend on the
[27:50.880 --> 27:54.720]  government I mean that's not even talking about all the businesses they buy to
[27:54.720 --> 27:59.200]  just make Facebook bigger so they buy up all the competition and so what are you
[27:59.200 --> 28:04.000]  Alex your competition your competition to CNN your competition to MSNBC your
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.560]  competition to Fox your competition to ABC your competition to CBS all of that
[28:07.560 --> 28:11.960]  but you're not under their control you're not owned by news that's again
[28:11.960 --> 28:15.120]  they wouldn't care about this competition reaching this level was told the
[28:15.120 --> 28:20.720]  party line they're upset because we'll actually read and go it's no big deal
[28:20.720 --> 28:23.600]  when you work in China you put government officials over your company

[28:32.120 --> 28:35.640]  out points they don't want being discussed and have a big enough epicenter
[28:35.640 --> 28:40.080]  to then get it out and have it break big or we'll play a video that's just
[28:40.080 --> 28:43.240]  someone else's report saying I think there were multiple shooters or I was
[28:43.240 --> 28:46.320]  walking with Nicholas Cruz after the event we just play that video and they

[33:02.480 --> 33:07.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:07.960 --> 33:31.480]  here's the answer the social engineers bet that we're stupid bet that we're
[33:31.480 --> 33:35.120]  easily entertained and that we could have a giant internet DARPA controlled
[33:35.120 --> 33:40.760]  grid the web that would control us and track us and we never use it tax to get
[33:40.760 --> 33:45.240]  our freedom back but they miscalculate so now they're just flooding the web with
[33:45.240 --> 33:49.320]  all this disinformation all this fake news all this petty garbage in a hope
[33:49.320 --> 33:54.840]  that people get overwhelmed with informational overload and they can
[33:54.840 --> 33:57.640]  just come in and say we're gonna fix all this for you we're gonna start
[33:57.640 --> 34:01.560]  censoring and stopping people that say no children died and that you know no
[34:01.560 --> 34:06.080]  shooting happen that they're all child actor crisis actors but we never said
[34:06.080 --> 34:10.200]  that but once they set that precedent you get you to go well I'm for free
[34:10.200 --> 34:14.840]  speech but not for those bad guys they want so I got a bunch of other issues I
[34:14.840 --> 34:18.000]  want to get to a bunch of ribbiting footage of anti-futaking our reporters
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.040]  last week and yesterday and being arrested here in Austin and all of it but
[34:23.040 --> 34:28.880]  I also promised a lot of news I've had a lot of news email and people have got my
[34:28.880 --> 34:34.440]  cell phone call and they say prove you even have strikes again it's all about
[34:34.440 --> 34:38.400]  the stain for their readers they know they failed to ban us so far so I'm
[34:38.400 --> 34:42.360]  back and forth at least four times them banning us unbanning us just on YouTube
[34:42.360 --> 34:46.280]  them calling for our sponsors to be taken seeing and having pieces about it
[34:46.280 --> 34:56.280]  Skelter Dan rather Jordan Kepler went on to his show all of this and now they
[34:56.280 --> 35:00.760]  just say oh we didn't do it so I have to show people the actual strikes just for
[35:00.760 --> 35:02.880]  the record and our listeners are like what do you mean it's been all over the
[35:02.880 --> 35:08.000]  news they think you have the memory of a goldfish they say the average person has
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.000]  one shorter a goldfish is eight seconds the average person is three seconds
[35:13.000 --> 35:17.160]  below about 30 doesn't mean everybody's like that you can train your mind back
[35:17.160 --> 35:21.720]  to not be like it but they think you're out of sight out of mind so let me go
[35:21.720 --> 35:25.400]  over some of these headlines for you jump in any time Owen CNN pushes YouTube
[35:25.400 --> 35:31.720]  to ban Alex Jones to monetize video channel the best article from Breitbart
[35:31.720 --> 35:35.560]  he has Skelter saying just a year ago in an op-ed never since her people even if
[35:35.560 --> 35:38.600]  you don't like them it's up to the courts the side of his defamation then it has
[35:38.600 --> 35:42.680]  him quoted saying shut down Alex Jones he's pollution when they're talking
[35:42.680 --> 35:50.880]  about how I said no kids died with hog on there agreeing to it all companies
[35:50.880 --> 35:55.040]  suspend ads on Alex Jones in fours YouTube channel up for CNN contacts them
[35:55.040 --> 35:58.760]  CNN says they're doing all this yeah there why are they behind the scenes
[35:58.760 --> 36:01.840]  doing this what is up with that these people are freaks man well then I have
[36:01.840 --> 36:05.080]  reporters call me they got you claim CNNers and I go I send them three
[36:05.080 --> 36:09.520]  articles no article AP called me about this last week I sent them the art I sat
[36:09.520 --> 36:14.360]  there send them I like okay we'll get back with you thank you no story you
[36:14.360 --> 36:17.800]  don't think I'm sorry I wouldn't be shocked if Brian Seltzer is sitting at
[36:17.800 --> 36:22.120]  his computer just flagging in fours videos all day long we know it's Phil
[36:22.120 --> 36:25.600]  mud of the CIA and he says he's gonna kill Trump a fake it doesn't want me to
[36:25.600 --> 36:28.480]  say hey you can't say you're gonna kill the president so that there's like
[36:28.480 --> 36:32.280]  there's this is just the top 10 we printed YouTube it's info wars with
[36:32.280 --> 36:35.920]  third strike of free speech birds goes viral personally to that we at that time
[36:35.920 --> 36:39.400]  we had three strikes you're supposed to be banned sometimes it rolls over the
[36:39.400 --> 36:42.200]  next day and it happens my source said yeah they're there you'll probably be
[36:42.200 --> 36:46.000]  banned the next four hours yeah we couldn't even upload a video this has
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.280]  happened four times last week but they said we're banned advertisers are pulling
[36:50.280 --> 36:53.200]  ads from Alex Jones show YouTube channel and that's meant to get people
[36:53.200 --> 36:57.520]  locally to hear it on AM and FM and think oh I'll do the same but then again
[36:57.520 --> 37:01.640]  they're the most of them never advertised or just advertised this week the
[37:01.640 --> 37:06.400]  smallest advertisement $20 just so they could pull in virtue signal and see
[37:06.400 --> 37:11.040]  it admits they cook the whole thing up but but really how is it how I mean this
[37:11.040 --> 37:13.960]  is like you go into a restaurant order a cup of coffee because you on the
[37:13.960 --> 37:17.600]  restaurant across the street just so you can say to the paper I found a roach leg
[37:17.600 --> 37:20.960]  in my coffee and then you go put the roach in the coffee of course yeah but
[37:20.960 --> 37:26.400]  but how is this not illegal think about it Alex they whoever it was flags the
[37:26.400 --> 37:29.800]  videos no singing in says they did and then said and then where they say they
[37:29.800 --> 37:33.800]  say that info wars says that David Hogg is a crisis actor or info war says that
[37:33.800 --> 37:38.480]  they're all crisis actors but we never said it and so now that's what permeates
[37:38.480 --> 37:41.640]  though that's what gets out into the to the mainstream and then that's the
[37:41.640 --> 37:45.560]  excuse to in free speech when thousands of other conservative accounts were banned
[37:45.560 --> 37:50.200]  Christian account or Facebook YouTube Twitter no one's even they're just
[37:50.200 --> 37:57.080]  talking about us but it's a big story is the big story is big story is and I've
[37:57.080 --> 38:03.080]  read this in the trade publications before Ted Nugent would sell out 50,000
[38:03.080 --> 38:08.160]  20,000 10,000 person in smaller town arenas everywhere he's a best-seller they
[38:08.160 --> 38:12.040]  told him all the bit the three big concert companies you denounce guns and
[38:12.040 --> 38:16.240]  leave the NRA and we'll let you be number one because people love him and
[38:16.240 --> 38:21.560]  they love that genre and he says no so it's costing him I'm not gonna say the
[38:21.560 --> 38:24.200]  number but again people say well he's already rich the point is if they can
[38:24.200 --> 38:29.480]  get him they can get us all continuing as advertisers flee Alex Jones claims
[38:29.480 --> 38:34.000]  his YouTube band will come today Gizmodo so Gizmodo's been cheerleading the day
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.200]  before info wars is about to be banned was their headline but see now oh he
[38:38.200 --> 38:43.240]  claims so when you report on it it's fake news when they report on it yes
[38:43.240 --> 38:46.600]  major when you have three strikes your band but instead it just sat there
[38:46.600 --> 38:49.480]  because I guess they have a hold on the account as they know their own employees
[38:49.480 --> 38:52.680]  are going in and doing it even though it's not true this is major brands express
[38:52.680 --> 38:56.840]  concern after YouTube runs their ads on Alex Jones channel and again they've got
[38:56.840 --> 39:01.680]  ad buyers that put their ads in for the PR stunt these people never advertise
[39:01.680 --> 39:05.200]  with us yeah I just I find it I found a cockroach in your coffee shop sir yeah
[39:05.200 --> 39:08.440]  we have Alex Jones holding info words at YouTube's community standards is the
[39:08.440 --> 39:13.120]  first step towards me being arrested and killed media matters that's what they do
[39:13.120 --> 39:16.040]  yeah first they silence you then they demonize you then they arrest you then
[39:16.040 --> 39:19.120]  they kill you yeah that's how it works and that's my that's any leftist death
[39:19.120 --> 39:24.120]  cult advertisers ask that YouTube to pull ads from Alan Jones CBS news and the
[39:24.120 --> 39:27.840]  CBS goes on to say no one's pulling in he has no strikes this is when the channel
[39:27.840 --> 39:32.480]  was shut down yesterday didn't exist so see it's next level they're banning us
[39:32.480 --> 39:35.240]  but it's not happening well it's almost like now they don't even know what to
[39:35.240 --> 39:38.920]  report because it's because YouTube's going back and forth so now they're
[39:38.920 --> 39:42.760]  they're reporting Alex Jones is banned and then you're banned and then they
[39:42.760 --> 39:47.200]  lift it and you're back and they're like well what happened I he lied he is the
[39:47.200 --> 39:50.880]  bad guy pull your ads play everyone's pulling their ads from the failure Alex

[39:59.000 --> 40:03.920]  mark documents this they're the ones running it and then again that's March
[40:03.920 --> 40:10.840]  3rd that's yesterday but CNN pushes YouTube to ban Alex Jones demontizes
[40:10.840 --> 40:16.000]  video 20 a Century Fox Paramount Network pull ads from info wars Alex Jones
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.640]  says YouTube will delete info or show yeah we had three strikes shitting there
[40:19.640 --> 40:22.600]  and we talked to one of the people YouTube they said yeah I guess it hasn't

[47:32.200 --> 47:37.680]  info wars comm studios it's alex jones you know one of the producers matt was
[47:37.680 --> 47:41.160]  pointing out that info wars is a wild card they don't know what we're gonna
[47:41.160 --> 47:44.080]  say that what we're gonna do they know we're not controlled by them they know
[47:44.080 --> 47:48.560]  there's eyewitnesses or reports the hostage rescue team gave us intel about
[47:48.560 --> 47:51.640]  the gun running and how he was meeting with a muslim group and that's pretty
[47:51.640 --> 47:56.640]  much all come out now and in Vegas so they're scared that we're a conduit that
[47:56.640 --> 48:00.720]  will tell you Hillary's having convulsions every 45 minutes the secret
[48:00.720 --> 48:04.800]  service told us she has a black ambulance and then we should just follow
[48:04.800 --> 48:09.840]  her she's gonna fall down our reporters caught her collapsed for an hour a week
[48:09.840 --> 48:15.080]  before and Cleveland Ohio but didn't get him running over the stretchers and
[48:15.080 --> 48:19.080]  everything but the next week then somebody else caught her falling down in
[48:19.080 --> 48:22.760]  New York so that's what they're scared of just like they're scared of you that's
[48:22.760 --> 48:26.040]  why websites are getting rid of the mainline newspapers get rid of the
[48:26.040 --> 48:30.640]  comment sections and everything because they don't want you interacting on well
[48:30.640 --> 48:34.960]  who was it that reported that the real Russian collusion was with Hillary
[48:34.960 --> 48:40.520]  Clinton years ago that was info wars now it's coming out see they can't run
[48:40.520 --> 48:45.520]  their little psyops and by the way how do we know it's already out there with
[48:45.520 --> 48:51.760]  FBI investigations and again New York Times articles in 2015 the mainstream
[48:51.760 --> 48:55.640]  media used to do some journalism and some fake news to act credible they've
[48:55.640 --> 48:59.240]  just gone full line now we only know all this stuff because it was in the New
[48:59.240 --> 49:04.400]  York Times in 2010 and 2015 we know about fast and furious because the CBS
[49:04.400 --> 49:08.440]  Cheryl Atkinson got the documents where they said ATF agents go we're getting
[49:08.440 --> 49:12.200]  people killed they go we're gonna get the guns yeah but she got fired that's
[49:12.200 --> 49:16.680]  what I'm saying they've completed the purge of real journalist from mainstream
[49:16.680 --> 49:21.960]  media they didn't used to be this bad so how easy would it have been for the
[49:21.960 --> 49:27.240]  media to destroy Trump and keep him out of office if it wasn't for info wars it
[49:27.240 --> 49:31.000]  would have been really easy who who goes to the rallies I mean seriously who else
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.960]  goes to a Trump rally and then put the microphone in front of a Trump protester
[49:34.960 --> 49:39.040]  hundreds of times you're gonna play that next hour because I was told by two
[49:39.040 --> 49:42.320]  YouTube executives that are more libertarian there's really no conservatives there I
[49:42.320 --> 49:46.600]  mean I'm a libertarian myself and by that they're just not socially you know on
[49:46.600 --> 49:49.080]  a witch hunt or whatever they're officially conservative and like you
[49:49.080 --> 49:51.520]  know having freedom of ideas they just don't agree with some of the more left
[49:51.520 --> 49:54.560]  of stuff they told me they said you know what they're pissed about right it's what
[49:54.560 --> 49:58.680]  they keep beating yeah and they said it's people like Owen shroyer they're
[49:58.680 --> 50:01.600]  blocking those videos when Owen's average video it's like a million views it
[50:01.600 --> 50:04.920]  would have been like 10 million and they're scared because it shows how
[50:04.920 --> 50:09.000]  crazy mainline Democrat rallies are so next hour you're gonna play some of the
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.760]  these that have like 10 million views 3 million views that would have had more
[50:11.760 --> 50:16.240]  they're scared of you buddy and then what happens to that that's why info wars
[50:16.240 --> 50:22.600]  is so powerful is it becomes like a rock thrown into a pond and then there's
[50:22.600 --> 50:26.960]  this ripple so there's so there's the info wars channel and the Alex Jones
[50:26.960 --> 50:30.600]  channel and we get the millions of views on that and then our audience takes it
[50:30.600 --> 50:33.520]  and they cut it up and they make a remake and they do a remix and they do a
[50:33.520 --> 50:37.720]  music and there's no way to gauge it and they can't stop it they cannot stop it
[50:37.720 --> 50:41.800]  unless they stop it at the source that's why they have to shut us down because if
[50:41.800 --> 50:47.160]  we stop putting the content out there you know proprietarily then they don't
[50:47.160 --> 50:50.400]  have that that chamber that ripple and the only folks that got it right was
[50:50.400 --> 50:53.800]  Rolling Stone because they already cut our money off a year ago on YouTube and
[50:53.800 --> 50:56.680]  wasn't that big to begin with and they already shrunk it down to nothing but
[50:56.680 --> 51:01.560]  but but Rolling Stone said no he's using his main channels his feeder channels
[51:01.560 --> 51:05.760]  for all the rest of the web not just YouTube and for young people that he
[51:05.760 --> 51:10.440]  hasn't gotten tuned in yet I'm like okay bingo who's thinking of finally
[51:10.440 --> 51:14.000]  something in MSN they're trying to destroy us and the article you know that
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.800]  you could I think it's like a headline like you know the purge on YouTube is
[51:16.800 --> 51:20.160]  bigger than Alex Jones and they say purge him but you know you're waking
[51:20.160 --> 51:24.400]  folks up too much purging everybody else it's a very evil article but they
[51:24.400 --> 51:29.360]  finally figure out something that we're already off YouTube they've already banned
[51:29.360 --> 51:32.640]  this all over the place it doesn't matter because everybody grabs it and puts
[51:32.640 --> 51:36.400]  it out everywhere else and so again if they cut it off at the source they they
[51:36.400 --> 51:39.480]  they stopped that ripple effect we're just gonna put it on our own servers in
[51:39.480 --> 51:43.200]  HD for everybody to copy but it's never gonna stop we were only getting a
[51:43.200 --> 51:45.840]  couple hundred thousand views on those videos they banned one of you and one of
[51:45.840 --> 51:49.440]  me the first we put them up on the website in two days seven million views
[51:49.440 --> 51:53.120]  last time I checked it was 16 million views yeah if they want there's the
[51:53.120 --> 51:55.240]  problem I had to pay like eight grand for that but that's what they don't
[51:55.240 --> 51:58.320]  understand though it's like a it's like a double-edged it's like they're sick and
[51:58.320 --> 52:01.720]  twisted because they do want to shut you down so they're really sick and twisted
[52:01.720 --> 52:06.560]  evil can only think maybe one top evil generals maybe two two steps ahead we
[52:06.560 --> 52:10.560]  can think 20 ahead exactly so they always go with the hate and that's ban
[52:10.560 --> 52:15.280]  Alex censor Alex oh let's oh Alex how about this let's make a video of Alex
[52:15.280 --> 52:19.800]  and let's make him look stupid yeah you're gonna stab your dog at the mall they
[52:19.800 --> 52:23.720]  don't get a hundred million views they don't think how people go wow they're
[52:23.720 --> 52:27.400]  demonizing these people we better see what they're saying I mean that when
[52:27.400 --> 52:31.720]  when when I first discovered you it was my I was watching the news and I'm like
[52:31.720 --> 52:35.480]  what this is fake this news I don't believe any of this stuff the FBI can't
[52:35.480 --> 52:38.680]  find out who the Sarniv brothers are yet their their CIA assets they were
[52:38.680 --> 52:43.080]  monitoring the guys travel back and forth and the media spends it Alex says the
[52:43.080 --> 52:47.400]  police blew everybody up no criminal elements of our government Obama let
[52:47.400 --> 52:51.120]  them do it and that came out later and then there's a drill the same day I mean
[52:51.120 --> 52:54.640]  it's all the same they have this massive manhunt and then they can't even find the
[52:54.640 --> 52:58.480]  guy and then someone walks out into his backyard and finds him in a boat and then
[52:58.480 --> 53:00.800]  they're sitting in the shoot I mean you know we're going off on a tangent but
[53:00.800 --> 53:05.720]  the point is they can't run their psyops they can't run their fake news they can't
[53:05.720 --> 53:09.920]  run they can't start fake wars they can't elect they can't make you elect a
[53:09.920 --> 53:14.400]  fake president when there is competition when there's real news out there but you
[53:14.400 --> 53:17.400]  know what else I think that I think that why they've they've they've ramped it up
[53:17.400 --> 53:21.600]  so much now is because your your impact you used to be lighting brush fires of
[53:21.600 --> 53:26.440]  liberty now there's like it's just like the whole place is just burned with with
[53:26.440 --> 53:29.840]  all the fires you started like all of their law it's hard I don't just say
[53:29.840 --> 53:36.600]  this act like I'm humble it's the truth it's drudge report it's because I'll be
[53:36.600 --> 53:39.480]  honest the other sites are wimpy and chicken most of them I mean drudges have
[53:39.480 --> 53:43.200]  the courage and but now what drudge talks about we talk about is now on talk
[53:43.200 --> 53:48.640]  radio they understand that we force the narrative over to reality we force the
[53:48.640 --> 53:51.760]  needle way towards reality not that we're perfect we're trying to find reality
[53:51.760 --> 53:55.480]  we're willing to say what really is going on and the listeners of the real
[53:55.480 --> 53:58.480]  power let's let's be clear about the listeners they're the reason we're here
[53:58.480 --> 54:03.760]  well what happens in 1984 just if there's just one individual they cannot
[54:03.760 --> 54:07.400]  have one individual that thinks differently they cannot have one in a
[54:07.400 --> 54:11.320]  world of universal deceit telling the truths the Revolutionary Act so imagine
[54:11.320 --> 54:16.040]  here they are trying to create a 1984 civilization and they've got millions of
[54:16.040 --> 54:18.960]  people that think differently they've got millions of people that go out to
[54:18.960 --> 54:24.520]  Trump rallies listen to info wars go to drudge and they don't know what to do it
[54:24.520 --> 54:30.880]  kills them it destroys them they want to smash us out with the big crazy here's
[54:30.880 --> 54:34.240]  the thing that's what's such a good bright bar article is that they explain
[54:34.240 --> 54:37.280]  here's Stelter saying he's pro-free speech you're going to not bed and here
[54:37.280 --> 54:42.520]  he is saying Van Alex Jones he's pollution well I don't just use Nazi
[54:42.520 --> 54:45.160]  analogies like everybody else does calling anybody that's for basic freedom
[54:45.160 --> 54:53.560]  of Nazi that's what the Nazis did is they said you're pollution I mean then
[54:53.560 --> 54:58.080]  they banned you that is that's how you dehumanize somebody Brian Stelter says
[54:58.080 --> 55:01.880]  I've never said shut him off the air I've never said go to you know they're
[55:01.880 --> 55:05.600]  bullying old ladies at seeing in at their houses you know go file complaints on
[55:05.600 --> 55:09.480]  them people approached me about that and said let's use their tactics I'm not
[55:09.480 --> 55:13.800]  gonna use their tactics I'm not a sack of garbage well look at look at the
[55:13.800 --> 55:17.360]  history of the Nazis what did they do they staged false flags to blame their
[55:17.360 --> 55:21.920]  opponents okay so you've got all these Democrats the operation Hemler to start
[55:21.920 --> 55:26.800]  World War two they didn't attack Poland operation you know all those other
[55:26.800 --> 55:29.600]  operations they launched the whole Reichstag fire so this is what the
[55:29.600 --> 55:33.240]  Democrats do they staged violence at Trump rallies they caught on video Bob
[55:33.240 --> 55:37.240]  Kramer got fired Aaron Black got got named they start stuff and then they
[55:37.240 --> 55:40.600]  blame Trump supporters what else do they do they what else the Nazis do they
[55:40.600 --> 55:44.040]  censored free speech they censored anyone that wouldn't go along with the
[55:44.040 --> 55:47.840]  official narrative coming out of the official Nazi party that's what the
[55:47.840 --> 55:50.480]  left is doing today and then they wouldn't let people be in commerce like
[55:50.480 --> 55:53.720]  I'm doing the NRA and everybody else in us and then they blocked you out made you
[55:53.720 --> 55:57.080]  live in a ghetto then they got you poor and under their control then they
[55:57.080 --> 56:00.880]  started running up a few people at first and then more and more knowing how to
[56:00.880 --> 56:04.400]  always just push push push so nobody pushed back and then pretty soon you're
[56:04.400 --> 56:07.520]  in a ditch being marching to be shot in the back of the head or being marched
[56:07.520 --> 56:11.320]  into a gas chamber and now let's bring it home if you go out on the streets
[56:11.320 --> 56:14.840]  let's say you live in a big city you're listening in New York City right now if
[56:14.840 --> 56:18.120]  you go out on the streets and you have a make America great again hat on a red
[56:18.120 --> 56:20.840]  hat you will be attacked you're gonna be attacked you're gonna have coffee
[56:20.840 --> 56:23.200]  thrown at you you're gonna have someone spit on you you're gonna have someone
[56:23.200 --> 56:27.960]  attack you so I'm not trying to make any equivalencies here but the left has
[56:27.960 --> 56:32.200]  been incrementally radicalized in these echo chambers that they claim we are and
[56:32.200 --> 56:36.040]  they're out of control let me just ask for you to break speaking of the funding

[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.920]  I've had a whole bunch of newspapers call me publications and want me to go
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.400]  over this we're gonna do this in this little short segment so they can see
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.680]  this on there instead of me having to email it out to a bunch of my told them
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.280]  to tune in sometime today and then we're gonna come back I'm gonna go ahead I
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.760]  think and host the rest of the hour with you but you've got a bunch of clips to
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:51.680]  play a lot of critical information next time we'll play some clips of the head
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.720]  of the House Intelligence Committee Nunez is coming out and saying they found
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:59.160]  evidence of Hillary colluding well it's it's public I mean hell they Mueller
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.880]  ordered it and Comey ordered it shut down so that's big that's next segment
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:07.520]  but because we just joined us there's a big national move it's in thousands of
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.600]  publications misrepresenting what we said calling for info wars to be shut
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.600]  down calling for sponsors to be taken contacting sponsors trying to get rid
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:18.240]  of them they won't bail on us so then they have on YouTube where you can go
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.200]  with an ad agency and advertise as low as $20 you know part of the Internet ad
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:27.200]  and then have people pull off saying oh look there's a consensus there's a wave
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:36.120]  so it's fraud but I thought since we went over this I would give people some of
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:41.960]  these dates here and go over some of these for TV viewers so they can see
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.000]  them so document can please because the new thing is the strikes haven't
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:53.640]  happened so document can please and I'll just show you here these are the
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:02:01.240]  February 27th bands going back and then with one before that the truth about
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:04.720]  crisis actors in the Florida shooting we said there weren't crisis actors they
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.160]  were just anti-gun young people who clearly have been coached to put up this
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.680]  message you know three thousand they've been picked what is the blame for the
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.960]  Florida high school shooting they said that bullied children we said that was
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.760]  psychotropic drugs and standout okay David Hawking remember his lines we just
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.880]  say they're telling him what to say we'll say this on the video we're not
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.840]  saying he's an actor though now they've gone on Bill Maher and chosen said they
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.200]  are actors in our part of the acting department I'm not saying they're crisis
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:31.680]  actors and work there it didn't happen they're just scripting so you know
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.800]  they're parsing words here here's another one David Hawking remember his
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.920]  lines were students coached after Florida school shooting we thought hey
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.280]  let's change the name it's confusing folks when they brought that video back
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.720]  it was the truth about crisis actors in Florida shooting we change it to that
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:52.440]  saying you know let's not cause trouble because we never really said that let's
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:57.520]  just go where they coached to make it even more accurate they banned that then
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.720]  they reinstated it and as you can see that's March 3rd and then another one
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.160]  hit yesterday on the 3rd and then there was just no notice it was just frozen
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:09.840]  the account was frozen and they said there's a strike but nothing and then
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.000]  that was removed by the time we got here to print it because I was interviewing
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.920]  Ted Nugent and Waco yesterday when this happened but here's the community
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:22.320]  guidelines strikes here's the explained happened to us here's a where they try
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:27.280]  to I mean so there it is it's like it's five strikes in at nine days but four
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:31.800]  that are planted and then again I've got the Verge and people just saying show us
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:36.040]  proof there's even strikes I might use the search engine you morons it's all
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.720]  over the news CNN's calling for us to be banned again these people are so servile
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.880]  I'm telling you this is gonna be the next thing we deal with is going out oh I
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.800]  thought you got banned if a war's got bad Alex George is bad you're not bad
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.640]  you're fake news I can just see it now that's gonna be their new but then they'll
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.200]  call for us get out of here I'll kick your ass yeah you gotta be shut down but
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.240]  nobody's trying to ban you it's like yeah well we've got that I mean one of the
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.880]  videos that we're gonna play here in the second hour is them literally saying
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:07.640]  get out info wars get out Austin Alex shows can't be in Austin Texas and I'm
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:12.320]  like wait I'll be I'll be at a shoe store my children's and they always like
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:16.120]  mental patients I'll see them I go oh my god the wolf I go the black white old
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.400]  young male and I go get out here Nazi and they like run off giggling it's like
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.120]  I've seen it it's it's weird but you know what the on the on the other side of
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.920]  the spectrum though even though you deal with the crazies that that looked
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.240]  like they'd like to you know maybe stab you or something there's so many great
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:35.680]  people that come up to us too I mean there's no no no 10 to one yeah but but
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:38.480]  and they're like I'm always just happy when people want to shake my hand now
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.400]  instead of attack me but speaking of this Ted Nugent's coming up with just a
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.480]  few little explosive previews of the bombshell two and a half interview at
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.080]  his home with his amazing wife who's they're both tuning in right now we love
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.280]  the death Ted Nugent you think we've paid prices Ted hasn't even told about it

[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.960]  it's beyond that quite frankly I just went off what I saw medical doctors
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.680]  prescribing to their patients but it wasn't prescription but they were
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:31.720]  charging people a hundred two hundred dollars for the formulae and I came up
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:36.280]  with our own formula working with some scientists and developers non-gmo made

[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:21.680]  Live from Austin Texas and the heart of the Resistance it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:30.440]  That's Ted Nugent's last album he played some of his new album coming out and it
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:34.560]  was as good as Tranglehold it was as good as Cat Scratch Fever it was good as
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.440]  Free For All and right up there growing up you know Ted Nugent's one of my
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:44.160]  favorite True Americana 50 million plus record sold I met him before and he's
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.080]  been on the show I've been on there 23 years he's been on the show since about
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:52.120]  18-19 years ago probably 50 times he's invited me to his house like 10 years
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.640]  ago and it's not that I didn't want to go do but it's like Ted Nugent's inviting
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.960]  your house outside Waco and you're kind of like okay and then he's invited me his
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:05.160]  wife's amazing she's a listener you know we talk all the time off air and but to
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:10.160]  go to his house and he drives the same black hellcat I do but he got one before
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.080]  they came out that's 800 plus horsepower not 700 and it's like the same
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:18.240]  interior that he chose everything it's like this is getting weird there's like a hundred
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:24.040]  of these cars he's got 180 on the track yeah his cars like a souped up
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:28.160]  hellcat I've got a regular one but the same black hellcat same interior that
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:32.080]  we chose that like ten interiors it was like same hellcat same interior I was
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:36.800]  like they told me only like three other guys got the same interior out of the
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.520]  choices they got it Nugent's one there's one other guy so I'm like at his house
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:44.080]  going okay this is getting really weird and as he's got this really humble house
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:52.760]  you know his wife's amazing and he did more than 6,000 interviews in 2016 for
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:59.440]  the president 6,000 he worked like 15 hours a day and he's so cool because he's
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:04.000]  straight-edge he's never drank a beer he's never smoked marijuana he's never
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.320]  done nothing he's 70 and I was he looked like he was about 50 and he kicked my
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.920]  ass I mean he's not trying to act like a man he he doesn't look when
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.560]  person though I mean we try to act you think you try to act all crazy when you
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:20.560]  see him on teeth no he's a maniac well shoot I mean don't get me wrong I love
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.560]  Keith Richards too but look at Keith Richards you know compared to Ted
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:28.640]  Nugent well Nugent is a high Norse name of the Vikings that took over France in
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:32.680]  England so I mean Nugent's a big Viking that's what he is anyways the point is
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.040]  is that I'm not kissing his ass because people say oh I was a guy big of the
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:40.000]  70s 80s and 90s whatever you know that's even bigger now on tour the only
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.480]  music industry makes money is on tour and I happen to read trade publications so
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:50.920]  I saw it Nugent sells out 20,000 seat deals consistently he can sell out 50
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:55.640]  and bigger cities he is in the top 10 of folks you want to be on the trail because
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:01.160]  all of his base ones come out he told me off record and a lot of stuff on record
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.640]  I can say this you're gonna be able to have more of the clips tomorrow during
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.800]  the show we've got like with all three cameras like you know six seven hours of
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:11.520]  footage but two and a half hours of footage total on each camera he told me
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:16.240]  what was going on showed it all to me tens of millions of dollars he's turned
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.680]  down just the last year and a half since Trump got elected because they put up
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.720]  with him before that but since Trump got in and he's on the intera they said
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:28.880]  deny all this and turn against it doesn't matter you can sell out every arena
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:34.840]  here and you are banned from touring he said Alex I've got seven kids 14 grand
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:39.960]  kids what's all on video he said I don't care and it was so intense like I've
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:44.000]  been around a lot of people who put off an aura been around Trump is why it puts
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.680]  off an amazing aura around others but with Nugent the time I met him had a
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.640]  cowboy hat on he was going to interview somebody we talked a little bit he was
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:56.120]  kind of crazy and amped up because that was the enemy but the guy's like a living
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.760]  jack-o'-lantern or something in a good way and he's like wild and he's not put
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:04.360]  on an act he is wild he's the spirit of Americana that's why they hate him and so
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:07.800]  we bet you about having our sponsors ban and them trying to kick us off YouTube
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.440]  with our billions of views and all the lies and you know paying people they
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.640]  admit paying people to taste credible acidine crap and oh man what we've
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.200]  already discovered with our people on the ground this is gonna blow up that
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:23.640]  Hillary lawyer's face big time but that's a side issue but to then I mean
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.280]  his behind-the-scenes meetings with Trump that I can't get into we've got he
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:32.080]  says Trump's totally when he goes to the you know anti-gun stuff and here's from
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.360]  to show how radical they are when they call for the full ban and it I was
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.640]  given all the inside baseball and I already knew it and I was given the NRA
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.120]  inside baseball by the way that they brought in more members than ever
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.960]  they're not being hurt by all the boycotts it's the lie but Nugent because
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:51.960]  he's tied in the entertainment industry he's the only guy who they've he's given
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:56.760]  up 40 million dollars the last year and a half oh I he didn't tell me that I
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.160]  actually I miss quote excuse me I mean I'm think that's a nap that is awesome
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.400]  that is he's a hero man I love Ted Nugent I love I loved his music and I
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:11.360]  loved him and I love his spirit but being with him for three hours I mean I
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.100]  knew Charlton Heston and he was a great gentleman a great patriot but
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:19.560]  trowel told us was great but I'm telling you Ted Nugent is 1776 I got to tell
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.040]  you that guy is being underutilized just like Chuck Norris who I know behind the
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.720]  scenes is really a huge patriot but it's too humble to be the leader I mean Ted
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:34.520]  Nugent is it well in the Ted Nugent example where he's being you know and
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:39.280]  this is this happens on all industries hey who would turn down 40 million
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:43.680]  dollars and he don't we say the names of the companies any of it he wants to work
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.840]  it out I mean this guy he doesn't need it but I don't people that know him he is
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.680]  one of the big he doesn't want to say that he didn't tell me this Nugent really
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:57.200]  is a big big conservative bleeding heart Nugent gives something like a third of
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:02.280]  his earnings to children and orphanages and real stuff he's the real deal he's
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:07.240]  a maniac and so but they don't want to have him make a bunch of money right you
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.080]  don't want that guy to make money because he likes the Second Amendment he
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:14.160]  sells out I've already read about it before I would he who you're going to a
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.000]  venue at 20,000 in Austin and his Ted Nugent a bunch of other Tommy it's sold
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.360]  out he has one of the highest rating continual deals that he they he's banned
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.720]  in America but this is what the entertainment industry has done they
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:33.080]  have their liberals at the top a consortium authoritarian scum and so they
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:36.560]  run the music industry the television industry the entertainment I mean it's
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.080]  all of it the acting they they with computers deny the veterans health care
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:44.160]  just let them die from operable stuff these people are our scum and they fear
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:48.320]  anybody real and so they fear Ted Nugent and so they say all right you know what
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:53.080]  Ted Nugent this is a guy you know what Ted we're more powerful than you buddy
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.960]  we're not going to let you get that big show you're not going to earn that 40
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:00.520]  million dollars this time around unless you want to come out and say the NRA is
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.960]  bad and you want to disavow gun ownership and so Nugent gives him a big
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:10.240]  fat middle finger and and Ted Nugent was like a six foot two elf I mean he looked
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:14.880]  like like an alien dude I mean I don't mean that the bad way he looked like he
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:19.240]  was totally real totally energetic none of it was fake and I felt powerful in
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:25.520]  his presence I'm not people I don't BS I felt stronger in Nugent's presence as a
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:31.320]  man that's 1776 baby but think about you know you know you know he was he's
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:35.280]  proud they did this he doesn't care about that he's already you know so
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.640]  successful 50 million records or whatever but just that's what we're
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:41.600]  facing we're facing real authoritarianism we'll play the clips when we
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.680]  come back sorry I'm gonna go ahead I'm just so damn honored to be in the to be
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:49.800]  in the same league even though I'm not in the same you know strata I'm in the
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.240]  same we're in the same league brother our listeners are we're in the league of
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:56.760]  people that aren't scumbag criminals I mean that aren't authoritarians man I
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.320]  mean this is the second American Revolution I mean these are the new
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.160]  founding fathers I mean that's what Ted Nugent is that's what Alex we got some
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.200]  of the video we were shooting bows he was hitting over and over again in a
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:08.840]  pattern the size of a quarter and I'm good with a bow and I was shooting a
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:12.240]  pattern like that I mean it's just I was sitting there it's just amazing you know
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.040]  Ted Nugent though it's not the only one that's been blackballed like this you
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.360]  know Ted Nugent isn't the only one that's been financially strangled like
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:21.560]  this they do this any conservative in the music industry or in the you know
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:25.720]  arts and culture industry but it makes us blood brothers that we've been through
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:30.520]  this persecution because our forebears at Ticonderoga what drug giant guns 80
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.560]  something miles I forget look up Ticonderoga these are the biggest guns
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.120]  in the Western Hemisphere they were like tens of thousands of pounds and the
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.080]  and their shoes were just old leather shoes they fell apart dragging them in
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:44.200]  the last 20 miles it was blood everywhere and those guys were so strong
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.800]  they draw this was some of our ships named Ticonderoga 1 2 3 because that
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:52.120]  just means indomitable and they took them out and they took the big guns that
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:56.600]  controlled the harbor and they hauled them back to use and I mean so yeah Ted
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.920]  Nugent is great but like he said to me yesterday he said man we're together
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:05.000]  manning Concord Bridge and he means it well you've got Anthony Sabato Jr. who
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.760]  gets excommunicated from television because he's a conservative so he's
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.720]  gonna run for for Congress exactly suppressing us only makes us exactly
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:18.840]  and a top globalist once told me off record you will adapt to submitting no
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.680]  we will adapt to conquering your ass and Stacy Dash just announced that she's
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:26.320]  gonna be running for Congress as well another actress that gets blackballed
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:30.160]  from the Hollywood industry because she's conservative so that's fine but
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.160]  that but that is the answer don't by the way Owen you make me feel strong and
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.040]  push back there's not a lot of you make me feel stronger well I'm a product of

[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:10.320]  mention if people just go and try the products they will be ordering all the
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:15.280]  time I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing in
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:19.200]  particular silver bullet I as soon as I start to feel like I get a little stick
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:23.680]  you know maybe like a little raspiness in my throat I drop some silver bullet
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:27.760]  and it like I'll still feel a little sick but it won't last as long and I just
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.880]  ordered the body the alpha power and the pollen block well let me just say
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.160]  something Victor it's people like you that then find the whole operation
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:38.320]  because a very small percentage of people buy products and a very small
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.200]  percentage of them by a lot of the products so thank you but when you
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:45.480]  mention the the silver bullet colloidal silver it's got thousands of reviews a
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:50.120]  98% review it is our highest reviewed product because it is from the top lab
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:53.320]  in the country discounted high quality colloidal silver and it's not a silver
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:20:01.200]  bullet that's the closest thing you're gonna find to a silver bullet you're
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.600]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:26.200]  live raw and unfiltered by globalist propaganda it's the Alex Jones show

[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:39.640]  looking for the American resistance if you're looking for the people fighting
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:43.840]  for free market fighting for religious freedom fighting for just what works what
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:49.360]  we know is successful you found it you found it the tip of the spear oh and
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.680]  shroyers here I'm gonna play the Ted Nugent clips that the editors just got
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:56.320]  ready out of again if you do three hours almost three hours interview on
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:00.320]  three cameras that's that's almost nine hours of footage we got two clips come
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.200]  up the next segment you're gonna have a lot throughout the week as I promise to
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:07.600]  take my daughters they particularly have never seen snow except for like maybe an
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.520]  inch on the ground in Austin twice one of those 13 so I said I'm gonna take you
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:15.200]  to snow so we're going to snow we're doing it and even if they shut
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.320]  everything down I'm gonna leave you will hear like Colonel Travis at the Alamo
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.360]  while I go gallivanting around my daughter's deserve a little time but I'll
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:26.520]  be calling in and stuff but you deserve a little time to Alex I know wild horses
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:29.400]  couldn't drag you well this is this is what I'm gonna do miss you my family
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.560]  sitting around the house or you know swimming the swimming pool are going for
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.360]  height no they want to see snow I get it there's that kind of that ancestral
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:39.920]  memory going to the mountains but just during the four minute break I'm back
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:46.760]  there in the coffee room getting a glass iced tea and we've got Fox News on and
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:52.240]  it's saying Robert Mueller had we're gonna play in a moment Robert Mueller has
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:57.360]  moved on from Russia gate to now investigating Saudi influence and
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:01.320]  Chinese influence and and I'm gonna play the part about Saudi influence they go
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:05.920]  and Trump's under criminal investigation I thought it was about Russians why did
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:11.640]  Trump go to Saudi Arabia instead of Qatar or the UAE because Saudi Arabia runs
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:17.160]  the whole Middle East except for Iran it runs 80% of Islam the Sunnis they were
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:21.360]  the ones funding ISIS and funding the Democrats they arrested thousands of the
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:26.120]  ruling class who were funding the deep state here Trump went there to cut the
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:30.600]  funding off short of having a war with Saudi Arabia and the king was so blown
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.040]  away with the president they're knowing everything office briefings with General
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:37.880]  Flynn and other generals that sent Flynn whose names I'm not supposed to say
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:43.920]  some of the former heads of the and presidents advisors I'm just letting the
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:51.200]  deep state know I know all of it that was brought and then ISIS crumbled and
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:54.480]  it helped Russia defeat ISIS in the US military that's how you do it why have a
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.000]  war if you go to the Saudi King go I know you're threatened by internal
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.120]  groups using ISIS to control you the Saudis some of them don't like to see
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:04.520]  them they want to just you know be successful to not be radical Islam now
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:08.160]  they're reforming women can drive cars women can have jobs her jibs may come
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:14.160]  off Trump went and said you know I can overthrow you right now stop it and
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:19.560]  this and then they made a deal that has been spun into being anti-American we're
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.640]  gonna play the clip but I want what do you say to this well there's so much that
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:27.160]  Trump is doing that is behind the scenes that people aren't aware he's smart
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:31.560]  and and kind of like his entire campaign I mean this like you said you know he
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:36.600]  goes off to us you don't think we're the only ones that get it I mean his dad was
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.440]  a big John Berger so he's out you know he's in Scotland for a couple years he's
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:42.320]  talking to his family about this and he's you know wargaming it out trying to
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:46.360]  figure out you know when do I attack point a when do I attack point B we met
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:49.960]  with a bunch of former generals and intelligence chiefs for six months at
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.280]  least where do you think you know what though Alex they all flew into Scotland
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:57.080]  since this is since Mueller is you know the one in front of this whole thing was
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.720]  planned in Scotland you know Texas was founded by Scott's of course you know
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:04.040]  William Wallace you know the great stories of patriots and liberty in
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:10.240]  Scotland but you know there's kind of been a talking point of discussion who
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:14.160]  is Mueller what is he really doing is he for Trump is he anti-Trump is he
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.960]  actually gonna turn on Hillary in the end and this whole thing is kind of an
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:19.920]  act to pretend like he's going against Trump and then he's gonna sell
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.600]  everybody out in the end down the drain and this could all end up coming back
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:27.280]  to 9-11 to Alex and a lot of experts are saying he's threatening to bring out
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.320]  9-11 and then Jeff Bush quit so so exactly so you kind of got all of these
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.800]  different angles that are just kind of like mott's balls just sitting there
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.480]  stewing and you're really not sure what's going on and the worm is kind of
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:44.400]  starting to turn and I figure based on studying President Trump and what he's
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:50.640]  done when he said last week take the guns first do process second rightfully
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.840]  so everybody freaked out you can't say that that that was meant to get us out
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.920]  of our sleep because I read Trump weeks before was concerned we were asleep he
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:01.600]  just woke our asses up of what they were doing but he knew if they said it we
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.840]  wouldn't wake up they think he's too confident God you you weren't with
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:08.920]  Nugent and he didn't want me to say all this on record part of it's coming out
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.800]  tomorrow he'll talk about we're playing you just that was it was a wake up but
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:17.560]  so but Trump is even willing to take the heat himself to get us to wake up oh and
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:21.200]  you are and then remember Diane Feinstein like huh like a witch he goes and
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:24.840]  like yeah look at that but do you get how Trump is he said if we're not worried
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:28.920]  about Democrats we think he's so strong he will then say it to wake us up but
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.080]  then what what is happening God is that not sophisticated and and what has
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:35.200]  happened in the past every time and Feinstein can't even figure out what's
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:37.840]  happening they don't even they literally can't get it that's the that is it
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:41.240]  crazy I mean Adam Schiff gets prank called by Russians but but every time he
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:45.360]  does something like this whether it be saying that Syria is chemically attacking
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:48.280]  their own people and everyone freaked out about that any kind of drew back and
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.760]  didn't go down that road didn't start the war in Syria he told me personally so
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:55.040]  we're not going in a week later was in the news exactly he does the DACA thing
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:58.840]  oh it will sign a one and a half million to people DACA okay that doesn't happen
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:03.080]  he delivers how to take the piss out of war propaganda out of any anything they
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.440]  build is a big PR campaign he goes I agree it dissipates and then he doesn't do
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:12.960]  it and so I figure though based on if you study Trump like a like a roller
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:17.400]  coaster like arches something big is coming so something huge is about to
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.920]  Trump is going to reveal something or do something he just announced he's going
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:22.960]  to be doing a rally in Pennsylvania Trump is about to reveal something huge I
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:26.120]  think so let's go to this clip from Fox News like during the break is 10
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:31.320]  minutes ago I'm watching this and now it's not Russian now he's a shoddy pawn
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:36.000]  even though he literally cut their genitals off and made him roll over and
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.920]  stop doing stuff it's bad for them everybody else and crushed ISIS well
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:48.520]  just see it for yourself here we're Saudi agents we're all we're anyone's
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:53.840]  agents but us to buy political favor or influence with the Trump campaign through
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:58.000]  campaign money the businessman George Nader the Times reports was a frequent
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.040]  visitor to the Trump White House in 2017 advised top Trump aides on Middle East
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:07.800]  policy ahead of the president's visit to Saudi Arabia last year and Nader has
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:12.100]  been a sort of advisor to one of the leaders of the UAE now the special
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:16.400]  council is interviewing witnesses about Emirati influence and the president's
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:20.520]  son-in-law Jared Kushner's family business ties to the Middle East we
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:25.120]  could not understand why the Trump administration was so firmly taking the
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:30.760]  Saudi side in this dispute between their 80% of Islam Mecca's based there they
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:37.880]  run the whole thing they're running it so you go to who is in charge to stop it
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:41.360]  like if you wanted to in World War two before it started you go to Hitler and
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:45.800]  they have this buffoon like we don't this Democrat we don't hear you back it
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:51.160]  up Tori had I think you guys back to the start there I mean oh and this is
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.680]  Twilight Zone now well think about it just like Russia who was it there was
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.780]  it was never Russia it was Saudi collusion but it what no we're gonna
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:02.160]  arrest Trump for Saudi collusion but who actually colluded with the Saudis
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:06.320]  okay you're gonna exactly so they take everything that Hillary he was there
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:09.920]  cutting off their funding so does this once again though but does this does this
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.800]  show I mean what is this show about Mueller does this show that Mueller is
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.920]  covering for Hillary I mean what cuz that is just so weird I mean why all
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.760]  the sudden is Mueller looking into Saudi Arabia like what's going on with that all
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:22.880]  we know is why do you go to Saudi Arabia it's only the most powerful country in
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:26.320]  the Middle East not Israel Israel has nukes but it financially Saudi Arabia
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.080]  since when here's another incredible angle this wasn't even news people have
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:34.880]  been colluding with Russia and Saudi well they call me the president under
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:37.760]  the Constitution and make any deal he wants then if you want to impeach him
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:40.920]  that's fine but he has that power or you don't have to ratify the treaty exactly
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:45.160]  him going over and having them roll over this big victory now that becomes Saudi
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.600]  collusion if the president communicates with anybody that's treason this is
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:54.720]  bolder dash this is hotly bullpucky we'll be back with Ted Nugent exclusive
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:57.160]  stay with us

[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:28.840]  the resistance rallying Patriots worldwide
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:35.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:50.600]  hey we don't put good faces on things unless they're good faces but I got to
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:54.560]  tell you the fact that our people aren't easily bought or pushed around or
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:34:01.120]  controlled and are dedicated to ideology and spiritual issues is our strength but
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.680]  I want to play these clips for a go to Ted Nugent since we mentioned and we've
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.200]  got some other clips that are critical here I want to go to trach out the
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:11.320]  second special counsel maybe unavoidable and the big clip Devon Nunes who has
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:15.800]  just been under such attack talk about another guy because I can imagine what
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:19.160]  he's going through behind the scenes I can just imagine there's evidence of
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:24.280]  Russian collusion with Hillary well we know that it's confirmed Mueller and
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:27.840]  Comey separately ordered stand downs when she was Secretary of State under
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:33.880]  Obama and when she was co-president back in the 90s of Bill Clinton so let's go
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:39.800]  ahead and play first try gata here it is these witnesses have already left the
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:43.320]  department which means the Inspector General does not have jurisdiction and
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:47.800]  there are other agencies like the State Department where Michael Horowitz at DOJ
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:53.040]  has no jurisdiction whatsoever Marie over the weekend I've counted up almost two
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:58.000]  dozen witnesses that the Inspector General would not have access to were he
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.560]  alone conducting this investigation so I think we're trending perhaps towards a
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:07.760]  another special counsel because of this unique fact pattern and the fact that
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:11.640]  there are witnesses outside the reach of the Inspector General so we should have
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:18.440]  then you believe another how does one investigate itself frankly interested
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:22.000]  time let's go to Devon Nunes chairman of the House Intelligence Committee here
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  he is with the bomb show there's evidence of Hillary colluding wait there's
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.760]  evidence of ducks quacking there's evidence of bears doing you know what
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:36.040]  next is gonna tell me that seals go or that fish from in the sea or the skies
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:39.680]  blue on maybe the Pope wears a funny hat or something to yeah I don't know
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:45.640]  that's a conspiracy theory here it is that pretty much can refuses to cover
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:51.000]  this issue at all we have serious abuses that occurred with the in the FISA
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.240]  court against the Trump campaign so we continue to get back we'll bring those
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:00.200]  facts forward as as we see them and what I sent out a couple days ago was a
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:05.680]  letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and to Mr. Horowitz the IG pretty much
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:10.600]  updating him on where we are in our investigation and what they should be
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:14.680]  looking at as it relates to FISA abuse so I was I was happy to see Attorney
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:19.560]  General Jeff Sessions appoint Mr. Horowitz because we welcome more people
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:22.960]  investigating these serious issues that were so you don't agree with the
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:26.520]  president was not happy that he appointed a Mr. Horowitz you have
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:31.680]  confidence in Michael Horowitz as the Inspector General well look I welcome
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:34.760]  anybody to come help investigate because so far it's only the House
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.120]  Intelligence Committee Republicans who are actually doing anything to get to
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:43.200]  the bottom of who was colluding with Russia and when we fill this back we we
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:46.640]  have clear evidence of collusion but it's not between the Trump campaign it's
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:51.080]  between the Democratic Party and the Hillary campaign and the Russian boom
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:55.480]  just like we told you years ago it was all completely clear and that's why they
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:58.920]  blamed Trump for it because they were so scared of it that that's a good tactic
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:03.240]  actually so just briefly before I go to this Ted News you can come back with
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.240]  more on the other side and then show you the type of videos are trying to ban off
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:10.840]  YouTube they want to ban us but they want to misrepresent what we said but
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.840]  that doesn't work because we have the clips so then they just continue to
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:19.920]  engage in disinformation we are running the biggest specials in my 23 years
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:25.720]  history on air we've never done 80% off but we have like 3,000 items 3,000
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:28.640]  different products we sell them for work store.com and a lot of there's so many we
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:33.080]  don't even really promote them so when I say we got 80% off on apparel that stuff
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:35.720]  that didn't sell but doesn't mean it's not some of my favorite stuff or great

[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:18.920]  please stand with us here is Nugent on gun control and Trump is basically
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:23.520]  suffering the globalist well the most important thing that you and I have to
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:31.360]  focus on is our side the truth will metastasize the truth will spread the
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:35.600]  more we can get our side conservatives people in the asset column people who
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.560]  work for a living people who believe in the self-evident truth in our founding
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:45.680]  documents they are with us but the dumbing down of America didn't just hit
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:50.600]  leftists it's hit conservatives as well and there's a lot of knee-jerk over
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:55.200]  reaction going on and the minute Donald Trump even invites someone from the
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:59.200]  other side a lot of our friends will go why is he even dealing with those people
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:02.840]  he's never talked to those people well that's not how you get things done and I
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:08.080]  know how he operates there's a term and I'll give it to you and you can beep at
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:13.520]  whatever you want but what drives the American dream and quality of life are
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:18.320]  kickers people who bust their ass to be in the asset column make sacrifices and
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:22.720]  take risks entrepreneurs welders and carpenters and hard-working ranchers and
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:29.160]  farmers and guitar players and people that know they have to be productive but
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:34.040]  makes America great every day always has always will but a lot of our side will
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:38.000]  get angry the minute you even give a nod to the other side and you have to give a
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.880]  nod to the other side so it encourages them to speak up to expose their
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:47.080]  dishonesty and their horrible agenda president Trump is the ultimate kicker
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:51.600]  he is a strategist you can't build an empire like that if you don't meet with
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:56.640]  all concerns and get them comfortable and get them to believe that you are
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:02.040]  listening to their points of view no matter how absurd it is so it knocks down
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:06.080]  their guard now I'm not gonna get any more detail than that but all I can tell
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:10.600]  you is that when Donald Trump meets with maniacs like Diane Feinstein who will
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:16.600]  not let her constituents carry a gun while she has a 38 in her purse a king
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:20.960]  a tyrant does that that's why we wrote down after we shot the British at Concord
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:24.200]  Bridge that we can say what we want to say we can choose our religion we're
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:27.480]  gonna have a media that was supposed to monitor the government we have the right
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:31.600]  to keep and bear arms not just the king the people we the people have the right
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:34.920]  to keep and bear arms if you try to take away from us we'll shoot you we're not
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:38.280]  slaves we're not slaves we're not subject we're free citizens it was a
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:43.400]  good brand-new hallelujah experiment self-government so so when Trump meets
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:49.720]  with the other side it is the perfect strategy keep your eyes open keep your
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:54.720]  ears open watch what he does I think that his America great and remember and
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:59.120]  every one of his speeches every one of his campaign stops he mentioned the
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:02.760]  Second Amendment when was the last guy running for office that did that that
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:08.880]  often never before I believe now anything can happen I'm incapable of
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:15.120]  being shocked by anything anymore but I pay attention and I trust President
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:19.360]  Trump this guy is a clever strategist president Donald Trump will go down in
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:24.600]  history as the best president this country has ever had to support him and
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:28.560]  here's the bottom line you want you and I've talked about forever it isn't the
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:33.320]  left of the enemy it's our own guys who have their head up their ass and our
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:38.880]  rendered helpless and worthless by self-inflicted apathy if you're not
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.120]  calling your elected employees every week and demanding the Trump agenda

[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:47.000]  well we just played a very powerful clip with Ted Nugent and again I've met
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.920]  some of the other biggest rock stars out there most of them are leftist or
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:52.960]  their brain dad or their drug addicts or their cowards they might have some
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:57.280]  decent music but they're long gone but people like Dave Mustaine he's a
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:01.920]  conservative he's a patriot and they try to take away Dave's ability to tour
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:05.400]  and you notice you don't hear Dave being political anymore and I'm not
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.640]  not kidding he was had a lot of courage came on the show did a lot of stuff he
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:14.000]  cost him tens of millions he stayed at my house many times good friend I don't
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.720]  blame it came out for his family you name it not Ted Nugent if people don't
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:23.560]  know there's no money now in recording or online it's all in concerts and Ted
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:27.160]  Nugent has a built-in audience I didn't just believe him I've read it before and
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:30.760]  I looked it up last night driving home from Waco where he lives outside Ted
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:35.800]  Nugent has one of the best sell-out rates he's like an 87% sell-out rate
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:41.400]  small towns big cities and since he did this we're gonna play the clip tomorrow

[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:51.120]  hours you know total each camera Ted Nugent has been massively and it's not
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:55.000]  about the money he's happy it's that they do it to little people too we're
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.520]  talking tens of millions of dollars per tour he could have had he could have had
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:05.280]  three plus tours in like 12 5 12 to 15 million dollars a piece grows for his
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:09.240]  band everybody else killing the economy this is the bullying this is the
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:13.320]  controls why Hollywood rolls over it's why everybody's a leftist it's the cult

[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:29.320]  got another clip here it is
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:34.320]  hysteria and the dishonesty about firearms is staggering and if you want
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:37.560]  to save children's lives which all conscientious caring people want to do
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:42.920]  you don't go after lies you go after reality and science and ballistic
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:47.000]  knowledge none of them seem to have that
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:55.120]  that's his new album that's how he plays Cranglehold and the Star Spangled Banner
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:57.120]  that's all coming this week
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:17.520]  oh yeah he played his whole concert is living around unbelievable his spirit
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:22.800]  is not arrogant or narcissistic or power-grabbing it's just human male and
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:26.560]  strong and his wife spirit is just as strong they're one of the strongest
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:34.200]  pairs I've ever seen triple Magnum
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:41.880]  huge long-suggestions that's like this on a regular mind that's awesome it's so
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:47.240]  cool I can't stand it Ted you talk about how your websites your tours are more
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.760]  proper than ever but they are trying to boycott you they're trying to block you
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:53.000]  you didn't want to get into it earlier because you want to see if you can fix it
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.960]  but everybody's under unprecedented attempt to bully us out of the market of
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:08.520]  ideas yeah any of the success of your health your stamina I mean it really is
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:13.320]  an American but at the same time you've worked hard for it you've got your great
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:21.560]  coffee you've got your best-selling ammo rock star and a father and all the
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:24.720]  things you've done you've also launched a lot of great products and things that's
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:28.200]  what this country is all about that's what really I'm gonna love it this is
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:32.400]  going on Facebook every day I salute entrepreneurs across this country that
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:39.480]  I'm not mad at the crew but I told them cut me out God Almighty I love Wilson
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:43.560]  he's a sweetheart but Lord I mean just cut me out of my hair stickers ramp because
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:47.840]  I don't want to be in this video I want to have Ted Nugent man God here let's go
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:52.000]  back to it fight and take risks to start business and employ people and be in the
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.480]  asset column and the Nugent family has always stood by that we've always worked
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:59.360]  and earned our own way and when you stand up for the Second Amendment all
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:04.200]  of a sudden you have ammo with your name on it and I have gold-tipped arrows with
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:09.840]  my signature and I have my new Java but bottom line is working hard playing hard
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:13.520]  America is alive and well and I'm just proud to be one of them she may not get
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:17.120]  up early every day we work really hard every day and then we snuggle at night
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:22.040]  and get ready to start over tomorrow so I'm just here to salute people who who
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:26.840]  really earn that's the position in the evil woman we're card play our audience
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:33.840]  is at the concert yes it has a life that's only a firestorm of ferocity my
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:38.240]  music and my band and my audience's love real American soul music and rock and
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:42.680]  roll music and rhythm and blues and this is best in 2018 and this is the best
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:47.200]  year of my life in spite of the crazy world around us and I think to some
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:53.120]  degree because of the crazy world around us you see dishonesty and ignorance
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:58.680]  and hate and rotten evil and nastiness from the left and it makes you really
[01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:03.280]  confident that you're doing good there's a there's a colloquialism of
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:08.800]  battle cry that I always end up with sometimes you give the world the best
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:14.640]  you got and you get kicked in the teeth give the world the best you got anyway
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:20.920]  all right and you guys we got three hours of just it's all bombshell and then
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:24.040]  Ted's like I want you on the spur of the wild skin there it's gonna be some fun
[01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:26.720]  stuff he divided me like ten years ago and five years ago I'm glad I went and
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:30.960]  did it so so that was that was Harrison doing a great job but put me in it so he
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:35.760]  did a bad job that's that he went from a plus to him to a to a c-minus but let's
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:41.320]  go to Ted Nugent who illustrates one shotgun shell double-ock buck is nine
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:47.080]  nine millimeter rounds and then you go to Magnum and stuff but actually longer
[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:51.800]  longer it's even more so again imagine if you were using a sawed-off shotgun this
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:57.440]  is a duck gun that's really long we don't have the clip I was just told we had
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:01.560]  the clip why in the Hades and I'm not mad about this but like the
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:06.600]  communication like we have this clip that Wilson has that we're gonna play
[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:11.040]  and we're gonna give it to you and then it doesn't happen but hey that's the
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:16.440]  fun part about live radio is that it's real and we're a small crew up here on
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:21.200]  Sunday night so no teleprompters in this studio will be lucky this interview
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:25.040]  everything gets out like the bigger it is the longer it is the better it is I
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:27.080]  don't know what goes on everybody's like too busy on their own Twitter and
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:30.280]  Facebook like talking to ten people and everything I'm not mad about that it's
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:34.720]  just like well just at least come in my ear and tell me why I was told we had
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:41.520]  this but we don't have it just just just there was a confusion there was a
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:46.760]  confusion well hey hey I'm all glad about that I love that I love that I love
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:51.040]  this I love this but you got to double-check every clip when you're
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:54.520]  hosting this week you got to make sure it's in the computer and you got to make
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:58.320]  sure it plays because it's one thing to go get the interview it's nothing to
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:03.280]  care it that's what it comes down to and like I said I don't want any interviews
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:07.720]  air that have more than 10 seconds to be in five minutes I might not you know what
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:12.280]  I may not air the news interview I may edit it myself I may wait and come back
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:16.560]  in a week and do it because I can edit the way I want because hell would freeze
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:20.920]  over I could have a billion dollars and say do not put me in this and you would
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:29.360]  do it that's okay fun fun it's fun it's fun it's fun it's fun I love it I love it
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:35.000]  you love that nobody listens to me trying to get a new desk in here I just
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.480]  love it I freaking you know I just love it anyways how are you in the bed well
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:43.360]  Alex I had a had a good I was in a good mood today I really feel that liberty is
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:47.440]  rising I really feel that the worm is turning right now against the globalist
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:51.960]  and we just have to keep pushing forward they're gonna they're gonna try to
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:55.360]  ban us and censor us they're gonna price stage more events false flags what
