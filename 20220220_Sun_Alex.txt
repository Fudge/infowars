[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  You can cut the tension with a knife.
[00:07.000 --> 00:16.000]  It's a Sunday, February 20th, 2022.
[00:16.000 --> 00:24.000]  Info wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:24.000 --> 00:28.000]  I come to you from Austin, Texas.
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  I'm very honored and blessed to be here, I know every day, alive and on air.
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  Still having some semblance of free speech in these dark days is a real blessing,
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.000]  and I place my trust and faith and soul in God's hands.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  But God helps those that helps themselves and gave us the good wits
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.000]  and will and courage and common sense and friends and family
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  and other random people you meet on the road who also want freedom
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  to be able to stand up against this evil.
[00:59.000 --> 01:01.000]  Evil always makes its move.
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.000]  It always seems like it's impossible to defeat until humanity realizes
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.000]  that there's no choice left but to stand up and say no.
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.000]  We've certainly reached that point now.
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  Well, we have Marjorie Taylor Green, about to get her to the studio,
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  and she's going to be joining us coming up in the second hour in studio this evening.
[01:21.000 --> 01:22.000]  We really look forward to that.
[01:22.000 --> 01:23.000]  She has a lot of courage.
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  She's an example of what we need more of in Congress to say it lightly,
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  to put it lightly.
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  We have that and a lot of big issues.
[01:31.000 --> 01:39.000]  We're going to be covering with her in studio here in Austin, Texas, tonight.
[01:39.000 --> 01:46.000]  But obviously, front and center, there are a lot of conflicting reports
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.000]  about what's happening in Eastern Europe, Northeastern Europe.
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  And what's really about to unfold in Ukraine where there's been an eight-year proxy war
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  between the globalists and the Russians.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  Here's just some of the headlines.
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  Russia plans biggest war since 1945, says the British globalist prime minister
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  who I wouldn't believe a damn word comes out of his mouth,
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  but who knows, it might be true.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  Russian troops receive orders to proceed with invasion.
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  The US intelligence shows the same US intelligence that says I'm a Russian agent.
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  That's the Daily Mail.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  But what we do have is video coming out of areas of Russia itself
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  showing Russian armored tanks painted with the letter Z, which would normally be part of a drill,
[02:35.000 --> 02:43.000]  moving towards Ukraine border in huge convoys.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  So we're going to find out very, very quickly what's really going on.
[02:47.000 --> 02:54.000]  Putin and Macron are meeting right now in an emergency face-to-face meeting, we're told,
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  to halt, quote, escalation.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  Putin says they're shipping more weapons than they're launching artillery attacks
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  into Eastern Ukraine, Russian-held areas.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  Well, we know that's been going on for eight years.
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  So there's an escalation by both sides.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  And the Russians, again, have been beefing up their troops in the area
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  because the West has been beefing up troops in the area.
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  And George Soros brags, you're with Russia.
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.000]  We are in Russia's backyard.
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  We can't even control our border.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  The globalists have gotten rid of it.
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  Thousands of people die over a few days of fentanyl, many of them children.
[03:26.000 --> 03:27.000]  But that's not a crisis.
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.000]  That's not a problem.
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.000]  That's ordered open.
[03:29.000 --> 03:40.000]  But, oh, backing certain groups in Ukraine who are Russophobes
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  is what we're supposedly all supposed to back right now
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  so we can help the globalists bring in George Soros' style
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  brainwashing of the youth, which is going on now,
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  in Western-controlled areas of Ukraine.
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  So I believe in the Monroe Doctrine.
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  I know America's been an empire since the Spanish-American War
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  and the blowing up of the main.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.000]  False flag that triggered that.
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  The anniversary was just last week.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  But I am not a Russophile at the same time.
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  I do not lionize all of Russia's activities or behaviors.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  But you'd be a fool to believe that this is about America spreading
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  freedom into areas of the world.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  This is about the globalists taking over and are so powerful now.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  They're not just waging war against individuals and families
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  and our savings and our currencies and our borders and our very existence.
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  They're waging war against other countries and other systems.
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  They believe they can push around.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  And that's how big war start.
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  And Russia is a nuclear power.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  We've also got a pretty powerful video of Chuck Todd
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  as Secretary of State Blinken, why Putin didn't escalate
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  during the Trump administration, and he is speechless.
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  That clip's coming up as well.
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.000]  But we've got some really good news when we come back in T-minus 60 seconds.
[04:54.000 --> 04:55.000]  We're live.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  At least tell folks we are.
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000]  Two life-changing, life-empowering products
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  are now back in stock after being sold out for months
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  Winter Sun is the highest quality, organic vitamin D3.
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.000]  Taken under the tongue, it also has vitamin K.
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  Critical fear immune system and so much more.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  It's 50% off despite the fact it's going to sell out very, very quickly
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  because everybody needs this old, young, black, white.
[05:26.000 --> 05:27.000]  It doesn't matter.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  You need what's in Winter Sun.
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  And then we have Brain Force Ultra.
[05:31.000 --> 05:36.000]  Super fast-acting, amazing, clean, neutropic system
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  that is a complement to Brain Force Plus
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  and, of course, Turbo Force.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  All three of these are different formulas,
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  but all three of them take your mind
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  and take your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time.
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  If you haven't tried these products, you really need to
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.000]  because they are amazing.
[05:58.000 --> 06:01.000]  They are at infowarstore.com.
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  Welcome and thank you so much
[06:27.000 --> 06:34.000]  for joining us on this live February 20th Sunday broadcast.
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[06:36.000 --> 06:39.000]  Myself, Alex Jones, Marjorie Taylor Greene,
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.000]  great member of Congress,
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  probably one of the best members of Congress.
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  She's definitely up there in the top two or three.
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  Amazing courage, amazing understanding of what we face,
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  more of what we need in Congress, no doubt.
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  And Owen Schreuer, my great co-host, and so much more.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
[06:56.000 --> 07:03.000]  here we are on the verge of a massively expanded war with Russia.
[07:03.000 --> 07:07.000]  And when Chuck Todd asked Secretary of State Blinken today
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  on one of the Sunday news shows
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  why Putin didn't escalate during the Trump administration,
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  well, we know the reason that that happened.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  And I'll be talking about that coming up at the start of the next segment.
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  We'll have that video clip for you.
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  We're going to be getting to all of that.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  The answer is Trump did not ship $5 billion of anti-tank
[07:30.000 --> 07:35.000]  and anti-aircraft missiles and give it to not just the Ukrainian military,
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  but to the, quote, anti-Russian militia
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  that's been attacking for seven-plus years
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  eastern border of Ukraine with Russia.
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.000]  So, yeah, when they tell you there's a war going on,
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  yeah, it's been going on eight years,
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  and the Russians and others are sick of it.
[07:51.000 --> 07:57.000]  And if you look at the polls, they're 50-50, whether they're pro-Russia, pro-West.
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  The point is it's not our fight.
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  It's not on our doorstep.
[08:01.000 --> 08:02.000]  Our own borders wide open.
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  Our country's collapsing.
[08:04.000 --> 08:10.000]  And this didn't happen under Trump because Trump didn't push the boundaries of NATO.
[08:10.000 --> 08:11.000]  There's been five pushes.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  This is the fifth push.
[08:13.000 --> 08:16.000]  And Russia has said this far no further, we have nuclear weapons.
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  So it's not about picking a side here.
[08:18.000 --> 08:25.000]  It's about being a pragmatist and realizing what indeed is going on.
[08:25.000 --> 08:33.000]  We'll be covering that coming up, as I said, for you next segment.
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  I don't know if I can do justice to this today,
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  but who knows what huge news we're ranking tomorrow.
[08:39.000 --> 08:49.000]  So I'm going to try my best here this evening just to talk about something so massively huge
[08:49.000 --> 09:01.000]  and so incredibly positive.
[09:01.000 --> 09:08.000]  But I don't know if this Sunday show is the place to do this.
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  I just don't know with the time we have whether we're able to do that or not.
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  But I'm going to do my best and I'm going to go ahead and just start getting to this right now
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  because it really is on a epiphany moment.
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  It's a Perry Mason moment where the sunglasses are on like they live
[09:34.000 --> 09:41.000]  and suddenly you can see what's really going on and what's unfolding.
[09:41.000 --> 09:53.000]  But I've been trying my best for a long, long time to get people to care about corporate capture, elite capture.
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.000]  Now these are well-known terms to intelligence agencies and to national police forces
[09:59.000 --> 10:04.000]  and to the Justice Department and to PhD historians and others,
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  but it's something they don't want the public to have any understanding about
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  because in a republic and in a populist system,
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.000]  we're supposed to have the public in charge of corporate and elite capture.
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.000]  And it's supposed to be done where the whole world sees what's unfolding
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  and the whole world sees what's happening
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  and we're aware of what these corrupt forces are doing
[10:35.000 --> 10:41.000]  so we're able to come in because we're aware of that and block them and stop them.
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  But if we don't know what's going on and if we've been kept in the dark
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  and told by the New York Times and CNN for decades that there is no global conspiracy,
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.000]  there is no Bilderberg group, there is no secret group, there is no plan for world government,
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.000]  there is no plan for world ID, there is no plan to take children from their parents,
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.000]  there is no plan to sexualize your children, there is no plan for forced inoculations,
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  then we can't ever form the political opposition to it
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  because the system won't even allow a discussion or a debate about it.
[11:16.000 --> 11:24.000]  Well, yesterday, they had a member of parliament try to bring up Klaus Schwab
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.000]  and the globalist takeover and the Great Reset and how more than half the cabinet of Canada
[11:29.000 --> 11:35.000]  is openly controlled by him and he brags that he runs it.
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.000]  And when the member of parliament tried to bring it up, they cut his mic and told him he couldn't speak
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  and then they had the socialist leaders say that's fake news, that's not allowed
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  and they shut down the member of parliament.
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  That's how hardcore the martial law is in Canada that like North Korea
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  when they have one of their staged Politburo meetings,
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  if somebody gets up and criticizes Kim Jong-un, they disappear.
[12:02.000 --> 12:09.000]  Well, now that's happening in Canada and if you go on Instagram or Twitter or anywhere,
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  I spent hours last night today looking at it, it's incredible.
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  I had more than 20 clips here and that's just a bare minimum.
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  That's why I said I don't know about time to get to it all.
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  It's unbelievable.
[12:19.000 --> 12:26.000]  The whole world's waking up including premiers, governors of major provinces of Canada are saying,
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  look, foreign banks threw the UN and Klaus Schwab took over and there's been a UN coup
[12:32.000 --> 12:38.000]  and then people go to the local airport and there's just UN aircraft everywhere
[12:38.000 --> 12:44.000]  and yeah, jets, big passenger jets landing with UN troops with the UN on the side
[12:44.000 --> 12:50.000]  and so Canada's really waking up that it was seen as soft, compliant and weak, which it wasn't.
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  It was just confident and happy and working hard
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  and it's been targeted by corporate, global government takeover, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  Now, since they showed this at night, it gets worse during the day.
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  This is all these jets, big jets with UN on them.
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.000]  They've now blacked out the UN tags and it looks like put black paint over it.
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is just, this is next level.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  I mean, we have lived to see the attempted world government takeover
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  and it's collapsing in Australia, it's collapsing in New Zealand, it's collapsing in Europe, it's collapsing here.
[13:27.000 --> 13:35.000]  They already had to back off force inoculation in Austria, Hitler's home
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  because their own police and military said we're about to overthrow the government
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  and the public got more aggressive once they tried that.
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  So this is all Klaus Schwab and the New World Order trying their takeover.
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.000]  So I'll tell you what I'll do.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  I'm going to have MGT in here in the second hour.
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  I'm going to go right through this hour and I'm going to hit the big Russian news in the last segment of this hour.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  But when I come back for the next two segments,
[13:59.000 --> 14:05.000]  I'm going to play you the most astonishing, amazing stuff we've ever played here.
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.000]  Most of this is new, a lot of it's old, but I want to show you what's happening
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.000]  and them in live time shutting down members of parliament who bring up,
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  hey, Klaus Schwab brags, he controls Trudeau.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  Not true, sorry, can't talk or shut down.
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]  That's fake news.
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.000]  So it's not just fake news that shut Alex Jones down when he tells you something that's true.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  Now it's live time having to shut up the members of parliament.
[14:29.000 --> 14:30.000]  Now you've got to shut up Joe Rogan.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  Now you've got to shut up Tucker Carlson.
[14:32.000 --> 14:39.000]  Now like major famous Muslims are coming out against the great reset in the New World Order.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  So Hollywood people are coming out against it.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  Folks get this is bad.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  Folks get this is evil and they've decided to reject this poison.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  Evil is always trying to force feed you poison.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  All you got to do is throw it up.
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  See, that doesn't sit too well.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  You know, I think I'm going to, yeah, you know, you kind of make the decision to go ahead and eat something bad.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  You know, I think that might have been bad fish.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  That might have been, I think I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  Well, I'll only do it every once a year or so, but I'll eat something that doesn't sit well.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  And other people get food poisoning.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  I go out to dinner with this happened before.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  Not this guy.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  I'm the opposite of believe it.
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  I love food.
[15:15.000 --> 15:20.000]  But once a year or so, I'll eat something and it doesn't sit well.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  And it makes me something ate at a gas station or something.
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  And I just go vomit that out.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  And we just got to say, hey, you know what Klaus Schwab?
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  You know what Bill Gates?
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  You know what New World Order?
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  You know what Ted Turner and all you world government people were?
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  You force fed us all this, but we reject it.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  What did God say in the Bible?
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  You were hot nor cold.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  So I spit you out of my mouth.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  You were lukewarm.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  I spit you out of my mouth.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  You got to spit them out of our mouth.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  Well, they're right back.
[15:53.000 --> 16:22.000]  This is big news.

[16:28.000 --> 16:34.000]  new tropic system that is a compliment to brain force plus and of course

[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  Thanks for joining us.
[17:27.000 --> 17:34.000]  This is nothing more than a top down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  Because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left,
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win.
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.000]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[17:45.000 --> 17:46.000]  Now we know.
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  Two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[17:49.000 --> 17:50.000]  It's that simple.
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  They can't maybe because of our free speech and our guns.
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.600]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest of the history.
[17:57.600 --> 17:59.840]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[17:59.840 --> 18:02.680]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[18:02.680 --> 18:07.040]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[18:07.040 --> 18:12.960]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[18:12.960 --> 18:16.640]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[18:16.640 --> 18:21.600]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[18:21.600 --> 18:25.800]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[18:25.800 --> 18:29.400]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.

[19:20.200 --> 19:22.440]  I'm so glad you called elaborate on this.
[19:22.440 --> 19:23.440]  Yes.
[19:23.440 --> 19:26.880]  Now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom
[19:26.880 --> 19:32.640]  wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain
[19:32.640 --> 19:33.640]  reaction.
[19:33.640 --> 19:35.600]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[19:35.600 --> 19:36.600]  I have a few ideas.
[19:36.600 --> 19:41.920]  First of all, out there is a poison form, a rest out, rest while swab, the vaccine is
[19:41.920 --> 19:42.920]  poison.
[19:42.920 --> 19:43.920]  There's tons of things.
[19:43.920 --> 19:44.920]  I say just keep it short, keep it concise.
[19:44.920 --> 19:45.920]  Don't agree.
[19:45.920 --> 19:49.680]  A rest vouchy, a rest bill gates, the COVID-19 vaccine is poison, beautiful.
[19:49.680 --> 19:50.680]  Yeah.
[19:50.680 --> 19:53.280]  There's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be affected, so that's what
[19:53.280 --> 19:54.280]  I'm calling about.
[19:54.280 --> 19:55.280]  God bless you, Chris.
[19:55.280 --> 19:58.440]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[19:58.440 --> 20:00.760]  Thank you so much.
[20:00.760 --> 20:29.840] 道歉.
[20:30.760 --> 20:37.320]  Or all the other fights and the police actions and things the different countries have been
[20:37.320 --> 20:38.320]  in.
[20:38.320 --> 20:43.880]  We think about an enemy with military trying to take over the infrastructure of the other
[20:43.880 --> 20:47.880]  group and have the people surrender.
[20:47.880 --> 20:51.080]  But you don't invade a country that is going to fight back.
[20:51.080 --> 20:52.720]  You don't invade a country that won't submit.
[20:52.720 --> 20:58.200]  You invade people that are known to be soft and passive and easily scared into control.
[20:58.200 --> 20:59.580]  So you build a virus.
[20:59.580 --> 21:00.580]  You release it.
[21:00.580 --> 21:01.800]  You create incredible fear.
[21:01.800 --> 21:02.800]  You block treatments.
[21:02.800 --> 21:07.160]  You then inject people with more poison to make them sick.
[21:07.160 --> 21:09.680]  So they're scared and under your control.
[21:09.680 --> 21:14.400]  And we've got Klaus Schwab, who's the former head of the Bilderberg group, big globalist
[21:14.400 --> 21:20.920]  secret power group that I've exposed and others have.
[21:20.920 --> 21:29.120]  And you've got them creating the Debo's group in the 70s under Henry Kissinger's direction.
[21:29.120 --> 21:34.200]  He worked directly for Kissinger, went to Harvard, trained by Kissinger, all of it.
[21:34.200 --> 21:42.240]  And then by the 90s, they've gotten thousands of leaders, mainly the children of rich people,
[21:42.240 --> 21:47.120]  billionaires, like Bill Gates and others.
[21:47.120 --> 21:54.160]  And almost all the prime ministers and presidents you see now, trained by them in global governance.
[21:54.160 --> 21:56.880]  And then he writes four books on the subject.
[21:56.880 --> 21:57.880]  He gives speeches.
[21:57.880 --> 22:03.320]  He goes all over television and brags that we've penetrated governments and we control
[22:03.320 --> 22:04.320]  governments.
[22:04.320 --> 22:10.440]  And if you go to his Wikipedia page, it has a quote, him saying, we capture your democracies.
[22:10.440 --> 22:14.720]  The people do not need to be in charge.
[22:14.720 --> 22:19.240]  So he's another crazy German that thinks he should rule the world.
[22:19.240 --> 22:22.600]  And he works with a bunch of other evil groups doing it.
[22:22.600 --> 22:26.160]  But what's important is I've been harping on this group and making films about it for
[22:26.160 --> 22:29.720]  decades and warning you they were going to use the virus for control.
[22:29.720 --> 22:38.320]  But now it's everywhere from Joe Rogan's latest podcast to Tucker Carlson to everywhere and
[22:38.320 --> 22:45.600]  exploded online, people waking up and actually going and looking at who is in their parliament
[22:45.600 --> 22:50.480]  and who is in the cabinet of the government and who are their presidents and prime ministers.
[22:50.480 --> 22:54.880]  And they're finding out almost all of them, whether it's Latin America or the Middle East
[22:54.880 --> 23:03.320]  or Africa or Europe or Canada is them.
[23:03.320 --> 23:09.320]  And now you've got Eastern European leaders and the Mexican president that's a liberal
[23:09.320 --> 23:18.040]  and conservative leaders, Bolsonaro, all saying this is a corporate coup, a scientific takeover
[23:18.040 --> 23:19.360]  of the planet.
[23:19.360 --> 23:25.000]  That is a magic moment, ladies and gentlemen, where people finally get it.
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.600]  So I've got more than 20 of these clips and I'll probably make a documentary on this the
[23:28.600 --> 23:31.760]  next few weeks, a quick film, because people are really ready for this right now.
[23:31.760 --> 23:33.000]  And the Zeitgeist is here.
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.080]  I'm also trying to write a book on this subject, we're working on it right now.
[23:36.080 --> 23:38.160]  But this is just so huge.
[23:38.160 --> 23:43.320]  Here is a major conservative member of parliament censored for pointing out the World Economic
[23:43.320 --> 23:47.040]  Forum, the Debo's groups corrupt influence over Trudeau's government.
[23:47.040 --> 23:50.640]  When this first broke on Friday, people thought it was fake.
[23:50.640 --> 23:53.240]  They went and found the HD and off the government channel.
[23:53.240 --> 23:54.240]  It's real.
[23:54.240 --> 23:58.240]  But notice first they say, oh, your feed's bad.
[23:58.240 --> 23:59.240]  We can't hear you.
[23:59.240 --> 24:00.240]  It was true.
[24:00.240 --> 24:05.160]  Then the socialist leader, who's there in person, minding it all, pops in and says, it's
[24:05.160 --> 24:06.560]  not true.
[24:06.560 --> 24:13.600]  It's disinformation that Klaus Schwab brags he runs Trudeau, even though I have five clips
[24:13.600 --> 24:17.200]  of him saying exactly that, and we're going to get to him.
[24:17.200 --> 24:22.720]  So this is really captured people's imagination, and they're finally getting it.
[24:22.720 --> 24:27.360]  So they don't even want members of parliament in a country captured by these people to do
[24:27.360 --> 24:28.360]  it.
[24:28.360 --> 24:31.240]  And the finance minister declared financial martial law, said they'll take your bank
[24:31.240 --> 24:33.160]  accounts and track what you do without a warrant.
[24:33.160 --> 24:36.280]  She announced yesterday at a press conference, it's permanent.
[24:36.280 --> 24:38.320]  She said, we're permanently doing this.
[24:38.320 --> 24:45.760]  And then another top liberal, they call him a labor member, said, oh, being a Trump supporter,
[24:45.760 --> 24:47.280]  we're going to take your bank account.
[24:47.280 --> 24:52.480]  And even people on mainstream TV are like, that's crazy.
[24:52.480 --> 25:00.120]  And then the graduate of Klaus Schwab's system, his cult, his intelligence agency, his private
[25:00.120 --> 25:05.120]  intelligence agency of New Zealand, they've got tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands
[25:05.120 --> 25:09.960]  protesting there peacefully, and she says they're terrorists and that free speech isn't
[25:09.960 --> 25:10.960]  allowed.
[25:10.960 --> 25:14.320]  And even the police tell her what she's doing is wrong.
[25:14.320 --> 25:18.960]  So they're all following orders of the corporations that think they can put puppets in charge of
[25:18.960 --> 25:24.400]  governments and have them lock us in our houses, forcibly inject us, tell us we're nonessential,
[25:24.400 --> 25:29.120]  starve us, shut down our businesses, and that we're not smart enough to organize and figure
[25:29.120 --> 25:32.320]  out what they're doing.
[25:32.320 --> 25:36.600]  But whether it's Trudeau of Canada, or whether it's the puppet of New Zealand, or whether
[25:36.600 --> 25:42.360]  it's any of these puppets, they all have one thing in common as a governor in Canada came
[25:42.360 --> 25:46.400]  out and set up a premier, is they're all very weak-minded and very stupid.
[25:46.400 --> 25:50.560]  And that's true, because these are the quizlings.
[25:50.560 --> 25:52.280]  These are the useful idiots.
[25:52.280 --> 25:56.360]  These are the people inside your fortress that lower the drawbridge for the enemy to take
[25:56.360 --> 25:57.360]  over.
[25:57.360 --> 25:58.920]  And what does the enemy always do when they take over?
[25:58.920 --> 26:07.240]  They put to the sword the idiots that open the gate.
[26:07.240 --> 26:08.240]  Here it is.
[26:08.240 --> 26:14.400]  Canada, a member of parliament, censored and censored for pointing out W.E.F.'s corrupt
[26:14.400 --> 26:15.400]  influence.
[26:15.400 --> 26:16.400]  Here it is.
[26:16.400 --> 26:20.480]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[26:20.480 --> 26:23.000]  And I listened to my colleague's speech.
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.160]  I had a constituent that wanted me to ask a question about outside interference to our
[26:29.160 --> 26:30.160]  democracy.
[26:30.160 --> 26:34.960]  Klaus Schwab is the head of the World Economic Forum, and he bragged how his subversive W.E.F.
[26:34.960 --> 26:39.240]  World Economic Forum has quoted infiltrated governments around the world.
[26:39.240 --> 26:44.080]  He said that his organization had penetrated more than half of Canada's cabinet.
[26:44.080 --> 26:50.680]  And I was wondering, in the interest of transparency, could the member please name which cabinet
[26:50.680 --> 26:54.400]  ministers are on board with the W.E.F.'s agenda?
[26:54.400 --> 26:57.280]  My concern is the deput— Order, order, order.
[26:57.280 --> 27:04.400]  I know the member was in a really good question there, but the audio is really, really bad
[27:04.400 --> 27:07.360]  and the video is really, really bad as well.
[27:07.360 --> 27:08.360]  And I apologize.
[27:08.360 --> 27:12.760]  I don't know if the member— Okay, let's try again.
[27:12.760 --> 27:17.560]  The honorable member for Timbs James Bay.
[27:17.560 --> 27:18.760]  Mr. Speaker.
[27:18.760 --> 27:22.000]  My member is promoting open disinformation.
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  That's not debate.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  We have to call up disinformation.
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.480]  I'm going to get into debate again.
[27:26.480 --> 27:32.520]  So, oh, I forgot it's worse than I've said.
[27:32.520 --> 27:36.760]  Trudeau suspended the government and the elected representatives when he declared that a martial
[27:36.760 --> 27:43.120]  law a week ago, and then they told all the other members of parliament, don't be there,
[27:43.120 --> 27:47.200]  you can't be there, but then they opened it up for the left to be there.
[27:47.200 --> 27:50.200]  Everything's a deception, everything's a test, everything's a see what they can get
[27:50.200 --> 27:56.520]  away with, and so the conservatives and others, they're digital coming in via Zoom or whatever
[27:56.520 --> 28:00.800]  system they use, but the left's there to honcho and run it all.
[28:00.800 --> 28:05.280]  Now, this totally has freaked out the people of Canada.
[28:05.280 --> 28:10.920]  It's got tens of millions of views, the different versions of it, and Canada's only 32 million
[28:10.920 --> 28:13.400]  people or so.
[28:13.400 --> 28:18.880]  So again, once you identify the shadow government, once you identify it's a foreign outside group,
[28:18.880 --> 28:23.320]  once you identify that it wants to collapse you to then get you on welfare with a universal
[28:23.320 --> 28:28.600]  basic income to control you, once you know that it's game over, baby, and it's happening
[28:28.600 --> 28:31.600]  everywhere, very positive time.
[28:31.600 --> 28:34.680]  Of course, I have a clip of Klaus Schwab talking about it.
[28:34.680 --> 28:40.160]  Their answer is to launch a cyber attack and to basically cut the power off and bring in
[28:40.160 --> 28:43.560]  total complete control using that, and wars.
[28:43.560 --> 28:46.600]  Of course, I didn't just tell you that today, I told you that months and months ago, but
[28:46.600 --> 28:51.320]  I have the clip of Klaus Schwab saying the power outage, the cyber attack will make
[28:51.320 --> 29:00.000]  COVID look like a wonderful thing, and he smiles because he knows.
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.120]  I've been on air more than 25 years, and long before I started selling high quality
[29:05.120 --> 29:13.040]  vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3, because it is essential.
[29:13.040 --> 29:17.960]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic,
[29:17.960 --> 29:22.960]  it doesn't matter, your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that
[29:22.960 --> 29:23.960]  are out there.
[29:23.960 --> 29:28.000]  It's just like you need oxygen, you die in four minutes without oxygen, you die in five
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  or six days without water, you die in a month without food.
[29:31.000 --> 29:36.080]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that
[29:36.080 --> 29:40.120]  you need, and one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health
[29:40.120 --> 29:41.120]  is vitamin D3.

[31:07.680 --> 31:13.640]  From the words of Chuck Paulinique's Fight Club, dear globalist leaders of the great
[31:13.640 --> 31:19.160]  reset, the people you're trying to step on, we're everyone you depend on, we're the people
[31:19.160 --> 31:24.320]  who do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner, we make your bed, we guard
[31:24.320 --> 31:29.880]  you while you're asleep, we drive the ambulances, we direct your call, we are cooks and we are
[31:29.880 --> 31:35.360]  taxi drivers and we know everything about you, we process your insurance claims and credit
[31:35.360 --> 31:41.200]  card charges, we control every part of your life, we are the middle children of history,
[31:41.200 --> 31:46.800]  raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars, but
[31:46.800 --> 31:53.880]  we won't, and we're just learning this fact, so don't f**k with us.
[31:53.880 --> 32:06.280]  So I did it, I signed up for the Austin Marathon, I've been training, probably not as much
[32:06.280 --> 32:10.840]  as I should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[32:10.840 --> 32:16.800]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need
[32:16.800 --> 32:21.720]  to get going, you know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins
[32:21.720 --> 32:26.960]  I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids
[32:26.960 --> 32:31.120]  for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[32:31.120 --> 32:37.320]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis, I have bad joints, thanks mom, so
[32:37.320 --> 32:41.720]  this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation
[32:41.720 --> 32:44.120]  support and extra flexibility.
[32:44.120 --> 32:48.680]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[32:48.680 --> 32:53.360]  And if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, turbo force that can
[32:53.360 --> 32:57.440]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and Sorilis can keep you
[32:57.440 --> 33:00.880]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[33:00.880 --> 33:28.760]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:28.760 --> 33:43.400]  Well, I'm really proud of humanity and I'll just tell you a point blank, I'm doing this
[33:43.400 --> 33:47.440]  because I want to survive, I want to live, I want to have a future, I know God's real,
[33:47.440 --> 33:49.640]  I want to stand up against evil.
[33:49.640 --> 33:55.120]  And so every victory we have, I just see that as my mission and what we're supposed to do,
[33:55.120 --> 34:00.600]  but I am really proud of all of you because I know this audience of activists is at the
[34:00.600 --> 34:08.200]  very core of the fight and I don't have words to describe how amazing you are and really
[34:08.200 --> 34:14.400]  makes me proud of this crew and everything we've done together that we're going to really
[34:14.400 --> 34:19.000]  get attacked hard because the enemy knows we're the detonation point of this thing,
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.400]  but Info War, standing on the shoulders of great patriots that came before us, has been
[34:23.400 --> 34:26.480]  the tip of the spear.
[34:26.480 --> 34:31.080]  And we've got a real fighting chance against these people now and humanity's really waking
[34:31.080 --> 34:35.480]  up and fighting back because of you and your support of this broadcast in your word of
[34:35.480 --> 34:38.080]  mouth and your prayer and what you did.
[34:38.080 --> 34:40.720]  This is real world stuff and you did it.
[34:40.720 --> 34:45.960]  Yeah, God's in charge, but God works through you and if you don't take action, well, then
[34:45.960 --> 34:50.680]  the dog doesn't hunt and I'm here to tell you folks, this dog wants to hunt, but I can't
[34:50.680 --> 34:53.880]  hunt without you and together we're doing it.
[34:53.880 --> 34:54.880]  This is real.
[34:54.880 --> 34:56.040]  This ain't Hollywood crap.
[34:56.040 --> 34:58.680]  This isn't all the fake New World Order BS in the world.
[34:58.680 --> 35:02.520]  This is real and this is happening.
[35:02.520 --> 35:07.400]  Maximum Red Alert, Saturday emergency broadcast, Western leaders claim war with Russia has already
[35:07.400 --> 35:08.400]  begun.
[35:08.400 --> 35:16.440]  MTG, Marjorie Taylor Greene live in studio coming up next hour.
[35:16.440 --> 35:21.080]  So let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen, with the biggest news and again, I'm going
[35:21.080 --> 35:25.600]  to have to make like an hour long quick, fast mini documentary on this or something because
[35:25.600 --> 35:28.120]  the wheels are coming off the New World Order right now.
[35:28.120 --> 35:29.120]  All the best.
[35:29.120 --> 35:35.600]  I say all at the top 20 best selling books last year, all about the great reset.
[35:35.600 --> 35:37.080]  People get it now.
[35:37.080 --> 35:39.240]  It's good news.
[35:39.240 --> 35:41.760]  And so this is very exciting.
[35:41.760 --> 35:47.840]  I just pledged to the member of parliament being censored for saying that Trudeau pledges
[35:47.840 --> 35:50.960]  allegiance to the great reset.
[35:50.960 --> 35:53.480]  Let's just start with clip 13.
[35:53.480 --> 35:59.720]  Here's Klaus Schwab two years ago saying, use COVID to create an angrier world.
[35:59.720 --> 36:04.840]  They want to solve angry and killing each other when the resources are cut off and people
[36:04.840 --> 36:08.360]  don't go to work and the infrastructure collapses because that's how stuff works.
[36:08.360 --> 36:13.160]  You may not think your job is very important, but especially if you're a farmer or an engineer
[36:13.160 --> 36:17.720]  or a power plant worker or a guy that puts power lines up or a school teacher.
[36:17.720 --> 36:21.680]  I mean, everything has an effect.
[36:21.680 --> 36:25.600]  And if they don't go to work, stuff starts breaking down and people starve to death in
[36:25.600 --> 36:28.680]  the third world and then we collapse and we starve to death.
[36:28.680 --> 36:33.160]  And that's what Schwab brags about how great it is and how they're cutting the carbon footprint
[36:33.160 --> 36:34.160]  and giggling.
[36:34.160 --> 36:35.160]  He's a murdering depopulationist.
[36:35.160 --> 36:38.840]  Sorry, let's get the clips.
[36:38.840 --> 36:42.960]  So he's telling you what the angrier world is coming, but he doesn't think he'll get
[36:42.960 --> 36:43.960]  the blame.
[36:43.960 --> 36:47.960]  See, he'll keep doing this with his corporate controllers until he gets the blame.
[36:47.960 --> 36:50.960]  The minute he doesn't think he'll get away with it, they're going to stop.
[36:50.960 --> 36:56.840]  So I've been like, attack the establishment politically, expose them, emergency, emergency.
[36:56.840 --> 37:03.240]  Everything we do is on this and now finally, finally people get it and it's amazing.
[37:03.240 --> 37:08.720]  So God is good, my friends, God is real and God is in control.
[37:08.720 --> 37:11.840]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip of this demon.
[37:11.840 --> 37:17.320]  He's the front man, but he's the head demon with the devils above him, giving him the
[37:17.320 --> 37:21.280]  orders and here he is admitting his plan.
[37:21.280 --> 37:28.040]  I don't know how it will play out in November, but what we know is that we will end up with
[37:28.040 --> 37:34.880]  as many more unemployed and particularly also people in the gray economy, which are not
[37:34.880 --> 37:37.680]  counted for who lose their jobs.
[37:37.680 --> 37:45.840]  So we will see definitely a lot of anger already now, but probably increased by the end of
[37:45.840 --> 37:53.400]  the year because this crisis will be with us until we really have found remedy.
[37:53.400 --> 37:58.560]  Okay, so his whole plan, he writes books, we're going to crash economy.
[37:58.560 --> 38:03.360]  They order the lockdowns to make you poor and collapse and then offer you a new utopia
[38:03.360 --> 38:07.920]  with a digital ID and universal income that he controls.
[38:07.920 --> 38:12.320]  So here he is last year talking about a cyber attack and getting very excited.
[38:12.320 --> 38:15.520]  How you think COVID was a bad lockdown, which he said was a good, he said was good for the
[38:15.520 --> 38:16.520]  earth.
[38:16.520 --> 38:18.920]  Well, wait till the cyber attack turns your lights out.
[38:18.920 --> 38:21.080]  Here it is.
[38:21.080 --> 38:29.960]  But still pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber
[38:29.960 --> 38:39.560]  attack, which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital
[38:39.560 --> 38:43.320]  services, our society as a whole.
[38:43.320 --> 38:53.240]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison
[38:53.240 --> 39:04.040]  to a major cyber attack, to use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity to reflect
[39:04.040 --> 39:13.160]  on the lessons the cybersecurity community can draw and improve our preparedness for
[39:13.160 --> 39:16.720]  a potential cyber pandemic.
[39:16.720 --> 39:18.680]  So they're the saviors when they launch it.
[39:18.680 --> 39:19.680]  They're prepared.
[39:19.680 --> 39:20.680]  You're not.
[39:20.680 --> 39:21.680]  They consolidate total control.
[39:21.680 --> 39:28.440]  The top 100 billionaires double their money during this operation that they triggered.
[39:28.440 --> 39:30.320]  And there he is admitting it all.
[39:30.320 --> 39:32.060]  He wants a post-industrial world.
[39:32.060 --> 39:36.920]  He pushed longer lockdowns, and when they collapse society, he poses as your savior.
[39:36.920 --> 39:42.600]  Here he is on Charlie Rose talking about during the great reset, during the cyber takeover,
[39:42.600 --> 39:47.760]  during the fourth industrial revolution, we change your genetics, not the earth.
[39:47.760 --> 39:48.760]  Here it is.
[39:48.760 --> 39:50.600]  For medical science.
[39:50.600 --> 39:56.480]  And you see, the difference of this fourth industrial revolution is it doesn't change
[39:56.480 --> 39:58.040]  what you are doing.
[39:58.040 --> 40:02.600]  It changes you if you take genetic editing.
[40:02.600 --> 40:06.280]  Just as an example, it's you who are changed.
[40:06.280 --> 40:09.720]  And of course it has a big impact on your identity.
[40:09.720 --> 40:15.360]  And offers certain kinds of possibilities that have to be careful about, you know, when
[40:15.360 --> 40:20.680]  you begin to do that kind of gene editing, some people worry that you are changing what
[40:20.680 --> 40:22.760]  it means to be human.
[40:22.760 --> 40:25.600]  That's the problem.
[40:25.600 --> 40:32.760]  Of course, it's a new industrial revolution, offers us many opportunities, but it raises
[40:32.760 --> 40:34.440]  many fold questions.
[40:34.440 --> 40:38.000]  Now you know what they did to you.
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.920]  You know, I'm going to play clip eight, Alberta Premier Jason Kinney talks about the great
[40:43.920 --> 40:48.560]  reset as the best job boiling it down in a very conservative way in four and a half minutes.
[40:48.560 --> 40:50.320]  That's coming up.
[40:50.320 --> 40:55.920]  Let's go to clip five.
[40:55.920 --> 41:00.560]  She's on the board of the World Economic Forum, the Davos Group.
[41:00.560 --> 41:01.880]  She works directly for Klaus Schwab.
[41:01.880 --> 41:05.960]  She's written books about world government and depopulation.
[41:05.960 --> 41:11.560]  Her grandfather was the number two under Joseph Goebbels, can't make that up, had propagandist
[41:11.560 --> 41:15.680]  in Eastern Europe when the Nazis occupied it.
[41:15.680 --> 41:21.360]  And Christia Freeland, who is the economic minister over Canada, the deputy prime minister,
[41:21.360 --> 41:25.080]  she declared martial law last week, no due process, take your bank accounts.
[41:25.080 --> 41:26.720]  Now they say it's permanent.
[41:26.720 --> 41:32.160]  And then she mentions a economic system, Schwab is announced with the UN, a global system
[41:32.160 --> 41:35.080]  that will cashless society track what you do.
[41:35.080 --> 41:38.000]  Here's part of it.
[41:38.000 --> 41:48.240]  In terms of the financial instruments, which our government is using right now to act against
[41:48.240 --> 41:53.400]  these illegal blockades and illegal occupation, you know, a hip hop stop.
[41:53.400 --> 41:55.760]  This is a two minute clip and I went to it about 30 seconds late.
[41:55.760 --> 41:58.440]  I'm going to come back with that.
[41:58.440 --> 42:02.480]  But when she says illegal blockades, they're blockading and saying, if you don't take shots,
[42:02.480 --> 42:03.480]  you can't have a job.
[42:03.480 --> 42:05.640]  They're saying you got to have five, six, seven, eight shots.
[42:05.640 --> 42:09.920]  Trudeau's bought the shots out many years saying this is the new normal.
[42:09.920 --> 42:10.920]  They're blockading us.
[42:10.920 --> 42:12.320]  They're putting us under siege.
[42:12.320 --> 42:13.320]  They're controlling us.
[42:13.320 --> 42:15.000]  They're telling us we're not essential.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  They admit it's their fourth industrial revolution to take over our bodies.
[42:19.000 --> 42:25.880]  I have C-SPAN interviews with Bill Gates and Fauci saying, oh, we need a virus out of China
[42:25.880 --> 42:31.000]  to blow up the FDA regulatory system so we can get instant authorization of this to have
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  our revolution.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.720]  When I come back, I'm going to play the clip of her saying we need this to be permanent.
[42:36.720 --> 42:41.880]  Everyone watched in live time and then the other minister says, yeah, anybody, yeah,
[42:41.880 --> 42:49.240]  there she is, anybody that supports Trump will have his bank accounts taken.
[42:49.240 --> 43:05.320]  I have the deputy minister saying that to life changing, life empowering products are
[43:05.320 --> 43:10.880]  now back in stock after being sold out for months and infowarstore.com.
[43:10.880 --> 43:14.760]  Winters son is the highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue.

[43:44.520 --> 43:47.640]  your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.
[43:47.640 --> 43:52.640]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time.

[44:13.800 --> 44:20.920]  We see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation, great reset combine, trying to
[44:20.920 --> 44:27.480]  collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[44:27.480 --> 44:34.000]  the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[44:34.000 --> 44:40.080]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030,
[44:40.080 --> 44:42.720]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[44:42.720 --> 44:44.320]  And none of it can succeed.
[44:44.320 --> 44:49.960]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[44:49.960 --> 44:53.720]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[44:53.720 --> 44:57.880]  And that's why it's hard to share infowar's links and band up video links.
[44:57.880 --> 45:00.680]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[45:00.680 --> 45:08.120]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[45:08.120 --> 45:11.320]  until the populations rebelled.
[45:11.320 --> 45:16.840]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[45:16.840 --> 45:19.720]  anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[45:19.720 --> 45:25.280]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[45:25.280 --> 45:30.960]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[45:30.960 --> 45:35.240]  that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[45:35.240 --> 45:38.520]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[45:38.520 --> 45:42.960]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[45:42.960 --> 45:48.840]  Like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario
[45:48.840 --> 45:52.040]  and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[45:52.040 --> 45:53.560]  So pray for these folks big time.
[45:53.560 --> 45:58.920]  It's a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowar's.com because truth is absolutely
[45:58.920 --> 46:01.520]  bare mountain.
[46:01.520 --> 46:05.400]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[46:05.400 --> 46:10.960]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss like everybody else
[46:10.960 --> 46:11.960]  has.
[46:11.960 --> 46:21.680]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died
[46:21.680 --> 46:25.400]  and bled and sweat for.
[46:25.400 --> 46:31.840]  And now we're just throwing it all away and I see the general public, ENA, medically induced,
[46:31.840 --> 46:38.600]  scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled, transient, and I know we're being
[46:38.600 --> 46:42.240]  fed into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad.
[46:42.240 --> 46:49.400]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[46:49.400 --> 46:52.160]  and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[46:52.160 --> 46:57.240]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence
[46:57.240 --> 47:01.200]  and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[47:01.200 --> 47:11.720]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:11.720 --> 47:28.960]  All right, Marjorie Taylor Greene's getting ready to come in studio next hour with us
[47:28.960 --> 47:33.640]  here on the Alex Jones show and remember I said I have over 20 clips, it's actually more
[47:33.640 --> 47:38.520]  than that, with them admitting they run governments, admitting they've taken over society, admitting
[47:38.520 --> 47:41.160]  they're in full control and we're going to get to those.
[47:41.160 --> 47:48.320]  But here is the finance minister, the deputy prime minister of Canada who openly is on the
[47:48.320 --> 47:53.800]  board of directors of the Bilderberg Group's public organization, the World Economic Forum
[47:53.800 --> 47:58.800]  that's running all this saying now this is going to be a permanent emergency, we need
[47:58.800 --> 48:03.280]  permanent powers and now we have the police saying any conservative protesting against
[48:03.280 --> 48:05.240]  lockdowns is illegal.
[48:05.240 --> 48:09.680]  Biden has that in his national announcements as well from June of last year that any protesting
[48:09.680 --> 48:13.040]  or against lockdowns is terror.
[48:13.040 --> 48:16.800]  This convicts them, this proves how bad they are.
[48:16.800 --> 48:20.560]  Let me finish that clip though that we went to with her announcing just, this is just
[48:20.560 --> 48:26.240]  a Friday, this is two days ago, that oh we need to make the emergency permanent for anybody
[48:26.240 --> 48:31.200]  we don't like without a court order, without anything, the government, that means them,
[48:31.200 --> 48:35.360]  that's what they want is the world cashless society, the social credit score, based on
[48:35.360 --> 48:41.160]  that vaccine passport, the bureaucrats say with the banks who can have bank accounts
[48:41.160 --> 48:44.600]  and who can, here it is.
[48:44.600 --> 48:54.840]  In terms of the financial instruments which our government is using right now to act against
[48:54.840 --> 49:03.080]  these illegal blockades and illegal occupation, we reviewed very, very carefully the tools
[49:03.080 --> 49:11.320]  at the disposal of the federal government and we used all the tools that we had prior
[49:11.320 --> 49:18.040]  to the invocation of the emergencies act and we determined that we needed some additional
[49:18.040 --> 49:19.040]  tools.
[49:19.040 --> 49:26.960]  Now some of those tools we will be putting forward measures to put those tools permanently
[49:26.960 --> 49:28.560]  in place.
[49:28.560 --> 49:34.160]  The authorities of FinTrack, I believe, do need to be expanded to cover crowdsourcing
[49:34.160 --> 49:42.080]  platforms and payment platform and their payment providers.
[49:42.080 --> 49:48.840]  So that is something that we need to do and we will do and that needs to be in place permanently.
[49:48.840 --> 49:50.480]  All right, let's shut that down.
[49:50.480 --> 49:56.320]  It goes on the full clips on InfoWars and FinTrack's, this whole UN global government
[49:56.320 --> 50:01.360]  system and you can go to the World Economic Forum and she is the deputy prime minister
[50:01.360 --> 50:06.240]  and the deputy head of the World Economic Forum on the board of directors of it.
[50:06.240 --> 50:07.960]  Here, here's Klaus Schwab.
[50:07.960 --> 50:13.320]  You saw that member of parliament on Friday go, hey, Klaus Schwab brags that he controls
[50:13.320 --> 50:19.920]  half the parliament, many other parliaments or half the cabinet of the government of the
[50:19.920 --> 50:20.920]  prime minister.
[50:20.920 --> 50:24.520]  They're like, sorry, that's this info, you can't talk about that, even though they brag
[50:24.520 --> 50:25.520]  about it.
[50:25.520 --> 50:27.880]  Here's one of the clips they're talking about.
[50:27.880 --> 50:35.400]  Prime minister, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, friends.
[50:35.400 --> 50:45.200]  As you know, the theme of this annual meeting is mastering the force industrial revolution.
[50:45.200 --> 50:54.480]  I couldn't imagine anybody who could represent more the world which will come out of this
[50:54.480 --> 50:58.680]  force industrial revolution.
[50:58.680 --> 51:03.040]  It certainly will be a world, hopefully, not certainly, hopefully, if it takes the
[51:03.040 --> 51:12.120]  right decisions, which will be a diverse world characterized by plurality.
[51:12.120 --> 51:20.960]  It will be a world which will combine significant investments into the future, into our soft
[51:20.960 --> 51:28.560]  and hard infrastructure with fostering entrepreneurial activity.
[51:28.560 --> 51:35.520]  He goes on to say in the clip that we have on screen that Trudeau is the ultimate example
[51:35.520 --> 51:38.120]  of this great reset in their takeover.
[51:38.120 --> 51:41.400]  Here's the actual clip I wonder, I guess we've got them mixed up for so many.
[51:41.400 --> 51:46.160]  This is Klaus Schwab with David Gergen at the Kennedy Center bragging that he controls
[51:46.160 --> 51:49.440]  the cabinet and controls many of the leaders of the world.
[51:49.440 --> 51:51.800]  His favorite example of this is Justin Trudeau.
[51:51.800 --> 52:01.040]  When I mentioned our names like Mrs. Merkel, even Vladimir Putin and so on, they all have
[52:01.040 --> 52:05.440]  been young global leaders of the world economic forum.
[52:05.440 --> 52:14.760]  But what we are very proud of now is the young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau, President
[52:14.760 --> 52:20.440]  of Argentina and so on, that we penetrate the cabinets.
[52:20.440 --> 52:31.160]  So yesterday I was at a reception for Prime Minister Trudeau and I would know that half
[52:31.160 --> 52:38.880]  of this cabinet or even more half of this cabinet are for our actually young global
[52:38.880 --> 52:41.040]  leaders of the world economic forum.
[52:41.040 --> 52:46.200]  And that's true in Argentina as well.
[52:46.200 --> 52:48.360]  It's true in Argentina.
[52:48.360 --> 52:51.480]  Let's cut that off, he goes on and brags it's everywhere people are on to him.
[52:51.480 --> 52:55.640]  Now here's something good before we go to break and come back with MTG, Marjorie Taylor
[52:55.640 --> 52:57.800]  Green in studio next hour, so excited.
[52:57.800 --> 53:03.080]  Alberta Premier Jason Kenney talks about the great reset and lays it out in very simple
[53:03.080 --> 53:04.440]  to understand terms.
[53:04.440 --> 53:07.760]  This is so important and we're going to start the next hour whether you're listening on
[53:07.760 --> 53:12.080]  AM and FM, local TV, however, tell folks tune in that they don't want you to hear this.
[53:12.080 --> 53:16.200]  The revolution against tyranny is now, here's part of this patriot, a major governor, Premier
[53:16.200 --> 53:17.200]  up in Canada.
[53:17.200 --> 53:23.320]  Ricky Butterworth, or it might be Cindy Butterworth says, where do you stand on the great reset
[53:23.320 --> 53:26.400]  the Liberals are planning on introducing?
[53:26.400 --> 53:33.720]  Well let me just say that first of all what is this great reset?
[53:33.720 --> 53:38.760]  Pierre Polyev, the Federal Conservative Finance critic recently raised concerns about this
[53:38.760 --> 53:43.000]  and then he was attacked by some in the media and by the Liberals for supposedly circulating
[53:43.000 --> 53:44.000]  conspiracy theories.
[53:44.000 --> 53:50.440]  Well, the great reset is actually the name of a book by a very prominent advocate of
[53:50.440 --> 53:51.440]  it.
[53:51.440 --> 53:55.160]  His name is Klaus Schwab, he sent me a copy, I guess he sent one to probably every government
[53:55.160 --> 54:04.120]  leader around the world and Klaus Schwab's thesis in his book is that we should governments
[54:04.120 --> 54:11.160]  and societies, the world should, quotes, seize the opportunity of the public health and economic
[54:11.160 --> 54:19.240]  crisis to reimagine the world and radically change policies.
[54:19.240 --> 54:24.680]  In what ways, I would describe it as a grab bag of left-wing ideas for less freedom and
[54:24.680 --> 54:33.680]  more government, for more government intervention, for policies that would I think create massive
[54:33.680 --> 54:39.680]  poverty, particularly energy policy, policies that he is advocating, so Klaus Schwab by
[54:39.680 --> 54:45.760]  the way is the President and Founder of the World Economic Forum, also known as the Davos
[54:45.760 --> 54:46.760]  Summit.
[54:46.760 --> 54:51.320]  I call it the biggest gathering of global hypocrites in history.
[54:51.320 --> 55:01.360]  It's a little ski village in Switzerland and every I think February a couple of thousand
[55:01.360 --> 55:08.080]  super rich people, a lot of billionaires, millionaires, global CEOs and politicians fly
[55:08.080 --> 55:13.600]  into Davos with hundreds of private airplanes, they go into Switzerland and they spend a
[55:13.600 --> 55:19.560]  week basically lecturing the rest of the world, especially working women and men, about how
[55:19.560 --> 55:22.160]  they should reduce their carbon footprint.
[55:22.160 --> 55:28.840]  The hypocrisy in that crowd is so thick you can't even cut it with a knife.
[55:28.840 --> 55:34.640]  And so, no, I'm not going to be taking any policy direction from Klaus Schwab or his
[55:34.640 --> 55:35.640]  ilk.
[55:35.640 --> 55:41.880]  And what I find offensive, look, the so-called great reset, it's not a conspiracy theory,
[55:41.880 --> 55:48.640]  it is an actual set of concrete proposals being advocated by some very influential people
[55:48.640 --> 55:54.440]  and including apparently by Prime Minister Trudeau, who's clearly alluded to it, referred
[55:54.440 --> 55:59.120]  to it, quoted from it, the Schwab theory in a speech he gave to the United Nations a
[55:59.120 --> 56:00.120]  couple of months ago.
[56:00.120 --> 56:02.880]  So, it's not a conspiracy theory to talk about that.
[56:02.880 --> 56:08.280]  Those are the folks advocating it, and I think it's perfectly legitimate for democratically
[56:08.280 --> 56:17.040]  elected leaders for me to say, heck no, we're not going to exploit or take advantage of
[56:17.040 --> 56:24.280]  a crisis to advance a political agenda.
[56:24.280 --> 56:30.480]  If we're actually all in this together, like we keep saying, then how about we focus on
[56:30.480 --> 56:37.400]  the crisis, on protecting lives and livelihoods, helping people get through this?
[56:37.400 --> 56:45.680]  And how about after that, instead of exploiting the crisis to impose on democratic societies
[56:45.680 --> 56:54.680]  a whole bunch of failed socialist policy ideas, how about instead we get refocused on generating
[56:54.680 --> 57:00.600]  economic growth, on recreating some of the trillions of dollars of wealth that will have
[57:00.600 --> 57:05.480]  been destroyed, of restarting some of the hundreds of thousands of businesses that will
[57:05.480 --> 57:13.480]  have gone under, of obsessively focusing on getting the millions, the tens of millions
[57:13.480 --> 57:19.320]  around the world back to work, those who have suffered most in the COVID era have been the
[57:19.320 --> 57:22.680]  poorest around the world.
[57:22.680 --> 57:27.480]  And so the notion that we would then drive them further into energy poverty through Klaus
[57:27.480 --> 57:32.760]  Schwab's policy agenda is, I just frankly find it offensive.
[57:32.760 --> 57:36.320]  So no, it's not a conspiracy and nor is it a conspiracy theory.
[57:36.320 --> 57:46.080]  I think it's just very distasteful and regrettable that influential people would explicitly seek
[57:46.080 --> 58:14.560]  to take advantage of a crisis like this to advance their own
[58:14.560 --> 58:19.560]  economy.
[58:19.560 --> 58:25.160]  melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution, so the ingredients
[58:25.160 --> 58:28.880]  are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[58:28.880 --> 58:34.080]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally
[58:34.080 --> 58:39.240]  used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[58:39.240 --> 58:44.080]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep, because you will
[58:44.080 --> 58:45.960]  be down and out.

[59:51.240 --> 1:00:04.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:04.720 --> 1:00:10.440]  There are millions now waking up to the fact that they have been used in some sort of nefarious
[1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:17.160]  scientific experiment, and many are suffering serious physical side effects as a result.
[1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:23.840]  We can clearly see in the evidence presented by Dr. Jeden's crew at HowBadIsMyBatch.com
[1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:29.000]  that different batches of the same vaccine are being deployed and monitored on a set
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  schedule.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.920]  And studies from New Zealand and Spain have shown that there is cutting-edge nanotech
[1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:35.920]  in the Pfizer vaccine.
[1:00:35.920 --> 1:00:43.280]  It is a massive human experiment, it's killing people, injuring people, and destroying people's
[1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:48.680]  immune, neurological, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems.
[1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:54.680]  People who trusted their government, and people who trusted the pharmaceutical industry.
[1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:58.040]  Trust is a beautiful thing with someone close.
[1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:02.400]  But not with strangers we see on the television, and there is never a good reason to trust
[1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:03.920]  your government.
[1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:09.080]  When a bloated government's main concern is profit and war, then psychopaths with
[1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:14.840]  degrees will be funded to research and develop more efficient ways of killing and controlling
[1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:16.040]  people.
[1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:20.080]  This has been going on for a long, long time.
[1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:26.880]  In 1932, the U.S. Public Health Service began the Tuskegee Syphilis experiment.
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:31.760]  Russians were lied to about being treated for syphilis, and were unknowingly kept sick
[1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:34.040]  and made worse.
[1:01:34.040 --> 1:01:39.120]  During World War II, the Russians were using unsuspecting political prisoners to test lethal
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:41.320]  poisons on.
[1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:45.880]  The U.S. tested mustard gas on soldiers.
[1:01:45.880 --> 1:01:50.600]  The Japanese tested biological weapons on Chinese prisoners.
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:55.880]  And the infamous Angel of Death, Dr. Joseph Mengele, was performing all sorts of horrific
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:02:00.320]  experiments on people in the concentration camps.
[1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:05.520]  Researchers at Vanderbilt University gave pregnant mothers radioactive iron.
[1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:09.080]  In what they were told were vitamin drinks.
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:15.220]  In the 1950s, Dr. William Sweet was funded by the government to inject unsuspecting patients
[1:02:15.220 --> 1:02:19.560]  at Massachusetts General Hospital with uranium.
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:24.720]  Immunology expert Chester Southam injected prisoners in Ohio with cancer.
[1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:30.440]  The University of California experimented on newborns by freezing them and injecting
[1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:32.440]  air into their brains.
[1:02:32.440 --> 1:02:38.800]  Israeli doctors killed tens of thousands of Arab children with radiation poisoning.
[1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:43.720]  And in Montreal, Canada, Dr. Ewan Cameron was treating hundreds of patients with the
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:45.920]  same bizarre procedure.
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:51.720]  Whether they were seeking a remedy for schizophrenia, depression, or an injured leg, Dr. Cameron
[1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:57.600]  treated them all by putting them into a chemical coma for up to months at a time while subjecting
[1:02:57.600 --> 1:02:59.600]  their bodies to electroshock.
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:05.760]  And just a few years prior to this, Dr. Cameron was invited to the Nuremberg Trials for a
[1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:10.360]  psychiatric evaluation of Rudolph Hess.
[1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:17.840]  Perhaps the darkest and most prevalent experiment on humanity prior to COVID-19 is MKUltra,
[1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:23.960]  an endless web of inhumane projects primarily involving trauma-based mind control and the
[1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:26.960]  torture of children.
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:33.400]  While legacy media often shows you the lurid sex and drugs aspect of MKUltra, they don't
[1:03:33.400 --> 1:03:39.360]  show you the congressional testimony of victims who were kept in cages, raped, and tortured
[1:03:39.360 --> 1:03:43.760]  as children in part of the U.S. government's human radiation experiments.
[1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:50.000]  I was a subject in radiation as well as mind control and drug experiments performed by
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:53.080]  a man I knew as Dr. Green.
[1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:58.600]  The first significant memory took place at Kansas City University in 1966.
[1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:02.440]  Don Ebbner took me there by plane when my mom was out of town.
[1:04:02.440 --> 1:04:07.000]  I was in what looked like a laboratory and there seemed to be other children.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:12.040]  I was strapped down, naked, spread eagle on a table on my back.
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:15.920]  Dr. Green had electrodes on my body, including my head.
[1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:21.080]  He used what looked like an overhead projector and repeatedly said he was burning different
[1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:25.760]  images into my brain while a red light flashed aimed at my forehead.
[1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:30.800]  I felt drug because he had given me a shot before he started the procedure.
[1:04:30.800 --> 1:04:33.720]  When it was over, he gave me another shot.
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:39.040]  The next thing I remember, I was with my grandparents again in Tucson, Arizona.
[1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:41.120]  I was four years old.
[1:04:41.120 --> 1:04:46.320]  The victims were given an apology by a smirking President Clinton, which is more than most
[1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:48.920]  victims have ever gotten.
[1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:49.920]  Nothing has changed.
[1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:55.800]  These are only a few of the many illegal human experiments that we know of and there has
[1:04:55.800 --> 1:04:59.960]  never been any justice.
[1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:05.480]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[1:05:05.480 --> 1:05:11.200]  Both the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[1:05:11.200 --> 1:05:15.400]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[1:05:15.400 --> 1:05:20.520]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[1:05:20.520 --> 1:05:25.400]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:29.840]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:34.720]  unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:37.840]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:41.200]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:45.840]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[1:05:45.840 --> 1:05:46.840]  an end.
[1:05:46.840 --> 1:05:52.640]  And so we must prepare, get up to a years worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival
[1:05:52.640 --> 1:06:02.000]  gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:23.160]  Well, I can care less about Hollywood stars, I can care less about politicians, I can care
[1:06:23.160 --> 1:06:29.600]  less about anybody but my family and other hard charging patriots that love liberty.
[1:06:29.600 --> 1:06:33.520]  But I get some butterflies and excited and was pacing up and down before she got here
[1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:40.280]  because I am extremely excited to have MTG, Marjorie Taylor Greene from Georgia's 14th
[1:06:40.280 --> 1:06:44.400]  district with us right now because of all the great people, there's quite a few good
[1:06:44.400 --> 1:06:46.280]  people in Congress, quite a few bad ones.
[1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:48.600]  I got to say, she's probably my favorite.
[1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:52.560]  There's a few good ones up there, but I tell you, she is just the most genuine and she's
[1:06:52.560 --> 1:06:56.160]  the most popular of anybody that got elected in the last round, but the system's coming
[1:06:56.160 --> 1:07:03.480]  after her big time, she's up for re-election, we're going to tell you all about that, mtg4america.com.
[1:07:03.480 --> 1:07:07.360]  And I wanted to talk to her about the tipping point and the global awakening and the elites
[1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:08.360]  against the people.
[1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:11.640]  And I said, what do you want to cover first, right before we went live?
[1:07:11.640 --> 1:07:15.920]  And she said the first thing on my list, and my list was in this folder she hadn't seen,
[1:07:15.920 --> 1:07:19.000]  it's weird definitely, synced up right now.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:23.760]  So MTG, it's great to have you in Austin, Texas, it's amazing to have you in studio.
[1:07:23.760 --> 1:07:24.760]  Thank you so much.
[1:07:24.760 --> 1:07:26.800]  I'm so happy to be here with you, Alex.
[1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:31.640]  I think this is some of the most fun type of interviews I can do, so I'm so happy that
[1:07:31.640 --> 1:07:32.640]  I'm here.
[1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:35.800]  Well, we're all excited to have you here, it's amazing.
[1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:40.560]  So I don't want to try to recreate what you said, repeat what you said before we went
[1:07:40.560 --> 1:07:45.360]  live about how the establishment sees us now that you've gone from Georgia as a business
[1:07:45.360 --> 1:07:49.120]  lady and a mother and a patriot, now you've been there two years, you've been in the belly
[1:07:49.120 --> 1:07:51.960]  of the beast, you had a great description of what's happening.
[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:57.280]  Well, I tell you, for me what I see, and I'm just a regular person, I've never been in
[1:07:57.280 --> 1:08:02.320]  politics before, and going to Washington, the most disturbing thing that I have found
[1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:06.200]  is that the people in Washington, it's like a little bubble, and it's this tiny little
[1:08:06.200 --> 1:08:11.320]  world, and if you really look at it, it's a small percentage of people, but they truly
[1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:15.760]  look down on the rest of America, and they think that everything they think in their
[1:08:15.760 --> 1:08:20.760]  little bubble and what they want for our country is the most important thing, but they look
[1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:27.440]  down on the common American man and woman, and they just don't care, they're so disconnected.
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:32.760]  That's why all they want is like war in Ukraine, instead of even thinking about truckers who
[1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:36.780]  deliver food and supplies, they don't even care about kids wearing masks, they don't
[1:08:36.780 --> 1:08:40.800]  care about our border with fentanyl pouring across killing young people and being the
[1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:45.760]  number one cause of death, not COVID-19, and it just bothers me so much.
[1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:51.440]  They treat me as if I'm some kind of crazy person, or like I have three horns coming
[1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:55.480]  out of my head, but what they don't understand is they're the ones that are crazy and they're
[1:08:55.480 --> 1:08:57.000]  the ones that are so disconnected.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:01.720]  Well, that's the gaslighting that they're engaged in, I mean if you look at it, the
[1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:06.520]  trends worldwide are the populism and the people, not even about conservative or liberal,
[1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:11.640]  and deep down they know that, they're trying to gaslight us, at least the controllers at
[1:09:11.640 --> 1:09:16.920]  the top are, but I think the average leftist, I agree with you, actually does think you've
[1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:21.760]  got five heads or I've got six heads, and that they actually believe their own BS.
[1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:24.400]  I think they do too, and I tell you why.
[1:09:24.400 --> 1:09:29.600]  I think they're really scared of the American people, because here's what they do know.
[1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:33.720]  They know that if the American people actually woke up from the dream that they're living
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:39.440]  in, the so-called American dream where it's more like entertainment, like Roman games
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:41.080]  or something like that.
[1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:45.240]  And I think the elites in Washington, you know, the ones that sit in the think tanks,
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:51.560]  the political consultants, the neocons, the ones drumming the drums of war, if they really
[1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:55.800]  look hard at America they know that the American people can end everything they're trying
[1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:58.360]  to do if the American people wanted to.
[1:09:58.360 --> 1:10:03.160]  So not only do they look down on the American people, because they can never make it a day
[1:10:03.160 --> 1:10:07.880]  in our shoes, never make it a day in your shoes where you're working, you get up early,
[1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:11.840]  you go to work, you balance your checkbook, you pay your bills, you're not in debt like
[1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:13.440]  the federal government is.
[1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:17.400]  You're taking care of your kids, driving them to school, helping them with homework.
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:21.640]  You're making all the right decisions for your family, and they couldn't do it, not
[1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:26.040]  a single day like the American people, American people can and do.
[1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:29.240]  And by the way, you're not just saying that, I mean, you had a good idea of this when you
[1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:32.800]  ran for Congress and won, but now you've seen it.
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:36.800]  And I've been around these people as well over the 20-plus years I've been on air.
[1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:41.360]  They literally pull you aside and they're like, why are you helping the average scum?
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:42.360]  They're commoners.
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:44.480]  And I'm like, no, you're the scum.
[1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:49.200]  People need to know how these corporate elitists, not just Democrats, some Republicans, literally
[1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:53.120]  their whole world is that they're an elite and you're scum.
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:58.240]  And then they tell you America's scum and America's bad and America's racist when this
[1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:00.120]  elitism is beyond racism.
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:04.320]  They hate everybody that isn't part of their power structure, including independently wealthy
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:08.280]  people and middle-class business owners, they want full control.
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:11.880]  It's like in that movie, There Will Be Blood that's based on a famous novel that's based
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:13.680]  on composite of real oil men.
[1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:16.960]  And there's this one guy that becomes one of the top oil men and he goes, I have a competitiveness
[1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:17.960]  in me.
[1:11:17.960 --> 1:11:19.280]  I don't want anyone else to succeed.
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:21.040]  Well, that's not what America's about.
[1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:24.200]  It's about competitiveness and we want to see everybody succeed.
[1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:27.480]  These people literally do not want to see anybody succeed, but them.
[1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:32.000]  What was the journey running like for Congress and winning by record numbers and being demonized
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  and attacked and being the woman in the arena that Teddy Roosevelt talked about?
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  What has that process been like?
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.040]  Because it seems like in the last three years, it's made you stronger, not weaker.
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:46.000]  It's made me stronger because I know who I am and I know exactly what the American people
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.840]  think and feel.
[1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:53.920]  And going to Congress for me was all about taking what I know can happen at home, what
[1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:58.080]  I know it takes to be successful and taking that into Congress in the place where I see
[1:11:58.080 --> 1:12:02.960]  failing America, completely failing the American people.
[1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:03.960]  It's been crazy.
[1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:04.960]  It's been the wildest ride.
[1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:07.120]  I feel like I'm in a movie every single day.
[1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:09.440]  And here's what I can tell you.
[1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:14.920]  When I got there, this is what they told me, Marjorie, that's not how we do things.
[1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:16.480]  You see, they wanted me to come there.
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:19.680]  They want all the new members of Congress to come and learn.
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:21.520]  So talk about that.
[1:12:21.520 --> 1:12:22.520]  Talk about so.
[1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:23.520]  So I mean, how did it happen?
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:24.640]  They kind of pull you aside, taking the launch.
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:25.640]  What happens?
[1:12:25.640 --> 1:12:28.360]  Well, it just comes gradually from different people.
[1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:32.360]  And so they have their committees, everything set up on committees, and what you have to
[1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:37.520]  do is you have to vote the way the chairman or the leaders of the committees want you
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:38.520]  to vote.
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:42.240]  And that's how you're being a team player, and that's how you're doing the right thing.
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:45.800]  And if you're not doing that, then they want to minimize you.
[1:12:45.800 --> 1:12:46.920]  They want to punish you.
[1:12:46.920 --> 1:12:48.240]  They want to push you out.
[1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:52.120]  They do not want your bills or your voice to be, you know.
[1:12:52.120 --> 1:12:55.320]  So you're saying it's not just the Democrats doing this, it's the Republicans?
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:12:57.040]  Oh, a thousand percent.
[1:12:57.040 --> 1:12:58.360]  It's both parties.
[1:12:58.360 --> 1:13:01.120]  They do it because here's the truth, Alex.
[1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:03.080]  It's really a uniparty in Washington.
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:06.000]  See, there's very few people on the outliers.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  It's mostly a uniparty, and that's why the power that swings back and forth, the pendulum
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.400]  swinging back and forth, it never changes.
[1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:17.040]  It doesn't matter if it's Republicans in control, Democrats in control.
[1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:18.480]  We're still where we are.
[1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:19.480]  Well, that's right.
[1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:21.000]  So who's more evil?
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:25.960]  Really like AOC that's an admitted communist that flies first class and wears $8,000 outfits,
[1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:31.280]  but says a hard-working mom or dad running a business, making $50,000 a year is greedy.
[1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:33.440]  Is she bad because she admits she's evil?
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:37.160]  She admits she's out in the open, or is somebody like Mitch McConnell more evil because he
[1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:41.600]  claims he's with us, but he makes sure that that power structure stays in place?
[1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:43.680]  Well, there's a big comparison there.
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:48.240]  I would say AOC is definitely anti-American.
[1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:50.480]  She's against our American ways.
[1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:51.480]  She's a communist.
[1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:52.480]  She's honestly about it.
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:53.480]  She's honest about it, though.
[1:13:53.480 --> 1:13:54.480]  She'll tell you.
[1:13:54.480 --> 1:13:56.480]  Whereas Mitch McConnell, he lies to your face.
[1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:57.960]  He says he's a Republican.
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:02.640]  He's the leader in the Senate of the Republican Party, but he's married to Elaine Chao, and
[1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:05.240]  they are fully bought and paid for by China.
[1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:06.240]  On record.
[1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:07.240]  On record.
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:09.600]  And everyone knows it, but no one does anything about it.
[1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:14.680]  Just like Feinstein, just like Pelosi, just like Swallowswell, they're literally on the
[1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:16.200]  payroll of the CCP.
[1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:17.640]  Yeah, absolutely they are.
[1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:19.160]  And so are many others.
[1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:20.160]  Think about it.
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:26.120]  Now, for decades now, corporations, the American corporation, they have totally blended into
[1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:30.240]  the system in China, in the CCP, and what has that done to us?
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:34.600]  It's completely sold out the small businesses, sold out the Americans, sold out the American
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:39.680]  taxpayer, sold out the people that love our country, and will do anything to stand for
[1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:40.840]  our freedoms.
[1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:45.440]  And that's what we care about, but it's these people in charge, and it comes from lobbyists.
[1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:50.080]  It comes from former members of Congress who become lobbyists, and they push these policies
[1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:53.280]  that sell America out to China.
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:54.840]  And so are we in trouble?
[1:14:54.840 --> 1:15:00.280]  Oh, yeah, we're in big trouble, and it's, you know, sometimes I wonder, is it too late?
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:01.280]  But I don't think so.
[1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:06.320]  I think I still hold on to hope constantly, because I do believe in the American people.
[1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:07.320]  I think the Americans.
[1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:08.320]  I mean, I believe in you.
[1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:09.840]  I mean, I know you're for real.
[1:15:09.840 --> 1:15:11.520]  I know your voting record is amazing.
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:16.400]  And I know you're an example of a grassroots, hardworking, smart person standing up and going
[1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:21.320]  against the system, and if you can inspire others, and if we can inspire others, we're
[1:15:21.320 --> 1:15:22.320]  going to win this fight.
[1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:23.320]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:15:23.320 --> 1:15:28.560]  I really appreciate it, because I think it's regular people that can win the fight.
[1:15:28.560 --> 1:15:30.160]  And this is something that we're seeing.
[1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:34.280]  We're seeing parents going to their school boards and fighting on behalf of their kids.
[1:15:34.280 --> 1:15:36.400]  But I think they have to keep going.
[1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:39.960]  It's not enough to just go to your school board and demand to stop this mass.
[1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:41.400]  It's not enough to back them off.
[1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:42.920]  We got to remove these criminals.
[1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:43.920]  Absolutely.
[1:15:43.920 --> 1:15:46.080]  We have to get them out of their position.
[1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:50.080]  The TG in the house, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:53.680]  That sounds better than DJ T. Who knows, maybe she'll be his vice presidential candidate
[1:15:53.680 --> 1:15:54.680]  coming up in a year.
[1:15:54.680 --> 1:15:56.440]  But she's running for Congress right now.
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:15:58.720]  Keep her in there.
[1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:04.000]  Climb to the top of the food chain with alpha power by Infowars Life.
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:10.320]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels, most men know that testosterone
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:16.760]  levels begin to decline, starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2% per year.
[1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:23.960]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:28.440]  Alpha power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on
[1:16:28.440 --> 1:16:29.440]  the market.
[1:16:29.440 --> 1:16:35.960]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:42.920]  into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo
[1:16:42.920 --> 1:16:48.920]  from Peru, horny goatweed from China and tribulus from India.

[1:16:57.680 --> 1:16:59.560]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[1:16:59.560 --> 1:17:03.440]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research.
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:09.360]  Now, if you read the actual 2014 legislation, the U.S. government gained of function deliberative
[1:17:09.360 --> 1:17:15.160]  process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza
[1:17:15.160 --> 1:17:16.360]  and MERS and ZARS viruses.
[1:17:16.360 --> 1:17:21.080]  There's nothing about ZARS-like viruses, and if the research funding pause, it's not
[1:17:21.080 --> 1:17:25.120]  a stop, it's not a prohibition, it's when you come to a four-way intersection, there's
[1:17:25.120 --> 1:17:30.120]  the stop sign, you stop, you look both ways, and then you proceed, and so it doesn't pause
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:33.040]  all gain of function, just selected gain of function.
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:38.760]  They'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research, though Rand and
[1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:42.320]  the others, maybe Fauci was right, they don't quite know what they're talking about, calling
[1:17:42.320 --> 1:17:45.760]  it gain of function, that's why he didn't perjure himself, that's why he hasn't been
[1:17:45.760 --> 1:17:46.760]  arrested.
[1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:50.760]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do,
[1:17:50.760 --> 1:17:53.800]  but in the main definition, it's still a gain of function.
[1:17:53.800 --> 1:17:56.480]  They're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[1:17:56.480 --> 1:17:57.480]  Thank you, Mike.
[1:17:57.480 --> 1:17:58.480]  We love you.
[1:17:58.480 --> 1:18:02.800]  I've been a doctor for more than 25 years, and long before I started selling high-quality
[1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:10.720]  vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3, because it is essential.
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:15.640]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic,
[1:18:15.640 --> 1:18:20.640]  it doesn't matter, your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that
[1:18:20.640 --> 1:18:21.640]  are out there.
[1:18:21.640 --> 1:18:25.680]  It's just like you need oxygen, you die in four minutes without oxygen, you die in five
[1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:28.680]  or six days without water, you die in a month without food.
[1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:33.720]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that
[1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:34.800]  you need.
[1:18:34.800 --> 1:18:38.840]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.

[1:19:59.560 --> 1:20:25.400]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:25.400 --> 1:20:39.320]  We got the little angel from Georgia with us right now, the MTG, and I got to tell you,
[1:20:39.320 --> 1:20:44.000]  I like Gavin Nunes, he did a great job down his left, run the social thing with Trump.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:48.920]  I really like Jim Jordan, I really like Matt Gaetz, I really like so many great people
[1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:54.840]  but I got to tell you MTG, every time I see you on TV there's no telling what you're
[1:20:54.840 --> 1:20:58.800]  going to be saying but it's always true and you're so popular because people can see,
[1:20:58.800 --> 1:21:02.440]  you're unscripted but you're really smart and you're real and that's scaring the power
[1:21:02.440 --> 1:21:03.440]  structure.
[1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:07.280]  Well thank you Alex, I hope so because I'm tired of the power structure.
[1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:10.840]  They've sold out our country and they're selling out our kids.
[1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:13.960]  And that's where you wanted to go next and I happen to have a giant stack of news.
[1:21:13.960 --> 1:21:17.000]  Let me just read a few headlines because you can't make this up.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:24.960]  This is from KTLA, okay that's one of the biggest stations in the country, get ready
[1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:31.400]  for this, outrage parents demand answers that for non-binary male counselors were allowed
[1:21:31.400 --> 1:21:35.920]  to sleep in fifth grade girls' cabins at school sponsored camp event.
[1:21:35.920 --> 1:21:43.040]  There's video of biological men sleeping with the fifth grade girls.
[1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:49.080]  It gets worse, Facebook LGBT activist caught in alleged child sexting operation flying
[1:21:49.080 --> 1:21:54.800]  to Indiana, number four at Facebook to have sex with a 13-year-old.
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:58.920]  This one, trans swimmers face off in Ivy League, we told you it just did all be men
[1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:01.320]  in women's sports.
[1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:05.640]  Trans swimmers face off in Ivy League meet and the results up in transphobic arguments
[1:22:05.640 --> 1:22:10.080]  against their participation, yahoo thinks it's great because both men competed against
[1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:11.080]  each other.
[1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:13.400]  Now what does that even mean?
[1:22:13.400 --> 1:22:18.600]  Transgender Ivy League swimmers face off and it goes on from there.
[1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:21.840]  Look at this ladies and gentlemen, I don't hate somebody if they want to be a woman,
[1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:22.840]  they think they are.
[1:22:22.840 --> 1:22:27.440]  But I love even how Fox News says two women competed like two women in a federal prison
[1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:32.800]  had a baby or two women in a state prison had a baby, no a man saying they're a woman
[1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:33.800]  did it.
[1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:42.640]  It is incredible gaslighting going on and MTG is here to give her take on this, so much
[1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:43.640]  to deal with her.
[1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:46.180]  Oh, I think it's straight evil.
[1:22:46.180 --> 1:22:52.000]  First off, if I was a parent and my fifth grade daughter had to sleep and shower in
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:57.040]  some kind of cabin at some summer camp that I paid money to send my child to and there
[1:22:57.040 --> 1:23:02.640]  was a man calling himself a woman sleeping in her cabin, showering with her, that guy
[1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:04.160]  would be in jail.
[1:23:04.160 --> 1:23:05.160]  He would be in jail.
[1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:08.840]  Well first off, my husband would have beat him into the ground and then he'd be in jail.
[1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:11.760]  But this is exactly how we need to stand up against this stuff.
[1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:17.160]  And then the men, this guy, Leah, Leah Thompson, I'm sorry that's William and he's not a she,
[1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:21.280]  he's a he, he should not be competing in women's swimming.
[1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:26.720]  Any time he wins, he did not win whoever came in second place, the real girl in the race,
[1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:27.720]  she's the winner.
[1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:30.800]  He should be thrown out of swimming completely.
[1:23:30.800 --> 1:23:34.280]  All of the men I do not care about, it shouldn't matter about what they do in their bedroom
[1:23:34.280 --> 1:23:36.040]  if they want to wear a dress, fine.
[1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:38.640]  But what they're doing is they are defeating women.
[1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:41.960]  It's about beating women down and the left stands up for it.
[1:23:41.960 --> 1:23:45.000]  And this is where America needs to say enough.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:48.800]  Most Americans agree that this is wrong and it's absolutely ridiculous.
[1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:52.800]  And I don't know why Fox News or anyone else goes along with the whole pronouns, the he's
[1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:54.920]  in the she's in the she's in whatever.
[1:23:54.920 --> 1:23:55.920]  These are men.
[1:23:55.920 --> 1:23:57.120]  We need to call them what they are.
[1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:02.400]  They're men that makes them a he, a him and not play this pronoun game anymore.
[1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:04.720]  And let's expand on that.
[1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:07.040]  Dave Chappelle is no conservative.
[1:24:07.040 --> 1:24:11.440]  He came out and said, listen, women need their own space just like everybody else does.
[1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:14.840]  I have three daughters, but even if you don't have daughters, can you imagine what it's
[1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:21.840]  like to have full grown men around the country showering with your daughters because they
[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:24.400]  say they are biologically a woman?
[1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:27.280]  This isn't just other male students that claim they're female.
[1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:28.800]  This is adults.
[1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:32.960]  And this is causing people just to totally freak out.
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:37.600]  And like you said, they're stealing women's spaces and children are being taught with
[1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:42.520]  drag queen story time that a big fat man and a clown outfit is a woman.
[1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:43.800]  I'm sorry.
[1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:45.320]  That's not a woman.
[1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:48.120]  That's a big fat man or a little boy dressed up like a girl.
[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:51.200]  This is all very, very sexualization of children.
[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:54.240]  In fact, I can't show this video in Austin, part of what we have.
[1:24:54.240 --> 1:24:59.320]  They had men on stage with little kids giving them money who had no G-strings on saying they
[1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:04.200]  were women with glitter on their genitals and hugging little kids, naked men.
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:09.840]  This is four years ago in Austin, naked men literally grabbing children.
[1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:12.920]  No, how did we get here, Alex?
[1:25:12.920 --> 1:25:14.760]  I can't even understand that.
[1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:17.280]  That should never, ever happen, ever.
[1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:18.280]  This is so evil.
[1:25:18.280 --> 1:25:19.920]  I can't even believe these videos.
[1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:21.760]  No, but here's what we have to do.
[1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:25.760]  We have to draw the line in the sand and say we are not willing to cross it.
[1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:29.400]  This is such perversion, but it's also grooming children.
[1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:34.160]  It's grooming them to believe things that are lies and that are completely wrong.
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:38.520]  No, children are not born a certain way thinking they're another gender.
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:41.120]  It's their parents that are training them that way.
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:43.520]  It's these mothers that think it's like a handbag.
[1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:48.000]  They need to have a boy, a girl, and a trans child, like as if there's some kind of accessory.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  Exactly, it's like Hollywood stars and all the things they've engaged in, exactly.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:58.960]  Look at this photo of the progressive leftist not wearing their mask, but showing how the
[1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:00.400]  kids all wear a mask.
[1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:03.840]  It's literally a rite of passage that they have destroyed a child.
[1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:06.440]  They've enslaved them in their MKUltra operation.
[1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:07.680]  Oh, it's sick.
[1:26:07.680 --> 1:26:11.000]  And then, yeah, they don't have masks on and the kids have to be masked.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.320]  It's just so, it's completely wrong.
[1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:14.920]  It's absolutely wrong.
[1:26:14.920 --> 1:26:16.680]  And I don't think it's a bad thing.
[1:26:16.680 --> 1:26:17.680]  Here's what we have to do.
[1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:18.680]  We have to speak out.
[1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:21.960]  I don't think it's wrong to stand up and say, we aren't going to tolerate this.
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:24.720]  Men, get out of our bathroom, get out of our sports.
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:26.480]  These are our private places.
[1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:28.760]  And think about how it's done in the name of helping women.
[1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:32.720]  Oh, we're going to let, it's like that huge 300-pound dude going, it's ma'am.
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:36.880]  It's ma'am while he smashes the store because the guy's like, hey, dude, come on up.
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:38.400]  It's like a huge dude with pink hair.
[1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:39.400]  Hey, bro, come on up.
[1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:40.400]  Oh, it's a ma'am.
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:41.400]  It's a ma'am.
[1:26:41.400 --> 1:26:43.840]  It's an excuse to mess with people.
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:45.000]  Weird psycho dudes.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:50.680]  Yeah, no, it's really disturbing, but here's what bothers me the most is so many good men
[1:26:50.680 --> 1:26:52.080]  are silent with it.
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:56.120]  They won't say anything, Alex, like they don't stand up and protect us.
[1:26:56.120 --> 1:27:02.160]  We want real men to stand up and say, we're not going to allow you in our daughter's bathrooms.
[1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:05.760]  We aren't going to allow you in our girls' cabins at camp.
[1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:10.280]  We aren't going to allow you to beat down our women and our daughters.
[1:27:10.280 --> 1:27:17.000]  Like in the UFC or the UFC so much, but other MMA fighting, they let biological men literally
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:18.640]  kill women in some cases.
[1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:20.560]  Yeah, that's what they would love to do.
[1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:21.560]  They would like it.
[1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:23.720]  It's like they want it to happen, and I can't comprehend it.
[1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:24.720]  I don't understand it.
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:25.720]  I mean, look at this dude.
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:26.720]  He looks like Frankenstein.
[1:27:26.720 --> 1:27:31.040]  Oh, the top weightlifter is a man in the women's sports.
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:34.200]  The top bodybuilder in women's sports is a man.
[1:27:34.200 --> 1:27:36.920]  The top swimmers, the top three are all men.
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:37.920]  They're all men.
[1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:38.920]  They're all men.
[1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:46.720]  And we sit here and let these leftist, weirdo, sicko groups send a man in to women's sports
[1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:48.280]  to unseat them.
[1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:49.840]  That is just sick.
[1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:50.840]  It is sick.
[1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:51.840]  And then they praise them.
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:53.680]  And I'll tell you, I've been an athlete most of my life.
[1:27:53.680 --> 1:27:54.680]  I've competed.
[1:27:54.680 --> 1:27:56.200]  I've been in plenty of races.
[1:27:56.200 --> 1:27:57.560]  I've competed in CrossFit.
[1:27:57.560 --> 1:28:01.560]  My daughter's a D1 athlete in college.
[1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:03.640]  This is such a joke.
[1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:08.240]  Actually watching this guy right here go out there and compete against women, beating
[1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:12.800]  women, and then look, yes, celebrating, oh, wow, wow.
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:14.600]  And then people allow that to happen.
[1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:15.600]  I mean, what a mercury.
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:18.200]  It's a fat slob that beats up on girls.
[1:28:18.200 --> 1:28:19.200]  Yes, that's right.
[1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:21.480]  A fat slob that beats up on girls.
[1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:23.480]  And we sit there and tolerate it.
[1:28:23.480 --> 1:28:26.440]  And then we sit there and say, oh, we have to be nice.
[1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:31.080]  We don't want to hurt his feelings and call him a woman and allow him to do that.
[1:28:31.080 --> 1:28:34.040]  And look, he's got his dingaling bouncing around his pants.
[1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:36.560]  I'm sorry, but he didn't even have the nerve to cut it off.
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:37.560]  Yeah.
[1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:38.560]  They can't.
[1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:40.080]  If they're going to go all the way, they should go all the way.
[1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:41.600]  And I'm not attacking these people.
[1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:42.600]  Yeah.
[1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:43.600]  I'm not even against him.
[1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:46.600]  He's obviously completely mentally ill because who's going to go out and compete?
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:47.600]  I'm against him.
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:48.600]  I don't hate him personally.
[1:28:48.600 --> 1:28:50.600]  No, no, I don't hate him personally.
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:51.600]  I hate what he's doing.
[1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:52.600]  Yes.
[1:28:52.600 --> 1:28:53.600]  I'm completely against him.
[1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:54.600]  Stay right there.
[1:28:54.600 --> 1:29:22.640]  I'm against him.

[1:31:00.960 --> 1:31:06.400]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training probably not as much as they
[1:31:06.400 --> 1:31:12.240]  should be but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarstore.com. Before I set out
[1:31:12.240 --> 1:31:17.760]  on a run I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going you know
[1:31:17.760 --> 1:31:23.360]  besides the energy turbo force it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me
[1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:28.560]  healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy giving me the
[1:31:28.560 --> 1:31:33.760]  best chance at getting through the training and then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones
[1:31:33.760 --> 1:31:39.440]  sorrelous. I have bad joints thanks mom so this is great for giving my joints the extra support
[1:31:39.440 --> 1:31:45.200]  they need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility. The quick release capsules
[1:31:45.200 --> 1:31:50.320]  help me recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even if you're not crazy enough to take
[1:31:50.320 --> 1:31:55.600]  on a marathon good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every
[1:31:55.600 --> 1:32:01.280]  day and sorrelous can keep you moving and feeling great at any age. Anything of real quality,

[1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:21.760]  the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation great reset combine trying to collapse our society
[1:32:21.760 --> 1:32:28.800]  to build on its ashes their their transhumanist nightmare vision suppressing the voices of good
[1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:34.800]  people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all
[1:32:34.800 --> 1:32:41.120]  their lives their COVID hysteria their world's gonna end in 2030 carbon tax global warming bull
[1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:47.360]  all of it and none of it can succeed none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody
[1:32:47.360 --> 1:32:53.360]  is silenced and gas lit that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence
[1:32:53.360 --> 1:32:58.080]  that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band up video links that's why we've got to
[1:32:58.080 --> 1:33:05.360]  share them now more than ever leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's
[1:33:05.360 --> 1:33:19.440]  alex jones and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say i don't know what's
[1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:26.880]  going to happen to me into this but you want to fight you better believe you got one from the
[1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:40.560]  front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:49.280]  mtg is on fire as usual a really powerful woman a powerful mother a powerful member of congress
[1:33:49.280 --> 1:33:54.000]  that scares the entire corrupt political system and i'm telling her i got a hundred topics to
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:58.400]  cover but i said where do you want to go next and she's got a lot of inside baseball on congress
[1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:03.200]  and roll calling votes and also i asked her hey i'm hearing everybody's really excited 30 members
[1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:09.440]  of congress are not running again democrats you said oh that's not the good news you think it is
[1:34:09.440 --> 1:34:15.280]  so she'll tell you about that as well take it away yeah so alex here's the thing you know we're
[1:34:15.280 --> 1:34:20.560]  hearing about all these people retiring and we're hearing about 30 democrats retiring but the real
[1:34:20.560 --> 1:34:26.320]  question is who's coming in behind them if they're retiring from their seat a lot of those seats are
[1:34:26.320 --> 1:34:32.160]  democrat districts they're not necessarily being flipped to a republican so what kind of democrat
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:37.360]  will take their place and i'm afraid it could be the wrong kind that just means the progressives
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:41.600]  will get stronger and the squad will build so and you're not just saying that i've seen the numbers
[1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:47.200]  they're pushing a lot of moderate democrats in almost everywhere and like actual communist aoc
[1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:53.120]  america haters are getting in yeah no that's what they want because they're so extreme they're so
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:58.400]  radical and they definitely want to build the democrat caucus that way they want the entire
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:04.080]  democrat conference to be progressive that's what aoc is trying to do she's pushing her power
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:08.800]  but here's something that a lot of people don't understand about congress so most of the bills
[1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:15.040]  that get passed are passed by voice vote that is until this year and you know everyone remembers
[1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:19.840]  the story of me being kicked off committees not that big of a deal because democrats are in control
[1:35:19.840 --> 1:35:24.080]  and republicans can't really do much on committees anyways when the democrats control the house and
[1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:29.920]  that was a badge of honor absolutely because that means you know what that means the swamp knew
[1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:35.040]  exactly who i am they knew that i wasn't gonna hand over my they didn't want you looking at the
[1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:39.440]  legislation sorry go ahead well they didn't want me they didn't they knew they know i'm going to
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:44.160]  stand my ground i'm not going to say oh i'll do whatever you want me to do i'll vote however you
[1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:49.600]  want me to vote i'm willing to go along they know that i was there for a reason to actually do what
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:55.280]  i told my district my voters i would do and so when i lost my committees i started sitting on the
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:35:59.040]  house floor and i don't know if you've ever heard this story but i started sitting on the house floor
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:04.560]  and what i wanted to do is learn the process and so i started watching them debate the bills back
[1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:10.640]  and forth and they would the person in the chair that was supposed to be speaker polosi she would
[1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:16.640]  or he whoever it was with a mask on i had no idea but it usually wasn't nancy they would ask for
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:21.920]  the voice votes and so after they debated the bill the democrats would say yay and then the
[1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:27.360]  republicans on our side would say nay and then the person sitting there in this in the speakers
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:34.000]  here with the gavel would say the bill passed and like 10 members of congress would have voted
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:39.200]  saying yes or no well i'm not kidding you and so what i started doing is i started using floor
[1:36:39.200 --> 1:36:45.200]  procedure and i started asking for roll call votes so they would debate the bill back and forth
[1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:51.360]  and then this person in the chair you know speaker mask face or whoever it is would ask for the voice
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:57.520]  votes and before the bill would pass i would say madam speaker i asked for the recorded vote
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:02.240]  well that means that all members of congress had to come in and actually vote you see we have a
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:07.280]  voting card and we're supposed to use it it's supposed to be an electronic vote and it should
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:13.040]  record all of our votes whether it's yes or no and so i would put my we all are supposed to put
[1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:18.720]  our card in there push yes no or present i don't even know why there's present but either yes or no
[1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:24.000]  and i've been doing this since february the house freedom caucus joined in with me
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:30.560]  and at this time alex we have over 500 bills that are on record that you can actually look up any
[1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:35.280]  member of congress you can look up their vote and even see did they even show up for work that day
[1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:39.040]  did they actually vote did they vote yes did they vote no you're saying is they're doing it
[1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:43.920]  not just to manipulate the votes but to hide the record that is exactly what i'm telling you so
[1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:50.480]  they all love to vote uh by voice because then you don't know how we vote and i noticed crenshaw
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:55.200]  who is uh one of your main targets and i agree with you he's a very disingenuous individual
[1:37:55.200 --> 1:37:58.880]  overall in a day was group graduate of claus Schwab unless he wants to come on the show and
[1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:04.480]  challenge that he's on their website he got up a few weeks ago when he was endorsing this new
[1:38:04.480 --> 1:38:13.120]  candidate uh and he said don't listen to the freedom caucus they're lying they don't really
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:18.720]  vote conservative i do and people went in fact check team and it wasn't true so that blew up
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:23.920]  in his face so he's i guess really pissed there's a record that you have such an amazing record
[1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:29.600]  and so many others do that's right and it's because i was willing to ask for recorded votes
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:34.800]  starting back in february and then by the end of march freedom caucus had joined me and we
[1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:40.000]  have a floor schedule and we've kept the schedule so that every time congress is in session every
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:46.080]  time we're voting we are calling for recorded votes and so that no one can no one can slip away
[1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:50.560]  we and we should be held accountable that's that's and i wasn't aware of you doing that i wasn't
[1:38:50.560 --> 1:38:55.360]  aware it enraged them a year or so ago they kind of shut up those they don't want too much attention
[1:38:55.360 --> 1:39:01.280]  on this yeah that's right well so this is why talk about a watchdog folks and you you never
[1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:05.280]  bring this up but even though you won with a record level in georgia they're coming after
[1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:09.520]  you they got packs after you they're running scams we need you to win with a record level or they
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:13.760]  could remove you from congress when you're such an important person there how do people
[1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:20.080]  donate to mtg well i really appreciate you asking that so it's so important i'm only supported by
[1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:27.840]  regular people i don't take money from lobbyists or packs mtgforamerica.com mtgforamerica.com
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:32.640]  it's your five dollar donations twenty five dollars maybe even a hundred dollars that's
[1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:38.960]  what is what helps me get reelected and just if you help me out i'm so grateful and it'll send
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:43.520]  me back to congress so i can keep putting congress on record well absolutely i mean i
[1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:47.200]  listeners get this my listeners are awesome and i have all these great people on that i support
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:52.400]  but you particularly it takes money to win wars yes it does and and if we had the money that
[1:39:52.400 --> 1:39:57.280]  george soros and the globalist did we'd have no problem we don't we have pockets of resistance
[1:39:57.280 --> 1:40:02.000]  but because freedom is so popular we're able to still hold them back and have victory despite
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:06.960]  that but it's so close the margins of victory for your family and your future are so close
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:11.360]  no matter where you live in the united states you need to donate right now to marjorie taylor
[1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:16.800]  greens reelection campaign there isn't a better champion who isn't afraid of the censors who
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:21.600]  isn't afraid of the demonization who who who they wanted expelled from congress who they
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:27.600]  want arrested for not wearing a mask i mean you know a person by their enemies and the enemy
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:33.920]  of me and my family absolutely goes into a red rage over you that makes me love you even more
[1:40:33.920 --> 1:40:40.240]  oh thank you so much no it's true i mean that's the same enemies absolutely we do well you know
[1:40:40.240 --> 1:40:45.280]  it's the elites in washington and it's really those that serve the global economy that's
[1:40:45.280 --> 1:40:50.080]  that's the biggest problem you know that alex those that really don't care they claim they care
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:55.280]  about our country but they've sold us out oh they talk about america first versus the globalist
[1:40:55.280 --> 1:40:59.520]  well what it is you know and i think i think the american people know it the american people
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:04.240]  are so smart and they they know exactly what's going on i think that's why there's so many
[1:41:04.240 --> 1:41:08.880]  people in our country that don't engage and don't vote and we need them to engage and we need them
[1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:14.640]  to vote and that's why primaries are so important but the difference is is so many people in
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:20.800]  washington you know it's the most powerful place on earth richest city on earth yes it is and it's
[1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:25.600]  a dangerous place and people get sold out and isn't crazy it's the richest place on earth and the
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:30.240]  most dangerous it is the most dangerous well it's a dangerous place because it steals people's
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:35.120]  souls you know i think so many people go there with good intentions but there's such great
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:40.640]  temptations in washington and it's easy to get sucked in and before they know it and before
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:46.080]  they realize it next thing you know they're actually voting and they're actually investing and they're
[1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:52.000]  actually making deals to serve countries like china and not america and that's what's happened
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:56.080]  it's really sad i totally agree when we come back we'll hit whatever topics you want but
[1:41:56.080 --> 1:41:59.360]  what do you make of bill mar even coming out and saying the left is evil the left supports
[1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:04.000]  communist china what do you even make of him saying censorship is wrong it seems like even
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:09.200]  a lot of people that have been leftist get now that it's an authoritarian movement well i think
[1:42:09.200 --> 1:42:13.760]  it's interesting hearing him say that and and i don't know him at all so i'm not sure but i hope
[1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:19.600]  he's being sincere in what he's saying you know it's really the thing the what upsets me alex i'll
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:24.800]  tell you this when i got kicked off in my personal twitter account i still have my congressional
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:30.080]  account but i'm limited on what i can say there i can't campaign for myself i can't fight certain
[1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:36.160]  fights i can't ask for money but this is what upset me alex so many of my republican colleagues
[1:42:36.160 --> 1:42:40.400]  stayed silent that's right and the republicans are the ones constantly saying that they're
[1:42:40.400 --> 1:42:44.160]  going to fight big tech and they're going to hold them accountable and they're going to stop
[1:42:44.160 --> 1:42:48.800]  censorship and protect free speech but it's republicans are the ones that are failed and i
[1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:53.840]  would let's talk about that we got to go to break hard break but you can find her on getter at mtg

[1:44:20.480 --> 1:44:26.480]  and target any academics that look into say the anglo-american establishment the founder of the
[1:44:26.480 --> 1:44:30.480]  builder bird group the trilateral commission of the united nations the whole project of the roth
[1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:36.400]  shawls and the rock folks until 10 years ago the media said the control corporate media the builder
[1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:42.080]  bird group didn't exist well now the builder bird group is public and its former head still in the
[1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:48.560]  steering committee is claus Schwab and he has set up the great reset in global government and give as
[1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:53.600]  a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the globalist head on about the second figure worldwide
[1:44:53.600 --> 1:44:58.000]  authoritarian corporate takeover we don't have a shot you expose them we can beat them easily
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.400]  mike in california thanks for calling i think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain
[1:45:02.400 --> 1:45:07.920]  of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation the u.s. government
[1:45:07.920 --> 1:45:14.240]  gain of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research
[1:45:14.240 --> 1:45:20.000]  involving influenza mers and stars viruses does nothing about stars like viruses and if the research
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:24.960]  funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's when you come to a four-way intersection
[1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:29.680]  there's the stop sign you stop you look both ways and then you proceed and so it's also it doesn't
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:34.720]  pause all gain of function just selected gain of function but they'll argue that this is actually
[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:40.240]  characterization and qualification research so you know rand and others you know maybe fouchy was
[1:45:40.240 --> 1:45:43.600]  right they don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function you know that's
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:47.680]  why he didn't perjure himself that's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating
[1:45:47.680 --> 1:45:52.320]  new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition it's still
[1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:56.800]  a gain of function you're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people thank you
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:02.800]  mike we love you sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's

[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:18.080]  mtg m studio
[1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:29.680]  just to get into the truckers in canada and what's happening with the truckers now traveling
[1:47:29.680 --> 1:47:36.880]  across the united states to dc and the feds are talking about putting up barriers and fences around
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:43.440]  the capital again so much going on so marjorie taylor green what is your view on canada and
[1:47:43.440 --> 1:47:48.880]  the great reset and everything well i think i think it's something to really be scared of
[1:47:48.880 --> 1:47:54.080]  this is the country that's just north of us we share the border the northern border and here
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:59.600]  we're seeing justin trudeau the prime minister of canada act just like his father he's turned into a
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:05.920]  dictator and i think that should terrify every single american but what is so disturbing to me alex
[1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:12.560]  is the truckers these are the very people that provide food because they they drive they they
[1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:20.080]  deliver all the supplies critical supplies medicine clothes you know people's food everything that we
[1:48:20.080 --> 1:48:24.640]  need to survive comes from truckers doing their hard jobs and it's the truckers were the ones
[1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:30.240]  that were so willing to stand up against the tyranny in canada with these vaccine mandates
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:35.360]  but yet we're seeing justin trudeau turn into a dictator declare martial law and go to shut
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:40.240]  these people down arresting them throwing them in jail but this is why it's terrifying the the
[1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:45.760]  democrat party would love to do the same thing they would love to do the same thing to americans
[1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:50.880]  and now we have this bigger big truckers convoy go into washington dc and what's the first bit
[1:48:50.880 --> 1:48:56.080]  of news that came out of washington the fence is going back up because now they're trying to make
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:49:01.520]  the image that the fence needs to be there because truckers are so dangerous and that's the biggest
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:06.400]  lie and that's the biggest bunch of propaganda that washington wants to sell to the american people
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:13.920]  truckers aren't dangerous democrats are they've tried to claim that you and i had never talked
[1:49:13.920 --> 1:49:18.240]  until you came on the show a few weeks ago and i saw you say some nice things about me on the
[1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:23.600]  on the show a tv show it's like we called got you on and and and we're very glad you came on but
[1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:28.160]  they've had thousands when i say thousands that's conservative of articles claiming
[1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:34.400]  you and i and trump plan that violence that there's a conspiracy that you need to be expelled from
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:39.680]  congress i had to be arrested that's all a giant lie you want to respond to that yeah it is a it
[1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:45.200]  is a giant lie because here's the truth those are the people that we should be holding accountable
[1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:50.160]  the ones telling those lies it's that the news media that wants to sell the propaganda and
[1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:56.400]  say terrible things about you alex say terrible things about me calling us names um you know and
[1:49:56.400 --> 1:50:02.400]  and selling these these lies to the american people but it's really the federal government that is so
[1:50:02.400 --> 1:50:08.400]  out of control and hurting our country enslaving americans and 30 trillion dollars in debt trying
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:14.400]  to tell us that our children need to be brainwashed with crt taught to be racist that our kids need
[1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:20.480]  to be told that they can choose their gender and that grown men can go in our in our children's
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:27.920]  cabins and showers at camp i mean it's just it's outrageous so what is your synopsis you're great
[1:50:27.920 --> 1:50:32.640]  at boiling things down we've looked at every angle what really happened on january 6 i see a million
[1:50:32.640 --> 1:50:37.840]  people showed up they had some levy's provocateurs the capital police basically stood down they open
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:44.320]  the doors and now almost a thousand innocent people have been charged with stuff i mean this is and
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:49.120]  now they're calling every day january 6 they're calling the truckers january 6 they're saying
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:54.640]  arrest everyone where do you see the skillings it seems like democrats are betting everything on
[1:50:54.640 --> 1:51:00.320]  january 6 of course they're betting everything on january 6 that's all they have no actually i
[1:51:00.880 --> 1:51:06.400]  here's you know what's every day every day should be the riots of 2020 that should be every day
[1:51:06.400 --> 1:51:10.960]  that's when the democrats showed us who they are and isn't it funny now that biden is in office
[1:51:10.960 --> 1:51:17.120]  there are no more riots but has anything changed has police violence changed no crime has gone up
[1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:22.000]  have black lives stopped being murdered or black lives stopped being killed no they're being killed
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:26.560]  every single weekend in chicago the numbers are up oh yeah the numbers are much higher as a matter
[1:51:26.560 --> 1:51:32.080]  of fact it's so much worse but the the reality is every single day is we should be looking at who
[1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:37.200]  justin trudeau is we should be looking at who the democrats are never forget kamala harris
[1:51:37.200 --> 1:51:44.640]  ilhan omar funding blm sending out these links with the minnesota freedom fund to bail out violent
[1:51:44.640 --> 1:51:51.520]  rioters who were burning us uh businesses rioting in the streets against innocent americans that
[1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:56.240]  wasn't the capital those were american cities and it went on night after night but the democrats
[1:51:56.240 --> 1:52:01.760]  have shown us who they are and that should be what our focus every single day not january 6 you
[1:52:01.760 --> 1:52:07.440]  know what happened on january 6 alex there was a lot of beautiful people that had a wonderful time
[1:52:07.440 --> 1:52:12.320]  there and they never want to talk about that they only want to show the small amount of rioting that
[1:52:12.320 --> 1:52:16.480]  happened they don't want to talk about ashleigh babbit being shot they don't want to talk about
[1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:21.520]  the other woman that was trampled in the tunnel that you know i've seen the video of what it's
[1:52:21.520 --> 1:52:25.600]  horrible they like grab her back and kill her and beat her brains out and you know that's the thing
[1:52:25.600 --> 1:52:31.680]  we have a million people there and then a very small group go in most of them waved in by police
[1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:38.160]  when you have a lakers game and they went to championship you don't blame the 30 40 000 fans
[1:52:38.160 --> 1:52:43.200]  that showed up for the thousand people that rioted but that's what they did here yeah of course well
[1:52:43.200 --> 1:52:47.040]  here's what they should be doing they should be talking about ray epps we should be talking about
[1:52:47.040 --> 1:52:52.160]  the people that were encouraging regular americans to go into the capital you know most of people
[1:52:52.160 --> 1:52:56.640]  that were there that day that was their first time at the capital wow they didn't know that there was
[1:52:56.640 --> 1:53:02.080]  a certain line they weren't supposed to cross they had no idea that they were supposed to stay behind
[1:53:02.080 --> 1:53:07.200]  the barrier because ray epps and others had torn them down before they had even gotten there when
[1:53:07.200 --> 1:53:13.280]  they had left the ellipse and walked down to the capital so yeah people got charged that day for
[1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:17.280]  for fighting and different things but they've been charged but they should they shouldn't be
[1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:22.640]  rotting away in jail that shouldn't be happening but the real question is why did police just open
[1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:28.080]  the doors and tell them they could go in were there fbi agents or or different informants or
[1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:33.840]  people working with the fbi involved in what happened on january 6 because that's the truth
[1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:38.400]  that we should be talking about and my biggest question every single time alex is what happened
[1:53:38.400 --> 1:53:44.160]  to nancy polosi and why did she not have the national guard there why did was right trump
[1:53:44.160 --> 1:53:49.120]  tried to get him and they blocked him he asked repeatedly and they blocked him and i was you
[1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:53.600]  know i don't believe that's on record they call that a conspiracy theory that's on record oh absolutely
[1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:58.720]  it's on record they want to lie and say it's a conspiracy theory but it's not you know it bothers
[1:53:58.720 --> 1:54:04.320]  me i was a brand new freshman member of congress i'd only been there a couple of days you know they
[1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:08.800]  nancy polosi put all of our lives in danger because she refused to have the national guard
[1:54:09.360 --> 1:54:13.200]  she it's it's as if they obviously got a million people coming you should do that
[1:54:13.200 --> 1:54:19.200]  but yeah well president trump asked but they had intel they knew that there was possibly
[1:54:19.200 --> 1:54:24.320]  going to be violence that day so if nancy polosi cares about the capital like she claims
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:28.880]  she calls it a temple why didn't she have the national guard there i totally agree so what do
[1:54:28.880 --> 1:54:33.760]  you think the deep state the corrupt system that is out of gas collapsing everybody's turning
[1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:40.080]  against it what do they do now to grab victory from the jaws of defeat that's my concern start
[1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:44.720]  a war with russia what do they do i don't know it's hard for me to even fathom starting a war
[1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:49.120]  with russia i i don't even think that way so it's hard for me to understand look at her reviewing
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:54.640]  her troops right here oh yeah of course well that's all for the camera she's got to stand out there and
[1:54:54.640 --> 1:55:00.720]  and talk to them and act like she actually cares but nancy polosi doesn't care it's such a it's just
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:05.200]  a big charade and there she stands with her mask but i guarantee you as soon as the cameras went away
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:13.360]  she took it off while oh absolutely so with 261 days the midterms what is mtg's prediction what's
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:18.240]  your gut level feeling right now i think we're going to take back the house but to me it's very
[1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:22.960]  important how we take back the house i don't want to take back the house with a republican conference
[1:55:22.960 --> 1:55:27.440]  that's just going to continue to do the same thing they always do and that's just work across the aisle
[1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:32.880]  with the democrats i'm fighting inside my gop conference and i have no problem with it to me
[1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:37.760]  you know they talk about the civil war in the gop well i fully embrace it because i believe that iron
[1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:42.640]  sharpens iron and we need to be the gop conference that actually does something for a change instead
[1:55:42.640 --> 1:55:47.920]  of talking about it on fox news you see i think republicans have a job to do and that is to become
[1:55:47.920 --> 1:55:52.960]  the american party we need to be the american party i agree not left to right the american party
[1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:58.640]  yes the american party and i'm working on something with my staff i can't talk a whole lot about it
[1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:03.920]  but it's called the american revival and it's the plan that i think that all of us need to embrace
[1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:09.600]  it's the plan that i think we need to bring our country back to save our country and to revive
[1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:16.080]  america not just in our economy not just our border but so much about who we are as a people
[1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:20.320]  exactly if we don't know who we are we can be enslaved if we know who we are in our mission
[1:56:20.320 --> 1:56:27.920]  we cannot be enslaved we cannot be defeated american revival with mtg at mtgforamerica.com
