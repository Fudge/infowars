[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]  I have been on air for 27 years and I have never been this freaked out. I have
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.200]  never been this upset and quite frankly I've never been this scared and I'm
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:23.840]  scared because I fear God and if I don't do something about this something
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.320]  dramatic and if you don't do something serious about this we are aiding and
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.720]  abetting it.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.800]  InfoWars the most banned network in the world. I'm gonna lay out the most
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.400]  horrifying information we've ever broken down that is all in plain view and it is
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.400]  staggering and this is only a small snapshot of what's currently happening
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:11.740]  because everything's out in the open now. The whole UN COVID-19 lockstep great
[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:19.000]  reset rollout is now confirmed to be the cover for the beta testing of mass
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.480]  euthanasia, the killing of the old, the handicap, the quote learning disability
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.760]  people of the planet and it's being done because in the West you have a
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.080]  massive aging population from Japan to the United States and the big banks JP
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.600]  Morgan Goldman Sachs others have said they want to legalize basically state
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.440]  sponsored murder of the old. Now under Hitler and under Lenin and under Stalin
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.320]  this all started with the old and the mentally retarded first.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.540]  And then it moved on everyone else so we know exactly where this is going but
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.360]  it's now confirmed that the mRNA so-called vaccine is a strategic kill
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.880]  weapon. A soft kill weapon that takes months or years to kill most people but
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.760]  in many cases kills people within minutes hours or days and I'm going to
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.480]  show you all this from the federal government's own reporting system. They
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.840]  talk about deaths in clusters whether it's in Sweden or Germany or the UK or
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.320]  the US or Canada or Australia because it's only certain hospitals and nursing
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.280]  homes that report that they give 200 patients or a hundred nursing home
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.960]  people or 50 nursing home people and two or three or four or five or ten die per
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.160]  nursing home. I've got all the numbers right here I'm gonna show you from the
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.320]  vaccine adverse reaction center set up in 1986 by Ronald Reagan what's happening
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.800]  so the magnitude of this is just over the top so let me just do this let me
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.640]  read you a few headlines I'm gonna drill into these on this emergency Saturday
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.440]  broadcast India says Pfizer COVID vaccine not recommended for emergency
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.120]  use at this stage they say at this stage we're not gonna authorize its use in
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.240]  India they've banned its use the main global vaccine the first one the UK
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.160]  authorized a few months ago the first one the US authorized they've banned it
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.800]  notice they say for emergency use there was no animal testing and basically no
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.520]  human testing and and India looked at the so-called testing by Pfizer in
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.400]  Europe and the US and said you didn't do real testing and they cite the head of
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.840]  the EU Advisory Commission Wolfgang Ludarg and his associate who's also a
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.880]  scientist the former chief scientist at Pfizer saying this is not a vaccine and
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.200]  it's got a whole human genome in it and an entire jellyfish genome and they
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.320]  won't explain what that's for that's why they skip the trials it'll turn your
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:09.080]  immune system off it'll turn your immune system on it can sterilize you it
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.120]  attacks the placenta so the baby lives attached to the uterus the feeding
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.480]  system and it will settle out this protein it creates its antiviral in the
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.080]  cells and when those cells divide or die give you a horrible autoimmune response
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.200]  or a cytokine storm now I did that report a few months ago back in December
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.640]  off of their emergency report with top scientists warning it'll sterilize women
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.400]  and kill a lot of people the UK government came out two weeks into their
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.880]  operations a month and a half ago and said whoa whoa if you're here's the
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.800]  three groups that shouldn't take this above 75 under 16 or pregnant now you
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.480]  see all these medical doctors that are women that are pregnant taking it and
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.040]  having miscarriages but they say it's okay I did it for the team very sick so
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:03.000]  that's the first article India is not letting them declare an emergency and
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.280]  they've said no to the main vaccine here's another one Al Jazeera COVID-19
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.800]  India says entire population may not need vaccinating and just says they're
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:21.120]  abandoning the program let's continue Merck three weeks ago arguably the
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.040]  largest pharmaceutical company in the world it's definitely the top three said
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.620]  we're abandoning the vaccine program this is a cold virus you cannot create a
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.760]  vaccine for it there are thousands of mutations and Bill Gates responded by
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.440]  saying we'll have thousands of vaccines and you'll never reopen see that's what
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.000]  I told you last year I told you a year ago this is perfect because you can't
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.320]  ever fix the problem and our archivist has gone and dug all these different
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.080]  clips out tomorrow my Sunday show I'm gonna be playing some of these for you
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.160]  just so you see we're not making this stuff up we've got their number and now
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.160]  it's all confirmed we predicted all this perfectly because we know the enemy we
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.080]  have a lot of their own white papers and now they're admitting it okay let's move
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.480]  on to this gigantic article out of the Epoch or epic times and it links
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:14.840]  directly to the Federal Registry directly the Federal Registry of these
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.800]  clusters in Kentucky and Arkansas and other areas where you'll have one
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.860]  nursing home with a hundred people or two hundred people or fifty people they
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.560]  list them here and you'll have five died six died eight died ten died they had
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.520]  twenty-something people in one Swedish nursing home died same things happen
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.040]  in other other countries and and again these are I see these every day they
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.160]  estimate that one in fifty to one in a hundred adverse reactions gets reported
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.880]  because every country has these systems but now they're being ignored so let's
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.680]  say it's one in ten so that's thousands not hundreds dying in the US from COVID
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.920]  vaccines and they admit on the insert it can kill you but major newspapers like
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.640]  the Register reported that last week they changed their headline and removed
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.280]  that so go read this article for yourself it breaks it all down
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.080]  Infowars also did a boil down of its seniors who already beat COVID-19 are
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.960]  dying after taking the vaccine and they're testing positive for COVID after
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.800]  they've had the vaccine because it's all BS ladies and gentlemen this is a
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:29.000]  societal collapse system just like murder up 30% general crime up 50% the
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.640]  borders collapsing the third world starving to death giant migrant waves
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.240]  rushing Europe in the US they've been totally collapsed under the COVID
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.320]  lockdown planetary depression with the big banks ready to take us under their
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:47.960]  control global passports to travel domestic passports to travel forced
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.880]  inoculation to have a job or be able to fly on an airplane it's not coming it's
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:58.280]  being announced told you a year ago that was their plan because I read Operation
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:04.200]  Lockstep by February we knew the whole plan and they had event 201 months
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:10.020]  before that 14 months ago look up event 201 look up this stuff for yourself you
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.520]  owe it to yourself to find out how real this is now if you think that's
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:21.320]  incredible that India has suspended the vaccine program that Merck has suspended
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.160]  their two vaccines that oh I forgot Australia pulled their vaccines was
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:32.240]  making people sick killing them and giving them false positives for HIV if
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:43.440]  you think that's crazy get ready for this this is the London Guardian the big
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.960]  liberal respected paper the biggest in the UK probably the biggest in Europe
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.920]  they admit that they are not giving medical treatment to anyone with a
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:03.200]  learning disability that goes from anyone with Down syndrome that's a
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:10.240]  chromosomal disorder it's a mutation all the way up to someone with
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:19.480]  Asperger's you're not given medical treatment that's eugenics and I've seen
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:24.320]  Dutch TV programs years ago come out and talk to a very high functioning very
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:30.480]  high IQ for a Down syndrome man and they say you cost three four times society
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.720]  when what a normal person does he says I apologize and they laughed at him they
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.120]  laugh at him Dutch TV laughs at him this is eugenics and it's all the left
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.920]  doing this and you talk to the average leftist they'll be like well there are
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.480]  too many people well we can't take care of all the old well we can't do all this
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.640]  and Bill Gates famously gets up at these TED talks and other talks and says well
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.400]  if we kill an old lady and don't give her that last year of care we can hire
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.480]  ten teachers the idea that if you kill somebody and don't spend money on them
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.880]  that then you get ten teachers as if it's a zero-sum game it's a non-zero-sum
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.120]  game the pie is exponential the West and Christianity is about treating people
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:16.120]  good and building things and actually having a social welfare net and then
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.240]  that creates incredible wealth because you have a complex economy
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.400]  authoritarianism is a one-crop economy and as a consolidation but again the
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.760]  very people telling you America's racist and the flags bad and and Mark Cuban
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.080]  saying don't have the national anthem they're the ones bringing in global
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.400]  government and and true death camps in China for Muslims Christians and Buddhists
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.640]  they're the ones literally exploiting Africans they're the ones the UN doing
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.600]  all of this but the cover is how woke they are and how politically correct
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.480]  they are but really they're eugenicists carrying out a global depopulation
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.600]  program and here's a few clips of Bill Gates telling people let's kill that old
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.360]  lady and hire ten teachers and then I'll show you Bill Gates at TED talk with an
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.800]  equation saying reduce humans down to zero to save the earth and now they
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.680]  officially admit that's the plan and Bill Gates on with Fareed Zakaria on
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.280]  CNN if reads ago we're not get over for a long time people shouldn't and Bill
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.360]  Gates gets so happy about that because he's doubled his wealth during this
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.160]  collapse and so the access that used to be available to the middle class or
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.920]  whatever is just rapidly going away that's a trade-off society is making
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:34.360]  because of very very high medical costs and a lack of willingness to say you
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.800]  know is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:44.840]  patient would it be better not to lay off the those ten teachers and to make
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.920]  that trade-off in medical costs but that's called the death panel and you're
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.880]  not supposed to have that discussion so you of course that's an interesting
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.520]  thing you just said would you just the last three months in life for one
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.400]  person something because we haven't had a discussion of how to allocate that
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.720]  money it means we lay off three teachers to do so I mean in other words we have
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.400]  to have this type of allocation we're making that trade-off because of huge
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.720]  medical costs that are not examined to see which ones actually have no benefit
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:23.040]  whatsoever and because of pension generosity we will be laying off over a
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.240]  hundred thousand teachers which you know I'm very much against that and the
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.640]  whole AFT will agree with me on that and that's going to be based on the number
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:39.160]  of people the services each person's using on average the energy on average
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:45.040]  for each service and the co2 being put out a per unit of energy so let's look
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.680]  at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero probably one of
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.720]  these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero now that's back from
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:01.040]  high school algebra but let's let's take a look first we've got population now
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.120]  the world today has 6.8 billion people that's headed up to about 9 billion now
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:12.040]  if we do a really great job on new vaccines healthcare reproductive health
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.840]  services we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent so you've you've
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.960]  written both in your in your paper that's on your on gates notes which I
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.480]  really recommend people read and you've said elsewhere the economy is not going
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.720]  to be anything like it was it's going to take a long time to recover it's going
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.400]  to be you know people are going to be surprised at how slow and how how fitful
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:39.760]  this is now I want something to run through your mind for a second as a
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.400]  viewer of info wars as the few the proud the brave the informed and I'm not
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:51.520]  kissing your ass from the bottom of my heart from the very pit of my gut from
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:14:00.040]  the very focus of my consciousness from my third eye from my very soul you are
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.800]  the only people that care about this and you are the Genesis point the seed the
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.840]  germination point to defeat this and if you don't get excited about this we have
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:16.080]  no future and you are excited you're just like I am you care and you feel
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.960]  this and you know it you intellectually have researched it and you want to fight
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.120]  for humanity and for real justice and you know the authoritarians are posing
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.360]  as people that really want social justice because they're the ones that
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:35.160]  want enslavement so if you don't spread the word if you don't share this
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:40.680]  information nobody will and I want to talk to Twitter and Jack Dorsey who does
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:46.160]  not look as satanic as Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates you may still have some
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.520]  humanity in you I don't know I know behind the scenes you told some very
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.680]  famous people you liked me and listen to the show I was told that years ago didn't
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.880]  believe it I was told about very other prominent people one of them even I'm
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.520]  just gonna leave it at that show me proof of it what the hell is going on
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.120]  with you what is going on with your employees I mean there are death camps
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.880]  millions and millions of people in them that work for Apple are you really with
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:19.080]  Tim Cook but I'm not just talking to the head of Twitter I'm talking to all these
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.960]  censors and all these control freaks who are pretending that you're part of the
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.320]  winning team you understand the London Guardian is reporting what I had members
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:35.320]  of Parliament on years ago that half the kids the little boys that they're saying
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.880]  or transgender are autistic and the school convinces them to be chemically
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.000]  castrated and it's population control and the schools admit that's the program
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.360]  they just make it fashionable to sterilize boys that's what it is but
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:55.200]  they just changed the subject and now and now I remember having the members of
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.040]  Parliament years ago about how they would not give medical care to down
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.240]  syndrome people and then now they've moved on well okay we can kill them
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:08.120]  they've got an extra chromosome let's go after people that have Asperger's and so
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.200]  they say if you can't fill out the forms you don't get treatment oh and if you
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.760]  need to be resuscitated they don't resuscitate you so let me play a clip of
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.280]  how this works Governor Northam of Virginia used to run a hospital that did
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:28.000]  baby organ harvesting that's on record and he famously a few years ago was can
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.960]  was on local radio convincing people that oh we don't want police or courts
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:39.840]  involved it's between a mother and the doctors a bioethics board at least two
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.840]  the infant would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable the infant
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.640]  would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired and then a
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.640]  discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mothers and he goes
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.880]  and we make the decision with the mother after the baby's born to resuscitate or
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.960]  not well the baby's breathing resuscitate means start the heart when
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:09.160]  it's not running but they use it in bioethics which is really Nazism the
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.400]  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute which was the Rockefeller Institute in Cold Springs
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.480]  Harbor taught the Germans how to do all this look it up look up IBM in the
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:22.440]  Holocaust these are the technicals folks this is all the facts they call
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:27.400]  resuscitation saying we believe this is a human we've made a decision with the
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.400]  mother who they've got drugged out of her mind and you know just just had a
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.560]  baby a single mother there's no man there's no family there we've made a
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.600]  decision that this baby isn't gonna have a good life that's what bioethics is
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.540]  dr. Peter Singer the real head of PETA you know he said parents able to kill
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:48.720]  their kids up to age 3 you got Ezekiel Emanuel that wrote Obamacare saying we
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.320]  should kill people at 75 you got Newsweek with the case of killing
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:18:00.000]  granny my point is these people are out in the open this is a revolution of evil
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.920]  and this literally came out of the Rockefellers and the British royalty and
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.520]  they literally created Hitler as a test of this and it's all in the history
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.760]  books it's not on Discovery Channel it's not on History Channel but it's in rise
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:18.520]  and fall of Third Reich it's in order of the death said it's in the writings
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:24.240]  that it was in the Nuremberg trial so people ask how did all this was coming
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.680]  because these people after World War two went underground so it's not a Nazi
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:36.840]  conspiracy it's a globalist scientific dictatorship conspiracy and they're
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:42.480]  saying with the doctors and nurses oh you are a Down syndrome person you don't
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.280]  get regular care you have Asperger's you're you're autistic you don't get
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:54.040]  care and they're saying it publicly now ladies and gentlemen if that's
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:03.000]  admittedly going on can you imagine what else is going on I see reports
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]  because I scan the news every hour of another person an 18 year old a 30 year
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.760]  old a 45 year old a 60 year old a 50 year old a 70 year old taking the shot
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:18.000]  having a convulsion and being dead in 15 minutes
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:25.500]  and those doctors are moral and call and report this dude just died most of them don't do that
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:35.820]  because you just saw Governor Northam say we don't resuscitate babies if the mother and we decide
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:41.020]  it's not viable again the baby's breathing it's fine many cases totally healthy
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:47.500]  they mean that they then take the baby away and keep it comfortable it's put in a special wing
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:53.260]  with highly paid nurses and then instead of just getting the organs right on the spot once they
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:20:01.180]  name it as not resuscitated as subhuman once the baby's subhuman they can then say it's dead not
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:06.540]  resuscitated but it's actually alive they keep it comfortable in a wing the orders go out of its
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.540]  orders go out of its blood type china does this too and so people rich people that have kids that
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:18.540]  need organs they put their orders in they get told hey a donor came available it's a baby that died
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:25.100]  the baby's still alive on life support and then they go in when they get enough orders in for the
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:30.380]  lungs the heart the liver the kidneys and they take everything and including for transfusions
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:36.060]  they suck the blood out everything when they're done it is just a shell of itself gutted like a
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:42.540]  deer now does anybody think god likes that okay maybe you don't believe in god does anyone want
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:48.700]  a state and a system doing all this behind the scenes and now passing laws in virginia and new
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:57.580]  york to kill babies after they're born my god i mean is the left really this evil and is the
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:02.460]  general public really this evil where are the churches speaking out where where is anybody
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.180]  because we're so politically correct we won't say anything that offends the left because they're
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:12.700]  the boss and now they're censoring everybody and they work for big mega corporations they're the
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:17.820]  most oppressive evil groups in the world exploiting populations all over the planet and we let them
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:22.940]  dictate to us that they are the moral high ground and they are the left let me show you another
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:28.860]  article i just showed you india banned the vaccine you don't see that on our news australia stopped
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:33.980]  the vaccine pfizer pulled out of the vaccine oh i'm sorry south africa suspended the vaccine and
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:38.700]  said it's killing a bunch of people and it doesn't protect them and they get positive for covid after
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:45.660]  they take it oh there's so many other countries cuomo at the wine house groveling but i predicted
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.980]  this about eight months ago i said they sent people with covid to kill the one group they
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.580]  can kill old people who don't have vitamin d because any virus will kill you if you're
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:59.260]  vitamin d deficient they shit wait now now first it was five thousand then they covered it up as
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.580]  twelve thousand now it's sixteen thousand old people more than half the deaths in new york
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:08.540]  were old people above 85 that got covid or whatever it was they put on the sheet because
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:14.060]  they put sick people in the rooms with them 20 year old homeless 30 year old homeless in the
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:20.620]  same rooms you've seen the video of the homeless beating up the old people they did this as a test
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:26.060]  and then told the families you're not allowed to come see your family whether it was texas or
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:35.100]  whether it was new york every state did what the un and bill gates said oh cdc nih fauci says
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:40.300]  families you might have covid you can't see your mom or dad your aunt or your uncle oh
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:46.300]  and sometimes its parents can't see their child that's been their back broken their neck broken
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:50.060]  and they're in nursing home sorry you can't see if they can't even look through the window
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:56.060]  but we're going to bring people in that have diseases to kill them and then when we kill
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:02.140]  them we're going to cover it up but i predicted last year i said they're going to set cuomo up
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:07.260]  to send shock waves to all other 50 governors including republicans that didn't know what
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.500]  happened they followed the recommendation they sent covid patients into nursing homes to be
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:17.500]  part of the murder and now they're going to show cuomo as an example so that everybody gets scared
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.300]  and gets in line and now gates and the globalists have them see that's how these two evil to fail
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:29.660]  things work i've learned the evil twisted dark logic of these satanists they get us to go along
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:34.460]  with some mass evil some mass corruption like abortion saying these aren't babies and once
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:38.380]  a woman's killed a couple of her babies she's always going to defend it because she can't admit
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:42.460]  she did it and now she'll defend killing an old person or killing a kid that's already born see
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:48.940]  how it works they get you into sin they get you into evil they get you under their control and
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:53.260]  now they've got you right where you want you because you have no rudder you didn't stand up
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:24:01.580]  for a baby metaphysical laws that apply you lose your reap what you sow karmic defense because i
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:06.060]  don't follow the whole hindu idea of karma you know no matter what you do later in another what
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:11.260]  no no it's now it's now it affects you now ladies and gentlemen everybody knows about instant karma
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:17.020]  you've all experienced it and so that's what these dark magicians do is they trick us ladies
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:23.020]  and gentlemen to go along with evil so that literally who we are our energy because these
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.180]  are dark magicians they know what they're doing resonates with them and then they have a bridge
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:32.700]  into our lives they have a control system into our lives when we when we not just metaphysically
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:38.380]  but intellectually buy into what they're doing and what they've established then we're spiritually
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:42.460]  blind and can't oppose them and i'm gonna i'm gonna finish up here and get to the whole impeachment
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:50.300]  news and that incredible stuff that's unfolding but cuomo was set up cuomo is a low-grade moron
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:55.500]  from a very corrupt mafia family his dad was not even that smart he and his brothers are idiots
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:02.380]  but the point is is that he was set up and it shows how the very minions of the system
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:09.820]  are being set up because now the globalist own greg abbott they own whitmer they own wolf they
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:15.900]  own newsome and they'll all be burned they'll all lose their reelection they'll get recalled
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.860]  and then the globalists will laugh because their own minions will be destroyed
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:27.900]  it will create fear in all the other minions that went along with it hoping that it passes them over
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:33.260]  now you see how the enemy tricks you to give up your moral high ground your spiritual high ground
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:40.860]  so they have you all right so moving to the next piece of information oh uk government
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:47.740]  could grant vaccine exemptions to ethnic minorities first that says the government
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:52.140]  has a right to give you exemptions when they don't have a right to put something in your body
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.660]  that's been banned in all these other countries and where bill gates has been kicked out of india
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:03.500]  over and over again and just got kicked out again and then the idea of oh minorities don't want to
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:07.820]  take vaccines because they came from pakistan where the un got caught sterilizing them and
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:12.620]  giving them polio or how about people in africa where they caught the un giving them polio under
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:18.140]  bill gates that's even in reuters that's another subject they call it disinfo like jones gives out
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:24.940]  disinfo with joe rogan that the number one cause of polio is the polio vaccine but they had to
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:31.500]  back down because joe rogan had me on and i showed reuters and the admission that's what's crazy is
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:36.620]  they can't even hide this they're just rolling it out because they want to kill steal and destroy
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:44.300]  it's it's who they are they want to dominate they want to kill it's metaphysical so uk government
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:50.220]  could grant vaccine exemptions to ethnic minority summit dot news is also up on info wars dot com
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.740]  and it goes through their announcements okay if minorities don't trust the government
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:59.660]  because of tuskegee giving black people syphilis and all these other tests then you don't have to
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:09.580]  but white people have to wow oh okay so see how this works folks this is very sick this is very
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:13.980]  evil but the average person's like i'm taking the vaccine i'm a hero you're like hey doesn't it
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.900]  protect you it's got major side effects it's not a normal vaccine it's been banned all these
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.540]  countries shut up you've been banned don't even try that with me meanwhile though it's all in
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:28.860]  the fine print they're admitting it all but on the national news the big official tv shows
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:34.780]  oh no side effects coverage totally safe all the fine print death disease autoimmune everything else
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:42.140]  and it goes on and on and on this is an assault on the family an assault on humans
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:47.180]  an assault on our very genetics and people of every race color and creed who have red blood
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:54.460]  who are one human race are coming together rapper zuby identifies as female to smash
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:58.620]  weightlifting record i've decided i'm entered i'm gonna go introduce myself in the private
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:03.500]  weightlifting groups here and i'm gonna identify as a hundred pound 18 year old female and i'm
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.580]  gonna win all the things and i'm not gonna do this to be mean i'm gonna do it to show the lie that
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.620]  i'm not a woman that i have testosterone that my muscles and bones are twice as strong on average
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:17.020]  i don't have a uterus i can't have a baby we're different and that's our strength and we've got
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:23.020]  other articles here uh where so many other people are are coming out and and pointing this out this
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:29.660]  is an assault on humanity an assault on the regular order of things to confuse us so much
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:35.260]  these crazy mad scientists can have their way with us but i want to just slow down again and
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:43.020]  ask you all to realize if you try to talk about vaccine deaths about vaccine illnesses about how
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:50.139]  this isn't a vaccine robert kennedy jr put out a big report with all these admitted medical reports
[00:28:50.139 --> 00:28:55.660]  and top scientists and copies and screenshots of the insert admitting it can kill you or give
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:03.500]  you guillain-barre or narcolepsy or epilepsy and uh what's the other one bell's palsy luckily that
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.540]  goes away after a while the others don't it can cause type 1 diabetes can eat your pancreas i mean
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:13.660]  it's all there and they just said oh you're banned off everything too and then bill gates
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:22.220]  is heavily invested in micro of microsoft is heavily invested in zuckerberg's company i mean
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:28.940]  it's total conflicts of interest and this is just the establishment rushing us and attacking us and
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.260]  why are they doing it because nationalists are getting elected because populism is exploding
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:37.100]  because people are coming together because the un's in trouble been caught running genocide
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.300]  because trump and bolsonaro got elected boris johnson knew how to roll over he was supposedly
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:48.940]  a patriot now forage admits he was a bad guy he didn't know and so the un 14 months ago back in
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:55.340]  december of 2019 had their own emergency meeting and they admitted that vaccines don't work we're
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.860]  just told what to do by bill gates they're sterilizing people they're killing them our own
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:04.540]  doctors don't believe in it our front lines wobbly and so they come in with a new crisis that can't
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.420]  be fixed with a cold virus that mutates so there's no way to ever have a real vaccine
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.820]  and they tell you oh just take just stay in your house 15 days oh just stay in your house six months
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:18.220]  oh just take the vaccine then then you can go out oh sorry doesn't protect you now you can't go out
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:23.100]  and it's all a lie it's all a fraud it's all designed to suck all of civilization into a
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:29.340]  crisis that has no solution but totally tracking controlling what you do and then under the umbrella
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:35.420]  of all of this they're euthanizing the old they're killing the mentally retarded oh don't
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:40.780]  say retarded we'll ban you for that we're just going to kill them call them mentally disabled
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:45.820]  call them a learning disability no having an extra chromosome isn't a learning disability
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.500]  so see they go i'll be nice to them don't call them a name hurts them just kill them
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:58.139]  and then next it is somebody with a learning disability oh and the next frontier they've
[00:30:58.139 --> 00:31:03.820]  already announced all over the world australia uk it's the models coming here next oh you smoked
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:09.180]  you don't ever get health care oh you ate too much fat with all the new digital systems they can track
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:15.580]  in your social credit score what you've done you pay a tax or you don't get your health care or oh
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.900]  you're politically incorrect the uk is already announcing this you don't like global government
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:25.340]  you voted for brxit you don't get health care that's what this social credit score is that's
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:30.620]  why welling wearing yellow stars isn't a good idea we lock our doors at night not because we
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:34.780]  have something to hide but because there are some bad people out there and that puts a barrier to
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:40.460]  them and giving the power structure total surveillance and total control is always going
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:46.220]  to end up creating a nightmare scenario and now it has and because there's a new currency
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:53.500]  i'll give you truth palm truth palm here of social media of dopamine of getting attention
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:58.060]  of getting clicks of getting likes that in almost no cases makes you any money makes you depressed
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:04.940]  makes you alone people will by increment become total fascist supporters of ggp death camps killing
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:09.500]  old people arresting their political opposition having the pentagon and cia go after trump
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:14.940]  supporters all because they get celebrated and promoted by facebook twitter and youtube
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:22.540]  and that is the road to hell so only you can get this message out to the people only you
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.940]  can turn the tide against this corruption and this evil but if you don't we have no hope and
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:30.860]  it's only going to get worse i'm going to go to break for a moment i'm going to come back and
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.940]  lay out for a few minutes what the world's going to look like in a few years under this plan if
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:39.820]  you don't resist and speak up and say no and ways we can speak up and say no and then i'm going to
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:46.620]  shift gears into the most powerful highlights of the trump team finally putting on a good defense
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:52.620]  on friday i'm alex jones only way this dog hunts is you share the links god bless we'll be right back
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:33:00.919]  i have told you for nine weeks that once they implement this if we cower in fear properly
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:09.879]  and grovel it will then become a permanent emergency by saying we can't let one person die from this virus
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:17.919]  and so until there's no death zero out of seven and a half billion people it's
[00:33:17.919 --> 00:33:20.159]  impossible
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:28.140]  We're going to keep the social distancing and the lockdown in place.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:33.020]  We're going to probably have to cycle this and throttle it and oh, you can't go out here.
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.020]  You can't go out there.
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:37.220]  They're going to have a county by county thing at first and just getting us all trained that
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:41.700]  we can't go out until we're told and that's the way it is to keep us safe from the virus.
[00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:55.570]  Dr. Obama and Dr. Faustus, Fauci, are now the ones telling us the lockdown can never
[00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:56.570]  end.
[00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:02.010]  Remember 15 days to bend the curve and then when it wasn't even one-tenth of what they
[00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:06.330]  said it would be, they went, oh sorry, it's so devastating because it's not even one-tenth
[00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.970]  of what we said, we never reopen.
[00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:15.490]  They just wanted to get you to accept it up front, like a kidnapper does, puts the
[00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:19.290]  gun on you, let me put the handcuffs on you, let me put the gag on you, and then everything
[00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:20.290]  will be all right.
[00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:24.330]  Just put the handcuffs on, put the ball gag in, look, you're getting taken to a basement
[00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.370]  to get tortured and raped, you're going to die.
[00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:32.529]  This is the end of everything.
[00:34:32.529 --> 00:34:33.730]  It's never coming back.
[00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.330]  The prosperity is never coming back.
[00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:40.830]  It's all over and they're going to buy increments.
[00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:44.830]  Put the pressure on you to give up more rights and then they'll
[00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:48.430]  take a little pressure off and then they'll tell you give up
[00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:51.129]  more rights and then pressure will be taken off.
[00:34:51.129 --> 00:34:54.029]  But then always it will be put back on even tighter.
[00:34:54.029 --> 00:34:56.129]  That's the psychology of the stakeover.
[00:34:56.110 --> 00:35:05.910]  And they plan to lock things down again this winter, causing all the flu deaths and regular
[00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:09.670]  deaths from other things, calling it COVID-19, and they're going to try to have another big
[00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.750]  lockdown that will guarantee a mega depression.
[00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:20.770]  First, they tell you 15 days to flatten the curve, leave hospitals open.
[00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.049]  Then it's a month, then it's two months, then it's eight months.
[00:35:23.049 --> 00:35:24.049]  Now we're eight months in.
[00:35:24.049 --> 00:35:30.490]  Then it's, oh, the end of 2021, oh, it's four years, oh, it's ten years.
[00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:31.770]  We'll never come out of this.
[00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:39.390]  If Joe Biden gets in, they're never getting rid of the lockdown.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:45.340]  Think about that.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.980]  It's a lot bigger than just kicking Trump out and flooding everything with fake ballots
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.780]  using the lockdown as the cover for it.
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:56.380]  They want to bankrupt us and then have us have an app to be able to leave our front
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.900]  door and step one foot outside of our house.
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.980]  That is the admitted globalist CHICOM plan.
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.980]  We're being given tracker systems.
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.380]  We're being taught to stay in our houses.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.880]  We're being taught we're not essential.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.420]  We're being marinated in martial law.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:14.660]  That's what we've been in with big tech and the universities and the blue cities and the
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.340]  blue states and the U.N. and the CHICOMs.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.840]  Monkey see, monkey do with this lockdown.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:29.120]  And they're going to make the lockdown and the shutdown of our economy 10 times worse.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:36.040]  And now Biden's announced that all these conservatives are like, well, Alex saw my neighbor yesterday.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:42.080]  He goes, he goes, Alex, he goes, at least.
[00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:48.370]  At least they'll turn the economy back on.
[00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.070]  And I said, no, they're not going to.
[00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:54.670]  I showed him on my phone where Biden's new commission says it'll never
[00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.670]  open ever, ever, ever.
[00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:02.470]  You think these control freaks are ever going to turn loose once
[00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.070]  this dog has you in its jaws.
[00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.970]  Once this great white sharks got you in its mouth, come on.
[00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:11.170]  Oh, Joe Biden wants peace and love and wants us all to heal.
[00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.970]  Everything he says is a lie.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:21.400]  So they're going to hit us with different waves of bio attack over the years, locking
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.600]  us down tighter each time.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.720]  All I do is research this information.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.580]  That's how I'm able to predict what's coming next.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.360]  So let me tell you what's coming next, and I'll cover it more tomorrow on the Sunday
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.560]  show 4 to 6 PM.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.920]  What's coming next is more of the same but intensified.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.360]  Cell phones by law, digital systems in your car tracking.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:47.000]  You face scanning, thumb printing to go into businesses to buy and sell, showing your QR
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.840]  code that you've been vaccinated to have a job, get into a parking garage, go to the
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.980]  grocery store, go to church.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.720]  And then with that, they can add more and more restrictions and more and more demands
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.180]  to what you do.
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:06.840]  And they legitimize the social credit score already perfected in Communist China.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.400]  And then you've got to go to this social engineering class to keep your credit score high.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.240]  You've got to submit and send your children to a certain school that's been recommended
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.160]  by the algorithm.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.880]  It's a nightmare scenario, and we know what they're going to do because the globalists
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.160]  are on record.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.440]  Now here's how you resist it.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:31.799]  You stop engaging in one-dimensional and two-dimensional thought processes, and you study history.
[00:38:31.799 --> 00:38:33.360]  You study how the globalists operate.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.880]  You study the claims we've made here that have been documented.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.640]  And then you realize you're under attack, and the globalists are never going to recognize
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.940]  you begging them to stop.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.880]  You're going to have to stop them.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.440]  And that means you're going to have to run for office.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.680]  You're going to have to educate others.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.620]  You're going to have to be a resistor.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:54.360]  You're going to have to be conscientious objector.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:59.880]  You're going to have to engage in civil disobedience, everything short of offensive violence.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:04.440]  And you're going to have to put pressure on governors like Greg Abbott and pressure on
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.600]  others because the globalists are putting pressure on them with the dirt they have on
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.720]  them to engage in this stuff or they'll hang about to dry.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.240]  We got to let Greg Abbott and all these other globalists know, hey, listen here, buddy boy,
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.000]  you're not keeping the lockdown on forever.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.040]  You're not keeping mask on us forever.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.100]  You're not keeping our schools closed forever.
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:24.080]  You're not going to bring in the social credit score and the Google contact tracers run by
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.840]  the Clinton Foundation on us in the future.
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:31.319]  This whole thing's a giant overblown fraud like Governor DeSantis has been exposing.
[00:39:31.319 --> 00:39:35.960]  But even Governor DeSantis is like, but let's get all the old people vaccinated first.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:41.960]  Hey, DeSantis, here's a Yahoo News headline right out of the UK government advisory board
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:48.920]  says three groups should not take the vaccine above 75 under 16 and pregnant.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:53.420]  So again, stop the virtue signaling and realize the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:40:00.520]  If India can ban the Pfizer vaccine, if South Africa can ban three of the vaccines, if Australia
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.640]  can wake up, my God, it's killing their people.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.360]  The British military two months ago started giving people shots and a bunch of them died
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.720]  that were old and they said, let's stop this.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:14.360]  Oh, but we just have Snopes saying, well, they did die a bunch of them right after they
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.080]  took it, but no, that's not what did it.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.279]  No judge, no jury, no coroner, no nothing.
[00:40:20.279 --> 00:40:25.080]  So you just better realize you're under attack and you better realize that Jones was never
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.080]  paranoid.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.720]  I've been smart.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.160]  I grew up smart.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.560]  I grew up reading a lot of history books and having a lot of family that was involved in
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:36.400]  a lot of things and doing my own research at my own experience on the street.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.759]  I got busy, very, very young learning how the world really worked.
[00:40:39.759 --> 00:40:41.040]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:45.720]  I mean, 12 years old, ladies and gentlemen, I was living the life of 20 year old and I've
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:50.000]  already been around the block at 47 a bunch and I know what's going on.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.040]  So the good news is a lot of people said, well, Jones is right about some stuff, but
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.040]  he goes too far.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.640]  Now people are going, how the hell does he know all this?
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.560]  Because they tell you what they're doing.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.759]  They don't say we're going to sterilize half the boys in the Western world.
[00:41:03.759 --> 00:41:07.480]  They go, oh, we're going to teach them their girls and then convince them it's cool, but
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.240]  first we're going to brain damage them with vaccines and pesticides because boys are more
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:17.319]  susceptible to it and then convince them it's cool and make it trendy to be a slave.
[00:41:17.319 --> 00:41:18.319]  That's how all this works.
[00:41:18.319 --> 00:41:22.799]  So first admit you're under attack, then understand we need legislative leadership at the state
[00:41:22.799 --> 00:41:24.160]  and local level.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.120]  Look at corporate leadership.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:34.160]  Look at the one guy in Naples that Alfie Oaks that started his own three grocery stores
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.359]  is super successful and says, you don't have to wear a mask, it's not even a law.
[00:41:38.359 --> 00:41:40.480]  And suddenly he's got more business than ever.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.200]  That's the first domino to fall.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.359]  Things like that are examples of leadership in your own life.
[00:41:46.359 --> 00:41:48.720]  I go in the grocery store, I don't wear a mask.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.080]  If they come up and talk to me, I educate them.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.680]  Stop being afraid of, oh, I don't want to hurt you.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.680]  I'm dirty.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.680]  I'm wearing this mask.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.880]  It's a lie saying you're dirty.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.880]  They're teaching you that you're bad because you're white or you're bad because you're
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.880]  black.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.880]  There's all this racism.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.319]  Meanwhile, they're teaching you you're dirty and evil.
[00:42:04.319 --> 00:42:07.040]  You've got to wear a thing over your face that doesn't even protect you.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.040]  It's all lies.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.840]  And you've got to realize that psychology and you've got to get aggressive.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:17.240]  You got to get loud and you've got to let Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg and all the
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:24.120]  new world order and Klaus Schwab know that when Klaus Schwab tells us that, oh, anyone
[00:42:24.279 --> 00:42:28.520]  that is in a profession where you are close to people, your profession is over.
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.960]  Humans can never talk to each other again.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.800]  Realize what a cult announcement that is.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.319]  Robots will deliver things to you.
[00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:36.319]  You will own nothing.
[00:42:36.319 --> 00:42:37.319]  You will have nothing.
[00:42:37.319 --> 00:42:43.480]  Think of the magnitude of the evil and how insane that is and reject it and realize you've
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.400]  got to be a leader in your own life.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.400]  You don't have to save the world.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.359]  You don't have to do it all.
[00:42:48.359 --> 00:42:52.279]  But you've got to, at least around everybody you know, not submit to this.
[00:42:52.279 --> 00:42:56.000]  And if enough people do that, this globalist push will fail.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:09.560]  If it doesn't, man, if it doesn't, Katie bar the door because these vaccines are bad enough.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.080]  But they're already saying, oh, we've got all these new ones for new mutations that
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.120]  are going to do all sorts of things.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:19.600]  And they are just normalizing people being sick and dying all around you.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:26.120]  Old people dying, killing down syndrome, children, adults, keeping babies alive and
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.359]  harvesting their organs.
[00:43:27.359 --> 00:43:29.319]  We're already in a nightmare, folks.
[00:43:29.319 --> 00:43:31.200]  It's just thinly veiled.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:36.380]  Now it's coming out in the open because it's getting ready to make its big move.
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.840]  And there's another big thing you can do.

[00:43:44.759 --> 00:43:48.440]  info wars because it takes money to prosecute a war.

[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.359]  Nothing's perfect, but starting with filtering your water for you and your children and your

[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.840]  of chemicals that are out there.

[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.880]  All right.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.359]  I want to shift gears now into the political attack and how they're trying to demonize
[00:45:45.359 --> 00:45:49.380]  the populist movement and trying to punish the American people and trying to make the
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:54.020]  idea of demonstrating illegal with the sham impeachment trial in the US Senate, because
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:58.440]  finally some of the Republicans are fighting back.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:05.279]  Now, I just spent a lot of time covering crimes against humanity, violations of the Geneva
[00:46:05.279 --> 00:46:13.759]  convention, the Nuremberg code, mass extermination with experimental, illegal, deadly, mutagenic
[00:46:13.759 --> 00:46:20.400]  gene therapy systems in a giant experimentation operation.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:26.279]  But I'm about to get into Trump who on this Saturday evening just got acquitted.
[00:46:26.279 --> 00:46:28.060]  They were going to go through most of next week.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.840]  They were going to call all these witnesses.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:34.359]  The Democrats were going to get him, but Friday so annihilated the Democrats and you're about
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:39.200]  to see what happened and their attempted indictment of the American people and showing that they
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:43.800]  said things 20 times worse than Trump, they actually called for physical war and killing
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:50.359]  people and killing Trump and Americans that they then had to come in and acquit him.
[00:46:50.359 --> 00:46:57.420]  So they had three days of BS and the Republicans in three hours destroyed it.
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:00.640]  Those Republicans were going to sell Trump out, but there was so much heat on them.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:08.400]  Those Democrats had to back off because the Republican lawyers finally understood that
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:12.319]  there was a lot of American people angry at them and they better do their job.
[00:47:12.319 --> 00:47:18.540]  So president Trump acquitted, but we're still going to go through the highlights of this
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.880]  because this is an indictment of who they are.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.200]  They said we were terrorists.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.440]  They said we should all be arrested.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:29.319]  We should all be killed, but it shows how just three hours of truth made them put their
[00:47:29.319 --> 00:47:33.560]  tail between their legs and end the rest of the trial.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:39.080]  This will be spun as, oh, well, for some reason they just voted to end the trial because the
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:43.840]  establishment knew that it was making Trump into a victim and the American people into
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:49.800]  a victim and an underdog and really heroes that had been persecuted.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:55.080]  So like I told you, a lot of negative stuff happening, them still in the election, the
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:58.880]  crime rate exploding, the borders wide open, the forced inoculations.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.960]  All this is bad, but if we're steadfast and expose it, it will blow up in their face.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:09.680]  So I'm going to go ahead and lay this out now and break it all down and why it's still
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.540]  incredibly important.
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:17.800]  So there is a major move to demonize president Trump so that the criminal elements of the
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:23.520]  government, the global collaborators can basically use the security services against the American
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.960]  people claiming we're domestic terrorists.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.440]  That is now completely official.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:33.240]  In fact, I recommend the fact that the end of this report will play it, that you watch
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:38.960]  Gregory says the end game is now seven minutes and 20 seconds of them admitting we're going
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:39.960]  to put you in camps.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:40.960]  We're going to kill you.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.960]  We're going to shoot you.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.279]  We're going to have the CIA murder you.
[00:48:43.279 --> 00:48:45.920]  I mean, these people are insane.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:49.200]  If George W. Bush ever said one thing like this, they would have arrested him and they
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.520]  should have, but because it's Democrats, it's supposedly okay.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.160]  So they are just out of control.
[00:48:55.359 --> 00:49:01.400]  Well, at first, uh, the lead lawyer was scared a few days ago and he really threw Trump under
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.640]  the bus, but there was a big backlash.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.400]  See pressure was put on him.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.600]  So suddenly the defense is incredible because they were testing.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:13.800]  If the public didn't get mad, if Trump didn't get mad, Trump's defense is scared of the
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:14.800]  Democrats.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.560]  They were going to sell him out, but because we put pressure on them, which is an example
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.160]  of not laying down.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.480]  Suddenly they did a really, I'd say about a 95% job.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:28.480]  I mean, it was excellent on Friday and I'm going to play you a 20 minute clip and like
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:36.560]  a 30 minute clip of this and you should really watch it because they admit that when they
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:40.680]  would show Democrat senators that called for violence and murder of Trump supporters and
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:44.080]  murder of Trump, they would laugh and giggle and pass notes.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.000]  So they all thought it was funny.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.880]  Like they claimed Trump saying let's fight for America was a call to attack the Capitol.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.040]  But then when they're actually saying, go out and attack people and kill them, that's
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.040]  good.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.000]  And so I've got the transcripts here.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000]  We've got all the videos here.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.840]  I'm just going to show you the actual footage of what the lawyers laid out in his defense.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.640]  Now they're going to have witnesses coming up this week.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:09.920]  It's going to be crazy on both sides, but this is an underdog story where Trump was
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:15.080]  getting destroyed because of no defense the first few days, but on Friday came roaring
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.080]  back.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.440]  Wednesday and Thursday were the prosecution.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:25.000]  I can kind of defend Trump's group now on Friday saying at least they put on three hours
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.240]  of defense, but wait a minute.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:33.319]  If you're in a trial or you're in this thing, why did they give them three days of prosecution
[00:50:33.319 --> 00:50:39.400]  during prime time, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, but then Trump's people only did three hours.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.560]  So they're not even getting equal time.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:45.160]  They rested their case in three hours and notice they were on a Friday when nobody's
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.160]  watching.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:51.040]  And now I was watching today, Democrats are still going on Saturday attacking.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.480]  It's just them.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.160]  That's it.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:57.359]  So that's what they went ahead with this impeachment trial, knowing they had no evidence because
[00:50:57.359 --> 00:50:58.359]  they're just grandstanding.
[00:50:58.359 --> 00:51:03.240]  They want to be reality TV stars and they falsified evidence.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.880]  They have just just done all of this.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.120]  They've been caught lying.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:12.640]  They said Trump supporters on June 1st burned down a church by the, by the White House.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.440]  Everybody knows the Democrats did that.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.160]  They got mad at Trump marching over there and saying it was wrong.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:21.400]  So that was the lead lawyer against Trump saying that.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:28.000]  So here it is the seven most memorable moments from Friday's session of Trump's impeachment
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000]  trial.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.520]  Michael Vander Veen, attorney for former president Trump shows video Democrats, politicians using
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:39.000]  fighting language in the past to make a point that Trump's words before the January 6th
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.440]  Capitol riot were no different.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.440]  They were actually much less.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:46.840]  So we're going to play his presentation first, then we're going to play David Schoen, who
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.279]  also did an excellent job.
[00:51:49.279 --> 00:51:54.359]  And then they have all the admissions here that Senate Dems laughed past notes as Trump
[00:51:54.359 --> 00:51:58.319]  defense team played fight montage.
[00:51:58.319 --> 00:52:01.720]  But then Schoen said to them, it's okay.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.880]  You do anything wrong.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:06.160]  It's a word people, but please stop the hypocrisy.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.520]  So I'm going to go ahead and air these clips back to back.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:14.560]  I know most of you already know this, but other people don't know this.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:18.240]  And by the way, they're suppressing this on Twitter and Facebook, this defense.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:22.960]  They're now even censoring Senate and House hearings on election fraud and on vaccine
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:23.960]  deaths.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:29.180]  So just remember in the real world, India's banned the vaccines in South Africa, Australia.
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:31.380]  You won't hear that here.
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:34.160]  You say that on Facebook, they'll ban your ass.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.359]  You tell people there's deaths happening.
[00:52:35.359 --> 00:52:36.359]  They'll ban your ass.
[00:52:36.359 --> 00:52:38.460]  So remember, that's why band dot video is so important.
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:39.840]  They're murdering people.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.040]  They're coming for us next.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:44.060]  Don't you have that immediacy in your soul?
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.960]  If you're connected to God, you do people again, people ask me, they go, Jones, are
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:48.960]  you on cocaine?
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.520]  Are you on methamphetamine?
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.319]  I had a cup of coffee this morning, folks already worked out.
[00:52:53.319 --> 00:52:56.440]  I have to drink some to try to settle down.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.440]  This is this.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.020]  I mean, I feel like, I mean, let me tell you, I'll be honest with you.
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:04.120]  I'm fighting my shells wanting to go out and defend.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.880]  I mean, I want to go stop folks.
[00:53:06.359 --> 00:53:10.920]  All over the country and the world, no one can see their parents for a year inside nursing
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:15.160]  homes and they're having record deaths inside and they're shipping COVID patients in.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:20.120]  I mean, this is all an exercise in murdering people.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.840]  And now they admit it.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.080]  And now they're going to kill handy.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:28.800]  They are killing handicapped kids and handicapped adults.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.279]  COVID is the cover for the eugenics extermination.
[00:53:32.279 --> 00:53:33.779]  Get out of your comfort zone.
[00:53:33.779 --> 00:53:39.100]  This is the issue, not football, not even, you know, if you're a 20 year old male having
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:42.859]  five girlfriends, you're under attack.
[00:53:42.859 --> 00:53:43.859]  Humanity's under attack.
[00:53:43.859 --> 00:53:47.300]  Stop thinking of things as just you go to the hamburger place, you go to the movies,
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.620]  you watch a football game.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:50.220]  You're under globalist attack.
[00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:51.340]  This is the issue.
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:53.340]  This is the world.
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:58.340]  And they want to demonize the American people and have this CIA and military wage war on
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:53:59.680]  us.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:03.180]  This is Hitler level crap.
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:05.220]  So what are you going to do to expose Bill Gates?
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.779]  I'm asking you, you're as smart as I am.
[00:54:06.779 --> 00:54:10.819]  You're going to paint something on your barn, when you see him speaking at your local college
[00:54:10.819 --> 00:54:11.900]  and getting his face.
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.859]  I mean, what are you going to do?
[00:54:13.859 --> 00:54:17.939]  He's coming with contact tracers to forcefully inoculate you with poison.
[00:54:17.939 --> 00:54:19.740]  He's been kicked out of all these countries.
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.899]  We can kick him out of here.
[00:54:21.899 --> 00:54:22.899]  We can do something.
[00:54:22.899 --> 00:54:27.540]  We can get up off our asses and stop laying down to this bullshit.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:31.939]  All right, let's go to these two reports.
[00:54:31.939 --> 00:54:34.939]  I won't be back till it's over in 50 minutes.
[00:54:34.939 --> 00:54:36.100]  And this could be our last broadcast.
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.740]  Who knows how long we'll be here, folks.
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:39.060]  This is a damn war.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.060]  Remember, they're trying to shut us down and lying about us because they don't want me
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:44.580]  to tell you what they're doing.
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.580]  Think about that.
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.140]  That's an attack on you, not an attack on me.
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:50.340]  Just like Trump told you, they're not angry at me.
[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:51.500]  They want to get you.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.859]  They want to get through me to get you.
[00:54:54.859 --> 00:54:57.540]  We'll be right back.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.540]  Good afternoon, Senators.
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:05.859]  Attorney for the president here.
[00:55:05.859 --> 00:55:13.220]  The article of impeachment now before the Senate is an unjust and blatantly unconstitutional
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:16.359]  act of political vengeance.
[00:55:16.359 --> 00:55:22.580]  This appalling abuse of the Constitution only further divides our nation when we should
[00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:25.580]  be trying to come together around shared priorities.
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:26.580]  This is Michael Vanderveen.
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:27.580]  He's a partner of Bruce Castor who made the president's opening remarks the other day.
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:28.580]  Had not been expected to speak, but we're going to listen in.
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:34.840]  Like every other politically motivated witch hunt the left has engaged in over the past
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:42.420]  four years, this impeachment is completely divorced from the facts, the evidence, and
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:45.300]  the interests of the American people.
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:51.340]  The Senate should promptly and decisively vote to reject it.
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:57.500]  No thinking person could seriously believe that the president's January 6th speech on
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:04.380]  the ellipse was in any way an incitement to violence or insurrection.
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:09.819]  The suggestion is patently absurd on its face.
[00:56:09.819 --> 00:56:19.380]  Nothing in the text could ever be construed as encouraging, condoning, or enticing unlawful
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:24.660]  activity of any kind.
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:30.620]  Far from promoting insurrection against the United States, the president's remarks explicitly
[00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:40.859]  encouraged those in attendance to exercise their rights peacefully and patriotically.
[00:56:40.859 --> 00:56:47.859]  Peaceful and patriotic protest is the very antithesis of a violent assault on the nation's
[00:56:47.859 --> 00:56:50.380]  capital.
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:55.200]  The House impeachment article slanderously alleges that the president intended for the
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:02.740]  crowd at the ellipse to, quote, interfere with the joint session's solemn constitutional
[00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:08.700]  duty to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:14.660]  This is manifestly disproven by the plain text of the remarks.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:20.420]  The president devoted nearly his entire speech to an extended discussion of how legislators
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:24.060]  should vote on the question at hand.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:29.899]  Instead of expressing a desire that the joint session be prevented from conducting its business,
[00:57:29.899 --> 00:57:37.840]  the entire premise of his remarks was that the democratic process would and should play
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:47.200]  to the letter of the law, including both the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:52.640]  In the conclusion of his remarks, he then laid out a series of legislative steps that
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:58:00.640]  should be taken to improve democratic accountability going forward, such as passing universal voter
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:10.319]  ID legislation, banning ballot harvesting, requiring proof of citizenship to vote, and
[00:58:10.319 --> 00:58:15.399]  turning out strong in the next primaries.
[00:58:15.399 --> 00:58:23.340]  Not only presidents, these are not the words of someone inciting a violent insurrection.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:30.000]  Not only President Trump's speech on January 6th, but indeed his entire challenge to the
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:37.319]  election results was squarely focused on how the proper civic process could address
[00:58:37.319 --> 00:58:42.600]  any concerns through the established legal and constitutional system.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:49.600]  The president brought his case before state and federal courts, the U.S. Supreme Court,
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:55.760]  the state legislatures, the Electoral College, and ultimately the U.S. Congress.
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:59:01.880]  In the past, numerous other candidates for president have used many of the same processes
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:07.040]  to pursue their own election challenges.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:14.760]  As recently as 2016, the Clinton campaign brought multiple post-election court cases,
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:23.660]  demanded recounts, and ridiculously declared the election stolen by Russia.
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:29.180]  Many Democrats even attempted to persuade the Electoral College delegates to overturn
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:32.200]  the 2016 results.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:40.300]  House Manager Raskin objected to the certification of President Trump's victory four years ago,
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:43.140]  along with many of his colleagues.
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:49.300]  You'll remember it was Joe Biden who had to gavel them down.
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:55.580]  I have an objection because 10 of the 29 electoral votes cast by Florida were cast
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:57.899]  by electors not lawfully certified.
[00:59:57.899 --> 01:00:03.460]  I object to the votes from the state of Wisconsin, which should not be legally certified.
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:07.140]  Mr. President, I object to the certificate from the state of Georgia on the grounds that
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:08.380]  the electoral votes were not—
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:09.380]  No debate.
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.380]  There's no debate.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:13.779]  I object to the certificate from the state of North Carolina.
[01:00:13.779 --> 01:00:17.060]  I object to the 15 votes from the state of North Carolina.
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.060]  I object.
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.620]  I object to the certificate from the state of Alabama.
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:22.819]  The electors were not lawfully certified.
[01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:24.260]  Is it signed by a senator?
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.260]  Not as of yet, Mr. President.
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:28.300]  In that case, the objection cannot be entertained.
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:30.060]  The objection cannot be entertained.
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.060]  The debate is not in order.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.060]  There is no debate in order.
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.060]  Is it signed by a senator?
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.060]  There is no debate.
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.060]  There is no debate in the joint session.
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:40.060]  There is no debate.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.060]  There is no debate.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:42.060]  There is no debate.
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.060]  Please come to order.
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.060]  The objection cannot be received.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.060]  The objection cannot be received.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:53.060]  Section 18, Title III of the United States Code prohibits debate in the joint session.
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.060]  I do not wish to debate.
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:01:01.060]  I wish to ask, is there one United States senator who will join me in this letter of objection?
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:02.060]  There is no debate.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.060]  There is no debate.
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.060]  There is one.
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.060]  The gentlewoman will suspend.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:16.899]  In 2000, the dispute over the outcome was taken all the way to the Supreme Court, which
[01:01:16.899 --> 01:01:20.220]  ultimately rendered a decision.
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:27.540]  To litigate questions of election integrity within this system is not incitement to resurrection.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:34.880]  It is the democratic system working as the founders and lawmakers have designed.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:41.240]  To claim that the president in any way wished, desired, or encouraged lawless or violent
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:46.859]  behavior is a preposterous and monstrous lie.
[01:01:46.859 --> 01:01:51.960]  In fact, the first two messages the president sent via Twitter once the incursion of the
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:02:01.399]  Capitol began were, stay peaceful and no violence because we are the party of law and order.
[01:02:01.399 --> 01:02:06.060]  The gathering on January 6th was supposed to be a peaceful event.
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:08.480]  Make no mistake about that.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:14.779]  And the overwhelming majority of those in attendance remained peaceful.
[01:02:14.779 --> 01:02:21.200]  As everyone knows, the president had spoken at hundreds of large rallies across the country
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.600]  over the past five years.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:30.520]  There had never been any mob-like or riotous behaviors and in fact, a significant portion
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:40.520]  of each event was devoted to celebrating the rule of law, protecting our constitution,
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:45.560]  and honoring the men and women of law enforcement.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:53.640]  Contrast the president's repeated combinations of violence with the rhetoric from his opponents.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:59.960]  I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:05.720]  The vast majority of the protesters have been peaceful.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:10.640]  Republicans stand for law and order and we stand for justice.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.840]  I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country, maybe there will be.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:20.200]  My administration will always stand against violence, mayhem, and disorder.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:23.720]  There needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.399]  I stand with the heroes of law enforcement.
[01:03:27.399 --> 01:03:34.399]  And you push back on them and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.
[01:03:34.399 --> 01:03:40.319]  We will never defund our police, together we will ensure that America is a nation of
[01:03:40.319 --> 01:03:41.319]  law and order.
[01:03:41.319 --> 01:03:44.279]  We were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.
[01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:46.880]  I think you need to go back and punch him in the face.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.760]  I feel like punching him.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.560]  We just want law and order, everybody wants that.
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:59.880]  I want to tell you, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.880]  pay the price.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.279]  We want law and order, we have to have law and order.
[01:04:04.279 --> 01:04:08.160]  Show me where it says that protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:13.800]  We believe in safe streets, secure communities, and we believe in law and order.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:30.640]  Tragically, as we know now, on January 6th, a small group who came to engage in violent
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:38.200]  and menacing behavior hijacked the event for their own purposes.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:43.359]  According to publicly available reporting, it is apparent that extremists of various
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:51.200]  different stripes and political persuasions pre-planned and premeditated an attack on
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.480]  the Capitol.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.480]  One of the first people arrested was the leader of Antifa.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:02.880]  Sadly, he was also among the first to be released.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:09.960]  From the beginning, the president has been clear, the criminals who infiltrated the Capitol
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.960]  must be punished to the fullest extent of the law.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:18.279]  They should be in prison for as long as the law allows.
[01:05:18.279 --> 01:05:25.480]  The fact that the attacks were apparently premeditated, as alleged by the House managers,
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:32.600]  demonstrates the ludicrousness of the incitement allegation against the president.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:37.520]  You can't incite what was already going to happen.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:43.960]  Law enforcement officers at the scene conducted themselves heroically and courageously, and
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.439]  our country owes them an eternal debt.
[01:05:47.439 --> 01:05:54.359]  But there must be a discussion of the decision by political leadership regarding force, posture,
[01:05:54.359 --> 01:05:58.040]  and security in advance of the event.
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:06.220]  As many will recall, last summer the White House was faced with violent rioters night
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:09.420]  after night.
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:15.580]  They repeatedly attacked Secret Service officers and at one point pierced a security wall,
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:20.180]  culminating in the clearing of Lafayette Square.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:26.380]  Since that time, there has been a sustained negative narrative in the media regarding
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:32.859]  the necessity of those security measures on that night, even though they certainly prevented
[01:06:32.859 --> 01:06:36.399]  many calamities from occurring.
[01:06:36.399 --> 01:06:41.980]  In the wake of the Capitol attack, it must be investigated whether the proper force posture
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:50.980]  was not initiated due to the political pressure stemming from the events at Lafayette Square.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.899]  Consider this.
[01:06:52.899 --> 01:06:58.800]  On January 5th, the mayor of the District of Columbia explicitly discouraged the National
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:04.560]  Guard and federal authorities from doing more to protect the Capitol, saying, and I
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:13.300]  quote, the District of Columbia is not requesting other federal law enforcement personnel and
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:19.520]  discourages any additional deployment.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:25.359]  This sham impeachment also poses a serious threat to freedom of speech for political
[01:07:25.359 --> 01:07:31.319]  leaders of both parties at every level of government.
[01:07:31.319 --> 01:07:39.359]  The Senate should be extremely careful about the precedent this case will set.
[01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:47.980]  Consider the language that the House impeachment article alleges to constitute incitement.
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:55.660]  If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:08:01.700]  This is ordinary political rhetoric that is virtually indistinguishable from the language
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:09.260]  that has been used by people across the political spectrum for hundreds of years.
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:15.340]  Countless politicians have spoken of fighting for our principles.
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:22.220]  Joe Biden's campaign slogan was battle for the soul of America.
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:29.059]  No human being seriously believes that the use of such metaphorical terminology is incitement
[01:08:29.059 --> 01:08:33.380]  to political violence.
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:39.440]  While the president did not engage in any language of incitement, there are numerous
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:47.480]  officials in Washington who have indeed used profoundly reckless, dangerous and inflammatory
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:50.920]  rhetoric in recent years.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:59.000]  The entire Democratic Party and national news media spent the last four years repeating
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:10.639]  without any evidence that the 2016 election had been hacked and falsely and absurdly claimed
[01:09:10.639 --> 01:09:15.720]  the president of the United States was a Russian spy.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:21.920]  Speaker Pelosi herself said that the 2016 election was hijacked and that Congress has
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.120]  a duty to protect our democracy.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:31.600]  She also called the president an imposter and a traitor, and recently referred to her
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.760]  colleagues in the House as the enemy within.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:43.600]  Moreover, many Democrat politicians endorsed and encouraged the riots that destroyed vast
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:53.800]  swaths of American cities last summer, when violent left wing anarchists conducted a sustained
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:59.520]  assault on a federal courthouse in Portland, Oregon.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.639]  Speaker Pelosi did not call it an insurrection.
[01:10:03.639 --> 01:10:15.080]  Instead, she called the federal law enforcement officers protecting the building stormtroopers.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:23.480]  When violent mobs destroyed public property, she said, people will do what they do.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:32.120]  The attorney general of the state of Massachusetts stated, yes, America is burning, but that's
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:36.840]  how forests grow.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:43.059]  Representative Anya Presley declared, there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long
[01:10:43.059 --> 01:10:47.840]  as there is unrest in our lives.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:53.000]  The current vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris, urged supporters to donate
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:00.520]  to a fund that bailed out violent rioters and arsonists out of jail.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:06.320]  One of those was released and went out and committed another crime, assault.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:11.920]  He beat the bejesus out of somebody.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:21.799]  She said of the violent demonstrations, everyone beware, they're not going to stop before
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:27.639]  election day in November, and they're not going to stop after election day.
[01:11:27.639 --> 01:11:34.120]  They're not going to let up, and they should not.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:40.120]  Such rhetoric continued even as hundreds of police officers across the nation were subjected
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:45.360]  to violent assaults at the hands of angry mobs.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:52.920]  A man claiming to be inspired by the junior senator from Vermont came down here to Washington,
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:59.760]  D.C. to watch a softball game and kill as many senators and congressmen as he could.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:06.320]  It cannot be forgotten that President Trump did not blame the junior senator.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:14.080]  The senior senator from Maine has had her house surrounded by angry mobs of protesters.
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:19.840]  When that happened and unnerved her, one of the house managers, I forget which one,
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:31.280]  tweeted, cry me a river.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:37.200]  Under the standards of the house impeachment article, each of these individuals should
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:46.000]  be retroactively censored, expelled, punished, or impeached for inciting violence by their
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.320]  supporters.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:55.719]  Unlike the left, President Trump has been entirely consistent in his opposition to mob
[01:12:55.719 --> 01:12:57.080]  violence.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:02.200]  He opposes it in all forms, in all places.
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.600]  Just as he's been consistent that the National Guard should be deployed to protect American
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:11.000]  communities wherever protection is needed.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.680]  For Democrats, they have clearly demonstrated that their opposition to mobs and their view
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:26.280]  of using the National Guard depends upon the mobs' political views.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:33.380]  Not only is this impeachment case preposterously wrong on the facts, no matter how much heat
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:42.420]  and emotion is injected by the political opposition, it is also plainly unconstitutional.
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:49.260]  In effect, Congress would be claiming that the right to disqualify a private citizen
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:54.559]  no longer a government official from running for public office.
[01:13:54.559 --> 01:14:00.260]  This would transform the solemn impeachment process into a mechanism for asserting congressional
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:09.380]  control over which private citizens are and are not allowed to run for president.
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:16.380]  In short, this unprecedented effort is not about Democrats opposing political violence.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:24.540]  It is about Democrats trying to disqualify their political opposition.
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:30.340]  It is constitutional cancel culture.
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:37.059]  History will record this shameful effort as a deliberate attempt by the Democrat Party
[01:14:37.059 --> 01:14:46.299]  to smear, censor, and cancel not just President Trump, but the 75 million Americans who voted
[01:14:46.299 --> 01:14:47.299]  for him.
[01:14:47.299 --> 01:14:53.700]  I stand before you on what I've always thought as the hallowed ground of democracy.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:58.940]  In this room, American lives have been changed so dramatically in just my lifetime through
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:04.660]  so many of your legislative initiatives, from the Civil Rights Act when I was a child through
[01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:10.420]  most recently the First Step Act, laws that have provided major opportunities for Americans
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:16.559]  to move forward and upward and more fully enjoy all of the attributes of what has been
[01:15:16.559 --> 01:15:18.820]  the greatest nation on earth.
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:22.940]  I've seen the changes these laws have made through my clients every day for the past
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.780]  36 years.
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:29.139]  These laws have enabled me to fight for their enjoyment of a fair stake in our American
[01:15:29.139 --> 01:15:30.980]  project.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:36.900]  I stand before a group of 100 United States senators who have chosen to serve your country
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:43.940]  from all corners of this great nation, giving up all sorts of professions, time with family,
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:48.059]  and perhaps other more lucrative opportunities to serve your country.
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:53.920]  Mr. President, you are a man who so honorably served this nation in the Senate and in public
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.780]  service before your tenure here.
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:03.460]  It is an honor to appear in this historic hall of democracy, yet today that honor is
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:08.360]  tempered by an overriding feeling of grave concern.
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:13.500]  Grave concern for the danger to the institution of the presidency that I believe even convening
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.219]  these proceedings indicates.
[01:16:16.219 --> 01:16:20.840]  The joy I believed I would feel if I ever had the great privilege of appearing before
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:25.559]  this body is replaced by sadness and pain.
[01:16:25.559 --> 01:16:31.540]  My overriding emotion is frankly wanting to cry for what I believe these proceedings will
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:38.299]  do to our great, so long enduring, sacred Constitution and to the American people on
[01:16:38.299 --> 01:16:43.460]  both sides of the great divide that now characterizes our nation.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:48.620]  Esteemed members of the Senate, going forward with this impeachment trial of a former President
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:54.420]  of the United States is unconstitutional for reasons we have set out in our brief, some
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:17:01.340]  of which we will focus on here, and as a matter of policy, it is wrong, as wrong can be for
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:04.180]  all of us as a nation.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:09.980]  We are told by those who favor having these proceedings that we have to do it for accountability.
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:16.980]  But anyone truly interested in real accountability for what happened at the Capitol on January
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:22.580]  6th would, of course, insist on waiting for a full investigation to be completed.
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:29.219]  Indeed, one is underway in earnest already, intent on getting to the bottom of what happened.
[01:17:29.219 --> 01:17:35.380]  Anyone interested in ensuring that it's truly the one or ones responsible from whom accountability
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:41.139]  is sought would more than willingly wait for the actual evidence, especially with new
[01:17:41.139 --> 01:17:47.700]  evidence coming in every day about pre-planning, about those who were involved, and about their
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:52.880]  agenda bearing no relationship to the claims made here.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:57.980]  They say you need this trial before the nation can heal, that the nation cannot heal without
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:59.299]  it.
[01:17:59.299 --> 01:18:04.740]  I say our nation cannot possibly heal with it.
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:09.080]  With this trial, you will open up new and bigger wounds across the nation, for a great
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:15.700]  many Americans see this process for exactly what it is, a chance by a group of partisan
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:21.840]  politicians seeking to eliminate Donald Trump from the American political scene and seeking
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:29.820]  to disenfranchise 74 million-plus American voters and those who dare to share their political
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:33.280]  beliefs and vision of America.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:39.040]  They hated the results of the 2016 election and want to use this impeachment process to
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:42.299]  further their political agenda.
[01:18:42.299 --> 01:18:44.840]  These elitists have mocked them for four years.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:48.299]  They've called their fellow Americans who believe in their country and their constitution
[01:18:48.299 --> 01:18:49.920]  deplorables.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:55.760]  And the latest talk is that they need to deprogram those who supported Donald Trump and the grand
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.600]  old party.
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:03.799]  But at the end of the day, this is not just about Donald Trump or any individual.
[01:19:03.799 --> 01:19:18.120]  This is about our constitution and abusing the impeachment power for political gain.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:23.460]  They tell us that we have to have this impeachment trial, such as it is, to bring about unity.
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.320]  But they don't want unity.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:30.000]  And they know this so-called trial will tear the country in half, leaving tens of millions
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.960]  of Americans feeling left out of the nation's agenda, as dictated by one political party
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:41.219]  that now holds the power in the White House and in our national legislature.
[01:19:41.219 --> 01:19:45.100]  But they're proud Americans who never quit getting back up when they're down.
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:51.540]  And they don't take dictates from another party based on partisan force-feeding.
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:55.860]  This trial will tear this country apart, perhaps like we have only seen once before
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:58.180]  in our history.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:04.020]  And to help the nation heal, we now learn that the House managers in their wisdom have
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:09.340]  hired a movie company and a large law firm to create, manufacture, and splice for you
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:17.260]  a package designed by experts to chill and horrify you and our fellow Americans.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:22.420]  They want to put you through a 16-hour presentation over two days, focusing on this as if it were
[01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:25.100]  some sort of blood sport.
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:26.100]  And to what end?
[01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:27.380]  For healing?
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:28.860]  For unity?
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:30.620]  For accountability?
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:32.460]  Not for any of those.
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:35.540]  For surely they are much better ways to achieve each.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:42.420]  It is again for pure, raw, misguided partisanship that makes them believe playing to our worst
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:46.940]  instincts somehow is good.
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:50.900]  They don't need to show you movies to show you that the riot happened here.
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:55.080]  We will stipulate that it happened, and you know all about it.
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:21:01.059]  This is a process fueled irresponsibly by base hatred by these House managers and those
[01:21:01.059 --> 01:21:06.420]  who gave them their charge, and they are willing to sacrifice our national character to advance
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:12.600]  their hatred and their fear that one day they might not be the party in power.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:21.840]  They have a very different view of democracy and freedom from Justice Jackson, who once
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:28.620]  wrote, but freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much.
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:31.000]  That would be a mere shadow of freedom.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:37.080]  The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch at the heart
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.600]  of the existing order.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:44.200]  They have a very different view of democracy and freedom.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:51.440]  This is nothing less than the political weaponization of the impeachment process, pure, raw sport
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:57.559]  fueled by the misguided idea of party over country, when in fact both will surely suffer.
[01:21:57.559 --> 01:22:02.219]  I can promise you that if these proceedings go forward, everyone will look bad.
[01:22:02.219 --> 01:22:06.080]  You will see and hear many members of our Congress saying and doing things they must
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:13.200]  surely regret, but perhaps far worse than a moment of personal shame in a world in which
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:20.799]  history passes from our memories in a moment, our great country, a model for all the world,
[01:22:20.799 --> 01:22:27.360]  will be far more divided and our standing around the world will be badly broken.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:33.760]  Our archenemies who pray each and every day for our downfall will watch with glee, glowing
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:40.240]  in the moment as they see you at your worst and our country in internal divide.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.639]  Let's be perfectly clear.
[01:22:41.639 --> 01:22:46.700]  If you vote to proceed with this impeachment trial, future senators will recognize that
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:51.680]  you bought into a radical constitutional theory that departs clearly from the language of
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:58.000]  the Constitution itself and holds, and this is in their brief, that any civil officer
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.400]  who ever dares to want to serve his or her country must know that they will be subject
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:10.040]  to impeachment long after their service in office has ended, subject only to the political
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:16.719]  and cultural landscape of the day that is in operation at any future time.
[01:23:16.719 --> 01:23:23.240]  This is exactly the position taken by the House managers at page 65 of their brief.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.780]  Unprecedented radical position.
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.280]  They unabashedly say so.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:33.059]  Imagine the potential consequences for civil officers you know and who you believed served
[01:23:33.059 --> 01:23:39.540]  so honorably but who in the view of a future Congress might one day be deemed to be impeachment-worthy.
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:45.420]  Imagine it now because your imagination is the only limitation.
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:49.580]  The House managers tell you a correct reading of the impeachment power under the Constitution
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:54.700]  is that it has no temporal limit and can reach back in time without limitation to target
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:58.460]  anyone who dared to serve our nation as a civil officer.
[01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:05.219]  Now add that to their demand that you members put your imprimatur on the snap impeachment
[01:24:05.219 --> 01:24:10.900]  they returned in this case and can do again in the future if you endorse it by going forward
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:12.780]  with this impeachment trial.
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:19.719]  This is an untenable combination that literally puts the institution of the presidency directly
[01:24:19.719 --> 01:24:22.820]  at risk, nothing less.
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:24.960]  And it does much more.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:30.400]  Under their unsupportable constitutional theory and tortured reading of the text, every civil
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:37.120]  officer who has served is at risk of impeachment if any given group elected to the House decides
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:41.219]  that what was thought to be important service to the country when they served now deserves
[01:24:41.219 --> 01:24:47.900]  to be cancelled.
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:50.820]  They've made clear in public statements that what they really want to accomplish here in
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:55.820]  the name of the Constitution is to bar Donald Trump from ever running for political office
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:25:01.660]  again but this is an affront to the Constitution no matter who they target today.
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:05.760]  It means nothing less than the denial of the right to vote and the independent right for
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:11.639]  a candidate to run for elective political office guaranteed by the first and 14th amendments
[01:25:11.639 --> 01:25:19.940]  to the United States Constitution under the guise of impeachment as a tool to disenfranchise.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:24.400]  Perhaps my friend put the situation simply and sharply into focus last week on his radio
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.400]  show.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:29.500]  My friend is a distinguished lawyer who served as an ambassador to former President Obama
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.380]  and has friends among you.
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:36.219]  He described himself to his listeners as a died-in-the-world lifelong Democrat.
[01:25:36.219 --> 01:25:42.980]  But he said the idea of a hundred people in these circumstances deciding the tens of millions
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:47.920]  of American voters cannot cast their vote for their candidate for president ever again
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.040]  is unthinkable and it truly should be.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:56.120]  I will discuss today several reasons this matter should not and must not proceed.
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:26:01.480]  Why the Senate lacks jurisdiction to conduct this trial of a former president, a president
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.240]  no longer in office and now a private citizen.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.680]  Any single reason in our trial memorandum or discussed today suffices.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:14.160]  But I want to start with a discussion of the fundamental due process lacking from the start
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:18.780]  and that would last through the end if this goes forward because it is this irretrievably
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:26.160]  flawed process and its product, a dangerous snap impeachment that brings us here and that
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:34.120]  threatens to send a message into the future that we will all regret forever and that stain
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:40.559]  this body which up to now our founding fathers believed was uniquely suited for the most
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:46.160]  difficult task of conducting an impeachment trial as Mr. Hamilton wrote in Federalist
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.680]  65.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:48.880]  These aren't just niceties.
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:56.040]  I make no apology for demanding in your name, in the name of the Constitution that the rights
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:01.719]  to due process guaranteed under the Constitution are adhered to in a process as serious as
[01:27:01.719 --> 01:27:07.000]  this in our national lives.
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:11.840]  Denial of due process in this case, of course, starts with the House of Representatives.
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:16.559]  In this unprecedented snap impeachment process, the House of Representatives denied every
[01:27:16.559 --> 01:27:21.160]  attribute of fundamental constitutional due process that Americans correctly have come
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:24.160]  to believe is part of what makes this country so great.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.520]  How and why did that happen?
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:32.480]  It is a function of the insatiable lust for impeachment in the House for the past four
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.480]  years.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.480]  Consider this.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:39.799]  I want to say this for Donald Trump, who I may well be voting to impeach.
[01:27:39.799 --> 01:27:44.040]  Donald Trump has already done a number of things which legitimately raise the question
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.040]  of impeachment.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:52.760]  I don't respect this president and I will fight every day until he is impeached.
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:55.040]  That is grounds to start impeachment proceedings.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.639]  Those are grounds to start impeachment.
[01:27:56.639 --> 01:27:58.320]  Those are grounds to start impeachment proceedings.
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:01.080]  Yes, I think that's grounds to start impeachment proceedings.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:09.960]  I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to call for the impeachment of the president of the United
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.240]  States of America.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:14.080]  I continue to say, impeach him!
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.080]  Impeach 45!
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.080]  Impeach 45!
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:23.160]  So we're calling upon the House to begin impeachment hearings immediately.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.400]  On the impeachment of Donald Trump, would you vote yes or no?
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.000]  I would vote yes.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.880]  I would vote, I would vote too much.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.680]  Because we're going to go in there, we're going to impeach the mother f***er.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:37.040]  But the fact is, I introduced articles of impeachment in July of 2017.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:40.200]  We don't impeach this president, he will get re-elected.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:43.559]  The House requires me to be for impeachment, have an impeachment hearing.
[01:28:43.559 --> 01:28:45.760]  He needs to scarlet eye on his chest.
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:49.639]  Representatives should begin impeachment proceedings against this president.
[01:28:49.639 --> 01:28:53.080]  It is time to bring impeachment charges against him.
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.040]  Bring impeachment charges.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:58.040]  My personal view is that he richly deserves impeachment.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:03.200]  I'm here at an impeachment rally, and we are ready to impeach the...
[01:29:09.799 --> 01:29:13.080]  The relevant timeline in the House reveals the rush to judgment.
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:17.160]  On the day following the January 6th riot, the House leadership cynically sensed a political
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.280]  opportunity to score points against the outgoing then-President Trump.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:25.840]  And the Speaker demanded that Vice President Pence invoke the 25th Amendment, threatening
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:31.160]  immediate impeachment for the president if Mr. Pence did not comply with this extraordinary
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:34.600]  and extraordinarily wrong demand.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:40.080]  Four days later, on January 11th, 2021, the instant article of impeachment was introduced
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.480]  in the House.
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:47.000]  Speaker Pelosi then gave the Vice President another ultimatum, threatening to begin impeachment
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.280]  proceedings within 24 hours if he did not comply.
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:56.280]  Vice President Pence rejected Speaker Pelosi's demand, favoring instead adherence to the
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:01.920]  Constitution and the best interests of the nation over a politically motivated threat.
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:06.719]  On January 12th, Speaker Pelosi announced who the nine impeachment managers would be.
[01:30:06.719 --> 01:30:11.360]  And on January 13th, 2021, just days after holding a press conference to announce the
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:17.160]  launching of an inquiry, the House adopted the article of impeachment, completing the
[01:30:17.799 --> 01:30:22.200]  fastest impeachment inquiry in history and, according President Trump, no due process
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:28.320]  at all over strong opposition based in large part on the complete lack of due process.
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:31.280]  To say there was a rush to judgment by the House would be a grave understatement.
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.920]  It is not as if the House members who voted to impeach were not mightily warned about
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:40.520]  the dangers to the institution of the presidency and about our system and to our system of
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:41.760]  due process.
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:46.360]  They were warned in the strongest of terms from within their own ranks, adamantly, clearly
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:51.680]  and in no uncertain terms not to take this dangerous snap impeachment course.
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:55.719]  Those warnings were framed in the context of the constitutional due process that was
[01:30:55.719 --> 01:30:57.280]  denied here.
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:01.960]  Consider the warnings given by one member during the House proceedings pleading with
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:07.400]  the other members to accord this decision the due process the Constitution demands.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:10.240]  This is Representative Cole of Oklahoma.
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:14.520]  With only one week to go in his term, the majority is asking us to consider a resolution
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:19.440]  impeaching President Trump and they do so knowing full well that even if the House passes
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:24.680]  the resolution, the Senate will not be able to begin considering these charges until after
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:26.799]  President Trump's term ends.
[01:31:26.799 --> 01:31:31.520]  I can think of no action the House can take that is more likely to further divide the
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:35.600]  American people than the action we are contemplating today.
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:40.360]  Emotions are clearly running high and political divisions have never been more apparent in
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:43.680]  my lifetime, Representative Cole said.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:48.160]  Mr. Cole's words on the floor, emphasizing the care that must be taken with respect to
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:52.840]  the consideration of an article of impeachment echoed the concerns by our founding fathers
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.840]  on this subject.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:32:00.240]  Listen to this from Mr. Hamilton in Federalist No. 65, quote, a well-constituted court for
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:06.200]  the trial of impeachments is an object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:08.240]  in a government wholly elective.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:13.080]  The prosecution of them for this reason will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:21.480]  whole community and to divide into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused.
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:26.639]  In many cases, it will connect itself with preexisting factions and will enlist all their
[01:32:26.639 --> 01:32:32.400]  animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:36.799]  In such cases, there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated
[01:32:36.799 --> 01:32:42.400]  more by the comparative strength of parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:48.600]  or guilt, prescient thinking by Mr. Hamilton, as we see often.
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:53.559]  In what I say to you as a proof of the need for due process based on the critically serious
[01:32:53.559 --> 01:32:59.080]  nature of the singular role the impeachment process has in our government, Mr. Hamilton
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:04.120]  characterized the consideration of an impeachment in these terms, the delicacy and magnitude
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:09.920]  of a trust which so deeply concerns the political reputation and existence of every man engaged
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:16.280]  in the administration of public affairs speak for themselves, this too in Federalist 65.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:20.360]  Now back to the House and the warnings against this rushed judgment in this case.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:24.320]  Mr. Cole of Oklahoma again, in the name of healing a path forward he said our people
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:29.400]  so desperately need, he warned that, quote, the House is moving forward erratically with
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:34.120]  a truncated process that does not comport with the modern practice and that will give
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:39.120]  members no time to contemplate the serious nature of action before us.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:44.120]  Mr. Cole emphasized to his colleagues that such care must be taken with the consideration
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:50.320]  of an article of impeachment, quote, in order to ensure that the American people have confidence
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:55.660]  in the procedures the House is following and because the presidency itself demands due
[01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:59.719]  process in the impeachment proceedings.
[01:33:59.719 --> 01:34:05.000]  Congressman Cole continued, unfortunately, this is a quote, the majority has chosen to
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.639]  race to the floor with a new article of impeachment, foregoing any investigation, any committee
[01:34:10.639 --> 01:34:17.639]  process or any chance for members to fully contemplate this course of action before proceeding.
[01:34:18.639 --> 01:34:22.240]  Mr. Cole complained that the majority is failing to provide the House with an opportunity to
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:26.799]  review all the facts which are still coming to light, to discuss all the evidence, to
[01:34:26.799 --> 01:34:31.680]  listen to scholars, to examine the witnesses and to consider precedents.
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:37.840]  He's noted further this is not the type of robust process we have followed for every
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:44.840]  modern impeachment and the failure to do so does a great disservice to this institution
[01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:49.639]  and to this country, Mr. Cole said.
[01:34:49.639 --> 01:34:53.240]  Mr. Cole complained right on the House floor that rather than following the appropriate
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:59.740]  processes he said the House has used in every modern impeachment the majority is rushing
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:05.940]  to the floor tripping all over themselves in their rush to impeach the president a second
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:12.940]  time and in Mr. Cole's words it was doing so to, quote, settle scores.
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:16.780]  And he warned that this snap impeachment approach would cause great division as the country
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:20.299]  looks ahead to the start of a new administration.
[01:35:20.299 --> 01:35:26.740]  He said to them in a matter as grave and consequential as impeachment, shouldn't we follow the same
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:31.940]  process we've used in every modern impeachment rather than rushing to the floor and he implored
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:32.580]  them.
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:37.760]  On behalf of generations of Americans to come we need to think more clearly about the consequences
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:42.180]  of our action today and Mr. Cole then reached across the aisle and credited a member of
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:49.180]  this body, Senator Manchin, with having voiced similar sentiments about how ill-advised this
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:57.180]  rushed process was, suggesting that the underlying events were a matter for the judicial system
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:02.520]  to investigate, not one for a rushed political process.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:08.520]  Finally, Mr. Cole admonished his fellow House members telling them we need to recognize
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:12.520]  that we are following a flawed process.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:15.520]  The alarm Mr. Cole sounded went unheeded.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:21.960]  Now let us consider the process in the House that actually was due.
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:25.960]  The House managers assert in the memorandum that the House serves as a grand jury and
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:27.960]  prosecutor under the Constitution.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:29.960]  They told you that again today.
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:35.960]  If this is accurate then they highlight the complete failure to adhere to due process.
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:39.960]  One should not diminish the significance of impeachment's legal aspects, particularly
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:43.960]  as they relate to the formalities of the criminal justice process.
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:52.400]  It is a hybrid of the political and legal, a political process moderated by legal formalities.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:58.400]  This is a quote Richard Broughton.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:02.400]  The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in relevant part, that no person
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:06.400]  shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:12.400]  The Supreme Court long ago recognized in Matthews v. Eldredge that at its core due process is
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:18.840]  about what we all want, what we all have the right to demand, fundamental fairness.
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:24.840]  One scholar Brian Owsley has written that the impeachment process should and does include
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:28.840]  some of the basic safeguards for the accused that are observed in a criminal process such
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:34.840]  as fairness, due process, presumption of innocence, and proportionality, basic American values.
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:41.280]  And of course we know that the Supreme Court has recognized that due process protection
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.280]  attend congressional investigations.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:49.280]  While Congress is empowered to make its own rules of proceeding, it may not make rules
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.280]  that ignore constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights.
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:03.280]  While the case law is limited in terms of spelling out what due process looks like in
[01:38:03.719 --> 01:38:09.719]  impeachment hearings, and of course in the Nixon case, Walter, not Richard, we know that
[01:38:09.719 --> 01:38:13.719]  there is a great deal of leeway afforded Congress with respect to its impeachment rules.
[01:38:13.719 --> 01:38:18.719]  It is clear that the fundamental principles that underlie our understanding of what due
[01:38:18.719 --> 01:38:21.719]  process must always look like apply.
[01:38:21.719 --> 01:38:27.719]  In Hastings v. United States, D.C. court case, vacated on different grounds, they address
[01:38:27.719 --> 01:38:32.719]  the matter, clearly concluding that the due process clause applies to impeachment proceedings
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:38.160]  and that it imposes an independent constitutional constraint on how the Senate exercises its
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:44.160]  sole power to try all impeachments under Article I, Section 3, Clause 6.
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:48.160]  Court wrote in Hastings, impeachment is an extraordinary remedy.
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:52.160]  As an essential element of our constitutional system of checks and balances, impeachment
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:58.160]  must be invoked and carried out with solemn respect and scrupulous attention to fairness.
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:05.100]  Fairness and due process must be the watchword where ever a branch of the United States government
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:11.100]  conducts a trial, whether it be in a criminal case, a civil case, or a case of impeachment.
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:16.600]  A 1974 Department of Justice memo suggested the same view, opining that, quote, whether
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:22.600]  or not capable of judicial enforcement, due process standards would seem to be relevant
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:26.600]  to the manner of conducting an impeachment proceeding.
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.040]  Or, specifically, as the Hastings court described it, one of the key principles that lies at
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:33.040]  the heart of our constitutional democracy.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.040]  Again, fairness.
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:41.040]  The Supreme Court's precedents establish the general rule that individuals must receive
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:47.040]  notice and an opportunity to be heard before the government deprives them of a
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:49.040]  constitutionally protected interest.
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:55.040]  It is also true that in any proceeding that may lead to deprivation of a protected interest,
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:40:01.480]  it requires fair procedures commensurate with the interests at stake.
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:06.480]  Impeachment proceedings plainly involve deprivations of property and liberty interests protected
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.480]  by the due process clause.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:14.480]  And the House surely seeks to strip Donald Trump of his most highly cherished constitutional
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:20.480]  rights, including the right to be eligible to hold public office again should he so choose.
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:26.920]  Due process must apply, and in a minimum, due process in the impeachment process must
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:30.920]  include that the evidence must be disclosed to the accused, and the accused must be
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:38.920]  permitted an opportunity to test and confront the evidence, particularly through the
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:42.920]  rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses, which have long been recognized as
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:44.920]  essential to due process.
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:49.920]  In almost every setting where important decisions turn on questions of fact, due process
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:54.360]  requires an opportunity to confront and cross-examine.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:59.360]  It is unfathomable that the framers steeped in the history of Anglo-American
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:05.360]  jurisprudence would create a system that would allow the chief executive and commander-in-chief
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:10.360]  of the armed forces to be impeached based on a process that developed evidence without
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:15.360]  providing any of the elementary procedures that the common law developed over centuries
[01:41:15.799 --> 01:41:19.799]  including the proper testing of evidence in an adversarial process.
[01:41:19.799 --> 01:41:24.799]  We would never countenance such a system in this country.
[01:41:24.799 --> 01:41:27.799]  Current members of the House and Senate leadership are themselves on record repeatedly
[01:41:27.799 --> 01:41:30.799]  confirming these procedural due process requirements.
[01:41:30.799 --> 01:41:34.799]  Indeed, Congressman Nadler is on record asserting that in the context of a House
[01:41:34.799 --> 01:41:40.799]  impeachment investigation, due process includes, quote, the right to be informed of
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:46.240]  the law of the charges against you, to call your own witnesses, and to have the
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:48.240]  assistance of counsel.
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.240]  Then-President Trump was not given any semblance of the due process Congressman
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:58.240]  Nadler clearly believes he deserves based on the Congressman's description of due process
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:03.240]  that must be afforded to an accused in an impeachment proceeding as reflected in a
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:08.240]  statement he made relating to another impeachment in 1998.
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:13.680]  No reason was found for the apparent change in the Congressman's point of view with
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:17.680]  respect to the two objects of the impeachment at issue.
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:21.680]  These fundamental attributes of due process have been honored as required parts of
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:25.680]  modern impeachment protocol since at least 1870.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:30.680]  It's not seriously debatable, nor should it be, by any American legislator.
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:35.680]  In spite of all this, the House leadership defied all the norms and denied the then-President
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:39.120]  all of his basic and constitutionally protected rights.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:43.120]  For then-President Donald Trump, the House impeachment procedure lacked any semblance
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.120]  of due process whatever.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:50.120]  It simply cannot be credibly argued to the country, and we do not make special rules
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.120]  for different targets.
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:57.120]  It's the very integrity of the institution that suffers when we do, and that is what
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:00.120]  the House leadership knowingly has caused.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:03.120]  A review of the House record reveals that the Speaker streamlined the impeachment
[01:43:03.559 --> 01:43:07.559]  process, House Resolution 24 to go straight to the floor for a two-hour debate and a
[01:43:07.559 --> 01:43:09.559]  vote without the ability for amendments.
[01:43:09.559 --> 01:43:14.559]  The House record reflects no committee hearing, no witnesses, no presentation or cross-examination
[01:43:14.559 --> 01:43:19.559]  of evidence, and no opportunity for the accused to respond or even have counsel present to
[01:43:19.559 --> 01:43:20.559]  object.
[01:43:20.559 --> 01:43:25.559]  As the New York Times recently reported, there were no witness interviews, no hearings, no
[01:43:25.559 --> 01:43:29.559]  committee debates, and no real additional fact-finding.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  House managers claimed the need for impeachment was so urgent that they had to rush the proceedings
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  with no time to spare for a more thorough investigation, or really any investigation
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  at all.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  But that claim is belied by what happened or didn't happen next.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  The House leadership unilaterally and by choice waited another 12 days to deliver the article
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  to this Senate to begin the trial process.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  In other words, the House leadership spent more time holding the adopted article than
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:04.440]  it did on the whole process leading up to the adoption of the article.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:09.440]  That intentional delay, designed to avoid having the trial begin while Mr. Trump was
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:14.440]  still president, led to yet another egregious denial of due process.
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:25.440]  Article 1, Clause 6 of our Constitution, of course, provides in pertinent part that the
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:29.880]  Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:34.880]  When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation, and when the President
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:38.880]  of the United States has tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:43.880]  By intentionally waiting until President Trump's term of office expired before delivering the
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:48.880]  article of impeachment to the Senate to initiate trial proceedings, Speaker Pelosi deprived
[01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:56.320]  then-President Trump of the express constitutional right and the right under the Senate's own
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:02.320]  Rule 4 to have the Chief Justice of the United States preside over his trial and wield the
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:07.320]  considerable power provided for in the rules of procedure and practice in the Senate when
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:09.320]  sitting on impeachment trials.
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:14.320]  That power includes under Rule 5 the presiding officer's exclusive right to make initial
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:20.360]  all orders, under Rule 7 to make all evidentiary orders, subject to objections by a member
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.639]  of the Senate.
[01:45:21.639 --> 01:45:26.080]  We say respectfully that this intentional delay by Speaker Pelosi, such that in the
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:30.920]  intervening period President Trump became private citizen, Mr. Trump, constitutes a
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:37.000]  lapse or waiver of jurisdiction here, for Mr. Trump no longer is the President, described
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  as subject to impeachment in Article 1, Section 3, Clause 6, and in Article 2, Section 4.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:49.059]  And this body, therefore, has no jurisdiction as a function of that additional due process
[01:45:49.059 --> 01:45:51.600]  violation by Speaker Pelosi.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:58.040]  Moreover, with all due respect, then-President Trump suffered a tangible detriment from Speaker
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:02.740]  Pelosi's actions, which violates not only his rights to due process of law, but also
[01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:07.320]  his express constitutional right to have the Chief Justice preside.
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:11.440]  That tangible detriment includes the loss of the right to a conflict-free, impartial
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:17.080]  presiding officer, with all due respect, the very purpose behind requiring the Chief
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:22.240]  Justice to preside over the President's impeachment trial, along with the other benefits of having
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:27.960]  the two branches combined, the Chief Justice from the judiciary and the Senate, for the
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:33.400]  impeachment trial of the President, reflected in Federalist 66, one of the reasons the Chief
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:36.160]  Justice was chosen for that task.
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:41.160]  Mr. Trump now faces a situation in which the presiding officer will serve as both judge
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:47.480]  with all the powers that the rules endow him with, and juror with a vote.
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:52.240]  And beyond that, the presiding officer, although enjoying a lifelong, honorable reputation
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:59.040]  of course, has been Mr. Trump's vocal and adamant opponent throughout the Trump administration,
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:04.860]  and in fact, in the very matter on trial, the presiding officer, respectfully, already
[01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:10.440]  has publicly announced his fixed view before hearing any argument or evidence that Mr.
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:15.160]  Trump must be convicted on the article of impeachment before the Senate, and indeed
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:22.160]  that members in both parties have an obligation to vote to convict as well.
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:27.720]  Nowhere in this great country would any American, and certainly not this honorable presiding
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:33.800]  officer, consider this scenario to be consistent with any stretch of the American concept of
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:40.440]  due process and a fair trial, and certainly not even the appearance of either.
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:45.320]  By no stretch of the imagination could any fair-minded American be confident that a trial
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:51.040]  so conducted would or could be the fair trial promised by the leader.
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:55.000]  That was a powerful 45 minutes.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.920]  There's two hours and 15 minutes more of it.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:59.160]  We posted a Bandoff video.
[01:47:59.559 --> 01:48:01.800]  You got to dig around, even find Trump's defense.
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:04.120]  That was on a Friday.
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:06.760]  Again, that's how equal stuff works now.
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:09.559]  Two plus two don't equal four no more, like they say.
[01:48:09.559 --> 01:48:12.280]  Democrats get three days of lies.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.800]  Trump gets three hours.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:20.200]  But that's all because his lawyers are lightweights.
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:21.559]  They're cowards.
[01:48:21.559 --> 01:48:22.680]  They finally did a decent defense.
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:25.559]  They should have had all the senators up there, all the House members.
[01:48:25.559 --> 01:48:29.559]  They should have had a big House defense team, not just some lawyers.
[01:48:29.559 --> 01:48:31.240]  But see, it's always the same.
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:32.600]  No one wants to defend Trump.
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:38.519]  It's like getting shot out of a cannon because no one wants to defend themselves.
[01:48:38.519 --> 01:48:39.320]  Think about that.
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:40.360]  You don't defend Trump.
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:41.480]  You don't defend yourself.
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:45.640]  People are like, oh, Jones getting rich because he supports Trump.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:48.920]  Man, before Trump got in, I had a lot more money in the bank.
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:52.360]  They've almost shut our ass down because I supported Trump and Trump wasn't perfect,
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:57.080]  but I supported him because I knew he meant well and he had enemies that were my enemies.
[01:48:59.559 --> 01:49:02.440]  That's the reason I got so pissed at one of our former talk show hosts.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:06.280]  He'd go on air and say that I was being nice to Trump because I'd made money off that.
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:07.880]  I didn't make any damn money off that.
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:10.040]  All I got was sued and persecuted.
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:11.160]  But here's the good news.
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:12.280]  Trump's gone now.
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:14.200]  We don't have him to blame for the problems.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:17.480]  Let's do something about Joe Biden and the new world order.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.960]  Let's do something about the globalists killing all these old people.
[01:49:22.519 --> 01:49:26.200]  You're like, well, they're getting Cuomo to scare all the other governors that did it.
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:27.960]  Greg Abbott did it too.
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:31.320]  They all followed the medical advice.
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:36.120]  Instead of Republican governors waiting to get in trouble for this,
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:37.480]  they should come out and say, I was misled.
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:38.440]  I was lied to.
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:39.960]  They should fall on their swords now.
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:41.960]  That's what America wants.
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:44.280]  All right.
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:47.000]  That's it for this Saturday transmission.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.760]  I appreciate the crew coming in and getting us done.
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:51.880]  We're going to re-loop this now that we're not streaming out live.
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.760]  And it's going to be posted at Bandoff Video.
[01:49:56.290 --> 01:50:00.010]  Are we going to save the children?
[01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:01.010]  Are we going to save the old people?
[01:50:01.010 --> 01:50:03.330]  Are we going to save the already born children they're killing?
[01:50:03.330 --> 01:50:04.330]  Are we going to save ourselves?
[01:50:04.330 --> 01:50:10.010]  Are we going to get a territorialism again, a consciousness, a will to defend ourselves
[01:50:10.010 --> 01:50:11.010]  again?
[01:50:11.010 --> 01:50:12.010]  Are we going to do it?
[01:50:12.010 --> 01:50:14.510]  Let's see.
[01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:16.530]  Take this and re-upload it on Facebook and Twitter.
[01:50:16.530 --> 01:50:19.530]  So what do they ban you?
[01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:20.530]  Put it under a new dummy account.
[01:50:20.530 --> 01:50:21.530]  I don't care.
[01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:27.370]  Your email, your text messages, whatever, fight back now or roll over and die.
[01:50:27.370 --> 01:50:31.330]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death and the choice is death.
[01:50:31.330 --> 01:50:33.070]  These people are coming to kill us.
[01:50:33.070 --> 01:50:37.170]  They're certainly going to kill off all the old and if you think God is going to recognize
[01:50:37.170 --> 01:50:42.210]  you, if you don't stand up, you're a fool and then believe me, you got a spirit.
[01:50:42.210 --> 01:50:44.650]  You better know that's real.
[01:50:44.650 --> 01:50:50.690]  As above, so below, ladies and gentlemen, I'm telling you right now, this is your choice
[01:50:50.690 --> 01:50:53.890]  and your chance to really stand up for humanity and I need you.
[01:50:53.890 --> 01:50:55.050]  I can't do this without you.
[01:50:55.050 --> 01:50:56.530]  I need you.
[01:50:56.530 --> 01:50:58.290]  You are everything.
[01:50:58.290 --> 01:51:03.530]  We're just one little flashpoint, a match that lights the forest on fire.
[01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:05.010]  That forest of lies and tyranny.
[01:51:05.010 --> 01:51:08.970]  We're going to burn this thing metaphysically down with God's love and justice, but it's
[01:51:08.970 --> 01:51:09.970]  up to you.
[01:51:09.970 --> 01:51:11.970]  So that's it for this transmission.
[01:51:11.970 --> 01:51:12.970]  Great job, the crew.
[01:51:12.970 --> 01:51:17.370]  Please go to infoworkstore.com and buy the products or we won't be on air.
[01:51:17.370 --> 01:51:18.370]  I'm in your hands.
[01:51:18.370 --> 01:51:19.510]  I need your support.
[01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:20.510]  You're in my hands.
[01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:23.510]  And again, I want to thank the crew for the great job they've done tonight.
[01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:26.310]  The first part of this particularly is incredibly important.
[01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:32.750]  COVID is a confirmed worldwide eugenics cover for euthanasia to not do all the regular medical
[01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:37.530]  stuff and let millions die of cancer, heart attacks, diabetes, when all the big actuary
[01:51:37.530 --> 01:51:40.230]  banks and insurance companies make record profits.
[01:51:40.230 --> 01:51:41.230]  That's all admitted.
[01:51:41.230 --> 01:51:42.910]  Governments don't have to pay for all the old people.
[01:51:42.910 --> 01:51:43.910]  They keep the money.
[01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:47.830]  And then it sets the precedent to corrupt the hospitals to start killing people and
[01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:49.870]  not give it a medical treatment.
[01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:54.330]  I mean, this is a takeover and this is a test to see what you're going to do.
[01:51:54.330 --> 01:51:56.970]  And if you roll over to it thinking, Oh, they'll leave us alone.
[01:51:56.970 --> 01:51:57.970]  We just roll over.
[01:51:57.970 --> 01:52:00.550]  No baby, no sweetheart.
[01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:02.390]  It's going to get a lot worse.
[01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:06.550]  And I'm going to explain one more thing.
[01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:10.670]  As I started this show, I'm scared because God's pissed off and I can feel it.
[01:52:10.670 --> 01:52:15.010]  I'm not scared of David Rockefeller who's rotting in hell or John McCain who's rotting
[01:52:15.010 --> 01:52:16.010]  in hell.
[01:52:16.190 --> 01:52:18.790]  I'm not scared of Bill Gates who'll be rotting in hell soon enough.
[01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:20.070]  I'm not scared of them, man.
[01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:25.150]  I am really upset for humanity that we've let it get this far this fast.
[01:52:25.150 --> 01:52:27.670]  And this is the main assault.
[01:52:27.670 --> 01:52:29.550]  So you better get right with God right now.
[01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:30.550]  All right.
[01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:31.550]  That's it for this transmission.
[01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:32.550]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:39.590]  Share those links or bow down to the New World Order and worship Satan and die.
[01:52:39.610 --> 01:52:44.890]  During his inauguration speech, Joe Biden spoke of confronting and defeating domestic
[01:52:44.890 --> 01:52:45.890]  terrorism.
[01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:53.690]  A rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and
[01:52:53.690 --> 01:52:57.690]  we will defeat.
[01:52:57.690 --> 01:53:04.810]  John Brennan, former director of the CIA, went on MSNBC that evening and labeled libertarians
[01:53:04.810 --> 01:53:06.090]  as domestic terrorists.
[01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:12.090]  I know looking forward that the members of the Biden team who have been nominated or
[01:53:12.090 --> 01:53:17.670]  have been appointed are now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much as they
[01:53:17.670 --> 01:53:23.590]  can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that we've seen overseas, where
[01:53:23.590 --> 01:53:28.190]  they germinate in different parts of the country and they gain strength and it brings together
[01:53:28.190 --> 01:53:35.910]  an unholy alliance frequently of religious extremists, authoritarian, fascists, bigots,
[01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:39.090]  racists, nativists, even libertarians.
[01:53:39.090 --> 01:53:45.010]  A libertarian is a supporter of a political philosophy that advocates minimal state intervention
[01:53:45.010 --> 01:53:52.030]  in the free market and the private lives of citizens, a person who advocates civil liberty.
[01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:59.690]  But now in America, a libertarian is a terrorist, a Trump supporter is a terrorist, a constitutional
[01:53:59.690 --> 01:54:02.250]  American is a terrorist.
[01:54:02.250 --> 01:54:09.810]  Make no mistake, tyranny has arrived in America and history tells us what comes next.
[01:54:09.810 --> 01:54:13.950]  The tyrants will now go after all political dissidents.
[01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:18.070]  There was a time when the liberal media supported democracy and freedom.
[01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:23.470]  During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the American media seemed to recognize the
[01:54:23.470 --> 01:54:25.950]  dangers of the CCP.
[01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:33.090]  But now, along with Hollywood and major sports, the news media is all owned by globalist multinational
[01:54:33.090 --> 01:54:35.970]  corporations and the CCP.
[01:54:35.970 --> 01:54:41.590]  The pop culture media machine has made all of this possible and it is now busy preparing
[01:54:41.590 --> 01:54:46.730]  their brainwashed flock for mass arrests and reeducation camps.
[01:54:46.730 --> 01:54:51.510]  A Bernie Sanders staffer and the principal counsel for PBS were separately caught on
[01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:57.430]  camera calling for rounding up Trump supporters and putting them in reeducation camps.
[01:54:57.430 --> 01:55:00.130]  But that was before Biden was in the White House.
[01:55:00.130 --> 01:55:03.050]  Now it's all out in the open.
[01:55:03.050 --> 01:55:08.790]  Popular Morning television co-host Meghan McCain, daughter of John McCain, who funded
[01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:14.950]  ISIS and al-Qaeda in the ongoing war on terror debacle, says that American patriots need
[01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:17.970]  to be treated the same as al-Qaeda terrorists.
[01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:24.270]  Our domestic terrorists who attacked our own republic, they should be treated the same
[01:55:24.270 --> 01:55:25.630]  way we treat al-Qaeda.
[01:55:25.630 --> 01:55:32.750]  MSNBC's Nicole Wallace suggests the possibility of killing Americans with drone strikes.
[01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:39.150]  Attacking terrorism at its root, of going after and killing, and in the case of Amr al-Awlaki,
[01:55:39.150 --> 01:55:44.510]  an American, a Yemeni American, with a drone strike for the crime of inciting violence,
[01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:45.830]  inciting terrorism.
[01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:52.110]  Regional Director of California Democrats unapologetically suggests rounding up 75 million
[01:55:52.110 --> 01:55:56.230]  Americans and putting them in concentration camps.
[01:55:56.230 --> 01:56:01.230]  Americans are now being psychologically prepared for the rounding up, brainwashing, torture
[01:56:01.230 --> 01:56:04.150]  and mass murder of American patriots.
[01:56:04.150 --> 01:56:09.670]  It is critical that the FBI does launch the largest manhunt in U.S. history, drag all
[01:56:09.670 --> 01:56:15.070]  of these people into prison, and if they're inside the Capitol for a full 20 years for
[01:56:15.070 --> 01:56:17.950]  committing sedition against the United States of America.
[01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:23.550]  The question is, how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed
[01:56:23.550 --> 01:56:26.190]  up for the cult of Trump?
[01:56:26.190 --> 01:56:32.950]  Almost all white, almost all Republicans, who somehow need to be deprogrammed.
[01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:37.110]  Once we educate them, we coach them on how to interact.
[01:56:37.110 --> 01:56:44.309]  We probably need to double, triple, quadruple, or increase funding for these de-radicalization
[01:56:44.309 --> 01:56:45.309]  programs.
[01:56:45.309 --> 01:56:51.630]  Biden's press secretary announces how leftist NGOs will be involved in performing threat
[01:56:51.630 --> 01:56:58.710]  assessments on domestic terrorists, meaning if you oppose their Marxist ideology, you
[01:56:58.710 --> 01:57:00.510]  are a threat to them.
[01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:03.230]  This is all part of the leftist playbook.
[01:57:03.230 --> 01:57:07.030]  The Weather Underground was planning for this in the 1970s.
[01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:13.950]  They felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing
[01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:21.190]  re-education centers in the Southwest, where we would take all the people who needed to
[01:57:21.190 --> 01:57:28.710]  be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be.
[01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:33.270]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate, that
[01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:40.590]  are die-hard capitalists, and the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated, and when
[01:57:40.590 --> 01:57:45.350]  I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people
[01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:51.150]  in these re-education centers, and when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[01:57:51.150 --> 01:57:54.390]  It is now undeniably here.
[01:57:54.390 --> 01:58:03.510]  HR 127 will require psychological evaluations and a public database for all gun owners.
[01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:10.030]  With the entire nation divided into patriots and obedient cowards, they know who you are,
[01:58:10.030 --> 01:58:14.430]  and they know they have the support of the brainwashed masses.
[01:58:14.430 --> 01:58:20.390]  They have been preparing the entire world population with COVID-19.
[01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:27.230]  Almost a year ago, the WHO's Dr. Ryan announced that they will be entering people's homes
[01:58:27.230 --> 01:58:29.110]  and removing family members.
[01:58:29.110 --> 01:58:34.670]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove
[01:58:34.670 --> 01:58:38.730]  them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:42.410]  The leftists in power are ready to break our will.
[01:58:42.410 --> 01:58:47.510]  They will cut off the power, they will shut down our businesses, they will destroy anyone
[01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:54.250]  who stands in their way, and they are now vetting the military to weed out any patriots
[01:58:54.250 --> 01:59:00.370]  who might have a problem with the unlawful mass arrests of American citizens.
[01:59:00.370 --> 01:59:06.470]  And you can be sure that at least one major false flag, if not several, is already being
[01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:11.190]  planned to act as the catalyst for all of this.
[01:59:11.190 --> 01:59:18.830]  Another Oklahoma City bombing to blame on libertarian terrorists and American constitutionalists.
[01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:21.830]  The new war on domestic terror is beginning.
[01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:24.070]  Don't expect it to go slowly.
[01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:29.510]  If you are not making decisions and actions today as if your very life depends on it,
[01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:31.990]  then you are still asleep in the matrix.
[01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:34.350]  Wake up before it's too late.
[01:59:34.350 --> 01:59:36.590]  That day is coming fast.
[01:59:36.590 --> 01:59:39.150]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reiss.
