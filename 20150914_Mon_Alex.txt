[01:24.880 --> 01:28.800]  realities we're going to talk in depth about what he has to say about that we're
[01:28.800 --> 01:33.360]  also going to look at economic news this week the federal reserve is going to
[01:33.360 --> 01:37.040]  have their federal open market committee meet on thursday they're going to
[01:37.040 --> 01:40.080]  announce whether or not they're going to raise rates whether or not they're
[01:40.080 --> 01:46.080]  going to essentially nuke the world economy with a rate hike and we're
[01:46.080 --> 01:49.040]  going to talk about what's behind that of course we're setting new records in
[01:49.040 --> 01:54.400]  the united states we have new record tax revenue still not enough to cover the
[01:54.400 --> 01:58.880]  expenses of our government you understand that since the income tax in
[01:58.880 --> 02:01.520]  federal reserve were created approximately the same time about a
[02:01.520 --> 02:07.040]  hundred years ago we've essentially been on interest only payments to the
[02:07.040 --> 02:12.160]  federal reserve this is kind of like the negative mortgage that they sell to
[02:12.160 --> 02:14.640]  people who retired they don't have any income stream or they have an
[02:14.640 --> 02:18.240]  insufficient income stream so say hey you've got equity in your home
[02:18.240 --> 02:22.560]  we'll pay you instead of you paying us we'll pay you on a monthly basis and
[02:22.560 --> 02:26.640]  then each month you lose equity in your home well that's what's been going on
[02:26.640 --> 02:31.920]  with the united states for a hundred years are they ready to take it over
[02:31.920 --> 02:36.480]  we'll shut we shall see but we have a two let's see i have to look at this i
[02:36.480 --> 02:40.480]  think that's two trillion maybe it's higher than two point eight trillion
[02:40.480 --> 02:44.320]  dollars in federal taxes set a record through august of course that's only
[02:44.320 --> 02:48.160]  about nineteen thousand dollars per worker federal workers make a lot more
[02:48.160 --> 02:52.400]  than nineteen thousand dollars don't they we all know that especially since
[02:52.400 --> 02:58.160]  obama got an office the number of people making large six figure salaries has
[02:58.160 --> 03:02.880]  skyrocketed under obama so we've got a giant deficit still have a five hundred
[03:02.880 --> 03:08.560]  and thirty billion dollar deficit and of course we're dropping like a rock on
[03:08.560 --> 03:13.840]  economic freedom we're now down to number sixteen and it was just in two
[03:13.840 --> 03:18.480]  thousand that we were second on the list of economic freedom we're going to talk
[03:18.480 --> 03:23.440]  about the metrics of that of course we now have a leader of the party in
[03:23.440 --> 03:30.000]  britain the labor party in britain who is an avowed marxist and he is singing
[03:30.000 --> 03:37.360]  the red flag as he takes the position of leader of the labor party in britain
[03:37.360 --> 03:42.160]  and we see bernie sanders moving up ahead of hillary clinton
[03:42.160 --> 03:46.080]  i'm fine with bernie sanders moving ahead at least we know where he's coming
[03:46.080 --> 03:50.480]  from hillary clinton talks like she's uh something different she'll she'll talk
[03:50.480 --> 03:56.400]  about socialist policies anything but she's really part of the uh neocon
[03:56.400 --> 04:02.560]  globalist full-on war party at least uh the guy who is a marxist in britain
[04:02.560 --> 04:05.840]  says that he doesn't want war we'll see about that
[04:05.840 --> 04:11.600]  we saw how the greek leader who was a very leftist very marxist
[04:11.600 --> 04:16.000]  leader in greece betrayed the people there to the bankers
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.080]  we've seen that we we need to remember we look at these marxists who say that
[04:20.080 --> 04:23.680]  they're going to save everybody from these rapacious capitalists we need to
[04:23.680 --> 04:29.520]  understand your history understand that lennon was sent by
[04:29.520 --> 04:35.120]  german bankers with ten million dollars in a gold in a in a sealed train ten
[04:35.120 --> 04:38.800]  million dollars in gold to start the russian revolution
[04:38.800 --> 04:42.960]  he was started by the central bankers the same guys that were creating the
[04:42.960 --> 04:46.720]  federal reserve in america stay with us we've got a lot of news we got more
[04:46.720 --> 04:50.400]  news about the iran deal do treaties really matter and of course some updates
[04:50.400 --> 04:53.680]  on the election we'll be right back
[04:58.960 --> 05:02.640]  did you know that only six corporations control
[05:02.640 --> 05:08.960]  ninety percent of what millions of americans see here and read every single day
[05:08.960 --> 05:14.080]  it's the illusion of choice think about it the mainstream media is owned by only
[05:14.080 --> 05:19.040]  a handful of mega corporations with vested interests but on the other hand
[05:19.040 --> 05:24.160]  the internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources so you can
[05:24.160 --> 05:29.680]  research information for yourself from multiple sources or you can blindly
[05:29.680 --> 05:34.160]  accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media never questioning
[05:34.160 --> 05:37.200]  what you are being told this gives you a false
[05:37.200 --> 05:41.360]  sense of reality i mean do you actually know what you think you know
[05:41.360 --> 05:45.280]  or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version
[05:45.280 --> 05:50.080]  of events think about it this is darin mcbreen and i want you to break the

[08:23.520 --> 08:27.520]  welcome to the alex jones show on this monday september 13th 2015
[08:27.520 --> 08:31.280]  i said at the top of the hour the day was january 13th i was a Freudian slept
[08:31.280 --> 08:34.320]  that's my anniversary i'm sure my wife was laughing about that
[08:34.320 --> 08:37.520]  jolly's teases me about forgetting our anniversary well i remembered it dear
[08:37.520 --> 08:41.600]  but it's uh nine months late nevertheless it's the monday september
[08:41.600 --> 08:46.560]  the 13th 2015 we have 14th okay we're gonna get
[08:46.560 --> 08:50.400]  there eventually um it's september 14th and it is
[08:50.400 --> 08:54.160]  monday okay and i am david knight and we've got some news let's talk about the
[08:54.160 --> 08:58.960]  economic news we now have the u.s dropping to 16th on the economic
[08:58.960 --> 09:02.800]  freedom list we're now behind canada chili and new zealand
[09:02.800 --> 09:06.560]  hong kong many others how do they determine this
[09:06.560 --> 09:10.560]  ranking well one of the things that may help us is the fact that we are now
[09:10.560 --> 09:16.720]  getting federal record and taxes 2.8 trillion dollars that's
[09:16.720 --> 09:20.720]  still 530 billion dollars short as i said in the last
[09:20.720 --> 09:25.520]  segment we have been on an interest-only payment essentially a reverse
[09:25.520 --> 09:28.640]  mortgage since they created the federal reserve
[09:28.640 --> 09:33.360]  and charged us interest for every one of the pieces of paper that they create
[09:33.360 --> 09:36.880]  will the bank start to call that loan now we'll have to see because they're
[09:36.880 --> 09:40.720]  going to meet this thursday they could very well raise interest rates and
[09:40.720 --> 09:43.600]  everyone is very concerned about what that's going to do let's talk about
[09:43.600 --> 09:47.200]  some of the economic news as they point out we now rank 16th in the world we
[09:47.200 --> 09:51.680]  were second in 2000 that's what bush and obama have
[09:51.680 --> 09:54.320]  done for us we've been dropping like a rock
[09:54.320 --> 09:57.440]  what are the variables that they use to determine this well they got 42 different
[09:57.440 --> 10:00.480]  variables they rank 157 different countries
[10:00.480 --> 10:04.480]  one of the things that they look at is the weakened rule of law
[10:04.480 --> 10:08.160]  the so-called war on terrorism and drugs what would that be well that's going to
[10:08.160 --> 10:11.760]  be asset forfeiture the fact that they can just
[10:11.760 --> 10:17.440]  seize your property at will never charging you with a crime
[10:17.440 --> 10:21.440]  never never arresting you never asserting that you did anything wrong
[10:21.440 --> 10:24.080]  just seizing your property charging the property
[10:24.080 --> 10:27.520]  with being an accessory to an imagined crime
[10:27.520 --> 10:30.640]  and then you have to sue them to try to get it back
[10:30.640 --> 10:34.320]  not very many countries have that law i don't know any countries that do
[10:34.320 --> 10:38.000]  have that kind of law except for the united states and of course it is in
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.160]  direct conflict with the constitution but who cares about the constitution
[10:42.160 --> 10:45.120]  anymore right also a confused regulatory environment they
[10:45.120 --> 10:48.240]  say have helped to erode economic freedom in the united states
[10:48.240 --> 10:52.160]  which remains behind canada and more economically free countries like
[10:52.160 --> 10:56.080]  cutter jordan and the united arab emirates yeah
[10:56.080 --> 10:59.360]  there we go we're sinking to third world status
[10:59.360 --> 11:03.200]  we are becoming a banana republic with nuclear weapons that's what the united
[11:03.200 --> 11:07.040]  states is turning into the top 10 number one was hong kong and i
[11:07.040 --> 11:10.160]  remember when we were in hong kong about nine years
[11:10.160 --> 11:14.320]  ago adopting my daughter i looked at the money and
[11:14.320 --> 11:17.360]  the different denominations that we look at the same
[11:17.360 --> 11:20.960]  denomination same amount of money hong kong dollar and it was very different
[11:20.960 --> 11:23.840]  from one bill to the other and so i started looking at it closely and i
[11:23.840 --> 11:28.240]  realized these were being issued by private banks
[11:28.240 --> 11:31.840]  not by a central bank but that's very interesting
[11:31.840 --> 11:35.440]  because that's the way we used to do it in the united states before we had
[11:35.440 --> 11:38.480]  a central bank so there's other ways to do it
[11:38.480 --> 11:46.560]  and if it's done by individual banks they have to have reserves to back that up
[11:46.560 --> 11:51.280]  which our banks today don't really have reserves as a matter of fact we have a
[11:51.280 --> 11:55.360]  a article up on info wars dot com a bank in russia was caught using
[11:55.360 --> 12:00.560]  fake gold as reserve capital there and this is an article from zero hedge he
[12:00.560 --> 12:04.080]  says over the past several years incidents involving fake gold usually
[12:04.080 --> 12:07.920]  in the form of gold plated tungsten have emerged every so often usually
[12:07.920 --> 12:11.280]  involving manhattan jewelry district or some
[12:11.280 --> 12:16.240]  gold foundries or a bullion dealer but never have they found it in a bank
[12:16.240 --> 12:20.320]  until this last friday when russia's admiralty bank
[12:20.320 --> 12:24.240]  they discovered that they were using gold plated metal
[12:24.240 --> 12:27.280]  as part of their gold reserves and this was not a large bank
[12:27.280 --> 12:32.000]  this was they say a relatively small bank it was ranked number 289
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.560]  in russian banks in terms of assets but of course it raises a question if that's
[12:36.560 --> 12:39.440]  happening to that bank how many other banks in russia
[12:39.440 --> 12:43.520]  are doing that and how many banks globally are doing that
[12:43.520 --> 12:48.000]  well that's an interesting question because zero hedge also has an article
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.840]  about peter hambrough saying it is virtually impossible to get
[12:51.840 --> 12:57.760]  physical gold in london now he and ronan manly have both
[12:57.760 --> 13:01.120]  both pointed out that there's very little physical gold left in london
[13:01.120 --> 13:04.720]  and here's a quote they say my baseline is that the chinese have been buying
[13:04.720 --> 13:08.880]  and the indians have been buying in enormous quantities
[13:08.880 --> 13:13.600]  and it is virtually impossible to get physical gold they can pass the little
[13:13.600 --> 13:18.000]  bits of paper around it also makes us think back to
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.120]  several articles over the last couple of years remember germany
[13:21.120 --> 13:24.880]  other countries have said that they want to repatriate the gold
[13:24.880 --> 13:28.960]  from the new york federal reserve they said uh yeah okay
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.480]  give us several years to do that they put them off
[13:32.480 --> 13:36.480]  it almost makes you wonder whether they've got that uh in their reserves
[13:36.480 --> 13:40.720]  at the federal reserve as well we also have texas that is trying to
[13:40.720 --> 13:44.320]  get its gold back from new york uh we haven't gotten it back yet
[13:44.320 --> 13:47.760]  the only state that has done some and i think this is very interesting other
[13:47.760 --> 13:51.120]  states should try to do this as well they're talking about setting up a
[13:51.120 --> 13:54.160]  gold repository here in texas where we would hold our own
[13:54.160 --> 13:57.840]  physical gold and people could deposit gold there as well
[13:57.840 --> 14:01.680]  and draw against it that's what's going to have to happen
[14:01.680 --> 14:06.000]  we're going to have to have honest money that we can trust
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.560]  and we don't have that right now because we have a federal reserve system
[14:10.560 --> 14:14.320]  that can raise and lower interest rates at will
[14:14.320 --> 14:17.840]  that's what they've been doing for 100 years that's what we were warned about
[14:17.840 --> 14:20.880]  when they created them many people spoke out about it many congressmen and
[14:20.880 --> 14:25.760]  senators at the time uh linberg's father was uh in congress and he
[14:25.760 --> 14:31.120]  said had a famous quote talking about how with the control of
[14:31.120 --> 14:34.000]  interest rates with the control of money supply
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.520]  they could create boom and bust cycles at will
[14:37.520 --> 14:42.080]  they could make fortunes by shorting the market by uh buying into the market
[14:42.080 --> 14:46.400]  before it goes up they could time economic boom and bust cycles and
[14:46.400 --> 14:51.600]  create those cycles now zero hedge points out
[14:51.600 --> 14:55.680]  that in the 110 months since the last fed hike this was over the last
[14:55.680 --> 14:59.520]  several years global central banks have cut
[14:59.520 --> 15:05.680]  interest rates 697 times hear that they've cut interest rates
[15:05.680 --> 15:09.760]  697 times collectively the central banks
[15:09.760 --> 15:15.200]  now we have brought in 15 trillion dollars a financial asset so they just
[15:15.200 --> 15:19.600]  created out of nowhere zero or negative interest rate policies
[15:19.600 --> 15:22.800]  have been adopted throughout the west and asia
[15:22.800 --> 15:25.920]  us europe japan and following the great financial crisis
[15:25.920 --> 15:29.760]  of 2008 he says both stocks and corporate bonds have
[15:29.760 --> 15:33.360]  soared to an all-time high thanks in great part
[15:33.360 --> 15:39.920]  to the extraordinary monetary regime there we go that's what they have done
[15:39.920 --> 15:44.080]  and of course if you remember what happened with the bubble that burst
[15:44.080 --> 15:50.480]  in 2007 2008 that followed a long period of a
[15:50.480 --> 15:54.160]  rope-a-dope move by the federal reserve by ellen greenspan
[15:54.160 --> 15:59.120]  lowering interest rates consecutively i i forget how many times it was it was
[15:59.120 --> 16:02.480]  like a dozens of times they had lowered interest rates
[16:02.480 --> 16:05.760]  and then they changed it and they continued to raise interest rates
[16:05.760 --> 16:09.200]  raise interest rates raise interest rates until it imploded
[16:09.200 --> 16:13.200]  now they're looking at possibly doing it uh this week
[16:13.200 --> 16:18.080]  and of course if they do it uh it's going to have a tremendous
[16:18.080 --> 16:21.120]  impact that's what people are talking about they say us interest rates
[16:21.120 --> 16:24.480]  could trigger a global debt crisis this is the
[16:24.480 --> 16:28.320]  uk's telegraph they say debt ratios have reached extreme levels
[16:28.320 --> 16:32.480]  across all major regions of the global economy leaving the financial system
[16:32.480 --> 16:36.240]  acutely vulnerable to monetary tightening by the u.s federal reserve
[16:36.240 --> 16:40.080]  the world's top financial watchdog has warned and of course
[16:40.080 --> 16:44.160]  many financial analysts uh some biblical prophecy people have pointed out
[16:44.160 --> 16:47.840]  that they're very concerned about a repeating pattern a timing pattern
[16:47.840 --> 16:51.600]  people look at market timing to analyze data people who look at biblical
[16:51.600 --> 16:55.840]  prophecies are all pointed to september as being the time that
[16:55.840 --> 16:59.120]  there might be some kind of a massive economic correction
[16:59.120 --> 17:03.200]  and of course that could all be triggered the the pen that burst the bubble
[17:03.200 --> 17:06.720]  could be the change in interest rates it could be something else but of course
[17:06.720 --> 17:10.160]  it is interest rates themselves that have triggered
[17:10.160 --> 17:14.560]  this financial bubble in the stock market most of this money
[17:14.560 --> 17:17.920]  that has been loaned out at zero percent and let me say this too
[17:17.920 --> 17:21.520]  when they say that the banks that were bailed out they say well we paid all
[17:21.520 --> 17:25.280]  that back we paid all that back you know they paid it back
[17:25.280 --> 17:28.800]  with money that they got at zero percent interest
[17:28.800 --> 17:33.680]  how hard is that to do do you and i get money at zero percent interest
[17:33.680 --> 17:36.720]  when you look at interest rates even though interest rates are relatively
[17:36.720 --> 17:40.560]  low for durable goods like homes and
[17:40.560 --> 17:44.000]  automobiles and that sort of thing they're incredibly high of course
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.520]  for credit card debt you're looking at
[17:47.520 --> 17:53.680]  15 25 and if you get the liquid it goes skies the limit on your interest rates
[17:53.680 --> 17:58.080]  it wasn't until the stagflation of jimmy carter
[17:58.080 --> 18:02.960]  that they took off the legal requirement that interest rates stay below 10
[18:02.960 --> 18:06.560]  percent it was considered to be usury if they
[18:06.560 --> 18:10.560]  took interest rates above 10 percent now that's the
[18:10.560 --> 18:14.240]  norm for anything that is unsecured but of course
[18:14.240 --> 18:19.200]  they get the money at zero percent what's the return
[18:19.200 --> 18:23.360]  if you get money at zero percent and you loan it out on a car loan at even
[18:23.360 --> 18:26.480]  let's say two or three percent a really good car loan you got great credit they
[18:26.480 --> 18:29.600]  loaned out to you two or three percent they get it for zero percent they loaned
[18:29.600 --> 18:33.040]  out for two or three percent you know when you divide by zero what do you get
[18:33.040 --> 18:37.520]  infinite infinite okay they've never seen
[18:37.520 --> 18:41.600]  the kind of returns on investment that the banks are getting now
[18:41.600 --> 18:45.280]  with these zero percent interest rates it's worse
[18:45.280 --> 18:48.560]  than what the mob you said usury loan sharking
[18:48.560 --> 18:52.480]  that used to be the territory of the mob but of course the banks
[18:52.480 --> 18:55.920]  are very indistinguishable from the mob anymore the large banks we're talking
[18:55.920 --> 19:00.480]  about of course we've had them laundering money for drug cartels
[19:00.480 --> 19:03.680]  we've had them laundering money for terrorists and we're told that they're
[19:03.680 --> 19:08.240]  too big to jail they're also too big to be held to the
[19:08.240 --> 19:12.160]  standards of reason anymore and that is you we
[19:12.160 --> 19:15.200]  need to bring back the usury laws they're talking about bringing back glass
[19:15.200 --> 19:19.520]  seagull many people say we need to divest the banks from getting involved in
[19:19.520 --> 19:24.880]  speculative business i agree but let's also bring back the usury laws
[19:24.880 --> 19:29.520]  it's absolutely immoral the interest rates that banks are charging
[19:29.520 --> 19:32.960]  consumers and they can raise those interest rates on you if they merely
[19:32.960 --> 19:36.800]  assert that you've had something difficult in your background
[19:36.800 --> 19:41.040]  finally this last issue before we go to break maldova 20 000 people stage an
[19:41.040 --> 19:45.280]  anti-government protest for eight days demanding a probe into a missing one
[19:45.280 --> 19:49.440]  and a half billion dollars how about we demand a probe into the missing
[19:49.440 --> 19:53.040]  trillions of dollars in the united states instead we just focus on our
[19:53.040 --> 19:59.360]  celebrity big brother election stay with us we'll be right back

[20:02.640 --> 20:05.600]  threes is a good idea but did you know that about 60 percent of

[20:08.640 --> 20:13.280]  fish oil products contain only about 25 omega threes and the remaining 75
[20:13.280 --> 20:17.120]  percent is undesirable fish fat heck did you know that more than 90 percent of

[24:26.720 --> 24:31.920]  september the 14th 2015 this wednesday we are going to have a
[24:31.920 --> 24:34.480]  money bomb we haven't done this for a couple of years
[24:34.480 --> 24:39.040]  we have a goal of reaching a million 400 million people
[24:39.040 --> 24:42.800]  with one million dollars of contributions from you that's why we're
[24:42.800 --> 24:46.400]  doing this money bomb we're doing it for 27 hours
[24:46.400 --> 24:49.840]  in the middle of the money bomb we're going to have a coverage of the debate
[24:49.840 --> 24:52.720]  but this is going to be around the clock we're going to have special guests we're
[24:52.720 --> 24:55.600]  going to have special auctions it's something that i think you'll find
[24:55.600 --> 24:58.800]  very informative as well as entertaining
[24:58.800 --> 25:03.040]  but you have to understand that we need to move this to the next level
[25:03.040 --> 25:07.520]  we've already started our programs our radio show as well as nightly news as
[25:07.520 --> 25:11.840]  already started on access tv it's also available on
[25:11.840 --> 25:16.320]  roku and other platforms we're trying to get this however to
[25:16.320 --> 25:19.600]  satellite coverage and you can see the map that we'll pull up here if you're
[25:19.600 --> 25:22.080]  watching this so that point out we're trying to
[25:22.080 --> 25:27.200]  reach 400 million people via this satellite placement
[25:27.200 --> 25:30.480]  this is something info wars is not beholden to anyone we've never taken
[25:30.480 --> 25:34.240]  alone we don't rely on advertising from companies that sell
[25:34.240 --> 25:36.560]  things that we would not agree with that are
[25:36.560 --> 25:40.160]  globalist friendly companies we run a very tight ship here
[25:40.160 --> 25:43.680]  and your contributions the things that you buy the products that you buy from
[25:43.680 --> 25:49.280]  us at info wars life.com as well as this crowdfunding effort are
[25:49.280 --> 25:53.040]  the way that we fund our operation on a daily basis the way that we expand and
[25:53.040 --> 25:55.520]  so we're going to try to expand this operation
[25:55.520 --> 25:58.400]  into a larger footprint that's why we're going to have this
[25:58.400 --> 26:03.760]  money bomb for i think it's 27 hours we're going to be on the air
[26:03.760 --> 26:07.600]  beginning this wednesday with the radio show beginning with alex jones
[26:07.600 --> 26:13.680]  on wednesday at 11 central again we're 100 crowdfunded and we do appreciate the
[26:13.680 --> 26:17.360]  way that you have helped us to grow we could not have done this without your
[26:17.360 --> 26:20.480]  support without you standing behind us and it's
[26:20.480 --> 26:22.480]  very important you know there's an article that
[26:22.480 --> 26:26.000]  came out today about apple news and of course with the new operating system
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.040]  that's coming out this week with ios 9 apple is offering an app
[26:31.040 --> 26:35.360]  that is going to essentially aggregate the news for you
[26:35.360 --> 26:38.560]  they want to take over drudge's position essentially you know drudge has been
[26:38.560 --> 26:43.680]  called america's editor and he has a very important
[26:43.680 --> 26:47.760]  position there because he selects pertinent news
[26:47.760 --> 26:51.600]  entertaining news as well as things that people
[26:51.600 --> 26:55.840]  did not hear when there wasn't a drudge report around
[26:55.840 --> 27:00.240]  and they want to replace this with a news aggregator it's not just apple there's
[27:00.240 --> 27:03.120]  other ways that they're trying to do this but apple is
[27:03.120 --> 27:06.560]  is one of the premier one the first ones out of the gate
[27:06.560 --> 27:10.400]  google and others have similar things planned down the line
[27:10.400 --> 27:14.400]  they want to give control back to the mainstream media they want to make sure
[27:14.400 --> 27:18.400]  that you don't see stories about certain issues
[27:18.400 --> 27:21.840]  now just look at the debates that we have the so-called debates and they're not
[27:21.840 --> 27:25.440]  debates i mean when you look at the uh meghan kelly question to
[27:25.440 --> 27:28.720]  donald trump the very first thing out of the gate is a lot of people say you
[27:28.720 --> 27:32.400]  don't like women let's talk about that we don't have any
[27:32.400 --> 27:36.480]  questions about the constitution we don't have any questions about the rule of
[27:36.480 --> 27:40.320]  law about police brutality nothing about that
[27:40.320 --> 27:43.360]  we don't have questions about nsa spying
[27:43.360 --> 27:47.280]  simply the same questions that we get every four years
[27:47.280 --> 27:50.960]  over and over again how many jobs are you going to create for us
[27:50.960 --> 27:55.520]  how many wars can you start to make us safer
[27:55.520 --> 27:59.920]  it's absolute nonsense but that's the kind of dumbed down
[27:59.920 --> 28:03.680]  and i call it big brother celebrity uh big brother is really what we've got
[28:03.680 --> 28:06.720]  going with this election cycle that's precisely what you're going to get in
[28:06.720 --> 28:10.800]  the news if you don't have outlets like drudge if you don't have
[28:10.800 --> 28:15.520]  outlets like info wars and the info wars nightly news that we're trying to
[28:15.520 --> 28:19.600]  extend now tonight there's something that's going to be i think a very
[28:19.600 --> 28:21.840]  important discussion we should talk about this a little bit this is an
[28:21.840 --> 28:25.920]  article that came out this weekend new york times talking about the supreme
[28:25.920 --> 28:32.720]  court justice briars a view of global law he's going to be on
[28:32.720 --> 28:36.880]  cobear's uh late show tonight talking about his book and here's the title of
[28:36.880 --> 28:40.960]  the book the court and the world american law
[28:40.960 --> 28:46.240]  and new global realities and they say this book is likely to revive a debate
[28:46.240 --> 28:49.120]  that roiled the court a decade ago when justice
[28:49.120 --> 28:53.840]  kennedy cited decisions from foreign and international bodies
[28:53.840 --> 28:57.600]  and major gay rights and death penalty cases they say that he voked
[28:57.600 --> 29:02.160]  strongly adverse political reactions that's what justice briar writes in his
[29:02.160 --> 29:07.200]  book including calls for impeachment as it should
[29:07.200 --> 29:11.680]  this is judicial activism taken to the next level
[29:11.680 --> 29:14.880]  and of course they're not interested in the constitution that they
[29:14.880 --> 29:19.280]  swore allegiance to they're not interested in interpreting the
[29:19.280 --> 29:22.640]  constitution and looking at the laws that congress has

[33:30.640 --> 33:34.400]  presidential election it looks like the cult of personality on the left
[33:34.400 --> 33:38.240]  has now become the cult of personality on the right
[33:38.240 --> 33:41.680]  we're going to talk about that later but i want to get back to what i was just
[33:41.680 --> 33:45.680]  talking about in the last segment and that is the book
[33:45.680 --> 33:49.920]  that is being put out by justice brier he'll be plugging that tonight on the
[33:49.920 --> 33:54.560]  late show with steven cobert and as i read in the last segment he says
[33:54.560 --> 33:59.920]  that when they cited decisions when kennedy a decade ago cited in some of
[33:59.920 --> 34:04.320]  the supreme court decisions foreign and international bodies of law
[34:04.320 --> 34:08.240]  in their supreme court decisions they said well that evoked strong adverse
[34:08.240 --> 34:11.120]  political reactions including calls for impeachment that's right
[34:11.120 --> 34:15.040]  scalia has it right on this scalia says the basic premise of the court's
[34:15.040 --> 34:19.200]  argument that american law should conform to the laws of the rest of the
[34:19.200 --> 34:22.960]  world ought to be rejected out of hand it ought to be rejected
[34:22.960 --> 34:27.200]  by definition the constitution is what constitutes
[34:27.200 --> 34:32.320]  our law they're not set up there to sink our law with the laws of another
[34:32.320 --> 34:37.200]  country or with the laws the united nations or with the laws of islam
[34:37.200 --> 34:41.280]  we have a process and there is a process for writing laws
[34:41.280 --> 34:45.600]  and it doesn't include the supreme court there's a process for amending the
[34:45.600 --> 34:50.240]  constitution and it doesn't include the supreme court
[34:50.240 --> 34:54.640]  we need to obey the rule of law we need to obey the constitution because
[34:54.640 --> 34:59.680]  what is the alternative it isn't that we're worshiping some dead white men
[34:59.680 --> 35:03.840]  the alternative to the rule of law is dictatorship
[35:03.840 --> 35:08.960]  and we see that happening over and over again we see it happening with treaties
[35:08.960 --> 35:13.360]  take a look at the iran deal for example we have
[35:13.360 --> 35:17.280]  politico saying that after the iran deal obama is now going to pivot to climate
[35:17.280 --> 35:21.280]  change uh because of course he can do that
[35:21.280 --> 35:25.280]  he can say that the trans-pacific and transatlantic partnerships are not
[35:25.280 --> 35:29.920]  treaties they're simply agreements or their partnerships or whatever
[35:29.920 --> 35:33.520]  the iran deal is an agreement it's not a treaty
[35:33.520 --> 35:38.240]  baloney it is a treaty now people are starting to call them out on this as i
[35:38.240 --> 35:43.040]  mentioned yesterday uh justin amash uh says he poses the
[35:43.040 --> 35:47.280]  iran deal on the basis that it is a treaty
[35:47.280 --> 35:51.600]  and as a treaty there is a constitutional process that they need to go
[35:51.600 --> 35:56.480]  through to enact this treaty we need to understand that
[35:56.480 --> 36:00.800]  these trade treaties are treaties as well as we mentioned before
[36:00.800 --> 36:04.960]  nafta was called a trade agreement but now that it is passed
[36:04.960 --> 36:10.640]  we have uh account we have lawyer firms all over the world that are have set
[36:10.640 --> 36:16.640]  themselves up as treaty specialists who take the process of arbitration that
[36:16.640 --> 36:18.720]  was created very similar to what they're going to create
[36:18.720 --> 36:21.520]  with the transatlantic and trans-pacific partnership
[36:21.520 --> 36:25.440]  these kind of arbitration processes that elevate the companies
[36:25.440 --> 36:30.880]  to the level of government but they talk about that as treaty arbitration
[36:30.880 --> 36:35.440]  they talk about it as treaty laws everybody knows that by definition
[36:35.440 --> 36:38.400]  a treaty is an agreement between one or more countries
[36:38.400 --> 36:42.080]  about economics or about peace or whatever but that's one of the very
[36:42.080 --> 36:45.920]  first things that you have is the agreement about economics it's a
[36:45.920 --> 36:49.600]  classic statement of what a treaty is and so all these things are treaties
[36:49.600 --> 36:53.440]  calling them something else doesn't change it it just shows us
[36:53.440 --> 36:57.280]  that we're being lied to constantly that the constitution
[36:57.280 --> 37:03.120]  is nothing anymore but a veneer a mask that they use to rule
[37:03.120 --> 37:06.320]  now it's interesting that some of the people
[37:06.320 --> 37:12.080]  who have taken opposition to the iran treaty and are saying hey
[37:12.080 --> 37:15.360]  this is a treaty and we need to treat it as such
[37:15.360 --> 37:21.040]  some of the same people there's interesting movement by one congressman
[37:21.040 --> 37:25.120]  peter roscum out of illinois but actually i think he represents the sixth
[37:25.120 --> 37:29.200]  district of israel because he's saying that we need to restrain
[37:29.200 --> 37:34.480]  president obama's authority like we did with the
[37:34.480 --> 37:38.240]  the trade treaty he's saying that this is this is a
[37:38.240 --> 37:41.680]  treaty and we need to treat it as such we need to stop it and if you go back
[37:41.680 --> 37:45.200]  however a few months and you look at the passage of the trade promotion
[37:45.200 --> 37:48.960]  authority that's the fast track process remember that tpp
[37:48.960 --> 37:53.760]  has not come up for a vote yet and neither has the ttip the one with
[37:53.760 --> 37:57.120]  europe those have not come up for a vote what they did
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.200]  the fight was for the trade promotion authority because if that fast track
[38:01.200 --> 38:04.560]  passed and it did it is going to be virtually
[38:04.560 --> 38:08.080]  impossible to stop these international trade agreements
[38:08.080 --> 38:12.160]  now the same guy who is opposing the agreement with iran saying
[38:12.160 --> 38:15.200]  obama doesn't have the authority to do that this is a treaty he has to go
[38:15.200 --> 38:18.720]  through the constitutional process that same representative
[38:18.720 --> 38:22.560]  is a good indicator of the kind of hypocrisy that we've seen especially in
[38:22.560 --> 38:27.360]  the gop on this trade issue he comes back and he says
[38:27.360 --> 38:30.640]  when this is passed back in june he said today
[38:30.640 --> 38:34.560]  we acted to constrain president obama's authority
[38:34.560 --> 38:40.160]  really really you gave him the authority to do whatever he wanted when you pass
[38:40.160 --> 38:45.440]  the trade promotion authorization bill what you did was you completely took
[38:45.440 --> 38:50.160]  congress out of the process you took the senate out of the process
[38:50.160 --> 38:54.080]  and they did it in a very underhanded way
[38:54.080 --> 38:57.360]  what they did was they passed a law that said we are not going to treat this as
[38:57.360 --> 39:00.480]  a treaty we're not going to have amendments we're not going to have
[39:00.480 --> 39:04.800]  debate about this we'll have 20 hours of debate and then it'll be closed off
[39:04.800 --> 39:07.760]  we're not going to go through the normal process of introducing bills where it
[39:07.760 --> 39:10.800]  has to be introduced in committee or it has to be introduced on the floor by
[39:10.800 --> 39:13.760]  the leadership no it's going to automatically go there once the
[39:13.760 --> 39:17.680]  president and the corporate representatives have negotiated
[39:17.680 --> 39:20.080]  something actually i don't know the presidents even involve this is
[39:20.080 --> 39:24.080]  being negotiated by a few hundred corporate lawyers
[39:24.080 --> 39:28.160]  are creating these agreements and most people in government can't even see it
[39:28.160 --> 39:31.920]  perhaps the president can see it they're keeping it a secret from most
[39:31.920 --> 39:34.960]  congressmen they're saying they can't talk about it
[39:34.960 --> 39:38.640]  this is what they created and he said we acted to constrain
[39:38.640 --> 39:43.280]  obama's authority know what he did when they passed the tpa
[39:43.280 --> 39:47.520]  peter rossam the republican congressman from illinois
[39:47.520 --> 39:51.280]  what he did when he gave obama this trade authorization
[39:51.280 --> 39:53.600]  he said we don't care about the constitutional process we don't care
[39:53.600 --> 39:57.040]  about treaties you can do whatever you want now when he comes back with
[39:57.040 --> 40:01.600]  something about iran that he thinks affects his
[40:01.600 --> 40:05.120]  representative hit the people that are his constituents israel
[40:05.120 --> 40:08.800]  now he's got a problem with it see that's the problem when you throw away the
[40:08.800 --> 40:12.080]  rule of law when you wind up with a dictator
[40:12.080 --> 40:16.400]  you're not going to have a benevolent dictator and he's not going to do what
[40:16.400 --> 40:19.840]  you want in every one of these cases people on both
[40:19.840 --> 40:23.440]  the republican and the democrat side need to understand this and i'm not
[40:23.440 --> 40:26.560]  talking about the people who've been elected to office they
[40:26.560 --> 40:30.320]  very well understand that republican and democrat voters
[40:30.320 --> 40:33.360]  need to understand that we do not want to allow
[40:33.360 --> 40:37.200]  obama to operate as a dictator and we see this happening on
[40:37.200 --> 40:41.840]  issue after issue after issue of course the next one is going to be climate
[40:41.840 --> 40:46.480]  change he's going to negotiate something we got a massive push that is coming up
[40:46.480 --> 40:51.040]  with the the pope coming to america to sell climate change because
[40:51.040 --> 40:54.320]  that is what the pope is all about anymore he's not about traditional
[40:54.320 --> 40:58.400]  catholic values he has nothing to say about the redefinition of marriage of
[40:58.400 --> 41:00.240]  all things he has nothing to say about these
[41:00.240 --> 41:04.160]  planned parenthood videos on abortion but he is all over a climate change and
[41:04.160 --> 41:07.200]  world government he said that we need to have
[41:07.200 --> 41:10.560]  world government because that's the only way that we can stop climate change
[41:10.560 --> 41:14.080]  totally political and he's going to be coming to the united states
[41:14.080 --> 41:17.840]  this month there's a big push that is beginning to
[41:17.840 --> 41:22.160]  get this climate change legislation pushed through and i call it legislation
[41:22.160 --> 41:24.960]  it's not even legislation they're going to be dictates that are going to come
[41:24.960 --> 41:29.200]  through just like these trade agreements one of the things that i find
[41:29.200 --> 41:35.520]  interesting is that donald trump may be able to use his popularity to stop
[41:35.520 --> 41:38.160]  this i certainly hope that he can as many of you
[41:38.160 --> 41:40.960]  who've listened to me know i have a lot of problems
[41:40.960 --> 41:45.280]  with donald trump with some of his policies i don't like the way that
[41:45.280 --> 41:50.800]  he's running the campaign nevertheless he's extremely popular
[41:50.800 --> 41:55.840]  and he is opposed to the tpp not for the reasons that i would oppose it but i
[41:55.840 --> 41:59.920]  will take anything and we all should we should work with people who are with us
[41:59.920 --> 42:02.720]  on the issues even if they're not there
[42:02.720 --> 42:06.240]  the same reasons now of course the reason that donald trump doesn't like the tpp
[42:06.240 --> 42:10.160]  as he says he could do a better deal he doesn't trust obama as negotiator
[42:10.160 --> 42:12.560]  he says we're going to get nailed but he also
[42:12.560 --> 42:16.000]  points out and this is true senator sessions has and he's working with
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.600]  senator sessions this is an article that came out this last friday say the
[42:19.600 --> 42:24.080]  GOP's donald trump nightmare may soon get a whole lot worse
[42:24.080 --> 42:28.720]  donald trump met with senator jeff sessions and jeff sessions is the one
[42:28.720 --> 42:34.640]  who has done the lion's share of the research senators and congressmen can
[42:34.640 --> 42:38.960]  go look at the secretive agreements nobody has
[42:38.960 --> 42:42.480]  really bothered to do that other than a couple of congressmen
[42:42.480 --> 42:46.640]  rand paul has taken a look at it jeff sessions has looked at it but nobody has
[42:46.640 --> 42:51.360]  focused on this like senator sessions he set up charts telling other people as
[42:51.360 --> 42:55.120]  if they cared as if they didn't know his colleagues in the senate
[42:55.120 --> 42:59.360]  this is a massive transfer of sovereignty
[42:59.360 --> 43:03.040]  to a globalist a global governance commission
[43:03.040 --> 43:07.440]  he said this is a living document once this thing passes which we're not allowed
[43:07.440 --> 43:09.920]  to talk about we can't tell our constituents about
[43:09.920 --> 43:13.760]  once this thing passes they can change it at will without any further
[43:13.760 --> 43:16.880]  involvement from any of the democratically elected
[43:16.880 --> 43:20.560]  bodies of the nations involved they can also add
[43:20.560 --> 43:24.080]  anybody that they want to so while they're using china
[43:24.080 --> 43:28.080]  as a foil to try to get the tpp enacted saying that
[43:28.080 --> 43:32.240]  we need this because china is taking us to the cleaners on trade
[43:32.240 --> 43:35.920]  so we need the tpp as a counterbalance to china
[43:35.920 --> 43:39.680]  once they pass it they can add china without any problem
[43:39.680 --> 43:42.560]  anything can be changed as part of this agreement
[43:42.560 --> 43:47.200]  so donald trump met with jeff sessions and donald trump came out and said
[43:47.200 --> 43:51.360]  exactly that he said china can be added at any time
[43:51.360 --> 43:54.640]  very hopeful sign to see this happening i'm very excited
[43:54.640 --> 43:59.360]  to see donald trump throwing his popularity and his weight
[43:59.360 --> 44:03.760]  uh into opposing the tpp also we've got as i mentioned earlier
[44:03.760 --> 44:07.520]  uh justin amash opposing it he says under the treaty clause
[44:07.520 --> 44:11.200]  the president quote shall have power by and with the advice and the consent of
[44:11.200 --> 44:15.040]  the senate to make treaties provided two-thirds of the senators
[44:15.040 --> 44:18.320]  president concur he says the obama administration however
[44:18.320 --> 44:22.480]  asserts that the nuclear deal is merely an executive agreement that binds
[44:22.480 --> 44:25.360]  only the president and that of course is talking about the
[44:25.360 --> 44:29.280]  iran treaty because any of these treaties can be
[44:29.280 --> 44:35.840]  pressed that way so hopefully uh trump and sessions will push back against the
[44:35.840 --> 44:41.600]  gop on the tpp agreement one other area where we see some hope
[44:41.600 --> 44:46.960]  again is with john bainer you remember just before
[44:46.960 --> 44:52.000]  they went to recess representative mark meadows out of north carolina
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.640]  threw down the gauntlet as they point out in the sons of liberty he said
[44:56.640 --> 45:00.480]  we want to see the speaker vacate the chair at first they laughed it off they
[45:00.480 --> 45:04.640]  said this is not serious we don't have to really worry about this but then
[45:04.640 --> 45:08.160]  overnight they did a head count and they found out
[45:08.160 --> 45:13.600]  that it was incredibly close so close just a handful of votes
[45:13.600 --> 45:18.480]  that they tabled it until after recess and so the question to you is
[45:18.480 --> 45:22.800]  bainer has been calling all these guys in congress
[45:22.800 --> 45:28.880]  throughout the recess and i'll ask you have you been calling your congressman
[45:28.880 --> 45:33.040]  to say get bainer out because he's been putting pressure on them to stay in
[45:33.040 --> 45:36.400]  understand that you know when it comes to things like obama care how you've been
[45:36.400 --> 45:39.440]  betrayed understand when it comes to open
[45:39.440 --> 45:43.120]  borders how you've been betrayed by john bainer
[45:43.120 --> 45:46.480]  here's another example of how you've been betrayed
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.720]  gun control remember post sandy hook remember the spring
[45:50.720 --> 45:53.680]  of 2013 when it looked like we were going to be facing
[45:53.680 --> 45:57.440]  massive new gun laws and the wake of the
[45:57.440 --> 46:01.440]  false flag at sandy hook well they point out here that when all of that was
[46:01.440 --> 46:05.040]  going as many people call it the battle of the century for
[46:05.040 --> 46:09.360]  the right to keep and bear arms john bainer they say could have
[46:09.360 --> 46:14.000]  nipped gun control in the bud by saying that it would be dead on a rival in the
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.160]  house but instead he sent out the signal to obama said the house will consider
[46:18.160 --> 46:21.760]  any gun control proposals sent over by the senate
[46:21.760 --> 46:28.320]  there you go there you go so it's not just on obama care it's not just on open
[46:28.320 --> 46:33.040]  borders it is also on gun control and every other issue because
[46:33.040 --> 46:39.520]  bainer is part of the ruling elite and on the core issues there's not any
[46:39.520 --> 46:42.960]  difference between the different parties here's another example of this
[46:42.960 --> 46:46.960]  someone else who fits into that category
[46:46.960 --> 46:50.880]  kasek john kasek who is running for president
[46:50.880 --> 46:54.400]  they say in bright bart that he channels mitch mcconnell on planned
[46:54.400 --> 46:58.640]  parenthood he said the g.o.p doesn't need an unpopular government
[46:58.640 --> 47:04.240]  shutdown no we would never want to slow the government's progress in
[47:04.240 --> 47:08.880]  regulating us down would we wouldn't want to have that happen
[47:08.880 --> 47:13.280]  what do you say about a government that funds the kinds of things that we have
[47:13.280 --> 47:16.720]  just seen from planned parenthood what do you
[47:16.720 --> 47:22.160]  say about somebody like john kasek who can't get the backbone to even
[47:22.160 --> 47:25.840]  stop the government funding it i mean we're not talking about
[47:25.840 --> 47:29.200]  locking people up even we're just talking about stopping
[47:29.200 --> 47:33.440]  paying them out of the federal government we're just saying we're not
[47:33.440 --> 47:37.920]  going to proceed with any budgets unless you stop that funding
[47:37.920 --> 47:42.320]  he can't even muster the moral courage to do that
[47:42.320 --> 47:46.640]  absolutely absolutely amazing now when it comes to
[47:46.640 --> 47:50.640]  climate change again there's going to be massive conferences that's why the
[47:50.640 --> 47:54.960]  pope is coming and we just had the secret service
[47:54.960 --> 48:00.240]  say that they have foiled an attempt on the pope's life and if you ever looked
[48:00.240 --> 48:03.680]  at the the pictures of jonathan price the actor
[48:03.680 --> 48:06.400]  see if you guys can pull that up real quick on the screen
[48:06.400 --> 48:10.320]  they he's a doppelganger for the current pope and when i saw that
[48:10.320 --> 48:13.920]  when they said that they had foiled a an assassination attempt
[48:13.920 --> 48:17.280]  on the current pope i thought well did they do that by
[48:17.280 --> 48:23.280]  uh using a decoy actor jonathan price you know hitler had a whole bunch of
[48:23.280 --> 48:26.640]  actors who are decoys if you look at this and look at the two of them
[48:26.640 --> 48:30.400]  side by side there's some amazing pictures if you pull that up if you google
[48:30.400 --> 48:33.600]  that on uh on uh if you look up the both of
[48:33.600 --> 48:37.040]  their's name both of their names of pope frances and jonathan price you'll see
[48:37.040 --> 48:40.960]  them side by side and i mean they look like twins
[48:40.960 --> 48:45.520]  so did they use an actor double to uh to do this or maybe did they just
[48:45.520 --> 48:49.840]  call off their own assassination attempt you know because we see that they have
[48:49.840 --> 48:54.640]  their own terrorist uh there we no i thought we had that coming up
[48:54.640 --> 48:57.680]  there we go there we go there's the two of them right there you can see them
[48:57.680 --> 49:00.800]  side by side and there's some pictures you'll see if you google it on the
[49:00.800 --> 49:04.480]  internet you'll see the two there you got them right next to each other
[49:04.480 --> 49:08.160]  absolutely amazing of course jonathan price is the actor who's one of my
[49:08.160 --> 49:12.320]  favorite films brazil that was terry gilliam who was
[49:12.320 --> 49:17.040]  with money python that was his uh kind of python-esque take on
[49:17.040 --> 49:21.680]  1984 that's one of my my favorite dark comedies
[49:21.680 --> 49:25.520]  but you know i i guess this falls into the category i guess we have to believe
[49:25.520 --> 49:29.200]  them they're not giving us any evidence they never do when the uh
[49:29.200 --> 49:32.720]  the national security state says that they have just saved us you know it's
[49:32.720 --> 49:36.480]  kind of like when obama had jobs created and saved
[49:36.480 --> 49:40.880]  how do you how do you judge that you know the the jobs that were
[49:40.880 --> 49:43.520]  saved that didn't get lost you know he includes
[49:43.520 --> 49:46.880]  those in a metric on that now i guess we got a new metric and that is uh
[49:46.880 --> 49:50.480]  popes that they have saved but the reason he's coming of course
[49:50.480 --> 49:55.040]  is to sell climate change now there was a recent
[49:55.040 --> 49:59.200]  back and forth uh in the uh epa with a house democrat
[49:59.200 --> 50:02.560]  coming after brian shaw who's chairman of the texas commission
[50:02.560 --> 50:06.080]  on environmental quality and this is very interesting because this goes back to
[50:06.080 --> 50:10.400]  one of the first stories i covered when i came to info wars
[50:10.400 --> 50:14.480]  again the epa has issued its clean power plan they did this last
[50:14.480 --> 50:19.520]  august they want to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal fired plants by 32
[50:19.520 --> 50:23.760]  percent over the next 15 years this is part of obama's war on coal
[50:23.760 --> 50:27.920]  he promised and he's keeping to this promise he promised that he was going
[50:27.920 --> 50:31.680]  to essentially stop all power production from coal
[50:31.680 --> 50:35.600]  and so he's trying to make good on that now this is very interesting because
[50:35.600 --> 50:41.520]  they had a back and forth with this where the democrat congresswoman uh
[50:41.520 --> 50:47.440]  johnson came after shaw and said um this is uh this you're recklessly
[50:47.440 --> 50:51.600]  endangering the health of children and he said uh no
[50:51.600 --> 50:56.560]  co2 doesn't kill anybody and she was absolutely flabbergasted
[50:56.560 --> 51:00.240]  because she was simply going off the epa points will be right back organic

[54:21.760 --> 54:25.280]  that is the agenda that we're going to be facing towards the end of this month
[54:25.280 --> 54:28.880]  there's a massive push as i mentioned that's what the pope's visit to america
[54:28.880 --> 54:31.440]  is about he's never visited america before
[54:31.440 --> 54:35.840]  never ever he's uh what 78 years old 77 78 years old
[54:35.840 --> 54:39.280]  never been to america for any reason but now he's coming
[54:39.280 --> 54:43.600]  to push a globalist government and the means of the globalist government of
[54:43.600 --> 54:47.200]  course is the climate change governance because that's going to
[54:47.200 --> 54:50.400]  give them what they need to tax us you can't have
[54:50.400 --> 54:54.000]  a governmental structure without taxes without an army and of course
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.120]  we're also going to talk in this broadcast about the european army
[54:57.120 --> 55:01.200]  that's what they're pushing in europe as well before we get back to that news i
[55:01.200 --> 55:04.560]  want to let you know that we have a two-week introductory offer on info
[55:04.560 --> 55:07.200]  wars life select foods these are new

[55:26.000 --> 55:30.960]  that has 25 year shelf life and again the packaging is very important when
[55:30.960 --> 55:33.920]  you're talking about a long-term storageable item like this

[55:37.520 --> 55:42.160]  and we also have ziploc containers on the food so it doesn't

[56:34.000 --> 56:36.960]  now going back to climate change and this is very important because as we're
[56:36.960 --> 56:39.920]  talking about earlier we've seen the president
[56:39.920 --> 56:43.280]  being given a fast-tracked authority for these
[56:43.280 --> 56:47.280]  trade agreements that we know what is behind that it's not about free trade
[56:47.280 --> 56:51.440]  at best it's crony capitalism but we know that this is part of a longer term
[56:51.440 --> 56:55.120]  movement for global governance but he was given that
[56:55.120 --> 56:57.840]  and now some of the same people who gave him that authority
[56:57.840 --> 57:01.760]  are complaining about the Iran deal and saying wait it's not a deal
[57:01.760 --> 57:08.000]  it's a treaty and we have to have this ratified by the senate with 67 votes
[57:08.000 --> 57:11.840]  it's like yeah that's right when you ignore the constitution in one way
[57:11.840 --> 57:14.640]  it's going to come back and bite you in another way the next way it's going to
[57:14.640 --> 57:18.640]  bite us as well is going to be on climate change
[57:18.640 --> 57:22.080]  if he can just make deals with any country that he wants to without going
[57:22.080 --> 57:24.560]  through the constitutional process of having a treaty
[57:24.560 --> 57:29.120]  if he can make massive agreements that transcend
[57:29.120 --> 57:32.960]  our sovereignty and that's what the senator who's looked at it the most
[57:32.960 --> 57:37.040]  senator sessions has says that the transatlantic and trans-specific
[57:37.040 --> 57:42.560]  partnerships do they create a transnational governance commission
[57:42.560 --> 57:46.480]  that will do things to us that have absolutely nothing to do with the
[57:46.480 --> 57:49.120]  economy of course it will have a lot of economic
[57:49.120 --> 57:52.160]  aspects to it but there's going to be other issues in it as well if you can
[57:52.160 --> 57:55.600]  do that then of course you can do it with climate change as well
[57:55.600 --> 58:01.200]  it can act as a dictator a good example however of the
[58:01.200 --> 58:05.680]  nonsense and non-science that underlies all of this is this back and forth
[58:05.680 --> 58:10.000]  exchange between a democrat congresswoman
[58:10.000 --> 58:14.000]  bernice johnson and the guy from texas saying that

[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.320]  wildfires killing they say at least one person
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.920]  destroying over 400 homes and businesses this is something i've been
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.640]  gone for about a week and a half i got back
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.400]  towards the end of last week we went out to the west coast of the pacific
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:49.120]  northwest we went around the oregon area looking
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.960]  at that area as well as down to the tip of northern california
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.680]  to see redwood trees redwood force it was absolutely amazing
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.080]  to see these massive riverbeds that were dried up
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.200]  there was a lot of chemtrailing as a matter of fact
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.960]  as we drove around as my wife kept pointing it out to me she was she was
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.640]  very upset about it but as we were driving through there we
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.600]  saw as it was we're in the plane we could see the wildfires from the plane as
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.320]  we were driving through the areas we saw massive
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:22.320]  went through massive choking smoke but one of the things that i thought was
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.880]  really touching was the uh the signs of people
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.560]  thanking the firefighters who have come from all over the country to fight
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.600]  these fires they they genuinely appreciated
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.240]  these people who were putting their lives at risk
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.760]  to save other people's lives to save their homes to save their businesses we
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.640]  saw massive encampments of people who had
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:48.800]  gone basically taken their camper trailers and
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.000]  they just cleared out large areas for them to stay and they were they were
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.760]  camping out there as volunteers to work on these areas
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.960]  incredibly sad to see what is going on there and you can see some of that
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:04.720]  footage there moves very very quickly through the forests and
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:08.000]  these massive areas not so much in oregon but boy
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.320]  really was was dry in um in northern uh california it was also dry for
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.840]  for oregon uh from what everyone was saying
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.120]  we also have uh other news that we're going to cover this hour i want to talk
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:25.040]  about a west point professor who called for the
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:29.920]  u.s. military to target legal critics of the war on terror
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.920]  people who criticized our foreign policy for example we're going to talk a lot
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.400]  about what's behind that we've got a retired
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:41.840]  cia agent saying that uh we run the afghan opium trade
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:45.920]  he actually wrote a book about it and he claims that as he was about to
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:50.000]  publish this book he was set up uh with child
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.840]  pornography charges so we're going to talk about that we have spy chief
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:57.600]  james clapper says the intelligence community
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:03.600]  is like spider-man well they do wear a mask the mask is national security and
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.720]  they feel that as long as they've got that mask on they can do anything they
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.240]  want but he actually did uh mention you know with
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.800]  great power comes great responsibility but we haven't seen that
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:19.680]  what he was really focusing on however was spidey's
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.800]  senses you know the spidey sense a precognition
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.200]  james clapper the guy who lied to senator ron
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.840]  widen about dragnet surveillance just a couple of weeks before ed snowden
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:35.280]  did the massive uh release of information that proved
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.720]  that that was what was happening of course many people like thomas drake and
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:43.520]  william benney and other nsa whistleblowers had
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.520]  right after september 11th had gone through channels trying to stop this they
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.680]  knew it was unconstitutional and we're going to talk about this in detail
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:57.280]  when we come back but at the time they had ignored the nsa
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.800]  whistleblowers even though they had charged thomas drake and tried to put
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.120]  him in jail as a whistleblower that had not picked up any
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:09.600]  traction in the mainstream press but the ed snowden
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.680]  documents of course did and just before that happened we have the
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.120]  uh direct questioning from ron widen who also knew everybody knew
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.320]  that this was going on in the senate all the senators and the uh
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:24.400]  intelligence committee knew it their staffers knew it james clapper knew it
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:28.160]  and he asked him a direct question said are you doing dragnet surveillance on
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.760]  the american people you remember that he looks down and he he rubs his head and
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.800]  he goes well uh you know he lied about it
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:40.880]  directly lied about it he is someone who very much knows about pre-crime
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:44.080]  he's been working with geospatial intelligence
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.080]  since 2000 that was his first directorship that's what we've talked
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.960]  about being behind jade helm we're going to talk about that when we come back
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:58.000]  stay with us we'll be right back
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.720]  last week david night interviewed the sheen family who described decades of
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:07.600]  bombings machine gun strappings and even nuclear bomb testing all done in and
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.720]  around their property well here's the story of alan vorwaller who died when
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.640]  he was 43 back in 2004 on his obituary his wife listed his
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.240]  cause of death was repeated and continual exposure to nuclear chemical
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:22.240]  and biological warfare agents while he was growing up in tool utah as a result
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.640]  of hunting and camping near the dugway proving ground
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:29.120]  alan suffered localized tumors in his lungs knees shoulders and hip which
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:32.480]  doctors credited to the atomic tests he was living downwind from but then they
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.440]  found another type of cancer which was common to people exposed to
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.720]  biologically engineered germs are gene damaging nerve agents
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.880]  vx nerve gas was also tested at dugway proving ground before his death alan
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.840]  suffered 105 degree fever which doctors concluded after
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.040]  exhaustive testing could only have been caused by an exotic virus
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:52.640]  just another story of our government testing on its own citizens join us this

[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:09.120]  on the gcn radio network
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:16.000]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today we were
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.600]  talking in the last segment about james clapper the guy who famously lied to
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.920]  ron wyden about dragnet surveillance just before he was proven to be a liar by
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.960]  the edward snowden releases he's talking about how the intelligence
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.680]  community is kind of like spider-man he does say with great power comes great
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.640]  responsibility but of course they don't live up to that responsibility
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.760]  he was really more focused on what he called
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:43.760]  the precognitive spidey sense in other words
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.880]  pre-crime folks this is where this is all coming from
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:51.680]  james clapper has been part of geospatial intelligence
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.000]  since the since 2000 that was his first directorship
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  the geospatial uh intelligence conference that happens every year it's
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.960]  one of the fastest growing uh divisions of intelligence he has been a key
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:09.280]  note speaker most of the year so he is intricately involved
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:13.360]  in this and when he talks about a precognition
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.280]  that's what he's talking about he's talking about precrime
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:20.720]  as we've pointed out when we covered jade helm talked about and of course jade
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:25.200]  helm is supposed to end tomorrow is the last day of jade helm we've not seen
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:29.200]  anything uh overtly on the streets about jade helm isn't that
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:33.280]  interesting is that surprising not really
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:37.120]  they said they were going to be dressed as civilians
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:41.200]  and they were going to try to move around without being detected
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:45.600]  in america so these are american soldiers dressed in civilian clothing
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:49.680]  saying they were going to be moving around without being detected
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:53.280]  now that's kind of setting the bar pretty low as uh as as paul joseph
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.240]  watson and i were talking about that when that was first released so
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:00.320]  well you know if they're going to actually use this to
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.320]  uh train for foreign conflicts as they always say that that's what they're
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.160]  using it for instead of using it to operate here
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.680]  domestically against american citizens they said no no no this isn't for you
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.480]  this is for other countries where we're going to go to
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.040]  well if they're going to do that wouldn't you think
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.160]  that uh that really isn't going to help them with their training
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.320]  i mean that right there tells you that they're training for america but we
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:28.560]  haven't seen any major helicopter drops or anything else like that
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.080]  but we pointed out that the slogan of jade helm was
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.920]  mastering the human domain we did a very long report on it i talked with
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:40.080]  uh rob do and and we broke that down we looked at the
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.320]  uh geospatial intelligence conferences where they
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:48.720]  had a keynote speech that was mastering the human domain how would they master
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.000]  the human domain they would do it by predicting what you
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.240]  were going to do and of course we're told by james clapper by
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:01.600]  hayden by others that don't worry we're not really listening and recording all
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.280]  of your conversations i i believe that's a lie i believe
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:10.000]  that's what they've got the bluff bill uh utah data center for but
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.200]  nevertheless they say we're just looking at your metadata
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.200]  let me tell you something james clapper and the geospatial intelligence
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.720]  community and the special forces community knows
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.360]  that your metadata is even more valuable than your conversation
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.480]  they call it activity-based intelligence they call it human domain
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:33.520]  analytics if they follow you if they monitor what
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:37.200]  everyone is doing they're who they're associating with
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:41.600]  what religious political groups are affiliated with what their movement
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:44.720]  their patterns of movement are if they record all of that
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:49.120]  they put that into their database just like they do for law enforcement
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:53.120]  and they see who pops up who pops up out of their
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.240]  collection of database they just run all this through they say we're not doing
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.760]  this deductively like Sherlock Holmes would do when he comes in and tries to
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.320]  solve a crime we're not looking to say well there's a
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:06.240]  crime that's been committed we want to let's see who was who had motive who
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:10.400]  had opportunity they're not doing that they're
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:15.040]  doing this in a pre-crime mode and that's what the
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.560]  intelligence community put this together with they want to just collect
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.040]  all your information and see who pops up as being unusual
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.040]  then they will focus on you do you understand
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:34.240]  how different how dangerous pre-crime and pre-cognitive intelligence is
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:37.360]  do you understand the potential for false alarms
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.120]  for people to be singled out when they haven't done anything wrong
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.640]  and of course that's a very definition of pre-crime you haven't committed a
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:47.280]  crime but they think you might commit a crime so they're
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.120]  going to come after you now as I point out in this article from
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.880]  Mitt Press when they talk about his spidey senses
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.080]  they say and of course this is something that's gone on for a long time
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.120]  we've known going all the way back to the church and Pike
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:04.880]  committee hearings in the 1970s we knew that the government
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.240]  was monitoring the citizens here in America
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.320]  that was a key part of it senator frank church warned in 1975 they say
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:16.640]  that this surveillance had vast capabilities that the NSA had vast
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.840]  capabilities if it turned on Americans it would mean that no
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.760]  American had any privacy left the agency could monitor everything from phone
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:30.320]  conversations to telegrams and he said there would be no place to hide
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.920]  total information awareness that is the point
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.440]  of this surveillance that we see now coming from them
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.520]  and of course the pike committee hearing uh that was chaired by congressman
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.840]  pike that was the first time the public ever even
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:48.000]  learned of the NSA he called the director to testify
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.640]  and he said we want to see your charter you know even the CIA had a charter the
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.720]  CIA was created with a charter not necessarily with the law
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:00.880]  but of course the NSA was created by an executive order
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.960]  there we are back to the president as a dictator except that was president
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.960]  Truman going back to that point he created them with an executive order
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:14.640]  and the director of the NSA refused to show that executive order
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:19.440]  to congressman pike and congressman pike was outraged he said we give you
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.200]  billions of dollars and we cannot even see
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.120]  the executive order that created you said that's right
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.480]  i'm not going to show it to you that's the arrogance
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:34.400]  of this secret dark government that has set itself
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.800]  against the american people that has set itself against the rule of law
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.720]  as i pointed out in this article and and we interviewed
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:45.120]  thomas drake i hope to uh talk to him again sometime
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.120]  NSA whistleblower thomas drake had concerns about domestic surveillance in
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:53.280]  2001 immediately after september 11 attacks he went to
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.200]  veto patenza the nsa deputy general counsel in other words
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:04.320]  these whistleblowers drake benny weirby others they went through
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.560]  internal channels as they should have done and they were totally
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:13.840]  ignored this is what patenza said on pbs's front line
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:17.920]  program about this the program was called the program
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:22.240]  patenza the general counsel of the nsa said the minute
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:26.320]  that thomas drake uh drake uh if he did say you're using this to violate the
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.960]  constitution he says i mean i probably would have stopped the
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.360]  conversation at that point quite frankly so i mean if that's what he said he
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.440]  said then anything after that i probably wasn't listening to
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:43.440]  anyway oh okay so you got somebody like thomas drake
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:48.400]  who puts his life on the line like the founders of this country
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:54.560]  he put his life his honor his uh livelihood everything his career on the
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:58.240]  line because of his loyalty to his oath to the
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.720]  constitution when he was on our program he said
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:04.320]  i didn't take an oath to the presidency i didn't take an oath
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:10.080]  to a bureaucracy i took an oath to the constitution so he goes to the
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.040]  legal counsel for the nsa and says what we're doing is unconstitutional and
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:19.040]  this guy has the audacity to go on pbs's front line
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:23.680]  documentary and say well the minute that thomas drake comes up and says
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.800]  uh what you're doing is against the constitution he says if he said that i
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.480]  don't know if he said i could care less uh if he said that i wouldn't have
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.280]  listened to anything he had to say after that at all because you know
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.000]  constitution just doesn't matter anymore does it
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.840]  that's quite frankly that's where we are whether we're talking about treaties
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.120]  as we did in the last hour whether we're talking about the activities
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:47.600]  of the nsa they could care less what the constitution says
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.640]  i've played the clip from michael hayden where he went to
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:54.560]  washington and lee university addressed students there in the legal department
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:57.920]  and he was talking about what happened he says i don't need section 215 section
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:02.880]  215 is the part of the nsa part of the patriot act that the nsa says
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:08.800]  gives them authority to listen to uh our conversations and and to spy
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:15.680]  domestically he said i didn't need 215 215 is such a safe harbor i i had an
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.640]  order from the president and he was so smug and cock cocky when he said that
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.760]  we should play that clip i i didn't have that prepared for the guys but
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.080]  it's just amazing to look at how smug and cock cocky he was
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:33.040]  i had an order from the president so when you operate like that
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.640]  the word is called dictatorship and that's where these guys are take a
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:42.240]  look at this article this is from world news daily report a retired cia agent
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:46.320]  says we run the afghan opium trade where have we heard that before
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.000]  we've been telling you that for years at info wars we had
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.640]  heraldo revera standing in the poppy field showing american soldiers help
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.640]  guarding the poppy fields helping to load the poppy stuff is a yeah yeah we
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:03.120]  want to they need an economy so we're doing this to help this i mean
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.720]  it's absolutely amazing it's an open secret but he writes a book about it
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:10.880]  a retired cia agent recently convicted of possession of child pornography
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.520]  accuses u.s government of trying to frame him
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:17.680]  as he was about to release a book that will he says blow the lid off the cia's
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:20.880]  drug smuggling operations in afghanistan this is from the
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:26.320]  cheyenne herald in wyoming john f abbotsford a 38 year old afghan war
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.400]  veteran that also served his country as a cia
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:32.000]  analyst has recently been convicted of possession of child pornography
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.920]  accusations that he claims were fabricated by the u.s government to
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:41.200]  stop the publication of his upcoming book the cia in afghanistan 30 years of
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.120]  drug smuggling he says this is a desperate attempt
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:49.600]  by the u.s government to shut me up if i'm going to face jail time i want the
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.080]  truth to be known before they get rid of me
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:55.440]  in prison he says i'm ashamed to say that i've participated
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.040]  in these drug smuggling operations on many occasions for a long time i tried to
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.560]  convince myself that we were doing it for the right cause
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:07.760]  but this burden is destroying me inside and i can't stand it anymore
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:10.800]  now he said that to a court audience he said the cia
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:14.240]  has been dealing drugs since its creation and he's addressing the court
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:17.520]  here because when they brought him up on charges for child
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.320]  pornography and understand with the nsa having the tools to everybody's
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:26.320]  computers it's they're loading stuff on your computer all the time folks
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.000]  it may not be child pornography it may just be stuff to spy on you
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.440]  but they can very easily put child pornography on anybody's computer if
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.280]  they want to take you down for political purposes
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:38.000]  he didn't even address the child pornography charges when he got up and
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.800]  addressed the court what he talked about was what they were doing
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:44.400]  in afghanistan what he had been doing he says the cia has been dealing drugs
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.000]  since its creation they've been smuggling drugs everywhere in the world for the
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.680]  past 60 years in taiwan in 1949 to support general
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.960]  chan kai shek against the chinese communists and vietnam and nika

[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:42.560]  gain of function viruses their select agents as they call them bringing in
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:46.080]  deadly bacteria that are not indigenous to the united states enhancing them
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.800]  that's what gain of function is about and then

[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.440]  monti he doesn't he prefers not to say where he's from he said i previously
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:49.280]  conducted an oxy powder cleanse an apple cider and vinegar
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:52.880]  olive oil liver cleanse and had already been using a different zeolite
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:57.440]  metal cleanse i then tried this product the zeolite is a must for me because of
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:01.200]  other circumstances after starting this product stuff started coming out of me i
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.240]  feel even better than i did before another one
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:09.360]  this is from a homemaker she says in chichester new hampshire
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:13.520]  i followed up i followed up with my grandkids doctor on their heavy metal
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:17.040]  panel and he was astonished with the decreased
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:20.800]  readings that's what the zeolites do for you is essentially
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:25.040]  something that helps to filter naturally filter

[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:40.720]  let's talk about other things that might get into your body
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:43.840]  things from the department of defense you know last night
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:47.280]  my family went back and watched uh aliens again we hadn't seen it for a
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:51.440]  number of years and every time i see it i'm just amazed
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:55.040]  at the parallels between this one character
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:58.560]  if you remember who wants to get the uh the alien back because he can make a
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:02.480]  lot of money selling it to the military weaponizing it right
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:08.880]  i'm amazed at how irresponsible our real government is
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:13.280]  we have a government we have military contractors
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.200]  who will do precisely that in the real world
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:21.680]  they're bringing in pathogens that are not indigenous to america
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:24.880]  they are enhancing them they call them select agents they're enhancing them so
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:27.920]  that they are more deadly these are things that already have
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:31.440]  uh kill the vast majority of the people who contract it
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:35.840]  they try to make it more dangerous they try to make it more contagious
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.840]  and then they're sloppy with the way that they contain it
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.320]  they bring them over in these biosafety labs we
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.360]  we've talked about this earlier this year we talked about the
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.720]  leak in lsu the national primate center where they brought over
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.000]  berkholderia pseudomalii which is a bacteria that's not
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  indigenous to united states somehow got out of their biosafety level
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.360]  three lab and got into the wild and to the
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.680]  open acreage with these other primates that were there
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:06.960]  they had an investigation they couldn't figure it out then one of the
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:10.560]  people who was investigating it tested positive for it but don't worry
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:13.840]  i'm sure they didn't catch it they said didn't catch it here they must have
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:17.920]  gotten it from a previous exposure and then the head of the
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:23.120]  the tulane area said this tulane lab said i wouldn't be surprised if we test
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.800]  the soil and and find the bacteria there because it was probably already there
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.640]  and somebody who was honest at the cdc said that has never
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:35.200]  been in the united states it only was existent in two other countries
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:39.760]  far remote from here so that's never been indigenous in the united states
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.640]  but of course that's what we're seeing over and over again now the newest one
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:46.160]  newest one we had anthrax shipped through the mail
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:49.680]  live anthrax shipped by department of defense
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:53.440]  laboratories now we've got samples of black
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:58.560]  plague and other deadly pathogens the latest cdc investigation
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:02.720]  started after cdc inspectors found a sample of the plague
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:07.440]  in a freezer outside of a containment area on august the 17th at the edgewood
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:12.480]  chemical biological center in maryland now they say this is the chairman of the
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.120]  house energy commerce committee uh both of them the republican and
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:20.320]  democrat said anthrax being mishandled is this concerning
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:25.280]  enough but now we've got mishandling that includes the plague no it doesn't
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.600]  include the plague it includes weaponized plague you understand
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:33.360]  why are we even doing this why would we even
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:38.480]  take deadly pathogens and weaponize them and then why would we give it to these
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:42.800]  people to let loose we'll be right back
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:54.560]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.120]  network
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:03.120]  isis has demanded that syrian christians pay an islam tax
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:07.600]  this is being reported by world net daily isis terrorists gather together
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:11.840]  dozens of christian men in syria and told them either to pay a syria inspired
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:15.200]  tax and sign on to a list of faith-based restrictions
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:18.560]  or pay a penalty that could include the loss of life
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:22.000]  among the restrictions christians cannot own guns
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.320]  build places of worship show their crosses in public or even ring church
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.120]  bells the terrorists put forth their demands to
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:32.800]  christians in a town that used to be dominated by the christian faith but
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:37.360]  has been taken over by radical muslims and while many followers of islam
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:41.200]  will condemn these actions numerous people in power continue to fund
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:45.760]  groups like isis and al-qaeda whether it's air dropping grenades or
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:49.280]  leaving behind billions of dollars worth of vehicles that they can use against
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:53.680]  us these terrorist groups always seem to find the best equipment somewhere

[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:29.600]  one of the articles that's up on info wars dot com are the topless protesters
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:33.280]  who are interrupting the muslim conference on women
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:36.720]  you know we have the the news break that
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:40.000]  darryl mcbrain dead where he's talking about how many skirts and
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.440]  shorts so they warned people back in june in germany
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:47.440]  they warned young girls not to wear mini skirts not to wear shorts because they
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.760]  might get attacked well what do you think would happen
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:54.080]  if you go to a conference with fundamental islamists
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:58.960]  and you rip off your burqa and your bra and get topless up there well
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:01.920]  what happened and interestingly enough what these two fundamentalist preachers
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:06.240]  were talking about at the time whether or not wives should be beaten
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:10.160]  okay well they should be beaten or not so these two women who had gone to the
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.280]  conference they rip off their burqas their topless and they jump up
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:17.040]  on stage and they start yelling no one subjugates me the other one said
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.280]  i'm my own prophet they had stuff written on their on their bodies
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:25.680]  at that point you can see here this guy is kicking them they a massive men
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:29.600]  rush on the stage and there's no debate as to whether or not
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.760]  they should beat topless women or kick topless women
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:37.360]  not with the crowd of people that are there there you go that's the religion
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:40.640]  of peace there taking those two women knocking them down
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:44.400]  and beating and kicking them now we have a
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:47.680]  article from the american thinker tennessee common core teaches one
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:51.680]  nation under a la national common core you know that's the
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:55.520]  thing remember when jeb bush was criticized for
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:58.800]  being part of an organization that funded planned parenthood
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:02.480]  and his defense was all i was doing that with bill gates and and we were
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:05.920]  actually trying to push common core not planned parenthood we're actually
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:10.000]  trying to push common core and even though we gave them 10
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  million dollars i actually reduced funding from the state of
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.360]  florida for planned parenthood you know how much you reduced it
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:22.480]  300 thousand dollars reduction in funding to plan parenthood
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:26.480]  while the foundation that he's a director of jeb bush
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:32.240]  gives them 10 million dollars okay so he reduced he gives them 30 times more
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:36.240]  money privately than he took away publicly but
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:39.440]  what he was really trying to push was common core well what does common core
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:43.040]  do for us well we've had a lot of guests on to talk about
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.560]  the problems with common core one of the problems with common core is the fact
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.760]  that it's common the fact that we have
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:53.680]  the federal government dictating to everybody what education
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:58.080]  should be what should be taught defining the education defining the tests
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:02.080]  and telling everybody what should be taught and of course it is a horrible
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:05.840]  curriculum deliberately dumbing down the population
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:10.160]  of course charlotte isabee who we've talked to many times with uh phyllis
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:15.120]  schlafly had written a book the deliberate dumbing down of america
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:19.040]  uh phil charlotte isabee did it from her
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:23.360]  uh time at the department of education in the reagan administration she knew
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:27.200]  that this was a process that was deliberately
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:31.200]  trying to dumb down the american population that the reason that johnny
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:36.400]  can't read isn't because of incompetence it's because of design
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:42.320]  it is a tool of social control it is not a an instrument of education
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:46.080]  that's the way the department of education has been pushing things all
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:49.200]  along and of course we see the fruit of this now
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:52.960]  in tennessee in this particular district that this is the marie county
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:57.280]  school district students were assigned a five pillars of islam project
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:01.600]  that included the translation of the pillar of shahada
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:06.080]  as being there is no god but allah mohammed is his prophet joy ellis the
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:09.760]  mother of seventh grader at spring hill middle school in tennessee
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:13.440]  said that christian children should not be instructed to write this out she
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:19.360]  said this is a seventh grade state standard and will be on tcap she
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.720]  said i didn't have a problem with the history of islam being caught
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:27.840]  but to go so far as to make my child write the shahada is unacceptable
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:34.800]  where's the aclu on this isn't this far more than what we've been seeing done
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.640]  with christianity well of course they're not
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.840]  having a problem with this you should have a problem with this you should have
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:44.960]  a problem with the department of education remember ronald
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:47.280]  reagan was going to get rid of the department of education
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:51.280]  he could have killed that thing while it was in the cradle like rosemary's baby
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:55.120]  but he didn't jimmy carter had created it
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:59.040]  it was less than four years old when ronald reagan took office he ran and
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:01.680]  went one of the tenants that he was running on was he was going to get rid
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:04.720]  of the department of education when he left
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:08.560]  it was several times larger than when he took office
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:12.000]  and see that's the problem that's the problem
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.720]  with the presidential elections or as i call him celebrity big brother every
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:22.000]  four years we get to pick a new big brother now and it's gotten to be more
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.720]  and more a celebrity operation and how do we know that even if
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:31.840]  these guys put out a position paper how do we
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:35.360]  know that it isn't just a position it's not a principle that they are going to
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.760]  live by this is just a position that they're
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:42.000]  putting out so they can get the position of president
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:45.440]  how do we know these people are going to stick to any of this stuff of course we
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:48.720]  don't know and we see over and over again that they don't
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:53.200]  do what they said they were going to do when they get elected how many times
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:57.040]  are we going to get fooled by this and nevertheless we still
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:01.840]  see that we're moving to that yet again one of the ways that we
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:05.680]  move against this of course is with media and one of the things that we're
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:09.520]  trying to do with our money bomb that's going to start in two days it'll be a
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:12.320]  27-hour money bomb at the very least it may
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:16.480]  go longer than that i guess if we if we count overdrive in the news wrap up
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:20.560]  which is a fourth hour we have a goal of reaching
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:24.240]  400 million people in north america to do that
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:27.600]  we need a million dollars we need your help to do that how are we going to do
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:30.720]  it we're going to try to do this by satellite broadcasting that can be
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.480]  picked up by local television stations to help give us
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:38.480]  more exposure we're depending on you to help us
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:42.320]  with crowd-funded donations typically the way we support our operation and we
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:45.600]  run a very tight ship here at info wars we typically support it
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:49.280]  by the products that we sell at info wars life dot com but to expand
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:53.360]  like this we need your help in a crowd funding operation
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:56.480]  so we're going to have a telephone i think it'll be very entertaining i think
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:00.800]  it'll be very informative the next issue of celebrity big brother
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:04.240]  on cnn the presidential so-called debates will be happening
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:09.280]  that evening we'll be covering that live and reacting to what is being said
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.680]  uh kind of like a mystery science 3000
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:17.840]  we won't have any robots it'll just be us here we'll be talking about it but
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:22.000]  we've never taken a loan from anybody we expand our operation with your support
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.760]  so we hope that you will stay tuned for the money bomb and be
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:29.280]  aware of it and tell your friends about it we'll have a lot of auctions that
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:31.840]  will be involved in that as well some interesting things that are going to be
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:35.200]  auctioned off and when i look at that one of the things that made me think about
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:39.840]  that was this article there's a new documentary
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.040]  film that is called truth and it's about dan rather
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.920]  it's a documentary remember dan rather was essentially fired or left or
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:54.400]  whatever it was because of some documents where
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:00.480]  he came after george bush in 2006 events leading up to the election
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:04.560]  he says a film called truth should be accurate well i would think so too but
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:07.840]  of course we've also had other films with truth in the title like al gore's
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:12.240]  inconvenient truth which is really nothing but a convenient lie
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:19.280]  about global warming so i'm not this is a uh robert redford starring
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:22.480]  rathergate movie called truth i guess robert redford plays
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:28.480]  dan rather they say he says journalism is not an exact science but you know
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:31.840]  what is an exact science you can take a look at a document that's produced
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:35.520]  like the so-called letter uh that they had there
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:38.320]  and you can say well this letter purports to have been
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:43.680]  written by some guy with a national guard uh back in the 1960s
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:50.160]  on his typewriter but look the type is proportionally spaced
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:54.400]  and when you type a date like the 13th that th
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.400]  is in tiny superscript that might be an indication
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:02.240]  that it was done with a modern word processor
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:04.800]  it looked exactly like something that was put out
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.040]  by microsoft's word processors at the time it did not look anything at all
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.720]  like something that had come out of a 1960 typewriter so yet
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:17.600]  journalism is not an exact science but there are exact sciences that you can
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:21.520]  use to verify your facts but of course now they're trying to take
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:25.120]  dan rather's conspiracy theory and here's the deal i'm not defending
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:29.200]  george bush's draft dodging issues there's other ways that they could have
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:31.600]  taken him down they could have come after him for the
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:34.800]  lies about iraq they could have come after him for
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:38.160]  subverting the constitution with a patriot act and essentially enacting
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:41.760]  martial law because that's what we're under let's understand that
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:45.600]  we've been under martial law without any doubt about it since the patriot act
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:48.400]  when they say that they're not interested in the constitution remember i
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:52.480]  said that earlier they had the guy on pbs front line
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:57.200]  documentary who was the uh the legal counsel for the nsa said
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:00.320]  thomas drake came to me and said something about the constitution if he said
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.880]  that i would immediately just ignore him
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:06.640]  could care less about the constitution so we're under martial law
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:10.480]  so if you're going to come after bush if you're going to try to take down a liar
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.360]  and a dictator don't do it by telling a bunch of lies
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:16.720]  tell the truth there was plenty of truth that they could have used
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:20.880]  to take down george w bush but instead they fabricate something
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:25.760]  off to the side and you ask yourself why would they do that
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:31.200]  why would they do that because cbs the mainstream media the rest of the news
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:36.000]  organizations don't want to take down this national
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.400]  security state they're a part of it they're the front
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:44.080]  line of the propaganda you're not going to hear these
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:47.120]  kinds of stories you're not going to hear what the nsa is doing
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:51.280]  you're not going to hear what the cia is doing
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:56.800]  from the mainstream media that's why it's important for you to support
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:59.760]  info wars it's why it's important for you to support the drudge reporters i
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:03.600]  mentioned the very beginning of the program we now have ios9 from apple is
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:07.360]  going to try to present itself as a news aggregator why
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:11.680]  because drudge is putting out information and stories that the
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:16.320]  mainstream media would not cover he began that way by covering the monica
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:20.800]  lawinsky scandal the perjury of a sitting president with a legal
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:24.400]  degree bill clinton that's how he got his start
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:28.400]  by covering the stories mainstream media would not touch and now
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:32.000]  drudge is the largest news aggregator in the world
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.280]  in the world and does everyone an incredible favors
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:39.600]  huge very important to the freedom of press
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:42.640]  absolutely important freedom of press but of course companies like apple they
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:46.000]  would like to replace that just for business reasons but also they may have
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.280]  some political ties in that as well they have
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:53.040]  been playing footsie with the nsa we have that from apple is very
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:56.960]  very clear that's what's been happening so it's very important to keep a free
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:02.400]  and open press very very important let's take a look at what just happened in
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:05.600]  the last week or so there of course over the weekend
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:09.440]  we had the story about 29 percent of the people
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:14.240]  supporting a military coup isn't that interesting
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:18.000]  i even find it more interesting that we've got yet another story
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  of a crazy west point professor and we've had
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.240]  these stories in the past we had the retired history professor west point
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:31.200]  who had put out the scenario in south carolina saying that the tea party had
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:36.320]  allied with islamic fundamentalist and that was the the background training
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.640]  scenario remember that in darlington south carolina
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:42.080]  that was the scenario that they were pushing well now we've got another west
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:46.560]  point law professor who called on the u.s military to target
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:50.960]  critics of the war on terror here's what he had to say this is a story that was
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:56.160]  broken by the guardian at the end of august and he said
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:59.760]  this is william c bradford he said as part of a war
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:03.120]  against undifferentiated islamic radicalism
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:05.680]  that war ought to be prosecuted vigorously he wrote
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:09.120]  even if it means great destruction innumerable
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:12.880]  enemy casualties and civilian collateral damage
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:16.720]  this guy could get on the stage of the gop debate
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.000]  because they could care less about our foreign policy that's what they're
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.080]  always arguing for we don't care how many uh people die from collateral
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:27.760]  damage we don't care how many casualties we don't care how great the
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:31.200]  destruction we just need to take these guys out and that's going to make us
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:35.200]  all safer isn't it no it isn't but here's what he had to say
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:39.520]  he called his paper the treason of the professors and he wrote it in french i
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:44.000]  guess it'd be trezon des professores he said the critical law of armed conflict
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.480]  academy is an islamic fifth column and of course
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:52.080]  when he referred to treason of professors and when he wrote that
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:58.320]  in french it was a self-conscious reference to a purge of french intellectuals
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:01.680]  in the 1920s it was absolutely amazing some of the
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.840]  things that he had to say uh let me read you a quote that he had
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:08.960]  about people who were sympathetic to islamicist
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:13.920]  aims he said ought to be imprisoned attacked and as implied even killed
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:17.360]  that's what drew the most criticism they say but of course when he says that
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:21.280]  you're sympathetic to it the way that he defines this is anybody
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:25.920]  that opposes the foreign policy of war abroad
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:29.120]  see if you oppose their war member george bush
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:33.920]  you're either with us or against us that's where this essentially leads
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:39.600]  okay you have treasonous scholars who don't support his all out total war
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.840]  against islam that makes them islamic collaborators
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:47.200]  they're not funding the islamic terrorists actually that's our
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:51.600]  government that funds the islamic terrorists okay they created isis
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:54.880]  to take down syria but if you point that out and you say we don't want to have a
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:58.880]  war with syria then he says you're an islamic sympathizer you need to be
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:03.440]  jailed or imprisoned that was actually what his paper was going through so
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:06.880]  he was actually fired but this let me read you this quote
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:10.640]  doubts and disputes about this war should be muted
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:15.680]  lest around them coalesce a new set of self-imposed restraints
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:19.840]  that prevent western forces from waging war with sufficient ferocity
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:23.120]  and resolve so that either islamicism is discredited
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:26.640]  and the political will of islamic people to prosecute jihad collapses or if
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:30.400]  necessary all who countenance or condone islamicism
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:35.440]  are dead so we need to have doubts and disputes
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:39.440]  about the war be muted how do you do that you do that
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:46.080]  by controlling the press and understand that it goes way beyond
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:49.680]  apple trying to become their own news aggregator to
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:55.840]  replace the drudge report we had a year or so ago maybe it was two years ago
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:00.240]  there was a law that had prohibited the voice of america and radio free europe
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:05.280]  from broadcasting or operating in america they were set up as propaganda
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:09.600]  institutions but they were only going to be used abroad
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:13.120]  they were only going to be used against our enemies
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:17.280]  but they fairly quietly of course mainstream media didn't talk about this
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:20.880]  very much they removed that prohibition so now
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.640]  voice of america and radio free europe can propagandize americans
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:29.760]  overtly not content that the mainstream media was doing a good
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:32.320]  enough job they didn't feel like the mainstream media was doing a good enough
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:36.240]  job so now they're going to do that above board they're going to do it
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:44.080]  openly remember what james madison said he said the means of defense abroad
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:48.240]  will become instruments of tyranny at home and that's true
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:52.640]  of the first amendment as well as a physical war
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:58.480]  we're heading into a position where google is going to try to delist
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:01.760]  news articles they they already do that to a large extent but they're going to
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:04.720]  push overtly and deliberately
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:09.840]  berry news reports we're going to have aggregator sites that become embedded
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:14.320]  into your iphone like the new ios 9 system to try to make it very easy for
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:17.040]  you to use their aggregator instead of going somewhere else to look for the
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:21.600]  news if you don't fight that you are going to be
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:27.280]  losing the information that you need to be an informed citizen

[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:40.080]  29 of americans would support a military coup
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:43.840]  think about that think about how dangerous that is
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:47.440]  and then ask yourself maybe that's already happened
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:59.360]  and even more than 29% are okay with it stay with us we'll be right back

[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:14.560]  they're always presenting to you they're always saying national security

[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:40.880]  the first and foremost consideration if you have liberty
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:45.040]  you may get safety but you will never have safety if you give up your liberty

[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:57.760]  get out of the car he arrested her he took her down to the precinct she was
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:01.360]  held for several hours then released without charge but she was told that she
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:06.720]  could not pick up her 2003 bmw 320-5 ci until the
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.720]  following day she goes back the following day
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:14.880]  to get her car the police officers refused to believe
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:18.480]  that she could own that car maybe because she's black i don't know but they
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:21.840]  refused to say that they they said that's not your car we're not going to give you
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:25.120]  that car it's too luxurious you you know you don't own that car
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:32.800]  isn't that amazing isn't that amazing so she insisted and got angry i'm sure
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:37.040]  that that was her car so how did they respond well
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:41.280]  they put her in a psychological evaluation ward for eight days
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:44.560]  injected her with drugs and she wound up with a 13
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:49.120]  thousand dollar hospital bill now they're going to wind up with a lawsuit
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:53.440]  and they should end up with a lawsuit i've
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:57.120]  experienced this not even as a as a black man or
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:00.320]  you know i've had the same type of harassment myself from the police i
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:04.880]  remember when hurricane fran came through north carolina took out our
[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:08.240]  power and for the only time that we were
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:11.040]  in business we had our stores closed for several days because there was
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:14.560]  absolutely no power anywhere in the area where we had our
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:18.480]  stores one of the stores actually two of the stores got power
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:24.720]  back after three or four days and so we kept those stores open towards the end
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:28.880]  as it was starting to get dark we had some police officers come by and tell us
[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:33.280]  that we had to shut our business because they had enacted a curfew
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:37.200]  i said oh really are you going to shut down walmart across this oh no we're not
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:41.200]  going to shut down walmart you have to shut down
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:44.400]  that made me really angry but we were already shutting down because there
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:47.120]  wasn't that much traffic out there so we went ahead and shut that down we went
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:50.320]  to the next door my wife my wife was with me my
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:53.680]  sons were young they were in car seats they were in the back
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:59.600]  and we go to the next door she goes in to get the daily receipts out of the
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:04.400]  out of the safe and i'm stopped and i and i've got the engine running i've got
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:08.080]  the two kids in the back and i'll let them out of the car seat
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:12.080]  and a cop comes over to me and says uh you can't park here
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:15.600]  there was nobody else anywhere in the entire shopping center nobody else me
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:20.880]  i've got the engine running and i said i'm not parked i'm stopped
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:24.560]  and he goes hmm and he looks at the kids who are out of their car seats and goes
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:27.440]  you got to get them back in the car seats i said i'm not
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:30.800]  driving that's why they're out of the car seat i'll put them back in the car
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:34.400]  seat when i start to drive he didn't like that
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:38.720]  he had to find something so he goes give me your license and so he starts to
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:41.680]  write me i said fine we'll talk about this in court
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:44.400]  at that point my wife comes out and starts locking the door he looks over
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:49.120]  and goes well what's this and she says who are you
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:54.080]  she got into him pretty heavy and he goes uh you on this i said yeah we own
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:57.840]  this store and he goes oh i don't know and he starts to back off
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:01.360]  and i was pretty amazed i mean it wasn't that he was going to give me this
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:04.160]  made-up ticket he was going to find some reason
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:07.680]  to uh find us find some reason to give us a ticket
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:11.440]  and i just was not going to and i understand exactly where this woman is
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:15.840]  going we should not have to be the servants of law enforcement we
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:19.440]  should not have to ask how high when they tell us to jump when they
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:23.600]  give us unlawful orders we do not have to obey
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:27.040]  it is simply a power trip it is simply harassment and i'll tell you what's
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:30.720]  going on in new york city too there's another dimension to this as well
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:34.720]  and i'll talk about that when we come back what adrian schoolcraft
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:39.520]  showed when um he was a new york city police officer stay with us
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:51.360]  we'll be right back
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:02.720]  last week david knight interviewed the shean family who described decades of

[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:14.560]  vorwaller who died when he was 43 back in 2004 on his obituary his wife listed
[02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:17.680]  his cause of death was repeated and continual exposure to nuclear
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:21.120]  chemical and biological warfare agents while he was growing up in tool
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:23.440]  utah as a result of hunting and camping near the
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:26.720]  dugway proving ground alan suffered localized tumors in his

[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:34.000]  he was living down when from but then they found another type of cancer which
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.040]  was common to people exposed to biologically engineered germs

[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:45.200]  proving ground before his death alan suffered 105 degree fever which doctors
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:48.480]  concluded after exhaustive testing could only have been caused by an exotic

[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:36.400]  before i go back to the news and i want to finish up with a story of those of
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:40.000]  you who didn't hear the the top of the hour some
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:43.680]  some stations carry news at the top of the hour i'll recap briefly what
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:46.880]  happened to this black lady who was committed to a
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:50.720]  psychiatric ward because she insisted that she wanted her bmw back
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:53.680]  that they had confiscated from her before i do
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:57.600]  i want to let you know about the new introductory prices we have of our new
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:01.120]  line of info wars life select food we have for two weeks
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:04.800]  introductory prices the lowest prices you will find anywhere
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:08.480]  on storeable food and again one of the things that makes this very
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:12.720]  important very useful is the packaging that it comes in
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:16.320]  this comes in slimline totes for space saving storage
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:20.000]  it also has a ziploc each of the containers had the
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.440]  the bags the packages have ziploc containers so nothing goes to waste
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:26.960]  after you break that seal it will last for 25 years
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:31.680]  but what good would it be to have great packaging if you didn't have great food
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:36.160]  this is food that is grown in the us it is packaged in the us
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:40.960]  we don't send it to china this is all made in the us products there's no
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:46.480]  additives like msg or otolized yeast extracts this is a combination of low
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:50.720]  heat dehydrated food as well as freeze dried ingredients
[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:54.800]  that work together for maximum nutrition taste and shelf life and again
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:10:00.480]  if you buy one of the larger packages you can get more variety in what you get
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:04.400]  here's an idea of how low these prices are a two week
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:08.560]  food supply 79 96 a four week food supply
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:13.600]  156 dollars can you eat a month for 156 dollars
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:18.560]  this is incredibly cheap just as the food is going in again this is the low
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:21.040]  introductory prices it's not going to be this cheap again
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:24.800]  after this introduction but this is something that you need to have
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:28.960]  for your family we have a very fragile infrastructure in america
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:31.680]  the more complicated the infrastructure the more fragile the
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:34.960]  infrastructure and we all know that there are many
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:38.400]  things that could trigger a collapse of our infrastructure could be a natural
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:43.760]  disaster could be an economic disaster it could be some kind of a
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:47.280]  false flag who knows what could happen you need to prepare
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:51.600]  for the worst it's just common sense one way that you can do it right now
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:55.040]  is to take advantage of these super low introductory prices
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:59.120]  info wars life select food go to info wars select
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:02.240]  dot com you'll see that full line of products right there you can call
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:08.160]  888-253-3139 now before i go to the calls i want to finish up on this
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:10.720]  story i had i was talking about it at the last
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:13.760]  segment of the hour and i talked about it the first segment this hour
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:16.560]  again this is a lady who has stopped at a stoplight the
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:19.280]  the policeman started harassing her because she didn't have her hands on
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.680]  the steering wheel did you know that was a crime
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:24.400]  see this is something that we've seen happening in new york city for quite
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:28.080]  sometime it was documented by adrian schoolcraft a whistleblower
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:31.200]  with the new york city police department this is a guy whose dad was a
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:36.400]  police policeman he believed in law enforcement he
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:41.120]  believed in being a good cop he they they punished him because he would not
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:44.080]  write up useless tickets that they wanted him to do
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:48.080]  he recorded them for two years wearing a wire
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:51.280]  he did it on his own and he recorded them talking
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:55.520]  about creating quotas how they wanted to arrest people for no reason
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:58.960]  whatsoever they'd say when it was coming up to halloween they'd say just
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:02.160]  go out and grab the first three or four people you see
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:05.680]  bring them back to the station and we'll figure out what to book them for later
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:08.160]  and then go out and get some more people just need to get as many people in as
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:12.480]  we can they would harass people endlessly for nothing for nothing at all
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:16.720]  but then when it came to a serious crime like rape like car theft
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:19.440]  they would discourage people from reporting those crimes because they
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:22.400]  didn't want to look bad on the fbi statistics
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:27.200]  adrian schoolcraft exposed this they knew that he had a wire
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:31.200]  his father who was an honest cop and the kind of cop that he wanted to be
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:34.320]  knew that this was happening knew that they were gunning for him
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:38.320]  he disappeared his father started investigating couldn't figure out where
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:43.040]  he had gone they came to his house they threatened him
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:46.960]  and when he wouldn't give up the recordings they took him away and
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:50.320]  committed him just like they did this black lady
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:53.440]  the interesting thing is is that he not only had
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:13:00.000]  a wire on him in his own apartment but he also had one on the shelf
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:03.920]  and his father found that and now you can hear that as part of the
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:07.360]  investigation you can hear them threatening to
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:10.320]  take him away which they actually did they put him
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:14.080]  without notifying anybody they put him in an insane asylum his dad was able to
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:18.000]  get him out he became a key witness in these
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:21.280]  and turning and overturning a stop and frisk
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:24.880]  an amazing story but here you see this still going on
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:28.400]  harassing this lady for absolutely nothing she has her hands on the wheel
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:32.880]  they they arrest her then they let her go but they impounded her car the next
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:35.280]  day she goes to get it back they go that can't be your car
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:38.560]  you can't be somebody who owns a bmw we're not going to give you that car
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:42.240]  i don't know what basis they were saying that for
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:46.880]  but they committed her to an insane asylum she wound up staying there for
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:49.440]  eight days they injected her with heavy drugs she got a
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:52.400]  thirteen thousand dollar hospital bill and now
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:57.840]  the people of new york are going to get a big lawsuit
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:00.400]  this keeps happening you know there was an article
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:04.640]  in 2009 from the kato institute one bill of rights
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:08.640]  for you two bill of rights for them for law enforcement
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:11.360]  and they point out and this is very relevant because of what's going on with
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:15.600]  joe biden lately they say back when he was a senator vice president joe biden
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:18.560]  had a pet piece of legislation that he would try to ram through the senate
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:22.800]  every year the bill was called the peace officer's bill of rights
[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:26.480]  an attempt to amend the omnibus crime bill
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:32.080]  streets of 1968 even though biden is no longer a senator they said his legacy
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:34.960]  continues as the congressional bill that has now been
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:38.960]  introduced and back in 2009 law enforcement officers
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:43.360]  procedural bill of rights act of 2009 that was introduced that year by barth
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:47.040]  stupak democrat and eric paulson a republican and
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:50.800]  they say the legislation seeks to limit how police departments can
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:54.240]  investigate cases of police misconduct how they can
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:58.240]  discipline police officers found to have committed misconduct the bill also
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:02.320]  contains a provision that would exempt disciplinary records from public
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:06.080]  records records laws by forcing those departments to
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:12.560]  keep all personnel records sealed when we have a police chief or a
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:18.960]  sheriff who wants to come after a an officer who
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:22.480]  acted in a criminal manner he's frequently stopped by
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:27.040]  the police union or by one of these law enforcement bill of rights types of
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:30.160]  things and of course frank serpicoe who's been a
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:33.680]  guest with with alex jones many times says has made the point and
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:38.640]  rightfully so that in any profession you are going to have
[02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:42.800]  bad people cops are one of those professions
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:45.120]  you're going to have bad journalists you're going to have bad cops you're
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:50.560]  going to have criminals and every line of work but the question is
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:53.600]  can you purge those bad people out of your organization
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:57.600]  or are you going to tolerate that if you tolerate it
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:04.640]  it becomes systemic it becomes it corrupts the system and that's what we
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:07.360]  have and a large part of that is because of this law
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:12.480]  enforcement bill of rights listen to maryland's law enforcement bill of
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:16.480]  rights that was established in 1972 listen to some of these issues
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:21.280]  officers can wait 10 days before talking to investigators after trial
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:25.920]  after an incident investigators must follow must be fellow officers and no
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:30.560]  more than two can conduct questioning at the same time
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:34.640]  lying to a pain and a mission of guilt is forbidden this is standard procedure
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:39.760]  however for non-police suspects harassing threatening or offering
[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:43.120]  rewards is forbidden that's all stuff that they do
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:47.120]  to the rest of us a union representative can be present during
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:50.320]  questioning a three month statute of limitations
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:53.600]  against people filing complaints against officers even if the person is
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:57.520]  hospitalized complaints and investigations against an
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:01.280]  officer may be purged after three years you may appeal as case to a
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:04.400]  hearing board of fellow officers whose decision is binding
[02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:08.560]  before a decision on discipline is made so that's just maryland all these
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:11.840]  different states have these different bill of rights
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:15.520]  for the officers the difference between their bill of rights
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:18.880]  and our bill of rights is that they actually enforce theirs
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:22.000]  they don't enforce our bill of rights they destroy
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:25.680]  our bill of rights but they make sure that their bill of rights
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:29.360]  is enforced and so who was it that was pushing all this remember when i started
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:33.360]  this article it was joe biden that was his pet project to make sure
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:37.280]  that the police officers get a different standard
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:41.920]  of justice than the rest of us do he put that out now joe biden is being called
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:46.480]  the hamlet of the 2016 american election no
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:50.080]  not the mad prince uh not because he's crazy
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:54.080]  but because uh he's setting there to run or not to run that is the question
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:57.440]  okay they're saying that joe biden suffers uh
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:01.440]  many people say from a lifelong foot and mouth disease
[02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:05.200]  you know quite frankly joe biden has been very candid that's what's gotten him
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:09.600]  in trouble and even though he said some crazy
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:12.640]  stuff remember when he was talking about barack obama
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:15.760]  and he said i think he's very clean and a lot of people construe that say oh
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:19.040]  well he's they're saying that he's clean because he's a black man and implying
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:21.680]  you know a lot of things that he said that were really awkward
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:25.760]  nothing to the level of donald trump but that kind of
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:29.120]  foot in the mouth or if you want to call it candor
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:33.360]  okay that will serve him very well in this election cycle
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:36.480]  i mean just look at what's going on with donald trump
[02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:39.920]  my problem with joe biden even before i knew about this law enforcement bill
[02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:42.800]  of rights issue my problem with joe biden goes all the way
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:48.000]  back to the clarence thomas hearings i can remember vividly my wife and i were
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.600]  traveling uh the appellation highway and uh on
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:57.440]  vacation and we were listening to the proceedings and i heard him
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:02.080]  interrogating clarence thomas and he had a problem with natural law
[02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:05.920]  and he's trying to pin clarence thomas down on his positions on natural law
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:12.880]  and joe biden was absolutely livid genuinely angry that anybody
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:16.400]  would believe that there was such a thing as natural law what is natural law
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:19.680]  natural law is the principles that are laid down the declaration of
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:25.040]  independence that says that we are not subjects to the
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:29.440]  government we do not exist at the at the pleasure of the government they do
[02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:33.440]  not grant privileges to us we possess certain natural rights
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:36.480]  based on the fact that we're human beings we possess those rights from god
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:39.360]  those were the principles of the declaration of independence and joe
[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:43.040]  biden was absolutely livid and of course clarence thomas didn't argue with him
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:45.600]  because clarence thomas said just just forget i said that i want to be
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:50.080]  supreme court justice let's just pass on that that's the kind of guy joe biden
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:52.880]  is but he could do very well in this presidential election

[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:12.880]  some of your calls right now we were just talking about
[02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:16.880]  the police state how we've lost our bill of rights
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:21.600]  without question certainly after 9-11 there's a lot of infringements on it
[02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:26.320]  way before that but it got very overt at that point time but of course
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:29.200]  our bill of rights which is no longer being enforced the police have two
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:32.960]  bill of rights it's one of the reasons why we see such
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:38.720]  such a problem with police officers who step over the law is that there's a
[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:42.320]  systemic bias against that and of course we tied that back to
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:46.000]  joe biden that was one of the things that he pushed for many many years i've
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.800]  got a couple of callers here who want to talk about that let's go to
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:53.200]  common maryland you say you're a former police officer go ahead

[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:07.120]  liberties and breaking the law relative to
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:11.600]  fishing cases that's what we used to call it splendid would actually
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:16.240]  gather information and you're absolutely right that goes back
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:23.360]  uh i know personally uh to the 80s in fact i was working with
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:28.080]  a AT&T pollman who had come to me and said
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:31.760]  you know i've been finding these black boxes on the lines
[02:25:31.760 --> 02:25:35.600]  and what are they i looked at myself i'm not a tech i
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:40.000]  don't know but uh tell me about him he said well
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:44.080]  i think there's some type of tapping device
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:48.240]  and uh from the find out he had taken it to someone
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:52.640]  who actually didn't know and sure enough that's exactly what they were so i
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:55.200]  told him collect them bring them to me
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:59.920]  we'll try to put a case together well oddly enough
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:04.640]  he got a couple of them and uh according to him
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:08.720]  somehow he had him in his truck and he was trying to get hold of me
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:12.400]  and he was called into his office by a very nice
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:16.800]  riser who he had never dealt with before there was a federal agent there
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:21.920]  and told him to turn over what he had taken off the lines
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:26.480]  never to take those off again and not to be in touch with the local police
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:31.440]  um so that goes way back and it was something that we had suspected for
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:34.240]  some time because we had federal agents coming in and making
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:38.720]  cases that we had been working on and they had information
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:42.640]  that really we believe only could have been gotten
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:46.240]  by oh god means yes yes and they call that parallel construction
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:49.760]  now and and it's it started to unravel
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:53.360]  after people become more receptive used to be when you talk about anything like
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:56.960]  what you just mentioned there uh tom people would say how your conspiracy
[02:26:56.960 --> 02:26:59.360]  theorists that's not really happening the government would never do anything
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:03.840]  like that but after the snowden leaks people are more receptive to
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:07.760]  understanding that that in fact does go on are you familiar with the stingray
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:11.520]  program the Harris semiconductor device
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:20.480]  i've heard about it now i retired in 2003 so uh a lot of this uh it came to my
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:25.360]  knowledge after the fact i started working on some government
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:31.200]  cases towards the end of my career and we started making cases and arrests of
[02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:35.280]  government officials and in fact my unit was shut down
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:41.680]  i was out for a week on vacation and i found out that my
[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:46.800]  offices were raided by another unit within my department
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:51.840]  and my staff was fired at that time i was a commander
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:58.560]  of a unit in special operations i report directly to a colonel who was in
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:03.520]  charge of the division uh he was serving and this is where they have a lot of
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:07.120]  these people uh really by the short hairs uh a lot of
[02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:11.360]  these higher positions uh it's called serving at the pleasure of
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:18.400]  which mean uh when a new chief comes in someone uh of very high rank they can
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:23.200]  bring in their own people and then most fire do what they want to with the
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:27.920]  folks uh who are in these higher positions i happen to have the only
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:31.280]  position within special operations that wasn't serving at the
[02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:35.520]  pleasure of uh so they didn't fire me they fired
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:40.240]  everyone else except for the colonel now anybody familiar with hang on tom
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:42.960]  it's very interesting call can you hang on through the uh commercial break we
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:45.680]  got to go to a commercial break but i want to come back to you and ask you a
[02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:50.000]  couple other questions uh can you do that well we'll try to get a good okay
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.400]  great that's time for maryland former police officer
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:56.080]  stay with us we're going to be right back or i thought i heard the music
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:58.160]  coming up do we have a little bit more time
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:01.360]  okay we got another minute i'm sorry go ahead continue continue i'm sorry
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:05.200]  okay uh i'll wrap it up quick and i'll tell you something that the bill is right
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:10.640]  um so at any rate uh fired my staff all my people uh which you know was
[02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:15.600]  completely unfair to them uh and relative to the colonel if you're
[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:19.760]  familiar with any type of military paramilitary structure
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:23.280]  it's pretty tough to take the wings off of a full bird
[02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:27.840]  um they did it then and uh they put me in a patrol car for the
[02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:32.480]  rest of my career and basically sent the message to anyone uh
[02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:36.320]  coming uh on our heels and not to do what we did
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:40.000]  and that was at the gate any type of government corruption which we were
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.560]  finding a lot of now real quick with the bill
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:45.600]  hang on hang on let's hang on through the break we do have the break coming up
[02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:49.600]  right now we'll be right back stay with us if you want to call in as 800 259
[02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:59.040]  9231 on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:02.400]  over the weekend the obama administration dropped its original plans to
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:05.680]  create a website to rape colleges and instead released all the collected
[02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:08.320]  information to the public the rating system received relentless
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:11.520]  opposition from colleges universities democrats and republicans alike
[02:30:11.520 --> 02:30:14.800]  why is that you ask colleges and universities already received more
[02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:18.000]  than three times the amount of what students are paying intuition that's
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:21.840]  about 180 billion dollars a year coming from grants tax breaks work study
[02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:25.520]  funds and student loans and you know how liberals love their free money
[02:30:25.520 --> 02:30:28.320]  another interesting fact is that the department of education was given
[02:30:28.320 --> 02:30:32.160]  access to graduates tax records so they could post how much students are making
[02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:35.040]  after graduation this opens up a whole new level of personal and
[02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:38.400]  financial information that could be hacked like we saw back in june when the
[02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:41.280]  office of personal management was hacked by the chinese to get the personal
[02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:44.080]  data of four million government employees on top of that the
[02:30:44.080 --> 02:30:47.200]  information provided by this new study shows that most people are better off
[02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:50.080]  getting a job out of high school than going to college rob do reporting for

[02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:27.040]  jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today i
[02:33:27.040 --> 02:33:31.040]  asked tom from maryland who's retired police officer he said he retired
[02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:35.440]  in 2003 i asked him to hang on over the break
[02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:39.360]  because he wouldn't talk about not only the the bill of rights law enforcement
[02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:42.880]  bill of rights but also about his personal experiences in terms of black
[02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:46.320]  box recorders that were surreptitiously placed around
[02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:51.040]  what he told us was that he was alerted by some people who worked on the railroad
[02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:54.080]  to say hey we found these black boxes we think there might be some illegal
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:57.680]  wiretapping going on here as he started to investigate it he found out that this
[02:33:57.680 --> 02:34:02.080]  is something that was being done internally he was made an example of his
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:05.600]  department was made an example of course we have seen this
[02:34:05.600 --> 02:34:12.320]  subsequently probably the i'm sure the devices have changed since 2003
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:15.920]  now in the last couple of years we've seen several cases
[02:34:15.920 --> 02:34:20.160]  involving stingray devices made by harris semiconductor
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:24.320]  we have the fbi that is push that are pushing these to the local law
[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:26.880]  enforcement there was a very famous case
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:30.320]  within the last year i can't remember the exact data when this happened but
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:33.520]  they had a guy who had been arrested i think it was for burglary or something
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:36.320]  like that he was going around burglarizing houses
[02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:39.840]  and the judge asked how they got the information
[02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:45.360]  and they said well we we can't tell you says what do you mean you can't tell me
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:48.160]  and said well we have a non-disclosure agreement
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:51.040]  that we've signed that they signed with harris semiconductor he goes you don't
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:54.960]  have a non-disclosure agreement with me you're going to have to tell me
[02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:58.800]  what this is so rather than having a fight with a judge getting in contempt of
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:03.120]  court they simply let the criminal go that's called parallel construction
[02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:08.400]  they use these listening devices for the nsa or typically for the dea or
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:12.880]  whatever they get this information they don't have a legal search warrant
[02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:16.560]  and then they are given the information nevertheless
[02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:19.440]  and then because they have the information they know somebody that's
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:22.960]  doing something then they go in with parallel construction and
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:26.080]  and start to do it legally because they've been tipped off about something
[02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:29.360]  that's going on i want to get back to tom and maryland before i do
[02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:33.040]  made me think about this at the infowarstore.com we sell something
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:36.720]  called the detractor cell phone pouch it's a way to protect your cell phone
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:40.640]  from tracking eavesdropping identity theft because it's not just
[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:43.680]  the police you may not be doing anything illegal fine
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:46.880]  but do you want people to be able to hack into your phone
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:52.400]  to get information to your contact list your phone number there's no telling
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:55.680]  what people can do with the information they can find in your phone they may use
[02:35:55.680 --> 02:36:00.320]  it to rob you okay so you want to make sure that
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:04.720]  thieves can't get into your phone as well so you can get the detractor cell phone

[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:18.560]  can get it at infowarstore.com i want to go back to
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:22.080]  tom and maryland tom you said you want to talk about
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:26.560]  the bill of rights issue as well go ahead i did
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:30.160]  but you bring up a good point folks you you may not think you're doing anything
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:35.120]  wrong but the latest stats show that with all the laws that have been passed
[02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:38.720]  the old saying that ignorance of the law is no excuse really
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:43.040]  is ridiculous it really doesn't apply and uh to tell
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:47.120]  any court that you had no intent uh and you
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:50.320]  were not aware of certain laws i'm not talking about
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:54.240]  obvious felonies but uh some of these more
[02:36:54.240 --> 02:36:58.480]  ridiculous smaller laws that a lot of people don't know about even
[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:02.000]  you know you know tom some of the things that are now felonies
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:05.920]  are ridiculous there was a case uh not long ago of a
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:11.040]  man who was on a beach he released four uh mylar balloons filled with helium
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:15.600]  they were heart shaped for his sweetheart and he got busted for four counts of a
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:18.640]  felony because they had made it a felony to release
[02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:22.800]  balloons on this particular seashore because it was protected wildlife area
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:25.760]  that he didn't know about so there's a case where he's not only ignorant
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:31.600]  but it is an incredibly he's now charged with four count of felony counts
[02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:35.520]  so there's those kinds of entrapments that are always out there
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:40.320]  we talk about the reasonable man standards in court just talk about it
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:43.920]  it's applied all the time and that's what i'm talking about and
[02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:46.640]  you brought you brought to mind when you said
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:49.760]  folks you may not think you're doing okay wrong but the latest stats actually
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:54.000]  show that every american every day is breaking between
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:38:00.240]  three and six laws uh that sounds crazy but look it up google it
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:04.080]  it's actually true um and by the way before i forget
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:07.680]  i'll make it quick you talked about uh all of this
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:13.440]  land uh that the government is looking into the senators they're taking
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:17.920]  note of what they have and you were wondering i think it was yesterday
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:21.040]  exactly what was going on but they're just taking inventory of what they want
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:25.760]  to control well i uh got hold of a lien that was
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:31.280]  filed by uh china uh and it was filed interestingly enough here at the
[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:37.280]  comptroller's office in maryland it was also filed in dc
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:41.760]  and it's for all real property in the united states
[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:48.880]  and it worded very oddly uh of all for all i lean against all men and women
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:54.400]  with arms and legs and it stated a dollar amount of four trillion
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:58.560]  dollars now i'm looking in to see whether or not this actually is
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:02.720]  on record uh with these offices if you'd like a copy of it
[02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:06.720]  yeah i can talk to your screener and yeah give that to the screener i'd like
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:09.200]  to say it's that's something you found on the internet you're trying to verify
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:12.640]  whether that's true or not yeah someone said it to me
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:16.480]  and it's amazing it's a good source so um yeah i think it may actually
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:20.400]  be something that we might want to be concerned about i sort of do it right
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:24.960]  i just want to let you know it cuts both ways um i've been down that path
[02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:29.120]  before uh after uh what i told you about um
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:33.280]  like i said uh rich up was to make my life miserable and to make me an
[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:36.800]  example um and i wasn't the only one of the
[02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:41.040]  honest policemen there's a lot of them out there go down this route as well
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:44.000]  now with the police officers bill of rights it
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:48.160]  in maryland at least was designed so that police officers
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:52.240]  the police weren't taking advantage of and to give you the example like i said
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:55.840]  with military and paramilitary organizations uh
[02:39:55.840 --> 02:39:59.760]  you can be brought up on the part mental charges and
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:04.480]  you go to for instance in maryland you go to what's called a police
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:07.920]  trial board well it's like a court you go there you need an attorney
[02:40:07.920 --> 02:40:11.520]  if you want to have success and you need a good attorney it costs
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:16.640]  money and the and the real penalties um if you're convicted at these trial
[02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:20.720]  boards just like in a military tribunal so and by
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:24.720]  the way double jeopardy does not attach so you can be tried
[02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:31.440]  convicted punish severely um at the at the police tribunal
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:35.440]  and then you can be charged in state court and if they want
[02:40:35.440 --> 02:40:39.760]  they can charge you federal court i i've known where this has actually happened
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:45.360]  so you can go through the ringer three times so it does cut both ways so it
[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:49.280]  protects police when they're wrongfully charged and it
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:52.800]  does happen they go after like i said they go at the police who are trying to
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:56.800]  do the right thing now i know it can also work for the ones
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:01.200]  that are not doing the right thing and by the way also in maryland
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:06.800]  police uh that's for an example uh and i don't have a problem with this um
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:11.600]  an average citizen their peace can be disturbed a police officer
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:16.080]  peace cannot be disturbed um so that's something that
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:21.280]  uh we uh i don't have uh we're not afforded the privilege of
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:25.680]  being able to have a peace disturbed we're we have to be above that so
[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:29.120]  again this is just some of the ways that it does cut both ways
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:32.080]  well here's what i would like to see here's what i would like to see tom i
[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:37.200]  would like to see instead of the police losing rights uh way back when
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:40.880]  and then having them restored in a different and unique way
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:44.640]  and then having the rest of us lose our rights and not having them restored
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:47.680]  how about if everybody has the rights that we possess
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:50.880]  as individuals under the bill of rights and you don't lose those rights if you
[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:53.040]  become an employee of the government i mean that's
[02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:56.240]  we see that over and over again many people are talking about these clerks
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:41:59.520]  who refuse to enforce laws that they feel violate their first
[02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:03.280]  amendment rights i don't think government employees should lose
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:08.000]  their human rights that are enumerated in the constitution because they become a
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.320]  government employee i would like to see the same
[02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:15.360]  if we had the same right the the same legal structure for
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:17.920]  everybody whether they were government employee or non-government employee i
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:21.200]  think the government employees would watch out for our rights as well because
[02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:24.880]  our rights are their rights but when we have two separate standards
[02:42:24.880 --> 02:42:30.000]  then that opens the door for you know a different a preferential treatment for
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.400]  one group versus the other
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:35.840]  want me to have to investigate a bad cop we got what it says and you want me to
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:39.680]  grab him right away he shouldn't have the same rights
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:43.760]  as i said he should be we should be able to take him off the
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:46.720]  street immediately and do to him what we can't do to a
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:50.080]  regular citizen because he has the power to endanger
[02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:54.720]  people more so oftentimes with what he's being given
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:57.440]  is authority than an average citizen does so the
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:01.920]  i agree it's not a purpose so like i said it's something to be debated
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:05.600]  like i said there's arguments on both sides i see your point as well
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:09.520]  yes i agree and certainly i would like to see that happen i i just feel like
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:13.440]  this separate process where they can wait 10 days before talking to
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:16.320]  investigators and that's it it actually works the other way
[02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:20.480]  it actually keeps them in process you know it doesn't
[02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:24.400]  it doesn't it delays things rather than accelerates them thank you so much
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:27.520]  tom thank you so much for calling listening let's go to
[02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:30.400]  murphy in arkansas you said you wanted to talk about
[02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:33.760]  harassment of small business owners go ahead
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:39.280]  yeah i run a business where i do uh jobs uh you know fixed trailers
[02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:42.880]  not you know change wheels and axles and things like that
[02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:46.560]  and i plow in the winter too i put the blade on my duly
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:50.480]  and uh you know i i take care of business it's not a
[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:54.480]  you know glamour is living but uh you know it's a living
[02:43:54.480 --> 02:44:00.480]  now the police around here they've been making it uh basically impossible
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:04.480]  you know uh using them laws to uh try and
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:09.200]  make it so i can't do my job they gave me tickets for uh
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:13.600]  having the snow plow uh the blade on my truck for too long
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:17.760]  they uh you know they've been harassing me and everything else
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:21.280]  i just don't understand why they think they can do this
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:25.200]  to uh you know your average american and have us not
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:28.240]  you know rise up against them or something like that well you know what
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:31.680]  you're in arkansas and when i was talking about what was going on in
[02:44:31.680 --> 02:44:35.920]  new york city that's exactly what that uh whistleblower within the new york
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:39.040]  city police department adrian schoolcraft was talking about he said they
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:42.480]  want me to go around and harass small business owners that
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:46.400]  go into the barbershops and and write them summonses because they've got
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:49.280]  too much hair on the floor because somebody is smoking in the barbershop or
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:53.120]  if they go outside and they stand outside of the barbershop to smoke
[02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:56.480]  then i give them a ticket for they want me to give them a ticket for loitering
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:01.200]  so it's that type of thing they would be on top of everybody very closely
[02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:05.440]  for minor infractions that are going to generate revenue for the new york police
[02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:09.280]  department remember that eric garner the guy that was choked to death
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:12.800]  on the street was selling loose cigarettes you would buy the cigarettes pay
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:15.600]  the taxes and then break them up and sell them individually they didn't want
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:19.280]  that to happen because they wanted to collect taxes uh on each and every
[02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:23.520]  individual cell so they started harassing him and it turned into a
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:26.640]  confrontation because he said he wasn't wasn't selling him that day
[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:29.840]  turns in turned into a fight he got choked to death
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:33.440]  so we see that kind of pattern whether it's in new york city or whether it's in
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:36.720]  arkansas that the police are really more
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:43.040]  interested uh murphy and in enforcing policy enacted at the local level as
[02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:46.240]  kind of meter maids or tax collectors at the local level
[02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:50.400]  and not so much interested anymore in protecting people from violent crime
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:53.920]  because as we saw in new york if they report violent crime if they
[02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:57.520]  investigate that then they look bad as a police department on the fbi
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:00.160]  statistics
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:04.080]  yeah there's no doubt about that i mean what the police are doing nowadays
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:07.440]  is nothing more than uh revenue generation
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:11.360]  and uh tyranny you know it's just straight up here and i mean
[02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:16.160]  if my son who is 13 years old wants to smoke cigarettes i don't see what the
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:20.000]  problem is to be honest with you we do that in the trailer park all the time
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:23.440]  yeah what is the problem with that yeah exactly thank you so much murphy
[02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:27.920]  i want to move on to uh vet and fema region number nine want to talk about
[02:46:27.920 --> 02:46:33.120]  the uh tpp we talked about that earlier go ahead vet
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:39.440]  yeah hi can you hear me okay yes i got you i got you okay uh let's see yeah i
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:44.960]  got a couple things i know you guys have a big money bomb coming up and i thought
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:50.160]  hey what if uh what if the equal wars started some kind of campaign
[02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:53.840]  that really kind of go against this whole tyrannical
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:47:00.400]  tgip and tpp etc etc and i have a great idea for you but because
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:03.520]  we wouldn't want to lose the element of surprise with this
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:06.800]  i think i'd want to talk with you with you guys um
[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:10.960]  off the air about what what the idea is for a for a big like
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:14.960]  an advertising of billboard campaign that basically kind of
[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:18.880]  take on um the trans specific partnership head on
[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:22.560]  okay great yeah give that information to uh our call screener
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:26.720]  and uh he'll email that to us but uh yeah that that's not something we can't
[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:30.320]  get a billboard campaign up before the money bomb because that's going to be
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:34.480]  just the next couple of days but certainly uh we all need to work against
[02:47:34.480 --> 02:47:39.440]  the trans specific partnership and as i mentioned earlier i'm very happy to see
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:44.400]  that donald trump is using this as a campaign issue he's
[02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:48.640]  met with senator sessions who really knows what's going on
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:53.200]  and i think it's more than just a political issue i you know at first
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:56.880]  donald trump says i i don't agree with the tpp because i don't trust obama to
[02:47:56.880 --> 02:48:01.040]  be the negotiator well you know what i don't trust any individual
[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:04.800]  to negotiate this stuff and do it in secret including trump
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:07.600]  if he becomes president i don't think it should be done that way we have a
[02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:10.960]  constitutional process this is a treaty we need to call it a
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:13.680]  treaty we need to make sure that it has to pass
[02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:19.440]  by 67 senators that the document itself is not negotiated and kept secret from
[02:48:19.440 --> 02:48:22.160]  the public as this is being done this is being crafted
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:26.160]  over a number of years by corporate lawyers we know that it involves
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:32.080]  far more than just trade this involves many aspects of sovereignty so i have
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:34.480]  an issue with a lot of these things but one of the things that was encouraging
[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:38.560]  though was that when donald trump met with senator sessions he came out of
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:42.400]  the meeting and he said hey china can be added to this after the fact and
[02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:46.560]  that's what what senator sessions has been trying to explain to people that
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:51.120]  this creates a transnational governments a governance commission
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:54.480]  that can change the parameters of these agreements
[02:48:54.480 --> 02:49:00.800]  at will without any involvement from our elected leaders we are not stakeholders
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:03.920]  in this understand that when they talk about stakeholders they're not talking
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:06.480]  about you and me they're not talking about our
[02:49:06.480 --> 02:49:09.760]  representatives that's why it is kept secret from our
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:13.440]  representatives because we have no stake in the future
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:16.880]  that they are planning and it needs to be stopped and for whatever reason
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:20.240]  i don't care if it's for his political campaign or whatever if he can lend his

[02:49:53.520 --> 02:50:01.760]  the cops in way back in 1984 where my husband and i were 22 years old
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:05.440]  on a four-lane highway in the middle of north dakota
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:12.720]  and pulled up behind the state trooper that was going exactly the speed limit
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:17.200]  now we were driving three and a half hours to get back to college so we just
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:23.360]  pulled into the past lane you know went a couple miles faster than he was going
[02:50:23.360 --> 02:50:27.600]  carefully pulled over and he immediately turned his lights on
[02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:34.720]  my husband pulled over and by the time he was up to the car window
[02:50:34.720 --> 02:50:42.560]  he had his gun out wow and yes he demanded that my husband

[02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:10.240]  electronic pickpocketing ten years ago i created a way to protect my own cards
[02:51:10.240 --> 02:51:13.200]  from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing
[02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:16.800]  a national id card with a built-in radio chip called rfid
[02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:20.960]  i felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy
[02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:24.960]  soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit cards us passports
[02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:29.440]  hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate rfid
[02:51:29.440 --> 02:51:32.880]  it was then i formed id stronghold to share my inventions and blocking rfid
[02:51:32.880 --> 02:51:37.520]  signals with the world there are a lot of misconceptions out there today about rfid
[02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:40.720]  i encourage everyone to get informed and get protected

[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:12.480]  telling us about being pulled over by police officer she said he was going
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:15.680]  to speed limit they weren't a hurry they pulled past him
[02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:19.760]  about three miles an hour faster than he was immediately put on his lights pull
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:23.440]  them over and then got out of the car with his gun drawn so we wanted to hear
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:30.400]  what happened next jean well i was just absolutely floored
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:36.400]  that he had his gun out i'd been ticketed many times for speeding and
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:40.000]  and i've never seen this but it was dark it was night
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:44.880]  in middle of nowhere no traffic he asked my husband to get out of the car he
[02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:51.360]  told me to stay where i was and he had my husband walk around the
[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:56.240]  back of the car to the trunk i thought i was going to lose
[02:56:56.240 --> 02:57:01.520]  my husband really i was scared to death i wanted to search the car for drugs is
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:06.800]  that it no he just gave him this big lecture of
[02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:11.840]  how dare he passed the state trooper and blah blah blah he went on and on and on
[02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:15.360]  gave him this big lecture it was just intimidation
[02:57:15.360 --> 02:57:21.120]  wow wow but to have his gun out well we just saw that recently with a
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:25.360]  situation a guy was filming a police officer and you can see the police
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:28.240]  officer pulling his gun out and the guy saying are you serious
[02:57:28.240 --> 02:57:31.280]  you're pulling your gun i'm standing here with a camera and you're pulling your
[02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:34.800]  gun out the guy says what are you some kind of constitutionalist or something
[02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:38.400]  i mean that type of thing happens the other side of this though has also
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:42.160]  happened i had an experience years ago in montana before i think they've
[02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:44.560]  enacted a speed limit law and we were going through it at the time they
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:48.320]  didn't have a speed limit law we were going because there's no speed limit
[02:57:48.320 --> 02:57:51.920]  and it's a large area we were going well over 100 miles an hour
[02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:55.760]  and i saw a cop and we just went right past him
[02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:59.440]  and i was surprised when he turned on the lights and he pulled us over and said
[02:57:59.440 --> 02:58:02.640]  i didn't think you had a speed limit here and he says we don't have a speed
[02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:05.280]  limit but i just want to let you know that there's some road construction up
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:08.080]  ahead you might want to slow down a little bit have a good day and it's like

[03:00:35.680 --> 03:00:38.080]  now tell us what you're going to be talking about this next hour
[03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:42.160]  well i kind of want to talk to the callers and see what do they think we
[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:46.800]  should be focusing on with this next debate every election cycle
[03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:51.680]  we always seem to be taken back and forth between the identity politics and
[03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:56.160]  never really get to the real issues a lot of things are happening i mean the
[03:00:56.160 --> 03:00:59.120]  economy's tanking we're going to have a student loan
[03:00:59.120 --> 03:01:02.960]  debt crisis here as well and i i think a lot of people just
[03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:06.160]  you know they're getting a little bit distracted with some things that aren't
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:09.920]  aren't really important which of course is by design
[03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:13.280]  absolutely it's all about identity politics if you look at that first
[03:01:13.280 --> 03:01:17.520]  debate uh that fox news did it was all about them
[03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:21.200]  individually or they might have if they were governor will explain to us how
[03:01:21.200 --> 03:01:24.800]  you're going to fix the economy single-handedly from the white house
[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:27.760]  you know how many jobs did you create how many jobs are you planning on
[03:01:27.760 --> 03:01:32.320]  creating you know it's absolute insanity uh the the level of
[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:34.800]  questions that they have there and of course there's many topics
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:38.080]  that are completely off limits it's one of the reasons why
[03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:42.560]  i really want to see ran paul in these debates because he's the only one that's
[03:01:42.560 --> 03:01:46.960]  talking about so many issues of limiting government in terms of
[03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:52.560]  surveillance in terms of the abuse of police power trying to get back
[03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:56.720]  the rights that we possess as human beings that are explicitly recognized in
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:02:00.240]  the constitution nobody else is even concerned about that leon right well
[03:02:00.240 --> 03:02:03.440]  and and that's the other thing i do i agree with you that there with ran paul i
[03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:06.800]  mean he's consistently been fighting against the
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:10.240]  surveillance state so these are things that are on his record it's not just
[03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:12.320]  oh hey i'm running for president now all of a
[03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:16.560]  sudden i care about the constitution or i'm gonna give you some empty rhetoric
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:19.680]  here about our jobs and this and that i mean he's been spoken out about the
[03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:22.640]  drone program and how are we going to use that here
[03:02:22.640 --> 03:02:27.040]  on us soil and you know so i think that that's
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:30.240]  something very important which of course is the reason why they probably
[03:02:30.240 --> 03:02:33.040]  gave him about the last five minutes of the debate
[03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:36.640]  yes so i mean it's just this media circus they're going to go to whoever's
[03:02:36.640 --> 03:02:39.920]  going to get them the ratings and just divide the country
[03:02:39.920 --> 03:02:43.200]  even further we're historically divided right now
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:46.960]  um well a celebrity big brother right it really is celebrity big brother we get
[03:02:46.960 --> 03:02:50.560]  to pick a new big brother a new dictator every four years
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:54.000]  that doesn't make us free that's not our form of government but it has really
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:58.640]  become a tv reality show and i think we've seen
[03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:01.760]  the voters especially republicans but also democrats as well
[03:03:01.760 --> 03:03:05.360]  i mean there are many things that obama promised to do that he didn't do
[03:03:05.360 --> 03:03:09.200]  and many things that that his constituency did not want to see done but
[03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:12.400]  but look at the republicans look at bainer and mcconnell they said they were
[03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:15.760]  going to stop obama care they were going to close the borders
[03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:18.960]  we might have had a clue that they weren't going to do that since
[03:03:18.960 --> 03:03:22.640]  while they were in office they never did a single thing along that direction
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:25.520]  you're talking about rand paul he's actually introduced legislation to do a
[03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:28.560]  lot of the things that he's talking about but of course bainer and mcconnell
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:32.080]  had blocked legislation to do these sorts of things and then they
[03:03:32.080 --> 03:03:35.600]  blocked it after they became after they were reelected so
[03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:39.760]  not really a surprise there yet the republican voters seem to be surprised
[03:03:39.760 --> 03:03:43.440]  and so when you see these guys come up and talk about some of these issues
[03:03:43.440 --> 03:03:46.960]  you really have to ask yourself do they have the integrity
[03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:51.440]  to pull this off can i trust this person to that level it does matter
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:55.280]  something about their personal integrity can you trust their word
[03:03:55.280 --> 03:03:58.800]  yeah what you know what's their record and that's what you know don't
[03:03:58.800 --> 03:04:02.480]  don't give us empty rhetoric and lies or what what will you do
[03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:06.720]  what have you done exactly and i mean granted in the first debate trump comes
[03:04:06.720 --> 03:04:10.960]  out and says that he's paid off politicians in the past so
[03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:14.640]  yeah that's his record yeah and when we look at things like when we look at
[03:04:14.640 --> 03:04:18.320]  ben karson for example a lot of people like ben karson they feel like they
[03:04:18.320 --> 03:04:21.440]  can trust him because they have been lied to so much by politicians they're
[03:04:21.440 --> 03:04:25.520]  very anxious to get somebody who is outside the political process i understand
[03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:29.120]  that i feel that as well but it isn't like he hasn't made
[03:04:29.120 --> 03:04:33.040]  statements in the past when he talked about second amendment rights he said
[03:04:33.040 --> 03:04:37.040]  that that was fine for people in the in the country but people in the city
[03:04:37.040 --> 03:04:40.480]  didn't really need that he favored mandatory
[03:04:40.480 --> 03:04:44.320]  vaccinations that's a real warning signal that there's something
[03:04:44.320 --> 03:04:48.160]  fundamentally wrong about his understanding of individual liberty
[03:04:48.160 --> 03:04:51.440]  stay with us when we come back leon macadoo will be taking over the show
[03:04:51.440 --> 03:04:55.040]  doing the fourth hour of wrap up
[03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:02.240]  over the weekend the obama administration dropped its original plans to
[03:05:02.240 --> 03:05:05.520]  create a website to rate colleges and instead released all the collected
[03:05:05.520 --> 03:05:08.160]  information to the public the rating system received relentless
[03:05:08.160 --> 03:05:11.360]  opposition from colleges universities democrats and republicans alike
[03:05:11.360 --> 03:05:14.560]  why is that you ask colleges and universities already received more
[03:05:14.560 --> 03:05:17.040]  than three times the amount of what students are paying
[03:05:17.040 --> 03:05:20.480]  intuition that's about 180 billion dollars a year coming from grants
[03:05:20.480 --> 03:05:24.400]  tax breaks work study funds and student loans and you know how liberals love
[03:05:24.400 --> 03:05:26.720]  their free money another interesting fact is that the
[03:05:26.720 --> 03:05:30.560]  department of education was given access to graduates tax records so they could
[03:05:30.560 --> 03:05:33.920]  post how much students are making after graduation this opens up a whole new
[03:05:33.920 --> 03:05:37.040]  level of personal and financial information that could be hacked like
[03:05:37.040 --> 03:05:39.760]  we saw back in june when the office of personal management was hacked by the
[03:05:39.760 --> 03:05:43.600]  chinese to get the personal data of four million government employees on top of
[03:05:43.600 --> 03:05:46.480]  that the information provided by this new study shows that most people are
[03:05:46.480 --> 03:05:49.440]  better off getting a job out of high school than going to college rob do

[03:08:40.960 --> 03:08:44.960]  gop debate as well as the rest of this election cycle we know the
[03:08:44.960 --> 03:08:48.960]  establishment media really kind of tries to push us into
[03:08:48.960 --> 03:08:53.280]  arguing about what they tell us is important and then you know we
[03:08:53.280 --> 03:08:56.800]  we've seen time and time again we elect celebrities
[03:08:56.800 --> 03:09:00.720]  who just you know give us empty rhetoric and don't really get to the real
[03:09:00.720 --> 03:09:04.000]  issues we're also going to be talking a lot about
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:09.520]  the relevancy of higher education coming up as well so anyone that has any
[03:09:09.520 --> 03:09:13.360]  stories about that issues they're having with student loans and maybe some
[03:09:13.360 --> 03:09:17.040]  success stories where they've branched out on their own
[03:09:17.040 --> 03:09:20.240]  and how you know they were able to succeed without
[03:09:20.240 --> 03:09:25.600]  going into massive debt now i just obviously wanted to say a huge thank you
[03:09:25.600 --> 03:09:28.640]  to alex jones for giving me this opportunity to
[03:09:28.640 --> 03:09:33.600]  helm the ship of one of the most biggest and baddest radio shows in the

[03:09:54.720 --> 03:09:58.160]  interviews we haven't aired i think we're going to be having some
[03:09:58.160 --> 03:10:05.200]  items up for auction possibly some artwork so that's very exciting
[03:10:05.200 --> 03:10:08.640]  you know still some secrets there i can't spill everything but we're
[03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:12.720]  really excited that's going to be really awesome so
[03:10:12.720 --> 03:10:17.440]  i guess i'm going to go ahead and open up the the phone lines now
[03:10:17.440 --> 03:10:23.920]  to let's see um jeff in canada he wants to talk about the
[03:10:23.920 --> 03:10:28.480]  presidential debates go ahead jeff good afternoon leon thanks for taking my
[03:10:28.480 --> 03:10:31.360]  call how are you i'm doing all right thanks
[03:10:31.360 --> 03:10:34.720]  good the end you know here's what i think we should be focused on on this next
[03:10:34.720 --> 03:10:38.400]  round of debates from from the u.s absolutely nothing
[03:10:38.400 --> 03:10:42.320]  turn off the television it's an absolute distraction
[03:10:42.320 --> 03:10:46.000]  even insinuating thinking that we have to
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:51.840]  somehow expose ourselves to more of a false paradigm a left right paradigm
[03:10:51.840 --> 03:10:55.600]  is insulting to my intelligence i have absolutely nothing
[03:10:55.600 --> 03:10:58.800]  to learn from a fascist named donald trump
[03:10:58.800 --> 03:11:03.040]  um from uh has been socialists like bernie sanders
[03:11:03.040 --> 03:11:08.400]  a war criminal like hillary clinton there's absolutely nothing to learn from this
[03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:13.520]  debate but maybe for sheep there is maybe the sheep can question why
[03:11:13.520 --> 03:11:17.200]  this seems to be this dynasty of clinton's and bush's you seem to be
[03:11:17.200 --> 03:11:20.400]  obsessed with clinton's and and and the bush's
[03:11:20.400 --> 03:11:24.160]  it's like a 28 year reign if you go back to
[03:11:24.160 --> 03:11:27.920]  when george bush was vice president for ronald rake and prior to that he was a
[03:11:27.920 --> 03:11:31.440]  cia director if the sheep in america and canada do not
[03:11:31.440 --> 03:11:35.200]  realize that this juncture at this point of the game that we're being
[03:11:35.200 --> 03:11:38.720]  lied to manipulated and that politics is the biggest
[03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:42.480]  wrestling match going i don't even understand where we're talking about it
[03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:45.680]  on any rewards i mean i don't even understand why
[03:11:45.680 --> 03:11:50.160]  uh or even thinking that we like a fascist like donald trump because that's
[03:11:50.160 --> 03:11:54.160]  exactly what donald trump is he's a fascist and he's going to say
[03:11:54.160 --> 03:12:01.040]  anything and do anything to rope in ignorant sheep misguided sheep
[03:12:01.040 --> 03:12:04.240]  and quite frankly i think that part of the show or this
[03:12:04.240 --> 03:12:06.960]  discussion is just a little bit of a distraction but that's okay i appreciate
[03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:08.880]  you taking my call i thank you for your time
[03:12:08.880 --> 03:12:12.400]  well thank you now obviously we have uh hillary
[03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:18.000]  kind of taking a a nosedive in the polls so i mean is that a uh you know is that
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:20.960]  something that get boosting the confidence there in the voting public
[03:12:20.960 --> 03:12:26.160]  that perhaps they're finally starting to see behind the curtain and that perhaps
[03:12:26.160 --> 03:12:29.920]  you know hillary clinton's crimes are catching up with her i'm gonna
[03:12:29.920 --> 03:12:34.080]  throw to a john bound report here in just a few minutes but
[03:12:34.080 --> 03:12:39.120]  i'm gonna go ahead and take another phone call from lauren in ohio go ahead
[03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:42.320]  lauren hey i have to agree with that man that
[03:12:42.320 --> 03:12:46.080]  just called i was i voted for clinton um i was in my
[03:12:46.080 --> 03:12:50.400]  you know early 20s and i watched this thing go back and forth
[03:12:50.400 --> 03:12:53.360]  and what i came to understand when i voted for clinton and he said that he
[03:12:53.360 --> 03:12:56.320]  wouldn't vote for nafta with an eight to one wage differential
[03:12:56.320 --> 03:13:00.320]  is that politicians lie and so when i started researching
[03:13:00.320 --> 03:13:03.200]  what exactly is our government supposed to be
[03:13:03.200 --> 03:13:06.880]  it's supposed to be them constrained by the constitution
[03:13:06.880 --> 03:13:11.840]  not them telling us what to do so i'm kind of on the same vein he has come out
[03:13:11.840 --> 03:13:14.880]  of her my people stop paying attention to these fools
[03:13:14.880 --> 03:13:19.040]  and stop doing what they say when they say take vaccines no when they say put
[03:13:19.040 --> 03:13:22.560]  your children in school no when they say eat poison food
[03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:28.240]  no and you go your own way they can only control you if you believe they have the
[03:13:28.240 --> 03:13:32.320]  power and then you yield and obey illegitimate authority of
[03:13:32.320 --> 03:13:36.240]  government workers instead of obeying the god that created you that tells you if
[03:13:36.240 --> 03:13:40.000]  a man doesn't work nor shall he eat you know you're not supposed to be having
[03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:44.160]  welfare and all this free money for um illegals that come here all you have to
[03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:46.560]  do is stop that flow is stop giving him money
[03:13:46.560 --> 03:13:50.800]  but the criminals who are helming the government at this point
[03:13:50.800 --> 03:13:55.840]  are using our resources and our allegiance to do what they say
[03:13:55.840 --> 03:14:00.320]  so my quick answer for this is first obey god ten commandments it's easy
[03:14:00.320 --> 03:14:03.600]  you know nobody wants to be stolen from nobody wants to be murdered nobody
[03:14:03.600 --> 03:14:06.080]  wants to have you know their things coveted by other
[03:14:06.080 --> 03:14:09.680]  people like bernie sanders obey the ten is my motto
[03:14:09.680 --> 03:14:13.280]  then the second thing keep your money in your pocket quit giving them tax money
[03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:16.080]  you don't owe them if you don't understand check out
[03:14:16.080 --> 03:14:22.480]  white paris w e i s s paris dot com and this man has won two thousand cases in
[03:14:22.480 --> 03:14:28.080]  us tax court old using the law and it shows you exactly how to volunteer
[03:14:28.080 --> 03:14:32.400]  out of the irs system that you basically enrolled in when you fill out your
[03:14:32.400 --> 03:14:35.920]  1040 and also keep your children in your home or
[03:14:35.920 --> 03:14:39.680]  put them in a private setting where they actually learn the truth instead of
[03:14:39.680 --> 03:14:42.720]  putting them in these schools that keeps them lives you were
[03:14:42.720 --> 03:14:46.880]  talking about the uselessness of advanced education my children can go to
[03:14:46.880 --> 03:14:50.080]  college free they have a fund that they can go to college free
[03:14:50.080 --> 03:14:52.960]  they're not going they're going and getting their naturopathic
[03:14:52.960 --> 03:14:56.240]  doctorates things that are real that they can use to
[03:14:56.240 --> 03:14:59.440]  to do something constructive in this life not going
[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:03.600]  to fool around for four or five or six years to learn nothing except how to be
[03:15:03.600 --> 03:15:07.360]  a socialist and you know how to blame other people for what's wrong in your
[03:15:07.360 --> 03:15:10.240]  life exactly the last thing is boycott big
[03:15:10.240 --> 03:15:12.880]  business because the biggest business in this
[03:15:12.880 --> 03:15:16.160]  world is the united states corporation government
[03:15:16.160 --> 03:15:19.520]  so we have to understand that the constitution
[03:15:19.520 --> 03:15:22.960]  god made the men the men made a club the club made rules codes regulations and
[03:15:22.960 --> 03:15:27.040]  statutes for the maids and the butlers that work for the government to obey
[03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:31.440]  if we understand things properly we'll realize that we are never
[03:15:31.440 --> 03:15:34.880]  if you just look at when the congress was supposed to meet they were supposed
[03:15:34.880 --> 03:15:38.240]  to come together the first monday of december
[03:15:38.240 --> 03:15:42.320]  which means they were home by january they changed that to the first
[03:15:42.320 --> 03:15:46.400]  tuesday in january so they could meet all year to run our lives
[03:15:46.400 --> 03:15:49.040]  they can only get away with this because we keep going along with it
[03:15:49.040 --> 03:15:52.960]  and it needs to stop we need to arrest the bankers we need to arrest the
[03:15:52.960 --> 03:15:57.680]  in charge these people with treason and and go after them and the and the last
[03:15:57.680 --> 03:16:01.760]  thing is we need to start a movement to pay off the federal reserve it's like
[03:16:01.760 --> 03:16:06.240]  what a half a million dollars right well you're absolutely right it is time to
[03:16:06.240 --> 03:16:10.160]  throw these politicians out and they do seem to ram through
[03:16:10.160 --> 03:16:14.560]  some really questionable things and then they go on a long vacation and then
[03:16:14.560 --> 03:16:18.960]  deal with the fallout when they get back it's become such a joke
[03:16:18.960 --> 03:16:22.080]  now i'm going to play a report lauren thank you it sounds like your kids have
[03:16:22.080 --> 03:16:26.000]  a really great role model in you uh thanks for the call now i'm going to
[03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:30.160]  throw to a uh john bound report which he's basically putting it on
[03:16:30.160 --> 03:16:33.360]  display hillary clinton her campaign will do
[03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:36.400]  anything to win but it looks like her polls
[03:16:36.400 --> 03:16:44.320]  uh the numbers there are tanking so let's go to that report
[03:16:44.320 --> 03:16:48.240]  hillary clinton's campaign has gradually gone from a bid for the highest
[03:16:48.240 --> 03:16:52.160]  seat in the land to a bona fide deplorable circus of failure
[03:16:52.160 --> 03:16:56.640]  but bill clinton's first man ticket to four more years of a new world order
[03:16:56.640 --> 03:17:00.800]  backed gravy train just keeps on moving down the track
[03:17:00.800 --> 03:17:04.880]  pay no attention to the campaign stop in columbus ohio that looks more like
[03:17:04.880 --> 03:17:08.720]  everyone on hillary's bust just pretended to be the crowd
[03:17:08.720 --> 03:17:13.440]  according to ed henry's pictures one photo shows the tiny crowd and the other
[03:17:13.440 --> 03:17:17.440]  shows the rest of the empty hall and this wasn't some small town in the
[03:17:17.440 --> 03:17:21.680]  middle of nowhere columbus ohio is the 15th largest city in
[03:17:21.680 --> 03:17:25.120]  america perhaps she thought folks from the columbus
[03:17:25.120 --> 03:17:29.840]  neighborhood of clintonville or ohio state university would turn out
[03:17:29.840 --> 03:17:34.080]  well they didn't and we can go in america we're every father
[03:17:34.080 --> 03:17:38.720]  saving his daughter you can grow up to be president of the united states
[03:17:38.720 --> 03:17:43.600]  it has gotten so bad supporting hillary's damaged criminal and blood on
[03:17:43.600 --> 03:17:46.720]  her hands reputation might get you punched in the face
[03:17:46.720 --> 03:17:50.640]  they thought it said hillary for president so i'm sitting here in the
[03:17:50.640 --> 03:17:53.200]  bartender finally walks over and he goes you know what
[03:17:53.200 --> 03:17:56.720]  i've been paying some back and forth back here just so angry
[03:17:56.720 --> 03:18:01.920]  that you would walk into my establishment wearing a hillary for president 2016
[03:18:01.920 --> 03:18:05.760]  shirt and then i noticed it had hillary for prison
[03:18:05.760 --> 03:18:09.040]  he said i was seconds away from sending my bar back over here to
[03:18:09.040 --> 03:18:12.560]  to punch you in the face he said you know what since you're wearing a hillary
[03:18:12.560 --> 03:18:16.960]  for prison shirt you don't have to buy drinks here everything's on the house
[03:18:16.960 --> 03:18:20.320]  the astonishing power of james oakief's investigative
[03:18:20.320 --> 03:18:23.840]  divulgence reveals the hubris within her dismal
[03:18:23.840 --> 03:18:28.960]  inner circle project veritas put the hillary campaign on high paranoia alert
[03:18:28.960 --> 03:18:33.040]  after staff was approached by two women attempting to catch the campaign
[03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:37.200]  in illegal activity that appeared to be members of project veritas
[03:18:37.200 --> 03:18:40.240]  project veritas spokesman daniel pollock replied
[03:18:40.240 --> 03:18:43.840]  project veritas does not comment on investigations
[03:18:43.840 --> 03:18:49.360]  real or imagined what project veritas did uncover is that hillary's staff will
[03:18:49.360 --> 03:18:54.480]  do anything to solicit votes even violate state election laws
[03:18:54.480 --> 03:18:59.360]  this is christina gupana a los vegas attorney and campaign worker
[03:18:59.360 --> 03:19:03.520]  she helps manage the clinton campaign's voter registration drive
[03:19:03.520 --> 03:19:08.000]  do whatever you can yeah do whatever whatever you can get away with just do it
[03:19:08.000 --> 03:19:13.360]  until you get kicked out like totally quote a county clerk field registrar
[03:19:13.360 --> 03:19:17.760]  employee of a voter registration agency or person assisting a voter

[03:25:04.080 --> 03:25:07.680]  now donald trump obviously he's the frontrunner there
[03:25:07.680 --> 03:25:11.600]  on the republican side he's made a lot of comments that people are
[03:25:11.600 --> 03:25:15.120]  you know they're they're a little upset with and people are saying that trump
[03:25:15.120 --> 03:25:18.640]  has become so popular because of this white
[03:25:18.640 --> 03:25:22.240]  nationalism movement well he's getting support from
[03:25:22.240 --> 03:25:28.640]  an interesting party it's a rapper azalea banks and she is saying how trump's
[03:25:28.640 --> 03:25:32.000]  message basically should be resonating with black
[03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:36.160]  voters now azalea banks she's a rapper you may recall she made
[03:25:36.160 --> 03:25:39.840]  headlines in march of this year she was declaring her
[03:25:39.840 --> 03:25:44.480]  hatred for this country and white americans she's
[03:25:44.480 --> 03:25:47.360]  kind of one of these people that's her own worst enemy
[03:25:47.360 --> 03:25:50.480]  her record keeps getting pushed back and stuff like this because she's very
[03:25:50.480 --> 03:25:54.480]  outspoken but now on september 7th she wrote on her
[03:25:54.480 --> 03:25:58.640]  instagram account do you think it's bad that i sort of agree with trump's
[03:25:58.640 --> 03:26:02.560]  stance on immigration and she explained that
[03:26:02.560 --> 03:26:07.040]  her support for for his plan is based on the detrimental impact that mass
[03:26:07.040 --> 03:26:09.840]  immigration has had on the black community
[03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:13.840]  she says black americans still have not been paid reparations for slavery
[03:26:13.840 --> 03:26:17.680]  it's selfish but america has been really good at convincing me
[03:26:17.680 --> 03:26:22.000]  that everyone else's problems are more important than my own
[03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:26.080]  and if the united states of america is an aircraft on its way down
[03:26:26.080 --> 03:26:30.080]  i must put on my own air mask before i assist others
[03:26:30.080 --> 03:26:33.040]  and this is of course something we're saying all the time i mean it's it's
[03:26:33.040 --> 03:26:38.400]  heart-wrenching to see these images of capsized boats and you know children
[03:26:38.400 --> 03:26:41.840]  crossing the border here at our own southern border and things
[03:26:41.840 --> 03:26:46.480]  like that it is heart-wrenching to see this that people are trying to escape
[03:26:46.480 --> 03:26:49.760]  gang violence and poverty but at the same time
[03:26:49.760 --> 03:26:53.680]  look at what's going on in our country we have children here who
[03:26:53.680 --> 03:26:58.720]  who can't eat you know three meals a day things like that a lot of families are
[03:26:58.720 --> 03:27:02.400]  suffering record unemployment and yet we're bringing in more
[03:27:02.400 --> 03:27:06.720]  people to to live off of this welfare state of course
[03:27:06.720 --> 03:27:12.640]  all of that is by design and now this goes on to say
[03:27:12.640 --> 03:27:16.480]  you know that an increase in immigration
[03:27:16.480 --> 03:27:19.760]  as far as the black community is concerned they're going to be
[03:27:19.760 --> 03:27:23.360]  taking the jobs why would you want to flood the country with more people who
[03:27:23.360 --> 03:27:27.040]  are going to compete for jobs black americans are
[03:27:27.040 --> 03:27:30.400]  currently unemployed at twice the rate of white americans
[03:27:30.400 --> 03:27:34.960]  and real average wages are lower today than they were in 1973
[03:27:34.960 --> 03:27:38.800]  which of course was shortly after there was a huge green card
[03:27:38.800 --> 03:27:42.960]  gusher that happened lower wages means an increase in
[03:27:42.960 --> 03:27:47.840]  incarceration and of course who's going to be paying for all of this and the
[03:27:47.840 --> 03:27:51.200]  answer is we're all going to be paying for this
[03:27:51.200 --> 03:27:56.800]  now senator jeff sessions says if your goal is to create more stable social
[03:27:56.800 --> 03:28:00.000]  conditions greater access to the middle class higher
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:03.440]  unemployment and wage rates then it is clear that you should stop
[03:28:03.440 --> 03:28:07.440]  adding millions more low skilled workers to the labor market
[03:28:07.440 --> 03:28:12.720]  particularly at a time when automation is steadily reducing demands for workers
[03:28:12.720 --> 03:28:16.320]  so i mean my goodness the writing is there on the wall where
[03:28:16.320 --> 03:28:20.640]  we're going to see just some catastrophic future for us as well
[03:28:20.640 --> 03:28:24.480]  if we don't get this under control who cares if this message
[03:28:24.480 --> 03:28:28.720]  isn't really popular with a lot of people it's something that we need to be
[03:28:28.720 --> 03:28:33.120]  concerned about especially you know this next presidential
[03:28:33.120 --> 03:28:36.720]  candidate coming in is going to have to be dealing with
[03:28:36.720 --> 03:28:41.040]  massive unemployment as well as the fact that a lot of jobs are moving to
[03:28:41.040 --> 03:28:44.400]  automation and so we have all of these people
[03:28:44.400 --> 03:28:47.760]  spending years in school getting themselves
[03:28:47.760 --> 03:28:51.600]  prepared or unprepared for the coming
[03:28:51.600 --> 03:28:55.280]  workforce and then there's not going to be any jobs for them when they get out
[03:28:55.280 --> 03:28:59.200]  a lot of these jobs are going to be automated anything that you've got
[03:28:59.200 --> 03:29:03.360]  basically pushing buttons well say goodbye to
[03:29:03.360 --> 03:29:07.120]  to that job as well we're going to be talking about that a little bit
[03:29:07.120 --> 03:29:12.320]  coming up in the next segment just what are these jobs that robots are going to
[03:29:12.320 --> 03:29:17.120]  be stealing and how can you as a human prepare yourself
[03:29:17.120 --> 03:29:21.120]  what are the type of qualities that that aren't going to be automated
[03:29:21.120 --> 03:29:24.800]  you know those are the things that we really need to be building upon but
[03:29:24.800 --> 03:29:29.120]  our school system the way it's been set up over the last decades at least
[03:29:29.120 --> 03:29:35.360]  is just turning everyone into a society of robots can you push the buttons can
[03:29:35.360 --> 03:29:38.560]  you continue you know the machine and that's
[03:29:38.560 --> 03:29:41.680]  what we need to dismantle we need to get back to our humanity
[03:29:41.680 --> 03:29:48.240]  and our entrepreneurial spirit as americans that's what we need to be doing
[03:29:48.240 --> 03:29:52.080]  we're on the march the empire's on the run
[03:29:52.080 --> 03:29:56.880]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:56.880 --> 03:30:01.280]  last week david knight interviewed the schian family
[03:30:01.280 --> 03:30:06.080]  who described decades of bombings machine gun strafings and even nuclear bomb
[03:30:06.080 --> 03:30:09.680]  testing all done in and around their property well here's the story of alan
[03:30:09.680 --> 03:30:14.560]  vorwaller who died when he was 43 back in 2004 on his obituary his wife listed
[03:30:14.560 --> 03:30:17.760]  his cause of death was repeated and continual exposure to nuclear
[03:30:17.760 --> 03:30:21.680]  chemical and biological warfare agents while he was growing up in tulle utah
[03:30:21.680 --> 03:30:24.640]  as a result of hunting and camping near the dugway proving ground
[03:30:24.640 --> 03:30:29.120]  alan suffered localized tumors in his lungs knees shoulders and hip which
[03:30:29.120 --> 03:30:32.480]  doctors credited to the atomic tests he was living downwind from but then they
[03:30:32.480 --> 03:30:35.440]  found another type of cancer which was common to people exposed to
[03:30:35.440 --> 03:30:38.720]  biologically engineered germs are gene damaging nerve agents
[03:30:38.720 --> 03:30:42.880]  vx nerve gas was also tested at dugway proving ground before his death alan
[03:30:42.880 --> 03:30:46.320]  suffered 105 degree fever which doctors concluded after exhaustive
[03:30:46.320 --> 03:30:49.040]  testing could only have been caused by an exotic virus

[03:34:41.200 --> 03:34:44.960]  a lot of people ask you know how can you do this it it really is
[03:34:44.960 --> 03:34:48.880]  because of listeners like you of course another one of the ways that you guys
[03:34:48.880 --> 03:34:52.320]  have helped support this operation all along is
[03:34:52.320 --> 03:34:56.560]  through purchasing our products one product that i can give my own personal
[03:34:56.560 --> 03:35:02.160]  testimony for is the super female now when super female first came out
[03:35:02.160 --> 03:35:07.280]  i uh i started taking it and it was pretty uh
[03:35:07.280 --> 03:35:11.520]  let's just say it definitely worked but unfortunately i started taking it right
[03:35:11.520 --> 03:35:15.680]  when my boyfriend and i broke up so these were some you know this was some
[03:35:15.680 --> 03:35:19.520]  courage and vitality that i kind of didn't really
[03:35:19.520 --> 03:35:22.960]  want to be having as a single woman if you catch my drift
[03:35:22.960 --> 03:35:28.320]  i will say however it made me very confident i felt very confident uh very
[03:35:28.320 --> 03:35:32.400]  sexy i kind of woke up in the morning saying wow you know i just it was really
[03:35:32.400 --> 03:35:36.160]  nice being able to get out there and turn heads when i would go to the grocery
[03:35:36.160 --> 03:35:39.120]  store and everything so i definitely helped boost my
[03:35:39.120 --> 03:35:42.960]  confidence during a very sad point in my life
[03:35:42.960 --> 03:35:45.920]  but you know i had to kind of stop taking it because it was working a little
[03:35:45.920 --> 03:35:49.520]  too well but now i am back on the super female
[03:35:49.520 --> 03:35:53.680]  vitality i am back out there but another thing you might have
[03:35:53.680 --> 03:35:58.240]  seen an interview that i did with a good friend of mine actress emi robin
[03:35:58.240 --> 03:36:01.760]  she's an actress she's a singer and she's been helping me
[03:36:01.760 --> 03:36:06.240]  get back in shape and she was having some issues
[03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:10.320]  with her gallbladder and so we got her some of the liver shield and she did
[03:36:10.320 --> 03:36:14.720]  the the cleanse the full cleanse had tremendous success with that and she's
[03:36:14.720 --> 03:36:18.480]  a relatively healthy young woman but she was having
[03:36:18.480 --> 03:36:23.360]  golf ball size things coming gallstones i guess coming out of
[03:36:23.360 --> 03:36:27.280]  her gallbladder and after seeing that i was
[03:36:27.280 --> 03:36:31.840]  really inspired to go ahead and say let's do this challenge together
[03:36:31.840 --> 03:36:35.600]  so she and i are going to be doing the deep cleanse this time
[03:36:35.600 --> 03:36:39.520]  she is now working on a movie so she won't be able to do this deep cleanse
[03:36:39.520 --> 03:36:42.560]  with me until october but we're going to be doing it
[03:36:42.560 --> 03:36:47.040]  together we're going to be uploading some video tutorials

[03:37:42.480 --> 03:37:48.000]  obviously clinton insider he has some bombshell information that he wanted to
[03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:53.360]  share only with us and here is a little teaser of what you're going to see
[03:37:53.360 --> 03:38:09.520]  on the money bomb coming up this this wednesday the 16th
[03:38:09.520 --> 03:38:14.560]  i was there at the beginning inside the clinton machine
[03:38:14.560 --> 03:38:21.040]  i saw it all happen from the corrupt to the absolutely corrupt and that's when
[03:38:21.040 --> 03:38:26.480]  i thought about my father who was dying of lung cancer
[03:38:26.480 --> 03:38:30.480]  and what he would do if he knew the man i'd become
[03:38:30.480 --> 03:38:35.760]  and then i thought about my daughter what if the cocaine they were bringing in
[03:38:35.760 --> 03:38:41.520]  was to end up getting news about her and he'd find these that day
[03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:46.000]  and ask god to forgive me i wasn't a good person
[03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:50.080]  i worked in special operations central america south america
[03:38:50.080 --> 03:38:55.040]  i did a lot of bad things but i hit the bottom that day
[03:38:55.040 --> 03:39:00.720]  and said i was going to make up for it and now i just want to see these criminals
[03:39:00.720 --> 03:39:05.680]  brought to justice and get their just do not make
[03:39:05.680 --> 03:39:17.760]  precedent but put where they belong in jail
[03:39:17.760 --> 03:39:23.840]  one thing about hillary there was just a good timing guy
[03:39:23.840 --> 03:39:32.160]  with hillary she's an animal hillary is the one that i promise you
[03:39:32.160 --> 03:39:37.920]  she pulls the strings she pulled him in arkansas she pulled him in the white
[03:39:37.920 --> 03:39:42.080]  house when she was there as the first lady
[03:39:42.080 --> 03:39:48.800]  am i god if she gets to be president what you see out here now is going to
[03:39:48.800 --> 03:39:51.680]  change we thought it changed with obama there's
[03:39:51.680 --> 03:39:56.000]  nothing compared to what's going to happen with hillary
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:40:07.200]  and i tell you right now i will stop hillary
[03:40:07.200 --> 03:40:10.880]  we've gone further than anybody we know and
[03:40:10.880 --> 03:40:14.560]  that's all we're going to do and people can ask us a hundred different ways
[03:40:14.560 --> 03:40:18.000]  you know from a hundred different directions and we're just going to
[03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:23.120]  leave the ultimate decision up to the american people
[03:40:23.120 --> 03:40:29.280]  i really um just want everybody to take a deep breath and relax and just
[03:40:29.280 --> 03:40:33.600]  you know sit back because here they come again we're going to have to
[03:40:33.600 --> 03:40:37.280]  just ride through this as we have so many of these other
[03:40:37.280 --> 03:40:42.080]  false accusations all right and that was just a preview
[03:40:42.080 --> 03:40:45.200]  of an interview that we're going to be airing in full on the money bomb you
[03:40:45.200 --> 03:40:48.560]  can actually rewatch that at the alex jones channel
[03:40:48.560 --> 03:40:52.800]  it's called clinton insider tells all the preview
[03:40:52.800 --> 03:40:56.480]  now this is a huge leap of faith we're taking and we need your support
[03:40:56.480 --> 03:41:01.440]  so be sure to show us the love during the money bomb it's coming up
[03:41:01.440 --> 03:41:05.440]  wednesday the 16th 27 hours we're all going to be here
[03:41:05.440 --> 03:41:08.800]  i think they're setting up some air mattresses in the back so no one
[03:41:08.800 --> 03:41:12.880]  you know no one tanks out we're we're going live 27 hours so really looking
[03:41:12.880 --> 03:41:14.800]  forward to that it's my first money bomb i'm
[03:41:14.800 --> 03:41:18.640]  i'm pretty excited about it now let's get back into
[03:41:18.640 --> 03:41:22.640]  the topics of discussion i wanted to talk about the irrelevancy
[03:41:22.640 --> 03:41:26.240]  of higher education even in the face of a massive
[03:41:26.240 --> 03:41:30.160]  student loan debt crisis they keep we're hearing rumblings
[03:41:30.160 --> 03:41:34.640]  of a bubble happening that's going to be the next big bubble to burst
[03:41:34.640 --> 03:41:38.960]  our economy is a wreck but let's just talk about what a joke it is this higher
[03:41:38.960 --> 03:41:42.320]  education that they're selling to everyone as a necessity
[03:41:42.320 --> 03:41:45.840]  basically i feel like they're just kind of funneling everyone into schools to
[03:41:45.840 --> 03:41:48.320]  keep them busy while trying to figure out what they're
[03:41:48.320 --> 03:41:51.440]  actually going to be doing with the economy and all the jobs
[03:41:51.440 --> 03:41:56.400]  now this first article is is out of vox and this is from
[03:41:56.400 --> 03:42:01.840]  a tenured professor oliver lee and it's he says i have one of the best jobs in
[03:42:01.840 --> 03:42:06.480]  academia here's why i'm walking away and he was one of the lucky ones he was
[03:42:06.480 --> 03:42:10.480]  able to get a tenured job right out of university
[03:42:10.480 --> 03:42:14.720]  but now he says he's walking away from it and no it's not because of all the
[03:42:14.720 --> 03:42:18.640]  libtarded students that he has to deal with he's entitled
[03:42:18.640 --> 03:42:22.800]  oversensitive students it's not that he's an out-of-touch professor
[03:42:22.800 --> 03:42:26.080]  he says the university system is the problem
[03:42:26.080 --> 03:42:29.920]  the federally backed approach to subsidizing higher education through
[03:42:29.920 --> 03:42:34.800]  low-interest loans has created perverse incentives with disastrous
[03:42:34.800 --> 03:42:38.240]  consequences and this is the system that must be
[03:42:38.240 --> 03:42:43.760]  reformed so obviously here he's basically making the argument that if you
[03:42:43.760 --> 03:42:47.920]  if you make it harder for students to take out these loans
[03:42:47.920 --> 03:42:51.520]  then you're going to force underperforming private and public universities
[03:42:51.520 --> 03:42:54.400]  out of business and for-profit universities
[03:42:54.400 --> 03:42:57.920]  universities he's saying this should be barred all together from getting these
[03:42:57.920 --> 03:43:01.440]  federal loans because this way you can only
[03:43:01.440 --> 03:43:05.520]  charge consumers what they would really be willing to pay
[03:43:05.520 --> 03:43:09.440]  for getting questionable services a lot of people aren't even
[03:43:09.440 --> 03:43:13.760]  making ten thousand dollars a year after they graduate some of these schools
[03:43:13.760 --> 03:43:18.640]  and if you if you shrink the easy access to these student loans
[03:43:18.640 --> 03:43:23.200]  universities would be forced to compete on a cost per student basis
[03:43:23.200 --> 03:43:26.320]  those students that still could afford to pay to attend college
[03:43:26.320 --> 03:43:30.480]  would likely focus their studies on subjects with an immediate return on
[03:43:30.480 --> 03:43:34.320]  investment now basically the argument is that the
[03:43:34.320 --> 03:43:37.520]  the academy is no longer an investment of time
[03:43:37.520 --> 03:43:42.080]  worth making we all are allotted a very short amount of time
[03:43:42.080 --> 03:43:46.720]  to us in this life why are we wasting it in higher education
[03:43:46.720 --> 03:43:52.160]  when you're seeing now this college scorecard that's just been released
[03:43:52.160 --> 03:43:56.800]  by the government and it's it's so bleak it's it's basically
[03:43:56.800 --> 03:44:00.240]  just showing you that there's people are going to
[03:44:00.240 --> 03:44:06.720]  into massive debt and more than half of hundreds of schools people that they
[03:44:06.720 --> 03:44:09.760]  have checked in about 10 years later after they
[03:44:09.760 --> 03:44:13.440]  graduated more than half of these people are making
[03:44:13.440 --> 03:44:18.320]  less than high school graduates so not only are they
[03:44:18.320 --> 03:44:22.400]  saddled with all of this debt but the schools kind of duped them into thinking
[03:44:22.400 --> 03:44:26.480]  that they it was an absolute necessity and then they're you know earning
[03:44:26.480 --> 03:44:30.560]  less than high school graduates now this is the college scorecard
[03:44:30.560 --> 03:44:34.080]  it it's basically a data dump by the u.s government
[03:44:34.080 --> 03:44:38.560]  so that parents can look and see if they're going to be sending their
[03:44:38.560 --> 03:44:42.560]  their child to a school you know what is going to be the return on investment
[03:44:42.560 --> 03:44:46.320]  with that and it's not really very clear like i said at the data dump
[03:44:46.320 --> 03:44:49.520]  so they're kind of putting the onus on you the parent
[03:44:49.520 --> 03:44:55.120]  to be able to sift through a lot of these a lot of this information here
[03:44:55.120 --> 03:44:59.040]  but basically how much money are students borrowing
[03:44:59.040 --> 03:45:03.520]  and then what is that exchange in earnings after graduation
[03:45:03.520 --> 03:45:09.200]  and of course they were trying for years to get this information out there
[03:45:09.200 --> 03:45:13.600]  but there was relentless opposition from colleges and universities
[03:45:13.600 --> 03:45:18.480]  and of course why because now that this information is out there people can see
[03:45:18.480 --> 03:45:23.280]  that it's um it's a racket and a lot of the issue is is that what
[03:45:23.280 --> 03:45:27.040]  these colleges because they're being pumped with all this federal money
[03:45:27.040 --> 03:45:30.480]  that's all that's important to them is this front end enrollment
[03:45:30.480 --> 03:45:34.160]  as long as they can get you signed up to take out the loans
[03:45:34.160 --> 03:45:38.480]  they're good they don't worry about the dropout rate they don't worry about
[03:45:38.480 --> 03:45:42.560]  if you are able to get a job afterward or if you're going to be making low wages
[03:45:42.560 --> 03:45:46.560]  and and what the what the rate of you paying your student loan
[03:45:46.560 --> 03:45:49.680]  debt is they're not worried about that they're not concerned about that
[03:45:49.680 --> 03:45:53.120]  and that's the big issue with the way that they're getting these
[03:45:53.120 --> 03:45:56.720]  taxpayer this federal funding is that there is no accountability
[03:45:56.720 --> 03:46:00.080]  and that they're not having to show that it's worth it they're they're just this
[03:46:00.080 --> 03:46:04.960]  front end enrollment of pumping that free money into these universities
[03:46:04.960 --> 03:46:12.720]  and um so we are going to answer one more phone call
[03:46:12.720 --> 03:46:16.240]  here um
[03:46:16.240 --> 03:46:20.480]  mic from washington's been holding for quite a while uh i wanted to hear what
[03:46:20.480 --> 03:46:23.920]  mic from washington has to say about this
[03:46:23.920 --> 03:46:28.240]  yeah yes well actually washington state hi there
[03:46:28.240 --> 03:46:32.400]  go ahead oh hi how you doing yeah i'm from i'm from washington state a lot
[03:46:32.400 --> 03:46:36.240]  of people you tell me from washington they automatically go to dc
[03:46:36.240 --> 03:46:39.520]  you know i'm actually from the state of washington
[03:46:39.520 --> 03:46:43.120]  um i noticed you've been talking a lot about the debate
[03:46:43.120 --> 03:46:46.880]  and i think a lot of the americans feel that um it's just kind of hopeless to
[03:46:46.880 --> 03:46:50.560]  even vote we're controlled on so many levels
[03:46:50.560 --> 03:46:55.920]  we're controlled um you know even down to the the flooring in the water or the
[03:46:55.920 --> 03:47:00.480]  the pharmaceuticals that the that the doctors are pushing or the gmo foods i
[03:47:00.480 --> 03:47:05.120]  mean i would love to see the list of how many
[03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:08.800]  different tools and things we are are controlled by
[03:47:08.800 --> 03:47:12.800]  um you know i feel like we're influencing things in the middle east or
[03:47:12.800 --> 03:47:17.040]  the old ottoman empire right now that has nothing to do with what
[03:47:17.040 --> 03:47:22.480]  uh our intentions are or what what we need to focus on i mean i agree with
[03:47:22.480 --> 03:47:26.160]  everything who went to hell in america no that's you're
[03:47:26.160 --> 03:47:29.040]  absolutely right mic i mean there's so much that we
[03:47:29.040 --> 03:47:33.040]  should really be concerning ourselves with we're actually seeing the forging
[03:47:33.040 --> 03:47:38.240]  of world war three happening right now russia has
[03:47:38.240 --> 03:47:42.080]  positioned themselves there in syria we're getting all of these
[03:47:42.080 --> 03:47:46.400]  reports of 95 000 russian troops all these war games are going on
[03:47:46.400 --> 03:47:49.600]  and and there is an assault on us here
[03:47:49.600 --> 03:47:54.000]  presently in our own country and yet we're having to be concerned about
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:47:59.280]  what's racist or sexist and it's just all a huge distraction
[03:47:59.280 --> 03:48:02.880]  um i wanted to quickly throw to a report from john baume where he gets into
[03:48:02.880 --> 03:48:07.760]  this forging of world war three and what's really going on so guys is that
[03:48:07.760 --> 03:48:17.360]  report ready go for it
[03:48:17.360 --> 03:48:22.000]  according to reuters russia has demanded washington restart military to
[03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:26.240]  military cooperation to avert unintended incidents near syria
[03:48:26.240 --> 03:48:30.400]  at a time when us officials say moscow is building up forces
[03:48:30.400 --> 03:48:33.760]  to protect president bashar al-asad's government
[03:48:33.760 --> 03:48:38.400]  of course asad is backed by russia and openly blamed by the united states for
[03:48:38.400 --> 03:48:41.680]  attacks on his own people attacks that just don't add up
[03:48:41.680 --> 03:48:46.160]  this is a big issue that we're facing here and
[03:48:46.160 --> 03:48:49.520]  americans have seen the lies of wmds in iraq
[03:48:49.520 --> 03:48:53.440]  they've seen the lies that brought us to vietnam with the gulf of tonkin
[03:48:53.440 --> 03:48:57.120]  we've seen so many of these staged events so many of these false flags now
[03:48:57.120 --> 03:49:00.320]  i want to be clear as well i believe that there was some type of chemical
[03:49:00.320 --> 03:49:04.000]  attack the numbers aren't clear the media has tried to claim already alex
[03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:07.120]  jones says nothing happened no something happened in the middle of a
[03:49:07.120 --> 03:49:13.520]  battle zone in the capital city uh demascus of syria
[03:49:13.520 --> 03:49:18.400]  and now asad's come out and said today why would i attack
[03:49:18.400 --> 03:49:22.560]  a bunch of civilians knowing that the west has said that that's their red
[03:49:22.560 --> 03:49:26.720]  line a year ago to the day that they would come and bombard us and back up
[03:49:26.720 --> 03:49:29.360]  the rebels do i want to get arrested and killed
[03:49:29.360 --> 03:49:33.280]  do i want to be thrown out of power do i want to see every church
[03:49:33.280 --> 03:49:36.880]  in syria burned to the ground because the al-qaeda groups obama is supporting
[03:49:36.880 --> 03:49:39.840]  have said that and i talked to a lot of special forces people
[03:49:39.840 --> 03:49:43.600]  on and off air including today and they said yeah
[03:49:43.600 --> 03:49:48.000]  none of this makes any sense and the west is on record funding the
[03:49:48.000 --> 03:49:52.720]  rebels with even heavy weapons like tanks heat seeking missiles you name it
[03:49:52.720 --> 03:49:56.880]  so this is really incredible vbc news admits they put out
[03:49:56.880 --> 03:50:04.000]  a fake photo from a real massacre saddam had been involved in
[03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:09.200]  from 2003 but but they they lied and said these were the thousands dead
[03:50:09.200 --> 03:50:13.040]  from the side when it looks like max it was a hundred the obama administration
[03:50:13.040 --> 03:50:17.040]  claims to be fighting ices while plenty of evidence shows the obama
[03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:22.240]  administration has long supported ices now the hornet's nest is stirring in
[03:50:22.240 --> 03:50:25.680]  obama's inner circle the guardian reports barack obama's
[03:50:25.680 --> 03:50:28.960]  intelligence chief james clapper is said to be in frequent
[03:50:28.960 --> 03:50:32.800]  and unusual contact with the military intelligence officer
[03:50:32.800 --> 03:50:37.120]  at the center of a growing scandal over rosy portrayals of the war against the
[03:50:37.120 --> 03:50:40.240]  islamic state james clapper the director of national
[03:50:40.240 --> 03:50:44.880]  intelligence is said to talk nearly every day with the head of us central
[03:50:44.880 --> 03:50:48.160]  commands intelligence wing army brigadier general
[03:50:48.160 --> 03:50:52.640]  steven grove which is highly unusual all right well that you can see the rest
[03:50:52.640 --> 03:50:55.360]  of that report at the alec shone's youtube channel
[03:50:55.360 --> 03:50:59.120]  it's the forging of world war three

[03:54:06.080 --> 03:54:10.480]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm your host lienne macadoo hosting the
[03:54:10.480 --> 03:54:14.480]  overdrive fourth hour very exciting to be here
[03:54:14.480 --> 03:54:17.680]  now i wanted to talk a little bit more about
[03:54:17.680 --> 03:54:23.440]  this irrelevancy of higher education and to show you just what a racket it is
[03:54:23.440 --> 03:54:26.240]  now this is a report coming out of think progress
[03:54:26.240 --> 03:54:29.680]  how the government could make public college free
[03:54:29.680 --> 03:54:32.720]  for all students we know that they do this in other countries
[03:54:32.720 --> 03:54:38.480]  but not here in our civilized us of a now they say tuition at public colleges
[03:54:38.480 --> 03:54:45.680]  came to 62.6 billion in 2012 and that's less than what the government spends to
[03:54:45.680 --> 03:54:49.360]  subsidize the cost of college so they're subsidizing the cost of
[03:54:49.360 --> 03:54:52.960]  college via grants tax breaks and work study funds
[03:54:52.960 --> 03:54:57.680]  they spent 69 billion dollars subsidizing so
[03:54:57.680 --> 03:55:01.440]  they could just basically use that money to
[03:55:01.440 --> 03:55:06.160]  make college free for all students and in addition to that
[03:55:06.160 --> 03:55:12.720]  the united states government spent another 107.4 billion on student loans
[03:55:12.720 --> 03:55:16.640]  so they spent spent more money helping people
[03:55:16.640 --> 03:55:20.400]  take out loans than they did they could just make college free i mean that's
[03:55:20.400 --> 03:55:24.480]  more um more than twice i guess they could
[03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:28.080]  pay twice around and people wouldn't have to worry about
[03:55:28.080 --> 03:55:31.120]  going to school we would have a lot of people getting higher education they
[03:55:31.120 --> 03:55:34.640]  wouldn't have to worry about the cost it could also incentivize private
[03:55:34.640 --> 03:55:40.720]  colleges to reduce their costs in order to compete with the free option
[03:55:40.720 --> 03:55:45.280]  so that's what a racket this is and the fact that there is a student loan
[03:55:45.280 --> 03:55:48.640]  crisis that we're all going to have to be dealing with here in the coming
[03:55:48.640 --> 03:55:52.800]  years it's ridiculous this could be wiped away and of course
[03:55:52.800 --> 03:55:56.240]  student loans are one of those things that are almost impossible
[03:55:56.240 --> 03:55:59.840]  to get rid of with the bankruptcy discharge possibly that could be something
[03:55:59.840 --> 03:56:05.280]  that could be changed in the future as well now in the last few minutes here
[03:56:05.280 --> 03:56:09.680]  we can talk a little bit about the coming automation of jobs
[03:56:09.680 --> 03:56:14.000]  and we've talked about this a lot here at info wars i've covered it a lot on the
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:16.720]  info wars nightly news but there are just
[03:56:16.720 --> 03:56:21.440]  certain jobs that are going to that are going to be replaced
[03:56:21.440 --> 03:56:28.080]  such as chefs salespeople and even models if you can believe that
[03:56:28.080 --> 03:56:33.520]  about 35 of jobs they say are likely to be taken on by robots in the next 20
[03:56:33.520 --> 03:56:36.160]  years now when i spoke with some experts at an
[03:56:36.160 --> 03:56:39.520]  artificial intelligence conference they kind of scoffed at that
[03:56:39.520 --> 03:56:42.880]  and said that it's going to be a lot sooner than that
[03:56:42.880 --> 03:56:47.040]  but the researchers were also kind of calculating some advantages that humans
[03:56:47.040 --> 03:56:50.480]  have over machines and so these are the certain traits
[03:56:50.480 --> 03:56:56.000]  that we want to be really investing in and these going back once again to that
[03:56:56.000 --> 03:57:00.080]  humanity these traits include creative endeavors like writing
[03:57:00.080 --> 03:57:04.400]  entrepreneurship and scientific discovery again going
[03:57:04.400 --> 03:57:07.680]  back to that spark of divinity i mean we are all given
[03:57:07.680 --> 03:57:10.880]  a spark of divinity when we are born we are god
[03:57:10.880 --> 03:57:14.720]  experiencing himself here on this planet or herself
[03:57:14.720 --> 03:57:18.320]  you know god's divinity every one of us has that little spark
[03:57:18.320 --> 03:57:22.880]  and no one can do what i can do or what you can do
[03:57:22.880 --> 03:57:26.320]  so i think that this is kind of letting us know it's time for us to
[03:57:26.320 --> 03:57:30.640]  find out what is our passion what is our calling what is god calling us to
[03:57:30.640 --> 03:57:34.880]  to all do to put forth into this world the world is missing
[03:57:34.880 --> 03:57:39.280]  what it is that you have to offer because you're so busy being a robot pushing
[03:57:39.280 --> 03:57:43.680]  buttons for the machine for your employer to to keep this
[03:57:43.680 --> 03:57:48.640]  huge bureaucracy going and they don't want you to wake up to that divinity
[03:57:48.640 --> 03:57:52.160]  they want us all to stay sort of in this trance
[03:57:52.160 --> 03:57:56.880]  stay programmed to forget that we are sparks of the divine
[03:57:56.880 --> 03:58:02.000]  so i'm leon macadoo hosting this info wars overdrive hour tune in to the info
[03:58:02.000 --> 03:58:06.080]  wars nightly news tonight with jacari jackson
[03:58:06.080 --> 03:58:35.920]  we're going to be talking about all of this and more and i will catch you there
