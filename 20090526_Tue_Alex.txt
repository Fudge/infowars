[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:31.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.760 --> 00:36.800]  well ladies and gentlemen we have got a big very informative radio broadcast
[00:36.800 --> 00:42.520]  minded for you today Daniel Estalon will be joining us coming up in 30 minutes
[00:42.520 --> 00:48.880]  from his home outside Madrid Spain and so that should be quite informative and
[00:48.880 --> 00:53.720]  interesting how day a long 30-minute conversation with him yesterday morning
[00:53.720 --> 01:00.400]  caught up on a lot of things that have been going on he's been very very busy in
[01:00.400 --> 01:03.520]  the two years since we last interviewed him here when he came on talking about
[01:03.520 --> 01:08.880]  the assassination plot against Congressman Ron Paul that is still the
[01:08.880 --> 01:12.280]  only thing linked on the main page of his website so he's been so busy I hadn't
[01:12.280 --> 01:16.480]  even updated that but he's got a lot coming up been in Africa seen a lot of
[01:16.480 --> 01:20.120]  harrowing things there and got a new book coming out so we'll be talking to
[01:20.120 --> 01:25.680]  him oh also he told me two years ago too much to tell anybody so I didn't and and
[01:25.680 --> 01:30.440]  I believed him because the guys are always incredible though anybody else
[01:30.440 --> 01:34.520]  would told me I would have kind of been taken back that yeah the Halcyon group
[01:34.520 --> 01:39.240]  that bought the Terminator series and Philip K. Dick series and all of this
[01:39.240 --> 01:46.400]  they they have bought my book and are gonna make it to a big movie a big
[01:46.400 --> 01:51.920]  thriller and I just so happen to know somebody who'd made a couple Philip K.
[01:51.920 --> 01:55.600]  Dick movies and worked with the estate and I called up and they said yeah that's
[01:55.600 --> 02:00.480]  that's true separately about the Halcyon group and the Philip K. Dick
[02:00.480 --> 02:07.960]  optioning basically all the works for three years and so then I talked to
[02:07.960 --> 02:12.400]  Daniel again yesterday and he said no it's true they're gonna have a press
[02:12.400 --> 02:17.240]  conference in Madrid Spain coming up on Friday with that and then I googled it
[02:17.240 --> 02:21.640]  and saw that it was already in some of the publications some of the Hollywood
[02:21.640 --> 02:25.360]  publications like Variety so that's a very very exciting congratulations to him
[02:25.360 --> 02:29.440]  and you know this classic story of what happens over and over again and I'll
[02:29.440 --> 02:35.400]  talk about later before he comes on took place I just ignore everybody calling
[02:35.400 --> 02:39.200]  me 24-7 trying to start up fights with myself and others I just learned to
[02:39.200 --> 02:44.600]  ignore it but then what people do to stir fights up between me and other people
[02:44.600 --> 02:50.560]  is they go on theprisonplanet.com forum and they post things supposedly I've
[02:50.560 --> 02:54.760]  said and then use that as a source or they post other people's stuff and then
[02:54.760 --> 02:58.880]  other people usually even the same people call up others and say are you
[02:58.880 --> 03:03.120]  seeing what Alex Jones is saying about you and so I guess about a week ago some
[03:03.120 --> 03:07.400]  French news site posted and said Daniel Estlum was at Bilderberg meeting which is
[03:07.400 --> 03:10.640]  just ridiculous and they've had him arrested other things like they've
[03:10.640 --> 03:14.840]  had me arrested and that and then somebody posted that on the
[03:14.840 --> 03:18.880]  prison planet forum and people gave that to Daniel and then they had to put out a
[03:18.880 --> 03:21.080]  press release saying it wasn't true because every time he does media
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.400]  interviews he's asked about it and then he was asked about it I guess off air
[03:25.400 --> 03:28.520]  and then on air made the point on Iranian television press TV that the
[03:28.520 --> 03:31.800]  crazies over at prison planet he meant obviously I talked to that's what he
[03:31.800 --> 03:36.480]  meant the message board and what people were doing over there so that's the type
[03:36.480 --> 03:41.040]  of dirty tricks I go through every single day I have people faxing folks
[03:41.040 --> 03:45.000]  reprogramming fax machines with our business phone numbers death-threading
[03:45.000 --> 03:52.440]  people that is routine we have people programming their IP phones to say there
[03:52.440 --> 03:58.040]  are business line and calling people I guess IP spoofing we have people just
[03:58.040 --> 04:02.480]  engaging in every form was a bunch of other stuff in fact I shouldn't even
[04:02.480 --> 04:06.640]  list it all because it only encourages others to do it they have a lot of dirty
[04:06.640 --> 04:11.120]  tricks they use I mean they'll send out 10 million emails with my website
[04:11.120 --> 04:17.000]  cussing at people and then you know to try to make folks file complaints about
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.160]  it being our email but the good news is we're such a big website now in full
[04:22.160 --> 04:25.800]  words dot com prison planet dot com that people most people have learned all
[04:25.800 --> 04:29.120]  these tricks and we didn't really cause us that big of a problem anymore but we
[04:29.120 --> 04:33.680]  are seeing the attacks intensify with hack attacks and demonization cabinet
[04:33.680 --> 04:37.560]  pain speaking of that where we've been attacked by Bloomberg we've been attacked
[04:37.560 --> 04:42.040]  by the New York Times again we've been attacked by the LA Times though that's
[04:42.040 --> 04:45.480]  somewhat fair compared to the other hit pieces it still is one we're just being
[04:45.480 --> 04:50.400]  attacked everywhere this weekend so we have definitely arrived in a big way
[04:50.400 --> 04:55.080]  and are just entering into the vortex here so anyways Daniel lesson coming up
[04:55.080 --> 05:01.160]  very excited about that and then we've got Kevin Trudeau yes hello friends this

[08:37.400 --> 08:44.640]  May 2009 will be live here for the next three hours and 52 minutes daniel
[08:44.640 --> 08:50.760]  estlund scheduled to join us coming up at the bottom of the hour about 22
[08:50.760 --> 08:57.200]  minutes and then we have got Judith McGeary farm and ranch freedom alliance
[08:57.200 --> 09:00.920]  the feds are going around openly and I even heard brownfield talking about it
[09:00.920 --> 09:05.720]  this morning openly bribing all the major farm and ranch groups I mean with
[09:05.720 --> 09:10.120]  millions of dollars even local chapters to then threaten their members and
[09:10.120 --> 09:15.280]  tell them it's the law to accept animal chipping and premises ID when you do the
[09:15.280 --> 09:20.440]  premises ID basically wave your rights sign on to corporate fraud it is not
[09:20.440 --> 09:29.600]  the law it is not the law it's all color of law so that is coming up in the
[09:29.600 --> 09:33.440]  middle of the next hour today then Kevin Trudeau you know him of
[09:33.440 --> 09:40.360]  infomercial fame and best-selling author fame the reason I've got him coming on
[09:40.360 --> 09:50.360]  is because I was on man cow Muller show about a month ago and man cow said you
[09:50.360 --> 09:54.200]  know I had dinner with Kevin Trudeau he's a fan of yours and here's his phone
[09:54.200 --> 09:59.360]  number I was like yeah Kevin Trudeau is a fan of Alex Jones and then I kind of
[09:59.360 --> 10:02.840]  wrote the number down at my house doing a radio interview over the telephone and
[10:02.840 --> 10:09.480]  lost it and then somehow we got contacted by Trudeau's office talk to him
[10:09.480 --> 10:13.040]  he's in Germany right now on tour this morning and he's like oh yeah I'm a
[10:13.040 --> 10:18.960]  prison planet dot TV subscriber watch all your films huge fan for years and I
[10:18.960 --> 10:22.840]  had guessed that he was into the New World Order wasn't hard to guess because
[10:22.840 --> 10:26.800]  he'd sent some newsletters out I'd gotten copies of and talking about a one
[10:26.800 --> 10:31.120]  world government New World Order the last few years and he's a guy with a lot
[10:31.120 --> 10:34.040]  of influence that's why the media and the feds have tried to come after him
[10:34.040 --> 10:38.280]  how dare himself books with supposed herbal remedies you know things that are
[10:38.280 --> 10:43.440]  well-documented like garlic's good for your heart goodness gracious and you
[10:43.440 --> 10:49.360]  know aloe vera is good for burns oh my so radical but it's just really exciting
[10:49.360 --> 10:53.880]  to learn that Kevin Trudeau is a big supporter of the show he'll be on with
[10:53.880 --> 10:57.840]  us coming up in fact I appreciate him letting us bumping and a leslin's been
[10:57.840 --> 11:03.640]  so hard to get on the radio he's been so busy writing his new book that he'll
[11:03.640 --> 11:06.760]  tell you about coming up that that's why I've been doing a lot of media but he's
[11:06.760 --> 11:11.880]  about to start more because the book is basically done and so he actually moved
[11:11.880 --> 11:15.480]  out the countryside he said to finish it now he's moved back into the city it's
[11:15.480 --> 11:18.640]  why he'll be joining us by cell phone today's way out in the countryside in
[11:18.640 --> 11:25.440]  Spain what do I envy him I'd love to live in the country I tell you it's just I
[11:25.440 --> 11:29.000]  mean cities are fine but I love the countryside nothing like here in crickets
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.600]  and frogs and it's the relaxation of it anyways I'm digressing so he is coming
[11:34.600 --> 11:38.720]  up and then Kevin Trudeau from Deutschland will be joining us on the
[11:38.720 --> 11:45.160]  show today and we'll have open phones as well you know I talk about things that
[11:45.160 --> 11:50.840]  click pieces of news pieces of information pieces of intel that just
[11:50.840 --> 11:59.200]  confirmed thousands of other things that we've been working on over the years
[11:59.200 --> 12:04.080]  and large pieces of the puzzle we already had I mean forget connecting the
[12:04.080 --> 12:08.720]  dots routinely now I'll see a news story or an article or a bill or a government
[12:08.720 --> 12:13.560]  document or or I'll watch a globalist conference on C-SPAN or Davos Switzerland
[12:13.560 --> 12:18.880]  online or I'll watch sit up for hours watching hours and hours of European
[12:18.880 --> 12:23.280]  Union parliament meetings where they're openly announcing the architecture of
[12:23.280 --> 12:27.240]  world government and how it's going to work and it doesn't just connect the
[12:27.240 --> 12:32.960]  final dots it makes it a crystal clear three-dimensional hologram image or map
[12:32.960 --> 12:42.720]  or blueprint of what we're dealing with and I just got slammed slammed into my
[12:42.720 --> 12:58.080]  chair I got blasted into my chair this weekend when I saw a London Guardian
[12:58.080 --> 13:02.320]  report I also saw a report out of the Times of London that was the most
[13:02.320 --> 13:08.440]  important one dealing with a meeting that Paul Watson had reported on last week
[13:08.440 --> 13:13.920]  and Watson said this was probably a eugenics meeting and then gave listings
[13:13.920 --> 13:19.000]  of past meetings similar meetings that have been held where eugenics is the
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.760]  topic and the ABC News headline was you know world leaders meet in secret but
[13:25.760 --> 13:28.720]  it's not for world government they said well they met in secret because they
[13:28.720 --> 13:34.160]  didn't want anybody to think they were an alternate world government the Times
[13:34.160 --> 13:38.520]  of London also says that an alternate world government that's saying we're not
[13:38.520 --> 13:48.160]  the world government because they met days before the Bilderberg group meeting
[13:48.160 --> 13:50.560]  and the David Rockefeller and others that were at this meeting went to
[13:50.560 --> 13:55.880]  Bilderberg and then we found out about it a week and a half later ABC News last
[13:55.880 --> 14:01.080]  Tuesday Paul Watson reported on it then and so it's probably eugenics on Wednesday
[14:01.080 --> 14:07.200]  and that article is there because that's all they meet about that's all these
[14:07.200 --> 14:11.520]  people ever meet about that's all that everything else they discuss at Bilderberg
[14:11.520 --> 14:15.320]  and at the Intercouncils of the Trilateral Commission and CFR everything
[14:15.320 --> 14:20.160]  is discussed at Club of Rome everything is discussed the UN that's all just
[14:20.160 --> 14:27.160]  building the foundation for their ultimate goal in the final equation from
[14:27.160 --> 14:31.120]  the minutes and the documents and the witnesses and the moles that we have and
[14:31.120 --> 14:37.240]  then the published reports by all these groups is that they want world
[14:37.240 --> 14:41.880]  government so they can carry out the orderly extermination of conservatively
[14:41.880 --> 14:45.640]  80 percent that's in the UN and Club of Rome documents going back to the 60s
[14:45.640 --> 14:50.200]  that is now the minority group and most of the groups published they want to
[14:50.200 --> 14:55.480]  kill 95 percent and now that's becoming kind of past say and the more radical
[14:55.480 --> 15:01.600]  group says 99.9 percent and then an even more radical minority is forming but
[15:01.600 --> 15:09.000]  becoming a majority that says kill all humans and Dr. Pianca is graduate
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.960]  students at UT of defendant and we published you know link to their
[15:11.960 --> 15:16.240]  published papers where they say kill all humans we must build world government
[15:16.240 --> 15:24.680]  to kill everyone I mean these people are total and complete creatures from
[15:24.680 --> 15:33.880]  another dimension I mean they are right out of hellraiser final fantasy event
[15:33.880 --> 15:40.440]  horizon I mean how else would you describe them and really all they're
[15:40.440 --> 15:44.480]  doing is relaying the inner sanctum's directives see if you were the ultimate
[15:44.480 --> 15:51.760]  control freak the singularity of control freakness you would want to kill
[15:51.760 --> 15:55.800]  everyone and then including yourself because in many of these dark
[15:55.800 --> 16:01.640]  philosophers we quote some of them in in game they say suicidal now nihilism is
[16:01.640 --> 16:05.960]  the way to go because they want to your control freak you then want to kill
[16:05.960 --> 16:15.200]  yourself if you can't find life extension technologies if you can't take
[16:15.200 --> 16:20.040]  control of that and that's what they say in their own philosophy then you will
[16:20.040 --> 16:25.640]  kill yourself simultaneously by destroying the planet now I know this
[16:25.640 --> 16:31.800]  sounds totally nuts it is insane but crazy like a fox these people are the
[16:31.800 --> 16:36.280]  penultimate penultimate I mean secondary that's why I say penultimate
[16:36.280 --> 16:42.560]  next to the LZ Bob if that's how you want to put it they are as evil as it
[16:42.560 --> 16:53.120]  gets they are paramount they are numero uno they are just absolutely out of
[16:53.120 --> 17:00.760]  control and if I spent hours this weekend reading oh probably 15 different
[17:00.760 --> 17:05.640]  mainstream news articles from Russia in England the United States Canada about
[17:05.640 --> 17:10.680]  this meeting and about this group and every one of the reports is an interview
[17:10.680 --> 17:16.840]  with an unnamed source within the group it's one of the secretaries for the
[17:16.840 --> 17:20.880]  group probably the head of the Rockefeller University that's who they
[17:20.880 --> 17:25.800]  say ran the meeting yeah these people secretaries are incredibly powerful and
[17:25.800 --> 17:29.120]  you know it says we talked to one of the functionaries of the group and they
[17:29.120 --> 17:34.200]  said oh it's called the good group the good group and they want to reduce the
[17:34.200 --> 17:38.480]  world population and it's you know all lovey-dovey and sweet and they want to
[17:38.480 --> 17:42.600]  help everybody out so later after Esteline leaves us when we start the
[17:42.600 --> 17:47.840]  next hour I am going to detail this as best I can and break it down I know I
[17:47.840 --> 17:52.400]  spent most the two hours Sunday going over it but I listened to the rebroadcast
[17:52.400 --> 17:55.840]  while I was doing research and I just didn't didn't give it justice so I want
[17:55.840 --> 17:59.960]  to try to boil down the basics of who they are what they are what they want to
[17:59.960 --> 18:04.960]  do and then go over this article and and just show it for what it is open
[18:04.960 --> 18:12.520]  evidence that that's all these people are up to is is no good and the sick thing
[18:12.520 --> 18:16.320]  is I get hundreds of emails and comments on the articles Paul Watson wrote at
[18:16.320 --> 18:20.160]  prisonplanet.com a lot of people defending it saying well yeah I don't
[18:20.160 --> 18:24.360]  think we should kill everybody but you gotta admit there's too many people you
[18:24.360 --> 18:28.000]  gotta admit we're overpopulated I mean somebody's got to do this this is the
[18:28.000 --> 18:33.920]  tough tough choice we have to make we'll see once you've decided that that's the
[18:33.920 --> 18:38.040]  truth you've thrown all humanity out the window you've thrown everything our
[18:38.040 --> 18:41.720]  ancestors stood for out the window you've thrown our complete history out the
[18:41.720 --> 18:45.960]  window and you're capitulating to a lie we need to innovate and reach the stars
[18:45.960 --> 18:52.320]  and colonize space but instead remember two years ago the film festival award
[18:52.320 --> 18:57.200]  for the Berlin film festival was a 2007 shows humans destroying the earth and
[18:57.200 --> 19:03.120]  then like cancer virus bacteria you know some type of evil microcosm blasting
[19:03.120 --> 19:05.280]  off in spaceships to infect the universe
[19:05.280 --> 19:12.520]  fact let's find that I know Paul Watson an article about it that's how they see
[19:12.520 --> 19:16.280]  us not an incredible species not a wondrous species not a species that is
[19:16.280 --> 19:22.840]  evil but also good not a species that has amazing potential and we really do
[19:23.400 --> 19:28.120]  this is the biggest lie ever and this is done by an elite that hate themselves
[19:28.120 --> 19:36.960]  and hate humanity and we can go to the next level but the elites don't want to
[19:36.960 --> 19:43.200]  do that because they want to control society and want to mold it in the way
[19:43.200 --> 19:48.480]  they see fit and so this is the big question coming up this is for all the
[19:48.480 --> 19:54.360]  marbles discussed in t-minus 40 minutes five seconds stay with us we'll come

[24:11.560 --> 24:23.320]  I saw seven different reviews in mainstream media and I wasn't even
[24:23.320 --> 24:30.120]  looking this weekend for the film New World Order that premieres tonight on
[24:30.120 --> 24:36.880]  IFC independent film channel you know independent film channel has been good
[24:36.880 --> 24:46.400]  to me they produced Waking Life with Tommy Pilata and Rick Linklater and I've
[24:46.400 --> 24:50.400]  been on a few of their TV shows in the past that were very fair I knew that it
[24:50.400 --> 24:53.880]  was IFC that was looking at funding this original New World Order film two years
[24:53.880 --> 24:59.520]  ago when I was first approached by the production company C-Think and when I
[24:59.520 --> 25:04.320]  say it's the fairest film I've seen towards us it it still focuses in on the
[25:04.320 --> 25:08.080]  hokey and the goofy and distorts you know they keep saying oh we only looked
[25:08.080 --> 25:10.680]  at who these people really are and showed you what they're saying and doing
[25:10.680 --> 25:14.360]  yeah that'd be like if I followed somebody for two years and only put in a
[25:14.360 --> 25:17.960]  film the few times I saw him burp or the few times they forgot you know pick
[25:17.960 --> 25:25.720]  their nose it is a distortion but they do show I'd say 40% stuff on our side
[25:25.720 --> 25:33.640]  60% on the establishment side of cliches and stereotypes and the
[25:33.640 --> 25:37.640]  establishment is still playing an old paradigm they think that this film
[25:37.640 --> 25:43.920]  coming out is gonna make us look goofy and bad but it's gonna backfire on them
[25:43.920 --> 25:47.120]  I've talked to people that have been at screenings I've talked to people that
[25:47.120 --> 25:51.880]  have seen it on demand because IFC put stuff out on demand first and IFC has
[25:51.880 --> 25:57.160]  said that this is the most downloaded TV show off their on demand on record it's
[25:57.160 --> 26:01.960]  dwarfed everything and that shows the interest in this and they've also got a
[26:01.960 --> 26:05.000]  bunch of other TV programs they produced and specials about the alternative
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.080]  media that feature myself and others that are built around this premiere
[26:09.080 --> 26:12.880]  tonight and several of those shows are gonna come on afterwards and I really
[26:12.880 --> 26:16.360]  want to see how fair those are though I don't watch enough TV to even know if I
[26:16.360 --> 26:21.480]  have IFC I don't think I do that before we forget well somebody call my wife
[26:21.480 --> 26:28.600]  ask her to check that and ask her to subscribe to IFC or to a cable package
[26:28.600 --> 26:32.240]  right now so I can watch it tonight or we'll we have satellite here in the
[26:32.240 --> 26:35.800]  office we're out here on the edge of town we can't even get cable over here
[26:35.800 --> 26:39.200]  well I tell you I don't know about you but this satellite stuff does not work
[26:39.200 --> 26:45.000]  too well satellite system and then working about a third of the time side
[26:45.000 --> 26:53.760]  issue I'm digressing the point is is that overall this is a positive thing but I
[26:53.760 --> 26:56.920]  had forgotten that they'd mentioned about two years ago they were going to
[26:56.920 --> 27:00.520]  interview Estaline and then I never thought about it again Estaline says
[27:00.520 --> 27:05.520]  they followed him around for two years and didn't stick him in the film and he
[27:05.520 --> 27:09.680]  says he's glad because he thinks it's a hit piece not tend to agree with him you
[27:09.680 --> 27:13.760]  know at a certain level and that's because Daniel's always so composed it
[27:13.760 --> 27:19.400]  was nothing they could probably you know get off of him that that they could
[27:19.400 --> 27:23.680]  twist or spin but see that's the little game you play with this devilish
[27:23.680 --> 27:28.520]  system you know let's see when the Bilderberg movie comes out as a big you
[27:28.520 --> 27:31.720]  know kind of angels and demons type film put up by the folks putting out
[27:31.720 --> 27:37.040]  Terminator salvation let's see if they don't do some things like that and then
[27:37.040 --> 27:40.040]  the argument would be well it's better just to get it out and still educate
[27:40.040 --> 27:44.320]  people about these things who knows though that that is all pre preemptive
[27:44.320 --> 27:49.000]  and we can't comment until we see what happens but you know I engage the
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.360]  mainstream media I rarely turn down interviews more and more I do I probably
[27:54.360 --> 27:59.960]  turned down more than 10 big TV interviews in the last year because I'm
[27:59.960 --> 28:03.160]  just too busy making my own films and I don't want these people creeping around
[28:03.160 --> 28:06.480]  in my office I turned down history channel discovery channel the guy that
[28:06.480 --> 28:11.800]  specializes in doing JFK conspiracy theory hit pieces where he literally
[28:11.800 --> 28:17.240]  distorts and manufactures the evidence on record called me up you know kind of
[28:17.240 --> 28:20.560]  giggling at me on the phone and I just said look pal I don't want to be on your
[28:20.560 --> 28:26.680]  show he goes you don't want to be on TV and I said no I don't want to so more
[28:26.680 --> 28:31.160]  and more I turned them down which most people would kill to be but you know what
[28:31.160 --> 28:37.120]  the guy that mr. what Joe Ballinger that made some kind of monster and paradise
[28:37.120 --> 28:46.240]  lost and so many other big hit films brothers keeper I mean he's one of the
[28:46.240 --> 28:50.960]  biggest documentary filmmakers with his partner out there he made a three point
[28:50.960 --> 28:57.680]  four million dollar discovery channel program with myself being the main
[28:57.680 --> 29:01.560]  character and he came back to me and said yeah they want us to make you look
[29:01.560 --> 29:06.480]  stupid and I'm not doing that and this is the guy that made paradise lost and
[29:06.480 --> 29:12.040]  some kind of monster and all these other huge films and so discovery channel
[29:12.040 --> 29:18.000]  shelled that entire film last year because they wanted a hit piece and so
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.840]  that's definitely what has happened with this new world order film so I tend to
[29:21.840 --> 29:24.760]  agree with Daniel Estel and who the by the way we just got online we're going
[29:24.760 --> 29:27.920]  to break come back in just a couple minutes Daniel Estel and joining us

[34:09.600 --> 34:14.360]  Terminator salvation the Philip K Dick movies and a lot more he told me about
[34:14.360 --> 34:17.440]  this two years ago and I kept it in confidence if anybody else would have
[34:17.440 --> 34:20.960]  told me something like that I would have I would have you know I thought they
[34:20.960 --> 34:24.400]  were making it up but Daniel's always been such a great source of info that I
[34:24.400 --> 34:28.080]  believed him then I talked to some folks I knew in Hollywood that separately have
[34:28.080 --> 34:31.960]  worked with the Philip K Dick estate with his daughters and confirmed that they
[34:31.960 --> 34:34.960]  knew the Halcyon group and what they were doing so that was very very exciting
[34:34.960 --> 34:39.760]  so he's here to talk about that as well but first the hit piece and that's what
[34:39.760 --> 34:43.480]  Bloomberg's reporting they're very excited the New York Times likes it the
[34:43.480 --> 34:47.200]  establishment loves this new film the New World Order they think it makes us all
[34:47.200 --> 34:51.280]  look like a bunch of idiots Daniel Estolin was interviewed for this film
[34:51.280 --> 34:55.720]  but wasn't in the film and I think he wasn't in the film because following
[34:55.720 --> 34:59.440]  around for two years they couldn't find anything to make him fit into their
[34:59.440 --> 35:03.920]  stereotypical conspiracy theorist box they did find that following me around
[35:03.920 --> 35:07.720]  for two years but in the end it's just gonna backfire on Daniel Estolin great
[35:07.720 --> 35:11.840]  to have you here with us thank you absolutely other people from the
[35:11.840 --> 35:15.120]  seeping production again it's not that they made us look like idiots they make
[35:15.120 --> 35:18.120]  us look like crazies and that's exactly what I was talking about a few days and
[35:18.120 --> 35:21.400]  one of the radio or television shows from England you know I'm tired of
[35:21.400 --> 35:24.360]  seeing time and again how people who are fighting this thing I should know
[35:24.360 --> 35:28.620]  better actually you know fall for this you know same trick each and every time
[35:28.620 --> 35:31.920]  now these people you know looking whatever the other characters name they
[35:31.920 --> 35:35.120]  followed me around for a year a year and a half while we were in the United
[35:35.120 --> 35:39.040]  States promoting my book the true story the build-up a group from New York to
[35:39.040 --> 35:41.880]  Portland I think to Eugene and I can't remember if they went with us to
[35:41.880 --> 35:45.680]  California but I certainly went from East Coast to the West Coast and certainly
[35:45.680 --> 35:49.640]  they obviously didn't have anything you know worthy of making us look making me
[35:49.640 --> 35:53.880]  look like an idiot or a crazy so they decided to take it out what doesn't make
[35:53.880 --> 35:58.720]  any sense and again you know these these are the people with some very dark
[35:58.720 --> 36:02.680]  sinister objectives whatever they may be but it certainly haven't done us any
[36:02.680 --> 36:06.200]  favors because again talking to the people who understand what part of
[36:06.200 --> 36:09.840]  establishment they're all basically saying shaking their heads you know this
[36:09.840 --> 36:14.160]  thing this documentary the ceiling productions new old order has taken out
[36:14.160 --> 36:18.200]  you know not a couple of steps back but way way back in this fight because again
[36:18.200 --> 36:22.720]  you cannot wear toilet seat around your neck or G string around your head while
[36:22.720 --> 36:26.200]  you screen the government did it from a corner of a major intersection in New
[36:26.200 --> 36:30.680]  York City and be taken seriously by anybody who's a normal Joe and I think
[36:30.680 --> 36:34.600]  that's the objective the objective is not to talk to each other of so many
[36:34.600 --> 36:38.560]  people do on all these you know chats and forums but actually go out and try to
[36:38.560 --> 36:42.880]  convince normal nine to five working people who go to work who come home
[36:42.880 --> 36:46.400]  watch television play golf on the weekends play cards with friends do
[36:46.400 --> 36:51.040]  barbecues that the new old order exists and the only way to do this is not to
[36:51.040 --> 36:55.520]  wear toilet seats or G strings but actually make sense and not talk crazy
[36:55.520 --> 37:00.720]  well absolutely you know the issue here the way Bloomberg and the LA Times and
[37:00.720 --> 37:05.200]  the New York Times are going after me on this is is by association and then they
[37:05.200 --> 37:08.920]  also I had Bilderberg security walk up to me in the bar the night before it
[37:08.920 --> 37:14.280]  closed in Chantilly and they said people pull fire alarms they go to prison
[37:14.280 --> 37:19.600]  they try to steal vases and Rob Jacobson was my witness he's with me and we go
[37:19.600 --> 37:26.000]  what are you talking about pull firearms we go upstairs the door closes right as
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.800]  I go on a radio show the fire alarm goes off then I go downstairs and the head of
[37:30.800 --> 37:36.640]  security walks up and says I'm gonna f you up Jones and all of this happens and
[37:36.640 --> 37:44.240]  then the way the movie makes it look I'm crazy I think a fire alarm is for me and
[37:44.240 --> 37:49.840]  that's what the but I mean I can't help Daniel when the media just lies and and
[37:49.840 --> 37:54.160]  and you know when Bloomberg says I'm imagining fire alarms I mean that the
[37:54.160 --> 37:58.240]  news is saying I'm imagining cars following us that followed us off
[37:58.240 --> 38:02.680]  Bilderberg I mean I had guys walking up to me at my hotel saying let's go attack
[38:02.680 --> 38:07.040]  the State Department together and they were big FBI agents and and you know so
[38:07.040 --> 38:11.760]  so so you know we're in reality which looks kooky to people and then the main
[38:11.760 --> 38:15.080]  line public so dumb down it looks yeah I mean it can be made to look crazy and
[38:15.080 --> 38:18.520]  they stick the one guy in there from England or Ireland who thinks he has a
[38:18.520 --> 38:22.880]  chip in his head you know that's that that's the production companies issue I
[38:22.880 --> 38:27.320]  mean I guess I could turn down all interviews in the future or or or you
[38:27.320 --> 38:31.000]  could and I actually am turning down a lot of interviews I mean how do you how
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.480]  do you handle that Daniel well you know I mean an example one of things that
[38:35.480 --> 38:38.360]  New York Times and the Washington Post as well I've never done a company when
[38:38.360 --> 38:41.440]  you're touching it because they know anything they throw out me I can
[38:41.440 --> 38:45.600]  actually you know deflect it and and and win any argument against them you know
[38:45.600 --> 38:52.080]  not very long ago I found one of the chat and one of the other websites people
[38:52.080 --> 38:56.400]  talking about you know the the need for creating a universal language and I
[38:56.400 --> 39:00.360]  kind of want to start occur to me you know do people actually understand that
[39:00.360 --> 39:05.040]  you know part of HG Wells's ultimate revolution was in fact the elimination
[39:05.040 --> 39:08.800]  of all national languages in favor what you call basic English which out of a
[39:08.800 --> 39:13.080]  cablery I would have had a vocabulary of only 850 words now if you ask people for
[39:13.080 --> 39:17.400]  as an example if people who are listening to the show and you can explain it to
[39:17.400 --> 39:20.880]  others because again you cannot say government did it wearing a toilet seat
[39:20.880 --> 39:24.760]  around your neck you have to explain to people who I what and where that's the
[39:24.760 --> 39:28.840]  only way we can actually get them on our side because the only thing we can do is
[39:28.840 --> 39:31.880]  get people to listen so for example if I have a couple of minutes I'd like to
[39:31.880 --> 39:35.800]  give you an example of what I'm talking about I want you to do that but then in
[39:35.800 --> 39:39.960]  the time we have limited I want to get into your new book the work you're doing
[39:39.960 --> 39:45.240]  you haven't been a lot of two minutes now you know as you know you know we'll
[39:45.240 --> 39:48.800]  talk about this before what today's called the build-up or group about six
[39:48.800 --> 39:51.440]  seven hundred years ago had another name was called the Venetian black
[39:51.440 --> 39:55.480]  nobility now these people who are today to build the burgers they know that
[39:55.480 --> 39:59.760]  idea of a more powerful weapon than guns and fleets and bombs now in order to
[39:59.760 --> 40:05.280]  secure acceptance for their imperial ideas the Venetian ability seeks to
[40:05.280 --> 40:08.920]  control the way people think we know that if you can control the way people
[40:08.920 --> 40:13.000]  think say the Venetians you can control whether we spawn three of them no
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.600]  matter what those events so if we can do the same and get people actually you
[40:17.600 --> 40:21.120]  know to think the way we want them to think we can win for example you know
[40:21.120 --> 40:26.320]  we're talking about languages in the early part of the 1200s you know Italian
[40:26.320 --> 40:30.960]  language didn't exist it was born with a name by the name of Dante Alighieri who
[40:30.960 --> 40:35.200]  was the of course the writer the great genius behind the divine comedy who we
[40:35.200 --> 40:40.880]  find the counter form of poetry now his follower Francesco Petraca sought to
[40:40.880 --> 40:44.840]  advance the language further with the invention of a sonnet and Petraca's
[40:44.840 --> 40:49.160]  friend Boccaccio invented the thing called the Decameron of Decameron was
[40:49.160 --> 40:53.440]  triggered in order to prevent the in the Italian society from thinking of the
[40:53.440 --> 40:58.280]  cultural pessimism and dying out during the black death of 1340s you see that's
[40:58.280 --> 41:01.840]  how the Italian language was born then Jeffrey Chaucer who attended one of
[41:01.840 --> 41:06.400]  the lectures by Boccaccio on Dante in 1375 he got the idea to do the same thing
[41:06.400 --> 41:09.800]  in English and you have the Canterbury tales which of course recounts the
[41:09.800 --> 41:13.720]  hilarious tales told on a religious pilgrimage to the Church of Canterbury
[41:13.720 --> 41:18.520]  the same thing happened in French when the Christian humanist Erasmus of
[41:18.520 --> 41:23.480]  Rotterdam inspired his student France while we belong to the same in France by
[41:23.480 --> 41:27.760]  creating this amazing character called Gadotua and then in Spanish we have this
[41:27.760 --> 41:32.160]  great example of Don Quixote de la Mancha the accountant and his psychic
[41:32.160 --> 41:36.760]  Sancho Panza you see in this way languages created by poets listed up the
[41:36.760 --> 41:41.480]  populations that have been dominated by ignorance and thereby ruled over in fact
[41:41.480 --> 41:45.120]  the most important thing in this entire thing that I said is that the nations
[41:45.120 --> 41:49.320]  were created by languages and not the other way around which now you know
[41:49.320 --> 41:53.800]  suddenly makes sense why age you well wanted to create the basic English
[41:53.800 --> 41:58.400]  because in the wealthiest future world the English most speak and write today
[41:58.400 --> 42:02.160]  is very different yeah it's in shock it's in shock I mean that's what George
[42:02.160 --> 42:06.840]  Arwell in 1984 talks about dumbing the language down so it's impossible to
[42:06.840 --> 42:11.000]  relay an idea so they dumb it down to just emotions and so people just say
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.160]  that looks goofy it must not be true but the sharp guy in the suit on TV selling
[42:16.160 --> 42:21.360]  you that Iraq has WMD's that looks and sounds credible so you go along with it
[42:21.360 --> 42:25.600]  yes I understand exactly what you're saying why they're in Europe they're
[42:25.600 --> 42:29.480]  creating one language there's no longer languages individual cultures other
[42:29.480 --> 42:33.480]  languages but they're creating three four main languages that everybody must
[42:33.480 --> 42:36.200]  speak of the expense of their languages the French are fighting that the
[42:36.200 --> 42:40.200]  Spanish are fighting that the point is that you know they're trying to do this
[42:40.200 --> 42:44.120]  and if you explain to people from a logical perspective without wearing a
[42:44.120 --> 42:48.400]  toilet seat or making crazy noises which a lot of people do then actually you
[42:48.400 --> 42:51.480]  have people who are listening to you from the point of view of logic and
[42:51.480 --> 42:55.600]  reason and then we have them one over because again as long as logic and
[42:55.600 --> 42:59.920]  reason prevails we can win this war if people are basically talking to each
[42:59.920 --> 43:04.080]  other there's two things okay there's the principle and a technique and the
[43:04.080 --> 43:07.640]  technique of the release people most of them are crazy we're talking to each
[43:07.640 --> 43:11.440]  other all these forums and chat we don't make any sense to anybody outside the
[43:11.440 --> 43:15.000]  forum or the chat all right I don't know if it's a child and that's what you're
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.240]  saying you understand the prison planet forum was saying you're a Bilderberg
[43:18.240 --> 43:22.160]  group member ridiculous talking about that's the crazies I but that was some
[43:22.160 --> 43:25.760]  that was somebody linking to a story a million post a month I can't yeah and
[43:25.760 --> 43:29.840]  so many and so many forms in so many countries and I'll be in English and
[43:29.840 --> 43:34.480]  French and in Germany in Spanish and they're all the same because the title
[43:34.480 --> 43:37.960]  people who do these kinds of things are the same but the idea is instead of wasting
[43:37.960 --> 43:42.720]  time talking to each other learn about history what about learn about I agree
[43:42.720 --> 43:47.400]  that's what I do and try to explain to people why what today is called Bilderberg
[43:47.400 --> 43:50.840]  800 years ago was called something else and why they're doing what they're
[43:50.840 --> 43:54.280]  doing because again to say well they're trying to take a freedom away to most
[43:54.280 --> 43:58.160]  people is just simply not good enough yeah this is the true ruling council of
[43:58.160 --> 44:01.520]  the planet and if you watch the European Parliament as I've been doing they admit
[44:01.520 --> 44:05.680]  it is a global Europe is what they're calling it and they're openly announcing
[44:05.680 --> 44:09.080]  world government a bank of the world that we will pay our carbon taxes to
[44:09.080 --> 44:12.520]  Daniel talking to you yesterday on the phone you were starting to say peak oil
[44:12.520 --> 44:15.920]  was a scam I know you've been trying to research it and questioning it a few
[44:15.920 --> 44:21.720]  years ago do you now believe that peak oil is a eugenicist false scarcity scam
[44:21.720 --> 44:26.400]  not look you know in the world there are two energy sources one is called
[44:26.400 --> 44:29.960]  nuclear energy the other one is called oil unfortunately people control the
[44:29.960 --> 44:33.320]  world will never let nuclear energy which is the cheapest you know the best of
[44:33.320 --> 44:37.840]  the longest lasting energy signal source in the entire world that can actually
[44:37.840 --> 44:42.360]  increase our population base from 6.7 billion to about 10 billion because
[44:42.360 --> 44:47.360]  again the energy flux density in nuclear energy flux density has nothing to do in
[44:47.360 --> 44:51.880]  terms of calories with you know with solar energy wind or even oil it's much
[44:51.880 --> 44:55.760]  heavier much denser you know obviously can do things which no other source of
[44:55.760 --> 44:59.600]  energy can do now as the people who control the world can't possibly afford
[44:59.600 --> 45:04.080]  as I explained my book to let third world countries have access to nuclear
[45:04.080 --> 45:08.520]  energy because it will allow them to stand up on their own feet and no longer
[45:08.520 --> 45:11.600]  need the funding from the International Monetary Fund in the
[45:11.600 --> 45:16.480]  World Bank and company and so we have only basically one energy source
[45:16.480 --> 45:19.600]  available and that's oil and unfortunately as we are running out of
[45:19.600 --> 45:24.080]  oil that's what I'm saying there's only unfortunately again unfortunately you
[45:24.080 --> 45:28.160]  know this global warming is a big scam it's not a global warming actually it's
[45:28.160 --> 45:31.640]  global cooling right now yes you know which you work in periods of about a
[45:31.640 --> 45:35.080]  hundred thousand years and we're actually smack in the middle of global
[45:35.080 --> 45:39.360]  cooling absolutely our company will tell you otherwise so this is a form of
[45:39.360 --> 45:43.680]  neo-surfdom as the Royal Commission put out with the British and 49 stated to
[45:43.680 --> 45:47.600]  shut down the third world not let them get resources to develop and deal with
[45:47.600 --> 45:50.800]  eugenics now now Daniel we've got limited time and we really appreciate you
[45:50.800 --> 45:56.960]  joining us again the new book is out the North American Union edition
[45:56.960 --> 46:01.920]  available at infowars.com or just google you can also go to Daniel Estolin.com
[46:01.920 --> 46:07.760]  as well Daniel I want to talk about the big press conference coming up Friday
[46:07.760 --> 46:11.520]  you told me in confidence which I was honored you did two years ago that you
[46:11.520 --> 46:15.000]  you've done this movie deal and now it's going to be made and there's a press
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.640]  conference coming up that they're gonna sync up Friday with the European
[46:19.640 --> 46:26.280]  premiere of Terminator film salvation tell us about that this is very very
[46:26.280 --> 46:30.760]  exciting well the you know the other deal has been in work for about four
[46:30.760 --> 46:33.800]  years obviously you know working with Hollywood even if it's on an independent
[46:33.800 --> 46:38.720]  studio and they are it takes time it's a very long and arduous process we've been
[46:38.720 --> 46:43.520]  talking to them since 2005 my book was released in Spanish was done to my
[46:43.520 --> 46:49.200]  former agent in Sweden and this Friday we have press conference announcing
[46:49.200 --> 46:53.800]  during the European premiere of Terminator salvation that their next big
[46:53.800 --> 46:57.040]  movie is going to be a project is going to be based on the true story of the
[46:57.040 --> 46:59.640]  build-up of a group it's not going to be a documentary it's going to be a full
[46:59.640 --> 47:04.760]  motion picture absolutely that is so exciting and and is this going to be
[47:04.760 --> 47:10.040]  like a thriller I mean you give us any any window is it along the line I would
[47:10.040 --> 47:13.480]  be usually with work is they probably going to commission four or five
[47:13.480 --> 47:19.960]  directors to write a a mini script and based on on you know each individual
[47:19.960 --> 47:23.400]  vision of the directors will happen based on which one they like most is that
[47:23.400 --> 47:26.560]  one they're going to probably go with it obviously it's going to be a you know a
[47:26.560 --> 47:31.520]  money-making proposition it's the budget for it is I can't really say at this
[47:31.520 --> 47:35.360]  point in time but it's a very very big budget at working most budgets for most
[47:35.360 --> 47:40.520]  action-adventure films but anyway the idea that these people are on the right
[47:40.520 --> 47:44.520]  track Terminator salvation is probably the highest grossing film of this year
[47:44.520 --> 47:52.040]  if not one deadly number two and the the video whether the video game version is
[47:52.040 --> 47:55.800]  already doing very very well so obviously you know that these people are
[47:55.800 --> 47:59.560]  going to have enough money to finance the project of soft which is what we're
[47:59.560 --> 48:03.040]  actually very concerned with initially and now we're very very pleased absolutely
[48:03.040 --> 48:07.800]  the toys alone the toys alone are going to finance the next you got the toys you
[48:07.800 --> 48:12.880]  got the TV show spinoffs you've got a team but you know that's why they
[48:12.880 --> 48:17.160]  certainly made the Terminator salvation PG-13 and you know they can do the same
[48:17.160 --> 48:20.000]  for this one that means that you know Burger King and company that have you
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.800]  know Daniel Estruan action figures so so actually this is the the the main
[48:25.800 --> 48:29.960]  hero is it is going to be you well it's going to be me or it's going to be based
[48:29.960 --> 48:33.600]  on someone like me I you know it's beyond the idea of the duplicity and the
[48:33.600 --> 48:39.320]  lies and the obfuscations and and and the decedent of the people behind you
[48:39.320 --> 48:43.280]  know the other curtain it's also a very human story of a person in this
[48:43.280 --> 48:47.040]  particular case you know who against a lot tries to find the truth and also
[48:47.040 --> 48:51.160]  tries to learn about himself it also is a very human story as well on many
[48:51.160 --> 48:53.920]  different levels I guess that's one of the things that really appealed to them
[48:53.920 --> 48:57.080]  it's not just you know good guys bad guys but we have so many other elements
[48:57.080 --> 49:02.160]  which you can play with and make into a beautiful movie all right Daniel I want
[49:02.160 --> 49:05.600]  to get into where you've been the last few years you've been very busy I've
[49:05.600 --> 49:08.440]  always you know reported the folks you've been writing another book some
[49:08.440 --> 49:11.360]  people are like whereas you have you been the last two Bilderbergs you made the
[49:11.360 --> 49:14.680]  point that if it's a Bilderberg where you can't get good photos we did get
[49:14.680 --> 49:18.080]  Bernanke and a few others in Chantilly but if it's not good to get photos what
[49:18.080 --> 49:21.280]  is the point and also you've been writing a new book you you told me the
[49:21.280 --> 49:25.600]  harrowing tales of what happened when you went to Africa to cover African and
[49:25.600 --> 49:30.800]  and and the takeover by the globalist there tell us about your new and by the
[49:30.800 --> 49:34.240]  way I'm gonna skip this network break for this is a network break coming up
[49:34.240 --> 49:39.760]  we're skipping it everybody that's the network and stations tell us about what
[49:39.760 --> 49:46.360]  you've been working on the last few years Daniel because I get emails from
[49:46.360 --> 49:49.840]  people who send me links you know to chat and form all over the world people
[49:49.840 --> 49:52.760]  asking where I was really you know I didn't understand why everybody's so
[49:52.760 --> 49:56.040]  concerned about who I would you know where I am or what I'm doing but the
[49:56.040 --> 49:59.440]  point is that I haven't gone to deliver the last couple of years I've been
[49:59.440 --> 50:02.640]  comments from certain individuals saying that I made so much money for my book I
[50:02.640 --> 50:06.160]  no longer am interested no the reason I haven't gotten this year last year is
[50:06.160 --> 50:09.680]  because you know this year's billable conference was held in a single tell that
[50:09.680 --> 50:13.760]  I covered way back my first billable conference in 1993 and I know the place
[50:13.760 --> 50:17.640]  a lot here shampoos I know it very well too because I was there in 2002 there's
[50:17.640 --> 50:21.360]  absolutely no way to get anyone near a hotel to take the photograph and just to
[50:21.360 --> 50:24.880]  go there to be harassed by people I don't need to do that because again I get
[50:24.880 --> 50:28.640]  information sitting in the living room my house as I've done this you know this
[50:28.640 --> 50:31.600]  particular year as well scooping the whole world on the billable there
[50:31.600 --> 50:35.040]  pre-meeting agenda and you know what these people have talked about so that's
[50:35.040 --> 50:38.160]  the reason I haven't got not because I stopped doing it because it would have
[50:38.160 --> 50:41.640]  made so much money and too wealthy right now and as far as it's actually true I
[50:41.640 --> 50:45.520]  haven't done any interviews in the past year or hardly any simply because I've
[50:45.520 --> 50:49.120]  been working in my new book now anyone who has written a book all right know
[50:49.120 --> 50:52.520]  that it's not the same writing that call a comment on the chat forum that is
[50:52.520 --> 50:55.640]  writing a book which you know it's very hard I'm writing a book right now and
[50:55.640 --> 50:59.840]  pulling my hair out it was supposed to be done a year ago seven days a week
[50:59.840 --> 51:03.680]  365 days a year that thing doesn't leave even when you're sleeping I've tried
[51:03.680 --> 51:06.480]  eating coffee and biscuits next to the computer and saying it would write it
[51:06.480 --> 51:11.120]  itself unfortunately got it I have to physically sit down with my little
[51:11.120 --> 51:14.920]  fingers start typing words and letters and sentences a lot of chapters in my
[51:14.920 --> 51:19.520]  new book the shadow masters which will be by Friday sometime in October talk
[51:19.520 --> 51:24.240]  about Africa what they should have done is that I'm covered how international
[51:24.240 --> 51:28.240]  corporations big but he was such as Caliburton and company a working
[51:28.240 --> 51:32.040]  head and go out with the world European and North American government
[51:32.040 --> 51:36.800]  Israelis the the Russians even the Chinese are there of course in Sudan
[51:36.800 --> 51:41.720]  the Americans the Canadians the the French the English how all of them are
[51:41.720 --> 51:46.840]  working and also with all the top NGOs in the world from Human Rights Watch to
[51:46.840 --> 51:51.240]  Care to Oxfam etc and they have only one objective in mind I'm talking about
[51:51.240 --> 51:55.840]  Sudan that is to get rid of all the blacks living there so that they can get
[51:55.840 --> 52:00.880]  at the natural resources under their feet now I didn't go with any you are the
[52:00.880 --> 52:04.560]  tourists are a tourist visa and I didn't go as an embedded reporter with
[52:04.560 --> 52:09.240]  anybody I went with a group of very trusted comrades at secret service and
[52:09.240 --> 52:13.200]  all of us until the teeth went to the areas which we thought necessary to go
[52:13.200 --> 52:17.160]  and see the things that were being done there for the people and it's absolutely
[52:17.160 --> 52:20.520]  amazing Africa is an amazing continent you know for twenty thousand dollars
[52:20.520 --> 52:24.600]  you can kill an elephant for about fifteen thousand killer a lion or maybe
[52:24.600 --> 52:28.160]  eight thousand killer zebra and for about twenty bucks you can kill a black
[52:28.160 --> 52:32.480]  person about a hundred dollars until his whole family that's Africa and I tell
[52:32.480 --> 52:36.200]  you there you don't really understand it so what I've done is you were telling me
[52:36.200 --> 52:39.320]  you've got photos so hardcore you probably can't even put them in your
[52:39.320 --> 52:43.480]  book well you know as a matter of fact you know the the Spanish version of this
[52:43.480 --> 52:47.400]  book was released last year alright just as because I live in Spain as you know
[52:47.400 --> 52:50.360]  buildable was supposed to be sustained you know this book was released in
[52:50.360 --> 52:53.400]  Spain my publisher had a look at the photos you know they met with the lawyers
[52:53.400 --> 52:57.240]  and I said we cannot do this we cannot release these photographs so basically
[52:57.240 --> 53:00.600]  just released a few but again I will talk to Chris Miller again and see if we
[53:00.600 --> 53:04.440]  can actually get all these photographs in the book but the point is that again
[53:04.440 --> 53:09.800]  it's an amazing continent of contrast you can see literally cultures which have
[53:09.800 --> 53:12.960]  been untouched in the last three hours well Daniel give us a window into this
[53:12.960 --> 53:15.720]  it's important because you were there you said you want with special forces
[53:15.720 --> 53:20.040]  people you got a lot of courage to talk about adventure I hope that's in the
[53:20.040 --> 53:25.160]  upcoming Bilderberg movie tell us some of what you saw well again a couple of
[53:25.160 --> 53:30.520]  things that you see in the long-lasting you know everybody has assumed over the
[53:30.520 --> 53:34.600]  the last decade and several generations especially since the Second World War
[53:34.600 --> 53:37.840]  you know the British and the Americans the Israelis and Americans these things
[53:37.840 --> 53:40.880]  no longer exist you know the Americans are fighting the Israelis the Israelis
[53:40.880 --> 53:43.880]  the British the British the Americans the Russians the Chinese the Chinese the
[53:43.880 --> 53:47.080]  French everybody's fighting each other they're no longer they're no longer
[53:47.080 --> 53:51.160]  friends they're just temporary partners alright in this quest for the natural
[53:51.160 --> 53:55.080]  resources and again go back to the natural resource and I do have to go
[53:55.080 --> 53:58.120]  a couple of minutes that people waiting outside from from my television crew I
[53:58.120 --> 54:02.040]  don't know for where but the point is that what you actually have is again
[54:02.040 --> 54:06.200]  where the point where we can all you know make a substantial jump to 10
[54:06.200 --> 54:10.320]  billion people of population and the only way we can do this the only way is
[54:10.320 --> 54:14.440]  through nuclear energy or we're gonna go down to about two billion people if we
[54:14.440 --> 54:19.040]  stay with us you know nonsense okay anybody sure sure Daniel Daniel we've
[54:19.040 --> 54:21.760]  got you on the schedule for another three or four minutes can you send somebody
[54:21.760 --> 54:26.600]  to the door to get that TV crew in there I can probably do that okay good
[54:26.600 --> 54:29.360]  let me just ask you these final questions here in the time we've got
[54:29.360 --> 54:32.440]  then but can't wait to have you said in the next few weeks should come back on
[54:32.440 --> 54:37.480]  for an hour correct well we know we'll definitely see it all depends on the
[54:37.480 --> 54:42.240]  Hollywood people exactly what they have in mind if there's promotion or not no
[54:42.240 --> 54:45.120]  regardless I wanted to when I talked to you yesterday you said that you'd
[54:45.120 --> 54:47.840]  probably come on the next few weeks so we can talk more because I want to talk
[54:47.840 --> 54:53.040]  about the intel you got from Bilderberg 2009 because I know you as you've said
[54:53.040 --> 54:57.200]  to have people that have attended Bilderberg that you know I don't know
[54:57.200 --> 55:00.760]  how much of what we talked about off air I can even say that's another issue did
[55:00.760 --> 55:04.280]  you see the articles about the meeting two weeks ago before Bilderberg right
[55:04.280 --> 55:08.240]  before it of David Rockefeller of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation of
[55:08.240 --> 55:13.080]  Warren Buffett where they admit here that you know basically they don't want
[55:13.080 --> 55:15.920]  people to think they're an alternative to world government and that the meeting
[55:15.920 --> 55:21.920]  was over population that it was all about reducing world population and that
[55:21.920 --> 55:25.280]  they really want to get this job done your comments on this group they're
[55:25.280 --> 55:28.720]  now calling I haven't I haven't seen it but you know it again it's it's you
[55:28.720 --> 55:33.880]  know the the policy of the world wildlife on you know the just also you know
[55:33.880 --> 55:37.640]  of the two degenerates the prince Bernardo benevolent of the founders of
[55:37.640 --> 55:41.120]  the billable group and of course the the consorts of the Queen Elizabeth the
[55:41.120 --> 55:45.640]  second of England Prince Philip you know both masses both degenerates and you
[55:45.640 --> 55:49.080]  know that their policy genocide or reduce the world population which again it
[55:49.080 --> 55:54.440]  more or less the same about policy as Greenpeace or Al Gore you know go green
[55:54.440 --> 55:58.280]  green is good I would use the way we live and obviously you know back to the
[55:58.280 --> 56:02.320]  case that's not good that's idiotic and anybody who follows it again have to
[56:02.320 --> 56:05.440]  understand why they're talking about it but again maybe we can talk about it
[56:05.440 --> 56:10.480]  the next time absolutely neo feudalism shadow masters though it's gonna come
[56:10.480 --> 56:19.200]  out in the fall or winter of this year in the nuts Daniel not it's gonna come
[56:19.200 --> 56:24.320]  out in the fall very very exciting just in the last minute or two with you know
[56:24.320 --> 56:27.560]  any key information that you haven't covered that you've gotten from
[56:27.560 --> 56:32.440]  Bilderberg this year any inside intel I'm sorry I didn't hear anything you said
[56:32.440 --> 56:39.200]  any extra info on what happened in Bilderberg 2009 well actually yes I'm
[56:39.200 --> 56:42.160]  just working on my billable report right now there's a lot of information I
[56:42.160 --> 56:46.000]  have a 70 feet page they know report from these people and I'm going through
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.360]  very very slowly through it and when I have a whole thing done what we'll do is
[56:49.360 --> 56:56.680]  we'll post it on my website and that's Daniel Estelin dot com all right
[56:56.680 --> 57:01.240]  well Daniel I appreciate your time and again I'd like to get you up for a full
[57:01.240 --> 57:05.520]  interview in the near future I hope the family's doing well everybody's doing
[57:05.520 --> 57:08.600]  well and again I want people to remember the keeping production of the new old
[57:08.600 --> 57:12.480]  order you know they went after us and they blindsided the people in the film
[57:12.480 --> 57:16.800]  and obviously you know these people one way or another have they we have to let
[57:16.800 --> 57:20.400]  them know but certainly we don't agree with them did they promise you that it
[57:20.400 --> 57:25.480]  wasn't gonna be a hit piece you know again it doesn't really matter at this
[57:25.480 --> 57:28.640]  point you know he said she said but the point is that you know you don't follow
[57:28.640 --> 57:31.920]  somebody around for a year and a half not to have a minute film you know the
[57:31.920 --> 57:35.560]  intention was to have me there as a centipede but unfortunately I didn't say
[57:35.560 --> 57:38.680]  enough stupid things so you know if you couldn't have me in the film you know
[57:38.680 --> 57:42.480]  as I said you know there's everything I say makes perfect logical sense I get
[57:42.480 --> 57:46.000]  expulsion you know what they thought the Bilderberg was called the mission
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.200]  ability out of years ago why language you know creates cultures and nations and
[57:50.200 --> 57:54.240]  not the other way around I agree with you you want people who are toilet seats
[57:54.240 --> 57:59.400]  screaming the government did it yeah well we've got up somehow reach out to
[57:59.400 --> 58:02.360]  the public you know what none of us are perfect but we have been somewhat
[58:02.360 --> 58:07.080]  effective at waking a lot of people up and then they can find more eloquent and
[58:07.080 --> 58:11.240]  refined folks like like you Daniel that's one but you know we all do the best
[58:11.240 --> 58:14.840]  job we can but I agree the film is somewhat of a distortion overall we're
[58:14.840 --> 58:18.800]  gonna make lemonade out of these lemons Daniel we will talk to you again very
[58:18.800 --> 58:24.640]  very soon God speak congratulations on all your success take care take care

[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:33.840]  happens is I learned a lot of stuff behind the scenes so Daniel's really a
[1:00:33.840 --> 1:00:37.440]  very interesting guy and I have a lot of connections and things and so that's why
[1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:41.120]  two years ago he told me the people that bought the Terminator franchise were
[1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:44.000]  going to make a major motion picture it's going to be along the lines of angels
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:48.760]  and demons I mean I don't you know a big thriller that's what I've got scuttle
[1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:51.440]  butt in Hollywood I mean I made some phone calls two years ago about this
[1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:56.760]  and then I almost forgot about it and then Daniel was going to come on about a
[1:00:56.760 --> 1:01:01.440]  week ago and people were you know sending him stuff sending and stuff off the
[1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:05.880]  forum sending him people attacking him on the prison planet forum you know you
[1:01:05.880 --> 1:01:12.320]  know we have forums we have comments but I own my websites and it's my right to
[1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:16.040]  shut it down stuff if I want to I don't think I'm going to do it but it's not
[1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:21.360]  censorship if I get rid of the message board and the comments it's that I can't
[1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:26.240]  handle the Secret Service here twice federal subpoenas twice from the FBI and
[1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:31.720]  federal courts that I'm gag ordered to not talk about you know people in in
[1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:37.040]  black suits showing up people creating fake post on the thing that are
[1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:41.560]  supposedly for me people you know taking a French newspaper saying Daniel
[1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:46.360]  Estolin was at Bilderberg with a fake list someone posted and then even if
[1:01:46.360 --> 1:01:52.280]  Estolin's a smart guy and knows that we didn't post that it still upsets you
[1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:58.080]  know most people and then I talked to me I have about 35 minutes and maybe 40
[1:01:58.080 --> 1:02:01.400]  minutes my wife's like oh we got to go to my in-law you know and my family's and
[1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:06.080]  I'm like okay I got off phone excellent but was good talking to him I learned a
[1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:10.240]  lot more and you know I remember vaguely asking him two years ago see think
[1:02:10.240 --> 1:02:15.440]  what see think productions who are you interviewing for this and they said oh
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:18.680]  we're interviewing Jack McClam maybe hadn't talked to him yet we're interviewing
[1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:23.600]  Luke Radowski no no I recommended Luke Radowski we're interviewing some guy
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:30.040]  in Florida and we may interview Daniel Estolin well now I learned they followed
[1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:33.800]  Estolin around off and on for two years because I mean I first met these guys in
[1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:37.400]  2006 myself a right after you yeah right after Bilderberg yeah it was in the
[1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:43.400]  summer 2006 it's 2009 three and a half four years later this is now coming out
[1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:53.120]  today IFC big premiere and so I can imagine the feelings Daniel was having
[1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:57.000]  number one the president planet forum saying he's Bilderberg totally made up
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.760]  I remember some idiot showed a dark-haired guy photo from Bilderberg you
[1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:04.600]  know said it was Charlie Sheen there obviously wasn't Charlie Sheen people
[1:03:04.600 --> 1:03:09.160]  just people do that and I've learned to ignore it you know Daniel was saying
[1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:11.720]  why are people interested where I am or what I'm doing well you're a public
[1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:15.880]  figure now Daniel you know that you're on radio you're on TV you have a
[1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:22.160]  best-selling book all over the world or 46 nations or whatever it says I mean you
[1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:25.880]  said there's gonna be action figures of you at Burger King get ready for folks
[1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:29.000]  to want to know where you are and what you're doing you know this is how this
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:37.680]  works but you know it's got to be a little bit bitter to have people follow
[1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:43.000]  you around for two years and then not be in it even if it's a hit piece somewhat
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  it's a waste of time you know it was like for a year to have Discovery
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:51.640]  Channel follow me around and you know have them with huge cameras in my car
[1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:56.120]  ripping the upholstery and lights all over me and following me around it was a
[1:03:56.120 --> 1:04:00.040]  lot of work and that was a good director and he wouldn't make a hit piece on me
[1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:03.400]  and they told him to go edit it and change it and he said well I'll try but
[1:04:03.400 --> 1:04:07.520]  I don't want to make Alex look bad and this was gonna make us huge folks this
[1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:12.920]  was a huge five-part series for Discovery Channel with yours truly as the
[1:04:12.920 --> 1:04:19.720]  star and they killed it you know he called me up he said you know do you
[1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:22.560]  think I should do this to you know they want me to interview this guy and this
[1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:26.040]  guy from Fox News and we'll interview all your enemies and are you game to do
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:30.080]  that and I said yeah I don't want this to go to waste you know you'll make it be
[1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:34.280]  two-sided both sides and then he called me back a week later he just said I
[1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:39.120]  can't do it I just just I'm not changing it and that sucker went on the
[1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:47.640]  shelf 3.4 million dollar budget on the shelf so I know what it's like but I'm
[1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:50.720]  not gonna let people on the internet turn me and Daniel Estlund against each
[1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:55.160]  other and I appreciate the plug he gave us on press TV for prison planet.com

[1:06:25.080 --> 1:06:29.240]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is

[1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:40.920]  that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government

[1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:30.120]  world order from here tonight I get attacked almost every day by the main
[1:08:30.120 --> 1:08:33.360]  stream media and I don't usually cover it people always email me saying why
[1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:37.000]  it's talking about this TV show or this local show or this radio show or this
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:42.200]  Washington Post article you can Google the name Alex Jones any given day and
[1:08:42.200 --> 1:08:48.400]  click news and you'll see a hit piece against me I love it I absolutely love
[1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:54.800]  it I just keep moving forward and you know I've said I think the film is the
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:09:01.240]  most objective most fair but I've also said that it stereotypes and it picked
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:10.720]  the few little corny things we did so the film is a distortion the guys that made
[1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:15.280]  it know sitting around you know eating popcorn editing this thing that they
[1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:18.360]  were choosing the most entertaining and hokey things just for entertainment
[1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:23.000]  value alone and you follow people around all these years but with me there's
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:31.600]  really nothing discrediting other than I'm sweating in 95% humidity in 100
[1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:37.360]  degree temperatures was so hot in that June in Virginia you know right off the
[1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:40.440]  coastline I mean everybody was just pouring sweat in the New York Times said
[1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:45.200]  look at Alex Jones he's sweaty you know he's loud every stereotype yeah we're
[1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:49.760]  loud like the founding fathers are like George Washington at Trenton when he
[1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:54.440]  charged in against the Hessians was he was he sweating was he yelling was he
[1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:58.080]  I mean this is what we're supposed to do they say oh you're not supposed to get
[1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:01.760]  excited you're not supposed to get angry well I like what Howard Beald said in
[1:10:01.760 --> 1:10:06.160]  network you've got to get mad you've got to say I'm a human being my life has
[1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:12.120]  value and they do show some guy who made a weird you know documentary about a
[1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:16.600]  police state in the future not even a documentary of fiction film with cheesy
[1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:20.560]  special effects not knocking the guy it's just that's what it shows and he
[1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:23.560]  thinks he's got a microchip in his head and that's guilt by association they
[1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:29.560]  went out and shows that and they show me in a hotel room after I had the head of
[1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:33.680]  security in the hotel with other men behind him in suits walk up to Rob
[1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:38.960]  Jacobson we need to put an article out about this about yes New York Times yes
[1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:44.480]  Bloomberg yes LA Times yes there really was a Bilderberg group meeting there
[1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:48.760]  really were people in cars following us they really did pull the fire alarm on
[1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:57.160]  us I mean these articles in Bloomberg today in the Los Angeles Times yesterday
[1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:04.920]  in the New York Times last week in variety.com that's right here I mean it's
[1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:08.080]  just everywhere you know there's there's LA Times for people watching at
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:13.040]  prisonplanet.tv should have at it we've been on live since 1130 there's
[1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:20.280]  Bloomberg there's a you know Washington Post I mean they're all here the point
[1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:30.760]  is is that you read these articles and I don't have time to go over these perhaps
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:36.080]  I should and in each article they say Jones believe you know believe he was in
[1:11:36.080 --> 1:11:40.520]  a hotel surrounded by an imaginary group going insane when a fire alarm goes off
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:44.080]  you know showing how important he is showing that there's a really a cabal
[1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:50.840]  showing this is proof there was secret service around it this is where Obama
[1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:53.560]  went at the secret meeting I meant to bring that up to Astelon Astelon who
[1:11:53.560 --> 1:12:01.320]  really does know some Bilderberg group members he I talked to Maristaz said you
[1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:05.240]  know you confirmed Obama was there correct and he said no absolutely so
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:11.080]  I mean he's on record that Obama was there and I've had mainstream news attack
[1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:14.840]  me saying I'm crazy saying Obama was there pretty fair piece though was done
[1:12:14.840 --> 1:12:20.640]  in Politico I have to say that one was a fair actual journalistic piece CBS news
[1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:24.040]  carried that on the nightly news by the way very bizarre so that's really the
[1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:29.560]  only one of the only fair pieces ever in US media that admits all of this now in
[1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:33.120]  the German news the French news the Russian news the Japanese news the
[1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:36.960]  British news the Irish news they admit here's the Bilderberg group here's their
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:40.320]  founding documents that got leaked they set up the European Union they won a
[1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:44.760]  one-world government they pick Prime Ministers and Presidents they're running
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:49.320]  the show their own documents who Etienne Davignon the Viscount the head of
[1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:55.320]  Bilderberg he's in the EU observer newspaper saying they run things you
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:12:58.920]  know they write books saying it David Rockefeller four years ago published his
[1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:02.920]  memoir saying it men in power is a political retrospective helmet Schmidt
[1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:07.280]  Braggs Bilderberg runs the planet and so I tried to give all of that to see
[1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:12.800]  think but they didn't put it in the film and and that's what the news says
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:17.680]  Bloomberg says in the LA Times says in Variety and everybody else say with no
[1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:23.880]  proof Jones claims they're building FEMA camps that Halliburton is the film
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:28.280]  shows no proof well I showed proof to them I showed them the Houston Chronicle
[1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:33.440]  and the Washington Post and the New York Times about the FEMA camps that's on
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:38.960]  record I've had congressman on about that I've had congressman on how they've
[1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:43.520]  been threatened with physical martial law but Bloomberg just says that I made
[1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:48.680]  it up that Halliburton built FEMA camps and they say I make it up that I'm
[1:13:48.680 --> 1:13:53.440]  being followed now Jones insanely sees a car driving behind him on the highway
[1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:57.120]  and thinks it's the government folks I was at Bilderberg with people following
[1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:02.760]  me as they closed it down at noon I get in our car and cars and vans follow us
[1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:07.120]  off the property and take seven eight nine ten turns follow us in the parking
[1:14:07.120 --> 1:14:14.480]  lots with you know big guys getting out we shot video of it I mean this is just
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:19.520]  another version of what they've done all these years denying that the
[1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:23.720]  Bilderberg group even existed now they have to admit it exists in all the
[1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:29.120]  mainstream news but if they just report on this film they can then say the film
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:32.400]  doesn't prove it exists and I remember I kind of got a big argument with the
[1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:37.040]  see-think people and I said you say this is objective well I don't think it's
[1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:40.440]  objective and I don't trust you because you're not even saying there's even a
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:43.520]  Bilderberg group meeting happening here this weekend this is the day before
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:47.480]  Bilderberg arrived and one of them was acting like it might not even exist and
[1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:52.600]  I said listen pal the Bilderberg group exists stop I mean this is so childlike
[1:14:52.600 --> 1:14:56.920]  that they're openly in the Time Magazine Newsweek hundreds of other major
[1:14:56.920 --> 1:15:00.920]  publications announcing world government is good you'll pay carbon taxes to
[1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:08.720]  private bankers and we have got these people denying it exists and so you
[1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:18.240]  know what I welcome the fact that scores of mainstream news publications the
[1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:21.720]  biggest in the country some of the biggest in the world New York Times
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:26.040]  Washington Post Variety Bloomberg are saying I'm crazy and none of this
[1:15:26.040 --> 1:15:33.960]  exists because people are going to watch the film The New World Order that as the
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:39.440]  LA Times said you know that I'm quote come off as charming and that we make
[1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:43.800]  some points the LA Times is the only half-fair one it still goes with the
[1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:47.760]  same angle but a little bit slicker kind of just dismisses this as people who
[1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:53.280]  mean well but are nuts people are going to read these articles they're going to
[1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:57.000]  watch the film and then they're going to Google Bilderberg and they're going to
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:00.080]  see the world leaders and the kings and queens arriving and they're going to
[1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:03.240]  read Bilderberg group documents and they're going to see everything we
[1:16:03.240 --> 1:16:07.000]  talk about unfolding and they're going to go the media lied to me again the
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:10.760]  media started again remember the history channel hit piece that I knew was a
[1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:15.480]  hit piece when they called my office I knew it was a hit piece had an argument
[1:16:15.480 --> 1:16:22.040]  with my producer about it I said no this is a hit piece and but when it came out
[1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:25.320]  they did everything they could to distort what I said everything they could
[1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:29.160]  to make me look bad it didn't matter I talked to friends I talked to family I
[1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:33.920]  talked to everybody that has woken up so many people who saw that show saw how
[1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:38.600]  one sided it was went and against us went and looked it up and became 911
[1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:43.160]  truthers because people instinctively know the mainstream media lies spins
[1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:47.920]  distorts and that's why they're allowing half decent films like New World
[1:16:47.920 --> 1:16:52.680]  Order to come out now because they've got to admit some of its real to keep any
[1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:56.720]  of their credibility I don't think the guys at see think are bad but I'm not
[1:16:56.720 --> 1:17:00.040]  stupid I know they made us look hokey I know they distorted the film in a
[1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:04.240]  stereotypical way that's fine people are going to find out who the real Alex
[1:17:04.240 --> 1:17:07.600]  Jones is they're going to find out who the real Luke Radowski is they're going
[1:17:07.600 --> 1:17:10.680]  to find out who we really are they're going to go and they're going to look
[1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:17.800]  up in game and terror storm and road to tyranny and the Obama deception so

[1:17:42.680 --> 1:17:48.040]  ago I called out Bill and Melinda Gates Warren Buffett I called out Mr. Watson
[1:17:48.040 --> 1:17:53.760]  the head of the human genome project as a Nazi a year before it came out that he
[1:17:53.760 --> 1:17:57.780]  said blacks weren't humans the guy that ran the IBM human genome the Nobel
[1:17:57.780 --> 1:18:00.680]  Prize winner for the double helix because I'd already read his writings
[1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:04.800]  saying get rid of the majority of the population he's one of the villains in
[1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:08.600]  in game and a year after this came out this came out two years ago a year

[1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:05.200]  understand the left-right paradigms a fraud a distraction a diversion this
[1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:08.960]  film is so important this cracks it all and I already knew that my film was
[1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:13.840]  right but every the film gets more important as time goes on it's more
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:18.920]  than evergreen it like it isn't just staying evergreen it it's like glowing

[1:24:30.280 --> 1:24:33.480]  Hodge for my weekly freedom nugget during that four-minute break during the
[1:24:33.480 --> 1:24:38.400]  long break we do once an hour okay I want to break down the economy I want to
[1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:43.080]  break down what's actually happening the police state and then later I'll do this
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:47.080]  at two after Kevin Trudeau leaves so I found out it's a big fan of Prison Planet
[1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:52.120]  taught TV subscriber how crazy is that we actually got contacted through their
[1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:56.960]  folks I look forward to having him on and then billionaire club in bid to curb
[1:24:56.960 --> 1:25:01.640]  overpopulation America's richest people meet to discuss ways of tackling a
[1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:06.240]  disastrous environmental social and industrial threat the group told the
[1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:11.320]  Times of London to call them the good group the good witch Linda the good
[1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:18.400]  witch but when the moon comes up they go turn into the bad witch and in this
[1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:23.040]  article it says up why the all the secrecy they wanted to speak rich to
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:27.840]  rich without worrying anything they said would end up in the newspapers painting
[1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:31.960]  them as alternative world government because see there's a world government
[1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:36.040]  there they don't want to be known as the alternative world government see they
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:39.960]  love these little flippant comments that they think the slaves won't get the
[1:25:39.960 --> 1:25:43.560]  subtlety to because they've dumbed down the language so much as Daniel Estlin was
[1:25:43.560 --> 1:25:47.880]  talking about earlier so we're gonna go over that and how it ties in with
[1:25:47.880 --> 1:25:53.920]  the meeting of America's richest ABC News lied last week and didn't tell the
[1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:57.480]  truth they said it was about helping the poor I guess killing them means
[1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:00.840]  helping them ABC News reports on secret meeting of the rich yet ignores
[1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:07.520]  Bilderberg completely the rich get tougher shh it was a secret that's out
[1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:11.760]  of the New York Times then who World Health Organization urges hospitals
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:15.600]  to join climate change battle you can't have these expensive nice hospitals
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:20.280]  it's bad for the earth literally that's Reuters Queensland fluoride overdose
[1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:25.880]  info wrong again the government put too much fluoride in the water and too much
[1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:30.320]  any of its bad and I have all these articles were John Hopkins and the
[1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:34.920]  Mayo Clinic and others report that you're 2.9 times more likely to get sick
[1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:38.800]  and die the flu or go to the hospital if you take the flu shot of course that's
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:43.280]  just the Mayo Clinic you don't listen to them so we'll be going over all of
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:49.520]  that because it's so important coming up Ron Paul joins us every four weeks he's
[1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:53.640]  scheduled to be joining us next week sometime we're we're nailing that down
[1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:59.920]  because his schedule so fluid but when he gets on it's now over 180 sponsors last
[1:26:59.920 --> 1:27:04.360]  Friday was 179 it's over 180 we're nailing down those final numbers this
[1:27:04.360 --> 1:27:08.080]  is very exciting but what's freaking me out is and it's got to be Cointel Pro
[1:27:08.080 --> 1:27:11.720]  or just the mass mental illness out there on the internet that that's what
[1:27:11.720 --> 1:27:15.080]  I was talking about and I have noticed there were hundreds and hundreds of
[1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:18.600]  comments on the article Kurt Nemo wrote Saturday guys working seven days a week
[1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:24.120]  you know because he's got such passion doesn't have to he just does and he
[1:27:24.120 --> 1:27:26.960]  wrote an article about this and I appreciate him doing that and and there
[1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:31.600]  were hundreds of comments and about half of them were saying oh this is just a
[1:27:31.600 --> 1:27:36.000]  setup to get rid of the Fed and set up a new global system oh you'll do they'll
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:41.320]  never get the audit there's no point I mean just defeatist attitude no the Fed
[1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:44.800]  doesn't want to be audited the Fed has said it's above the law and can't be
[1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:48.160]  audited which is kind of like a trick it's saying don't shoot me I'm bullet
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:51.400]  proof and you shoot the person and they're not bulletproof you know I mean
[1:27:51.400 --> 1:27:57.120]  it's a mind game or it's like somebody pouring gasoline themselves and saying I
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:01.080]  can't burn you throw a match to them they will burn I mean you know that's my
[1:28:01.080 --> 1:28:05.120]  little parable about the Federal Reserve no they don't want to be audited Ron
[1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:08.400]  Paul gets all sorts of death threats he is admitted he's in danger doing this
[1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:12.240]  Ron Paul is the real deal and he's a symbol of liberty and freedom that's
[1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:15.000]  what they try to destroy him they couldn't destroy him so now they're
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:20.100]  trying to co-opt his message and it's not working for him either they know
[1:28:20.100 --> 1:28:23.760]  we're the majority they know that we're waking up and he's he's a figurehead an
[1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:28.680]  intelligent dynamic figurehead but all of us that are prominent are figureheads
[1:28:28.680 --> 1:28:31.960]  and they're probably building him up to later try to destroy him but he's so
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:35.080]  gentlemanly and so calm and focused it's very hard for them to do though they've
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:40.720]  tried so they know that the majority of activist groups on campuses are now
[1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:47.440]  patriots slash Ron Paul slash infowars they know that we're rising and you know
[1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:50.320]  that's what Bilderberg it came out two years ago and I got confirmed this from
[1:28:50.320 --> 1:28:53.800]  Esteline and Tucker we're really worried about Paul and they're more worried
[1:28:53.800 --> 1:28:57.680]  today and they're worried about us and the state sovereignty movement so they
[1:28:57.680 --> 1:29:01.520]  spin it as states want to violently secede no we're declaring our ninth
[1:29:01.520 --> 1:29:05.760]  and tenth amendment saying the feds aren't over the states in every issue
[1:29:05.760 --> 1:29:10.360]  tenth and ninth amendment read it so they always want to radicalize things and
[1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:14.760]  and there's all these solutions but for everybody out there ladies and gentlemen
[1:29:14.760 --> 1:29:20.000]  the Federal Reserve is the regional arm of the global banking system we need to
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:24.960]  audit it and expose it go after it then the other spin is well it's already been
[1:29:24.960 --> 1:29:28.680]  audited no they passed a law to audit how many desks it has how many pencils it
[1:29:28.680 --> 1:29:32.080]  has but not the money or where the money goes or what they do with it and the
[1:29:32.080 --> 1:29:34.960]  Federal Reserve is on record in front of Congress and saying we're not going to
[1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:38.040]  tell you where the money went so anybody saying that they tell you where the money

[1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:41.440]  founded about three and a half years ago when i left my legal practice and got
[1:37:41.440 --> 1:37:46.120]  together with a group of other farmers and ranchers to create it and the idea
[1:37:46.120 --> 1:37:52.400]  is that we need a food supply that is provided by small independent farmers
[1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:57.400]  gathered all over this country rather than this huge corporate monopoly that
[1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:01.640]  we're rapidly heading toward the bar food which is a basic necessity of life
[1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:06.520]  for everybody well we have the united nations population fund meeting back in
[1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:13.280]  1996 in Beijing china and they said we will use food as a weapon and they said
[1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:16.160]  we're going to take control of the world's heirloom seeds their food
[1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:19.640]  supplies we're going to have pharmacological crops that make you take
[1:38:19.640 --> 1:38:23.760]  the vaccines every time you eat people don't know they can engineer that in the
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:28.160]  crops to grow whatever mind altering chemical or vaccine they want they're
[1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:32.160]  trying to force the world to take on gmo they're trying to make a chicken farmer
[1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:36.280]  put a twenty dollar tag on a five dollar chicken but then tyson and others are
[1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:39.920]  exempt they have group tags for every couple hundred chickens they want you
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:43.840]  to waive your rights for those that don't know with the premises id and this
[1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:48.240]  is all color of law i've also read they're buying off the farm and ranch
[1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:52.080]  groups giving a millions of dollars even local chapters to then intimidate
[1:38:52.080 --> 1:38:56.840]  their members into doing it they're arresting as publicity stunts all over
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:39:01.240]  the country at the county fair you'll have the champion pig or or horse or
[1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:06.480]  goat or steer and they do this on purpose i've read where they'll always do it
[1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:10.040]  to the person they pick as the winner then they'll say oh sorry on stage you
[1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:13.600]  don't get the blue ribbon now then they have the police take you off ground
[1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:18.800]  saying you hadn't registered your premises it's not law but it's the policy
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:23.360]  so they're creating a giant hoax that it's illegal and you've got to do this
[1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:27.160]  just like there's a hoax you've got to take vaccines judith you're the expert
[1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:29.400]  on this break it down for us
[1:39:29.400 --> 1:39:33.240]  well that thing is actually takes a lot less than that to uh... intimidate
[1:39:33.240 --> 1:39:37.400]  most people from that truth is they're giving a few hundred thousand out and
[1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:40.840]  they're kicking people out before they ever get the stage and people are far
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:44.880]  too quick to fall in line is is the sad reality
[1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:48.800]  what they're talking about is that anyone who own even one of my soccer
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:52.880]  poultry animal and this includes anybody out there wants to raise their own food
[1:39:52.880 --> 1:39:56.240]  we've been looking into the idea of having an independent food source either
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:39:57.520]  that they raise
[1:39:57.520 --> 1:39:59.480]  or that they get from their neighbors
[1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:01.320]  has to register with the government
[1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:05.320]  tag each animal in most cases using the r-f-i-d's or the microchip
[1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:08.680]  and then report their movements to the government within twenty four hours
[1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:10.200]  you're talking about something i'd put
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:13.320]  you know someone raising food under more government surveillance than the
[1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:14.520]  sex offender
[1:40:14.520 --> 1:40:17.680]  and they admit i should have started in australia as you know
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:22.000]  they're now using the homeland security nsa military satellites
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:25.760]  dialed into the land management people so folks who live in utah and other
[1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:28.080]  places or colorado where you get a rest
[1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:31.240]  by the bureaucrats on your private property that's now coming to texas
[1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:32.240]  kansas
[1:40:32.240 --> 1:40:35.880]  michigan florida it doesn't matter and we're not joking there
[1:40:35.880 --> 1:40:39.200]  they're forming swat teams in all these federal and state groups
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:42.520]  they're pulling guns on people at their own ponds fishing
[1:40:42.520 --> 1:40:44.560]  uh... there are resting on this people
[1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:48.360]  you know resting people selling eggs on street corners they've introduced bills
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:50.280]  to restrict organic farming
[1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:54.080]  uh... in tulsa oklahoma they're talking about making it a license to have a
[1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:55.220]  home garden
[1:40:55.220 --> 1:40:59.120]  that was in the tulsa news i mean you cannot
[1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:03.440]  a strong enough picture of of of of how evil
[1:41:03.440 --> 1:41:07.680]  and insidious all of this is i hope the listeners understand this is coming
[1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:10.360]  down like a ton of bricks right now
[1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:13.720]  it's it's getting beat back i mean these are plans that they've been working on
[1:41:13.720 --> 1:41:15.360]  for literally decade
[1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:19.400]  you know it's not new it's not because mad cow disease or apian flu or swine
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:23.200]  flu you know depending on who you talk to they come up with a new reason
[1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:25.600]  uh... these plans have been around for decade
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:28.680]  but they're really gathering steam now and there are a lot of folks in
[1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:29.560]  congress
[1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:31.680]  who are bound and determined
[1:41:31.680 --> 1:41:33.680]  to show this down our throat
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:37.360]  and they're working very hard to create this image of a panic
[1:41:37.360 --> 1:41:41.960]  which is if we don't have this people be dying at a recent congressional hearing
[1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:45.040]  one of the chairman of the subcommittee with literally saying that you know if
[1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:46.600]  we can't practice better
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:50.600]  people be dying when the food but then the far and food is exempt
[1:41:50.600 --> 1:41:54.440]  the far and food is exempt so if people think we've already seen an exodus
[1:41:54.440 --> 1:41:57.240]  of u.s. produced food we've gone for producing ninety eight percent of our
[1:41:57.240 --> 1:41:58.120]  food to what
[1:41:58.120 --> 1:41:59.280]  half of it now
[1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:00.560]  and it's going down
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:03.440]  and i think i should add and i'm rude jude thomigh gary is executive
[1:42:03.440 --> 1:42:04.300]  director
[1:42:04.300 --> 1:42:08.080]  of the uh... farm and ranch freedom alliances an attorney and small farmer

[1:42:13.320 --> 1:42:17.000]  uh... and after a clerk ship with the fifth circuit court appeals she
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:18.360]  practices an attorney
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:20.480]  doing a combination of administrative law
[1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:25.360]  at litigation appeal so i should add you're an expert on all this as well
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:29.640]  well at the thing is you know the real expertise comes from handling animals
[1:42:29.640 --> 1:42:33.080]  the real expertise are you know it comes from the day-to-day
[1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:36.400]  knowing what it takes to raise food knowing what it takes to keep animals
[1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:37.560]  healthy
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:41.040]  and what's amazing to me about this program and about
[1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:44.200]  the mentality in the mindset of of the people pushing it
[1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:46.040]  if it's attitude that somehow
[1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:48.840]  folks who are locked in office who wouldn't know one end of the cow from
[1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:49.960]  the other
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:53.840]  somehow can come up with the technological answer that falls everything
[1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:56.960]  and take care of animal health while the farmers and ranchers obviously don't
[1:42:56.960 --> 1:42:57.880]  know anything
[1:42:57.880 --> 1:42:59.760]  you know according to these guys
[1:42:59.760 --> 1:43:02.240]  well let me let me just throw a point out here and i want to give you the
[1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:03.560]  floor and have you break down
[1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:06.680]  how far along this is how we fight it how we
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:08.040]  ago against it
[1:43:08.040 --> 1:43:12.000]  we have a large piece of property we got in eighteen twenty nine is a Mexican
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:13.960]  land grant in east texas
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:16.600]  and i don't even really dear hunting more because i don't have the time don't
[1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:17.560]  have to dress it
[1:43:17.560 --> 1:43:18.520]  deal with it
[1:43:18.520 --> 1:43:21.520]  but every time i'm out with a telescope at night
[1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:24.200]  in the front yard of grandma's old house
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:25.520]  once a year
[1:43:25.520 --> 1:43:28.680]  you know trying to look at saturn
[1:43:28.680 --> 1:43:32.000]  rolling up without lights as a game warden they jump out their rude to you
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:33.320]  they boss your around
[1:43:33.320 --> 1:43:36.000]  and i was a little kid out there you'd see him every once in a while they were
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:36.960]  polite
[1:43:36.960 --> 1:43:40.040]  now they treat you like your piece of filth as a landowner
[1:43:40.040 --> 1:43:42.680]  now they're popping up everywhere harassing people
[1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:46.120]  and they're getting federal training now to get a hunting or fishing license
[1:43:46.120 --> 1:43:49.440]  they run your background they run your driver's license everything's a
[1:43:49.440 --> 1:43:51.080]  tracking control grid
[1:43:51.080 --> 1:43:55.200]  this is going to put federally controlled local bureaucrats
[1:43:55.200 --> 1:44:00.680]  in to your farm checking things without a warrant with game warden type powers
[1:44:00.680 --> 1:44:04.000]  no more fourth amendment walking on
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:07.760]  saying i want to see all your cows counted right now
[1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:10.920]  two thousand dollar fines and correct me but i'm going from memory i know you're
[1:44:10.920 --> 1:44:13.120]  a lawyer an expert on this
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:16.160]  a cow got struck by lightning and you didn't report it to him or you sold a
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:20.400]  cattle a neighbor or a cow got out and got hit by a car i mean this is guilty
[1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:21.800]  until proven innocent
[1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:25.680]  tyranny over all rural communities
[1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:29.280]  absolutely that the specific signs vary from state to state because they're
[1:44:29.280 --> 1:44:31.800]  talking about implementing it by state statute
[1:44:31.800 --> 1:44:35.920]  here in texas it's a thousand dollars per day would be the maximum fine
[1:44:35.920 --> 1:44:39.680]  uh... in wisconsin they're currently prosecuting almas farmers
[1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:42.160]  charging them a five thousand dollars
[1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:43.800]  for not registering their property
[1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:46.720]  that varies from state to state but either way it's bad news i mean what
[1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:49.600]  what they're even forcing me on this one thousand
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:52.960]  they're even twenty thousand they're even forcing the almasian okay break down
[1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:53.920]  this hard
[1:44:53.920 --> 1:44:57.560]  how bad it is this affects everybody who's rural and everybody lives in the
[1:44:57.560 --> 1:44:59.440]  cities this is literal
[1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:03.560]  stalin did this in ukraine kicking people off the land and controlling it i mean
[1:45:03.560 --> 1:45:05.960]  china does this this is hard core
[1:45:05.960 --> 1:45:09.920]  poll pot did this i mean this is hard core go ahead
[1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:12.560]  well i think it is what it in practical terms
[1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:13.680]  it means that
[1:45:13.680 --> 1:45:15.920]  almost no one will be able to raise
[1:45:15.920 --> 1:45:17.280]  food animal
[1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:21.200]  uh... the big corporations will be able to they get group identification
[1:45:21.200 --> 1:45:24.200]  uh... actually for thousands of animal they could they can take one of the
[1:45:24.200 --> 1:45:29.480]  future of the chicken farms that has been a ten thousand or twenty thousand birds
[1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:31.880]  crammed into a building and give it one i d number
[1:45:31.880 --> 1:45:33.080]  uh... and yet
[1:45:33.080 --> 1:45:37.480]  small farmers or anyone trying to raise any kind of food animal or
[1:45:37.480 --> 1:45:42.160]  half to individually tag each animal that's what we see cities passing laws
[1:45:42.160 --> 1:45:47.040]  making you tag your animals like sam marcus i mean this is so diabolical
[1:45:47.040 --> 1:45:51.280]  and openly big companies like archer daniels medlin and tyson lobbied
[1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:55.200]  knowing this is going to shut down the family farm it's over
[1:45:55.200 --> 1:45:58.520]  absolutely i think i think that it deep in that
[1:45:58.520 --> 1:46:02.320]  uh... all of the big corporations have a little bit they claim it could be in
[1:46:02.320 --> 1:46:05.680]  they they pretend that they're providing a food when the reality is the small
[1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:08.640]  farmers who you want for your food they could apply
[1:46:08.640 --> 1:46:12.560]  and what i believe that it's so expensive because you're trying electronic
[1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:15.960]  and i think that all the infrastructure that comes with it
[1:46:15.960 --> 1:46:19.640]  standards and computers and internet and readers and
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:21.720]  everything else that comes with it
[1:46:21.720 --> 1:46:25.920]  uh... and keep in mind blasted that said that forty eight percent of farmers
[1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:28.360]  don't even have any internet
[1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:32.360]  so can you imagine having chickens in a game warden type punk
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:35.080]  in a uniform with their higher nothing but the socialist
[1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:36.720]  and phony environmentalist
[1:46:36.720 --> 1:46:40.760]  carbon showing up in literally cornering you you got five chickens right here
[1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:42.040]  you're going to jail or
[1:46:42.040 --> 1:46:44.000]  you know here's a twenty thousand dollar fine
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.800]  the week this is already happening
[1:46:46.800 --> 1:46:50.800]  uh... uh... ma'am i'm sorry go ahead just makes me so angry
[1:46:50.800 --> 1:46:54.480]  it should make it a bit to make all that they have to sort of learn not to
[1:46:54.480 --> 1:46:57.440]  go crazy over it because otherwise i'd have been locked up about three years
[1:46:57.440 --> 1:46:58.400]  ago
[1:46:58.400 --> 1:47:00.480]  i'm gonna beat them keep going
[1:47:00.480 --> 1:47:01.840]  we have to beat them
[1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:04.000]  because the reality is
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:05.560]  if you can't afford
[1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:07.320]  to raise a food animal
[1:47:07.320 --> 1:47:08.800]  then you stop raising them
[1:47:08.800 --> 1:47:12.240]  and the reality for a lot of people then if they'd lose their land because if you
[1:47:12.240 --> 1:47:16.120]  can't if you aren't in ag business you lose your ag valuation on the land
[1:47:16.120 --> 1:47:18.040]  and you can afford property factor
[1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:21.200]  which which if you don't know i was looking at a piece of property
[1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:22.720]  and and
[1:47:22.720 --> 1:47:26.080]  if it already has an ag exemption you can go to environmental
[1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:28.280]  you know uh... uh... you know preserve
[1:47:28.280 --> 1:47:31.200]  but once you get land and go to environmental
[1:47:31.200 --> 1:47:33.600]  you can't ever go back or
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:38.240]  and and they admit they don't want people farming there they're paying people
[1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:40.600]  to not farm go ahead
[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:44.040]  and so what we'll end up with is a lot of people losing their land
[1:47:44.040 --> 1:47:47.720]  even more even if they find another option like the environmental exemptions
[1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:49.880]  or in environmental valuation
[1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:52.880]  many people stopping raising animals for food
[1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:57.280]  and your only option start becoming the tyson and the car bill
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:47:58.920]  will have a food supply
[1:47:58.920 --> 1:48:02.680]  that is already far too controlled by these companies that will be entirely
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:05.160]  controlled by these companies unbelievable and
[1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:09.240]  you know at a minimum what we're talking about it increase cost lower quality
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:11.280]  the sort of things you find in any monopoly
[1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:13.520]  that's the best case scenario
[1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:17.280]  i don't know how it goes downhill from there because food is what you need to
[1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:18.400]  survive
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:20.960]  and we don't want to have to be dependent on
[1:48:20.960 --> 1:48:23.280]  multinational corporation
[1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:25.280]  for basic necessity of life
[1:48:25.280 --> 1:48:28.960]  and then they can force you to buy their gmail products
[1:48:28.960 --> 1:48:31.640]  and i'm sure you've seen accompanying this your lawyer
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:33.840]  the bill they've got introduced to
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:37.760]  basically crackdown and and restrict organic farming
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:40.720]  i mean i mean that this is getting wild
[1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:44.560]  they're actually that they think they're about six bills in congress right now
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:47.000]  all under the heading of food safety
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:48.840]  and all of them contain
[1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:52.400]  provisions for what called like that management practices
[1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:53.560]  or um...
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:48:56.560]  best scientific risk analysis different terms
[1:48:56.560 --> 1:48:58.660]  but they basically go down to
[1:48:58.660 --> 1:49:03.200]  the agency's telling people how to farm yet turning the hordes of control
[1:49:03.200 --> 1:49:04.160]  freak
[1:49:04.160 --> 1:49:06.680]  uh... carbon footprint eugenicist
[1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:08.040]  loose on the people
[1:49:08.040 --> 1:49:11.680]  what is the war map look like right now how bad is it
[1:49:11.680 --> 1:49:16.480]  are i i i know we're having victories and defeats how do we defeat them
[1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:19.880]  well right now there's a big opening because u s d a is holding listening
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:22.000]  sessions all around the country
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:25.560]  and i'm not holding my breath that u s d a is actually what they did back up
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:27.160]  you know i bet they are
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:31.160]  but the point is if we get huge crowd fair and overwhelmingly at meeting after
[1:49:31.160 --> 1:49:32.880]  meeting after meeting
[1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:35.880]  people there say we don't want this
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:39.320]  that that we get we hope to get mainstream press attention
[1:49:39.320 --> 1:49:42.560]  start reaching out to the con congress putting pressure on them
[1:49:42.560 --> 1:49:45.600]  but even if what you know whether u s d a is listening or not is almost irrelevant
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:48.040]  what we need is we need crowd these meetings
[1:49:48.040 --> 1:49:50.880]  and i was listening to dary brownfield this morning and he said he's gone to
[1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:52.480]  meetings and talk to people that are adam
[1:49:52.480 --> 1:49:55.120]  he said you'll have five hundred people against this but
[1:49:55.120 --> 1:49:56.720]  five or six people for it
[1:49:56.720 --> 1:49:59.400]  and they're all the local farm bureau heads
[1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:02.320]  who openly have gotten money from the feds and others
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:05.080]  literally like twenty pieces of silver
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:08.440]  all absolutely at the tech that last week we had the listening session here in
[1:50:08.440 --> 1:50:09.400]  texas
[1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:12.640]  huge crowd person after person after person
[1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:16.440]  from every walk of life including people who have technological background
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:18.320]  to understand the technology
[1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:22.640]  standing up and saying don't do that it's a bad program we don't want it
[1:50:22.640 --> 1:50:25.960]  and then the handle people who spoke for it were the texas
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:27.720]  very many association
[1:50:27.720 --> 1:50:28.520]  who's parent
[1:50:28.520 --> 1:50:30.680]  whose parent organization have gotten money
[1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:32.000]  the park producers
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:35.680]  parent organization have gotten money and that was about it
[1:50:35.680 --> 1:50:36.880]  you know
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:40.160]  yeah well these are big monopoly men the dairy folks want a monopoly so they
[1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:41.920]  want to shut down small dairies
[1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:45.560]  the pork people want to shut down the small operators folks this is do or die
[1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:47.960]  these are offshore corporations coming in
[1:50:47.960 --> 1:50:51.600]  and turning hard core control freaks loose on you

[1:54:19.240 --> 1:54:23.280]  badges and their guns and bug their eyes out at you and i'm not against people
[1:54:23.280 --> 1:54:26.560]  along here in ponytails it's just that i've seen a lot they show up they're
[1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:31.120]  real they're looking everything you got and they want your land all over the
[1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:33.960]  country we've got the phony environmentalists moving into farms and
[1:54:33.960 --> 1:54:37.480]  ranches they steal and harass or they'll claim you got pot on your property and
[1:54:37.480 --> 1:54:41.720]  come in and shoot you that's been a lot of famous cases of that and you're
[1:54:41.720 --> 1:54:45.920]  saying well i'm not like that i'm a good cop well whatever it's on record what's
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:50.760]  going on and it's just like the sheriff of nottingham it's the it's feudalism
[1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:53.720]  it's serfdom got it for about another 10 minutes the kevins her does coming up
[1:54:53.720 --> 1:54:59.320]  we really appreciate her and i gotta get judith amigurion for full hour because
[1:54:59.320 --> 1:55:02.480]  i get so mad about what's happening i keep interrupting the thing and this is
[1:55:02.480 --> 1:55:05.480]  happening and that's happening and she could talk for an hour on each point i'm
[1:55:05.480 --> 1:55:09.920]  making she's such an expert on this is such a great lady but give out the
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:13.120]  website for folks that want to find out more tell them what else is happening
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:20.280]  how how we fight this where it's going our website is farm and ranch freedom
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:25.920]  dot org that's farm and ranch freedom dot org and there's a section on take
[1:55:25.920 --> 1:55:29.280]  action and if you aren't going to read anything else on there go straight to
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:33.960]  that section you can download flyers you can download you know frequently ask
[1:55:33.960 --> 1:55:38.080]  questions you can do all sorts of stuff because the key is getting the word out
[1:55:38.080 --> 1:55:42.240]  i mean the problem we've got is when you go to these meetings or you go to
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:47.360]  county fair or any place 90% of the people you talk to are against it but
[1:55:47.360 --> 1:55:51.880]  also you've got a lot of places and fifty or sixty or seventy percent of
[1:55:51.880 --> 1:55:55.400]  people have never even heard about it and certainly when you go into the
[1:55:55.400 --> 1:55:59.840]  city it's even fewer people who've heard about it and that's our problem the
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:04.240]  problem is they can push things through based on you know feel-good soundbites
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:08.840]  but this is a food safety program things like that and people don't know any
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:14.320]  better and so education and reaching out to people is where we we really need
[1:56:14.320 --> 1:56:18.120]  help well you know what's killing our communities is is not just all this
[1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:21.760]  far and bad food coming in that has no standards and then all our food has
[1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:25.720]  higher and higher standards and every time foreign food causes a health
[1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:29.560]  problem they try to blame it on domestic this is clearly a globalist model as
[1:56:29.560 --> 1:56:33.720]  you know but all the rural areas have got satellite dishes they're watching TV
[1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:38.760]  they're not down you know at the coffee shop talking they're not involved they
[1:56:38.760 --> 1:56:42.280]  have disconnected and they're gonna lose their communities if they don't get
[1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:46.640]  fired up and involved right now absolutely and I think there's a lot of
[1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:50.920]  pessimism in the rural communities I think they feel a lot of the rural
[1:56:50.920 --> 1:56:54.800]  communities feel that there's no point that they no longer have a voice in the
[1:56:54.800 --> 1:56:59.560]  government because they're so outnumbered by the cities and so they've given up a
[1:56:59.560 --> 1:57:02.580]  lot of folks you know even if they stay on their farms even if they're still
[1:57:02.580 --> 1:57:06.680]  trying to keep their farm together in terms of activism in terms of physics
[1:57:06.680 --> 1:57:10.760]  involvement they've thrown up their hands and we've got to get the city folks
[1:57:10.760 --> 1:57:14.600]  involved this is about a food supply how did the land of the free home of the
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:18.960]  brave turn into a bunch of cowards that just roll over on their backs with their
[1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:23.840]  belly facing up towards the buzzards I mean I'm challenging people in the city
[1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:28.720]  in the rural areas all of you to educate yourselves on this seminal key issue
[1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:33.040]  and to get aggressive and kick some new world order but this is outrageous what
[1:57:33.040 --> 1:57:37.600]  they're trying you're saying get the cities involved how do we do that we
[1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:41.760]  need letters to the editor we need people to hit the local farmers markets we
[1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:46.360]  need people to hit co-ops we people go to health food stores I mean any place you
[1:57:46.360 --> 1:57:50.040]  can think of where people are a little bit away you know just a little bit
[1:57:50.040 --> 1:57:55.280]  paying attention to their food to their health to these kinds of issues that's
[1:57:55.280 --> 1:58:00.400]  an opening take it point out to them okay you care about food then you better
[1:58:00.400 --> 1:58:03.320]  start paying attention because you're not going to have these options anymore
[1:58:03.320 --> 1:58:06.560]  you're not going to have the local farmers you're not going to have the
[1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:12.880]  organics and the GMO free if we don't do something to stop the corporate takeover
[1:58:12.880 --> 1:58:16.120]  of our food supply do five more minutes with us we're gonna have you back in the
[1:58:16.120 --> 1:58:19.280]  near future we'll get out the website again for folks on the other side and

[2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:36.440]  the feds planting species all over the U.S. that aren't endangered I mean this
[2:00:36.440 --> 2:00:39.560]  is a criminal group who wants your property criminals run the government
[2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:45.280]  Judith McGeary she is just a great lady we've got her on with this farm and
[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:50.520]  ranchfreedom.org she's the executive director very honored to have her this
[2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:53.640]  is the premier group you need to get involved need to financially support them
[2:00:53.640 --> 2:00:58.760]  need to get up off your butts I mean our tens of thousands of years of heritage
[2:00:58.760 --> 2:01:02.200]  as farmers and ranchers is being destroyed and this affects everybody
[2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:06.120]  this is a paramilitary takeover of our society just like they're doing in
[2:01:06.120 --> 2:01:10.640]  Africa like you're doing in Europe you can't put up with this crap all right
[2:01:10.640 --> 2:01:15.520]  Judith you got four minutes I'm gonna sit back and shut up if I can call the
[2:01:15.520 --> 2:01:20.320]  arms I'm calling people out what does a good old boy who is in East Texas
[2:01:20.320 --> 2:01:25.040]  listening right now or a guy running a vineyard in Northern California or a
[2:01:25.040 --> 2:01:30.560]  chicken farm in Oregon what do they do right now to fight this first step like
[2:01:30.560 --> 2:01:34.440]  I said is educate your community and let me say by the way actually I'm gonna do
[2:01:34.440 --> 2:01:37.560]  a call to action of my own so I've talked to quite a few folks who I know are
[2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:42.560]  your listeners who are also listeners of yours and I hear things like yeah it's
[2:01:42.560 --> 2:01:47.320]  terrible and I'm gonna go hide someplace and raise my own food folks that's not
[2:01:47.320 --> 2:01:51.160]  the answer because guess what by the time they finish rounding up everybody else
[2:01:51.160 --> 2:01:55.640]  they've driven all of the existing farmers out of business and you can't buy
[2:01:55.640 --> 2:01:58.880]  things at the feed store and you can't get a vet to come out to your property
[2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:03.240]  without this and everything else you're not going to be able to hide from it and
[2:02:03.240 --> 2:02:06.760]  I was actually very frustrated at the Austin meeting because a couple of
[2:02:06.760 --> 2:02:11.160]  people dodged coming because they didn't want to put their name down on record
[2:02:11.160 --> 2:02:16.440]  and we need to get past that we really need people to stand up and be willing
[2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:20.160]  to on record because they're gonna come for me and they're gonna come for Alex
[2:02:20.160 --> 2:02:22.680]  and they're gonna come for a lot of other people long before they ever come
[2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:26.840]  for you so you know get your name on record and be willing to stand they
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:31.520]  have special units the feds pay for in rural areas for radicals at organic
[2:02:31.520 --> 2:02:35.600]  farm and don't want to follow orders I mean this this is happening we got to
[2:02:35.600 --> 2:02:40.760]  all stand up now we're all gonna hang separate absolutely so having having
[2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:44.080]  done that and gotten it off my chest first step is educating your community
[2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:48.680]  go to the coffee houses and talk to folks go to hang out at the feed store put
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:53.000]  flyers up at the sales barn in the in the cities hit the health food stores in
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:58.240]  the co-op get the word out then what you do is you like USDA it's holding these
[2:02:58.240 --> 2:03:02.480]  listening sessions if there's one near you go to it we've got those listed on
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:06.840]  our website if you really can't make it in person you can still submit comments
[2:03:06.840 --> 2:03:10.880]  written comments they go on the record and send a copy to your congressman your
[2:03:10.880 --> 2:03:14.400]  state legislators your county commissioners you know it's one set of
[2:03:14.400 --> 2:03:17.760]  comments it doesn't take you very heavily farmers should put up one to ten
[2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:22.520]  watt micro FM's that go out a few miles and put Genesis programming on or do
[2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:26.040]  their own shows we need to get aggressive and create our own media as
[2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:29.680]  well how about a little local newspaper how about farmers make their own little
[2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:33.640]  a newsletter and take your material and others and get it out each week
[2:03:33.640 --> 2:03:38.760]  that's a fantastic idea that that would be wonderful and you know what a lot of
[2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:42.720]  local newspapers will print stuff that you provide because they're so short
[2:03:42.720 --> 2:03:46.200]  that that unless they're completely controlled you know if it's actually a
[2:03:46.200 --> 2:03:51.240]  small local one a lot of times if you go in with an article they'll print it so
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:54.480]  you know start feeding them that information and I love those ideas
[2:03:54.480 --> 2:03:58.560]  yeah we were doing that with the toll roads and in the toll road company bought
[2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:02.760]  over a hundred Texas newspapers on the corridors to shut that down showing the
[2:04:02.760 --> 2:04:07.320]  power so folks if you take action decide to kick butt nothing can stop you
[2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:13.360]  Judith McGeary farm and ranch freedom dot org executive director in the last
[2:04:13.360 --> 2:04:20.720]  45 seconds other key points this is our food supply it is there are no other
[2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:27.000]  options there's no no way around this the only way to protect our ability to
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:34.320]  eat and to have a choice in what we eat is by taking this on God bless you I
[2:04:34.320 --> 2:04:37.840]  want to get you up for a full hour and anybody else you recommend maybe some of
[2:04:37.840 --> 2:04:41.560]  the farmers and people being arrested for selling eggs on street corners or
[2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:44.920]  watermelons being arrested we've had some of them on I mean this is tyranny
[2:04:44.920 --> 2:04:48.520]  folks this is the opposite of freedom and it's being done for control Judith
[2:04:48.520 --> 2:04:52.000]  McGeary will talk to you again soon God bless you and the key work you're doing

[2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:02.520]  things you've done
[2:10:02.520 --> 2:10:06.120]  and then now how they're coming against you and all of our free speech
[2:10:06.120 --> 2:10:10.360]  well my book now have sold over fifty million copies my biggest book was
[2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:12.880]  natural cures they don't want you to know about
[2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:16.280]  that was number one in the new york times best settler list twenty six weeks in
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:17.040]  a row
[2:10:17.040 --> 2:10:20.880]  it actually was the number one selling book in america it beat harry potter
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:22.840]  and that's never been done in history
[2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:25.280]  especially the non-fiction book
[2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:28.560]  about that but way back when in nineteen eighty nine
[2:10:28.560 --> 2:10:31.200]  i went on tv as you mentioned earlier
[2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:34.640]  with the program called mega memory i found in the american memory institute
[2:10:34.640 --> 2:10:37.280]  which became the largest memory training school world
[2:10:37.280 --> 2:10:40.200]  and i was teaching children how to improve the memory so they could do
[2:10:40.200 --> 2:10:41.640]  better in school
[2:10:41.640 --> 2:10:43.920]  and a guy named shawn shanahan had a
[2:10:43.920 --> 2:10:47.280]  uh... a reading program called hooked on phonics
[2:10:47.280 --> 2:10:50.960]  because he was upset that they were taking the department of education was
[2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:53.440]  taking the phonics out of the school
[2:10:53.440 --> 2:10:55.520]  coming down our kids
[2:10:55.520 --> 2:10:58.600]  so he was teaching to have a read by teaching on the phonics which they
[2:10:58.600 --> 2:10:59.560]  should have been
[2:10:59.560 --> 2:11:00.880]  caught in the school
[2:11:00.880 --> 2:11:04.040]  i was teaching a memory training so they could remember more information
[2:11:04.040 --> 2:11:06.440]  to have a higher self-esteem and do better
[2:11:06.440 --> 2:11:09.800]  and i exposed at the department of education
[2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:11.440]  but a mandate out
[2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:17.600]  the school system saying the more kids you get on riddling the a d d drug
[2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:18.600]  you're going to be
[2:11:18.600 --> 2:11:22.920]  benefited financially will pay you five hundred dollars for every child you get
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:24.000]  on riddling
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:27.280]  so the school system started drugging the kids
[2:11:27.280 --> 2:11:30.040]  basically making them brain day
[2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:33.360]  dead and putting them on psychotic drug
[2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:37.720]  they were taking on it out of school coming them down to their illiterate
[2:11:37.720 --> 2:11:39.120]  and i was
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:41.040]  exposing this
[2:11:41.040 --> 2:11:42.240]  guess what happened
[2:11:42.240 --> 2:11:45.400]  i got sued by the federal trade commission
[2:11:45.400 --> 2:11:49.540]  false and misleading advertising even though
[2:11:49.540 --> 2:11:54.120]  of the four hundred million dollars worth of memory courses that i sold
[2:11:54.120 --> 2:11:56.240]  there were no complaints
[2:11:56.240 --> 2:11:57.400]  and i had
[2:11:57.400 --> 2:12:01.280]  federal judges i had politicians bought the program that was great
[2:12:01.280 --> 2:12:02.560]  but the ftc
[2:12:02.560 --> 2:12:04.680]  was mandated
[2:12:04.680 --> 2:12:09.240]  to shut me up they are by the way kevin i've uh... kevin i bought your system
[2:12:09.240 --> 2:12:11.640]  when i was in the junior higher high school
[2:12:11.640 --> 2:12:14.200]  and i already had a great memory certainly improve what i was doing
[2:12:14.200 --> 2:12:16.220]  it's a free country i'm allowed
[2:12:16.220 --> 2:12:19.400]  to buy your product even if it's crap which by the way it's not that's why
[2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:20.660]  you're so successful
[2:12:20.660 --> 2:12:22.520]  as because you do so a lot of great stuff
[2:12:22.520 --> 2:12:26.440]  that's my right and now they're even going after sherry owes
[2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:30.160]  saying it'll lower your cholesterol you know a diet rich in this i mean that i
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:32.000]  mean this is really a tyranny
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:36.600]  it really is depression of the free flow of information because
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:38.760]  if people bought let's say
[2:12:38.760 --> 2:12:40.280]  my program mega memory
[2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:44.520]  you know the food shawnt shanahan with hooked on foreign and bankrupted the guy
[2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:46.520]  luckily i had the funding
[2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:51.240]  the fight back not uh... you might my company's over the last few years have
[2:12:51.240 --> 2:12:54.560]  been around three billion in sales i've been very lucky to have the financial
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:56.600]  backing to say no
[2:12:56.600 --> 2:12:58.320]  you're not going to win
[2:12:58.320 --> 2:13:01.600]  now i will talk about the fact that i just got find thirty seven million
[2:13:01.600 --> 2:13:02.680]  dollars
[2:13:02.680 --> 2:13:06.160]  which i'm fighting in the appeals court luckily that didn't break me it's not
[2:13:06.160 --> 2:13:07.880]  going to change my lifestyle
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:11.760]  but i am of course fighting that in the appeals court the bottom line is that
[2:13:11.760 --> 2:13:13.480]  the federal government
[2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:15.720]  wants to suppress
[2:13:15.720 --> 2:13:20.680]  the free for all the information and they do it by intimidation and scaring
[2:13:20.680 --> 2:13:23.040]  people to keep them quiet
[2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:27.280]  they don't want people to know the truth about natural cure they don't want to
[2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:30.800]  know the truth about the dangers of psychotic drugs they don't want to know
[2:13:30.800 --> 2:13:34.120]  the truth about what's happening with the money supply they don't want to know
[2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:37.720]  the truth about the fact that the food supply in america
[2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:40.080]  so depleted of nutritional value
[2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:43.000]  i'll tell people i mean you're right now
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:46.920]  i know what an apple tastes like i know what a cucumber tastes like i know what
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:48.240]  a carrot tastes like
[2:13:48.240 --> 2:13:49.720]  if you're living in america
[2:13:49.720 --> 2:13:53.660]  you don't know what those things taste like anymore because of the
[2:13:53.660 --> 2:13:56.680]  the depletion of the soil in u.s
[2:13:56.680 --> 2:13:59.840]  is beyond comprehension you'd have to eat
[2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:03.080]  dr manuel charaskan said this fifteen years ago
[2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:05.740]  he said you'd have to eat five times as much food
[2:14:05.740 --> 2:14:08.440]  to get the same nutritional value
[2:14:08.440 --> 2:14:10.640]  then your grandparents did
[2:14:10.640 --> 2:14:13.920]  twenty thirty years ago you know kevin turdo i was just talking to the head of
[2:14:13.920 --> 2:14:16.220]  a farm and ranch organization last hour
[2:14:16.220 --> 2:14:19.240]  the feds are openly saying they're gonna shut down most the family farms and
[2:14:19.240 --> 2:14:20.080]  ranches
[2:14:20.080 --> 2:14:23.920]  and the big agribusiness their exempt from all this they wrote it
[2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:26.760]  and you know how dare you were somebody else put out a book or a video
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:28.720]  exposing them i guess the feds will just
[2:14:28.720 --> 2:14:31.600]  sue you now we were talking during the break
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:32.920]  can you specifically
[2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:36.800]  tell the listeners what you told me that in this court case they're saying and
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:40.240]  now in other court cases that there is no first amendment and that they're
[2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:44.240]  trying to set the precedent to a literally fine or arrest people they
[2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:45.320]  don't like
[2:14:45.320 --> 2:14:46.060]  right
[2:14:46.060 --> 2:14:49.120]  five years the federal trade commission had a doctrine
[2:14:49.120 --> 2:14:51.960]  called the mirror image doctrine and what it said is
[2:14:51.960 --> 2:14:53.120]  any person
[2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:55.400]  can write a book about anything
[2:14:55.400 --> 2:14:59.640]  and that person can then talk about it and express their opinions
[2:14:59.640 --> 2:15:02.560]  and if they do that the federal trade commission won't
[2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:04.720]  go after them
[2:15:04.720 --> 2:15:06.760]  also misleading advertising
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:10.160]  because of my book my most recent book was called
[2:15:10.160 --> 2:15:12.120]  the weight loss cure
[2:15:12.120 --> 2:15:13.960]  they don't want you to know about
[2:15:13.960 --> 2:15:15.960]  where i uh... exposed
[2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:19.880]  a cure for obesity that was discovered in nineteen fifty nine by doctor
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:22.000]  simian the british md
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:24.880]  and it has been suppressed all these years
[2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:25.920]  and i wrote the book
[2:15:25.920 --> 2:15:27.440]  sold millions of copies
[2:15:27.440 --> 2:15:30.720]  hundreds of thousands americans did the program thought to be easy
[2:15:30.720 --> 2:15:33.000]  and virtually a cure for obesity
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:35.160]  you lose the weight and never comes back
[2:15:35.160 --> 2:15:38.440]  because simian's found the cause of obesity
[2:15:38.440 --> 2:15:40.680]  well what i wrote this book
[2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:42.080]  i said in the book
[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:46.040]  that the federal trade commission in the fda is designed to protect the
[2:15:46.040 --> 2:15:48.760]  profits of the major corporate corporations
[2:15:48.760 --> 2:15:53.080]  they're protecting lap pan surgery gastric bypass surgery and that this
[2:15:53.080 --> 2:15:56.000]  most horrible drug called ally
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:59.920]  which is just yet to wear diapers if you take it because you crap your pants
[2:15:59.920 --> 2:16:01.640]  and if you take it
[2:16:01.640 --> 2:16:03.360]  you'll lose four pounds
[2:16:03.360 --> 2:16:04.840]  every six months
[2:16:04.840 --> 2:16:06.920]  it doesn't even do anything for weight loss
[2:16:06.920 --> 2:16:10.120]  but the company's the drug companies are making billions
[2:16:10.120 --> 2:16:11.760]  when i wrote this book
[2:16:11.760 --> 2:16:13.480]  it was so popular
[2:16:13.480 --> 2:16:15.600]  that the drug companies
[2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:17.840]  the fbc to sue me
[2:16:17.840 --> 2:16:22.200]  and the fbc said we are canceling our mirror image doctrine
[2:16:22.200 --> 2:16:23.560]  we now
[2:16:23.560 --> 2:16:27.600]  are saying that it's our legal right as a as a federal agency
[2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:30.840]  to attack authors if we don't like
[2:16:30.840 --> 2:16:33.080]  what they write in their books
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:34.480]  and authors who
[2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:36.160]  save their opinions
[2:16:36.160 --> 2:16:38.600]  can be sued by the government
[2:16:38.600 --> 2:16:40.240]  today
[2:16:40.240 --> 2:16:41.480]  stating that
[2:16:41.480 --> 2:16:45.160]  my opinions in my book
[2:16:45.160 --> 2:16:46.320]  we're wrong
[2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:47.880]  they didn't like my book
[2:16:47.880 --> 2:16:49.520]  will take our one shift
[2:16:49.520 --> 2:16:52.400]  or one shift wrote a book saying the iris is a fraud
[2:16:52.400 --> 2:16:55.840]  a collection agency for the private file reserve which is true
[2:16:55.840 --> 2:16:58.560]  but regardless of it was a lie he still has a right to write it
[2:16:58.560 --> 2:17:02.240]  the judge told him don't issue that book anymore don't print anymore
[2:17:02.240 --> 2:17:06.000]  he did they arrested him tried him he's in prison
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:08.240]  for the book and you know they're telling
[2:17:08.240 --> 2:17:11.080]  the makers of the hillary movie they're not allowed to put that out
[2:17:11.080 --> 2:17:13.760]  they've a as i said earlier they've introduced bills
[2:17:13.760 --> 2:17:15.920]  to restrict free speech i mean
[2:17:15.920 --> 2:17:20.680]  they are really scared of what people are saying and doing right now
[2:17:20.680 --> 2:17:24.080]  or they wouldn't be moving like this against the first amendment
[2:17:24.080 --> 2:17:26.720]  i think they've bitten off more than they can shoot i think this is going to
[2:17:26.720 --> 2:17:27.960]  blow up in their face
[2:17:27.960 --> 2:17:30.560]  you know the new freedom initiatives internal documents came out in two
[2:17:30.560 --> 2:17:31.800]  thousand and six
[2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:36.520]  as i'm sure you know saying the plan by the fda in the schools
[2:17:36.520 --> 2:17:41.000]  uh... is to get half the kids on riddling in prozac classes of drugs
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:42.880]  up from fifteen percent
[2:17:42.880 --> 2:17:46.080]  and that it is all just a business operation that they were given campaign
[2:17:46.080 --> 2:17:47.120]  money to do it
[2:17:47.120 --> 2:17:51.100]  now that was released by one of the board members made the news not big news
[2:17:51.100 --> 2:17:55.480]  there is the evidence of criminal activity it's okay to push deadly drugs on
[2:17:55.480 --> 2:17:59.440]  kids but you don't dare tell on the cheerios might be good for him
[2:17:59.440 --> 2:18:03.920]  correct correct and the point of people listening need to understand
[2:18:03.920 --> 2:18:04.680]  is that
[2:18:04.680 --> 2:18:06.840]  the federal government specifically
[2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:10.040]  agencies like the federal trade commission and the food and drug
[2:18:10.040 --> 2:18:11.000]  administration
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:12.560]  these agencies are not
[2:18:12.560 --> 2:18:13.780]  protecting
[2:18:13.780 --> 2:18:15.640]  united states citizens
[2:18:15.640 --> 2:18:19.240]  these agencies are protecting the profits
[2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:21.040]  of the corporation
[2:18:21.040 --> 2:18:24.240]  that donate the most money to the political campaign
[2:18:24.240 --> 2:18:27.520]  that's the fact that here's a perfect example about this
[2:18:27.520 --> 2:18:30.640]  the the ftc the federal trade commission
[2:18:30.640 --> 2:18:31.680]  routinely
[2:18:31.680 --> 2:18:35.760]  sus companies for false and misleading advertising
[2:18:35.760 --> 2:18:37.860]  if you look at the last five years
[2:18:37.860 --> 2:18:38.880]  they've sued
[2:18:38.880 --> 2:18:41.040]  small independent companies
[2:18:41.040 --> 2:18:44.040]  and they always have the same m o they go into court
[2:18:44.040 --> 2:18:46.380]  they never call the company in advance
[2:18:46.380 --> 2:18:49.920]  they rush in the court secretly and demand that the judge
[2:18:49.920 --> 2:18:52.200]  freeze all
[2:18:52.200 --> 2:18:54.680]  and corporate assets of the company
[2:18:54.680 --> 2:18:58.120]  which the judge grants ninety nine percent of the cop time so now they
[2:18:58.120 --> 2:19:00.040]  don't have money to defend themselves
[2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:01.520]  bankrupting the company
[2:19:01.520 --> 2:19:03.360]  okay that's number one
[2:19:03.360 --> 2:19:05.360]  now when they did that to me
[2:19:05.360 --> 2:19:08.520]  i was the first person with a judge didn't freeze the assets and even if
[2:19:08.520 --> 2:19:11.680]  they did corporate and personal they can only freeze u.s. assets and because they
[2:19:11.680 --> 2:19:12.720]  have companies
[2:19:12.720 --> 2:19:15.840]  in sixty countries around the u.s. uh... the around the world
[2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:19.600]  uh... we but we had a defense team lined up from all over the globe
[2:19:19.600 --> 2:19:21.640]  to handle the case
[2:19:21.640 --> 2:19:24.080]  but the ftc in the fda
[2:19:24.080 --> 2:19:25.520]  have never
[2:19:25.520 --> 2:19:26.280]  sued
[2:19:26.280 --> 2:19:29.840]  a drug company for false and misleading advertising
[2:19:29.840 --> 2:19:34.600]  they don't sue them even though the fb a itself has said repeatedly that
[2:19:34.600 --> 2:19:36.520]  advertising for drugs
[2:19:36.520 --> 2:19:39.480]  is blatantly false and misleading
[2:19:39.480 --> 2:19:42.880]  because it makes people believe the drugs are more effective than they are
[2:19:42.880 --> 2:19:46.240]  and paper than they are all you had to be kind of hold on uh... said we got a
[2:19:46.240 --> 2:19:46.880]  break
[2:19:46.880 --> 2:19:49.880]  yeah they have drug ads where they don't even say what the drug does is just as
[2:19:49.880 --> 2:19:51.080]  after doctor
[2:19:51.080 --> 2:19:53.680]  and you find the drug makes you have a heart attack and i'm
[2:19:53.680 --> 2:19:57.120]  crazy zombies run out and buy it but kevin true though he's bad

[2:24:11.480 --> 2:24:16.000]  talking to him again during the break I'll ask that question on air what are
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:19.360]  you doing over in Germany right now Kevin Trudeau well I've been here for a
[2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:23.240]  couple months my friend is the Crown Prince in Bahrain and invited me to the
[2:24:23.240 --> 2:24:27.400]  formula one so I kind of started the trip there and of course Builderburg is in
[2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:32.200]  Greece I have friends who are part of that organization the global climate
[2:24:32.200 --> 2:24:35.400]  change summit is going on Copenhagen so I had a shoot up there to meet some
[2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:38.360]  people and find out what what the real scoop is behind the scenes that you're
[2:24:38.360 --> 2:24:43.320]  not hearing about on the news the formula was in Monte Carlo which is always a
[2:24:43.320 --> 2:24:47.120]  good fun of course and and a lot of people come to the film festival in
[2:24:47.120 --> 2:24:51.120]  Cannes so during this time of year I like to be in Europe because I can meet a lot
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:54.600]  of people get a lot of background information a lot of behind the scenes
[2:24:54.600 --> 2:24:58.480]  inside information I'll tell you what some of the conversations you have on the
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:06.400]  200 foot yachts off the coast of Monaco you can't believe what really goes on
[2:25:06.400 --> 2:25:12.040]  behind closed doors and I did what you're exposing Alex I'm a big fan of your
[2:25:12.040 --> 2:25:16.080]  documentary work you know watch endgame years ago when it first came out the
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:20.400]  Obama deception of people have to watch that they need to watch that both of
[2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:24.880]  those documentaries to really understand what's going on and the fact is
[2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:32.880]  people are being misled and once you know once you have your eyes open now
[2:25:32.880 --> 2:25:36.880]  you're empowered and you can do things that you need to do to make your life
[2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:40.880]  better and protect your financial future for you and your family and the
[2:25:40.880 --> 2:25:44.280]  establishment when they had all the media sewed up and you're really the
[2:25:44.280 --> 2:25:47.920]  pioneer of alternative media I can't think of anybody who before the internet
[2:25:47.920 --> 2:25:51.960]  age had gone out there gotten his alternative ideas out and been
[2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:55.680]  successful in the marketplace of ideas and they want to cheat with a rigged
[2:25:55.680 --> 2:26:00.560]  table here and not allow your information to come out and everybody else's
[2:26:00.560 --> 2:26:06.000]  information to come out that just reeks of defeat by the establishment can you
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:10.840]  comment on that and then I've got a pump you for info you say you know folks in
[2:26:10.840 --> 2:26:15.280]  Bilderberg tell us about that yeah I'll give you a lot of information I happen
[2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:19.000]  to have a lot of insight connections all around the world also in Malaysia and
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:22.800]  China and many many of these people are members of royal families which which
[2:26:22.800 --> 2:26:25.960]  there's a reason why I know a lot of these people I've just been very
[2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:30.720]  fortunate over the years to make these connections and have these contexts but
[2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:36.920]  when I was on that with Matt Lauer I was on the Today Show it was live and that
[2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:41.280]  thought he was gonna blast me because of my book Natural Cures and the first
[2:26:41.280 --> 2:26:45.480]  question he said is you know you're not a doctor what qualifies you to write the
[2:26:45.480 --> 2:26:49.800]  book Natural Cures and I says Matt you're one of your good friends is
[2:26:49.800 --> 2:26:54.520]  Donald Trump he just filed bankruptcy three times what qualified him to write
[2:26:54.520 --> 2:26:58.520]  a book on how to be a successful businessman and it was complete
[2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:02.040]  silence and I didn't know what to say the rest of the interview went very very
[2:27:02.040 --> 2:27:07.320]  well and I really had good comebacks from that well right after that interview I
[2:27:07.320 --> 2:27:13.360]  was immediately canceled on Larry King and the senior and Larry King called me
[2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:18.120]  he said Kevin I'm really sorry but they said that you can do politics on because
[2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:22.600]  she can edit you but they don't want you live anymore you just afraid of what
[2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:26.480]  you're gonna say I've been told the same thing about myself by a lot of
[2:27:26.480 --> 2:27:29.840]  producers they'll set me up then it gets canceled they say we're only allowed to
[2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:34.640]  do tape with you I guess because they've got to have a rigged stack deck again
[2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:38.200]  yeah again people don't understand the information you're getting on them in
[2:27:38.200 --> 2:27:41.680]  the major media and you said this the people are actors they're reading a
[2:27:41.680 --> 2:27:45.720]  teleprompter I'm with Donnie Deutsch and donnie says hey I'm sorry I'm so happy
[2:27:45.720 --> 2:27:50.000]  when I was on NBC by the way he said no Katie Korks a big fan you know you get
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:54.280]  you gotta make sure you give her a signed book I signed probably 50 books for
[2:27:54.280 --> 2:27:59.880]  people there but he said but on television we have a certain agenda we
[2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:05.240]  have to promote and this is what people don't realize I was on Fox with Bill
[2:28:05.240 --> 2:28:09.840]  O'Reilly and Judge the Parliament they tell you in advance we promote we are
[2:28:09.840 --> 2:28:15.080]  told we have to take this viewpoint and the information people are getting from
[2:28:15.080 --> 2:28:24.520]  the mainstream media is so skewed I would tell everyone stop watching the news on
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:32.920]  television just shut it up you are being brainwashed beyond belief listen to Alex's
[2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:40.720]  show go to infowars.com presentplanet.com and.tv get the information from the
[2:28:40.720 --> 2:28:46.360]  alternative sources that don't have the filters you're getting truthful
[2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:51.240]  information here and with the truthful information with your eyes open you can
[2:28:51.240 --> 2:28:55.640]  make intelligent decisions and you do better in your life. We're talking to
[2:28:55.640 --> 2:29:01.920]  Kevin Trudeau the king of what would you call it alternative news and

[2:33:00.040 --> 2:33:02.360]  today
[2:33:05.040 --> 2:33:12.280]  well Kevin Trudeau needs no introduction and I've seen a lot of his books read
[2:33:12.280 --> 2:33:17.840]  several of them you know got his a mega memory thing decades ago and just found
[2:33:17.840 --> 2:33:21.800]  it all be really great info but even if it was all a bunch of baloney he has a
[2:33:21.800 --> 2:33:26.880]  right to sell it to write it to say it but it is because he's exposing Ritalin
[2:33:26.880 --> 2:33:30.640]  first and exposing the credit card companies first I mean first in a big
[2:33:30.640 --> 2:33:34.720]  way he's the guy everybody imitates that's why they're going after the big
[2:33:34.720 --> 2:33:39.360]  daddy the big kahuna and that's why even if you don't like Kevin Trudeau most
[2:33:39.360 --> 2:33:43.440]  people I know loving you need to support him because we all hang together as the
[2:33:43.440 --> 2:33:46.560]  founding fathers said or we hang separate now I'm intrigued by Bilderberg
[2:33:46.560 --> 2:33:51.960]  Michael Trudeau because Daniel Estlund he has several people he knows in
[2:33:51.960 --> 2:33:56.120]  Bilderberg people he calls attendees not members and I know he's not making it up
[2:33:56.120 --> 2:34:02.240]  because this I have some other inside sources and I believe Daniel Danny but
[2:34:02.240 --> 2:34:06.520]  he talks about how a lot of them don't like what's going on it's about 25 people
[2:34:06.520 --> 2:34:09.720]  at the very top of that that are steering it but they're networking as a
[2:34:09.720 --> 2:34:13.200]  latest and so you're saying you know some Bilderberg group people but then you
[2:34:13.200 --> 2:34:18.200]  mentioned to me George Soros quite a stinker there who's bragged he's having
[2:34:18.200 --> 2:34:23.080]  a quote a great crisis so so I mean if the New World Order this global system
[2:34:23.080 --> 2:34:26.600]  from your research you know as a multi-multi-millionaire internationally
[2:34:26.600 --> 2:34:30.880]  known who does jet set around talking to all these people you know who is the
[2:34:30.880 --> 2:34:34.640]  New World Order where are they going what's their main goal and any inside
[2:34:34.640 --> 2:34:39.040]  info from Bilderberg 2009 well but yeah the specific goals when you sit down
[2:34:39.040 --> 2:34:43.760]  with these people and I've traveled the world with these guys you know they
[2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:48.800]  really I would say they're not you know they're not Dr. Evil they're not sitting
[2:34:48.800 --> 2:34:53.520]  there planning on wiping out the population in a weird way they think
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:59.600]  what they're doing is is for the best for everyone but they do categorically
[2:34:59.600 --> 2:35:04.320]  believe there's two classes of people on planet earth there is the ruling elite
[2:35:04.320 --> 2:35:09.320]  class and they do believe in you know Henry Ford talked about this Andrew
[2:35:09.320 --> 2:35:12.000]  Carnegie at the turn of the century talked about this and throughout history
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:17.600]  they do believe that through genes and DNA even Donald Trump has said it over
[2:35:17.600 --> 2:35:20.280]  and over again you have to have good genes otherwise you're not going to make
[2:35:20.280 --> 2:35:25.240]  any money they believe it's genetic and so they believe there's two classes of
[2:35:25.240 --> 2:35:29.440]  people that there's a ruling class by genetics that are powerful enough and
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:34.560]  genetically designed to rule the other people that are nothing more than the
[2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:39.160]  worker bees that's really what they believe now writer I mean I'm telling
[2:35:39.160 --> 2:35:42.400]  that that's where they're at but now because they have robotics is Bill
[2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:47.400]  Joy head of Sun Microsystem said in the April 2000 issue of Wired the future
[2:35:47.400 --> 2:35:50.720]  doesn't need us the elite want to get rid of us now I know with you they're not
[2:35:50.720 --> 2:35:54.280]  going to come out and say hey we want to wipe everybody out but I have ABC news
[2:35:54.280 --> 2:35:59.640]  here and times of London billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation oh
[2:35:59.640 --> 2:36:05.880]  absolutely absolutely and I've been sitting on the boats up the coast of
[2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:12.800]  Barbados with the guys who basically said we need to get two-thirds of the
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:18.760]  dumb people off the planet I mean I've been in the meetings and it wasn't in an
[2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:24.840]  evil way it's a matter of fact kind of way that they think it's for the
[2:36:24.840 --> 2:36:28.840]  benefit of planet Earth and themselves oh yeah they're committed there I mean
[2:36:28.840 --> 2:36:33.520]  they they've said this is bad genetics they're passing it on they're lazy I've
[2:36:33.520 --> 2:36:36.920]  here's my next question and after you finish what you're about to say it's
[2:36:36.920 --> 2:36:41.400]  just so intriguing this this conversation we're having is blowing me away and I
[2:36:41.400 --> 2:36:44.680]  always have done this you know as a quote journalist they say this is off
[2:36:44.680 --> 2:36:49.120]  record people know I don't ever break off the record meetings I've met with major
[2:36:49.120 --> 2:36:55.320]  CEOs biggest Hollywood people there are you know just huge and they go Alex you
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:36:59.200]  try to warn them and look some listen most don't they want to be slaves they
[2:36:59.200 --> 2:37:03.400]  want to die you know join us you're smart you're good you know that's the sales
[2:37:03.400 --> 2:37:08.320]  pitch is that the slaves don't want to be free but if that was the case they
[2:37:08.320 --> 2:37:13.120]  wouldn't be trying to keep you and me from reaching the people so it's an
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:17.360]  overall fraud but but I've had them you know at petty level I'm not like a
[2:37:17.360 --> 2:37:20.680]  multi-billionaire like you there's so much more successful telling the truth
[2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:25.000]  but I've had them offer me millions of dollars and promise more if I'd sell out
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:29.720]  so so so a finish up with their mindset and then be have they tried to buy you
[2:37:29.720 --> 2:37:37.440]  off well they're not concerned quite frankly so much with spreading the word
[2:37:37.440 --> 2:37:42.760]  because as you just said their belief is no one's gonna listen anyway so who
[2:37:42.760 --> 2:37:48.440]  cares it's like you know you're more of an annoyance than anything but actually
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:53.240]  they believe that what you're doing and what I'm doing is in a way to their
[2:37:53.240 --> 2:37:59.520]  benefit because we're desensitizing people yes reality yes and so they're
[2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:04.280]  so I've been told that's why that's why I still get invited on the yacht I've
[2:38:04.280 --> 2:38:09.800]  been told that too and you know wow unbelievable I but in terms of economics
[2:38:09.800 --> 2:38:12.800]  you know I mentioned you have to break that I was talking to George Soros he
[2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:15.760]  said you know we're making we're and I know about this in fact inside
[2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:20.280]  information as well we're making more money now because of the crisis then
[2:38:20.280 --> 2:38:26.000]  then you would imagine I mean we had bank short stocks shorted huge in the fall
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:30.280]  before they all crashed 90% I mean the fortune we made just shorting the bank
[2:38:30.280 --> 2:38:35.040]  stocks was was off the charts I mean that was the simplest goofiest thing in the
[2:38:35.040 --> 2:38:40.160]  world when I wrote my book debt cures almost three years ago I was the first
[2:38:40.160 --> 2:38:46.400]  guy on national TV to say look everyone's a moron this this consumer
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:50.880]  lending is gonna explode the housing market's gonna crash foreclosure is
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:55.640]  gonna go through the roof and what at Bilderberg we talked about is that the
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:38:59.760]  fact that the media is so stupid you don't even have to do anything to the
[2:38:59.760 --> 2:39:07.320]  guys on CNBC or MSNBC they're so stupid 75% of Americans in the next two to five
[2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:12.880]  years are gonna lose their job and get a reduction in pay or go from full-time to
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:18.840]  part-time the tax it's a designed it's a designed changing our standard of
[2:39:18.840 --> 2:39:22.840]  living in the new world order Kevin did I hear you correctly were you were you at
[2:39:22.840 --> 2:39:27.480]  Bilderberg yeah I was in Greece and because I have friends who were there
[2:39:27.480 --> 2:39:30.440]  I'm right now by the way you're not gonna believe we're a man I mean
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:34.600]  Rottach Egan Germany which is where Bilderberg had their meeting a few years
[2:39:34.600 --> 2:39:39.600]  ago at the same hotel this Sea Hotel uber fart so you're hanging out with a
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:44.720]  crown prince and you're telling me you were in a capillary sub meeting of
[2:39:44.720 --> 2:39:48.560]  Bilderberg is I know they have those or or well I know you're not supposed to
[2:39:48.560 --> 2:39:52.480]  say you're just letting me know you were in the area all I can say I was in the
[2:39:52.480 --> 2:39:59.080]  area and many of the people there and our members are in fact people that I
[2:39:59.080 --> 2:40:02.480]  converse with on a regular basis now I noticed that big palace with three
[2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:06.000]  hotels they shut down was right off the bay with all the yachts yeah I guess you
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:11.080]  were back and forth the yachts are great what about yeah I know what's on them
[2:40:11.080 --> 2:40:19.600]  even better huh here's the funny thing and people listening all people if you
[2:40:19.600 --> 2:40:26.240]  know the the inside scoop of things making money is the easiest thing in the
[2:40:26.240 --> 2:40:29.760]  world to do that's why guys like so I mean the economic downturn doesn't
[2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:34.040]  affect people at the highest levels exactly let me tell you a short story
[2:40:34.040 --> 2:40:38.080]  this is incredible interview I met my in-laws yesterday for you know a
[2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:43.440]  memorial day you know eat and lunch and I explained to him about gold and silver
[2:40:43.440 --> 2:40:47.080]  trading and about the business and I said all you do is basically the
[2:40:47.080 --> 2:40:51.200]  opposite of what the mainstream media says to do when I was telling them six
[2:40:51.200 --> 2:40:55.120]  years ago at that table I said buy gold and silver silver's at $5 golds at
[2:40:55.120 --> 2:40:58.480]  300 it's gonna go up the next five six years to close to a thousand or higher
[2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:02.560]  and they go no we remember you telling us that but but but still they won't
[2:41:02.560 --> 2:41:06.080]  listen and I mean that's what's so frustrating is the is that that's why
[2:41:06.080 --> 2:41:10.720]  it's such a joke to the elite you can even tell the public the media is lying
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:14.120]  to them they don't want to believe it you know they don't believe it it's
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:18.240]  really comical but let me give you asked earlier about the groups both
[2:41:18.240 --> 2:41:24.340]  Bilderberg council on foreign relations and a bunch of other groups is in in
[2:41:24.340 --> 2:41:29.680]  these circles I would suggest to you that there are two factions a small
[2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:34.640]  faction and a big faction the big faction categorically believes that they
[2:41:34.640 --> 2:41:39.400]  are genetically superior than the rest of the population but there is a small
[2:41:39.400 --> 2:41:43.880]  faction and this faction is are the ones that are feeding me information
[2:41:43.880 --> 2:41:48.840]  probably Daniel Estolin information and so forth this small faction are people
[2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:54.320]  that really have come to the conclusion that no no yeah some people are smarter
[2:41:54.320 --> 2:41:58.000]  than others some people are more talented than others some people are more
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:02.520]  you know motivated to work hard than others some people are lazy some people
[2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:08.920]  aren't but everyone should be allowed to succeed or fail based on their own
[2:42:08.920 --> 2:42:13.840]  choices and initiative there shouldn't be two classes there always will be
[2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:18.760]  but everybody should have the same opportunity and that's where there's a
[2:42:18.760 --> 2:42:23.160]  split and a division right now at the highest levels now I've been told that
[2:42:23.160 --> 2:42:27.200]  it's mainly the younger crowd and by that kind of like the Google CEOs and
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:31.120]  people who are elitist but they say come on we don't have to wipe everybody out
[2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:34.480]  and and and let's give people a chance and then there's kind of the old
[2:42:34.480 --> 2:42:39.760]  Rockefeller faction that is I'm 94 launch the operation immediately yeah
[2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:42.800]  and I'll tell you the reason why you're a hundred percent correct there if you
[2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:47.840]  look at the older crowd they married only within themselves in that crowd if
[2:42:47.840 --> 2:42:51.480]  you remember you watched the movie titanic you know you had the first class
[2:42:51.480 --> 2:42:57.640]  cabin and the people who are on the first class deck never mingled ever you
[2:42:57.640 --> 2:43:02.840]  didn't shake hands with somebody who wasn't first class and so it throughout
[2:43:02.840 --> 2:43:07.800]  history you married and you socialize only with people who are of the same
[2:43:07.800 --> 2:43:15.240]  quote genetic or DNA structure now there is a lot more mingling of classes and
[2:43:15.240 --> 2:43:19.800]  therefore you get the Google guys or Michael Dell's people that aren't that
[2:43:19.800 --> 2:43:23.960]  that were born on the opposite side of the tracks but are making some serious
[2:43:23.960 --> 2:43:29.520]  money and they're not quote the right DNA they're not the right genetics to the
[2:43:29.520 --> 2:43:33.600]  older crowd like their the Rockefellers and so forth and so that's where you
[2:43:33.600 --> 2:43:36.480]  have the division and that's where you have to split this very interesting time
[2:43:36.480 --> 2:43:40.120]  because some of these conversations and I've and I've you know been in these
[2:43:40.120 --> 2:43:45.520]  conversations are really thought-provoking and intriguing conversations
[2:43:45.520 --> 2:43:50.920]  I believe that look if you have a thousand people give everybody the same
[2:43:50.920 --> 2:43:54.920]  chance everybody the same information because guess what the smart ones who
[2:43:54.920 --> 2:43:58.800]  really want to work hard will succeed more than the other people but everybody
[2:43:58.800 --> 2:44:03.280]  showed the same opportunity well again we're talking to Kevin Trudeau just
[2:44:03.280 --> 2:44:10.040]  amazing interview here very very excited to have you on the show dealing
[2:44:10.040 --> 2:44:15.560]  with Bilderberg any other information that came out anything else you can
[2:44:15.560 --> 2:44:19.960]  tell us that you weren't you know told to be secret about it well I think what
[2:44:19.960 --> 2:44:24.640]  people really need to understand is in America for the next two to five years
[2:44:24.640 --> 2:44:28.440]  here's what's going to happen number one is going to be an increased number of
[2:44:28.440 --> 2:44:32.400]  people losing their jobs going from full-apart time or getting a reduction in
[2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:36.400]  pay so 75% of the people in the next two to five years are going to have less
[2:44:36.400 --> 2:44:42.280]  money coming in taxes and fees are going to go up so more money is going out
[2:44:42.280 --> 2:44:48.760]  okay there is going to be a level of inflation that's going to be controlled
[2:44:48.760 --> 2:44:53.600]  by the Fed but there is going to be some type of inflation it's undecided
[2:44:53.600 --> 2:44:57.280]  whether they want the inflation to be so rampant with the US dollar no longer
[2:44:57.280 --> 2:45:02.560]  becomes the uh... uh... the uh... the monetary supply of the world is the
[2:45:02.560 --> 2:45:07.440]  reserve currency that's still being debated because quite frankly china
[2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:11.960]  wants their dollar to be the reserve reserve currency in this keep on
[2:45:11.960 --> 2:45:15.720]  Bilderberg is only north america and europe
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:19.320]  and there's a bit of a group in a different faction in southeast asia
[2:45:19.320 --> 2:45:21.360]  and i've been down there it
[2:45:21.360 --> 2:45:25.080]  there at all it's a very good for the arabs mainly allied with europe in the
[2:45:25.080 --> 2:45:28.800]  u.s. the arabs are allied with themselves
[2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:33.320]  they're a hundred percent and i think i just was there in beret
[2:45:33.320 --> 2:45:37.320]  basically they're themselves it's oil they know they got about fifty years
[2:45:37.320 --> 2:45:38.080]  left
[2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:40.360]  so the diversifying in the banking
[2:45:40.360 --> 2:45:43.840]  you know you said on the show ability to build up so many times
[2:45:43.840 --> 2:45:46.600]  the first number one way to control the planet
[2:45:46.600 --> 2:45:49.080]  or control everything is control the money
[2:45:49.080 --> 2:45:50.760]  and that's control the bank
[2:45:50.760 --> 2:45:52.360]  but that's always number one
[2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:56.440]  the other factor there's another factor that was discussed at the meeting in
[2:45:56.440 --> 2:45:57.280]  gree
[2:45:57.280 --> 2:45:59.600]  and that is something that no one's talking about
[2:45:59.600 --> 2:46:03.040]  and me and a buddy of mine knew about this four years ago and we've been
[2:46:03.040 --> 2:46:05.800]  really heavily invested in this
[2:46:05.800 --> 2:46:07.240]  water
[2:46:07.240 --> 2:46:08.040]  all yeah
[2:46:08.040 --> 2:46:12.200]  i mean you notice uh... european other companies will pay ten fifteen times
[2:46:12.200 --> 2:46:16.680]  what reservoirs in in aquifers are worth they are grabbing it all up aren't they
[2:46:16.680 --> 2:46:20.640]  yes water is the next oil
[2:46:20.640 --> 2:46:24.840]  because if you control the water supply and water flows
[2:46:24.840 --> 2:46:28.040]  you have even more control than you do with oil
[2:46:28.040 --> 2:46:30.120]  well here's an example boom pickings
[2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:32.840]  doesn't want to put air
[2:46:32.840 --> 2:46:33.880]  systems
[2:46:33.880 --> 2:46:37.920]  uh... the uh... the uh... the windmills
[2:46:37.920 --> 2:46:40.320]  up in the panhandle of texas
[2:46:40.320 --> 2:46:45.200]  to actually create energy because the lines have to be run so far that that you
[2:46:45.200 --> 2:46:49.080]  lose the power to the lines so if you do the equations it's not going to make
[2:46:49.080 --> 2:46:51.960]  money it's not going to supply any power
[2:46:51.960 --> 2:46:53.880]  uh... with the wind energy but
[2:46:53.880 --> 2:46:58.440]  the biggest aquifer in the u.s. is right there and if you read the deals he signed
[2:46:58.440 --> 2:47:02.720]  it's really all about getting control of that ocean of water
[2:47:02.720 --> 2:47:04.720]  it's as big as the state of texas
[2:47:04.720 --> 2:47:10.120]  correct and it is very interesting you know the the the last james bond movie
[2:47:10.120 --> 2:47:14.000]  was all about this great wonderful quote environmentalist
[2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:16.440]  who in fact was the evil
[2:47:16.440 --> 2:47:20.440]  the uh... the the evil villain trying to control the water i think it was
[2:47:20.440 --> 2:47:22.440]  bolivia or something in the movie
[2:47:22.440 --> 2:47:24.520]  but believe me when you watch movies
[2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:26.720]  hollywood is used
[2:47:26.720 --> 2:47:30.880]  categorically this has been uh... documented throughout history
[2:47:30.880 --> 2:47:33.480]  as the way to
[2:47:33.480 --> 2:47:37.560]  begin to be sensitize people to different concepts
[2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:43.400]  if you remember back in the old days a guy would be at a firing squad
[2:47:43.400 --> 2:47:45.840]  and they would say in the black and white movie
[2:47:45.840 --> 2:47:48.240]  they would say do you have any last request
[2:47:48.240 --> 2:47:50.680]  yeah i want to figure it
[2:47:50.680 --> 2:47:51.320]  wait a minute
[2:47:51.320 --> 2:47:54.600]  i figure it is your last request
[2:47:54.600 --> 2:47:57.440]  that was programming product placement for a cigarette
[2:47:57.440 --> 2:47:59.440]  of course i think okay
[2:47:59.440 --> 2:48:00.240]  alex
[2:48:00.240 --> 2:48:03.960]  what's your last request it's probably not going to be a well what do you want
[2:48:03.960 --> 2:48:07.440]  after what do you want after sex on all the movies they want a cigarette
[2:48:07.440 --> 2:48:11.400]  that's like ever bernice was paid to say bacon had to go with eggs in the
[2:48:11.400 --> 2:48:13.320]  morning nobody ate bacon
[2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:17.720]  it was kind of like a junk thing used for cooking in stews but now i think
[2:48:17.720 --> 2:48:19.360]  they can't come back
[2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:21.320]  coming back is from the great
[2:48:21.320 --> 2:48:23.320]  kids that they threw away
[2:48:23.320 --> 2:48:27.360]  exactly so they they create markets they create markets
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:28.800]  you know kevin judo
[2:48:28.800 --> 2:48:31.280]  so you're so so you're hanging out with belterberg
[2:48:31.280 --> 2:48:32.520]  uh...
[2:48:32.520 --> 2:48:34.640]  so who's coming after you here in the states
[2:48:34.640 --> 2:48:37.600]  the bigger a special interest the drug companies
[2:48:37.600 --> 2:48:39.320]  that don't want you exposing them
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:42.120]  yeah well when it when i wrote the book natural cure they don't want to know
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:45.520]  but i was the first guy to say something which is heresy
[2:48:45.520 --> 2:48:47.160]  i think drug companies
[2:48:47.160 --> 2:48:49.560]  don't want to cure disease
[2:48:49.560 --> 2:48:52.040]  all they want to do is tell drug
[2:48:52.040 --> 2:48:55.080]  drug companies are publicly traded corporations
[2:48:55.080 --> 2:48:59.240]  who the offices and directors have a legal responsibility of you do she
[2:48:59.240 --> 2:49:02.600]  are illegal responsibility to increase shareholder value
[2:49:02.600 --> 2:49:06.960]  if drug if a drug companies goal was to eliminate all the things that'll be
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:08.520]  bankrupt
[2:49:08.520 --> 2:49:10.160]  and i pointed that out
[2:49:10.160 --> 2:49:13.600]  and i pointed that out that they're publicly traded companies they have to
[2:49:13.600 --> 2:49:15.120]  increase
[2:49:15.120 --> 2:49:17.520]  drug usage per person
[2:49:17.520 --> 2:49:20.560]  they want more people taking more drugs on a regular basis
[2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:23.040]  do not want to cure disease
[2:49:23.040 --> 2:49:26.360]  and when i said that i was attacked by everybody
[2:49:26.360 --> 2:49:29.520]  and that actually attacks actually help make the book
[2:49:29.520 --> 2:49:33.440]  you know right now that particular book is sold over twenty five million copy
[2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:34.760]  and hardcover
[2:49:34.760 --> 2:49:37.520]  yes of the attacks are actually helping you know i called you michael for
[2:49:37.520 --> 2:49:40.200]  dough earlier because we have a sales manager at the network named michael
[2:49:40.200 --> 2:49:40.800]  for dough

[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:48.640]  you know you are something else now now I haven't read all your books I remember
[2:54:48.640 --> 2:54:52.480]  listeners sent me a mailing you did about one of your books about how you got
[2:54:52.480 --> 2:54:55.800]  recruited into the brotherhood didn't know it was a sellout at first but got
[2:54:55.800 --> 2:54:58.880]  out of it so you're somebody that was in the group out of the group and people
[2:54:58.880 --> 2:55:01.880]  don't believe this but I mean your guy that makes billions a year they better
[2:55:01.880 --> 2:55:06.480]  I have been approached by these groups to and then people just can't believe it
[2:55:06.480 --> 2:55:10.520]  because they're living in La La Land we're living in the real world Kevin but
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:17.040]  yeah it it's hard for the average person to grasp this and here's here's what I
[2:55:17.040 --> 2:55:22.760]  think it's hard to everyone listening it's hard for you to grasp this when you
[2:55:22.760 --> 2:55:29.960]  the number one motivator of the average person is money now some people say
[2:55:29.960 --> 2:55:34.400]  sex that's true but it's generally money so money is the number one
[2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:38.440]  motivated you look in prison today ninety percent of the people in jail are
[2:55:38.440 --> 2:55:41.920]  there because of the money related crime they were trying to sell drugs they
[2:55:41.920 --> 2:55:46.200]  robbed the bank they mug somebody you don't thank for it why for it it's all
[2:55:46.200 --> 2:55:49.960]  about wanting money illegally that's why people are in jail the number one
[2:55:49.960 --> 2:55:55.040]  motivator money okay most people grasp that but when you talk about the elite
[2:55:55.040 --> 2:55:59.880]  class and you say they want control they want this the general consensus from the
[2:55:59.880 --> 2:56:03.920]  average guy in the street is that doesn't make any sense to me they have all the
[2:56:03.920 --> 2:56:08.120]  money in the world why would they do this and this is what nobody can
[2:56:08.120 --> 2:56:13.080]  understand because you don't have all the money in the world when you have all
[2:56:13.080 --> 2:56:18.200]  the money you need or want the motivation that is power will power
[2:56:18.200 --> 2:56:23.760]  brings money power brings sex brings it all right but power supersedes the
[2:56:23.760 --> 2:56:28.920]  motivation for money it's power and control which is why somebody who becomes
[2:56:28.920 --> 2:56:32.200]  incredibly wealthy guess what they want to do next I want to get into politics
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:36.080]  they want to start controlling things so it's about control and there's another
[2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:40.880]  thing that happens at the top level and that's weird sexual deviations
[2:56:40.880 --> 2:56:46.720]  no people need some type of stimulation and again I physically have been around
[2:56:46.720 --> 2:56:51.840]  groups and I've seen things that you had the amazing experience of going to
[2:56:51.840 --> 2:56:57.880]  bohemian growth I saw your video so I mean you were there right absolutely and
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:02.120]  that's what strange is that go back to the Romans of the Aztecs they're always a
[2:57:02.120 --> 2:57:06.280]  bunch of wild perverts correct so you were physically there you had an
[2:57:06.280 --> 2:57:10.280]  experience and nobody could really grasp you saw it with your own eyes and I
[2:57:10.280 --> 2:57:14.120]  watched that DVD that you did that documentary was extremely well done in a
[2:57:14.120 --> 2:57:19.480]  deep group you know just an insight that people don't have a maybe have a hard
[2:57:19.480 --> 2:57:23.560]  time grasping and I was only there for four hours and hiding out the vanity
[2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:27.200]  fair guy got in and got arrested but not before he's he admitted oh yeah the
[2:57:27.200 --> 2:57:30.840]  Christian conservatives are having homosexual orgies but he says oh it's
[2:57:30.840 --> 2:57:35.280]  no big deal the point is is every time somebody claims they're a conservative
[2:57:35.280 --> 2:57:40.000]  it's actually the opposite I don't know it's just so bizarre how weird these
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:45.680]  people are well it's very strange and I think that people listening need to know
[2:57:45.680 --> 2:57:52.800]  I think it from an economic standpoint we have this huge tsunami coming the
[2:57:52.800 --> 2:57:58.280]  huge hurricane it is going to hit people are going to be affected forget what
[2:57:58.280 --> 2:58:02.400]  you listen to on the news it's going to get economically worse taxes are going
[2:58:02.400 --> 2:58:06.360]  up your income is going down fees are going up there will be inflation to
[2:58:06.360 --> 2:58:10.960]  some degree there will be inflation what about revolution when we come back I
[2:58:10.960 --> 2:58:15.320]  mean people are gonna rebel as they raise taxes like my property taxes gone

[3:01:06.800 --> 3:01:10.560]  Perdot's folks saying can they use this interview absolutely they can take the
[3:01:10.560 --> 3:01:14.520]  video of this interview the audio of it use it however they want again
[3:01:14.520 --> 3:01:17.960]  flatter okay Kevin I've been asking a lot of the questions and there's so many
[3:01:17.960 --> 3:01:21.080]  other questions I've got but in the short segment we got one more coming up
[3:01:21.080 --> 3:01:24.840]  anything else you haven't covered that people should know about or that's
[3:01:24.840 --> 3:01:28.800]  coming over the horizon that people aren't aware of yet with all your inside
[3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:32.840]  knowledge and what are you most focused on right now in the future well for 15
[3:01:32.840 --> 3:01:37.440]  years Builderburg again Builderburg is just one group it's North America and
[3:01:37.440 --> 3:01:42.560]  in Europe and there's others about four others around the globe that also work
[3:01:42.560 --> 3:01:48.440]  together and they are working together as a group the bottom line is there are
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:54.080]  these six major areas of control that this group has been focused on for
[3:01:54.080 --> 3:02:00.160]  forever number one is the money supply so in in 1913 when when the Fed was
[3:02:00.160 --> 3:02:05.800]  created we know they got the money supply covered in the US so the number
[3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:12.200]  one goal is always to control the money number two is you got to control the
[3:02:12.200 --> 3:02:17.680]  media because if you control television radio newspapers magazines then you
[3:02:17.680 --> 3:02:22.480]  control the thoughts and feelings of the population the third thing they got to
[3:02:22.480 --> 3:02:28.200]  do is control drugs and health care because everyone is going to either get
[3:02:28.200 --> 3:02:34.040]  sick or feel the urgency for their health so they control drugs and health
[3:02:34.040 --> 3:02:39.400]  care as an automatic way to control the population by forcing injections you
[3:02:39.400 --> 3:02:43.000]  know like this kid that thirteen-year-old kid with a judge says you must get
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:48.200]  chemotherapy I mean how insane is this strap the kid down and kill him so that
[3:02:48.200 --> 3:02:52.160]  makes government God I mean if they can make you take drugs make you go to them
[3:02:52.160 --> 3:02:55.600]  get the health care they want to give you that's how they force the eugenics on
[3:02:55.600 --> 3:02:59.800]  people yeah and they keep in mind the drugs are specifically used to basically
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:05.440]  mind down the individual population this has been done throughout the century we
[3:03:05.440 --> 3:03:09.280]  forget in China when the British were in control of China what did they do to the
[3:03:09.280 --> 3:03:14.960]  population let's get them all on opium so they got a bit the British got the
[3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:19.720]  entire Chinese population drugged up on opium so that they didn't have any
[3:03:19.720 --> 3:03:23.600]  problems with the population they would just go out there and do their work and
[3:03:23.600 --> 3:03:29.280]  stay high at opium all day so taking here what are the elites what are the
[3:03:29.280 --> 3:03:32.040]  elites afraid of I asked you that question forgot to ask it again what
[3:03:32.040 --> 3:03:38.120]  what are they most afraid of they're afraid this is the it's so simple
[3:03:38.120 --> 3:03:42.840]  because people always ask me what should I do and this is what they're afraid of
[3:03:42.840 --> 3:03:47.480]  they're afraid that people will get out of debt because if you completely pay
[3:03:47.480 --> 3:03:52.200]  off your credit cards pay down your mortgage you know buy a used car for
[3:03:52.200 --> 3:03:57.800]  cash instead of only money from the bank if a person gets out of debt they can't
[3:03:57.800 --> 3:04:05.720]  control you that much and secondly if you change where you spend your money if
[3:04:05.720 --> 3:04:12.720]  you stop buying see you know my book was the biggest seller that Walmart ever
[3:04:12.720 --> 3:04:18.680]  had Walmart never sold organic food so when natural cures became the best
[3:04:18.680 --> 3:04:22.240]  biggest seller they ever had the executives called me up and said we are
[3:04:22.240 --> 3:04:29.600]  forced to sell organic food in our stores because of your damn book and so
[3:04:29.600 --> 3:04:33.080]  that's what it comes down to but they're greedy and can't help it and still sell
[3:04:33.080 --> 3:04:38.480]  your book correct that's the beautiful thing greed to proceed everything even
[3:04:38.480 --> 3:04:43.440]  there the most important wishes and desires well that's just like big
[3:04:43.440 --> 3:04:46.720]  Hollywood production company with big banking funding making a Bilderberg
[3:04:46.720 --> 3:04:53.240]  group movie they like being known as the supermen of the world I want to hear

[3:09:13.880 --> 3:09:17.600]  this lights up running up now it didn't used to be like that I mean government
[3:09:17.600 --> 3:09:21.680]  is out of control they're suing you getting 37 million dollar judgments for
[3:09:21.680 --> 3:09:26.800]  writing books about how to lose weight that work I mean this is baloney it
[3:09:26.800 --> 3:09:30.600]  really is a little bit outrageous but actually it's it's I look at it as a
[3:09:30.600 --> 3:09:37.040]  very positive thing because it's becoming so outrageous people are now
[3:09:37.040 --> 3:09:43.000]  becoming aware because it's so outrageous like this 13-year-old but boy
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:47.640]  being forced to get chemotherapy me writing a book that the government
[3:09:47.640 --> 3:09:52.920]  doesn't like and finding me 37 million dollars but also in addition to that I
[3:09:52.920 --> 3:09:59.160]  have been banned from appearing on television for the next three years as a
[3:09:59.160 --> 3:10:02.840]  matter of fact I've been banned from appearing on radio and internet shows
[3:10:02.840 --> 3:10:06.960]  I'm what I'm doing right now is illegal oh I didn't know I was a thought
[3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:10.920]  criminal but I you know what I believe in the First Amendment hang together hang
[3:10:10.920 --> 3:10:16.560]  separate tell me about my thought crime having you on I'm the one breaking it
[3:10:16.560 --> 3:10:21.720]  because I'm banned from doing any media parents for three years but I just told
[3:10:21.720 --> 3:10:29.680]  them look if you want to enforce this ban sue me again I please well you know
[3:10:29.680 --> 3:10:32.880]  as you said you're appealing all of this and if they try to say you can't call my
[3:10:32.880 --> 3:10:37.080]  show I mean that's really gonna illustrate to people that there's just no
[3:10:37.080 --> 3:10:40.880]  free speech left it's really outrageous but you asked me what they're afraid of
[3:10:40.880 --> 3:10:44.200]  it again let me tell people here are the things that they're controlling and
[3:10:44.200 --> 3:10:47.120]  then I tell you the three things they're afraid of they're controlling the money
[3:10:47.120 --> 3:10:53.840]  the media the drugs and the health care the food water and roads and travel
[3:10:53.840 --> 3:10:57.560]  that's what the groups now there's a group again build a bridge they call it
[3:10:57.560 --> 3:11:02.360]  Bilderberg on because of the hotel but there's no names for these that is North
[3:11:02.360 --> 3:11:07.040]  America and Europe there's a group that handles Central America and South
[3:11:07.040 --> 3:11:12.200]  America there's the Middle East and the Persian Gulf there's Africa and then
[3:11:12.200 --> 3:11:18.200]  Asia those all of those have Bilderberg type of groups that are all working
[3:11:18.200 --> 3:11:23.480]  together and then all these tie-in and this is where I this is at the level
[3:11:23.480 --> 3:11:27.760]  that I was at it's a good organization that we don't have a name for it's
[3:11:27.760 --> 3:11:32.480]  called the brotherhood only because it's just the people together as brothers
[3:11:32.480 --> 3:11:37.640]  it's men and women but mostly men and we basically try to make sure that we
[3:11:37.640 --> 3:11:41.960]  control the money the media the food the drugs the water and the roads what are
[3:11:41.960 --> 3:11:47.520]  they afraid of they're afraid of a that you start in America that you stop
[3:11:47.520 --> 3:11:51.400]  voting for Democrats and Republicans and those for any other party break the
[3:11:51.400 --> 3:11:56.440]  left-right paradigm they are freaking out at guys like Ron Paul and if you
[3:11:56.440 --> 3:12:02.720]  remember remember Ross Perot yes hey what why isn't it bizarre that this guy
[3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:07.560]  was on the news and on television every day and then overnight you never heard
[3:12:07.560 --> 3:12:10.760]  another word from him ever again because they said they'd kill his family
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:15.840]  of course they said to say they'd kill his family but they wouldn't kill him
[3:12:15.840 --> 3:12:19.640]  they were going to murder him in the press just like Ronnie Manuel told the
[3:12:19.640 --> 3:12:23.520]  bomb hold is a Chrysler he said if you don't go along with this we're gonna
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:27.920]  we're gonna send the IRS after you and we're gonna unleash the press corps yeah
[3:12:27.920 --> 3:12:31.160]  well this mafia government like the Nazis that was a mafia government the
[3:12:31.160 --> 3:12:35.400]  Soviets mafia government don't you see it falling apart as their crimes get more
[3:12:35.400 --> 3:12:39.200]  and more legion and measures that's it the more they the more crazy they get
[3:12:39.200 --> 3:12:42.840]  the more people start making changes so number one get out of debt number two
[3:12:42.840 --> 3:12:47.000]  never vote for a Democrat or Republican with exception of Ron Paul and number
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:50.080]  three change your buying habit stop buying things from big multinational
[3:12:50.080 --> 3:12:54.840]  companies I'm in Germany right now I'm talking to guys who are 80 years old now
[3:12:54.840 --> 3:12:58.680]  people are a little healthier here they ride bikes they hike up the mountain at
[3:12:58.680 --> 3:13:02.920]  80 years old no one's taken any drugs but these guys and gals that I'm chatting
[3:13:02.920 --> 3:13:07.920]  with here in in in Germany we're around during Adolf Hitler and you know they
[3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:13.560]  tell me they look at me like they say are you Americans crazy you are doing the
[3:13:13.560 --> 3:13:20.240]  exact same thing that we did under Adolf Hitler we wanted to give up our
[3:13:20.240 --> 3:13:25.520]  freedoms so that he could protect us you are doing the exact same thing in
[3:13:25.520 --> 3:13:31.200]  America and it's it's common knowledge here from the the people that were
[3:13:31.200 --> 3:13:35.480]  around during the regime of Adolf Hitler that America and Britain are
[3:13:35.480 --> 3:13:41.360]  becoming this generation's most totalitarianism totalitarian and
[3:13:41.360 --> 3:13:46.560]  tyrannical fascist governments on planet earth let me back you up let me
[3:13:46.560 --> 3:13:49.280]  back you up and then finish because it's so important they've had British
[3:13:49.280 --> 3:13:52.760]  government US government studies and big university studies I'm sure you're
[3:13:52.760 --> 3:13:55.360]  you're mentioning the same thing that just came out in the last month admitting
[3:13:55.360 --> 3:14:00.800]  England's number five police state in the world US is number six I mean there's
[3:14:00.800 --> 3:14:07.280]  only a few like North Korea in Zimbabwe ahead of us I mean the whole world knows
[3:14:07.280 --> 3:14:11.720]  we are under hardcore tyranny and it's getting worse and worse and people said
[3:14:11.720 --> 3:14:15.320]  oh you still got your free speech and now they're starting to restrict our free
[3:14:15.320 --> 3:14:19.560]  speech we don't we don't have free speech at all when a guy can get to 37
[3:14:19.560 --> 3:14:23.440]  million dollars because he wrote a book and expressed his opinions on television
[3:14:23.440 --> 3:14:27.680]  we don't have free speech in America no I agree finish your point though that I
[3:14:27.680 --> 3:14:32.520]  interrupted about the Nazi Germany parallel well the point that people in
[3:14:32.520 --> 3:14:38.320]  America need to know because the debate is hey isn't it good that we keep these
[3:14:38.320 --> 3:14:41.920]  prisoners in Guantanamo isn't it good that the government would be given
[3:14:41.920 --> 3:14:47.080]  powers to protect us and it sounds really good the problem is when they take
[3:14:47.080 --> 3:14:51.720]  your brother-in-law away then what are you gonna do well and now they admit the
[3:14:51.720 --> 3:14:55.600]  Patriot Act and Homeland Security is for gun owners conservatives Ron Paul
[3:14:55.600 --> 3:14:59.680]  supporters and returning veterans were told it's for these brown people it's
[3:14:59.680 --> 3:15:05.400]  it's designed specifically not to be used it's designed to be used as an
[3:15:05.400 --> 3:15:09.800]  intimidation and fear tactic just like the Gestapo during the Second World War
[3:15:09.800 --> 3:15:14.520]  people were afraid to have conversations and coffee shops because if they said
[3:15:14.520 --> 3:15:20.040]  anything against the Fiora the Gestapo if they were listening or one of their
[3:15:20.040 --> 3:15:25.440]  paddles youth was listening in and reported you to Gestapo they would take
[3:15:25.440 --> 3:15:29.640]  you in for questioning and generally the first time they wouldn't do anything but
[3:15:29.640 --> 3:15:34.200]  you would crap your pants out of fear and that's what it's about it's about
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:37.960]  and by the way by the way there as you know they're now having obama's youth
[3:15:37.960 --> 3:15:42.840]  brigades that are in military formations in uniforms red and black knock on your
[3:15:42.840 --> 3:15:47.480]  door and ask we're just canvassing do you support the the leader the president
[3:15:47.480 --> 3:15:55.280]  the Fiora yeah chairman obama what do you think of obama because I confirm
[3:15:55.280 --> 3:15:58.640]  from Esteline and Tucker he was at Bilderberg last year did you hear anything
[3:15:58.640 --> 3:16:02.200]  about him at Bilderberg last year well the reason he was selected over Hillary
[3:16:02.200 --> 3:16:09.600]  is simple he did Hillary said she had a huge amount of people that hated her
[3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:15.320]  negatives yeah okay and Obama didn't and they also picked Obama because the
[3:16:15.320 --> 3:16:19.640]  bottom line is they're looking for somebody who is a great speaker and
[3:16:19.640 --> 3:16:26.640]  who's gonna persuade people you know he reads that teleprompter so well but
[3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:32.960]  yeah yeah I mean that people don't get if you I said I was with a couple
[3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:37.680]  senators and I was with them to see what they do all day it's a professional
[3:16:37.680 --> 3:16:43.000]  acting job you spent 97 70% of their day is for raising money
[3:16:43.000 --> 3:16:48.360]  they don't read any of the bills they sign they don't write any of the bills
[3:16:48.360 --> 3:16:53.280]  they sponsor unbelievable what about a complete acting job in Washington what
[3:16:53.280 --> 3:16:56.360]  about the tipping point you know it's not just that the good guys are gonna
[3:16:56.360 --> 3:17:02.320]  help us win 1% start of the war in 1775 5% won the war we don't need a majority
[3:17:02.320 --> 3:17:06.280]  we've got way more than 5% probably like 20% know what's going on now for my own
[3:17:06.280 --> 3:17:10.680]  gauge I can get your expert take on that and really want it I'm interested to
[3:17:10.680 --> 3:17:14.880]  know but there's gonna be a lot of people who are members of the elite
[3:17:14.880 --> 3:17:18.880]  different strata of the elite are gonna also see that we're starting to win and
[3:17:18.880 --> 3:17:22.880]  they're gonna jump ship over to our side I'm already seeing more and more of
[3:17:22.880 --> 3:17:27.480]  that so believing we can win and get going in the direction of liberty again
[3:17:27.480 --> 3:17:31.720]  a tipping point getting the pendulum swinging that's really doable if we
[3:17:31.720 --> 3:17:36.280]  just believe in it and act like winners well you what you just said there is
[3:17:36.280 --> 3:17:42.320]  very very astute and this is what most people did understand if you look for
[3:17:42.320 --> 3:17:47.080]  example at all the war Switzerland's always always neutral and nobody touches
[3:17:47.080 --> 3:17:52.800]  them why because that's where all the cash is but every war it doesn't matter
[3:17:52.800 --> 3:18:02.800]  who wins you understand yes relevant so it's it's at our levels we don't care
[3:18:02.800 --> 3:18:08.680]  who wins at the war it's a yawn it's like okay it doesn't matter because it's
[3:18:08.680 --> 3:18:15.840]  who profits we're like Don King we we own both fighters it doesn't matter it's
[3:18:15.840 --> 3:18:21.000]  about playing that war playing all the sides to your best profit correct and it
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:27.160]  doesn't matter who wins because we own both sides and that's why they want the
[3:18:27.160 --> 3:18:30.640]  Afghan and Iraq war to go on and on because it's nothing but a black hole
[3:18:30.640 --> 3:18:36.320]  to pump trillions into oh yeah yeah I mean those wars are I mean keep in mind
[3:18:36.320 --> 3:18:41.800]  America goes into wars around the world primarily to secure money for
[3:18:41.800 --> 3:18:45.960]  contractors and pay off friends I mean that's why you think France and Germany
[3:18:45.960 --> 3:18:49.280]  got so pissed off when America went into Iraq because they're the ones who had
[3:18:49.280 --> 3:18:54.400]  90% of the contracts absolutely but now there's an America went into sorry we're
[3:18:54.400 --> 3:18:58.200]  taking over the contracts and that's why France and Germany got really mad but
[3:18:58.200 --> 3:19:01.320]  suddenly they're on board with Iraq because they were given some of the
[3:19:01.320 --> 3:19:05.640]  contracts back correct that that's what people don't understand I've been
[3:19:05.640 --> 3:19:09.720]  to someone when we went into Iraq before we went in people know this but they
[3:19:09.720 --> 3:19:15.640]  were like a group meeting how to profit from the upcoming Iraqi war and these
[3:19:15.640 --> 3:19:20.160]  are business symposiums with directors and corporate executives from
[3:19:20.160 --> 3:19:22.920]  infrastructure companies and oil companies and so forth all getting
[3:19:22.920 --> 3:19:27.720]  together I was there talking about how we're gonna go into this country and

[3:23:55.080 --> 3:24:08.680]  that's 888-654-3447 boy he is something else you know why the man is after him
[3:24:08.680 --> 3:24:12.880]  Kevin Trudeau I can find no fault with this guy I just agree with him on every
[3:24:12.880 --> 3:24:20.680]  front you know also the nouveau riche the new wealth the middle class some of the
[3:24:20.680 --> 3:24:24.520]  even ultra rich who were new money they realized the elites waging war on them
[3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:29.080]  what about how the globalists are now after 500 years going after Switzerland
[3:24:29.080 --> 3:24:33.120]  shaking down the smaller accounts but leaving the big juicy ones alone and
[3:24:33.120 --> 3:24:36.640]  then David Rockefeller is bragging about they're going to end all tax havens
[3:24:36.640 --> 3:24:42.600]  set a global tax rate to the OECD end quote tax havens open announcements of
[3:24:42.600 --> 3:24:47.760]  world government with these bankers running it I think this tiny elite has
[3:24:47.760 --> 3:24:51.040]  really going to get their butt kicked and I've seen the shift because they're
[3:24:51.040 --> 3:24:55.040]  waging war on not just the middle class on the poor they're going after a lot of
[3:24:55.040 --> 3:25:01.840]  big money well there's an interesting concept about this and let me just put
[3:25:01.840 --> 3:25:06.960]  it to you this way from the the guys that I hang around with I mean you know
[3:25:06.960 --> 3:25:11.920]  maybe they manage a $10 billion hedge fund you know one guy last year you
[3:25:11.920 --> 3:25:15.680]  know netted a couple hundred million dollars and my chat with these guys
[3:25:15.680 --> 3:25:24.080]  about taxes they laugh because to them it's all smoking mirrors look we pay a
[3:25:24.080 --> 3:25:29.520]  little bit of tax but it's it's nothing it's nothing like people think we're
[3:25:29.520 --> 3:25:36.280]  gonna pay because they're I mean the US tax code nobody can even understand it
[3:25:36.280 --> 3:25:39.600]  you know it's written for the elites to pay just a few percent and the people
[3:25:39.600 --> 3:25:44.240]  are paying 40 correct I mean listen I have corporations in Switzerland and you
[3:25:44.240 --> 3:25:47.600]  know they have the best road to the world you're in Chicago or India or in
[3:25:47.600 --> 3:25:50.720]  Austin I was down there it's like driving on the as mankind says it's like
[3:25:50.720 --> 3:25:52.400]  driving on the surface of the moon
[3:25:52.400 --> 3:25:57.400]  craters everywhere right I'm driving around Germany and I cannot find one
[3:25:57.400 --> 3:26:03.360]  not one pothole not one but guess what they have to pay for that they build the
[3:26:03.360 --> 3:26:08.120]  road to last 25 years not five like they do in the US so you have to pay for
[3:26:08.120 --> 3:26:12.000]  that so when I set up a company in Switzerland for example they say look
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:16.240]  the taxes are 10% or 12% or 15% and you pay it because there's good
[3:26:16.240 --> 3:26:20.840]  infrastructure and things you no problems like buying a good steak yeah
[3:26:20.840 --> 3:26:25.200]  here it's a scam but you get good value for your money in the US when you pay
[3:26:25.200 --> 3:26:30.600]  your taxes it goes paying interest on the government's debt and it's going to
[3:26:30.600 --> 3:26:35.180]  the bankers you're not getting any of our Americans
[3:26:35.180 --> 3:26:41.040]  Kevin Turdo our Americans known as the schmucks of the world now the suckers
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:47.520]  the word is suckers that the Americans are the suckers there's no question about
[3:26:47.520 --> 3:26:52.120]  it is it because we were so free and you know had it so good that we kind of sat
[3:26:52.120 --> 3:26:57.560]  on our laurels I think it's because of the media in America brainwashes people
[3:26:57.560 --> 3:27:03.040]  to have them believe things should be a certain way the majority of Americans
[3:27:03.040 --> 3:27:06.200]  have never left the United States really just give an example you're driving
[3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:10.160]  there up down the road in America right you stop in a gas station you go to the
[3:27:10.160 --> 3:27:17.000]  bathroom is it the cleanest place in the world no I mean it's disgusting right
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:21.040]  you're in Europe you stop in a gas station you walk in you go to the
[3:27:21.040 --> 3:27:25.840]  bathroom it's spotless there's an attendant there okay you're in America you
[3:27:25.840 --> 3:27:29.480]  stop in a gas station what's up to eat well how about this three week old
[3:27:29.480 --> 3:27:34.400]  sandwich in the back right and you know I'm talking about there's no food in
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:38.840]  America in Europe you walk into a gas station what I mean there's a chef and a
[3:27:38.840 --> 3:27:42.600]  kitchen and all the fruits and vegetables are organic because they don't
[3:27:42.600 --> 3:27:47.840]  allow genetically modified people demand quality and here we were sold on crap
[3:27:47.840 --> 3:27:51.920]  just like me correct just like McDonald's 50 years ago would put a trash
[3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:55.840]  can there and say thank you and we like idiots would go throw our trash away and
[3:27:55.840 --> 3:28:00.080]  just lowering the standard correct correct correct correct so the bottom
[3:28:00.080 --> 3:28:04.720]  line is people in America just don't know anymore how things should be I mean
[3:28:04.720 --> 3:28:09.280]  we just don't get it I mean if you look at a cookbook in America and it says
[3:28:09.280 --> 3:28:14.920]  this is home cooking ingredients one can of mushroom cream of mushroom soup
[3:28:14.920 --> 3:28:18.800]  that's not how you make something you don't use a can of cream of mushroom
[3:28:18.800 --> 3:28:23.320]  soup in a homemade recipe you know what I disagree with you we're gonna have you
[3:28:23.320 --> 3:28:27.600]  arrested for saying what a home cook meal is you don't have free speech you
[3:28:27.600 --> 3:28:30.960]  don't have free speech Kevin Trudeau Kevin in closing I know I gave the

[3:33:15.920 --> 3:33:34.200]  yeah about a year ago Rob Jacobson said you want to do infomercials like
[3:33:34.200 --> 3:33:39.680]  Kevin Trudeau and I said you know man I can barely figure out how to balance my
[3:33:39.680 --> 3:33:43.440]  checkbook and move into a bigger office but we've gotten to the next level we
[3:33:43.440 --> 3:33:47.400]  just need the support to go to the level after that and Kevin Trudeau is
[3:33:47.400 --> 3:33:53.280]  definitely something else the guy does make billions of dollars a year and I
[3:33:53.280 --> 3:33:55.600]  was talking to him during the breaks he's probably listening right now I
[3:33:55.600 --> 3:34:00.280]  missed her to mr. Trudeau he really knows the show he really listens to it
[3:34:00.280 --> 3:34:05.400]  routinely it's incredible and I found out at one of the large parties in Japan
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:09.840]  has meetings watching my videos you know in the parliament offices and the
[3:34:09.840 --> 3:34:14.920]  Bilderberg group members know who I am and track and follow what I do
[3:34:14.920 --> 3:34:20.480]  Estalyn told me about a Bilderberg group person who saw the Obama deception but
[3:34:20.480 --> 3:34:25.280]  he didn't expressly say I can talk about it he told me not to talk about that
[3:34:25.280 --> 3:34:28.720]  people that bought Terminator put not Terminator and then his movie and now
[3:34:28.720 --> 3:34:31.920]  they're announcing it two years ago I didn't talk about it I mean who can make
[3:34:31.920 --> 3:34:35.160]  this stuff up it's just too weird my wife thinks we live in the matrix or
[3:34:35.160 --> 3:34:39.000]  something I mean a literal matrix she's starting to think that not just a phony
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:43.240]  left-right matrix you know I mean you know this is all a delusion I'm not a
[3:34:43.240 --> 3:34:46.840]  syndicated radio talk show host I'm already in Hollywood films I haven't
[3:34:46.840 --> 3:34:50.240]  made some of the most viral internet videos I don't know all these people
[3:34:50.240 --> 3:34:55.200]  because the stuff I can't talk about on air is ten times wilder than what you
[3:34:55.200 --> 3:34:59.920]  were just hearing on there and then meanwhile at night last night I was
[3:34:59.920 --> 3:35:03.440]  just all sitting there for hours I couldn't sleep writing notes and thinking
[3:35:03.440 --> 3:35:07.120]  about the New World Order and all these things I wanted to impart to humanity
[3:35:07.120 --> 3:35:11.760]  about the nature of the human spirit and our future and and all this news I
[3:35:11.760 --> 3:35:15.040]  wanted to cover and literally 50 articles I printed off it was gonna cover
[3:35:15.040 --> 3:35:18.800]  each one on air today and the whole show just blew past us and we covered a lot
[3:35:18.800 --> 3:35:24.560]  but it's just crazy meanwhile for all my petty power I can't get rid of the
[3:35:24.560 --> 3:35:31.440]  fruit flies here in the office the stuff Trudeau was telling me off air oh my
[3:35:31.440 --> 3:35:35.920]  god and you know I believe all of that because I know he jet-sets around with
[3:35:35.920 --> 3:35:39.760]  those people but to have Trudeau on here talking about Bilderberg group meeting
[3:35:39.760 --> 3:35:45.160]  and that's exactly who they'd want there is is people that have you know have
[3:35:45.160 --> 3:35:48.640]  this influence outside their control they usually have about seven to 15
[3:35:48.640 --> 3:35:52.200]  members of the press or alternative media they try to get there and of course
[3:35:52.200 --> 3:35:55.240]  they would have Kevin Trudeau there but he was basically saying he was at the
[3:35:55.240 --> 3:36:03.120]  German meeting four years ago so in Rotterdam okay you know what I said I'd
[3:36:03.120 --> 3:36:11.200]  take calls by the way John I was busy did you ever check what gold is today well
[3:36:11.200 --> 3:36:15.520]  here I'm just gonna do that right now myself I'm just gonna check this cuz I
[3:36:15.520 --> 3:36:20.120]  want to know what it is I mean it exploded last week and I didn't even
[3:36:20.120 --> 3:36:25.000]  cover it I mean it's up like 80 something 90 something dollars yeah click on
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:34.600]  that for me just absolutely incredible oh it's it's down three dollars at 952
[3:36:34.600 --> 3:36:44.640]  which is up 52 and 20 72 dollars from two weeks ago so just amazing that that
[3:36:44.640 --> 3:36:50.000]  is going on you know I said I would do justice to this hey will you call Rob
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:52.920]  doing here cuz I want to take calls here at the end of the show but I want to
[3:36:52.920 --> 3:36:56.440]  plan tomorrow's show and make some promises because I filled up like two
[3:36:56.440 --> 3:37:00.000]  notebooks of points I wanted to make the last few months and then last night
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:02.720]  that I didn't have a notebook in bed I was turning the light on and riding in
[3:37:02.720 --> 3:37:10.200]  the back of a pit Karen's Island we bring my note the blue notepad my pit
[3:37:10.200 --> 3:37:13.360]  Karen's Island I was I finished that book last night at about 2 a.m. and I
[3:37:13.360 --> 3:37:17.240]  was scribbling with a light on my wife's like what are you doing and I'm you
[3:37:17.240 --> 3:37:23.920]  know yeah my book Pit Karen's Island and my folder are sitting out there on the
[3:37:23.920 --> 3:37:30.680]  table and there's all these important brainstorming points I've had the
[3:37:30.680 --> 3:37:36.360]  biggest issue I've got to figure out is is whenever I scribble this stuff so
[3:37:36.360 --> 3:37:40.040]  fast it's hard to read later when I look at it I've got all these notebooks and
[3:37:40.040 --> 3:37:45.000]  then I I filled up the back of this book with notes last night and then I ran out
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:54.400]  of time so I feel I used a card by the bed to write notes and what Rob do come
[3:37:54.400 --> 3:37:57.720]  on in here I want to know what the schedule is tomorrow so I can come in
[3:37:57.720 --> 3:38:02.160]  because these are important points or I may just start a thing like we have a
[3:38:02.160 --> 3:38:05.840]  live video feed by my bed because it's always when I'm trying to go to sleep
[3:38:05.840 --> 3:38:08.400]  that all this stuff's racing through my head and it all makes sense and I know
[3:38:08.400 --> 3:38:12.480]  how to explain it is it the same way for you guys when you're when you're going
[3:38:12.480 --> 3:38:16.600]  to bed at night it's when your brain really works the best definitely and
[3:38:16.600 --> 3:38:21.440]  I need to have a video cam there and my wife snoring she doesn't snore too loud
[3:38:21.440 --> 3:38:27.240]  it's kind of a cute little snore like a little piglet or something I'm like she
[3:38:27.240 --> 3:38:30.240]  says I snore like a rhinoceros I'll be like stop it I'm doing the video pod
[3:38:30.240 --> 3:38:33.880]  like I may rig my bedroom up with a camera I'll be like in the pillow my
[3:38:33.880 --> 3:38:39.560]  hair sticking up I'll turn to the side and make points what's the schedule
[3:38:39.560 --> 3:38:43.040]  tomorrow so that I know when I can mark off to come in here and cover this stuff
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:47.400]  you're gonna be happy because it's a wide open right now I said keep some
[3:38:47.400 --> 3:38:50.280]  days open so I can keep tomorrow wide open and we'll just book for Thursday
[3:38:50.280 --> 3:38:54.080]  and Friday then I have a tendency just to run on at the mouth yeah that's fine
[3:38:54.080 --> 3:38:58.960]  we'll keep tomorrow wide open and then I'm gonna come on and take calls for the
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:39:02.880]  first hour them to an hour long rant on the nature of the universe from my
[3:39:02.880 --> 3:39:07.480]  perspective and what what what our true goals ought to be hey that was a wild
[3:39:07.480 --> 3:39:11.440]  interview with her no great that was great I've seen that guy on TV for years
[3:39:11.440 --> 3:39:16.000]  and you know he's just you see him there and that's it but so tomorrow Alex and
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:19.520]  I was talking to him he knows he listens to show must be all the time yeah he was
[3:39:19.520 --> 3:39:23.920]  talking about the John Perkins interview see listen to that you know no he was
[3:39:23.920 --> 3:39:28.000]  saying he listens a lot when he's on the podcast yeah well I guess you could well
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:30.800]  when you got that much money you can afford to get your information at any
[3:39:30.800 --> 3:39:34.480]  time yeah but I'm really flattered that how many people it's kind of spooky
[3:39:34.480 --> 3:39:38.200]  though yeah I mean you know I haven't even really covered this we're attacked
[3:39:38.200 --> 3:39:42.920]  by the LA Times which is the Ferris piece the Bloomberg Bloomberg New York
[3:39:42.920 --> 3:39:47.480]  Times variety washed in post and literally probably ten other things I
[3:39:47.480 --> 3:39:52.680]  didn't even print I mean and it's all BS it's all no it says it says I imagined
[3:39:52.680 --> 3:39:56.440]  that they pulled a fire drill on me that I imagine men following me it's all on
[3:39:56.440 --> 3:39:59.880]  record they did it right I mean they walk up to me and say you better not pull
[3:39:59.880 --> 3:40:02.960]  fire alarms we've had people pulling them and trying to steal vases in here
[3:40:02.960 --> 3:40:06.080]  you're not and then they walk off and I go to my room and they pull the fire
[3:40:06.080 --> 3:40:09.320]  alarm on me and then I'm weird for freaking out and then we have them
[3:40:09.320 --> 3:40:13.880]  following us off the grounds yeah and secret service with earpieces on video
[3:40:13.880 --> 3:40:19.320]  and they're saying it doesn't exist Rob I mean that's they're so or maybe
[3:40:19.320 --> 3:40:22.640]  they're not discredited maybe the public's so dumb and wants to feel like
[3:40:22.640 --> 3:40:26.040]  they're elitist making fun of me you know that minds out that oh look at this
[3:40:26.040 --> 3:40:30.640]  poor schizophrenic he believes in an elite just go with the system it'll be
[3:40:30.640 --> 3:40:37.000]  okay it'll be okay yeah but I mean these are really pathetic I agree I totally
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:40.840]  agree I mean I feel sad for Danny I think he's a little upset that he got
[3:40:40.840 --> 3:40:44.000]  cut out of the new world order film but I agree with him it is somewhat of a
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:47.360]  distortion and kind of a hit piece so you ought to be happy he says he is happy
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:50.240]  he's not in it and you know I think he could have could have landed more
[3:40:50.240 --> 3:40:53.920]  credibility to it you know I thought well he is he is a gentle fellow but I do
[3:40:53.920 --> 3:40:56.520]  think I got it that's what people are asking why his feathers got out of you
[3:40:56.520 --> 3:41:00.160]  know ruffle there I don't control what some film crew does right I didn't even
[3:41:00.160 --> 3:41:02.560]  really remember that they'd mentioned they'd interviewed Esteline years ago
[3:41:02.560 --> 3:41:07.400]  film crews come they go we've had a lot of men they're always hit pieces yeah
[3:41:07.400 --> 3:41:11.400]  this one was one of the lesser hit pieces well I don't we haven't seen the
[3:41:11.400 --> 3:41:15.280]  conspiracy hunters from Australia we haven't seen their piece yet I don't
[3:41:15.280 --> 3:41:18.280]  think that's a hit piece yeah they sent me books their family written it's all
[3:41:18.280 --> 3:41:21.560]  anti-new world order but those guys were for real now I think I think that's
[3:41:21.560 --> 3:41:27.080]  gonna be a good one when it comes up so Alex Jones something about tomorrow but
[3:41:27.080 --> 3:41:32.280]  the same thing is they may not even let it come out I mean it's like it's like
[3:41:32.280 --> 3:41:36.720]  the maker of Paradise Lost and some kind of monster and Brothers Keeper you know
[3:41:36.720 --> 3:41:43.760]  that guy's one you know Oscars and stuff and you notice that three million
[3:41:43.760 --> 3:41:48.560]  plus dollars to make a film yeah with yours truly is the main guy gone not
[3:41:48.560 --> 3:41:53.560]  gonna be aired oh I bet we could find it I bet we could find it somehow oh no no
[3:41:53.560 --> 3:41:57.240]  no that no that was shelved yeah that was that was no that was shelved at
[3:41:57.240 --> 3:42:02.720]  Discovery and he told me not to talk about it like a year and a half ago he
[3:42:02.720 --> 3:42:05.960]  said just wait and see of it if it later you can talk about it so now I talk
[3:42:05.960 --> 3:42:10.000]  about it ought to get him back on the show who's that what's his name Joe
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:14.080]  Bellinger Belgium always been mispronounced it just just there he's
[3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:20.160]  the co-director all the films I mentioned uh let's yeah let's call him up
[3:42:20.160 --> 3:42:23.320]  and get him back on the show but don't tell him it's about that if he wants to
[3:42:23.320 --> 3:42:26.560]  bring that up on air we'll just have him bring that up right that's how I'm
[3:42:26.560 --> 3:42:29.760]  also able to get all these guesses people know I'm not usually mean to
[3:42:29.760 --> 3:42:32.400]  people unless they come on and say we need to exterminate everybody and then
[3:42:32.400 --> 3:42:35.760]  I tend to start arguing with them I'm like oh so Prince Phillips part of your
[3:42:35.760 --> 3:42:42.760]  royal eugenics society that's it this interview is about you know like I
[3:42:42.760 --> 3:42:46.600]  didn't know that information listen this is the biggest story ever I want you to
