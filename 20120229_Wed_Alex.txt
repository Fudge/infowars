[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:21.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.120 --> 00:41.560]  here we are February 29th 2012 on this worldwide Wednesday broadcast and we
[00:41.560 --> 00:45.720]  are basically ending up where we started I'll be back in Austin Texas this
[00:45.720 --> 00:49.680]  evening I am coming to you from overlooking the Mississippi River in
[00:49.680 --> 00:55.720]  Baton Rouge where we were last Wednesday after we had kicked off the first
[00:55.720 --> 01:03.480]  successful leg of a beta testing tour from Dallas to Orlando and back so thank
[01:03.480 --> 01:12.160]  you so much for joining us here today obviously Ron Paul got creamed in
[01:12.160 --> 01:18.080]  multiple states yesterday there is evidence of election fraud there is
[01:18.080 --> 01:22.840]  not as clear and evidence as Maine in Iowa and I'll be breaking down coming
[01:22.840 --> 01:28.320]  up after the break exactly how the system manufacturers consent with the
[01:28.320 --> 01:33.480]  population and I've been telling people from the start Ron Paul could win but
[01:33.480 --> 01:37.240]  expect massive election fraud in early primaries to then create the
[01:37.240 --> 01:42.320]  perception that he's losing so people get into a bandwagon type scenario and
[01:42.320 --> 01:45.600]  start voting for who they think is gonna win not who they think is the right
[01:45.600 --> 01:49.280]  person and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy you see this
[01:49.280 --> 01:55.920]  with Obama and of course we're now seeing this with Mittens Romney and you
[01:55.920 --> 01:59.160]  can't be mad at Ron Paul the campaign still goes on he's still informing
[01:59.160 --> 02:02.800]  people still educating people still bringing up real issues still building
[02:02.800 --> 02:09.440]  a movement for liberty but the fix is in so we have to have a discussion a larger
[02:09.440 --> 02:14.200]  discussion about that and I specifically want to hear from callers here in the
[02:14.200 --> 02:19.360]  first hour on your views of what you've seen with the Ron Paul campaign and
[02:19.360 --> 02:24.040]  where all of this is going specifically on all things Ron Paul election fraud
[02:24.040 --> 02:28.800]  the electoral process it's a very wide field to discuss and we're gonna go to
[02:28.800 --> 02:33.120]  calls early in this hour in fact next segment toll tree number to join us 800
[02:33.120 --> 02:40.480]  25 at 9 9231 800 25 at 9 9231 that we are discussing the wide electoral
[02:40.480 --> 02:45.520]  process the evidence of fraud where you think this election is going and what
[02:45.520 --> 02:49.200]  you think's gonna unfold if we end up with Mittens Romney or Barack Hussein
[02:49.200 --> 02:52.840]  the new world order minion Obama both teleprompter readers who support open
[02:52.840 --> 02:58.000]  borders global taxation global government carbon taxes gun registration
[02:58.000 --> 03:05.280]  and control abortion the list goes on and on 800 25 at 9 9231 and we'll get
[03:05.280 --> 03:11.560]  you up and on the air here today on this Wednesday edition also we have foster
[03:11.560 --> 03:17.840]  gamble of the proctor and gamble fortune and his wife Kimberly gamble joining us
[03:17.840 --> 03:20.400]  a few months ago it's very getting phone calls saying what do you think of this
[03:20.400 --> 03:27.040]  new movie thrive I said I can't comment on I haven't seen it and so the crew
[03:27.040 --> 03:31.360]  watched it and had mixed feelings on it but overall thought it was coming from a
[03:31.360 --> 03:37.720]  positive place of getting people outside the box and expand the paradigm and we
[03:37.720 --> 03:41.520]  are now carrying the film I've had a chance to go over it and I think that
[03:41.520 --> 03:47.240]  overall I agree with about 80% of what's in the film and I do think they're you
[03:47.240 --> 03:50.080]  know they're coming from a position of really legitimately trying to wake
[03:50.080 --> 03:53.760]  people up the globalists are not gonna be happy with this film it's trying to
[03:53.760 --> 03:57.600]  give people outside the box and I think it'll really wake up people on the
[03:57.600 --> 04:01.600]  traditional left and and kind of New Age or types and and it's got a little bit
[04:01.600 --> 04:05.520]  of you know UFO stuff in it asking what is this are we being lied to about that
[04:05.520 --> 04:09.200]  it's all about we've been lied to about all these other things WMD's the
[04:09.200 --> 04:12.840]  private Federal Reserve what else we're being lied to about and it gets into the
[04:12.840 --> 04:16.880]  you know the government giving us cancer on purpose to reduce population it gets
[04:16.880 --> 04:22.720]  into technologies being suppressed new forms of energy being suppressed on
[04:22.720 --> 04:27.280]  record so it covers a lot of things that are very important to waking up
[04:27.280 --> 04:31.000]  humanity and then it just asks questions about other big issues and says it
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.840]  should all be investigated and the most controversial part to liberals that watch
[04:34.840 --> 04:40.160]  it is the individual liberty kind of Ron Paul libertarian constitutional
[04:40.160 --> 04:45.120]  position and it's something really waking liberals up and so that's why
[04:45.120 --> 04:48.320]  we're carrying it at info wars dot com we'll tell you about that they're gonna
[04:48.320 --> 04:53.160]  be joining us as well coming up and also the nanny state wants to restrict

[07:02.600 --> 07:06.200]  amount of food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing
[07:06.200 --> 07:10.560]  was working my body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements
[07:10.560 --> 07:15.440]  as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half
[07:15.440 --> 07:19.800]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of

[08:00.560 --> 08:06.240]  this communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because
[08:06.240 --> 08:10.160]  there's a war on for your mind
[08:15.040 --> 08:22.440]  it is Wednesday the 29th day of February 2012 we're gonna be live here for
[08:22.440 --> 08:26.680]  the next three hours I've been on the road the last week and a half that I'll
[08:26.680 --> 08:32.360]  be back in studio deep in the heart of Texas Austin Texas tomorrow this has
[08:32.360 --> 08:37.120]  been a successful experiment being on the road so I am 9% sure I'm gonna do a
[08:37.120 --> 08:42.840]  big Western tour probably visiting six or seven affiliates going through New
[08:42.840 --> 08:53.520]  Mexico Arizona California Oregon Washington Utah maybe Montana Wyoming
[08:53.520 --> 08:58.000]  down into Colorado and then back to Texas and then maybe we still have a
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.000]  country in World War three hadn't started yet at the end of the summer in
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.840]  the fall I'll do a shorter week-long trip it's a lot of folks want to see us up
[09:04.840 --> 09:09.280]  in Oklahoma City Kansas City where I had an event like eight nine years ago and
[09:09.280 --> 09:14.360]  had like 800 people come out to and then up into maybe Chicago Minneapolis
[09:14.360 --> 09:19.920]  St. Paul maybe Detroit and then come back down and hit maybe some other town
[09:19.920 --> 09:23.640]  somewhere and come back to Austin because it is important for me to get
[09:23.640 --> 09:27.840]  outside the command base occasionally and let the crew there do the nightly
[09:27.840 --> 09:31.960]  news and all the great work they're doing because we're trying to build an
[09:31.960 --> 09:37.800]  organization of reporters and investigators not just Alex Jones and all
[09:37.800 --> 09:41.880]  of us are doing this together all of you out there taking action and supporting
[09:41.880 --> 09:44.960]  what we're doing we couldn't do any of this without you so I salute you and
[09:44.960 --> 09:49.160]  thank all of you and want to thank our sponsors listeners and FM affiliate
[09:49.160 --> 09:55.000]  global shortwave satellite channel 166 on XM serious and of course everybody's
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.720]  writing the word online we need to use the internet while it's still free to
[09:58.720 --> 10:02.880]  some extent because the system is trying to make the internet go dark so two
[10:02.880 --> 10:07.080]  fold we fight for the future openness and freedom of the internet the
[10:07.080 --> 10:10.640]  electronic soapbox and system of commerce that the globalist want to
[10:10.640 --> 10:16.160]  control but we also use it like we're going to lose it better make hay while
[10:16.160 --> 10:21.080]  the sun is shining I know I've done a lot of rural work on farms and ranches
[10:21.080 --> 10:26.120]  growing up most summer sent down to grandma's one year worked you know for
[10:26.120 --> 10:29.520]  large animal vet for about nine ten months and I know that there were a lot
[10:29.520 --> 10:33.240]  of times in the summer when when they were making hay that people stay up
[10:33.240 --> 10:38.600]  till midnight because the hay is ready to be cut it's valuable and that's how
[10:38.600 --> 10:41.440]  you're gonna pay the taxes that's how you're gonna pay the workers and that's
[10:41.440 --> 10:43.680]  how you're gonna have enough hay for your cows that winter and that's how you're
[10:43.680 --> 10:48.360]  gonna have enough hay to make money and sell it to others and if you don't cut
[10:48.360 --> 10:51.080]  it when it's right in a rainstorm you know it's coming in three days the
[10:51.080 --> 10:55.640]  weatherman says and it's gonna ruin that grass if it gets really wet you're not
[10:55.640 --> 10:59.160]  gonna be able to you know really have that hay now I'm getting off into
[10:59.160 --> 11:03.600]  agriculture you've got to make hay while the sun is shining you want to cut that
[11:03.600 --> 11:07.560]  big tall green grass when the sun is shining and it's dry or it'll get all
[11:07.560 --> 11:11.920]  moldy and it fungus all over and make your cows sick side issue I'm now
[11:11.920 --> 11:18.400]  getting off into animal husbandry as well so you make hay while the sun is
[11:18.400 --> 11:26.640]  shining and it was many times I'd crawl into bed at midnight and then I'd pull
[11:26.640 --> 11:29.600]  back up you know the different ranches and stuff I was working at and have old
[11:29.600 --> 11:34.000]  men call me a wimp for being 20 minutes late at 5 30 in the morning while they
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.040]  were stomping around you know getting all fired up about running around like
[11:38.040 --> 11:43.360]  piranhas or fire ants working it's that type of energy by the way you see all
[11:43.360 --> 11:48.480]  these rodeos and you know all this kind of Western culture stuff that's all
[11:48.480 --> 11:53.520]  really a facsimile of the real Western culture where people really do work hard
[11:53.520 --> 11:58.080]  and they're not just macho you got to get fired up to work like that and it
[11:58.080 --> 12:01.600]  actually becomes kind of a cool at least what I've seen working on ranches and
[12:01.600 --> 12:08.440]  busy working for that large animal that is a type of crazed crazed action where I
[12:08.440 --> 12:15.840]  guess it just makes the day go faster to get wild you see though that's how my
[12:15.840 --> 12:21.640]  brain works I am now digressing off into memories and I guess the show's
[12:21.640 --> 12:24.240]  successful because people know it's not scripted but I've got all this
[12:24.240 --> 12:27.720]  incredible news that I've got to get to and then your phone calls and then some
[12:27.720 --> 12:35.880]  big guests as well today but maybe I'm procrastinating getting the news
[12:35.880 --> 12:39.960]  because it's it's it's really what I thought was going to happen and then
[12:39.960 --> 12:44.320]  people are gonna ask me well then why did you say get behind Ron Paul 110%
[12:44.320 --> 12:48.480]  well because I told you from the start I believe this would happen there was a
[12:48.480 --> 12:54.160]  slight chance that the Ron Paul support would be so overwhelming that he could
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.040]  turbocharge all of us could basically ram the gates and crash through the lies
[12:59.040 --> 13:03.400]  of disinformation and actually get him in but then they would try to steal the
[13:03.400 --> 13:06.880]  general election and then if he got in they would pull out every dirty trick
[13:06.880 --> 13:10.240]  on earth guaranteed false flags you name it and probably try to blame
[13:10.240 --> 13:14.480]  libertarian ideas for the collapse that they've already engineered so then
[13:14.480 --> 13:17.600]  people will ask well then why did you support Ron Paul and are you saying it's
[13:17.600 --> 13:22.880]  all over no it's just begun and what am I talking about here and we're gonna open
[13:22.880 --> 13:27.360]  the phones up four people specifically to give us your take on the campaign on
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.560]  the election fraud on where you see things are going in fact the lines are
[13:31.560 --> 13:34.160]  already loaded up and I'll get to those coming up here in a few minutes and then
[13:34.160 --> 13:39.580]  all the other news Romney wins in Arizona Michigan Centaurim falls short in
[13:39.580 --> 13:44.160]  upset attempt Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney cruised an easy
[13:44.160 --> 13:47.400]  victory in Arizona primary Tuesday and eked out a narrow one in Michigan a
[13:47.400 --> 13:52.160]  double win that studied a campaign shaken in recent weeks by surging support
[13:52.160 --> 13:59.360]  for rival Rick Santorum you don't notice you never hear Mitt Romney getting in
[13:59.360 --> 14:02.480]  trouble for being financed by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan just like Obama
[14:02.480 --> 14:06.400]  we're supporting abortion and then flip-flopping or being for open borders
[14:06.400 --> 14:12.480]  or carbon taxes it's always oh I love Detroit we've got two Cadillacs and then
[14:12.480 --> 14:17.440]  it's like he's bad because he's got two Cadillacs it is rich people that buy
[14:17.440 --> 14:21.840]  Cadillacs and get their hair done and buy clothes and have people that work
[14:21.840 --> 14:25.800]  for them the more rich people you've got the more jobs you've got the richer in
[14:25.800 --> 14:28.960]  economy you've got if they're rich people that got their money through the
[14:28.960 --> 14:33.120]  free market if they're cronies like Mitt Romney who got it through
[14:33.120 --> 14:38.700]  consolidation and stealing mainly they are the plague but to demonize him for
[14:38.700 --> 14:44.800]  two Cadillacs is crazy I mean what would you rather be poor like some third
[14:44.800 --> 14:48.560]  world country where only one guy in the city has a Cadillac or like North Korea
[14:48.560 --> 14:55.120]  where only Kim Jong-il's got a Cadillac rising tides do raise all ships if it's
[14:55.120 --> 14:58.440]  not a globalist rising tide where they divert all the water out to their
[14:58.440 --> 15:05.640]  private lake steal our water take over the system and you know they're going
[15:05.640 --> 15:10.880]  after him at the Daytona 500 for saying oh man you know I don't follow NASCAR as
[15:10.880 --> 15:15.040]  much as some people do but I like it and yeah I got a lot of friends that are
[15:15.040 --> 15:19.120]  team owners they're like oh you know team owners there weren't team owners
[15:19.120 --> 15:25.280]  there wouldn't be a Daytona 500 I mean it's this it's this idea America had the
[15:25.280 --> 15:29.040]  biggest per capita group of rich people in it 50 years ago and we had the most
[15:29.040 --> 15:34.160]  middle-class in the world five percent of the world population and we had half
[15:34.160 --> 15:38.560]  the world's wealth now that's all going out the window because mega corporations
[15:38.560 --> 15:42.760]  came in control the government and had government shut down industry here so
[15:42.760 --> 15:47.280]  that their industry in China India Mexico and 100 plus other countries where
[15:47.280 --> 15:52.080]  they have deals with the thugs that run them to move our industry there that
[15:52.080 --> 15:56.320]  automatically lets them consolidate control I'm already digressing the
[15:56.320 --> 15:59.760]  point is is that they're saying what Ron Paul came in fourth place in Michigan
[15:59.760 --> 16:05.000]  does anybody really believe that and I've already gone over all this winning
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.440]  almost all the straw pulls winning most the scientific polls and being ignored
[16:08.440 --> 16:11.360]  when he got first or second place we're getting the least amount of time in the
[16:11.360 --> 16:14.960]  debates that's the evidence of the fix being in then I told you day one with
[16:14.960 --> 16:18.160]  the evidence Iowa clear fraud month later came out yeah we're setting the
[16:18.160 --> 16:23.480]  election aside it's all a fraud we're not gonna say who really won maybe it's
[16:23.480 --> 16:27.200]  Santorum but yeah all these counties we didn't count those from Ron Paul because
[16:27.200 --> 16:30.920]  the trucks got lost with the ballots there are no trucks with ballots it's
[16:30.920 --> 16:35.440]  called in and then in Maine all the counties where he had big double-digit
[16:35.440 --> 16:38.880]  leads they just didn't count them they said yeah we didn't count them New York
[16:38.880 --> 16:42.120]  Times said yeah Paul really did win if you count those counties because he did
[16:42.120 --> 16:44.360]  have double digits in most those counties but there's not gonna count
[16:44.360 --> 16:48.960]  Republican leadership said forget it South Carolina clear fraud so a hundred
[16:48.960 --> 16:56.080]  percent cut and dry in Maine about 95 percent cut and dry in Iowa about 85
[16:56.080 --> 16:59.760]  percent total fraud proof you know you know it is but it's it's not a hundred
[16:59.760 --> 17:04.360]  percent in South Carolina it's about 85 percent in Nevada and now there's
[17:04.360 --> 17:07.640]  evidence of fraud in these states as well I've stayed up late last night
[17:07.640 --> 17:11.920]  analyzing it and then this morning looked at it but more and more it's gonna
[17:11.920 --> 17:16.120]  shift where Ron Paul isn't the front runner because people will go well he's
[17:16.120 --> 17:23.080]  losing now I want to bet on the winner it's just like people I mean I am a
[17:23.080 --> 17:27.680]  years ago a football fan but because I know it's just a distraction of real
[17:27.680 --> 17:30.640]  issues I'm not today because I can't fill my mind up with that stuff but I get
[17:30.640 --> 17:34.080]  why people who were Giants fans for you know decades and then with them never
[17:34.080 --> 17:36.720]  winning a Super Bowl got pretty excited about him going to the Super Bowl and
[17:36.720 --> 17:42.240]  then didn't they win the only one Giants one right guys I didn't pay
[17:42.240 --> 17:46.240]  attention but they did win right but I shows how uncool I am that I don't know
[17:46.240 --> 17:51.600]  who won the Super Bowl yes Giants one the point is is that I get it if you've
[17:51.600 --> 17:54.840]  been a fan for 20 30 years and while they finally win but a lot of people they
[17:54.840 --> 17:57.200]  just run out when oh they're going to the playoffs so looks like they're gonna
[17:57.200 --> 18:02.840]  win oh I'm a fan of that now and so Ron Paul has been the front runner for six
[18:02.840 --> 18:09.160]  months and but as the fix goes in and people seem not winning in those first
[18:09.160 --> 18:13.560]  few primaries that's why it's key to cheating there then it becomes oh well
[18:13.560 --> 18:18.560]  I'll just be for Romney and you'll see that now with Santorum Santorum clearly
[18:18.560 --> 18:23.320]  is even though I don't like him he's a globalist warmonger he has a better
[18:23.320 --> 18:27.960]  voting record constitutionally than Mitt Romney I mean at least he didn't
[18:27.960 --> 18:32.760]  promote abortion and open borders and carbon taxes he did lie about tax and
[18:32.760 --> 18:36.800]  increases and spending increases and is a warmonger and anti-liberty but I mean
[18:36.800 --> 18:41.760]  you know so is Romney so Santorum clearly with the evangelicals and
[18:41.760 --> 18:47.560]  Christians who mean well he was starting to front run right there with Ron Paul
[18:47.560 --> 18:51.920]  and so they're now gonna slap him down and he may end up being the VP with
[18:51.920 --> 18:56.760]  Romney but that's how they organize this and so when we come back from break I'll
[18:56.760 --> 19:01.360]  go to your phone calls we need to have the discussion here today about whether
[19:01.360 --> 19:08.880]  or not Ron Paul runs in a third party because even if they cheat him in that
[19:08.880 --> 19:13.520]  he will inject real issues he can force his way into the debate it can show in
[19:13.520 --> 19:17.400]  national polls he's getting 30 40% he'll get a bunch of Democrats voting for him
[19:17.400 --> 19:20.800]  as well that don't like Obama and retire the wars that other Gallup poll as you
[19:20.800 --> 19:24.400]  know yesterday and another scientific poll with two of them but one was a
[19:24.400 --> 19:29.120]  Rasmussen where he just trounces Obama better than Romney I mean you want somebody
[19:29.120 --> 19:33.000]  to beat Obama and to cut spending and actually bring a lot of our troops home
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.240]  it's Ron Paul but they're now cheating him out in the open and now the bandwagon
[19:38.240 --> 19:41.600]  effects gonna happen people wanting to be winners you're gonna actually see Ron
[19:41.600 --> 19:45.800]  Paul now start to recede and he should stay in the race because he's injecting
[19:45.800 --> 19:49.880]  issues but this is how they're doing all right we'll come right back with your
[19:49.880 --> 19:54.320]  phone calls and then I've got a bunch of news on the nanny state a new trailer

[24:46.760 --> 24:52.240]  because he's the new emperor he's saying that he can exempt you but he wanted

[24:56.160 --> 25:02.200]  actually just more of a brazen attempt to legitimize indefinite detention the

[26:35.880 --> 26:40.000]  organization for the youth manifested students for Ron Paul in the O.A.
[26:40.000 --> 26:46.920]  campaign president Obama had his a campaigning office opening in our
[26:46.920 --> 26:52.760]  county right in town in Athens yesterday so me and a few other members from
[26:52.760 --> 26:57.200]  various other libertarian organizations on campus got together got some fact
[26:57.200 --> 27:03.240]  sheets about how O equals W is what we put it at and it just says hello I
[27:03.240 --> 27:07.640]  watch that and it's it's actually we got it off the young American for Liberty
[27:07.640 --> 27:16.640]  site and it's www.yaliberty.org slash O-w slash facts and you can look it up
[27:16.640 --> 27:22.480]  right there and see it it's a pretty good fact sheet but also and we were just
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.760]  met with some venomous Obama people they were just so pissed like I'm sorry but
[27:27.760 --> 27:31.960]  they're so aggravated with us for showing up we were peaceful respectful
[27:31.960 --> 27:34.800]  they asked us to leave we said we had we completely understand private property
[27:34.800 --> 27:39.800]  rights we left we had stood out with sidewalk and hit everybody literature
[27:39.800 --> 27:43.000]  walked in and they were really upset with us and they really didn't have good
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.520]  arguments for saying why they so supported Obama they said yeah we
[27:46.520 --> 27:52.320]  agree well Obama in in Obama in Missouri and other areas has openly tried to get
[27:52.320 --> 27:55.920]  police to threaten to arrest folks if they criticize him and we've played
[27:55.920 --> 28:00.320]  clips of those newscasts it's it's so bizarre it's so authoritarian it's hard
[28:00.320 --> 28:03.440]  to believe what it's actually happening and you're saying they didn't know how
[28:03.440 --> 28:07.720]  to respond to him on the NDAA they didn't know how to respond to him on what
[28:07.720 --> 28:11.040]  launching wars without congressional approval they didn't know how to respond
[28:11.040 --> 28:15.960]  to Obama bailing out the big bankers again and again who financed him is that
[28:15.960 --> 28:20.840]  what happened well yeah and then one of the national directors that was here one
[28:20.840 --> 28:24.880]  of the three of us here tonight last night said that he agrees with Libya and
[28:24.880 --> 28:28.160]  I'm like well what about declaration of war he's just like well we have a cause
[28:28.160 --> 28:31.600]  for humanity and I'm like so do you believe in one world government and he
[28:31.600 --> 28:35.400]  said I mean I don't think it would be a bad idea to be we need to hash out more
[28:35.400 --> 28:40.120]  but it's just these kind of the point is just because they say it's loving and
[28:40.120 --> 28:43.760]  liberal you know there with one of Obama's head people opening this
[28:43.760 --> 28:49.200]  campaign office just because they say oh it's for humanity now we get to do it
[28:49.200 --> 28:54.080]  because the UN said now we ignore our laws and Congress doesn't matter I mean
[28:54.080 --> 28:58.240]  it's outrageous that they engage in treason and just say because it's for
[28:58.240 --> 29:02.520]  humanity the UN is murdering people worldwide in the name of humanity I
[29:02.520 --> 29:05.560]  appreciate your call we're gonna come back in the next long segment and take a
[29:05.560 --> 29:13.280]  whole pass of the calls but I want to talk about this NDAA it's got Utah and

[29:24.440 --> 29:28.160]  grab citizens and put bags on their heads and have them disappear to death
[29:28.160 --> 29:33.840]  camps I mean the NDAA is really woken people up and everybody I talked to this
[29:33.840 --> 29:40.040]  woke people up that's why Obama's come out and said okay I'm gonna sign a deal
[29:40.040 --> 29:43.960]  saying I won't implement this right now but you're the one that demanded the
[29:43.960 --> 29:47.760]  power it's like saying I got the gun on safety it's to your head but I'm gonna

[32:06.640 --> 32:11.200]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[32:11.200 --> 32:14.080]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[32:14.080 --> 32:18.360]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[32:18.360 --> 32:23.480]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight
[32:23.480 --> 32:28.440]  off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral

[33:01.360 --> 33:16.800]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting world-wide it's Alex Jones
[33:25.400 --> 33:30.000]  okay we're going back to your phone calls on the fact that Ron Paul what
[33:30.000 --> 33:37.120]  came in fourth in one state and third in the other and they've stolen the
[33:37.120 --> 33:40.960]  election from him in the other early primaries where he did win that's even
[33:40.960 --> 33:45.480]  come out but it's buried in the news even the New York Times said Ron Paul
[33:45.480 --> 33:50.960]  really won main but it doesn't matter because is that Republican Party
[33:50.960 --> 33:56.400]  operative said two days before the Iowa caucus he said well yeah he's the front
[33:56.400 --> 34:00.160]  runner but I've talked to all the party officials he will not be allowed to win
[34:00.160 --> 34:04.920]  and they said really so they decided she goes yep it's been decided you know
[34:04.920 --> 34:09.600]  what it was decided that's just the way it works and then a month after we told
[34:09.600 --> 34:13.400]  you it was stolen they came out and said yeah yeah it was but that's just the way
[34:13.400 --> 34:16.000]  it is and we're not gonna say what we're gonna do with these delegates now we're
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.840]  not gonna say what we're gonna do with these numbers and so what Ron Paul has
[34:19.840 --> 34:22.480]  done is just gone after the delegates because he knows they're cheating him
[34:22.480 --> 34:26.200]  and then that's how the process actually works so we're gonna see what
[34:26.200 --> 34:30.240]  happens and now there's more talk of a brokered convention and it's gonna be a
[34:30.240 --> 34:36.000]  battle so Ron Paul is not out but more and more as we move towards Super
[34:36.000 --> 34:41.080]  Tuesday and as they game things more and more they won't have to defraud Ron
[34:41.080 --> 34:45.280]  Paul because a lot of weak-minded people go well I like Ron Paul but you know
[34:45.280 --> 34:47.920]  because he's in third or fourth place why vote for him I'm gonna vote for
[34:47.920 --> 34:51.840]  Santorum I'm gonna vote for Newt Ganderich I'm gonna vote for Mitt Romney
[34:51.840 --> 34:55.920]  because they want I don't you know just throw away their vote that's kind of the
[34:55.920 --> 35:03.160]  idea but before I go back to your phone calls tonight after the nightly news on

[38:37.320 --> 38:42.760]  forward so we can finance this but here is the trailer for New World Order
[38:42.760 --> 38:46.120]  blueprint of Mad Men
[38:47.280 --> 38:53.000]  any of them could be a terrorist don't trust the public
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.200]  let's rise above their control paradigm and really see it for what it is and call
[39:03.200 --> 39:07.960]  it out you've got a better chance of dying from a honeybee sting or falling
[39:07.960 --> 39:12.120]  down to your shower than you do of being killed by terrorists it is an
[39:12.120 --> 39:17.200]  irrational fear that's been engineered into people I got a tracking I got it to
[39:17.200 --> 39:22.600]  what they told me why are you paying cash the biggest hoax in human history the
[39:22.600 --> 39:27.560]  threat of terrorists absolutely thinking of terrorists are hiding under
[39:27.560 --> 39:35.880]  every table the system itself is actually engaging in terrorism they
[39:35.880 --> 39:40.120]  tell us all they gave up our liberties because somebody might detonate a car
[39:40.120 --> 39:45.680]  bomb but meanwhile they're firing hydrogen nuclear weapons into the upper
[39:45.680 --> 39:52.480]  atmosphere our hey world has become a giant experiment by mad scientist
[39:52.480 --> 39:59.080]  weaponized airborne Ebola super weaponized viruses and bacteria that
[39:59.080 --> 40:05.560]  kill over ninety percent nine out of ten people on your street dead by the
[40:05.560 --> 40:11.080]  sword by the gun by starvation are we smart enough to learn from history
[40:11.080 --> 40:16.680]  government is the number one cause of unnatural death China the USSR Germany
[40:16.680 --> 40:22.440]  and good old pole pot it's on record for a whopping conservative total of two
[40:22.440 --> 40:27.560]  hundred and sixty two million governments winning the war against
[40:27.560 --> 40:32.840]  humanity it's amazing they admit that they're establishing a global corporate
[40:32.840 --> 40:39.000]  government to carry out genocide covertly and then you find out they're
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.120]  putting stuff in our vaccines our food our water their engineering trojan
[40:44.120 --> 40:49.880]  horse genetic traits into food that are causing organ failure and sterility and
[40:49.880 --> 40:55.920]  you've realized that a bunch of crazy psychos are in control now and become
[40:55.920 --> 41:02.000]  death the destroyer world if a black death could be spread throughout the
[41:02.000 --> 41:08.000]  world once in every generation survivors could procreate freely without
[41:08.000 --> 41:14.320]  making the world too full Bertrand Russell sick control freaks who hate
[41:14.320 --> 41:19.640]  humanity so much that they spend their every waking minute trying to think of
[41:19.640 --> 41:23.800]  ways to set up a global government so they can exterminate us and our families
[41:23.800 --> 41:31.000]  my god and their plan is so horrific they think we're too weak-minded to face
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.600]  what they've admittedly been caught doing and to resist them are you pathetic
[41:36.600 --> 41:43.320]  scum that deserves to die are you going to prove them right it's up to you
[41:46.920 --> 41:53.880]  all right folks that is the trailer for the documentary new world order blueprint
[41:53.880 --> 41:58.680]  of madmen please get that trailer out to everyone and then of course in the
[41:58.680 --> 42:02.160]  next few days when we post it for the general public please get it out to
[42:02.160 --> 42:06.560]  everyone because you know all the time now I shoot videos and we're going to
[42:06.560 --> 42:10.080]  your calls I want to talk about this as an addendum to what we just played I
[42:10.080 --> 42:15.160]  shoot videos constantly because there's new developments every day or two where
[42:15.160 --> 42:20.200]  weaponized Ebola weaponized mouse pox weaponized bird flu weaponized swine
[42:20.200 --> 42:28.240]  flu is being souped up to be airborne souped up to be able to jump into humans
[42:28.240 --> 42:32.480]  souped up to kill more than nine out of ten people that comes in contact with
[42:32.480 --> 42:39.760]  horrible painful deaths and governments are publishing how to do it with the RNA
[42:39.760 --> 42:47.480]  sequence in the case of viruses the DNA in the case of bacteria and advertising
[42:47.480 --> 42:51.840]  and in saying we're publishing this so we can develop cures for this but all
[42:51.840 --> 42:55.160]  they're doing is making a specific strain another government or quote
[42:55.160 --> 42:59.080]  terrorist or private corporate group would just slightly tweak that yet again
[42:59.080 --> 43:03.600]  and no vaccine would help and then we have an elite saying in all their white
[43:03.600 --> 43:07.960]  papers they want to engineer a bio weapon to reduce population and then use
[43:07.960 --> 43:13.120]  that crisis to get even more control over society and then I get up here and
[43:13.120 --> 43:16.640]  say I think this is the big threat and and people say no you're being a fear
[43:16.640 --> 43:21.720]  monger the threat is hijackers that killed a few hundred people a year maximum
[43:21.720 --> 43:26.000]  less than honeybees less than champagne corks I mean you know that drill I go
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.200]  over it all the time because it's true I mean I'm told give up my whole way of
[43:30.200 --> 43:33.960]  life because of terrorists and then be all fearful and the police question
[43:33.960 --> 43:38.600]  anybody you know shooting video of a bridge or a or a capital Aaron Dykes a
[43:38.600 --> 43:45.000]  couple years ago the videos online was shooting footage of the Texas Capitol so
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.560]  that he would have a cutaway shot when they went into cover hearings inside and
[43:48.560 --> 43:51.800]  the state police ran over started yelling at him saying what are you doing
[43:51.800 --> 43:57.120]  filming he said I'm with the media and Aaron said politely you know I'm here
[43:57.120 --> 44:02.240]  with the media and the cops said give me your ID and Aaron then said no I'm
[44:02.240 --> 44:06.280]  here with the tripod the camera I mean again like a terrorist would just go to
[44:06.280 --> 44:10.200]  Google Maps a terrorist would just drive by and take a photo covertly a guy out
[44:10.200 --> 44:15.600]  there in a polo shirt and jeans you know the videotaping the Capitol from the
[44:15.600 --> 44:19.800]  park grounds I mean it's ridiculous it's about teaching us we're bad and we've
[44:19.800 --> 44:28.280]  done something wrong you know did you pay cash for the coffee this is all so
[44:28.280 --> 44:31.520]  broad to make it the public can't be trusted only government can be trusted
[44:31.520 --> 44:36.240]  and the big threat is government I'm not saying they're going to release this
[44:36.240 --> 44:40.640]  flu I'm saying they're making preparations for it and and and and
[44:40.640 --> 44:46.200]  discussing how it would be helpful to reduce population I just gave you a
[44:46.200 --> 44:50.800]  quote of Bertrand Russell talking about it and this is what they're into and I
[44:50.800 --> 44:54.880]  see this as the big threat they have in level two facilities all over the
[44:54.880 --> 44:59.320]  United States and Europe and level three as well stuff that's behind glass
[44:59.320 --> 45:03.480]  doors with swipe cards that should be in underground bunkers with armed guards
[45:03.480 --> 45:09.000]  under level four with explosive fire bombs that blow up if the alarms go off
[45:09.000 --> 45:15.040]  and when a level two facility is holding level four type pathogens it's
[45:15.040 --> 45:19.800]  it's just the ultimate threat this makes nuclear weapons pale and significant
[45:19.800 --> 45:23.440]  because there's a lot less chance that Russia the US or China are gonna have a
[45:23.440 --> 45:28.000]  nuclear war than some crazy eugenicist working one of these labs is gonna sneak
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.280]  this stuff out and spread it like 12 monkeys especially when they're all a
[45:32.280 --> 45:36.000]  bunch of eugenicists on average all right I've already talked about this at
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.440]  nauseam but I I'm worried for my family I've moved out to the country because of
[45:41.440 --> 45:46.160]  this I I think this is a real threat and if we educate people and warn folks we
[45:46.160 --> 45:52.240]  may be able to avert this but if we don't we don't have a hope if we try to
[45:52.240 --> 45:56.720]  avert this Iran war it's a good chance we can stop that if we work hard but the
[45:56.720 --> 46:02.080]  system wants it so we're we're we're we're darned if we do darned if we don't
[46:02.080 --> 46:06.200]  you know if we do speak out and stop this you know oh we're fear markers you
[46:06.200 --> 46:12.920]  know fear mongers that cried wolf but if we don't and just go watch the football
[46:12.920 --> 46:17.240]  game then it it could happen and so this is what I'm concerned about this is
[46:17.240 --> 46:20.160]  what I'm worried about and the globalists say they want to release
[46:20.160 --> 46:23.440]  bioweapons that are looking at it to reduce population in so many quotes
[46:23.440 --> 46:26.520]  it'll make your head spin and they've been caught jacking the food and water
[46:26.520 --> 46:32.000]  with all sorts of stuff to soft kill us so and now they're proliferating the
[46:32.000 --> 46:38.560]  stuff everywhere and publishing how to produce it and I'm concerned about this
[46:38.560 --> 46:44.480]  now if you disagree and don't think it's a threat fine but those of us that are
[46:44.480 --> 46:49.400]  concerned need to have a debate about what we're about this okay let's go back
[46:49.400 --> 46:53.960]  to your phone calls Scott in California welcome we're discussing of course Ron
[46:53.960 --> 46:58.880]  Paul and where you see this whole election going go ahead sir yay thanks
[46:58.880 --> 47:02.440]  for taking my call I just want to agree with what you said earlier about the
[47:02.440 --> 47:06.120]  delegates and that's the thing that everybody's missing in the caucus states
[47:06.120 --> 47:09.880]  they're not bound to a specific candidate and that's where Ron Paul is
[47:09.880 --> 47:13.400]  really clean enough and that's where his campaign focus on so now's about the
[47:13.400 --> 47:17.880]  time to be thinking about packing it in or giving up or thinking about third
[47:17.880 --> 47:21.720]  point now's the time to put the phone on the gas pedal and go all the way to
[47:21.720 --> 47:25.840]  convention because those delegates can have a lot of political power there in
[47:25.840 --> 47:31.120]  the convention exactly look Ron Paul is trying to take over the Republican Party
[47:31.120 --> 47:36.280]  libertarian constitutionalist very goldwater type real conservatives are
[47:36.280 --> 47:40.160]  trying to take over the Republican Party and we can do it I mean if a bunch of
[47:40.160 --> 47:44.080]  global corporations took it over and in the past whenever there's going to be a
[47:44.080 --> 47:47.880]  good candidate that they don't want they use the delegate process to block them
[47:47.880 --> 47:51.920]  they use the delegate process to make Ronald Reagan who spoke out against the
[47:51.920 --> 47:57.680]  New World Order the trilateral Commission the CFR in 1979-1980 this was on
[47:57.680 --> 48:02.040]  record they forced him to take George Herbert Walker Bush on and then he
[48:02.040 --> 48:06.920]  basically became the shadow president especially after Reagan got shot by the
[48:06.920 --> 48:10.520]  guy that had dinner the night before with the Bush family on record look look
[48:10.520 --> 48:15.520]  that up Denver Post Washington Post you can't make up this type of weirdness and
[48:15.520 --> 48:18.880]  so we need to get in there and force issues now we're not saying we try to
[48:18.880 --> 48:23.480]  force Ron Paul on as the VP that's already been discussed but we need a
[48:23.480 --> 48:28.000]  big fracas there at the convention and we need to continue to build steps
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.200]  towards taking over not just the Republican but the Democratic parties
[48:31.200 --> 48:35.320]  there's more than one way to skin a cat and that's where we're coming from
[48:35.320 --> 48:41.520]  anything else you're getting a big Gregory it's back on the show anytime soon
[48:41.520 --> 48:44.200]  because I know that they never you did a couple years ago with him was really
[48:44.200 --> 48:49.320]  powerful but what if you get back that's a good idea Chris put that down let's
[48:49.320 --> 48:55.240]  get dick Gregory back on get his view of former confidant of course Martin
[48:55.240 --> 48:59.560]  Luther King famous civil rights activists talking about the new the New
[48:59.560 --> 49:04.280]  World Order all of it we want to get dick Gregory on the show thank you guys
[49:04.280 --> 49:08.280]  alright let's jam in one more call Scott in Idaho another Scott you're on the
[49:08.280 --> 49:14.120]  air welcome hi Alex the football analogy is a good one I don't even think we're
[49:14.120 --> 49:18.960]  at halftime yet and it meant but it may not be too early for a lot of us to go
[49:18.960 --> 49:24.120]  to YouTube and listen to the speech by a newt Rockney at halftime the famous
[49:24.120 --> 49:31.400]  football speech my understanding is that only 34 or 37 percent of the
[49:31.400 --> 49:37.520]  delegates will be apportioned out after super Tuesday so we're not even at the
[49:37.520 --> 49:42.080]  halfway point yet I believe that it's a possibility that Ron Paul may lose the
[49:42.080 --> 49:46.120]  Republican nomination I still have a great deal of faith and hope that the
[49:46.120 --> 49:50.640]  underdog can win but he's winning the bigger battle Alex for the hearts and
[49:50.640 --> 49:55.680]  minds of the Liberty-minded Americans that are waking up in exponential numbers
[49:55.680 --> 50:01.040]  I believe in this instant that that this instance that the message is far more
[50:01.040 --> 50:05.920]  important than the man I also believe that Dr. Paul has brought forward to the
[50:05.920 --> 50:11.360]  American people an idea that cannot be stopped from spreading let's think of it
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.960]  or call think of it like a Liberty virus and and that's how I see it I've
[50:16.960 --> 50:23.120]  been to Ron Paul when he was here in an unannounced stop here in Idaho at the
[50:23.120 --> 50:28.400]  University of Idaho he packed out the ballroom there were more people outside
[50:28.400 --> 50:33.560]  that didn't get inside but we're waiting for Dr. Paul when he left and I think
[50:33.560 --> 50:39.560]  that's the kind of action now listen listen he's the real front runner that's
[50:39.560 --> 50:42.560]  why he gets most the military donations that's why he was winning all the straw
[50:42.560 --> 50:48.960]  pulls they have stolen it and and I'm saying don't have your your hopes dashed
[50:48.960 --> 50:54.040]  if they start stealing and I agree we are at halftime and it is a battle of
[50:54.040 --> 50:58.800]  ideas and we are winning by being on the field we're also exposing the fraud
[50:58.800 --> 51:02.840]  we've got to engage these guys I've seen the longevity products work for many
[51:02.840 --> 51:06.160]  others and so I bought a bunch of them started using them had a little bit of
[51:06.160 --> 51:10.720]  results but I wasn't following the regimen every day but Aaron Dykes in my
[51:10.720 --> 51:15.720]  office did and lost more than 60 pounds when I saw those results I said I'd
[51:15.720 --> 51:19.520]  better follow my own advice I started taking the longevity products and it's
[51:19.520 --> 51:25.880]  been incredible 37 pounds in two months our bodies are amazing and God gave us
[51:25.880 --> 51:30.040]  an incredible gift but if our body doesn't have the tools it needs all of

[56:15.320 --> 56:18.320]  He wins by running, he has been the front runner
[56:18.320 --> 56:20.320]  He may still be the real front runner
[56:20.320 --> 56:22.320]  But I'm starting to see some numbers that show
[56:22.320 --> 56:24.320]  It may be going to Santorum and others
[56:24.320 --> 56:27.320]  With some states because people going
[56:27.320 --> 56:29.320]  Okay, well he lost in these early states
[56:29.320 --> 56:31.320]  Maybe I'll just go with who I think is a winner
[56:31.320 --> 56:34.320]  There's going to be that self-fulfilling prophecy idea
[56:34.320 --> 56:36.320]  But there is fraud
[56:36.320 --> 56:37.320]  He has been the front runner
[56:37.320 --> 56:39.320]  If you look at all the metrics
[56:39.320 --> 56:42.320]  And I just don't people getting bummed out
[56:42.320 --> 56:44.320]  Of Ron Paul doesn't get the nomination
[56:44.320 --> 56:46.320]  But it still happened
[56:46.320 --> 56:48.320]  But we're winning by injecting real issues
[56:48.320 --> 56:50.320]  So keep supporting
[56:50.320 --> 56:53.320]  Let's go ahead and talk to Keith in Indiana
[56:53.320 --> 56:55.320]  You're on the air, welcome
[56:55.320 --> 56:56.320]  Thank you very much
[56:56.320 --> 56:58.320]  I just wanted to say I'm going to be a delegate
[56:58.320 --> 57:01.320]  For Indiana at the Republican convention
[57:01.320 --> 57:03.320]  And I've only been involved in this now
[57:03.320 --> 57:05.320]  For a few weeks and around here
[57:05.320 --> 57:08.320]  You have to head to file a few weeks ago
[57:08.320 --> 57:10.320]  And apparently the argument about
[57:10.320 --> 57:12.320]  From everybody within the party itself
[57:12.320 --> 57:14.320]  Separately from the primaries
[57:14.320 --> 57:16.320]  Is that they're telling everybody that Ron Paul
[57:16.320 --> 57:20.320]  Is actually not a pure Republican
[57:20.320 --> 57:22.320]  There's a lot of people even in my area
[57:22.320 --> 57:24.320]  Who really like him who are Democrats
[57:24.320 --> 57:26.320]  And a lot of the Democrats want to switch over
[57:26.320 --> 57:28.320]  In states and vote for him
[57:28.320 --> 57:30.320]  And the Republican party is preaching this idea
[57:30.320 --> 57:34.320]  That he actually is like infecting the party
[57:34.320 --> 57:37.320]  With a disease from outside the party
[57:37.320 --> 57:39.320]  Oh no, let's be clear
[57:39.320 --> 57:41.320]  Ron Paul and Alex Jones
[57:41.320 --> 57:43.320]  And all of us and you
[57:43.320 --> 57:45.320]  Keith from Indiana, we're infecting
[57:45.320 --> 57:48.320]  The Democrats and Republicans with America
[57:48.320 --> 57:50.320]  With the Bill of Rights with common sense
[57:50.320 --> 57:52.320]  No, they're absolutely right
[57:52.320 --> 57:55.320]  They're these foreign bankers posing as patriots
[57:55.320 --> 57:57.320]  Who've taken over the Republican and Democratic parties
[57:57.320 --> 57:59.320]  Where there's no difference except in rhetoric
[57:59.320 --> 58:02.320]  Ron Paul's bringing back what made America great
[58:02.320 --> 58:04.320]  Read what he says versus the founding fathers
[58:04.320 --> 58:07.320]  It's identical and he's not really a Republican
[58:07.320 --> 58:10.320]  He's an American and the Republican party
[58:10.320 --> 58:13.320]  Is the Republican party was closer to his American beliefs
[58:13.320 --> 58:17.320]  That's why he first ran for Congress that way
[58:17.320 --> 58:19.320]  You know, 25 years ago when he first got in
[58:19.320 --> 58:21.320]  And then got kicked out and then came back
[58:21.320 --> 58:23.320]  First he ran as a libertarian
[58:23.320 --> 58:24.320]  He ran as a libertarian for president
[58:24.320 --> 58:26.320]  He's never made bones about that
[58:26.320 --> 58:29.320]  They are the usurpers, they are the pretenders
[58:29.320 --> 58:32.320]  They are the counterfeits, mad that the real deal
[58:32.320 --> 58:33.320]  Stay there, I'm gonna come right back to you
[58:33.320 --> 58:35.320]  And finish it with other callers
[58:35.320 --> 58:37.320]  But you know, we're taking over
[58:37.320 --> 58:40.320]  We're taking America back from the hijackers

[1:00:27.320 --> 1:00:31.320]  We are back now into hour number two, Foster Gamble
[1:00:31.320 --> 1:00:34.320]  The heirs of the Procter and Gamble fortune
[1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:36.320]  It has come out against the New World Order
[1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:39.320]  There's a new film out and we're gonna be talking about it
[1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:41.320]  His wife as well is involved in the film
[1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:43.320]  Kimberly Gamble
[1:00:43.320 --> 1:00:46.320]  And we are promoting the film at infowars.com
[1:00:46.320 --> 1:00:49.320]  I think it's excellent to wake up the left
[1:00:49.320 --> 1:00:52.320]  Look, the ideas of liberty and individual freedom
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:55.320]  Are infiltrating the control left and the control right
[1:00:55.320 --> 1:00:57.320]  And that's what Ron Paul's doing
[1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:59.320]  That's what he's always said
[1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:02.320]  We are in a revolution to restore the republic
[1:01:02.320 --> 1:01:04.320]  Against the globalist revolutionaries
[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:07.320]  Of corporate fascist collectivism
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:09.320]  It's very simple to understand
[1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:11.320]  Insiders who want to have an inside game
[1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:15.320]  Versus transparency
[1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:17.320]  To open free societies
[1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:20.320]  And yes, that's what Republican Party and Carl Rove say on Fox News
[1:01:20.320 --> 1:01:22.320]  Ron Paul's dangerous, he's got Democrats crossing over
[1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:25.320]  Yeah, that have woken up to the fact that Obama lied to them
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:27.320]  About ending wars and corporate bailouts
[1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:30.320]  And that Mitt Romney's bought and paid for by the same interest
[1:01:30.320 --> 1:01:32.320]  People are getting the rigged game
[1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:34.320]  And they are crossing over to support Paul
[1:01:34.320 --> 1:01:36.320]  And so the republican leadership says
[1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:38.320]  Well, we're not gonna allow that, we're gonna steal it
[1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:40.320]  And so they have been caught stealing it in multiple states
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:42.320]  They are stealing it
[1:01:42.320 --> 1:01:44.320]  He is the leader, he is the front runner
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:46.320]  He's getting all the money from the small donations
[1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:48.320]  Of the military and winning the straw polls
[1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:49.320]  And the scientific polls
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:51.320]  And he can beat Obama and all the big polls
[1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:53.320]  He's the guy, they know that
[1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:56.320]  So this is what the republican leadership is telling you in Indiana
[1:01:56.320 --> 1:01:58.320]  Is exactly what they're saying on Fox News
[1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:01.320]  Go with the real republicans
[1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:03.320]  That give us the corporate bailouts, the open borders
[1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:05.320]  The gun control, the new world order
[1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:08.320]  I mean, is that what they're basically saying, Keith?
[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:10.320]  When I've talked to people who have been through this before
[1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:12.320]  And that's what they're telling me
[1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:15.320]  The thing about it is, two quick points
[1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:18.320]  The way these conventions are set up
[1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:21.320]  The republicans I have been informed by numerous people
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:23.320]  Have the right to kind of change the rules
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:25.320]  Right up to the day of the convention
[1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:28.320]  So if you are in a state, theoretically
[1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:30.320]  That may be going to Ron Paul
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:32.320]  They have the capacity at the very top
[1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:35.320]  To re-rig the system at the actual conventions
[1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:37.320]  Before you ever get a chance to do anything
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:39.320]  Yeah, they changed the rules in 2010
[1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:41.320]  To really be able to do that, yeah
[1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:43.320]  And like in back in 2008 in Nevada
[1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:45.320]  When they were going to have a caucus
[1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:46.320]  And they just canceled it
[1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:48.320]  So I mean, these are the things they do
[1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:50.320]  The other point is you are absolutely right
[1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:52.320]  About the attitude of the public
[1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:55.320]  I was in the 2008 campaign for Ron Paul
[1:02:55.320 --> 1:02:58.320]  And I used to attend meetings for months
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:00.320]  And all of a sudden nobody started coming
[1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:02.320]  And the guy who was running them said
[1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:04.320]  The words out, Ron Paul's not going to win
[1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:07.320]  And nobody will do anything anymore
[1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:09.320]  And I think the people who run the republican party
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:12.320]  Really know that it doesn't take months
[1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:14.320]  For people to abandon a candidate
[1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:16.320]  If they suddenly decide he's not going to go anywhere
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:20.320]  I was shocked at how quickly people just leave
[1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:22.320]  I mean, they don't do anything anymore
[1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:24.320]  This time they understand it's about an idea
[1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:26.320]  As I was saying four years ago
[1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:28.320]  And Ron Paul agrees that it's about
[1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:30.320]  Growing the campaign for liberty
[1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:32.320]  It's about getting other candidates to run
[1:03:32.320 --> 1:03:33.320]  It's about injecting issues
[1:03:33.320 --> 1:03:35.320]  So from day one I've been saying
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:37.320]  The biggest show out there, as Ron Paul's pointed out
[1:03:37.320 --> 1:03:39.320]  The biggest show actually talking to Ron Paul supporters
[1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:41.320]  Hey, stay in at the long haul
[1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:43.320]  Stay in at the delegate level
[1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:45.320]  Don't let the republicans say, hey, it's over
[1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:47.320]  So I'm not saying it's over
[1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:49.320]  I'm saying they're spinning it, as you just said
[1:03:49.320 --> 1:03:52.320]  That, oh, well, he lost these early primaries
[1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:53.320]  Where they thought he would win
[1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:54.320]  Because he was the front runner
[1:03:54.320 --> 1:03:56.320]  Okay, and then you'll see that bandwagon
[1:03:56.320 --> 1:03:58.320]  Over to Romney, over to Santorum
[1:03:58.320 --> 1:03:59.320]  And that's now happening
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:02.320]  But it's not as bad as it was four years ago
[1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:04.320]  But some of the momentum is going to be lost
[1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:05.320]  So just be ready for it
[1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:08.320]  And, you know, because if you don't tell folks
[1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:10.320]  To be ready for it, just have this Kool-Aid idea
[1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:11.320]  Of, no, he's still going to win
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:14.320]  Then when he doesn't, everybody's crestfallen
[1:04:14.320 --> 1:04:17.320]  This is a long-term, long view of history
[1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:19.320]  Okay, this is not one football game
[1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:20.320]  This is not one season
[1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:23.320]  This is a whole program to use the sports analogy
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:25.320]  And our program four years ago
[1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:27.320]  Only won two games
[1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:29.320]  This time we've won, you know, 12 games
[1:04:29.320 --> 1:04:31.320]  Next time we're going to win the playoffs
[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:32.320]  And the Super Bowl
[1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:33.320]  Because we're engaging
[1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:34.320]  We're showing the fraud
[1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:36.320]  We're showing the Republican Party rigging things
[1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:38.320]  We're showing how they're sick
[1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:39.320]  We're showing Democrats
[1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:41.320]  How Obama's on the same team
[1:04:41.320 --> 1:04:43.320]  We're showing it's all a rigged game
[1:04:43.320 --> 1:04:45.320]  And it's in that process
[1:04:45.320 --> 1:04:48.320]  That we're going to really wake people up
[1:04:48.320 --> 1:04:49.320]  That it's the collectivism
[1:04:49.320 --> 1:04:52.320]  That allows the insiders to control all of us
[1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:54.320]  You end the collectivism
[1:04:54.320 --> 1:04:55.320]  Bring in a spirit of liberty
[1:04:55.320 --> 1:04:57.320]  They can't control you anymore
[1:04:57.320 --> 1:04:59.320]  It's all about making you dependent
[1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:04.320]  We'll be right back
[1:05:29.320 --> 1:05:30.320]  Number four
[1:05:30.320 --> 1:05:32.320]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:34.320]  Every year, thousands of families
[1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:36.320]  Lose their power from weather-related onages
[1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:37.320]  Number five
[1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:40.320]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[1:05:40.320 --> 1:05:41.320]  And peace of mind
[1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:43.320]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[1:05:43.320 --> 1:05:45.320]  Offered by Solutions from Science
[1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:46.320]  One of my oldest sponsors

[1:05:50.320 --> 1:05:52.320]  That's mysolarbackup.com
[1:05:52.320 --> 1:05:54.320]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun
[1:05:54.320 --> 1:05:56.320]  So go to mysolarbackup.com
[1:05:56.320 --> 1:06:00.320]  Or call 1-877-327-0365
[1:06:02.320 --> 1:06:03.320]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones
[1:06:03.320 --> 1:06:06.320]  And I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator
[1:06:06.320 --> 1:06:09.320]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[1:06:09.320 --> 1:06:12.320]  And deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[1:06:12.320 --> 1:06:15.320]  By breathing the solution through the lungs
[1:06:15.320 --> 1:06:17.320]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense
[1:06:17.320 --> 1:06:19.320]  For airborne pathogens and viruses
[1:06:19.320 --> 1:06:21.320]  The Silver Lungs Generator
[1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:23.320]  Infuses the respiratory system
[1:06:23.320 --> 1:06:25.320]  With your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[1:06:25.320 --> 1:06:28.320]  And also delivers the silver nanoparticles
[1:06:28.320 --> 1:06:30.320]  Instantly into the bloodstream
[1:06:30.320 --> 1:06:34.320]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products
[1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:38.320]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[1:06:38.320 --> 1:06:40.320]  With the Silver Lungs Generator
[1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:43.320]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided

[1:06:51.320 --> 1:06:53.320]  Of the Silver Lungs Generator
[1:06:53.320 --> 1:06:56.320]  That's www.silverlungs.com
[1:07:23.320 --> 1:07:26.320]  And now we have three that have helped me lose
[1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:30.320]  37 pounds in just two months
[1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:33.320]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:35.320]  Pollen Burst and Rebound
[1:07:35.320 --> 1:07:38.320]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day
[1:07:38.320 --> 1:07:41.320]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months
[1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:43.320]  Now that's results
[1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:45.320]  I want to challenge my listeners
[1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:47.320]  To go to infowarseteam.com
[1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:49.320]  And to order just three of their products
[1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:51.320]  And you will see the changes
[1:07:51.320 --> 1:07:55.320]  That you look, feel and in your appetite almost immediately
[1:07:55.320 --> 1:07:57.320]  Start your journey to health and wellness today
[1:07:57.320 --> 1:08:22.320]  infowarseteam.com
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:30.320]  And we'll continue with your calls on that subject
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:32.320]  And also the nanny state
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:34.320]  Which is really the heart of the globalist takeover
[1:08:34.320 --> 1:08:37.320]  I've now discovered they're trying to restrict walking on boardwalks
[1:08:37.320 --> 1:08:40.320]  Because any bumps are seen as dangerous
[1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:43.320]  And they may, well they're now moving to ban people walking on boardwalks
[1:08:43.320 --> 1:08:45.320]  I've now discovered while I've been out in Florida
[1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:48.320]  You know they've banned running
[1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:51.320]  In public schools across the United States, Europe, England
[1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:53.320]  And other nanny state control systems
[1:08:53.320 --> 1:08:56.320]  Because running, you might fall down and hurt yourself
[1:08:56.320 --> 1:09:00.320]  You, I mean, it's just a total enslavement
[1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:03.320]  Bubble boy kind of eye-robots scenario
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:06.320]  Isaac Asimov wrote about, you know, a future system
[1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:08.320]  Where the robots are there to serve humans
[1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:10.320]  But they have this directive to not do harm
[1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:12.320]  And so they basically enslave people
[1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:15.320]  Because they can't allow humans to do anything that might hurt them
[1:09:15.320 --> 1:09:18.320]  This is really at the heart of this conscious globalist
[1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:20.320]  Dehumanization that's taking place
[1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:24.320]  We'll be covering that coming up in the third hour today
[1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:28.320]  On the balance of this hour, we're going to be joined by Foster Gamble
[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:30.320]  And his wife Kimberly Gamble, both filmmakers
[1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:33.320]  Who've made the film Thrive, very well produced
[1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:35.320]  Months ago, listeners would call up and say
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:36.320]  What do you think of this?
[1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:37.320]  And I said, well I haven't seen it
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:40.320]  So I got a copy, got so busy, didn't watch it for a few weeks
[1:09:40.320 --> 1:09:42.320]  And finally did watch it
[1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:44.320]  And I think that they're coming from a place
[1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:46.320]  Of really trying to get people outside the box
[1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:48.320]  And to wake up
[1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:50.320]  And you could call it a little new agey
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:53.320]  It questions the big lie of, well are there space aliens?
[1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:55.320]  And they don't say one way or the other
[1:09:55.320 --> 1:09:58.320]  They just say, can we trust a government that's been caught lying about all this?
[1:09:58.320 --> 1:10:01.320]  And I'd say they spend maybe 5% of the two hour film on that
[1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:04.320]  Then they get into the plans to reduce population
[1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:09.320]  The cancer increasing, really hardcore things
[1:10:09.320 --> 1:10:11.320]  They get into individualism
[1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:13.320]  How that's going to empower people
[1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:15.320]  And that's seen by the liberals that see it
[1:10:15.320 --> 1:10:18.320]  Because it's kind of tailored for classical liberals out there
[1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:20.320]  That's what's really shocking to them
[1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:22.320]  For us that are constitutionalists
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:24.320]  That's not shocking
[1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:26.320]  So the film really, I would say is tailored
[1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:28.320]  For kind of mainline liberals
[1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:30.320]  That are well meaning people and don't understand
[1:10:30.320 --> 1:10:33.320]  From kind of an Alex Jones or Ron Paul perspective
[1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:35.320]  Why liberty is so important
[1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:38.320]  And it gets into alternative energies that have been suppressed
[1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:40.320]  And the fact that that is going on
[1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:42.320]  It's really a revolutionary film
[1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:44.320]  Now obviously
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:46.320]  Some of it
[1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:49.320]  I don't 100% endorse or believe in
[1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:51.320]  But I think it's really good to get people thinking
[1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:53.320]  And it's a good way to break the ice
[1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:56.320]  And to get conservatives to kind of understand
[1:10:56.320 --> 1:10:58.320]  A kind of libertarian liberal perspective
[1:10:58.320 --> 1:11:01.320]  And also wake up mainline liberals
[1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:03.320]  So that's why I made the decision to carry the film
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:06.320]  Thrive, it's now available at infowars.com
[1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:09.320]  It's also available on their site
[1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:13.320]  Films like Zeitgeist, the first one came out
[1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:15.320]  And of course I wasn't involved in it
[1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:16.320]  And I wasn't asked to be involved
[1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:17.320]  I used a lot of my material
[1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:19.320]  People got mad at me
[1:11:19.320 --> 1:11:22.320]  Because it's really an anti-Christian, anti-religion film
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:24.320]  At first, then it gets into the Federal Reserve
[1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:25.320]  The New World Order
[1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:27.320]  So I agree with two thirds of the first site guys
[1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:29.320]  One third of it is attacking people that have faith
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:31.320]  Or a spiritual consciousness
[1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:32.320]  Thrive doesn't do that
[1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:33.320]  So I like it a lot more
[1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:35.320]  Because I've had spiritual experiences
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:37.320]  I have a relationship with my creator
[1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:39.320]  I don't judge others that are in other religions
[1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:40.320]  And have had their experiences
[1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:43.320]  I know that something's going on out there
[1:11:43.320 --> 1:11:45.320]  And so it gets a little bit into that too
[1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:48.320]  So it's really about expanding your awareness
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:50.320]  And I think overall it's a wholesome film
[1:11:50.320 --> 1:11:52.320]  And I think the filmmakers are in the right direction
[1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:54.320]  You know, I kind of half-cocked
[1:11:54.320 --> 1:11:55.320]  When people were calling and talking about it
[1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:57.320]  I said, Foster Gamble, the Gamble
[1:11:57.320 --> 1:11:58.320]  That's New World Order
[1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:00.320]  Well, I bet it is, you know, this or that
[1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:02.320]  And they kind of sent nice emails saying
[1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:03.320]  Well, Alex, we think more of you
[1:12:03.320 --> 1:12:04.320]  You should actually look at this
[1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:06.320]  So they didn't really lash out at me
[1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:08.320]  When I was not really half-cocked
[1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:10.320]  I said, oh, it might be positive
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:11.320]  I got to see it, but you know
[1:12:11.320 --> 1:12:13.320]  A little I'll find out
[1:12:13.320 --> 1:12:14.320]  Because I'm always a jaundice eye
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:16.320]  On anything coming from the left
[1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:17.320]  Now, they come out with other films down the road
[1:12:17.320 --> 1:12:19.320]  And start getting globalist on us
[1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:21.320]  Then I'll say, oh, well, it's like Zeitgeist
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:22.320]  The first one's okay
[1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:23.320]  And then it gets, you know
[1:12:23.320 --> 1:12:25.320]  We're all going to live in plastic cities
[1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:27.320]  And be reeducated
[1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:28.320]  But enough of me
[1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:30.320]  There were just the next 45 minutes
[1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:31.320]  Till the end of the hour
[1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:34.320]  And I appreciate the Gamble's coming on
[1:12:34.320 --> 1:12:36.320]  Foster, Kimberly
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:38.320]  Tell us about your awakening
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:40.320]  And then I want to get into the free energy
[1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:42.320]  You know, how you woke up to 9-11
[1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:44.320]  You know, inside job false flags
[1:12:44.320 --> 1:12:46.320]  Just the full spectrum you're covering
[1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:48.320]  Because this film is really waking up
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:50.320]  Kind of mainline liberals out there
[1:12:50.320 --> 1:12:52.320]  That we're unable to reach
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:54.320]  And I think it's valuable for that reason
[1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:55.320]  Good to have you with us
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:12:58.320]  Thank you, it's great to be on here with you, Alex
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:00.320]  For my, speaking for myself
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:03.320]  It was really when I left college
[1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:05.320]  And started to go out into the world
[1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:09.320]  And realized that we were invading Cambodia
[1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:11.320]  For no good reason that I could understand
[1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:14.320]  And we were destroying a lot of the environment
[1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:16.320]  Without people being prosecuted
[1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:20.320]  And we were at the risk of nuclear holocaust
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:23.320]  I came to the realization that maybe
[1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:25.320]  The so-called adults in charge
[1:13:25.320 --> 1:13:26.320]  Don't really know what they're doing
[1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:28.320]  Or at least they don't have our best interests in mind
[1:13:28.320 --> 1:13:31.320]  So I started going after the question
[1:13:31.320 --> 1:13:33.320]  What is in the way of our thriving
[1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:35.320]  And the best way I knew to do it at the time
[1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:38.320]  Was through science and through consciousness
[1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:41.320]  I thought it was just a, you know, a function of world view
[1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:43.320]  And then we just needed to become more awake and so forth
[1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:48.320]  And then along the lines of my research
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:52.320]  I started getting more into following the money
[1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:56.320]  And into the notion that maybe this agenda
[1:13:56.320 --> 1:13:59.320]  Was actually somebody's intentional plan
[1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:03.320]  To benefit a few at the expense of the rest of us
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:06.320]  And that's where really you became one of my major teachers
[1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:08.320]  You know, you've been a hero for me
[1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:10.320]  And a whole lot of my friends and my team
[1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:13.320]  For the last, you know, 12, 15 years
[1:14:13.320 --> 1:14:18.320]  And the reliability of your predictions
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:20.320]  Not only your information, but your predictions
[1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:24.320]  Just kept you as one of my primary news feeds
[1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:25.320]  Every day
[1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:28.320]  So people like you and David Ike and Jim Mars and others
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:31.320]  Who just kept tying the different pieces together
[1:14:31.320 --> 1:14:34.320]  In a way that makes so much more sense to me
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:36.320]  Than what I was getting from the corporate media
[1:14:36.320 --> 1:14:39.320]  That I just really went down that rabbit hole
[1:14:39.320 --> 1:14:41.320]  And thank goodness they did
[1:14:41.320 --> 1:14:43.320]  Well, you've made a great film
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:46.320]  And go ahead, Kimberly
[1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:48.320]  I just wanted to say that for me
[1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:51.320]  It was really important to do a lot of my own research
[1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:54.320]  Because the story made more sense that you were telling
[1:14:54.320 --> 1:14:56.320]  But one of the things that I did was
[1:14:56.320 --> 1:14:58.320]  We hired an independent fact checker
[1:14:58.320 --> 1:15:00.320]  To corroborate everything as we were putting it together
[1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:01.320]  For the movie
[1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:03.320]  And it was one of the ways we could find out
[1:15:03.320 --> 1:15:06.320]  Whose information really was most accurate
[1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:09.320]  And I have to say, the information that we got from you
[1:15:09.320 --> 1:15:11.320]  And the films that you were putting out
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:14.320]  Always came back corroborated
[1:15:14.320 --> 1:15:17.320]  So you became a really important source for me too
[1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:20.320]  And I consider us real allies in this
[1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:22.320]  Because I know my intention in making Tribe
[1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:25.320]  Was to create a tool so that the people who
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:27.320]  Are already aware of what's going on
[1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:29.320]  Would have something to be able to share with people
[1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:31.320]  Who have been more resistant
[1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:33.320]  So thanks
[1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:34.320]  Well, thank you
[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:36.320]  You're very effective because it covers a wide spectrum
[1:15:36.320 --> 1:15:38.320]  Of what people are questioning
[1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:42.320]  And it just basically discusses alternative
[1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:44.320]  Paths to what we're going down
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:47.320]  Because we know the path we're going down is pure madness
[1:15:47.320 --> 1:15:50.320]  Even though the controllers think they have a method
[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:52.320]  It's really a blind spot
[1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:54.320]  And I think the leader can destroy themselves
[1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:58.320]  I mean, undoubtedly the direction we're going is destructive
[1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:01.320]  Let's start breaking down the film Thrive itself
[1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:03.320]  Do you agree with my perspective that
[1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:05.320]  This is something I see that's really going to be good
[1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:07.320]  For waking up people on the traditional left
[1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:11.320]  That kind of hear a gruff, you know, wild libertarian
[1:16:11.320 --> 1:16:13.320]  And kind of get turned off
[1:16:13.320 --> 1:16:15.320]  Well, we've certainly been in that conversation a lot
[1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:18.320]  We didn't specifically make it for that audience
[1:16:18.320 --> 1:16:20.320]  But we did have a strong intention
[1:16:20.320 --> 1:16:23.320]  To bridge together lots of different fractions
[1:16:23.320 --> 1:16:25.320]  From the left and from the right
[1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:27.320]  From science and consciousness
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:29.320]  From liberty and justice
[1:16:29.320 --> 1:16:31.320]  From energy to UFOs
[1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:33.320]  And I'm delighted to say that in the interviews
[1:16:33.320 --> 1:16:35.320]  We're getting a chance to do
[1:16:35.320 --> 1:16:38.320]  It's actually a remarkably similar conversation
[1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:41.320]  That we're having no matter whether it's in the UFO
[1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:44.320]  The economics, conspiracy, realm
[1:16:44.320 --> 1:16:47.320]  Because what we're finding is the common denominators
[1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:49.320]  Are what's really going on in the world
[1:16:49.320 --> 1:16:52.320]  Because everybody is wanting to know that now
[1:16:52.320 --> 1:16:54.320]  Or just about everybody
[1:16:54.320 --> 1:16:56.320]  And secondly, what are the principles
[1:16:56.320 --> 1:16:58.320]  By which we can get out of this
[1:16:58.320 --> 1:17:00.320]  Rather than the politics, what are the principles
[1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:02.320]  And that's where the liberty conversation
[1:17:02.320 --> 1:17:06.320]  Is just emerging, you know, like a geyser right now
[1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:08.320]  Well, it is. It's spreading
[1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:12.320]  Like the white blood cells countering the virus
[1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:14.320]  Or the infection
[1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:17.320]  And undoubtedly, I mean, everyone knows this internally
[1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:19.320]  It's a basic truth
[1:17:19.320 --> 1:17:21.320]  There is a major shift happening
[1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:23.320]  The old order is panicking
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:25.320]  It's not really a new world order
[1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:26.320]  It's an old order
[1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:28.320]  And all of this tyranny we're seeing coming to the surface
[1:17:28.320 --> 1:17:31.320]  Is an attempt to suppress the awakening we're seeing
[1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:33.320]  I don't really get people saying
[1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:35.320]  Oh, you're full of it anymore like I used to
[1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:37.320]  They just say, okay, what are you gonna do?
[1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:39.320]  So I think it's more about giving solutions
[1:17:39.320 --> 1:17:40.320]  And that's what you're doing
[1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:41.320]  Is that what you're saying?
[1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:43.320]  That's exactly what we're doing
[1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:45.320]  You know, people like you and David
[1:17:45.320 --> 1:17:47.320]  I have done such a masterful job of, you know
[1:17:47.320 --> 1:17:49.320]  Being the Paul Revere's for people
[1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:51.320]  And letting people know that there's something
[1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:54.320]  Really heavy coming down if we don't do something about it
[1:17:54.320 --> 1:17:56.320]  So we've been able to stand on the shoulders
[1:17:56.320 --> 1:17:58.320]  Of that kind of work
[1:17:58.320 --> 1:18:00.320]  And then take the time in our documentary
[1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:02.320]  To stitch together so many dots
[1:18:02.320 --> 1:18:05.320]  Into the two hours
[1:18:05.320 --> 1:18:07.320]  But really then to guide people
[1:18:07.320 --> 1:18:09.320]  To the solution section
[1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:11.320]  And we thought we were gonna have to spend six months
[1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:13.320]  To a year just arguing about
[1:18:13.320 --> 1:18:15.320]  Whether the Federal Reserve was federal
[1:18:15.320 --> 1:18:17.320]  Or whether or not there's some kind of intentional conspiracy
[1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:19.320]  But it's not that way at all
[1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:21.320]  People are going, okay, all right, we get it
[1:18:21.320 --> 1:18:23.320]  Even if we didn't before, now we're getting it
[1:18:23.320 --> 1:18:26.320]  And what can we do about it?
[1:18:26.320 --> 1:18:28.320]  And I'm happy to say that there are already
[1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:31.320]  Just in three months, there are hundreds
[1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:35.320]  Of self-creating, thrive-inspired
[1:18:35.320 --> 1:18:38.320]  Solutions groups now meeting
[1:18:38.320 --> 1:18:40.320]  In cities, states, and countries
[1:18:40.320 --> 1:18:43.320]  All over the world taking this film
[1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:46.320]  And using some of the solution suggestions
[1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:49.320]  That we suggest and dividing by sector
[1:18:49.320 --> 1:18:51.320]  So some people take on the governance
[1:18:51.320 --> 1:18:53.320]  Others are justice, others are media
[1:18:53.320 --> 1:18:55.320]  Others are education or environment
[1:18:55.320 --> 1:18:58.320]  And then using an organizational model
[1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:00.320]  That we're offering to try to coordinate
[1:19:00.320 --> 1:19:02.320]  Their actions not only locally
[1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:05.320]  But nationally and also globally
[1:19:05.320 --> 1:19:07.320]  Well, that's what really worries the system
[1:19:07.320 --> 1:19:09.320]  Is people getting past the left-right paradigm
[1:19:09.320 --> 1:19:12.320]  And all these labels and really realizing
[1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:14.320]  Hey, we're all in this together
[1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:16.320]  We better take control of the system
[1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:19.320]  Away from these crazies and start reversing things
[1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:21.320]  But we don't have any future
[1:19:21.320 --> 1:19:23.320]  And I think it's because the danger is so great
[1:19:23.320 --> 1:19:25.320]  Everybody instinctively or in their gut
[1:19:25.320 --> 1:19:27.320]  Their spirit, whatever you want to call it
[1:19:27.320 --> 1:19:29.320]  Knows we're two minutes to midnight
[1:19:29.320 --> 1:19:31.320]  And I think we're going to see a lot of people
[1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:32.320]  In the power structure itself
[1:19:32.320 --> 1:19:34.320]  Already seeing that realize that it's
[1:19:34.320 --> 1:19:36.320]  This system is going in the wrong direction
[1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:37.320]  We've got to change it
[1:19:37.320 --> 1:19:39.320]  I want to get your perspective on that
[1:19:39.320 --> 1:19:41.320]  And talk about some subsections of the film
[1:19:41.320 --> 1:19:43.320]  Alternative energy and more
[1:19:43.320 --> 1:19:45.320]  With the makers of the film, Thrive

[1:20:17.320 --> 1:20:19.320]  Power generators are now available
[1:20:19.320 --> 1:20:21.320]  From our friends at Solutions from Science
[1:20:21.320 --> 1:20:23.320]  One of our oldest sponsors
[1:20:23.320 --> 1:20:25.320]  Their emergency backup systems provide
[1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:27.320]  Life-saving electrical power when you need it most
[1:20:27.320 --> 1:20:30.320]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly
[1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:34.320]  Amids no fumes and produces electricity from the sun
[1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:36.320]  It's like having an electric power plant
[1:20:36.320 --> 1:20:38.320]  Running quietly in your own own
[1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:40.320]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts
[1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:42.320]  You'll never have to suffer through
[1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:44.320]  Painful power outages again
[1:20:44.320 --> 1:20:46.320]  When the power goes out this winter
[1:20:46.320 --> 1:20:49.320]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science
[1:20:49.320 --> 1:20:51.320]  Go to MySolarBackup.com

[1:21:03.320 --> 1:21:06.320]  By an intruder with a single kick
[1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:08.320]  That's the sound of the same door
[1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:10.320]  Now protected by the door sentinel
[1:21:10.320 --> 1:21:12.320]  At MySafeDoor.com
[1:21:12.320 --> 1:21:14.320]  Go to MySafeDoor.com right now

[1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:23.320]  16 kicks later
[1:21:23.320 --> 1:21:26.320]  And the door sentinel is still holding strong

[1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:55.320]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:21:55.320 --> 1:22:02.320]  Hey there, you've reached Claire.
[1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:03.320]  Leave me a message.
[1:22:03.320 --> 1:22:04.320]  Claire, it's Anne.
[1:22:04.320 --> 1:22:06.320]  Hey, you know that hormone balancing product
[1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:07.320]  We talked about before?
[1:22:07.320 --> 1:22:08.320]  The all-natural one.
[1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:09.320]  Ambron?
[1:22:09.320 --> 1:22:10.320]  Well, I gotta tell you this.
[1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:13.320]  Not only did Ambron stop my hot flashes
[1:22:13.320 --> 1:22:15.320]  But since I started the Ambron program
[1:22:15.320 --> 1:22:17.320]  I have lost so much weight.
[1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:19.320]  Seriously, even my belly fat.
[1:22:19.320 --> 1:22:20.320]  It's gone.
[1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:22.320]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:23.320]  I feel great.
[1:22:23.320 --> 1:22:24.320]  Give me a call.
[1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:26.320]  The main cause of weight gain in women over 40
[1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:27.320]  Is hormonal imbalance.
[1:22:27.320 --> 1:22:29.320]  Until you balance your hormones
[1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:31.320]  It can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[1:22:31.320 --> 1:22:34.320]  Ambron restores hormonal balance naturally
[1:22:34.320 --> 1:22:36.320]  So the weight can just fall off.
[1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:38.320]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:41.320]  Plus, Ambron eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too.
[1:22:41.320 --> 1:22:43.320]  So with your hormones in balance
[1:22:43.320 --> 1:22:44.320]  You can feel great.
[1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:46.320]  And finally lose the weight.

[1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:02.320]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead,
[1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:04.320]  Founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[1:23:04.320 --> 1:23:06.320]  I designed our top-selling holster,
[1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:08.320]  The Super Tucked Deluxe,
[1:23:08.320 --> 1:23:10.320]  To solve the problems of being poked,
[1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:12.320]  Pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:15.320]  The Super Tucked Deluxe is the most comfortable,
[1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:18.320]  Most concealable holster on the market today.
[1:23:18.320 --> 1:23:21.320]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[1:23:30.320 --> 1:23:32.320]  In a coming apart world,
[1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:34.320]  You need something to keep it tied together.

[1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:40.320]  From exotic braids for military,

[1:24:13.320 --> 1:24:15.320]  I'll be frank, I don't fear the Reaper.
[1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:17.320]  I'm not in a hurry to die.
[1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:19.320]  But I do fear
[1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:21.320]  Democide, government killing populations,
[1:24:21.320 --> 1:24:23.320]  Humanities, genetics being damaged
[1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:25.320]  By all the toxic waste and manipulation
[1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:27.320]  And GMO, our DNA is changing.
[1:24:27.320 --> 1:24:29.320]  We are mutating for the worse.
[1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:31.320]  The heavy metals, all of it.
[1:24:31.320 --> 1:24:33.320]  I do fear for future generations
[1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:35.320]  Because I know I'm part of a larger species.
[1:24:35.320 --> 1:24:37.320]  And I do care about humanity.
[1:24:37.320 --> 1:24:39.320]  I don't hate humanity.
[1:24:39.320 --> 1:24:41.320]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up
[1:24:41.320 --> 1:24:43.320]  To really get into the film.
[1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:45.320]  But Foster Gamble and Kimberly Gamble
[1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:47.320]  Have put together the film Thrive
[1:24:47.320 --> 1:24:49.320]  And you can go to their website
[1:24:49.320 --> 1:24:51.320]  That we have linked on infowars.com
[1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:53.320]  And see their solutions area.
[1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:55.320]  And a lot more and they can give that to you
[1:24:55.320 --> 1:24:57.320]  Here on air as well.
[1:24:57.320 --> 1:24:59.320]  But what section, because you cover so much
[1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:01.320]  Of the film, should we get into first?
[1:25:01.320 --> 1:25:03.320]  How about the alternative energy being suppressed?
[1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:05.320]  I mean, there's really strong evidence there.
[1:25:05.320 --> 1:25:07.320]  I mean, that is going on.
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:09.320]  That's probably the area that we're getting
[1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:11.320]  The strongest response to from all over the world.
[1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:13.320]  Because we're really inviting people to
[1:25:13.320 --> 1:25:15.320]  Indicate
[1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:17.320]  Their
[1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:19.320]  Intention to
[1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:21.320]  Join what we call a critical mass action.
[1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:23.320]  Where people say I'll show up
[1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:25.320]  For a demonstration if there's enough people
[1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:27.320]  Or I'll contribute money
[1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:29.320]  Or I'll invest in a company to get these
[1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:31.320]  Technologies out.
[1:25:31.320 --> 1:25:33.320]  And we're getting many responses a day
[1:25:33.320 --> 1:25:35.320]  From scientists, inventors
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:37.320]  And potential funders from all over the world
[1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:39.320]  Saying, you know, the evidence is pretty compelling
[1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:41.320]  That this is real.
[1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:43.320]  I mean, after all, why would all these guys
[1:25:43.320 --> 1:25:45.320]  Be getting their labs rated
[1:25:45.320 --> 1:25:47.320]  And their equipment stolen
[1:25:47.320 --> 1:25:49.320]  And their patents shut down if it was just
[1:25:49.320 --> 1:25:51.320]  A bunch of charlatans and hoaxers.
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:53.320]  So I'm very excited about the
[1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:55.320]  The FBI rating Tesla right after he died.
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:25:57.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:25:57.320 --> 1:25:59.320]  I mean, look at the FBI rating
[1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:01.320]  Right after he died. And expanding.
[1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:03.320]  We know about General Motors
[1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:05.320]  And Ford patents on gasoline
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:07.320]  And diesel engines that were getting
[1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:09.320]  70, 80 miles a gallon 30, 40 years ago.
[1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:11.320]  There's all sorts of basic stuff
[1:26:11.320 --> 1:26:13.320]  That we know they've suppressed. Sorry, go ahead.
[1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:15.320]  Yeah, and also one of the things
[1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:17.320]  Is that we dubbed Thrive in
[1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:19.320]  Nine different languages besides English
[1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:21.320]  And people have actually taken it upon
[1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:23.320]  Themselves and added subtitles
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:25.320]  For, you know, Portuguese
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:27.320]  And Greek. And so it's out
[1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:29.320]  There in the world and one of the things we're doing
[1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:31.320]  Is hearing back from people all over the world
[1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:33.320]  About what they know about free energy
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:35.320]  Technology too. So in addition to having
[1:26:35.320 --> 1:26:37.320]  This cross-pollination between
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:39.320]  The different issues and topics
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:41.320]  That are coming up in Thrive, it also
[1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:43.320]  Is getting cross-pollinated globally.
[1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:45.320]  So it's been really exciting that way.
[1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:49.320]  Well, free energy would bring down
[1:26:49.320 --> 1:26:51.320]  This current system that would empower humanity.
[1:26:51.320 --> 1:26:53.320]  I mean, that's a no-brainer.
[1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:55.320]  Get into some of the evidence they're suppressing.
[1:26:57.320 --> 1:26:59.320]  Well, I've been blessed along
[1:26:59.320 --> 1:27:01.320]  With Kimberly to be able to have visited
[1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:03.320]  Some of these laboratories and some of the inventors.
[1:27:03.320 --> 1:27:05.320]  Some of who are in the film
[1:27:05.320 --> 1:27:07.320]  And some aren't.
[1:27:07.320 --> 1:27:09.320]  So all but one of them have been shut down.
[1:27:11.320 --> 1:27:13.320]  So I've seen these people. I've talked to them.
[1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:15.320]  I've seen the look in their eyes.
[1:27:15.320 --> 1:27:17.320]  Their spouses are terrified.
[1:27:17.320 --> 1:27:19.320]  Their lives have been threatened.
[1:27:19.320 --> 1:27:21.320]  Literally, the doors get banged down.
[1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:23.320]  The FBI SWAT team comes in and starts taking
[1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:25.320]  All the equipment and telling them
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:27.320]  If they even talk about it.
[1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:29.320]  They'll take them out of the game.
[1:27:29.320 --> 1:27:31.320]  So it's a very intense and very real situation.
[1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:35.320]  That's why there's so much safety in numbers now
[1:27:35.320 --> 1:27:37.320]  Bringing this up and it's one of the reasons
[1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:39.320]  That we made the commitment to doing that in the film
[1:27:39.320 --> 1:27:41.320]  Is to just bring it out in the open.
[1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:43.320]  Have that conversation so that, like you're seeing
[1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:45.320]  With so many other things, as people get engaged
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:47.320]  It just gets harder and harder to stop.
[1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:51.320]  I mean, if we did have free energy
[1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:53.320]  Or even the stuff they admit exists
[1:27:53.320 --> 1:27:55.320]  The better forms of energy, there goes war right there.
[1:27:55.320 --> 1:27:57.320]  There goes the biggest resource problem we've got.
[1:27:57.320 --> 1:27:59.320]  There is the empowerment
[1:27:59.320 --> 1:28:01.320]  As we can educate and lift people up.
[1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:03.320]  There is all the answers right there.
[1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:05.320]  Imagine the prosperity in this country
[1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:07.320]  If you had minimal
[1:28:07.320 --> 1:28:09.320]  Or no energy bills
[1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:11.320]  And we had an honest money system
[1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:13.320]  So many of the rest of these
[1:28:13.320 --> 1:28:15.320]  Big government problems
[1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:17.320]  Would go away
[1:28:17.320 --> 1:28:19.320]  If people were simply allowed to
[1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:21.320]  Access energy that
[1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:23.320]  Inexpensively and not to be robbed
[1:28:23.320 --> 1:28:25.320]  By the Federal Reserve system.
[1:28:25.320 --> 1:28:27.320]  Wow, and it's all covered in
[1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:29.320]  Thrive. I know you guys
[1:28:29.320 --> 1:28:31.320]  Have several big sites. What's the best one
[1:28:31.320 --> 1:28:33.320]  For people to visit to learn more?
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:35.320]  privemovement.com

[1:28:37.320 --> 1:28:39.320]  You can get right to all of the solutions

[1:29:25.320 --> 1:29:27.320]  Over the world
[1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:29.320]  That's amazing
[1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:31.320]  We're going to be going to Australia

[1:29:39.320 --> 1:29:41.320]  Is the way we set up our whole solution
[1:29:41.320 --> 1:29:43.320]  Strategy and that is what's important

[1:32:11.320 --> 1:32:13.320]  Diamond Gussets
[1:32:13.320 --> 1:32:15.320]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[1:32:15.320 --> 1:32:17.320]  Where they make

[1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:35.320]  New World Order
[1:33:35.320 --> 1:33:37.320]  Blueprint of Mad Men
[1:33:37.320 --> 1:33:39.320]  40 minute documentary
[1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:41.320]  It deals with
[1:33:41.320 --> 1:33:43.320]  The facts we are told
[1:33:43.320 --> 1:33:45.320]  Give up all our rights because of terrorism
[1:33:45.320 --> 1:33:47.320]  It is essentially a non-existent
[1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:49.320]  Fear like the boogeyman
[1:33:49.320 --> 1:33:51.320]  To be killed by terrorists
[1:33:51.320 --> 1:33:53.320]  Even if you lived in Egypt or Israel
[1:33:53.320 --> 1:33:55.320]  Is one in a million
[1:33:55.320 --> 1:33:57.320]  Plus we have all the government's numbers
[1:33:57.320 --> 1:33:59.320]  Compared to
[1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:01.320]  All the other things happening
[1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:03.320]  It's several hundred places down in probability
[1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:05.320]  But they are saying give up all your rights
[1:34:05.320 --> 1:34:07.320]  It's a clear system
[1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:09.320]  To bring in authoritarian control
[1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:11.320]  It's a clear excuse
[1:34:11.320 --> 1:34:13.320]  That said everybody is getting really excited
[1:34:13.320 --> 1:34:15.320]  Because I haven't made a film in over a year and a half
[1:34:15.320 --> 1:34:17.320]  This is not one of my big official films
[1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:19.320]  It's going to be free
[1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:21.320]  Everybody is saying where do I get the DVD
[1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:23.320]  It's going to be free
[1:34:23.320 --> 1:34:27.320]  The DVD members will see it premiere tonight first
[1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:29.320]  It will be up this evening and after it goes on the news
[1:34:29.320 --> 1:34:31.320]  Post it as an mp4 for everybody
[1:34:31.320 --> 1:34:33.320]  And then the next few days I will put it on one of our YouTube channels
[1:34:33.320 --> 1:34:35.320]  We have our own system because
[1:34:35.320 --> 1:34:37.320]  We are always getting censored on other people's websites
[1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:39.320]  So we have to have our own system
[1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:41.320]  Members that pay it forward
[1:34:41.320 --> 1:34:43.320]  Pay us 15 cents a day or whatever
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:45.320]  You fund us making things like this
[1:34:45.320 --> 1:34:47.320]  But this is important
[1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:49.320]  New World Order blueprint of Mad Men
[1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:51.320]  You've got to know
[1:34:51.320 --> 1:34:53.320]  That people are ready to try to have a debate
[1:34:53.320 --> 1:34:55.320]  And a discussion about a new system
[1:34:55.320 --> 1:34:57.320]  Now talking about our guests that are on with us
[1:34:57.320 --> 1:35:01.320]  You can get the Thrive film at infowars.com
[1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:03.320]  And get a free Citizen Rolebook while you're at it
[1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:05.320]  Or you can go to their site and get it
[1:35:05.320 --> 1:35:07.320]  Regardless, get it and show it to people in your area
[1:35:07.320 --> 1:35:09.320]  Just like you can do with my films
[1:35:09.320 --> 1:35:11.320]  So they understand what's happening
[1:35:11.320 --> 1:35:13.320]  But people are starting to wake up
[1:35:13.320 --> 1:35:15.320]  Now we've got to give them solutions
[1:35:15.320 --> 1:35:17.320]  And this film covers problems but also solutions
[1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:19.320]  That's why I like it
[1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:21.320]  The terms in the film, like sustainability
[1:35:21.320 --> 1:35:23.320]  In our community, people go, sustainability
[1:35:23.320 --> 1:35:25.320]  That's a U-Engine 21 term
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:27.320]  The globalists take every term
[1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:29.320]  And then they
[1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:31.320]  Use real problems
[1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:33.320]  And then offer their bad solution
[1:35:33.320 --> 1:35:35.320]  That gives them more power, like pay Al Gore to breathe
[1:35:35.320 --> 1:35:37.320]  And that'll fix the problem
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:39.320]  No, I'm not worried about carbon dioxide
[1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:41.320]  I'm worried about GMO
[1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:43.320]  Literally spreading into the entire biosphere
[1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:45.320]  Ruining and wrecking all animal and human
[1:35:45.320 --> 1:35:47.320]  And mammal DNA
[1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:49.320]  Comes in contact with in the big public studies
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:51.320]  This is already happening
[1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:53.320]  The heavy metals, they add into the water
[1:35:53.320 --> 1:35:55.320]  Under the name of fluorine
[1:35:55.320 --> 1:35:57.320]  It's wrecking our DNA
[1:35:57.320 --> 1:35:59.320]  Deformities, all sorts of
[1:35:59.320 --> 1:36:01.320]  Chromosomal diseases that were incredibly rare
[1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:03.320]  Are becoming commonplace
[1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:05.320]  Neurological disorders, you know the numbers
[1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:07.320]  The film covers this
[1:36:07.320 --> 1:36:09.320]  And does it in a very good way
[1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:11.320]  Again, it's just for the general public
[1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:13.320]  It's well done
[1:36:13.320 --> 1:36:15.320]  But I wanted to bring this
[1:36:15.320 --> 1:36:17.320]  Up, because when I first had
[1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:19.320]  Listeners saying, you gotta see this
[1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:21.320]  It's got a lot of good solutions
[1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:23.320]  And sounds really good, but then it talks about sustainability
[1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:25.320]  Well, in Austin
[1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:27.320]  People started getting chickens in their own yards
[1:36:27.320 --> 1:36:29.320]  Which was legal and lawful
[1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:31.320]  Now the Austin has come in
[1:36:31.320 --> 1:36:33.320]  With a law to try to restrict it
[1:36:33.320 --> 1:36:35.320]  This is the big U.N. run city
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:37.320]  Where I live
[1:36:37.320 --> 1:36:39.320]  Not there today, I'm in Baton Rouge
[1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:41.320]  All over the country, they're trying to stop backyard gardens
[1:36:41.320 --> 1:36:43.320]  Front yard gardens
[1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:45.320]  Virals aren't in virus
[1:36:45.320 --> 1:36:47.320]  They're trying to seize control
[1:36:47.320 --> 1:36:49.320]  Now I know I'm ranting here, the point is
[1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:51.320]  Is that there's real sustainability
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:53.320]  I've moved out in the country, got a water well, a garden
[1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:55.320]  And a wall around my house
[1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:57.320]  That's sustainability for my family
[1:36:57.320 --> 1:36:59.320]  That's being self-sufficient
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:01.320]  When they say sustainability
[1:37:01.320 --> 1:37:03.320]  They mean cutting off your resources
[1:37:03.320 --> 1:37:05.320]  So do you guys want to explain that
[1:37:05.320 --> 1:37:07.320]  Because you use some of the terms
[1:37:07.320 --> 1:37:09.320]  That the global issues, of course they use all the terms
[1:37:09.320 --> 1:37:11.320]  And
[1:37:11.320 --> 1:37:13.320]  Try to take all the good
[1:37:13.320 --> 1:37:15.320]  And ask them for their own meaning
[1:37:15.320 --> 1:37:17.320]  But I want to be very clear with people
[1:37:17.320 --> 1:37:19.320]  And I think being sustainable
[1:37:19.320 --> 1:37:21.320]  Is critical, but what we're recommending
[1:37:21.320 --> 1:37:23.320]  Is the farthest thing from
[1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:25.320]  The Agenda 21 meaning of that
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:27.320]  It's really
[1:37:27.320 --> 1:37:29.320]  About voluntary association
[1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:31.320]  And aligning our existence
[1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:33.320]  With natural principles
[1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:35.320]  So we can not only survive
[1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:37.320]  But thrive
[1:37:37.320 --> 1:37:39.320]  But it's not about turning those systems over
[1:37:39.320 --> 1:37:41.320]  To some centralized authority
[1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:43.320]  To tell us how to live and what we can eat
[1:37:43.320 --> 1:37:45.320]  And what we can grow and all that
[1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:47.320]  Because that's never worked
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:49.320]  Exactly, the globalists create
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:51.320]  This unsustainable system
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:53.320]  That's wasteful everything else
[1:37:53.320 --> 1:37:55.320]  And then they offer their solution
[1:37:55.320 --> 1:37:57.320]  Which is more of the same, exactly
[1:37:57.320 --> 1:37:59.320]  Talk about Agenda 21
[1:37:59.320 --> 1:38:01.320]  And of course your wife there
[1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:03.320]  Worked on the film so much
[1:38:03.320 --> 1:38:05.320]  And talk about the whole Federal Reserve
[1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:07.320]  Angle that you're introducing to people
[1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:09.320]  And it really has a nice mix of all the key issues
[1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:11.320]  Of how these controllers
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:13.320]  Are in control
[1:38:13.320 --> 1:38:15.320]  One of the things that we did
[1:38:15.320 --> 1:38:17.320]  Was investigate and follow
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:19.320]  The money in all 12
[1:38:19.320 --> 1:38:21.320]  What we call the major sectors of human endeavor
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:23.320]  And it was a shock to me
[1:38:23.320 --> 1:38:25.320]  To find exactly the same families
[1:38:25.320 --> 1:38:27.320]  In charge of every single sector
[1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:29.320]  And we came to the realization
[1:38:29.320 --> 1:38:31.320]  That it wasn't because they're any smarter
[1:38:31.320 --> 1:38:33.320]  Any better than anyone else
[1:38:33.320 --> 1:38:35.320]  It's because they're the ones who run the money scam
[1:38:35.320 --> 1:38:37.320]  And it's just like playing Monopoly
[1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:39.320]  If you can make up money
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:41.320]  It's not going to take you that long
[1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:43.320]  Even if it takes 100 years
[1:38:43.320 --> 1:38:45.320]  You're going to buy everybody else out
[1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:47.320]  And we're on the verge of that right now
[1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:49.320]  So we look to expose that system
[1:38:49.320 --> 1:38:51.320]  Because with the internet now
[1:38:51.320 --> 1:38:53.320]  And shows like yours
[1:38:53.320 --> 1:38:55.320]  When we started our work
[1:38:55.320 --> 1:38:57.320]  You were lucky to find anything on the internet
[1:38:57.320 --> 1:38:59.320]  About the Federal Reserve being not federal
[1:38:59.320 --> 1:39:01.320]  Last time I checked
[1:39:01.320 --> 1:39:03.320]  There were over 31 million references
[1:39:03.320 --> 1:39:05.320]  For that phrase alone
[1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:07.320]  So obviously people are waking up
[1:39:07.320 --> 1:39:09.320]  And finding out and that's why
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:11.320]  That system is crumbling
[1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:13.320]  But as that system crumbles
[1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:15.320]  It's critical that we have
[1:39:15.320 --> 1:39:17.320]  New systems that we are building
[1:39:17.320 --> 1:39:19.320]  Based on integrity, based on liberty
[1:39:19.320 --> 1:39:23.320]  That can grow a new and free society
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:25.320]  So we give in our solution section
[1:39:25.320 --> 1:39:27.320]  And in the film some overarching
[1:39:27.320 --> 1:39:29.320]  Strategies
[1:39:29.320 --> 1:39:31.320]  Like getting out of the IMF
[1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:33.320]  In the World Bank
[1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:35.320]  And shutting down the Federal Reserve
[1:39:35.320 --> 1:39:37.320]  And going to a non-GMO
[1:39:37.320 --> 1:39:39.320]  Organic Farming
[1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:41.320]  Campaign finance reform
[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:43.320]  That type of thing
[1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:45.320]  But then people go, what can I do about such a vast thing
[1:39:45.320 --> 1:39:47.320]  So then our second section
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:49.320]  Is what can I do personally
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:51.320]  And we recommend the top 10 actions
[1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:53.320]  That people can take
[1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:55.320]  Just by changing their lifestyle choices
[1:39:55.320 --> 1:39:57.320]  That don't take a lot of time or money
[1:39:57.320 --> 1:39:59.320]  And that you can easily join coalitions
[1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:01.320]  To shut down the Federal Reserve
[1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:03.320]  To keep the internet open
[1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:05.320]  You can easily bank locally
[1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:07.320]  If you're in one of these big take-borne banks
[1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:09.320]  You can shift your money in a couple of hours
[1:40:09.320 --> 1:40:11.320]  You can take part in critical mass actions
[1:40:11.320 --> 1:40:13.320]  Related to free energy
[1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:15.320]  Or GMOs
[1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:17.320]  Independent media
[1:40:17.320 --> 1:40:19.320]  So there's a ton that you can do
[1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:21.320]  And we suggest that people print out
[1:40:21.320 --> 1:40:23.320]  Our top 10 recommendations
[1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:25.320]  Put them on your refrigerator
[1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:27.320]  And whatever ones you agree with
[1:40:27.320 --> 1:40:29.320]  Just use it as a checklist
[1:40:29.320 --> 1:40:31.320]  And if you've checked all those off
[1:40:31.320 --> 1:40:33.320]  Then there's plenty more, if you haven't
[1:40:33.320 --> 1:40:35.320]  Then don't go around ringing your hands
[1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:37.320]  About, oh, what can I do
[1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:39.320]  Yeah, and I think one of the things
[1:40:39.320 --> 1:40:41.320]  Yeah, start that first step, sorry, go ahead
[1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:43.320]  Yeah, and by exposing the whole pyramid structure
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:45.320]  You know, one of the things you realize
[1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:47.320]  Looking at that is that
[1:40:47.320 --> 1:40:49.320]  It relies on the people as its base
[1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:51.320]  This whole system
[1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:53.320]  So as people wake up
[1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:55.320]  That is the critical piece to change the whole thing
[1:40:55.320 --> 1:40:57.320]  Because without our participation
[1:40:57.320 --> 1:40:59.320]  This whole pyramid control system
[1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:01.320]  Can't actually succeed
[1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:03.320]  And so that's what I'm seeing
[1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:05.320]  That I'm so excited about
[1:41:05.320 --> 1:41:07.320]  Because the tools for awareness
[1:41:07.320 --> 1:41:09.320]  That you and we and others are creating
[1:41:09.320 --> 1:41:11.320]  That's the thing that creates
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:13.320]  The fundamental shift
[1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:15.320]  Because it can't keep on continuing
[1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:17.320]  Without people blindly supporting it
[1:41:19.320 --> 1:41:21.320]  Voting with our knowledge
[1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:23.320]  We have a graphic on our website and in the film
[1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:25.320]  We've spent a lot of effort trying to
[1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:27.320]  Boil the whole kind of power structure
[1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:29.320]  Down to one picture
[1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:31.320]  And we're at the bottom going about our daily lives
[1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:33.320]  And the government is above us
[1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:35.320]  Because obviously they have taken over
[1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:37.320]  A lot of control over our lives
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:39.320]  But what most people don't realize
[1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:41.320]  Much more educated in this audience
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:43.320]  But in general, people don't realize
[1:41:43.320 --> 1:41:45.320]  That there are at least six levels above that
[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:47.320]  Where the politicians are beholden
[1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:49.320]  To the corporatocracy
[1:41:49.320 --> 1:41:51.320]  To the big banks
[1:41:51.320 --> 1:41:53.320]  To the central banks
[1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:55.320]  And all the way up to the Bank of International Settlements
[1:41:55.320 --> 1:41:57.320]  And then into the Rothschild, Rockefeller
[1:41:57.320 --> 1:41:59.320]  The whole secret society
[1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:01.320]  Command and control structure
[1:42:01.320 --> 1:42:03.320]  That decides our fates behind closed doors
[1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:05.320]  And then comes out and runs
[1:42:05.320 --> 1:42:07.320]  Their mandates
[1:42:07.320 --> 1:42:09.320]  Down through the media, the military
[1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:11.320]  The government and so forth
[1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:13.320]  Down through that pyramid structure
[1:42:13.320 --> 1:42:15.320]  But if we, through non-violent, non-participation
[1:42:15.320 --> 1:42:17.320]  Walk away from the bottom
[1:42:17.320 --> 1:42:19.320]  Of that structure
[1:42:19.320 --> 1:42:21.320]  And refuse to go into these
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:23.320]  Wars of foreign aggression
[1:42:23.320 --> 1:42:25.320]  And refuse to put your money in those banks
[1:42:25.320 --> 1:42:27.320]  And refuse to participate
[1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:29.320]  In the usual government structure
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:31.320]  That you've exposed so well, Alex
[1:42:31.320 --> 1:42:33.320]  Where they're both working for this same agenda
[1:42:33.320 --> 1:42:35.320]  That pyramid
[1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:37.320]  Not only will
[1:42:37.320 --> 1:42:39.320]  But is already crumbling
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:41.320]  So it's important that we're building
[1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:43.320]  Really
[1:42:43.320 --> 1:42:45.320]  Free, honest
[1:42:45.320 --> 1:42:47.320]  And sustainable options
[1:42:47.320 --> 1:42:49.320]  To that in every domain
[1:42:49.320 --> 1:42:51.320]  That are not under the control of the state
[1:42:51.320 --> 1:42:53.320]  And you can see that
[1:42:53.320 --> 1:42:55.320]  Under Follow the Money
[1:42:55.320 --> 1:42:57.320]  At ThriveMovement.com
[1:42:57.320 --> 1:42:59.320]  Yeah
[1:42:59.320 --> 1:43:01.320]  In fact, guys
[1:43:01.320 --> 1:43:03.320]  We can probably pull that up, that pyramid
[1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:05.320]  What section of the site is that
[1:43:05.320 --> 1:43:07.320]  And we'll put it up for folks watching on prisonplanet.tv
[1:43:07.320 --> 1:43:09.320]  Thanks
[1:43:09.320 --> 1:43:11.320]  If you go to the problem
[1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:13.320]  And then go to Follow the Money
[1:43:13.320 --> 1:43:15.320]  There's a small version of it
[1:43:15.320 --> 1:43:17.320]  And you can click on it
[1:43:17.320 --> 1:43:19.320]  There's a link there, you can get a larger version
[1:43:19.320 --> 1:43:21.320]  So go to the Problem section
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:23.320]  And then click on
[1:43:23.320 --> 1:43:25.320]  The section for
[1:43:25.320 --> 1:43:27.320]  Click on the Problem section
[1:43:27.320 --> 1:43:29.320]  And then click on Follow the Money
[1:43:29.320 --> 1:43:31.320]  Now expanding on this
[1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:33.320]  Because obviously callers and people
[1:43:33.320 --> 1:43:35.320]  After you're on with us and I want to have you back up in the future
[1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:37.320]  To just take phone calls
[1:43:37.320 --> 1:43:39.320]  Because I think the film is very well done
[1:43:39.320 --> 1:43:41.320]  And it'll get people thinking, like you said
[1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:43.320]  If you don't agree with all 10 of those solutions
[1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:45.320]  Of them
[1:43:45.320 --> 1:43:47.320]  Then don't follow them
[1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:49.320]  It's just start thinking about solutions
[1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:51.320]  Start thinking about getting engaged
[1:43:51.320 --> 1:43:53.320]  Because the power of we the people
[1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:55.320]  Doing little things
[1:43:55.320 --> 1:43:57.320]  Moves mountains, many hands make light work
[1:43:57.320 --> 1:43:59.320]  And Hollywood tries to put this image
[1:43:59.320 --> 1:44:01.320]  Of an Arnold Schwarzenegger
[1:44:01.320 --> 1:44:03.320]  Art type
[1:44:03.320 --> 1:44:05.320]  Hercules defeating the monsters
[1:44:05.320 --> 1:44:07.320]  That's not how things are really done
[1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:09.320]  It's little people doing little things
[1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:11.320]  Together really changes things
[1:44:11.320 --> 1:44:13.320]  I don't want you to think you've got to do it all
[1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:15.320]  In one fell swoop or there's a silver bullet
[1:44:15.320 --> 1:44:17.320]  Simply seeking after answers
[1:44:17.320 --> 1:44:19.320]  Taking action
[1:44:19.320 --> 1:44:21.320]  Supporting locals
[1:44:21.320 --> 1:44:23.320]  Supporting your community
[1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:25.320]  Being involved
[1:44:25.320 --> 1:44:27.320]  And not feeling inadequate
[1:44:27.320 --> 1:44:29.320]  Madison Avenue tries to make everybody feel pathetic
[1:44:29.320 --> 1:44:31.320]  Realizing you have power and value
[1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:33.320]  It's that decision
[1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:35.320]  That spiritual psychological decision
[1:44:35.320 --> 1:44:37.320]  Out of that waking up
[1:44:37.320 --> 1:44:39.320]  Just means being aware, trying to learn more
[1:44:39.320 --> 1:44:41.320]  And believing you can make the world a better place
[1:44:41.320 --> 1:44:43.320]  Out of that decision changes everything
[1:44:43.320 --> 1:44:45.320]  But obviously when you guys come on
[1:44:45.320 --> 1:44:47.320]  People are going to say, you know, the gambles
[1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:49.320]  That's, you know, Procter and Gamble
[1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:51.320]  Who is this guy, you know, their new world order
[1:44:51.320 --> 1:44:53.320]  My whole point is we have to expect that
[1:44:53.320 --> 1:44:55.320]  You know, A
[1:44:55.320 --> 1:44:57.320]  We're going to see people
[1:44:57.320 --> 1:44:59.320]  From prominent families
[1:44:59.320 --> 1:45:01.320]  People from the establishment
[1:45:01.320 --> 1:45:03.320]  People from Hollywood
[1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:05.320]  People from all over the system as things get crazier and crazier
[1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:07.320]  They're going to start trying to fix things
[1:45:07.320 --> 1:45:09.320]  I mean, how did anything in your background
[1:45:09.320 --> 1:45:11.320]  Help prime you to be awake to this?
[1:45:11.320 --> 1:45:13.320]  Have you ever been approached by other elites
[1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:15.320]  And, you know, told to basically, you know,
[1:45:15.320 --> 1:45:17.320]  Shut up, because I know I have been
[1:45:17.320 --> 1:45:19.320]  Or offered things
[1:45:19.320 --> 1:45:21.320]  I mean
[1:45:21.320 --> 1:45:23.320]  Have you ever had any experiences
[1:45:23.320 --> 1:45:25.320]  In that realm?
[1:45:25.320 --> 1:45:27.320]  Well, I've been
[1:45:27.320 --> 1:45:29.320]  Pretty out of the box
[1:45:29.320 --> 1:45:31.320]  Thinker, like you for a long time
[1:45:31.320 --> 1:45:33.320]  I was, you know,
[1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:35.320]  Very successful in elite school
[1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:37.320]  So I was, you know,
[1:45:37.320 --> 1:45:39.320]  Recruited for various
[1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:41.320]  Corporations and organization
[1:45:41.320 --> 1:45:43.320]  I was wind and dined at the Bohemian club
[1:45:43.320 --> 1:45:45.320]  One day for lunch, but I realized very
[1:45:45.320 --> 1:45:47.320]  Even though I didn't understand
[1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:49.320]  What was really going on behind the scenes
[1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:51.320]  It never felt good to me
[1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:53.320]  I didn't like the tenor of the conversations
[1:45:53.320 --> 1:45:55.320]  They seemed very arrogant and controlling
[1:45:55.320 --> 1:45:57.320]  So I just went off on my other path
[1:45:57.320 --> 1:45:59.320]  Because I didn't think I was going to find
[1:45:59.320 --> 1:46:01.320]  Any of the answers
[1:46:01.320 --> 1:46:03.320]  Or the fulfillment that I was looking for
[1:46:03.320 --> 1:46:05.320]  There, I'm happy to say that
[1:46:05.320 --> 1:46:07.320]  That I have not taken
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:09.320]  Any flat from
[1:46:09.320 --> 1:46:11.320]  From other people in
[1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:13.320]  That social set
[1:46:13.320 --> 1:46:15.320]  So far, and my family has been very
[1:46:15.320 --> 1:46:17.320]  Supportive. I want to be very clear
[1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:19.320]  That the
[1:46:19.320 --> 1:46:21.320]  Gamble of Procter and Gamble
[1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:23.320]  Legacy, that's a single
[1:46:23.320 --> 1:46:25.320]  Company family
[1:46:25.320 --> 1:46:27.320]  You know, based around soap and
[1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:29.320]  Candles and I'm thankful
[1:46:29.320 --> 1:46:31.320]  For the guy who started it, that I ended
[1:46:31.320 --> 1:46:33.320]  Up inheriting just enough money that I could
[1:46:33.320 --> 1:46:35.320]  Basically spend my life doing this kind
[1:46:35.320 --> 1:46:37.320]  Of research and make this kind of film
[1:46:37.320 --> 1:46:39.320]  And that just about tapped me out
[1:46:39.320 --> 1:46:41.320]  But it's not any work
[1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:43.320]  In the same realm as
[1:46:43.320 --> 1:46:45.320]  A banking family that is
[1:46:45.320 --> 1:46:47.320]  Continuing to multiply
[1:46:47.320 --> 1:46:49.320]  That fractional reserve fiat scam
[1:46:49.320 --> 1:46:51.320]  Sure they have the money machines
[1:46:51.320 --> 1:46:53.320]  Thousands of corporations
[1:46:53.320 --> 1:46:55.320]  And carry an agenda
[1:46:55.320 --> 1:46:57.320]  To dominate other people's lives
[1:46:57.320 --> 1:46:59.320]  Well exactly, people always
[1:46:59.320 --> 1:47:01.320]  You know, say hey, the elite
[1:47:01.320 --> 1:47:03.320]  Doesn't want to mess up the economy, they're making money
[1:47:03.320 --> 1:47:05.320]  Well literally they're making money, they print it
[1:47:05.320 --> 1:47:07.320]  They issue it and they've been able
[1:47:07.320 --> 1:47:09.320]  To take over the whole planet through fraud
[1:47:09.320 --> 1:47:11.320]  And of course I brought that up because
[1:47:11.320 --> 1:47:13.320]  Cointel Pro will just use that, or people psychologically
[1:47:13.320 --> 1:47:15.320]  Will use that as an example to not look
[1:47:15.320 --> 1:47:17.320]  At it, because anybody who even has a
[1:47:17.320 --> 1:47:19.320]  Famous name, I mean obviously
[1:47:19.320 --> 1:47:21.320]  I know about big families, even if there was
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:23.320]  A ton of money, it runs out, it goes away
[1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:25.320]  I've got that, and people are judged by their
[1:47:25.320 --> 1:47:27.320]  Deeds, not by their name
[1:47:27.320 --> 1:47:29.320]  I mean you could go back in my lineage
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:31.320]  If people knew it, and find all sorts
[1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:33.320]  Of interesting characters, which I won't
[1:47:33.320 --> 1:47:35.320]  Even say on air, because people don't have
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:37.320]  A day with it, you know, go ahead
[1:47:37.320 --> 1:47:39.320]  Yeah it's true for anybody, you know
[1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:41.320]  You don't want to be defined by your relatives
[1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:43.320]  And I think Thrive speaks for itself
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:45.320]  It's what we spend our time and our money
[1:47:45.320 --> 1:47:47.320]  And our resources and our reputations
[1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:49.320]  And everything that we've put into this
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:51.320]  And risked in order to be helpful
[1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:53.320]  So I think that proof is in the pudding
[1:47:53.320 --> 1:47:55.320]  Of how are we spending our time and what
[1:47:55.320 --> 1:47:57.320]  Are our lives, not who we are
[1:47:57.320 --> 1:47:59.320]  Sure, well I can listen to you
[1:47:59.320 --> 1:48:01.320]  And I can see the film and tell you guys
[1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:03.320]  You know, awake, enlighten
[1:48:03.320 --> 1:48:05.320]  Folks that realize we've got a serious problem
[1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:07.320]  And so I commend
[1:48:07.320 --> 1:48:09.320]  What you're doing, that's why we're carrying the film
[1:48:09.320 --> 1:48:11.320]  At infowars.com and hope folks get it
[1:48:11.320 --> 1:48:13.320]  And get it out to people, because I think it is going to get people thinking
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:15.320]  And just moving in the right direction
[1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:17.320]  Instead of sitting in the ditch, we've only got a few minutes left
[1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:19.320]  And then one more short segment, you guys
[1:48:19.320 --> 1:48:21.320]  Have got the floor, what are some other facets
[1:48:21.320 --> 1:48:23.320]  Of the film, I mean you get into the cancer
[1:48:23.320 --> 1:48:25.320]  Rates going up, you get into
[1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:27.320]  You get into the free
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:29.320]  Liberty lifestyle
[1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:31.320]  And true
[1:48:31.320 --> 1:48:33.320]  Individualism, I know that you said that's one of the most
[1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:35.320]  Controversial parts of the film
[1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:37.320]  Yeah, that's what I'd love to focus on for a moment
[1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:39.320]  Because
[1:48:39.320 --> 1:48:41.320]  There is such power, moral power
[1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:43.320]  And integrity
[1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:45.320]  To the Liberty movement, but a lot of people
[1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:47.320]  In the Liberty movement
[1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:49.320]  Are so idealistic
[1:48:49.320 --> 1:48:51.320]  That they're not willing to talk about transition strategies
[1:48:51.320 --> 1:48:53.320]  They just, you know, wish it would be perfect
[1:48:53.320 --> 1:48:55.320]  Right now, and it's not going to be
[1:48:55.320 --> 1:48:57.320]  Tomorrow or a year from now
[1:48:57.320 --> 1:48:59.320]  So I haven't found a whole lot of
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:01.320]  Constructive solutions
[1:49:01.320 --> 1:49:03.320]  Transitions, and then so we spend years
[1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:05.320]  Working with some of the best thinkers
[1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:07.320]  That we could find to try to create
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:09.320]  Kind of a business plan
[1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:11.320]  For transitioning that includes
[1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:13.320]  I think what some of the left
[1:49:13.320 --> 1:49:15.320]  Has spent a lot of time and compassion on
[1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:17.320]  To do well
[1:49:17.320 --> 1:49:19.320]  To take care of people in transition
[1:49:19.320 --> 1:49:21.320]  To take care of the soil that needs to be replenished
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:23.320]  And people who have been so damaged
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:25.320]  By a corrupt system
[1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:27.320]  That they don't have homes
[1:49:27.320 --> 1:49:29.320]  And they don't have health care and so forth
[1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:31.320]  For a little while, it would be great
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:33.320]  To help take care of those most wounded
[1:49:33.320 --> 1:49:35.320]  But not by creating new taxes
[1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:37.320]  Which is just a new violation
[1:49:37.320 --> 1:49:39.320]  But by instead reducing the military budget
[1:49:39.320 --> 1:49:41.320]  Getting rid of the Federal Reserve
[1:49:41.320 --> 1:49:43.320]  And that would literally free up
[1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:45.320]  One to two trillion dollars a year
[1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:47.320]  That could fund a few years of transition
[1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:49.320]  While the prosperity is
[1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:51.320]  Returning to our
[1:49:51.320 --> 1:49:53.320]  Civilization
[1:49:53.320 --> 1:49:55.320]  And particularly in what we call
[1:49:55.320 --> 1:49:57.320]  The second stage or the second track
[1:49:57.320 --> 1:49:59.320]  Which is really where Ron Paul is focusing
[1:49:59.320 --> 1:50:01.320]  A lot on stopping these wars of aggression
[1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:03.320]  Having an honest money system
[1:50:03.320 --> 1:50:05.320]  And shrinking the government down
[1:50:05.320 --> 1:50:07.320]  To the protection of individual
[1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:09.320]  Liberties rather than creating
[1:50:09.320 --> 1:50:11.320]  All sorts of legislation to take over
[1:50:11.320 --> 1:50:13.320]  People's lives. And I believe
[1:50:13.320 --> 1:50:15.320]  Myself that we're actually not going
[1:50:15.320 --> 1:50:17.320]  To make it as a species unless we
[1:50:17.320 --> 1:50:19.320]  Learn how to convert
[1:50:19.320 --> 1:50:21.320]  To a true society
[1:50:21.320 --> 1:50:23.320]  Of voluntary association
[1:50:23.320 --> 1:50:25.320]  Because as soon as that mandatory tax
[1:50:25.320 --> 1:50:27.320]  Is allowed
[1:50:27.320 --> 1:50:29.320]  Then a few people have
[1:50:29.320 --> 1:50:31.320]  What I call the seed of tyranny
[1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:33.320]  Which has always grown
[1:50:33.320 --> 1:50:35.320]  Until it's unstoppable
[1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:37.320]  Without some kind of revolution
[1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:39.320]  That's right, government only creates tyranny
[1:50:39.320 --> 1:50:41.320]  It's always the engine of our problems
[1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:43.320]  The founders knew that we've got to make it
[1:50:43.320 --> 1:50:45.320]  As possible. Let's talk about that
[1:50:45.320 --> 1:50:47.320]  Straight ahead. Amazing interview.
[1:50:47.320 --> 1:50:49.320]  The films thrive.

[1:51:05.320 --> 1:51:07.320]  Is already ballooning our gas prices

[1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:11.320]  Which are being blown up by gas costs

[1:52:05.320 --> 1:52:07.320]  When a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house
[1:52:07.320 --> 1:52:09.320]  It looks like no one is home
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:11.320]  Don't let your home be the next target

[1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:17.320]  Fake TV is a small electronic device
[1:52:17.320 --> 1:52:19.320]  That makes the same light as a real television
[1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:21.320]  So from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV
[1:52:21.320 --> 1:52:23.320]  Fake TV plugs in
[1:52:23.320 --> 1:52:25.320]  Just like a lamp on a timer
[1:52:25.320 --> 1:52:27.320]  But is far more convincing to burglars
[1:52:27.320 --> 1:52:29.320]  Fake TV deters burglars
[1:52:29.320 --> 1:52:31.320]  Costs far less than an alarm
[1:52:31.320 --> 1:52:33.320]  And is highly recommended by numerous police departments
[1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:35.320]  Use it anytime you're away from home
[1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:37.320]  Fake TV
[1:52:37.320 --> 1:52:39.320]  Or call 1-877-5 FAKE TV
[1:52:39.320 --> 1:52:41.320]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95
[1:52:41.320 --> 1:52:43.320]  So get one for you
[1:52:43.320 --> 1:52:45.320]  And one for a loved one
[1:52:45.320 --> 1:52:47.320]  For safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you
[1:52:47.320 --> 1:52:49.320]  Call 877-5 F-A-K-E-T-V
[1:52:49.320 --> 1:52:51.320]  Or go to fakedv.com

[1:52:53.320 --> 1:53:05.320]  The burglar deterrent
[1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:26.320]  All you do is just add water
[1:53:26.320 --> 1:53:28.320]  And because they're sealed so well
[1:53:28.320 --> 1:53:30.320]  They come with a 25-year shelf life

[1:53:34.320 --> 1:53:36.320]  Or even stagnant pond water

[1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:40.320]  And you have a winning combination

[1:54:20.320 --> 1:54:22.320]  So we have our gas
[1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:24.320]  We're gonna open the phones and examine the nanny state
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:26.320]  Which is a logical conclusion
[1:54:26.320 --> 1:54:28.320]  Of becoming depended
[1:54:28.320 --> 1:54:31.680]  up in the third hour for those holding that's just five minutes away.
[1:54:31.680 --> 1:54:37.600]  Okay, continuing here with the Thrive movement, you're not just putting out a film, you've
[1:54:37.600 --> 1:54:43.380]  done research, you've gone out and had fact checkers, you know, research, how this world
[1:54:43.380 --> 1:54:45.060]  is really governed.
[1:54:45.060 --> 1:54:49.740]  Talk some about that research that you put in the film that really, in a very professional
[1:54:49.740 --> 1:54:54.460]  and well-research manner, shows the pyramid structure, shows the elite families, shows
[1:54:54.460 --> 1:54:56.120]  how they're engineering this.
[1:54:56.120 --> 1:55:02.160]  I mean, it powerfully, again, proves this open conspiracy against free societies.
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:03.400]  Break that down for folks.
[1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:11.720]  One of the most interesting things to me, Alex, was that we, through basing our work
[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:17.920]  on really reputable work like yours, and then having everything fact checked, we were confident
[1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:23.080]  that the powers that shouldn't be would not go after the information, because they, first
[1:55:23.080 --> 1:55:26.360]  of all, they can't argue with it, and secondly, they don't want people talking about it, so
[1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:32.680]  that they would try to undermine us with kind of baseless debunking sites and that type
[1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:33.680]  of thing.
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:39.400]  But the actual information itself, as you know, as well as anyone, is so compellingly
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:46.320]  interlaced, when you see how all the interlacing board of directors amongst the major corporations
[1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:52.880]  and banks and the military and so forth, is so overwhelmingly obvious once you begin
[1:55:52.880 --> 1:55:53.880]  to see it.
[1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:59.920]  And then the headlines every day, through things like NDAA and ACTA and so forth, it
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:05.200]  only just keeps confirming what you've been saying for, you know, for decades.
[1:56:05.200 --> 1:56:09.400]  So the fact checking that we've done, the fact checking that you've done, I think has
[1:56:09.400 --> 1:56:10.760]  done its job.
[1:56:10.760 --> 1:56:16.880]  It's created a firm foundation to the claims that we're making, so that by, in masses now,
[1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:19.840]  people are going, okay, this is the story that makes sense.
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:21.280]  Now what can we do about it?
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:25.920]  And one of the ways that we've been so thrilled in the response that we're getting is especially
[1:56:25.920 --> 1:56:29.040]  we're getting a strong response from women and from young people.
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:33.840]  And I think especially Kimberly's presence in the film and just a tone that she said
[1:56:33.840 --> 1:56:41.400]  as director, you know, directing me as narrator, kept reminding me to give the viewer their
[1:56:41.400 --> 1:56:48.200]  own emotional space to experience very challenging and difficult information and at the same
[1:56:48.200 --> 1:56:52.560]  time to wrap the whole thing in concrete and viable solutions.
[1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:57.920]  And in my experience of a lifetime of activism, once the women and especially the moms take
[1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:01.360]  on a cause, it's going to happen.
[1:57:01.360 --> 1:57:05.680]  And you know, one of the things in terms of what's available on the site, we have a resource
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:12.200]  tree so that all of the materials that we use, books, videos, people, organizations,
[1:57:12.200 --> 1:57:17.320]  as well as the resources that others who were valuable to us use, we've made available
[1:57:17.320 --> 1:57:18.320]  by sector.
[1:57:18.320 --> 1:57:22.560]  So you can actually go down to the bottom of the home page, there's something on the
[1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:26.480]  bottom of the most pages, there's something called a resource tree.
[1:57:26.480 --> 1:57:30.160]  And when you click on it, you can explore it by sector.
[1:57:30.160 --> 1:57:34.160]  And then, you know, part of that is we want to encourage critical thinking, it's not to
[1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:35.160]  believe us.
[1:57:35.160 --> 1:57:38.360]  It's like you said in the beginning, to go ahead and start thinking about these things
[1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:40.680]  and doing the research yourself.
[1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:45.400]  And then we even have something called reality check, so that you can sort of see what's
[1:57:45.400 --> 1:57:50.920]  your baseline understanding of this agenda in order to then move on to engage in more
[1:57:50.920 --> 1:57:52.480]  leveraged solutions.
[1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:57.800]  Because part of what got me into this initially was to see that my experience of people didn't
[1:57:57.800 --> 1:57:59.720]  support what was happening in the world.
[1:57:59.720 --> 1:58:06.040]  I actually find that people are good and innovative and caring and so what was it that was happening?
[1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:12.840]  So in addition to the resource tree, our solution strategy is really has a personal component
[1:58:12.840 --> 1:58:16.400]  for you to find out what is your own purpose and passion.
[1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:20.600]  Because we need each person to do what they're most inclined to do, there's a place for everybody
[1:58:20.600 --> 1:58:23.840]  in this and not any one person can do it all.
[1:58:23.840 --> 1:58:30.840]  And I think that Kimberly Foster, I know you guys have got to go, but if you can hold
[1:58:30.840 --> 1:58:34.680]  one minute, you could do five more minutes and finish up the solution area that you're
[1:58:34.680 --> 1:58:35.680]  discussing.
[1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:38.960]  Okay, we'll be back in 60 seconds and after that segment, I'm coming up at eight after
[1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:51.120]  I'll take your phone calls folks, you are listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today.
[1:58:51.120 --> 1:58:56.120]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[1:58:56.120 --> 1:59:01.240]  good size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well known fact that
[1:59:01.240 --> 1:59:05.640]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized
[1:59:05.640 --> 1:59:11.760]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[1:59:11.760 --> 1:59:16.160]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[1:59:16.160 --> 1:59:22.440]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[1:59:22.440 --> 1:59:26.800]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once
[1:59:26.800 --> 1:59:30.440]  you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[1:59:30.440 --> 1:59:37.040]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[1:59:37.040 --> 1:59:38.280]  Check it out for yourself.
[1:59:38.280 --> 1:59:39.280]  It's incredible.

[2:00:24.080 --> 2:00:28.520]  It's my final day on the road in Baton Rouge where we first came through last week.
[2:00:28.520 --> 2:00:31.960]  We're back in Austin this evening.
[2:00:31.960 --> 2:00:32.960]  Pray for us and our safety.
[2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:35.240]  I pray for all your safety out there.
[2:00:35.240 --> 2:00:38.480]  Your calls, those that are holding, I'll get right to you at the start of the next segment
[2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:43.400]  and we've got a bunch of big breaking news on the Ron Paul front, you name it.
[2:00:43.400 --> 2:00:49.400]  We're here right now talking to Foster and Kimberly Gamble, makers of the Thrive film
[2:00:49.400 --> 2:00:54.360]  available at infowarsteam.com and in a larger movement to try to get people awake to what's
[2:00:54.360 --> 2:00:59.120]  happening and really bridge the gap between the control left and right paradigm and just
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:04.360]  get people back to being basic humans who are trying to build a better, more free society
[2:01:04.360 --> 2:01:05.360]  through free association.
[2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:09.920]  I'll have to have you guys back up again soon to take calls and also get more into solutions
[2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:13.520]  and I want Kimberly to have a minute or two here to talk about some solutions but first,
[2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:18.960]  I don't get into end fighting, I don't do it and I did, though, four or five years ago
[2:01:18.960 --> 2:01:23.960]  get the maker of Zeitgeist on and argue with him a little bit because I said, what if I
[2:01:23.960 --> 2:01:27.720]  don't want to go live and have the big centralized computer run everything that'll make it all
[2:01:27.720 --> 2:01:31.920]  fair because who programs the computer and he said, well, you'll be reeducated, you'll
[2:01:31.920 --> 2:01:37.880]  be taken to a reeducation center and I got mad at him and then I invited him on trying
[2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:41.040]  to be friendly about a year ago and he said, you've got to agree that I didn't say you
[2:01:41.040 --> 2:01:42.040]  have to go to reeducation.
[2:01:42.040 --> 2:01:46.880]  I went and watched the show again and he did say that and I'm trying to get into fight
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:52.800]  with whatever stage name is or whatever Peter Joseph, I didn't try to get into fight with
[2:01:52.800 --> 2:01:53.800]  him.
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:57.320]  I don't want to fight the Zeitgeist people but I'm sorry, a collectivism from my experience
[2:01:57.320 --> 2:02:01.040]  is a bloody nightmare and the New York Times, of course, endorsed it and all the rest of
[2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:02.520]  which is not a good sign.
[2:02:02.520 --> 2:02:05.040]  I'm not trying to get into fight with them but because you guys are trying to start
[2:02:05.040 --> 2:02:09.200]  a movement having success and bridge the left right gap and all this stuff, I think you
[2:02:09.200 --> 2:02:14.760]  guys are wholesome and legitimate and meanwhile, what is your brief comment and then a few
[2:02:14.760 --> 2:02:18.960]  final solutions on Zeitgeist and the whole Zeitgeist movement?
[2:02:18.960 --> 2:02:25.160]  Well, I have a lot of respect for Peter Joseph's intention there and I think he revealed a tremendous
[2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:33.120]  amount of useful information in parts of the films and my main problems with the films
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:39.120]  were one, economically, I think that we have a different understanding about money.
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:40.880]  I don't think money is evil.
[2:02:40.880 --> 2:02:46.200]  I think the dishonest money is corrupt and it destroys people's lives and society but
[2:02:46.200 --> 2:02:51.880]  I think a medium of exchange, if it's honest, is always going to be needed and practical
[2:02:51.880 --> 2:02:58.840]  and secondly, I also have a horror of these high tech collectivist types of cities that
[2:02:58.840 --> 2:03:03.680]  I think a lot of the technology that Jacque Fresco suggests is going to be a terrific
[2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:04.680]  assistance.
[2:03:04.680 --> 2:03:09.680]  Sure, but the centralization of it is nightmare.
[2:03:09.680 --> 2:03:10.680]  Exactly.
[2:03:10.680 --> 2:03:11.680]  I agree with that completely.
[2:03:11.680 --> 2:03:16.240]  I mean, the Soviets 100 years ago pushed their whole agenda, as you know, in this sci-fi
[2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:19.680]  utopia and it doesn't build a utopia, it builds a nightmare.
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:20.680]  I agree with that.
[2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:22.560]  I think we really need to be careful about that.
[2:03:22.560 --> 2:03:27.280]  I think it was disingenuous, I think that it was honest on their parts.
[2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:31.960]  I think it's an honest misunderstanding of something that they haven't seen really from
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:37.760]  the liberty versus collectivist point of view and on the economics but I do disagree in
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:39.960]  the same way that you're saying.
[2:03:39.960 --> 2:03:44.960]  Well also, I've seen some of their events online, it's extreme arrogance and really
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:49.400]  getting off on they've got the answer and the truth is we don't have the answer.
[2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:53.840]  We need the diversity of liberty is the answer and it's got to be worked out.
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:58.720]  Any time you hear, this is the silver bullet historically and plus in my gut, run.
[2:03:58.720 --> 2:03:59.720]  Yeah.
[2:03:59.720 --> 2:04:06.000]  Well, you know, the person who introduced me to you, Alex, was my son, Trevor, and
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:07.560]  I will be forever indebted.
[2:04:07.560 --> 2:04:13.280]  He was really the one who woke me up to the conspiracy to what's going on with the money
[2:04:13.280 --> 2:04:14.560]  and also to liberty.
[2:04:14.560 --> 2:04:17.360]  I remember the day he said, have you heard of this guy, Alex Jones?
[2:04:17.360 --> 2:04:18.360]  And I said, no.
[2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:19.360]  What is he doing?
[2:04:19.360 --> 2:04:22.880]  Well, he makes some movies and he handed me a stack of movies, you know, that changed
[2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:23.880]  my life.
[2:04:23.880 --> 2:04:28.660]  And for those of you who may not know what we're talking about with the liberty perspective,
[2:04:28.660 --> 2:04:34.200]  he's written a terrific book called The Secrets to Nonviolent Prosperity, The Principles
[2:04:34.200 --> 2:04:35.200]  of Liberty.
[2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:36.200]  I need to get him on.
[2:04:36.200 --> 2:04:39.640]  In ways that you don't get in casual conversations with people.
[2:04:39.640 --> 2:04:43.480]  I tell you what, let's have your, we're out of time, Kimberly, and I want to get one of
[2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:44.480]  the solutions.
[2:04:44.480 --> 2:04:45.720]  Let's have you back up in a few weeks.
[2:04:45.720 --> 2:04:49.040]  If you could do it, it was hard to get you guys on, you're so busy.
[2:04:49.040 --> 2:04:51.280]  Come on in a few weeks and bring Trevor along.
[2:04:51.280 --> 2:04:52.280]  This is really exciting.
[2:04:52.280 --> 2:04:53.880]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[2:04:53.880 --> 2:04:54.880]  Thank you, sir.
[2:04:54.880 --> 2:04:55.880]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:04:55.880 --> 2:04:56.880]  It's an honor.
[2:04:56.880 --> 2:04:58.120]  And they're on the bar on the nightly news.
[2:04:58.120 --> 2:05:00.480]  So they just reminded me of that, so they'll be back tomorrow.
[2:05:00.480 --> 2:05:01.480]  Bring Trevor.
[2:05:01.480 --> 2:05:05.760]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:05:05.760 --> 2:05:10.080]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:05:10.080 --> 2:05:14.400]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:05:14.400 --> 2:05:15.720]  allows you to have.
[2:05:15.720 --> 2:05:16.720]  It's true.
[2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:21.400]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:05:21.400 --> 2:05:25.800]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:05:25.800 --> 2:05:29.800]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:05:29.800 --> 2:05:33.280]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:37.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:41.800]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:05:41.800 --> 2:05:45.520]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:05:45.520 --> 2:05:46.920]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[2:06:00.600 --> 2:06:03.560]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.

[2:06:08.280 --> 2:06:09.280]  risk.

[2:06:33.320 --> 2:06:35.600]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:10.840]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:08:10.840 --> 2:08:11.840]  You want answers?
[2:08:11.840 --> 2:08:13.960]  Well, so does he.
[2:08:13.960 --> 2:08:23.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:30.200]  Okay, here is what I'm going to do.
[2:08:30.200 --> 2:08:36.160]  I'm going to go to Carl, Scott, Chris, Kyle, Ronnie, and others, and then I'm going to
[2:08:36.160 --> 2:08:37.160]  get into all this news.
[2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:39.600]  A lot of it's broken since we got on air.
[2:08:39.600 --> 2:08:45.160]  Nanny State, walking is dangerous, they're now saying, I'm not joking.
[2:08:45.160 --> 2:08:50.440]  That dovetails with another report we've got about the insane Nanny State 10 points that
[2:08:50.440 --> 2:08:53.560]  just show how incredible it is.
[2:08:53.560 --> 2:08:56.360]  Ron Paul confronts Bernanke, do you buy your own groceries?
[2:08:56.360 --> 2:09:00.320]  It's like when George Herbert Walker Bush didn't know what a scanner was at the grocery
[2:09:00.320 --> 2:09:02.920]  store about a decade after they were out.
[2:09:02.920 --> 2:09:13.480]  So Professor Pervert, interspecies genocide, reduced current human numbers.
[2:09:13.480 --> 2:09:16.160]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[2:09:16.160 --> 2:09:22.080]  Also Obama issues policy directive exempting American cities from indefinite detention.
[2:09:22.080 --> 2:09:25.480]  That is just some of what we're going to be covering here today.
[2:09:25.480 --> 2:09:31.440]  But right now, without further ado, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:33.240]  Bill in Texas, you're on the air, welcome.
[2:09:33.240 --> 2:09:35.680]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:36.680]  You there?
[2:09:36.680 --> 2:09:37.680]  Good, sir.
[2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:38.680]  Welcome.
[2:09:38.680 --> 2:09:46.680]  Hey, on the topic of Ron Paul, we just need to flat out support him.
[2:09:46.680 --> 2:09:51.240]  No matter what these globalists try to do, we just need to back up this guy no matter
[2:09:51.240 --> 2:09:54.880]  what comes around.
[2:09:54.880 --> 2:10:00.520]  As we follow people, just like what the filmmakers were talking about, we always want to follow
[2:10:00.520 --> 2:10:01.520]  something.
[2:10:01.520 --> 2:10:07.120]  They made some mention is, when you follow the money, you see who's in charge.
[2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:08.280]  I was thinking about this.
[2:10:08.280 --> 2:10:13.120]  I said, you ought to come up with a t-shirt that actually says, follow the eugenics and
[2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:14.120]  you'll see who's in charge.
[2:10:14.120 --> 2:10:17.560]  And on the back of the t-shirt, it should say, and who's the target, you.
[2:10:17.560 --> 2:10:20.640]  I mean, that's what it really comes right down to.
[2:10:20.640 --> 2:10:23.800]  It's really what you said a few weeks ago.
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:24.800]  It's not about the money.
[2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:27.560]  This isn't about money at all.
[2:10:27.560 --> 2:10:29.120]  This is about eugenics.
[2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:35.000]  And if you can really wrap your head around this, you'll see why guys like Ron Paul are
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:36.680]  going to be ostracized.
[2:10:36.680 --> 2:10:41.080]  They're going to be put out there and lied about and talked down about.
[2:10:41.080 --> 2:10:43.200]  And you're going to have guys that come on.
[2:10:43.200 --> 2:10:44.200]  You're right.
[2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:45.200]  You're right.
[2:10:45.200 --> 2:10:46.200]  It's about total, sure, sure.
[2:10:46.200 --> 2:10:49.240]  It's about total takeover of human destiny.
[2:10:49.240 --> 2:10:51.200]  That's winning according to the globalists.
[2:10:51.200 --> 2:10:54.880]  It's like many cultures would take over another culture and kill everybody.
[2:10:54.880 --> 2:11:00.960]  That is what total domination is, is to scientifically take control of the whole society, dumb people
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:03.240]  down or easy to control.
[2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:05.120]  This has been done by design.
[2:11:05.120 --> 2:11:09.820]  Humanity is easy to lift up if you have the right leadership and if you have the resources.
[2:11:09.820 --> 2:11:12.720]  The globalists have done everything they can to suppress it.
[2:11:12.720 --> 2:11:18.080]  We could have unlimited resources, unlimited technology, unlimited history and science
[2:11:18.080 --> 2:11:19.080]  shows that.
[2:11:19.080 --> 2:11:21.840]  And listen, I totally agree with you all heartedly.
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:25.440]  We've got 100% support, Ron Paul, because the globalists are scared of him.
[2:11:25.440 --> 2:11:26.440]  They hate him.
[2:11:26.440 --> 2:11:27.440]  It's the message.
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:28.440]  It's the liberty.
[2:11:28.440 --> 2:11:31.040]  It's the freedom that's cutting across political lines.
[2:11:31.040 --> 2:11:35.320]  That's why they've pulled out every stop and every fraud and every lie and he has been
[2:11:35.320 --> 2:11:36.320]  the front runner.
[2:11:36.320 --> 2:11:39.840]  I'm saying look out for the bandwagon effect because they've blocked him winning all these
[2:11:39.840 --> 2:11:41.640]  primaries that he really won.
[2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:42.640]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[2:11:42.640 --> 2:11:46.620]  I've already covered it because now some people who are weak-minded will start piling
[2:11:46.620 --> 2:11:48.020]  on to the other candidates.
[2:11:48.020 --> 2:11:50.840]  But regardless, look where we've come from four years ago.
[2:11:50.840 --> 2:11:54.560]  Look at how nobody knew 10 years ago the Federal Reserve was private, maybe one out of 100.
[2:11:54.560 --> 2:11:56.640]  Now it's 90 plus percent of people.
[2:11:56.640 --> 2:11:58.360]  We are making headway.
[2:11:58.360 --> 2:12:02.640]  What's popular with the young people, listen, I just drove through three or four states
[2:12:02.640 --> 2:12:06.800]  and I had a few older people come over to me who were listeners.
[2:12:06.800 --> 2:12:10.680]  But everywhere, when I'd be walking the dogs on the beach driving to the Florida Panhandle
[2:12:10.680 --> 2:12:17.120]  or Orlando or wherever I went, everywhere, young people of every race, color, creed,
[2:12:17.120 --> 2:12:18.120]  religion.
[2:12:18.120 --> 2:12:25.480]  I was out yesterday morning on the beach in Panama City, Florida, Panama Beach, Florida,
[2:12:25.480 --> 2:12:27.400]  whatever it's called, little town.
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:30.960]  And there were all these pre-spring breakers, college students and high school students
[2:12:30.960 --> 2:12:36.240]  out there playing frisbee and literally half of them that would walk by me while I was
[2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:40.520]  walking dogs or just sitting there on the beach making phone calls came over and were
[2:12:40.520 --> 2:12:43.320]  huge listeners and knew all about the new allotter.
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:46.880]  I mean literally half of the college students knew who I was.
[2:12:46.880 --> 2:12:51.720]  Once one came over, ten would come over and I couldn't walk into the little hotel we were
[2:12:51.720 --> 2:12:57.560]  staying at there, what was it, the sandpiper or something without going.
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:12:58.560]  That's him.
[2:12:58.560 --> 2:12:59.560]  That's Alex Jones.
[2:12:59.560 --> 2:13:02.160]  And this is with my hair sticking up wearing shorts and a t-shirt.
[2:13:02.160 --> 2:13:04.720]  I mean, and again, I'm bragging, ooh, people know who I am.
[2:13:04.720 --> 2:13:08.040]  It's actually creepy because it's dangerous, you know, because I know I'm having an effect.
[2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:09.960]  The globalists certainly don't like this.
[2:13:09.960 --> 2:13:14.800]  We're having such a big effect that half the young people I walk past are awake.
[2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:20.480]  I'm not going a diner full of older folks, snowbirds down there and one person was looking
[2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:21.480]  at me and knew who I was.
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:24.200]  I had probably 50 people in the small diner that morning.
[2:13:24.200 --> 2:13:28.680]  Okay, so none of the old people knew who I was and the young people all did.
[2:13:28.680 --> 2:13:29.680]  What does that tell you?
[2:13:29.680 --> 2:13:30.680]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[2:13:30.680 --> 2:13:36.080]  Well, you know, I was just thinking, you know, what you're saying, I mean, you, look, you
[2:13:36.080 --> 2:13:37.600]  woke me up a few years ago.
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:41.720]  This is right when Obama came in office and when the Obama deception came out, I woke
[2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:45.320]  up to this whole thing with the Federal Reserve.
[2:13:45.320 --> 2:13:50.040]  And I know I read some Robert Kiyosaki books too and all this stuff about, you know, 2008
[2:13:50.040 --> 2:13:53.520]  and the crash and blah, blah, blah, because he wrote some book too.
[2:13:53.520 --> 2:13:58.200]  And you know, I went to this thing called IOUSA.
[2:13:58.200 --> 2:14:03.880]  It was some documentary that came out with the former Comptroller and his cronies.
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:07.440]  It was David Walker and this Concord Coalition.
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:12.000]  We went over there to Rice University and sat down and we, we listened to him and you
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:15.840]  know, we watched the documentary, but at the end of the documentary, the credits were rolling
[2:14:15.840 --> 2:14:19.080]  and he had this pink piggy bank that said, save money.
[2:14:19.080 --> 2:14:22.000]  And I go, well, that's self-contradictory, it doesn't make any sense.
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:24.600]  I mean, if money's going to fall apart and we're in this debt, why would we want to
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:25.600]  save money?
[2:14:25.600 --> 2:14:26.600]  So he came back.
[2:14:26.600 --> 2:14:32.000]  They're telling you exactly, they're telling you, pay them off, which is all fiat fraud
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:33.200]  they created.
[2:14:33.200 --> 2:14:37.560]  Pay them back when you already bailed them out with the bailout money.
[2:14:37.560 --> 2:14:42.760]  They're telling you, sit there and just save so they can raise taxes and steal it all.
[2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:46.280]  And again, I'm not saying it's bad to save at one level of the equation, but yeah, all
[2:14:46.280 --> 2:14:49.160]  their advice that they're putting out is how to rip people off.
[2:14:49.160 --> 2:14:50.160]  Go ahead, sorry.
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:55.160]  Well, he said it was quasi-government because I said, is it privately held, the Federal
[2:14:55.160 --> 2:14:57.200]  Reserve, or is it government run?
[2:14:57.200 --> 2:15:00.880]  Well, I already knew that and you know, I'll flip flopping because I was a little nervous
[2:15:00.880 --> 2:15:05.160]  talking to him because I was in a crowd of people and whatnot, but I made my comment
[2:15:05.160 --> 2:15:09.160]  and the woman that was standing behind me, a 70-year-old woman, it's all on video, by
[2:15:09.160 --> 2:15:12.960]  the way, you can get on rightsuniversity.org, something, something, it's on there, I can
[2:15:12.960 --> 2:15:17.800]  give you guys a link, but this lady that was standing behind me, 70-plus-year-old lady,
[2:15:17.800 --> 2:15:23.800]  she proudly, unfortunately she was proud of this, she said, I am going to tell you that
[2:15:23.800 --> 2:15:29.760]  I served on the Federal Reserve Board and I can tell you right now that it is not government
[2:15:29.760 --> 2:15:36.320]  run, that it is a privately held entity and I said, wow, she told the truth and it was,
[2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:40.240]  I mean, the rest of the room was just sitting there and it's too bad they didn't have a
[2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:45.920]  camera pan to the rest of the room, but you know, it was quiet, just dead silence.
[2:15:45.920 --> 2:15:50.240]  Well, you know, something else happened here today, I said, just calls on Ron Paul and
[2:15:50.240 --> 2:15:53.320]  these are the best callers we ever have and the callers are great, but I don't screen
[2:15:53.320 --> 2:15:58.280]  them and so folks call in who are all over the map and I say, Ron Paul, every caller
[2:15:58.280 --> 2:16:02.680]  has just been incredible gold today and has been so enlightening, that's why I probably
[2:16:02.680 --> 2:16:06.720]  should every day say, here's the topic, we're talking about this because then people call
[2:16:06.720 --> 2:16:12.400]  in who actually want to discuss something real, but again, it is the young people that
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:17.600]  are waking up, either older folks are already awake or they're partially awake or they're
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:20.400]  totally asleep and you're not going to wake them up because they don't want to be woken
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:26.240]  up, but going back to what you're talking about here, it's all coming down right now
[2:16:26.240 --> 2:16:30.120]  and people are either going to join the side of liberty or they're going to try to go down
[2:16:30.120 --> 2:16:35.240]  with the ship, but I want to be able to pull up this video you're talking about, so tell
[2:16:35.240 --> 2:16:38.720]  us the name of the event and then I'm, and then give us an idea of when in the event
[2:16:38.720 --> 2:16:42.400]  it was and then people should be able to find it.
[2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:46.240]  What I can do is more talk off the phone because I have to kind of Google it, I'll find it,
[2:16:46.240 --> 2:16:50.440]  I actually burned it on DVD, I actually have it, I mean, so I have to mail it to you and
[2:16:50.440 --> 2:16:51.440]  you can-
[2:16:51.440 --> 2:16:52.440]  But what was the name of the event?
[2:16:52.440 --> 2:16:54.120]  What was the name of the university again?
[2:16:54.120 --> 2:17:03.600]  It was, you can Google IOUSA, Rice University, Concord Coalition, it's hard because that's
[2:17:03.600 --> 2:17:10.520]  all I can mention, David Walker, type in just key names, but what I can do is I'll have
[2:17:10.520 --> 2:17:16.280]  to find it somehow, but I don't want to, I do want to say, look man, I really support
[2:17:16.280 --> 2:17:20.660]  what Ron's doing, he's been talking about this for 35, 40 years, you can watch his
[2:17:20.660 --> 2:17:22.760]  older videos, he hasn't changed his message.
[2:17:22.760 --> 2:17:25.480]  So a lot of people think, oh, where's this guy come around?
[2:17:25.480 --> 2:17:28.000]  Well, he's been talking about this for years.
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:33.440]  So it's not anything that's new, he's just been the same and people don't like that,
[2:17:33.440 --> 2:17:36.480]  they don't like someone that's going to keep consistent with their story.
[2:17:36.480 --> 2:17:41.080]  They don't like people that are proven right, and I appreciate your call, great points,
[2:17:41.080 --> 2:17:46.640]  the reason Ron Paul's so dangerous is because he's been the same yesterday to day and tomorrow,
[2:17:46.640 --> 2:17:52.400]  he was right and it shows that their system is a fraud by design, he's so right, we're
[2:17:52.400 --> 2:17:58.240]  so right, that's why we're the dangerous bad men, because the crooks know if people get
[2:17:58.240 --> 2:18:04.200]  wise to this, it's game over, I mean, their crimes are so cartoon level, out of control,
[2:18:04.200 --> 2:18:05.200]  it's over.
[2:18:05.200 --> 2:18:10.000]  Now as for the Federal Reserve being private, to these lawyers, in a way what he said is
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:16.360]  true, well, it's quasi-private, quasi-government, and in a way that's true, back when they used
[2:18:16.360 --> 2:18:21.000]  to say it's the Federal Reserve, it's government, that was a lie, and you're a conspiracy theorist
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:26.960]  if you say it's federal, your conspiracy theorist if you say the Federal Reserve is not federal
[2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:27.960]  and is private.
[2:18:27.960 --> 2:18:31.880]  Okay, I mean, I remember 15 years ago, people calling the show going, you're nuts, it's
[2:18:31.880 --> 2:18:36.080]  the Federal Reserve, dangerous conspiracy theorists say that ADL, Southern Barbie Law
[2:18:36.080 --> 2:18:37.680]  Center would say you were crazy.
[2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:44.160]  Now they have to admit that it's private, but then they spin it to say but it's quasi-government,
[2:18:44.160 --> 2:18:51.040]  and in a way that's true, because it's carrying out a congressional government treasury function
[2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:57.680]  illegally, they've usurped it, and so yes, it is a corporate fascist banking cartel that
[2:18:57.680 --> 2:19:02.080]  is carrying out a government function that's supposed to be totally neutral and just a
[2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:07.040]  symbol of currency that is out there so people can exchange goods, not making everything
[2:19:07.040 --> 2:19:11.120]  about the currency itself, so these private interests are able to give themselves this
[2:19:11.120 --> 2:19:17.120]  money, interest-free, but even better, they get the public to give them the money, interest-free,
[2:19:17.120 --> 2:19:21.040]  and then we're in debt to them when they loan it back to us.
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:24.720]  So they want more debt, that's why they want unfunded mandates, that's why they want this
[2:19:24.720 --> 2:19:29.680]  control, but in a weird lawyer way, he was telling the truth, well, it is private but
[2:19:29.680 --> 2:19:34.840]  it's quasi-government, well, yeah, it's, I mean, NATO is pretty much private.
[2:19:34.840 --> 2:19:39.800]  The British East India Company took over and created what's modern India, before the British
[2:19:39.800 --> 2:19:45.200]  ever had to come in and back them up, they ran India and all those souls, and it was
[2:19:45.200 --> 2:19:50.040]  a private corporation, but it was still government, see, I'm for privatization, but not this
[2:19:50.040 --> 2:19:55.240]  counterfeit where they come in and just take over what the people built, jack up the prices
[2:19:55.240 --> 2:19:59.040]  and become the government themselves and get rid of due process, see the difference?
[2:19:59.040 --> 2:20:01.120]  It's all about labels, more calls coming up.
[2:20:01.120 --> 2:20:07.520]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you

[2:23:03.200 --> 2:23:04.200]  Claire, it's Anne.
[2:23:04.200 --> 2:23:08.360]  Hey, you know that hormone-balancing product we talked about before, the all-natural one?
[2:23:08.360 --> 2:23:09.360]  Ambrin?
[2:23:09.360 --> 2:23:14.080]  Well, I gotta tell you this, not only did Ambrin stop my hot flashes, but since I started
[2:23:14.080 --> 2:23:17.720]  the Ambrin program, I have lost so much weight.
[2:23:17.720 --> 2:23:19.960]  Seriously, even my belly fat, it's gone.
[2:23:19.960 --> 2:23:22.400]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[2:23:22.400 --> 2:23:23.400]  I feel great.
[2:23:23.400 --> 2:23:24.400]  Give me a call.
[2:23:24.400 --> 2:23:27.800]  The only cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[2:23:27.800 --> 2:23:31.680]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[2:23:31.680 --> 2:23:35.880]  Ambrin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off.
[2:23:35.880 --> 2:23:38.160]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[2:23:38.160 --> 2:23:41.240]  Plus, Ambrin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too.
[2:23:41.240 --> 2:23:45.680]  So with your hormones in balance, you can feel great and finally lose the weight.
[2:23:45.680 --> 2:23:49.320]  Be one of the first 50 callers right now, and they'll send you a complimentary risk-free
[2:23:49.320 --> 2:23:54.720]  trial with a 30-day supply, free, call 1-800-839-2959.
[2:23:54.720 --> 2:23:59.720]  That's 1-800-839-2959, 1-800-839-2959.
[2:23:59.720 --> 2:24:14.240]  Okay, I only got to one caller.
[2:24:14.240 --> 2:24:16.320]  I only got to one caller during that long segment.
[2:24:16.320 --> 2:24:17.480]  I gotta get to more of this stuff.
[2:24:17.480 --> 2:24:19.720]  I've got to cover this other news.
[2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:23.280]  Let's go to Carl in Texas, then Scott, Chris, Kyle, Ronnie, and Dave, and that's gonna
[2:24:23.280 --> 2:24:25.480]  be it for calls, so I gotta cover this news.
[2:24:25.480 --> 2:24:26.480]  Carl in Texas, welcome.
[2:24:26.480 --> 2:24:27.480]  Go ahead.
[2:24:27.480 --> 2:24:28.480]  Carl, drop.
[2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:29.480]  Boom.
[2:24:29.480 --> 2:24:30.480]  Scott in Washington.
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:31.480]  You're on the air.
[2:24:31.480 --> 2:24:32.480]  Alex, can you hear me?
[2:24:32.480 --> 2:24:33.480]  Yes, I can.
[2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:34.480]  Great.
[2:24:34.480 --> 2:24:35.480]  The reason I called is because...
[2:24:35.480 --> 2:24:36.480]  Yeah, bro.
[2:24:36.480 --> 2:24:37.480]  You're on air.
[2:24:37.480 --> 2:24:38.480]  Hold on just a minute.
[2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:39.480]  Can you hear me?
[2:24:39.480 --> 2:24:40.480]  Hold on just a minute, because I'm talking to you, and you said help me.
[2:24:40.480 --> 2:24:47.480]  He kept talking.
[2:24:47.480 --> 2:24:50.480]  Can you hear me, Scott?
[2:24:50.480 --> 2:24:51.480]  Yes.
[2:24:51.480 --> 2:24:52.480]  Okay, go ahead.
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:53.480]  You're on the air right now.
[2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:56.480]  I think it's amazing that I'm talking to Alex Jones.
[2:24:56.480 --> 2:25:01.480]  You're a big force helping Ron Paul's presidential campaign.
[2:25:01.480 --> 2:25:13.480]  I think that something I would like to suggest is to help revive the Ron Paul Rock the Revolution
[2:25:13.480 --> 2:25:15.480]  with that Carter.
[2:25:15.480 --> 2:25:24.480]  I know a guy that was on the Ron Paul Rock the Revolution tour before it fell apart.
[2:25:24.480 --> 2:25:26.480]  His name's Aaron Green.
[2:25:26.480 --> 2:25:28.480]  He's a consciousness rapper.
[2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:38.480]  He raps about all the things you talk about, and a 10 FEMA district, a 10-city tour with
[2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:45.480]  Willie Nelson, Dave Mustaine, you, Alex Jones, Jesse Ventura, collecting our signatures
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:48.480]  as a writing candidate for Ron Paul.
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:54.480]  You could go through 10 cities in the U.S. and collect millions of our signatures saying
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:58.480]  we want Ron Paul as our president, because this is our last chance.
[2:25:58.480 --> 2:26:03.480]  The trends, like Gerald Swindy said, the trends aren't getting better, yes.
[2:26:03.480 --> 2:26:04.480]  Hello?
[2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:06.480]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:08.480]  I don't know if you'll help.
[2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:09.480]  Thank you.
[2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:13.480]  I don't think that Dave Mustaine is going to...
[2:26:13.480 --> 2:26:14.480]  He likes Ron Paul.
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:17.480]  He told me yesterday on the phone he didn't really endorse Antwerp.
[2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:22.480]  He said that was out of context, but I don't know if Dave would be part of that tour.
[2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:28.480]  It's a big deal with managers and companies and people to try to get all these celebrities
[2:26:28.480 --> 2:26:29.480]  to do something together.
[2:26:29.480 --> 2:26:33.480]  That's why that's so hard, but it's an interesting idea.
[2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:35.480]  Let's go to Chris in Florida.
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:36.480]  Chris, you're on the air.
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:37.480]  Welcome.
[2:26:37.480 --> 2:26:38.480]  Hey, Alex.
[2:26:38.480 --> 2:26:44.480]  I was at the Orlando event, and it was so good.
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:46.480]  It went over so well.
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:50.480]  The audience was so hyped, and the movie was great.
[2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:58.480]  I was so glad that you showed your funny side at the beginning, because the movie went pretty
[2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:03.480]  deep and dark, but still, I recommend that everybody watch it.
[2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:11.480]  It's just essential viewing, and it's kind of like an addendum to Endgame.
[2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:18.480]  What I wanted to say, to tie that in, I guess, with Ron Paul, is, oh, I think also Alex,
[2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:24.480]  you should change the E in your middle name to Eugenics Jones, because if it wasn't for
[2:27:24.480 --> 2:27:33.080]  you bringing that back out into the lexicon, Eugenics is the whole heart and soul of the
[2:27:33.080 --> 2:27:39.480]  New World Order and how they operate, and they have just one thing left to implement
[2:27:39.480 --> 2:27:45.480]  their socialist agenda, which is healthcare, because you already have everything else.
[2:27:45.480 --> 2:27:46.480]  You have free food.
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:53.480]  And by the way, all the founders of modern Eugenics, Bertrand Russell, George Bernard Shaw,
[2:27:53.480 --> 2:27:58.480]  all of them, they said, under socialism, if we say you're not producing and we don't
[2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:00.480]  like you, we're going to kill you.
[2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:03.480]  People think socialists are trying to give poor people something.
[2:28:03.480 --> 2:28:04.480]  No.
[2:28:04.480 --> 2:28:09.480]  They want socialism to get you under control, to breed a giant underclass, to then use as
[2:28:09.480 --> 2:28:13.480]  an army against the middle class, and then in the next phase, they start killing the most
[2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:14.480]  of the people.
[2:28:14.480 --> 2:28:17.480]  And we're now seeing that with the death panels, all of it.
[2:28:17.480 --> 2:28:24.480]  So you're absolutely right, but as for the event there in Florida, it was amazing.
[2:28:24.480 --> 2:28:29.480]  And yes, it is by admitting how bad things are that we can then have a solution to it.
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:31.480]  But any other points you'd like to make?
[2:28:31.480 --> 2:28:32.480]  Yeah.
[2:28:32.480 --> 2:28:34.480]  And what I was going to say was it doesn't, yeah.
[2:28:34.480 --> 2:28:38.480]  And at the same time, it doesn't mean we can't have a sense of humor about it like you did
[2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:39.480]  at the beginning.
[2:28:39.480 --> 2:28:42.480]  But what I wanted to say too was, because this has been bugging me, and this guy bugs me
[2:28:42.480 --> 2:28:46.480]  every week, is Bill Maher.
[2:28:46.480 --> 2:28:52.480]  And what he said about Ron Paul, he'll have Ron Paul on in one day, or he'll go on and
[2:28:52.480 --> 2:28:59.480]  he'll talk, and he'll bring up Ron Paul when he's on MSNBC or somewhere, and he'll talk
[2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:00.480]  real good about him.
[2:29:00.480 --> 2:29:07.480]  But then I'll say, oh, he's crazy because he wants to go back to the gold standard, put
[2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:14.480]  us back on a gold standard, and he'll turn around and kind of stab him in the back.
[2:29:14.480 --> 2:29:19.480]  The other thing that he did, and I think all the sloppies that you know, and I actually
[2:29:19.480 --> 2:29:23.480]  have rubbed shoulders to the few of them, like Brad Pitt should be ashamed of himself
[2:29:23.480 --> 2:29:27.480]  going on Bill Maher, and saying that he's been to socialist countries, and that the
[2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:32.480]  Tea Party people that were going to events and saying, oh, oh, we're going to go to socialist
[2:29:32.480 --> 2:29:37.480]  countries, these people have never been to these countries, I have, and it works great,
[2:29:37.480 --> 2:29:40.480]  socialism works, it's okay, it's not as bad as you think.
[2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:42.480]  No, it doesn't, it said you create hell holes.
[2:29:42.480 --> 2:29:47.480]  I tell you what, stay there, I want you to finish your celebrity point, and then we'll
[2:29:47.480 --> 2:29:50.480]  get to the other callers, and then I'm getting to the news straight ahead.
[2:29:50.480 --> 2:29:54.480]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[2:29:54.480 --> 2:30:01.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:24.480 --> 2:30:31.480]  We're on the march.
[2:30:54.480 --> 2:31:01.480]  See Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[2:31:24.480 --> 2:31:31.480]  We're on the march.
[2:31:54.480 --> 2:32:02.480]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[2:32:02.480 --> 2:32:06.480]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[2:32:06.480 --> 2:32:07.480]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[2:32:07.480 --> 2:32:11.480]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[2:32:11.480 --> 2:32:12.480]  or gold?
[2:32:12.480 --> 2:32:16.480]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[2:32:16.480 --> 2:32:18.480]  possible that could even happen again.
[2:32:18.480 --> 2:32:22.480]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[2:32:22.480 --> 2:32:28.480]  seeds, they call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[2:32:28.480 --> 2:32:30.480]  dense food for you and your family.
[2:32:30.480 --> 2:32:34.480]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[2:32:34.480 --> 2:32:38.480]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[2:32:38.480 --> 2:32:41.480]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[2:32:41.480 --> 2:32:47.480]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[2:32:47.480 --> 2:32:52.480]  That's 877-327-0365.
[2:32:52.480 --> 2:32:57.480]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[2:32:57.480 --> 2:33:25.480]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[2:33:25.480 --> 2:33:28.480]  My friends, we stand at the crossroads.
[2:33:28.480 --> 2:33:33.480]  You ignore the information covered here daily at your own peril.
[2:33:33.480 --> 2:33:38.480]  You ignore the information, the blood, sweat, and tears we put out to bring you, the reports,
[2:33:38.480 --> 2:33:49.480]  the videos, the guests, the information at infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and prisonplanet.tv.
[2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:52.480]  We need to make hay while the sun shines.
[2:33:52.480 --> 2:33:57.480]  The globalists are coming down on us right now.
[2:33:57.480 --> 2:33:59.480]  This new world order is real.
[2:33:59.480 --> 2:34:01.480]  World government is real.
[2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:08.480]  Secret arrest of citizens, torture, poisoning of the food and water supply, it's all real.
[2:34:08.480 --> 2:34:17.480]  You are strong enough mentally out there if you're a new listener to at least research what I'm saying to you
[2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:21.480]  and find out that we haven't lied to you, we've told you the truth.
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:27.480]  I am begging you to go look at this information so you can see it from your own perspective
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:33.480]  and understand what we're facing so we can hopefully turn this around.
[2:34:33.480 --> 2:34:38.480]  Okay, I wanted to go back to Chris in Florida to finish this point
[2:34:38.480 --> 2:34:41.480]  and I've got to race through some of the other callers here as I've got to get to the news.
[2:34:41.480 --> 2:34:43.480]  Go ahead, Chris, finish up your point.
[2:34:43.480 --> 2:34:51.480]  Okay, and also if you're a new listener, you know that the police data is real because you get nervous every time there's a police officer, you know, pulling up behind you.
[2:34:51.480 --> 2:34:56.480]  And I see you on the road getting nervous and the change in the way that you drive and trying to switch lanes.
[2:34:56.480 --> 2:35:04.480]  But what I was talking about with celebrities who I think that they should be ashamed of themselves is, you know, like I said, Brad Pitt went on there
[2:35:04.480 --> 2:35:09.480]  and he talked about how he had been all over the world and socialism worked in other countries.
[2:35:09.480 --> 2:35:18.480]  Socialism has done a dismal failure everywhere that it's worked and suspiciously every war that America's fought with a socialist country we've lost.
[2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:21.480]  And we have to ask ourselves that.
[2:35:21.480 --> 2:35:25.480]  Well, that's because the same banking interests want a collectivism.
[2:35:25.480 --> 2:35:30.480]  They want a socialist or fascist command and control to control the money pot and shut down their competition.
[2:35:30.480 --> 2:35:37.480]  Carol Quigley wrote a 900-plus page book for the State Department that the plates then got out and he got real mad about it,
[2:35:37.480 --> 2:35:41.480]  they only published a thousand of them for internal publishing called Tragedy and Hope.
[2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:46.480]  And I've read his other book as well and he admits that the mega banks are monopoly men.
[2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:48.480]  He believes that's good.
[2:35:48.480 --> 2:35:52.480]  They work with fascist, communist, socialist, anything that's command and control.
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:35:56.480]  And look, I'm not going to get into Brad Pitt, but I'll just leave it at this.
[2:35:56.480 --> 2:36:04.480]  I first learned that Brad Pitt knew about the New World Order because I knew from Aaron Russo off record that he'd talked to him,
[2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:08.480]  he'd given him his film and that they thought it was very interesting that the Federal Reserve was private.
[2:36:08.480 --> 2:36:17.480]  Aaron Russo produced some big Hollywood movies with some pretty big stars and, of course, brought Rolling Stone to the U.S. and other things.
[2:36:17.480 --> 2:36:22.480]  He was a patriot, started the Constitutional Party, got involved with Ron Paul.
[2:36:22.480 --> 2:36:28.480]  Great guy died of cancer in 2007, made America free from the fascism, which I really regret I wasn't in.
[2:36:28.480 --> 2:36:33.480]  He called me over and over again and could never get through for like a year through my so-called office at the time.
[2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:37.480]  So I wasn't in that film, but great documentary out there.
[2:36:37.480 --> 2:36:39.480]  People should get it from his website.
[2:36:39.480 --> 2:36:43.480]  But the point is that then I'm just going to leave it at this.
[2:36:43.480 --> 2:36:49.480]  I learned later, I'm not going to get any more details, that Brad Pitt supposedly knows about the New World Order and his wife does.
[2:36:49.480 --> 2:36:51.480]  And people say, well, then why is she part of the CFR?
[2:36:51.480 --> 2:36:53.480]  Well, you could argue, well, to find out what's going on.
[2:36:53.480 --> 2:36:56.480]  She wants to become the establishment to deal with it.
[2:36:56.480 --> 2:36:58.480]  And I'm not going to say any more about Brad Pitt.
[2:36:58.480 --> 2:37:03.480]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:06.480]  But yes, then these guys think it's like Ed Asner.
[2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:12.480]  He's on later in the week because he was going to be on for a full hour, can only do 30 minutes a few weeks ago.
[2:37:12.480 --> 2:37:13.480]  He's a really good guy.
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:14.480]  He means well.
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:16.480]  And he really believes in socialism.
[2:37:16.480 --> 2:37:17.480]  He knows vaccines are bad.
[2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:19.480]  He knows 9-11's an inside job.
[2:37:19.480 --> 2:37:21.480]  He stands up against these wars.
[2:37:21.480 --> 2:37:25.480]  And then he sees the big system attacking someone like Chavez.
[2:37:25.480 --> 2:37:26.480]  Well, then Chavez must be good.
[2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:28.480]  See, it's the same thing with Cindy Sheehan.
[2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:30.480]  Well, Chavez is being attacked.
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:31.480]  He must be good.
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:35.480]  No, just because Iran's being attacked, that doesn't make them good.
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:36.480]  Their leadership.
[2:37:36.480 --> 2:37:44.480]  It's that the scientific crooks we've got are more organized and even more wicked than the wicked Iranian leadership.
[2:37:44.480 --> 2:37:47.480]  Okay, because power corrupts absolutely power corrupts.
[2:37:47.480 --> 2:37:48.480]  Absolutely.
[2:37:48.480 --> 2:37:52.480]  It's not, it's not that, you know, Syria is good and then Israel's bad.
[2:37:52.480 --> 2:37:54.480]  It's Israel has corrupt leadership.
[2:37:54.480 --> 2:37:56.480]  So does Syria.
[2:37:56.480 --> 2:37:58.480]  But the West isn't trying to fix Syria.
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:02.480]  They're invading with al-Qaeda to literally push the Christians out.
[2:38:02.480 --> 2:38:05.480]  They've said they are because the globalists hate real Christians.
[2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:11.480]  I mean, it's just, see, people either think like, well, America's good and you're before the wars or you don't like America.
[2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:14.480]  No, this isn't America doing this.
[2:38:14.480 --> 2:38:19.480]  These battleships, these aircraft carriers, these frigates, these jet aircraft don't belong to us.
[2:38:19.480 --> 2:38:20.480]  We pay for it.
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:23.480]  They tell us it's America, but it's not America.
[2:38:23.480 --> 2:38:29.480]  And the fact that they're going to use the NDAA and do all this to the American people and use the military against us, that's been the big wake up call.
[2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:31.480]  Go ahead, sir.
[2:38:31.480 --> 2:38:37.480]  Oh, and my pet peeve, Alex, real big pet peeve is some of your guests use this word democracy.
[2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:40.480]  And we are not a democracy.
[2:38:40.480 --> 2:38:42.480]  We are a republic.
[2:38:42.480 --> 2:38:49.480]  And I suggest if you haven't heard it, people type in Alex Jones, real American hero.
[2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:58.480]  And I get goosebumps when I listen to it because, you know, you kind of get into that when you're, you know, speaking in that courtroom.
[2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:03.480]  And, you know, you kind of go into what's the difference between democracy and your republic is.
[2:39:03.480 --> 2:39:07.480]  And, you know, they're left in the right way to extremes.
[2:39:07.480 --> 2:39:12.480]  And what is Alex Jones, real American hero?
[2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:14.480]  Oh, it's an actor or something.
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:16.480]  Is that the name of the video or something?
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:27.480]  Yeah, if you type it into YouTube and it was an excerpt, I think, from police date two or three.
[2:39:27.480 --> 2:39:40.480]  And I think the moment later, it's when you're when you're talking about the attorney general and you're saying why the Patriarch, they want to pass Patriarch one, Patriarch two, Patriarch one, Patriarch two.
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:42.480]  And then you went into the death.
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:50.480]  Yeah, you're talking about you're talking about Matrix of Evil when I was at the city council and the deputy attorney general was there and I gave that speech.
[2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:51.480]  Absolutely.
[2:39:51.480 --> 2:39:53.480]  That is a very powerful speech I gave.
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:39:55.480]  You're saying they call that on YouTube.
[2:39:55.480 --> 2:39:57.480]  Alex Jones, real American hero.
[2:39:57.480 --> 2:39:58.480]  Yeah.
[2:39:58.480 --> 2:39:59.480]  Yeah.
[2:39:59.480 --> 2:40:04.480]  And in case you forgot what a real American is, that's what I think is the description.
[2:40:04.480 --> 2:40:06.480]  It says, well, here it is.
[2:40:06.480 --> 2:40:07.480]  So everybody should watch that.
[2:40:07.480 --> 2:40:15.480]  It's a good speech. In fact, that's the speech that really woke up when he was given the Matrix of Evil, Emilio Estevez.
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:18.480]  And then he gave it to his dad, Martin Sheen, who really liked it.
[2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:22.480]  And then that's how Charlie Sheen became a listener was Matrix of Evil.
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:26.480]  And then they like ordered all my videos and locked themselves up and at their house.
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:30.480]  And I think it was at Emilio's house and like watched all 10 of my films at the time.
[2:40:30.480 --> 2:40:31.480]  This was like eight years ago.
[2:40:31.480 --> 2:40:34.480]  You know, watched all of them right there in one sitting.
[2:40:34.480 --> 2:40:37.480]  I guess I'm nine years ago, man, time flies.
[2:40:37.480 --> 2:40:39.480]  But yeah, that is a powerful speech.
[2:40:39.480 --> 2:40:40.480]  I wish it was shot better video.
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:43.480]  We just ended up getting the feed from the city council.
[2:40:43.480 --> 2:40:46.480]  But people thought that was a scripted speech too.
[2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:49.480]  That's when I really connect and get passionate sometimes.
[2:40:49.480 --> 2:40:51.480]  Also my speech to the Bilderberg.
[2:40:51.480 --> 2:40:53.480]  I've had film crews go, we know that scripted.
[2:40:53.480 --> 2:40:55.480]  We know that's not a real speech.
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:40:57.480]  I'm like, no, that's what came out of me.
[2:40:57.480 --> 2:41:01.480]  And those are two speeches I'm really proud of where I really connected and didn't hold back.
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:04.480]  I appreciate you calling in and bringing that up.
[2:41:04.480 --> 2:41:06.480]  Yeah, it's Alex Jones, real American hero.
[2:41:06.480 --> 2:41:12.480]  I guess he's you're saying is the name of what somebody called that when they reposted it on YouTube.
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:16.480]  The whole matrix of evil is on YouTube for free.
[2:41:16.480 --> 2:41:20.480]  Again, you can get all of my films, all 18 of them.
[2:41:20.480 --> 2:41:23.480]  Plus Jason Burmese's great film, Invisible Empire,
[2:41:23.480 --> 2:41:27.480]  our latest full-length feature we've produced that exposes the world government program.
[2:41:27.480 --> 2:41:31.480]  All of those for $99.95, 99 smackers.
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:33.480]  Normally be $380.
[2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:36.480]  Some of those films cost me over $150,000 to produce.
[2:41:36.480 --> 2:41:38.480]  In fact, Burmese's did.
[2:41:38.480 --> 2:41:42.480]  And I don't even really make my money back at that level.
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:45.480]  I mean, I usually don't even say you buy my DVDs now.
[2:41:45.480 --> 2:41:48.480]  I just say they're free online or see them in quality at Prison Planet.tv.
[2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:51.480]  But that's how we can do this in the future as you're supporting us.
[2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:53.480]  All right, I'll go to your calls in a minute,
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:56.480]  but I've got to get to this news now before I run out of time.
[2:41:56.480 --> 2:42:01.480]  In fact, we can put this up on screen for folks if you go to infowars.com.
[2:42:01.480 --> 2:42:06.480]  Here is some of the news that we've got up there right now
[2:42:06.480 --> 2:42:12.480]  that has just broken in the last two and a half hours since I got on air.
[2:42:12.480 --> 2:42:15.480]  Nanny State Walking is dangerous.
[2:42:15.480 --> 2:42:17.480]  I'm going to get to that in a minute.
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:22.480]  Also, throat got dry, excuse me.
[2:42:22.480 --> 2:42:28.480]  New film exposes the blueprint of madness unleashed by the New World Order.
[2:42:28.480 --> 2:42:31.480]  Ron Paul confronts Bernanke.
[2:42:31.480 --> 2:42:33.480]  Do you buy your own groceries?
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:38.480]  Professor says prevent interspecies,
[2:42:38.480 --> 2:42:41.480]  genocide, reduce current human numbers.
[2:42:41.480 --> 2:42:43.480]  They're constantly coming out.
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:47.480]  People yesterday, we had an article linking to the big journal of bioethics,
[2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:51.480]  the global group that sets the policies for the hospitals.
[2:42:51.480 --> 2:42:55.480]  You thought it was illegal to kill a child or kill an old person,
[2:42:55.480 --> 2:42:57.480]  even when they're not brain dead.
[2:42:57.480 --> 2:42:59.480]  Well, no, they have policies now.
[2:42:59.480 --> 2:43:02.480]  They say the death panels are the new policy, so it's okay.
[2:43:02.480 --> 2:43:04.480]  Of course, it's still illegal, but it's a policy.
[2:43:04.480 --> 2:43:07.480]  So they tell the cops that, and the cops are like, oh, okay.
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:11.480]  The big group advising the American Medical Association
[2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:15.480]  came out in the white paper and said, kill children up to the age of three
[2:43:15.480 --> 2:43:18.480]  if the state decides, even if they're not handicapped.
[2:43:18.480 --> 2:43:21.480]  Now it's not just kill handicapped folks, which is, of course, wrong,
[2:43:21.480 --> 2:43:23.480]  or kill babies because you're saying they're not humans.
[2:43:23.480 --> 2:43:26.480]  The logical extension is to say kill people up to age three
[2:43:26.480 --> 2:43:28.480]  and kill old people, as Bill Gates has said.
[2:43:28.480 --> 2:43:30.480]  We've played that clip.
[2:43:30.480 --> 2:43:34.480]  People in the YouTube yesterday video where I talked about that
[2:43:34.480 --> 2:43:38.480]  and people in our article that got hundreds, like 400 comments
[2:43:38.480 --> 2:43:42.480]  were saying it was saftyre and that the professors weren't serious
[2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:46.480]  and that the journal of bioethics wasn't serious
[2:43:46.480 --> 2:43:48.480]  and that I was a fair monger.
[2:43:48.480 --> 2:43:51.480]  Because, see, people are like, kill children up to age three
[2:43:51.480 --> 2:43:53.480]  who are even healthy.
[2:43:53.480 --> 2:43:56.480]  Well, this just can't be true. Alex Jones is bad.
[2:43:56.480 --> 2:43:58.480]  And you know what? I don't blame you.
[2:43:58.480 --> 2:44:01.480]  That's so over the top what they're doing openly.
[2:44:01.480 --> 2:44:04.480]  You'd have to admit I was right about all this.
[2:44:04.480 --> 2:44:09.480]  This isn't just some, you know, the big global journal of bioethics.
[2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:12.480]  And so you're just going to say, I'm a liar.
[2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:15.480]  Or, oh, it's in the big journal
[2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:18.480]  and it's adopted by the American Medical Association.
[2:44:18.480 --> 2:44:21.480]  They say they follow this as their handbook.
[2:44:21.480 --> 2:44:25.480]  But they're joking in this white paper. No, they're not.
[2:44:25.480 --> 2:44:28.480]  I could list you hundreds of papers you can pull up
[2:44:28.480 --> 2:44:30.480]  of heads of major university departments.
[2:44:30.480 --> 2:44:33.480]  Peter Singer, the one says kill kids up to three.
[2:44:33.480 --> 2:44:37.480]  This latest journal is just repeating what he puts out.
[2:44:37.480 --> 2:44:42.480]  Okay? But people are saying that it can't be true.
[2:44:42.480 --> 2:44:46.480]  And I understand why. Just like when I said NDAA,
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:48.480]  we were the first to put articles out about it.
[2:44:48.480 --> 2:44:51.480]  When we saw the legislation, listeners pointed it out to us.
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:54.480]  Paul Watson wrote articles saying NDAA allows secret arrest
[2:44:54.480 --> 2:44:57.480]  and imprisonment of citizens and killing.
[2:44:57.480 --> 2:45:00.480]  And for about two weeks, the media said it was a hoax
[2:45:00.480 --> 2:45:02.480]  and I was a liar.
[2:45:02.480 --> 2:45:06.480]  And I had people calling them saying, I'm done with you.
[2:45:06.480 --> 2:45:09.480]  Obama says it doesn't affect citizens, plus he's going to veto it.
[2:45:09.480 --> 2:45:13.480]  Now they all admit it affects citizens and say they've got the power to do it.
[2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:15.480]  But I'm still wrong. See, I'm still bad.
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:18.480]  So they're not saying kill kids up to three.
[2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:21.480]  And I guess Bill Gates doesn't say get rid of grandma and hire 10 teachers.
[2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:24.480]  I mean, I could play the clip. I was on ManCal this morning
[2:45:24.480 --> 2:45:28.480]  and he knew enough about it to suddenly play the clip when I mentioned it.
[2:45:28.480 --> 2:45:32.480]  You can just type in Bill Gates on death panels.
[2:45:32.480 --> 2:45:35.480]  Time magazine or was it Newsweek cover, the case for killing Granny
[2:45:35.480 --> 2:45:38.480]  with an image of a woman being unplugged.
[2:45:38.480 --> 2:45:40.480]  But you know what?
[2:45:40.480 --> 2:45:43.480]  That's like when the urban warfare ships landed in 1999
[2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:47.480]  and openly trained to take your guns and take over Oakland and San Francisco
[2:45:47.480 --> 2:45:50.480]  and take your guns.
[2:45:50.480 --> 2:45:52.480]  And they admitted it was for America.
[2:45:52.480 --> 2:45:55.480]  And people saw that video and they said he hired that ship
[2:45:55.480 --> 2:45:59.480]  and he hired those Marines.
[2:45:59.480 --> 2:46:02.480]  And even when it went on Google video about eight, nine years ago
[2:46:02.480 --> 2:46:05.480]  and back then it was all pixelated and stuff because it was low res.
[2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:10.480]  People saw a little pixelation and stuff and said, oh, it's CG.
[2:46:10.480 --> 2:46:12.480]  The Marines didn't land in Oakland.
[2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:16.480]  They didn't go look it up in the newspapers and find out that was a real thing that happened.
[2:46:16.480 --> 2:46:18.480]  They just said it's CG. Alex was lying.
[2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:21.480]  You know, he's got thousands of troops hired and it's all fake.
[2:46:21.480 --> 2:46:25.480]  So you know what? They're not saying kill kids up to three who are even healthy.
[2:46:25.480 --> 2:46:28.480]  They're not saying kill Granny. They're not trained to take our guns.
[2:46:28.480 --> 2:46:30.480]  They're not trained to use the military against us.
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:32.480]  They're not doing any of this. I'm a dirty liar.
[2:46:32.480 --> 2:46:34.480]  I'm a dirty piece of garbage, okay?
[2:46:34.480 --> 2:46:35.480]  I'm the bad guy.
[2:46:35.480 --> 2:46:40.480]  They're publishing a killer flu that kills over 85 to 90 plus percent of people
[2:46:40.480 --> 2:46:45.480]  that come in contact with it, that now bridges the gap from the birds to humans.
[2:46:45.480 --> 2:46:49.480]  And I am the bad guy for being worried about that.
[2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:52.480]  And they're releasing how to build it to the public.
[2:46:52.480 --> 2:46:53.480]  I'm the bad guy.
[2:46:53.480 --> 2:46:57.480]  And if they release it and a billion people die, I'll still be the bad guy.
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:46:59.480]  Okay. I'm the bad man.
[2:46:59.480 --> 2:47:02.480]  I take the blame. I'm evil. I'm bad. I'm bad.
[2:47:02.480 --> 2:47:05.480]  I beat myself in the head. I'm sorry that I'm right.
[2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:07.480]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay?
[2:47:07.480 --> 2:47:08.480]  I'm real sorry.
[2:47:08.480 --> 2:47:12.480]  I'm real sorry cancer rates up over 2,000 percent in the last decade
[2:47:12.480 --> 2:47:14.480]  and diabetes and everything else. I'm sorry.
[2:47:14.480 --> 2:47:16.480]  Okay? The elite are nice. They love us.
[2:47:16.480 --> 2:47:19.480]  They want to kiss us on the cheek all day and play paddy cake with us.
[2:47:19.480 --> 2:47:20.480]  All right?
[2:47:20.480 --> 2:47:22.480]  You people make me want to throw up.
[2:47:22.480 --> 2:47:24.480]  I hope those are just ignoramuses, though,
[2:47:24.480 --> 2:47:30.480]  because if those are actual Cointel Pro and actual paid sock puppets that they admit they have on the web,
[2:47:30.480 --> 2:47:38.480]  coming on the site saying, I'm lying about them wanting to kill kids up to age three when I'm linked to all of it.
[2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:44.480]  You people that work for the government, the corporations that are, you are now citing to kill little kids.
[2:47:44.480 --> 2:47:48.480]  Man, you people make me want to throw up.
[2:47:48.480 --> 2:47:51.480]  And of course, when it gets more mainstream and they actually start killing kids,
[2:47:51.480 --> 2:47:54.480]  you'll be like, well, that's reasonable because the state says they're not a human.
[2:47:54.480 --> 2:47:58.480]  The state says they're not conscious yet up to age three.
[2:47:58.480 --> 2:48:00.480]  My kids were conscious when they came out of the womb.
[2:48:00.480 --> 2:48:03.480]  At two years old, they had electricity in their eyes.
[2:48:03.480 --> 2:48:10.480]  My daughter, my first born daughter, my son's first born, but the first daughter, I have two daughters.
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:14.480]  This happened to an extent with the other two, but with her.
[2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:20.480]  When they held her up and her eyes, man, were just on electric with consciousness looking at me,
[2:48:20.480 --> 2:48:24.480]  and I said, whoa, this one is going to be wild.
[2:48:24.480 --> 2:48:28.480]  And you've all experienced it, and you're going to tell me you're going to kill them.
[2:48:28.480 --> 2:48:30.480]  You're a bunch of scum.
[2:48:30.480 --> 2:48:35.480]  And those of you that serve this and are in denial, you're going to bring down all the hell that we're about to face.
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:37.480]  I hope we can still avert it.
[2:48:37.480 --> 2:48:43.480]  But those of you that attack those of us trying to warn people are just have no idea the danger you're in.
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:46.480]  You have no idea how serious this tyranny is.
[2:48:46.480 --> 2:48:53.480]  And I'm here risking my life trying to warn people, and I'm sick of people living in denial.
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:48:57.480]  Let's go to the short clip of Ron Paul, the full clips up at infowars.com.
[2:48:57.480 --> 2:48:59.480]  Big story about Steve Watts and Ron Paul confronts Bernanke.
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:01.480]  Do you buy your own groceries?
[2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:05.480]  To show how disconnected from reality these globalists are telling us there's no inflation.
[2:49:05.480 --> 2:49:07.480]  Here it is.
[2:49:07.480 --> 2:49:08.480]  Dr. Paul.
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:09.480]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[2:49:09.480 --> 2:49:15.480]  Mr. Bernanke, if you don't mind, would you tell me whether or not you do your own shopping at the grocery store?
[2:49:15.480 --> 2:49:16.480]  Yes, I do.
[2:49:16.480 --> 2:49:18.480]  Okay, so you're aware of the prices.
[2:49:18.480 --> 2:49:22.480]  But you know, this argument that prices are going up about 2%, nobody believes it.
[2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:26.480]  You know, and the old CPI says prices are going up at 9%, they believe this.
[2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:29.480]  And people on fixed incomes, they're really hurting.
[2:49:29.480 --> 2:49:35.480]  The middle class is really hurting because their inflation rate is very much higher than the government tries to tell them.
[2:49:35.480 --> 2:49:38.480]  And that's why they lose trust in government.
[2:49:38.480 --> 2:49:48.480]  But you know, this whole idea about prices and debasement of currency, if you loan me $100 and in two years from now I gave you 90 back, you'd be pretty upset.
[2:49:48.480 --> 2:49:54.480]  But we hand back that money back that's worth 10 or 15 or 20% less.
[2:49:54.480 --> 2:49:58.480]  And nobody seems to be able to do anything about it, but it's very upsetting.
[2:49:58.480 --> 2:49:59.480]  But it's theft.
[2:49:59.480 --> 2:50:05.480]  If I don't give you your full $100 back, if you've loaned me $100, somebody, I'm stealing $10 from you.
[2:50:05.480 --> 2:50:08.480]  So somebody's stealing wealth, and this is very upsetting.
[2:50:08.480 --> 2:50:19.480]  But you know, in January at one of your press conferences you said that you sort of poked a little bit of fun at people to don't play the 2% inflation rate.
[2:50:19.480 --> 2:50:24.480]  But if you say it's 2%, and I say it's 9%, it's compromised for the sake of argument that it's 5%.
[2:50:24.480 --> 2:50:32.480]  That you said that it doesn't hurt you unless you're one of those people who stick the money in the mattress.
[2:50:32.480 --> 2:50:35.480]  But where are you going to put it?
[2:50:35.480 --> 2:50:38.480]  All right, the whole clip, there's a lot more.
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:40.480]  It's up at infowords.com.
[2:50:40.480 --> 2:50:41.480]  But that's why we love Ron Paul.
[2:50:41.480 --> 2:50:48.480]  What a good gentlemanly person actually trying to expose the fraud of that big fat mafia crook, Ben Bernanke.
[2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:49.480]  Who lied there?
[2:50:49.480 --> 2:50:52.480]  I'll guarantee you that slime bag and buying his own groceries.
[2:50:52.480 --> 2:50:59.480]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break and jam in a few more news stories and then try to finish up with your calls.
[2:50:59.480 --> 2:51:00.480]  I haven't gotten to the nanny state yet.
[2:51:00.480 --> 2:51:05.480]  I want to spend walking me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[2:51:05.480 --> 2:51:06.480]  Everyone can feel it.
[2:51:06.480 --> 2:51:15.480]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage and enslavement.
[2:51:15.480 --> 2:51:19.480]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[2:51:19.480 --> 2:51:24.480]  But take heart for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[2:51:24.480 --> 2:51:29.480]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[2:51:29.480 --> 2:51:33.480]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[2:51:33.480 --> 2:51:36.480]  The globalists are scared. They've overreached.
[2:51:36.480 --> 2:51:39.480]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[2:53:00.480 --> 2:53:06.480]  In the past, I've taken a lot of different vitamins, some through health food stores, some that friends recommend.
[2:53:06.480 --> 2:53:09.480]  Colleen, talking about her experience with Super Seavage.
[2:53:09.480 --> 2:53:12.480]  And with the Super Seavage, I was seeing a lot better results.

[2:54:34.480 --> 2:54:37.480]  Escape from the prison planet. That's what we're trying to do here.
[2:54:37.480 --> 2:54:39.480]  Let me blitz through some of the other news.
[2:54:39.480 --> 2:54:41.480]  Goodbye First Amendment.
[2:54:41.480 --> 2:54:44.480]  Trespass bill will make protesting legal.
[2:54:44.480 --> 2:54:50.480]  And the Feds, the House of Representatives has passed 388-3 as they circle the wagons against the American people.
[2:54:50.480 --> 2:54:53.480]  HR 347.
[2:54:53.480 --> 2:55:01.480]  And any federal parks, federal buildings, commons areas, now it's going to be trespassing to be on.
[2:55:01.480 --> 2:55:06.480]  Let me tell you, I've been to D.C. and I've been to third world countries.
[2:55:06.480 --> 2:55:10.480]  Nowhere are you treated in the world like abject trash.
[2:55:10.480 --> 2:55:14.480]  Like you are with a camera, including ladies with their kids.
[2:55:14.480 --> 2:55:16.480]  It wasn't just us.
[2:55:16.480 --> 2:55:18.480]  Washington Monument, videotaping it.
[2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:23.480]  Women with their kids, tourists. Security guards come over.
[2:55:23.480 --> 2:55:25.480]  Get in your face.
[2:55:25.480 --> 2:55:27.480]  Cops come over, get in your face.
[2:55:27.480 --> 2:55:29.480]  Try to videotape the White House.
[2:55:29.480 --> 2:55:30.480]  Goons come over.
[2:55:30.480 --> 2:55:33.480]  I mean, this country is pathetic.
[2:55:33.480 --> 2:55:35.480]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[2:55:35.480 --> 2:55:36.480]  Give me a break.
[2:55:36.480 --> 2:55:38.480]  I love this nation.
[2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:39.480]  I want to get it back.
[2:55:39.480 --> 2:55:41.480]  But Washington is a group of crooks robbing us.
[2:55:41.480 --> 2:55:46.480]  And when you come there, you are being taught that you're trash.
[2:55:46.480 --> 2:55:48.480]  I mean, you want to experience it.
[2:55:48.480 --> 2:55:54.480]  Go D.C. and be prepared for the scum that works for this government to let you know you are the enemy.
[2:55:54.480 --> 2:55:58.480]  I mean, they act like the public, people with their kids are the enemy.
[2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:03.480]  We've seen the famous footage of people pulled over by a police officer in a neighborhood.
[2:56:03.480 --> 2:56:06.480]  It happened to get caught on the squad car tape.
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:08.480]  And they said, oh, hi, officer.
[2:56:08.480 --> 2:56:10.480]  Can you please tell us where this road is? We're lost.
[2:56:10.480 --> 2:56:12.480]  They just said, that's it. Get over there. You're arrested.
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:13.480]  You don't ask me questions.
[2:56:13.480 --> 2:56:14.480]  Handcuffs took them to jail.
[2:56:14.480 --> 2:56:18.480]  In D.C., even the Washington Times reported a few years ago,
[2:56:18.480 --> 2:56:24.480]  the police, off duty, own their own record companies and pull into McDonald's and other parking lots
[2:56:24.480 --> 2:56:30.480]  and take cars parked legally and demand up to $1,000 to get them back.
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:32.480]  In uniform, off duty.
[2:56:32.480 --> 2:56:34.480]  And the police say, yeah, you're allowed to do that.
[2:56:34.480 --> 2:56:35.480]  The union runs everything.
[2:56:35.480 --> 2:56:36.480]  They're a total mafia.
[2:56:36.480 --> 2:56:39.480]  This is the way all of America is going.
[2:56:39.480 --> 2:56:46.480]  Just abject criminals and thugs scum working for them who want you to know the gang raping is here.
[2:56:46.480 --> 2:56:47.480]  And go read it.
[2:56:47.480 --> 2:56:49.480]  You will not even stand.
[2:56:49.480 --> 2:56:50.480]  You're all going to jail.
[2:56:50.480 --> 2:56:52.480]  The parasites rule.
[2:56:52.480 --> 2:56:54.480]  You pay their salary, and that's it.
[2:56:54.480 --> 2:56:56.480]  So there you go.
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:56:58.480]  Again, we're going to premiere tonight.
[2:56:58.480 --> 2:57:01.480]  My 40-minute documentary, New World Order,
[2:57:01.480 --> 2:57:04.480]  Blueprint of Mad Men, showing the real threats.
[2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:07.480]  19 signs that America has become a control freak,
[2:57:07.480 --> 2:57:11.480]  crazy control freak nation where almost everything is illegal.
[2:57:11.480 --> 2:57:15.480]  And of course, we also have our video that breaks all of that down.
[2:57:15.480 --> 2:57:17.480]  That's up at infowars.com.
[2:57:17.480 --> 2:57:19.480]  I mean, here's just some of them.
[2:57:19.480 --> 2:57:20.480]  I should have read this earlier.
[2:57:20.480 --> 2:57:24.480]  One California town is actually considering making it illegal to smoke in your own backyard.
[2:57:24.480 --> 2:57:27.480]  Louisiana, a church, was recently ordered to stop giving out water
[2:57:27.480 --> 2:57:29.480]  because it did not have a permit to do so.
[2:57:29.480 --> 2:57:34.480]  Number three in the United States, it is illegal to operate a train that does not have an F painted on the front.
[2:57:34.480 --> 2:57:38.480]  Apparently, without the F, we all might not know where the front of the train is.
[2:57:38.480 --> 2:57:43.480]  Number four, in many U.S. states, it is now illegal to collect rainwater that falls from the sky on your own property.
[2:57:43.480 --> 2:57:48.480]  Number five, in America today, it's illegal to milk your own cow and sell the milk to your neighbor.
[2:57:48.480 --> 2:57:53.480]  Number six, in Washington, D.C., it's illegal to not recycle cat litter, $1,000 fines.
[2:57:53.480 --> 2:57:58.480]  Number seven, it's illegal to give your tour of the monuments in D.C. without a license.
[2:57:58.480 --> 2:58:03.480]  Number eight, in the United States, it is illegal to sell natural cures for cancer even if they work.
[2:58:03.480 --> 2:58:07.480]  Number nine, the state of Massachusetts is illegal to deface a milk carton.
[2:58:07.480 --> 2:58:11.480]  Number 10, in the state of Alabama, bear wrestling is completely illegal.
[2:58:11.480 --> 2:58:14.480]  In Fairbanks, Alaska, it's illegal to give alcoholic beverages to a moose.
[2:58:14.480 --> 2:58:22.480]  Number 12, in Lake Elmo, Minnesota, it's illegal to sell pumpkins or Christmas trees that are grown outside city limits.
[2:58:22.480 --> 2:58:25.480]  There's a federal law that makes it illegal to be annoying on the Internet.
[2:58:25.480 --> 2:58:30.480]  We have links to all these, 14. I can't even get to it all.
[2:58:30.480 --> 2:58:36.480]  And then I have video of signs saying you can't walk on the boardwalk because people might trip.
[2:58:36.480 --> 2:59:01.480]  So now they put little concrete paths you've got to walk on because old-fashioned boardwalks aren't safe.
