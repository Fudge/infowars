[00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:10.029]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:11.611]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.152]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:17.356]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:21.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.206 --> 00:00:43.879]  Here we are, February 29th, 2012 on this Worldwide Wednesday Broadcast and we are basically ending up where we started.
[00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.863]  I'll be back in Austin, Texas this evening.
[00:00:46.863 --> 00:00:49.206]  I am coming to you from overlooking the Mississippi River.
[00:00:49.246 --> 00:00:50.567]  We're good to go.
[00:01:10.313 --> 00:01:14.457]  Got creamed in multiple states yesterday.
[00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:17.841]  There is evidence of election fraud.
[00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:21.644]  There is not as clear an evidence as Maine in Iowa.
[00:01:21.644 --> 00:01:29.873]  And I'll be breaking down coming up after the break exactly how the system manufactures consent with the population.
[00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:32.735]  And I've been telling people from the start Ron Paul could win.
[00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:48.840]  But expect massive election fraud in early primaries to then create the perception that he's losing so people get into a bandwagon type scenario and start voting for who they think is going to win, not who they think is the right person, and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.001]  You see this with Obama, and of course we're now seeing this with Mittens-Romney.
[00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:57.163]  And you can't be mad at Ron Paul.
[00:01:57.163 --> 00:01:58.365]  The campaign still goes on.
[00:01:58.365 --> 00:02:04.971]  He's still informing people, still educating people, still bringing up real issues, still building a movement for liberty.
[00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:07.553]  But the fix is in.
[00:02:07.553 --> 00:02:10.716]  So we have to have a discussion, a larger discussion about that.
[00:02:10.716 --> 00:02:14.820]  And I specifically want to hear from callers here in the first hour.
[00:02:15.954 --> 00:02:23.360]  on your views of what you've seen with the Ron Paul campaign and where all of this is going, specifically on all things Ron Paul.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.407]  Election fraud, the electoral process, it's a very wide field to discuss and we're going to go to calls early in this hour, in fact next segment.
[00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:32.448]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:02:32.448 --> 00:02:32.508]  800-259-9231.
[00:02:32.508 --> 00:02:34.770]  We are discussing the wide electoral process, the evidence of fraud,
[00:02:43.649 --> 00:03:00.269]  Where do you think this election is going, and what do you think is going to unfold if we end up with Mittens, Romney, or Barack Hussein, the New World Order minion, Obama, both teleprompter readers who support open borders, global taxation, global government, carbon taxes, gun registration and control, abortion, the list goes on and on.
[00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:10.338]  800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air here today on this Wednesday edition.
[00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:18.004]  Also, we have Foster Gamble of the Procter & Gamble fortune and his wife, Kimberly Gamble, joining us.
[00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:22.108]  A few months ago, I started getting phone calls saying, what do you think of this new movie, Thrive?
[00:03:22.108 --> 00:03:23.729]  And I said, I can't comment on it.
[00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:24.330]  I haven't seen it.
[00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:35.696]  And so the crew watched it and had mixed feelings on it, but overall thought it was coming from a positive place of getting people outside the box and expanding their paradigm.
[00:03:35.696 --> 00:03:39.039]  And we are now carrying the film.
[00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.402]  I've had a chance to go over it, and I think that overall
[00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:50.604]  I agree with about 80% of what's in the film, and I do think they're coming from a position of really legitimately trying to wake people up.
[00:03:50.604 --> 00:03:53.346]  The globalists are not going to be happy with this film.
[00:03:53.346 --> 00:04:00.671]  It's trying to get people outside the box, and I think it'll really wake up people on the traditional left and kind of new-ager types.
[00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:04.353]  It's got a little bit of UFO stuff in it, asking, what is this?
[00:04:04.353 --> 00:04:05.914]  Are we being lied to about that?
[00:04:05.914 --> 00:04:10.157]  It's all about, we've been lied to about all these other things, WMDs, the private Federal Reserve.
[00:04:10.157 --> 00:04:11.238]  What else are we being lied to about?
[00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:16.647]  The government giving us cancer on purpose to reduce population.
[00:04:16.647 --> 00:04:23.571]  It gets into technologies being suppressed, new forms of energy being suppressed on record.
[00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:28.455]  So it covers a lot of things that are very important to waking up humanity.
[00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:32.638]  And then it just asks questions about other big issues and says it should all be investigated.
[00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:41.003]  And the most controversial part to liberals that watch it is the individual liberty, kind of Ron Paul libertarian constitutional position.
[00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:43.225]  And it's something really waking liberals up.
[00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:47.066]  And so that's why we're carrying it at InfoWars.com.
[00:04:47.066 --> 00:04:47.787]  We'll tell you about that.
[00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.848]  They're going to be joining us as well coming up.
[00:04:50.848 --> 00:04:54.129]  And also, the nanny state wants to restrict walking now.
[00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.609]  Stay with us.
[00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:55.790]  We'll cover it after the break.
[00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:56.770]  InfoWars.com.
[00:05:01.394 --> 00:05:16.868]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.

[00:07:00.643 --> 00:07:01.703]  I had tried everything.
[00:07:01.703 --> 00:07:04.064]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:07:04.064 --> 00:07:07.185]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:07:07.185 --> 00:07:12.027]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:07:12.027 --> 00:07:18.890]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:29.334]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:07:30.094 --> 00:07:34.557]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:07:34.557 --> 00:07:40.821]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:42.402]  Now that's results.
[00:07:42.402 --> 00:07:49.187]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:07:49.187 --> 00:07:54.911]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.958]  Texas Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.242]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:19.686]  It is Wednesday, the 29th day of February, 2012.
[00:08:19.686 --> 00:08:24.407]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:24.407 --> 00:08:32.128]  I've been on the road for the last week and a half, but I'll be back in studio, deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, Texas, tomorrow.
[00:08:32.128 --> 00:08:45.111]  This has been a successful experiment being on the road, so I am 90% sure I'm going to do a big western tour, probably visiting six or seven affiliates going through New Mexico, Arizona,
[00:08:46.717 --> 00:08:51.844]  California, Oregon, Washington, Utah, maybe Montana.
[00:08:53.015 --> 00:09:03.060]  Wyoming down into Colorado and then back to Texas and then maybe we still have a country in World War three hadn't started yet at the end of the summer in the fall I'll do a shorter week-long trip.
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:14.686]  It's a lot of folks want to see us up in Oklahoma City, Kansas City where I had an event like eight nine years ago and had like 800 people come out to and then up into maybe Chicago, Minneapolis, St.
[00:09:14.686 --> 00:09:17.668]  Paul, maybe Detroit and then come back down and hit
[00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:22.010]  Maybe some other town somewhere and come back to Austin.
[00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:31.013]  Because it is important for me to get outside the command base occasionally and let the crew there do the nightly news and all the great work they're doing.
[00:09:31.013 --> 00:09:37.536]  Because we're trying to build an organization of reporters and investigators, not just Alex Jones.
[00:09:37.536 --> 00:09:39.877]  And all of us are doing this together.
[00:09:39.877 --> 00:09:42.378]  All of you out there taking action and supporting what we're doing.
[00:09:42.378 --> 00:09:43.899]  We couldn't do any of this without you
[00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:46.181]  So I salute you and thank all of you.
[00:09:46.181 --> 00:09:56.831]  I want to thank our sponsors, listeners, AM and FM affiliates, Global Shortwave, Satellite, Channel 166 on XM, Sirius, and of course, everybody spreading the word online.
[00:09:56.831 --> 00:10:02.636]  We need to use the Internet while it's still free to some extent because the system is trying to make the Internet go dark.
[00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:06.219]  So twofold, we fight for the future openness and freedom of the Internet.
[00:10:07.082 --> 00:10:11.705]  The electronic soapbox and system of commerce that the globalists want to control.
[00:10:11.705 --> 00:10:14.947]  But we also use it like we're going to lose it.
[00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:18.769]  Better make hay while the sun is shining.
[00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:21.591]  I know I've done a lot of rural work on farms and ranches growing up.
[00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:23.312]  Most summers sent down to grandma's.
[00:10:23.312 --> 00:10:28.595]  One year worked for a large animal vet for about nine, ten months.
[00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:33.898]  And I know that there were a lot of times in the summer when they were making hay that people'd stay up till midnight.
[00:10:35.157 --> 00:10:47.580]  Because the hay is ready to be cut, it's valuable, and that's how you're going to pay the taxes, that's how you're going to pay the workers, that's how you're going to have enough hay for your cows that winter, and that's how you're going to have enough hay to make money and sell it to others.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:57.523]  And if you don't cut it when it's right, and a rainstorm, you know, is coming in three days, the weatherman says, and it's going to ruin that grass if it gets really wet, and you're not going to be able to, you know, really have that hay
[00:10:58.403 --> 00:11:00.244]  Now I'm getting off into agriculture.
[00:11:00.244 --> 00:11:02.965]  You've got to make hay while the sun is shining.
[00:11:02.965 --> 00:11:11.147]  You want to cut that big tall green grass when the sun is shining and it's dry or it'll get all moldy and get fungus all over it and make your cows sick.
[00:11:11.147 --> 00:11:15.449]  Side issue, I'm now getting off into animal husbandry as well.
[00:11:15.449 --> 00:11:19.930]  So you make hay while the sun is shining.
[00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.992]  And it was many times I'd crawl into bed at midnight and then
[00:11:26.286 --> 00:11:40.731]  I'd pull back up the different ranches and stuff I was working at and have old men call me a wimp for being 20 minutes late at 5.30 in the morning while they were stomping around, getting all fired up about running around like piranhas or fire ants working.
[00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:42.651]  It's that type of energy.
[00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:44.412]  By the way, you see all these rodeos.
[00:11:45.899 --> 00:11:53.803]  You know, all this kind of Western culture stuff, that's all really a facsimile of the real Western culture, where people really do work hard.
[00:11:53.803 --> 00:11:54.943]  And they're not just macho.
[00:11:54.943 --> 00:11:57.844]  You've got to get fired up to work like that.
[00:11:57.844 --> 00:12:09.630]  And it actually becomes kind of a, at least what I've seen working on ranches, and especially working for that large animal vet, is a type of crazed, crazed action, where I guess it just makes the day go.
[00:12:11.331 --> 00:12:14.513]  And faster to get wild.
[00:12:14.513 --> 00:12:17.594]  You see, though, that's how my brain works.
[00:12:17.594 --> 00:12:20.455]  I am now digressing off into memories.
[00:12:20.455 --> 00:12:31.100]  And I guess the show's successful because people know it's not scripted, but I've got all this incredible news that I've got to get to and then your phone calls and then some big guests as well today.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:31.380]  But...
[00:12:34.246 --> 00:12:39.210]  Maybe I'm procrastinating getting to the news because it's really what I thought was going to happen.
[00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:45.074]  And then people are going to ask me, well, then why did you say get behind Ron Paul 110%?
[00:12:45.074 --> 00:12:48.216]  Well, because I told you from the start, I believe this would happen.
[00:12:48.216 --> 00:12:52.139]  There was a slight chance that the Ron Paul support would be so overwhelming.
[00:12:53.149 --> 00:13:02.194]  That he could turbocharge, all of us could basically ram the gates and crash through the lies of disinformation and actually get him in.
[00:13:02.194 --> 00:13:14.261]  But then they would try to steal the general election, and then if he got in, they would pull out every dirty trick on earth, guaranteed false flags, you name it, and probably try to blame libertarian ideas for the collapse that they've already engineered.
[00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:16.902]  So then people will ask, well, then why did you support Ron Paul?
[00:13:16.902 --> 00:13:18.183]  And are you saying it's all over?
[00:13:18.783 --> 00:13:19.724]  No, it's just begun.
[00:13:19.724 --> 00:13:22.408]  And what am I talking about here?
[00:13:22.408 --> 00:13:30.839]  And we're going to open the phones up for people specifically to give us your take on the campaign, on the election fraud, on where you see things are going.
[00:13:30.839 --> 00:13:34.804]  In fact, the line's already loaded up and I'll get to those coming up here in a few minutes, then all the other news.
[00:13:35.819 --> 00:13:38.261]  Romney wins in Arizona and Michigan.
[00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:41.042]  Santorum falls short in upset attempt.
[00:13:41.042 --> 00:13:47.787]  Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney cruised an easy victory in Arizona primary Tuesday and eked out a narrow one in Michigan.
[00:13:47.787 --> 00:13:54.011]  A double win that steadied a campaign shaken in recent weeks by surging support for rival Rick Santorum.
[00:13:54.011 --> 00:13:55.572]  You know, notice you never hear
[00:13:58.615 --> 00:14:02.998]  Mitt Romney getting in trouble for being financed by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, just like Obama.
[00:14:02.998 --> 00:14:05.319]  Or supporting abortion and then flip-flopping.
[00:14:05.319 --> 00:14:08.021]  Or being for open borders or carbon taxes.
[00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:12.304]  It's always, oh, I love Detroit, we've got two Cadillacs.
[00:14:12.304 --> 00:14:15.946]  And then it's like, he's bad because he's got two Cadillacs.
[00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:22.230]  It is rich people that buy Cadillacs and get their hair done and buy clothes and have people that work for them.
[00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:30.211]  The more rich people you've got, the more jobs you've got, the richer an economy you've got, if they're rich people that got their money through the free market.
[00:14:30.211 --> 00:14:37.293]  If they're cronies, like Mitt Romney, who got it through consolidation and stealing, mainly, they are the plague.
[00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:40.893]  But to demonize him for two Cadillacs is crazy.
[00:14:40.893 --> 00:14:47.754]  I mean, what, would you rather be poor, like some third world country, where only one guy in the city has a Cadillac?
[00:14:47.754 --> 00:14:50.215]  Or like North Korea, where only Kim Jong-il's got a Cadillac?
[00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:54.951]  Rising tides do raise all ships.
[00:14:54.951 --> 00:15:01.577]  If it's not a globalist rising tide, where they divert all the water out to their private lake, steal our water, take over the system.
[00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:12.833]  And, uh, you know, they're going after him at the Daytona 500 for saying, oh, man, you know, I don't follow NASCAR as much as some people do, but I like it.
[00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:15.814]  And, you know, I got a lot of friends that are team owners.
[00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:18.214]  They're like, oh, he knows team owners.
[00:15:18.214 --> 00:15:19.175]  There weren't team owners.
[00:15:19.175 --> 00:15:20.515]  There wouldn't be a Daytona 500.
[00:15:20.515 --> 00:15:23.276]  I mean, it's this, it's this idea.
[00:15:24.196 --> 00:15:30.541]  America had the biggest per capita group of rich people in it 50 years ago, and we had the most middle class in the world.
[00:15:30.541 --> 00:15:35.244]  5% of the world population, and we had half the world's wealth.
[00:15:35.244 --> 00:15:49.174]  Now that's all going out the window, because megacorporations came in, controlled the government, and had government shut down industry here, so that their industry in China, India, Mexico, and 100 plus other countries, where they have deals with the thugs that run them,
[00:15:50.882 --> 00:15:54.205]  To move our industry there, that automatically lets them consolidate control.
[00:15:54.205 --> 00:15:56.247]  I'm already digressing.
[00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:59.790]  The point is, is that they're saying what, Ron Paul came in fourth place in Michigan?
[00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.931]  Does anybody really believe that?
[00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:04.765]  And I've already gone over all this.
[00:16:04.765 --> 00:16:06.306]  Winning almost all the straw polls.
[00:16:06.306 --> 00:16:07.766]  Winning most of the scientific polls.
[00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:10.207]  And being ignored when he got first or second place.
[00:16:10.207 --> 00:16:11.827]  Or getting the least amount of time in the debates.
[00:16:11.827 --> 00:16:13.828]  That's the evidence of the fix being in.
[00:16:13.828 --> 00:16:15.948]  Then I told you day one with the evidence, Iowa.
[00:16:15.948 --> 00:16:16.788]  Clear fraud.
[00:16:16.788 --> 00:16:17.609]  Month later, came out.
[00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:19.609]  Yeah, we're setting the election aside.
[00:16:19.609 --> 00:16:20.309]  It's all a fraud.
[00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:23.150]  We're not going to say who really won.
[00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.230]  Maybe it's Santorum.
[00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.051]  But yeah, all these counties, we didn't count those from Ron Paul.
[00:16:27.051 --> 00:16:28.911]  Because the trucks got lost with the ballots.
[00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:30.852]  There are no trucks with ballots.
[00:16:30.852 --> 00:16:31.512]  It's called in.
[00:16:32.745 --> 00:16:32.965]  I don't
[00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:52.370]  Cut and dry in Maine.
[00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.331]  About 95% cut and dry in Iowa.
[00:16:55.331 --> 00:16:58.172]  About 85% total fraud proof.
[00:16:58.172 --> 00:17:01.693]  You know it is, but it's not 100% in South Carolina.
[00:17:01.693 --> 00:17:03.494]  It's about 85% in Nevada.
[00:17:03.494 --> 00:17:06.375]  And now there's evidence of fraud in these states as well.
[00:17:06.375 --> 00:17:10.217]  I stayed up late last night analyzing it and then this morning looked at it.
[00:17:10.217 --> 00:17:17.319]  But more and more it's going to shift to where Ron Paul isn't the frontrunner because people will go, well he's losing now.
[00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:18.380]  I want to bet on the winner.
[00:17:20.465 --> 00:17:38.085]  It's just like people, I mean I am years ago a football fan but because I know it's just a distraction of real issues I'm not today because I can't fill my mind up with that stuff but I get why people who were Giants fans for you know decades and with them never winning a Super Bowl got pretty excited about him going to the Super Bowl and then didn't they win?
[00:17:38.085 --> 00:17:38.506]  You know they won.
[00:17:40.802 --> 00:17:41.843]  Giants won, right guys?
[00:17:41.843 --> 00:17:42.864]  I didn't pay attention.
[00:17:42.864 --> 00:17:43.664]  But they did win, right?
[00:17:43.664 --> 00:17:47.287]  That shows how uncool I am that I don't know who won the Super Bowl.
[00:17:47.287 --> 00:17:48.008]  Yes, the Giants won.
[00:17:48.008 --> 00:17:53.953]  Now the point is, is that I get it if you've been a fan for 20, 30 years and wow, they finally win.
[00:17:53.953 --> 00:17:57.796]  But a lot of people, they just run out and went, oh, they're going to the playoffs so it looks like they're going to win.
[00:17:57.796 --> 00:17:58.897]  Oh, I'm a fan of that now.
[00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:04.679]  And so Ron Paul has been the frontrunner for six months.
[00:18:04.679 --> 00:18:14.630]  But as the fix goes in and people seem not winning in those first few primaries, that's why it's key to cheating there, then it becomes, oh, well, I'll just be for Romney.
[00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:17.456]  And you'll see that now with Santorum.
[00:18:17.456 --> 00:18:27.262]  Santorum, clearly, is, even though I don't like him, he's a globalist warmonger, he has a better voting record constitutionally than Mitt Romney.
[00:18:27.262 --> 00:18:31.644]  I mean, at least he didn't promote abortion and open borders and carbon taxes.
[00:18:31.644 --> 00:18:36.347]  He did lie about tax increases and spending increases and is a warmonger and anti-liberty.
[00:18:36.347 --> 00:18:37.808]  But, I mean, so is Romney.
[00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:48.207]  So Santorum, clearly with the Evangelicals and Christians, who mean well, he was starting to front run right there with Ron Paul.
[00:18:48.207 --> 00:18:50.789]  And so they're now going to slap him down.
[00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:52.650]  And he may end up being the VP with Romney.
[00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.693]  But that's how they organize this.
[00:18:55.693 --> 00:18:57.555]  And so when we come back from break, I'll go to your phone calls.
[00:18:57.555 --> 00:19:06.102]  We need to have the discussion here today about whether or not Ron Paul runs in a third party.
[00:19:07.284 --> 00:19:11.086]  Because even if they cheat him in that, he will inject real issues.
[00:19:11.086 --> 00:19:12.927]  He can force his way into the debate.
[00:19:12.927 --> 00:19:14.328]  It can show in national polls.
[00:19:14.328 --> 00:19:15.848]  He's getting 30, 40 percent.
[00:19:15.848 --> 00:19:19.771]  He'll get a bunch of Democrats voting for him as well that don't like Obama and are tired of the wars.
[00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:24.093]  They had another Gallup poll, as you know, yesterday, and another scientific poll with two of them.
[00:19:24.093 --> 00:19:28.515]  One was a Rasmussen where he just trounces Obama better than Romney.
[00:19:28.515 --> 00:19:33.538]  I mean, you want somebody to beat Obama and to cut spending and actually bring a lot of our troops home, it's Ron Paul.
[00:19:34.554 --> 00:19:40.475]  But, uh, they're now cheating him out in the open, and now the bandwagon effect's gonna happen, people wanting to be winners.
[00:19:40.475 --> 00:19:43.116]  You're gonna actually see Ron Paul now start to recede.
[00:19:43.116 --> 00:19:47.977]  Uh, and he should stay in the race, because he's injecting issues, but, uh, this is how they're doing.
[00:19:47.977 --> 00:19:58.400]  Alright, we'll come right back with your phone calls, and then I've got a bunch of news on the Nanny State, uh, a new trailer for a new film, and more, all coming up today.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:58.880]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.771 --> 00:20:07.917]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:20:07.917 --> 00:20:25.652]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:20:25.652 --> 00:20:29.735]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:20:30.015 --> 00:20:31.755]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:20:31.755 --> 00:20:39.837]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[00:22:29.335 --> 00:22:30.576]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:30.576 --> 00:22:35.139]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.139 --> 00:22:40.943]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:40.943 --> 00:22:44.585]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:44.585 --> 00:22:47.307]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.307 --> 00:22:52.370]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:52.671]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:54.012]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.475 --> 00:23:03.036]  IRS, the three most dreaded letters of the alphabet.
[00:23:03.036 --> 00:23:13.539]  If you owe back taxes, have unfiled tax returns, are receiving threatening letters, or have IRS agents coming to your home or place of business, you need an experienced IRS agent fighting on your side.
[00:23:13.539 --> 00:23:17.020]  Call the Tax Relief Division of the Law Offices of Craig Zimmerman at 800-652-6978.
[00:23:19.821 --> 00:23:29.607]  Spearheaded by a former IRS agent, we know how to negotiate a reduction in the tax you owe, stop wage garnishments, lift bank levies, and negotiate an affordable repayment plan.

[00:23:47.539 --> 00:23:49.020]  Actual results based on individual client circumstances.
[00:24:20.191 --> 00:24:27.059]  This is a worldwide transmission against tyranny in an attempt to wake up free humanity to the corrupt.
[00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:36.312]  Individuals that have created large combines and syndicates who are basically setting up a society of enslavement.
[00:24:36.312 --> 00:24:41.355]  We attempt and are having success in waking people up to that threat.
[00:24:41.355 --> 00:24:47.138]  Coming up, Obama issues policy directive exempting American citizens from indefinite detention.
[00:24:47.138 --> 00:24:51.101]  Because he's the new emperor, he's saying that he can exempt you.
[00:24:51.641 --> 00:24:55.926]  But he wanted that power so that he could then unexempt whenever he wanted.
[00:24:55.926 --> 00:25:02.132]  So that's actually just more of a brazen attempt to legitimize indefinite detention.
[00:25:02.132 --> 00:25:07.538]  The triumph of totalitarian fascism in the West and the East, big report out on that.
[00:25:07.538 --> 00:25:10.961]  Government says TSA scanners are safe, but they've been caught lying before.
[00:25:12.663 --> 00:25:14.044]  Regurgitating old info.
[00:25:14.044 --> 00:25:17.206]  Homeland Security fear to occupy Wall Street violence.
[00:25:17.206 --> 00:25:21.448]  New film exposes the blueprint of madness unleashed by the New World Order.
[00:25:21.448 --> 00:25:23.470]  There's a new trailer for the new documentary.
[00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.191]  I'm going to be premiering tonight on the Nightly News.
[00:25:26.705 --> 00:25:31.089]  Also, Ron Paul says, I run against all three because they're very similar.
[00:25:31.089 --> 00:25:32.770]  They all endorse preemptive war.
[00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:37.214]  That's the big difference between Ron Paul and the neocon Republicans he's running against.
[00:25:37.214 --> 00:25:43.079]  Also, 19 signs that America has become a crazy control freak nation where almost everything is illegal.
[00:25:43.079 --> 00:25:52.667]  I want to cover this after some calls and then dovetail it with the video I shot where they're now telling people they can't walk on a boardwalk because it's too dangerous.
[00:25:53.587 --> 00:25:59.632]  So you've heard of them banning running at recess at most public schools because that's too dangerous and arresting people if they do.
[00:25:59.632 --> 00:26:01.253]  I'm not joking.
[00:26:01.253 --> 00:26:05.317]  Now walking is going to be restricted by the nanny state.
[00:26:05.317 --> 00:26:08.760]  So, you know, tax debris, carbon taxes.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.623]  So that's just some of what is coming up today.
[00:26:12.623 --> 00:26:15.165]  Right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[00:26:15.165 --> 00:26:15.605]  A.B.
[00:26:15.605 --> 00:26:18.448]  in Ohio, then Scott, Scott, Keith, Carl, and others.
[00:26:18.448 --> 00:26:19.288]  A.B., you're on the air.
[00:26:19.288 --> 00:26:19.589]  Welcome.
[00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:22.146]  Hey, this is Abe.
[00:26:22.146 --> 00:26:26.987]  Yeah, I'm calling from Athens, Ohio, to talk about the Ron Paul issue.
[00:26:26.987 --> 00:26:35.229]  I'm president of Young Americans for Liberty at Ohio University here in Athens, and it's the affiliate of Campaign for Liberty.
[00:26:35.229 --> 00:26:42.071]  It's like a persistent organization for the youth, a manifesto of students for Ron Paul and the OA campaign.
[00:26:42.071 --> 00:26:47.372]  President Obama had his campaign office opening in our county.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:27:05.309]  Right in town in Athens yesterday, so me and a few other members from various other libertarian organizations on campus got together, got some fact sheets about how O equals W is what we put it at, and it just says that... Oh, I've watched that!
[00:27:05.309 --> 00:27:15.694]  And it's actually, we got it off the Young Americans for Liberty site, and it's www.yaliberty.org slash O hyphen W slash facts.
[00:27:16.078 --> 00:27:17.648]  And you can look it up right there and see it.
[00:27:17.648 --> 00:27:18.875]  It's a pretty good fact sheet.
[00:27:19.654 --> 00:27:25.756]  But also, and we were just met with some venomous Obama people.
[00:27:25.756 --> 00:27:29.958]  They were just so pissed, like, I'm sorry, but they're so aggravated with us for showing up.
[00:27:29.958 --> 00:27:32.019]  We were peaceful, respectful.
[00:27:32.019 --> 00:27:32.759]  They asked us to leave.
[00:27:32.759 --> 00:27:35.820]  We said we completely understand private property rights.
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.300]  We left.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:42.062]  We stood out on the sidewalk and handed everybody, literally walked in, and they were really upset with us.
[00:27:42.062 --> 00:27:45.624]  And they really didn't have good arguments for saying why they still supported Obama.
[00:27:45.624 --> 00:27:47.364]  They said, yeah, we agree with you.
[00:27:49.225 --> 00:27:55.411]  Obama in Missouri and other areas has openly tried to get police to threaten to arrest folks if they criticize him.
[00:27:55.411 --> 00:27:57.212]  And we've played clips of those newscasts.
[00:27:57.212 --> 00:27:58.453]  It's so bizarre.
[00:27:58.453 --> 00:28:00.035]  It's so authoritarian.
[00:28:00.035 --> 00:28:02.477]  It's hard to believe, but it's actually happening.
[00:28:02.477 --> 00:28:06.260]  And you're saying they didn't know how to respond to him on the NDAA?
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:10.143]  They didn't know how to respond to him on what, launching wars without congressional approval?
[00:28:10.143 --> 00:28:15.768]  They didn't know how to respond to Obama bailing out the big bankers again and again who financed him?
[00:28:15.768 --> 00:28:16.389]  Is that what happened?
[00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:24.818]  Well yeah, and then one of the national directors that was here, one of the three that was here tonight, last night, said that he agrees with Libya.
[00:28:24.818 --> 00:28:26.780]  And I'm like, well what about a declaration of war?
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.102]  He's just like, well we have a cause for humanity.
[00:28:29.102 --> 00:28:31.445]  And I'm like, so do you believe in a one world government?
[00:28:31.445 --> 00:28:34.087]  And he said, I mean, I don't think it would be a bad idea.
[00:28:34.087 --> 00:28:36.630]  It's something we need to hash out more, but it's just these kind of
[00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:53.898]  Well, the point is, just because they say it's loving and liberal, you know, there with one of Obama's head people opening his campaign office, just because they say, oh, it's for humanity, now we get to do it because the UN said, now we ignore our laws and Congress doesn't matter.
[00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:59.101]  I mean, it's outrageous that they engage in treason and just say because it's for humanity.
[00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:01.342]  The UN is murdering people worldwide.
[00:29:01.642 --> 00:29:03.303]  In the name of humanity, I appreciate your call.
[00:29:03.303 --> 00:29:07.626]  We're going to come back in the next long segment and take a whole parcel of calls.
[00:29:07.626 --> 00:29:10.307]  But I want to talk about this NDAA.
[00:29:10.307 --> 00:29:28.538]  It's got Utah and now several other states coming out and saying, we're going to, at the state level, block this and tell our state police and others, you will not help secretly grab citizens and put bags on their heads and have them disappear to death camps.
[00:29:29.522 --> 00:29:32.283]  I mean, NDAA has really woken people up.
[00:29:32.283 --> 00:29:35.464]  And everybody I talk to, this woke people up.
[00:29:35.464 --> 00:29:42.846]  That's why Obama's come out and said, OK, I'm going to sign a deal saying I won't implement this right now.
[00:29:42.846 --> 00:29:44.326]  But you're the one that demanded the power.
[00:29:44.326 --> 00:29:46.427]  It's like saying, I got the gun on safety.
[00:29:46.427 --> 00:29:48.848]  It's to your head, but I'm going to put it on safety, OK?
[00:29:48.848 --> 00:29:49.988]  Don't get upset.
[00:29:49.988 --> 00:29:51.388]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.388 --> 00:29:53.909]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:56.590]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.078 --> 00:30:07.723]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:30:07.723 --> 00:30:12.867]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:30:12.867 --> 00:30:21.594]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:30:21.594 --> 00:30:23.956]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:30:23.956 --> 00:30:27.619]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:30:30.086 --> 00:30:34.669]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:39.752]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[00:30:39.752 --> 00:30:41.893]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:30:41.893 --> 00:30:43.674]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:30:43.674 --> 00:30:46.556]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:30:46.556 --> 00:30:53.200]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:30:55.902 --> 00:30:59.124]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[00:31:01.502 --> 00:31:03.203]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:03.203 --> 00:31:08.505]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:31:08.505 --> 00:31:10.045]  Saving means to make money.
[00:31:10.045 --> 00:31:18.829]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:31:19.569 --> 00:31:27.096]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:31:27.096 --> 00:31:35.104]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:31:35.104 --> 00:31:40.348]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:31:40.348 --> 00:31:42.510]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:32:00.143 --> 00:32:07.366]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:32:07.366 --> 00:32:25.252]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:32:25.252 --> 00:32:29.374]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:32:29.654 --> 00:32:31.415]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:32:31.415 --> 00:32:39.581]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[00:32:45.885 --> 00:32:47.166]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:32:47.166 --> 00:32:48.046]  It's incredible.

[00:32:57.252 --> 00:32:59.094]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:33:08.826 --> 00:33:15.173]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.283 --> 00:33:40.529]  Okay, we're going back to your phone calls on the fact that Ron Paul, what came in fourth in one state and third in the other, and they've stolen the election from him in the other early primaries where he did win.
[00:33:40.529 --> 00:33:43.810]  That's even come out, but it's buried in the news.
[00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:48.272]  Even the New York Times said Ron Paul really won Maine, but it doesn't matter.
[00:33:49.571 --> 00:33:58.135]  Because as that Republican Party operative said two days before the Iowa caucus, she said, well, yeah, he's the frontrunner, but I've talked to all the party officials.
[00:33:58.135 --> 00:33:59.236]  He will not be allowed to win.
[00:33:59.236 --> 00:34:01.397]  And they said, really?
[00:34:01.397 --> 00:34:02.057]  So they've decided.
[00:34:02.057 --> 00:34:03.638]  She goes, yep.
[00:34:03.638 --> 00:34:04.759]  It's been decided.
[00:34:04.759 --> 00:34:05.219]  You know what?
[00:34:05.219 --> 00:34:07.360]  It was decided.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.560]  That's just the way it works.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.142]  And then a month after we told you it was stolen, they came out and said, yeah.
[00:34:11.142 --> 00:34:13.783]  Yeah, it was, but that's just the way it is.
[00:34:13.783 --> 00:34:15.924]  And we're not going to say what we're going to do with these delegates now.
[00:34:15.924 --> 00:34:17.505]  We're not going to say what we're going to do with these numbers.
[00:34:18.635 --> 00:34:23.421]  And so what Ron Paul has done is he's gone after the delegates because he knows they're cheating him.
[00:34:23.421 --> 00:34:25.543]  And then that's how the process actually works.
[00:34:25.543 --> 00:34:26.684]  So we're going to see what happens.
[00:34:26.684 --> 00:34:29.728]  And now there's more talk of a brokered convention.
[00:34:29.728 --> 00:34:31.089]  And it's going to be a battle.
[00:34:31.089 --> 00:34:33.071]  So Ron Paul's not out.
[00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:36.495]  But more and more as we move towards Super Tuesday,
[00:34:37.401 --> 00:34:47.366]  And as they game things, more and more they won't have to defraud Ron Paul, because a lot of weak-minded people will go, well, I like Ron Paul, but, you know, because he's in third or fourth place, why vote for him?
[00:34:47.366 --> 00:34:52.688]  I'm going to vote for Santorum, I'm going to vote for Newt Gingrich, I'm going to vote for Mitt Romney.
[00:34:52.688 --> 00:34:55.409]  Because they want to don't, you know, just throw away their vote.
[00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:56.270]  That's kind of the idea.
[00:34:57.603 --> 00:35:21.875]  But before I go back to your phone calls, tonight, after the nightly news on the video streams at PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com, we're going to have the nightly news, some news packages and information, as we do every night, 7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern, 5 o'clock Mountain, 6 o'clock Mountain, 5 o'clock Pacific PM.
[00:35:21.875 --> 00:35:25.977]  We're going to be premiering a new film that exposes the blueprint of madness,
[00:35:29.315 --> 00:35:42.683]  And we have an article up at Infowars.com right now that has the trailer for the 40-minute piece that breaks down the real threats to humanity versus the false threats that they've basically tried to program us with.
[00:35:43.527 --> 00:35:55.131]  And of course, a lot of you have already seen the intro to the 40-minute piece, little 5-minute satire piece, where I play the part of someone totally paranoid of terrorism, and then it gets into the serious issues after that.
[00:35:55.131 --> 00:36:06.334]  But if you go to Infowars.com, you can watch the new trailer, and it's posted in an article titled, New Film Exposes the Blueprint of Madness Unleashed by the New World Order.
[00:36:06.974 --> 00:36:15.773]  Coming to PrisonPlanet.tv, Alex Jones' latest documentary turns the tables on fear, government, not terrorism poses the real threat.
[00:36:16.784 --> 00:36:25.746]  And we have a 15-day free trial, of course, that we're just going to continue on into infinity, or as long as we have PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:25.746 --> 00:36:28.927]  That'll be nine years up and running in April.
[00:36:28.927 --> 00:36:43.150]  All of my films, expanded extras, video podcasts, the nightly news, video of the radio show, even when we're on the road, and that added dimension, higher quality audio, commercial-free podcast, special events, all of it posted at
[00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:47.113]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:47.113 --> 00:36:51.097]  Again, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:51.097 --> 00:37:04.771]  We've got a 15-day free trial running right now, and that's what finances us being able to make these films, to be on the road, to have the news reporters, and you are helping us build a truly alternative media system that will resist the globalist propaganda weapons.
[00:37:05.351 --> 00:37:07.532]  We are a weapon using truth.
[00:37:07.532 --> 00:37:10.134]  They are a weapon system using lies.
[00:37:10.134 --> 00:37:13.676]  And we are able to do this because you breathe life into us.
[00:37:13.676 --> 00:37:15.017]  That's a big part of the equation.
[00:37:15.017 --> 00:37:19.599]  And then obviously we also bust our hind ends to bring you this information every single day.
[00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:22.021]  So if you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member,
[00:37:22.801 --> 00:37:30.048]  We've upgraded all the systems, the quality, it doesn't weigh down now right at 7 when the nightly news goes on like it used to.
[00:37:30.048 --> 00:37:37.895]  We've really built in the redundancy and the backbone and the systems to really bring you a first rate media system and we're adding more and more all the time.
[00:37:37.895 --> 00:37:39.817]  So again, become a member today, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:41.518 --> 00:38:02.632]  And you can, this is the last day we extended it to also get 40 plus percent off when you sign up for a yearly membership at PrisonPlanet.tv and you can also get hard copies of all the films and the t-shirts and the bumper stickers and all the materials, much of it at cost, like the bumper stickers and InfoWars stencils at cost at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:38:08.556 --> 00:38:14.241]  Okay, here is the minute-and-a-half little trailer for New World Order Blueprint of Mad Men.
[00:38:14.241 --> 00:38:17.904]  That's the name of the 40-minute film that will premiere tonight.
[00:38:17.904 --> 00:38:23.649]  We premiered it in Dallas and then Orlando for those overflow crowds, capacity crowds.
[00:38:23.649 --> 00:38:26.351]  But I'm going to premiere it tonight on the Nightly News.
[00:38:26.351 --> 00:38:28.473]  And then Friday,
[00:38:29.594 --> 00:38:33.395]  We will post it for everyone on InfoWars.com.
[00:38:33.395 --> 00:38:39.997]  It is members that do get it first, and you are the folks that pay it forward so we can finance this.
[00:38:39.997 --> 00:38:48.279]  But here is the trailer for New World Order Blueprint of Mad Men.
[00:38:48.279 --> 00:38:50.800]  Any of them could be a terrorist.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.940]  Don't trust the public.
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.400]  Terrorist, terrorist, terrorist, terrorist.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.021]  You're a terrorist.
[00:38:55.021 --> 00:38:55.441]  You're a terrorist.
[00:38:55.441 --> 00:38:55.841]  You're a terrorist!
[00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:56.061]  Oh my God!
[00:38:57.779 --> 00:39:03.726]  Let's rise above their control paradigm and really see it for what it is and call it out.
[00:39:03.726 --> 00:39:11.796]  You've got a better chance of dying from a honeybee sting or falling down your shower than you do of being killed by terrorists.
[00:39:11.796 --> 00:39:15.820]  It is an irrational fear that's been engineered into people.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.721]  I've got to track him.
[00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:17.803]  I've got to do what they told me.
[00:39:18.163 --> 00:39:18.904]  Why do you pay cash?
[00:39:18.904 --> 00:39:22.529]  The biggest hoax in human history.
[00:39:22.529 --> 00:39:24.552]  The threat of terrorism.
[00:39:24.552 --> 00:39:28.056]  Absolutely thinking the terrorists are hiding under every table.
[00:39:31.374 --> 00:39:35.776]  The system itself is actually engaging in terrorism.
[00:39:35.776 --> 00:39:46.943]  They tell us all they give up our liberties because somebody might detonate a car bomb, but meanwhile they're firing hydrogen nuclear weapons into the upper atmosphere.
[00:39:46.943 --> 00:39:52.287]  Our whole world has become a giant experiment by mad scientists.
[00:39:52.967 --> 00:39:54.888]  Weaponized airborne Ebola.
[00:39:54.888 --> 00:40:09.091]  Super weaponized viruses and bacteria that kill over 90% 9 out of 10 people on your street dead by the sword, by the gun, by starvation.
[00:40:09.091 --> 00:40:11.371]  Are we smart enough to learn from history?
[00:40:11.371 --> 00:40:14.172]  Government is the number one cause of unnatural death.
[00:40:14.172 --> 00:40:18.493]  China, the USSR, Germany, and good old Pol Pot.
[00:40:18.493 --> 00:40:21.434]  It's on record for a whopping conservative total.
[00:40:22.094 --> 00:40:25.941]  Of 262 million.
[00:40:25.941 --> 00:40:28.807]  Governments winning the war against humanity.
[00:40:28.807 --> 00:40:29.889]  It's amazing.
[00:40:29.889 --> 00:40:33.415]  They admit that they're establishing a global corporate government.
[00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:37.372]  To carry out genocide covertly.
[00:40:37.372 --> 00:40:42.815]  And then you find out they're putting stuff in our vaccines, our food, our water.
[00:40:42.815 --> 00:40:50.379]  They're engineering Trojan horse genetic traits into food that are causing organ failure and sterility.
[00:40:50.379 --> 00:40:55.142]  And you realize that a bunch of crazy psychos are in control.
[00:40:55.142 --> 00:40:56.243]  Now I am become death.
[00:40:57.281 --> 00:40:59.182]  The Desire of Worlds.
[00:40:59.182 --> 00:41:05.905]  If a black death could be spread throughout the world, once in every generation.
[00:41:05.905 --> 00:41:10.307]  Survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full.
[00:41:10.307 --> 00:41:12.868]  Archer and Russell, sick control freaks.
[00:41:14.005 --> 00:41:24.587]  Who hate humanity so much that they spend their every waking minute trying to think of ways to set up a global government so they can exterminate us and our families.
[00:41:24.587 --> 00:41:25.507]  My God!
[00:41:25.507 --> 00:41:35.869]  And their plan is so horrific, they think we're too weak-minded to face what they've admittedly been caught doing and to resist them.
[00:41:35.869 --> 00:41:38.669]  Are you pathetic scum that deserves to die?
[00:41:38.669 --> 00:41:40.670]  Are you gonna prove them right?
[00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:41.250]  It's up to you.
[00:41:47.699 --> 00:41:54.882]  Alright folks, that is the trailer for the documentary New World Order Blueprint of Mad Men.
[00:41:54.882 --> 00:41:57.803]  Please get that trailer out to everyone.
[00:41:57.803 --> 00:42:09.407]  And then of course, in the next few days when we post it for the general public, please get it out to everyone because, you know, all the time now I shoot videos and we're going to your calls and I want to talk about this as an addendum to what we just played.
[00:42:10.805 --> 00:42:22.127]  I shoot videos constantly because there's new developments every day or two where weaponized Ebola, weaponized mousepox, weaponized bird flu, weaponized swine flu is being
[00:42:24.429 --> 00:42:26.271]  Souped up to be airborne.
[00:42:26.271 --> 00:42:28.794]  Souped up to be able to jump into humans.
[00:42:28.794 --> 00:42:33.139]  Souped up to kill more than 9 out of 10 people it comes in contact with.
[00:42:33.139 --> 00:42:35.722]  Horrible, painful deaths.
[00:42:35.722 --> 00:42:40.387]  And governments are publishing how to do it with the RNA sequence.
[00:42:41.977 --> 00:42:51.625]  In the case of viruses, the DNA, in the case of bacteria, and advertising it, and then saying, we're publishing this so we can develop cures for this.
[00:42:51.625 --> 00:42:54.027]  But all they're doing is making a specific strain.
[00:42:54.027 --> 00:43:00.973]  Another government or, quote, terrorist or private corporate group would just slightly tweak that yet again, and no vaccine would help.
[00:43:00.973 --> 00:43:10.861]  And then we have an elite saying in all their white papers they want to engineer a bioweapon to reduce population, and then use that crisis to get even more control over society.
[00:43:12.352 --> 00:43:14.974]  And then I get up here and say, I think this is the big threat.
[00:43:14.974 --> 00:43:17.116]  And people say, no, you're being a fear monger.
[00:43:17.116 --> 00:43:22.120]  The threat is hijackers that kill a few hundred people a year maximum.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.801]  Less than honeybees.
[00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:24.862]  Less than champagne corks.
[00:43:24.862 --> 00:43:25.823]  I mean, you know that drill.
[00:43:25.823 --> 00:43:27.104]  I go over it all the time.
[00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:27.725]  Because it's true.
[00:43:28.561 --> 00:43:37.926]  I mean, I'm told give up my whole way of life because of terrorists and be all fearful and the police question anybody, you know, shooting video of a bridge or a Capitol.
[00:43:37.926 --> 00:43:48.211]  Aaron Dykes, a couple years ago, the videos online, was shooting footage of the Texas Capitol so that he would have a cutaway shot when they went in to cover hearings inside.
[00:43:49.111 --> 00:43:52.256]  And the state police ran over, sort of yelling at him, saying, what are you doing, filming?
[00:43:52.256 --> 00:43:54.259]  He said, I'm with the media.
[00:43:54.259 --> 00:43:57.804]  And Aaron said politely, you know, I'm here with the media.
[00:43:57.804 --> 00:44:00.147]  And the cop said, give me your ID.
[00:44:00.147 --> 00:44:03.552]  And Aaron then said, no, I'm here with a tripod and a camera.
[00:44:04.918 --> 00:44:07.060]  Again, like a terrorist would just go to Google Maps.
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.781]  A terrorist would just drive by and take a photo covertly.
[00:44:09.781 --> 00:44:16.426]  A guy out there in a polo shirt and jeans, you know, videotaping the Capitol from the park grounds.
[00:44:16.426 --> 00:44:17.787]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[00:44:17.787 --> 00:44:24.832]  It's about teaching us we're bad and we've done something wrong.
[00:44:24.832 --> 00:44:27.614]  Did you pay cash for the coffee?
[00:44:27.614 --> 00:44:31.497]  This is all so broad to make it the public can't be trusted, only government can be trusted.
[00:44:32.443 --> 00:44:34.424]  And the big threat is government.
[00:44:34.424 --> 00:44:37.085]  I'm not saying they're going to release this flu.
[00:44:37.085 --> 00:44:45.670]  I'm saying they're making preparations for it and discussing how it would be helpful to reduce population.
[00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:47.791]  I just gave you a quote of Bertrand Russell talking about it.
[00:44:47.791 --> 00:44:50.492]  I mean, this is what they're into.
[00:44:50.492 --> 00:44:52.213]  And I see this as the big threat.
[00:44:52.213 --> 00:44:57.016]  They have in Level 2 facilities all over the United States and Europe, and Level 3 as well,
[00:44:57.984 --> 00:45:02.809]  Stuff that's behind glass doors with swipe cards that's shooting in underground bunkers.
[00:45:02.809 --> 00:45:10.096]  With armed guards under level 4, with explosive firebombs that blow up if the alarms go off.
[00:45:10.096 --> 00:45:16.923]  When a level 2 facility is holding level 4 type pathogens, it's just the ultimate threat.
[00:45:16.923 --> 00:45:18.124]  This makes nuclear weapons
[00:45:18.965 --> 00:45:31.421]  Pale in significance, because there's a lot less chance that Russia, the US, or China are going to have a nuclear war than some crazy eugenicist working at one of these labs is going to sneak this stuff out and spread it like 12 monkeys.
[00:45:31.421 --> 00:45:33.723]  Especially when they're all a bunch of eugenicists on average.
[00:45:34.887 --> 00:45:39.770]  I've already talked about this at nauseam, but I'm worried for my family.
[00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:42.332]  I've moved out to the country because of this.
[00:45:42.332 --> 00:45:43.953]  I think this is a real threat.
[00:45:43.953 --> 00:45:47.675]  And if we educate people and warn folks, we may be able to avert this.
[00:45:47.675 --> 00:45:51.737]  But if we don't, we don't have a hope.
[00:45:51.737 --> 00:45:56.480]  If we try to avert this Iran war, it's a good chance we can stop that if we work hard.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.621]  But the system wants it.
[00:45:59.082 --> 00:46:02.465]  So we're darned if we do, darned if we don't.
[00:46:02.465 --> 00:46:10.330]  If we do speak out and stop this, we're fearmongers that cried wolf.
[00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:15.414]  But if we don't, and just go watch the football game, then it could happen.
[00:46:15.414 --> 00:46:16.975]  And so this is what I'm concerned about.
[00:46:16.975 --> 00:46:18.056]  This is what I'm worried about.
[00:46:18.911 --> 00:46:24.875]  The globalists say they want to release bioweapons and are looking at it to reduce population in so many quotes it'll make your head spin.
[00:46:24.875 --> 00:46:30.900]  And they've been caught jacking the food and water with all sorts of stuff to soft kill us.
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:37.225]  And now they're proliferating this stuff everywhere and publishing how to produce it.
[00:46:37.225 --> 00:46:39.746]  And I'm concerned about this.
[00:46:39.746 --> 00:46:43.269]  Now, if you disagree and don't think it's a threat, fine.
[00:46:43.269 --> 00:46:46.952]  But those of us that are concerned need to have a debate about what we're about this.
[00:46:48.328 --> 00:46:48.969]  Okay.
[00:46:48.969 --> 00:46:50.471]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[00:46:50.471 --> 00:46:52.334]  Scott in California.
[00:46:52.334 --> 00:46:52.674]  Welcome.
[00:46:52.674 --> 00:46:56.480]  We're discussing, of course, Ron Paul and where you see this whole election going.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:56.900]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:46:58.206 --> 00:47:00.487]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call.
[00:47:00.487 --> 00:47:03.707]  I just want to agree with what you said earlier about the delegates.
[00:47:03.707 --> 00:47:06.328]  And that's the thing that everybody's missing in the caucus states.
[00:47:06.328 --> 00:47:08.769]  They're not bound to a specific candidate.
[00:47:08.769 --> 00:47:12.269]  And that's where Ron Paul is really cleaning up, and that's where the campaign is focused on.
[00:47:12.269 --> 00:47:26.293]  So now's not the time to be thinking about packing it in, or giving up, or thinking about third, right now's the time to put the foot on the gas pedal and go all the way to convention, because those delegates can have a lot of political power there in the convention.
[00:47:27.975 --> 00:47:28.636]  Exactly.
[00:47:28.636 --> 00:47:31.818]  Look, Ron Paul's trying to take over the Republican Party.
[00:47:31.818 --> 00:47:38.845]  Libertarian constitutionalist, Barry Goldwater type, real conservatives are trying to take over the Republican Party.
[00:47:38.845 --> 00:47:39.505]  And we can do it.
[00:47:39.505 --> 00:47:47.873]  I mean, if a bunch of global corporations took it over, and in the past, whenever there's going to be a good candidate that they don't want, they use the delegate process to block them.
[00:47:48.493 --> 00:47:56.322]  They used the delegate process to make Ronald Reagan, who spoke out against the New World Order, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, in 1979, 1980.
[00:47:56.322 --> 00:47:58.165]  This was on record.
[00:47:58.165 --> 00:48:05.693]  They forced him to take George Herbert Walker Bush on, and then he basically became the shadow president, especially after Reagan got shot.
[00:48:06.724 --> 00:48:09.726]  By the guy that had dinner the night before with the Bush family, on record.
[00:48:09.726 --> 00:48:12.869]  Look that up, Denver Post, Washington Post.
[00:48:12.869 --> 00:48:15.491]  You can't make up this type of weirdness.
[00:48:15.491 --> 00:48:18.073]  And so we need to get in there and force issues.
[00:48:18.073 --> 00:48:20.895]  Now, we're not saying we try to force Ron Paul on as the VP.
[00:48:20.895 --> 00:48:21.976]  That's already been discussed.
[00:48:21.976 --> 00:48:26.379]  But we need a big fracas there at the convention.
[00:48:26.379 --> 00:48:31.543]  And we need to continue to build steps towards taking over, not just the Republican, but the Democratic parties.
[00:48:31.543 --> 00:48:33.825]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[00:48:33.825 --> 00:48:35.386]  And that's where we're coming from.
[00:48:35.386 --> 00:48:35.807]  Anything else?
[00:48:38.933 --> 00:48:41.555]  Are you getting Dick Gregory back on the show anytime soon?
[00:48:41.555 --> 00:48:44.637]  Because I know the interview you did a couple of years ago with him was really powerful.
[00:49:09.473 --> 00:49:10.894]  Hi, Alex.
[00:49:10.894 --> 00:49:12.655]  The football analogy is a good one.
[00:49:12.655 --> 00:49:27.441]  I don't even think we're at halftime yet, but it might not be too early for a lot of us to go to YouTube and listen to the speech by Newt Rockne at halftime, the famous football speech.
[00:49:27.441 --> 00:49:38.626]  My understanding is that only 34 or 37 percent of the delegates will be apportioned out after Super Tuesday, so we're not even at the halfway point yet.
[00:49:39.125 --> 00:49:43.789]  I believe that it's a possibility that Ron Paul may lose the Republican nomination.
[00:49:43.789 --> 00:49:55.719]  I still have a great deal of faith and hope that the underdog can win, but he's winning the bigger battle, Alex, for the hearts and minds of the liberty-minded Americans that are waking up in exponential numbers
[00:49:56.224 --> 00:50:02.830]  I believe in this instance that the message is far more important than the man.
[00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:10.538]  I also believe that Dr. Paul has brought forward to the American people an idea that cannot be stopped from spreading.
[00:50:10.538 --> 00:50:16.904]  Let's think of it like a liberty virus, and that's how I see it.
[00:50:16.904 --> 00:50:19.106]  I've been to Ron Paul when he was here.
[00:50:19.788 --> 00:50:25.011]  In an unannounced stop here in Idaho at the University of Idaho.
[00:50:25.011 --> 00:50:26.632]  He packed out the ballroom.
[00:50:26.632 --> 00:50:33.135]  There were more people outside that didn't get inside, but were waiting for Dr. Paul when he left.
[00:50:33.135 --> 00:50:37.397]  And I think that's the kind of action... No, listen, listen.
[00:50:37.397 --> 00:50:39.438]  He's the real frontrunner.
[00:50:39.438 --> 00:50:41.399]  That's why he gets most of the military donations.
[00:50:41.399 --> 00:50:43.340]  That's why he was winning all his draw polls.
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.941]  They have stolen it.
[00:50:44.941 --> 00:50:46.502]  And I'm saying don't have your
[00:50:48.206 --> 00:50:51.151]  Your hope's dashed if they start stealing.
[00:50:51.151 --> 00:50:53.094]  And I agree, we are at halftime.
[00:50:53.094 --> 00:50:55.277]  And it is a battle of ideas.
[00:50:55.277 --> 00:50:57.601]  And we are winning by being on the field.
[00:50:57.601 --> 00:50:59.364]  And we're also exposing the fraud.
[00:50:59.364 --> 00:51:00.886]  We've got to engage these guys.
[00:51:00.886 --> 00:51:03.210]  I've seen the Longevity products work for many others.
[00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:09.572]  And so I bought a bunch of them, started using them, had a little bit of results, but I wasn't following the regimen every day.
[00:51:09.572 --> 00:51:13.794]  But Aaron Dykes in my office did, and lost more than 60 pounds.
[00:51:13.794 --> 00:51:17.515]  When I saw those results, I said, I better follow my own advice.
[00:51:17.515 --> 00:51:20.977]  I started taking the longevity products, and it's been incredible.
[00:51:20.977 --> 00:51:23.618]  37 pounds in two months.
[00:51:23.618 --> 00:51:26.859]  Our bodies are amazing, and God gave us an incredible gift.
[00:51:27.099 --> 00:51:35.966]  But if our body doesn't have the tools it needs, all of the vitamins, all of the minerals, and the other key essential trace elements, we're not going to be healthy.
[00:51:35.966 --> 00:51:37.166]  Folks, this is Hidden Hype.

[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:16.762]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:54:16.762 --> 00:54:20.205]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:54:20.205 --> 00:54:22.546]  I don't want any shackles on my children either.
[00:54:22.546 --> 00:54:25.568]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:54:25.568 --> 00:54:28.230]  Yeah, I got the blues about Big Brother.
[00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:31.672]  I got the blues about tyranny.
[00:54:31.672 --> 00:54:35.695]  Yeah, I stay down with Big Brother.
[00:54:35.695 --> 00:54:36.576]  Crank it up for a minute.
[00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:40.871]  It's Jimmy Vaughn fighting the New World Order.
[00:54:40.871 --> 00:54:41.331]  That's right.
[00:55:08.724 --> 00:55:14.327]  In the land of the free and home of the brave, you don't want shackles on you, Jimmy?
[00:55:14.327 --> 00:55:14.807]  Shame on Big Sis.
[00:55:34.332 --> 00:55:34.732]  That's right.
[00:55:34.732 --> 00:55:38.074]  How about we trace you, government, shipping the guns into Mexico?
[00:55:38.074 --> 00:55:52.440]  You got that, you crooks, you bank robbing, new world order, counterfeiting trash?
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.380]  Get out of our lives.
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.461]  Stop telling us how you're doing it for our own good.
[00:55:56.613 --> 00:55:58.674]  We've got Foster Gamble and Kimberly Gamble.
[00:55:58.674 --> 00:56:02.517]  We've got the new film out, Thrive, that we're carrying at InfoWars.com, joining us at 8 after.
[00:56:02.517 --> 00:56:05.639]  And they'll be with us for the rest of the hour after that.
[00:56:05.639 --> 00:56:09.281]  But in the third hour, it'll be open phones and news again.
[00:56:09.281 --> 00:56:12.744]  But let's hurry through your calls right now in this segment and the next.
[00:56:12.744 --> 00:56:14.185]  Talking about Ron Paul.
[00:56:14.185 --> 00:56:15.846]  Look, I'm just being realistic.
[00:56:15.846 --> 00:56:16.887]  He wins by running.
[00:56:16.887 --> 00:56:18.608]  He has been the frontrunner.
[00:56:18.608 --> 00:56:26.093]  He may still be the real frontrunner, but I'm starting to see some numbers that show it may be going to Santorum and others with some states because people
[00:56:27.234 --> 00:56:29.055]  Okay, well he lost in these early states.
[00:56:29.055 --> 00:56:31.057]  Maybe I'll just go with who I think is a winner.
[00:56:31.057 --> 00:56:34.319]  There's going to be that self-fulfilling prophecy idea.
[00:56:34.319 --> 00:56:35.861]  But there is fraud.
[00:56:35.861 --> 00:56:36.982]  He has been the frontrunner.
[00:56:36.982 --> 00:56:39.304]  If you look at all the metrics.
[00:56:39.304 --> 00:56:44.088]  And I just don't want people getting bummed out if Ron Paul doesn't get the nomination.
[00:56:44.088 --> 00:56:45.409]  And it could still happen.
[00:56:45.409 --> 00:56:47.891]  But we're winning by injecting real issues.
[00:56:47.891 --> 00:56:49.632]  So keep supporting.
[00:56:49.632 --> 00:56:52.855]  Let's go ahead and talk to Keith in Indiana.
[00:56:52.855 --> 00:56:53.456]  You're on the air.
[00:56:53.456 --> 00:56:53.736]  Welcome.
[00:56:54.505 --> 00:56:55.725]  Thank you very much.
[00:56:55.725 --> 00:57:07.949]  I just wanted to say I'm going to be a delegate for Indiana at the Republican convention and I've only been involved in this now for a few weeks and around here you have to head the file a few weeks ago.
[00:57:07.949 --> 00:57:19.453]  And apparently the argument was about from everybody within the party itself, separately from the primaries, is that they're telling everybody that Ron Paul is actually not a pure Republican.
[00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:28.219]  There's a lot of people even in my area who really like him who are Democrats and a lot of the Democrats want to switch over in states and vote for him.
[00:57:28.219 --> 00:57:31.501]  And the Republican Party is preaching this idea that he actually
[00:57:32.228 --> 00:57:37.671]  It's like infecting the party with a disease from outside the party.
[00:57:37.671 --> 00:57:39.432]  Oh no, let's be clear, let's be clear.
[00:57:39.432 --> 00:57:50.819]  Ron Paul and Alex Jones and all of us and you, Keith from Indiana, we're infecting the Democrats and Republicans with America, with the Bill of Rights, with common sense.
[00:57:50.819 --> 00:57:52.640]  No, they're absolutely right.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.482]  They're these foreign bankers posing as patriots.
[00:57:55.822 --> 00:58:00.104]  Who've taken over the Republican and Democratic parties where there's no difference except in rhetoric.
[00:58:00.104 --> 00:58:02.785]  Ron Paul's bringing back what made America great.
[00:58:02.785 --> 00:58:05.006]  Read what he says versus the founding fathers.
[00:58:05.006 --> 00:58:06.506]  It's identical.
[00:58:06.506 --> 00:58:08.007]  And he's not really a Republican.
[00:58:08.007 --> 00:58:09.728]  He's an American.
[00:58:09.728 --> 00:58:13.669]  And the Republican Party was closer to his American beliefs.
[00:58:13.669 --> 00:58:16.831]  That's why he first ran for Congress that way.
[00:58:17.631 --> 00:58:21.615]  You know, 25 years ago, when he first got in, and then got kicked out, and then came back.
[00:58:21.615 --> 00:58:23.156]  First, he ran as a libertarian.
[00:58:23.156 --> 00:58:24.457]  He ran as a libertarian for president.
[00:58:24.457 --> 00:58:26.359]  He's never made bones about that.
[00:58:26.359 --> 00:58:27.840]  They are the usurpers.
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:29.221]  They are the pretenders.
[00:58:29.221 --> 00:58:30.523]  They are the counterfeits.
[00:58:30.523 --> 00:58:34.906]  Mad that the real deal... Stay there, I'm gonna come right back to you, and then finish up with all the other callers.
[00:58:34.906 --> 00:58:37.189]  But, uh, you know, we're taking over.
[00:58:37.189 --> 00:58:39.651]  We're taking America back from the hijackers.
[00:58:43.413 --> 00:58:51.420]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:56.404]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[00:59:44.531 --> 00:59:45.792]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:45.792 --> 00:59:47.073]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.492 --> 01:00:10.334]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.334 --> 01:00:11.915]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.915 --> 01:00:13.456]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.456 --> 01:00:17.658]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.658 --> 01:00:21.700]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.892 --> 01:00:29.234]  We are back now into hour number two.
[01:00:29.234 --> 01:00:36.058]  Foster Gamble, one of the heirs of the Procter & Gamble fortune, has come out against the New World Order.
[01:00:36.058 --> 01:00:37.079]  He's got a new film out.
[01:00:37.079 --> 01:00:38.820]  We're going to be talking about it.
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:41.221]  His wife, as well, is involved in the film.
[01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:42.782]  Kimberly Gamble.
[01:00:42.782 --> 01:00:44.303]  And we are promoting the film.
[01:00:44.303 --> 01:00:45.604]  It's at Infowars.com.
[01:00:45.604 --> 01:00:46.185]  We're selling it.
[01:00:46.185 --> 01:00:46.985]  It's called Thrive.
[01:00:46.985 --> 01:00:48.826]  I think it's excellent to wake up the left.
[01:00:49.787 --> 01:00:55.230]  The ideas of liberty and individual freedom are infiltrating the controlled left and the controlled right.
[01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:56.911]  And that's what Ron Paul's doing.
[01:00:56.911 --> 01:00:58.112]  That's what he's always said.
[01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:07.818]  We are in a revolution to restore the republic against the globalist revolutionaries of corporate fascist collectivism.
[01:01:07.818 --> 01:01:09.819]  It's very simple to understand.
[01:01:09.819 --> 01:01:12.401]  Insiders who want to have an inside game versus
[01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:15.371]  Transparency.
[01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:16.832]  Open, free societies.
[01:01:16.832 --> 01:01:19.975]  And yes, that's what Republican Party and Karl Rove say on Fox News.
[01:01:19.975 --> 01:01:20.916]  Ron Paul's dangerous.
[01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:22.597]  He's got Democrats crossing over.
[01:01:22.597 --> 01:01:27.801]  Yeah, that have woken up to the fact that Obama lied to them about ending wars and corporate bailouts.
[01:01:27.801 --> 01:01:30.464]  And that Mitt Romney's bought and paid for by the same interests.
[01:01:30.464 --> 01:01:32.545]  People are getting the rigged game.
[01:01:32.545 --> 01:01:34.067]  And they are crossing over to support Paul.
[01:01:34.844 --> 01:01:37.346]  And so the Republican leadership says, well, we're not going to allow that.
[01:01:37.346 --> 01:01:38.407]  We're going to steal it.
[01:01:38.407 --> 01:01:40.510]  And so they have been caught stealing it in multiple states.
[01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:42.231]  They are stealing it.
[01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:43.052]  He is the leader.
[01:01:43.052 --> 01:01:44.113]  He is the frontrunner.
[01:01:44.113 --> 01:01:49.318]  He is getting all the money from the small donations of the military and winning the straw polls and the scientific polls.
[01:01:49.318 --> 01:01:51.300]  And he can beat Obama and all the big polls.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:51.780]  He's the guy.
[01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:53.261]  They know that.
[01:01:53.261 --> 01:01:58.583]  So this is what the Republican leadership is telling you in Indiana, is exactly what they're saying on Fox News.
[01:01:58.583 --> 01:02:05.805]  Go with the real Republicans that give us the corporate bailouts, the open borders, the gun control, the New World Order.
[01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:08.745]  I mean, is that what they're basically saying, Keith?
[01:02:08.745 --> 01:02:12.126]  I've talked to people who have been through this before, and that's what they're telling me.
[01:02:12.126 --> 01:02:14.607]  And the thing about it is, two quick points.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:25.529]  The way these conventions are set up, the Republicans, I have been informed by numerous people, have the right to kind of change the rules right up to the day of the convention.
[01:02:25.529 --> 01:02:37.060]  So if you are in a state, theoretically, that may be going to Ron Paul, they have the capacity at the very top to re-rig the system at the actual conventions before you ever get a chance to do anything.
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:40.784]  Yeah, they changed the rules in 2010 to really be able to do that, yeah.
[01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:46.258]  Yeah, and like back in 2008 in Nevada when they were going to have a caucus and they just cancelled it.
[01:02:46.258 --> 01:02:47.781]  So I mean these are the things they do.
[01:02:47.781 --> 01:02:51.709]  The other point is you are absolutely right about the attitude of the public.
[01:02:52.492 --> 01:03:00.176]  I was in the 2008 campaign for Ron Paul, and I used to attend meetings for months, and all of a sudden, nobody started coming.
[01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:06.519]  And the guy who was running them said, the word's out, Ron Paul's not going to win, and nobody will do anything anymore.
[01:03:06.519 --> 01:03:10.701]  And I think the people who run the Republican Party really know that.
[01:03:10.701 --> 01:03:14.363]  It doesn't take months for people to abandon a candidate.
[01:03:14.363 --> 01:03:19.606]  If they suddenly decide he's not going to go anywhere, I was shocked at how quickly people just
[01:03:20.359 --> 01:03:21.100]  Leave.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:22.481]  I mean, they don't do anything anymore.
[01:03:50.379 --> 01:03:54.941]  That, oh, well, he lost these early primaries where they thought he would win, because he was the frontrunner.
[01:03:54.941 --> 01:04:00.143]  Okay, and then you'll see that bandwagon over to Romney, over to Santorum, and that's now happening.
[01:04:00.143 --> 01:04:02.544]  But it's not as bad as it was four years ago.
[01:04:02.544 --> 01:04:04.365]  But some of the momentum is going to be lost.
[01:04:04.365 --> 01:04:07.527]  So just be ready for it.
[01:04:07.527 --> 01:04:12.309]  Because if you don't tell folks to be ready for it, just have this Kool-Aid idea of, no, he's still going to win.
[01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:14.570]  Then when he doesn't, everybody's crestfallen.
[01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:17.031]  This is a long-term, long view of history.
[01:04:17.691 --> 01:04:19.452]  Okay, this is not one football game.
[01:04:19.452 --> 01:04:21.072]  This is not one season.
[01:04:21.072 --> 01:04:23.913]  This is a whole program, to use a sports analogy.
[01:04:23.913 --> 01:04:27.414]  And our program four years ago only won two games.
[01:04:27.414 --> 01:04:29.995]  This time we've won, you know, twelve games.
[01:04:29.995 --> 01:04:32.556]  Next time we're going to win the playoffs and the Super Bowl.
[01:04:32.556 --> 01:04:33.577]  Because we're engaging.
[01:04:33.577 --> 01:04:34.497]  We're showing the fraud.
[01:04:34.497 --> 01:04:36.678]  We're showing the Republican Party rigging things.
[01:04:36.678 --> 01:04:38.458]  We're showing how they're sick.
[01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:42.100]  We're showing Democrats how Obama's on the same team.
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.940]  We're showing it's all a rigged game.
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.221]  And it's in that process
[01:04:46.326 --> 01:04:52.836]  That we're going to really wake people up, that it's the collectivism that allows the insiders to control all of us.
[01:04:52.836 --> 01:04:57.703]  You end the collectivism, bring in a spirit of liberty, they can't control you anymore.
[01:04:57.703 --> 01:04:59.366]  It's all about making you dependent.
[01:04:59.366 --> 01:04:59.946]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.694 --> 01:05:05.256]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.256 --> 01:05:06.157]  Number one.
[01:05:06.157 --> 01:05:09.579]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.579 --> 01:05:10.459]  Number two.
[01:05:10.459 --> 01:05:15.342]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.342 --> 01:05:16.082]  It's true.
[01:05:16.082 --> 01:05:20.625]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.945 --> 01:05:21.766]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.766 --> 01:05:25.369]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.369 --> 01:05:29.273]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.273 --> 01:05:30.073]  Number 4.
[01:05:30.073 --> 01:05:32.836]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.836 --> 01:05:36.179]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:41.443]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.443 --> 01:05:46.506]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.506 --> 01:05:50.669]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.669 --> 01:05:52.470]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:57.074]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:02.401 --> 01:06:06.362]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:15.225]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:15.225 --> 01:06:19.846]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:19.846 --> 01:06:30.669]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:40.811]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:40.811 --> 01:06:46.253]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:46.253 --> 01:06:53.734]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:53.734 --> 01:06:56.495]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:07:00.845 --> 01:07:01.906]  I had tried everything.
[01:07:01.906 --> 01:07:07.411]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:07:07.411 --> 01:07:12.236]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:07:12.236 --> 01:07:18.602]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:07:19.082 --> 01:07:30.307]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:07:30.307 --> 01:07:34.769]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:07:34.769 --> 01:07:41.031]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:07:41.031 --> 01:07:42.192]  Now, that's results.
[01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:55.103]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[01:07:55.103 --> 01:07:57.665]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[01:07:57.665 --> 01:07:59.287]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:04.072]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.072 --> 01:08:07.417]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:25.113]  Alright, in the third hour we'll continue open phones on the presidential campaign and the fact that there's no difference between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.
[01:08:25.113 --> 01:08:30.194]  And the whole system is rigged against Ron Paul, which shows he's the man.
[01:08:30.194 --> 01:08:31.855]  And we'll continue with your calls on that subject.
[01:08:31.855 --> 01:08:35.256]  And also the nanny state, which is really the heart of the globalist takeover.
[01:08:35.256 --> 01:08:45.219]  I've now discovered they're trying to restrict walking on boardwalks because any bumps are seen as dangerous and they may, well they're now moving to ban people walking on boardwalks, I've now discovered while I've been out in
[01:08:45.339 --> 01:08:56.501]  Florida, you know, they've banned running in public schools across the United States, Europe, England, and other nanny state control systems because running, you might fall down and hurt yourself.
[01:08:58.163 --> 01:09:03.367]  It's just a total enslavement, bubble boy, kind of iRobot scenario.
[01:09:03.367 --> 01:09:15.155]  Isaac Asimov wrote about, you know, a future system where the robots are there to serve humans, but they have this directive to not do harm, and so they basically enslave people because they can't allow humans to do anything that might hurt them.
[01:09:15.815 --> 01:09:20.176]  This is really at the heart of this conscious globalist dehumanization that's taking place.
[01:09:20.176 --> 01:09:24.158]  We'll be covering that coming up in the third hour today.
[01:09:24.158 --> 01:09:31.660]  For the balance of this hour, we're going to be joined by Foster Gamble and his wife, Kimberly Gamble, both filmmakers who've made the film thrive.
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:33.740]  Very well produced.
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:36.181]  Months ago, listeners would call up and say, what do you think of this?
[01:09:36.181 --> 01:09:37.301]  And I said, well, I haven't seen it.
[01:09:37.301 --> 01:09:41.923]  So I got a copy, got so busy, didn't watch it for a few weeks, and finally did watch it.
[01:09:42.873 --> 01:09:48.280]  And I think that they're coming from a place of really trying to get people outside the box and to wake up.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:53.646]  And you could call it a little New Age-y, you know, it questions the big lie of, well, are there space aliens?
[01:09:53.646 --> 01:09:58.011]  And they don't say one way or the other, they just say, can we trust a government that's been caught lying about all this?
[01:09:58.011 --> 01:10:00.875]  And I'd say they spend maybe 5% of the two-hour film on that.
[01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:09.596]  Then they get into the plans to reduce population, the cancer increasing, really hardcore things.
[01:10:09.596 --> 01:10:13.798]  They get into individualism, how that's going to empower people.
[01:10:13.798 --> 01:10:18.580]  And that's seen by the liberals that see it, because it's kind of tailored for classical liberals out there.
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.160]  That's what's really shocking to them.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.402]  For us that are constitutionalists, it's like, well, that's not shocking.
[01:10:24.062 --> 01:10:34.704]  So the film really, I would say, is tailored for kind of mainline liberals that are well-meaning people and don't understand, from kind of an Alex Jones or Ron Paul perspective, why liberty is so important.
[01:10:34.704 --> 01:10:39.926]  And it gets into alternative energies that have been suppressed and, you know, the fact that that is going on.
[01:10:39.926 --> 01:10:42.786]  I mean, it's really a revolutionary film.
[01:10:42.786 --> 01:10:45.187]  Now, obviously, you know, some of it
[01:10:46.954 --> 01:10:51.996]  I don't 100% endorse or believe in, but I think it's really good to get people thinking.
[01:10:51.996 --> 01:11:01.418]  And it's a good way to break the ice and to get conservatives to kind of understand a kind of libertarian liberal perspective and also wake up mainline liberals.
[01:11:01.418 --> 01:11:04.699]  So that's why I made the decision to carry the film Thrive.
[01:11:04.699 --> 01:11:06.940]  It's now available at Infowars.com.
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:09.381]  It's also available on their site.
[01:11:09.381 --> 01:11:13.362]  You know, films like Zeitgeist, the first one came out.
[01:11:14.022 --> 01:11:15.383]  And of course, I wasn't involved in it.
[01:11:15.383 --> 01:11:16.604]  I wasn't asked to be involved.
[01:11:16.604 --> 01:11:17.885]  I used a lot of my material.
[01:11:17.885 --> 01:11:23.108]  People got mad at me because it's really an anti-Christian, anti-religion film at first.
[01:11:23.108 --> 01:11:25.530]  Then it gets into the Federal Reserve, the New World Order.
[01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:27.772]  So I agree with two-thirds of the First Sight guys.
[01:11:27.772 --> 01:11:31.835]  One-third of it is attacking people that have faith or a spiritual consciousness.
[01:11:31.835 --> 01:11:32.875]  Thrive doesn't do that.
[01:11:32.875 --> 01:11:36.278]  So I like it a lot more because I've had spiritual experiences.
[01:11:36.278 --> 01:11:38.259]  I have a relationship with my Creator.
[01:11:38.259 --> 01:11:41.241]  I don't judge others that are in other religions and have had their experiences.
[01:11:41.241 --> 01:11:43.443]  I know that something's going on out there.
[01:11:44.173 --> 01:11:46.095]  And so it gets a little bit into that, too.
[01:11:46.095 --> 01:11:48.637]  So it's really about expanding your awareness.
[01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:53.161]  And I think overall it's a wholesome film, and I think the filmmakers are in the right direction.
[01:11:53.161 --> 01:11:56.964]  You know, I kind of half-cocked when people were calling and talking about it, said, Foster Gamble!
[01:11:56.964 --> 01:11:57.405]  The Gambles!
[01:11:57.405 --> 01:11:58.606]  That's New World Order!
[01:11:58.606 --> 01:12:00.588]  Well, I bet it is, you know, this or that.
[01:12:00.588 --> 01:12:03.510]  And they kind of sent nice emails saying, well, Alex, we think more of you.
[01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:04.972]  You should actually look at this.
[01:12:04.972 --> 01:12:07.174]  So they didn't really lash out at me when I was...
[01:12:07.754 --> 01:12:08.735]  I'm not really half cocked.
[01:12:08.735 --> 01:12:10.275]  I said, oh, it might be positive.
[01:12:10.275 --> 01:12:10.956]  I got to see it.
[01:12:10.956 --> 01:12:16.579]  But, you know, little I'll find out because I'm always a jaundice eye on anything coming from the left.
[01:12:16.579 --> 01:12:20.080]  Now, they come out with other films down the road and start getting globalist on us.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.681]  Then I'll say, oh, well, it's like Zeitgeist.
[01:12:21.681 --> 01:12:22.602]  The first one's OK.
[01:12:22.602 --> 01:12:26.564]  And then it gets, you know, we're all going to live in plastic cities and be reeducated.
[01:12:27.624 --> 01:12:29.006]  But enough of me.
[01:12:29.006 --> 01:12:32.408]  They're with us for just the next 45 minutes to the end of the hour.
[01:12:32.408 --> 01:12:35.291]  And I appreciate the gambles coming on.
[01:12:35.291 --> 01:12:38.734]  Foster, Kimberly, tell us about your awakening.
[01:12:38.734 --> 01:12:46.521]  And then I want to get into the free energy, you know, how you woke up to 9-11, inside job, false flags, just the full spectrum you're covering.
[01:12:46.521 --> 01:12:52.306]  Because this film is really waking up kind of mainline liberals out there that we're unable to reach.
[01:12:52.306 --> 01:12:54.287]  And I think it's valuable for that reason.
[01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:54.888]  Good to have you with us.
[01:12:55.482 --> 01:12:55.863]  Thank you.
[01:12:55.863 --> 01:12:59.606]  It's great to be on here with you, Alex.
[01:12:59.606 --> 01:13:13.961]  Speaking for myself, it was really when I left college and started to go out into the world and realized that we were invading Cambodia for no good reason that I could understand and we were destroying a lot of the
[01:13:14.448 --> 01:13:14.868]  We're good to go.
[01:13:37.102 --> 01:13:40.185]  And then along the lines of my research, I started getting more into following the money.
[01:13:53.067 --> 01:13:53.547]  I don't
[01:14:12.082 --> 01:14:25.330]  You know, 12, 15 years, and the reliability of your predictions, not only your information, but your predictions, just kept you as one of my primary news feeds every day.
[01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:40.539]  So with people like you and David Icke and Jim Mars and others who just kept tying the different pieces together in a way that made so much more sense to me than what I was getting from the corporate media, that I just really went down that rabbit hole, and thank goodness I did.
[01:14:42.179 --> 01:14:45.201]  Well, you've made a great film.
[01:14:45.201 --> 01:14:46.782]  Go ahead, Kimberly.
[01:14:46.782 --> 01:14:54.346]  I just wanted to say that for me, it was really important to do a lot of my own research because the story made more sense that you were telling.
[01:14:54.346 --> 01:15:02.070]  But one of the things that I did was we hired an independent fact checker to corroborate everything as we were putting it together for the movie.
[01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:06.353]  And it was one of the ways we could find out whose information really was most accurate.
[01:15:06.533 --> 01:15:14.257]  And I have to say, the information that we got from you and the films that you were putting out always came back corroborated.
[01:15:14.257 --> 01:15:17.419]  So you became a really important source for me too.
[01:15:17.419 --> 01:15:31.667]  And I consider us real allies in this because I know my intention making Thrive was to create a tool so that the people who are already aware of what's going on would have something to be able to share with people who have been more resistant.
[01:15:31.667 --> 01:15:32.168]  So thanks.
[01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:33.950]  Well, thank you.
[01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:44.179]  I think it's very effective because it covers a wide spectrum of what people are questioning, and it just basically discusses alternative paths to what we're going down.
[01:15:44.179 --> 01:15:50.725]  Because we know the path we're going down is pure madness, even though the controllers think they have a method.
[01:15:50.725 --> 01:15:54.028]  It's really a blind spot, and I think the elite are going to destroy themselves.
[01:15:54.608 --> 01:15:58.572]  I mean, undoubtedly the direction we're going is destructive.
[01:15:58.572 --> 01:16:01.015]  Let's start breaking down the film Thrive itself.
[01:16:01.015 --> 01:16:12.268]  I mean, do you agree with my perspective that this is something I see that's really going to be good for waking up people on the traditional left that kind of hear a gruff, you know, wild libertarian and kind of get turned off?
[01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:15.791]  Well, we've certainly been in that conversation a lot.
[01:16:15.791 --> 01:16:30.619]  We didn't specifically make it for that audience, but we did have a strong intention to bridge together lots of different fractions, from the left and from the right, from science and consciousness, from liberty and justice, from energy to UFOs.
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:49.834]  And I'm delighted to say that in the interviews we're getting a chance to do, it's actually a remarkably similar conversation that we're having, no matter whether it's in the UFO, economics, conspiracy realm, because what we're finding is the common denominators are what's really going on in the world,
[01:16:49.974 --> 01:16:52.497]  Because everybody is wanting to know that now.
[01:16:52.497 --> 01:16:54.179]  Or just about everybody.
[01:16:54.179 --> 01:16:58.424]  And secondly, what are the principles by which we can get out of this?
[01:16:58.424 --> 01:17:01.048]  Rather than the politics, what are the principles?
[01:17:01.048 --> 01:17:05.854]  And that's where the liberty conversation is just emerging like a geyser right now.
[01:17:07.349 --> 01:17:07.889]  Well it is.
[01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:14.533]  It's spreading like the white blood cells countering the virus or the infection.
[01:17:14.533 --> 01:17:21.416]  And undoubtedly, I mean everyone knows this internally, it's a basic truth, there is a major shift happening.
[01:17:21.416 --> 01:17:23.558]  The old order is panicking.
[01:17:23.558 --> 01:17:26.079]  It's not really a new world order, it's an old order.
[01:17:26.079 --> 01:17:31.922]  And all of this tyranny we're seeing coming to the surface is an attempt to suppress the awakening we're seeing.
[01:17:31.922 --> 01:17:33.443]  I don't really get people saying,
[01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:35.584]  Oh, you're full of it anymore like I used to.
[01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:37.665]  They just say, okay, what are you going to do?
[01:17:37.665 --> 01:17:40.947]  So I think it's more about giving solutions and that's what you're doing.
[01:17:40.947 --> 01:17:42.348]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:17:42.348 --> 01:17:44.189]  That's exactly what we're doing.
[01:17:44.189 --> 01:17:55.476]  You know, people like you and David Icke have done such a masterful job of, you know, being the Paul Revere's for people and letting people know that there's something really heavy coming down if we don't do something about it.
[01:17:55.476 --> 01:17:57.337]  So we've been able to stand on the shoulders of
[01:17:57.817 --> 01:18:10.004]  Of that kind of work, and then take the time in our documentary to stitch together so many dots into the two hours, but really then to guide people to the solution section.
[01:18:10.004 --> 01:18:18.509]  And we thought we were going to have to spend six months to a year just arguing about whether the Federal Reserve was federal or whether or not there's some kind of intentional conspiracy.
[01:18:18.509 --> 01:18:19.830]  But it's not that way at all.
[01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:22.212]  People are going, OK, all right, we get it.
[01:18:22.212 --> 01:18:24.753]  Even if we didn't before, now we're getting it.
[01:18:24.753 --> 01:18:26.234]  And what can we do about it?
[01:18:26.374 --> 01:18:41.430]  I'm happy to say that there are already, just in three months, there are hundreds of self-creating, Thrive-inspired solutions groups now meeting in cities, states and countries all over the world.
[01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:49.633]  Taking this film and using some of the solutions suggestions that we suggest and dividing by sectors.
[01:18:49.633 --> 01:18:55.735]  Some people take on the governance, others are justice, others are media, others are education or environment.
[01:18:55.735 --> 01:19:04.157]  And then using an organizational model that we're offering to try to coordinate their actions not only locally but nationally and also globally.
[01:19:05.623 --> 01:19:14.010]  Well, that's what really worries the system is people getting past the left-right paradigm and all these labels and really realizing, hey, we're all in this together.
[01:19:14.010 --> 01:19:20.855]  We better take control of the system away from these crazies and start reversing things or we don't have any future.
[01:19:20.855 --> 01:19:22.656]  And I think it's because the danger is so great.
[01:19:22.656 --> 01:19:28.121]  Everybody instinctively or in their gut, their spirit, whatever you want to call it, knows we're two minutes to midnight.
[01:19:28.981 --> 01:19:35.823]  And I think we're going to see a lot of people in the power structure itself are already seeing that, realize that it's, you know, this system is going in the wrong direction.
[01:19:35.823 --> 01:19:36.744]  We've got to change it.
[01:19:36.744 --> 01:19:46.587]  I want to get your perspective on that and talk about some subsections of the film, Alternative Energy and more, with the makers of the film Thrive, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:46.587 --> 01:19:48.248]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:19:48.248 --> 01:19:48.668]  Stay with us.
[01:20:03.706 --> 01:20:08.188]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[01:20:08.188 --> 01:20:11.529]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:20:11.529 --> 01:20:15.911]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:16.912]  Here's why.
[01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:23.054]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:20:23.054 --> 01:20:27.516]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:20:27.896 --> 01:20:34.280]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:38.143]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:20:38.143 --> 01:20:44.087]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:20:44.087 --> 01:20:49.691]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:20:49.691 --> 01:20:52.713]  Go to MySolarBackup.com for more information.
[01:20:52.713 --> 01:20:54.914]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:07.104]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[01:21:07.104 --> 01:21:12.428]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.
[01:21:12.428 --> 01:21:16.172]  Go to MySafeDoor.com right now and watch the amazing video.
[01:21:16.172 --> 01:21:21.016]  At MySafeDoor.com, you'll learn how to turn your home into a fortress with the Door Sentinel.
[01:21:21.016 --> 01:21:22.257]  16 kicks later,
[01:21:23.925 --> 01:21:26.452]  And the door sentinel is still holding strong.
[01:21:26.452 --> 01:21:27.836]  MySafeDoor.com.
[01:21:27.836 --> 01:21:29.400]  That's MySafeDoor.com.
[01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:31.390]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:35.953]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:21:35.953 --> 01:21:41.777]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:21:41.777 --> 01:21:45.419]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:45.419 --> 01:21:48.241]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.241 --> 01:21:53.184]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:21:53.184 --> 01:21:53.485]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.485 --> 01:21:54.846]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.189 --> 01:22:01.790]  Hey there, you've reached Claire.
[01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:03.111]  Leave me a message.
[01:22:03.111 --> 01:22:04.392]  Claire, it's Anne.
[01:22:04.392 --> 01:22:07.334]  Hey, you know that hormone balancing product we talked about before?
[01:22:07.334 --> 01:22:08.375]  The all-natural one.
[01:22:08.375 --> 01:22:08.835]  Ambrin?
[01:22:08.835 --> 01:22:10.256]  Well, I gotta tell you this.
[01:22:10.256 --> 01:22:17.641]  Not only did Ambrin stop my hot flashes, but since I started the Ambrin program, I have lost so much weight.
[01:22:17.641 --> 01:22:19.462]  Seriously, even my belly fat.
[01:22:19.462 --> 01:22:19.962]  It's gone.
[01:22:19.962 --> 01:22:22.424]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[01:22:22.424 --> 01:22:23.084]  I feel great.
[01:22:23.084 --> 01:22:23.745]  Give me a call.
[01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:27.567]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[01:22:27.567 --> 01:22:31.369]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.
[01:22:31.369 --> 01:22:35.772]  Ambarin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall off.
[01:22:35.772 --> 01:22:38.113]  Yes, even that stubborn belly fat.
[01:22:38.113 --> 01:22:41.174]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging too.
[01:22:41.174 --> 01:22:45.637]  So with your hormones in balance, you can feel great and finally lose the weight.
[01:22:45.637 --> 01:22:51.040]  Be one of the first 50 callers right now, and they'll send you a complimentary risk-free trial with a 30-day supply.
[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:51.600]  Free!

[01:22:51.801 --> 01:22:52.081]  That's 1-800-839-2959.
[01:22:52.081 --> 01:22:52.141]  1-800-839-2959.
[01:23:01.493 --> 01:23:04.875]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:23:04.875 --> 01:23:13.058]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:23:13.058 --> 01:23:18.361]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[01:23:18.361 --> 01:23:21.362]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.
[01:23:21.362 --> 01:23:25.264]  Visit us at crossbreedholsters.com.
[01:23:25.264 --> 01:23:28.465]  Don't forget, crossbreedholsters.com.
[01:23:30.436 --> 01:23:34.178]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[01:23:34.178 --> 01:23:36.220]  That something is Atwood Rope.
[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.241]  The highest quality rope made in the USA.
[01:23:38.241 --> 01:23:43.825]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborists, shipyards, tow line, or boating.
[01:23:43.825 --> 01:23:47.367]  Quality rope at affordable prices you and your customers can depend on.
[01:23:47.367 --> 01:23:50.809]  Find a dealer or shop online at atwoodrope.net.
[01:23:50.809 --> 01:23:55.752]  Enter promo code RADIO to receive 100 feet of 550 paracord free with purchase.
[01:23:55.752 --> 01:23:56.573]  Atwood Rope.
[01:23:56.573 --> 01:23:58.394]  Working to keep the world tied together.
[01:24:13.703 --> 01:24:15.529]  I'll be frank, I don't fear the Reaper.
[01:24:15.529 --> 01:24:17.374]  I'm not in a hurry to die.
[01:24:17.374 --> 01:24:18.076]  But I do fear...
[01:24:19.815 --> 01:24:27.197]  Democide, government killing populations, humanity's genetics being damaged by all the toxic waste and manipulation and GMO.
[01:24:27.197 --> 01:24:28.417]  Our DNA is changing.
[01:24:28.417 --> 01:24:30.298]  We are mutating for the worse.
[01:24:30.298 --> 01:24:31.618]  The heavy metals, all of it.
[01:24:31.618 --> 01:24:36.599]  I do fear for future generations because I know I'm part of a larger species.
[01:24:36.599 --> 01:24:38.099]  And I do care about humanity.
[01:24:38.099 --> 01:24:40.500]  I don't hate humanity.
[01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:44.481]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up to really get into the film, but Foster Gamble
[01:24:45.041 --> 01:24:57.693]  And Kimberly Gamble have put together the film Thrive and you can go to their website that we have linked on Infowars.com and see their solutions area and a lot more and they can give that to you here on air as well.
[01:24:57.693 --> 01:25:01.276]  But what section, because you cover so much in the film, should we get into first?
[01:25:01.276 --> 01:25:03.959]  How about the alternative energy being suppressed?
[01:25:03.959 --> 01:25:06.241]  I mean, there's really strong evidence there.
[01:25:06.241 --> 01:25:07.342]  I mean, that is going on.
[01:25:08.527 --> 01:25:30.703]  That's probably the area that we're getting the strongest response to from all over the world, because we're really inviting people to indicate their intention to join what we call a critical mass action, where people say, I'll show up for a demonstration if there's enough people, or I'll contribute money, or I'll invest in a company to get these technologies out.
[01:25:30.703 --> 01:25:31.904]  And we're getting many
[01:25:32.284 --> 01:25:33.064]  We're good to go.
[01:25:58.857 --> 01:26:00.901]  Right after he died and expanding.
[01:26:00.901 --> 01:26:09.655]  We know about General Motors and Ford patents on gasoline and diesel engines that were getting 70, 80 miles a gallon 30, 40 years ago.
[01:26:09.655 --> 01:26:12.259]  There's all sorts of basic stuff we know they've suppressed.
[01:26:12.259 --> 01:26:12.739]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:33.643]  Yeah and also one of the things is that we dubbed Thrive in nine different languages besides English and people have actually taken it upon themselves and added subtitles for you know Portuguese and Greek and so it's out there in the world and one of the things we're doing is hearing back from people all over the world about what they know about free energy technology too.
[01:26:33.643 --> 01:26:39.447]  So in addition to having this cross-pollination between the different issues and topics that we bring up
[01:26:47.055 --> 01:26:51.159]  Well, free energy would bring down this current system and would empower humanity.
[01:26:51.159 --> 01:26:53.422]  I mean, that's a no brainer.
[01:26:53.422 --> 01:26:55.084]  Get into some of the evidence they're suppressing.
[01:26:57.079 --> 01:27:07.188]  Well, I've been blessed along with Kimberly to be able to have visited some of these laboratories and some of the inventors, some of whom are in the film and some aren't.
[01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:10.752]  And all but one of them have been shut down.
[01:27:10.752 --> 01:27:18.199]  So I've seen these people, I've talked to them, I've seen the look in their eyes, you know, their spouses are terrified, their lives have been threatened.
[01:27:18.559 --> 01:27:28.925]  You know, literally, the doors get banged down, the FBI SWAT team comes in and starts taking all the equipment and telling them if they even talk about it, you know, they'll take them out of the game.
[01:27:28.925 --> 01:27:32.867]  So, it's a very intense and very real situation.
[01:27:32.867 --> 01:27:46.975]  And that's why there's so much safety in numbers now in bringing this up, and it's one of the reasons that we made the commitment to doing that in the film, is to just bring it out in the open, have that conversation, so that, like you're seeing with so many other things, as people get engaged, it just gets harder and harder to stop.
[01:27:48.689 --> 01:27:54.437]  I mean if we did have free energy or even the stuff they admit exists, the better forms of energy, there goes war right there.
[01:27:54.437 --> 01:27:56.920]  There goes the biggest resource problem we've got.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:01.386]  There is the empowerment so we can educate and lift people up.
[01:28:01.386 --> 01:28:02.848]  There is all the answers right there.
[01:28:03.789 --> 01:28:12.092]  Imagine the prosperity in this country if you had minimal or no energy bills and we had an honest money system.
[01:28:12.092 --> 01:28:26.518]  So many of the rest of these big government problems would go away if people were simply allowed to access energy that inexpensively and not to be robbed by the Federal Reserve System.
[01:28:26.518 --> 01:28:26.959]  Wow.
[01:28:26.959 --> 01:28:29.360]  And it's all covered in Thrive.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.920]  I know you guys have several big sites.
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.681]  What's the best one for people to visit to learn more?
[01:28:33.724 --> 01:28:38.088]  ThriveMovement.com and then you can go from there.
[01:28:38.088 --> 01:28:46.394]  You can get right to all the solutions and what can I do and sign up for Critical Mass Actions or rent the movie or buy the movie or explore anything.
[01:28:46.394 --> 01:28:49.957]  You can spend months on our site, ThriveMovement.com.
[01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:56.202]  And if you rent the movie and you get value out of it, you can gift it forward to your friends right over the internet for a 20% discount.
[01:28:58.956 --> 01:29:14.088]  The other thing that people are doing is either using the DVD or just doing a download and creating a screening either in their home for a few people or in some local auditorium for their screenings for up to a thousand people going on all over the world.
[01:29:14.088 --> 01:29:22.855]  And this is a way that a lot of people are getting access very inexpensively and then having really constructive solutions conversations that follow the film.
[01:29:22.855 --> 01:29:25.658]  And there have been over 3,000 of those already around the world.
[01:29:26.531 --> 01:29:28.913]  And we're actually having a chance.
[01:29:28.913 --> 01:29:43.602]  We're going to be going to Australia in June for a Solutions Tour there, because really, you know, looking at the stages that are needed to get us from here to a thriving world is the way we set up our whole solutions strategy, and that is what's engaged us.
[01:29:43.602 --> 01:29:44.762]  Well, you're having a big effect.
[01:29:44.762 --> 01:29:45.763]  Kimberly, stay there.
[01:29:45.763 --> 01:29:47.764]  We've got to come right back after this break.
[01:29:47.764 --> 01:29:49.085]  We'll get into banking and more.
[01:29:49.085 --> 01:29:50.286]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.286 --> 01:29:51.687]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.687 --> 01:29:53.188]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.213 --> 01:30:01.016]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.016 --> 01:30:02.317]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.317 --> 01:30:07.919]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:30:07.919 --> 01:30:12.942]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:30:12.942 --> 01:30:17.964]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:30:18.504 --> 01:30:23.726]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:30:23.726 --> 01:30:30.828]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:30:30.828 --> 01:30:31.948]  And here's the best part.
[01:30:31.948 --> 01:30:38.310]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:30:38.630 --> 01:30:41.834]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:30:41.834 --> 01:30:44.056]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:30:45.317 --> 01:30:48.641]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:30:48.641 --> 01:30:50.403]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:01.249 --> 01:31:06.234]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:12.833]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:12.833 --> 01:32:14.334]  There's a place down in Tennessee

[01:32:38.478 --> 01:32:39.699]  Others don't.

[01:33:24.597 --> 01:33:25.758]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:33:25.758 --> 01:33:26.799]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:26.799 --> 01:33:28.120]  Central, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:28.401]  Eastern.
[01:33:28.401 --> 01:33:31.103]  We're live back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:31.103 --> 01:33:31.463]  Central.
[01:33:31.463 --> 01:33:36.848]  Don't forget InfoWars Nightly News, where I will premiere New World Order Blueprint of Mad Men.
[01:33:36.848 --> 01:33:48.860]  Now look, it's a 40-minute documentary, and it basically deals with the facts that we're told give up all our lives because of terrorism, and it's essentially a non-existent, blown-up fear like the boogeyman.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:56.067]  I mean, to be killed by a terrorist, even if he lived in Egypt or somewhere, or Israel, is one in a million plus.
[01:33:56.067 --> 01:33:59.030]  We've got all the government's numbers.
[01:33:59.030 --> 01:34:04.536]  Compared to all the other things happening, it's several hundred places down in probability.
[01:34:04.536 --> 01:34:05.978]  But they're saying, give up all your rights.
[01:34:05.978 --> 01:34:09.201]  It's a clear system to bring in authoritarian control.
[01:34:09.201 --> 01:34:10.263]  It's a clear excuse.
[01:34:11.872 --> 01:34:16.078]  That said, everybody's getting really excited because I haven't made a film in over a year and a half.
[01:34:16.078 --> 01:34:17.920]  This is not one of my big official films.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:19.182]  It's going to be free.
[01:34:19.182 --> 01:34:21.385]  Everybody's saying, where do I get the DVD?
[01:34:21.385 --> 01:34:22.507]  It's going to be free.
[01:34:22.507 --> 01:34:25.190]  President Blanidad TV members will see it premiere tonight first.
[01:34:26.095 --> 01:34:31.037]  It'll be up this evening, then after it goes on the news, post it as an MP4 for everybody.
[01:34:31.037 --> 01:34:33.798]  And then the next few days, I'll put it on one of our YouTube channels.
[01:34:33.798 --> 01:34:37.739]  We have our own system because we're always getting censored on other people's websites.
[01:34:37.739 --> 01:34:39.000]  So we have to have our own system.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.022]  Members that pay it forward, pay us 15 cents a day or whatever, you fund us making things like this.
[01:34:44.022 --> 01:34:45.402]  But this is important.
[01:34:45.402 --> 01:34:47.103]  New World Order, Blueprint of Mad Men.
[01:34:47.103 --> 01:34:54.726]  You've got to know why we don't want to go with their system so that people are ready to try to have a debate and a discussion about a new system.
[01:34:55.819 --> 01:35:04.609]  Now, talking about our guests that are on with us, you can get the Thrive film at Infowars.com and get a free citizen rulebook while you're at it, or you can go to their site and get it.
[01:35:04.609 --> 01:35:09.394]  Regardless, get it and show it to people in your area, just like you can do with my films.
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:11.441]  So they understand what's happening.
[01:35:11.441 --> 01:35:12.903]  But people are starting to wake up.
[01:35:12.903 --> 01:35:14.464]  Now we've got to give them solutions.
[01:35:14.464 --> 01:35:17.246]  And this film covers problems, but also solutions.
[01:35:17.246 --> 01:35:18.728]  That's why I like it.
[01:35:18.728 --> 01:35:21.971]  Now, there's terms in the film, like sustainability in our community.
[01:35:21.971 --> 01:35:25.894]  People go, well, sustainability, that's a UN 21 term.
[01:35:25.894 --> 01:35:27.396]  The globalists take every term.
[01:35:29.045 --> 01:35:37.794]  And then they use real problems and then offer their bad solution that gives them more power, like pay Al Gore to breathe, and that'll fix the problem.
[01:35:37.794 --> 01:35:39.856]  No, I'm not worried about carbon dioxide.
[01:35:39.856 --> 01:35:50.085]  I'm worried about GMO literally spreading into the entire biosphere, ruining and wrecking all animal and human and mammal DNA it comes in contact with in the big public studies.
[01:35:50.686 --> 01:35:52.187]  This is already happening.
[01:35:52.187 --> 01:35:55.769]  The heavy metals they add into the water under the name of fluoride.
[01:35:55.769 --> 01:35:57.210]  It's wrecking our DNA.
[01:35:57.210 --> 01:36:03.213]  Deformities, all sorts of chromosomal diseases that were incredibly rare are becoming commonplace.
[01:36:03.213 --> 01:36:05.815]  Neurological disorders, you know the numbers.
[01:36:05.815 --> 01:36:09.617]  The film covers this and does it in a very good way.
[01:36:09.617 --> 01:36:14.040]  Again, it's just for the general public.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:15.501]  It's well done.
[01:36:16.496 --> 01:36:23.878]  But I wanted to bring this up because when I first had listeners saying, you got to see this, it's got a lot of good solutions and sounds really good, but then it talks about sustainability.
[01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:30.499]  Well, in Austin, people started getting chickens in their own yards, which was legal and lawful.
[01:36:30.499 --> 01:36:33.920]  Now that Austin is coming with a law to try to restrict it.
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:36.261]  This is a big UN run city where I live.
[01:36:37.389 --> 01:36:38.850]  Not there today, I'm in Baton Rouge.
[01:36:38.850 --> 01:36:40.512]  All over the country they're trying to stop.
[01:36:40.512 --> 01:36:42.914]  Backyard gardens, front yard gardens.
[01:36:42.914 --> 01:36:45.156]  The enviros aren't enviros.
[01:36:45.156 --> 01:36:47.378]  They're trying to seize control.
[01:36:47.378 --> 01:36:48.458]  Now I know I'm ranting here.
[01:36:48.458 --> 01:36:51.061]  The point is, is that there's real sustainability.
[01:36:51.061 --> 01:36:55.144]  I've moved out in the country, got a water well, a garden, and a wall around my house.
[01:36:55.144 --> 01:36:56.705]  That's sustainability for my family.
[01:36:57.486 --> 01:37:00.070]  That's being self-sufficient.
[01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:03.235]  When they say sustainability, they mean cutting off your resources.
[01:37:03.235 --> 01:37:05.398]  So, do you guys want to explain that?
[01:37:05.398 --> 01:37:08.683]  Because you use some of the terms that the globalists use.
[01:37:08.683 --> 01:37:09.865]  Of course, they use all the terms.
[01:37:15.150 --> 01:37:26.733]  And I want to be very clear with people and I think being sustainable is critical, but what we're recommending is the farthest thing from the Agenda 21 meaning of that.
[01:37:26.733 --> 01:37:33.335]  It's really about voluntary association and aligning our existence with natural principles
[01:37:33.695 --> 01:37:36.942]  So we can not only survive, but thrive.
[01:37:36.942 --> 01:37:44.337]  But it's not about turning those systems over to some centralized authority to tell us how to live and what we can eat and what we can grow and all that.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.222]  Because that's never worked, and that's... Exactly.
[01:37:48.222 --> 01:37:52.286]  The globalists create this unsustainable system that's wasteful and everything else.
[01:37:52.286 --> 01:37:53.427]  I mean, it's screwed up.
[01:37:53.427 --> 01:37:56.530]  And then they offer their solution, which is more of the same.
[01:37:56.530 --> 01:37:57.170]  Exactly.
[01:37:57.170 --> 01:37:59.772]  That's... Talk about Agenda 21.
[01:37:59.772 --> 01:38:03.175]  And of course, your wife there worked on the film so much.
[01:38:03.175 --> 01:38:07.079]  And talk about the whole Federal Reserve angle that you're introducing to people.
[01:38:07.079 --> 01:38:12.484]  I mean, it really has a nice mix of all the key issues of how these controllers are in control.
[01:38:13.608 --> 01:38:22.133]  One of the things that we did was investigate and follow the money in all 12 what we call the major sectors of human endeavor.
[01:38:22.133 --> 01:38:28.697]  And it was a shock to me to find exactly the same families in charge of every single sector.
[01:38:28.697 --> 01:38:33.400]  And we came to the realization that it wasn't because they're any smarter or any better than anyone else.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.701]  It's because they're the ones who run the money scam.
[01:38:36.161 --> 01:38:37.522]  And it's just like playing Monopoly.
[01:38:37.522 --> 01:38:40.703]  If you can make up money, it's not going to take you that long.
[01:38:40.703 --> 01:38:43.725]  Even if it takes a hundred years, you're going to buy everybody else out.
[01:38:43.725 --> 01:38:46.106]  And we're on the verge of that right now.
[01:38:46.106 --> 01:38:51.529]  So we look to expose that system because with the internet now and shows like yours,
[01:38:51.949 --> 01:38:59.775]  When we started our work, you were lucky to find anything on the internet about the Federal Reserve being not federal.
[01:38:59.775 --> 01:39:06.280]  Last time I checked, there were over 31 million references for that phrase alone.
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:11.303]  So obviously, people are waking up and finding out, and that's why that system is crumbling.
[01:39:11.303 --> 01:39:20.170]  But as that system crumbles, it's critical that we have new systems that we are building based on integrity, based on liberty,
[01:39:20.530 --> 01:39:23.632]  That can grow a new and free society.
[01:39:23.632 --> 01:39:38.882]  So we give in our solution section and in the film some overarching strategies like getting out of the IMF and the World Bank and shutting down the Federal Reserve and going to a non-GMO organic farming
[01:39:39.342 --> 01:39:39.522]  I think?
[01:39:57.859 --> 01:40:04.684]  And that you can easily join coalitions to shut down the Federal Reserve, to keep the Internet open.
[01:40:04.684 --> 01:40:06.425]  You can easily bank locally.
[01:40:06.425 --> 01:40:11.028]  If you're in one of these big tapeworm banks, you can shift your money in a couple of hours.
[01:40:11.028 --> 01:40:16.552]  You can take part in critical mass actions related to free energy or GMOs.
[01:40:17.032 --> 01:40:17.553]  I don't think so.
[01:40:37.659 --> 01:40:39.800]  Yeah, and I think one of the things... Yeah, start that first step.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:40.681]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:40:40.681 --> 01:40:50.787]  Yeah, and by exposing the whole pyramid structure, you know, one of the things you realize looking at that is that it relies on the people as its base, this whole system.
[01:40:50.787 --> 01:41:01.373]  So as people wake up, that is the critical piece to change the whole thing, because without our participation, this whole pyramid control system can't actually succeed.
[01:41:01.373 --> 01:41:05.055]  And so that's what I'm seeing that I'm so excited about, because the awareness
[01:41:05.815 --> 01:41:16.921]  The tools for awareness that you and we and others are creating, that's the thing that creates the fundamental shift because it can't keep on continuing without people blindly supporting it.
[01:41:19.625 --> 01:41:23.108]  We have one graphic on our website and in the film.
[01:41:23.108 --> 01:41:28.893]  We spent a lot of effort trying to boil the whole kind of power structure down to one picture.
[01:41:28.893 --> 01:41:33.696]  And, you know, we're at the bottom going about our daily lives and then the government is above us.
[01:41:33.696 --> 01:41:36.999]  Because obviously they have taken over a lot of control over our lives.
[01:41:36.999 --> 01:41:45.146]  But what most people don't realize, I'm much more educated in this audience, but in general, people don't realize that there are at least six levels above that.
[01:41:45.646 --> 01:42:01.486]  Where the politicians are beholden to the corporatocracy, the corporatocracy to the big banks, the big banks to the central banks, and all the way up to the Bank of International Settlements, and then into the Rothschild Rockefeller, the whole secret society command and control structure.
[01:42:01.826 --> 01:42:12.636]  That decides our fates behind closed doors, and then comes out and runs their mandates down through the media, the military, the government, and so forth, down through that pyramid structure.
[01:42:12.636 --> 01:42:24.288]  But if we, through non-violent, non-participation, walk away from the bottom of that structure, literally refuse to go into these wars of foreign aggression,
[01:42:24.788 --> 01:42:34.773]  And refuse to put your money in those banks, and refuse to participate in the usual government structure that you've exposed so well, Alex, where they're both working for the same agenda.
[01:42:34.773 --> 01:42:39.636]  That pyramid not only will, but is already crumbling.
[01:42:39.636 --> 01:42:51.802]  So it's important that we're building really free, honest, and sustainable options to that in every domain that are not under the control of the state.
[01:42:52.506 --> 01:43:00.409]  And you can see that under FollowTheMoney at ThriveMovement.com.
[01:43:00.409 --> 01:43:04.070]  In fact, guys, we can probably pull that up, that pyramid.
[01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:05.310]  What section of the site is that?
[01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:09.171]  We'll put it up for folks watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:43:09.171 --> 01:43:13.533]  If you go to the problem and then go to FollowTheMoney,
[01:43:14.771 --> 01:43:15.733]  I don't think so.
[01:43:30.195 --> 01:43:40.408]  Now, expanding on this, because obviously callers and people after you're on with us, and I want to have you back up in the future to just take phone calls, because I think the film is very well done and it'll get people thinking.
[01:43:40.408 --> 01:43:46.395]  Like you said, if you don't agree with all ten of those solutions, I agree with most of them, then don't follow them.
[01:43:46.395 --> 01:43:48.258]  It's just start thinking about solutions.
[01:43:48.638 --> 01:43:55.463]  I started thinking about getting engaged because the power of we the people doing little things moves mountains.
[01:43:55.463 --> 01:43:56.944]  Many hands make light work.
[01:43:56.944 --> 01:44:04.189]  And Hollywood tries to put this image of an Arnold Schwarzenegger archetype, a Hercules defeating the monsters.
[01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:05.730]  That's not how things are really done.
[01:44:05.730 --> 01:44:10.673]  It's little people doing little things together really changes things.
[01:44:10.673 --> 01:44:15.076]  And so the system wants you to think you've got to do it all in one fell swoop or there's a silver bullet.
[01:44:15.456 --> 01:44:26.198]  Simply seeking after answers, taking action, supporting locals, supporting your community, being involved, and not feeling inadequate.
[01:44:26.198 --> 01:44:30.579]  Madison Avenue tries to make everybody feel pathetic, realizing you have power and value.
[01:44:30.579 --> 01:44:34.360]  It's that decision, that spiritual, psychological decision.
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:41.441]  Out of that, waking up just means being aware, trying to learn more, and believing you can make the world a better place.
[01:44:41.661 --> 01:44:49.528]  Out of that decision changes everything, but obviously when you guys come on, people are going to say, you know, the gambles, that's, you know, Procter and Gamble, who is this guy?
[01:44:49.528 --> 01:44:51.109]  You know, they're New World Order.
[01:44:51.109 --> 01:45:06.482]  My whole point is we have to expect that, you know, A, we're going to see people from prominent families, people from the establishment, people from Hollywood, people from all over the system as things get crazier and crazier that are going to start trying to fix things.
[01:45:07.443 --> 01:45:11.407]  I mean, how did anything in your background help prime you to be awake to this?
[01:45:11.407 --> 01:45:19.777]  Have you ever been approached by other elites and, you know, told to basically, you know, shut up, because I know I have been, or offered things?
[01:45:19.777 --> 01:45:25.283]  I mean, have you ever had any experiences in that realm?
[01:45:26.411 --> 01:45:32.355]  Well, I've been a pretty out-of-the-box thinker, like you, for a long time.
[01:45:32.355 --> 01:45:40.761]  I was very successful in elite school, so I was recruited for various corporations and organizations.
[01:45:40.761 --> 01:45:44.143]  I was wined and dined at the Bohemian Club one day for lunch.
[01:45:44.143 --> 01:45:51.067]  But I realized, even though I didn't understand what was really going on behind the scenes and those things, it never felt good to me.
[01:45:51.067 --> 01:45:53.449]  I didn't like the tenor of the conversations.
[01:45:53.449 --> 01:45:56.151]  They seemed very arrogant and controlling.
[01:45:56.591 --> 01:46:04.096]  So I just went off on my other path because I didn't think I was going to find any of the answers or the fulfillment that I was looking for there.
[01:46:04.096 --> 01:46:09.941]  I'm happy to say that I have not taken any flak from other people in that
[01:46:12.442 --> 01:46:13.784]  I don't think so.
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:37.323]  I'm thankful for the guy who started it, that I ended up inheriting just enough money that I could basically spend my life doing this kind of research and make this kind of film.
[01:46:37.323 --> 01:46:39.303]  And that just about tapped me out.
[01:46:39.303 --> 01:46:50.047]  But it's not anywhere in the same realm as a banking family that is continuing to multiply that fractional reserve, you know, fiat scam.
[01:46:50.047 --> 01:46:51.827]  Sure, they have the money machines.
[01:46:51.827 --> 01:46:56.909]  They own thousands of corporations and carry an agenda to dominate other people's lives.
[01:46:57.964 --> 01:46:58.585]  Well, exactly.
[01:46:58.585 --> 01:47:02.568]  People always say, hey, the elite didn't want to mess up the economy.
[01:47:02.568 --> 01:47:03.449]  They're making money.
[01:47:03.449 --> 01:47:04.890]  Well, literally, they're making money.
[01:47:04.890 --> 01:47:08.874]  They print it, they issue it, and they've been able to take over the whole planet through fraud.
[01:47:08.874 --> 01:47:17.982]  And of course, I brought that up because COINTELPRO will just use that, or people psychologically will use that as an example to not look at it, because anybody who even has a famous name
[01:47:18.562 --> 01:47:20.563]  I mean, obviously, I know about big families.
[01:47:20.563 --> 01:47:23.284]  Even if there was a ton of money, it runs out, it goes away.
[01:47:23.284 --> 01:47:24.124]  I've got that.
[01:47:24.124 --> 01:47:27.585]  And people are judged by their deeds, not by their name.
[01:47:27.585 --> 01:47:34.787]  I mean, you could go back in my lineage, if people knew it, and find all sorts of interesting characters, which I won't even say on air.
[01:47:34.787 --> 01:47:36.128]  We'll have a head day with it.
[01:47:36.128 --> 01:47:37.388]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:47:37.628 --> 01:47:38.869]  Yeah, it's true for anybody.
[01:47:38.869 --> 01:47:41.330]  You know, you don't want to be defined by your relatives.
[01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:43.091]  And I think Thrive speaks for itself.
[01:47:43.091 --> 01:47:51.555]  It's what we spend our time and our money and our resources and our reputations and everything that we've put into this and risked in order to be helpful.
[01:47:51.555 --> 01:47:56.617]  So I think that proof is in the pudding of how are we spending our time and what are we doing with our lives, not who we are.
[01:47:58.158 --> 01:48:07.867]  Sure, well I can listen to you and I can see the film and tell you guys are, you know, awake, enlightened folks that realize we've got a serious problem and so I commend what you're doing.
[01:48:07.867 --> 01:48:16.394]  That's why we're carrying the film at InfoWars.com and hope folks get it and get it out to people because I think it is going to get people thinking and just moving in the right direction instead of sitting in the ditch.
[01:48:16.394 --> 01:48:19.117]  We've only got a few minutes left and then one more short segment.
[01:48:19.117 --> 01:48:20.198]  You guys have got the floor.
[01:48:20.198 --> 01:48:22.299]  What are some other facets of the film?
[01:48:22.299 --> 01:48:24.121]  I mean, you get into the cancer rates going
[01:48:24.121 --> 01:48:30.609]  Yeah, that's what I'd love to focus on for a moment because there is such power, moral power and integrity.
[01:48:42.925 --> 01:48:52.055]  To the Liberty Movement, but a lot of people in the Liberty Movement are so idealistic that they're not willing to talk about transition strategies.
[01:48:52.055 --> 01:48:57.321]  They just, you know, wish it would be perfect right now, and it's not, and it's not going to be tomorrow or a year from now.
[01:48:57.321 --> 01:49:03.528]  So I haven't found a whole lot of constructive solutions, transitions, and so we spent years
[01:49:04.228 --> 01:49:26.962]  Working with some of the best thinkers that we could find to try to create kind of a business plan for transitioning that includes I think what some of the left has spent a lot of time and compassion on to do well to take care of people in transition, to take care of the soil that needs to be replenished and people who have been so damaged by a corrupt system that they don't
[01:49:27.242 --> 01:49:29.623]  Have homes and they don't have health care and so forth.
[01:49:29.623 --> 01:49:53.295]  For a little while, it would be great to help take care of those most wounded, but not by creating new taxes, which is just a new violation, but by instead reducing the military budget, getting rid of the Federal Reserve, and that would literally free up, you know, one to two trillion dollars a year that could fund a few years of transition while the prosperity is returning to our civilization.
[01:49:53.775 --> 01:50:09.277]  And in particularly in what we call the second stage or the second track, which is really where Ron Paul is focusing a lot on stopping these wars of aggression, having an honest money system and shrinking the government down to the protection of individual liberties rather than creating
[01:50:09.657 --> 01:50:12.718]  All sorts of legislation to take over people's lives.
[01:50:12.718 --> 01:50:23.722]  And I believe myself that we're actually not going to make it as a species unless we learn how to convert to a true society of voluntary association.
[01:50:23.722 --> 01:50:36.507]  Because as soon as that mandatory tax is allowed, then a few people have what I call the seed of tyranny, which has always grown until it's unstoppable without some kind of revolution.
[01:50:36.667 --> 01:50:37.168]  That's right.
[01:50:37.168 --> 01:50:39.270]  Government only creates tyranny.
[01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:41.533]  It's always the engine of our problems.
[01:50:41.533 --> 01:50:42.374]  The founders knew that.
[01:50:42.374 --> 01:50:43.976]  We've got to make it as small as possible.
[01:50:43.976 --> 01:50:45.378]  Let's talk about that straight ahead.
[01:50:45.378 --> 01:50:46.640]  Amazing interview.
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:48.102]  The films thrive.
[01:50:48.102 --> 01:50:49.624]  Available at Infowars.com.

[01:50:50.885 --> 01:50:51.566]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:51.566 --> 01:50:51.987]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.815 --> 01:51:06.738]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[01:51:06.738 --> 01:51:21.168]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand, eFoods Direct Family Packs are the answer.

[01:52:04.008 --> 01:52:09.191]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:52:09.191 --> 01:52:11.052]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[01:52:11.052 --> 01:52:14.574]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[01:52:14.574 --> 01:52:22.058]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[01:52:22.058 --> 01:52:26.560]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:32.303]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[01:52:32.623 --> 01:52:34.423]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[01:52:34.423 --> 01:52:40.545]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[01:52:55.767 --> 01:52:58.708]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:02.972]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.
[01:53:02.972 --> 01:53:05.033]  Storable foods are also in high demand.

[01:53:10.077 --> 01:53:13.780]  But increasingly, our customers have been asking for storable foods.

[01:54:20.462 --> 01:54:30.064]  We're going to have open phones and examine the nanny state, which is a logical conclusion of becoming dependent, coming up in the third hour for those holding.
[01:54:30.064 --> 01:54:31.845]  That's just five minutes away.
[01:54:31.845 --> 01:54:41.347]  Okay, continuing here with the Thrive Movement, you're not just putting out a film, you've done research, you've gone out and had fact checkers, you know, research.
[01:54:42.587 --> 01:54:44.868]  Well, how this world is really governed.
[01:54:44.868 --> 01:54:56.215]  Talk some about that research that you put in the film that really, in a very professional and well-researched manner, shows the pyramid structure, shows the elite families, shows how they're engineering this.
[01:54:56.215 --> 01:55:02.018]  I mean, it powerfully, again, proves this open conspiracy against free societies.
[01:55:02.018 --> 01:55:03.139]  Break that down for folks.
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:22.331]  One of the most interesting things to me, Alex, was that we, through basing our work on really reputable work like yours, and then having everything fact-checked, we were confident that the powers that shouldn't be would not go after the information.
[01:55:22.331 --> 01:55:27.214]  Because first of all, they can't argue with it, and secondly, they don't want people talking about it, so that they would try to
[01:55:27.614 --> 01:55:28.214]  Don't you think?
[01:55:46.963 --> 01:55:47.483]  Yes, we are.
[01:56:05.114 --> 01:56:10.698]  So, the fact-checking that we've done, the fact-checking that you've done, I think has done its job.
[01:56:10.698 --> 01:56:21.204]  It's created a firm foundation to the claims that we're making, so that by, in masses now, people are going, okay, this is the story that makes sense, now what can we do about it?
[01:56:21.204 --> 01:56:28.989]  And one of the ways that we've been so thrilled in the response that we're getting, is especially we're getting a strong response from women and from young people.
[01:56:29.449 --> 01:56:47.377]  And I think especially Kimberly's presence in the film and just the tone that she set as director, directing me as narrator, kept reminding me to give the viewer their own emotional space to experience very challenging and difficult information.
[01:56:47.737 --> 01:56:52.423]  And at the same time to wrap the whole thing in concrete and viable solutions.
[01:56:52.423 --> 01:56:59.711]  And in my experience of a lifetime of activism, once the women and especially the moms take on a cause, it's going to happen.
[01:57:01.027 --> 01:57:18.406]  And you know, one of the things in terms of what's available on the site, we have a resource tree so that all of the materials that we use, books, videos, people, organizations, as well as the resources that others who were valuable to us use, we've made available by sector.
[01:57:18.406 --> 01:57:20.628]  So you can actually go down to the bottom of the
[01:57:21.269 --> 01:57:23.730]  Homepage there's something on the bottom of most pages.
[01:57:23.730 --> 01:57:43.542]  There's a Something called a resource tree and when you click on it You can explore it by sector and then you know and part of that is we we want to encourage critical thinking It's not to believe us It's like you said in the beginning to go ahead and start thinking about these things and doing the research yourself and then we even have something called reality check and
[01:57:44.042 --> 01:57:52.290]  So that you can sort of see what's your baseline understanding of this agenda in order to then move on to engage in more leveraged solutions.
[01:57:52.290 --> 01:57:59.537]  Because part of what got me into this initially was to see that my experience of people didn't support what was happening in the world.
[01:57:59.537 --> 01:58:04.062]  I actually find that people are good and innovative and caring.
[01:58:04.062 --> 01:58:05.863]  And so what was it that was happening?
[01:58:06.985 --> 01:58:19.419]  In addition to the resource tree, our solution strategy really has a personal component for you to find out what is your own purpose and passion, because we need each person to do what they're most inclined to do.
[01:58:19.419 --> 01:58:23.284]  There's a place for everybody in this, and not any one person can do it all.
[01:58:26.306 --> 01:58:26.806]  Sure.
[01:58:26.806 --> 01:58:35.290]  Kimberly Foster, I know you guys have got to go, but if you can hold one minute, you can do five more minutes and finish up the solution area that you're discussing.
[01:58:35.290 --> 01:58:36.751]  Okay, we'll be back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:36.751 --> 01:58:41.613]  Then after that segment, coming up at 8 after, I'll take your phone calls, folks.
[01:58:41.613 --> 01:58:45.095]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.095 --> 01:58:47.256]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.149 --> 01:58:58.353]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[01:58:58.353 --> 01:59:16.264]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:59:16.264 --> 01:59:20.366]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:59:20.646 --> 01:59:22.407]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[01:59:22.407 --> 01:59:30.573]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[01:59:56.400 --> 01:59:59.106]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.834 --> 02:00:10.659]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.659 --> 02:00:12.240]  You want answers?

[02:00:13.782 --> 02:00:17.986]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.986 --> 02:00:22.290]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.290 --> 02:00:25.493]  It's my final day on the road.
[02:00:25.493 --> 02:00:28.496]  I'm in Baton Rouge, where we first came through last week.
[02:00:28.496 --> 02:00:30.538]  We're back in Austin this evening.
[02:00:31.854 --> 02:00:33.094]  Pray for us and our safety.
[02:00:33.094 --> 02:00:35.175]  I pray for all your safety out there.
[02:00:35.175 --> 02:00:38.476]  Your calls, those that are holding, I'll get right to you at the start of the next segment.
[02:00:38.476 --> 02:00:43.258]  We've got a bunch of big breaking news on the Ron Paul front, you name it.
[02:00:43.258 --> 02:00:54.822]  But we're here right now talking to Foster and Kimberly Gamble, makers of the Thrive film, available at InfoWars.com and a larger movement to try to get people awake to what's happening.
[02:00:55.382 --> 02:00:55.462]  Yes.
[02:01:17.405 --> 02:01:29.734]  I did, though, four or five years ago, get the maker of Zeitgeist on and argue with him a little bit, because I said, what if I don't want to go live and have the big centralized computer run everything that'll make it all fair, because who programs the computer?
[02:01:29.734 --> 02:01:31.836]  And he said, well, you'll be re-educated.
[02:01:31.836 --> 02:01:33.477]  You'll be taken to a re-education center.
[02:01:33.477 --> 02:01:35.138]  And I got mad at him.
[02:01:35.138 --> 02:01:41.943]  And then I invited him on to try to be friendly about a year ago, and he said, you've got to agree that I didn't say you have to go to re-education.
[02:01:41.943 --> 02:01:45.046]  I'm like, I went and watched the show again, and he did say that.
[02:01:45.899 --> 02:01:47.203]  I'm not trying to get in a fight with...
[02:01:48.715 --> 02:01:51.816]  Whatever his stage name is or whatever, Peter Joseph.
[02:01:51.816 --> 02:01:52.936]  I didn't try to get in a fight with him.
[02:01:52.936 --> 02:01:55.857]  I don't want to fight the Zeitgeist people, but, I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:01:55.857 --> 02:01:58.698]  A collectivism, from my experience, is a bloody nightmare.
[02:01:58.698 --> 02:02:02.559]  And the New York Times, of course, endorsed it and all the rest of it, which is not a good sign.
[02:02:02.559 --> 02:02:12.582]  I'm not trying to get in a fight with them, but because you guys are trying to start a movement and having success and bridge the left-right gap and all this stuff, I think you guys are, you know, wholesome and legitimate and mean well.
[02:02:12.582 --> 02:02:18.244]  What is your brief comment, and then a few final solutions, on Zeitgeist and the whole Zeitgeist movement?
[02:02:20.151 --> 02:02:29.685]  Well, I have a lot of respect for Peter Joseph's intention there, and I think he revealed a tremendous amount of useful information in parts of the films.
[02:02:29.685 --> 02:02:34.933]  And my main problems with the films were, one, economically.
[02:02:35.673 --> 02:02:39.095]  I think that we have a different understanding about money.
[02:02:39.095 --> 02:02:40.896]  I don't think money is evil.
[02:02:40.896 --> 02:02:46.118]  I think that dishonest money is corrupt and it destroys people's lives and society.
[02:02:46.118 --> 02:02:51.981]  But I think a medium of exchange, if it's honest, is always going to be needed and practical.
[02:02:51.981 --> 02:03:03.346]  And secondly, I also have a horror of these high-tech collectivist types of cities that, I mean, I think a lot of the technology that Jacque Fresco suggests is going to be a terrific
[02:03:04.106 --> 02:03:10.268]  Uh, assistance to, uh... Sure, but the centralization, the centralization of it is nightmare.
[02:03:10.268 --> 02:03:11.568]  Exactly, I agree with that completely.
[02:03:11.568 --> 02:03:17.150]  I mean, the Soviets a hundred years ago pushed their whole agenda, as you know, in this sci-fi, you know, utopia.
[02:03:17.150 --> 02:03:19.151]  And it doesn't build a utopia, it builds a nightmare.
[02:03:20.130 --> 02:03:20.791]  I agree with that.
[02:03:20.791 --> 02:03:22.592]  I think we really need to be careful about that.
[02:03:22.592 --> 02:03:24.633]  I think it was disingenuous.
[02:03:24.633 --> 02:03:27.334]  I mean, I think that it was honest on their parts.
[02:03:27.334 --> 02:03:36.899]  I think it's an honest misunderstanding of something that they haven't seen really from the liberty versus collectivist point of view and on the economics.
[02:03:36.899 --> 02:03:38.801]  But I do disagree in the same way that you're saying.
[02:03:39.841 --> 02:03:42.902]  Well, he also, there's, I've seen some of their events online.
[02:03:42.902 --> 02:03:46.743]  It's extreme arrogance and really getting off on, they've got the answer.
[02:03:46.743 --> 02:03:49.324]  And the truth is, we don't have the answer.
[02:03:49.324 --> 02:03:53.745]  We need the, you know, the diversity of liberty is the answer and it's got to be worked out.
[02:03:53.745 --> 02:03:58.166]  Anytime you hear, this is the silver bullet, historically, and plus in my gut, run.
[02:03:58.846 --> 02:03:59.806]  Yeah.
[02:03:59.806 --> 02:04:07.529]  Well, you know, the person who introduced me to you, Alex, was my son, Trevor, and I will be forever indebted.
[02:04:07.529 --> 02:04:14.592]  He was really the one who woke me up to the conspiracy, to what's going on with the money, and also to Liberty.
[02:04:14.592 --> 02:04:17.553]  I remember the day he said, have you heard of this guy, Alex Jones?
[02:04:17.553 --> 02:04:18.894]  And I said, no, what is he doing?
[02:04:18.894 --> 02:04:23.515]  Well, he makes some movies, and he handed me a stack of movies, you know, that changed my life.
[02:04:23.515 --> 02:04:27.957]  And for those of you who may not know what we're talking about with the Liberty perspective,
[02:04:28.557 --> 02:04:41.869]  He's written a terrific book called The Secrets to Non-Violent Prosperity, The Principles of Liberty, the layout of the evidence in ways that you don't get in casual conversations with people.
[02:04:41.869 --> 02:04:44.091]  We're out of time, Kimberly, and I want to get more of the solutions.
[02:04:44.091 --> 02:04:46.373]  Let's have you back up in a few weeks.
[02:04:46.373 --> 02:04:48.134]  If you could do it, it was hard to get you guys on.
[02:04:48.134 --> 02:04:48.975]  You're so busy.
[02:04:48.975 --> 02:04:51.217]  Come on in a few weeks and bring Trevor along.
[02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:52.198]  This is really exciting.
[02:04:52.198 --> 02:04:53.779]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:04:53.779 --> 02:04:54.219]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:54.219 --> 02:04:54.840]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:55.340]  It's an honor.
[02:04:56.121 --> 02:04:58.082]  And they're on tomorrow on the Nightly News.
[02:04:58.082 --> 02:04:59.582]  So, uh, they just reminded me of that.
[02:04:59.582 --> 02:05:00.422]  So they'll be back tomorrow.
[02:05:00.422 --> 02:05:01.062]  Bring Trevor!
[02:05:01.062 --> 02:05:05.603]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[02:05:05.603 --> 02:05:06.524]  Number one.
[02:05:06.524 --> 02:05:09.945]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.945 --> 02:05:10.805]  Number two.
[02:05:10.805 --> 02:05:15.306]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.686 --> 02:05:16.426]  It's true.
[02:05:16.426 --> 02:05:22.128]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:22.128 --> 02:05:25.710]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.710 --> 02:05:30.432]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:30.432 --> 02:05:33.193]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:33.193 --> 02:05:36.534]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.854 --> 02:05:41.796]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.796 --> 02:05:46.858]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:46.858 --> 02:05:51.019]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:06:01.909 --> 02:06:03.630]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.

[02:06:19.995 --> 02:06:27.518]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:06:27.518 --> 02:06:35.522]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:06:35.522 --> 02:06:40.764]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:07:01.016 --> 02:07:05.998]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[02:07:05.998 --> 02:07:18.504]  Whether you're struggling with food costs, which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand.
[02:07:18.504 --> 02:07:20.585]  eFoods Direct Family Packs are the answer.

[02:08:05.953 --> 02:08:10.797]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:10.797 --> 02:08:12.379]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.379 --> 02:08:13.920]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:18.124]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.124 --> 02:08:22.208]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:27.262 --> 02:08:30.284]  Okay, here is what I'm going to do.
[02:08:30.284 --> 02:08:37.210]  I'm gonna go to Carl, Scott, Chris, Kyle, Ronnie, and others, and then I'm gonna get into all this news.
[02:08:37.210 --> 02:08:39.652]  A lot of it's broken since we got on air.
[02:08:39.652 --> 02:08:42.494]  Nanny State walking is dangerous, they're now saying.
[02:08:42.494 --> 02:08:43.295]  I'm not joking.
[02:08:45.015 --> 02:08:49.737]  That dovetails with another report we've got about the insane nanny state.
[02:08:49.737 --> 02:08:53.559]  Ten points that just show how incredible it is.
[02:08:53.559 --> 02:08:55.000]  Ron Paul confronts Bernanke.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.440]  Do you buy your own groceries?
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:02.683]  It's like when George Herbert Walker Bush didn't know what a scanner was at the grocery store about a decade after they were out.
[02:09:02.683 --> 02:09:06.785]  Also, Professor Pervert.
[02:09:06.785 --> 02:09:08.926]  Interspecies genocide.
[02:09:08.926 --> 02:09:10.767]  Reduce current human numbers.
[02:09:13.356 --> 02:09:15.899]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[02:09:15.899 --> 02:09:21.965]  Also, Obama issues policy directive exempting American cities from indefinite detention.
[02:09:21.965 --> 02:09:25.389]  That is just some of what we're going to be covering here today.
[02:09:25.389 --> 02:09:31.155]  But right now, without further ado, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[02:09:31.155 --> 02:09:32.536]  Carl in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:09:32.536 --> 02:09:33.938]  Welcome.
[02:09:33.938 --> 02:09:34.558]  Hey, Alex.
[02:09:34.558 --> 02:09:35.099]  How you doing, man?
[02:09:36.886 --> 02:09:37.226]  You there?
[02:09:37.226 --> 02:09:37.806]  Good, sir.
[02:09:37.806 --> 02:09:40.287]  Welcome.
[02:09:40.287 --> 02:09:46.410]  On the topic of Ron Paul, you know, I mean, we just need to flat out support him.
[02:09:46.410 --> 02:09:53.333]  I mean, no matter what these globalists try to do, we just need to back up this guy no matter what comes around.
[02:09:53.333 --> 02:10:01.517]  You know, as we follow people, you know, and just like what the filmmakers were talking about, you know, we always want to follow something.
[02:10:01.517 --> 02:10:06.139]  They made some mention is, you know, when you follow the money, you see who's in charge.
[02:10:06.959 --> 02:10:08.280]  You know, I was thinking about this.
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:14.224]  I said, you know, you ought to come up with a t-shirt that actually says, you know, follow the eugenics and you'll see who's in charge.
[02:10:14.224 --> 02:10:17.045]  And on the back of the t-shirt it should say, and who's the target?
[02:10:17.045 --> 02:10:17.986]  You.
[02:10:17.986 --> 02:10:20.487]  I mean, that's what it really comes right down to.
[02:10:20.487 --> 02:10:23.209]  It's really what you said a few weeks ago.
[02:10:23.209 --> 02:10:25.230]  You know, it's not about the money.
[02:10:25.230 --> 02:10:27.471]  This isn't about money at all.
[02:10:27.471 --> 02:10:28.532]  This is about eugenics.
[02:10:29.051 --> 02:10:36.562]  And if you can really wrap your head around this, you'll see why guys like Ron Paul, you know, are going to be ostracized.
[02:10:36.562 --> 02:10:40.868]  They're going to be put out there and lied about and talked down about.
[02:10:40.868 --> 02:10:43.192]  And you're going to have guys like... You're right.
[02:10:43.192 --> 02:10:43.652]  You're right.
[02:10:43.652 --> 02:10:44.654]  It's about total...
[02:10:45.715 --> 02:10:46.135]  Sure, sure.
[02:10:46.135 --> 02:10:48.976]  It's about total takeover of human destiny.
[02:10:48.976 --> 02:10:50.177]  That's winning.
[02:10:50.177 --> 02:10:54.638]  According to the Globalist, it's like many cultures would take over another culture and kill everybody.
[02:10:54.638 --> 02:11:02.621]  That is what total domination is, is to scientifically take control of the whole society, dumb people down or easy to control.
[02:11:02.621 --> 02:11:04.642]  This has been done by design.
[02:11:04.642 --> 02:11:06.423]  Humanity is easy to lift up.
[02:11:06.943 --> 02:11:09.767]  If you have the right leadership and if you have the resources.
[02:11:09.767 --> 02:11:12.651]  The globalists have done everything they can to suppress it.
[02:11:12.651 --> 02:11:17.036]  We could have unlimited resources, unlimited technology, unlimited.
[02:11:17.036 --> 02:11:18.598]  History and science shows that.
[02:11:18.598 --> 02:11:20.781]  And listen, I totally agree with you wholeheartedly.
[02:11:21.738 --> 02:11:25.381]  We've got 100% support Ron Paul because the globalists are scared of him.
[02:11:25.381 --> 02:11:26.021]  They hate him.
[02:11:26.021 --> 02:11:26.922]  It's the message.
[02:11:26.922 --> 02:11:27.982]  It's the liberty.
[02:11:27.982 --> 02:11:30.864]  It's the freedom that's cutting across political lines.
[02:11:30.864 --> 02:11:34.547]  That's why they've pulled out every stop and every fraud and every lie.
[02:11:34.547 --> 02:11:36.488]  And he has been the frontrunner.
[02:11:36.488 --> 02:11:41.572]  I'm saying look out for the bandwagon effect because they've blocked him winning all these primaries that he really won.
[02:11:41.572 --> 02:11:42.532]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:11:42.532 --> 02:11:43.733]  I've already covered it.
[02:11:43.733 --> 02:11:47.936]  Because now some people who are weak-minded will start piling onto the other candidates.
[02:11:47.936 --> 02:11:50.278]  But regardless, look where we've come from four years ago.
[02:11:50.718 --> 02:11:53.321]  Look at how nobody knew ten years ago the Federal Reserve was private.
[02:11:53.321 --> 02:11:54.502]  Maybe one out of a hundred.
[02:11:54.502 --> 02:11:56.544]  Now it's 90 plus percent of people.
[02:11:56.544 --> 02:11:58.226]  We are making headway.
[02:11:58.226 --> 02:12:06.615]  What's popular with the young people, listen, I just drove through three or four states and I had a few older people come over to me who were listeners.
[02:12:06.615 --> 02:12:11.140]  But everywhere, when I'd be walking the dogs on the beach, driving to the Florida Panhandle or in
[02:12:13.912 --> 02:12:17.713]  Everywhere, young people of every race, color, creed, religion.
[02:12:17.713 --> 02:12:24.554]  I mean, I was out yesterday morning on the beach in Panama City, Florida.
[02:12:24.554 --> 02:12:26.054]  Panama Beach, Florida, whatever it's called.
[02:12:26.054 --> 02:12:27.335]  Little town.
[02:12:27.335 --> 02:12:32.656]  And there were all these pre-spring breakers, college students and high school students out there playing frisbee.
[02:12:32.656 --> 02:12:38.597]  And literally half of them that would walk by me while I was walking dogs or just sitting there on the beach making phone calls.
[02:12:39.517 --> 02:12:40.417]  That's Alex Jones!
[02:13:02.262 --> 02:13:04.664]  I mean, and again, I'm not bragging, ooh, people know who I am.
[02:13:04.664 --> 02:13:06.585]  It's actually creepy because it's dangerous.
[02:13:06.585 --> 02:13:08.006]  You know, because I know I'm having an effect.
[02:13:08.006 --> 02:13:09.828]  The globalists certainly don't like this.
[02:13:09.828 --> 02:13:14.732]  We're having such a big effect that half the young people I walk past are awake.
[02:13:14.732 --> 02:13:24.459]  Now, I'd go in a diner full of older folks, snowbirds down there, and one person was looking at me and knew who I was, out of probably 50 people in the small diner that morning.
[02:13:24.459 --> 02:13:28.542]  Okay, so none of the old people knew who I was, and the young people all did.
[02:13:28.542 --> 02:13:29.963]  What does that tell you?
[02:13:29.963 --> 02:13:30.544]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:13:31.863 --> 02:13:34.768]  Well, you know, I was just thinking, you know, what you're saying.
[02:13:34.768 --> 02:13:37.632]  I mean, you look, you woke me up a few years ago.
[02:13:37.632 --> 02:13:39.395]  This is right when Obama came in office.
[02:13:39.395 --> 02:13:44.723]  And when the Obama deception came out, I woke up to this whole thing with the Federal Reserve.
[02:13:45.228 --> 02:13:53.394]  And I know I read some Robert Kiyosaki books, too, and all the stuff about, you know, 2008 and the crash and blah, blah, blah, because he wrote some books, too.
[02:13:53.394 --> 02:13:58.198]  And, you know, I went to this thing called IO USA.
[02:13:58.198 --> 02:14:03.902]  It was some documentary that came out with the former comptroller and his cronies.
[02:14:03.902 --> 02:14:07.384]  It was David Walker and this Concord Coalition.
[02:14:07.384 --> 02:14:10.867]  We went over there to Rice University and sat down and we listened to him.
[02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:12.101]  I don't know.
[02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:37.404]  They're telling you, exactly, they're telling you pay them off, which is all fiat fraud they created, pay them back when you already bailed them out with the bailout money.
[02:14:37.404 --> 02:14:42.666]  They're telling you sit there and just save so they can raise taxes and steal it all.
[02:14:42.666 --> 02:14:49.089]  And again, I'm not saying it's bad to save at one level of the equation, but yeah, all their advice that they're putting out is how to rip people off.
[02:14:49.089 --> 02:14:49.689]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:14:50.649 --> 02:14:57.354]  Well, he said it was quasi-government, because I said, is it privately held, uh, the Federal Reserve, or is it government-run?
[02:14:57.354 --> 02:15:20.250]  Well, I already knew that, and, you know, I was flip-flopping, because I was a little nervous talking to him, because I was in a crowd of people and whatnot, but I made my comment, and the woman that was standing behind me, a 70-year-old woman, and it's all on video, by the way, you can get it on riceuniversity.org something something, it's on there, I can give you guys a link, but this lady that was standing behind me, 70-plus-year-old lady, she proudly, unfortunately, she was proud of this,
[02:15:20.876 --> 02:15:32.664]  She said, I am going to tell you that I served on the Federal Reserve Board and I can tell you right now that it is not government run, that it is a privately held entity.
[02:15:32.664 --> 02:15:35.746]  And I said, wow, she told the truth.
[02:15:35.746 --> 02:15:42.251]  And it was, I mean, the rest of the room was just sitting there and it's too bad they didn't have the camera pinned to the rest of the room.
[02:15:42.251 --> 02:15:44.112]  But, you know, it was quiet.
[02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:47.972]  Well, you know, something else happened here today.
[02:15:47.972 --> 02:15:51.835]  I said, Jess calls on Ron Paul, and these are the best callers we ever have.
[02:15:51.835 --> 02:15:53.877]  And the callers are great, but I don't screen them.
[02:15:53.877 --> 02:15:56.319]  And so folks call in who are all over the map.
[02:15:56.319 --> 02:16:02.003]  And I say, Ron Paul, every caller has just been incredible gold today and has been so enlightening.
[02:16:02.003 --> 02:16:04.846]  That's why I probably should every day say, here's the topic.
[02:16:04.846 --> 02:16:09.209]  We're talking about this because then people call in who actually want to discuss something real.
[02:16:10.982 --> 02:16:13.124]  Again, it is the young people that are waking up.
[02:16:13.124 --> 02:16:20.631]  Either older folks are already awake, or they're partially awake, or they're totally asleep and you're not going to wake them up because they don't want to be woken up.
[02:16:20.631 --> 02:16:23.093]  But going back to what you're talking about here...
[02:16:24.218 --> 02:16:31.026]  It's all coming down right now and people are either going to join the side of liberty or they're going to try to go down with the ship.
[02:16:31.026 --> 02:16:34.650]  But I want to be able to pull up this video you're talking about.
[02:16:34.650 --> 02:16:40.698]  So tell us the name of the event and then give us an idea of when in the event it was and then people should be able to find it.
[02:16:42.279 --> 02:16:45.460]  What I can do is more talk off the phone, because I have to kind of Google it.
[02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:46.521]  I'll find it.
[02:16:46.521 --> 02:16:47.901]  I actually burned it on DVD.
[02:16:47.901 --> 02:16:48.882]  I actually have it.
[02:16:48.882 --> 02:16:50.802]  I mean, so I'll have to mail it to you and you can watch it.
[02:16:50.802 --> 02:16:52.603]  Yeah, but what was the name of the event?
[02:16:52.603 --> 02:16:54.064]  What was the name of the university again?
[02:16:54.064 --> 02:17:02.627]  It was... You can Google IOUSA, Rice University, Concord Coalition.
[02:17:02.627 --> 02:17:04.668]  It's hard, because that's all I can mention.
[02:17:04.668 --> 02:17:05.508]  David Walker.
[02:17:05.508 --> 02:17:07.309]  Type in just key names.
[02:17:07.813 --> 02:17:12.054]  But what I can do is I'll have to find it somehow.
[02:17:12.054 --> 02:17:13.374]  But I don't want to... Sure.
[02:17:13.374 --> 02:17:17.395]  I do want to say, look, man, I really support what Ron's doing.
[02:17:17.395 --> 02:17:19.995]  He's been talking about this for 35, 40 years.
[02:17:19.995 --> 02:17:21.435]  You can watch his older videos.
[02:17:21.435 --> 02:17:22.696]  He hasn't changed his message.
[02:17:22.696 --> 02:17:25.576]  So a lot of people think, oh, where's this guy come around?
[02:17:25.576 --> 02:17:27.937]  Well, he's been talking about this for years.
[02:17:27.937 --> 02:17:30.277]  So it's not anything that's new.
[02:17:30.277 --> 02:17:31.897]  He's just been the same.
[02:17:31.897 --> 02:17:33.358]  And people don't like that.
[02:17:33.358 --> 02:17:35.998]  They don't like someone that's going to keep consistent with their story.
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:39.362]  They don't like people that are proven right.
[02:17:39.362 --> 02:17:40.463]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:17:40.463 --> 02:17:41.044]  Great points.
[02:17:41.044 --> 02:17:46.588]  The reason Ron Paul is so dangerous is because he's been the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
[02:17:46.588 --> 02:17:47.890]  He was right.
[02:17:47.890 --> 02:17:51.172]  And it shows that their system is a fraud by design.
[02:17:51.172 --> 02:17:52.253]  He's so right.
[02:17:52.253 --> 02:17:53.394]  We're so right.
[02:17:53.394 --> 02:17:55.996]  That's why we're the dangerous bad men.
[02:17:55.996 --> 02:18:00.260]  Because the crooks know if people get wise to this, it's game over.
[02:18:00.260 --> 02:18:04.503]  I mean, their crimes are so cartoon level, out of control, it's over.
[02:18:05.464 --> 02:18:11.208]  Now, as for the Federal Reserve being private, to these lawyers, in a way what he said is true.
[02:18:11.208 --> 02:18:14.131]  Well, it's quasi-private, quasi-government.
[02:18:14.131 --> 02:18:15.812]  And in a way that's true.
[02:18:15.812 --> 02:18:19.655]  Back when they used to say it's the Federal Reserve, it's government, that was a lie.
[02:18:19.655 --> 02:18:23.578]  And you're a conspiracy theorist if you say it's federal.
[02:18:23.578 --> 02:18:27.561]  You're a conspiracy theorist if you say the Federal Reserve is not federal and is private.
[02:18:28.348 --> 02:18:31.770]  Okay, I mean, I remember 15 years ago, people calling the show going, you're nuts.
[02:18:31.770 --> 02:18:32.670]  It's the Federal Reserve.
[02:18:32.670 --> 02:18:34.931]  You know, dangerous conspiracy theorists say that.
[02:18:34.931 --> 02:18:37.612]  ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, would say you were crazy.
[02:18:37.612 --> 02:18:44.035]  Now they have to admit that it's private, but then they spin it to say, but it's quasi-government.
[02:18:44.035 --> 02:18:51.639]  But in a way, that's true, because it's carrying out a congressional, government, treasury function illegally.
[02:18:52.554 --> 02:18:54.075]  They've usurped it.
[02:18:54.075 --> 02:19:08.303]  And so, yes, it is a corporate fascist banking cartel that is carrying out a government function that's supposed to be totally neutral and just a symbol of currency that is out there so people can exchange goods, not making everything about the currency itself.
[02:19:08.303 --> 02:19:13.626]  So these private interests are able to give themselves this money, interest-free.
[02:19:13.626 --> 02:19:19.350]  But even better, they get the public to give them the money, interest-free, and then we're in debt to them when they loan it back to us.
[02:19:20.939 --> 02:19:22.340]  So they want more debt.
[02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:23.980]  That's why they want unfunded mandates.
[02:19:23.980 --> 02:19:25.381]  That's why they want this control.
[02:19:25.381 --> 02:19:28.362]  But in a weird lawyer way, he was telling the truth.
[02:19:28.362 --> 02:19:31.043]  Well, it is private, but it's quasi-government.
[02:19:31.043 --> 02:19:34.805]  Well, yeah, it's, I mean, NATO's pretty much private.
[02:19:34.805 --> 02:19:38.467]  The British East India Company took over and created what's modern India.
[02:19:39.207 --> 02:19:44.968]  Before the British ever had to come in and back them up, they ran India and all those souls.
[02:19:44.968 --> 02:19:47.609]  And it was a private corporation, but it was still government.
[02:19:47.609 --> 02:19:58.511]  See, I'm for privatization, but not this counterfeit where they come in and just take over what the people built, jack up the prices and become the government themselves and get rid of due process.
[02:19:58.511 --> 02:19:59.052]  See the difference?
[02:19:59.052 --> 02:20:00.192]  It's all about labels.
[02:20:00.192 --> 02:20:00.912]  More calls coming up.
[02:20:01.212 --> 02:20:02.653]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

[02:20:41.416 --> 02:20:51.325]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:20:51.325 --> 02:20:52.827]  The war is here.
[02:20:52.827 --> 02:20:54.708]  It's an info war.
[02:20:54.708 --> 02:20:57.271]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[02:22:52.929 --> 02:22:53.510]  Leave me a message.
[02:23:03.137 --> 02:23:04.418]  Claire, it's Anne.
[02:23:04.418 --> 02:23:07.362]  Hey, you know that hormone balancing product we talked about before?
[02:23:07.362 --> 02:23:08.403]  The all-natural one.
[02:23:08.403 --> 02:23:08.843]  Ambrin?
[02:23:08.843 --> 02:23:10.285]  Well, I gotta tell you this.
[02:23:10.285 --> 02:23:17.672]  Not only did Ambrin stop my hot flashes, but since I started the Ambrin program, I have lost so much weight.
[02:23:17.672 --> 02:23:19.474]  Seriously, even my belly fat.
[02:23:19.474 --> 02:23:19.995]  It's gone.
[02:23:19.995 --> 02:23:22.457]  I haven't been this thin in years.
[02:23:22.457 --> 02:23:23.118]  I feel great.
[02:23:23.118 --> 02:23:23.699]  Give me a call.
[02:23:23.919 --> 02:23:27.581]  The leading cause of weight gain in women over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[02:23:27.581 --> 02:23:31.383]  Until you balance your hormones, it can be practically impossible to lose weight.

[02:23:52.277 --> 02:23:52.337]  1-800-839-2959.
[02:24:12.005 --> 02:24:12.685]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:24:12.685 --> 02:24:12.985]  Yes I can.
[02:24:40.410 --> 02:24:43.092]  The reason I'm called is because... Yeah, bro, you're on air.
[02:24:43.092 --> 02:24:43.973]  Hold on just a minute.
[02:24:43.973 --> 02:24:44.674]  Can you hear me?
[02:24:44.674 --> 02:24:45.654]  Hold on just a minute.
[02:24:45.654 --> 02:24:48.697]  Because I'm talking to you and you said hello and you kept talking.
[02:24:48.697 --> 02:24:51.339]  Can you hear me, Scott?
[02:24:51.339 --> 02:24:53.600]  Yes.
[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:54.221]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:24:54.221 --> 02:24:57.103]  You're on the air right now.
[02:24:57.103 --> 02:24:59.805]  I think it's amazing that I'm talking to Alex Jones.
[02:24:59.805 --> 02:25:05.289]  You're a big force helping Ron Paul's presidential campaign.
[02:25:05.289 --> 02:25:08.992]  I think that something I would like to suggest is that
[02:25:09.659 --> 02:25:15.183]  To help revive the Ron Paul Rock the Revolution with Zach Carter.
[02:25:15.183 --> 02:25:25.349]  I know a guy that was on the Ron Paul Rock the Revolution tour before it fell apart.
[02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:26.870]  His name's Aaron Greens.
[02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:29.231]  He's a consciousness rapper.
[02:25:29.231 --> 02:25:32.393]  He raps about all the things you talk about.
[02:25:32.393 --> 02:25:38.037]  And a 10 FEMA district, a 10 city tour.
[02:25:38.604 --> 02:25:48.594]  With Willie Nelson, Dave Mustaine, you, Alex Jones, Jesse Ventura, collecting our signatures as a write-in candidate for Ron Paul.
[02:25:48.594 --> 02:25:51.537]  You could go through 10 cities in the U.S.
[02:25:51.537 --> 02:25:58.924]  and collect millions of our signatures saying we want Ron Paul as our president because this is our last chance.
[02:25:58.924 --> 02:26:02.368]  The trends, like Gerald Salinda says, the trends aren't getting better, yes.
[02:26:04.341 --> 02:26:04.901]  Hello?
[02:26:04.901 --> 02:26:07.502]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[02:26:07.502 --> 02:26:10.263]  I don't know if... Thank you.
[02:26:10.263 --> 02:26:15.105]  I don't think that Dave Mustaine is going to... He likes Ron Paul.
[02:26:15.105 --> 02:26:16.366]  He told me yesterday on the phone.
[02:26:16.366 --> 02:26:17.987]  He didn't really endorse Santorum.
[02:26:17.987 --> 02:26:20.267]  He said that was out of context.
[02:26:20.267 --> 02:26:23.249]  But I don't know if Dave would be part of that tour.
[02:26:23.249 --> 02:26:29.711]  It's a big deal, you know, with managers and companies and people to try to get all these celebrities to do something together.
[02:26:29.711 --> 02:26:30.952]  That's why that's so hard.
[02:26:32.112 --> 02:26:34.674]  I was at the Orlando event and it was so good.
[02:26:34.674 --> 02:26:35.375]  It went over so well.
[02:26:35.375 --> 02:26:36.016]  The audience was so hyped.
[02:26:49.219 --> 02:26:51.041]  And the movie was great.
[02:26:51.041 --> 02:27:00.069]  I was so glad that you showed your funny side at the beginning because the movie got kind of, you know, went pretty deep and dark.
[02:27:00.069 --> 02:27:03.472]  But still, I recommend that everybody watch it.
[02:27:03.472 --> 02:27:11.299]  It's just essential, essential viewing and it's kind of like an addendum to Endgame.
[02:27:11.299 --> 02:27:15.463]  What I wanted to say to tie that in, I guess, with Ron Paul.
[02:27:17.472 --> 02:27:41.637]  Oh, I think also, Alex, you should change the E in your middle name to Eugenics Jones, because if it wasn't for you bringing that back out into the lexicon, Eugenics is the whole heart and soul of the New World Order and how they operate, and they have just one thing left to implement their socialist agenda, which is
[02:27:42.487 --> 02:27:43.488]  Uh, healthcare.
[02:27:43.488 --> 02:27:45.369]  Because you already have everything else.
[02:27:45.369 --> 02:28:00.459]  You have free food, you have... And by the way, all the founders of modern eugenics, Bertrand Russell, George Bernard Shaw, all of them, they said, under socialism, if we say you're not producing and we don't like you, we're gonna kill you.
[02:28:00.459 --> 02:28:03.101]  People think socialists are trying to give poor people something.
[02:28:03.101 --> 02:28:03.221]  No.
[02:28:03.681 --> 02:28:10.947]  They want socialism to get you under control to breed a giant underclass to then use as an army against the middle class.
[02:28:10.947 --> 02:28:14.449]  And then in the next phase, they start killing the most of the people.
[02:28:14.449 --> 02:28:17.952]  And we're now seeing that with the death panels, all of it.
[02:28:17.952 --> 02:28:19.133]  So you're absolutely right.
[02:28:19.133 --> 02:28:24.357]  But as for, you know, the event there in Florida, it was amazing.
[02:28:24.357 --> 02:28:29.641]  And yes, it is by admitting how bad things are that we can then have a solution to it.
[02:28:29.641 --> 02:28:31.383]  But any other points you'd like to make?
[02:28:32.199 --> 02:28:46.205]  Yeah, and what I was going to say was it doesn't, yeah, and at the same time it doesn't mean we can't have a sense of humor about it like you did at the beginning, but what I wanted to say too was, because this has been bugging me and this guy bugs me every week, is Bill Maher.
[02:28:46.205 --> 02:28:57.290]  And what he said about Ron Paul, you know, he'll have Ron Paul on in one day, or he'll go on and he'll talk and he'll bring up Ron Paul when he's on like MSNBC or somewhere.
[02:28:58.829 --> 02:28:59.249]  I don't know.
[02:29:12.398 --> 02:29:12.758]  I think so.
[02:29:30.113 --> 02:29:39.297]  No it doesn't.
[02:29:39.297 --> 02:29:42.979]  It creates hell holes.
[02:29:42.979 --> 02:29:43.979]  I tell you what, stay there.
[02:29:43.979 --> 02:29:47.341]  I want you to finish your celebrity point.
[02:29:47.341 --> 02:29:50.662]  Then we'll get to the other callers and then I'm getting to the news straight ahead.
[02:29:50.662 --> 02:29:52.003]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.003 --> 02:29:53.603]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.603 --> 02:29:57.205]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.287 --> 02:30:03.989]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:03.989 --> 02:30:09.294]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:30:09.294 --> 02:30:10.836]  Saving means to make money.
[02:30:10.836 --> 02:30:19.624]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:30:20.365 --> 02:30:27.890]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:30:27.890 --> 02:30:35.895]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:30:35.895 --> 02:30:41.118]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:31:00.894 --> 02:31:08.117]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:31:08.117 --> 02:31:26.003]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:31:26.003 --> 02:31:30.125]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:31:30.405 --> 02:31:32.166]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[02:31:32.166 --> 02:31:40.332]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:31:40.332 --> 02:31:46.636]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:31:46.636 --> 02:31:47.917]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:31:47.917 --> 02:31:48.797]  It's incredible.

[02:32:00.725 --> 02:32:02.026]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.026 --> 02:32:07.629]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:07.629 --> 02:32:12.651]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:32:12.651 --> 02:32:13.111]  It's true.
[02:32:13.111 --> 02:32:17.674]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:32:18.214 --> 02:32:23.438]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:32:23.438 --> 02:32:25.739]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:32:25.739 --> 02:32:30.542]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:32:30.542 --> 02:32:31.663]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:31.663 --> 02:32:34.745]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:32:34.745 --> 02:32:38.368]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:32:38.368 --> 02:32:41.550]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:32:41.550 --> 02:32:43.771]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:32:43.771 --> 02:32:44.692]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:32:48.334 --> 02:32:51.296]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:51.296 --> 02:32:57.400]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:32:57.400 --> 02:33:03.244]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:33:03.244 --> 02:33:14.112]  Somewhere in the long hills of Elroyville, you guys thought and realized how eternal fate has turned its back on you.
[02:33:19.048 --> 02:33:19.728]  It's 2 a.m.
[02:33:19.728 --> 02:33:23.131]  and we figured it out.
[02:33:23.131 --> 02:33:24.412]  It's 2 a.m.
[02:33:24.412 --> 02:33:25.432]  The sun's still warm.
[02:33:25.432 --> 02:33:28.634]  My friends, we stand at the crossroads.
[02:33:28.634 --> 02:33:33.377]  You ignore the information covered here daily at your own peril.
[02:33:33.377 --> 02:33:35.319]  You ignore the information.
[02:33:35.319 --> 02:33:46.406]  The blood, sweat, and tears we put out to bring you the reports, the videos, the guests, the information at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:49.810 --> 02:33:52.852]  We need to make hay while the sun shines.
[02:33:52.852 --> 02:33:57.396]  The globalists are coming down on us right now.
[02:33:57.396 --> 02:33:59.478]  This new world order is real.
[02:33:59.478 --> 02:34:01.219]  World government is real.
[02:34:01.219 --> 02:34:03.021]  Secret arrest of citizens.
[02:34:03.021 --> 02:34:04.142]  Torture.
[02:34:04.142 --> 02:34:05.903]  Poisoning of the food and water supply.
[02:34:05.903 --> 02:34:08.625]  It's all real.
[02:34:08.625 --> 02:34:13.909]  You are strong enough mentally out there if you're a new listener to at least research
[02:34:15.307 --> 02:34:21.651]  What I'm saying to you and find out that we haven't lied to you, we've told you the truth.
[02:34:21.651 --> 02:34:31.977]  I am begging you to go look at this information so you can see it from your own perspective and understand what we're facing so we can hopefully turn this around.
[02:34:31.977 --> 02:34:41.583]  Okay, I wanted to go back to Chris in Florida to finish his point and I'm going to race through some of the other callers here because I've got to get to the news.
[02:34:41.583 --> 02:34:43.084]  Go ahead, Chris, finish up your point.
[02:34:43.931 --> 02:34:52.016]  Okay, and also, if you're a new listener, you know that the police state is true because you get nervous every time there's a police officer, you know, pulling up behind you.
[02:34:52.016 --> 02:34:57.119]  And I see you on the road getting nervous from the change in the way that you drive and trying to switch lanes.
[02:34:57.119 --> 02:35:09.386]  But what I was talking about with celebrities and why I think that they should be ashamed of themselves is, you know, like I said, Brad Pitt went on there and he talked about how he had been all over the world and that socialism worked in other countries.
[02:35:09.386 --> 02:35:12.508]  Socialism has been a dismal failure everywhere that it's worked.
[02:35:13.221 --> 02:35:18.983]  And suspiciously, every war that America's fought with a socialist country, we've lost.
[02:35:18.983 --> 02:35:21.283]  And we have to ask ourselves that.
[02:35:21.283 --> 02:35:25.244]  Well, that's because the same banking interests want a collectivism.
[02:35:25.244 --> 02:35:30.726]  They want a socialist or fascist command and control to control the money pot and shut down their competition.
[02:35:30.726 --> 02:35:37.188]  Carol Quigley wrote a 900-plus page book for the State Department that the plates then got out, and he got real mad about it.
[02:35:37.188 --> 02:35:38.708]  But they only published a thousand of them.
[02:35:38.708 --> 02:35:41.509]  It was for internal publishing called Tragedy and Hope.
[02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:47.595]  And I've read his other book as well, and he admits that the mega banks are monopoly men.
[02:35:47.595 --> 02:35:48.936]  He believes that's good.
[02:35:48.936 --> 02:35:53.161]  They work with fascists, communists, socialists, anything that's command and control.
[02:35:53.161 --> 02:35:56.685]  And look, I'm not going to get into Brad Pitt, but I'll just leave it at this.
[02:35:57.506 --> 02:36:09.035]  I first learned that Brad Pitt knew about the New World Order because I knew from Aaron Russo off-record that he'd talked to him, he'd given him his film, and that they thought it was very interesting that the Federal Reserve was private.
[02:36:09.035 --> 02:36:16.602]  Aaron Russo produced some big Hollywood movies with some pretty big stars, and of course, you know, Brock Rollingstone of the U.S.
[02:36:16.602 --> 02:36:17.903]  and other things.
[02:36:17.903 --> 02:36:20.044]  He was a patriot, started the Constitutional Party.
[02:36:21.025 --> 02:36:21.626]  We're good to go.
[02:36:42.228 --> 02:36:49.575]  Then, I'm just going to leave it at this, I learned later, I'm not going to get any more details that Brad Pitt supposedly knows about the New World Order and his wife does.
[02:36:49.575 --> 02:36:51.577]  And people say, well then why is she part of the CFR?
[02:36:51.577 --> 02:36:56.822]  Well, you could argue, well to find out what's going on, she wants to become the establishment to deal, you know, with it.
[02:36:56.822 --> 02:36:58.424]  And I'm not going to say any more about Brad Pitt.
[02:37:00.946 --> 02:37:04.269]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:37:04.269 --> 02:37:07.031]  But yes, then these guys think, it's like Ed Asner.
[02:37:07.031 --> 02:37:12.554]  He's on later in the week, because he was going to be on for a full hour and could only do 30 minutes a few weeks ago.
[02:37:12.554 --> 02:37:13.715]  He's a really good guy.
[02:37:13.715 --> 02:37:15.016]  He means well.
[02:37:15.016 --> 02:37:16.617]  And he really believes in socialism.
[02:37:16.617 --> 02:37:17.798]  He knows vaccines are bad.
[02:37:17.798 --> 02:37:20.040]  He knows 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:22.181]  He stands up against these wars.
[02:37:22.181 --> 02:37:25.323]  And then he sees the big system attacking somebody like Chavez.
[02:37:25.323 --> 02:37:27.144]  Well, then Chavez must be good.
[02:37:27.144 --> 02:37:29.026]  See, it's the same thing with Sidney Sheehan.
[02:37:29.526 --> 02:37:32.109]  Well, Chavez is being attacked, he must be good.
[02:37:32.109 --> 02:37:37.436]  No, just because Iran's being attacked, that doesn't make them good, their leadership.
[02:37:37.436 --> 02:37:44.305]  It's that the scientific crooks we've got are more organized and even more wicked than the wicked Iranian leadership.
[02:37:45.330 --> 02:37:45.950]  Okay?
[02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:48.171]  Because power corrupts absolutely.
[02:37:48.171 --> 02:37:53.292]  It's not that Syria's good and Israel's bad.
[02:37:53.292 --> 02:37:54.693]  Israel has corrupt leadership.
[02:37:54.693 --> 02:37:55.773]  So does Syria.
[02:37:55.773 --> 02:37:58.174]  But the West isn't trying to fix Syria.
[02:37:58.174 --> 02:38:02.235]  They're invading with Al-Qaeda to literally push the Christians out.
[02:38:02.235 --> 02:38:03.075]  They've said they are.
[02:38:03.075 --> 02:38:05.116]  Because the globalists hate real Christians.
[02:38:06.856 --> 02:38:11.698]  See, people either think like, well, America's good and you're for the wars or you don't like America.
[02:38:11.698 --> 02:38:14.259]  No, this isn't America doing this.
[02:38:14.259 --> 02:38:19.621]  These battleships, these aircraft carriers, these frigates, these jet aircraft don't belong to us.
[02:38:19.621 --> 02:38:20.701]  We pay for it.
[02:38:20.701 --> 02:38:23.962]  They tell us it's America, but it's not America.
[02:38:23.962 --> 02:38:30.085]  And the fact that they're going to use the NDAA and do all this to the American people and use the military against us, that's been the big wake-up call.
[02:38:30.085 --> 02:38:30.505]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:38:31.764 --> 02:38:40.930]  Oh, and my pet peeve, Alex, real big pet peeve, is some of your guests use this word, democracy, and we are not a democracy.
[02:38:40.930 --> 02:38:43.191]  We are a republic.
[02:38:43.191 --> 02:38:49.795]  And, um, I suggest if you haven't heard it, people type in Alex Jones, real American hero.
[02:38:49.795 --> 02:38:59.621]  And, um, I get goosebumps when I listen to it because, uh, you know, you kind of get into that when you're, um, you know, speaking in that courtroom and, um,
[02:39:00.236 --> 02:39:04.079]  You know, you kind of go into what the difference between democracy and republic is.
[02:39:04.079 --> 02:39:07.921]  And, um, you know, they're left and they're right way too extreme.
[02:39:07.921 --> 02:39:11.484]  And way on the left... What is Alex Jones' real American hero?
[02:39:11.484 --> 02:39:12.965]  I don't know.
[02:39:12.965 --> 02:39:14.246]  Oh, it's an excerpt... Joe or something?
[02:39:14.246 --> 02:39:16.267]  Is that the name of a video or something?
[02:39:16.267 --> 02:39:18.129]  Yeah, if you type it into YouTube.
[02:39:18.129 --> 02:39:27.255]  And, um, uh, it was an excerpt, I think, from, uh, Police State, uh, two or three.
[02:39:28.218 --> 02:39:50.482]  And I think the moment later, it's when you're talking about the Attorney General, and you're saying why the Patriot Act, how they want to pass Patriot Act 1, Patriot Act 2, Victory Act 1, Victory Act 2, and then you went into the... Oh yeah, you're talking about Matrix of Evil when I was at the City Council and the Deputy Attorney General was there and I gave that speech.
[02:39:50.482 --> 02:39:53.262]  Absolutely, that is a very powerful speech I gave.
[02:39:53.262 --> 02:39:56.483]  You're saying they call that on YouTube, Alex Jones, Real American Hero?
[02:39:57.304 --> 02:40:03.603]  Yeah, and in case you forgot what a real American is, that's what I think is the description.
[02:40:04.221 --> 02:40:05.662]  It says, well, here it is.
[02:40:05.662 --> 02:40:07.064]  So everybody should watch that.
[02:40:07.064 --> 02:40:08.265]  No, that is a good speech.
[02:40:08.265 --> 02:40:15.611]  In fact, that's the speech that really woke up when he was given The Matrix of Evil, Emilio Estevez.
[02:40:15.611 --> 02:40:18.974]  And then he gave it to his dad, Martin Sheen, who really liked it.
[02:40:18.974 --> 02:40:22.577]  And then that's how Charlie Sheen became a listener, was Matrix of Evil.
[02:40:22.577 --> 02:40:27.121]  And then they, like, ordered all my videos and locked themselves up at their house.
[02:40:27.121 --> 02:40:30.824]  I think it was at Emilio's house and, like, watched all 10 of my films at the time.
[02:40:30.824 --> 02:40:31.685]  This was, like, eight years ago.
[02:40:32.325 --> 02:40:35.167]  Watched all of them right there in one sitting.
[02:40:35.167 --> 02:40:41.250]  I guess I'm nine years ago man time flies, but yeah, that is a powerful speech I wish it was shot better video.
[02:40:41.250 --> 02:40:46.813]  We just ended up getting the feed from the City Council, but People thought that was a scripted speech too.
[02:40:46.813 --> 02:40:49.275]  That's when I really connect and get passionate sometimes
[02:40:50.035 --> 02:40:51.776]  Also, my speech for the Bilderberg.
[02:40:51.776 --> 02:40:55.339]  I've had film crews go, we know that's scripted, we know that's not a real speech.
[02:40:55.339 --> 02:40:57.280]  I'm like, no, that's what came out of me.
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:01.723]  And those are two speeches I'm really proud of, where I really connected and didn't hold back.
[02:41:01.723 --> 02:41:04.865]  I appreciate you calling in and bringing that up.
[02:41:04.865 --> 02:41:12.731]  Yeah, it's Alex Jones, real American hero, I guess you're saying is the name of what somebody called that when they reposted it on YouTube.
[02:41:12.731 --> 02:41:14.432]  The whole Matrix of Evil is on YouTube.
[02:41:16.383 --> 02:41:17.143]  Uh, for free.
[02:41:17.143 --> 02:41:28.207]  Again, you can get all of my films, all, what, 18 of them, plus Jason Bermas' great film, Invisible Empire, our latest full-length feature we've produced, that exposes the world government program.
[02:41:28.207 --> 02:41:29.307]  All of those for $99.95.
[02:41:29.307 --> 02:41:29.768]  99 smackers.
[02:41:29.768 --> 02:41:30.468]  That'd normally be $380.
[02:41:30.468 --> 02:41:32.468]  Some of those films cost me over $150,000 to produce.
[02:41:32.468 --> 02:41:32.889]  In fact, Bermas' did.
[02:41:41.147 --> 02:41:42.928]  I don't even really make my money back at that level.
[02:41:42.928 --> 02:41:45.549]  I mean, I usually don't even say you buy my DVDs now.
[02:41:45.549 --> 02:41:52.572]  I just say they're free online or see them in quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, but that's how we can do this in the future is you supporting us.
[02:41:52.572 --> 02:41:57.473]  All right, I'll go to your calls in a minute, but I've got to get to this news now before I run out of time.
[02:41:57.473 --> 02:41:59.354]  In fact, we can put this up on screen for folks.
[02:41:59.354 --> 02:42:05.457]  If you go to InfoWars.com, here is some of the news that we've got up there.
[02:42:06.597 --> 02:42:13.662]  Right now that has just broken in the last two and a half hours since I got on air.
[02:42:13.662 --> 02:42:15.804]  Nanny state walking is dangerous.
[02:42:15.804 --> 02:42:17.365]  I'm gonna get to that in a minute.
[02:42:17.365 --> 02:42:21.528]  Also, throat got dry, excuse me.
[02:42:23.795 --> 02:42:29.577]  A new film exposes the blueprint of madness unleashed by the New World Order.
[02:42:29.577 --> 02:42:34.139]  Ron Paul confronts Bernanke, do you buy your own groceries?
[02:42:34.139 --> 02:42:40.722]  Professor says prevent interspecies genocide, reduce current human numbers.
[02:42:41.806 --> 02:42:43.207]  They're constantly coming out.
[02:42:43.207 --> 02:42:52.291]  You know, people yesterday, we had an article linking to the big journal of bioethics, a big global group, that sets the policies for the hospitals.
[02:42:52.291 --> 02:42:57.314]  You thought it was illegal to kill a child or kill an old person, even when they're not brain dead?
[02:42:57.314 --> 02:42:59.515]  Well, no, they have policies now.
[02:42:59.515 --> 02:43:02.156]  They say the death panels are the new policy, so it's okay.
[02:43:02.156 --> 02:43:06.218]  Of course, it's still illegal, but it's a policy, so they tell the cops that, and the cops are like, oh, okay.
[02:43:08.288 --> 02:43:18.413]  The big group advising the American Medical Association came out in the white paper and said, kill children up to the age of three, if the state decides, even if they're not handicapped.
[02:43:18.413 --> 02:43:24.116]  Now it's not just kill handicapped folks, which is of course wrong, or kill babies, because you're saying they're not humans.
[02:43:24.116 --> 02:43:29.018]  The logical extension is to say, kill people up to age three, and kill little people, as Bill Gates has said.
[02:43:29.018 --> 02:43:29.739]  We've played that clip.
[02:43:31.021 --> 02:43:49.430]  People in the YouTube yesterday video where I talked about that, and people in our article that got hundreds, like 400 comments, were saying it was satire, and that the professors weren't serious, and that the, you know, Journal of Bioethics wasn't serious, and that I was a fear monger.
[02:43:49.430 --> 02:43:54.513]  Because, see, people are like, kill children up to age three who are even healthy!
[02:43:54.513 --> 02:43:55.633]  Well, this just can't be true.
[02:43:55.633 --> 02:43:56.474]  Alex Jones is bad.
[02:43:57.148 --> 02:43:57.848]  And you know what?
[02:43:57.848 --> 02:43:59.269]  I don't blame you.
[02:43:59.269 --> 02:44:02.031]  That's so over-the-top, what they're doing openly.
[02:44:02.031 --> 02:44:03.872]  You'd have to admit I was right about all this.
[02:44:03.872 --> 02:44:10.517]  I mean, this isn't just some... You know, the big global journal of bioethics.
[02:44:10.517 --> 02:44:13.058]  And so you're just gonna say I'm a liar.
[02:44:13.058 --> 02:44:18.162]  Or, oh, it's in the big journal and it's adopted by the American Medical Association.
[02:44:18.162 --> 02:44:21.344]  They say they follow this as their handbook.
[02:44:21.344 --> 02:44:24.185]  But they're joking in this white paper.
[02:44:24.185 --> 02:44:24.626]  No, they're not.
[02:44:26.115 --> 02:44:30.918]  I could list you hundreds of papers you can pull up of heads of major university departments.
[02:44:30.918 --> 02:44:33.059]  Peter Singer's the one that says kill kids up to three.
[02:44:33.059 --> 02:44:37.682]  This latest journal is just repeating what he puts out.
[02:44:37.682 --> 02:44:38.683]  Okay?
[02:44:38.683 --> 02:44:42.105]  But people are saying that it can't be true.
[02:44:42.105 --> 02:44:43.426]  And I understand why.
[02:44:44.656 --> 02:44:48.537]  Just like when I said NDAA, we were the first to put articles out about it.
[02:44:48.537 --> 02:44:50.938]  When we saw the legislation, listeners pointed it out to us.
[02:44:50.938 --> 02:44:57.439]  Paul Watson wrote articles saying NDAA allows secret arrests and imprisonment of citizens and killing.
[02:44:57.439 --> 02:45:02.360]  And for about two weeks, the media said it was a hoax and I was a liar.
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:06.441]  And I had people calling up saying, I'm done with you.
[02:45:06.441 --> 02:45:09.802]  Obama says it doesn't affect citizens, plus he's going to veto it.
[02:45:09.802 --> 02:45:12.783]  Now they all admit it affects citizens and say they've got the power to do it.
[02:45:13.646 --> 02:45:14.607]  But I'm still wrong.
[02:45:14.607 --> 02:45:15.968]  See, I'm still bad.
[02:45:15.968 --> 02:45:18.230]  So, they're not saying kill kids up to three.
[02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:21.533]  And I guess Bill Gates doesn't say get rid of grandma and hire ten teachers.
[02:45:21.533 --> 02:45:23.115]  I mean, I could play you the clip.
[02:45:23.115 --> 02:45:29.321]  I was on Man Cow this morning and he knew enough about it to suddenly play the clip when I mentioned it.
[02:45:29.321 --> 02:45:31.383]  You can just type in Bill Gates on death panels.
[02:45:32.602 --> 02:45:38.564]  You know, Time Magazine, or was it Newsweek, covered the case for killing Granny with an image of a woman being unplugged.
[02:45:38.564 --> 02:45:40.704]  But you know what?
[02:45:40.704 --> 02:45:50.688]  That's like when the urban warfare ships landed in 1999 and openly trained to take your guns and take over Oakland and San Francisco and take your guns.
[02:45:50.688 --> 02:45:52.488]  And they admitted it was for America.
[02:45:52.488 --> 02:45:55.149]  And people saw that video and they said, he hired that ship.
[02:45:56.368 --> 02:46:10.477]  And he hired those Marines, and even when it went on Google Video about eight, nine years ago, and back then it was all pixelated and stuff because it was low-res, people saw a little pixelation and stuff and said, oh, it's CG.
[02:46:10.477 --> 02:46:12.338]  The Marines didn't land in Oakland.
[02:46:12.338 --> 02:46:16.100]  They didn't go look it up in the newspapers and find out that was a real thing that happened.
[02:46:16.100 --> 02:46:17.941]  They just said it's CG, Alex is lying.
[02:46:17.941 --> 02:46:20.843]  You know, he's got thousands of troops hired, and it's all fake.
[02:46:21.451 --> 02:46:25.154]  So, you know, they're not saying kill kids up to three, who are even healthy.
[02:46:25.154 --> 02:46:26.515]  They're not saying kill granny.
[02:46:26.515 --> 02:46:28.116]  They're not trying to take our guns.
[02:46:28.116 --> 02:46:30.118]  They're not trying to use the military against us.
[02:46:30.118 --> 02:46:31.358]  They're not doing any of this.
[02:46:31.358 --> 02:46:32.539]  I'm a dirty liar.
[02:46:32.539 --> 02:46:34.381]  I'm a dirty piece of garbage, okay?
[02:46:34.381 --> 02:46:35.442]  I'm the bad guy.
[02:46:35.442 --> 02:46:47.611]  They're publishing a killer flu that kills over 85 to 90 plus percent of people that come in contact with it, that now bridges the gap from the birds to humans, and I am the bad guy.
[02:46:48.211 --> 02:46:49.373]  For being worried about that.
[02:46:49.373 --> 02:46:52.439]  And they're releasing how to build it to the public.
[02:46:52.439 --> 02:46:53.762]  I'm the bad guy!
[02:46:53.762 --> 02:46:56.787]  And if they release it and a billion people die, I'll still be the bad guy.
[02:46:58.311 --> 02:46:59.872]  Okay, I'm the bad man.
[02:46:59.872 --> 02:47:00.772]  I take the blame.
[02:47:00.772 --> 02:47:01.593]  I'm evil.
[02:47:01.593 --> 02:47:02.293]  I'm bad.
[02:47:02.293 --> 02:47:03.494]  I'm bad.
[02:47:03.494 --> 02:47:04.454]  Beat myself in the head.
[02:47:04.454 --> 02:47:06.075]  I'm sorry that I'm right.
[02:47:06.075 --> 02:47:06.756]  I'm sorry.
[02:47:06.756 --> 02:47:07.376]  I'm sorry.
[02:47:07.376 --> 02:47:07.676]  Okay?
[02:47:07.676 --> 02:47:09.157]  I'm real sorry.
[02:47:09.157 --> 02:47:13.079]  I'm real sorry cancer rates up over 2,000 percent in the last decade.
[02:47:13.079 --> 02:47:14.420]  And diabetes and everything else.
[02:47:14.420 --> 02:47:14.960]  I'm sorry.
[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:15.321]  Okay?
[02:47:15.321 --> 02:47:16.141]  The elite are nice.
[02:47:16.141 --> 02:47:16.601]  They love us.
[02:47:16.601 --> 02:47:18.342]  They want to kiss us on the cheek all day.
[02:47:18.342 --> 02:47:19.483]  And play patty cake with us.
[02:47:19.483 --> 02:47:20.584]  Alright?
[02:47:20.584 --> 02:47:22.665]  You people make me want to throw up.
[02:47:22.665 --> 02:47:24.426]  I hope those are just ignoramuses though.
[02:47:25.188 --> 02:47:38.695]  Because if those are actual COINTELPRO and actual paid sock puppets that they admit they have on the web, coming on the site saying, I'm lying about them wanting to kill kids up to age three when I'm linked to all of it.
[02:47:38.695 --> 02:47:43.138]  You people that work for the government, the corporations that are, you are now citing to kill little kids.
[02:47:45.066 --> 02:47:48.587]  Man, you people make me want to throw up.
[02:47:48.587 --> 02:47:55.110]  And of course, when it gets more mainstream and they actually start killing kids, you'll be like, well, that's reasonable, because the state says they're not a human.
[02:47:55.110 --> 02:47:58.531]  The state says they're not conscious yet up to age three.
[02:47:58.531 --> 02:48:01.752]  My kids were conscious when they came out of the womb.
[02:48:01.752 --> 02:48:04.173]  At two years old, they had electricity in their eyes.
[02:48:04.173 --> 02:48:09.275]  My daughter, my firstborn daughter, my son's firstborn, but I mean, I'm the first daughter.
[02:48:09.275 --> 02:48:11.356]  I have two daughters.
[02:48:11.356 --> 02:48:13.717]  This happened to an extent with the other two, but with her,
[02:48:15.290 --> 02:48:22.730]  When they held her up and her eyes, man, were just on electric with consciousness looking at me and I said, whoa, this one is going to be wild.
[02:48:25.613 --> 02:48:29.354]  And you've all experienced it, and you're going to tell me you're going to kill them.
[02:48:29.354 --> 02:48:31.335]  You're a bunch of scum.
[02:48:31.335 --> 02:48:36.496]  And those of you that serve this and are in denial, you're going to bring down all the hell that we're about to face.
[02:48:36.496 --> 02:48:37.857]  I hope we can still avert it.
[02:48:37.857 --> 02:48:44.278]  But those of you that attack those of us trying to warn people just have no idea the danger you're in.
[02:48:44.278 --> 02:48:46.959]  You have no idea how serious this tyranny is.
[02:48:46.959 --> 02:48:50.880]  And I'm here risking my life trying to warn people, and I'm sick of people living in denial.
[02:48:53.905 --> 02:48:55.446]  Let's go to this short clip of Ron Paul.
[02:48:55.446 --> 02:48:57.408]  The full clip's up at Infowars.com.
[02:48:57.408 --> 02:48:58.629]  Big story by Steve Watson.
[02:48:58.629 --> 02:48:59.931]  Ron Paul confronts Bernanke.
[02:48:59.931 --> 02:49:01.492]  Do you buy your own groceries?
[02:49:01.492 --> 02:49:06.216]  To show how disconnected from reality these globalists are, telling us there's no inflation.
[02:49:06.216 --> 02:49:07.698]  Here it is.
[02:49:07.698 --> 02:49:08.839]  Dr. Paul?
[02:49:08.839 --> 02:49:10.380]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[02:49:10.380 --> 02:49:14.504]  Mr. Bernanke, if you don't mind, would you tell me whether or not you do your own shopping at the grocery store?
[02:49:16.178 --> 02:49:17.059]  Yes it is.
[02:49:17.059 --> 02:49:19.080]  Okay, so you're aware of the prices.
[02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:23.163]  But you know, this argument that prices are going up about 2%, nobody believes it.
[02:49:23.163 --> 02:49:27.165]  You know, and the old CPI says prices are going up at 9%, they believe this.
[02:49:27.165 --> 02:49:29.507]  And people on fixed incomes, they're really hurting.
[02:49:29.507 --> 02:49:31.168]  The middle class is really hurting.
[02:49:31.168 --> 02:49:35.591]  Because their inflation rate is very much higher than the government tries to tell them.
[02:49:35.591 --> 02:49:37.993]  And that's why they lose trust in government.
[02:49:38.473 --> 02:49:48.541]  But you know, this whole idea about prices and debasement of currency, if you loaned me $100 and two years from now I gave you $90 back, you'd be pretty upset.
[02:49:48.541 --> 02:49:57.808]  But we're paying money back that's worth 10 or 15 or 20% less, and nobody seems to be able to do anything about it.
[02:49:57.808 --> 02:49:59.149]  It's very upsetting.
[02:49:59.149 --> 02:49:59.970]  But it's theft.
[02:49:59.970 --> 02:50:00.951]  If I don't give you your full
[02:50:01.271 --> 02:50:01.771]  We're good to go.
[02:50:27.467 --> 02:50:33.351]  It doesn't hurt you unless you're one of those people who stick their money in the mattress.
[02:50:33.351 --> 02:50:36.033]  But where are you going to put it?
[02:50:57.707 --> 02:50:59.369]  And try to finish up with your calls.
[02:50:59.369 --> 02:51:00.910]  I haven't gotten to the nanny state yet.
[02:51:00.910 --> 02:51:02.031]  I want to bandwagon.
[02:51:02.031 --> 02:51:05.974]  Allow me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[02:51:05.974 --> 02:51:07.455]  Everyone can feel it.
[02:51:07.455 --> 02:51:16.362]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[02:51:16.362 --> 02:51:19.804]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[02:51:19.804 --> 02:51:20.845]  But take heart.
[02:51:20.845 --> 02:51:24.288]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:51:24.608 --> 02:51:30.032]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[02:51:30.032 --> 02:51:33.874]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[02:51:33.874 --> 02:51:35.595]  The globalists are scared.
[02:51:35.595 --> 02:51:36.936]  They've overreached.
[02:51:36.936 --> 02:51:40.038]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[02:51:58.092 --> 02:51:59.373]  The InfoWar now!
[02:51:59.833 --> 02:52:06.921]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next disaster hits?
[02:52:06.921 --> 02:52:13.328]  If you don't, you and your family may be without food and waiting in long food lines after a big disaster strikes!
[02:52:13.328 --> 02:52:18.153]  You would be surprised how many people don't have these food items right now!
[02:52:18.153 --> 02:52:21.717]  123survivalplan.com has set up a For Patriots Only video
[02:52:22.157 --> 02:52:27.801]  Inside information on the 37 food items that will sell out first when the next disaster strikes.

[02:52:37.008 --> 02:52:41.692]  And you won't have to be afraid of going hungry or being sent to a FEMA refugee camp.
[02:52:41.892 --> 02:52:47.294]  See the video that over one million other smart patriots have already seen in the last four months.

[02:52:54.416 --> 02:52:55.196]  Easy to remember.

[02:52:55.816 --> 02:52:57.537]  Again, that's 123survivalplan.com.
[02:53:01.218 --> 02:53:06.801]  In the past, I've taken a lot of different vitamins, some through health food stores, some that friends recommend.
[02:53:06.801 --> 02:53:09.782]  Colleen, talking about her experience with Super C-Veg.
[02:53:09.782 --> 02:53:12.704]  And with the Super C-Veg, I was seeing a lot better results.
[02:53:12.704 --> 02:53:19.968]  Super C-Veg with Vita-D and C-Cal is the most powerful dietary food supplement in the world today, and nothing else comes close.
[02:53:19.968 --> 02:53:23.810]  Super C-Veg is a whole food that makes me feel good.
[02:53:23.810 --> 02:53:26.211]  Think of Super C-Veg as the un-vitamin.
[02:53:26.351 --> 02:53:29.353]  I have taken other things, and they just didn't work.
[02:53:29.353 --> 02:53:30.614]  This seems to work for me.
[02:53:30.614 --> 02:53:33.637]  And Super C-Veg comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee.
[02:53:33.637 --> 02:53:39.781]  Store-bought vitamins do not have the supplement and the full, whole feeling I have from Super C-Veg.

[02:53:59.176 --> 02:54:08.223]  Hey guys, I'm...
[02:54:32.882 --> 02:54:34.683]  Escape from the prison planet.
[02:54:34.683 --> 02:54:36.224]  Escape from the prison planet.
[02:54:36.224 --> 02:54:37.825]  That's what we're trying to do here.
[02:54:37.825 --> 02:54:40.286]  Let me blitz through some of the other news.
[02:54:40.286 --> 02:54:41.506]  Goodbye First Amendment.
[02:54:41.506 --> 02:54:44.708]  Trespass bill will make protesting legal.
[02:54:44.708 --> 02:54:52.212]  And the Feds, the House of Representatives has passed 388 to 3 as they circle the wagons against the American people.
[02:54:52.212 --> 02:54:52.472]  HR 347.
[02:54:54.943 --> 02:55:03.267]  And any federal parks, federal buildings, commons areas, now it's going to be trespassing to be on.
[02:55:03.267 --> 02:55:05.068]  Let me tell you, I've been to D.C.
[02:55:05.068 --> 02:55:06.708]  and I've been to third world countries.
[02:55:06.708 --> 02:55:14.912]  Nowhere are you treated in the world like abject trash, like you are with a camera, including ladies with their kids.
[02:55:14.912 --> 02:55:16.613]  It wasn't just us.
[02:55:16.613 --> 02:55:19.934]  Washington Monument, videotaping it.
[02:55:19.934 --> 02:55:21.355]  Women with their kids, tourists.
[02:55:22.478 --> 02:55:26.702]  Security guards come over, get in your face.
[02:55:26.702 --> 02:55:28.664]  Cops come over, get in your face.
[02:55:28.664 --> 02:55:30.266]  Try to videotape the White House.
[02:55:30.266 --> 02:55:31.087]  Goons come over.
[02:55:31.087 --> 02:55:35.031]  I mean, this country is pathetic.
[02:55:35.031 --> 02:55:37.734]  Land of the free, home of the brave, give me a break.
[02:55:37.734 --> 02:55:38.735]  I love this nation.
[02:55:38.735 --> 02:55:39.676]  I want to get it back.
[02:55:39.676 --> 02:55:42.599]  But Washington is a group of crooks robbing us.
[02:55:42.599 --> 02:55:43.480]  And when you come there,
[02:55:44.580 --> 02:55:47.022]  You are being taught that you're trash.
[02:55:47.022 --> 02:55:49.605]  I mean, you want to experience it, go to D.C.
[02:55:49.605 --> 02:55:55.110]  and be prepared for the scum that works for this government to let you know you are the enemy.
[02:55:55.110 --> 02:55:59.154]  I mean, they act like the public, people with their kids, are the enemy.
[02:55:59.154 --> 02:56:03.198]  Well, you've seen the famous footage of people pulled over by a police officer in a neighborhood.
[02:56:04.229 --> 02:56:07.011]  Does it happen to get caught on the squad car tape?
[02:56:07.011 --> 02:56:09.814]  And they said, oh hi officer, can you please tell us where this road is?
[02:56:09.814 --> 02:56:10.754]  We're lost.
[02:56:10.754 --> 02:56:12.536]  They just said, that's it, get over there, you're arrested.
[02:56:12.536 --> 02:56:13.797]  You don't ask me questions.
[02:56:13.797 --> 02:56:15.058]  Handcuffs, took him to jail.
[02:56:15.058 --> 02:56:28.509]  In D.C., even the Washington Times reported a few years ago, the police off-duty own their own wrecker companies and pull into McDonald's and other parking lots and take cars parked legally and demand up to $1,000 to get them back.
[02:56:30.862 --> 02:56:31.942]  In uniform.
[02:56:31.942 --> 02:56:32.463]  Off duty.
[02:56:32.463 --> 02:56:34.463]  And the police say, yeah, you're allowed to do that.
[02:56:34.463 --> 02:56:35.624]  The union runs everything.
[02:56:35.624 --> 02:56:36.944]  They're a total mafia.
[02:56:36.944 --> 02:56:39.565]  This is the way all of America is going.
[02:56:39.565 --> 02:56:46.788]  Just abject criminals and thugs, scum working for them, who want you to know that gang raping is here.
[02:56:46.788 --> 02:56:47.649]  And go read it.
[02:56:47.649 --> 02:56:49.709]  You will not even stand.
[02:56:49.709 --> 02:56:50.990]  You're all going to jail.
[02:56:50.990 --> 02:56:52.531]  The parasites rule.
[02:56:52.531 --> 02:56:55.072]  You pay their salary and that's it.
[02:56:55.072 --> 02:56:55.552]  So, there you go.
[02:56:57.293 --> 02:57:10.687]  Again, we're going to premiere tonight my new 40-minute documentary, New World Order Blueprint of Mad Men, showing the real threats, 19 signs that America has become a control freak, crazy control freak nation, where almost everything is illegal.
[02:57:10.687 --> 02:57:16.753]  And of course, we also have our video that breaks all of that down that's up at InfoWars.com.
[02:57:18.434 --> 02:57:19.455]  I mean, here's just some of them.
[02:57:19.455 --> 02:57:21.116]  I should have read this earlier.
[02:57:21.116 --> 02:57:24.558]  One California town is actually considering making it illegal to smoke in your own backyard.
[02:57:24.558 --> 02:57:29.461]  Louisiana, a church, was recently ordered to stop giving out water because it did not have a permit to do so.
[02:57:29.461 --> 02:57:34.864]  Number three, in the United States, it is illegal to operate a train that does not have a F painted on the front.
[02:57:34.864 --> 02:57:39.007]  Apparently, without the F, we all might not know where the front of the train is.
[02:57:39.007 --> 02:57:40.047]  Number four, in many U.S.
[02:57:40.047 --> 02:57:44.010]  states, it is now illegal to collect rainwater that falls from the sky on your own property.
[02:57:44.010 --> 02:57:44.490]  Number five,
[02:57:44.950 --> 02:57:49.753]  In America today, it's illegal to milk your own cow and sell the milk to your neighbor.
[02:57:49.753 --> 02:57:54.516]  Number six, in Washington, D.C., it's illegal to not recycle cat litter, $1,000 fines.
[02:57:54.516 --> 02:57:58.178]  Number seven, it's illegal to give your tour of the monuments in D.C.
[02:57:58.178 --> 02:57:59.419]  without a license.
[02:57:59.419 --> 02:58:03.942]  Number eight, in the United States, it is illegal to sell natural cures for cancer, even if they work.
[02:58:03.942 --> 02:58:08.184]  Number nine, the state of Massachusetts is illegal to deface a milk carton.
[02:58:08.184 --> 02:58:11.927]  Number 10, in the state of Alabama, bear wrestling is completely illegal.
[02:58:11.927 --> 02:58:13.928]  In Fairbanks, Alaska, it's illegal to give alcoholic
[02:58:13.968 --> 02:58:15.329]  Beverages to a moose.
[02:58:15.329 --> 02:58:22.873]  Number 12, in Lake Elmo, Minnesota, it's illegal to sell pumpkins or Christmas trees that are grown outside city limits.
[02:58:22.873 --> 02:58:26.435]  There's a federal law that makes it illegal to be annoying on the internet.
[02:58:26.435 --> 02:58:28.096]  We have links to all these.
[02:58:28.096 --> 02:58:30.738]  14, I can't even get to it all.
[02:58:30.738 --> 02:58:36.481]  And then I have video of signs saying you can't walk on the boardwalk because people might trip.
[02:58:36.481 --> 02:58:41.144]  So now they've put little concrete paths you've got to walk on because old-fashioned boardwalks aren't safe.
