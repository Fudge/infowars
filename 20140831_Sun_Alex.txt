[07:44.920 --> 07:49.600]  to put the facts out there it should be very informative then we've got Dr. Michael Kaufman
[07:49.600 --> 07:54.080]  joining us to break down the fact that Obama plans to just skip the Senate and put us under

[08:04.400 --> 08:10.800]  few years it's all part of the UN that's where Obama gets his authority public doesn't know
[08:10.800 --> 08:19.600]  any better why not and then we've got the IRS persecution going on and more Larry claiming

[08:24.560 --> 08:29.000]  us so it's another jam-packed Sunday show a lot of listeners have pointed out man this
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.440]  two hour show seems to have even more info in it than a weekday show I don't know that's
[08:32.440 --> 08:39.640]  the case but it is hard hitting because we can dense everything down but I'll tell you
[08:39.640 --> 08:44.520]  before I get into Putin threatening on Friday to say hey we got nuclear weapons quit pushing
[08:44.520 --> 08:49.040]  us around regardless of what you think about Putin the West is overthrowing Ukraine and
[08:49.040 --> 08:52.400]  stirring stuff up over there and George Soros is right in the middle of it before we get
[08:52.400 --> 08:59.040]  into all the other news and the feds warned of imminent terror threat on US border while
[08:59.040 --> 09:04.920]  they have been ordered to open it up before we get into all that I want to tell you what's
[09:04.920 --> 09:12.920]  coming up in the next segment this is so important there have been a lot of articles on this
[09:12.920 --> 09:18.360]  in the last couple years so I sent John Bown and Leanne McAdoo two of our great investigative
[09:18.360 --> 09:25.120]  reporters out to Northern Central and Southern California this last week and they filed these
[09:25.120 --> 09:29.680]  reports on info wars nightly news Friday night and the next segment we're going to be covering
[09:29.680 --> 09:41.600]  this US inspector wanted reactor shut on quake fears and that was August 25th just I don't
[09:41.600 --> 09:46.400]  know five six days ago a nuclear a federal nuclear inspector urged US regulators to shut
[09:46.400 --> 09:50.040]  down a California nuclear power plant until tests showed its reactors could withstand
[09:50.040 --> 09:54.840]  shocks and nearby earthquake faults it's on a fault they're in Devil's Canyon in Southern
[09:54.840 --> 10:01.240]  California according to the Associated Press and others well see this just opens up this
[10:01.240 --> 10:07.960]  type of story is a Rosetta stone a decoder it's bigger than just this reactor built
[10:07.960 --> 10:14.240]  on a fault line with the 6.0 that just happened a week ago I guess yeah we could go day seven
[10:14.240 --> 10:21.520]  days ago last Sunday this is a big deal because it goes to the mindset of building six reactors
[10:21.520 --> 10:28.760]  at Fukushima on a fault line and in a tsunami zone and when they built it 40 years ago 37
[10:28.760 --> 10:32.280]  years ago people said you're crazy don't do that I said oh shut up your anti nuclear
[10:32.280 --> 10:39.000]  power no I'm anti glow in the dark nuclear power be fine if these companies cared like
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.600]  general electric you know the mafia group that's paying to have power plants shut down
[10:43.600 --> 10:47.200]  that they don't own but they get a waiver from Obama and increase their profits so your
[10:47.200 --> 10:52.320]  power prices explode that's what those whole UN things about Congress wouldn't pass a
[10:52.320 --> 10:55.960]  lot of shut down the rest of them because everybody else gets to have them China Mexico
[10:55.960 --> 11:01.440]  you name it the dirty ones not the clean ones you know how big that is but I digress
[11:01.440 --> 11:05.760]  I mean I'd rather have carbon dioxide that plants breathe in water vapor it's all that
[11:05.760 --> 11:13.480]  comes out of them now versus nuclear reactors but this goes to the point of what type of
[11:13.480 --> 11:20.800]  elite builds 400 and something reactors around the world most of them in earthquake zones
[11:20.800 --> 11:27.440]  there's five reactors in California on or beside zones that if there's an 8.0 or higher
[11:27.440 --> 11:31.720]  are going to melt down ladies and gentlemen and their answer is just say oh it didn't
[11:31.720 --> 11:37.240]  melt down it's not a problem here's a new report out scientists drastically underestimated
[11:37.240 --> 11:43.240]  amount of Fukushima radiation worldwide and that's come out in the Associated Press and
[11:43.240 --> 11:54.320]  other publications CZM 137 levels in 2010 0.0000001 MBQ mecharelles or whatever you
[11:54.320 --> 12:03.120]  call it blue rating CS 137 I don't know all this physics stuff now the levels of it have
[12:03.120 --> 12:11.440]  increased 1 million to 10 million times after Fukushima give you the sources of all this
[12:11.440 --> 12:16.080]  the articles up on info wars dot com I mean this is just insane and their answers all
[12:16.080 --> 12:21.000]  radiation is not bad for anymore just like they would let our troops use DU until 1990
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.440]  they had it since the 50s and they said you know what just use it and now they're using
[12:26.440 --> 12:31.520]  it at government shooting ranges all over the place I mean it's crazy town it's crazy
[12:31.520 --> 12:39.600]  town this is the type of stuff that is going on it is so incredibly frustrating look at
[12:39.600 --> 12:44.080]  this is from the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology published by the American
[12:44.080 --> 12:53.440]  Chemical Society last year on Fukushima 10 million times that's just one of the isotopes
[12:53.440 --> 12:58.360]  I there's a whole bunch there I don't have time to read it would take two hours literally
[12:58.360 --> 13:02.240]  the EPA came out so we'll just raise the level and say it's safe and they covered up the
[13:02.240 --> 13:08.280]  fish full of it again it's suicidal it's a bunch of crazy greedy nihilists who don't
[13:08.280 --> 13:15.200]  care about anything anymore and now they went in when Ukraine six months ago voted to not
[13:15.200 --> 13:22.840]  join the EU and be sucked dry like Spain and Greece and Ireland and England by these globalist
[13:22.840 --> 13:26.160]  where they grab your private bank accounts all the rest of it hey join the EU we take
[13:26.160 --> 13:30.840]  part of your bank account give it to billionaires bail ins they've now been rolling weapons
[13:30.840 --> 13:34.800]  in they have the CIA director over there with mercenaries they're attacking Russian held
[13:34.800 --> 13:40.960]  oil fields and gas fields and industrial complexes they built in Ukraine over the last 60 years
[13:40.960 --> 13:45.600]  that they own they have contracts with Europe for the gas and they're trying to take those
[13:45.600 --> 13:52.640]  right now so of course the Russians have special forces in their fighting and then Putin's
[13:52.640 --> 13:57.480]  now escalating saying all right we got nuclear weapons knock it off NATO because NATO's moving
[13:57.480 --> 14:02.920]  weapons back in and again it's not that Putin's an angel but he's not the one opening our
[14:02.920 --> 14:10.680]  borders he's not the one funding ISIS like Obama he's not the one doing all of this Russia
[14:10.680 --> 14:18.120]  is not an offensive posture you know who is China they're running around buying up the
[14:18.120 --> 14:22.160]  rare earth minerals buying up the oil and gas buying off the politicians telling our
[14:22.160 --> 14:27.760]  media what they can report and I'm not a anti-Chinese government I'm anti-communist they got mobile
[14:27.760 --> 14:35.760]  execution vans they got massive public exterminations Putin doesn't have that why Putin might spy
[14:35.760 --> 14:40.960]  on people look what our government does the point is is that the globalists are the ones
[14:40.960 --> 14:46.880]  running our country into the ground and now the West was some of the best about running
[14:46.880 --> 14:51.280]  reactors properly and stuff we're so corrupt now in the West we should be some of the most
[14:51.280 --> 14:57.440]  upright people on average we've gotten so decadent our political elite they don't care
[14:57.440 --> 15:02.720]  about reactors leaking you know you can look up the studies over 90% of reactors worldwide
[15:02.720 --> 15:07.480]  are leaking leaking bad and they don't care so coming up the next segment we've got a
[15:07.480 --> 15:11.360]  report talking to people on the street about this and bringing up these news articles people
[15:11.360 --> 15:15.240]  to try to draw attention to this you know earlier this year I sent Jakari Jackson and
[15:15.240 --> 15:21.640]  some reporters out to I guess who else we send it Don Salazar and others out there to go
[15:21.640 --> 15:27.440]  with Geiger counters and field meters three different brand new calibrated units and to
[15:27.440 --> 15:34.360]  get levels in some cases 15 times safe levels all up and down California from northern to
[15:34.360 --> 15:40.000]  southern and they're out there again getting readings and again it isn't even about the
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.280]  radiation it's about an elite that don't care see they don't care about certain nuclear
[15:44.280 --> 15:49.440]  war with Russia and that's where all these top analysts say this could go if we're not
[15:49.440 --> 15:55.480]  worried about this it could end up happening this is the type of attitude that ends up
[15:55.480 --> 16:03.680]  getting us all dead dead dead we'll be back open your eyes it's time to give your eyes

[20:55.480 --> 20:58.920]  info wars dot com right now these articles from thursday and friday but i want to go
[20:58.920 --> 21:02.600]  over them with paul Watson those are linked up there please spread the word about the
[21:02.600 --> 21:07.640]  broadcast of friends and family that's how we reach 20 million people a week on average
[21:07.640 --> 21:13.240]  is a very conservative number more like 20 million a week on youtube alone but we know
[21:13.240 --> 21:18.600]  on am and fm stations it's more than 10 million a week and then internet's more than 10 million
[21:18.600 --> 21:22.760]  600 000 a day on the podcast a lot of that's a conservative number and i'm not bragging
[21:22.760 --> 21:30.280]  i'm giving you the good news that liberty is popular that liberty is cool and we're reaching
[21:30.280 --> 21:34.600]  more people we could legalize freedom like ron paul said just keep telling friends and family
[21:34.600 --> 21:39.320]  your email list your facebook or twitter about info wars dot com and these groundbreaking
[21:39.320 --> 21:45.720]  incredibly important reports we can draw attention to this just like we did earlier in the year we
[21:45.720 --> 21:50.200]  went out showed the higher radiation levels it made the navy come out they admitted it
[21:50.200 --> 21:55.560]  drew attention now they're sitting investigations and more all up and down the west coast not
[21:55.560 --> 22:01.080]  just california and we were in the newspapers the san francisco chronicles san josey mercury news
[22:02.200 --> 22:07.640]  they all said because info wars dot com did these reports well we're back out in california
[22:07.640 --> 22:13.480]  right now drawing attention you can do that as well michael peck released a report to the
[22:13.480 --> 22:20.360]  nuclear regulatory commission in 2013 and according to that report there are three fault lines nearby
[22:20.360 --> 22:25.960]  this power plant that would cause enough motion that it would bypass this particular plants
[22:25.960 --> 22:31.560]  shut down safety precautions that means something very similar to what happened in fukushima everyone
[22:31.560 --> 22:36.520]  thought that that plant was very well constructed could withstand large tsunamis but again that was
[22:36.520 --> 22:42.920]  not the fact experts would have us just bury our heads in the sand but some are already preparing
[22:42.920 --> 22:50.280]  for the inevitability of america's fukushima if diablo blows nobody's staying around to use i've
[22:50.280 --> 22:58.280]  actually got backpacks in my car you know for heading out preparedness i think is very important
[22:58.280 --> 23:02.760]  yeah but the whole idea that they're going to sound the sirens and we're all going to head north
[23:02.760 --> 23:10.040]  it just won't work yeah northeast so i wish it wasn't there but it is and maybe they'll
[23:10.040 --> 23:15.320]  deactivate it and that would be fine with me yeah absolutely i think it's great how the
[23:15.320 --> 23:20.520]  citizens on our own can be prepared um yet you know we're asking our government basically to
[23:20.520 --> 23:25.880]  take care of us and they're you know telling us to look the other way and how can you do that when
[23:25.880 --> 23:30.920]  all of this is at risk well it always comes in the limelight once there's an earthquake
[23:30.920 --> 23:35.640]  so the snap earthquake has made everybody kind of think about it again you know that a good
[23:35.640 --> 23:40.920]  earthquake would cause the plant to blow and uh would want to get out of here when you look around
[23:40.920 --> 23:45.960]  and you see all of this beauty all these families all these people how does that make you feel knowing
[23:45.960 --> 23:51.880]  that they're okay with a potential fukushima situation here in america we know we know we
[23:51.880 --> 23:59.640]  couldn't all get out you know they say head north i mean yeah head east northeast once the plant
[23:59.640 --> 24:06.200]  warns us um but you know that you couldn't do that the freeway would be jammed uh that's why
[24:06.200 --> 24:09.640]  you know we know we could go across the san america river bed and head south
[24:11.560 --> 24:15.640]  i raised seven children in this town and i taught them all to run home no matter what the school
[24:15.640 --> 24:20.200]  told them because we were going to hop in the car and get out somehow they weren't going to wait for
[24:20.200 --> 24:26.520]  school buses but yeah it's a big problem they say we provide 20 percent of california's power
[24:26.520 --> 24:32.280]  at that plant but i think they named it diablo for a reason should this plant be shut down until
[24:32.280 --> 24:39.400]  they can prove that it's not going to annihilate this entire town if not the entire state of california
[24:39.400 --> 24:45.480]  reporting for info wars dot com i'm lienne macadoo
[24:45.480 --> 24:57.160]  nuclear core reactors that are just right over in that canyon are some of the most dangerous in
[24:57.160 --> 25:02.040]  this country they're right on a whole bunch of fault lines and an inspector that works there is
[25:02.040 --> 25:07.400]  trying to get it shut down because he said at any minute it could be fukushima here in america
[25:07.400 --> 25:14.760]  wow that that's outstanding if i had known this i would have never come here to take a swim
[25:16.680 --> 25:21.320]  i don't know what to say no that's great worthless worthless no that's perfect because that's what i
[25:21.320 --> 25:28.440]  think when did they realize of this fact well the gentleman has been working for the last five years
[25:28.440 --> 25:35.000]  he's been an inspector there and um he had a report come out in 2012 that just basically
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.440]  spelled all of this out but they're hiding this report kind of and saying oh it's fine we've checked
[25:40.440 --> 25:46.840]  it all out and he's saying it's not fine it's built on sand it will move when an earthquake comes and
[25:47.480 --> 25:51.320]  um just because america does that they they're like it's fine
[25:53.000 --> 26:01.240]  yeah can you imagine this beautiful place being covered in plumes of death
[26:01.240 --> 26:07.240]  actually i could be very disappointed because uh there's so many animals you know and this is
[26:07.240 --> 26:13.880]  surrounded by nature and the atmosphere is great in here actually we came for surfing and uh it could
[26:13.880 --> 26:23.480]  be uh very dangerous um issue for all all the people that live here in the coast and uh
[26:24.440 --> 26:28.920]  all the ecosystem yeah they already had to shut it down two years ago because it had a leak
[26:28.920 --> 26:41.560]  here oh yeah so happy swimming thank you thank you okay so with if if california's fukushima
[26:41.560 --> 26:47.640]  goes off if diablo canyon erupts it's not necessarily going to kill everyone but it's
[26:47.640 --> 26:54.440]  definitely going to give people tumors and cancers and kill everybody's food for a long while you've
[26:54.440 --> 26:59.480]  been saying that the big earthquake is what you're talking about aren't you what they say that is
[26:59.480 --> 27:03.960]  going to happen is it's going to destroy all of california bring everything down so therefore it
[27:03.960 --> 27:11.800]  would kill everybody most likely and if everything does happen like that that'll that'll explode and
[27:11.800 --> 27:16.040]  every other power plant in california will explode so it's going to have a chain reaction
[27:17.240 --> 27:22.120]  so then wouldn't you say that it might be best to shut it down or do you think that's
[27:22.120 --> 27:27.400]  shutting it down wouldn't be a reasonable thing considering there's no power for people who need
[27:27.400 --> 27:33.480]  that power i mean what would happen what would they have to do to make it so that everyone
[27:33.480 --> 27:41.160]  else has power if they get power from that plant over there i would love to get into the debate
[27:41.160 --> 27:46.520]  about alternative energy because i oh i just wish they would do it but they can't because it's like
[27:46.520 --> 27:52.680]  25 of the state's power coming from there and they can't get that much energy out of the ocean why
[27:53.320 --> 27:58.680]  because they'd have to tear out the beach they have to put mills to get the ocean water to make
[27:58.680 --> 28:04.200]  them spin and they can't and then there would be no beach here so this wouldn't be a place to go
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.080]  so then they just build it right next to the beach and hope for the best they can't do that
[28:09.880 --> 28:15.480]  to get 25 of the state's power they would have to take out this whole beach and probably three or
[28:15.480 --> 28:25.720]  four more i think the oil is worse though yeah i agree well they're fracking out there
[28:26.520 --> 28:34.440]  huh they're fracking what's that mean they're like splintering the surface of the earth fracturing it
[28:34.440 --> 28:40.680]  and sucking out all the minerals by pumping it if there aren't any else filled with well you can't
[28:40.680 --> 28:47.000]  see them usually you can yeah if you go down to LA you see them you look out there and you see these
[28:47.000 --> 28:52.680]  big giant buildings again groundbreaking reports great job leon macadoo and john bound and great
[28:52.680 --> 28:57.480]  job with the sunday crew and here working hard we'll be right back with paul joseph Watson from one day

[33:56.120 --> 34:03.560]  right there listen to that guitar oh man

[34:09.480 --> 34:16.440]  uh that guitar right there smoke on the water fire in the sky yeah we'll be seeing some of that
[34:16.440 --> 34:23.880]  other's nuclear war with russia let's hope cooler minds prevail all right we wrote two articles
[34:23.880 --> 34:28.760]  last week i guess on thursday and friday i mean i came up with some of the ideas paul did most of
[34:28.760 --> 34:35.880]  the work at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and i've had them reposted together uh to the
[34:35.880 --> 34:41.400]  front page of info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and i'm going to retweet them out as well
[34:41.400 --> 34:46.760]  at real alex jones because anybody disagreeing with you saying there's no such thing as a conspiracy
[34:46.760 --> 34:51.640]  theory there's no such thing as government or big groups doing bad things that's just asinine
[34:51.640 --> 34:59.720]  we know historically over and over again that powerful combines organized crime you name it get
[34:59.720 --> 35:05.400]  into corporations or government it could be small town boss hog type stuff it could be uh the gang
[35:05.400 --> 35:10.520]  of the you know the nazi mafia taking over germany the communist mafia taking over russia
[35:10.520 --> 35:16.200]  we know this happens all the time we know what tyranny is but back in the 60s and paul watson's
[35:16.200 --> 35:21.400]  written about this the cia came out this was declassified a few years ago and said hey anybody
[35:21.400 --> 35:25.800]  criticizes any corruption we just call them conspiracy theorist and we tell the mainstream
[35:25.800 --> 35:30.920]  media state run media to make fun of them so there's a lot of kooky stuff out there as well
[35:30.920 --> 35:38.920]  but just questioning is an american or pro-liberty value it's it's not bad to question and so the
[35:38.920 --> 35:45.240]  article uh again came out thursday 10 conspiracy theories that came true and then uh the second
[35:45.240 --> 35:51.480]  article on friday 10 more conspiracy theories that came true from a fascist coup d'etat to the fbi
[35:51.480 --> 35:56.760]  poisoning alcohol there's a lot of them 20 of them but what's really need to read is the comments
[35:56.760 --> 36:02.280]  thousands of them under each article where people bring up other confirmed i'm gonna say that again
[36:02.280 --> 36:07.240]  confirmed anybody could theorize and think the queen of england is uh you know made of cheese
[36:07.240 --> 36:10.600]  we all know that's not true but could you say the british government's been caught shipping
[36:10.600 --> 36:16.360]  narcotics yes that's been declassified and people said it at the time and got called conspiracy
[36:16.360 --> 36:20.600]  theorist show paul watson joins us in this segment the next and that little five minute
[36:20.600 --> 36:25.880]  no man's land at the start of the next hour paul watson you've got the floor already talked about
[36:25.880 --> 36:30.760]  some of these earlier but uh of the 20 what do you think's the most important um one of the most
[36:30.760 --> 36:36.440]  interesting ones alex is the first one in the second part of the series the business plot this
[36:36.440 --> 36:42.840]  fascist conspiracy to overthrow the u.s government which of course occurred back in the 1930s press
[36:42.840 --> 36:48.440]  got bought in all these heads of big banks and corporations like chase bank good year standard
[36:48.440 --> 36:54.920]  oil dupe on family they approached marine corps major general smidley butler with this plan to install
[36:54.920 --> 37:01.880]  a fascist dictatorship by force they expected him to oversee it uh within the army but he actually
[37:01.880 --> 37:07.560]  ended up blowing the whistle exposing the plot to the united states house of representative
[37:07.560 --> 37:12.120]  special committee on unamerican activities what's interesting about it though from this
[37:12.120 --> 37:18.760]  perspective is at the time the new york times said that it was quote a gigantic hoax that this
[37:18.760 --> 37:25.000]  plot ever existed turned out actually that the committee concluded that butler's allegations
[37:25.000 --> 37:31.400]  were credible so it was a very real plot but at the time the media dismissed it as a gigantic hoax
[37:31.400 --> 37:38.520]  as a conspiracy theory it really is incredible and that's just one of the points uh that you bring
[37:38.520 --> 37:46.120]  up uh the existence of the mafia uh that was uh called a conspiracy theory until the mid 50s
[37:46.120 --> 37:51.880]  because they were blackmailing some of the top fbi people that later came out that's in there the fbi
[37:51.880 --> 37:56.600]  poisoned alcohol during prohibition folks we're not demonizing just the fbi it's just these are
[37:56.600 --> 38:01.480]  well-known conspiracy theories that were reported at the time and denied as conspiracy theories
[38:02.360 --> 38:07.480]  paul the sky is blue they could call that a conspiracy theory but it's not two plus two
[38:07.480 --> 38:13.480]  does equal four what's interesting now alex is that the modern day the main modern day progenitor
[38:13.480 --> 38:20.520]  of conspiracy theories is the us government itself i mean look at mh 17 shoe now for days after the
[38:20.520 --> 38:26.440]  event they were asserting that it was shot down by russian back rebels failed to provide
[38:26.440 --> 38:32.680]  any hard evidence whatsoever and in fact we called for the release of the air traffic control tapes
[38:32.680 --> 38:39.720]  now five six weeks later they are non-existent so time and again with these major events that
[38:39.720 --> 38:45.960]  go to you know prolonged wars actors cast as bellies for wars for military expansion the
[38:45.960 --> 38:51.080]  governments are the one progeniting the conspiracy theories because they never back up their claims
[38:51.080 --> 38:57.800]  with hardcore evidence and you can go back to incubator babies you know in iraq and weapons
[38:57.800 --> 39:03.880]  and mass destruction you can go back to northwards what's interesting from this perspective i mean
[39:03.880 --> 39:10.040]  we had a cast some steam come out obviously back in i think it was 2008 with this cognitive
[39:10.040 --> 39:17.720]  infiltration idea he proposed the need to have government agents infiltrate conspiracy theory
[39:17.720 --> 39:23.880]  forums and so forth in order to counter conspiracy theories about government corruption
[39:23.880 --> 39:30.120]  but even in that program he admitted that some conspiracy theories previously dismissed as insane
[39:30.120 --> 39:35.320]  and fringe have turned out to be entirely true and he gave the examples of the cia administering
[39:35.320 --> 39:41.080]  lsd in mind control experiments the dod plotting the commission of terrorist attacks inside the
[39:41.080 --> 39:46.040]  united states so even cast sunsteen from his perspective of trying to dampen down and quash
[39:46.040 --> 39:51.960]  conspiracy theories admitted that many of them are in fact true as we document in these articles
[39:52.680 --> 39:59.160]  let's continue there's 20 of them in the two-part article reposted info wars.com but again there's
[39:59.160 --> 40:03.560]  hundreds of other admitted conspiracies let's talk about some of the big ones that are on record
[40:03.560 --> 40:11.480]  the uss liberty is a big one because of course israel swore after they attacked this ship in 1967
[40:11.480 --> 40:16.840]  killing 34 crew members during the six-day war they swore that it was an error and that they
[40:16.840 --> 40:21.800]  had mistaken the ship for an egyptian vessel and of course both israeli and u.s government
[40:21.800 --> 40:30.040]  investigations accepted that version of events and it stood for decades but then in 2007 and you
[40:30.040 --> 40:34.600]  had a lot of these people on your show at the time the declassified government documents came out as
[40:34.600 --> 40:39.320]  well as the recollections of the former military personnel who were there at the time where the
[40:39.320 --> 40:46.120]  nsa had intercepted the communications from the israelis proving that the israelis knew they were
[40:46.120 --> 40:53.000]  attacking an american naval vessel so again another example of a conspiracy theory about israel
[40:53.000 --> 40:58.360]  knowing that this was a us vessel that was labeled debunked as a conspiracy theory for decades only
[40:58.360 --> 41:03.800]  came out really solidly of course we we'd had testimony before that but only actually confirmed
[41:03.800 --> 41:09.720]  in 2007 that they knew it was a us vessel that's right they had members of the jag officer corps
[41:10.280 --> 41:15.240]  the chairman of the joint chief of staff others went public as well as some of the israeli pilots
[41:15.240 --> 41:19.880]  it's now admitted it was a false flag to blame it on egypt that's just a fact governments all over
[41:19.880 --> 41:24.520]  the place do this our government's done it the russians have done it people need to stop being
[41:24.520 --> 41:30.680]  so naive government stage things to be able to blame their enemies period and that conspiracy
[41:30.680 --> 41:35.880]  theory has been proven true and it's linked in your article and then an even bigger one of course
[41:35.880 --> 41:42.600]  world war one the sinking of lucetania because germany put out an advisory before the lucetania
[41:42.600 --> 41:49.640]  sale warning that they would target ships which they knew contained munitions they named the lucetania
[41:49.640 --> 41:55.640]  they named the lucetania exactly and this this conspiracy theory as it was called at the time
[41:55.640 --> 42:02.440]  was only proved in 2008 when they actually the divers went down and discovered more than four
[42:02.440 --> 42:08.440]  million rounds of rifle ammunition hidden in cargo holds that were labeled you know cheese
[42:08.440 --> 42:13.400]  butter and oysters so that when they actually went down and searched the wreckage they found
[42:13.400 --> 42:19.160]  that yes indeed the lucetania was carrying all this munition all these weapons and that's why it
[42:19.160 --> 42:24.680]  was targeted by the germans of course that wasn't the story at the time the story was that this was
[42:24.680 --> 42:31.640]  an unprovoked attack and of course it was used to basically start world war one so again a major
[42:31.640 --> 42:38.280]  major incident that was labeled a conspiracy theory right up until 2008 when it was proven true
[42:38.280 --> 42:43.800]  that the lucetania was indeed carrying that as well so conspiracy theories that were proven true
[42:44.520 --> 42:49.400]  coming up now i'll tell you one conspiracy theory that isn't when we return on the other side
[42:49.400 --> 42:53.400]  because i'll tell you the real conspiracy theorist are on the other side we are not we're
[42:53.400 --> 42:57.320]  into fact here ladies and gentlemen and critical thinking which is more and more outlawed
[43:00.440 --> 43:05.000]  the government's department of homeland security is buying up loads of ammo at the same time
[43:05.000 --> 43:10.120]  the restricting civilians rights to own and purchase firearms can you put two and two together
[43:10.120 --> 43:16.280]  infidel body armor can stop every round including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds is reasonably

[47:31.000 --> 47:35.800]  paul watson joins us from other than england i come to you from deep in the heart of texas austin
[47:35.800 --> 47:43.240]  a beautiful wonderful city that my ancestors have been in for a long time now overrun by a
[47:43.240 --> 47:47.800]  socialist from california who are trying to ban guns and stuff not against californians i just
[47:47.800 --> 47:51.720]  you've already collapsed much of your beautiful state now you're here that doesn't matter it's
[47:51.720 --> 47:56.440]  what you do upside issue that's not a conspiracy theory that's my opinion what you're not allowed
[47:56.440 --> 48:00.120]  to have they call that a theory you're not allowed to have your own opinion that's what all this
[48:00.120 --> 48:07.080]  conspiracy theory labeling is about and that's linkedin paul's article in a my article in the
[48:07.080 --> 48:13.080]  second article dealing with the fact that the cia said call anyone questioning corruption
[48:14.040 --> 48:19.800]  a conspiracy theorist just a shut down debate basically like calling you a heretic now let
[48:19.800 --> 48:24.920]  me give you some real conspiracy theories that are total baloney in fact we should come out with
[48:24.920 --> 48:30.840]  an article next week paul on ten government conspiracy theories that were total bull and of
[48:30.840 --> 48:37.400]  course uh that would be al gore inventing the internet when the internet was invented by darpa
[48:37.400 --> 48:43.240]  back in the sixties inside the cia and government facilities universities that's on record too
[48:44.680 --> 48:50.200]  two plus two equals five in common core that is a total delusional conspiracy theory they teach
[48:50.200 --> 48:56.040]  kids that under common core to literally screw up their minds if you're a corrupt government
[48:56.040 --> 49:01.400]  that tells you that you didn't build your business and that raising the debt ceiling doesn't raise
[49:01.400 --> 49:07.640]  the debt as obama famously said well you know then you've got to teach people the two plus two
[49:07.640 --> 49:15.240]  equals five uh so there's some conspiracy theories that are total baloney uh carbon dioxide causes
[49:15.240 --> 49:20.360]  global warming all the major studies show that carbon dioxide goes up after warming because
[49:20.360 --> 49:24.920]  there's more life on the planet more plant life uh but that doesn't matter i mean ignore that just
[49:24.920 --> 49:30.760]  just call us that could be climate deniers uh paul Watson let's get into some of the other uh
[49:30.760 --> 49:35.480]  conspiracy theories that turned out to be true in the two articles that are on info wars.com
[49:36.680 --> 49:42.680]  yeah well obviously major one uses a casus belly for wall was the Gulf of Tonkin of course we
[49:42.680 --> 49:48.760]  were told that the USS Maddox was attacked by the north vietnamese never happened the attack never
[49:48.760 --> 49:55.800]  took place it was used to start the vietnam war and that whole disaster and then again in the 60s
[49:55.800 --> 50:03.560]  70s and 80s we had Operation Gladio which was where natos day behind teams carried out terrorist
[50:03.560 --> 50:10.440]  attacks to demonize leftist political groups in europe as terrorists so the main example would be
[50:10.440 --> 50:17.880]  the baloney train station bombing in 1980 which killed 85 people blamed on the red brigades eventually
[50:17.880 --> 50:23.320]  turned out that the italian secret service was responsible for the attack and of course again
[50:23.320 --> 50:29.080]  that was a conspiracy theory that gladio was about a nato false flag terror operation for decades
[50:29.080 --> 50:35.880]  until it came out in parliamentary investigations from eyewitnesses from whistleblowers that that
[50:35.880 --> 50:41.400]  was precisely what was taking place it was a state carrying out terrorist attacks to demonize
[50:41.400 --> 50:47.800]  political groups which were seen at the time as a threat to the power system um the glywits
[50:47.800 --> 50:54.920]  incident which we saw almost a replay of last week where russia accused ukraine of staging the
[50:54.920 --> 51:00.360]  incident where russia made the incursion with the so-called military convoy onto ukrainian
[51:00.360 --> 51:06.280]  territory ukraine claimed they destroyed the convoy russia came out immediately after and said
[51:06.280 --> 51:11.480]  that they could have even killed their own people just to stage this incident or it never happened
[51:11.480 --> 51:18.280]  at all and that's similar to the glywits incident in 1939 where nine days before the incident hitler
[51:18.280 --> 51:24.520]  said quote i will provide a propagandistic casus belly its credibility doesn't matter the victor
[51:24.520 --> 51:30.440]  will not be asked whether he told the truth and that was nine days before german operatives
[51:30.440 --> 51:38.120]  dressed in polish military uniforms seized this radio station near the polish border in germany
[51:38.120 --> 51:43.960]  beforehand broadcasting a propaganda message in polish to make it look as if the pols had carried
[51:43.960 --> 51:51.240]  out the attack the very next day germany invaded poland with hitler citing that very incident as
[51:51.240 --> 51:56.840]  one of its pretext so again many of these conspiracy theories that turned out to be true
[51:57.720 --> 52:03.960]  a major major incidents that lead to wars lead to invasions of foreign countries and of course
[52:03.960 --> 52:11.960]  glywits was part of the overall operation himmler is declassified is public and early on in world
[52:11.960 --> 52:18.440]  war two the nazis denied it and said that it was made up in a hoax that they had staged those events
[52:18.440 --> 52:25.160]  they even dressed up prisoners in polish uniforms and shot them to have dead bodies on the newsreels
[52:25.160 --> 52:30.280]  that people would go see movies and watch news before it before the age of television so this
[52:30.280 --> 52:36.440]  just goes on and on and on let's cover some more of the admitted conspiracy theories that
[52:36.440 --> 52:42.600]  turned out to be true white people claiming that was organized crime with the italians and imagine
[52:42.600 --> 52:48.440]  the fbi saying it didn't exist until the mid fifties i mean that's like saying again the atlantic
[52:48.440 --> 52:53.960]  ocean doesn't exist and we now know there's organized crime in every ethnic group imagine how
[52:53.960 --> 53:02.760]  naive the public was to believe the fbi that it didn't exist precisely and then there are a couple
[53:02.760 --> 53:08.280]  of more involved in fbi you mentioned at the top of the show the fbi poisoned alcohol during
[53:08.280 --> 53:13.160]  prohibition because of course it was virtually impossible to enforce these ridiculous laws
[53:13.800 --> 53:19.400]  so they attempted to do it in a way which basically killed people i mean there are all
[53:19.400 --> 53:23.880]  kinds of conspiracy theories so called by the media which are proven about the government
[53:23.880 --> 53:30.680]  meddling with food and water supply the environment back in the 1920s during prohibition the fbi
[53:30.680 --> 53:37.320]  enforced the law by deliberately poisoning alcohol with things like methane formaldehyde
[53:37.320 --> 53:44.680]  ammonia arsenic and kerosene they even added rubbing alcohol which is made of water and propene
[53:45.320 --> 53:51.320]  basically destroys your internal organs they also added paint thinner so an example of how
[53:51.320 --> 53:57.800]  the government deliberately poisoned people in order to enforce the law of course another one
[53:57.800 --> 54:04.760]  is the fbi crime lab cover-up this emerged back in the early 90s from dr. Frederick Whitehurst
[54:04.760 --> 54:12.840]  one of the fbi's top scientists and a whistleblower on how the fbi would deliberately manipulate
[54:12.840 --> 54:18.840]  crime lab data in order to sway trials and frame innocent people so there are hundreds or even
[54:18.840 --> 54:25.320]  thousands of people innocent but sent to jail as a result of this crime lab data being manipulated
[54:25.320 --> 54:30.600]  and then it only came out in 2012 that the justice department had been quote withholding
[54:30.600 --> 54:38.040]  information for years about these cases so again it was denied for almost two decades just like
[54:38.040 --> 54:42.760]  they denied giving people sephalus into skegee that's in there what about the clintons and the
[54:42.760 --> 54:48.040]  vast right wing conspiracy they've now released a few months ago as you have in the article from
[54:48.040 --> 54:53.640]  the clinton library that indeed they were working with the mainstream media to demonize anyone
[54:53.640 --> 54:58.040]  questioning corruption and they said in there because we don't want a new independent press
[54:58.040 --> 55:05.400]  to rise we have to discredit the idea of a citizen press precisely it was part of the war on new
[55:05.400 --> 55:10.600]  media which at the time of course was mainly centered around matt drudge and to a lesser
[55:10.600 --> 55:17.000]  extent world net daily but they had this deliberate policy hillary invented the pejority term vast
[55:17.000 --> 55:23.320]  right wing conspiracy to demonize the new new media is not being credible being kooky and they
[55:23.320 --> 55:27.960]  had a deliberate policy to stop these stories that were coming out from the likes of drudge
[55:27.960 --> 55:35.160]  from being picked up by the quo mainstream media so exactly it was a deliberate attempt to control
[55:35.160 --> 55:41.000]  the media via their operatives in the media just like operation mockingbird and by the way if folks
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.920]  simply go to info wars dot com right now you can read these articles follow the links to the clinton
[55:46.920 --> 55:51.640]  library documents we're not just saying this here like mainstream media does what they just make
[55:51.640 --> 55:56.680]  claims don't show proof we're showing you the proof what about geoengineering that's one we should
[55:56.680 --> 56:03.800]  end on paul yeah that's that's the final one in the second article of course for years throughout
[56:03.800 --> 56:08.760]  the nineties people were pointing to evidence of these geoengineering projects taking place of
[56:08.760 --> 56:14.600]  course linked to the phenomena of ken trails and atmospheric manipulation but we only actually
[56:14.600 --> 56:20.680]  really got the hardcore documents in the latter years of the previous decade around 2008 2009
[56:20.680 --> 56:27.880]  where the government is indeed conducting these large-scale indirect semi direct aerosol campaign
[56:28.440 --> 56:34.360]  spraying programs where they're basically spraying artificial chemicals in the air for tests on
[56:34.360 --> 56:39.000]  weather manipulation and so forth and they omit it in their own documents which are now public
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.720]  and on the internet before that it was a conspiracy theory that the government was manipulating the
[56:43.720 --> 56:48.520]  weather of course now we know that that's way way in advance of anything we ever knew about it's
[56:48.520 --> 56:54.840]  way in advance cloud seeding weather weapons which ben livixon was talking about in the 60s that's
[56:54.840 --> 56:58.040]  exactly and in closing we're gonna come back with five more minutes with you paul but
[56:58.760 --> 57:05.000]  the big problem is then they have total kooks out there that claim that every contrail is you know is
[57:05.000 --> 57:12.040]  a weather manipulation that then discredits all the real research and then folks don't look into
[57:12.040 --> 57:17.400]  what's admitted because it's not called chemtrails in the government documents it's called geoengineering
[57:17.400 --> 57:21.720]  basically terra farming and bill gates and others are involved follow the links to government
[57:21.720 --> 57:28.280]  documents and admissions at info wars dot com in ten conspiracy theories that came true when
[57:28.280 --> 57:33.160]  questioning the official narrative proves crucial and part two ten more conspiracy theories that
[57:33.160 --> 57:39.240]  came true from a fascist coup d'etat of the fbi poisoning alcohol it's all documented at prison

[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:17.800]  it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:26.280]  we are go i want to spend this little five minutes segment ahead of larry claiming coming on
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:32.040]  i want to spend this whole five minutes segment getting your take on it because i see you getting
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:37.960]  frustrated in your news videos your nightly news reports with the folks that don't do any research
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:43.560]  but just wildly throw out whatever conjecture is and then we get lumped in with those people
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.240]  but it's worse than that they then get mad at us when we don't agree with everything they're
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:53.720]  saying or doing i think we should all just question everything go off research go off
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:59.320]  what's been proven as accurate sources uh and and and historical perspectives humans do the
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:06.600]  same stuff over and over again i mean info wars is not really about theorizing 90 plus percent
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:11.640]  of what we do is just cover what's already known it's just so fantastical truth is stranger than
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.480]  fiction a lot of people can't deal with it uh but i mean what do you think about this whole term
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:20.760]  conspiracy theory because for me it just means someone who questions known liars within that
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.720]  compendium or that spectrum though of completely kooky stuff on one end and government propaganda
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:32.360]  on the other i see myself as in the middle a true moderate trying to discover the human experience
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:39.560]  what is truth i mean i think that's the great aspiration in life
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:46.040]  yeah people are poisoning the well from my perspective i mean i look at it from a perspective
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:51.800]  of motive like the isis beheading of james foley that clearly had a motive to justify military
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.280]  expansion in the middle east and the potential attack on syria which they couldn't get done last
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.680]  year because another of their conspiracy theories failed with the chemical weapons attack but i had
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:05.960]  a clear motive so i questioned it turned out we were proven right by the experts who analyzed
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:11.800]  it said it was staged that's the expert to the british government say it's fake exactly they
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.920]  work with the british police then you have something like you know the death of paul walker this is a
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:22.840]  hollywood actor who wasn't even political my problem with it is every time somebody in hollywood dies
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:27.480]  like robin williams or paul walker people immediately say oh he was assassinated by the
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.720]  illuminator sure well me you're talking about the schizophrenics that say that i'm jeff bridges
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:39.560]  and uh what's his name bill hicks yeah it's it's a noisy minority thankfully it's still a minority
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:43.400]  well really it's entertaining i mean i gotta be honest with you you know and you do it too i call
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.880]  him say what's the latest i don't do this anymore i swore it off five years ago i've really cut back
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:53.960]  we used to call up swapping the worst attack videos on us as entertainment uh but uh and
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:58.600]  you know the hater videos it's i'm repenting to god though that i love hater videos because it's
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:03.880]  just they're so sick and pathetic it was a form of narcissism that i was enjoying it uh but i mean
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:10.280]  it's amazing the phenomenon of schizophrenics now having access to youtube and all their
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:15.160]  fantastical stuff what must it be like for them though as all this real stuff goes on that must
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:20.360]  be really freaking them out well but that's precisely the frustration isn't it there's
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:25.960]  there are so many real cover-ups real conspiracies taking place right now and they're focusing on
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:31.080]  the death of some you know actor in hollywood but drove his car at high speed it's just doesn't
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:36.120]  interest me when there are so many real hardcore issues that you can dig into and remember we got
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:41.800]  blamed for paul walker uh saying that it was a missile when we when you had a video debunking it
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.240]  yeah i put debunked in the headline and people still say how dare you say this is a conspiracy
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:51.560]  because they don't watch the video that's the problem most of the time well part of it is the
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:57.880]  dumb-down nature i mean the public is so dumb-down i mean they just they are so dumb-down it is so
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:05.480]  sad paul it's it's sad but you know with the internet democratization of information we've
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:10.920]  got such a wide range of access to everything now that but then again we've got a lot of noise so
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:15.160]  it's about picking and choosing what's credible and what's not and i think that's the balance that
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.600]  we try sure and that's why they spend all day in the mainstream media and other places saying we're
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.400]  not credible well we're incredibly credible we're having a huge effect we're growing exponentially
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.720]  we try to tell the truth people know that and they know we're really looking for the truth looking
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.680]  for justice that's where we stand uh and we're not with the government conspiracy theorist or
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:38.920]  the poor mentally ill people out there uh it's just but look the government has lied so much
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:43.320]  i don't blame folks for believing nothing uh you know even stupid people know they're being lied to
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:47.320]  so they come up with stupid theories but at least they're trying to think paul watson thanks for the
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:53.000]  time great job with the articles thanks ellie we'll be back with larry claiming and we'll look at
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.760]  obama and his move to turn over the carbon taxes to the un outside of congress stay with us
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:06.680]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:11.320]  each and every day but it's not just the air outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:16.200]  have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most americans
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:22.040]  spend 90 of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42 million
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:27.720]  smokers in the united states well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:32.200]  and don't forget the fact that six million americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:37.720]  i began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:42.360]  order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:48.040]  made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the usa the new info wars life
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.680]  lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic

[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:11.000]  it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:27.640]  waging war on corruption crashing through the lies and disinformation thank you for
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:34.200]  joining us on this sunday the 31st day of august 2014 worldwide transmission
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:40.920]  we are now into our number two and we are going to be joined by dr michael kaufman i'll tell you
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:46.520]  about him in just a moment he's in several of our most powerful films like end game blueprint
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:53.480]  for global enslavement look at this headline obama looks to skip senate on new un climate deal
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:07:00.440]  the hill it should read obama becomes dictator bright bart mcconnell obama's congressional
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:08.360]  bypass with un treaty the serious damage to rule of law uh yes it does and now the new york times
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:12.440]  and others are giving him political cover saying it's no big deal to shut down more of our plants and
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:17.720]  put tracker boxes that just so happen to be in all the new cars in your car to tax you by the mile
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:24.040]  obama also announced last friday that he'll be signing an executive order in the next week
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:28.920]  to end deportations of illegals he's already opened the border up here's the associated press from
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:38.520]  friday obama plots bypass around congress on amnesty through executive fiat late i mean that's the ap
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:46.920]  this is bigger than obama even if you're a democrat this is about presidents becoming dictatorial
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:50.200]  and and sure they're elected but it's a special interest that put them in there
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:55.400]  so it's the bureaucracy and the whole thing doing whatever it wants to put our troops under
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:59.720]  un control remember he said that two years ago to the congress they said you gotta get authorization
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:06.680]  from us on syria no i don't i have the un i have nato that's worse than them being a dictator he's
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:13.000]  like a stooge of vice roye for these globalist corporate interest well the man who back in the
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.680]  early 90s put together with the un maps the master maps showing half the country off limits
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.320]  you can just type in dr michael kaufman un maps you'll see the global maps the us maps
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:28.280]  half the country in red off limits another quarter of it or so limited use less than 25
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:36.280]  percent open use this is agenda 21 that i've been covering since 1997 when i made the film america
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:41.880]  destroyed by design i'm not tooting my horn but you heard it here first i'm glad everybody else
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:47.720]  covers it now we have a chance to beat it the problem is now they shouldn't you know tell kaufman
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:53.320]  oh the un's not gonna try to take over oh there's no such thing now it's like oh yeah the un they
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:09:00.280]  told us what to do so dr michael kaufman joins us he received his bs in forestry and ms in biology
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:06.280]  and northwestern arizona university of flagstaff and his phd in forest science university of idaho
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:12.600]  he taught courses and conducted research in forest ecology and forest community dynamics for 10 years
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:18.360]  at michigan technological university a leading forestry school midwest he's the president of
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:23.800]  environmental perspectives ink he's written many books bestsellers about the attack on our
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:31.720]  constitution and more and his website is epi dash us dot com and you can buy his book at america
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:37.320]  plunder dot com we have this segment and the next to get into it i tell you dr michael kaufman
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:41.000]  people watch that film eight years ago in game that you're such a big part of
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.680]  love and it freaked people out at the time now it's all come true i'm told by filmmakers you name
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.800]  it that film is evergreen truly something i'm proud of that's why i talk about it so much
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.800]  even though i thought other films seem 50 40 million times this was only been seen probably
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:02.600]  20 million times for free online so that's a big victory uh the dvds 200 000 in stores i mean it's
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:07.560]  had a big effect but you're a big part of it uh we're now seeing global governance out in the open
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:13.480]  but not just that obama saying his authority comes from the un this is beyond constitutional crisis
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.240]  yes it is and it's really tragic but you and i have been discussing this for about 15 20 years
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:24.680]  now it's nothing new it's just finally starting to happen where people can see it it's almost
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:31.160]  impossible now for people not to see it and yet they continue to decide they're not going to pay
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:36.600]  any attention to it it's really unbelievable when you have a nation that has a risk as much as the
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:43.800]  united states is right now to have people out there just willing to be blind willing that you
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:48.600]  can't describe it any other way because it's right in their face willing to be blind is just
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.480]  beyond comprehension it's a state of delusion that i never thought i'd ever see in my lifetime
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:59.400]  it's as if the country is in a trance uh for folks that don't know they go oh what do you
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:04.120]  want to run things explain to people what they've already done in countries they've gotten control
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:11.880]  of well there has been plenty evidence to suggest that they have a program of ethnic cleansing
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:17.800]  not just a little bit to the tunes of tens of thousands of people in the past now they're not
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:23.720]  doing that right now at least i'm aware of but the fact is that they have no compunction whatsoever
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:31.480]  their whole ethics program and so forth is led by uh organizations that are literally blind
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:38.040]  to anything about talk about human ethics and so forth the and exactly the un promotes nambla
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:45.160]  they're a member of the un yes it is everything everything no matter what you look at they are
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:51.800]  a totally corrupt organization that does exactly the opposite of what most people in united states
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:57.800]  would want to have happened well even if they were good guys we don't need some foreign global group
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:05.240]  run by other countries uh carbon taxing us i mean imagine yes yes absolutely and that's a very good
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:11.000]  point because we have a system of government that has served us very well with very strong at least
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.560]  historically private property rights that's disappearing now that has given us the ability
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:22.600]  to become the wealthiest nation in human history and we are in the united nations has an exactly
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:27.240]  the opposite form of governance it's over most of you in the listening audience know what that means it
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:31.800]  means that the united nations will control everything it'll control every action and of course that's
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:39.240]  what agenda 21 is designed to do is to control every action that you and i and everyone else takes
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:45.480]  in this world it gets to tell us what we can and cannot do uh specifically on every particular
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:50.520]  issue that we want to there will be no such thing as private property rights with agenda 21 and that
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:57.240]  is one of the characteristics of agenda 21 that you have to know it totally destroys private
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:02.920]  property rights and private property rights have been studied and known to be the source of all
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:07.880]  wealth creation you cannot create wealth for yourself and your family without private property
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:13.880]  rights you cannot do it unless you're in in a position of graft and corruption and so forth
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:18.280]  within some sort of organization could be private it could be public doesn't matter
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:21.960]  but that's the only other way that you can legitimately create wealth is through private
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:28.920]  property rights and it's what's created prosperity and invention and innovation yes it's not even
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:35.720]  debatable but now we see collectivism and socialism pushed everywhere by the united nations and now our
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:42.280]  president i mean back when you helped you know testify to congress and beat this stuff back in
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:47.480]  the early 90s now they just say hey who needs congress that really shows who's running things it
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:54.200]  really shows how dictatorial this thing really is it's very bold i'm really worried if congress
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:14:00.520]  doesn't slap down obama and the bureaucracy that this is just a major precedent well you got one
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:04.280]  of the things that that we have to do and of course it's not going to happen in this election
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:09.400]  probably won't happen in 2016 either is that we have to get these people out of congress and our
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:14.920]  state legislatures even our county commissioners that are progressives these people are dangerous
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:19.400]  they're utterly dangerous and will destroy this nation if we allow them to continue
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:23.080]  to do what they're doing because everything that they think of and you can go back this is what
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:28.760]  about book plunder goes in the great detail is to describe how this group of people since the time
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:34.840]  of russo in france has systematically destroyed the countries in which it had power over and
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.240]  is doing it in europe today is doing it france especially because they're they're really over
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:46.360]  the hill and most of your nations like russia or the former soviet union china and so forth
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:52.280]  have followed followed this model of governance and have literally killed tens of millions of
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:58.200]  their own people because it's so barbaric when it gets down to exactly who has the power within
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:03.800]  that form of government it is and we're moving towards it very rapidly that's exactly where
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:12.600]  obama is taking us in fact the university of hawaii breaks down democide 262 million people in the
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:19.960]  20th century non-military combatants killed by governments 70 plus percent of it by communist
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:27.160]  the rest by hitler and and some other dictators but but communists killed 70 plus percent of
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:34.600]  262 million people that's almost the entire population of the united states and people

[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:51.160]  are occupied by this corporate monopoly capitalist system that uses socialism to control the grass
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:59.000]  roots or oligarchal collectivism you go back to the jackabins in france and the french revolution
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:04.600]  they were criminal plunders who wrote up the plan to carry this out and that's what dr michael
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:10.920]  kaufman is an expert on the writings and government documents he's dug up it's in in game 2.0 that was
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:15.960]  released only to prison planet dot tv it's it's it's there today all the documents about how they would
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:23.480]  promote homosexuality to to end the family and to break down society it's not that i'm against
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:28.920]  quote gay people or that i want to go hurt them or something it's that and that there's been people
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:34.760]  like that forever it's that the government is confusing genders on purpose it is a program
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:41.480]  and that's just one example uh there's so many that he covers in in game 2.0 that that people
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:48.280]  should go watch at prison planet dot tv uh dr michael kaufman we got about 10 minutes in this
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:55.080]  segment i want to speak some about what you were just getting into and then specifically about
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:22:01.560]  obama single sign on to a treaty without congress was just unprecedented but i talk about statistically
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:07.640]  honey bees you know kill 200 people a year but people aren't really afraid of them but
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:13.480]  statewide sharks kill five people a year uh worldwide it's a couple hundred honeybees get
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:17.720]  people get killed by those every year here in the u.s alone but then you got something like government
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:24.360]  well what is it 10 000 more people drowned a year or something but you don't see tsa up there with
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:30.200]  checkpoints to get in the lake but it kills a lot more than terrorists do my point is media decides
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:36.360]  what to hype up and what to be afraid of and statistically government is the number one unnatural
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:42.360]  form of death and it's collectivist governments that do it free market ones just pour out money in
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:50.440]  success and and and upward mobility and freedom the problem is then those societies become decadent
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:56.360]  and government by conquest government by corruption ends up setting in how do you educate a youth
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:02.040]  about this how do you stop a political class that just wants to expand their empire
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:09.400]  there how do you reverse this because more and more you can see they're not going to stop and
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:15.560]  they also hate anyone that's free market and anyone who's self-made there's also an instinct
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:21.640]  of these collectivist to not just take over but to then persecute those of us that are producers
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:27.080]  which then always hastens the collapse as well uh this is just like some time of type of mental
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:34.200]  illness dr michael kaufman it is in fact psychiatrists have been studies on this for over 100 years
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:38.600]  and i come to that very conclusion it's a psychological or pathological problem
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.720]  they cannot connect to reality they live in their own dream world and as a consequence the the
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:49.320]  policies that they formulate are totally wrong it's based on emotion not rationale now we need
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:55.160]  emotion in our lives i'm not saying that but you've got to make a decision first on reason and then
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:01.160]  temper it with emotion and all they do is do emotion they don't care about reason it could be
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:07.000]  outer space and they just they and they just they're disconnected from reality in in total
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:13.960]  this is what the studies have shown over 100 years now now how do we change this because they have
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:20.280]  penetrated our public school systems our congress it doesn't matter what what major institutions
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:27.960]  they basically have taken over those institutions in this country almost totally now not quite but
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:35.000]  almost totally with common core they're going to take over the education system totally and
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.400]  what we're seeing of course we have a lot of grassroots out there that are fighting this
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:44.200]  and gradually beating back common core and i think by this time next year we're going to be
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:50.040]  pleasantly pleased because these people i've done some in the common core but i'll have to admit
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:56.040]  these people really really have been effective in exposing the underbelly of of common core and
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:04.200]  how bad it truly is and hopefully by that process we will be able to gradually take back our
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:09.640]  educational system there have been textbooks that have been rejected now because of of revisionism
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:17.000]  and so forth of history and if we can begin to start training our kids while they're in elementary
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.720]  school and then while they're in college and so forth through the true foundational principles
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:27.320]  of a good liberal education then i think we can begin to take it but it's going to take decades
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:32.840]  to do that we have a problem right now can we even survive the next two years of obama that's the
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:39.720]  question and the only way that i can see that we could perhaps stop this is if we've elected people
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:44.600]  in congress in the senate state legislatures are already all the way down to your local level
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:51.160]  that have some degree of reason behind them they're not often as pie and sky stuff that progressives
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:59.160]  really get involved in and i don't see that happening because they have such a huge propaganda
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:06.280]  machine however programs like you and others around the country and so forth are gradually
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:12.920]  making people aware of how bad this is it's just a matter of timing can we do it especially by the
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:21.000]  2016 election well it's like michael savages properly said and i know he's researched but there
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.400]  are major psychological studies on the mind of communists or socialists and they really are
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:30.840]  mentally ill they are that is the camp follower though the higher up ones know it's just a program
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:37.320]  of criminality our biggest problem is the republican leadership uh he is bought and sold by the very
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:43.080]  same corporate interests they're using collectivism as a model where is bainer on obama about to sign
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:50.680]  executive orders to legalize all the illegals where is bainer uh where are all these people
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:57.320]  uh on obama saying he'll just sign an order carbon taxing everybody and then the dot is coming out
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:01.880]  saying oh yeah there's a little tracker boxes in your car we're going to start taxing you
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:07.640]  i mean everything we warn people about an end game you talk about that the film is now here and and
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:13.160]  so they've gone from denial to just doing it why do you think they're doing that is it because
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:18.040]  they're behind schedule or they just don't care i mean used to they would try to cover this stuff
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:25.880]  up now they just do it one of the things that i'm very concerned about alex and i know you are too
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:29.240]  is that they're getting very close to the point where they're pulling the plug
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:35.320]  and there's going to be well obviously we are economically bankrupt in this country as it is
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:41.800]  right now it would take very little to put us in a real tailspin and i think that's what they're
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:46.360]  planning on doing and they don't care anymore they literally don't care we see a president
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:51.640]  that just doesn't care he'll go off golfing when the world is burning around him because he knows
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:56.520]  everything is going to come crashing down shutting down a third of the cost of the
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:02.440]  cold power plants doubling energy prices will put us into a total depression and they know it

[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:19.960]  it's destroying europe right now and and the socialists here in this country the socialists
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:23.720]  still in europe they don't care they still want to do the same program
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:27.320]  they're convinced that green energy is going to work i don't know how they're going to do it
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:33.240]  wave a magic wand or whatever because it never could work i mean we forecast way in advance

[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:18.600]  to get larry on a few days ago it was going to be about his investigation of lowest learner and
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:23.960]  what's really happening with the irs persecution but now we've got obama saying he'll sign an order
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:29.960]  legalizing the illegals and stopping any deportations they've pretty much already done that uh and
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:35.400]  then he'll put us under u n control with carbon taxes without congress this is official dictator

[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.880]  like i'm in the twilight zone and i'm somebody who's been accused of you know going too far so many
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:12.280]  times now people say wow it's all true and worse larry what's the next shoe to drop i mean i want
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:16.360]  to get into all the stuff that's happening but it just seems like the bottom's dropped out we've
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:21.400]  reached that point like with hitler or stalin where they've gotten away with everything so why not go
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:26.600]  to the moon i mean why not go a trillion miles if they've already taken us this far how far will they
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:35.560]  go well it's quite clear that they meaning obama and his comrades literally speaking uh we'll do
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:41.000]  whatever they can they have a certain period of time left in office until we get artillery probably
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.360]  in the next eight years after that which will finish the country off she's elected uh but they're
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:52.200]  going to take it to the max and you know everybody tries to make excuses for obama particularly
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:57.080]  the republicans they're trying to be always incompetent he's not well informed doesn't
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:01.480]  know what he's doing you know that's ridiculous and the only reason they say that is that they're
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:06.680]  being they're afraid of being accused of being racist they actually criticize the guy for his
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:11.800]  ideology all of a sudden from the left you're racist so they have to couch it we have to call
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:17.800]  it as it is and you've done that while i admire you is that you know somebody's got to speak out
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:22.280]  and the fact that you're speaking from your heart and what you believe to be true doesn't mean that
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:28.040]  just because you're criticizing an african-american president that you're a racist so that's where it
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:32.280]  comes from initially this this guy would have been long going if he was not african-american
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:37.880]  he would not be in office by now even as bad as he is and as bad as the the electorate is that
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:43.560]  put him in there because he's committed one scandal after another he's lied to the american people
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:48.840]  he's trashed the constitution with executive orders and everything else and now the world is
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:56.760]  imploding over his foreign policy which is not based on a lack of knowledge but i believe it's
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:04.760]  calculated to further a muslim caliphate he feels kinship with these people and that helps explain
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:10.840]  why you know we did an interview about extortion 17 afghanistan why are best and brightest maybe
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:17.720]  fielding six can't fire on you know muslim insurgents before they're fired upon first i mean
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:22.520]  my god look at the israelis if there was a mosque operative in an apartment building they blew the
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:27.880]  whole thing up you know and who elected him off it was the people of god that you got to pay the
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:32.440]  price for putting them in power but we're not willing to do any of that stuff and the world's
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:36.600]  falling apart from russia and ukraine well regardless of why he's doing and he is turning
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:44.520]  loose the most radical vicious caliphate wahhabist nutballs all over the world uh with ben gazi
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:51.160]  helped give them weapons helped use them against syria and it is so diabolical to see them going
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:56.520]  for broke and then they get away with persecuting everyone a thousand times what nixon did with
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:01.480]  the irs i know you've been focusing in on that as well yeah before i get to that i'll make one
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:07.960]  point here which is important is that we should not just be critical of obama and his leftist
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:13.640]  tax but also the republican party the republican leadership because all of a sudden the republic
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:19.080]  has learned about isaac there are key republicans like mike rogers that is chairman of the
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:26.280]  intelligence committee like uh john mccain is the powerful u.s senator quote unquote like lindsay
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:33.240]  grant another senator like uh representative peter king where were they why weren't they
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:38.680]  telling us about i you know and so the whole government has broken down and on top of it
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:43.880]  sits in nsa and cia despise on it with the heart content and the irs is part of this
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:51.160]  that's the segue now is that the intimidation of conservative groups auditing of them uh
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:57.880]  harassment of them uh is not new but it's part of an entire process that the government is using
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:03.400]  to keep dissent down to keep people from complaining to keep them from taking action
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:07.640]  against the government's legal action scare them the point you can't even use your telephone
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:13.000]  anymore and of course the irs is an agency that characteristically has been used not just in
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.560]  this country but ministries the finance all countries to destroy political adversaries
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:23.080]  particularly russia china and other places so we live in a
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:26.920]  orwellian state as the judge said in our state case when we got an injunction
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:34.440]  in december uh there's a state of tyranny that we live in and frankly uh we're not far away from
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.720]  a violent revolution which i i i'm doing my best to try to prevent i i god forbid that
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.200]  happens but i do believe that will happen well clearly they want to bring in tens of millions
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:49.640]  of illegals to be wedded to the democratic party for free goodies and then make it a racial issue
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:55.160]  if you don't want totally open borders and to have obama and jerry brown saying it's our
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:40:01.320]  responsibility to pay for the children of the world when only 17 of those coming in are children
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:07.160]  and then meanwhile uh in texas they're reporting on an imminent terror threat uh judicial watch
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:12.760]  that you founded a feds bulletin describes threat of imminent terrorist attack on southern border
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:20.440]  well yeah they report thousands of others than mexicans as they call it pouring in from the
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:27.080]  middle east with all sorts of isis memorabilia and and segments isis is showing up at the
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:32.920]  white house they're showing up in ferguson i've been sent threats by these groups i mean this is
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:39.880]  like rock star uh with the left a lot of leftists who aren't even islamicists uh are like really
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:44.520]  like what's going on and i used to think when i would hear you and others because i respect you a
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:49.080]  lot but say you know obama's secretly this and that and he's planning this i was like oh come on
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:54.120]  but when we learn his cousin in kenya is sending money up to the muslim brotherhood to overthrow
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:59.080]  the egyptian government and then they're blowing up all these churches and crucifying christians and
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:03.880]  our media is defending it singing and defending it uh and then you catch obama trying to overthrow
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:09.160]  a sod to put al qaeda in and you and you see these are going man well i mean it looks like a duck if
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:17.960]  it lacks like a duck how i mean is the islamic radical movement a fifth column for the liberals
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:25.880]  alex unless we do something we're ducked right yes right so look yesterday i mean give you an example
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:32.200]  we follow a lawsuit i filed it my own name with john doe plaintiff okay to protect the
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:39.560]  matter of security and how people to come i brought a lawsuit against president obama against secretary
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:44.840]  of state john carrey former secretary of state hillary clinton and the un secretary general
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:50.200]  something moved whatever his name is and what they've been doing and this is israel and it tells
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:55.320]  you the way this whole thing's operating is that we have given hundreds of millions of dollars in the
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:04.200]  month out of slush the state department for so-called humanitarian purposes and just a few days ago when
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:10.840]  the israelis took out the chief financial officer of the month and bombed his car they found a
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:17.080]  boatload of american dollars in their car obama knows what he's doing and he's giving this money
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:22.840]  in the month uh to further their terrorist activity along with sure that's on record
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:28.600]  right and and that's important now why is that important as well because you know that's in yahu
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:34.920]  basically just sold out in israel it's really it's really bad well larry stay there we're
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:40.200]  going to come back and have you break this down in another segment with larry claimant and we're
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:45.320]  going to talk about where he sees the future of this country going because i don't have words to
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:51.000]  describe how dire our straits are right now and regardless what you think about israel
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:58.520]  why does hamas fire the rockets why do they attack why what is the point of that we'll be back
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:04.920]  i began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much

[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:49.800]  that really has a score to settle with the free market in america they want to rule this country
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:56.120]  they want clowered and piven to wreck it so they can run it and pose as the saviors larry you were
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:48:03.400]  getting into hundreds of millions of dollars being sent to hamas and then hamas launching
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:08.280]  attacks on israel and then israel looks like the bully and there was superior weapons bombing
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:15.480]  you know the the uh the combatants but just looking at it coldly not emotionally what is
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:24.040]  the point of hamas attacking uh israel knowing they're going to lose a and b it is a leftist
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:28.920]  cause celeb at the u n everywhere else i have leftist call me all the time and they say are
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:33.000]  you upset about dead palestinian kids ago yeah i am i don't like seeing dead children this is
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:39.160]  terrible are you absurd you care about 300 000 dead syrians mainly christians killed by al-qaeda
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:46.200]  being backed by obama and john carry and they just shut up you work for israel i mean who's
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:51.480]  going to speak up for the christians it's like it's like it's just all the left will talk about
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:56.840]  is hamas and israel as if that's the only thing on the planet larry claiming well then the left
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:03.480]  doesn't like uh moses or jesus anymore than it likes moses okay the fact is you know israel's
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:09.320]  land of christians and jews the fact is christians have been killed in israel by hamas the fact is
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:14.120]  this president is supporting his brothers his muslim brothers in the middle east and he's
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.800]  funneling money and you're going to see more of it now under the pretext of now we've got to
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:24.600]  rebuild gaza this money is being used against christian and jewish interest and american interest
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:30.520]  and obama's furthering it my father lost it yesterday he can find it at freedomwatchusa.org
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:36.120]  and we charged obama and clinton and carry and the unsecretary general of criminal racketeering
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:42.040]  in a civil context so you know we're making a point here uh and this president is simply not
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:47.640]  patriotic to this country he does not care about this country it's not a question of playing golf
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:53.400]  he wants to dismantle this country he wants us to pay reparations for past discrimination granted
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:58.840]  that was bad that needed to be rectified but he believes there's time to pay back his people
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:05.720]  and his people include african-americans and muslims and everybody else can go be damned and i hate
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:11.400]  to say it that straight up alex but someone's got to start saying it you know uh i'm a civil
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:18.680]  rights lawyer okay i'm i'm a jewish christian okay i understand what discrimination is terrible
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:24.360]  you know our people were enslaved back with the pyramids but doesn't mean you destroy the
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:28.840]  country because you're gonna have to do a payback and and that's what this guy's doing well look
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:34.840]  at how al qaeda and isis is killing the moderate muslims all over the middle east where is the
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:40.920]  left on that that's all i'm saying is that i'm sad 2000 palestinians died and all this but i wasn't
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:47.480]  part of it you know what i'm sad too but the reality is the palestinians elected hamas and god
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:54.040]  and they elected a terrorist organization and as a result of that they have to take responsibility
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:59.480]  for doing that and that's their problem they can get him off out of there they can have to vote them
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:04.280]  in and they've got just like we have to bear responsibility for obama and what he's done
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:08.920]  maybe we're gonna have to make a mess to the rest of the world sure i mean i get what you're
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:15.000]  saying but but they'll never talk about hundreds of thousands of christians being slaughtered by
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:20.360]  people of course not what when did you ever hear obama talk about that maybe once or twice
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:26.120]  in passing in six years the man doesn't consider himself a christian the man has an
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:31.800]  antipathy towards christians there's this pastor in iran has been rotting in in iman prison now for
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:38.040]  years uh he's just one of many uh you know read this complaint because we documented in detail
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:44.600]  that obama is in terms of what he feels in his heart and the way he acts totally muslim even
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:51.240]  though he's only one half muslim by birth he was raised in muslim school he is praising a
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:55.640]  terrorist organization like the islamic society north america repeatedly he wears a ring that
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:52:02.760]  says my only god is a la you know by the way that's really true it's on record i i but i always
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:07.000]  thought that was to manipulate muslims to follow him or something i tell you this is really getting
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:12.520]  weird uh look i we got to get you back for a full hour we can do it soon we love to alex
[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:18.920]  we need to tell it like it is we can't be parsing it anymore we just can't let me just briefly get
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:24.120]  this out there though you're on the forefront of exposing the irs from day one will anybody get
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:28.680]  in trouble for that as it's proven they destroyed the evidence lowest learner the rest of them well
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:32.920]  we're working on those i might say judicial watch is my former group i have run freedom
[01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:38.120]  watch now i found a judicial watch and they were the ones that uncovered those emails and i
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:42.760]  applaud them for doing that you know and one quick point alex why couldn't the government reform an
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:47.560]  oversight committee with their subpoena power and they can also file for it get those documents why
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:53.320]  does judicial watch have to do that uh it tells you that we don't have a republican party that's
[01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:58.440]  for real up there i mean they're good on getting on fox news that's about it and it's time for the
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:02.840]  american people to rise up and do it for themselves because our country as you pointed out hanging
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:09.240]  by a thread uh it's it's beyond imagination why are these elites doing this when america's wealth
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:15.640]  and freedom made them so fabulously rich why would they want to shut off our power plants open our
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:22.760]  borders bankrupt everything i just want a bunch of nasty nasty people well look there in washington
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:27.160]  dc there's no recession in washington it's you know i live there for 20 years i still go back
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:33.480]  there a lot uh it's been at least a third of you know half of my time there uh the fact is there's
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:37.800]  so much money to divide up they're cutting up the pie the democrats and the republicans so why rock
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:43.640]  the boat we just get fat and happy and rich and the american people be damped you know louis the
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:49.560]  16th after a while a division speak french after me the flood and that's what's happened because
[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:54.920]  they don't care what's going to happen to these countries to them it's it's the power game and
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:59.880]  you know even the peter kings of this world who think it's fine for the nsa to get into all of our
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:04.360]  underwear so to speak you know our phone records our internet and everything else
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:08.600]  this is so they can remain in power and the rest of the country you know just go to hell
[01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:15.720]  we're in charge and you know i've had it and i like to be able to express myself with the american
[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:20.200]  people because it's time that we do rise up and i've been advocating peacefully but there will
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:26.200]  come a time when if things don't work we're back to 1776 and we're not part of it well they plan to
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:30.760]  push us into that position and that's why they're militarizing the police william benning seconded
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:36.360]  in what your lawsuit proved uh the former fourth in charge of the nsa that it's a totalitarian
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:43.000]  takeover system to suppress legitimate political action uh we are in the hands of a radical revolution
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:47.400]  we're the restorationists we're the counter revolution and that's how they list us
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:52.600]  up there you know the bill ares and the rest of them just just just just really an amazing group
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:57.080]  of people i think it's important they know though that they're never going to get away with this in
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:03.480]  the end in the end there's going to be nurenberg style trials for these people and the collaborators
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:07.080]  that tried to bring in this criminal system i mean does your gut tell you we're going to end up
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:13.000]  winning in the end larry plan it does you know i have a lot of faith and i am an optimist or i
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:19.320]  wouldn't be doing what i'm doing and you wouldn't either uh as thomas jefferson said when the people
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:24.280]  fear the government there's tyranny when the government fears the people there's liberty
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:29.240]  they need to start hearing us because they're going to have to answer to us at some point all
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:35.240]  right larry claiming thank you so much uh for joining us freedom watch usa.org we'll talk to
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:41.080]  you again soon god bless you thank you we're almost out of time for this sunday edition larry
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:46.040]  claiming has defended the second amendment fought carbon taxes and so much good and whether you
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:51.000]  agree with him on the israel situation or not i look at it from the outside to see the manipulation
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:57.320]  why are both sides being funded to have conflict well it's good for the crisis managers to stay
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:04.040]  in control they want a society based on crisis that they control problem reaction solution
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:11.480]  instead of a society based on open free systems and they're exacerbating tribal warfare between
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:17.880]  east and west in ukraine the same globalist interest same stuff going on in israel and with
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:24.280]  hamas and the palestinians both sides have beefs and grievances i'm not in their fight i don't have
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:29.320]  a dog in those fights i just don't want to be financing either side of it like rand paul says
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:34.840]  i don't want to be involved in this i want my constitution my bill of rights my republic back
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:41.000]  and that's why i'm here with the sunday broadcast that's why we do the nightly news five nights a
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  week at seven o'clock central weeknights that's why i have a three-hour radio show weekdays it's
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:50.200]  why i work so hard because i know the only thing that allows evil to triumph is that good men and
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:56.920]  women do nothing i know we can take this world back by caring and by being as informed on politics
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:03.160]  and geopolitical matters that are so incredibly interesting as we are on fantasy football i got
