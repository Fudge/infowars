[00:00:05.607 --> 00:00:06.849]  Welcome back!
[00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:35.048]  The American people don't want war, the people of the world don't want war, but the elites do, and the wars really are waged against the internal populations more than they are against even foreign nations.
[00:00:35.048 --> 00:00:46.112]  The attack on Iraq is about profit, it's about a police state, it's about domestic control, just as much as it's about seizing control of trillions of oil and hundreds of billions in no-bid weapons contracts.
[00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:50.494]  Charles, Jeff, Steve, Steve and many others that are holding, we'll go to your calls here in just about
[00:00:50.994 --> 00:01:00.241]  Ten minutes, but I wanted to get Cindy Sheehan on because there's been comments like, you know, good riddance, attention whore, and Drudge carried that headline.
[00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:07.647]  Her son died, and I remember interviewing Cindy before the Democratic Party basically co-opted her, or tried to.
[00:01:07.647 --> 00:01:16.094]  I remember whenever she was really first on this show, and shows on Genesis, when she was speaking out about the fraud that is the war.
[00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.955]  And so they've tried to destroy her work and her son's memory and what she's done, just like they're now claiming Rosie O'Donnell was fired when it's admitted she wasn't fired.
[00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:27.696]  She left the show because of censorship.
[00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:34.240]  They want to destroy the fact, that's another news story today, that she boldly stood up for her convictions.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.102]  Fox News and the Pentagon, that's who runs Fox, wanted to take that away.
[00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:40.797]  And so joining us is Cindy Sheehan.
[00:01:40.797 --> 00:01:48.128]  She's saying she's not giving up, is the headline that I'm reading here, but that she's just getting out of the so-called peace movement.
[00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.869]  The co-opted Democratic Party.
[00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.011]  Look, as long as anti-war is a set piece for political power, it's okay.
[00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:59.613]  But now, we've got to get position for Hillary to come in and warmonger into Iran.
[00:01:59.613 --> 00:02:03.154]  And so, I've heard locals talk about how bad she is.
[00:02:03.154 --> 00:02:10.037]  Oh, they loved her a year ago, but Cindy Sheehan, she's not good, which shows us that both parties are controlled.
[00:02:10.037 --> 00:02:12.278]  Cindy Sheehan, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:02:12.278 --> 00:02:13.138]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[00:02:13.138 --> 00:02:14.419]  It's great to talk to you again.
[00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:17.487]  Tell us about the whole saga.
[00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:18.187]  Just sum it up.
[00:02:18.187 --> 00:02:31.430]  What the last two, three years have been like since you've been going public and really being on the front line and being a focal point of this war being an international war crime, a war of aggression.
[00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.870]  And then what led you to make this announcement a few days ago?
[00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:43.452]  Well, you know, after Casey died, I started to really do what I should have done before he died.
[00:02:44.048 --> 00:02:48.130]  I started to research about our country and what our country does.
[00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.633]  I had a vague notion being a history major, but they don't teach us history, even in universities.
[00:02:55.633 --> 00:03:02.717]  You know, we get hand-picked, cherry-picked stories of how great our country is.
[00:03:02.717 --> 00:03:05.238]  And so I just started researching, you know.
[00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:21.332]  I evolved to the place I am now from being anti-war to being anti-imperialism, anti-fascism, anti-corporatism, that really characterize the nature of this conflict and the nature of the United States.
[00:03:21.332 --> 00:03:28.578]  And, you know, something struck me when you were talking that I was co-opted or the Democratic Party tried to co-opt me.
[00:03:28.578 --> 00:03:31.001]  Well, I think that they definitely used
[00:03:33.263 --> 00:04:02.886]  The anti-war what they call left in the anti-war left in this country to be elected to regain control of Congress and then they have totally betrayed us and that's really last week when they voted for the funding I left the Democratic Party any ties I had to them which were very you know tenuous at that point anyway I cut all ties you know I renounced my you know my membership in the Democratic Party
[00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:13.702]  And then the so-called left started slurring me with as much vigor and, you know, as despicably as the right has been doing for these past years.
[00:04:13.702 --> 00:04:14.882]  And I said, you know what?
[00:04:14.882 --> 00:04:15.562]  I don't need it.
[00:04:15.562 --> 00:04:21.124]  Why am I killing myself for trying to make this country better than it is?
[00:04:21.124 --> 00:04:31.327]  And why am I, you know, using up all my savings, all my energy, all my physical health for a country that really doesn't want to be helped?
[00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:52.682]  Well, I understand that it's depressing sometime in the face of the fight, but just as you made that announcement two days ago, I've seen you make some other announcements that you're realizing you can't give up because you're going to save lives of men and women in Iraq and our troops, other cases out there by what you're doing, and it's clear now.
[00:04:52.682 --> 00:04:54.863]  This is a wake-up call for everybody in America.
[00:04:54.863 --> 00:04:58.344]  The left-right paradigm is a false matrix-like
[00:04:59.316 --> 00:05:01.497]  I mean, look at the poll that came out a month ago
[00:05:19.842 --> 00:05:22.084]  Uh, that Bush has the same approval rating as Congress.
[00:05:22.084 --> 00:05:25.788]  So Democrats did have a better approval rating a few months ago, but now it's plunged too.
[00:05:25.788 --> 00:05:35.237]  So, so really, I think this is all part of the process of kind of an end of childhood for a lot of people, you know, mentally, that, my God, they really don't care what we want.
[00:05:35.237 --> 00:05:36.458]  We're really not in a free country.
[00:05:37.452 --> 00:05:41.213]  Well, you know what, we're a laughing stock all over the world.
[00:05:41.213 --> 00:05:49.876]  The world sees that the majority of Americans want out of Iraq, they want the Bush administration gone, and they're still functioning.
[00:05:49.876 --> 00:06:02.240]  And if 80% of America is on my side, and 80% of America supports what I say, and wants the same things I want, then 80% of America has to start making some sacrifices also.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.941]  And not just sit behind their computers criticizing people who are making
[00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:09.826]  The sacrifices and I will never give up on humanity.
[00:06:09.826 --> 00:06:21.191]  There are so many people in our world who are being destroyed, whose lands are being taken, whose families are being taken for this corporate military imperialism of the United States.
[00:06:21.191 --> 00:06:27.593]  And I will fight for them now and hope that there's some residual positive effect here in America.
[00:06:29.731 --> 00:06:39.399]  Well, it is true that worldwide people are really waking up to what's happening, but I want to make it clear, and I want to get your take on this, Cindy Sheehan.
[00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:54.792]  When we say American imperialism, we have foreign interests, multinational corporations, Halliburton's now in Dubai, using America as their engine, as their front, to carry out world domination.
[00:06:54.792 --> 00:06:58.255]  So I think it's important to not, at the same time, just say that it's America.
[00:06:59.255 --> 00:07:01.316]  You want to comment on that?
[00:07:01.316 --> 00:07:13.500]  Well, of course it's corporate America and with the backing and the approval and the cooperation of our government is what's happening here.
[00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:14.752]  I am sure.
[00:07:14.752 --> 00:07:26.845]  I'm positive that if American citizens knew what was going on, if they were really educated, they would be appalled and opposed to what really makes this country tick.
[00:07:26.845 --> 00:07:34.413]  And not just be opposed to the Iraq War or George Bush, because they're just symptoms of an underlying cancer in this country.
[00:07:35.342 --> 00:07:48.635]  Well, you're right, it is a cancer, and it's always been disgusting to me that when George Bush is doing something bad, conservatives can't see it because he has a conservative label, and then when Democrats are doing bad things, liberals will defend them regardless.
[00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.517]  I mean, that's a recipe for enslavement.
[00:07:51.517 --> 00:07:54.440]  Well, you know, and what is a liberal now?
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.184]  People say Hillary Clinton is a liberal, and that's just...
[00:08:00.376 --> 00:08:02.018]  Well, those two are almost identical.
[00:08:02.018 --> 00:08:04.360]  It's just one's a man and one's a woman.
[00:08:21.559 --> 00:08:31.385]  You've been asked a lot about 9-11 truth and questions and calls like Ray McGovern has done for an independent investigation and the pools of molten steel and all of it.
[00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:43.412]  And I was just curious, did the Democratic operatives and people ever try to keep you from talking about that or talking about this war also being partly for Israel's gain?
[00:08:43.412 --> 00:08:45.053]  I mean, now that you've divorced yourself
[00:08:45.933 --> 00:08:49.534]  You know, from the establishment system, which you were never really a part of.
[00:08:49.534 --> 00:08:54.075]  When I said co-opted, I meant they were trying themselves to co-opt your message.
[00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:54.595]  Yeah.
[00:08:54.595 --> 00:09:01.356]  I mean, but now, I mean, is there anything you want to say openly here about 9-11 investigations or about Israel?
[00:09:01.356 --> 00:09:03.397]  Well, you know, Alex, I have.
[00:09:03.397 --> 00:09:07.858]  I have also called for a valid, independent investigation of 9-11.
[00:09:07.858 --> 00:09:13.579]  And I've signed the petition with the Jersey Girls, you know, who have been asking for
[00:09:14.264 --> 00:09:18.625]  A valid, independent investigation also.
[00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:27.648]  I think that the 9-11 Commission and their report was, you know, a total travesty and a smokescreen.
[00:09:27.648 --> 00:09:34.710]  And I am also calling for, you know, like I said, a better investigation.
[00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:39.752]  I mean, actually, really, an investigation into 9-11, because the other one was just a farce.
[00:09:40.582 --> 00:09:57.406]  And I have steadfastly stuck to my guns that I believe that part of the reason why we're having so many problems in the Arab-Muslim world is because of our overwhelming support for Israel's policies in Palestine.
[00:09:57.406 --> 00:10:02.807]  And I've supported that, I've said that, I'll stand by that statement, you know, 100%.
[00:10:02.807 --> 00:10:08.048]  I think that our policies need to be fair in that region to everybody who lives there, not just
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:19.468]  The government of Israel, and I know there are many people who are Jewish and who live in Israel who agree that their government is very oppressive of the Palestinian people.
[00:10:19.468 --> 00:10:24.892]  And I think that those are occupied territories as much as Iraq is.
[00:10:24.892 --> 00:10:29.095]  And I've called for occupations to end all over the world.
[00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:35.340]  Specifically on 9-11, why are you calling for another or really a first independent investigation?
[00:10:35.962 --> 00:10:45.788]  Well, because I think the other one was just, you know, for one thing, George Bush and Dick Cheney held hands and testified behind closed doors, not under oath.
[00:10:45.788 --> 00:10:49.031]  You know, it'd be nice to get these people out in the open.
[00:10:49.031 --> 00:10:51.252]  Let's get everything out in the open.
[00:10:51.252 --> 00:10:55.054]  And there are many things that just don't add up on that day.
[00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:55.915]  What about specifics?
[00:10:55.915 --> 00:10:57.736]  I mean, you know, let's talk about some of the things that don't add up that day.
[00:10:57.736 --> 00:10:58.837]  Yeah, I'm not going to sit here.
[00:10:58.837 --> 00:11:03.400]  I'm not going to say that I know that the government did it, because I don't know that.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:11.749]  And the only reason I don't know that is because I have not had time to study it, as some people have had time to study it.
[00:11:11.749 --> 00:11:14.513]  But you were just saying, though, that there are some things that don't add up.
[00:11:14.513 --> 00:11:16.976]  What are some of the things that make you question?
[00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:23.683]  Well, why was the air defenses, why were they doing
[00:11:24.987 --> 00:11:27.670]  I mean that's not even from what I understand
[00:11:49.665 --> 00:11:52.167]  And you know more about this than I do.
[00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:54.488]  It's not even an order to do that.
[00:11:54.488 --> 00:11:55.048]  It's mandatory.
[00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:55.909]  It's default.
[00:11:55.909 --> 00:12:06.855]  But from what I understand is the FAA person, the head of the FAA, who just started that day, countermanded that automatic order.
[00:12:06.855 --> 00:12:07.916]  Yes, that's what happened.
[00:12:07.916 --> 00:12:14.240]  And then, of course, the molten steel at temperatures hotter than jet fuel even burns for months in the basement.
[00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:15.607]  Right.
[00:12:15.607 --> 00:12:19.650]  And it does look to me like it was a controlled demolition.
[00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.571]  But I'm not an expert.
[00:12:21.571 --> 00:12:22.973]  I understand.
[00:12:22.973 --> 00:12:30.779]  And I haven't had time to research it, but it does to me look like a controlled demolition from a very amateur eye.
[00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:32.520]  I understand.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.362]  But there have been a lot of engineers... I'm looking at common sense.
[00:12:35.362 --> 00:12:37.004]  You know, I'm looking at common sense.
[00:12:37.004 --> 00:12:39.126]  I'm just coming at this from a common sense.
[00:12:39.126 --> 00:12:40.467]  But there have been a lot of engineers...
[00:12:41.773 --> 00:12:51.598]  Sure, well there have been a lot of engineers and scientists saying it's a controlled demolition and then we have all the firemen and police on video saying they were told to get back that it was going to be brought down.
[00:12:51.598 --> 00:12:56.641]  Right, so there's just a lot of very questionable things.
[00:12:56.641 --> 00:13:06.226]  We also have Bush in the bunker, I mean Cheney in the bunker in control of the whole thing and Norman Mineta's testimony about you know saying that the order still stood.
[00:13:06.226 --> 00:13:09.268]  Well see and I said you know more about it than I do because
[00:13:09.818 --> 00:13:19.708]  I've been so busy and I just try to stay up on the lives of the Iraq War and I know that they're tied in together.
[00:13:19.708 --> 00:13:24.172]  But now that I have some time, maybe I'll be able to study it more thoroughly.
[00:13:24.172 --> 00:13:30.599]  I do see some very high profile people who are saying that they think it was an inside job.
[00:13:31.797 --> 00:13:33.702]  Just a final question, Cindy.
[00:13:33.702 --> 00:13:39.637]  I want you to tell people about your website, how people can support you, what your future plans are, and then a caveat to that.
[00:13:41.844 --> 00:13:43.886]  I just want to make a statement and get your take on it.
[00:13:43.886 --> 00:13:54.053]  I mean, there are some top, you know, fake neolib sites attacking you and people attacking you who are part of the system and make their living off of being apologists for the corrupt Democratic Party.
[00:13:54.053 --> 00:13:57.456]  But overall, I mean, the American people are supportive of you.
[00:13:57.456 --> 00:14:00.278]  Overall, people are disgusted with the Democratic Party.
[00:14:00.278 --> 00:14:05.421]  And that's why we see their approval ratings dropping like a lead in the ocean.
[00:14:05.421 --> 00:14:06.002]  Uh-huh.
[00:14:06.002 --> 00:14:08.804]  Well, and I do know that there's a lot of support and love.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:18.345]  I do know that there's room for everybody to be involved in the movement, too, so I'm going to step out of the way and make room for those people.
[00:14:18.345 --> 00:14:27.831]  But right now, for right now, my website is thecampkcpeacinstitute.org, and we are my staff.
[00:14:27.831 --> 00:14:30.392]  I have one assistant, my sister.
[00:14:30.392 --> 00:14:34.975]  We're going to pull back this month and try to see.
[00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:38.057]  We are going to be back, but we're going to be back from a different angle.
[00:14:38.504 --> 00:14:39.645]  Or a different direction.
[00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:45.609]  I think I've come to a brick wall in what I can do within the peace movement.
[00:14:45.609 --> 00:14:48.210]  So we're going to come at it.
[00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:52.173]  We've exploited the chink in the armor of the Bush administration.
[00:14:52.173 --> 00:14:54.134]  So we're going to come at it at a different angle.
[00:14:54.134 --> 00:15:01.439]  I hear Bush is going to leave his Hollywood cowboy set soon.
[00:15:01.439 --> 00:15:04.061]  I heard that they're going to move to Dallas, yeah.
[00:15:05.672 --> 00:15:07.152]  Where Dick Cheney lives.
[00:15:07.152 --> 00:15:09.913]  So he won't need the cowboy set anymore, I guess.
[00:15:09.913 --> 00:15:17.395]  Yeah, I am selling the property in Crawford, Texas that I purchased.
[00:15:17.395 --> 00:15:22.957]  Camp Casey is going to live forever in people's memories and hearts.
[00:15:22.957 --> 00:15:30.639]  The other day I said Casey died for nothing, but so many people have emailed me contradicting that, saying that
[00:15:31.195 --> 00:15:44.702]  You know, his death sparked them to activism, and I just hope that people will honor Casey's death and the death of the others by continuing this struggle for truth, for peace, and for accountability.
[00:15:44.702 --> 00:15:45.703]  I agree.
[00:15:45.703 --> 00:15:55.909]  By the way, you had to buy that property because they passed a special county law not letting you guys protest on the dirt roads.
[00:15:55.909 --> 00:15:56.569]  In the ditches.
[00:15:57.449 --> 00:16:00.471]  Yeah, just basically anywhere all over the county.
[00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:02.392]  And so you had to go buy that property.
[00:16:02.392 --> 00:16:05.674]  I'm just curious, how much did you buy the property for?
[00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:10.517]  I paid $52,500 and I have put in tens of thousands of dollars in improvements.
[00:16:10.517 --> 00:16:14.179]  So, you know, I'm sad I won't.
[00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:17.041]  I'll consider every offer as long as it's reasonable.
[00:16:18.587 --> 00:16:31.573]  Well, it'd be great to keep Camp Casey in the hands of people that are anti-war, just as a historical, I mean, I guarantee you, that needs to have a historical marker placed on it, you know, a hundred years from now, if we survive as a species.
[00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:35.834]  I hope so, and I hope we survive as a species a hundred years from now.
[00:16:35.834 --> 00:16:36.395]  Absolutely.
[00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:46.299]  Well, I want to, as soon as you're rested in a month or so, I know you're exhausted, I want to get you up for a full hour to really talk about your experiences in the last, what, it's been three years that you've been out there fighting?
[00:16:47.168 --> 00:16:48.009]  Almost, yeah.
[00:16:48.009 --> 00:16:51.292]  I started on the 4th of July 2004.
[00:16:51.292 --> 00:16:55.255]  I think that you are going to come back even stronger after a month's rest.
[00:16:55.255 --> 00:17:00.639]  I haven't had a rest, a real rest, more than a week or so in 12, 13 years.
[00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:02.120]  Oh my goodness.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:07.625]  Yeah, and I certainly need one myself, but there's just, but I'm actually, I'm afraid.
[00:17:07.625 --> 00:17:14.791]  I've taken off a week before, and then I'm totally exhausted when I actually relax that I like have to keep going or I'll fall apart.
[00:17:15.631 --> 00:17:24.598]  I've kind of gotten into catch-22, but we'll all pray for you and Cindy Sheehan, we appreciate you coming on and you've really been an incredible trooper and we salute you.
[00:17:24.598 --> 00:17:29.201]  Well, I hope that we can, like you said, talk further and longer the next time.
[00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:30.182]  God bless you.
[00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:31.222]  Okay, you too, Alex.
[00:17:31.222 --> 00:17:32.063]  Thank you.
[00:17:32.063 --> 00:17:32.703]  There she goes.
[00:17:32.703 --> 00:17:34.465]  We'll be right back with your calls, I promise.
[00:17:34.465 --> 00:17:35.946]  Straight to your calls on the other side.
