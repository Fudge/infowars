[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.400]  Welcome back!
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.640]  The American people don't want war, the people of the world don't want war, but the elites
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.360]  do and the wars really are waged against the internal populations more than they are against
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.120]  even foreign nations.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.120]  The attack on Iraq is about profit, it's about a police state, it's about domestic control
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.280]  just as much as it's about seizing control of trillions of oil and hundreds of billions
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.080]  in no-bid weapons contracts.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.040]  Charles, Jeff, Steve, Steve and many others that are holding, we'll go to your calls here
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.600]  in just about ten minutes, but I wanted to get Cindy Sheehan on because there's been
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.280]  comments like, you know, good riddance, attention whore and drudge carried that headline.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.760]  Her son died and I remember interviewing Cindy before the Democratic Party basically co-opted
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.120]  her or tried to.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.680]  I remember whenever she was really first on this show and shows on Genesis when she was
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.380]  speaking out about the fraud that is the war and so they've tried to destroy her work and
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.120]  her son's memory and what she's done, just like you're now claiming Rosie O'Donnell was
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.040]  fired when it's admitted she wasn't fired.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.480]  She left the show because of censorship, they wanted to destroy the fact, that's another
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.280]  news story today, that she boldly stood up for her convictions.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.640]  Fox News and the Pentagon, that's who runs Fox, wanted to take that away and so joining
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.880]  us is Cindy Sheehan.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.840]  She's saying she's not giving up is the headline that I'm reading here, but that she's just
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.600]  getting out of the so-called peace movement, the co-opted Democratic Party.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.880]  As long as anti-war is a set piece for political power it's okay, but now we've got to get
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.880]  positioned for Hillary to come in and warmonger into Iran and so I've heard locals talk about
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.240]  how bad she is.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.160]  They loved her a year ago, but Cindy Sheehan, she's not good, which shows us that both parties
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.160]  are controlled.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.560]  Cindy Sheehan, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.000]  Oh, thank you, Alex, it's great to talk to you again.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.600]  Tell us about the whole saga, just sum it up, what the last two or three years have
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.840]  been like since you've been going public and really being on the front line and being
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.200]  a focal point of this war being an international war crime, a war of aggression, and then what
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.840]  led you to make this announcement a few days ago?
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.920]  Well, you know, after Casey died I started to really do what I should have done before
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.920]  he died.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.120]  I started to research about our country and what our country does.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.960]  I had a vague notion being a history major, but they don't teach us history even in universities.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:03.640]  We get hand-picked, cherry-picked stories of how great our country is and so I just
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:12.400]  started researching and I evolved to the place I am now from being anti-war to being anti-imperialism
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.880]  and anti-fascism, anti-corporatism that really characterized the nature of this conflict
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.400]  and the nature of the United States and you know what, something struck me when you were
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.280]  talking that I was co-opted or the Democratic Party tried to co-opt me.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:36.560]  Well, I think that they definitely used the anti-war, what they call left, the anti-war
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.160]  left in this country to be elected to regain control of Congress and then they have totally
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.520]  betrayed us and that's really last week when they voted for the funding.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.520]  I left the Democratic Party, any ties I had to them which were very, you know, tenuous
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:02.400]  at that point anyway, I cut all ties, you know, I renounced my membership in the Democratic
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.160]  Party and then the so-called left started slurring me with as much vigor and, you know,
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.640]  as despicably as the right has been doing for these past years and I said, you know
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.640]  what, I don't need it.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.600]  Why am I killing myself for trying to make this country better than it is and why am
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:29.880]  I, you know, using up all my savings, all my energy, all my physical health for a country
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.280]  that really doesn't want to be helped?
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.400]  Well, I understand that it's depressing some time in the face of the fight but just since
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.440]  you made that announcement two days ago, I've seen you make some other announcements that
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.880]  you're realizing you can't give up because you're going to save lives of men and women
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.800]  in Iraq and our troops, other KC's out there by what you're doing and it's clear now, this
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.000]  is a wake-up call for everybody in America, the left-right paradigm is a false matrix-like
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.520]  illusion and that the people, you know, almost 80% in major polls do want out of Iraq.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.600]  We do want an end to this.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.680]  So the people are with you, Cindy, it's just the, it's the Democratic apparatus along with
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.440]  the Republican mechanism that are really joined at the hip and part of the same military-industrial
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.440]  complex.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.360]  So I think it's all just, I mean, look at the poll that came out a month ago that Bush
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.160]  has the same approval rating as Congress.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.440]  So Democrats did have a better approval rating a few months ago but now it's plunged too.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.760]  So really, I think this is all part of the process of kind of an end of childhood for
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.320]  a lot of people, you know, mentally, that my God, they really don't care what we want.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.800]  We're really not in a free country.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.320]  Well, you know what, and we're a laughing stock all over the world, the world sees that
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.600]  the majority of Americans want out of Iraq, they want George, the Bush administration
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:55.000]  gone and they're still functioning and if 80% of America is on my side and 80% of America
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.040]  supports what I say and wants the same things I want, then 80% of America have to start
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.040]  making some sacrifices also and not just sit behind their computers criticizing people
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.960]  who are making the sacrifices and I will never give up on humanity.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.240]  There are so many people in our world who are being destroyed, whose lands are being
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.800]  taken, whose families are being taken for this corporate military imperialism of the
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.760]  United States and I will fight for them now and hope that there's some residual positive
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.840]  effect here in America.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.800]  Well it is true that worldwide people are really waking up to what's happening but I
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.480]  want to make it clear and I want to get your take on this Cindy Sheehan.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.040]  When we say American imperialism, we have foreign interests, multinational corporations,
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:51.480]  Talibertans now in Dubai using America as their engine, as their front to carry out
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.200]  world domination so I think it's important to not at the same time just say that it's
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.520]  America, I mean you want to comment on that?
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:08.520]  Well of course it's corporate America and with the backing and the approval and the
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.520]  cooperation of our government is what's happening here, I am sure, I'm positive that if American
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.360]  citizens knew what was going on, if they were really educated, they would be appalled and
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.040]  opposed to what really makes this country tick and not just be opposed to the Iraq war
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.440]  or George Bush because they're just symptoms of an underlying cancer in this country.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.680]  Well you're right, it is a cancer and it's always been disgusting to me that when George
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.320]  Bush is doing something bad, conservatives can't see it because he has a conservative
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.480]  label and then when Democrats are doing bad things, liberals will defend them regardless,
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.640]  I mean that's a recipe for enslavement.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.360]  Well you know, and what is a liberal now? People say Hillary Clinton is a liberal and
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:04.360]  that's just an abomination of the term like you said, you know, she's just a war hawk
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:12.440]  a warmonger and very little distinction between her and let's say a John McCain or more specifically
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.360]  probably or appropriately Rudy Giuliani.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.640]  Well those two are almost identical, it's just one's a man, one's a woman.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.560]  You've been asked a lot about 9-11 truth and questions and calls like Ray McGovern has
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:31.440]  done for an independent investigation and the pools of molten steel and all of it and
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.600]  I was just curious, did the Democratic operatives and people ever try to keep you from talking
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:43.600]  about that or talking about this war also being partly for Israel's gain? I mean now
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.400]  that you've divorced yourself from the establishment system, which you were never really a part
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.880]  of when I said co-opted, I meant they were trying themselves to co-opt your message.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.240]  But now, is there anything you want to say openly here about 9-11 investigations or about
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:00.880]  Israel?
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:08.440]  Well you know Alex, I have also called for a valid independent investigation of 9-11
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:14.000]  and I've signed the petition with the Jersey girls, you know, who have been asking for
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000]  a valid independent investigation also. I think that the 9-11 commission and their report
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:29.720]  was a total travesty and a smokescreen and I am also calling for an independent investigation
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:37.600]  and you know, like I said, a better investigation, I mean actually really an investigation into
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:44.600]  9-11 because the other one was just a farce. And I have steadfastly stuck to my guns that
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:51.320]  I believe that part of the reason why we're having so many problems in the Arab-Muslim
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:58.000]  world is because of our overwhelming support for Israel's policies in Palestine and I've
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.120]  supported that, I've said that, I'll stand by that statement, you know, 100%. I think
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.640]  that our policies need to be fair in that region to everybody who lives there, not just
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.240]  the government of Israel and I know there are many people who are Jewish and who live
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:19.240]  in Israel who agree that their government is very oppressive of the Palestinian people
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:26.240]  and I think that those are occupied territories as much as Iraq is and I've called for occupations
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.960]  to end all over the world.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.680]  Specifically on 9-11, why are you calling for another or really a first independent
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.080]  investigation?
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.400]  Well because I think the other one was just, you know, for one thing George Bush and Dick
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.160]  Cheney held hands and testified behind closed doors, not under oath, you know, it would
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.440]  be nice to get these people out in the open, let's get everything out in the open and there
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.120]  are many things that just don't add up on that day.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.680]  What about specifics? I mean, you know, let's talk about some of the things that don't add
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.680]  up on that day.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.240]  Yeah, I'm not going to sit here, I'm not going to say that I know that the government did
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.400]  it because I don't know that and the only reason I don't know that is because I have
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.840]  not had time to study it as some people have had time to study it.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.680]  But you were just saying though that there are some things that don't add up. What are
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.120]  some of the things that make you question?
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:24.120]  Well why was the air defenses, why were they doing a search?
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.000]  Why was exercise that day?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.080]  Why was a new FAA head in there that day just for the first day?
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:38.800]  And why weren't the controls, the automatic mandatory controls is when you lose contact
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:45.120]  with an airplane, you intercept it with a military jet and that should only take seconds
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.120]  and that, those orders weren't, I mean that's not even, from what I understand and you know
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.360]  more about this than I do, it's not even an order to do that, it's mandatory.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.360]  It's default.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:02.160]  But from what I understand is the FAA person, the head of the FAA who just started that
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.400]  day countermanded that automatic order.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.560]  Yes, that's what happened and then of course the molten steel at temperatures hotter than
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.560]  jet fuel even burns for months in the basement.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000]  Right, and it does look to me like it was a controlled demolition, but I'm not an expert.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]  I understand.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  And I haven't had time to research it, but it does to me look like a controlled demolition
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]  from a very amateur eye.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]  I understand, but there have been a lot of engineers.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]  I'm looking at common sense, you know, I'm looking at common sense.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]  I'm just coming at this from a common sense.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]  But there have been a lot of engineers.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]  That's just because I'm not an expert.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.440]  There have been a lot of engineers and scientists saying it's a controlled demolition.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.440]  And then we have all the firemen and police on video saying they were told to get back
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.440]  that it was going to be brought down.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.440]  Right, so there's just a lot of very questionable things.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.440]  We also have Bush in the bunker, I mean, Cheney in the bunker in control of the whole thing
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.440]  and Norm Mineta's testimony about, you know, saying that the order still stood.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:11.440]  Well, see, and I said you know more about it than I do because I've been so busy and
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.880]  trying to stay up on, you know, the lives of the Iraq war.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.880]  And I know that they're tied in together.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.880]  But, you know, now that I have some time maybe I'll be able to study it more thoroughly.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:29.880]  But I do see some very high profile people who are saying that they think it was an inside job.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.880]  Just a final question, Cindy.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.880]  I want you to tell people about your website, how people can support you, what your future plans are.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:44.320]  And a caveat to that, I just want to make a statement and get your take on it.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.320]  I mean, there are some top, you know, fake neo-lib sites attacking you and people attacking you
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:54.320]  who are part of the system and make their living off of being apologists for the corrupt Democratic Party.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.320]  But overall, I mean, the American people are supportive of you.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.320]  Overall, people are disgusted with the Democratic Party.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.320]  And that's why we see their approval ratings dropping like a lead in the ocean.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.760]  And I do know that there's a lot of support in lab.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.760]  But I do know that there's room for everybody to be involved in the movement, too.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.760]  So I'm going to step out of the way and make room for those people.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:24.760]  But right now, for right now, my website is the campkcpeaceinstitute.org.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.760]  And we are my staff.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.760]  I have one assistant and my sister.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.760]  We're going to pull back this month and try to see.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:40.200]  We are going to be back, but we're going to be back from a different angle or a different direction.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.200]  I think I've come to a brick wall in what I can do within the peace movement.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.200]  So we're going to come at it.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.200]  We've exploited the chink in the armor of the Bush administration.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.200]  So we're going to come at it at a different angle.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.200]  I hear Bush is going to leave.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.200]  I hear Bush is going to leave his Hollywood cowboy set soon.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.640]  I heard that they're going to move to Dallas, yeah.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.640]  Where Dick Cheney lives.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.640]  So he won't need the cowboy set anymore, I guess.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:17.640]  Yeah, I am selling the property in Crawford, Texas that I purchased.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:22.640]  Camp Casey is going to live forever in people's memories and hearts.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.640]  I hope that...
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.640]  The other day I said Casey died for nothing.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:35.080]  So many people have emailed me contradicting that saying that his death sparked them to activism.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:44.080]  I just hope that people will honor Casey's death and the death of the others by continuing the struggle for truth, for peace, and for accountability.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.080]  I agree.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:55.080]  By the way, you had to buy that property because they passed a special county law not letting you guys protest on the dirt roads.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.080]  In the ditches.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.520]  Yeah, just basically anywhere all over the county.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.520]  And so you had to go buy that property.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.520]  I'm just curious, how much did you buy the property for?
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.520]  I paid $52,500 and I have put in tens of thousands of dollars in improvement.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:18.520]  So, you know, I said I'll consider every offer as long as it's reasonable.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:24.520]  Well, it'd be great to keep Camp Casey in the hands of people that are anti-war just as a historical...
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:31.960]  I mean, I guarantee you that needs to have a historical marker placed on it, you know, 100 years from now if we survive as a species.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.960]  I hope so, and I hope we survive as a species 100 years from now.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.960]  Absolutely.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:43.960]  Well, as soon as you're rested in a month or so, I know you're exhausted, I want to get you up for a full hour to really talk about your experiences in the last...
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.960]  What, it's been three years that you've been out there fighting?
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.960]  Almost, yeah.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.960]  I started on the 4th of July 2004.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.400]  I think that you are going to come back even stronger after a month's rest.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:00.400]  I haven't had a rest, a real rest, more than a week or so in 12, 13 years.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.400]  Oh my goodness.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.400]  Yeah, and I certainly need one myself, but there's just...
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.400]  But I'm actually, I'm afraid.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:15.400]  I've taken off a week before and then I'm totally exhausted when I actually relax that I like have to keep going or I'll fall apart.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.400]  I've kind of gotten into that catch-22, but we'll all pray for you.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:24.840]  Cindy Sheehan, we appreciate you coming on and you've really been an incredible trooper and we salute you.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.840]  Well, I hope that we can, like you said, talk further and longer the next time.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.840]  God bless you.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.840]  Okay, you too, Alex, thank you.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.840]  There she goes, we'll be right back with your calls, I promise.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.840]  Straight to your calls on the other side.
