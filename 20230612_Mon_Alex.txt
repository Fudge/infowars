[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.500]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say, I don't know what's
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.500]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.500]  one!
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.500]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:50.600]  During the most catastrophic forest fires in all of Canadian history, experienced local
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.520]  firefighters are being sidelined.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.440]  Retired forestry technician Peter McIsaac put together an experienced team of firefighters
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.800]  that contacted the government and offered to volunteer their support.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.200]  As things progressed last week and buildings were burning and people were being evacuated,
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.600]  I realized that Nova Scotia had a resource of retired technical staff that were experts
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600]  at fighting fire.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.680]  I called some of these guys up and I put together a crack team.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.260]  On the first team I put together, we had close to 200 years of experience of fighting fires
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.500]  here in the Acadia region and our own government passed over an opportunity to hire a team
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.700]  of professionals to come in and help them.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.100]  Our team stayed on standby hoping that we'd get a call all week and that call never came.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.420]  So if you lost your house and fires remained out of control, when a politician looks you
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.540]  in the eye and says we did everything we could, they're lying to your face.
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.620]  While the government lets Canada burn, they blame climate change.
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.340]  But other than all the fires, nothing significant has changed and the massive amount of wildfires
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.340]  just started a few years ago.
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.540]  So what happened?
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.100]  Over 90% of wildfires are caused by humans and many of them are intentional, which is
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.660]  known as arson.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.500]  During the surge of wildfires along the west coast of the United States a few years ago,
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.500]  several people were arrested for arson, including a 41-year-old man who admitted to starting
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.060]  11 fires.
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.300]  Security cameras show people's houses being set on fire.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.420]  A homeowner caught an arsonist dressed in all black and a member of black-clad terrorist
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.180]  organization Antifa was arrested for arson in Washington state.
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.220]  Just months before the 2020 wildfires, Extinction Rebellion published a poster with a burning
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.500]  forest and the words, declare a climate emergency.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:03.500]  And in Canada, in 2021, a woman was charged with 32 counts of arson connected to numerous
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.940]  wildfires in northeast Alberta.
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.940]  Last year in British Columbia, a 42-year-old woman was arrested and charged with four
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.660]  counts of arson. And this year, there is much more.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.260]  In Alberta, the RCMP are searching for a suspect after a fire broke out in Grand Prairie.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.540]  The suspected arsonist was reportedly wearing all black.
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.300]  The RCMP's serious crime branch, the Forestry Crimes Unit, have been investigating multiple
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.580]  wildfires and arsons, and a 29-year-old man has been charged with 10 counts of arson.
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.900]  In Nova Scotia, the RCMP believe at least three of the fires in Pictou County were
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:55.140]  arson. Satellite imagery shows that on June 2nd, most of southeast Quebec went up in flames
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.420]  at the same time, which demonstrates a highly coordinated arson attack.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.660]  Somewhere between Wyoming and California, 30 tons of ammonium nitrate reportedly disappeared
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.500]  from a train. Ammonium nitrate can be used as an explosive, and it can also be used as
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.260]  an accelerant. On its own, ammonium nitrate will not burn under a flame, but mix it with
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.980]  sawdust and it quickly ignites and burns everything it can.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.260]  And now the federal government of Canada is creating a special national disaster response
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.700]  agency, their very own FEMA. They create the problem, and your reaction demands that they
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.780]  provide a solution. Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, not just our Republic, but the world is under a globalist coup.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.820]  But humanity is awakening. We're live Monday, June 12th. Stay with us.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:05.660]  A lot of people have asked me, why is InfoWars Store and InfoWars Life not at a probiotic for

[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:37.900]  It's Monday, June 12th, 2023, and we are inside the new world order now. I want to play some clips
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.700]  four, seven, and eight of some of the powerful things that Trump said the last few days
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.100]  about the nature of the globalist new world order we're up against and then something that Senator
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.940]  Josh Hawley had to say. And then we will continue into this
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.340]  live teleprompter free worldwide, forbidden for boat and transmission.
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.980]  The stakes of this election could not be more stark either. We have
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.220]  a communist state. You know, they used to use the term deep state. I'm stopping it. I'm using it
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.500]  Marxist. I'm using it fascist. I'm using communist because deep state is far too soft.
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:24.140]  It's actually troubled. At the end of the day, either the communists win and
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:31.020]  destroy America or we destroy the communists because that's what they are.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.940]  They may go by a different. We are a failing nation. We are a nation in decline.
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:43.500]  And now these radical left lunatics want to interfere with our elections by using
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.420]  law enforcement. It's totally corrupt and we can't let it happen.
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:56.700]  This is the final battle with you at my side. We will demolish the deep state.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:04.060]  We will expel the warmongers from our government. We will drive out the globalists. We will cast
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.860]  out the communists. We will throw off the sick political class that hates our country.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:15.340]  We will roll out the fake news media. We will expose the rhinos for what they are.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:21.260]  We will defeat Joe Biden and we will liberate America from these villains.
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.180]  Once and for all, we will liberate. We're going to liberate our country.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:33.500]  It is my conviction that we stand at a moment of great peril when it comes to
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:39.100]  our American civilization. Do you agree with that? We are at a moment of danger,
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.380]  a moment of inflection, a moment where the things that we do, the decisions that we make,
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:52.140]  the choices that we pursue in the next four or five or six years will determine the future of
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:58.860]  this country for the next 50 or 60. More than that, it will determine whether or not we have a country
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:05.500]  in the next 50 or 60. Do you agree? It is a moment of danger. Why? Because the left,
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:13.340]  even as we speak, the left is assaulting the very foundations of our American nation.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.980]  They have decided that they no longer believe in the rule of law.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.260]  Look what happened just yesterday. Former president of the United States
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:30.860]  indicted the first time in American history that a sitting president has tried to indict and jail
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:36.700]  his opponent. I mean, all I can say about it is this. If the people in power can put in jail
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:42.380]  their political opponents, we don't have a republic anymore. That's the danger we're in.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:53.740]  And that's exactly what this is, using the justice system that's totally captured to
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:10:02.060]  preemptively steal the 2024 election. What a time to be alive. And notice,
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:08.140]  they had to get me off air or try before they did all this, because who had the biggest voice,
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.380]  who had the biggest audience of activists with the best guess and analysis predicting
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:19.900]  all of this to a tee? We did. And that's why they put us under FBI and CIA investigation,
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:25.660]  infiltrators, everything. And the depositions, who runs you, who funds you, who gives you your orders?
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.220]  Well, I'm not a follower like you guys. I actually study history and I'm into this
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:35.660]  and really love freedom. I give the orders. I'm in charge. Just like the average American
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.780]  is in charge of their life. We're certainly trying to be in charge. We don't want to be
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:45.820]  part of your Washington pedophile crime network. We don't want to have giant armies of people going
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.900]  out and hunting down and taking people's children because the parents won't chop their genitals off.
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:56.060]  We reject you. We see you. We know what you are and we're done with you. And we are going
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:02.220]  to liberate this republic from the globalist occupiers. And as I've said thousands of times
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.980]  the last 20 years, but only 29, but the last 20, I figured this out. This would all come
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:13.260]  to a head at a certain point. And that we had to point out that it was multinational corporations
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:20.380]  in concert working against the people to buy off government and other corporations and systems and
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:27.660]  universities and academia and the ecclesiastical system as well to get full unified control of
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:33.580]  society to carry out their transhumanist agenda. And now you see it all out in the open.
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:42.220]  You see their entire program. But the minute you understand that BlackRock and Vanguard
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.380]  are owned by the same handful of families and that through fraud and our investment,
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.100]  giving them our money, they are quote, controlling us through the money and
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.140]  we are their slaves. I mean, Larry Fink bragged a few weeks ago that,
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.860]  yeah, we control the governments of the world. We're going to control the people with the ESGs.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:06.620]  He's saying with the cashless society, with the mark of the beast, whether you believe in the
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.540]  devil or not, a revelation or not, or God or not, they certainly used it and said,
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:15.900]  this is a great idea to enslave people. This book about Satan taking over. Let's do this ourselves.
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:25.260]  So people like Jules Verne's 20 years before the Wright brothers for the first time supposedly
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:32.460]  invented an airplane and took flight and Kitty Hawk envisioned flying planes and people 130
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:40.060]  years ago envisioned atomic bombs and mathematical equations. And 60 years after they envisioned it,
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:46.700]  60 years after they envisioned it, they'd been able to be made. And so these globalists
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:52.460]  are envisioning our enslavement in envisioning this nightmare world. Instead of envisioning
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:57.820]  a better world, they're envisioning this horrible world where the small, tiny elite rule over all
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.980]  the impoverished slaves. You think, what a horrible system. Well, if you study history,
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.420]  whether it's the ancient Chinese or ancient Japanese or what was happening in what is
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.940]  Russia today or Western Europe or Africa, or what's Latin America today, Mesoamerica,
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.580]  in every culture that became complex, they wanted to decline at some point.
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.660]  And the elites began to human sacrifice, dumb people down,
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.420]  starve people on purpose, and the systems called feudalism.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:33.820]  Where if you were, say, a wheat farmer in ancient, what is England today?
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.940]  Only if you were an upper-class slave or serf, because you would have a dog. And if your dog,
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:45.580]  if you had a dog, it had to have the half its digits cut off with a hatchet when it was a puppy,
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:54.780]  so that it couldn't run fast and couldn't hunt the king's deer or pheasant or rabbits.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:14:02.620]  And if you got caught eating a rabbit in your stew pot, people came by every day, the little
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:11.740]  lord's men would come by every day in most little towns and villages and outside villages,
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:17.500]  not as much, they'd still come, and they'd say, I smell meat, where did you get meat?
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.780]  Did the local town lord authorize the slaughter of a cow and maybe give you a little bit of meat
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:30.940]  occasionally? No, you ate a rabbit, you're going to be put in the stocks for a week,
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.420]  and you're pinned out in the middle of the town with your hands
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.020]  in a torture device standing for a week, total torture.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:48.700]  The next time you do it, you're dead. The next time you do it, you're dead. You're dead for
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:55.180]  eating a rabbit. And there was different manuals written by different feudal lords, it was always
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:01.900]  the same, that if they caught somebody being self-sufficient, they might become uppity at a
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:07.660]  certain point, and then they found would rebel later. So they had to keep them starving at a
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:13.420]  low level. And normally, they would keep the serfs on about 10% of the land and leave 90% for the
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:21.740]  royalty all open. And the slaves were kept on a very short leash in every culture. Every culture
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.660]  had this, and generally, they enslaved their own people. In history books, they only teach
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:32.060]  the modern pop history about blacks and slavery and the particular types carried out by white
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.380]  people. But it's the same all over the world throughout history. And that's what the new
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.060]  world order is. That's what cutting off the power plants and shutting down the farms and
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.380]  destroying all this and dumbing people down is, is putting you in a feudal state
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.660]  for control. That's what Black Rock and Larry Fink are, would-be feudal lords and masters.
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.620]  They don't want to just pour slaves. They want to get you dumbed down and then just kill you.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.820]  They want to depopulate you.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.340]  People. So one person might like this coffee. Another person likes that coffee.
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.420]  That's how our bodies work. They're all very diverse. But we've been able to private label
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:37.020]  a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price

[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.980]  You wanted to plug RainForce. Do you like RainForce?
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:07.180]  Yeah. Yeah. So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley. How do I write all the books that I do? Four books
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.980]  with Dr. Judy Mikevitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:18.780]  Alex Jones. That's because I use RainForce every day. What I always need is I always need
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:24.780]  some sort of boost in the morning. And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins. But
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:31.260]  the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce. I'll take RainForce
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:36.620]  in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the next four or five hours
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.580]  writing a whole lot of stuff. So it really is true that RainForce is something I use
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.340]  every day, and it helps me with my writing. All right. We love you. We'll be right back. Get
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:50.540]  your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfoWarsStore.com. We'll be right

[00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:38.930]  Alright, let's say I've got a big broadcast line up for you today.
[00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:45.210]  I have mostly incredible off-the-chart news I didn't get to yesterday, because I was mainly
[00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:50.210]  focusing on Trump's incredible indictment of the deep state beyond taking the mask off,
[00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:55.810]  pulling its pants off and trying to openly rape us, and then I've got all the new insane
[00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:56.810]  news today.
[00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:02.130]  I mean, big developments with the Ukrainian offensive getting completely devastated in
[00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.370]  just a week.
[00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:11.250]  We have massive pedo news with the left all over the US, all over Europe, all over Canada,
[00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:15.330]  with armies of marching people literally chanting, we're coming for your children, your children
[00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:16.330]  are ours.
[00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.330]  We have the footage.
[00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.490]  I mean, and it's only going to get worse.
[00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:24.090]  Literally saying your children belong to us.
[00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:28.850]  And we're way far from them hitting peak pedoville.
[00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.450]  So that's all coming up.
[00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:35.650]  Tulsi Gabbard's coming out and saying it's a pedo sex cult.
[00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:41.090]  It's time for folks to grow a pair and point out what's going on here.
[00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.970]  And then we have a stack.
[00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:46.610]  I say and, there's like 30 other stacks here, literally.
[00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:51.970]  There's this stack that is of the last week of news I've been compiling, because every
[00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.130]  day after the show, I go through stacks that I didn't get to, and I always promise, oh,
[00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:56.130]  I'll get to this tomorrow.
[00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.410]  And then it starts stacking up.
[00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:06.330]  Because this stack here is about 15 articles, and it's the worst, most powerful stuff of
[00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:11.530]  the last few weeks or so, last eight, nine days.
[00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:18.690]  And one of these is so bombshell, it should just be the whole show.
[00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:24.010]  And that is the CDC has now put out another study that it authored, echoing the one from
[00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:32.090]  December 2021, that they know there is a massive, multi-thousand percent increase in
[00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:39.810]  myocarditis, that's heart swelling and heart attack death, from the shot, and it is the
[00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.930]  shot.
[00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:48.570]  Another study authored by the CDC, right here.
[00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:52.930]  I mean, just think of the, we already knew it, but I mean, they knew it and they keep
[00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:53.930]  doing it.
[00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:58.090]  It's a country to target little kids, because the government's out to get us.
[00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:03.650]  I mean, the government at the top is a scientific depopulation army, whose job is to get rid
[00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.250]  of the uppity Americans, and there'll be no hope.
[00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:08.490]  You understand that's not rhetoric.
[00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:13.410]  The people at the top knowingly want to murder your children, okay, with horrible, debilitating
[00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.410]  heart problems.
[00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:19.090]  You know, more than 50% of folks that develop this type of myocarditis are dead within five
[00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.090]  years.
[00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.170]  Something like 70-something percent, look it up, are dead, depending on the study, within
[00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.170]  10 years.
[00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.890]  It's a death sentence of pain.
[00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:32.410]  I personally know three people that are young that took it, the myocarditis, the doctors
[00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:39.730]  have said, you'll be dead within 10 years, dead within 10 years, dead within 10 years,
[00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:47.970]  dead, dead, dead, murder, your government murdering you, murdering you with loving liberalness,
[00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:49.730]  coming to chop your children's penises off.
[00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:54.770]  I mean, this is real, folks, but it's so horrible, see, they think you can't handle it.
[00:23:54.770 --> 00:24:00.010]  Okay, see, I'm digressing, listen to this, Zuckerberg says establishment asked Facebook
[00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.810]  to censor COVID misinfo that ended up to be true, and they knew it was true, and quote,
[00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:09.050]  undermines trust, now no one trusts Facebook, no one trusts the government, no one trusts
[00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.090]  Big Pharma, Fox News, I have the video of him saying it right here.
[00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:14.410]  Oh, that's just two of the articles?
[00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.130]  I told you there's like 15 here?
[00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:21.210]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:27.570]  Secret US government study that only looked at 1000 children, and more than 100 of the
[00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.130]  children suffered seizures.
[00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:40.490]  So there's a little study, and 100 of them had more than 100 had seizures, oh, my goody
[00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.770]  goody gumdrops.
[00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:48.210]  I mean, I'll just be completely honest with you.
[00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:51.610]  If we don't take this government back and put all these people in prison, I think we
[00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:53.610]  kind of deserve maybe they're right.
[00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:54.610]  Maybe I'm on the wrong side.
[00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.010]  Maybe I should go kneel to Bill Gates and say, these people are scum and don't care
[00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:59.010]  about themselves.
[00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.690]  You're right, sir.
[00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:01.690]  Let me join you.
[00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:02.690]  I'll help you kill them.
[00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.210]  Now, I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.850]  But I've actually war game that not that I would ever do it.
[00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:07.850]  I didn't consider it.
[00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:10.450]  I just thought, why do people join them?
[00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.370]  Well, a lot of them are really just sick and twisted and evil, like Bill Gates, he likes
[00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:18.530]  doing all this, and like setting up a psychological system where people are weak minded and go
[00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.530]  along with it.
[00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.210]  So he's the real villain here.
[00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:27.370]  But if the public doesn't have enough life force, or enough common sense to stand against
[00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:33.090]  this and say no to it, then I guess the public deserves to die.
[00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.810]  But you've heard what I've said a million times, the children don't.
[00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.810]  And so God's watching.
[00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:44.930]  But I have to tell you, there is a selfishness in the public where people love to be a victim
[00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:52.010]  of some imaginary mental disorder that the liberals will give you, or oh, the victim
[00:25:52.010 --> 00:26:01.170]  of gender dysphoria, or they love to be the liberal colleges, which is all of them now,
[00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.770]  teach that if a man asks you out at a coffee shop on a date, it's a form of harassment,
[00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:06.770]  you shouldn't do it.
[00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:10.650]  If a convicted pedophile wants to shake their fat belly and pecker in front of your five
[00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.450]  year old, that's a good thing, and they say we're here to groom your kids.
[00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:22.690]  So people are so selfish that they don't want to admit they're under attack, because that'd
[00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.810]  be something they'd have to deal with.
[00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:29.930]  They delusionally decide to just ignore it as the tyranny grows, as the insanity intensifies,
[00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:36.450]  as the monstrous crimes metastasize in front of our faces, and everybody's too busy having
[00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:42.130]  a good time as the infrastructure, and the funds, and all the largess are cut off, as
[00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:45.890]  the third world starves to death, and as the third world's been imported here to be a permanent
[00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:53.090]  underclass, and as we see the rot and collapse all around us, and every metric shows it,
[00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.890]  and now they're really moving in to cut the power off, and the blackouts are starting,
[00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:02.770]  and the fentanyl mass death is intensifying, and every indicator is the dashboard's flashing
[00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:11.490]  red everywhere, alarms everywhere, and they were like, man, I'm going to play golf, Alex,
[00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.010]  we're glad you're fighting them, because we're going to go play golf, and look, I like golf,
[00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:20.010]  I like everything, but, and it's good to play, look, if you were fighting this ten hours
[00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:24.450]  a week, go play golf, or go see a baseball game, but the guys playing golf and playing
[00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:32.010]  baseball all day, or going to NBA games, literally are doing nothing to fight the tyranny, and
[00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.450]  so we're going to lose everything, but at least they're not active leftists trying to
[00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:40.650]  brainwash children, and setting arson fires everywhere, because of course they've arrested
[00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:45.650]  a bunch of leftists who are Antifa, and have leftist backgrounds setting fires, it's only
[00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:51.490]  in the local news, in the west of Canada, in central Canada, in eastern Canada, just
[00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:56.850]  like they arrested over a dozen Antifa members, setting fires all over California, remember,
[00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.570]  in the 2020 election, and it would be in the local news, but if somebody tried to put it
[00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:05.450]  on Facebook, oh, disinfo, you can't say it's Antifa, sure, the fact checkers said they
[00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:12.050]  were Antifa, but no one can prove they were under orders from Antifa to do it, it's like
[00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:18.730]  they arrested a known Mafia henchman, soldier, for committing a murder, and then went, well,
[00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:22.370]  you can't prove his bosses gave the order, you know, they're innocent, of course they
[00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:28.230]  are, I'm fine, so that's where we're at in all this, I mean, there are hundreds and hundreds
[00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.910]  of fires all over Canada, all started the same day, and they're just catching people
[00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:36.190]  running around in black uniforms setting fires everywhere, it's in the news, Greg Rees had
[00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:40.550]  a report on it, but it's just local news, you know, oh, there's just armies of people
[00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:45.430]  setting fires everywhere, because it's the name of the game, shut down society, collapse
[00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:51.950]  civilization, extinction rebellion, is, the animal liberation front is extinction rebellion,
[00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.590]  it's all the same group, all financed by the king of England.

[00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:57.790]  they fund our operation.
[00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:05.430]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had, I don't think anybody can deny
[00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:11.389]  it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us, but when we talk about the crew
[00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:16.150]  at Info Wars, the people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really
[00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:21.350]  have been the MVPs in this fight, and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:26.510]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really
[00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.510]  just incredible.
[00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:31.990]  So, for myself and the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support, and I want
[00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.630]  to encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:37.630]  us.
[00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:40.710]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it,
[00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:45.670]  but most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTore.com, and you never buy great
[00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:49.550]  products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air.
[00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:53.950]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:58.150]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com, our funding problems
[00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:59.150]  will be over.
[00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.430]  Please take action now.
[00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:07.470]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:28.770]  Do you ever wanted to know what the beginning of the end looks like?
[00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:29.770]  Now you do.
[00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.770]  It all got front row seats.
[00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.770]  It's a disintegration of civilization.
[00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:41.770]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:48.770]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:55.770]  Trump says a globalist multinational criminal force using communist techniques of control has seized America.
[00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.770]  That's the 45th president of the U.S. saying it, and he's 100% right.
[00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.770]  No exaggeration, no hyperbole.
[00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:04.770]  If anything, it's worse than he says.
[00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:09.770]  He should have added their devil worshippers and pedophiles, a lot of them.
[00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:14.770]  Senator Josh Hawley, former Attorney General of Missouri, says we have a criminal group that's hijacked the nation,
[00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:21.770]  is planning to set up an authoritarian, totalitarian, permanent dictatorship, and the end of America is here.
[00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:23.770]  It's all true.
[00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:30.770]  Now admitting how much trouble we're in is where we can fix this, and not letting them start a physical civil war.
[00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:32.770]  The average federal bureaucrat, not our enemy.
[00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:34.770]  The average FBI agent, not our enemy.
[00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:37.770]  The police are not our enemy.
[00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:44.770]  The ideology of the globalists and the high-level managers in control are the enemies.
[00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:49.770]  The Barack Obamas, they're puppets like Biden.
[00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.770]  People like Lloyd Austin.
[00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.770]  People like General Milley.
[00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:58.770]  These are sworn globalists, sworn to bring down this country.
[00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.770]  Trump was naive and thought, oh, the military's super patriotic.
[00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.770]  They're the best guys in the country.
[00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:09.770]  No, for 50 years they've been putting their people in, and now at the top, they're almost all bad.
[00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:17.770]  Flynn was all business and never political, and they had no idea because Flynn operated like a robot.
[00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:24.770]  And then when Flynn found out what they were doing, he started to buck them, and then he went and told Trump what was going on,
[00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.770]  and that's why they flipped out, because Flynn knew all the stuff they were up to.
[00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:32.770]  So Flynn got through on them.
[00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:34.770]  He is the exception.
[00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:35.770]  Are there some Flynn's in the government?
[00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:36.770]  Yeah.
[00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.770]  But not many of them at that top level.
[00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:42.770]  Are there a lot of Flynn's at the mid-level?
[00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:51.770]  I'd say a lot, but at the top, the country is hijacked, and we all know that, ladies and gentlemen, and we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:58.770]  And they have been pre-programming that they're going to cut the power and say that it's a cyber attack.
[00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.770]  I don't think they'll blow out the Transformers, because that's too hard to fix,
[00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:08.770]  but they've already pre-programmed that the right wing, the Trump supporters, are going to cut the power,
[00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.770]  with no history of it, no evidence, and when they stand to gain from it.
[00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:16.770]  By the way, I have a stack of news here, and I remember hearing this a few weeks ago
[00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:23.770]  when they blew up that big dam and flooded much of southern Ukraine and the Crimea.
[00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:34.770]  And so, I went and did a little searching last night, and lo and behold, I found a whole stack of news here,
[00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:43.770]  where the Ukrainians said that they'd blown up other dams and that it did a great job to block the Russians,
[00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:49.770]  and so they were going to blow up that dam, and that they'd shot it with missiles and artillery to make sure they could hit it,
[00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:51.770]  and they were planning to blow it up.
[00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.770]  And then once they blew it up, they turned around and said the Russians did it.
[00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:06.770]  I mean, what's crazy is that, remember they just said last year, you're a Russian agent,
[00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:08.770]  if you say there's any bio labs in Ukraine.
[00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:10.770]  Level four bio labs.
[00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.770]  Well, look, we went and got press releases when Obama opened the damn things
[00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:17.770]  and sent the U.S. ambassador to the EU there to cut ribbons on them.
[00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:19.770]  Ten years ago.
[00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:22.770]  Gosh, I guess it was 12 years ago.
[00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:26.770]  So you pull up the New York Times, Biden sends an EU ambassador for ribbon cutting
[00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:32.770]  at bio defense lab that studies the most deadly pathogens in the world,
[00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:38.770]  and then later this year they go, well of course, the Russians are going to get our bio weapon labs.
[00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:43.770]  So it's just all constantly changing, it's all constantly BS,
[00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.770]  and if you've got a memory, you can go see what's really going on.
[00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:49.770]  It's total insanity.
[00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.770]  It's total cuckoo land.
[00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.770]  So I said I'd mention all the stuff coming up today and kind of halfway cover it
[00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:55.770]  and then get back into it.
[00:37:55.770 --> 00:38:00.770]  Huge developments in the Trump indictment, what that signifies, and the coup d'etat.
[00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:01.770]  Big developments there.
[00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:05.770]  Trump appointee, judge will remain judge in the document case.
[00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:08.770]  The federal clerk says the Democrats are going to have her removed.
[00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:12.770]  Zuckerberg says establishment asked Facebook to censor COVID misinfo,
[00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:17.770]  then it'd be true, and then a whole bunch of news about them knowingly killing everybody
[00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:21.770]  and the CDC being part of it, and the CDC reporting on themselves.
[00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:24.770]  And he says, why did they do that?
[00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:25.770]  They hide it in plain view.
[00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.770]  Yeah, we authorized it, we killed a bunch of people, and it doesn't work.
[00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:29.770]  So what?
[00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:35.770]  Huge pedo stack, just insanity with a pride pedo month going on.
[00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:41.770]  Global central bank digital currency is being officially rolled out by the UN.
[00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:46.770]  Southern Poverty Law Center identifying all conservatives and Christians
[00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:51.770]  and anyone that questions lockdowns or open borders as white supremacist terrorists
[00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:55.770]  and running a secret database for the FBI along with the ADL.
[00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:57.770]  So they're the bosses of the FBI.
[00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.770]  They tell them who terrorists are so they can open a file on you.
[00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:04.770]  I mean, just so criminal, so illegal, so sick.
[00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:10.770]  Big stack on wildfires being arson confirmed, but never making national, international news.
[00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.770]  MKUltra news with the death of the Unabomber.
[00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:18.770]  He was also in secret transgender studies there with the CIA.
[00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:20.770]  Can't make that up, got mainstream news on that.
[00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:30.770]  We also have George Soros handing the power to his demon son Alex at 93 to 37 year old.
[00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:34.770]  We also have Al Gore caught in new gigantic lies.
[00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:38.770]  Top Biden administration official admits to lying to Congress.
[00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:39.770]  Of course, won't get any trouble for that.
[00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:42.770]  Fox News and Tucker Carlson's cease and desist letter.
[00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:44.770]  His lawyer responds.
[00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:45.770]  I've got the inside baseball on that.
[00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:46.770]  I'm going to be getting into that.
[00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:56.770]  And we also have how the globalist industrial complex keeps Americans sick, fat and sad.
[00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:59.770]  We're going to be getting to so much more today.
[00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:06.770]  And Chris Sky is going to be joining us as well with some big breaking news out of Canada.
[00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:12.770]  We'll cover the waterfront with him and then I've opened phones in the third hour into the fourth hour today.
[00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:17.770]  But before I go any further, I need funds to operate.
[00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:24.770]  And you notice our bankruptcy isn't in the news anymore because all the lies about us having all this money were just total lies.
[00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:26.770]  Anybody else follow those lies?
[00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:29.770]  You know, they'd have criminal charges filed on them.
[00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:31.770]  But they're the Democrats, the liberals.
[00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:34.770]  They can, you know, they can file the Moon's Medici's if they wanted to in federal court.
[00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:36.770]  But none of it's true.
[00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:37.770]  I had basically no money.
[00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:45.770]  And all that's come out and you can go read the federal filings on Alex Jones and see that all the stuff you heard was a total lie.
[00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.770]  So when I tell you I need funds for free speech systems, we do.
[00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:51.770]  We are barely in the black, barely stabilized.
[00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:58.770]  And I want to hire great reporters that are ready to be hired to come in here and help us take the fight for New World Order 10 times harder.
[00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:02.770]  And we're the most effective organization at battling the globalists in the world, period.
[00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:06.770]  And our talking points and understanding has become the dominant resistance understanding worldwide.
[00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:08.770]  That's a fact, not bragging.
[00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:10.770]  So I pray that you will pray for the broadcast.
[00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:13.770]  And I pray you'll share the articles and videos and clips like you're doing.
[00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:21.770]  And also pray that those of you on the fence that have never gone to Infowarsstore.com, who are the vast majority of you, will experience some of the great products.
[00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:25.770]  See what triiodine, the missing link in your body, does for your whole body.
[00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:27.770]  Learn about iodine deficiency.
[00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:29.770]  Just search it and look at it.
[00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:31.770]  And then get the highest quality at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:35.770]  We're selling out of it, but I've just decided to keep it 25% off until it sells out.
[00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.770]  We have Ultra 12, the highest quality vitamin B12.
[00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:43.770]  We have finally, back in stock, Super Female Vitality.
[00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:45.770]  The Super Male Vitality is selling out.
[00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:52.770]  But I'm selling Super Female Vitality that has a bunch of concentrated known herbs to boost stamina and libido energy for 50% off.
[00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:54.770]  And here's the kicker.
[00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:56.770]  It's the same formula, Super Male Vitality.
[00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:58.770]  But women want a pink label, so you get it.
[00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:00.770]  So it's good for men, good for women.
[00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.770]  It has all the known roots and herbs that are cold-pressed.
[00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:05.770]  You get the full effect.
[00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:07.770]  It's like it's alive.
[00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:10.770]  Instead of being from a dead, dried-up herb, it's still pretty good.
[00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:15.770]  We have dried versions of it that are technically stronger, but aren't as strong because it's not cold-pressed.
[00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:17.770]  This is really amazing.
[00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:19.770]  But it's always affordable.
[00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:21.770]  Now it's a deal.

[00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:33.770]  Super Male Vitality has almost sold out.
[00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:34.770]  It's 25% off.

[00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:11.770]  Hey, what's better? Knockout.
[00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:13.770]  What's better? Down-and-out.
[00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:15.770]  What's better? Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:21.770]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:24.770]  So one person might like this coffee.
[00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:26.770]  Another person likes that coffee.
[00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:28.770]  That's how our bodies work. They're all very diverse.
[00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:33.770]  But we've been able to private label a national best-seller that's been sold for many years that people love.

[00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:05.770]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:08.770]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:16.770]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:19.770]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:22.770]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:25.770]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:30.770]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury.
[00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:33.770]  Who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:40.770]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product.
[00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:42.770]  And dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:47.770]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.770]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:53.770]  And a remedy to this madness.

[00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:24.770]  Trump on the front.

[00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:29.770]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:32.770]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:34.770]  We also have Alex Yeltsin for president.
[00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:36.770]  No, I'm not running for president.
[00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:38.770]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:40.770]  Red, white, and blue.
[00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:42.770]  Alex Yeltsin for president.
[00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:44.770]  It's a fun conversational piece.
[00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:46.770]  And a limited edition shirt.
[00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:48.770]  Great way to fund the operation.

[00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:32.770]  It works great. But women like pink labels.
[00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:34.770]  Men like different color labels.
[00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:36.770]  So it works for men as well.
[00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:38.770]  It's the same formula.

[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:05.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.120]  History repeats.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.120]  Over and over again.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:33.120]  But if you add all the new technologies and weaponry into the equation, it's going to be very dangerous.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.120]  Extremely lethal. Beyond explosive.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:45.120]  The New World Order, with all these weapons and all this technology, is going to try feudalism.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.120]  Neo-feudalistic fascism.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:55.120]  On the top, communism is an implementation system with a technocracy on the bottom.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:01.120]  So I've already mentioned and covered a lot of the news, but I really want to drill into a lot of this.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.120]  So let me do this.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:16.120]  I'm going to talk with Chris Sky about the Trump indictment, because it ties into what the politicians and deep shit are doing there to political dissidence in Canada.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:22.120]  We'll do that next hour with him and get into the arson fires and the next big pandemic they're planning.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:26.120]  Because Chris is really good at predicting things very well.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.120]  Particularly skilled at it.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.120]  I'd say almost as skilled as I am.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.120]  And that's, I think, saying quite a bit.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:36.120]  But I think the listeners are just as skilled as both of us when it comes down to it.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.120]  Once you know the enemy's modus operandi and what they do.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:46.120]  Then I'm going to get into all the leptist pedo operations that are just mind-blowing.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.120]  I mean, it's moving quicker than I thought it would.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:52.120]  It's fascinatingly disgusting.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:56.120]  But I'm going to talk about the real reasons they're coming after our children.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:03.120]  I mean, there's a spiritual bedrock reason at its core, but the different corollary reasons that that's happening.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:10.120]  That's all coming up and it ties into the world government, central bank, digital currency and the ESGs and more.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.120]  But let's go ahead and just drill into this now.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.120]  Let's go ahead and drill into this now.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:22.120]  And then the Ukrainians saying that they were going to blow the dam up is fascinating.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.120]  And they're now saying the Russians did it.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.120]  Even though the Ukrainians have all the motives.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.120]  It's like Biden.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.120]  We're going to blow up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.120]  They're saying the Russians did it.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.120]  It's just next level.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.120]  But it's about rubbing our faces in it.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:41.120]  But like I said, I went back and found the articles in the New York Times and places where they were like,
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:48.120]  the brave Ukrainians already blew up one dam and now they're going to blow up the next to flood the Russians for part of their grand offensive.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:52.120]  And then they went, you know, actually, it doesn't look good flooding all these villagers.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.120]  Let's just say the Russians did it.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.120]  Yeah.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:59.120]  And then send out a bunch of news crews to show Ukrainians saving dogs and cats that are drowning.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.120]  I mean, it's just so ridiculous.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:06.120]  And the Ukrainians are so undisciplined.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:13.120]  They'll have a film crew behind the person with the camera shooting that and they release that themselves showing it scripted.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.120]  I mean, it's just amateur hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:20.120]  And the Russians are amateur hour, too.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:23.120]  It's a disaster leading to Armageddon if it doesn't stop.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:32.120]  A Slavic civil war with a bunch of weird little vampire bats like McCain.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:39.120]  And he's now dead in his many mean running around salivating Lindsey Graham over this death and destruction.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.120]  That's all coming up.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.120]  But let's spend a few minutes on these little jewels.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:51.120]  Joe Rogan really got upset last week several times.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:54.120]  And just the versions I saw on Twitter had like 18 million views.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.120]  So pretty devastating to the establishment there.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.120]  And we can play the clip if you'd like.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:09.120]  But he just came out and said, how dare them say still that the covid shot protects you from the shot, lessens infection and lessens death.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:12.120]  When all the studies say it increases infection and death.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:15.120]  And then he and then Joe starts showing the studies on air.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:20.120]  And then notice they don't even dare say he's wrong now because they know damn well he's right.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.120]  They just hope you don't go.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.120]  Look, see, that's victory right there now.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:26.120]  Now they don't say we're lying.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.120]  They just shut their filthy, murderous mouths.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:34.120]  But there's a third group trying to extricate itself.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:38.120]  Like the Planned Parenthood lady in the main vaccine spokeswoman, that Asian lady, I forget her name.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:42.120]  A whole bunch of these people have come out and said, oh, no, no, I'm not part of this.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:49.120]  Like Redfield. Zuckerberg says establishment asked Facebook to censor covid misinfo that ended up true.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:57.120]  He says it undermines trust and no one believes the government or Big Pharma anymore and that they need to not get it wrong next time.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:59.120]  Oh, yeah, it was all a big mistake.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:08.120]  He censored 18 million posts on saying the shot didn't protect you, saying it was tied to microcarditis, saying it was never properly approved,
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:15.120]  saying that there were therapeutics like vitamin D3 or ivermectin.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.120]  Yeah, that's what they censored and helped kill a bunch of people.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:22.120]  Zuckerberg. And now he knows it's a giant disaster for the establishment.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:26.120]  And he's saying, I'm not part of it, OK?
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.120]  Come out about everything and you can be forgiven.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.120]  Maybe you are a real boy. Maybe you have a heart and a soul.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:33.120]  I don't want to just hate you, Zuckerberg.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.120]  I know the ADL's called for you to be put in prison because you didn't fully bow to them.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.120]  So maybe you're not all bad.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:44.120]  Show us. Establishment asked Facebook to censor true covid posts.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.120]  Fox News Infowars dot com.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:49.120]  Go watch the video if you want.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:56.120]  Joe Rogan defends the Gateway Pundit discusses report on Cleveland Clinic peer reviewed study on covid vaccine versus infection rate.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.120]  His mainstream media won't take on Joe.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.120]  They'll take on like the Gateway Pundit.
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.120]  Oh, look, this obscure site, which is bigger than The New York Times online.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.120]  Most of the time, there's some days.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.120]  What is this big?
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:10.120]  They're sitting there showing peer reviewed study showing this.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.120]  So the media attack them.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.120]  And Joe goes, no, that's not true.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:15.120]  Here's the study.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.120]  It's kind of an oblique attack on Rogan.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.120]  Here's one of the studies.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.120]  Microcarditis reported after M.R.A.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.120]  based covid 19 vaccines in the U.S.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.120]  from December twenty twenty twenty one.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.120]  That's right.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:33.120]  The start of the program found a multi thousand percent increase, including fatal myocarditis.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:38.120]  That's a CDC government study of the M.R.A.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.120]  Pfizer Moderna shots.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.120]  Now they've got a new study just came out reporting the same thing.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:46.120]  But I thought I'd just show everybody the study.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:50.120]  Pull this up yourselves.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.120]  And here's even NBC News.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:55.120]  Oh, small study points to possible case of myocarditis following M.R.A.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.120]  vaccine in young men.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.120]  Oh, really?
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:02.120]  That's why they've had hundreds of deaths when usually one death and all the sports
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.120]  here from heart attacks.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.120]  Big deal.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.120]  Now, hundreds a year.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:09.120]  Yell study reveals insight into post vaccine heart inflammation cases.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.120]  Yahoo News.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.120]  Myocarditis in young males for covid vaccine.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.120]  New studies suggest that may cause the rare heart condition.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.120]  That's not rare anymore.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.120]  What explains the rare heart conditions?
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.120]  That's the spin.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:28.120]  Oh, is that why insurance companies say there's a 46 percent increase in death in World War
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:31.120]  two was like nine percent.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.120]  I'm sorry.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.120]  World War one was nine percent globally.
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.120]  World War two was six percent increase.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:43.120]  This is a 40 some percent increase in death.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:47.120]  Myocarditis, pericarditis incidents.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.120]  Low across 10 million doses of M.R.A.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.120]  vaccines.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.120]  Yes, you read the study.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:55.120]  It says it's high, but that's how they spin it.
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:02.120]  Violent attack faces first German lawsuit over alleged covid vaccine side effects.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.120]  And it goes on and on.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:10.120]  DHS sought to assign social credit style risk scores to social media users that criticize
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.120]  the shots.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.120]  Oh, flashback.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.120]  Moderna knew M.R.A.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:17.120]  vaccine technology was dangerous before covid crisis began.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:22.120]  2017 documents show they said, well, we could make a lot of money with this, but for a small
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:25.120]  percentage of people, it kills them.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.120]  Read it for yourself.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.120]  Here's the actual study.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.120]  Myocarditis cases reported after M.R.A.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:35.120]  based covid-19 vaccine in the U.S.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:38.120]  There's a study right there.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.120]  Here it is.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:45.120]  This is from the Journal of American Medicine.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.120]  Myocarditis cases reported after M.R.A.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.120]  based covid-19 vaccine in the U.S.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.120]  December to 2021.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.120]  New study shows even worse numbers.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.120]  There is the CDC study.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:58.120]  If you want to go read it for yourself.
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.120]  White House mandates masks.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:02.120]  This is for unvaccinated despite emergencies end.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:06.120]  Oh, the emergency supposedly over, but it's never going to be over.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:10.120]  It's how they harass a lot of people that haven't taken the poison shots.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:14.120]  They knew vaccines would hurt some people and tried to fool us.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.120]  Another big report on that.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:19.120]  And of course, they lied about the origin of the shot.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.120]  Another big study.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.120]  More than 100 young children suffered seizures after covid vaccination in a
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:26.120]  study, a small study.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.120]  So a large percent of them had that happen.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:34.120]  And Bill visited Epstein 37 times on Twitter said,
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:37.120]  if Alex Jones has to pay 900 million.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.120]  No, no, no, no.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.120]  It's a 1.5 billion.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:43.120]  Sorry for offering people for offending people with words.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:46.120]  What do the pharmaceutical companies have to pay for actually physically
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.120]  hurting and killing people?
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:52.120]  Well, the folks that put out hillbilly heroin and killed millions paid a
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.120]  couple billion.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.120]  So you got your answer.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.120]  Free speech is what's bad.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:04.120]  Taken out of context and twisted and found guilty by a judge.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.120]  So do I sleep good at night?
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.120]  Absolutely.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.120]  I sleep good at night.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:14.120]  I question every big event from Jesse Smollett to who blew up this dam.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.120]  But see, I'm a Russian agent.
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.120]  If I tell you the Ukrainians blew it up,
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:20.120]  even though I haven't been the New York times saying they were going to blow
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:23.120]  it up.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:26.120]  When they launched their offensive,
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:30.120]  you're supposed to forget that was ever in there and just be a good American
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.120]  and cut your son's penis off.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.120]  That's how you prove you're a good American.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.120]  Do what Alex Soros says and cut your daughter's breast off.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.120]  Take your children to drag queen pedophile time.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:42.120]  Take fentanyl and die.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:43.120]  Hell Satan.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.120]  Actually don't help Satan.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:45.120]  Jesus Christ.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.120]  We'll be right back.

[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.120]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:18.120]  Then our Brain Force Plus is a good basic clean new tropic.

[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:43.120]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:46.120]  And the answer for energy is Brain Force.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:52.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.120]  is a historic book that documents the globals in their own words,
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:57.120]  planned for our future.
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.120]  That is the hellish future.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:02.120]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:05.120]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:08.120]  at bookstores, Amazon, or infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.120]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:14.120]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.120]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:19.120]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.120]  a signed copy, at infowarsstore.com.

[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:29.120]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:32.120]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.120]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book,
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.120]  or unsigned copies.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:40.120]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarsstore.com
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:43.120]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:46.120]  and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.

[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:57.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.120]  This is the moment.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.120]  They told them, Don't you ever come around here.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.120]  Don't want to see your face, you better disappear.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.120]  The fires in their eyes and their words aren't really clear.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.120]  So beat it. Just beat it.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.120]  You better run, you better do what you can.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.120]  Don't want to see no blood, don't be a macho man.
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:09.120]  The left listens to Joe. Here is Joe talking about what a joke the criminal Biden's crime syndicate is.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:12.120]  What's this? What is Biden doing?
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:17.120]  He fell down again? Yeah. Is this today? Yeah.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.120]  Okay. I can't. I can't anymore.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.120]  Well, here's the sad thing, man. And I say this because, look, my dad was 70 when I was born.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.120]  My dad was an old man. Yeah.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.120]  So I grew up around a lot of, like, environments where some of the people would take advantage of my dad because he was old.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.120]  But he just fell. He didn't even fall for a reason.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.120]  Right. But it's just not fair. Like, at a certain point, you can't.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.120]  It's not cool for old. It's not cool to old people to do that to them.
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.120]  No. Like, he doesn't know this is happening to him.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.120]  Yeah, but he kind of does. And he's kind of a.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.120]  Well, that could be true. But he doesn't know.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.120]  He's always been a.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:54.120]  Oh, you go back and listen to that guy lying about his his education record and lying about his accomplishments.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.120]  And he's always been a problem. Yeah.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:05.120]  And also the stuff with his son and the ties to Ukraine and China and the money, the family, they got paid millions of dollars.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:08.120]  And everyone's trying to obscure it because, well, better than Trump, better than Trump.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:12.120]  If that guy was a Republican, they would be up his microscope.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.120]  I know it is unbelievable.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:21.120]  But he represents the what they thought was like a sane alternative to what President Trump was.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.120]  Yeah, they thought this is insane.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.120]  Donald Trump is the president.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.120]  Anything's better than him.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.120]  And so they went with this corrupt career politician.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.120]  Yeah, I mean, it's wild stuff, man.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.120]  They even got the FBI involved in telling Twitter to censor the information about the laptop.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.120]  It's crazy.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.120]  But how do we get out of that space?
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:42.120]  How do we because we're starting to turn into one of those kind of like Central American countries where the government is so comp.
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.120]  Like, it's crazy.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:48.120]  It used to be a long time ago, like if the secrets of our country got out, like during Watergate or whatever.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.120]  Right. People were like, no.
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.120]  But now if the secrets get out, people are like, yes, tell us what's going.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.120]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.120]  It's interesting how that's kind of changed.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:05.120]  Like, yeah, before it would be like if any like top secret documents or whatever were released, it would seem like wrong.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.120]  Well, but now if they're released, we want to know what it's like.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.120]  Does that make any sense?
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:17.120]  Well, when was top secret documents released that are showing that someone is behaving in an illegal way where it's bad?
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.120]  I mean, Watergate, that was what Watergate was all about.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.120]  Yeah, they found out that Nixon was spying.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:26.120]  I mean, I think the problem is that, first of all, the media is overwhelmingly left leaning.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:34.120]  And if you have a left leaning politician or a left wing Democratic politician, and then you have this media that essentially works to support that person.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:43.120]  I mean, they ignore any information that leads to distrust in the government or distrust in this administration or distrust in this party, this political party.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.120]  Yeah, it's a dark arts, man.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.120]  It is a dark.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.120]  That's the real dark arts.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:53.120]  Now, for our listeners, you're like, yeah, tell us something we knew 25 years ago.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.120]  But for the main line, this is they're waking up.
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:59.120]  So the learning curve is very quick.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.120]  It's not just liberal bias.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:07.120]  It's multinational corporations posing as, quote, liberals.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.120]  They want to end parental rights.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:12.120]  They want to end the right over your body.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.120]  COVID ends the right over your body if they get what they want.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:24.120]  The whole transgender, quote, gay stuff is about the state and the teachers having control of your children's body.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.120]  In fact, I sent you guys a meme yesterday that Elon Musk tweeted.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.120]  You can pull it back out of the stack or just just reprint.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.120]  It'll be easier.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.120]  It's an Elon feed.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.120]  And it shows a doctor looking at a woman who's nine months pregnant.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.120]  And she says, is it a boy or a girl?
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:46.120]  The doctor says, we're going to let your kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten teacher, decide whether it's a boy or girl.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.120]  I mean, let that sink in.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:51.120]  This is the state literally messing with the identity of your child.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.120]  It's a total power grab.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.120]  Chris Sky is our guest.
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.120]  Stay with us.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:59.120]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:05.120]  A lot of people have asked me, why is M4 store and M4's life not in a probiotic for more than three years?
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.120]  The answer is simple.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.120]  We only bring you the highest quality to lowest prices.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:14.120]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for the seven years.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:20.120]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:26.120]  Finally, we've got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.

[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:14.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.120]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:25.120]  All right.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.120]  We've got the president federally indicted, basically a coup over the country, total insanity.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:34.120]  We've got massive developments with the Ukrainian defensive getting wiped out.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.120]  We've got a major world government, new world digital currency announcements.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.120]  All this is going on.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:42.120]  We have pedo rings all over the Western world saying your children belong to us.
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:49.120]  And the video of children in elementary school and in high school in D.C., in New York, in California,
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:55.120]  being told you'll be sent to the principal or I'll call the police or I'll put you in in-school suspension for a year.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:01.120]  If you don't watch dudes and girls make out and if you don't, I mean, just totally grooming
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.120]  and the young people are like, leave us alone.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.120]  Stop.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.120]  This is weird.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:10.120]  It'd be weird if they said, now let's watch a video of a girl and a guy making out.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:13.120]  You'd be like, why is my teacher showing me this?
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:22.120]  Because it's a corporate agenda to come and destroy your identity and to tie your sexual identity to this sex cult, to this gang.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.120]  It's psychological warfare.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:29.120]  But I got Chris Sky on because he is being persecuted.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:35.120]  And what's happening to him is the communist globalist playbook.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.120]  Put somebody in jail who's popular.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:43.120]  Now, Chris is also a businessman and a very successful contractor.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.120]  And that's why he's a smart guy.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.120]  He actually lives in the real world.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:53.120]  And he's the most vocal, effective person in Canada battling what is now recognized as the tyranny of Trudeau.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:58.120]  Tucker, a few months ago, said we need to liberate Canada from the authoritarianism.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.120]  I mean, Trudeau said, I want to be a dictator.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.120]  I love dictatorship.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.120]  I love basic.
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.120]  I love G.G.P.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:10.120]  He only got 30 percent of the vote, but manipulated it with the parliament to stay in power.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:16.120]  And the police force is running over people and a year in jail for peaceful protesters over lockdowns.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:22.120]  And now they're announcing they're going to join the Netherlands and Ireland in banning farms and cows and pigs.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:24.120]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:30.120]  We've got the arson, hundreds of fires, satellites showed across the country the same hour set.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:35.120]  And then Trudeau saying he's going to take power using that.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.120]  And he's shut down the farms because of that.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.120]  It's incredible.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:45.120]  But the reason I wanted to get him on is this is breaking news, is they're trying to put him in jail.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:51.120]  And they're banning him from advertising that he's running for mayor of Toronto because they're so scared of him.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:59.120]  This is the same playbook they're using on Trump, the same playbook they've been trying to use on so many members of Congress.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.120]  And it's the same playbook worldwide.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:06.120]  So Chris Scott joining us with breaking news today on what's happening with you.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.120]  And then I want to pick your brain with the U.N. ending the so-called pandemic, claiming a new one's coming,
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:18.120]  what you expect them to pull next because you've been deadly accurate on the enemy's operations.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.120]  OK, well, first of all, like you said, I'm running for mayor.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.120]  They tried to stop me from day one.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:28.120]  But while I was trying to get here from Alberta, my wife and I were arrested in the Edmonton airport
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:31.120]  and banned from flying at the Edmonton airport.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:35.120]  So we had to drive to Calgary just to come here before I even became a nominee.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:40.120]  I was getting threatening emails from Elections Toronto telling me they were going to use selective enforcement
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:44.120]  and even try to prosecute me and throw me in jail if I tried to run.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:50.120]  Once I became a nominee, I even got messages or even not even messages,
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:58.120]  direct mails from the largest law firm in the country representing a certain political party trying to stop me from running.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:04.120]  If that didn't work, they started getting all of my venues to cancel my events on me,
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:10.120]  citing that I was not able to be able to have these events there because I was not the type of person they wanted there.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.120]  I was harassed by the police when I arrived in Toronto.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.120]  I was pulled over while I was already pulled over and given seven citations,
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.120]  including a careless driving charge while I had not even been driving.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.120]  And it just kept getting worse and worse.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:28.120]  They tried to cut off my funding. They tried to slander me.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:33.340]  We just lost his Skype. We're going to get him back on.
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:38.340]  But folks, you have to understand, Canada, according to even international rating groups
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:42.340]  that look at the scale of totalitarianism, is very high now.
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:47.340]  Remember when I went up there to cover Bilderberg, in 2006 they arrested me
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.340]  and they said they were going to put me in the Toronto prison.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:55.340]  And then once the press got involved and said it was wrong, they let me out and I covered the Bilderberg meeting.
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:11:01.340]  Now, all these years later, 17, 18 years later, it's way worse than it ever was.
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:04.340]  And it's completely out of control.
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:09.340]  So what's happening in Canada, Klaus Schwab says, is the blueprint for the rest of the world.
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:14.340]  So that's why Canada is as bad as Australia.
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.340]  So Chris, can I continue?
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:19.340]  Well, yes, that's why I was running for mayor of Toronto.
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:22.340]  Because Toronto is like the crown jewel in the World Economic Forum agenda.
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:26.340]  And they want to use their 15-minute city global carbon allowance
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.340]  and all the rest of their digital ID, digital currency agenda to enslave us,
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:33.340]  starting here and spreading it out throughout Canada and the U.S.
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:35.340]  And that's why I came in to stop them.
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:39.340]  And as I was saying, the government-funded media is literally owned and controlled.
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:43.340]  So anybody that they put on the media, the so-called top six candidates,
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:46.340]  the only ones they put in their polls, the only ones they talk about,
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:49.340]  the only ones that get covered, the only ones that are invited to debates,
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:53.340]  these candidates are also controlled, just like the media.
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:57.340]  They will not allow me to participate in their debates.
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:01.340]  They will not allow me to advertise on TV, radio, bus.
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:04.340]  And by the way, Chris, this is not hyperbole.
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:08.340]  For folks that don't know, and Biden's been proposing that here.
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:12.340]  Remember when Drudge was on like 10 years ago or 9 years ago or whatever it was, 8 years ago,
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:16.340]  he said this is what he was told by Clarence Thomas that the future was going to be.
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:21.340]  And it's where it's not just PBS or NPR that are government-funded.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:25.340]  All of the old corporate media get giant government funding.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:28.340]  In Canada it's billions, it's going to be tens of billions here.
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:31.340]  And then only they are the approved select groups.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:35.340]  So Google this year in the U.S. is starting a trusted media system
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:38.340]  with only 150 media sources that it will allow to be shown.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.340]  And so there's a fight in Canada right now.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:43.340]  We're going to skip the break to give Chris more time.
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:47.340]  There's a fight in Canada right now where Facebook is starting to shut down there
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:51.340]  because the government's going to make Facebook and Google pay the government
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.340]  to then pay trusted media.
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:57.340]  But then only trusted media is then authorized to have debates
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:59.340]  and they choose what candidates to show.
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:04.340]  So they're like off-sourcing the censorship and control
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:07.340]  and really turning the media not just into state-run media,
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:12.340]  but then arbiters and controllers of elections and of vote tabulation.
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:16.340]  So when I say Canada is the model, folks, it is the damn model.
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:19.340]  Listen to this because there's this instinct, particularly of Americans,
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:21.340]  and I love Americans, I'm an American.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:23.340]  But we have the lowest level of passports,
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:26.340]  we have the lowest level of any industrialized country for traveling.
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:28.340]  We don't get how little the world is.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:31.340]  You can fly around the world in like 25 hours.
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:35.340]  You can fly to Australia in 16, 17, Tokyo.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.340]  So understand me, people.
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:41.340]  You can fly to Moscow in 10 from Austin, Texas, 10 or 11 hours.
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:46.340]  Understand that what's coming for you is Canada like next year.
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:48.340]  So listen to him.
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.340]  I'm sorry to interrupt, Chris, but listen to him.
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:52.340]  Listen to what he's saying.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:53.340]  And I'm not being aggressive here.
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:55.340]  I'm not mad at the listeners.
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:59.340]  I'm saying do you understand that this is invaluable information?
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:01.340]  Because the average person goes, well, I don't care what happens in Canada.
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:02.340]  Screw them.
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:04.340]  Well, they're our neighbors.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.340]  We get our energy from them.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:06.340]  They're nice people.
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:08.340]  We should care what happens to the Chinese in China.
[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:11.340]  You should really care about Canada because it's the damn model.
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:12.340]  Chris, I'm going to shut up.
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:13.340]  I'm sorry.
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:14.340]  Go ahead.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:18.340]  So the media, as we know, is controlled.
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:20.340]  The media, as we know, has bad meat.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:23.340]  And they wanted to take it a step further.
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:30.340]  So I was working with the head of the Daily Bread Food Bank who hosted the official debate.
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:34.340]  And we were working together for a couple weeks, and we came to terms to host a second
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:37.340]  debate that was going to have me as a candidate as well as many other candidates.
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:40.340]  It was going to be nationally televised and everything.
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:43.340]  Because he told me, and we have the correspondence.
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:46.340]  This is driving me crazy.
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:49.340]  Not only is the Skype keeps cutting out.
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.340]  That's why I'm talking over him.
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:53.340]  But it's done it again.
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.340]  But it's OK.
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.340]  If we have to, just get him on the phone next time.
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:58.340]  We need to create just a rundown here.
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:00.340]  Or maybe do Zoom or something.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:02.340]  The Skype's not working.
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:07.340]  At a certain point, we're going to have to reassess this and just not keep doing the same thing.
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:10.340]  Because the definition of insanity is the same thing happening over and over again.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:12.340]  And by the way, we haven't gotten to that point yet.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:13.340]  It's not the crew's fault.
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.340]  It's just this technology.
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:17.340]  It's really magic we can see people anywhere around the world.
[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:22.340]  But I think it's emblematic of how he's being censored and is now being arrested.
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:23.340]  Been arrested.
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:24.340]  He's going to get to that in a moment.
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.340]  And why they arrested him.
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:28.340]  With no evidence or no proof.
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:32.340]  In Canada, someone just has to say that you threatened to hurt them.
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:35.340]  And then with no proof, you get put in jail.
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:37.340]  And then you get manned everywhere.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:40.340]  And the person with no proof never gets in trouble.
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:49.340]  Similar to how roughly half of the rape allegations in the United States turn out to be 100% false.
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:50.340]  All right.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:51.340]  Let's try it again, Chris.
[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:52.340]  This is critical info.
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.340]  Continue.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:56.340]  This is very critical info.
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:58.340]  This was a very important event.
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:05.340]  It was going to legitimize myself and other candidates as other top candidates and other viable candidates to vote for.
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:10.340]  And after everything was approved and ready to go, and we even had the moderator and rules in place,
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:18.340]  I got a message from the CEO of the Daily Bread Food Bank who informed me that the board of directors had said they did not have the resources to do the debate.
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.340]  So it was canceled from up above.
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:25.340]  I told him I was going to expose this story for the corruption it was.
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:26.340]  All right.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:32.800]  All right, three times the charm, get him on the phone, I'm making the call.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:33.800]  No more.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:34.800]  All right.
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.800]  We're gonna get Chris on.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:36.800]  He's such a great guy.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.460]  Obviously, where he is on the road is not having the best Skype here.
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:46.600]  But folks, this is really a big, big, big deal.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:50.440]  I can't wait to pick his brain about the forest fires, about everything else.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.960]  But Chris, if it cuts out again, this reminds me of like the talk shows where the caller
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:59.480]  calls in and then the prank caller keeps saying, hello, hello, hello, and they keep saying,
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.280]  hello, hello, hello.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:07.200]  We're gonna get you on telephone here so that this doesn't happen anymore.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.120]  We're gonna get Chris Skye on telephone right now.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:22.360]  But there is a model worldwide of the control that the system is bringing in.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:27.880]  And what's so frustrating to me is I'm not the smartest guy around.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:32.120]  I'm not the most well-organized guy around.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:40.320]  But I see full-grown adult men that know everything about Marvel and DC Comics, and they get so
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:46.480]  excited about going and seeing these children's movies that are badly done, that look like
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:52.800]  CGI video games, and they literally archetypally think what a man does is watch Marvel Comics
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:53.800]  movies.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.440]  And I'm not putting you down if you like it or think it's entertaining and you don't have
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.440]  fun with it.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:01.840]  And then it's like guys that only care about sports don't care about actual New World Order
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:08.000]  poisoning the shots, Kim trailing, setting up world government, dissolving the borders,
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.760]  enslaving the general population, coming after you.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.280]  And I mean, this is like a real fight, coming after our children to sexualize them.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.280]  Pedophile armies.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:22.800]  And the average man's like, sorry, I'm gonna watch sports and Marvel Comics.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.560]  And it's just, it's disgusting.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:30.000]  And I'm not saying you're bad if you've watched a Marvel comic on your own airplane or something.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  I did that the other day.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  It's just so ridiculous.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  It's good.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.080]  I mean, it was just, it's so cheesy.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.840]  But I know a lot of men that just love it and think it's like the real world and know
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:42.800]  everything about the characters, these imaginary universes and about these villains.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.780]  We have real villains that make Marvel villains look like lightweights that are actually killing
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:50.880]  and enslaving us and setting up world systems of control.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.160]  Do you as a man like being enslaved?
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:57.560]  Do you like having your future taken?
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.560]  It's arrested development.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:18:59.560]  All right.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.560]  We got him on phone.
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:01.560]  Without further ado.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:02.560]  We've certainly built this up.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.560]  Chris, guys, start over.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.040]  So you're already contender.
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.240]  You're very popular.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.240]  You're running for office.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.080]  They're scared.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:14.120]  And now suddenly this national debate you were setting up was gonna be all over the country
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:19.200]  because Toronto's, you know, the unofficial capital there, you know, obviously it's Ottawa,
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.680]  but that's nearby, just the West a few miles.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.520]  And so now things get really crazy.
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:26.560]  Just like they're trying to take Trump out with criminal charges.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:27.560]  Tell us what happened to you.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.560]  Okay.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.560]  So as soon as I told the CEO of the Daily Bread Food Bank, which has huge connections
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:38.720]  politically that I was going to expose them, which would expose the entire media apparatus
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:43.640]  for exactly what you said, being an arbitrator of this election, trying to pick and choose
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.160]  who is a viable candidate, who people are even eligible to vote for.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.600]  Well, guess what?
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.600]  I got a call.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:55.320]  And as of tomorrow, I got to go and turn myself into the police because I'm being arrested
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.080]  for the 27th time.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:03.320]  I'm being charged for the 73rd time and I'm going to be put in jail and I'm going to have
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:06.920]  to make bail and I'm going to have to get out and I'm going to have to clear my name
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.120]  once again.
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:14.200]  And they're doing all this because they don't want me to expose how controlled the media
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:19.120]  is, how the government, the media are one and the same apparatus.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:25.180]  And the so-called top candidates that they're putting on the media are also controlled and
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:27.120]  part of the same apparatus.
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.200]  And if people really want change, the only way they're going to get it is if they vote
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:36.480]  for me, because I'm the only one that's talking about any of it.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:41.320]  I'm the only one that's talking about SOGI, sexual orientation and gender identity and
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.480]  how dangerous it is for our children.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.720]  I'm the only one talking about the agenda that you've been trying to expose on this
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:49.080]  whole on this whole show.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:53.720]  And when I brought it up in a debate just the other day with so-called front runners
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:21:00.080]  Mitzi Hunter and Josh Matlow debating against me at the Tropicana Center in Scarborough,
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.320]  the guy was called an anti-LGBT bigot.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:07.640]  And Josh Matlow spent his last 30 seconds not trying to convince the people to vote
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:11.240]  for him, but trying to convince the people not to vote for me.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:16.120]  That shows me that the so-called top contendents see me as a threat.
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.080]  They don't want to be in the same room as me.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:20.200]  They don't definitely want to debate me.
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:27.040]  And they rely on the government and the media to insulate them and provide them these scripted,
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:34.480]  pathetic, pretend debates and all these other pre-scripted, pre-planned events where they
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.520]  don't even get the support of the people.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:40.080]  But they do get the support of the media, and in this country they believe that's enough
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.320]  to sway voters.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:45.640]  We also uncovered that there are now, and this is the first time ever in the history
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:54.680]  of elections in Canada and probably anywhere, 300,000 newly registered voters just for this
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:55.560]  by-election.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.840]  From 6.6 million to 1.9 million voters.
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:04.720]  And this is the first time that they're going to have mail-in voting eligible for hundreds
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.520]  and hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:10.800]  So they're literally setting up the script for the same type of mail-in voter fraud as
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.480]  they did with Biden and Trump.
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:16.840]  They're literally setting up the script to have me arrested and dragged through the mud
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:21.560]  to try to prevent my campaign from being successful, and to try to basically just throw me, get
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.880]  me off the board, as they say.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.760]  So as always, I will persevere.
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:29.760]  As always, the people will rally behind me.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:37.120]  And on June 26th, the best thing every single one of you can do is get out and vote.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:42.000]  They want the seniors to believe that I'm not the only one that's going to lower their
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  taxes.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  That's the reality.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  I'm the only one that's going to have a fiscally responsible swing on top of it.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.640]  Obviously, if Canadians want to get and stop the tyranny and stop the next lockdown and
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:55.080]  stand up against the police state and everything, they should vote for you 110 percent.
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.080]  You're right.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.760]  They're so panicked that they've just brought in all these fake new ballots because they're
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.880]  running the same program worldwide.
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:04.520]  People need to go to the site where you've got a couple sites.
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:08.400]  What is the best place for people to go find out everything about your run for mayor there
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.400]  in Toronto?
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.400]  ChrisSkyForChange.com.
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:11.400]  ChrisSkyForChange.com.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.400]  That's our site.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.400]  You can see our platform.
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:14.400]  You can find out where I'm going to be.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:15.400]  You can donate.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.400]  Even if you're not from Ontario, you can't donate to the election campaign.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:17.400]  But since I just got arrested, I'm going to have a legal fund and all kinds of other places
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.400]  where anybody in the world is eligible to donate to if they want to stand up to this
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.400]  tyranny.
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:20.400]  And by the way, expand on what you told me on the phone last night or your messages.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.400]  This has been done to you before.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:22.400]  An anonymous person says you've threatened them.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.400]  And then they say, no, I'm not going to do that.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:24.400]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.400]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.400]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.400]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:28.400]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.400]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:30.400]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.400]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:49.240]  That's exactly it.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:55.340]  This person sent a text message where I literally said I'm going to expose you for corruption
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:59.720]  and then followed it up saying that I called them and threatened them on the phone.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:00.720]  That wasn't recorded.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:06.680]  The threat wasn't recorded, but actual contrary evidence where I didn't threaten him was
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:07.680]  recorded.
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:13.040]  So all it takes for me to get arrested is for any random person to call the police and
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:17.440]  say Chris guy said this or Chris guy did this and I will get arrested.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.640]  I will get charged.
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.240]  I will have to make bail.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.640]  I will have to pay all the legal fees and I'll have my name dragged through the mud for months
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.360]  if not years to get myself cleared of the ridiculous.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.560]  I'm not going to get into it.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:32.720]  But I'm not going to get into it, but about two months ago, somebody filed in the local
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:38.660]  Austin court a totally fake report, just totally insane.
[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:44.920]  And then the judge demanded we respond to it to an anonymous report of somewhere I wasn't
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:50.080]  at, didn't do, but, but said, I want to know what you're, I mean, these people are out
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:51.080]  of control.
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.080]  They are totally insane.
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.620]  Now, obviously there's big news around the world.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:58.480]  It's important what you're doing there, but you've been really a great activist, not just
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.040]  for Canadians, but around the world.
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:03.740]  You've been dead on predicting two and a half years ago, three years ago, what they would
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:06.600]  do next with the lockdowns, with the shots.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.360]  What are you predicting now they're going to do around the world and just big picture
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.680]  with their central bank, digital currencies, their ESG's and more very, very quickly.
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:16.680]  I'll tell you.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:21.680]  Well, we already know in 2019, before the 2020, where they declared the COVID emergency
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:27.080]  in Canada, they declared a climate emergency and may 2022, while we were still under lockdown
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:33.560]  for COVID, they acted a new zoning bylaw, which is all 15 minute city, all under the
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:36.160]  guise of fighting climate change, every new development.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:41.040]  So I've been showing people how the 15 minute cities are coming with the new developments
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:45.840]  where it's mixed use, where you're supposed to live, work and play all in the same building.
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:51.880]  And I showed a place where they had 500 residences plus office buildings, plus commercial retail.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:56.280]  And they only had two car parking for the entire complex.
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.840]  But they had 500 bike parking.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.840]  Why?
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:00.240]  Because they don't want you in a car.
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.240]  Why?
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:04.920]  Because they're going to start talking about how you have to track your carbon footprint
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:08.960]  and limit your carbon footprint, just like the mayor of New York limited the amount
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:13.280]  of meat people can have at public institutions and just how they wanted to start tracking
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.820]  your groceries for your carbon footprint.
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:18.120]  They're going to be doing that same push everywhere.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.320]  And they're going to be coming after your children at fever pitch.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:30.360]  They want to use this LGBT pronoun 76 gender agenda to take control away from the parents
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:36.400]  and confuse, pervert, sexualize children and make them wards of the state.
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.040]  If you can say if you look at the LGBT, by the way, I want you to get back to that in
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.040]  a moment.
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:46.380]  But just to back you up in the US, in areas in the UK and Europe, you now try to go to
[01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:47.380]  grocery stores.
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:53.900]  You say no one can use cash or even a credit card or even a debit card or even your smartphone.
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:56.900]  You must register with a QR code within to buy and sell.
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:59.660]  So they are bringing the central bank digital currency in.
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:01.340]  It is happening right now.
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:03.340]  But get back to the literal assault on our children.
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:05.300]  We're going to cover that more after the break.
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:10.380]  But I mean, this is this is the deep state global corporate program literally going after
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:17.180]  parental rights and to form a weird psychological state connection to your child who they will
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:21.660]  then shine up under their prerogative to be basically taken from the parents.
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:22.660]  That's it.
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:27.020]  It's about it's about making the state the number one influence in the child's life.
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.020]  Why?
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:32.100]  If you look at the LGBT community, number one, they are the most compliant with the government.
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:35.220]  They had the largest uptake for vaccinations for covid.
[01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:37.160]  They had the largest compliance with math.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:41.180]  They trust the government because they create a special protected minority class for them.
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:42.380]  So why wouldn't they?
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:48.420]  The other thing is LGBT members of the community spend an average of over one point five million
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:54.420]  dollars more than so-called cisgenders of the community on big pharma over their lifetime.
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:28:00.420]  So for every one million new children you create into that community, you've just created
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:07.140]  one point five trillion dollars worth of revenue for big pharma over the next few decades.
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:12.220]  And that's why if you look at so-called gender clinics in the year 2000, there was maybe
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.660]  two or three in the entire North America.
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:16.660]  Now there's hundreds.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:17.660]  Why?
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:21.780]  Because they are actively doing everything they can to create this.
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:27.620]  And that's what this new curriculum in Canada is called SOGI, sexual orientation and gender
[01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:28.620]  identity.
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:33.580]  And it is 100 percent about sexualizing, confusing and perverting children.
[01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:34.580]  Guys, stay there.
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:35.580]  Chris, guys, stay there.
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:38.740]  And we're going to see you in the ring and we can mess with your computer, maybe close
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:42.220]  some functions on a different wireless network, see if we can get you back on video, but it's
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:43.220]  great to have you audio-wise.
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:47.220]  I want to go through this big move against our children that's being run by the U.N.
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:51.100]  and big corporations globally, what Tulsi Gabbard's had to say and more.
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:53.180]  But this thing is in high gear, folks.
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:54.180]  Stay with us.
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:54.820]  We'll be right back with Chris Skye.
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:05.020]  A lot of people have asked me, why is MFulware's store and MFulware's life not at a probiotic for more than three years?
[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:09.020]  The answer is simple. We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:13.020]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:19.020]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:25.020]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:29.020]  We're able to private label it under MFulware's MD as our probiotic formula.

[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:14.020]  So I get constant questions online in person. Hey, what's better? Knockout. What's better? Down and out. What's better?
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:16.020]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:22.020]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:26.020]  So one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:29.020]  That's how our bodies work. They're all very diverse.
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:34.020]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love

[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:06.020]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:11.020]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:15.020]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:18.020]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:21.020]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:26.020]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:30.020]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:35.020]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:40.020]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface,
[01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:46.020]  our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:52.020]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:59.020]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:08.020]  I want to say brain force is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is.
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:12.020]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:16.020]  The fish oil is better than it. And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:21.020]  Fish oil is liquid energy. Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:24.020]  Krill oil is the best. And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:27.020]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:30.020]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:32.020]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:35.020]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:37.020]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:43.020]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:49.020]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess,
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:53.020]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:55.020]  InfoWarsStore.com
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:58.020]  InfoWarsStore.com
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:04.020]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:06.020]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.150 --> 01:33:27.150]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:27.150 --> 01:33:29.150]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:29.150 --> 01:33:34.150]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.150 --> 01:33:42.150]  Alright, the severity of the situation cannot be overstated.
[01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:49.150]  I made a little sub-film before Dr. Michael Kaupman, who was a big part of Endgame that I made in 2007, died,
[01:33:49.150 --> 01:33:53.150]  called Endgame 1.5, because I was planning to make Endgame 2.
[01:33:53.150 --> 01:34:00.150]  And he showed a bunch of documents in the 60s and 70s where major universities in the UK and the US
[01:34:00.150 --> 01:34:03.150]  said to depopulate people, we have to end the nuclear family.
[01:34:03.150 --> 01:34:07.150]  To do that, we're going to promote homosexuality and transgenderism.
[01:34:07.150 --> 01:34:12.150]  But it turned out Theodore Kaczynski, who was in the CIA mind-control program, MKUltra,
[01:34:12.150 --> 01:34:17.150]  this is in the LA Times, was in some of the first transgender studies as well,
[01:34:17.150 --> 01:34:21.150]  and was considering transitioning to a woman, that's the Unabomber.
[01:34:21.150 --> 01:34:25.150]  So this is a CIA MI6 Tabastock Institute program.
[01:34:25.150 --> 01:34:30.150]  Here's Tulsi Gabbards, who's been a liberal and army veteran, telling the truth.
[01:34:30.150 --> 01:34:35.150]  But this is not about, oh, let gay people get married five years ago.
[01:34:35.150 --> 01:34:36.150]  We're like, sure, live your life.
[01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:38.150]  Oh, next, give us your children.
[01:34:38.150 --> 01:34:42.150]  Let us cut your son's private parts off.
[01:34:42.150 --> 01:34:43.150]  Let's cut women's breasts off.
[01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:45.150]  I mean, oh, they deserve medical care.
[01:34:45.150 --> 01:34:50.150]  And then this famous woman that had her breasts just cut off, she said she heard voices telling her,
[01:34:50.150 --> 01:34:52.150]  cut your breasts off, cut your breasts off.
[01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:57.150]  That's when you're supposed to go to the mental institution when you need medication.
[01:34:57.150 --> 01:35:00.150]  But if you show up now and say, doctor, I want to cut my arm off,
[01:35:00.150 --> 01:35:03.150]  there's a whole movement where they're now cutting people's arms and legs off.
[01:35:03.150 --> 01:35:06.150]  They're calling it trans-abled.
[01:35:06.150 --> 01:35:08.150]  Trans-abled.
[01:35:08.150 --> 01:35:10.150]  So they're enabling the mental illness and pushing it.
[01:35:10.150 --> 01:35:14.150]  You have an empty, lost society, and then they push dehumanization.
[01:35:14.150 --> 01:35:20.150]  Now, Canada is at the tip of the spear for government-sponsored, pushed, forced suicide
[01:35:20.150 --> 01:35:23.150]  of the mentally ill who they're wards of, though.
[01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:25.150]  So that's the next big thing they're going to be celebrating,
[01:35:25.150 --> 01:35:27.150]  how brave it is to kill yourself.
[01:35:27.150 --> 01:35:29.150]  Canada's already running TV ads doing that.
[01:35:29.150 --> 01:35:32.150]  We'll get Chris Guy's really expert take on this.
[01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:33.150]  Guy's one of the smartest people out there.
[01:35:33.150 --> 01:35:35.150]  But here's Tulsi Gabbard's.
[01:35:35.150 --> 01:35:40.150]  Byproduct, unfortunately, of today's Democratic Party's blind pursuit of power
[01:35:40.150 --> 01:35:44.150]  and their rejection of this truth that we are all God's children
[01:35:44.150 --> 01:35:50.150]  is that they reduce each of us to the color of our skin or our gender or our sex,
[01:35:50.150 --> 01:35:54.150]  and they're using identity politics to tear us apart,
[01:35:54.150 --> 01:35:59.150]  fomenting anti-white racism and fanning the flames of divisiveness
[01:35:59.150 --> 01:36:03.150]  just so they can score a few political points.
[01:36:03.150 --> 01:36:06.150]  What's so disturbing about all of this is this is not something they're trying to hide.
[01:36:06.150 --> 01:36:07.150]  They're proud of it.
[01:36:07.150 --> 01:36:09.150]  They celebrate it.
[01:36:09.150 --> 01:36:11.150]  They promote it at every opportunity,
[01:36:11.150 --> 01:36:19.150]  even though what they are actually doing is betraying the dream of Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:36:19.150 --> 01:36:25.150]  Their actions betray his wish that we would be judged not by the color of our skin
[01:36:25.150 --> 01:36:27.150]  but by the content of our character.
[01:36:27.150 --> 01:36:32.150]  They have become, in doing so, the racist that they claim to hate.
[01:36:32.150 --> 01:36:45.150]  You heard from Riley Gaines earlier, what an incredibly brave and courageous woman,
[01:36:45.150 --> 01:36:54.150]  who embodies the consequence of what happens when the Democrats reject the existence of objective truth.
[01:36:54.150 --> 01:36:59.150]  They reject the truth that we as women exist,
[01:36:59.150 --> 01:37:05.150]  and even as they continue to claim that they are the ones who are champions for women.
[01:37:05.150 --> 01:37:11.150]  They are the ones, not my predecessor, but the woman who held the seat that I served in in Congress,
[01:37:11.150 --> 01:37:17.150]  she was one of the leading advocates for the passage of Title IX over 50 years ago.
[01:37:17.150 --> 01:37:19.150]  And you look at what they're doing now,
[01:37:19.150 --> 01:37:26.150]  spitting in the face of every woman and girl who has benefited from the passage of Title IX
[01:37:26.150 --> 01:37:33.150]  by saying that actually women don't exist, that we're just a construct of someone's mind,
[01:37:33.150 --> 01:37:38.150]  that anybody at any time can say, well, you know what, I'm a woman too.
[01:37:38.150 --> 01:37:44.150]  There's literally no greater expression of hatred and hostility towards women
[01:37:44.150 --> 01:37:49.150]  than to erase us as an entire category of people.
[01:37:49.150 --> 01:37:52.150]  Absolutely. Title IX says you're going to have government funding for sports,
[01:37:52.150 --> 01:37:53.150]  it's going to be equal to women.
[01:37:53.150 --> 01:37:55.150]  I've got three daughters and one son.
[01:37:55.150 --> 01:37:57.150]  If I had no daughters, I would support that.
[01:37:57.150 --> 01:37:59.150]  That's real freedom for women.
[01:37:59.150 --> 01:38:02.150]  And now this cult says women don't exist.
[01:38:02.150 --> 01:38:03.150]  I'll tell you why.
[01:38:03.150 --> 01:38:04.150]  Corporations want to make the babies.
[01:38:04.150 --> 01:38:05.150]  They want replicants.
[01:38:05.150 --> 01:38:08.150]  They're already having a bunch of babies in the UK that are from three parents.
[01:38:08.150 --> 01:38:11.150]  You study what humans are, they're making two men's genetics a baby.
[01:38:11.150 --> 01:38:13.150]  There's no mitochondrial DNA pass.
[01:38:13.150 --> 01:38:14.150]  That's not a human, folks.
[01:38:14.150 --> 01:38:15.150]  That's in the science.
[01:38:15.150 --> 01:38:17.150]  But if you can say two men can have a baby,
[01:38:17.150 --> 01:38:22.150]  you can make a corporate creation that's a humanoid and say it's whatever you want it to be.
[01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:25.150]  So a man and a woman can be on a deserted island.
[01:38:25.150 --> 01:38:30.150]  And if there is food and resources there, they can make a future.
[01:38:30.150 --> 01:38:33.150]  A man and a woman together is a terraforming operation.
[01:38:33.150 --> 01:38:35.150]  We're powerful.
[01:38:35.150 --> 01:38:36.150]  We're the species.
[01:38:36.150 --> 01:38:38.150]  They act like a nuclear family just got invented.
[01:38:38.150 --> 01:38:40.150]  It's why our species is powerful.
[01:38:40.150 --> 01:38:46.150]  And all the higher orders of birds and you name it mate for life, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:46.150 --> 01:38:49.150]  And then groups of monkeys are in troops to protect themselves.
[01:38:49.150 --> 01:38:50.150]  Lions are in prides.
[01:38:50.150 --> 01:38:51.150]  They're families.
[01:38:51.150 --> 01:38:52.150]  They're groups.
[01:38:52.150 --> 01:38:55.150]  And they're attacking that because the lions weren't in a family.
[01:38:55.150 --> 01:38:57.150]  The hyenas would kill them in a day.
[01:38:57.150 --> 01:38:59.150]  Chris Sky, we skipped the break.
[01:38:59.150 --> 01:39:00.150]  Give me more time.
[01:39:00.150 --> 01:39:02.150]  Lay into these people.
[01:39:02.150 --> 01:39:04.150]  Well, everything she says 100% true.
[01:39:04.150 --> 01:39:09.150]  And it does come down to the core of trying to erase and destroy and attack women.
[01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:10.150]  That's the reality.
[01:39:10.150 --> 01:39:12.150]  They say it's all pro-LGBT.
[01:39:12.150 --> 01:39:13.150]  No, it is anti-women.
[01:39:13.150 --> 01:39:15.150]  And why do they want to attack women?
[01:39:15.150 --> 01:39:18.150]  Because women are the core of the nuclear family.
[01:39:18.150 --> 01:39:22.150]  And women are the ones that will stand up for their child to the death.
[01:39:22.150 --> 01:39:28.150]  So by destroying what it is to be a woman, diminishing what it is to be a mom, and all the rest of it,
[01:39:28.150 --> 01:39:32.150]  and taking women out of the equation, they're setting up the stage to destroy the nuclear family.
[01:39:32.150 --> 01:39:34.150]  And why do they want to do that?
[01:39:34.150 --> 01:39:35.150]  We already established.
[01:39:35.150 --> 01:39:37.150]  It creates profits for big pharma.
[01:39:37.150 --> 01:39:41.150]  But more importantly, it creates compliant citizens to the government agenda.
[01:39:42.150 --> 01:39:46.150]  The people that are turned into this LGBT community that are now wards of the state,
[01:39:46.150 --> 01:39:50.150]  that now have the influence of the teacher and the government as the number one in their life,
[01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:55.150]  they are far more likely to support every government agenda on TV.
[01:39:55.150 --> 01:39:59.150]  They're more likely to wear a mask, more likely to support the mandates, more likely to take a jab,
[01:39:59.150 --> 01:40:03.150]  more likely to support climate change, more likely to support the war in Ukraine.
[01:40:03.150 --> 01:40:04.150]  They did a poll of liberals.
[01:40:04.150 --> 01:40:08.150]  60% want government cameras in all homes last week.
[01:40:08.150 --> 01:40:09.150]  There you go.
[01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:15.150]  They will support whatever the government says because the government to them is their god.
[01:40:15.150 --> 01:40:16.150]  The government has replaced family.
[01:40:16.150 --> 01:40:18.150]  The government has replaced religion.
[01:40:18.150 --> 01:40:25.150]  And they put themselves in that place where they are now the number one influence in that person's life.
[01:40:25.150 --> 01:40:30.150]  So it's in the government's best interest to continue their quest for control,
[01:40:30.150 --> 01:40:38.150]  to try to transform as many of our children into LGBT wards of the state as possible.
[01:40:38.150 --> 01:40:41.150]  And the teachers are more than happy to do it.
[01:40:41.150 --> 01:40:49.150]  In Canada, they literally passed laws where the teachers can start calling your children the child's preferred pronoun,
[01:40:49.150 --> 01:40:51.150]  obviously taught to them by the teacher.
[01:40:51.150 --> 01:40:57.150]  And they will not even inform the parent, let alone ask the parent for consent.
[01:40:57.150 --> 01:41:00.150]  And this is a hotbed of discussion in Canada right now.
[01:41:00.150 --> 01:41:04.150]  And New Brunswick was the first province to pass a law against this.
[01:41:04.150 --> 01:41:12.150]  And I believe this is going to be the beginning of massive pushback against this sexual orientation, gender identity, sexualizing children,
[01:41:12.150 --> 01:41:15.150]  this so-called curriculum that they're bringing in.
[01:41:15.150 --> 01:41:16.150]  People see it.
[01:41:16.150 --> 01:41:19.150]  People understand the nefarious purposes behind it.
[01:41:19.150 --> 01:41:21.150]  And people are not going to put up with it.
[01:41:21.150 --> 01:41:25.150]  Mothers, fathers, and the children themselves have had enough.
[01:41:25.150 --> 01:41:30.150]  And when I become the mayor, we are going to simply enforce the laws on the books.
[01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:31.150]  People can look this up.
[01:41:31.150 --> 01:41:32.150]  In Canada, we have a law.
[01:41:32.150 --> 01:41:39.150]  171.1 and 171.2 against the sexual exploitation of children.
[01:41:39.150 --> 01:41:43.150]  And it says in big black and white, this does not mean child porn.
[01:41:43.150 --> 01:41:50.150]  This is just things like drag queens like we just had in Pride Month in Ontario coming to a park, going on stage,
[01:41:50.150 --> 01:41:59.150]  and literally stripping down to a female G-string, having children put dollar bills into their thing.
[01:41:59.150 --> 01:42:00.150]  And I don't know.
[01:42:00.150 --> 01:42:03.150]  These are the little Muslim kids that were stepping on the pride flags.
[01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:06.150]  And I believe in that because I don't believe in pride.
[01:42:06.150 --> 01:42:10.150]  I support the LGBT community, but pride is now coming for the children.
[01:42:10.150 --> 01:42:13.150]  And these children recognize that, and they're standing up to it.
[01:42:13.150 --> 01:42:15.150]  And, Chris, that's critical.
[01:42:15.150 --> 01:42:20.150]  I was on Stephen Crowder's show.
[01:42:20.150 --> 01:42:22.150]  I was hosting it last week.
[01:42:22.150 --> 01:42:28.150]  And all I said was I used to see the anti-sodomy laws and say you shouldn't put somebody in jail for that, which I still think you shouldn't.
[01:42:28.150 --> 01:42:30.150]  I don't hate anybody if they're an adult.
[01:42:30.150 --> 01:42:33.150]  But now the movement means coming for the kids.
[01:42:33.150 --> 01:42:39.150]  The movement means sterilizing children, cutting little girls' breasts off, little boys' penises off and testicles.
[01:42:39.150 --> 01:42:44.150]  I mean, so you have to accept all of it now because it's a big train of evil.
[01:42:44.150 --> 01:42:53.150]  So I oppose it all because you have to, because it's the Democratic Party and your party up there,
[01:42:53.150 --> 01:42:56.150]  the establishment globalist parties are 100 percent behind this.
[01:42:56.150 --> 01:42:57.150]  They created it.
[01:42:57.150 --> 01:42:58.150]  They push it.
[01:42:58.150 --> 01:43:02.150]  So the U.N., the big corporations, the Democratic Party run pride.
[01:43:02.150 --> 01:43:03.150]  It's their flag.
[01:43:03.150 --> 01:43:11.150]  And have you seen in the U.S. they're putting it up above, ladies and gentlemen, up above the American flag, up above.
[01:43:11.150 --> 01:43:13.150]  That's when you're captured.
[01:43:13.150 --> 01:43:14.150]  So it could be a black flag.
[01:43:14.150 --> 01:43:15.150]  It could be a green flag.
[01:43:15.150 --> 01:43:18.150]  It could be a football flag.
[01:43:18.150 --> 01:43:24.150]  I'd be, why is the Dallas Cowboy flag in the center at the White House with American flags below it?
[01:43:24.150 --> 01:43:26.150]  I mean, there's a federal law.
[01:43:26.150 --> 01:43:27.150]  I've got it right here.
[01:43:27.150 --> 01:43:29.150]  Give me an overhead shot.
[01:43:29.150 --> 01:43:33.150]  I mean, there's actually a law on displaying the flag because it's the symbol of the country,
[01:43:33.150 --> 01:43:35.150]  and they knew people would try this crap.
[01:43:35.150 --> 01:43:38.150]  This got cut out again, but we're going to reconnect.
[01:43:38.150 --> 01:43:41.150]  So this is the reality, folks.
[01:43:41.150 --> 01:43:47.150]  This is when you're conquered, and it means the entire agenda that is connected to this.
[01:43:47.150 --> 01:43:48.150]  Oh, gay marriage.
[01:43:48.150 --> 01:43:51.150]  Remember just five years ago, six years ago, oh, gay marriage.
[01:43:51.150 --> 01:43:53.150]  And now it's give us your children.
[01:43:54.150 --> 01:43:57.150]  Let's go ahead and go to a clip while we're reconnecting, Chris.
[01:43:57.150 --> 01:44:03.150]  This is a high school in California with the math teacher telling him,
[01:44:03.150 --> 01:44:07.150]  I'll put you in school suspension for a year.
[01:44:07.150 --> 01:44:09.150]  A year.
[01:44:09.150 --> 01:44:13.150]  If you don't sit here and watch a video that shows girls and guys, I'm not going to play the whole thing.
[01:44:13.150 --> 01:44:17.150]  And these are underage people kissing.
[01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:19.150]  And then all this other crap.
[01:44:19.150 --> 01:44:22.150]  And people are like, why are you doing this?
[01:44:22.150 --> 01:44:30.150]  Why are you – I mean, if a teacher was talking about heterosexual stuff and saying you should go out and do this,
[01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:32.150]  people would say, why is a teacher teaching that?
[01:44:32.150 --> 01:44:35.150]  They want to form a sexual relationship with you
[01:44:35.150 --> 01:44:41.150]  because the corporations can then connect their political movements and controls to that.
[01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:42.150]  Here's the clip.
[01:44:42.150 --> 01:44:55.150]  Wow.
[01:44:55.150 --> 01:45:00.150]  Why are you doing this to kids?
[01:45:00.150 --> 01:45:03.150]  Hey, I'm warning you guys now, if you're going to be inappropriate,
[01:45:03.150 --> 01:45:06.150]  I will have supervision down and give all of you a Saturday school for next year.
[01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:07.150]  So knock it off.
[01:45:07.150 --> 01:45:10.150]  Okay.
[01:45:10.150 --> 01:45:15.150]  So let's go over while we're trying to reconnect some of these links here.
[01:45:15.150 --> 01:45:19.150]  Joe Biden says people in America are being thrown out of restaurants for being gay.
[01:45:19.150 --> 01:45:20.150]  Not true.
[01:45:20.150 --> 01:45:21.150]  Not going on.
[01:45:21.150 --> 01:45:22.150]  Not happening.
[01:45:22.150 --> 01:45:25.150]  But at universities all over the country, they say this is gay day.
[01:45:25.150 --> 01:45:32.150]  No one who isn't gay or LGBTQXZPZS, you're not allowed to be here.
[01:45:32.150 --> 01:45:37.150]  And they're literally telling kids we're going to put you in in-school suspension for a year
[01:45:38.150 --> 01:45:42.150]  if you don't sit here and watch this, if you've grown.
[01:45:42.150 --> 01:45:47.150]  White House accused of U.S. flag code violation over pride month display.
[01:45:47.150 --> 01:45:49.150]  Now here's who's actually being persecuted.
[01:45:49.150 --> 01:45:56.150]  I have the clip of them introducing the bill and saying, yes, you'll go to jail if you don't do this.
[01:45:56.150 --> 01:46:00.150]  California bill would take kids from home if parents don't affirm gender.
[01:46:00.150 --> 01:46:03.150]  And she talks about a seven-year-old.
[01:46:03.150 --> 01:46:06.150]  A seven-year-old thinks they may be another sex because the school told them,
[01:46:06.150 --> 01:46:11.150]  are you Batman or you Robin or you Aquaman or Aquagirl?
[01:46:11.150 --> 01:46:13.150]  And then you don't go along with what they're doing.
[01:46:13.150 --> 01:46:14.150]  They take your kids.
[01:46:14.150 --> 01:46:18.150]  So you're just babysitting now for the state before they sterilize them.
[01:46:18.150 --> 01:46:25.150]  Anti-LGBTQ PS, now it's Satanism, backlash rattles U.S. pride events.
[01:46:25.150 --> 01:46:30.150]  Rattles events where it's all about kids.
[01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:39.150]  Florida anti-LGBTQ laws prompt families who feel unsafe to flee.
[01:46:39.150 --> 01:46:43.150]  Christian preacher is arrested for quoting Bible verses across the street at a pride event.
[01:46:43.150 --> 01:46:44.150]  That's America.
[01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:49.150]  We're the ones being persecuted, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:49.150 --> 01:46:52.150]  Now the one out of Canada is even more insane.
[01:46:52.150 --> 01:46:53.150]  We'll show some of this video.
[01:46:53.150 --> 01:46:55.150]  We've got Chris Sky back.
[01:46:56.150 --> 01:47:01.150]  Canadian Muslim and Christian parents protest LGBTQ PS,
[01:47:01.150 --> 01:47:03.150]  because now they say it's Satanism, indoctrination.
[01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:09.150]  Children stomp trans flags because they recognize it's the gang trying to dominate them.
[01:47:09.150 --> 01:47:11.150]  It's the gang trying to control them.
[01:47:11.150 --> 01:47:14.150]  It's the gang trying to destroy their innocence.
[01:47:14.150 --> 01:47:15.150]  This is so crazy.
[01:47:15.150 --> 01:47:18.150]  I mean, listen, I've got four children.
[01:47:18.150 --> 01:47:23.150]  And if either one, because I've been married twice and neither wife ever did this,
[01:47:23.150 --> 01:47:27.150]  started telling my five-year-old about adult sex and things,
[01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:28.150]  I'd say, you're a weirdo.
[01:47:28.150 --> 01:47:30.150]  You don't teach them that until right before puberty.
[01:47:30.150 --> 01:47:33.150]  And then it's just scientific.
[01:47:33.150 --> 01:47:36.150]  You explain the dangers of it and the good things about it and marriage and the rest of it.
[01:47:36.150 --> 01:47:37.150]  That's a parent's role.
[01:47:37.150 --> 01:47:41.150]  But, I mean, imagine if your wife or husband,
[01:47:41.150 --> 01:47:45.150]  you come in and your wife is shaking their ass in front of your kid's face
[01:47:45.150 --> 01:47:47.150]  and tell them about blowjobs.
[01:47:47.150 --> 01:47:49.150]  I mean, and folks, I hate to talk that on air,
[01:47:49.150 --> 01:47:55.150]  but, I mean, they're teaching seven, eight-year-olds stuff that I didn't even know until I was like 20
[01:47:55.150 --> 01:47:58.150]  in these public schools and some private.
[01:47:58.150 --> 01:47:59.150]  They get grants for it.
[01:47:59.150 --> 01:48:00.150]  I mean, brutal stuff.
[01:48:00.150 --> 01:48:04.150]  They were teaching middle schoolers in Massachusetts 20 years ago,
[01:48:04.150 --> 01:48:07.150]  World and Daily reported on it, about fisting.
[01:48:07.150 --> 01:48:10.150]  And I know listeners don't want to hear this, but it's happening to kids, you got to know.
[01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:14.150]  That's shoving your whole arm up somebody's rear end causes serious medical problems.
[01:48:14.150 --> 01:48:17.150]  This is what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:17.150 --> 01:48:22.150]  And so they want to screw your kids up and make a political connection to that trauma.
[01:48:22.150 --> 01:48:24.150]  That's what cults do is mind control.
[01:48:24.150 --> 01:48:26.150]  And to sexualize a child is trauma.
[01:48:26.150 --> 01:48:29.150]  Then you control their identity and attach yourself to it.
[01:48:29.150 --> 01:48:32.150]  So the footage out of Canada is just wild.
[01:48:32.150 --> 01:48:36.150]  And, again, you've got like 800 LGBTP people going,
[01:48:36.150 --> 01:48:40.150]  your kids belong to us because the elementary school, the public school has announced
[01:48:40.150 --> 01:48:47.150]  all children will use pronouns and they're going to teach them LGBTPQZS, Satan stuff.
[01:48:47.150 --> 01:48:51.150]  And so the Muslims with the conservatives, with the Christians are saying no,
[01:48:51.150 --> 01:48:57.150]  and the left doesn't know what to do because they've been given an order, get the children.
[01:48:57.150 --> 01:49:01.150]  I mean, you couldn't write a Hollywood script that's insane.
[01:49:01.150 --> 01:49:04.150]  But, again, even though it's a minority, it's weird, it's twisted,
[01:49:04.150 --> 01:49:07.150]  once we oppose them and the media makes them the victim,
[01:49:07.150 --> 01:49:11.150]  it elevates it now to this giant globalist movement.
[01:49:11.150 --> 01:49:13.150]  Chris Guy, your take on where this is going.
[01:49:13.150 --> 01:49:17.150]  Well, I can tell you right now, I've met with a mother whose six-year-old child's homework
[01:49:17.150 --> 01:49:20.150]  asked if she was a boy, a girl, or non-binary.
[01:49:20.150 --> 01:49:25.150]  I met with other parents where they found a book in the library, part of the SOGI curriculum,
[01:49:25.150 --> 01:49:28.150]  and this is in U.S. schools as well, called Gender Queer,
[01:49:28.150 --> 01:49:35.150]  and it depicts male-on-male prepubescent oral sex in the book in cartoonized form.
[01:49:35.150 --> 01:49:37.150]  And this was supposed to be for children.
[01:49:37.150 --> 01:49:42.150]  And then I had a friend of mine who just got suspended from his school for 20 days
[01:49:42.150 --> 01:49:45.150]  for saying that two men can't have a baby.
[01:49:45.150 --> 01:49:49.150]  20-day suspension for saying this.
[01:49:49.150 --> 01:49:51.150]  This is where it's headed.
[01:49:51.150 --> 01:49:52.150]  By the way, let me just back you up.
[01:49:52.150 --> 01:49:56.150]  People don't understand, whether you're in the U.K., Germany, the U.S., Canada, Australia,
[01:49:56.150 --> 01:49:58.150]  this is all the same globalist program.
[01:49:58.150 --> 01:50:02.150]  It's all unified, run by the U.N., by BlackRock on record.
[01:50:02.150 --> 01:50:06.150]  When they hand out to your elementary school student a sheet and say,
[01:50:06.150 --> 01:50:09.150]  are you a boy, girl, or other, the child doesn't know.
[01:50:09.150 --> 01:50:15.150]  If they get confused and say non-binary, they're put in a file that then makes it secret,
[01:50:15.150 --> 01:50:19.150]  and the process of taking your child begins the minute they circle that.
[01:50:19.150 --> 01:50:20.150]  Go ahead.
[01:50:20.150 --> 01:50:21.150]  100%.
[01:50:21.150 --> 01:50:26.150]  As soon as the child circles that, they start them down the path of potential transition,
[01:50:26.150 --> 01:50:28.150]  and they'll exclude the parent from all discussion.
[01:50:28.150 --> 01:50:30.150]  You also touched on the assisted suicide.
[01:50:30.150 --> 01:50:32.150]  They call it M.A.D.E. here in Canada.
[01:50:32.150 --> 01:50:37.150]  M.A.D.E. was responsible for over 30,000 deaths last year.
[01:50:37.150 --> 01:50:43.150]  In Quebec, the province of Quebec, it is the third leading cause of death in the entire province.
[01:50:43.150 --> 01:50:45.150]  Assisted suicide by the government.
[01:50:45.150 --> 01:50:51.150]  They actually run commercials for it and try to sell it to you like they're selling you a used car or something.
[01:50:51.150 --> 01:50:59.150]  And now they're trying to make it available to children as young as 12 years old.
[01:50:59.150 --> 01:51:03.150]  12-year-old child can go in and say they're depressed and want to end their own life,
[01:51:03.150 --> 01:51:06.150]  and they will not tell the parents until after it's done.
[01:51:06.150 --> 01:51:08.150]  That is what they are proposing.
[01:51:08.150 --> 01:51:10.150]  That is the next step of this process.
[01:51:10.150 --> 01:51:16.150]  They take life in general, and they want to destroy as much of it as they can.
[01:51:16.150 --> 01:51:22.150]  When they say they want to reduce the carbon footprint, you are the carbon footprint.
[01:51:22.150 --> 01:51:24.150]  They want to reduce you.
[01:51:24.150 --> 01:51:26.150]  They want to reduce your mobility.
[01:51:26.150 --> 01:51:29.150]  They want to reduce the amount of you on planet Earth.
[01:51:29.150 --> 01:51:32.150]  And they're not shy about it anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:32.150 --> 01:51:36.150]  So you better take heed, and you better start acting in your own best interest.
[01:51:36.150 --> 01:51:39.150]  I totally agree.
[01:51:39.150 --> 01:51:44.150]  You know, I'm thinking about my six-year-old daughter right now
[01:51:44.150 --> 01:51:50.150]  and just how innocent she is and how good she is and how she's everything to me.
[01:51:50.150 --> 01:51:55.150]  And I made the decision not even to have her in private school because a lot of them are getting grants.
[01:51:55.150 --> 01:51:56.150]  I can't even trust them.
[01:51:56.150 --> 01:52:01.150]  But for people that don't have the money to homeschool or private school, this is a global crisis.
[01:52:01.150 --> 01:52:03.150]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:52:03.150 --> 01:52:06.150]  And I think it's important to call it right out of the root
[01:52:06.150 --> 01:52:11.150]  and just point out that it's the corporate takeover of parental rights and our children's future.
[01:52:11.150 --> 01:52:15.150]  And how does the average leftist go along with this?
[01:52:15.150 --> 01:52:17.150]  Well, I'll tell you this, folks, okay?
[01:52:17.150 --> 01:52:23.150]  I mean, if you really have ever gone to a hotel or something when you're on a business trip
[01:52:23.150 --> 01:52:28.150]  and you know it was a, quote, LGBT hotel, and I've been to those, you know,
[01:52:28.150 --> 01:52:31.150]  because you go to L.A. or you go somewhere you don't know or you go to New York,
[01:52:31.150 --> 01:52:34.150]  you just book some place, you walk in, there's an LGBT party.
[01:52:34.150 --> 01:52:36.150]  It's a bunch of rich people.
[01:52:36.150 --> 01:52:37.150]  It's a bunch of good-looking people.
[01:52:37.150 --> 01:52:38.150]  There's no kids there.
[01:52:38.150 --> 01:52:39.150]  And I'm not defending these groups.
[01:52:39.150 --> 01:52:40.150]  I'm just saying.
[01:52:40.150 --> 01:52:44.150]  But then when you go to these, quote, trans kids or liberal kid things,
[01:52:44.150 --> 01:52:48.150]  it's a bunch of gross sickos and pedophiles and perverts.
[01:52:48.150 --> 01:52:51.150]  So I'm not defending lesbians and gays.
[01:52:51.150 --> 01:52:53.150]  I'm just saying I've been to beaches.
[01:52:53.150 --> 01:52:54.150]  I've been to places.
[01:52:54.150 --> 01:52:55.150]  I've seen their weddings.
[01:52:55.150 --> 01:52:56.150]  I've seen their events.
[01:52:56.150 --> 01:52:58.150]  It doesn't look like a bunch of mutants.
[01:52:58.150 --> 01:53:02.150]  But the people that are the LGBT, we want to help your kids,
[01:53:02.150 --> 01:53:06.150]  are literally a bunch of pedophile demons out of hell that are the ugliest, sickest,
[01:53:06.150 --> 01:53:07.150]  craziest-looking people ever.
[01:53:07.150 --> 01:53:10.150]  Where are the, quote, gay and lesbian groups?
[01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:15.150]  I know they're starting to say stuff to say you do not represent us because, I mean,
[01:53:15.150 --> 01:53:17.150]  this is an evil corporate takeover of our children.
[01:53:17.150 --> 01:53:18.150]  It's coming out.
[01:53:18.150 --> 01:53:21.150]  They're maiming and sterilizing children, and they're committing suicide at record rates,
[01:53:21.150 --> 01:53:24.150]  not because we're mean to them, but because in government studies,
[01:53:24.150 --> 01:53:27.150]  the kids are killing themselves in the government studies.
[01:53:27.150 --> 01:53:32.150]  So I want to say to the, quote, homosexual lobby out there, I'm not after you.
[01:53:32.150 --> 01:53:33.150]  I'm not attacking you.
[01:53:33.150 --> 01:53:40.150]  But you better do something about this, and you better stop letting them speak for you
[01:53:40.150 --> 01:53:42.150]  because you're going to lose this fight.
[01:53:42.150 --> 01:53:44.150]  You're not going to get our kids.
[01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:45.150]  You've already gotten a bunch of them.
[01:53:45.150 --> 01:53:48.150]  But in the end, the people involved in this are going to pay.
[01:53:48.150 --> 01:53:49.150]  You want to speak to those folks?
[01:53:49.150 --> 01:53:51.150]  Do you get my point, Chris?
[01:53:51.150 --> 01:53:52.150]  100%.
[01:53:52.150 --> 01:53:55.150]  Well, there is a massive group called Gays Against Groomers,
[01:53:55.150 --> 01:53:59.150]  and they have a big social media presence on Twitter, Instagram, et cetera.
[01:53:59.150 --> 01:54:01.150]  And they are exactly as you described.
[01:54:01.150 --> 01:54:05.150]  They are members of the LGBT community that just want to be left alone,
[01:54:05.150 --> 01:54:08.150]  that want to have their lifestyle amongst adults,
[01:54:08.150 --> 01:54:12.150]  which I believe everybody should have the choice to do what they want amongst adults.
[01:54:12.150 --> 01:54:17.150]  They're people that do really, really, really weird shit that I don't agree with.
[01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:18.150]  But I believe in freedom.
[01:54:18.150 --> 01:54:19.150]  And if you're amongst adults.
[01:54:19.150 --> 01:54:20.150]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:54:20.150 --> 01:54:21.150]  Here's the deal.
[01:54:21.150 --> 01:54:25.150]  Whether it's promiscuous heterosexuals or homosexuals, it's all the same thing in my eyes.
[01:54:25.150 --> 01:54:28.150]  I'm not going to sit here like some Pharisee on some high horse.
[01:54:28.150 --> 01:54:30.150]  The point is stay away from kids.
[01:54:30.150 --> 01:54:32.150]  Stay away from the kids.
[01:54:32.150 --> 01:54:40.150]  And don't let pedophiles conflate gay rights with screwing kids and just having sex with them.
[01:54:40.150 --> 01:54:42.150]  They want to cut their body parts off, Chris.
[01:54:42.150 --> 01:54:44.150]  It's 100 percent true.
[01:54:44.150 --> 01:54:47.150]  They want to put them on puberty blockers as young as 6 or 7.
[01:54:47.150 --> 01:54:50.150]  They want to remove their breast tissue when they're 9 or 10.
[01:54:50.150 --> 01:54:51.150]  They want to remove their penis.
[01:54:51.150 --> 01:54:55.150]  And they tell you they're going to create a vagina for you.
[01:54:55.150 --> 01:55:03.150]  But what they really create is a never healing canal that is literally an open wound in your body.
[01:55:03.150 --> 01:55:04.150]  A gunshot wound.
[01:55:04.150 --> 01:55:07.150]  They don't tell the people this when they're transitioning.
[01:55:07.150 --> 01:55:15.150]  But they have to put the equivalent of a sex toy into that canal for multiple hours every single day
[01:55:15.150 --> 01:55:21.150]  or that so-called man-made vagina, like any open wound, will simply close up.
[01:55:21.150 --> 01:55:30.150]  So in order to be able to use it for sex, you literally have to keep it as an open wound by inserting an object into it.
[01:55:30.150 --> 01:55:34.150]  And it bleeds and it gets infected and that's why they have record suicide.
[01:55:34.150 --> 01:55:40.150]  If I had a giant, if somebody cut my genitals off and I had a giant open wound, I'd kill myself too, Chris.
[01:55:40.150 --> 01:55:42.150]  This is crazy.
[01:55:42.150 --> 01:55:51.150]  People do not know, do not fathom the full consequences of the actions.
[01:55:51.150 --> 01:55:52.150]  And those are adults.
[01:55:52.150 --> 01:55:55.150]  So imagine when you're doing this to children.
[01:55:55.150 --> 01:55:58.150]  Children that wake up and say, hey, I want to eat ice cream for breakfast.
[01:55:58.150 --> 01:56:01.150]  Oh, are you going to give them ice cream for breakfast if they said that?
[01:56:02.150 --> 01:56:04.150]  Chris, I want to give you some closing comments.
[01:56:04.150 --> 01:56:08.150]  Chris, we've had technical problems today, but you've been off the chart and informative.
[01:56:08.150 --> 01:56:09.150]  I want to get into the wildfires.
[01:56:09.150 --> 01:56:11.150]  Do a few more minutes with us on the other side.
[01:56:11.150 --> 01:56:14.150]  We'll plug your campaign again, ChrisSkyForChange.com.
[01:56:14.150 --> 01:56:15.150]  Do a little bit more on the wildfires with us.
[01:56:15.150 --> 01:56:16.150]  We'll come right back.
[01:56:16.150 --> 01:56:20.150]  I've got to stop right there, though, because we need funds to stay on air.
[01:56:20.150 --> 01:56:21.150]  We're hardcore.
[01:56:21.150 --> 01:56:22.150]  We don't back down.
[01:56:22.150 --> 01:56:23.150]  We just tell the truth as we see it.
[01:56:23.150 --> 01:56:28.150]  You can agree with us, disagree with us, but we've got great products you need and I need funds to just stay on air.
[01:56:28.150 --> 01:56:29.150]  Plus, I'll be honest.
[01:56:29.150 --> 01:56:30.150]  I want to expand.
[01:56:30.150 --> 01:56:31.150]  I've got a bunch of reporters I want to hire.
[01:56:31.150 --> 01:56:33.150]  I want to be back on the road, back at the border.
[01:56:33.150 --> 01:56:39.150]  You've seen some of that since we stabilized, but I don't have any budget to do the stuff I want to do.
[01:56:39.150 --> 01:56:41.150]  So, I don't want to live here on fumes.
[01:56:41.150 --> 01:56:43.150]  I want to get back in the game.
[01:56:43.150 --> 01:56:45.150]  Please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:56:45.150 --> 01:56:47.150]  Please get great products.
[01:56:47.150 --> 01:56:49.150]  Super Female Vitality, we got some in.
[01:56:49.150 --> 01:56:51.150]  It's the same formula as Super Male.
[01:56:51.150 --> 01:56:54.150]  It's just that people like a different package for women.
[01:56:54.150 --> 01:56:56.150]  So, it's 50% off.
[01:56:56.150 --> 01:56:57.150]  Works great for men.
[01:56:57.150 --> 01:56:58.150]  Works great for women.
[01:56:58.150 --> 01:57:00.150]  Super Male is about to sell out.
[01:57:00.150 --> 01:57:01.150]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:01.150 --> 01:57:04.150]  And we have the two amazing nootropics.

[01:58:40.150 --> 01:58:43.150]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:58:43.150 --> 01:58:46.150]  And the answer for energy is Brain Force.
[01:58:48.150 --> 01:58:50.150]  You wanted to plug Brain Force. Do you like Brain Force?
[01:58:50.150 --> 01:58:53.150]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[01:58:53.150 --> 01:58:55.150]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:58:55.150 --> 01:58:57.150]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz.
[01:58:57.150 --> 01:58:59.150]  Four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers.
[01:58:59.150 --> 01:59:01.150]  And now two books with Alex Jones.
[01:59:01.150 --> 01:59:05.150]  That's because I use Brain Force every day.
[01:59:05.150 --> 01:59:09.150]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:59:09.150 --> 01:59:13.150]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:59:13.150 --> 01:59:18.150]  The one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is Brain Force.
[01:59:18.150 --> 01:59:22.150]  I'll take Brain Force in the morning right before I go to my computer.
[01:59:22.150 --> 01:59:26.150]  And I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:59:26.150 --> 01:59:30.150]  So it really is true that Brain Force is something I use every day.
[01:59:30.150 --> 01:59:32.150]  And it helps me with my writing.
[01:59:32.150 --> 01:59:33.150]  All right. We love you.
[01:59:33.150 --> 01:59:34.150]  We'll be right back.

[01:59:57.150 --> 02:00:11.150]  All right.
[02:00:11.150 --> 02:00:16.150]  Final segment with Chris Sky running for mayor in the criminal regime of the North.
[02:00:16.150 --> 02:00:18.150]  People are really waking up to it as a tyranny.
[02:00:18.150 --> 02:00:20.150]  WEF run.
[02:00:20.150 --> 02:00:22.150]  What about the wildfires?
[02:00:22.150 --> 02:00:27.150]  For those that don't know, Canada wildfires intensify, could last all summer.
[02:00:27.150 --> 02:00:31.150]  Hundreds of fires simultaneously started across the country.
[02:00:31.150 --> 02:00:36.150]  Media blames climate change for Canadian wildfires despite arrest of multiple arsonists.
[02:00:36.150 --> 02:00:39.150]  Just absolutely insane.
[02:00:39.150 --> 02:00:44.150]  Cold Lake area man faces 10 arson charges after string of wildfires.
[02:00:44.150 --> 02:00:51.150]  And you notice, how does the global warming theory explain that the forest fires stop at the U.S. border?
[02:00:51.150 --> 02:00:52.150]  This is so obvious.
[02:00:52.150 --> 02:00:54.150]  Chris Sky, what's really going on here?
[02:00:54.150 --> 02:00:58.150]  Well, it's them trying to promote the climate change agenda.
[02:00:58.150 --> 02:01:02.150]  And whenever they're trying to promote an agenda, whether it's COVID or whether it's climate change,
[02:01:02.150 --> 02:01:05.150]  their number one tactic to get people to comply is fear.
[02:01:05.150 --> 02:01:09.150]  So now they're trying to tell everybody, oh, my gosh, if you don't live in your 15-minute city,
[02:01:09.150 --> 02:01:13.150]  if you don't track and limit your carbon footprint, if you don't do everything we say,
[02:01:13.150 --> 02:01:15.150]  oh, the forests are going to burn and everyone's going to die.
[02:01:15.150 --> 02:01:18.150]  Reality, they're starting those fires themselves.
[02:01:18.150 --> 02:01:21.150]  We already have multiple people charged with arson.
[02:01:21.150 --> 02:01:28.150]  We already have multiple videos emerging of frigging helicopters dropping flames on the forest.
[02:01:28.150 --> 02:01:30.150]  They're not dropping water on the forest.
[02:01:30.150 --> 02:01:32.150]  They're dropping fire on the forest.
[02:01:32.150 --> 02:01:36.150]  And that's how you can have hundreds and hundreds of fires start simultaneously at the same time.
[02:01:36.150 --> 02:01:41.150]  I was about to say, seeing dozens of fires per region at the exact same time on satellite,
[02:01:41.150 --> 02:01:45.150]  even mainline retired forestry service people who, quote, the government won't hire.
[02:01:46.150 --> 02:01:52.150]  In every other case of big fires, they hire the retirees back to help assist and be in charge and for backup.
[02:01:52.150 --> 02:01:56.150]  None of them are being hired now, even guys that are 60 and just retired,
[02:01:56.150 --> 02:02:00.150]  because the word is it's the government doing it itself.
[02:02:00.150 --> 02:02:04.150]  Yep, and they want to cause as much chaos as possible, because like we saw with COVID,
[02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:08.150]  the more chaos they cause, the more control they try to take.
[02:02:08.150 --> 02:02:13.150]  And they know that people are not going to go along with the climate change agenda lightly.
[02:02:13.150 --> 02:02:17.150]  They got people to go along with COVID because there was the pressure of a public health order.
[02:02:17.150 --> 02:02:19.150]  There was the pressure of fines and a ramp.
[02:02:19.150 --> 02:02:23.150]  There was the pressure of, oh, my God, there's a scary virus that's going to kill you.
[02:02:23.150 --> 02:02:27.150]  With climate change, they're trying all the same boogeyman, but nobody's buying it.
[02:02:27.150 --> 02:02:31.150]  So they're literally burning down the forest.
[02:02:31.150 --> 02:02:35.150]  Well, to try to convince people to start living the type of life they want you to live.
[02:02:35.150 --> 02:02:41.150]  I was about to say the good news is, without even looking, Chris, Twitter and Instagram and stuff is flooded with forestry,
[02:02:41.150 --> 02:02:46.150]  former forestry people, locals across the country saying this is the government doing this.
[02:02:46.150 --> 02:02:48.150]  It seems like people are seeing through this.
[02:02:48.150 --> 02:02:53.150]  Of course, the people started seeing through the government at the end of COVID.
[02:02:53.150 --> 02:02:57.150]  Now we're at the point where the government, the media and the medical establishment
[02:02:57.150 --> 02:03:01.150]  is the least trusted and least respected in its history.
[02:03:01.150 --> 02:03:07.150]  And that is what's basically setting up my run for mayor, because everybody knows the government's full of it.
[02:03:07.150 --> 02:03:12.150]  Everybody knows the media is part of the government, and everybody knows together they're the problem.
[02:03:12.150 --> 02:03:16.150]  So how do you get rid of them? You don't elect another politician.
[02:03:16.150 --> 02:03:18.150]  You elect a representative of the people.
[02:03:18.150 --> 02:03:20.150]  And how do you know I'm a representative of the people?
[02:03:20.150 --> 02:03:27.150]  Because I'm about to get arrested tomorrow for the 27th time, because for the last three years, I've been fighting for the people.
[02:03:27.150 --> 02:03:33.150]  Not only have I been telling people what they're going to do, not only have I been telling people how it's going to affect their lives,
[02:03:33.150 --> 02:03:38.150]  but I've been providing solutions to every single problem these politicians have been causing.
[02:03:38.150 --> 02:03:41.150]  Chris, I know you got to go, but you got to do one more segment to talk about this.
[02:03:41.150 --> 02:03:43.150]  But let me put it on screen for TV viewers.
[02:03:43.150 --> 02:03:47.150]  Look at Eastern Canada. Look at the province.
[02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:54.150]  In one hour, dozens of fires all set at the same time without storms, with no lightning strikes.
[02:03:54.150 --> 02:03:58.150]  And experts are saying that is 100 percent coordinated mass arson.
[02:03:58.150 --> 02:04:02.150]  Look at that. I mean, that is total proof, Chris.
[02:04:03.150 --> 02:04:04.150]  And that's what I was telling you.
[02:04:04.150 --> 02:04:07.150]  That's why I didn't even have to dwell on it that long, because the evidence is out there.
[02:04:07.150 --> 02:04:14.150]  It's overwhelming. It's overwhelming that it was a coordinated effort started by arsonists on the ground and arsonists in the air.
[02:04:14.150 --> 02:04:22.150]  And every expert, everybody that's ever worked in fires or forests or any of those fields knows that this is 100 percent government funded.
[02:04:22.150 --> 02:04:25.150]  This is the left attacking. OK, final segment. Stay there.
[02:04:25.150 --> 02:04:28.150]  You, you, I'm totally behind you for mayor.
[02:04:28.150 --> 02:04:31.150]  Regardless, you win by being part of the debates, injecting, you know, truth.
[02:04:31.150 --> 02:04:33.150]  Everybody should run for office like you're doing.
[02:04:33.150 --> 02:04:36.150]  But the way you're being persecuted, that's how you know people are real.
[02:04:36.150 --> 02:04:39.150]  Trump's real. Chris Sky's real. I'm real.
[02:04:39.150 --> 02:04:41.150]  Steve Bannon's real. Roger Stone's real.
[02:04:41.150 --> 02:04:43.150]  Look at him. They'll call that a controlled burn.
[02:04:43.150 --> 02:04:45.150]  But my God, that's not how you do a controlled burn.
[02:04:45.150 --> 02:04:48.150]  You do a controlled burn on the side of a road or something.
[02:04:48.150 --> 02:04:50.150]  You don't do it right through the middle. Oh, my God.
[02:04:50.150 --> 02:04:53.150]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds. Chris Sky is our guest.
[02:04:56.150 --> 02:05:03.150]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[02:05:03.150 --> 02:05:07.150]  We want to have all the best brands. We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[02:05:07.150 --> 02:05:11.150]  So I get constant questions online in person. Hey, what's better? Knockout.
[02:05:11.150 --> 02:05:14.150]  What's better? Down and out. What's better?
[02:05:14.150 --> 02:05:16.150]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:05:16.150 --> 02:05:21.150]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:05:22.150 --> 02:05:26.150]  So one person might like this coffee. Another person likes that coffee.
[02:05:26.150 --> 02:05:28.150]  That's how our bodies work. They're all very diverse.
[02:05:28.150 --> 02:05:34.150]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love
[02:05:34.150 --> 02:05:39.150]  and sold for a lower price under the name Infowars MD Good Night Sleep.

[02:05:54.150 --> 02:06:21.150]  All right. Some stations don't care in the first five minutes.
[02:06:22.150 --> 02:06:27.150]  Canadian activists running for mayor in Toronto just knocked it out of the park.
[02:06:27.150 --> 02:06:32.150]  Canadians know coast to coast. Hundreds of fires have been set.
[02:06:32.150 --> 02:06:36.150]  And in many cases, satellites show in just a one hour time lapse,
[02:06:36.150 --> 02:06:39.150]  even mainstream news admits it, that it is arson.
[02:06:39.150 --> 02:06:44.150]  They've been arresting leftists all over setting the fires, but they all claim they're acting on their own.
[02:06:44.150 --> 02:06:50.150]  Just like 2020 in California, Oregon and Washington, the left set fires everywhere to blame Trump.
[02:06:50.150 --> 02:06:53.150]  And to say it was global warming. So we're showing you satellite footage.
[02:06:53.150 --> 02:06:56.150]  It's not storms. It's not lightning. It's not an act of God.
[02:06:56.150 --> 02:07:03.150]  Remember, Pat Robertson, I thought overall was a good guy, died earlier last week, a few days ago.
[02:07:03.150 --> 02:07:07.150]  And the media would always attack him because he would say earthquakes or things should be God's judgment.
[02:07:07.150 --> 02:07:11.150]  Well, you could say, you know, a tidal wave or it could be God's judgment.
[02:07:11.150 --> 02:07:15.150]  But the left saying we've been bad and we have cars and we have air conditioners.
[02:07:15.150 --> 02:07:18.150]  So we're being judged by Mother Earth.
[02:07:18.150 --> 02:07:22.150]  But then we look at who's actually starting the fires.
[02:07:22.150 --> 02:07:26.150]  Clearly, this is organized, even organized crime.
[02:07:26.150 --> 02:07:30.150]  Couldn't do what you're saying. That's government, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:30.150 --> 02:07:34.150]  That's what former forestry officials are saying. They're saying this is military.
[02:07:34.150 --> 02:07:38.150]  This is this is this is happening all over the country the same day, coast to coast.
[02:07:38.150 --> 02:07:44.150]  OK, so understand, ladies and gentlemen, that they're now saying it's your fault.
[02:07:44.150 --> 02:07:46.150]  It's climate change. We need climate lockdowns.
[02:07:46.150 --> 02:07:50.150]  You have to move into the compact cities or everybody's going to burn down.
[02:07:50.150 --> 02:07:54.150]  And that's what Chuckie Schumer saying. That's what John Kerry is saying.
[02:07:54.150 --> 02:07:57.150]  And that's what they're they're all pushing. And Al Gore is back.
[02:07:57.150 --> 02:08:00.150]  Remember, he said in 2009, by 2013, the cities will be flooded.
[02:08:00.150 --> 02:08:06.150]  Then he said 2017, it'll all be flooded. He's back saying the same thing again.
[02:08:06.150 --> 02:08:09.150]  So they're really, really, really, really, really pushing this.
[02:08:09.150 --> 02:08:15.150]  Turns out the ice caps are bigger, not smaller. There's more polar bears, not less.
[02:08:15.150 --> 02:08:23.150]  They're lying to you to get you to accept having less to be poor so they can control you.
[02:08:23.150 --> 02:08:28.150]  Chris Sky recap what you were saying about these these incredible fires.
[02:08:28.150 --> 02:08:31.150]  Remember, they said, oh, it's not the Wuhan lab.
[02:08:31.150 --> 02:08:34.150]  Global warming made it come out of a jungle or a cave.
[02:08:34.150 --> 02:08:39.150]  Oh, it's not the lockdowns that caused the third world to collapse and tens of millions of refugees.
[02:08:39.150 --> 02:08:42.150]  No, it's covid that did it. And climate change.
[02:08:42.150 --> 02:08:47.150]  They create the policy to collapse the third world, flood us and then say it's an act of God.
[02:08:47.150 --> 02:08:50.150]  But it's not an act of God. It's an act of the New World Order.
[02:08:50.150 --> 02:08:52.150]  Chris Sky. Very simple.
[02:08:52.150 --> 02:08:56.150]  It's the same old problem, reaction, solution. Climate change is the problem.
[02:08:56.150 --> 02:09:03.150]  The fires are the reaction. The solution is more government control over our lives, forcing us to be in the city,
[02:09:03.150 --> 02:09:08.150]  forcing us to have a 15 minute city, a carbon footprint tracker, a digital ID and a digital currency,
[02:09:08.150 --> 02:09:10.150]  all for the greater good of climate change.
[02:09:10.150 --> 02:09:15.150]  And, of course, out of chaos comes order, never the kind of order you want,
[02:09:15.150 --> 02:09:21.150]  the kind of order that orders with an iron fist that collapses society and destroys the opportunities for our children.
[02:09:21.150 --> 02:09:25.150]  So that is what we're up against. We're up against we're at the fork in the road.
[02:09:25.150 --> 02:09:29.150]  If we go along with it, if we go along with the climate change agenda,
[02:09:29.150 --> 02:09:37.150]  your children and their children are guaranteed to have less opportunity, less financial freedom,
[02:09:37.150 --> 02:09:45.150]  less freedom in general and virtually no opportunity to be successful or pass that down to the next generation.
[02:09:45.150 --> 02:09:55.150]  So basically, humanity will be put on a standstill and these people will retain a two key system of ruler and slave
[02:09:55.150 --> 02:09:59.150]  for generations to come, barring a violent revolution.
[02:10:02.150 --> 02:10:06.150]  How do we fix this and not lean into their trap of a violent revolution?
[02:10:06.150 --> 02:10:08.150]  Because they want to have a violent revolution.
[02:10:08.150 --> 02:10:11.150]  But I would say to the Declaration of Independence, and I'm not calling for violence.
[02:10:11.150 --> 02:10:16.150]  Clearly, there were less abuses when we got violent 250 years ago than there are now.
[02:10:16.150 --> 02:10:20.150]  So under the Declaration of Independence, it points out your inalienable right.
[02:10:20.150 --> 02:10:26.150]  When you have a destructive, tyrannical government like Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Xi Jinping to stand against it,
[02:10:26.150 --> 02:10:28.150]  I don't think any of us disagree with that.
[02:10:28.150 --> 02:10:31.150]  The Ukrainians claim they don't like Putin's right.
[02:10:31.150 --> 02:10:35.150]  OK, so what are you saying, Chris Guy?
[02:10:35.150 --> 02:10:37.150]  Well, I'm saying that's why I'm running for mayor.
[02:10:37.150 --> 02:10:43.150]  Because like we said before, Toronto is like the jugular vein of the World Economic Forum agenda.
[02:10:43.150 --> 02:10:45.150]  So I'm going straight for the jugular.
[02:10:45.150 --> 02:10:50.150]  And when I get in there as mayor and I draft policies that block the 15-minute city,
[02:10:50.150 --> 02:10:53.150]  and I draft policies that block any future pandemic,
[02:10:53.150 --> 02:10:58.150]  and I draft policies that are going to preserve and create opportunities for the people
[02:10:58.150 --> 02:11:04.150]  and create revenue and GDP for the city and eliminate the budget deficit and enable a lower taxes
[02:11:04.150 --> 02:11:11.150]  and basically solve all the problems in a few years that the politicians spent decades foisting upon the people,
[02:11:11.150 --> 02:11:20.150]  the people are going to understand that everything that's happened has been intentional mismanagement with sinister intention.
[02:11:20.150 --> 02:11:23.150]  They're not going to trust any politician, media or government,
[02:11:23.150 --> 02:11:29.150]  and it's going to create a populist uprising of normal, everyday people like me
[02:11:29.150 --> 02:11:38.150]  running for office at the municipal level, and we're going to have a groundswell of a grassroots revolution of political thought.
[02:11:38.150 --> 02:11:42.150]  And by the way, this isn't just idle talk.
[02:11:42.150 --> 02:11:48.150]  The globalists in their own documents admit if one governor or one mayor can turn back their operation,
[02:11:48.150 --> 02:11:50.150]  because it is artificial, we love prosperity.
[02:11:50.150 --> 02:11:52.150]  We can do anything. We're incredible.
[02:11:52.150 --> 02:11:54.150]  Everybody's incredible. Humans are incredible.
[02:11:54.150 --> 02:11:59.150]  If we didn't have artificial feudalism to make us poor to control, it's not a new idea.
[02:11:59.150 --> 02:12:00.150]  It's the oldest idea of government.
[02:12:00.150 --> 02:12:07.150]  If we didn't have this seriously regressive idea that calls itself progressive in the way of our real progressiveness,
[02:12:07.150 --> 02:12:08.150]  everything within was inversion.
[02:12:08.150 --> 02:12:11.150]  We'd already be, you know, in Alpha Centauri's by now.
[02:12:11.150 --> 02:12:16.150]  And so that's why they're so scared, because a few governors, take DeSantis.
[02:12:16.150 --> 02:12:23.150]  He's not perfect with his pedigree, but he did later stand up against their agenda and the state did great.
[02:12:23.150 --> 02:12:24.150]  And he was a hero.
[02:12:24.150 --> 02:12:33.150]  Well, imagine having a bunch of people better than DeSantis and to spotlight how liberty is popular and works and is great.
[02:12:33.150 --> 02:12:35.150]  Liberty and prosperity.
[02:12:35.150 --> 02:12:43.150]  When you can show the people that just a different way of managing the city makes positive, tangible differences in their lives,
[02:12:43.150 --> 02:12:50.150]  their communities and the opportunities for their children, and they see their lives physically get better.
[02:12:50.150 --> 02:12:53.150]  That is the most addictive thing in the world.
[02:12:53.150 --> 02:12:56.150]  Every single person is going to want that in their city.
[02:12:56.150 --> 02:12:59.150]  We are going to be the envy of the entire country.
[02:12:59.150 --> 02:13:04.150]  And they're going to have no choice but to follow the lead that we set by.
[02:13:04.150 --> 02:13:06.150]  Yeah, let's expand on that.
[02:13:06.150 --> 02:13:07.150]  Let's expand on that.
[02:13:07.150 --> 02:13:09.150]  The East Coast of the United States is super gorgeous.
[02:13:09.150 --> 02:13:10.150]  Amazing.
[02:13:10.150 --> 02:13:11.150]  But it's commie run.
[02:13:11.150 --> 02:13:12.150]  Everybody's leaving.
[02:13:12.150 --> 02:13:16.150]  Texas has some pretty places, but it's 110 degrees in the summer and fire ants everywhere.
[02:13:17.150 --> 02:13:23.150]  I mean, I love Texas, but just because it's a little freer than beautiful California, everyone's flooding here.
[02:13:23.150 --> 02:13:27.150]  So imagine gorgeous country like Canada free.
[02:13:27.150 --> 02:13:28.150]  I'd go live there.
[02:13:28.150 --> 02:13:30.150]  I mean, I love Canada.
[02:13:30.150 --> 02:13:32.150]  People say, oh, Canada is decadent.
[02:13:32.150 --> 02:13:33.150]  They're evil.
[02:13:33.150 --> 02:13:34.150]  No, they're asleep.
[02:13:34.150 --> 02:13:35.150]  Let me ask you that.
[02:13:35.150 --> 02:13:37.150]  Why are Canadians so damn nice?
[02:13:37.150 --> 02:13:39.150]  Because I get mad at Americans being putting up with crap.
[02:13:39.150 --> 02:13:43.150]  But my God, it's good to see the Canadians are starting to get pissed, though.
[02:13:43.150 --> 02:13:45.150]  Yeah, you know what?
[02:13:45.150 --> 02:13:50.150]  Canadians have been programmed to be nice, and I try to tell Canadians, I don't want you to be nice.
[02:13:50.150 --> 02:13:54.150]  We need to transform nice into good.
[02:13:54.150 --> 02:13:58.150]  And it seems like a very minor distinction, but it's not.
[02:13:58.150 --> 02:14:02.150]  No, no, they think being nice is being good.
[02:14:02.150 --> 02:14:03.150]  It's not.
[02:14:03.150 --> 02:14:08.150]  Being good is being nice when you're supposed to be nice, but being real aggressive when somebody's running over you.
[02:14:08.150 --> 02:14:12.150]  Thank you, because a nice person will not stand up to tyranny.
[02:14:12.150 --> 02:14:15.150]  A nice person will not stand up to mandate.
[02:14:15.150 --> 02:14:19.150]  A nice person will not fight for their family in the face of injustice.
[02:14:19.150 --> 02:14:21.150]  But a good person will.
[02:14:21.150 --> 02:14:24.150]  A good person will do the right thing every single time.
[02:14:24.150 --> 02:14:26.150]  By the way, I'm going to steal that.
[02:14:26.150 --> 02:14:27.150]  I am not a nice person.
[02:14:27.150 --> 02:14:28.150]  I'm a good person.
[02:14:28.150 --> 02:14:30.150]  You can steal it all day, Alex.
[02:14:30.150 --> 02:14:34.150]  No, but that's a great – what you just said is so thoughtful.
[02:14:34.150 --> 02:14:35.150]  Skip the break, guys.
[02:14:35.150 --> 02:14:36.150]  What you're saying is so true.
[02:14:36.150 --> 02:14:38.150]  And I'm not saying I'm perfect, but, I mean, I really love people.
[02:14:38.150 --> 02:14:40.150]  I don't like seeing people get screwed over.
[02:14:40.150 --> 02:14:42.150]  And remember, it's a great novel.
[02:14:42.150 --> 02:14:44.150]  Oil got turned into There Will Be Blood.
[02:14:44.150 --> 02:14:50.150]  And he sees people doing well, and he says, you know, friend, he says, I don't like seeing people do well.
[02:14:50.150 --> 02:14:51.150]  I have a competition in me.
[02:14:51.150 --> 02:14:57.150]  Well, I don't like people taking what I got, but if they innovate and build something, I celebrate it.
[02:14:57.150 --> 02:14:59.150]  It makes us all wealthier.
[02:14:59.150 --> 02:15:02.150]  And so I don't have the globalist instinct to want to see people do bad.
[02:15:02.150 --> 02:15:08.150]  And people have to understand the Democrats are the There Will Be Blood villain, okay?
[02:15:08.150 --> 02:15:17.150]  They do not want – and the socialists, the communists, you know, the Trudeaus of the world are the most wicked, evil people behind the scenes, folks.
[02:15:17.150 --> 02:15:21.150]  Talk about the mindset of the WF in your study.
[02:15:21.150 --> 02:15:25.150]  Well, the WF is as sinister and evil as they come.
[02:15:25.150 --> 02:15:32.150]  And then they pick puppets like Trudeau for the very express purpose that he looks and sounds like an idiot.
[02:15:32.150 --> 02:15:34.150]  And why is that beneficial?
[02:15:34.150 --> 02:15:38.150]  Because it's a lot easier to forgive and forget the idiot.
[02:15:38.150 --> 02:15:40.150]  Oh, he didn't know what he was doing.
[02:15:40.150 --> 02:15:42.150]  He's just being told what to do by other people.
[02:15:42.150 --> 02:15:49.150]  But the moment you realize that behind that goofy smile and that list, he knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:15:49.150 --> 02:15:50.150]  You just said the key.
[02:15:50.150 --> 02:15:52.150]  That's why they're putting women in charge.
[02:15:52.150 --> 02:15:59.150]  And I'm not saying there aren't competent women, but they're putting ditzy women in charge and weird little fairy guys because we take it as –
[02:15:59.150 --> 02:16:01.150]  Hitler in a uniform, we see that as threatening.
[02:16:02.150 --> 02:16:07.150]  But we don't see threatening some giggling goofball when he's just a puppet.
[02:16:07.150 --> 02:16:08.150]  You just nailed it.
[02:16:08.150 --> 02:16:09.150]  That's right.
[02:16:09.150 --> 02:16:12.150]  And then it's also easier the psychological operation on the people.
[02:16:12.150 --> 02:16:20.150]  Once they get swindled, they are less likely to retaliate against the fool than they are against the person that they knew exactly what they were doing.
[02:16:20.150 --> 02:16:24.150]  And remember in ancient Europe and China, China and Japan had them too.
[02:16:24.150 --> 02:16:29.150]  The archetypal jester or the joker in the deck.
[02:16:29.150 --> 02:16:35.150]  The joker is allowed to say what nobody else is allowed to say to bring truths out and to do bad things as well.
[02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:39.150]  And so literally they use these joker types just like Biden.
[02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:40.150]  He's bumbling.
[02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:41.150]  He's falling down.
[02:16:41.150 --> 02:16:42.150]  He's pooping his pants.
[02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:44.150]  But it's okay because he's an idiot.
[02:16:45.150 --> 02:16:46.150]  Exactly.
[02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:47.150]  You hit the nail on the head.
[02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:58.150]  They don't want to put a strong leader in place because then when they have a strong leader in place and they're imposing an iron will and things that are against the people's best interest, people will rightfully be afraid and people will rightfully be aware.
[02:16:58.150 --> 02:17:06.150]  So they use these completely bumbling idiots and complete people that could never be threatening and they do the exact same sinister agenda.
[02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:10.150]  And it keeps most people apathetic, compliant and asleep to what's going on.
[02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:13.150]  Does Trudeau know that he's a bumbling idiot?
[02:17:13.150 --> 02:17:15.150]  I'm sure he does.
[02:17:15.150 --> 02:17:18.150]  I'm sure he's been told by his mother many times growing up.
[02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:20.150]  Wow.
[02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:24.150]  Well, Chris Guy, you always come up with really original but totally true thoughts.
[02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:26.150]  I mean, we're not nice.
[02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:27.150]  We're good.
[02:17:27.150 --> 02:17:28.150]  I don't want to be nice.
[02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:29.150]  I want to be good.
[02:17:29.150 --> 02:17:31.150]  And nice guys finish last, folks.
[02:17:31.150 --> 02:17:32.150]  Everybody knows that.
[02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:34.150]  Good guys finish first in the end.
[02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:37.150]  But people got to figure out who the bad guys are first.
[02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:41.150]  And you just explained how it works, how they put these dog kings, what the Muslims call it.
[02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:46.150]  It's like, why did Caligula marry his horse or make it the head of the Senate?
[02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:49.150]  To humiliate them that a horse is above you.
[02:17:49.150 --> 02:17:51.150]  So it's all part of a humiliation.
[02:17:51.150 --> 02:17:53.150]  But then people also then blame the horse.
[02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:55.150]  It's like, no, no, Biden isn't running things.
[02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:56.150]  The globalists are.
[02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:57.150]  The globalists are.
[02:17:57.150 --> 02:17:59.150]  Chris Guy, again, everybody needs to get behind you.
[02:17:59.150 --> 02:18:01.150]  Let's not wait until after the election.
[02:18:01.150 --> 02:18:03.150]  Come on right before the election.
[02:18:03.150 --> 02:18:04.150]  Come on next week.
[02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:05.150]  Come on tomorrow.
[02:18:05.150 --> 02:18:09.150]  Once you get to a good place that's got a good Internet connection, we'll be praying for you.
[02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:11.150]  You've been arrested 20-plus times.
[02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:12.150]  What are you expecting tomorrow?
[02:18:13.150 --> 02:18:17.150]  I'm expecting, if it was anyone else, I wouldn't even be charged under these circumstances.
[02:18:17.150 --> 02:18:21.150]  If it was someone they really wanted, I'd be charged and given a promise to appear.
[02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:27.150]  But because I'm in a very special category of my own, I'm pretty sure they're going to take me in.
[02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:29.150]  And they're going to try to keep me as long as possible.
[02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:31.150]  I'm going to go in around 7 in the morning.
[02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:36.150]  And technically, by law, they can't keep me more than 24 hours without bail for it.
[02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:42.150]  And since bail for it doesn't start until 9 a.m. the next morning, that would mean they have to let me out before keeping me overnight.
[02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:47.150]  If they keep me overnight, it's going to show some really bonus corruption on their end.
[02:18:47.150 --> 02:18:49.150]  Well, I'm not doing this to brag and toot my horn.
[02:18:49.150 --> 02:18:55.150]  But I want other people to realize who they wake up, who they mentor, who they talk to has ripple effects many years later.
[02:18:55.150 --> 02:18:57.150]  You've been listening to the show since you were 14.
[02:18:57.150 --> 02:18:58.150]  How old are you now?
[02:18:59.150 --> 02:19:01.150]  39. I'll be 40 this year, sir.
[02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:06.150]  Well, let me tell you, the best blessings are I can kind of sit back now and I'm not going to quit.
[02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:08.150]  People ask, wow, you're taking more vacations or whatever.
[02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:12.150]  It's almost like I spiritually know now I'll still be here, I'll still talk, I'll still fight.
[02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:19.150]  But my mission, primary mission is complete because I hear you and you articulate stuff better than I do in many ways.
[02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:21.150]  And you see it just as clear as I do.
[02:19:21.150 --> 02:19:22.150]  And I see more and more of that.
[02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:28.150]  And I'm just blessed and honored that I think I helped contribute to the great work you're doing, Chris.
[02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:33.150]  And to me, that is such an accomplishment to know no matter what happens to me, you're going to go on.
[02:19:33.150 --> 02:19:36.150]  And then you've inspired so many people, they're going to go on.
[02:19:36.150 --> 02:19:37.150]  That's what the enemy is so scared of.
[02:19:37.150 --> 02:19:39.150]  It's why they're targeting our children.
[02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:42.150]  And that's why I want to make a very good point.
[02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:45.150]  First of all, I want to say you are the one that inspired me.
[02:19:45.150 --> 02:19:46.150]  You are the one that woke me up.
[02:19:46.150 --> 02:19:52.150]  So anybody who wants to give credit to Chris Sky has to give credit to Alex Jones first because I wouldn't even be doing what I'm doing if it wasn't for you.
[02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:56.150]  And they say you should never be your hero, but I did get a chance to be mine.
[02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:58.150]  And you lived up to everything that you were supposed to live up to.
[02:19:58.150 --> 02:20:03.150]  So everybody needs to give you a round of applause because if it wasn't for you, the world wouldn't be where it is today.
[02:20:03.150 --> 02:20:04.150]  I wouldn't be where I am today.
[02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:06.150]  And I have to applaud you for that.
[02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:07.150]  Well, I appreciate you, brother.
[02:20:07.150 --> 02:20:08.150]  God bless you.
[02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:09.150]  Talk to you soon.
[02:20:09.150 --> 02:20:11.150]  People need to go to his website, ChrisSky4Change.com.
[02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:13.150]  But it's not about me, folks.
[02:20:13.150 --> 02:20:28.150]  It literally is just studying history, my family, what they saw, everything that I was shown as a child, everything that God put me through, and then the Holy Spirit experience when I was 18 and then again about 22.
[02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:32.150]  And it's 100% on Alex Jones.
[02:20:33.150 --> 02:20:39.150]  And I want you to know that so you understand you can dial in to the God that made the universe.
[02:20:39.150 --> 02:20:47.150]  God's ready to enlist you in an army for war, psychic, spiritual, economic, cultural, physical war.
[02:20:47.150 --> 02:20:51.150]  And the war means getting up at 3 a.m. when your child's sick and taking care of them.
[02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:53.150]  And the war means cooking breakfast.
[02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:54.150]  And the war means being strong.
[02:20:54.150 --> 02:21:01.150]  And the war means planting tomatoes in your backyard and being nice to your neighbors and visiting your grandma in the nursing home.
[02:21:01.150 --> 02:21:05.150]  And the war means standing up to evil people and not caring what they do to you.
[02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:07.150]  That's the key.
[02:21:07.150 --> 02:21:09.150]  The war means I'm not a nice guy.
[02:21:09.150 --> 02:21:11.150]  I'm a good guy.
[02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:13.150]  And I'm not going to roll over to you.
[02:21:13.150 --> 02:21:16.150]  I'm not going to bow to you.
[02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:18.150]  And all the ancients said it.
[02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:20.150]  It's in the Old Testament.
[02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:21.150]  It's in the New Testament.
[02:21:21.150 --> 02:21:23.150]  It's in the Egyptian text.
[02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:33.150]  It's in all the ancient texts that there is a dimension above our dimension that is five times stronger.
[02:21:33.150 --> 02:21:40.150]  And then each dimension, it just exponentially goes up like an earthquake, goes up on a Richter scale 10 times stronger each level.
[02:21:41.150 --> 02:21:48.150]  Like a 2 on the Richter scale is exponentially bigger than the first.
[02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:51.150]  And it's exponential again.
[02:21:51.150 --> 02:21:56.150]  And then now they've scanned everything and all these light sources and all these spectrometers and machines.
[02:21:56.150 --> 02:22:00.150]  And the supercomputers go, there's an outside force five times stronger holding us together.
[02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:06.150]  They had mathematicians, one in France in the 1870s, said if we could ever fly a space probe over Saturn,
[02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:13.150]  from my mathematical calculations, there'll be a hexagon on the North Pole or South Pole.
[02:22:13.150 --> 02:22:15.150]  And, of course, they flew probes over.
[02:22:15.150 --> 02:22:19.150]  It's on both poles because of the interdimensional vortex and all this mathematics.
[02:22:19.150 --> 02:22:21.150]  The point is we got powerful brains.
[02:22:21.150 --> 02:22:26.150]  I mean I wasn't given a brain like those people that could like figure out the mathematics and Einstein type stuff.
[02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:31.150]  But all I'm trying to explain to you is we've never been in Kansas.
[02:22:31.150 --> 02:22:34.150]  There's a saying, oh, we're not in Kansas anymore, Toto.
[02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:37.150]  Baby, you were never in Kansas.
[02:22:37.150 --> 02:22:43.150]  And so what I'm trying to explain to you is there is a mighty God that is so mighty you can't even imagine
[02:22:43.150 --> 02:22:50.150]  that literally wants a relationship with you right now, wants to interface, boom, wants to plug in.
[02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:53.150]  But this God does not plug in unless you want it.
[02:22:53.150 --> 02:22:58.150]  Satan will sneak around and try to stick his plug in your rear end as fast as he can.
[02:22:58.150 --> 02:23:00.150]  And you never do what hits you.
[02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:02.150]  We hit our kids because they don't know what they're doing.
[02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:04.150]  That's why we got to protect them.
[02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:10.150]  God does not stick his plug into your third eye until you ask for it.
[02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:13.150]  And God will first say, do you like that?
[02:23:13.150 --> 02:23:14.150]  Are you sure you want that?
[02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:19.150]  And for most people, God just is a comforter and pats you on the head and I'm going to take care of you.
[02:23:19.150 --> 02:23:20.150]  We love you.
[02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:21.150]  We're going to be here.
[02:23:21.150 --> 02:23:22.150]  The angels love you.
[02:23:22.150 --> 02:23:29.150]  But if God chooses you and knew you before you were created, that's not everybody.
[02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:30.150]  That's a lot of you out there.
[02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:34.150]  If you're predestined, I don't go the Calvinist view.
[02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:36.150]  It's more sophisticated than that.
[02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:40.150]  But it is true that certain people are predestined for a mission.
[02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:43.150]  And you literally get a commission.
[02:23:43.150 --> 02:23:46.150]  Everything man does is a copy of God.
[02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:49.150]  It's like the Congress commissions officers and all this.
[02:23:49.150 --> 02:23:54.150]  Well, you as listeners commission us when you buy products and spread the word and pray for us.
[02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:57.150]  It doesn't mean I'm a perfect, by the way, as an officer in the fight against Satan.
[02:23:57.150 --> 02:23:58.150]  I mean, I am.
[02:23:58.150 --> 02:23:59.150]  I'm terrible.
[02:23:59.150 --> 02:24:00.150]  I repent so much.
[02:24:00.150 --> 02:24:03.150]  Because let me tell you, I pray that I won't use the Lord's name in vain.
[02:24:03.150 --> 02:24:05.150]  I pray that I won't yell and scream and cuss.
[02:24:05.150 --> 02:24:07.150]  Notice I do it a lot less than I used to.
[02:24:07.150 --> 02:24:09.150]  I mean, 99% better.
[02:24:09.150 --> 02:24:13.150]  But I blew up in the last week on air once.
[02:24:13.150 --> 02:24:14.150]  It wasn't fake.
[02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:16.150]  I mean, I'm legitimately pissed off about what's happening.
[02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:21.150]  And I'm always being so truthful that when I feel like that, I can't hide it.
[02:24:21.150 --> 02:24:25.150]  Like when the cops pulled me over three years ago and they said, have you been drinking?
[02:24:25.150 --> 02:24:27.150]  And I said, yeah, I had a half bottle of wine.
[02:24:27.150 --> 02:24:28.150]  You're arrested.
[02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:29.150]  And I knew it was going to happen.
[02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:33.150]  But telling the truth at that moment was more important than being arrested.
[02:24:33.150 --> 02:24:34.150]  And notice I blew under.
[02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:37.150]  I told them it was a half bottle of wine.
[02:24:37.150 --> 02:24:39.150]  I drank like an hour and a half before.
[02:24:39.150 --> 02:24:42.150]  But I just said, yeah, I drank a half bottle of wine.
[02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:44.150]  You're arrested.
[02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:50.150]  And it was because I just, I tell so few lies now.
[02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:51.150]  I tell so few lies.
[02:24:51.150 --> 02:24:53.150]  I still catch myself later like, oh, that was a lie.
[02:24:53.150 --> 02:24:54.150]  Why did you do that?
[02:24:54.150 --> 02:24:56.150]  It's usually not to hurt somebody's feelings.
[02:24:56.150 --> 02:25:02.150]  But the more I don't lie, and I'm like one of the least lying people now that you'll ever meet.
[02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:04.150]  But we're lying because we're falling.
[02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:05.150]  We can't help our nature.
[02:25:05.150 --> 02:25:12.150]  Your brain synapses gear up where they don't have to worry about lying anymore.
[02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:14.150]  And then it just works way better.
[02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:16.150]  So it's not like, oh, I'm good.
[02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:17.150]  I don't lie.
[02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:19.150]  Oh, I'm such a nice person.
[02:25:19.150 --> 02:25:20.150]  I don't lie.
[02:25:21.150 --> 02:25:25.150]  It's that you don't want your brain having to calculate lies with all the other info.
[02:25:25.150 --> 02:25:29.150]  You've heard, like, liars have to think about what they said before and keep all their stories together.
[02:25:29.150 --> 02:25:31.150]  It is addicting not to lie.
[02:25:31.150 --> 02:25:36.150]  But then at the moment of truth, have you been drinking?
[02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:39.150]  And I sat there for a minute and I went, yeah, I was at a Japanese restaurant.
[02:25:39.150 --> 02:25:41.150]  I had a half a bottle of sake.
[02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:42.150]  Get out of the car.
[02:25:45.150 --> 02:25:47.150]  And they said, stand on one leg and stand.
[02:25:47.150 --> 02:25:49.150]  And I said, listen, my Achilles is gone.
[02:25:49.150 --> 02:25:51.150]  I can't really do that, but I'll try.
[02:25:51.150 --> 02:25:53.150]  They said, well, you failed the sobriety test.
[02:25:53.150 --> 02:25:56.150]  And I said, and I'll pass the breathalyzer.
[02:25:57.150 --> 02:26:02.150]  Because I knew, two glasses of wine, probably two hours before.
[02:26:03.150 --> 02:26:05.150]  And then now, 30 minutes to the police station.
[02:26:05.150 --> 02:26:06.150]  I'm like, yeah, I'll blow under.
[02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:07.150]  I did blow under.
[02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:10.150]  And when I blew under, I said, I told you.
[02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:12.150]  Told you the truth there, too, didn't I?
[02:26:13.150 --> 02:26:18.150]  So the point is, my brain couldn't make a calculation like that if there was any lying.
[02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:22.150]  Once you start eliminating lies, it just gets so good.
[02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:25.150]  I mean, it's like, because God doesn't lie either.
[02:26:25.150 --> 02:26:28.150]  So, see, you cannot get in alignment with God unless you...
[02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:32.150]  And I get militarily, you know, in the Old Testament, you know,
[02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:35.150]  the Israelites would lie to defeat an enemy and you had spies and stuff.
[02:26:37.150 --> 02:26:39.150]  And I think God forgives people for that, but I...
[02:26:39.780 --> 02:26:49.180]  And war is deception. I mean, I understand all that, but that's why war is so evil, because
[02:26:49.180 --> 02:26:55.960]  it makes us lie. And just lying is a disease. Lying is... lying is a fallen thing. See,
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:27:01.220]  we already had the knowledge of good, we were pure. Then we got the knowledge of evil. And
[02:27:01.220 --> 02:27:05.980]  the knowledge of evil is how to run scams and how to manipulate people and get power out
[02:27:05.980 --> 02:27:11.980]  of it. But it ends up hurting you in the end. It's just not good. I know I'm ranting.
[02:27:11.980 --> 02:27:17.740]  And I've got more to cover. Man, I tell you, the reason I don't cover so much of this news,
[02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:22.620]  I get ready for the show, is I just can't do all this justice. I think we are doing
[02:27:22.620 --> 02:27:31.220]  it justice here. You know, the craziest part about this is feeling like you're a liar too.
[02:27:31.220 --> 02:27:35.900]  I told stories on this show about things I did and things I saw that were all true. Doesn't
[02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:42.380]  sound real, does it? But that's because I was chosen to go through all this so that
[02:27:42.380 --> 02:27:47.740]  I would have the understanding of experience. I was not given most of my knowledge through
[02:27:47.740 --> 02:27:51.900]  revelation. I was given most of my knowledge through experience, because God knew I was
[02:27:51.900 --> 02:27:57.220]  a jackass that had to physically experience it before I knew it. And then once I went
[02:27:57.220 --> 02:28:02.380]  through that, then I was given revelation. And I have been given revelation. The problem
[02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:07.180]  is my little brain and my little soul has trouble deciphering or computing it all, but
[02:28:07.180 --> 02:28:12.180]  I'm trying. That's why I've been taking more time off, because I've learned, though I love
[02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:18.700]  being on air, the more time I spent cogitating on the information I've been given, the more
[02:28:18.700 --> 02:28:24.720]  effective I am at bringing you this knowledge that is out of this world, not of this world.
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:29.700]  And so I'm done talking about that. We'll go to break. And you know what I'll hit? I'll
[02:28:29.700 --> 02:28:35.220]  hit the Russian news. It's pretty spectacular when we come back on the other side. And then
[02:28:35.220 --> 02:28:42.780]  I'll get into the Southern Poverty Law Center listing you and your family as terrorists
[02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:46.820]  because you went to a city council meeting or a school board. Talk about dangerous evil
[02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:53.820]  people there. We'll be right back. Infowars.com. Stay with us.

[02:33:07.130 --> 02:33:22.130]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[02:33:22.130 --> 02:33:25.130]  front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:25.130 --> 02:33:35.130]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we have a situation in Ukraine, and I've got a bunch of these
[02:33:35.130 --> 02:33:39.130]  clips that get the latest Lindsey Graham on with John McCain.
[02:33:39.130 --> 02:33:42.130]  I said the latest clip I sent him.
[02:33:42.130 --> 02:33:47.130]  I played a clip last week, some Tucker Carlson, where Lindsey Graham was just over there.
[02:33:47.130 --> 02:33:51.130]  He's like, this is the best money we ever spent killing these Russians.
[02:33:51.130 --> 02:33:52.130]  God, I love it.
[02:33:52.130 --> 02:33:57.130]  It's really just sick how he's getting off on it, because you're not supposed to do that.
[02:33:57.130 --> 02:34:02.130]  Even if a war is good, you're not supposed to be just really proud of the death and licking
[02:34:02.130 --> 02:34:03.130]  your lips.
[02:34:03.130 --> 02:34:04.130]  It's really creepy.
[02:34:04.130 --> 02:34:10.130]  But then I ran back into a clip we played like three years ago before the war officially
[02:34:10.130 --> 02:34:15.130]  started, and it's Lindsey Graham with John McCain, when he already had a brain tumor
[02:34:15.130 --> 02:34:19.130]  over there, just saying, get on the offense, attack the Russians.
[02:34:19.130 --> 02:34:21.130]  We're going to get you the funding.
[02:34:21.130 --> 02:34:23.130]  We're going to get this war going.
[02:34:23.130 --> 02:34:28.130]  Well, nine years ago, the U.S. government with Soros bragged about it on CNN.
[02:34:29.130 --> 02:34:33.130]  On Fareed Zakaria, just type in George Soros brags about overthrowing Ukraine.
[02:34:33.130 --> 02:34:37.130]  They overthrow the government and burn down the Capitol building and kill a bunch of police
[02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:43.130]  and put their guy in and then started attacking the Russian areas in the east that have always
[02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:47.130]  been Russian and then got the Russians to come in and take over Crimea.
[02:34:47.130 --> 02:34:50.130]  And now they've lured them into a full war.
[02:34:50.130 --> 02:34:55.130]  And now there's been this, quote, offensive with hundreds of German tanks and hundreds
[02:34:55.130 --> 02:34:59.130]  of U.S. fighting vehicles and 30 something Bradleys.
[02:34:59.130 --> 02:35:04.130]  And I mean, hundreds of Bradleys, 30 something Abrams.
[02:35:04.130 --> 02:35:09.130]  And obviously, it takes three to one in tank battle terminology.
[02:35:09.130 --> 02:35:12.130]  Two, three to one to take over a position.
[02:35:12.130 --> 02:35:16.130]  The Russians found how much they had to lose to take over what they got.
[02:35:16.130 --> 02:35:20.130]  And so now they lost their offensive really a month ago, but the main offensive a week
[02:35:20.130 --> 02:35:25.130]  ago, and reportedly something like 500 armored vehicles have been destroyed, something like
[02:35:25.130 --> 02:35:30.130]  40 something CNN saying 30 leopard tanks, a bunch of U.S. weapons, a whole bunch of
[02:35:30.130 --> 02:35:36.130]  Bradleys because they're driving across open fields with Russian artillery just destroying
[02:35:36.130 --> 02:35:38.130]  the hell out of them.
[02:35:38.130 --> 02:35:40.130]  And Russian helicopters.
[02:35:40.130 --> 02:35:42.130]  So I'm sad about the whole thing.
[02:35:42.130 --> 02:35:43.130]  I'm not sharing either side.
[02:35:43.130 --> 02:35:45.130]  This is disgusting loss of life.
[02:35:45.130 --> 02:35:46.130]  It's dangerous.
[02:35:46.130 --> 02:35:47.130]  It's escalating toward nuclear war.
[02:35:47.130 --> 02:35:49.130]  It needs to stop.
[02:35:49.130 --> 02:35:52.130]  Even Henry Kissinger came out six months ago and said, stop.
[02:35:52.130 --> 02:35:53.130]  And the pope said stop.
[02:35:53.130 --> 02:35:56.130]  But the neocons and the crazy left, they just.
[02:35:56.130 --> 02:36:02.130]  I mean, you have the globalist pope and war criminal Henry Kissinger saying it's not good.
[02:36:02.130 --> 02:36:07.130]  So then I remember a few weeks ago when they blew the dam up.
[02:36:07.130 --> 02:36:08.130]  I get busy.
[02:36:08.130 --> 02:36:09.130]  I get tired.
[02:36:09.130 --> 02:36:10.130]  I was on air.
[02:36:10.130 --> 02:36:15.130]  I just mentioned I said, hey, I remember like months ago is actually like six months ago.
[02:36:16.130 --> 02:36:22.130]  The Ukrainian head general said that they'd missiled and shelled this this big dam.
[02:36:22.130 --> 02:36:24.130]  I always mispronounce it.
[02:36:24.130 --> 02:36:25.130]  The.
[02:36:25.130 --> 02:36:26.130]  Kakar.
[02:36:26.130 --> 02:36:27.130]  Katkova.
[02:36:27.130 --> 02:36:34.130]  And that they were ready to blow it up to flood the Russians if the Ukraine launched
[02:36:34.130 --> 02:36:35.130]  an offensive.
[02:36:35.130 --> 02:36:39.130]  So I could look at what it flooded the main Russian defenses.
[02:36:39.130 --> 02:36:43.130]  And cut them off from resupply and say, well, that's probably the Ukrainians.
[02:36:43.130 --> 02:36:47.130]  But our media was saying the Russians did it with no proof and the Russians denied it.
[02:36:47.130 --> 02:36:48.130]  So I went, well, let me let me.
[02:36:48.130 --> 02:36:50.130]  I finally got around to it a week and a half later.
[02:36:50.130 --> 02:36:54.130]  I said, let me go search engine news articles about Ukrainians say they're going to blow
[02:36:54.130 --> 02:36:55.130]  the dam up.
[02:36:55.130 --> 02:36:59.130]  And I found they blew up three other dams and bragged about it and where they said they
[02:36:59.130 --> 02:37:05.130]  attacked this dam, the big one that just flooded Crimea and that they were going to attack
[02:37:05.130 --> 02:37:06.130]  and they had attacked it.
[02:37:06.130 --> 02:37:08.130]  So I was going to show you those articles.
[02:37:08.130 --> 02:37:13.130]  So, I mean, it's like it's like Biden saying, I'm going to blow up the dam or I'm going
[02:37:13.130 --> 02:37:15.130]  to blow up the Nord Stream two.
[02:37:15.130 --> 02:37:18.130]  And even April Gillespie, the U.S. ambassador, says it.
[02:37:18.130 --> 02:37:22.130]  Then they do it and they say that Putin did it with no proof.
[02:37:22.130 --> 02:37:25.130]  And then if you say, hey, I think the West might have done this.
[02:37:25.130 --> 02:37:27.130]  You get censored.
[02:37:27.130 --> 02:37:29.130]  Because you tell the truth.
[02:37:29.130 --> 02:37:31.130]  So they blow up the biggest dam in Eastern Europe.
[02:37:31.130 --> 02:37:32.130]  That's what they say.
[02:37:32.130 --> 02:37:35.130]  It's right by the biggest nuclear reactor in Eastern Europe.
[02:37:35.130 --> 02:37:36.130]  Both are right there.
[02:37:37.130 --> 02:37:39.130]  And it floods the Russian positions.
[02:37:40.130 --> 02:37:43.130]  And then they say the Russians did it.
[02:37:43.130 --> 02:37:48.130]  It's like when Zelensky fired last year two missiles into Poland and blamed the Russians.
[02:37:48.130 --> 02:37:49.130]  This is very dangerous.
[02:37:49.130 --> 02:37:51.130]  And called for a nuclear attack on Russia.
[02:37:51.130 --> 02:37:53.130]  I'm not against the Ukrainians.
[02:37:53.130 --> 02:37:56.130]  I don't want to have a nuclear war for you guys.
[02:37:56.130 --> 02:37:57.130]  OK?
[02:37:57.130 --> 02:37:59.130]  Especially if you're a corrupt regime.
[02:37:59.130 --> 02:38:01.130]  So just just stop.
[02:38:01.130 --> 02:38:03.130]  You've got $200 billion.
[02:38:03.130 --> 02:38:05.130]  We have bridges collapsing.
[02:38:05.130 --> 02:38:06.130]  My friends are homeless.
[02:38:06.130 --> 02:38:07.130]  I've never been to Ukraine.
[02:38:07.130 --> 02:38:08.130]  I'm not your enemy.
[02:38:08.130 --> 02:38:15.130]  But, I mean, you've got a weird gay prostitute who dresses in high heels and black fishnets.
[02:38:15.130 --> 02:38:18.130]  Saying he wants a percentage of our GDP.
[02:38:18.130 --> 02:38:20.130]  I mean, just leave me alone, man.
[02:38:20.130 --> 02:38:22.130]  You want to go kill Russians?
[02:38:22.130 --> 02:38:23.130]  You suit up and you go do it.
[02:38:23.130 --> 02:38:24.130]  I'm not part of it.
[02:38:26.130 --> 02:38:28.130]  So here's some of the reports here.
[02:38:28.130 --> 02:38:38.130]  If anyone thinks the Russians blew up the Krakow dam and flooded their own positions,
[02:38:38.130 --> 02:38:42.130]  making an amphibious assault possible while cutting off the water supply to Crimea,
[02:38:42.130 --> 02:38:44.130]  seek help immediately.
[02:38:44.130 --> 02:38:46.130]  It's curable, but it may take time.
[02:38:47.130 --> 02:38:48.130]  And then it goes on.
[02:38:48.130 --> 02:38:49.130]  Here's some of the headlines.
[02:38:49.130 --> 02:38:51.130]  April 27, 2022.
[02:38:51.130 --> 02:38:54.130]  Ukrainians flood village to keep Russians at bay.
[02:38:54.130 --> 02:38:55.130]  New York Times.
[02:38:56.130 --> 02:38:58.130]  I've got a bunch of examples.
[02:38:58.130 --> 02:39:06.130]  Ukraine has blamed Russia for Nord Stream, Poland missile, Kremlin drones, Dugin assassination,
[02:39:06.130 --> 02:39:11.130]  prison, Kremlin breach, Kerch breach, everything.
[02:39:11.130 --> 02:39:12.130]  And now the dam.
[02:39:12.130 --> 02:39:20.130]  After you destroyed Nord Stream, the bridge, the prison, flood your own positions to ensure victory.
[02:39:21.130 --> 02:39:22.130]  Blame the Russians.
[02:39:22.130 --> 02:39:28.130]  And here's an article where, again, 2022, they flooded the villages by blowing up dams.
[02:39:31.130 --> 02:39:32.130]  Why would Ukraine do this?
[02:39:32.130 --> 02:39:33.130]  I don't know.
[02:39:33.130 --> 02:39:35.130]  Maybe Major General can explain it.
[02:39:35.130 --> 02:39:42.130]  The Ukrainians, he said, even conducted a test strike with a missile launcher on one of the floodgates at the dam.
[02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:49.130]  And they went on to say, we may blow it up to stop a Russian defense when we assault.
[02:39:50.130 --> 02:39:51.130]  Kakovka.
[02:39:51.130 --> 02:39:52.130]  Damn.
[02:39:52.130 --> 02:39:53.130]  Kahovka.
[02:39:55.130 --> 02:40:00.130]  And by the way, obviously, this is CG, computer generated of Zelensky.
[02:40:00.130 --> 02:40:10.130]  But this is actually a show he was part of where he kills the Ukrainian parliament and becomes a dictator.
[02:40:11.130 --> 02:40:13.130]  But, of course, that's what Soros really did.
[02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:17.130]  Let's go and play the warmonger duo.
[02:40:17.130 --> 02:40:21.130]  McCain and Graham in 2017 is the year of the offensive.
[02:40:21.130 --> 02:40:22.130]  Go kill the Russkies.
[02:40:22.130 --> 02:40:23.130]  Here it is.
[02:40:24.130 --> 02:40:25.130]  Your fight is our fight.
[02:40:29.130 --> 02:40:31.130]  2017 will be the year of offense.
[02:40:34.130 --> 02:40:39.130]  All of us will go back to Washington and we will push the case against Russia.
[02:40:40.130 --> 02:40:42.130]  Enough of a Russian aggression.
[02:40:44.130 --> 02:40:46.130]  It is time for them to pay a heavier price.
[02:40:51.130 --> 02:40:52.130]  I believe you will win.
[02:40:52.130 --> 02:40:54.130]  I am convinced you will win.
[02:40:54.130 --> 02:40:59.130]  And we will do everything we can to provide you with what you need to win.
[02:41:00.130 --> 02:41:01.130]  I believe you will win.
[02:41:01.130 --> 02:41:03.130]  I am convinced you will win.
[02:41:03.130 --> 02:41:09.130]  And we will do everything we can to provide you with what you need to win.
[02:41:24.130 --> 02:41:26.130]  And now we go kill Russians.
[02:41:27.130 --> 02:41:30.130]  So let me show you a new video out of Kharkovka.
[02:41:32.130 --> 02:41:36.130]  So now that the reservoir has gone down in that valley,
[02:41:38.130 --> 02:41:41.130]  it is showing the dead from World War II.
[02:41:41.130 --> 02:41:48.130]  And, yes, it was built in 1950 after, but there were so many hundreds of thousands of dead German and Russian and Ukrainian soldiers
[02:41:48.130 --> 02:41:53.130]  that there's hours of these videos of just dead bodies, skeletons everywhere.
[02:41:53.130 --> 02:41:57.130]  One of them has the German kirtzel helmet on because it had been strapped on.
[02:41:57.130 --> 02:41:59.130]  You can see the strap behind it.
[02:41:59.130 --> 02:42:06.130]  And he's dead in the mud right there where he died in 1944-45.
[02:42:07.130 --> 02:42:09.130]  And there's just skeletons all over the place.
[02:42:10.130 --> 02:42:12.130]  It's all a forgotten war. It's all over now.
[02:42:12.130 --> 02:42:16.130]  You know, that German soldier probably thought he was fighting for the good guys.
[02:42:17.130 --> 02:42:22.130]  But that's, that's where we're headed. That's what's going on here.
[02:42:25.130 --> 02:42:27.130]  There's a nuclear wasteland.
[02:42:29.130 --> 02:42:34.130]  It was once said, we don't know, you know, we know how World War III will be fought with nuclear weapons,
[02:42:34.130 --> 02:42:38.130]  but we know that World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.
[02:42:40.130 --> 02:42:42.130]  That was Einstein.
[02:42:42.130 --> 02:42:44.130]  That was Einstein.
[02:42:45.130 --> 02:42:51.130]  I probably butchered the quote, but basically it's World War III will be fought with nuclear weapons,
[02:42:51.130 --> 02:42:53.130]  World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.
[02:42:54.130 --> 02:42:57.130]  And I got an Alexander Shultz in Ancient Quote II when we come back. Stick with us.
[02:42:57.130 --> 02:43:03.130]  Two amazing nootropics, that means brain power, are back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com,
[02:43:03.130 --> 02:43:06.130]  and they're both 50% off.
[02:43:06.130 --> 02:43:10.130]  We haven't offered these for 50% off since last Christmas.
[02:43:10.130 --> 02:43:14.130]  These are amazing products, and for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.
[02:43:14.130 --> 02:43:19.130]  Brain Force Ultra hits in 15 minutes, only lasts three hours with no hangover.
[02:43:19.130 --> 02:43:22.130]  It is a game changer. Nobody's got something close to this.
[02:43:22.130 --> 02:43:26.130]  Then our Brain Force Plus is a good, basic, clean nootropic,
[02:43:26.130 --> 02:43:30.130]  gives you four to six hours of amazing energy, again, with no hangover, no jitters.
[02:43:30.130 --> 02:43:36.130]  Both products back in stock, InfoWarsTour.com, for 50% off, and it funds the Info War.
[02:43:36.130 --> 02:43:42.130]  So get your Brain Force Ultra, your Brain Force Plus, and your Turbo Force, all exclusively at InfoWarsTour.com,
[02:43:42.130 --> 02:43:48.130]  and know, you're funding the second American Revolution, 1776 worldwide.
[02:43:48.130 --> 02:43:54.130]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, and the answer for energy is Brain Force.
[02:43:57.130 --> 02:44:02.130]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth,
[02:44:02.130 --> 02:44:05.130]  and they've got our children drinking that.
[02:44:05.130 --> 02:44:11.130]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[02:44:11.130 --> 02:44:16.130]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour Group.
[02:44:16.130 --> 02:44:19.130]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[02:44:19.130 --> 02:44:25.130]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price,
[02:44:25.130 --> 02:44:29.130]  and they made it as good in all the studies.
[02:44:29.130 --> 02:44:32.130]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[02:44:32.130 --> 02:44:36.130]  But you can go pay two or three times. There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:44:36.130 --> 02:44:41.130]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[02:44:41.130 --> 02:44:47.130]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[02:44:47.130 --> 02:44:50.130]  You should also filter your shower water. That's another way you absorb this crap.
[02:44:50.130 --> 02:44:52.130]  But I'm done talking about that.
[02:44:52.130 --> 02:44:55.130]  The point is, you can get the filters at InfoWarsTour.com. They're discounted right now.
[02:44:55.130 --> 02:44:57.130]  Finally back in stock.
[02:44:58.130 --> 02:45:01.130]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:45:01.130 --> 02:45:03.130]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:45:03.130 --> 02:45:06.130]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:45:06.130 --> 02:45:11.130]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:45:11.130 --> 02:45:15.130]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:45:15.130 --> 02:45:20.130]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:45:20.130 --> 02:45:24.130]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:45:24.130 --> 02:45:28.130]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:45:29.130 --> 02:45:34.130]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:45:34.130 --> 02:45:38.130]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[02:45:38.130 --> 02:45:42.130]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTour.com,
[02:45:42.130 --> 02:45:45.130]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life,
[02:45:45.130 --> 02:45:47.130]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:45:47.130 --> 02:45:51.130]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:45:51.130 --> 02:45:54.130]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTour.com,
[02:45:54.130 --> 02:45:57.130]  our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[02:45:57.130 --> 02:46:01.130]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[02:46:01.130 --> 02:46:06.130]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:46:06.130 --> 02:46:10.130]  They are both clones of national best-selling products
[02:46:10.130 --> 02:46:14.130]  from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker that are listeners and patriots
[02:46:14.130 --> 02:46:19.130]  that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[02:46:19.130 --> 02:46:23.130]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[02:46:23.130 --> 02:46:28.130]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain
[02:46:28.130 --> 02:46:31.130]  and to also make your nerves healthier,
[02:46:31.130 --> 02:46:36.130]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[02:46:36.130 --> 02:46:38.130]  There's major research behind this all.
[02:46:38.130 --> 02:46:44.130]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve Renew from InfoWarsMD
[02:46:44.130 --> 02:46:48.130]  exclusively at InfoWarsTour.com right now.
[02:46:48.130 --> 02:46:51.130]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[02:46:51.130 --> 02:46:56.130]  You'll find them exclusively at InfoWarsTour.com, and they fund our operation.
[02:46:57.300 --> 02:47:05.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:11.300 --> 02:47:20.300]  Alexander Sholtsanitsyn, the most important, influential, anti-Soviet, anti-communist,
[02:47:20.300 --> 02:47:27.300]  dissident of the Soviet Union era, and a true intellectual towering above basically anybody else.
[02:47:27.300 --> 02:47:29.300]  Read three of his books.
[02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:36.300]  Every page gives you a headache because it's so thought-provoking and powerful and deep and multifaceted.
[02:47:36.300 --> 02:47:39.300]  I'm going to talk about Alexander Sholtsanitsyn in time into O.J. Simpson.
[02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:41.300]  Don't think anybody's ever done that.
[02:47:41.300 --> 02:47:47.300]  O.J. is a very likable fellow.
[02:47:47.300 --> 02:47:50.300]  You know, he gets millions of views for every Twitter video he puts out.
[02:47:50.300 --> 02:47:55.300]  And I've only seen a few of them, but I saw one in the feed about Trump,
[02:47:55.300 --> 02:47:58.300]  so I thought, let me look at a few more of his videos this morning.
[02:47:58.300 --> 02:48:00.300]  And one really struck me where he said,
[02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:07.300]  it's American suicide to question the government and not trust them.
[02:48:07.300 --> 02:48:14.300]  No, O.J., that's the definition of national suicide.
[02:48:14.300 --> 02:48:17.300]  Okay?
[02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:21.300]  You need to love your country if it has a good constitution and system and good history.
[02:48:21.300 --> 02:48:24.300]  If it doesn't, you need to set up a new one.
[02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:28.300]  But you're the one that says Mark Furman planted your blood at the scene
[02:48:28.300 --> 02:48:32.300]  and planted your glove at the scene, even though the glove had a cut in it
[02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:37.300]  on the same spot you had a cut on your finger from a knife.
[02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:39.300]  I think you killed your wife.
[02:48:39.300 --> 02:48:42.300]  I get it, you were pissed off, she was cheating on you and getting your money out of control.
[02:48:42.300 --> 02:48:48.300]  But whoever did it, the point is you say the police are white supremacists
[02:48:48.300 --> 02:48:53.300]  and that they framed you and you can't trust the government at the local level.
[02:48:53.300 --> 02:48:56.300]  I give it to you, maybe they did.
[02:48:56.300 --> 02:49:04.300]  But then you turn around and say I'm a Russian agent if I don't believe them on the shots
[02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:06.300]  and on everything else they lie to us about?
[02:49:06.300 --> 02:49:13.300]  Come on man, you're just kissing the system's ass.
[02:49:13.300 --> 02:49:17.300]  So here's Alexander Shultz, an agent who spent decades in a forced labor camp.
[02:49:17.300 --> 02:49:24.300]  He says we know they are lying, they know they are lying, they know we know they are lying,
[02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:31.300]  we know they know we know they are lying, but they are still lying.
[02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:34.300]  Now that's a boiled down version.
[02:49:35.300 --> 02:49:37.300]  Here's the full quote.
[02:49:37.300 --> 02:49:39.300]  We know that they are lying.
[02:49:39.300 --> 02:49:41.300]  They know that they know they are lying.
[02:49:41.300 --> 02:49:43.300]  They even know that we know they are lying.
[02:49:43.300 --> 02:49:48.300]  We also know that they know we know they are lying too.
[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:54.300]  They of course know that we certainly know they know that we know they are lying to us as well.
[02:49:54.300 --> 02:49:56.300]  But they are still lying.
[02:49:56.300 --> 02:50:03.300]  In our country, the lie has become not just a moral category, but the pillar of industry of this country.
[02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:11.300]  That is what America is run by at the top.
[02:50:11.300 --> 02:50:16.300]  And if we accept this, riding from the head down, we are that.
[02:50:16.300 --> 02:50:18.300]  I reject it, I am not that.
[02:50:18.300 --> 02:50:20.300]  It's like for the LGBT people.
[02:50:20.300 --> 02:50:24.300]  Okay, if you don't support grooming kids and trying to cut their penises off and breasts off,
[02:50:24.300 --> 02:50:26.300]  come out and say you are against it.
[02:50:26.300 --> 02:50:30.300]  Because I am saying this is not my government, it doesn't represent me.
[02:50:30.300 --> 02:50:36.300]  You got to stand for something or people are going to take your identity and say that you belong to this.
[02:50:36.300 --> 02:50:39.300]  So here is O.J. Simpson,
[02:50:43.300 --> 02:50:47.300]  who made Jim Brown's death all about him in a video.
[02:50:47.300 --> 02:50:49.300]  I ended up watching like 10 O.J. Simpson videos.
[02:50:49.300 --> 02:50:52.300]  He is a very likable guy, you can't stop watching him actually.
[02:50:52.300 --> 02:50:54.300]  I am intellectually going, this guy is not good.
[02:50:54.300 --> 02:50:56.300]  But damn, I sure like him.
[02:50:56.300 --> 02:50:58.300]  He'd be fun to hang out and drink a beer with.
[02:50:58.300 --> 02:51:03.300]  But here he is telling you, questioning and not trusting your government is what Xi Jinping wants.
[02:51:03.300 --> 02:51:05.300]  Oh yeah, China owns Hollywood now.
[02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:07.300]  They own like four of the six production houses.
[02:51:07.300 --> 02:51:11.300]  And they fund all the black on white stuff and whites are evil.
[02:51:11.300 --> 02:51:13.300]  Yes, it's actually true.
[02:51:13.300 --> 02:51:15.300]  But does he speak out against that?
[02:51:15.300 --> 02:51:19.300]  No, no, no, he just sits there and tells you that if you don't trust the voting systems
[02:51:19.300 --> 02:51:21.300]  or if you don't trust the Justice Department,
[02:51:23.300 --> 02:51:25.300]  well you might be working for the Russians.
[02:51:25.300 --> 02:51:27.300]  Listen to this for yourself, here it is.
[02:51:29.300 --> 02:51:31.300]  Hey Twitter world, yours truly here.
[02:51:33.300 --> 02:51:35.300]  Let me see if I got this right.
[02:51:37.300 --> 02:51:39.300]  Don't trust the media.
[02:51:39.300 --> 02:51:43.300]  Don't trust our security agencies, FBI, CIA.
[02:51:43.300 --> 02:51:46.300]  Don't trust the Justice Department.
[02:51:46.300 --> 02:51:48.300]  Don't trust the executive office.
[02:51:49.300 --> 02:51:55.300]  And don't trust our election procedures, our voting.
[02:51:57.300 --> 02:52:08.300]  Isn't this what Xi Jinping and Putin, all my life, this would be called communist propaganda.
[02:52:10.300 --> 02:52:12.300]  And now we're doing it to ourselves.
[02:52:14.300 --> 02:52:16.300]  I'm just saying.
[02:52:16.300 --> 02:52:18.300]  Take care.
[02:52:18.300 --> 02:52:23.300]  Except we have the communist in charge right now telling us our country's bad.
[02:52:23.300 --> 02:52:25.300]  And we should all kill each other.
[02:52:25.300 --> 02:52:27.300]  And we're saying you can't trust who's hijacked the country.
[02:52:27.300 --> 02:52:30.300]  And you go oh no, you must be a communist if you're against that.
[02:52:30.300 --> 02:52:33.300]  Here let me play a Trump clip for you where he explains it.
[02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:35.300]  He says calling them globalists isn't enough.
[02:52:35.300 --> 02:52:37.300]  They call themselves globalists by the way.
[02:52:37.300 --> 02:52:41.300]  He says they're really communist.
[02:52:42.300 --> 02:52:46.300]  Go ahead and roll that clip.
[02:52:46.300 --> 02:52:50.300]  The stakes of this election could not be more stark either.
[02:52:50.300 --> 02:52:53.300]  We have a communist state.
[02:52:53.300 --> 02:52:55.300]  You know they used to use the term deep state.
[02:52:55.300 --> 02:52:56.300]  I'm stopping it.
[02:52:56.300 --> 02:52:57.300]  I'm using it Marxist.
[02:52:57.300 --> 02:52:59.300]  I'm using it fascist.
[02:52:59.300 --> 02:53:02.300]  I'm using communist because deep state is far too soft.
[02:53:02.300 --> 02:53:04.300]  It is.
[02:53:04.300 --> 02:53:06.300]  Far too soft.
[02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:12.300]  So O.J., Trump also talked about this because that's what's in there.
[02:53:12.300 --> 02:53:14.300]  I started looking at the Hunter stuff a couple of years ago.
[02:53:14.300 --> 02:53:17.300]  And I told my crew I'm ordering you not to look at it.
[02:53:17.300 --> 02:53:18.300]  I rarely tell crew what to do.
[02:53:18.300 --> 02:53:20.300]  I said that's child porn.
[02:53:20.300 --> 02:53:22.300]  And the FBI has it.
[02:53:22.300 --> 02:53:24.300]  Independent media can look at it.
[02:53:24.300 --> 02:53:26.300]  We're going to get set up looking at this.
[02:53:26.300 --> 02:53:27.300]  And that's what Trump says.
[02:53:27.300 --> 02:53:30.300]  It's him having sex with like 12-year-olds, Hunter Biden.
[02:53:30.300 --> 02:53:33.300]  But the bigger thing is he says I'm a Chinese communist agent.
[02:53:33.300 --> 02:53:35.300]  I'm under control of the head of the CCP.
[02:53:35.300 --> 02:53:37.300]  In audios he sends out.
[02:53:37.300 --> 02:53:38.300]  That's real off the laptop.
[02:53:38.300 --> 02:53:40.300]  I don't deny it.
[02:53:40.300 --> 02:53:47.300]  So, hey, O.J., you've got the Judge Department prosecuting Trump for doing nothing
[02:53:47.300 --> 02:53:53.300]  while protecting Biden and people, and you're telling us we shouldn't question that?
[02:53:53.300 --> 02:53:58.300]  We should just trust that?
[02:53:58.300 --> 02:54:01.300]  You know, I bet you if I went to him, this is hypothetical, I wouldn't do this.
[02:54:01.300 --> 02:54:04.300]  If I went to O.J.'s house and I waited for him to come out to play golf in the morning,
[02:54:04.300 --> 02:54:08.300]  I followed him to his golf course, I could find out where he lives, go there,
[02:54:08.300 --> 02:54:12.300]  and I bet if I got out of my car with a machete, I said, how are you doing, O.J.?
[02:54:12.300 --> 02:54:13.300]  I want to talk to you.
[02:54:13.300 --> 02:54:20.300]  I bet O.J. would pull a gun out or run or fight me or whatever.
[02:54:20.300 --> 02:54:22.300]  I'd say, hey, O.J., don't be a Russian spy.
[02:54:22.300 --> 02:54:24.300]  I mean, don't question this.
[02:54:24.300 --> 02:54:25.300]  I just got out of my car.
[02:54:25.300 --> 02:54:26.300]  I got a machete.
[02:54:26.300 --> 02:54:28.300]  I'm walking towards you.
[02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:30.300]  That's kind of Soviet propaganda.
[02:54:30.300 --> 02:54:35.300]  That's kind of Chinese propaganda that you're thinking for yourself that I'm bugging my eyes out at you,
[02:54:35.300 --> 02:54:41.300]  walking up on you with a machete or maybe a butcher knife, maybe a dagger.
[02:54:41.300 --> 02:54:43.300]  Maybe the Jews can't move as quick as you used to.
[02:54:43.300 --> 02:54:48.300]  The point is, is that when you're getting approached with a guy with a knife, what are you going to do?
[02:54:48.300 --> 02:54:51.300]  You're going to just think I'm there to play patty cake with you a little bit?
[02:54:51.300 --> 02:54:55.300]  You know all about that, approaching people with knives.
[02:54:55.300 --> 02:55:04.300]  So that's what I'm getting at here with you is you're doing that to lick the butt of the New World Order.
[02:55:04.300 --> 02:55:10.300]  You're doing that to kiss the ass of the system like you always did, and it's disgusting.
[02:55:10.300 --> 02:55:19.300]  That's where I stand on O.J. Simpson.
[02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:23.300]  I mean, it just makes me want to throw up.
[02:55:23.300 --> 02:55:26.300]  Hey, O.J., why don't you come out against the transgender stuff with our kids?
[02:55:26.300 --> 02:55:28.300]  Why don't you come out against all this stuff?
[02:55:28.300 --> 02:55:32.300]  No, you're just going to sit there and tell us, trust the government.
[02:55:32.300 --> 02:55:34.300]  Whatever it does, you're a Russian agent.
[02:55:34.300 --> 02:55:38.300]  I think I've heard that before.
[02:55:38.300 --> 02:55:43.300]  I'll give you one better, hypothetically.
[02:55:43.300 --> 02:55:48.300]  Well, do I really need to give you one better?
[02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:50.300]  We've been lied to.
[02:55:50.300 --> 02:55:51.300]  We've been assaulted.
[02:55:51.300 --> 02:55:55.300]  We've been given poison shots.
[02:55:55.300 --> 02:55:58.300]  And now we're tired of it.
[02:55:58.300 --> 02:56:02.300]  And let me tell people that serve the system like O.J. Simpson and everybody else,
[02:56:02.300 --> 02:56:06.300]  you think kissing the ass of this system, when it's going belly up smart,
[02:56:06.300 --> 02:56:10.300]  you're only going to ensure our group destruction in the process.
[02:56:10.300 --> 02:56:13.300]  It needs to stop.
[02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:16.300]  I got some more news I'm going to hit as we go into the next hour.
[02:56:16.300 --> 02:56:19.300]  And then, Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central.
[02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:23.300]  Please remember, Erwin Schroer is coming up in about an hour and five minutes
[02:56:23.300 --> 02:56:25.300]  at Infowars.com.
[02:56:25.300 --> 02:56:26.300]  Ford's live show at the War Room.
[02:56:26.300 --> 02:56:27.300]  Harrison Smith's doing a great job.
[02:56:27.300 --> 02:56:30.300]  We do mornings at 8 a.m.
[02:56:30.300 --> 02:56:31.300]  And I'm back in the saddle.
[02:56:31.300 --> 02:56:33.300]  I'll be doing a Saturday show and a Sunday show this week.
[02:56:33.300 --> 02:56:35.300]  I'll be working around the clock.
[02:56:35.300 --> 02:56:36.300]  So much is happening.
[02:56:36.300 --> 02:56:39.300]  We've got a bunch of big guests coming up later in the week as well.
[02:56:39.300 --> 02:56:45.300]  Please don't forget that I'm not funded by big corporations or by Avis Rent-A-Car
[02:56:45.300 --> 02:56:47.300]  like OJ Simpson or by George Soros.
[02:56:47.300 --> 02:56:49.300]  I'm funded by you.
[02:56:49.300 --> 02:56:51.300]  And I'm here to tell the truth.
[02:56:51.300 --> 02:56:53.300]  And if you want me to keep fighting in the fight, I'll do it.
[02:56:53.300 --> 02:56:55.300]  But I need funds to continue on.
[02:56:55.300 --> 02:56:56.300]  People thought we'd already be gone.
[02:56:56.300 --> 02:56:58.300]  We're still here.
[02:56:58.300 --> 02:56:59.300]  A lot of folks hung up the towel.
[02:56:59.300 --> 02:57:00.300]  Well, Jones is done.
[02:57:00.300 --> 02:57:02.300]  But our hardcore listeners, they knew I was for real.
[02:57:02.300 --> 02:57:03.300]  They kept backing us.
[02:57:03.300 --> 02:57:09.300]  And thanks to that hardcore stalwart, hold fast, remnant minority,
[02:57:09.300 --> 02:57:10.300]  we're still here.
[02:57:10.300 --> 02:57:11.300]  But I don't want to just be here.
[02:57:11.300 --> 02:57:13.300]  I want to be on the offense.
[02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:14.300]  I got great products you already need.

[02:58:44.300 --> 02:58:47.300]  Brain Force
[02:58:47.300 --> 02:58:48.300]  You wanted to plug Brain Force.
[02:58:48.300 --> 02:58:49.300]  Do you like Brain Force?
[02:58:49.300 --> 02:58:50.300]  Yeah.
[02:58:50.300 --> 02:58:52.300]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[02:58:52.300 --> 02:58:54.300]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[02:58:54.300 --> 02:58:56.300]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkiewicz,
[02:58:56.300 --> 02:58:58.300]  four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[02:58:58.300 --> 02:59:00.300]  and now two books with Alex Jones?
[02:59:00.300 --> 02:59:04.300]  That's because I use Brain Force every day.
[02:59:04.300 --> 02:59:08.300]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[02:59:08.300 --> 02:59:12.300]  And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[02:59:12.300 --> 02:59:17.300]  The one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is Brain Force.
[02:59:17.300 --> 02:59:21.300]  I'll take Brain Force in the morning right before I go to my computer,
[02:59:21.300 --> 02:59:25.300]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[02:59:25.300 --> 02:59:29.300]  So it really is true that Brain Force is something I use every day,
[02:59:29.300 --> 02:59:31.300]  and it helps me with my writing.
[02:59:31.300 --> 02:59:32.300]  All right. We love you.
[02:59:32.300 --> 02:59:33.300]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:33.300 --> 02:59:37.300]  Get your Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, and Turbo Force at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:37.300 --> 02:59:39.300]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[02:59:39.300 --> 02:59:49.300]  Brain Force
[02:59:49.300 --> 02:59:53.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:59:53.300 --> 02:59:55.300]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:56.700 --> 03:00:08.180]  Every move the globalists make, every breath they take, I'll be watching them.
[03:00:08.180 --> 03:00:15.020]  Gerald Cilente always does a great job, he's about to take over, with Troy in an hour.
[03:00:15.020 --> 03:00:25.780]  You know, just watching O.J. Simpson, smooth operator, state of the world, you should trust
[03:00:25.780 --> 03:00:29.140]  your government, you should trust the voting, you should trust the intelligence agencies,
[03:00:29.140 --> 03:00:31.380]  you should do whatever they say.
[03:00:31.380 --> 03:00:36.300]  When they told us Trump was a Russian agent, it turns out that was a fraud and a lie from
[03:00:36.300 --> 03:00:40.020]  the beginning, and all the fake impeachments were a lie, and everything else they said
[03:00:40.020 --> 03:00:41.020]  was a lie.
[03:00:41.020 --> 03:00:45.060]  They've covered up for all this corruption, and then we've got all these big pharma companies
[03:00:45.060 --> 03:00:52.300]  that it turns out not only put poison drugs from Vioxx to, I mean the list goes on and
[03:00:52.300 --> 03:00:59.020]  on on the market, hillbilly heroin, Oxycontin, knowing it's going to kill people and they
[03:00:59.020 --> 03:01:01.500]  don't care.
[03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:04.660]  And now they put these shots in the market that don't protect you and make you sicker
[03:01:04.660 --> 03:01:07.420]  and die and then hurt you.
[03:01:07.420 --> 03:01:12.140]  And O.J.'s like, hey, I'm just saying, questioning things is what the Russians want.
[03:01:12.140 --> 03:01:13.140]  Really?
[03:01:13.140 --> 03:01:14.460]  Did the Russians kill your grandma?
[03:01:14.460 --> 03:01:18.260]  Did the Russians open the southern border of the Russian ship in the fentanyl?
[03:01:19.100 --> 03:01:22.900]  Did the Russians try to teach your seven-year-old how to cut their dick off?
[03:01:22.900 --> 03:01:24.940]  I'm tired of scapegoating the Russians.
[03:01:24.940 --> 03:01:27.980]  If the Russians did anything to me, I'd be their enemy.
[03:01:27.980 --> 03:01:29.420]  They haven't done anything to me.
[03:01:29.420 --> 03:01:37.020]  I'm not a Russophile, but I'm not a Russophobe.
[03:01:37.020 --> 03:01:38.340]  I am a globalist phobe.
[03:01:38.340 --> 03:01:39.620]  I hate them.
[03:01:39.620 --> 03:01:41.540]  I know they're the biggest dog on the block.
[03:01:41.540 --> 03:01:42.540]  They're the scientists.
[03:01:42.540 --> 03:01:43.660]  They're the crazy people.
[03:01:43.660 --> 03:01:44.660]  They're the new world order.
[03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:46.900]  They're the ones killing everybody.
[03:01:46.900 --> 03:01:53.020]  There's Peter Christian Goethe, medical doctor, former leader of one of the biggest medical
[03:01:53.020 --> 03:01:57.780]  centers in Copenhagen, Denmark, talking about the elephant in the room, the prescription
[03:01:57.780 --> 03:02:02.580]  drugs are the third leading cause of death, not just here, but in Europe as well.
[03:02:02.580 --> 03:02:04.820]  And they know it.
[03:02:04.820 --> 03:02:06.500]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[03:02:06.500 --> 03:02:10.340]  But they don't just pitch you drugs like Randesivir that they knew would turn your kidneys off
[03:02:10.340 --> 03:02:11.340]  and kill you when you had COVID.
[03:02:11.340 --> 03:02:16.060]  They then try to block the nutraceuticals and the supplements and the things that are
[03:02:16.060 --> 03:02:18.580]  on record defending you.
[03:02:18.580 --> 03:02:21.180]  But more and more doctors are doing the same thing.
[03:02:21.180 --> 03:02:22.700]  They're saying, this is a fraud.
[03:02:22.700 --> 03:02:24.420]  More and more nurses are coming out.
[03:02:24.420 --> 03:02:25.780]  More and more people are blowing the whistle.
[03:02:25.780 --> 03:02:32.380]  They're not listening to OJ Simpson, saying, just trust the system and do whatever they
[03:02:32.380 --> 03:02:39.500]  say and everything will be fine, or you end up like Joan Rivers when she exposed Big Mike.
[03:02:39.500 --> 03:02:41.580]  And he knows that.
[03:02:41.580 --> 03:02:43.900]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[03:02:43.900 --> 03:02:47.300]  So here's that clip of the doctor.
[03:02:47.300 --> 03:02:52.380]  And then we'll go straight to Gerald Salente.
[03:02:52.380 --> 03:02:53.540]  My name is Peter Gertje.
[03:02:53.540 --> 03:02:59.020]  I'm a director of the Nordic Cochrane Center in Copenhagen and professor of research design
[03:02:59.020 --> 03:03:02.300]  and analysis at the University of Copenhagen.
[03:03:02.300 --> 03:03:08.020]  Two years ago, I found out that our prescription drugs are the third leading cause of death
[03:03:08.020 --> 03:03:11.700]  after heart disease and cancer.
[03:03:11.700 --> 03:03:17.660]  Our drugs kill around 200,000 people in America every year.
[03:03:17.660 --> 03:03:23.500]  And half of these people die while they do what their doctors told them.
[03:03:23.500 --> 03:03:25.860]  So they die because of the side effects.
[03:03:25.860 --> 03:03:28.700]  The other half die because of errors.
[03:03:28.700 --> 03:03:35.540]  And it's often the doctors that make the errors because any drug may come with 20, 30 or 40
[03:03:35.540 --> 03:03:39.060]  warnings, contraindications, precautions, and so on.
[03:03:39.060 --> 03:03:43.100]  No doctor in the world knows about all this.
[03:03:43.100 --> 03:03:48.660]  So they give patients drugs that they should not have given them that interact dangerously
[03:03:48.660 --> 03:03:52.140]  with other drugs or food items or so on.
[03:03:52.140 --> 03:03:53.620]  And then the patients die.
[03:03:53.620 --> 03:03:55.540]  That's the other half.
[03:03:55.540 --> 03:04:02.820]  So the other thing I found out two years ago was that much of what the drug industry does
[03:04:02.820 --> 03:04:07.820]  fulfills the criteria for organized crime in U.S. law.
[03:04:07.820 --> 03:04:11.020]  And they behave in many ways like the mafia does.
[03:04:11.020 --> 03:04:13.700]  They corrupt everyone they can corrupt.
[03:04:13.700 --> 03:04:20.660]  They have bought every type of person, even including ministers of health in some countries.
[03:04:20.660 --> 03:04:23.940]  There is a huge amount of corruption.
[03:04:23.940 --> 03:04:30.780]  In my country, for example, Denmark, we are regarded as having very little corruption.
[03:04:30.780 --> 03:04:37.620]  But yet we have thousands of doctors on industry payroll, although we are just 20,000 doctors.
[03:04:37.620 --> 03:04:40.780]  So this is an effective kind of corruption.
[03:04:40.780 --> 03:04:46.100]  The drug industry buys the professors first, then chiefs of department, then other chief
[03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:47.460]  physicians and so on.
[03:04:47.460 --> 03:04:49.740]  They don't buy junior doctors.
[03:04:49.740 --> 03:04:54.540]  So when several thousands are on industry payroll, it's really, really bad.
[03:04:55.200 --> 03:05:03.080]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce+.
[03:05:03.080 --> 03:05:05.240]  We made it even stronger.
[03:05:05.240 --> 03:05:10.800]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere, TurboForce is back in stock
[03:05:10.800 --> 03:05:15.880]  at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:05:15.880 --> 03:05:21.920]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[03:05:21.920 --> 03:05:24.040]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:05:24.040 --> 03:05:29.480]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[03:05:29.480 --> 03:05:34.640]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[03:05:34.640 --> 03:05:35.640]  it.
[03:05:35.640 --> 03:05:39.440]  It is the super fuel.
[03:05:39.440 --> 03:05:40.880]  RainForce Plus is great.
[03:05:40.880 --> 03:05:41.880]  RainForce Alt is great.
[03:05:41.880 --> 03:05:42.880]  There are two different nootropics.
[03:05:42.880 --> 03:05:43.880]  They go good with this.
[03:05:43.880 --> 03:05:46.400]  But this is the king kong.
[03:05:46.400 --> 03:05:48.000]  This is the boss.
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:51.800]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:52.040 --> 03:05:55.040]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:15.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:15.040 --> 03:06:21.040]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Celente.
[03:06:22.040 --> 03:06:27.040]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:27.040 --> 03:06:30.960]  And again, do everything you can to support Infowars because they're doing everything
[03:06:30.960 --> 03:06:33.080]  they can to support you.
[03:06:33.080 --> 03:06:43.280]  Alex was talking about O.J. Simpson and the jerk, O. Jerk Simpson.
[03:06:43.280 --> 03:06:50.760]  This is an article back in February of 1994.
[03:06:51.900 --> 03:06:57.900]  CBS shoots Solenti for 48 hours. 48 hours used to be a big show.
[03:06:57.900 --> 03:07:01.900]  1994. There's an O.J. Simpson story to this.
[03:07:01.900 --> 03:07:09.900]  This was the beginning of the death of mainstream media.
[03:07:09.900 --> 03:07:14.900]  Week after week, month after month,
[03:07:14.900 --> 03:07:17.900]  O.J., O.J., O.J.
[03:07:18.900 --> 03:07:23.900]  O.J. Simpson on the night of June 12th, 1994.
[03:07:23.900 --> 03:07:25.900]  Remember, this is February.
[03:07:25.900 --> 03:07:30.900]  So June, July, August, September, October, November, January, February.
[03:07:30.900 --> 03:07:34.900]  February, February, March, April, May, June.
[03:07:34.900 --> 03:07:40.900]  Four months later.
[03:07:40.900 --> 03:07:42.900]  Goes on.
[03:07:42.900 --> 03:07:47.900]  Simpson's ex-wife on the night of June 12th, 1994.
[03:07:47.900 --> 03:07:49.900]  Simpson's ex-wife and Goldman.
[03:07:50.400 --> 03:07:59.119]  And Goldman, Ronald Goldman, was stabbed to death outside her condominium in Los Angeles.
[03:07:59.119 --> 03:08:03.340]  And Simpson quickly became the prime suspect.
[03:08:03.340 --> 03:08:10.680]  Rather than surrender to police after being notified of impending charges, on June 17th,
[03:08:10.680 --> 03:08:19.080]  he hid in the back of a sports utility vehicle driven by his friend, A.C. Cowlings.
[03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:25.520]  After being told that Simpson had a gun to his own head, law enforcement officers followed
[03:08:25.520 --> 03:08:28.760]  the vehicle at low speed for more than an hour.
[03:08:28.760 --> 03:08:36.840]  The attempted escape was televised live nationally, seen by 95 million viewers, and hundreds of
[03:08:36.840 --> 03:08:40.960]  Simpson's fans lined the streets to support him.
[03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:48.000]  Simpson was formally arraigned on July 22, 1994.
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:57.000]  The criminal trial was acquitted in 1995 of a murder of his ex-wife.
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:06.000]  I'm mentioning this because that's all the media talked about was O.J. Simpson
[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:11.000]  and was he responsible for killing his wife's boyfriend.
[03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:20.800]  These are the little clowns. Arrogant, arrogant. Hey, I can play football, Celente. What's the
[03:09:20.800 --> 03:09:27.760]  matter with you? If I was around today, I'd get $100 million to catch a ball. But we don't
[03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:35.400]  want any facts. We'll just listen to the crap heads. Hey, how about Crosby, Steele, Nash
[03:09:35.400 --> 03:09:43.160]  and Young? Get that Vax. Get that jab. We know crap. We're little cowards. We'll tell
[03:09:43.160 --> 03:09:51.160]  you what to do. Hey, how about that arrogant Kimmel boy? Listen to a comedian. Grow the
[03:09:51.160 --> 03:10:03.320]  hell up. Listen to that little clown boy called Bear. Listen to the clowns. Be a good American.
[03:10:03.320 --> 03:10:06.440]  Bend over and take it up to you know what.
[03:10:07.300 --> 03:10:13.300]  Who the hell cares what O.J. Simpson says?
[03:10:13.300 --> 03:10:18.300]  Not O.J., how about F.U. Simpson?
[03:10:19.100 --> 03:10:30.500]  Once upon a time, there used to be a thing in America called freedom.
[03:10:30.500 --> 03:10:33.860]  I remember this song when I was a young guy.
[03:10:33.860 --> 03:10:36.340]  Don't tell me what to say.
[03:10:36.340 --> 03:10:38.020]  Don't tell me what to do.
[03:10:38.020 --> 03:10:41.020]  I'm free and I love to be free.
[03:10:41.020 --> 03:10:42.020]  Free?
[03:10:42.020 --> 03:10:45.100]  Who the hell are you to be free?
[03:10:45.100 --> 03:10:47.380]  I'm Gavin Newsom.
[03:10:47.380 --> 03:10:51.140]  I'm some arrogant slimeball.
[03:10:51.140 --> 03:10:54.120]  My daddy was a lawyer for Geddes.
[03:10:54.120 --> 03:11:00.180]  My daddy was a lawyer for Geddes, the biggest oil magnates in the world.
[03:11:00.180 --> 03:11:03.340]  Close down your business.
[03:11:03.340 --> 03:11:05.700]  Stand six feet apart.
[03:11:05.900 --> 03:11:09.900]  Put on your mask!
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:19.920]  And before you masturbate, don't forget to clean your hands, because I'm a Masturbator!
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:32.400]  Freedom? Look at the clown show we got in front of our eyes. Hey, check out the main
[03:11:32.400 --> 03:11:40.440]  show, CNN got rid of that guy, whoever he licked, the head of CNN, and they're gonna
[03:11:40.440 --> 03:11:46.040]  find another clown. Remember that guy Zucker? Remember that guy Zucker? I think they spelt
[03:11:46.040 --> 03:11:53.960]  it wrong, it's not Z-U-C-K, you gotta put another letter in front of it, A-B-C-D-E,
[03:11:53.960 --> 03:12:02.200]  yeah, that letter. In your Trends Journal, we wrote an article about how that arrogant
[03:12:02.200 --> 03:12:10.840]  Zucker told the staff, stay on this COVID, stay on the COVID, it's bringing in, it's
[03:12:10.840 --> 03:12:15.920]  bringing in a lot of viewers, their viewers are going down in a turlet, where they are
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:23.960]  back now. They only get views by selling fear and hysteria. So what's the big CNN story
[03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:30.600]  today? Go to the site, see what they have.
[03:12:31.700 --> 03:12:33.700]  Some stupid stuff.
[03:12:34.700 --> 03:12:36.700]  That is woman.
[03:12:37.900 --> 03:12:45.900]  Charged with husband's murder, tried to change life insurance policy.
[03:12:45.900 --> 03:12:50.900]  Wait, who the hell are you talking to? What am I, six years old? I got to know that?
[03:12:50.900 --> 03:13:00.900]  And what's that other one down there with that woman that, oh, they're mad because the people that take up two seats got to pay for two seats in airplanes?
[03:13:01.100 --> 03:13:07.540]  That's news?
[03:13:07.200 --> 03:13:16.760]  We're giving you news, InfoWars gives you news, the Trends Journal, only magazine in the world
[03:13:16.760 --> 03:13:22.160]  that gives you trends analysis and trend forecasts of socioeconomic and geopolitical events.
[03:13:22.160 --> 03:13:23.160]  Nobody else does it.
[03:13:23.160 --> 03:13:24.160]  You know why?
[03:13:24.160 --> 03:13:25.160]  They don't know how.
[03:13:25.160 --> 03:13:27.080]  You're too damn arrogantly stupid.
[03:13:27.080 --> 03:13:33.360]  Hey, every new year, every new year, this is the new year in the Cartoon News Network,
[03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:35.840]  New York Slime, all the rest.
[03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:38.960]  This is what happened in 2022.
[03:13:38.960 --> 03:13:43.840]  Hey, Gatson, what's going to happen next year?
[03:13:43.840 --> 03:13:46.960]  Shut the hell up, Salenti.
[03:13:46.960 --> 03:13:48.520]  We don't know what's going to go on.
[03:13:48.520 --> 03:13:50.320]  We don't have a clue.
[03:13:50.320 --> 03:13:53.040]  We're nothing more than prostitutes.
[03:13:53.040 --> 03:13:57.800]  We're media whores that get paid to put out by our corporate pimps and our government
[03:13:57.800 --> 03:13:59.160]  whoremasters.
[03:13:59.160 --> 03:14:01.980]  We do exactly what we're told to do.
[03:14:01.980 --> 03:14:04.480]  We say what we're told to say.
[03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:08.640]  Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda.
[03:14:08.640 --> 03:14:09.640]  Yeah.
[03:14:09.640 --> 03:14:14.600]  Oh, go back to Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting.
[03:14:14.600 --> 03:14:18.720]  Look at the real numbers of people they had on the mainstream media that said it was a
[03:14:18.720 --> 03:14:19.720]  lie.
[03:14:19.720 --> 03:14:22.040]  Oh, about zero to nothing percent.
[03:14:22.040 --> 03:14:26.600]  Oh, remember they fired that guy Phil Donahue because he was against it.
[03:14:27.800 --> 03:14:36.400]  That's what's going on, that's what's going on. It's a freak show and the
[03:14:36.400 --> 03:14:45.240]  freaks are in charge. It's right in front of our eyes again that that article they
[03:14:45.240 --> 03:14:50.800]  had in there about that they have this woman that's you know the Ringling
[03:14:50.800 --> 03:14:56.480]  Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus went out of business they're trying to
[03:14:56.480 --> 03:14:59.519]  come back when I was a kid that the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey
[03:14:59.519 --> 03:15:06.039]  Circus. Step right up, step right up. See the fat man, see the fat man, see the
[03:15:06.039 --> 03:15:11.759]  tattooed lady, see the tattooed lady. You don't got to go to the circus anymore.
[03:15:11.759 --> 03:15:17.759]  It's all over the place. Obesity changes the brain with no
[03:15:17.759 --> 03:15:24.960]  signs of reversibility, expert says. Oh yeah, obesity may damage the brain's
[03:15:24.960 --> 03:15:30.560]  ability to recognize the sensation of fullness and to be satisfied after
[03:15:30.560 --> 03:15:38.160]  eating fats and sugars. A new study found. No kidding, blow me away. How could
[03:15:38.160 --> 03:15:42.359]  you be happy looking like that? First book I worked on was natural healing
[03:15:42.359 --> 03:15:48.320]  back in the 1980s. Infowars are giving you those products that you need so
[03:15:48.320 --> 03:15:51.720]  you're not like that and you could rise to a higher level and we'll be right
[03:15:51.720 --> 03:15:55.320]  back so stay tuned.
[03:16:22.039 --> 03:16:26.920]  way to dispose of it. Lucky for them one of their major stockholders was also the
[03:16:26.920 --> 03:16:30.400]  Secretary of the Treasury who was responsible for the Public Health
[03:16:30.400 --> 03:16:35.960]  Service at the time and by 1950 the US government began buying this toxic
[03:16:35.960 --> 03:16:40.400]  untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:16:40.400 --> 03:16:46.240]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease. With
[03:16:46.240 --> 03:16:51.000]  the Alexa Pure Pro you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:58.160]  madness. Available now at infowarsstore.com. You wanted to plug RainForce, do you like RainForce?
[03:16:58.160 --> 03:17:03.560]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckenladly. How do I write all the books that I do? Four
[03:17:03.560 --> 03:17:07.439]  books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers and
[03:17:07.439 --> 03:17:13.199]  now two books with Alex Jones? That's because I use RainForce every day. What I
[03:17:13.199 --> 03:17:17.920]  always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning and so you know I
[03:17:17.920 --> 03:17:22.480]  try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins but the one thing that I have
[03:17:22.480 --> 03:17:27.960]  really found that makes a difference is RainForce. I'll take RainForce in the
[03:17:27.960 --> 03:17:32.039]  morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or
[03:17:32.039 --> 03:17:37.039]  five hours writing a whole lot of stuff so it really is true that RainForce is
[03:17:37.039 --> 03:17:41.039]  something I use every day and it helps me with my writing. All right we love you
[03:17:41.039 --> 03:17:45.080]  we'll be right back. Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra and TurboForce at

[03:18:20.279 --> 03:18:25.000]  Should be called 10-hour energy. It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a
[03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:29.880]  bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and
[03:18:29.880 --> 03:18:36.800]  are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it. It is the super fuel.
[03:18:36.800 --> 03:18:40.240]  RainForce Plus is great, RainForce Ultra is great. They're two different
[03:18:40.240 --> 03:18:45.519]  hydrotropics. They go good with this but this is the King Kong. This is the boss.

[03:18:52.080 --> 03:18:59.439]  more energy. Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the
[03:18:59.439 --> 03:19:04.080]  World, is a historic book that documents the global, in their own words, plan for
[03:19:04.080 --> 03:19:08.199]  our future. That is a hellish future. Now you'll be always, while they still allow
[03:19:08.199 --> 03:19:11.279]  books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of
[03:19:11.279 --> 03:19:15.160]  The Great Reset and War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:19:15.160 --> 03:19:19.080]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after
[03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:22.800]  the signed copies we got run out. And there's about a thousand left of them
[03:19:22.800 --> 03:19:27.279]  right now. So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed
[03:19:27.279 --> 03:19:31.480]  copy, at InfoWarsTore.com. And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser
[03:19:31.480 --> 03:19:35.519]  to keep us on the air. So you won't just have this historic memento and this
[03:19:35.519 --> 03:19:39.279]  powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air. I want to
[03:19:39.279 --> 03:19:42.359]  thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned
[03:19:42.359 --> 03:19:47.160]  copies. But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsTore.com
[03:19:47.160 --> 03:19:50.720]  and get a signed copy, and buy a couple of unsigned copies, and donate to the
[03:19:50.720 --> 03:19:55.119]  library, or give them to the local school. This is an InfoWar, I'm counting on you,
[03:19:55.119 --> 03:19:57.400]  and thank you for your support.
[03:19:57.400 --> 03:20:05.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.600 --> 03:20:25.600]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:20:25.600 --> 03:20:36.440]  The 1890 Alex Jones Show, and as I keep saying, and will keep repeating, do all you can, put
[03:20:36.440 --> 03:20:43.200]  your money where your heart is, and where your brain is, because, you know, people ask
[03:20:43.200 --> 03:20:44.200]  me, what could I do?
[03:20:44.200 --> 03:20:47.240]  Well, I say, the first thing you have to do is you've got to get in the best shape you
[03:20:47.240 --> 03:20:54.200]  can, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[03:20:54.200 --> 03:20:59.000]  InfoWars provides a lot of those physical products, so check them out, and do what you
[03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:00.000]  can.
[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:04.320]  And they give you information, you know, that you're not getting in many other places, hardly
[03:21:04.320 --> 03:21:05.320]  anywhere.
[03:21:05.320 --> 03:21:08.040]  You know, we give you, what we give you in the Trends Journal, of course, is different
[03:21:08.040 --> 03:21:12.000]  than what they're giving you, because we do the trends analysis and trend forecast, but
[03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:17.640]  as far as broad range of information that you could use, you're getting it from InfoWars.
[03:21:17.640 --> 03:21:23.880]  So, you know, one of the articles up there on InfoWars today, and one of the big things
[03:21:23.880 --> 03:21:30.440]  they're covering is about, you know, this new world disorder, and the possibility of
[03:21:30.440 --> 03:21:31.760]  a nuclear attack.
[03:21:31.760 --> 03:21:42.760]  Here it is, yep, emergency broadcast, it's right there, desperate deep state moves to
[03:21:42.760 --> 03:21:48.040]  arrest opponents, yep, kidnap American children, and launch nuclear war.
[03:21:49.300 --> 03:21:54.300]  And they're not only saying that, we've been writing about it, talking about it,
[03:21:54.300 --> 03:22:00.300]  and they're right on trend, because this is from the toilet paper record, the New
[03:22:00.300 --> 03:22:13.800]  York Times, on June 10th, two days ago. You see, by the way, that's what I do, these
[03:22:13.800 --> 03:22:17.300]  go to the writers of the Trends Journal, I underline the salient points of the
[03:22:17.300 --> 03:22:24.300]  stories, and make notes. There's one note I have right here. Nuclear.
[03:22:26.500 --> 03:22:30.500]  While U.S. officials
[03:22:29.900 --> 03:22:39.660]  Officials. How about official pieces of crap? What's this official garbage? Some little
[03:22:39.660 --> 03:22:49.140]  bureaucrat? Hey, remember all those health directors? Remember Rachel? Lola, L-O-L-A,
[03:22:49.140 --> 03:22:58.260]  Lola. Oh, yeah, the clown boy-girl that plays our health minister? No, not Rachel Maddow.
[03:22:58.260 --> 03:23:08.220]  The other one, the Rachel whoever, you know? Rachel, what's that clown name? That's the head.
[03:23:08.220 --> 03:23:13.740]  Anyway, these jerks telling us what to do to fight the COVID war. Nobody says to get healthy,
[03:23:13.740 --> 03:23:21.500]  only get the jab. Anyway, and while U.S. officials, Rachel Levin, that's it. And while U.S. officials
[03:23:21.500 --> 03:23:28.180]  have said the risk of Mr. Putin using a nuclear weapon have receded, American intelligence
[03:23:28.180 --> 03:23:35.859]  agencies say total defeat in Ukraine or loss of Crimea are two scenarios under which Mr.
[03:23:35.859 --> 03:23:42.859]  Putin could potentially order the use of a nuclear weapon. All right? They're talking nuke.
[03:23:42.859 --> 03:23:49.140]  So there's either going to be a false flag or something will happen. Or the blow up of that
[03:23:49.140 --> 03:23:54.779]  nuclear power plant where they just cut the water off to it. They blew up the dam. Oh,
[03:23:54.779 --> 03:23:58.740]  no, the Russians blew up their own dam. Yeah, we'll get to that later. Damn news.
[03:24:00.200 --> 03:24:09.200]  This is the stupidity, the ignorance, who can't understand why they just fired 10% of their staff.
[03:24:09.200 --> 03:24:14.200]  Business Insider. This is a top story in Yahoo.
[03:24:14.200 --> 03:24:21.200]  Today, if a nuclear weapon is about to explode, here are 17 things to do.
[03:24:21.200 --> 03:24:23.200]  I'm not making this up.
[03:24:23.200 --> 03:24:26.200]  How about bend over and kiss your butt goodbye?
[03:24:26.200 --> 03:24:28.200]  Oh no, no no.
[03:24:28.800 --> 03:24:31.800]  Nope.
[03:24:32.300 --> 03:24:41.300]  A bright flash caused by a huge fireball, which can cause temporary blindness.
[03:24:41.300 --> 03:24:43.300]  Oh yeah?
[03:24:43.300 --> 03:24:45.300]  17 tips.
[03:24:45.300 --> 03:24:47.300]  How to prepare.
[03:24:47.300 --> 03:24:49.300]  Yep.
[03:24:49.300 --> 03:24:53.300]  Yep.
[03:24:53.300 --> 03:24:57.300]  One stupid thing after another.
[03:24:58.300 --> 03:25:02.300]  One dumbbell statement after another.
[03:25:02.300 --> 03:25:05.300]  And they quote the CDC.
[03:25:05.300 --> 03:25:09.300]  Oh yeah, what the CDC says, I would do exactly what they say.
[03:25:09.600 --> 03:25:18.600]  If there is a nuclear war, it is the end of life on earth.
[03:25:18.700 --> 03:25:33.900]  There are ways to enhance your chance of survival if a nuclear bomb were to hit your town.
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:53.000]  Once upon a time, back in 1963, June, there was a person by the name of John F. Kennedy and he was President of the United States.
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:26:01.000]  And he gave a talk, graduation of the students at American University.
[03:26:01.500 --> 03:26:05.500]  It's all about peace.
[03:26:05.500 --> 03:26:11.500]  And, to paraphrase what Kennedy said,
[03:26:11.500 --> 03:26:18.500]  if there is a nuclear exchange between the United States and Russia,
[03:26:18.100 --> 03:26:23.100]  the world will be destroyed in 24 hours.
[03:26:23.800 --> 03:26:29.800]  Generations will be destroyed.
[03:26:29.500 --> 03:26:40.180]  And I got these little clowns telling me what to do.
[03:26:40.180 --> 03:26:41.180]  Business inside.
[03:26:41.180 --> 03:26:44.540]  How about business down the crapper cider?
[03:26:45.600 --> 03:26:47.600]  What to do for nuclear?
[03:26:47.600 --> 03:26:52.600]  Oh, don't forget to stand in the middle of the room and wash your clothes.
[03:26:52.600 --> 03:26:53.600]  Yeah.
[03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:59.000]  One dumb thing after another.
[03:27:00.200 --> 03:27:08.200]  When I was a kid in school, during the Cold War, it's going on now what, 75 years?
[03:27:08.200 --> 03:27:12.200]  He had us hiding under a desk in case an atom bomb went off.
[03:27:12.200 --> 03:27:14.200]  Like that's going to make a difference.
[03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:24.000]  They're telling you in this stupidity, if you see a nuclear flash, to lay down and put your hands underneath you.
[03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:27.000]  So you don't burn your hands.
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:30.000]  These are coming from the officials.
[03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:33.000]  The official pieces of crap.
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:41.000]  The bureaucrats are the most arrogant, ignorant slime balls running the show.
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:47.000]  Because they suck into the political system, because they can't get a job in the real world.
[03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:53.000]  And they get into the political system, and they become the most arrogant.
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:57.000]  I'll tell you what to do. I'll tell you what to do.
[03:27:57.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  You pay me to tell you what to do.
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:03.000]  Public servant? F you.
[03:28:03.500 --> 03:28:10.500]  Anyway, we come back a little bit more than the Ukraine war, we're going to talk about
[03:28:10.500 --> 03:28:16.380]  the economy because Wednesday is a big day. And Thursday is a big day over there in the
[03:28:16.380 --> 03:28:21.820]  EU. Because it's going to be interest rate day, where interest rates going, what's it
[03:28:21.820 --> 03:28:27.460]  going to mean? How's it going to affect the economy? How's it going to affect your life?
[03:28:27.460 --> 03:28:35.860]  Don't worry about it. Let's see what yelling yells out. We'll puke face power. Let a clown
[03:28:35.860 --> 03:28:45.300]  a clown show. The bank's the bandits. Wednesday's the big day. It's gonna make a big difference
[03:28:45.300 --> 03:28:52.460]  in the equity markets and gold and the real estate market. We'll be right back. Stay tuned.
[03:28:52.460 --> 03:29:01.140]  InfoWars. You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[03:29:01.140 --> 03:29:06.500]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com. They are
[03:29:06.500 --> 03:29:11.980]  both clones of national best selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement
[03:29:11.980 --> 03:29:16.300]  maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a
[03:29:16.300 --> 03:29:22.980]  lower price you'll find in stores. It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew. Both of
[03:29:22.980 --> 03:29:29.300]  these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your nerves
[03:29:29.300 --> 03:29:34.660]  healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive
[03:29:34.660 --> 03:29:40.060]  to pain. There's major research behind this all. You need to get Joint Relief Max from
[03:29:40.060 --> 03:29:48.180]  InfoWarsMD and Nerve Renew from InfoWarsMD exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:29:48.180 --> 03:29:53.420]  Introducing them both, 25% off. You'll find them exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com and
[03:29:53.420 --> 03:30:01.340]  they fund our operation. I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't
[03:30:01.340 --> 03:30:07.220]  think anybody can deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When
[03:30:07.220 --> 03:30:12.500]  we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:30:12.500 --> 03:30:17.980]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[03:30:17.980 --> 03:30:23.140]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really
[03:30:23.140 --> 03:30:27.900]  just incredible. So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:30:27.900 --> 03:30:32.900]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not
[03:30:32.900 --> 03:30:36.820]  support us. I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us and that's wonderful. Keep
[03:30:36.820 --> 03:30:41.740]  doing it. But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never
[03:30:41.740 --> 03:30:45.340]  buy great products that enrich and empower your life all at the same time, keep us on
[03:30:45.340 --> 03:30:49.940]  air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:30:49.940 --> 03:30:54.660]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems
[03:30:54.660 --> 03:30:57.220]  will be over. Please take action now.
[03:30:57.220 --> 03:31:02.100]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire
[03:31:02.100 --> 03:31:07.820]  food supply. Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace
[03:31:07.820 --> 03:31:13.020]  element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population. And there are
[03:31:13.020 --> 03:31:18.980]  two things we need to do about it. We need to practice more regenerative farming. There
[03:31:18.980 --> 03:31:24.580]  are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the
[03:31:24.580 --> 03:31:30.980]  soil rich with iodine. And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine
[03:31:30.980 --> 03:31:36.900]  every day. Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's
[03:31:36.900 --> 03:31:45.780]  surface, our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best. Pure nascent iodine,
[03:31:45.780 --> 03:31:53.020]  stabilized in an activated triiodine form. For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism,
[03:31:53.020 --> 03:31:56.260]  get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:56.260 --> 03:32:01.460]  A lot of people have asked me, why is InfoWars Store and InfoWars Life not at a probiotic
[03:32:01.460 --> 03:32:05.540]  for more than three years? And the answer is simple. We only bring you the highest quality
[03:32:05.540 --> 03:32:10.540]  to lowest prices. We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven
[03:32:10.540 --> 03:32:14.940]  years. They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you,
[03:32:14.940 --> 03:32:21.260]  Mr. Jones, anymore. Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that
[03:32:21.260 --> 03:32:26.660]  loves our show. We're able to private label it under InfoWars MD as our probiotic formula.
[03:32:26.660 --> 03:32:32.460]  So you can get a super high quality probiotic for amazing gut health and more at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:32:32.460 --> 03:32:36.020]  for 25% off right now. Now wherever you get your probiotics, it's something everybody
[03:32:36.020 --> 03:32:38.980]  should be doing. But I'm asking you to try our probiotic. I think you're going to have
[03:32:38.980 --> 03:32:44.340]  an amazing effect and it funds our entire operation. So get your InfoWars MD probiotic
[03:32:44.340 --> 03:32:49.100]  today at InfoWarsStore.com. It's a high quality formula and it keeps us on the air. Take action
[03:32:49.100 --> 03:32:50.860]  now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:51.260 --> 03:32:55.260]  ♪♪♪
[03:32:56.000 --> 03:33:03.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.400 --> 03:33:34.400]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:33:35.400 --> 03:33:39.400]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:39.400 --> 03:33:45.400]  I'd like to cover that Trends Journal says, you know, debt ceiling, just another tower of babble.
[03:33:45.400 --> 03:33:48.400]  That's all it is. I mean, it's a joke.
[03:33:48.400 --> 03:33:50.400]  We'll get into that in a bit.
[03:33:50.400 --> 03:33:53.400]  But again, like I keep saying, you know, they're censoring everybody.
[03:33:53.400 --> 03:34:02.400]  You just saw that thing that came out with the FBI censoring people on Twitter because they didn't buy the baloney of the Ukraine war.
[03:34:02.400 --> 03:34:06.400]  And again, anybody that supports the Ukraine war, fine.
[03:34:06.400 --> 03:34:16.400]  Go over there like little Lindsey Graham, the fat little slob that couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag that keeps calling for more and more war.
[03:34:16.400 --> 03:34:30.400]  And little Chuckie Shuma and Diane not so Feinstein and beer barrel Bernie Sanders and AOC that voted to all steal our money to give to Ukraine.
[03:34:30.400 --> 03:34:36.400]  Go over there and go fight and you send your money.
[03:34:36.400 --> 03:34:41.400]  Don't take mine or else shut your mouth.
[03:34:41.400 --> 03:34:43.400]  So getting censored.
[03:34:43.400 --> 03:34:48.400]  And all over again, I just showed you articles.
[03:34:48.400 --> 03:34:52.400]  I used to be on 48 hours on Oprah twice selling books.
[03:34:52.400 --> 03:34:54.400]  Trends 2000. Nope.
[03:34:54.400 --> 03:34:56.400]  We don't want you on Salenti.
[03:34:56.400 --> 03:34:58.400]  You're not a prostitute.
[03:34:58.400 --> 03:35:00.400]  You're not a whore.
[03:35:00.400 --> 03:35:07.400]  So what Infowars is giving you is the news and information that once upon a time was part of the media.
[03:35:07.400 --> 03:35:13.400]  And I'm telling you that 48 hours I spoke with the woman right after they filmed me.
[03:35:13.400 --> 03:35:18.400]  I said, what's going on with all of this damn coverage about OJ Simpson?
[03:35:18.400 --> 03:35:21.400]  I said, this is destroying the media.
[03:35:21.400 --> 03:35:24.400]  And she said, yeah, I agree.
[03:35:24.400 --> 03:35:26.400]  So.
[03:35:26.400 --> 03:35:35.400]  Not only are you getting great information from Infowars, you're getting great products and they got this big sale going on now and they need your help to keep going.
[03:35:36.400 --> 03:35:39.400]  And you could use their products to keep you going.
[03:35:39.400 --> 03:35:46.400]  So you get 50 percent off their top selling products and only at Infowars store.
[03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:48.400]  And we get it.
[03:35:48.400 --> 03:35:55.400]  Some of their best selling items, some of them up to 50 percent of others, 25 percent off.
[03:35:55.400 --> 03:36:05.400]  You got BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra, Supercharged Combo, BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra, 50 percent off.
[03:36:05.400 --> 03:36:12.400]  Super Female Vitality, 40 percent off for one, 50 percent off when you purchase more than one.
[03:36:12.400 --> 03:36:16.400]  And one of my favorites.
[03:36:16.400 --> 03:36:19.400]  Super Male Vitality.
[03:36:19.400 --> 03:36:22.400]  Super Male Vitality.
[03:36:22.400 --> 03:36:24.400]  And boy.
[03:36:24.400 --> 03:36:27.400]  You know, it's keeps you going.
[03:36:27.400 --> 03:36:32.400]  You're looking around, man, you need some vitality to get it, you know.
[03:36:32.400 --> 03:36:34.400]  Man, what a what a freak show it is out there.
[03:36:34.400 --> 03:36:37.400]  I love seeing the way women dress now.
[03:36:37.400 --> 03:36:40.400]  So elegantly in their overalls.
[03:36:40.400 --> 03:36:41.400]  It's dungarees.
[03:36:41.400 --> 03:36:43.400]  No, they're blue jeans.
[03:36:43.400 --> 03:36:46.400]  Style's gone anyway.
[03:36:46.400 --> 03:36:52.400]  And he got the vitamin D3 gummies and here's my Super Male Vitality.
[03:36:52.400 --> 03:36:54.400]  Got to get that juice going.
[03:36:54.400 --> 03:36:56.400]  Yeah, this helps it.
[03:36:56.400 --> 03:36:57.400]  And what else they got?
[03:36:57.400 --> 03:37:05.400]  Probiotic Formula, Prostate Support, Nerve Renew, Joint Max Relief, Good Night's Sleep.
[03:37:05.400 --> 03:37:10.400]  And remember, you buy from Infowars, you win, they win.
[03:37:10.400 --> 03:37:12.400]  It's a 360 win.
[03:37:12.400 --> 03:37:22.400]  You get super high quality items and you help launch the Infowars to the next level.
[03:37:22.400 --> 03:37:24.400]  And that's where we have to go.
[03:37:24.400 --> 03:37:29.400]  The next level because all the cats my age, man.
[03:37:29.400 --> 03:37:31.400]  We all say it.
[03:37:31.400 --> 03:37:32.400]  We all say it.
[03:37:32.400 --> 03:37:35.400]  Glad I'm older, man.
[03:37:35.400 --> 03:37:38.400]  Wouldn't want to raise a kid in this life.
[03:37:38.400 --> 03:37:44.400]  When I was a young guy, you look at the polls not making us up.
[03:37:44.400 --> 03:37:46.400]  Remember, this is after World War II.
[03:37:46.400 --> 03:37:48.400]  America's at its height.
[03:37:48.400 --> 03:37:50.400]  It's at its height.
[03:37:50.400 --> 03:37:54.400]  The polls used to show the future would be better than the past.
[03:37:54.400 --> 03:37:59.400]  Things are growing and everything is just so great.
[03:37:59.400 --> 03:38:01.400]  Now it's the exact opposite.
[03:38:01.400 --> 03:38:04.400]  Make America great again.
[03:38:04.400 --> 03:38:05.400]  Got to go back.
[03:38:05.400 --> 03:38:06.400]  Got to go back.
[03:38:06.400 --> 03:38:07.400]  Got to go back.
[03:38:07.400 --> 03:38:09.400]  We got to go forward.
[03:38:10.200 --> 03:38:14.200]  Because I'm tired of this freak show, man.
[03:38:14.200 --> 03:38:17.200]  It's a freak show.
[03:38:17.200 --> 03:38:19.200]  So,
[03:38:19.200 --> 03:38:24.200]  I mentioned before, I'm going to talk a little bit about the economy.
[03:38:24.200 --> 03:38:29.200]  You know, there's a road blew up, a truck blew up or something, Route 95 over there,
[03:38:29.200 --> 03:38:32.200]  in Pennsylvania, not far from here.
[03:38:32.200 --> 03:38:34.200]  It's going to take months to restore.
[03:38:34.200 --> 03:38:36.200]  Huh.
[03:38:36.200 --> 03:38:40.200]  If this was China, the thing would be fixed in a week.
[03:38:40.200 --> 03:38:42.200]  It's a joke.
[03:38:42.200 --> 03:38:44.200]  Our infrastructure's rotting,
[03:38:44.200 --> 03:38:50.200]  and slimeball Biden and all the other criminals that keep stealing our money.
[03:38:50.200 --> 03:38:51.200]  Yep.
[03:38:51.200 --> 03:38:56.200]  Biden administration announced 2.1 billion weapons package
[03:38:56.200 --> 03:38:58.200]  last week
[03:38:58.200 --> 03:39:00.200]  to Ukraine.
[03:39:00.200 --> 03:39:04.200]  Over $130 billion
[03:39:04.200 --> 03:39:06.200]  since the war began,
[03:39:06.200 --> 03:39:09.200]  earmark for Ukraine.
[03:39:09.200 --> 03:39:13.200]  February 24th, 2022.
[03:39:13.200 --> 03:39:15.200]  Since then,
[03:39:15.200 --> 03:39:17.200]  almost $130 billion
[03:39:17.200 --> 03:39:22.200]  as our infrastructure is rotting in front of us.
[03:39:22.200 --> 03:39:24.200]  Last week,
[03:39:24.200 --> 03:39:26.200]  I couldn't go outside,
[03:39:26.200 --> 03:39:28.200]  had to close all the windows
[03:39:28.200 --> 03:39:30.200]  for a couple of days.
[03:39:30.200 --> 03:39:33.200]  The smog, the smoke.
[03:39:33.200 --> 03:39:37.200]  It's only four hours, four and a half hours from the Canadian border over here.
[03:39:37.200 --> 03:39:39.200]  Spewing down here.
[03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:41.200]  That little true dope,
[03:39:41.200 --> 03:39:43.200]  that little arrogant boy,
[03:39:43.200 --> 03:39:46.200]  another daddy's boy, born on third base,
[03:39:46.200 --> 03:39:48.200]  and thought he had a home run.
[03:39:48.200 --> 03:39:51.200]  The guy playing the prime minister that locked down the place,
[03:39:51.200 --> 03:39:56.200]  arrested people for not wanting to get the vax if they went over the border driving a truck,
[03:39:56.200 --> 03:39:57.200]  stole money from him.
[03:39:57.200 --> 03:39:58.200]  Yeah, that guy.
[03:39:58.200 --> 03:40:01.200]  You can't put out a fire.
[03:40:01.200 --> 03:40:04.200]  Oh, you're the clowns that say we're going to win wars.
[03:40:04.200 --> 03:40:06.200]  You can't put out a fire.
[03:40:06.200 --> 03:40:10.200]  And then you read the data, how they cut back over the years
[03:40:10.200 --> 03:40:12.200]  on fire protection.
[03:40:13.200 --> 03:40:15.200]  You can't put out a fire.
[03:40:15.200 --> 03:40:17.200]  You're going to win a war?
[03:40:17.700 --> 03:40:28.700]  Anybody that votes for war, go fight or shut your cowardly mouth. Don't want to hear it.
[03:40:28.700 --> 03:40:41.500]  Every clown, every clown politician that votes to steal our money, to give it to another
[03:40:41.500 --> 03:40:52.540]  country to go fight a war, you go there and fight or shut your political crap mouth.
[03:40:52.540 --> 03:40:55.740]  You're a bunch of arrogant cowards.
[03:40:56.800 --> 03:41:01.800]  It's simple. It's simple.
[03:41:01.800 --> 03:41:06.800]  Anybody that votes for war, go fight or shut your mouth.
[03:41:07.900 --> 03:41:10.900]  What a clown show!
[03:41:11.900 --> 03:41:14.900]  What a freak show!
[03:41:15.700 --> 03:41:20.700]  The freaks are in charge in a country near you!
[03:41:20.900 --> 03:41:27.900]  Little cazón Macron with his fake hat, little Rothschild's boy.
[03:41:29.100 --> 03:41:34.100]  The guy that's the president of Ukraine used to play a comedian.
[03:41:34.100 --> 03:41:41.100]  You can't make this stuff up in a sitcom on TV and play the piano with his penis.
[03:41:41.100 --> 03:41:43.100]  But believe everything he says.
[03:41:43.100 --> 03:41:46.100]  When Zelensky speaks, it's the truth.
[03:41:46.100 --> 03:41:48.100]  Da-da-da-da-da-da.
[03:41:48.100 --> 03:41:51.100]  Be-de-be-be-be-be. Be-be-be-be-be-be.
[03:41:51.100 --> 03:41:53.100]  Now play the piano.
[03:41:53.500 --> 03:42:02.500]  Let's sue that clown over there in the UK after the clown before him, Boris Johnson.
[03:42:02.500 --> 03:42:05.500]  Oh, Boris Karloff.
[03:42:05.500 --> 03:42:09.500]  Look at the clown show.
[03:42:09.500 --> 03:42:11.500]  Calm down, Sudhante.
[03:42:11.500 --> 03:42:14.500]  Be a good American.
[03:42:14.500 --> 03:42:16.500]  Listen to the mainstream news.
[03:42:16.500 --> 03:42:20.500]  Forty-five percent of the American people, almost forty-five percent, get their information
[03:42:20.500 --> 03:42:22.500]  from the mainstream news.
[03:42:22.500 --> 03:42:24.500]  Mainstream crap.
[03:42:24.500 --> 03:42:26.500]  And that's why I support InfoWars.
[03:42:26.500 --> 03:42:30.500]  So going back to the economy, Wednesday's a big day.
[03:42:30.500 --> 03:42:37.500]  If they raise interest rates, poof, this economy's going down, and so is gold prices.
[03:42:37.500 --> 03:42:42.500]  If they keep them stagnant, markets are going to go up, and so too will gold.
[03:42:42.500 --> 03:42:44.500]  That's our forecast.
[03:42:44.500 --> 03:42:46.500]  When we come back, we're going to tell you why.
[03:42:46.500 --> 03:42:51.500]  And by the time we come back, you'll be buying products on InfoWars.
[03:42:51.500 --> 03:42:53.500]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:21.500 --> 03:43:22.500]  Coffee.
[03:43:22.500 --> 03:43:23.500]  Another person likes that coffee.
[03:43:23.500 --> 03:43:24.500]  That's how our bodies work.
[03:43:24.500 --> 03:43:25.500]  They're all very diverse.
[03:43:25.500 --> 03:43:30.500]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years
[03:43:30.500 --> 03:43:36.500]  that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWars MD Good Night Sleep.

[03:43:52.500 --> 03:44:01.500]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson
[03:44:01.500 --> 03:44:02.500]  and take him off the air.
[03:44:02.500 --> 03:44:03.500]  People said, no way.
[03:44:03.500 --> 03:44:04.500]  He's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[03:44:04.500 --> 03:44:06.500]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[03:44:06.500 --> 03:44:09.500]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[03:44:09.500 --> 03:44:12.500]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[03:44:12.500 --> 03:44:14.500]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[03:44:14.500 --> 03:44:20.500]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[03:44:20.500 --> 03:44:23.500]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:44:23.500 --> 03:44:26.500]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:44:26.500 --> 03:44:31.500]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[03:44:31.500 --> 03:44:34.500]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[03:44:34.500 --> 03:44:37.500]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[03:44:37.500 --> 03:44:40.500]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[03:44:40.500 --> 03:44:42.500]  We're barely hanging on.
[03:44:42.500 --> 03:44:46.500]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products

[03:44:55.500 --> 03:45:02.500]  A lot of people have asked me, why is InfoWars Store and InfoWars Life not at a probiotic for more than three years?
[03:45:02.500 --> 03:45:03.500]  The answer is simple.
[03:45:03.500 --> 03:45:06.500]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[03:45:06.500 --> 03:45:10.500]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[03:45:10.500 --> 03:45:16.500]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[03:45:16.500 --> 03:45:22.500]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[03:45:22.500 --> 03:45:26.500]  We're able to private label it under InfoWars MD as our probiotic formula.

[03:45:55.500 --> 03:46:02.500]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[03:46:02.500 --> 03:46:07.500]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[03:46:07.500 --> 03:46:11.500]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:46:11.500 --> 03:46:14.500]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:46:14.500 --> 03:46:17.500]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:46:17.500 --> 03:46:26.500]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:46:26.500 --> 03:46:30.500]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day,
[03:46:30.500 --> 03:46:36.500]  derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface.
[03:46:36.500 --> 03:46:42.500]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:46:42.500 --> 03:46:48.500]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[03:46:48.500 --> 03:46:55.500]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:46:57.500 --> 03:47:04.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.700 --> 03:47:20.900]  Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Celente.
[03:47:20.900 --> 03:47:24.740]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.740 --> 03:47:31.820]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show, and as I said, keep supporting InfoWars because
[03:47:31.820 --> 03:47:34.660]  InfoWars is supporting you.
[03:47:34.660 --> 03:47:46.980]  So going back to the economy, Europe is in a recession, got it, two quarters of negative
[03:47:46.980 --> 03:47:55.340]  GDP, actually they're calling it stagflation, it's not stagnant, it's down, it's dragflation.
[03:47:55.500 --> 03:48:05.740]  Economy down, inflation still high, but inflation is going down, one of the main reasons being
[03:48:05.740 --> 03:48:08.100]  energy prices.
[03:48:08.100 --> 03:48:14.020]  So you're looking at crude, Brent crude now, it's around, you know, near the $70 mark.
[03:48:14.020 --> 03:48:16.780]  I would have never thought it would have gone this low.
[03:48:16.780 --> 03:48:20.460]  The reason it's going so low is that there's a global slowdown.
[03:48:20.460 --> 03:48:29.180]  Again, Europe is in a recession, and Germany, the biggest economy in Europe, fourth largest
[03:48:29.180 --> 03:48:34.100]  economy in the world, they're in a recession, you know, I'm going to talk about, well, Europe
[03:48:34.100 --> 03:48:38.060]  is in a recession, but they're doing lousy.
[03:48:38.060 --> 03:48:44.940]  And one of the big factors that's barely reported in news is that, yeah, consumers are spending
[03:48:44.940 --> 03:48:51.540]  more, but the manufacturers are manufacturing a lot less.
[03:48:52.600 --> 03:48:57.600]  The manufacturing indexes are down across the globe,
[03:48:57.600 --> 03:49:00.600]  from China to Europe to the U.S.
[03:49:00.600 --> 03:49:03.600]  That's a big indicator.
[03:49:03.600 --> 03:49:06.600]  Yeah, people are spending money on services.
[03:49:06.600 --> 03:49:09.600]  Yeah, restaurants going on travel.
[03:49:09.600 --> 03:49:13.600]  Yeah, fine, but that's not generating manufacturing income
[03:49:13.600 --> 03:49:16.600]  is where the real story is behind it.
[03:49:16.600 --> 03:49:20.600]  And then you look at the numbers coming out of Lowe's
[03:49:20.600 --> 03:49:26.600]  at a Target, at a Foot Locker, one after another.
[03:49:26.600 --> 03:49:30.600]  Macy's, down, down, down.
[03:49:30.600 --> 03:49:34.600]  So people are buying less, spending more on services.
[03:49:35.300 --> 03:49:44.300]  So now, on Thursday, the European Central Bank is going to announce whether or not they're going to raise interest rates.
[03:49:44.300 --> 03:49:52.300]  The guests on the street for America, 70% say they're going to hold them steady.
[03:49:52.800 --> 03:50:04.039]  But that might change because they said in Australia that they would hold them steady
[03:50:04.039 --> 03:50:07.359]  and they just raised them 25 basis points.
[03:50:07.359 --> 03:50:13.920]  Up in Canada, through Dopeland, they said they were going to hold interest rates steady
[03:50:13.920 --> 03:50:17.279]  and they rose, they jacked them up another 25 basis points.
[03:50:17.300 --> 03:50:28.300]  I have to make this very clear, it takes you about a year before the effects of the high
[03:50:28.300 --> 03:50:33.740]  interest rates start hitting the economy, and that time is now.
[03:50:33.740 --> 03:50:41.619]  They didn't start raising interest rates until March of 2022.
[03:50:41.619 --> 03:50:45.220]  They lied or were too stupid to say that inflation was rising.
[03:50:45.220 --> 03:50:51.740]  They said it was temporary, then transitory, and now transgender-tory, so they were very
[03:50:51.740 --> 03:50:55.820]  late in doing it, but now you're feeling the implications.
[03:50:56.800 --> 03:51:00.800]  And then the big story, the higher interest rates,
[03:51:00.800 --> 03:51:04.800]  again, you'd cover your Trends Journal about the Tower of Babel,
[03:51:04.800 --> 03:51:07.800]  you know, the dollars, it's just a fake thing.
[03:51:07.800 --> 03:51:13.800]  The higher the interest rates go, the more you have to pay your debt,
[03:51:13.800 --> 03:51:21.800]  particularly government debt, and, and, and commercial real estate debt,
[03:51:21.800 --> 03:51:26.800]  of which in the United States there's some $20 trillion worth.
[03:51:26.800 --> 03:51:31.800]  $20 trillion worth of commercial real estate,
[03:51:31.800 --> 03:51:35.800]  and the office sector, as we have forecast,
[03:51:35.800 --> 03:51:38.800]  is going to bring down the banking sector,
[03:51:38.800 --> 03:51:47.800]  because they have floating loans and, and, and, and these interest rate type of loans.
[03:51:47.700 --> 03:51:53.700]  The S.O.'s interest rates go higher.
[03:51:54.500 --> 03:52:03.500]  As they're losing tenants, how are they going to pay off their loans?
[03:52:03.500 --> 03:52:08.500]  Again, the total commercial debt is $20 trillion.
[03:52:08.500 --> 03:52:15.500]  Your office vacancy rate means the offices are empty.
[03:52:15.500 --> 03:52:20.500]  In San Francisco, it's almost 30%.
[03:52:20.500 --> 03:52:25.500]  In Los Angeles, 30%.
[03:52:25.500 --> 03:52:29.500]  In New York City, 20%.
[03:52:29.500 --> 03:52:33.500]  They're closing down hotels in San Francisco.
[03:52:33.500 --> 03:52:39.500]  Business travel is one of the big ways the airlines make money.
[03:52:39.500 --> 03:52:47.500]  Business travel didn't come back to what it was pre-COVID war 2020, back in 2019.
[03:52:48.000 --> 03:52:52.000]  So that means people aren't staying in hotels.
[03:52:52.000 --> 03:52:57.000]  And that means all the people that aren't going back to work five days a week,
[03:52:57.000 --> 03:53:01.000]  all the businesses that depend on them are losing money.
[03:53:01.000 --> 03:53:08.000]  The delicatessens, the restaurants, the shoemakers, the dry cleaners, they're drying out.
[03:53:07.900 --> 03:53:11.900]  So this is really serious.
[03:53:13.100 --> 03:53:22.100]  So, going back to Wednesday, the guess is that 70% are saying they're going to hold interest rates where they are.
[03:53:22.100 --> 03:53:26.100]  If they hold them where they are, that's going to be bullish for gold.
[03:53:26.500 --> 03:53:32.500]  And bullish for the equity markets.
[03:53:32.500 --> 03:53:40.100]  You go back to your Trends Journal, November last year, we're data-driven.
[03:53:41.200 --> 03:53:50.240]  We said the S&P 500 is going to go up following the midterm election. Why? We
[03:53:50.240 --> 03:53:52.880]  looked at the data.
[03:53:51.200 --> 03:53:56.200]  40 midterm elections over the last 60 years.
[03:53:57.200 --> 03:54:03.200]  The S&P went up 16.3% on average.
[03:54:03.200 --> 03:54:05.200]  Guess what?
[03:54:05.200 --> 03:54:08.200]  It's getting close to that average now.
[03:54:08.700 --> 03:54:13.700]  The S&P 500 is up just about 12%.
[03:54:14.700 --> 03:54:15.700]  Yeah.
[03:54:16.400 --> 03:54:22.400]  But then there's China, and their markets are going down the toilet.
[03:54:23.800 --> 03:54:29.800]  Because China's the one that launched the COVID war, and they had their zero COVID policy.
[03:54:29.800 --> 03:54:34.800]  Tens of millions of businesses went out of business in China.
[03:54:34.800 --> 03:54:38.800]  The housing boom is over, and it's ready to bust.
[03:54:39.400 --> 03:54:48.400]  Again, look at your oil prices, look at the manufacturing index.
[03:54:48.400 --> 03:54:53.400]  China's is way down, exports are way down.
[03:54:54.200 --> 03:54:58.500]  Exports.
[03:54:59.000 --> 03:55:07.540]  So, this is serious, what's going on, but don't worry, when all else fails, they take
[03:55:07.540 --> 03:55:08.540]  you to war.
[03:55:08.540 --> 03:55:09.540]  You ready for this?
[03:55:09.540 --> 03:55:19.980]  I mean, with being able to talk about stupidity, Biden and Sunak, yes, Sunak, this arrogant
[03:55:19.980 --> 03:55:28.980]  little multi-multi-multi-millionaire, and I think his wife got the dough from his wife,
[03:55:28.980 --> 03:55:37.940]  President Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain affirmed their support for Ukraine
[03:55:37.940 --> 03:55:46.380]  on Thursday, pledging to continue drumming up financial and military aid to Kyiv as fighting
[03:55:46.380 --> 03:55:50.820]  intensifies on the Russian front.
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:56:00.000]  Sunak said, there is no point in trying to wait us out.
[03:56:01.840 --> 03:56:03.000]  And Biden said.
[03:56:04.100 --> 03:56:11.100]  Well, he said this all, we will be there as long as it takes.
[03:56:11.100 --> 03:56:13.100]  That's what Sunak said.
[03:56:13.100 --> 03:56:20.100]  And Biden said, I believe we'll have the funding necessary to support Ukraine as long as it takes.
[03:56:20.100 --> 03:56:23.100]  Adding that the vast majority.
[03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:34.000]  Of his critics in Congress would agree that funding Ukraine would be better than allowing Russia to go unchecked.
[03:56:35.100 --> 03:56:43.100]  So keep stealing the money from the plantation workers of Slavelandia as your roads are rotting in front of you.
[03:56:43.100 --> 03:56:46.100]  Everywhere I go, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:56:46.100 --> 03:56:50.100]  They can't fix a bridge over there in Pennsylvania.
[03:56:50.100 --> 03:56:56.100]  You can't put out a forest fires, all you official freaks.
[03:56:56.100 --> 03:57:03.100]  But we're going to steal your money and kill people as long as it takes.
[03:57:03.100 --> 03:57:08.100]  I'm the warmongers in charge.
[03:57:08.100 --> 03:57:13.100]  I'm a little clown boy that never fought.
[03:57:14.100 --> 03:57:18.100]  But we'll send your kids to go get killed.
[03:57:19.100 --> 03:57:23.100]  And when that nuclear bomb falls, don't worry about it.
[03:57:23.100 --> 03:57:26.100]  Just follow what the CDC says.
[03:57:26.100 --> 03:57:29.100]  Or the World Health Organization.
[03:57:29.100 --> 03:57:32.100]  Or Mickey Mouse the Donald Duck.
[03:57:32.100 --> 03:57:35.100]  Because that's who's running the show.
[03:57:35.100 --> 03:57:39.100]  So, as I say, hey politicians.
[03:57:39.100 --> 03:57:42.100]  Who do you have for you to tell us what to do?

[03:58:46.100 --> 03:58:50.100]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing
[03:58:50.100 --> 03:58:53.100]  highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[03:58:53.100 --> 03:58:56.100]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:58:56.100 --> 03:59:01.100]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[03:59:01.100 --> 03:59:04.100]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[03:59:04.100 --> 03:59:07.100]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[03:59:07.100 --> 03:59:10.100]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[03:59:10.100 --> 03:59:13.100]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:59:13.100 --> 03:59:15.100]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders
[03:59:15.100 --> 03:59:18.100]  was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[03:59:18.100 --> 03:59:21.100]  who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[03:59:21.100 --> 03:59:25.100]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic,
[03:59:25.100 --> 03:59:28.100]  untreated industrial waste product
[03:59:28.100 --> 03:59:30.100]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:59:30.100 --> 03:59:35.100]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:59:35.100 --> 03:59:39.100]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[03:59:39.100 --> 03:59:41.100]  And a remedy to this madness.
