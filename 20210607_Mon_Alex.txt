[00:00.000 --> 00:10.400]  Facebook would ordinarily say, we're a private company, we're not liable.
[00:10.400 --> 00:11.640]  Well, you know what?
[00:11.640 --> 00:16.280]  When they act at the behest of the government, when they contact Fauci, when they say, should
[00:16.280 --> 00:17.280]  we censor this?
[00:17.280 --> 00:22.200]  And Fauci says yes, and they censor it for the federal government, and then magically
[00:22.200 --> 00:25.720]  when the government changes his mind and said, oh, all those facts that were there
[00:25.720 --> 00:28.160]  a year ago, now you're allowed to talk about it.
[00:28.160 --> 00:31.440]  They stop censoring it with a flip of a switch.
[00:31.440 --> 00:37.960]  That lays a very strong argument that Facebook is operating as a state agency, and that opens
[00:37.960 --> 00:40.000]  very significant legal liability.
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.320]  Dr. Fauci's emails reveal a pattern of arrogance we have all come to expect from the minions
[00:45.320 --> 00:51.080]  of globalism, destroying Western civilization with the aid of the power mad inhabiting our
[00:51.080 --> 00:56.440]  nation's capital, except that, unlike the classified information of Hillary Clinton's
[00:56.440 --> 01:02.600]  emails or the disgusting occultic rabbit hole of the Podesta Brothers or the blatant nepotistic
[01:02.600 --> 01:08.920]  impeachable corruption on the Hunter Biden laptop, Anthony Fauci's 800 pages of emails
[01:08.920 --> 01:14.800]  will eventually tell the tale of a sociopathic treasonous fool who made fools out of all
[01:14.800 --> 01:21.040]  of us, a template Fauci had workshopped with his response during the AIDS crisis.
[01:21.040 --> 01:27.160]  Rather than sitting the international emergency out based on his previous failure, the Chinese
[01:27.160 --> 01:33.720]  century was ushered in with Fauci as its main co-conspirator in the United States, spinning
[01:33.720 --> 01:39.720]  tales of the mysterious origins of a coronavirus, knowing full well that his gain of function
[01:39.720 --> 01:47.720]  research cat had been let out of the bag just as the October 2019 event 201 had war-gamed.
[01:47.720 --> 01:52.240]  Cases are reacting in different ways as to how best to manage the overwhelming amounts
[01:52.240 --> 01:56.320]  of dis and misinformation circulating over the internet.
[01:56.320 --> 02:01.120]  In some cases, limited internet shutdowns are being implemented to quell panic.
[02:01.120 --> 02:06.360]  We could be looking at double the number of cases in one week and 16 times as many in
[02:06.360 --> 02:09.600]  a month if we are not able to stop the spread.
[02:09.600 --> 02:14.400]  That would be on the order of half a million cases and it would continue to rise exponentially.
[02:14.400 --> 02:20.160]  One wrote, the unusual features of the virus, that's the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, make up
[02:20.160 --> 02:24.680]  a really small part of the genome, just less than 0.1%.
[02:24.680 --> 02:31.480]  So one has to look really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features
[02:31.480 --> 02:33.960]  potentially look engineered.
[02:33.960 --> 02:40.720]  I know which that refers to, that's that PRRA polybasic furan, inserted cleavage site
[02:40.720 --> 02:41.720]  in there.
[02:41.720 --> 02:46.600]  It's something that makes this thing really sing as a virus and enables it to really attack
[02:46.600 --> 02:47.720]  the cells.
[02:47.720 --> 02:52.440]  So even though they say, oh, it's just less than 0.1%, that's irrelevant.
[02:52.440 --> 02:59.040]  All you would need is just those 12 nucleotides or those four amino acids to be inserted in
[02:59.040 --> 03:01.520]  and you've got an engineered virus at that point.
[03:01.520 --> 03:04.920]  And he himself had been vaguely but steadily predicting.
[03:04.920 --> 03:07.080]  There will be a surprise outbreak.
[03:07.080 --> 03:13.120]  Any normal person, much less a doctor who is the highest paid federal employee out of
[03:13.120 --> 03:19.000]  four million employees of the US government, would have left no stone unturned to get the
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.280]  American people the best medication possible to combat the Frankenvirus.
[03:24.280 --> 03:25.280]  But not Fauci.
[03:25.280 --> 03:31.960]  Email show as Breitbart reported, Dr. Anthony Fauci was advised by Eric Nielsen, a physicist
[03:31.960 --> 03:39.080]  and CEO of Biosignal Technologies in March 2020 that two drugs could possibly help battle
[03:39.080 --> 03:40.920]  the coronavirus pandemic.
[03:40.920 --> 03:45.760]  But Fauci ignored it, claiming that the email was too long for him to read.
[03:45.760 --> 03:51.120]  Nielsen said he had instructed members of his own family to get Alvesco for emergency
[03:51.120 --> 03:52.120]  use only.
[03:52.120 --> 03:56.680]  Nielsen also claimed that there was a second drug that could possibly be used, which he
[03:56.680 --> 03:58.600]  advised his family to get.
[03:58.600 --> 04:05.200]  He wrote to Fauci the drug is called hydroxychloroquine, which he said also seemed to be effective
[04:05.200 --> 04:06.200]  and safe.
[04:06.200 --> 04:12.920]  Fauci was asked about hydroxychloroquine and responded hydroxychloroquine is not effective
[04:12.920 --> 04:16.760]  in the treatment of coronavirus disease or COVID-19.
[04:16.760 --> 04:22.360]  We are just beginning to digest the massive national security risk our own government
[04:22.360 --> 04:29.840]  displayed under Fauci's guidance, as the Pentagon reportedly gave $39 million to Dr.
[04:29.840 --> 04:36.040]  Peter Dasek's EcoHealth Alliance, the charity that funded research at the Wuhan lab between
[04:36.040 --> 04:38.960]  2013 and 2020.
[04:38.960 --> 04:43.800]  Fauci's own hubris and marching orders took us all on a completely different course that
[04:43.800 --> 04:50.440]  led to an mRNA vaccine goldmine that was hastily administered in violation of the Nuremberg
[04:50.440 --> 04:51.440]  Code.
[04:51.440 --> 04:58.280]  We are now sampling and killing as yet untold numbers as we live through this present moment.
[04:58.280 --> 05:01.880]  I am blown away at how effective Info War is.
[05:01.880 --> 05:07.080]  I am humbled by how we are changing the world and it is important for you to really internalize
[05:07.080 --> 05:11.360]  the fact that you are the Info War, when you spread the word, when you financially support
[05:11.360 --> 05:15.720]  us, when you pray for us, you change history.
[05:15.720 --> 05:21.960]  You give my children and your children and our entire species a chance at the future
[05:21.960 --> 05:25.360]  instead of these evil, post-humanist, exterminist globalist winning.
[05:25.360 --> 05:28.880]  And we are giving them a run for their money right now, so that is why I want to encourage
[05:28.880 --> 05:35.360]  everyone in the month of June 2021 to spread the word about Info Wars now more than ever.
[05:35.360 --> 05:36.760]  Don't be ashamed of Info Wars.
[05:36.760 --> 05:40.840]  Be proud of the fact that we have been in so many fights and that we have been so bruised
[05:40.840 --> 05:45.400]  and so scarred because those are the signs of our victories, the signs of your victory.
[05:45.400 --> 05:48.720]  And also please financially support us by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[05:48.720 --> 05:53.120]  It's only running through next Monday, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, double-fifty
[05:53.120 --> 05:55.960]  percent off on best-selling products like DNA Force Plus.
[05:55.960 --> 06:24.520]  Check it out today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[06:24.520 --> 06:28.920]  It's Monday, June 7th of the year is 2021.
[06:28.920 --> 06:33.800]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and this is going to be an extremely revealing broadcast even
[06:33.800 --> 06:39.160]  compared to our other incredibly pertinent historic transmissions.
[06:39.160 --> 06:41.520]  It's all coming up.
[06:41.520 --> 06:46.360]  The New World Order depopulation out in the open of humanity's choice to accept it or
[06:46.360 --> 06:47.600]  stand up and reject it.
[06:47.600 --> 06:50.520]  We have entered the point of no return.
[06:50.520 --> 06:55.280]  First, a powerful report from John Bowne here on the Alex Jones Show.
[06:55.280 --> 06:57.840]  Crime has become law.
[06:57.840 --> 07:04.320]  As Western culture is turned upside down and the public is gaslit on every issue, the federal
[07:04.320 --> 07:10.200]  judge in San Diego has overturned California's three decades old ban on assault weapons.
[07:10.200 --> 07:16.480]  I just have to say that it's incredibly insulting for an activist judge to gaslight me and other
[07:16.480 --> 07:21.040]  survivors and minimize the hell that we've been through.
[07:21.040 --> 07:26.000]  The courts have ruled over and over again that the Second Amendment is not unlimited.
[07:26.000 --> 07:32.520]  Law and order transforms into crime and chaos, where the criminal has become the victim and
[07:32.520 --> 07:38.280]  the victim has become a statistic.
[07:38.280 --> 07:42.920]  Thousands of California prison inmates suddenly found their prison sentences shortened this
[07:42.920 --> 07:46.040]  weekend thanks to a change in good behavior credit.
[07:46.040 --> 07:51.800]  This change includes nearly 20,000 inmates who are serving life sentences with the possibility
[07:51.800 --> 07:52.800]  of parole.
[07:52.800 --> 07:56.840]  At the peak of the pandemic, the city released thousands of inmates from Rikers Island over
[07:56.840 --> 07:58.360]  COVID-19 fears.
[07:58.360 --> 08:03.400]  250 inmates released have been re-arrested and some more than once.
[08:03.400 --> 08:09.360]  On March 16th, Martinez was released early from Rikers because of COVID-19 concerns.
[08:09.360 --> 08:13.200]  Police say just seven days later, he leaned into a parked car in Lower Manhattan with
[08:13.200 --> 08:16.000]  a box cutter and stole the passenger's cell phone.
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.400]  He was arrested and released.
[08:18.400 --> 08:22.840]  On April 6th, Martinez was arrested and released again after allegedly stealing from the gourmet
[08:22.840 --> 08:28.800]  garage on the same block and again on June 3rd for throwing a rock through the storefront
[08:28.800 --> 08:32.760]  of this clothing and jewelry boutique called Lawn on Greenwich Avenue.
[08:32.760 --> 08:36.120]  There were some that were typically we would not want to release.
[08:36.120 --> 08:42.160]  There were people who had been involved in some assaults and assaults with deadly weapons.
[08:42.160 --> 08:47.800]  Their acidivism rate among Orange County inmates released early due to the pandemic
[08:47.800 --> 08:50.400]  is up 44 percent.
[08:50.400 --> 08:54.920]  In essence, this judge is a court-ordered crime spree that he has issued through this
[08:54.920 --> 08:58.040]  order knowing that these are very serious offenders.
[08:58.040 --> 09:04.880]  97 of the medically vulnerable are in for murder or attempted murder, 94 for child molestation
[09:04.880 --> 09:09.320]  and that's not including the rest of the population that we'd have to consider for release.
[09:09.320 --> 09:14.720]  Nina Love once again having to relive the murder of her brother, Kevin John Ruska, who
[09:14.720 --> 09:20.040]  was kidnapped and eventually died at the hands of Tariba Williams, who only served a quarter
[09:20.040 --> 09:24.040]  of her 84 years to life sentence for first degree murder.
[09:24.040 --> 09:27.880]  She should have spent the rest of her life behind bars.
[09:27.880 --> 09:32.600]  Williams walking free after she was deemed at a high medical risk for the virus.
[09:32.600 --> 09:36.880]  The Yolo County District Attorney's Office was told she suffers a heart condition.
[09:36.880 --> 09:41.960]  The bail reform, which began in California and has spread to other states including
[09:41.960 --> 09:47.960]  Illinois, Nebraska, Indiana and New York, has reduced the jail populations by at least
[09:47.960 --> 09:54.720]  40 percent by eliminating cash bail for as much as 90 percent of arrests, turning the
[09:54.720 --> 09:58.080]  streets into one gigantic holding cell.
[09:58.080 --> 10:03.440]  The blood of the children being shot by out of control gang members in our city is on
[10:03.440 --> 10:08.280]  your hands and on the hands of every person who does not make public safety a priority.
[10:08.280 --> 10:12.760]  The police commissioner is making these comments in response to what's been a year saturated
[10:12.760 --> 10:13.760]  in violence.
[10:13.760 --> 10:19.680]  On Monday alone there were nine shooting incidents on city streets and when police do make arrests
[10:19.680 --> 10:22.760]  the commissioner says there's often one common denominator.
[10:22.760 --> 10:25.880]  The suspects have been arrested several times before.
[10:25.880 --> 10:30.440]  We're arresting somebody for pushing a woman down the stairs and then we release them back
[10:30.440 --> 10:33.480]  into the streets, I mean this is craziness.
[10:33.480 --> 10:39.040]  The mockingbird media's decision to ignore stories threatening the FBI's white supremacist
[10:39.040 --> 10:44.760]  narrative promoted by the president of the United States no less has emboldened a rising
[10:44.760 --> 10:47.440]  epidemic of heinous crimes.
[10:47.440 --> 10:53.360]  For instance, the mass murder by black hoodlums in Miami recently that garnered no national
[10:53.360 --> 10:55.840]  outrage and quickly disappeared.
[10:55.840 --> 11:03.400]  We're killing a good kid for no reason, they got a burn, Miami garden, over lockers on
[11:03.400 --> 11:07.680]  a burn until you'll find out who killed my son.
[11:07.680 --> 11:13.200]  While Chicago's new rule on foot pursuits tells you all you need to know about the dangerous
[11:13.200 --> 11:17.200]  restraint forced on an already vulnerable public.
[11:17.200 --> 11:22.160]  The new policy basically says that to start a foot chase officers must use tactics to
[11:22.160 --> 11:25.720]  try to reduce the possibility of the foot chase in the first place.
[11:25.720 --> 11:30.960]  Make sure body cameras are on and recording, only pursue when there's probable cause for
[11:30.960 --> 11:35.600]  an arrest and never pursue someone for minor traffic offenses.
[11:35.600 --> 11:41.240]  And even the economy has succumbed to the infiltration of policies protecting the radical
[11:41.240 --> 11:44.200]  left's precious zombie hordes.
[11:44.200 --> 11:49.960]  So look at burglaries, we compiled data from police and found they rose in nearly every
[11:49.960 --> 11:55.640]  neighborhood in the past year that's compared to the same time period the year before.
[11:55.640 --> 11:59.640]  Some of the biggest spikes happen in some of the wealthier neighborhoods.
[11:59.640 --> 12:04.320]  Surveillance videos and pictures of prowling predators lurking, breaking and entering
[12:04.320 --> 12:06.040]  garages and homes.
[12:06.040 --> 12:11.720]  Burglars across the city catapulted more than 62% from mid-March the onset of the pandemic
[12:11.720 --> 12:13.680]  until the end of last year.
[12:13.680 --> 12:23.960]  When you see an activity like that go up that much, you are either talking about more active
[12:23.960 --> 12:27.760]  burglars or more burglars.
[12:27.760 --> 12:38.360]  Is it any wonder that gun sales are now up 64% John Bowne reporting?
[12:38.360 --> 12:45.480]  We are drugged out, we are following other people's opinions, we are controlled by the
[12:45.480 --> 12:52.440]  media, today it all changes, this reality has been forced upon us, it is a choice just
[12:52.440 --> 12:54.160]  like when I said slavery is a choice.
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.080]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing as expecting a different result.
[12:59.080 --> 13:02.800]  So we keep on saying I hate you, I hate you, f**k you, f**k you, how are we going to get
[13:02.800 --> 13:08.640]  a different result out of hate, why don't we just try love, why don't we just try love,
[13:08.640 --> 13:12.600]  we have the resources for a peaceful world.
[13:12.600 --> 13:17.360]  You know sometimes you need some crazy mother f**kers to change something, Steve Jobs is
[13:17.360 --> 13:22.000]  crazy, now we all want Steve Jobs phones, they say Trump's crazy, they say I'm crazy,
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.240]  but I'm here to show love, it's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe
[13:27.240 --> 13:30.160]  told me.
[13:30.160 --> 13:39.440]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[13:39.440 --> 13:53.200]  All right, my friends, those are very important reports, so I hope the transmission out with
[13:53.200 --> 13:54.200]  them today.
[13:54.200 --> 13:56.040]  And I have an example of what John Baum was talking about in that report, this is in
[13:56.040 --> 14:00.880]  Austin, how would anyone want to live in Austin anymore after what the Travis County DA just
[14:00.880 --> 14:01.880]  did?
[14:01.880 --> 14:08.520]  A felon had a 200 mile car chase with the police at over 100 miles an hour from Houston
[14:08.520 --> 14:15.280]  to Austin, had a huge criminal record, they let him out, he's been chased for armed robbery
[14:15.280 --> 14:18.280]  and he did 10 more armed robberies.
[14:18.280 --> 14:24.800]  That's just one example and the new DA was put in, 90% was funding by George Soros and
[14:24.800 --> 14:34.040]  admits he works directly for George Soros and if you're white and you get a DWI, you
[14:34.040 --> 14:39.040]  get the book thrown at you, if you're brown you don't and he says he's repaying racism,
[14:39.040 --> 14:41.160]  what the hell does that mean?
[14:41.160 --> 14:46.520]  I mean, they throw the book at everybody, but now they throw the book at white people
[14:46.520 --> 14:48.520]  only and he says he does.
[14:48.520 --> 14:55.120]  I'm going to be getting to that later, this is how the globalists are taking over.
[14:55.120 --> 15:02.120]  Wow, just incredible and Soros is really our president right now, he's taken over almost
[15:02.120 --> 15:08.480]  all the major cities and counties he's put his people in, he's got over 800 district
[15:08.480 --> 15:14.520]  attorneys, hundreds and hundreds of county attorneys, he's got over 20 attorney generals
[15:14.520 --> 15:19.840]  over states like Leticia James in New York, it's just amazing, now listen, I always say
[15:19.840 --> 15:24.960]  this is true, but as things get crazier each show gets more important the last, but this
[15:24.960 --> 15:29.720]  is an order of magnitude, I played those special reports because they're important, but also
[15:29.720 --> 15:34.280]  I was sitting here not able to even go on air because I don't know what the top story
[15:34.280 --> 15:40.920]  is, it's all too insane, too smoking gun and too painful, I mean we can't just talk about
[15:40.920 --> 15:46.440]  this at a certain point, I mean wait till I cover what just broke when we come back,
[15:46.440 --> 15:50.720]  okay, believe me, you don't want to miss this, everybody's attuning right now, tell everybody
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.360]  you need to tune in now, everybody's got to tune in now, however you're listening, send
[15:55.360 --> 16:03.600]  a call to the link or tell them right now, your voice counts, when you share information
[16:03.600 --> 16:08.760]  be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world, the globalists know their agenda

[17:02.040 --> 17:05.840]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[17:05.840 --> 17:11.280]  Yeah, first of all let me say I love your products, I am a granny and for all the senior
[17:11.280 --> 17:16.160]  citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sun
[17:16.160 --> 17:21.720]  spots or age spots as they're lovingly called, but since taking your X2 for the last couple
[17:21.720 --> 17:28.840]  of years my skin has just really gorgeous actually, people think I'm 55 years old and
[17:28.840 --> 17:32.920]  I was already taking your other supplements but I thought you know well maybe that's what
[17:32.920 --> 17:37.440]  I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started taking
[17:37.440 --> 17:42.880]  it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time I started noticing
[17:42.880 --> 17:48.960]  okay you know this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful you know, I don't have to
[17:48.960 --> 17:55.040]  put on derma blend anymore you know, so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally
[17:55.040 --> 17:57.840]  cleared up my skin.
[17:57.840 --> 18:03.200]  Fauci is the first big domino that's just teetering on the edge of collapse and if he
[18:03.200 --> 18:08.080]  falls the entire house of guards goes down, there's a viral report we put out a month
[18:08.080 --> 18:11.920]  ago that's the blueprint for bringing these criminals down, dealing with Peter Dazek,
[18:11.920 --> 18:18.040]  the project manager of the Wuhan lab under funding from Fauci and Bill Gates and it's
[18:18.040 --> 18:21.920]  all coming out in the emails but we don't need the emails, turns out he bragged a year
[18:21.920 --> 18:27.760]  and a half ago how they created a five virus chimera now known as COVID-19.
[18:27.760 --> 18:34.000]  Peter Dazek is the final little domino to knock over the first big one Fauci that could
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.920]  bring down the whole new world order, we're covering it all now at band.video and freeworldnews.tv
[18:39.920 --> 18:44.320]  that's the URL to share freeworldnews.tv get this out to everybody you know the world's
[18:44.320 --> 18:49.520]  awakening and now is the time for you to be the Paul Revere's so I'm firing the bat signal
[18:49.520 --> 18:54.200]  now get this report that's on screen and get off to everyone you know smoking gun video
[18:54.200 --> 19:00.800]  Fauci project manager confesses to creating COVID-19.
[19:00.800 --> 19:27.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[19:27.480 --> 19:32.960]  Ladies and gentlemen the questioning is here thank you for joining us on this live original
[19:32.960 --> 19:40.920]  teleprompter free edition of the Alex Jones show it is Monday June 7th 2021 TV viewers
[19:40.920 --> 19:46.560]  overhead shot please here it is daily mail it's also in Wall Street Journal everywhere
[19:46.560 --> 19:55.400]  Dr. Fauci briefed world leaders secretly the coronavirus escaped from a Wuhan lab in the
[19:55.400 --> 20:01.880]  spring and we already know this but now top scientists have worked with him to cover their
[20:01.880 --> 20:07.080]  butts like Scott Gottlieb former FDA commissioner has gone public and I told you about a month
[20:07.080 --> 20:10.760]  ago when all this started that they were already quietly blowing the whistle because they
[20:10.760 --> 20:14.880]  didn't want to get the death penalty like other people will probably end up actually
[20:14.880 --> 20:21.960]  getting when this comes out Nuremberg too and so they're now releasing the information
[20:21.960 --> 20:30.120]  do you realize the magnitude of what I just said while they're blocking hydroxychloroquine
[20:30.120 --> 20:35.600]  and rendezvous here while they're saying keep the airports open from China to the US while
[20:35.600 --> 20:42.000]  all this is going on he'd run the lab run the program created the viruses had it released
[20:42.000 --> 20:48.920]  had it just stayed in Chinese brought it over here and then use it for fear and control
[20:48.920 --> 20:53.640]  and vaccine patents he and Bill Gates own to make hundreds of billions of dollars for
[20:53.640 --> 20:59.560]  their companies and ran big tech and censored everyone so they couldn't respond to any of
[20:59.560 --> 21:05.120]  it so let's go to the headlines Dr. Fauci briefed world leaders in secret the coronavirus
[21:05.120 --> 21:09.200]  escape from the Wuhan lab in the spring says the head of the FDA at the time kind of a
[21:09.200 --> 21:16.600]  big deal here's another one genome sequencing top scientists with CRISPR systems say that
[21:16.600 --> 21:22.120]  it almost certainly is manmade from the Wuhan lab just as folks already knew 16 months ago
[21:22.120 --> 21:27.880]  that's another huge article and then this mega bombshell it's worse than we thought
[21:27.880 --> 21:32.720]  well we actually knew this Fauci and top US doctors caught they conspired to disqualify
[21:32.720 --> 21:42.160]  hydroxychloroquine as COVID treatment millions dead as a result when it was 99% and aerosolized
[21:42.160 --> 21:47.720]  steroids are 99% if you're too far gone they can't help you but it's 100% they get it early
[21:47.720 --> 21:55.400]  same thing with Rindesivir 100% 100% 100% and they knew and they blocked it and they
[21:55.400 --> 22:01.760]  still do the UN is blocking India getting Rindesivir that any Indian can afford $20 for
[22:01.760 --> 22:07.040]  the whole regiment take it prophylactically people around you have a really bad cold
[22:07.040 --> 22:14.240]  knocks it out but you don't get that you get to die and it gets worse there have been a
[22:14.240 --> 22:18.520]  plethora of nurses and doctors going public on this show and others and in the news that
[22:18.520 --> 22:22.760]  they're ordered when people have blood clots strokes heart attacks or bleeding on the lungs
[22:22.760 --> 22:28.360]  after they've had the vaccines that aren't vaccines remember that there's a gene therapy
[22:28.360 --> 22:34.120]  that was that was emergency authorized was not tested that's another lie and it's in
[22:34.120 --> 22:38.720]  the older studies of similar vaccines gene therapies that it causes these problems and
[22:38.720 --> 22:42.600]  top scientists warned it would attack the proteins in the body because the virus made
[22:42.600 --> 22:53.600]  up the same thing the tax the carrier the shallow virus the body the exoskeleton basically
[22:53.600 --> 23:01.800]  and they're ordering the nurses and others not to put it in a report so it's got to go
[23:01.800 --> 23:08.080]  on the veirs so the hospital administration can cover it up nurse houston hospital instructs
[23:08.080 --> 23:12.960]  employees not to list vaccine adverse reactions she works there she's going public but then
[23:12.960 --> 23:19.640]  all the line because she's not a murderer she had a hypocritical to do no harm we got
[23:19.640 --> 23:23.720]  that interview coming up and folks it just goes on from there but the answer to this
[23:23.720 --> 23:32.640]  charity the answer to 1984 is this right here ladies and gentlemen dr. Jill dr. Fauci in
[23:32.640 --> 23:39.800]  Harlem greeted with a chorus of booze and chance fire Fauci articles are up at gateway
[23:39.800 --> 23:44.800]  punnett com info wars dot com national follow dot com need to share these videos because
[23:44.800 --> 23:49.720]  this is the answer there's a lot of these videos they're all amazing but that's what
[23:49.720 --> 23:56.040]  has to happen but not just fire Fauci I was saying fire Fauci in April of last year in
[23:56.040 --> 24:03.480]  speeches around the country now I've been saying arrest Fauci for at least that was
[24:03.480 --> 24:10.280]  a year and four months ago I've been saying arrest Fauci for a year at least he needs
[24:10.280 --> 24:19.200]  to be arrested that's the response instead it's will he even be fired he briefed the
[24:19.200 --> 24:27.800]  UN and he briefed the head of the FDA that this was going on and then it came out of
[24:27.800 --> 24:33.280]  the lab and he knew that and then said that it was preposterous to Congress and preposterous
[24:33.280 --> 24:38.800]  to Senator Paul and then said he never fun again a function when he was the grand daddy
[24:38.800 --> 24:45.320]  of it again it's like saying Chuck Berry was not the founder of rock and roll or Elvis
[24:45.320 --> 24:49.600]  wasn't the king of rock and roll or Roger Stahlback didn't play for the Dallas Cowboys
[24:49.600 --> 25:00.040]  or go down the list I mean it's or or the skies it blew I mean the level of the gas
[25:00.040 --> 25:08.600]  lighting is absolutely insane and that's just the tip of the iceberg but here's how you
[25:08.600 --> 25:13.840]  respond to it Fauci's in Harlem and hundreds and hundreds of people show up thousands
[25:13.840 --> 25:19.800]  millions need to show up and not just say fire Fauci Nuremberg code they launched it
[25:19.800 --> 25:25.320]  on purpose they made the virus they lied about it they controlled it and his own chief scientist
[25:25.320 --> 25:30.120]  that ran the program for Fauci said they were combining five viruses together to create
[25:30.120 --> 25:34.880]  a vaccine but to create the fear they had to release it to then give you the so-called
[25:34.880 --> 25:40.040]  vaccine that is a gene therapy to have this whole revolution this whole takeover again
[25:40.040 --> 25:44.320]  a week and a half ago two weeks ago they tried to pass a law to ban human animal clones that
[25:44.320 --> 25:52.360]  are already being made and the Senate said no it's legal now they got TV shows the condition
[25:52.360 --> 26:00.640]  you accept it that are fiction shows it's not fiction it's old news you don't have time
[26:00.640 --> 26:04.880]  with the learning curve here to play games anymore we're in a lot of trouble this is
[26:04.880 --> 26:12.880]  a scientific lunatic takeover they're preparing us for total the population of the earth and
[26:12.880 --> 26:18.920]  saying only the animal humans will be alive in the future exactly as I told you their
[26:18.920 --> 26:24.600]  plan is all conditioning all their sick dystopic plan and they're doing nothing but conditioning
[26:24.600 --> 26:29.560]  you to get ready for it where the clones of the victims and are being hunted down I told
[26:29.560 --> 26:34.680]  you that was coming next that's the transhumanist move they make these synthetic creatures
[26:34.680 --> 26:38.360]  and then they demand we all bow down to them and give them all these rights that's why
[26:38.360 --> 26:42.800]  you have to say a man's a woman they get you to accept a man with a foot long penis is
[26:42.800 --> 26:51.480]  a woman then you will accept anything all right let's go to some of Fauci being surrounded
[26:51.480 --> 27:08.840]  by villagers with pitchforks here it is I'm pulling up all these SCVs like he's gone
[27:08.840 --> 27:26.760]  now this is what we need to see and it goes on the road there were hundreds more as a
[27:26.760 --> 27:35.640]  bunch of these videos arrest Fauci look at that big pharma criminal taking over our
[27:35.640 --> 27:39.680]  media they're censoring everybody they're getting away with murder literal murder suppressing
[27:39.680 --> 27:43.840]  all the real treatments and then a bunch of jerks and their sunglasses all acting tough
[27:43.840 --> 27:48.600]  and bowing themselves up like they're great they'll all be dying too from the poison my
[27:48.600 --> 27:55.320]  god this is disgusting a little maggot Fauci he needs to be tried four times against humanity
[27:55.320 --> 28:09.440]  what our champions made of here's a man who can show you
[28:09.440 --> 28:33.400]  live
[28:33.400 --> 29:01.120]  I am very, very proud to be at the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[29:01.120 --> 29:07.400]  I can't stay at the tip of the spear fighting for my family and your family unless you support

[30:59.120 --> 31:26.120]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:26.120 --> 31:45.840]  Go ahead and stick that GMO, big pharma needle in your arm, designed and created by a man
[31:45.840 --> 31:48.680]  that says he wants to repopulate the earth.
[31:48.680 --> 31:49.680]  Bill Gates.
[31:49.680 --> 31:54.840]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you what is coming up today here in the rest
[31:54.840 --> 32:01.400]  of the transmission because there is so much, truly so much amazing stuff that we're going
[32:01.400 --> 32:03.800]  to be breaking down.
[32:03.800 --> 32:10.280]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is going to be coming on to talk about a whole raft
[32:10.280 --> 32:15.920]  of big developments that have been, sorry, my headsets going out here.
[32:15.920 --> 32:20.880]  I love these headsets because they're portable, but the wires that go into them after a while
[32:20.880 --> 32:25.080]  start going out and it can become an issue.
[32:25.080 --> 32:29.800]  I'm not really getting any sound unless they're playing music or playing clubs, but when it
[32:29.800 --> 32:34.160]  starts going out it's going like...
[32:34.160 --> 32:36.600]  And so I had to get it out and wiggle it there.
[32:36.600 --> 32:41.240]  No, folks aren't telling me what to say or what to do through this.
[32:41.240 --> 32:46.120]  That's another conspiracy online that Jones is being told what to say.
[32:46.120 --> 32:49.280]  Yeah, I wish sometimes somebody would tell me what to say.
[32:49.280 --> 32:53.200]  I'm trying to figure all this out, it's driving me crazy.
[32:53.200 --> 32:57.880]  So getting back to what I was saying there, I don't need to do it, I'm great.
[32:57.880 --> 33:02.040]  I'm going to go to rebroadcast for a while, I'm going to relax, I'm going to chill, I'm
[33:02.040 --> 33:06.240]  going to have a nice, calm, happy day.
[33:06.240 --> 33:10.480]  I almost didn't do the show today and I'm not complaining.
[33:10.480 --> 33:16.680]  It's just that I am really, genuinely freaked out and I have a lot that I need to cover
[33:16.680 --> 33:24.280]  and a lot I need to say and I have just gotten to the point where I look at all this and
[33:24.280 --> 33:26.520]  then I don't want to look at it anymore.
[33:26.520 --> 33:33.560]  And so I'm really trying right now to make myself cover this news and it's just...
[33:33.560 --> 33:35.040]  Why are we even letting all this happen?
[33:35.040 --> 33:39.280]  I mean, I'm going to say this again.
[33:39.280 --> 33:42.960]  They have been cloning humans for 50 years in the medical literature.
[33:42.960 --> 33:48.360]  It's not debated, it's not something that's even questioned.
[33:48.360 --> 33:51.440]  And what they do is they admit the cloning and then when there's pushback, they go, we're
[33:51.440 --> 33:52.440]  not cloning.
[33:52.440 --> 33:55.600]  Then they admit the cloning, when there's pushback, they go, we're not cloning.
[33:55.600 --> 33:59.200]  And then to move the overton window, they go, oh, we're cloning animals and humans for
[33:59.200 --> 34:01.040]  decades, no big deal.
[34:01.040 --> 34:06.120]  And then, okay, well, we think that's a bad idea, no, no, no, it doesn't exist.
[34:06.120 --> 34:10.320]  And they play these games.
[34:10.320 --> 34:16.520]  And then now, they are all over the news on the cover of major newspapers telling you
[34:16.520 --> 34:24.160]  that not only are we making human animal clones, we're going to put them on the streets and
[34:24.160 --> 34:26.080]  you're going to accept it.
[34:26.080 --> 34:28.960]  People say, well, that'll never happen.
[34:28.960 --> 34:39.360]  20 years ago, in places like Hong Kong and China, where anything goes, they had racist
[34:39.360 --> 34:52.800]  monkeys that are part jellyfish that produce a glow in the dark effect.
[34:52.800 --> 34:57.800]  And last time I checked an article, they were saying thousands of people a year were buying
[34:57.800 --> 35:01.360]  these from these unlicensed genetic markets.
[35:01.360 --> 35:05.160]  So that's already Blade Runner level stuff.
[35:05.160 --> 35:08.480]  And then you tell people that here, hey, it's in the Hong Kong news, they're selling these
[35:08.480 --> 35:12.520]  monkeys, and then there's video of it 20 years ago.
[35:12.520 --> 35:16.680]  And I sit there and have arguments with people that will walk up to me in a grocery store
[35:16.680 --> 35:18.560]  and say, you're full of crap, Jones.
[35:18.560 --> 35:20.840]  There's no animal, human hybrids.
[35:20.840 --> 35:26.440]  So it just gets old, okay?
[35:26.440 --> 35:32.880]  The naivete and like the pre-programming here, so here's what I'm going to do.
[35:32.880 --> 35:36.040]  Barnes is joining us in the second hour.
[35:36.040 --> 35:41.360]  Yeah, there's glow in the dark mice, it just goes on and on, glow in the dark pigs, everything
[35:41.360 --> 35:42.360]  else.
[35:42.360 --> 35:46.040]  On the radio, let's just go, what's Jones talking about?
[35:46.040 --> 35:51.840]  While I'm on air, they'll be putting things up on screen, videos and things like that.
[35:51.840 --> 35:56.720]  Just backing up what I'm saying, and I tend to kind of riff off of that.
[35:56.720 --> 36:00.240]  But see, all of this is interesting, but where it's leading us and what the design of the
[36:00.240 --> 36:04.720]  New World Order is, is what's really bad because they've said in all of their official statements
[36:04.720 --> 36:09.880]  the policy of world government is the total eradication of every human on earth.
[36:09.880 --> 36:13.560]  And last week I probably read a hundred or more articles on air that had just come out
[36:13.560 --> 36:17.520]  that week saying humans are bad, we've got to get rid of ourselves, no human should be
[36:17.520 --> 36:21.720]  allowed to exist, we must all kill ourselves, don't have children, especially if you're
[36:21.720 --> 36:25.600]  a white woman, white people are bad, and then all these weird white women going, yes, whites
[36:25.600 --> 36:27.400]  are bad, I'm not having children.
[36:27.400 --> 36:32.680]  I mean, this is the dystopic hell that they're selling.
[36:32.680 --> 36:37.280]  They're not pushing this on every channel because they don't plan to put human animal
[36:37.280 --> 36:41.320]  clones on the streets.
[36:41.320 --> 36:46.400]  You know, I've told you that there are human clones walking around.
[36:46.400 --> 36:49.440]  You think I just pulled that out of my rear end?
[36:49.440 --> 36:54.240]  You think I just pulled it out of my nose maybe, or maybe out of the air?
[36:54.240 --> 37:00.840]  That Gates was doing a human cloning program with the pimp, you know, that didn't hang
[37:00.840 --> 37:12.880]  himself in that New York jail cell?
[37:12.880 --> 37:17.600]  Mad scientists run the planet, they're ready to go fully operational with their whole takeover,
[37:17.600 --> 37:19.800]  and I'm explaining this real slow.
[37:19.800 --> 37:24.760]  They don't want you to resist them and they want to normalize it, and so they're using
[37:24.760 --> 37:31.080]  propaganda and media to desensitize you to see this everywhere as fiction so that as
[37:31.080 --> 37:34.880]  the real thing happens, you don't differentiate the difference between that, and that's why
[37:34.880 --> 37:39.360]  the general public is so enslaved for so many reasons, but one of the big ones is the general
[37:39.360 --> 37:46.880]  public does not differentiate entertainment and movies and horror and torture and death
[37:46.880 --> 37:49.880]  with the real world.
[37:49.880 --> 37:57.640]  What they do is they blur it all together, and now people psychologically don't get upset
[37:57.640 --> 38:02.080]  or threatened by things that should really threaten you.
[38:02.080 --> 38:06.920]  People have had their life force taken, their survival instinct nullified or basically dialed
[38:06.920 --> 38:13.840]  back or turned off, and my survival instinct is not dialed back, they're not turned off,
[38:13.840 --> 38:18.280]  but still it's all just normal and everyone's going on about their business like all this
[38:18.280 --> 38:22.160]  is normal.
[38:22.160 --> 38:28.640]  So I'm going to settle down here for a moment and try to, because I mean, the crew is the
[38:28.640 --> 38:31.560]  best ever, everybody's wonderful, this little thing around here, I want to just turn the
[38:31.560 --> 38:35.560]  whole desk over and start smashing everything, that's how I feel right now, because you know,
[38:35.560 --> 38:39.440]  it's not normal as a man that knows all this to just sit here and talk about it.
[38:39.440 --> 38:44.520]  You know the people protesting Fauci get that in New York, but you know, we all really know
[38:44.520 --> 38:46.440]  that's not enough, is it?
[38:46.440 --> 38:51.000]  He's assaulting us, he got caught doing the whole thing with Bill Gates, they're murdering
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.920]  us, and I'm not calling for violence because they use that against us and turn that little
[38:54.920 --> 39:03.320]  monster into a victim, but I physically cannot sit here and watch them do this anymore.
[39:03.320 --> 39:13.920]  But you know what, I don't say this is hyperbole, I don't say this as something that I'm even
[39:13.920 --> 39:20.600]  joking about, I'm serious, that we have to logically look at this and say, maybe we're
[39:20.600 --> 39:25.840]  the bad people, maybe Bill Gates is the good guy, seriously.
[39:25.840 --> 39:29.960]  He cares, he has passion, he works hard, he believes to save the earth and create a new
[39:29.960 --> 39:35.320]  science and help his people live forever, he believes he can become a god, now I'm not
[39:35.320 --> 39:39.240]  defending that idea and my gut tells me it's satanic, my spirit tells me it's bad, Bill
[39:39.240 --> 39:47.200]  Gates is a little demonic, grim one, but maybe the general public doesn't care about their
[39:47.200 --> 39:52.720]  own children and know all this and decide not to care, maybe Bill Gates serves a purpose
[39:52.720 --> 39:56.800]  in God's plan and maybe you do deserve to die, maybe your children deserve to die, these
[39:56.800 --> 40:02.920]  horrible cancer-ridden deaths, maybe, okay, so maybe Bill Gates is good, maybe that's
[40:02.920 --> 40:07.520]  what it is, because I keep coming to this point of like they're killing everybody and
[40:07.520 --> 40:12.760]  they're doing all this and they're just overriding nature and all of it's poisonous and horrible
[40:12.760 --> 40:24.280]  and they're all involved in a satanic experiment against us and we don't do anything, I don't
[40:24.280 --> 40:31.240]  like them playing God on me and I do not consent to the geoengineering and the 5G and the poisonous
[40:31.240 --> 40:36.680]  gene therapy and all this crap and I tell you though this planet is a madhouse, it's
[40:36.680 --> 40:45.360]  a damn madhouse, people better get serious, this isn't a game, this isn't a joke, there
[40:45.360 --> 40:50.040]  are going to be hundreds of millions of people dying within a year to two years, there's
[40:50.040 --> 40:55.320]  already hundreds of thousands dying of these poison shots and the general public has no
[40:55.320 --> 40:56.320]  idea.
[40:56.320 --> 41:01.160]  There are now over a hundred peer-reviewed studies in just the last year documenting
[41:01.160 --> 41:06.480]  that surgical masks do nothing to stop the transmission and the spread of viruses, it's
[41:06.480 --> 41:08.440]  a hoax, it's a fraud.
[41:08.440 --> 41:13.840]  Here's another article on info wars.com, a major German study showing exactly the same
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.560]  thing but Fauci knew that, he wrote a study himself, his name's on it, in 2008 saying
[41:19.560 --> 41:27.240]  not only do masks not work but most of the deaths of the Spanish flu back in 1917, 1918
[41:27.240 --> 41:31.440]  were caused by people wearing masks and it breeding bacterial pneumonia in it, they're
[41:31.440 --> 41:37.440]  filthy diapers, many people dying have died of bacterial pneumonia and they call it COVID-19
[41:37.440 --> 41:40.120]  and the criminal Fauci and others knew it all.
[41:40.120 --> 41:43.800]  That's why it's more important than ever to keep info wars on the air, our big sale ends
[41:43.800 --> 41:48.200]  this Monday, she got three days left, store wide free shipping, double paydria points

[41:55.520 --> 41:59.640]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast, hell I've been
[41:59.640 --> 42:03.800]  on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that, but let me tell you,
[42:03.800 --> 42:08.080]  the new world order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming
[42:08.080 --> 42:11.920]  after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down, so please pray to keep
[42:11.920 --> 42:16.200]  info wars on the air and please support the local station you're listening to as well,
[42:16.200 --> 42:22.200]  at the same time go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[42:22.200 --> 42:27.080]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[42:27.080 --> 42:28.560]  in the face of this thing.
[42:28.560 --> 42:33.440]  I need your help more than ever now, I want to keep fighting the globalist but I can't
[42:33.440 --> 42:38.680]  do it if you don't support us, so pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast
[42:38.680 --> 42:43.600]  however you can and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every
[42:43.600 --> 42:49.320]  day at infowarstore.com whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements or books or films,
[42:49.320 --> 42:55.120]  all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-god,
[42:55.120 --> 42:57.920]  thank you so much.
[42:57.920 --> 43:04.840]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[43:04.840 --> 43:12.160]  that this is all a test, this experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[43:12.160 --> 43:17.440]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension so we can decide
[43:17.440 --> 43:21.720]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come
[43:21.720 --> 43:26.320]  down to that, so as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good
[43:26.320 --> 43:31.200]  in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness, God is
[43:31.200 --> 43:37.600]  the author of us having our own will, God is the author of us having free will and that
[43:37.600 --> 43:42.600]  free will is a beautiful thing and when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and
[43:42.600 --> 43:49.000]  this whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.520]  your free will, it's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the
[43:52.520 --> 43:59.520]  world because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of
[43:59.520 --> 44:00.520]  the universe.
[44:00.520 --> 44:01.520]  I'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious.
[44:01.520 --> 44:04.880]  I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals.
[44:04.880 --> 44:12.320]  Last week, the arch-globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass
[44:12.320 --> 44:17.320]  and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it, have taken the so-called
[44:17.320 --> 44:18.320]  COVID-19 Frankenstein.
[44:18.320 --> 44:25.840]  I'm going to say it the second time, around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused
[44:25.840 --> 44:28.880]  to take the Franken shots.
[44:28.880 --> 44:30.440]  They don't trust it.
[44:30.440 --> 44:31.760]  You shouldn't trust it.
[44:31.760 --> 44:34.560]  The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world.
[44:34.560 --> 44:37.720]  This is an attack on the American people and the people of the world.
[44:37.720 --> 44:41.160]  This is an absolute red flag smoking God.
[44:41.160 --> 44:44.000]  Again, let me say it two more times.
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.640]  Half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff, refuse to take
[44:48.640 --> 44:49.640]  the vaccines.
[44:49.640 --> 44:50.640]  That's right.
[44:50.640 --> 44:54.840]  The doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine and you shouldn't either.
[44:54.840 --> 45:00.040]  You should warn everyone you know about the truth.
[45:00.040 --> 45:26.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:26.040 --> 45:55.880]  Shortest straw, shortest straw has been pulled for you, pulled for you.
[45:55.880 --> 46:03.480]  All right, so the global depopulation program has gone into high gear.
[46:03.480 --> 46:04.480]  It's a UN takeover.
[46:04.480 --> 46:08.080]  The UN is in charge of what you can say, what you can do.
[46:08.080 --> 46:13.080]  Naomi Wolf, one of the biggest liberal feminist in the world, probably the number one feminist,
[46:13.080 --> 46:17.440]  but she actually does care about women, that means she cares about humanity, even though
[46:17.440 --> 46:18.440]  she's been misled.
[46:18.440 --> 46:22.080]  She now admits she's been misled about the left, basically the whole deal.
[46:22.080 --> 46:26.240]  We need guns and there's a global government, a depopulation program that wants to kill
[46:26.240 --> 46:28.920]  us and a total medical worldwide tyranny.
[46:28.920 --> 46:35.400]  So see, she's a real person, because listen, either wake up and fight the new order or
[46:35.400 --> 46:38.200]  you roll over and die.
[46:38.200 --> 46:41.360]  And so right wingers better wake up, left wingers better wake up, black people better
[46:41.360 --> 46:45.200]  wake up, white people better wake up, because we're all under attack.
[46:45.200 --> 46:50.960]  No amount of money, no amount of power is going to get you out of this.
[46:50.960 --> 46:54.080]  This is a mad cult racing to try to be God.
[46:54.080 --> 46:56.560]  And I read to you these incredible headlines earlier.
[46:56.560 --> 46:57.960]  I haven't even scratched the surface.
[46:57.960 --> 47:01.120]  They get just as bad as these bombshells.
[47:01.120 --> 47:11.080]  Fauci brief world leaders secretly last year in the spring about it being lab made, says
[47:11.080 --> 47:14.360]  the former head of the Food and Drug Administration, Scott Gottlieb.
[47:14.360 --> 47:17.760]  Well, I think they're all resigning last year and this year.
[47:17.760 --> 47:21.720]  And as soon as new ones sign up, they resigned like a two weeks to a month.
[47:21.720 --> 47:27.480]  Why there have been so many resignations in every one of those agencies, CDC, NIH, all
[47:27.480 --> 47:28.480]  of it.
[47:28.480 --> 47:29.480]  Why?
[47:29.480 --> 47:33.240]  Because they get in there and they find out what Fauci and Bill Gates did and they said,
[47:33.240 --> 47:35.840]  are you crazy?
[47:35.840 --> 47:36.840]  And I told you all this.
[47:36.840 --> 47:42.800]  I said, big whistleblowers from federal agencies are leaving the sinking ship a month ago and
[47:42.800 --> 47:46.640]  they're all going to come out against Fauci and admit that he was behind it with Bill
[47:46.640 --> 47:47.640]  Gates.
[47:47.640 --> 47:48.640]  He's out there.
[47:48.640 --> 47:54.920]  Redfield, Gottlieb, the current head of the U.N. vaccine program, she's come out and said
[47:54.920 --> 47:58.320]  the vaccines are killing people in a cover up.
[47:58.320 --> 48:01.800]  And then their response was to launch COVID-19 right around that time.
[48:01.800 --> 48:06.480]  She said that on December 2, 2019, it was already released right around that time.
[48:06.480 --> 48:08.680]  That's covering your ass.
[48:08.680 --> 48:14.920]  I mean, they look like when you'd see our fighter pilot shot down over North Vietnam
[48:14.920 --> 48:18.880]  and they'd been held for a few years and they'd wheel them out on camera.
[48:18.880 --> 48:21.600]  And they had that look like a gun was to their head.
[48:21.600 --> 48:25.320]  All these people have a look like they have a gun to their head, except for Bill Gates
[48:25.320 --> 48:28.760]  and Fauci look like they just won the lottery.
[48:28.760 --> 48:37.080]  They look like they're to kid in a candy shop, a dog in a butcher shop.
[48:37.080 --> 48:38.800]  Because they're taking the damn world over.
[48:38.800 --> 48:39.800]  These are megalomaniacs.
[48:39.800 --> 48:42.640]  You go, why would they try something so, so bold, so crazy?
[48:42.640 --> 48:44.800]  That's what megalomaniacs do.
[48:44.800 --> 48:49.200]  Great Bill Gates spent hundreds of billions of dollars in all this crap generationally
[48:49.200 --> 48:52.560]  to get control of all the health services because he likes you.
[48:52.560 --> 48:55.320]  He says he wants to kill you.
[48:55.320 --> 49:00.080]  He can't even shut up his ugly-looking mouth.
[49:00.080 --> 49:01.080]  That's a killer.
[49:01.080 --> 49:08.240]  I think this is a damn game and it isn't a game, people.
[49:08.240 --> 49:09.600]  And you could just feel the death.
[49:09.600 --> 49:13.920]  I mean, I've got nurses around the country going public and doctors saying from Florida
[49:13.920 --> 49:18.520]  to Texas, from New York to California, from Michigan, it's happening in the UK, Germany
[49:18.520 --> 49:19.520]  everywhere.
[49:19.520 --> 49:24.920]  But they're being ordered to cover up the deaths and illnesses and guess what they do
[49:24.920 --> 49:25.920]  in Germany?
[49:25.920 --> 49:31.360]  Germany, they come arrest the doctors and put them in mental institutions for a month or
[49:31.360 --> 49:36.640]  so and then put them on house arrest.
[49:36.640 --> 49:39.320]  And then one of them went back on TV and they arrested him again.
[49:39.320 --> 49:44.880]  They're arresting doctors that work in major hospitals for killing you.
[49:44.880 --> 49:45.880]  They're killing people.
[49:45.880 --> 49:54.720]  You're like, well, if this was going on, someone would warn us, they are, they are.
[49:54.720 --> 49:58.720]  And see, Naomi Wolfe's smart enough for the average liberal out there watching or making
[49:58.720 --> 50:01.880]  fun of us on Twitter or Facebook because they play clips and laugh about it.
[50:01.880 --> 50:03.680]  I think it's all funny.
[50:03.680 --> 50:04.680]  You got your blue hair.
[50:04.680 --> 50:07.520]  You got your three or four degrees that aren't going to be worth anything.
[50:07.520 --> 50:12.720]  You got all this, you know, intersectionalism and all your little pronouns and all your crap.
[50:12.720 --> 50:16.080]  That's all just to make you a loser that doesn't know how to function in society.
[50:16.080 --> 50:20.360]  In the real world, there's a world government depopulation plan taking over.
[50:20.360 --> 50:24.240]  And you can go, well, I know that there are too many people and you can pretend you're
[50:24.240 --> 50:27.600]  part of the power structure, but you're not.
[50:27.600 --> 50:32.720]  In fact, Fauci and Gates can pretend they're in charge of all this.
[50:32.720 --> 50:34.680]  They're the biggest idiots of all.
[50:34.680 --> 50:42.480]  Can you imagine what comes around, goes around karma, you reap what you sow, whatever you
[50:42.480 --> 50:43.480]  want to call it.
[50:43.480 --> 50:44.480]  It's a law of the universe.
[50:44.480 --> 50:53.280]  Can you imagine the checks they've been writing on the universe that they don't have any right
[50:53.280 --> 50:56.840]  to be writing, playing God?
[50:56.840 --> 51:03.000]  Imagine what the universe thinks about that.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  So there we are.
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  I'm going to control myself.
[51:05.000 --> 51:09.320]  I'm going to get Barnes on here, but we should be mourning.
[51:09.320 --> 51:10.960]  It's like you watch a kid murdered.
[51:10.960 --> 51:11.960]  You're freaked out.
[51:11.960 --> 51:14.840]  You got to go cry for two days or you watch a train wreck or grandma dies.
[51:14.840 --> 51:15.840]  You get upset.
[51:15.840 --> 51:18.680]  I'm not a victim, but I really take all this on.
[51:18.680 --> 51:20.280]  I know how real all this is.
[51:20.280 --> 51:23.640]  I'm having my guts torn out right now.
[51:23.640 --> 51:26.440]  And I know other people don't want to believe all this because it is, it's painful.
[51:26.440 --> 51:27.440]  This is crazy.
[51:27.440 --> 51:29.440]  This is nuts.
[51:29.440 --> 51:35.360]  That he's briefing people that he knew it got out of a lab all line to the world.
[51:35.360 --> 51:40.400]  That's executable right there.
[51:40.400 --> 51:42.360]  That he cooked it up and knowingly released it.
[51:42.360 --> 51:47.360]  You know that's coming out and then they blocked treatments that were 100% so they could have
[51:47.360 --> 51:51.920]  some deaths and then get their emergency authorization for a deadly vaccine that's really going to
[51:51.920 --> 51:52.920]  kill all the people.
[51:52.920 --> 51:57.000]  And when folks die of that now, whether they're the CEOs of companies or anything, it comes
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.760]  out in the news they died of COVID, but they'll always say, well, they did take their second
[52:00.760 --> 52:08.000]  shot a few days before their liver liquefied or their lungs liquefied or their brains liquefied.
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.600]  I'm going to go to break.
[52:11.600 --> 52:12.600]  I'm going to come back and control myself.
[52:12.600 --> 52:16.480]  I'm going to do all of them today, but there is just so much to get to, so much to cover
[52:16.480 --> 52:24.080]  on this live Monday broadcast.
[52:24.080 --> 52:28.440]  I have an exciting announcement that I want to make to everybody.
[52:28.440 --> 52:37.400]  We have come out with three brand new mega immune support supplements.
[52:37.400 --> 52:40.920]  And they're 40% off when you get all three of them together, but there's not a lot of
[52:40.920 --> 52:41.920]  markup in these.
[52:41.920 --> 52:43.760]  I can't ever go above 40%.
[52:43.760 --> 52:46.000]  They're 25% off individually.
[52:46.000 --> 52:52.520]  It's vitamin C and zinc, huge dosage of it of high quality.
[52:52.520 --> 52:55.400]  This isn't the crappy type, it's the good type of both.
[52:55.400 --> 52:58.400]  Vitamin C and zinc turbo charge your immune system, your body.
[52:58.400 --> 53:02.040]  For everything that's going on, you needed this before all this crap went on.
[53:02.040 --> 53:03.840]  This is incredible.
[53:03.840 --> 53:06.040]  Everybody wants a really strong dose of something.
[53:06.040 --> 53:07.880]  Take yourself to the next level.
[53:07.880 --> 53:15.360]  This is 1,000 plus percent more vitamin C than your daily alliance, and 182% of the daily
[53:15.360 --> 53:17.760]  allowance of zinc, because you don't want to go too high on zinc.
[53:17.760 --> 53:20.360]  You can basically take as much as vitamin C as you want.
[53:20.360 --> 53:25.640]  Because this is 1,111 times the vitamin C you need, and Nobel prizes from Linus Pauling,
[53:25.640 --> 53:30.120]  all that were found that you, it's the vitamin C plant derived that you want.
[53:30.120 --> 53:35.040]  And that, again, 1,000% dose is what he said was the bare minimum he would take daily.
[53:35.040 --> 53:36.680]  And it's just incredible what it does.
[53:36.680 --> 53:41.840]  So here it is, zinc and vitamin C from infowarstore.com.
[53:41.840 --> 53:44.800]  And then we have these gummies that are for adults and children.
[53:44.800 --> 53:50.280]  Vitamin D3 with calcium, natural lemon flavor, like lemon drops.
[53:50.280 --> 53:52.400]  They're delicious.
[53:52.400 --> 53:53.600]  You have that as well.
[53:53.600 --> 53:57.800]  And then a multivitamin, whole food multivitamin.
[53:57.800 --> 54:00.720]  This is all organic, all natural, not synthetic.
[54:00.720 --> 54:04.560]  You can go buy synthetic vitamins that do nothing for you, in fact, hurt your liver.
[54:04.560 --> 54:09.320]  You'll see studies out like, oh, multivitamin hurts livers, because it's not, it's synthetic.
[54:09.320 --> 54:14.800]  And that's how they sell you these big name brands for like $10 for a bottle of a multivitamin.
[54:14.800 --> 54:16.800]  It has everything in it you supposedly need.
[54:16.800 --> 54:18.320]  And it does, because it's synthetic.
[54:18.320 --> 54:19.320]  It's not real.
[54:19.320 --> 54:21.680]  That's not what this is.
[54:21.680 --> 54:23.560]  This is a whole food multivitamin.
[54:23.560 --> 54:27.960]  They sell this exact vitamin at the biggest food store in the world.
[54:27.960 --> 54:29.280]  You know their name, Whole Foods.
[54:29.280 --> 54:30.840]  We got it private labeled.
[54:30.840 --> 54:35.600]  It retails there for $50.
[54:35.600 --> 54:38.720]  We've got it for you, $29.95.
[54:38.720 --> 54:41.440]  But there is a lot of money goes into this.
[54:41.440 --> 54:46.880]  So we have the new whole food multivitamin, all the essentials.
[54:46.880 --> 54:52.280]  We have the vitamin D with calcium booster, gummy bear.
[54:52.280 --> 54:57.720]  And then we've got the vitamin C and zinc from, and also rosehemp's is in there.
[54:57.720 --> 54:59.400]  There's so much great stuff for you.
[54:59.400 --> 55:00.400]  So those are there.
[55:00.400 --> 55:04.600]  40% off when you get all three in the trifecta, 25% off when you get them individually.
[55:04.600 --> 55:07.160]  And that's still an amazing deal.
[55:07.160 --> 55:11.640]  And we look, I've been trying to get a multivitamin like this, five mineral fusions, great.
[55:11.640 --> 55:12.640]  That's all in one powder.
[55:12.640 --> 55:13.640]  It's wonderful.
[55:13.640 --> 55:14.640]  But that keeps going on as well.
[55:14.640 --> 55:18.920]  The high quality stuff that's high end, it's all broken down.
[55:18.920 --> 55:26.480]  I put in the orders for this 14 months ago, these products, 14 months ago.
[55:26.480 --> 55:31.040]  And we just now got them made a month ago and they just now came in last week, 14 months
[55:31.040 --> 55:32.040]  ago.
[55:32.040 --> 55:33.600]  So that shows the breakdown of society.
[55:33.600 --> 55:35.800]  We've got a good supply of, but that'll still be limited.
[55:35.800 --> 55:39.800]  I would stock up on this while you can because the breakdown is ongoing and very serious.
[55:39.800 --> 55:42.240]  Stock up on all the essentials and prices are going up.
[55:42.240 --> 55:45.520]  So lock in your savings now at infowarstore.com.
[55:45.520 --> 55:49.920]  I'm shooting this quick news alert on Friday, June 4th, 2021.
[55:49.920 --> 55:52.240]  You see this report from over a month ago.
[55:52.240 --> 55:56.720]  It's just now starting to break in the mainstream news as whistleblowers go public, but we broke
[55:56.720 --> 56:00.160]  it first and it's a banned off video with one million plus views.
[56:00.160 --> 56:02.760]  We've reposted the front page of infowars.com.
[56:02.760 --> 56:08.440]  The project manager for Fauci bragged in an interview a year and a half ago how they created
[56:08.440 --> 56:09.440]  COVID-19.
[56:09.440 --> 56:13.760]  And then he secretly wrote the Lanjit report claiming that it was naturally occurring and
[56:13.760 --> 56:18.000]  then big tech worked with him to engage in fraud and sensitive American people.
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.800]  We're on air right now today and this week and covering it all at infowars.com, port slash

[57:49.680 --> 58:07.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:07.120 --> 58:30.880]  Man, I tell you, Willie Nelson is a big old slicer, real Texas.
[58:30.880 --> 58:39.400]  He comes from around around the same area as my dad, and that is what a lot of those
[58:39.400 --> 58:40.400]  people are like.
[58:40.400 --> 58:46.000]  My dad's kind of like a Willie Nelson type, he's a good guy, a lot more calm than I am.
[58:46.000 --> 58:47.000]  Wasn't always though.
[58:47.000 --> 58:52.240]  I wonder if I'll get like my dad someday, just totally calm.
[58:52.240 --> 58:54.080]  I'm certainly not calm right now, man.
[58:54.080 --> 58:56.520]  All right, let me do this.
[58:56.520 --> 59:02.520]  We got Robert Barnes coming up, and we're going to cover the waterfront with him, and
[59:02.520 --> 59:08.520]  then I'm going to plow in third hour to this monstrosity.
[59:08.520 --> 59:15.920]  Senate kills GOP legislation to prohibit certain human animal hybrids, timeras, and that happened
[59:15.920 --> 59:20.320]  two weeks ago, two weeks ago tomorrow.
[59:20.320 --> 59:24.280]  And then right on time, they've got a Netflix show produced, of course, about human animal
[59:24.280 --> 59:27.800]  hybrids, and how cute they are, and how much we need to love them and take care of them,
[59:27.800 --> 59:33.040]  and you know, it's our fault that the earth has collapsed and all the humans have died,
[59:33.040 --> 59:37.400]  so now all that's left is animal human hybrids and a few people.
[59:37.400 --> 59:42.040]  The perfect show to sell them for the beginning is our babies that we've got to take care
[59:42.040 --> 59:50.120]  of when they are corporately produced humanoids that are going to be built and designed the
[59:50.120 --> 59:52.800]  way the globalists want.
[59:52.800 --> 59:57.360]  So this is one of the big issues, if you want to understand the future and how to stop the
[59:57.360 --> 1:00:04.480]  new world order, that I will break down for you coming up in the third hour today, and
[1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:08.120]  it ties into a whole host of other issues, but if you want tomorrow's news today, we
[1:00:08.120 --> 1:00:10.120]  will give it to you.
[1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:15.640]  And the whole Psyop of USA Today and other papers, putting a whole fake cover on them
[1:00:15.640 --> 1:00:22.120]  for the ad for the show and not telling people that it's not real, fake date, fake everything
[1:00:22.120 --> 1:00:31.560]  for last weekend, it says right around the cover that it's the fourth through the sixth,
[1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:37.040]  and people got their USA Today, and it says hybrid babies born across the US, world reacts
[1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:43.800]  to new generation of half humans, half animal children with both awe and concern, oh, it's
[1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:50.520]  never like is drag queen story time good or bad, we're just going to have it, or oh, we're
[1:00:50.520 --> 1:00:57.000]  running a fake news article to condition you that there are hybrids and that people react
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:02.480]  with awe but also concern, not like how did this happen, because it's really going on.
[1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:06.480]  But see now your brain will see that be tricked the first time that wow, as you read this,
[1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:11.120]  then it'll follow away as a joke that it's a movie, a TV show, so that later in your
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:15.680]  synapses, when the real animal human clones are rolled out, which is now happening, you'll
[1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:18.600]  just go oh, that's part of that show.
[1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:29.440]  You're being conditioned, you're being seduced, you're being prepared, yeah, I mean like China
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:34.560]  is already gene edited 86 people with CRISPR, oh yeah, you think they just they're the first
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:38.520]  to do it, it just happened.
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:44.320]  So this is their coming out, this is their revolution, like when you fire a starting
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:50.560]  gun for a swimmer's race or for a horse race or whatever, that's politically incorrect
[1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:55.600]  so now they don't fire a little cap gun, they have a bee, red light goes on and makes a
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:02:01.800]  microwave sound, because all traditions got to be gotten rid of because you know in tradition
[1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:05.400]  you'd know oh, it's in time when you start splicing humans with animals and that's when
[1:02:05.400 --> 1:02:07.400]  God comes back.
[1:02:07.400 --> 1:02:12.000]  The antichrist will create a one-role system with a casual society, oh, it's all here
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:16.800]  now, but now it's like oh well, the churches are like that's the old quaint Bible, sure
[1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:21.880]  it predicted it but we don't listen to it, we watch Netflix and we have our QR code that
[1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:26.840]  you scan to come to the church to prove you're vaccinated, it's of the Lord, major churches
[1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:34.960]  are saying take your shots, it's from Jesus, those same churches will be where you're implanted
[1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:38.680]  with your microchips, you won't be allowed in the church unless you have the chip clout
[1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:44.160]  swab set and major denominations are now saying, you know, the chip is not of the devil, in
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:47.960]  fact they're going to tell you Christ is on the earth soon and has returned and it's
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:53.520]  going to heal everyone, we just have to deny Jesus no, stay with us.
[1:02:53.520 --> 1:02:59.240]  I am blown away at how effective Info War is, I am humbled by how we're changing the
[1:02:59.240 --> 1:03:03.600]  world and it's important for you to really internalize the fact that you are the Info
[1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:09.120]  War, when you spread the word, when you financially support us, when you pray for us, you change
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:17.160]  history, you give my children and your children and our entire species a chance at the future
[1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:21.760]  instead of these evil, post humanist, exterminist globalist winning and we're giving them a
[1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:25.520]  run for their money right now so that's why I want to encourage everyone in the month
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:31.360]  of June 2021 to spread the word about Info Wars now more than ever, don't be ashamed
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:35.080]  of Info Wars, be proud of the fact that we have been in so many fights and that we've
[1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:39.560]  been so bruised and so scarred because those are the signs of our victories, the signs

[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:29.600]  War.
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:38.200]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen as we broadcast worldwide on this Monday, June 7th transmission.
[1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:41.760]  Here's the best thing I can do because I got started on the COVID World Government Takeover
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:45.520]  News and I've got all this other news, let me do this in this segment as we get Robert
[1:04:45.520 --> 1:04:49.400]  Barnes on the line, let me just run through headlines for you, I think that's probably
[1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:54.000]  the best thing to do here, I think this is all self-explanatory.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:01.440]  Genome sequencing almost certainly proves COVID was deliberately made in a lab US experts
[1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:08.520]  top scientists say, it's worse than we thought, Fauci and top US doctors caught, they conspired
[1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:13.720]  to disqualify hydroxychloroquine as a COVID treatment, millions died as a result so they
[1:05:13.720 --> 1:05:17.520]  could get their experimental vaccines approved because you can't approve experimental stuff
[1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:20.240]  if there's a known treatment.
[1:05:20.240 --> 1:05:24.800]  That even has any efficacy instead of like 100% like hydroxychloroquine and Rindesivir,
[1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:28.680]  they should all go to prison bare minimum for that.
[1:05:28.680 --> 1:05:35.120]  I mean that is evil, nurse, new video, this is coming up, Houston Hospital instructs
[1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:42.800]  employees not to list vaccine adverse reactions, cover up the death, we'll play that here in
[1:05:42.800 --> 1:05:43.800]  a few minutes.
[1:05:43.800 --> 1:05:52.960]  Dr. Jill, Dr. Fauci and Harlem greeted with a chorus of booze and chants, fire Fauci,
[1:05:52.960 --> 1:06:01.440]  but of course the biggest news of the day is that Dr. Fauci briefed world leaders on
[1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:11.560]  coronavirus and that it escaped from the Wuhan lab last spring over a year ago, wow.
[1:06:11.560 --> 1:06:20.400]  He briefed the head of the FDA and now the rat is leaving the sinking ship, Scott Gottlieb
[1:06:20.400 --> 1:06:26.240]  and remember Fauci lied about all that to Congress so they're having to come out and
[1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:29.800]  admit all of this.
[1:06:29.800 --> 1:06:34.680]  And oh, look who got banned, Naomi Wolf, one of the most respected liberal women bestselling
[1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:41.280]  author celebrated by the left, she said there's a lockdown, it's illegal, she says the worldwide
[1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:45.880]  COVID passport is a tyranny, she said it's dangerous, she said the vaccines are hurting
[1:06:45.880 --> 1:06:51.120]  people, she linked to evidence of that, she's been banned on Twitter after being warned
[1:06:51.120 --> 1:06:53.600]  not to talk about it.
[1:06:53.600 --> 1:07:00.760]  In fact, one of the times she got suspended a few months ago was because she talked about
[1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:05.160]  it being made in a lab, well now we know it was and we know they covered it up, but that's
[1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:10.240]  one of the suspensions, well, she was suspended the third time, bye-bye, you're banned, Naomi
[1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:15.160]  Wolf, with all her platforms and TV shows, she built up her Twitter following, brought
[1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:19.960]  them the advertising and now they just took it away because she was exposing the criminal
[1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:23.960]  activity.
[1:07:23.960 --> 1:07:27.280]  Scientists who told Fauci COVID potentially engineered the leach Twitter account of being
[1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:29.840]  paid millions of dollars by Fauci.
[1:07:29.840 --> 1:07:37.160]  Video, Rand Paul says he's getting daily death threats for questioning Fauci, Malaysian police
[1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:41.800]  use heat drones to check temperatures from above, oh the robot says you're guilty of
[1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:46.760]  being hot, well now we're going to disappear you, yet another scientific study concludes
[1:07:46.760 --> 1:07:58.040]  COVID is likely lab engineered and it goes on from there, now let's add this to the
[1:07:58.040 --> 1:08:07.360]  pile, dating apps allow users to reject the unvaccinated, since when do you put your medical
[1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:12.040]  status out in the world, since when can companies demand it, since when can your boss say you've
[1:08:12.040 --> 1:08:16.920]  got to have it, since when does HIPAA go out the window, since when is implied consent gone
[1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:22.120]  in the UK and Canada and now in California, they're giving children vaccines out of ice
[1:08:22.120 --> 1:08:26.120]  cream trucks, we have video without parental consent and lawyers are delivering them cease
[1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:31.640]  and desist saying who are you, some guy with a mask on, see that's the symbol of the takeover,
[1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:37.680]  masked men with a secret so-called vaccine that's really a drug and nurses saying everywhere
[1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:43.680]  there's massive cover-ups taking place, we'll get to that next segment with Robert Marnes
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:48.760]  and we're also going to look at Trump's cryptic statements about Biden will be out of the
[1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:53.120]  White House sooner than you think with all the election fraud news coming out, Trump
[1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:57.600]  saying it's been a coup, who's running things, Biden's a puppet, that's strong signals
[1:08:57.600 --> 1:09:03.840]  from Trump, Trump now signaling and telling people he may run for Congress and then get
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:07.800]  into the House of Representatives that would have a majority, if he leads that move to
[1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:14.600]  get other conservative Trumpites elected, he would then be the speaker in a year and
[1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:18.960]  a half, there's major discussion of that, I mean this is quite a time to be alive,
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:25.360]  we'll cover that with Robert Marnes coming up next segment but this is just an amazing
[1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:29.720]  time to be alive and after he leaves this I'm going to get into the legalization of
[1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:34.640]  cloning and animal human creations and the real implications of that and of course the
[1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:40.960]  subsequent TV shows and full page ads telling you just accept clones on the streets, accept
[1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:46.040]  splice humans and animals, this is the real agenda, this is the transhumanist revolution
[1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:50.760]  and now the transhumanists are saying that, this is our revolution, type in transhumanists
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:56.000]  say our revolution is here and so the biggest circulation paper in the US on the cover said
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:01.320]  hybrid babies born across the US, world reacts to new generation of half human, half animal
[1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:07.800]  children with both all in concern, the minute I saw that I said it's fake news, it's the
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:13.600]  condition you accept it and it's a fake news stunt and of course it was to promote a TV
[1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:18.840]  show, the minute I saw it before I went out and got one, which I forgot and left at home,
[1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:23.240]  some USA Todays are still on the shelves, asked my assistant or somebody to get me an actual
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:27.400]  copy of that USA Today, some hotels around here will still have one as well, the weekend
[1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:33.440]  edition, so this is a mass move, I told you when they legalized human animal cloning two
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:38.840]  weeks ago in the Senate by not prohibiting, they said it's already going on, that now
[1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:45.160]  that's the real damn breaking and now it's full page headlines that you will accept the
[1:10:45.160 --> 1:10:50.600]  clones, which is corporations allowed to make artificial life on the earth and then give
[1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:59.400]  it rights, just like big tech gets governmental power, spies on you for the government and
[1:10:59.400 --> 1:11:04.240]  the government senses out it's illegal spying by having you sign a waiver, but still they
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:06.960]  give all the data to the government and at the behest of the government suppress the
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:10.760]  people, which makes it totally illegal and finally people are listening to me, Senator
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:14.440]  Ted Cruz came out and said, the way to attack this is how they're illegally surveilling
[1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:18.760]  their users, how they're live time censoring them and how they're doing it at the direction
[1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:24.160]  of federal agencies that haven't even been authorized by law to do so.
[1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:32.440]  This is out, there's a thousand ways to skin this cat, instead of section 230, obsession.
[1:11:32.440 --> 1:11:37.080]  Robert Barnes will give us his take on that as well when we come back, now this is the
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:40.560]  last day, everybody's been busy, a lot of stuff's going on, we've not come out with
[1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:45.120]  new ads or promos or banners for the new product we just came out with and I'm very excited
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:53.240]  about vitamin D3 and zinc, highest quality gummies for adults and for children, a whole
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:12:01.480]  food multivitamin, meaning it's totally from the concentrate of vegetables and of other
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:07.800]  plants, very strong, very powerful, very high end, that is in brand new product and of course
[1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:12.320]  vitamin C and zinc with rose hips, all of this for just for your life, for skin, your
[1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:15.760]  eyes, your body, everything you need, it's all essential.
[1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:19.320]  This is all great with our regular multivitamin, vitamin refusion, but this is if you want
[1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:26.560]  to boost and go even above that, this is high end at low price, okay, high end at low price,
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:30.480]  as most folks mark these up four or five times, the way we have it marked up, we can never
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:36.840]  do 50% off on these, 25% out of the gates, get all three together, 40% off and that's
[1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:40.720]  introductory, infowarstore.com, now there's kind of a sweet spot right now because we
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:44.920]  haven't gotten the ads up yet for that, you can still see that the old thing from this
[1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:48.400]  weekend and I asked the guys and I love them, I said, please have the new banners for Monday,

[1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:36.920]  You now take you to the front lines of the information war on your host Alex Jones
[1:16:36.920 --> 1:16:43.040]  this is the big takeaway we want to turn this around and stop this we have to
[1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:46.720]  recognize what the globalists are doing we have to recognize as a transhumanist
[1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:51.800]  revolution happening that'll set them up to totally control the planet and we
[1:16:51.800 --> 1:16:56.480]  have to realize that from the beginning they've used a artificially
[1:16:56.480 --> 1:17:01.480]  created virus and exaggerated claims and fear and suppression of hundred percent
[1:17:01.480 --> 1:17:06.040]  remedies and treatments like hydroxychloroquine, Rindesivir and aerosolized
[1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:11.080]  steroid inhalers and other things and it's all been an exercise in censorship
[1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:16.480]  and fraud and control and I have all the articles right here we'll go over where
[1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:20.120]  mainline science says yes we're gonna start cloning humans we're gonna start
[1:17:20.120 --> 1:17:25.480]  having genetically engineered babies China's already doing it and that they're
[1:17:25.480 --> 1:17:29.520]  sweeping away all the old checks and balances but those laws are still there
[1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:33.080]  you can't give children that are 12 years old in San Francisco to playground
[1:17:33.080 --> 1:17:37.240]  injection without their parents knowing that is total Nuremberg violation that
[1:17:37.240 --> 1:17:43.680]  is like punishable by serious serious prison time okay I mean and they're all
[1:17:43.680 --> 1:17:48.320]  they're all using drug dealer tactics at the playgrounds all over the world I
[1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:53.360]  mean this is this is the takeover this is the precedent-setting event and I
[1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:56.760]  wanted to get Robert Barnes on a very smart fellow historian really a
[1:17:56.760 --> 1:18:00.520]  constitutional lawyer follow a lot of suits against what's happening he tells
[1:18:00.520 --> 1:18:04.320]  the latest on the struggle against this but what do you make just in general of
[1:18:04.320 --> 1:18:09.080]  as I said a month ago's I had sources that that the major whistleblowers will
[1:18:09.080 --> 1:18:12.160]  be the heads of agencies who don't want to go to prison that's how bad this is
[1:18:12.160 --> 1:18:16.520]  that former head of the FDA who was FDA head last year Gottlieb saying fouchy
[1:18:16.520 --> 1:18:19.560]  briefs and that it didn't come out of the lab I mean just the level of that
[1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:24.320]  one story alone and then nurses confirming and showing documents that
[1:18:24.320 --> 1:18:27.640]  they've been ordered to not say vaccines are hurting and killing people and we've
[1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:32.000]  got a real criminal conspiracy from the UN from Fauci and Gates that set up
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:36.800]  world policy and big tech censorship working with them and government to
[1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:42.400]  suppress everybody I mean it is a total criminal conspiracy this is open and
[1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:46.120]  shut the dumbest jury would convict them Robert Barnes what would you call
[1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:50.840]  this this time we're in right here I just can't believe it well I mean what's
[1:18:50.840 --> 1:18:54.040]  sort of unexpected is that they got caught I mean the what you were talking
[1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:59.800]  about a year ago and you know at Francis Boyle Evans has been talking about for
[1:18:59.800 --> 1:19:04.560]  a year has been that this is a lab-created virus that had had the
[1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:08.880]  early early indicia of being a lab-created virus everything about it
[1:19:08.880 --> 1:19:13.520]  spoke to that and a look at who profited from this I mean not only the China
[1:19:13.520 --> 1:19:18.640]  profit by being able to get rid of Trump that was only possible because of
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:23.160]  this pandemic virus but on top of that they were able to economically profit
[1:19:23.160 --> 1:19:27.240]  the only country that grew dramatically economically in the last year was China
[1:19:27.240 --> 1:19:32.240]  and China profited immensely now they weren't the only ones because big tech
[1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:36.920]  also profited immensely so you follow the money and it tracks back to the
[1:19:36.920 --> 1:19:42.040]  drug makers it tracks back to Bill Gates connected people it tracks back to
[1:19:42.040 --> 1:19:47.160]  big tech and attracts back to China so it shouldn't come as a full surprise though
[1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:51.320]  it is still shocking that it's actually coming out in the public record that you
[1:19:51.320 --> 1:19:56.760]  have that this was an open conspiracy I mean from the moment that Fauci knew he
[1:19:56.760 --> 1:20:00.720]  this was going to become public he engaged in a year-long conspiracy to
[1:20:00.720 --> 1:20:04.760]  suppress the information and the only reason why he was successfully suppressed
[1:20:04.760 --> 1:20:09.160]  for the length of time that it was was because of big tech censorship I mean
[1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:13.720]  the one the only person talking about this early on was you that was it and
[1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:17.200]  that's why the reason why they went to great lengths to suppress people's
[1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:22.480]  access to information and to smear the reputation of you and info wars is so
[1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:26.000]  that people wouldn't pay attention to what was clear from the get-go but the
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:29.200]  people who listen to the institutional media for the last year have been lied
[1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:33.940]  to and even Thomas Frank a liberal writing in the Guardian a liberal
[1:20:33.940 --> 1:20:38.560]  publication wrote last week that if this is true it completely takes apart
[1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:43.240]  everything he believes about institutional confidence and trust but
[1:20:43.240 --> 1:20:47.120]  that's what happened what would this was an extensive expansive conspiracy to
[1:20:47.120 --> 1:20:51.760]  create a bio weapon to use that bio weapon for politicized purposes to
[1:20:51.760 --> 1:20:55.880]  enrich a small group of people to empower China at the expense of the rest of
[1:20:55.880 --> 1:21:00.080]  the world and to take out Trump and you know some of us told Trump back then that
[1:21:00.080 --> 1:21:04.960]  if Trump had pursued this when we told him to pursue it Trump would still be in
[1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:10.240]  the White House today sure we both told him but without bragging we we we
[1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:14.080]  both advised Trump on this and he would agree but never did anything with it
[1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:17.680]  because his advisors were telling we were wrong but but now he knows that so
[1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:20.320]  let's expand on that we'll get into Trump later because he's starting to get
[1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:23.760]  that now and if he does get that it goes public with it that will destroy them
[1:21:23.760 --> 1:21:28.000]  so he still holds the cards like the phoenix arrives from the ashes but what
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:31.040]  do you think they're gonna do now because if you have the heads of federal
[1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:35.880]  agencies Redfield and now Gottlieb saying no Fauci knew and basically he
[1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:39.680]  covered it up they're they're scared they are blowing the whistle on
[1:21:39.680 --> 1:21:44.120]  themselves hoping they don't get indicted I mean you you're a big criminal
[1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:48.820]  lawyer as well am I reading the tea leaves wrong here no I think what
[1:21:48.820 --> 1:21:53.600]  happened is because of the extensive FOIA request that they knew that Fauci was
[1:21:53.600 --> 1:21:57.520]  gonna get outed and so everybody who could be implicated started running for
[1:21:57.520 --> 1:22:01.960]  cover I think they started this off of these email leaks as a cover-up campaign
[1:22:01.960 --> 1:22:06.400]  to see as sort of a soft balloon to see how people would respond and
[1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:10.360]  unfortunately Fauci is dead in the water for them they thought maybe they could
[1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:14.000]  survive this Fauci could survive this he can't and so you're starting to see
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:18.560]  people people pile on other scientists who signed on to that bogus letter that
[1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:21.560]  intimidated people from investigating this more and more of them are
[1:22:21.560 --> 1:22:25.120]  retracting their signature others are trying to hide the paper trail they're
[1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:27.800]  leaving their entire Twitter account well that's because the head of the
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:32.680]  Wuhan lab project for Fauci is the one that wrote the damn paper absolutely and
[1:22:32.680 --> 1:22:36.040]  this is something you've been talking about for better part of a year for the
[1:22:36.040 --> 1:22:39.480]  very beginning it was clear that these people were in cover-up mode but the
[1:22:39.480 --> 1:22:43.160]  institutional media went along with it the powerful institutions went along
[1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:47.160]  with it and what they did is they now are self-discredited and anybody
[1:22:47.160 --> 1:22:51.040]  connected to Fauci are connected to this scandal needs to come clean sooner
[1:22:51.040 --> 1:22:54.600]  rather than later or they don't have any credibility or reputational integrity
[1:22:54.600 --> 1:22:59.960]  yet left now if I were Fauci I would be looking for some nice condos in Rio
[1:22:59.960 --> 1:23:03.320]  right about now you know I'd be looking for countries that don't have extradition
[1:23:03.320 --> 1:23:07.200]  treaties because that'd be the smart move now whether our government ever has
[1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:11.520]  the courage to put people like Fauci behind bars is still a very open question
[1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:16.040]  but there's no doubt what the email trail proves is a criminal cover-up to
[1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:20.040]  cover up a worse criminal conspiracy underneath it which this all goes back
[1:23:20.040 --> 1:23:24.160]  to something you've been talking about now for many years which is the illicit
[1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:29.560]  funding by Fauci and other people of these gain-of-function biosafety labs
[1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:33.520]  that's not only biosafety it's bioterrorism that that's where all this
[1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:37.280]  comes from and if people been paying attention or you were talking about six
[1:23:37.280 --> 1:23:41.160]  years ago we might never have been here because that's when this funding was
[1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:44.200]  taking place that's when these bad acts were first put in motion and by the way
[1:23:44.200 --> 1:23:49.600]  not to toot our horn but I had Francis Boyle on 15 years ago warning when I
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:53.120]  remember George Herbert Walker Bush started the stuff of his son expanded it
[1:23:53.120 --> 1:23:57.840]  then Obama expanded it all these level four bio weapons labs all over the
[1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:02.240]  United States that are doing like serious weapons development under the
[1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:06.000]  guise of quote finding cares what they're making new diseases to find a
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:10.640]  cure for exactly what it was is most of America still didn't know about the
[1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:13.880]  info wars audience knew about it but most Americans didn't know about it so
[1:24:13.880 --> 1:24:17.880]  most of them are now shocked to discover this research even exists and that that
[1:24:17.880 --> 1:24:20.960]  we were funding it that we were supporting it that we were laundering it
[1:24:20.960 --> 1:24:26.240]  through NGOs to the Wuhan Institute of Virology because the Wuhan Institute of
[1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:30.240]  Virology just let it out of the bag so it's a big wake-up call to America what's
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:34.160]  going on and I think people that have the best intentions are trying to use this
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:38.960]  case to draw attention to how dangerous this government activity is absolutely
[1:24:38.960 --> 1:24:42.640]  let's talk about all the force inoculation talk we see and what the
[1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:46.520]  legal parameters of that are how we legally stand up and say no to this
[1:24:46.520 --> 1:24:56.240]  biological big tech big pharma rape granny do right granny do right thanks

[1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:30.240]  just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started taking it me
[1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:34.400]  doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time I started

[1:28:12.600 --> 1:28:19.400]  we are certainly riders on the storm into this world we're born until this
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:26.040]  house were thrown and there is a complete revolution taking place of
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:30.320]  election fraud of corporate governance of all of that's the whole COVID lockdown
[1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:34.320]  was was corporations worldwide ordering their employees to stay home then
[1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:38.200]  governments followed suit and all of it based on the giant exaggerated epic lie
[1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:42.040]  Robert Barnes great constitutional lawyer the smartest guys I know joins us
[1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:48.560]  to cover the waterfront Robert I want to get back into all of the attempts to
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:51.120]  inoculate children without parental consent that's actually taking place
[1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:56.880]  just this mass criminal movement happening and the actions you and others
[1:28:56.880 --> 1:29:01.640]  are involved in getting lawyers to serve these ice cream trucks injecting
[1:29:01.640 --> 1:29:05.840]  children and and and all the any schools doing without parental consent to let
[1:29:05.840 --> 1:29:13.000]  them know that they're on notice of their criminal activity but again analyze
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:17.840]  this for us and what you think the general public can do to say no to this
[1:29:17.840 --> 1:29:21.480]  not just individually to their employers and others but explain to others how
[1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:25.920]  important it is to stand up against this and say no well I mean basically we're
[1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:29.960]  back to the 1920s all over again we're back to human experimentation in the
[1:29:29.960 --> 1:29:33.480]  open in the public while different forms of that experimentation has been
[1:29:33.480 --> 1:29:39.560]  taking place in secret for decades this open overt nature of it is something
[1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:44.880]  that the governments claim not to be doing since the Nuremberg code of 1947
[1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:49.200]  was put in after the Nazi experimentation was outed to the world and the
[1:29:49.200 --> 1:29:53.520]  Nuremberg code of 1947 is very clear that nobody can be the subject of human
[1:29:53.520 --> 1:29:59.760]  experimentation that someone without informed consent and that Nuremberg code
[1:29:59.760 --> 1:30:05.200]  of 1947 is recognized as part of American law multiple courts have said
[1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:10.440]  that Nuremberg code of 1947 is governing guiding law that enforces
[1:30:10.440 --> 1:30:14.400]  constitutional rights in the United States this not only includes the right
[1:30:14.400 --> 1:30:19.360]  to privacy but the right to informed consent the right to decide what goes
[1:30:19.360 --> 1:30:23.840]  in your body before the government can force it or coerce it or inject it into
[1:30:23.840 --> 1:30:27.280]  you now they've been that they have violated that routinely over the many
[1:30:27.280 --> 1:30:31.800]  decades I mean people forget what happened in 1957 in San Francisco where
[1:30:31.800 --> 1:30:35.720]  they were experimenting over this the city dumping chemicals killed one person
[1:30:35.720 --> 1:30:40.200]  lied about it for decades after that then of course we had MK ultra all the way
[1:30:40.200 --> 1:30:44.720]  through the 60s and 70s which also which included injecting LSD giving people
[1:30:44.720 --> 1:30:48.920]  LSD unwittingly and unknowingly following up the mustard gas experiments of
[1:30:48.920 --> 1:30:52.360]  World War one other experiments of World War two this was all supposed to be
[1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:57.000]  illegal but they were doing it anyway one of those early MK ultra individuals
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:01.160]  that was subject to mental psychological torture at a vulnerable age would go on
[1:31:01.160 --> 1:31:04.880]  to be Ted Kaczynski the unabomber so there's been this and then they went to
[1:31:04.880 --> 1:31:07.720]  great lengths to cover that up at his criminal trial having his criminal
[1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:12.400]  defense counsel compromised by trying to undermine him rather than expose this to
[1:31:12.400 --> 1:31:15.320]  the world and thus he cut a plea deal rather than go through the public
[1:31:15.320 --> 1:31:18.720]  exposure of trial of what how the government was implicated in that event
[1:31:18.720 --> 1:31:23.040]  and then and there's been variations of that you know cancer treatment a wide
[1:31:23.040 --> 1:31:26.640]  range of things where they've used human beings as guinea pigs but it's not
[1:31:26.640 --> 1:31:30.360]  supposed to be legal it's not supposed to be constitutional indeed the
[1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:35.080]  emergency use authorization statute governing vaccines specifically codifies
[1:31:35.080 --> 1:31:39.120]  this principle in the statute itself and there were two components about that
[1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:42.880]  and this is another one that's also worth exploring now emergency youth
[1:31:42.880 --> 1:31:47.000]  authorized vaccine cannot be compelled without informed consent period that's
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:50.560]  written right into federal law but the other part is an emergency use
[1:31:50.560 --> 1:31:55.360]  authorized vaccine cannot even happen if there's alternative therapeutics that
[1:31:55.360 --> 1:32:00.280]  may work they have to rule those out well Brett Weinstein the the great
[1:32:00.280 --> 1:32:05.600]  scientist on his dark oars podcast had some prominent doctors going through the
[1:32:05.600 --> 1:32:10.480]  various therapeutics that may have in fact be equally effective alternatives
[1:32:10.480 --> 1:32:15.200]  to the vaccine and that this information was suppressed information concerning
[1:32:15.200 --> 1:32:19.000]  it was suppressed people who talked about it and discussed it were black
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  listed in blackballed in the same way and we now have the emails of Fauci saying
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:27.720]  let's suppress these treatments so we get emergency authorization I mean that
[1:32:27.720 --> 1:32:32.280]  right there is a long prison sentence that's illegal as hell completely I
[1:32:32.280 --> 1:32:35.160]  mean this goes back to the core principle of informed consent that the
[1:32:35.160 --> 1:32:39.120]  Nuremberg code was designed to do the words that came out of Nuremberg were
[1:32:39.120 --> 1:32:45.320]  never again and yet we're right back here with Nazi style human experimentation
[1:32:45.320 --> 1:32:50.720]  treating even kids as guinea pig now one of the leaders if there's anybody out
[1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:56.880]  there that has a concern about a child anyone under 18 with a vaccine with some
[1:32:56.880 --> 1:33:00.640]  attempt to force it upon them to give it to them without informed consent or
[1:33:00.640 --> 1:33:04.600]  anything like that the leading legal organization in the nation and the
[1:33:04.600 --> 1:33:08.440]  leading legal organization frankly in the world on this is children's health
[1:33:08.440 --> 1:33:12.760]  defense Bobby Kennedy juniors the leader of it he's bringing suit in the
[1:33:12.760 --> 1:33:16.960]  District of Columbia because the District of Columbia tried to pass a law to
[1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:22.640]  authorize the forced vaccines COVID vaccines on kids without any informed
[1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:26.520]  consent I mean and this goes with judges who are trying to do there's a judge in
[1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:30.320]  Texas who's that well you know what some of the judges like well although
[1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:33.680]  there's a judge in here there's a judge outside Houston ordered both parents to
[1:33:33.680 --> 1:33:38.200]  take it or they take the child away completely which is a complete misuse
[1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:43.960]  and abuse of the authority of a judge a of the parental rights to govern what a
[1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:48.120]  child gets and what a parent gets is governed by the Constitution of the
[1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:52.200]  United States and let's be clear if it was a authorized tested vaccine it would
[1:33:52.200 --> 1:33:57.000]  still be illegal out of control this is a gene therapy this is literally a hundred
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:00.360]  percent violation of the Nuremberg code it's the same thing in Europe the US
[1:34:00.360 --> 1:34:05.880]  Canada this is all being called by the UN they're calling the shots and then
[1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:10.520]  when Naomi Wolfer me or you or anybody goes on the internet and challenges this
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:15.680]  we get censored that's even more criminal oh exactly same with Bobby Kennedy
[1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:19.120]  kicked off of Instagram for simply reporting with the government's own
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:24.360]  database the VA ERS database was reporting and people can go and look at
[1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:28.840]  that as part of informed consent if you look at you should be informed I'm all
[1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:32.400]  for people making it their own decision you like the vaccine take it you don't
[1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:35.800]  like it you should have the right to say no this is your right this is your
[1:34:35.800 --> 1:34:39.600]  choice not my prerogative not the government's prerogative and if you look
[1:34:39.600 --> 1:34:43.520]  at what's being reported we're seeing record levels of reporting but for people
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:48.280]  don't know the VA ERS reporting system if you lie to it it's a federal crime so
[1:34:48.280 --> 1:34:52.000]  people aren't gonna just make up stories in fact they estimate that there are 10
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:56.880]  times more incidents per vaccine than are ever reported in the VA ERS that's
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:00.880]  a very conservative number some estimates are 100 yeah some leftists put up an
[1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:04.000]  incredible halt statement to try to discredit it well just because they fall
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.680]  to false report doesn't mean that it's one of the most credible reporting
[1:35:06.680 --> 1:35:09.480]  systems out there and what do you make of nurses and doctors coming forward
[1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:14.000]  showing the documents where they're being told suppress this so the hospital
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:18.960]  administrators are going along with the crime to suppress it well and if you
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:22.120]  are a nurse or doctor wouldn't you you just saw the last year one of the
[1:35:22.120 --> 1:35:25.800]  biggest cover-ups get almost every nurse and doctor in the country and
[1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:29.680]  scientist in the world shut their mouths about what was obvious to everybody
[1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:34.720]  with the head study that's my next question it's just like Mark Twain said
[1:35:34.720 --> 1:35:37.880]  a lie goes halfway around the world before the truth puts his pants on but
[1:35:37.880 --> 1:35:41.960]  once the truth puts his pants on it starts kicking some ass here we are the
[1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:45.920]  wheels are coming off what do you expect to happen next because the big bold
[1:35:45.920 --> 1:35:50.520]  megalomaniac takeover plan we got big tech we can censor them we'll make
[1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:54.720]  trillions we'll have a world ID we'll have a global social credit score this is
[1:35:54.720 --> 1:35:59.200]  our plan great reset they write books bragging how they did it on purpose to
[1:35:59.200 --> 1:36:03.160]  save the earth from evil humans and now everyone's waking up and resisting them
[1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:06.080]  and the center shifts not working Robert Barnes what do you what do they pull
[1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:10.680]  next I mean I think they're gonna continue to accelerate I think the I
[1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:14.760]  think some of the people that are complicit in these actions were people
[1:36:14.760 --> 1:36:18.680]  who intended to do another variant in another virus because this worked really
[1:36:18.680 --> 1:36:23.040]  well for the until now they got mass compliance around the world almost every
[1:36:23.040 --> 1:36:27.840]  government capitulated almost every person capitulated all kinds of people
[1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:31.480]  forfeited their rights eagerly and so when they saw this this was more
[1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:34.840]  successful than the Cold War more successful than any war we've ever
[1:36:34.840 --> 1:36:38.640]  fought more successful than the crime way and getting people to completely be
[1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:43.120]  docile to the government and now more and more people are waking up and I
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:48.480]  think their their desire to do a second wave a second the sequel COVID-19 the
[1:36:48.480 --> 1:36:52.920]  sequel I think is now had they have to put the brakes on that and you're seeing
[1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:56.120]  more and more information come out about Bill Gates more and more information
[1:36:56.120 --> 1:36:59.080]  come out about Fauci and and more and more information come out about the
[1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:02.640]  Chinese Communist Party and these were the and more and more information come
[1:37:02.640 --> 1:37:07.000]  out about big tech and these were the four architects the four horsemen of the
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:11.960]  COVID-19 public policy disaster in debacle and Trump is as you mentioned
[1:37:11.960 --> 1:37:16.360]  is now also starting to fight back in ways that he wanted to but held back on
[1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:20.120]  last year because he's getting better advice now so I think that the the
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:24.760]  people are waking up and as always the people's public consciousness is the
[1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:30.360]  greatest tool to resist evil of any kind I one trillion percent agree when we
[1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:34.240]  come back let's get into Trump and how him using this information to bring down
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:38.080]  the deep state is is a must and then what you make of his statements about
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:43.280]  Biden will be gone soon and the recounts and everything coming up whoo one
[1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:48.080]  hell of a time to be alive I'm Alex Jones Robert Barnes with us straight ahead
[1:37:48.200 --> 1:37:52.920]  there are now over a hundred peer-reviewed studies in just the last
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:58.280]  year documenting that surgical masks do nothing to stop the transmission and the
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:03.040]  spread of viruses it's a hoax it's a fraud here's another article on info
[1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:08.520]  wars.com a major German study showing exactly the same thing but Fauci knew
[1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:14.880]  that he wrote a study himself his name is on it in 2008 saying not only do masks
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:20.880]  not work but most of the deaths of the Spanish flu back in 1917 1918 were
[1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:25.040]  caused for people wearing masks and it breeding bacterial pneumonia in their
[1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:29.960]  filthy diapers many people dying have died of bacterial pneumonia and they call
[1:38:29.960 --> 1:38:34.200]  it COVID-19 and the criminal Fauci and others knew it all that's why it's more

[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:53.160]  Go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[1:39:53.160 --> 1:39:54.160]  Hey, Alex.
[1:39:54.160 --> 1:39:55.160]  Welcome.
[1:39:55.160 --> 1:39:58.480]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all
[1:39:58.480 --> 1:39:59.480]  this stupidity.
[1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:02.920]  I wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:09.640]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:11.120]  Living defense saved my life.
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:15.440]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:16.880]  Living defense brought me back.
[1:40:16.880 --> 1:40:22.600]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:29.600]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:36.320]  you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake, and then shall many be offended
[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:39.720]  and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:41.440]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[1:40:41.440 --> 1:40:45.880]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[1:40:45.880 --> 1:40:50.440]  and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[1:40:50.440 --> 1:40:54.800]  I'm shooting this quick news alert on Friday, June 4th, 2021.
[1:40:54.800 --> 1:40:57.120]  You see this report from over a month ago?
[1:40:57.120 --> 1:41:01.600]  It's just now starting to break in the mainstream news as whistleblowers go public, but we broke
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:05.040]  it first and it's a banned off video with one million plus views.
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:07.640]  We've reposted it at the front page of infowars.com.
[1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:13.200]  The project manager for Fauci bragged in an interview a year and a half ago how they created
[1:41:13.200 --> 1:41:14.200]  COVID-19.
[1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:18.640]  And then he secretly wrote the Lancet report claiming that it was naturally occurring.
[1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:22.880]  And then Big Tech worked with him to engage in fraud and sensitive American people.
[1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:27.680]  We're on air right now today and this week in covering it all at infowars.com, port slash

[1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:57.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:57.640 --> 1:42:14.640]  Let's get it started.
[1:42:14.640 --> 1:42:19.880]  The global government, the Chi-Kong alliance was in trouble.
[1:42:19.880 --> 1:42:20.880]  Trump was winning.
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:21.880]  We were winning.
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:24.120]  So they launched the big health scare.
[1:42:24.120 --> 1:42:28.360]  But now it's unraveling and they've got to get in trouble for what they've done.
[1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:33.960]  Big articles that are breaking at infowars.com, Trump just came out and said he would seriously
[1:42:33.960 --> 1:42:39.200]  consider the status for his running mate in 2024.
[1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:44.080]  Also Trump connected individuals have been saying that he is seriously considering running
[1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:45.560]  for the House of Representatives.
[1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:49.480]  They look like they can retake the House, which looks clear is going to happen.
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:52.680]  Anybody Trump endorses is winning.
[1:42:52.680 --> 1:42:57.800]  He would then be voted in as the Speaker of the House, pretty much as important and powerful
[1:42:57.800 --> 1:42:58.800]  as the President.
[1:42:58.800 --> 1:43:00.560]  He's got a strong leader.
[1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:04.600]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, and also he's been a Trump advisor, is here with
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:09.840]  us to give us his take on Trump land and him taking the gloves off with Fauci, Bill Gates,
[1:43:09.840 --> 1:43:11.840]  and more.
[1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:14.640]  What would you advise the President to do and what do you think he's really up to right
[1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:15.640]  now?
[1:43:15.640 --> 1:43:20.480]  Well, I think the biggest thing is he now realizes even more so.
[1:43:20.480 --> 1:43:24.560]  He's realized this at different stages, but that the advice he'd been getting while he
[1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:27.680]  was in the White House was almost all bad advice.
[1:43:27.680 --> 1:43:30.120]  He got bad advice about how to handle the elections.
[1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:34.440]  He got bad advice about how to handle the lockdown and he got bad advice about how to
[1:43:34.440 --> 1:43:38.640]  handle the COVID-19 lab leak source.
[1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:44.920]  His initial instincts, we were on about a year ago where he publicly retweeted my comments
[1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:48.720]  that he wasn't going to go along with the Fauci plan, wasn't going to go along with
[1:43:48.720 --> 1:43:57.760]  the lockdowns, was going to expose the Chinese Communist Party source of this virus and pandemic
[1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:00.520]  and he got talked out of it by a bunch of bad advisors.
[1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:05.120]  I think the biggest development in all of this is Trump is now clearly waking up to
[1:44:05.120 --> 1:44:10.840]  how many bad advisors he had and that he regrets not listening to those of us who were giving
[1:44:10.840 --> 1:44:15.000]  him the good advice and he regrets listening to those who gave him bad advice.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:21.480]  The best thing for Trump moving forward is to fully appreciate who gave him good information
[1:44:21.480 --> 1:44:23.680]  and who gave him bad information.
[1:44:23.680 --> 1:44:29.320]  I hope he starts the process of purging Trump world of bad sources and not rely on those
[1:44:29.320 --> 1:44:35.320]  sources anymore because those sources told him to stay quiet about the lab leak source.
[1:44:35.320 --> 1:44:38.440]  Those sources told him to go along with the lockdowns.
[1:44:38.440 --> 1:44:43.360]  Those sources told him to take a different kind of tactic on the elections than the one
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:48.120]  that he needed to take so I think he is and you're seeing that reflected in his speech.
[1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:54.200]  He's being more and more critical of Fauci, more and more critical of the Chinese and
[1:44:54.200 --> 1:44:58.600]  their involvement in all of this and the Chinese Communist Party and you're seeing him demand
[1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:00.720]  reparations from CCP.
[1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:03.160]  You're seeing him demand remedy in that respect.
[1:45:03.160 --> 1:45:04.160]  You're seeing him expose.
[1:45:04.160 --> 1:45:05.160]  Absolutely.
[1:45:05.160 --> 1:45:06.160]  Let me ask you this.
[1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:07.160]  What do you make of a presidential run?
[1:45:07.160 --> 1:45:08.160]  More and more.
[1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:09.160]  It looks like he is going to do it.
[1:45:09.160 --> 1:45:10.160]  He's lost a lot of weight.
[1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:12.080]  He's gotten his energy back and the word is he's been saying.
[1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:14.120]  I probably will run if my health is good.
[1:45:14.120 --> 1:45:15.880]  I think Trump's being truthful.
[1:45:15.880 --> 1:45:19.080]  That means they're going to try to indict him obviously in New York City or in New York
[1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:22.120]  state with that Spencer attack they've got going.
[1:45:22.120 --> 1:45:25.160]  What's your intel on that?
[1:45:25.160 --> 1:45:29.840]  So it's high risk gamble for them to try to bring a prosecution against them in New York.
[1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:34.560]  It's one thing to keep them under the, there is no, I mean, I do a whole lot of tax cases.
[1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:39.480]  So there's no chance of them securing a conviction even with the New York jury trial in New York
[1:45:39.480 --> 1:45:41.440]  and that will only make Trump look stronger.
[1:45:41.440 --> 1:45:46.160]  I mean, the, he has full reliance defense, full good faith defense, all of his returns
[1:45:46.160 --> 1:45:49.160]  were done by accounting professionals and legal professionals.
[1:45:49.160 --> 1:45:51.760]  They're all consistent with the way real estate law works.
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:54.080]  So there's just no legal claim there at all.
[1:45:54.080 --> 1:45:59.040]  So if they bring a bogus indictment, a made up fictitious indictment on those grounds,
[1:45:59.040 --> 1:46:01.120]  they're just going to get embarrassed and humiliated.
[1:46:01.120 --> 1:46:03.440]  But they did that twice with the fake impeachments.
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:07.280]  That's the problem is if you, if you look at their past activity, the word is they,
[1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:10.240]  they are intending to indict him.
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:14.160]  I think that they're trying to say they are, but I'll believe that when I see it because
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:18.400]  it's big, particularly on the tax charges, a big gamble, they could try to bring state
[1:46:18.400 --> 1:46:22.680]  charges on, on tax charges, but the same defense has all applied.
[1:46:22.680 --> 1:46:26.480]  So I know the people of the tax division, there's almost no chance though, green light
[1:46:26.480 --> 1:46:30.080]  this case because it's gotten, we know, we know the lower level folks are saying there's
[1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:35.160]  no case, but the idiot, Leticia James and others that, you know, that they want to,
[1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:39.000]  well, Leticia James wants to be well known, wants to be well loved, wants to be a future
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:40.240]  governor.
[1:46:40.240 --> 1:46:45.120]  That's why she's partially behind taking out Cuomo and leaking all the stories about Cuomo,
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:47.320]  but she's also generally risk averse.
[1:46:47.320 --> 1:46:51.880]  If you look at her history, she talks big, but name the big parties she's actually indicted.
[1:46:51.880 --> 1:46:54.040]  She hasn't indicted any big party yet.
[1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:56.120]  So we'll see if she has the guts to do this.
[1:46:56.120 --> 1:47:00.680]  The problem is if she does it and then loses, it's the end of her career.
[1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:06.120]  So this is a high risk gamble that knowing a lot of these prosecutors, they tend to talk
[1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:10.680]  a big, big game, but then they tend to fold real quickly, real easily.
[1:47:10.680 --> 1:47:14.800]  I think they were leaking that they were going to indict him in order to try to get people
[1:47:14.800 --> 1:47:17.560]  around him to flip and make false stories again.
[1:47:17.560 --> 1:47:18.560]  I totally agree with that.
[1:47:18.560 --> 1:47:19.560]  We're not going to get.
[1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:24.440]  So you think, you think Roger Stone is wrong because, I mean, they're certainly shooting
[1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:26.840]  their mouths off in New York that he's going to be indicted.
[1:47:26.840 --> 1:47:27.840]  Oh, no doubt.
[1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:30.600]  I think Roger's sources are getting accurate information.
[1:47:30.600 --> 1:47:34.520]  I have no doubt that they're, that's what, but it's a strategy, the tactical strategy
[1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:38.200]  pre-Pirara, a longtime federal prosecutor from the Southern District of New York.
[1:47:38.200 --> 1:47:41.360]  A lot of his protege still run the federal side of the operation.
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:43.120]  Syvance runs the state operation.
[1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:46.680]  They, I mean, I've defended people against both.
[1:47:46.680 --> 1:47:52.520]  The idea that I know a lot of their personnel well, they tend to bluff a lot.
[1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:58.840]  So they want to create the perception that they're going to come in with this big death
[1:47:58.840 --> 1:48:02.160]  prosecution that's going to be the end of Trump in order.
[1:48:02.160 --> 1:48:07.840]  And what they're hoping is it shakes loose somebody who has information or Intel or is
[1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:12.080]  worried about what that means and they'll come and give them a case.
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:15.120]  But unless that happens, they don't actually have a case.
[1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:19.400]  And these are people that are more terrified of losing than of anything else.
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:25.200]  So they will not go after Trump unless they get new evidence that they don't have currently.
[1:48:25.200 --> 1:48:29.720]  They will pretend to everybody and they will leak stories that they're right about to indict
[1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:32.280]  him to try to shake somebody else loose.
[1:48:32.280 --> 1:48:35.480]  I totally know what you're saying because I mean, I looked at what they claim the case
[1:48:35.480 --> 1:48:36.480]  is.
[1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:39.400]  If a bank gives you the money, they're saying, oh, it's bad.
[1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:40.400]  He overvalued the property.
[1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:42.240]  Well, that's a bank's prerogative.
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:48.200]  If they want to give somebody a loan, then that's not illegal.
[1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:51.840]  And not only that, if they were to try to indict Trump for some of that stuff, every
[1:48:51.840 --> 1:48:55.640]  single real estate developer in New York is going to get the hell out of New York because
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:49:02.000]  they all do various of these activities, involvement of tax credits, different valuations of property
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:06.520]  based on future projections versus real property, local tax appraisals.
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:07.520]  Everybody does that.
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:12.160]  Nobody's tax appraisal is their best valuation, their highest valuation of their property.
[1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:15.120]  Everybody's bank valuation is the highest possible valuation.
[1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:17.560]  So they would have to indict everybody in New York.
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:20.920]  And if you're a real estate developer in New York and you think, hey, Trump can get indicted
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:23.200]  for this kind of thing, why be in New York?
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:25.440]  The New York real estate market would crash.
[1:49:25.440 --> 1:49:28.600]  It's already in trouble over what they did during the lockdown.
[1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:31.520]  They can't afford the whole market to crash.
[1:49:31.520 --> 1:49:34.240]  Trump is on the high end of ethics and legal confines.
[1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:35.240]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:37.160]  So much so further here.
[1:49:37.160 --> 1:49:40.720]  Why are they still doing lockdowns in Canada and Europe?
[1:49:40.720 --> 1:49:44.640]  Why when it's turning everyone against the governments, it's like not even one death
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:47.640]  in the UK and it's still locked down, what is their problem?
[1:49:47.640 --> 1:49:51.760]  I mean, I know it's making big tech money and consolidating control, but or is it just
[1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:57.840]  pure megalomania by the left that they just enjoy seeing people wearing masks and submitting?
[1:49:57.840 --> 1:50:00.640]  I think it's a combination of events.
[1:50:00.640 --> 1:50:04.960]  So partially it's like the Milgram experiment and the Stanford experiment combined that
[1:50:04.960 --> 1:50:08.000]  once they got this power, they don't want to give up the power.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.040]  It's too easy to misuse and abuse the power.
[1:50:10.040 --> 1:50:11.040]  They love it.
[1:50:11.040 --> 1:50:13.840]  You know, for people like Newsom in California, it's intoxicating.
[1:50:13.840 --> 1:50:17.200]  Even though he's facing a recall because of doing all this, what does he do?
[1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:21.440]  He says, no, I'm going to keep some aspects of the lockdown rolling when it's deeply
[1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:24.600]  unpopular, increasingly enlarged segments of the state.
[1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:27.080]  So it's hurting the economy and it's hurting the society.
[1:50:27.080 --> 1:50:28.400]  So I think that's part of it.
[1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:32.680]  The other part of it is they wanted to terrify people so that they felt relieved when they
[1:50:32.680 --> 1:50:35.800]  had the opportunity to take the vaccine.
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:39.480]  So I think that unless they made life exactly, they're keeping that in place, they admit
[1:50:39.480 --> 1:50:40.480]  to forced compliance.
[1:50:40.480 --> 1:50:47.160]  I see that as backfiring and the carnival atmosphere of these vax lotteries and all of it is really
[1:50:47.160 --> 1:50:48.400]  waking people up.
[1:50:48.400 --> 1:50:49.880]  Yes, I agree.
[1:50:49.880 --> 1:50:55.360]  I mean, think about it, two years ago, you had maybe two to five percent of the country
[1:50:55.360 --> 1:50:58.080]  that was knowledgeable about vaccine risks.
[1:50:58.080 --> 1:51:02.800]  Now you have 40 to 50 percent of the country that's knowledgeable about vaccine risk.
[1:51:02.800 --> 1:51:07.160]  So this has been, the response was not what they thought would happen.
[1:51:07.160 --> 1:51:10.800]  No doubt you go back to event 201 and Bill Gates pre-planning a ball of air.
[1:51:10.800 --> 1:51:11.800]  Oh, they admit that.
[1:51:11.800 --> 1:51:12.800]  I agree.
[1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:13.800]  I agree.
[1:51:13.800 --> 1:51:14.800]  But like you said, they're going to strike back.
[1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:18.800]  And you're saying they backed off pandemic two because things backfired.
[1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:21.880]  I agree, but I think they're going to cook up something even worse.
[1:51:21.880 --> 1:51:23.640]  They've got something else up their sleeve.
[1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:28.680]  Oh, I mean, there's always going to be another wave of something, but I would expect some
[1:51:28.680 --> 1:51:31.000]  sort of terror risk somewhere around the world.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  I agree.
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  State cyber attacks.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:35.520]  They blame on a group with the deep state runs and consolidate power.
[1:51:35.520 --> 1:51:38.320]  I see cyber attacks run by the deep state.
[1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:39.320]  That's what I see.
[1:51:39.320 --> 1:51:41.440]  And the attempt to start a race war.
[1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:46.360]  I mean, I think, I mean, those are both realistic possibilities that are risk on the horizon.
[1:51:46.360 --> 1:51:47.360]  What else do you see?
[1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:53.400]  Well, I think originally the goal was to make domestic terrorism and foreign pandemics the
[1:51:53.400 --> 1:51:55.760]  method mechanism for control.
[1:51:55.760 --> 1:51:57.400]  But both of those are falling apart.
[1:51:57.400 --> 1:52:01.280]  The January 6th narrative isn't flying with anybody and the pandemic.
[1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:05.080]  Now people are seeing it was government engineered from the get go.
[1:52:05.080 --> 1:52:07.280]  And so they're going to have to adjust.
[1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:10.320]  But also remember, these people are not the brightest bulbs on the block.
[1:52:10.320 --> 1:52:15.040]  So some of them are not as smart and sophisticated as the old conspirators used to be.
[1:52:15.040 --> 1:52:18.520]  And ordinary people are getting smarter every single day.
[1:52:18.520 --> 1:52:20.520]  And that's the key source of resistance.
[1:52:20.520 --> 1:52:21.520]  Beautiful.
[1:52:21.520 --> 1:52:22.520]  All right, Barnes.
[1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:23.520]  We've got 20 seconds.
[1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:25.040]  How do folks find the show, you host?
[1:52:25.040 --> 1:52:32.400]  Sir, Viva Barnes Law dot locals dot com is where people can find all the links to everything.
[1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:33.600]  All right, buddy.
[1:52:33.600 --> 1:52:34.600]  Talk to you soon.
[1:52:34.600 --> 1:52:35.600]  All right.
[1:52:35.600 --> 1:52:39.000]  I'll cover all the cloning news when we come back.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:42.560]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[1:52:42.560 --> 1:52:46.840]  So as bad as things are with the globalist, attacking humanity with all the terrible things
[1:52:46.840 --> 1:52:52.360]  that are unfolding, I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:53.360]  I'm a public figure.
[1:52:53.360 --> 1:52:55.800]  So I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[1:52:55.800 --> 1:53:00.680]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks
[1:53:00.680 --> 1:53:08.240]  in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[1:53:08.240 --> 1:53:11.200]  They don't want to go on with the globalist, but they're scared.
[1:53:11.200 --> 1:53:12.920]  They're looking for leadership.
[1:53:12.920 --> 1:53:14.960]  Well, that's where M4 comes in.
[1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:15.960]  You fund us.
[1:53:15.960 --> 1:53:16.960]  You support M4store.com.
[1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:19.320]  You get great products at the same time.
[1:53:19.320 --> 1:53:23.920]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular, what the globalist will
[1:53:23.920 --> 1:53:29.120]  target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:30.120]  That's our job.
[1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:35.360]  So please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire so we can be the shock groups
[1:53:35.360 --> 1:53:36.360]  in the information war.
[1:53:36.360 --> 1:53:40.360]  Fund us at M4store.com.
[1:53:40.360 --> 1:53:43.920]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:53:43.920 --> 1:53:48.000]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:51.200]  But let me tell you, the new world order is breathing down our neck.
[1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:54.320]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[1:53:54.320 --> 1:53:55.640]  can to shut us down.
[1:53:55.640 --> 1:53:59.920]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local states you're
[1:53:59.920 --> 1:54:00.920]  listening to as well.
[1:54:00.920 --> 1:54:07.040]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[1:54:07.040 --> 1:54:11.920]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:13.400]  in the face of this thing.
[1:54:13.400 --> 1:54:15.520]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:19.840]  I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:54:19.840 --> 1:54:24.840]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can and buy
[1:54:24.840 --> 1:54:30.040]  great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:35.160]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[1:54:35.160 --> 1:54:40.040]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-god.
[1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:43.720]  Thank you so much.
[1:54:43.720 --> 1:54:47.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:55.800]  All right, I want to play a few clips here of people resisting tyranny.
[1:54:55.800 --> 1:55:00.440]  We already played earlier folks protesting Fauci coming to Harlem.
[1:55:00.440 --> 1:55:05.120]  Though I've got a bunch of these clips, but here's just two of them, School Principal and
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:09.080]  Vax Squad School Bus Supervisor serve with Notice of Liability.
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:10.080]  That's the second clip.
[1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:14.600]  First of all, I want to play as lawyer, serve supermarket manager with cease and desist order
[1:55:14.600 --> 1:55:17.400]  regarding stores' unconstitutional mask requirements.
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:21.160]  This is what we need to see because what's happening is classical tyranny, medical tyranny
[1:55:21.160 --> 1:55:22.160]  and a takeover.
[1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:27.280]  Here are the two clips back to back and we'll be back with the huge news, the public rollout
[1:55:27.280 --> 1:55:28.520]  of human animal clones.
[1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:39.280]  I'm not interested here, I've got a notice to serve you for the cease and desist order.
[1:55:39.280 --> 1:55:44.840]  Your masks are not only unethical, but they're unconstitutional, they violate several civil
[1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:45.840]  rights violations.
[1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:52.960]  You're asking me to leave the property, a grocery store, and you don't want it to be recorded.
[1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:53.960]  Why is that?
[1:55:53.960 --> 1:55:54.960]  It's private property.
[1:55:54.960 --> 1:55:57.960]  Private property, I thought we could chop it.
[1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:04.000]  Okay, well we'll leave, but I'm here to meet you to get that to your CEO and I will be
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:09.840]  back in seven days to see that all these times are with you.
[1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:13.600]  And looking ahead, Hawaii Pacific Health is bringing COVID vaccinations to schools across
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:14.600]  Oahu.
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:19.760]  It's Vax Squad Bus held its first mobile clinic at Waipahu High School on Thursday.
[1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:22.640]  The bus will be heading to 11 more schools in the coming weeks.
[1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:27.840]  The clinics are open to staff, teachers, students and faculty members who are 16 and older.
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:31.840]  For a complete schedule, you can head over to our website, kh12.com.
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:34.840]  Okay, do you have any kind of pamphlets that you're giving off to let the kids know the
[1:57:34.840 --> 1:57:36.840]  risks of everything going on?
[1:57:36.840 --> 1:57:40.840]  Like the amount of deaths going on with the kids, the amount of actual deaths from older
[1:57:40.840 --> 1:57:41.840]  kids?
[1:57:41.840 --> 1:57:42.840]  Why do you ask?
[1:57:42.840 --> 1:57:46.360]  Because we want to know that you're keeping them informed of what the risks are that they're
[1:57:46.360 --> 1:57:47.360]  taking right now.
[1:57:47.360 --> 1:57:48.360]  What are you with?
[1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:49.360]  I'm with the Council for Restarted Justice International.
[1:57:49.360 --> 1:57:50.360]  Okay.
[1:57:50.360 --> 1:58:04.020]  I didn't tell you that Since we didn't continue talking about this we're going back to the
[1:58:04.020 --> 1:58:06.020]  Sir, can you hand it up to the five?
[1:58:06.020 --> 1:58:07.020]  Thank you.
[1:58:13.020 --> 1:58:14.020]  Yeah, yeah, just...
[1:58:14.020 --> 1:58:15.020]  No.
[1:58:15.020 --> 1:58:16.020]  Just out of hate for traffic.
[1:58:16.020 --> 1:58:18.020]  We don't want to talk to you about that.
[1:58:18.020 --> 1:58:19.020]  No, I don't.
[1:58:19.020 --> 1:58:20.020]  We need it.
[1:58:20.020 --> 1:58:21.020]  I don't need it.
[1:58:21.020 --> 1:58:22.020]  So this bus...
[1:58:22.020 --> 1:58:23.020]  Hold on a second.
[1:58:26.020 --> 1:58:27.020]  I'm the first one to go to school.
[1:58:27.020 --> 1:58:28.020]  Oh, you're the first one?
[1:58:28.020 --> 1:58:29.020]  Yeah.
[1:58:29.020 --> 1:58:30.020]  No, I actually wanted to talk to him about the bus.
[1:58:30.020 --> 1:58:31.020]  Yeah, I have nothing to do with the school.
[1:58:31.020 --> 1:58:32.020]  Okay.
[1:58:32.020 --> 1:58:33.020]  I kind of does have to do with the school.
[1:58:33.020 --> 1:58:34.020]  I'm going to help you.
[1:58:34.020 --> 1:58:38.020]  Oh, so we just wanted to make sure that all of these kids know what exactly is going on
[1:58:38.020 --> 1:58:43.020]  in the midst of the death and all of the data, the real data, how many kids actually died
[1:58:43.020 --> 1:58:48.020]  out of full date versus out of suicide by the lockdowns versus out of this shot because
[1:58:48.020 --> 1:58:49.020]  they're getting blood clots.
[1:58:49.020 --> 1:58:50.020]  Okay.
[1:58:50.020 --> 1:58:51.020]  Are you aware of that?
[1:58:51.020 --> 1:58:54.020]  Not my business right now, but they're just a site for them.
[1:58:54.020 --> 1:58:56.020]  So how can I help you guys?
[1:58:57.020 --> 1:58:58.020]  All right, that's good.
[1:58:58.020 --> 1:59:03.020]  And the full video is www.interninfowars.com, there's hundreds of these out there now.
[1:59:03.020 --> 1:59:07.020]  And you've got a public school vaccinating people without telling the parents.
[1:59:07.020 --> 1:59:09.020]  And in San Francisco, they're doing to 12-year-olds.
[1:59:09.020 --> 1:59:11.020]  In Toronto, they're doing to 12-year-olds.
[1:59:11.020 --> 1:59:12.020]  That's 16 and older there.
[1:59:12.020 --> 1:59:13.020]  It's still illegal.
[1:59:13.020 --> 1:59:19.020]  And these monsters get everybody to cast themselves as heroes.
[1:59:19.020 --> 1:59:20.020]  And you're a hero.
[1:59:20.020 --> 1:59:21.020]  Get them vaccinated.
[1:59:21.020 --> 1:59:23.020]  It's not a vaccine.
[1:59:23.020 --> 1:59:27.020]  And you will be held accountable for the people that get sick and die.
[1:59:27.020 --> 1:59:30.020]  It doesn't matter if the globalists claim they've got immunity.
[1:59:30.020 --> 1:59:32.020]  They don't have immunity from reality.
[1:59:32.020 --> 1:59:36.020]  And every one of you that are involved in this are going to face God for it.
[1:59:36.020 --> 1:59:39.020]  Make no mistake, you will not escape God's judgment.
[1:59:39.020 --> 1:59:42.020]  It doesn't matter if the dumbass UN gives you liability protection.
[1:59:42.020 --> 1:59:47.020]  They did a lockdown that did martial law and then later forced inoculations.
[1:59:47.020 --> 1:59:51.020]  I am blown away at how effective Info Wars is.
[1:59:51.020 --> 1:59:54.020]  I am humbled by how we're changing the world.
[1:59:54.020 --> 1:59:58.020]  And it's important for you to really internalize the fact that you are the Info War.
[1:59:58.020 --> 2:00:02.020]  When you spread the word, when you financially support us, when you pray for us,
[2:00:02.020 --> 2:00:05.020]  you change history.
[2:00:05.020 --> 2:00:11.020]  You give my children and your children and our entire species a chance at the future
[2:00:11.020 --> 2:00:15.020]  instead of these evil, post-humanist, exterminist globalist winning.
[2:00:15.020 --> 2:00:17.020]  And we're giving them a run for their money right now.
[2:00:17.020 --> 2:00:22.020]  So that's why I want to encourage everyone in the month of June 2021
[2:00:22.020 --> 2:00:25.020]  to spread the word about Info Wars now more than ever.
[2:00:25.020 --> 2:00:26.020]  Don't be ashamed of Info Wars.
[2:00:26.020 --> 2:00:29.020]  Be proud of the fact that we have been in so many fights
[2:00:29.020 --> 2:00:31.020]  and that we've been so bruised and so scarred.
[2:00:31.020 --> 2:00:34.020]  Because those are the signs of our victories, the signs of your victory.
[2:00:34.020 --> 2:00:38.020]  And also please financially support us by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:00:38.020 --> 2:00:40.020]  It's only running through next Monday.

[2:01:15.020 --> 2:01:32.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're into hour number three
[2:01:32.020 --> 2:01:35.020]  on this June 7th Monday transmission.
[2:01:35.020 --> 2:01:40.020]  And humanity is definitely in the danger zone.
[2:01:40.020 --> 2:01:45.020]  Whether you believe in the Bible or not, it's certainly coming true.
[2:01:45.020 --> 2:01:48.020]  And what we see at the beginning of the Bible
[2:01:48.020 --> 2:01:52.020]  and what we see at the end of the Bible is the same story.
[2:01:52.020 --> 2:01:57.020]  Scientists were splicing humans and animals.
[2:01:57.020 --> 2:02:01.020]  Scientists were changing the genetics of humans.
[2:02:01.020 --> 2:02:07.020]  And none of the line of humans left on the planet were human anymore.
[2:02:07.020 --> 2:02:11.020]  So God destroyed almost all the people on the earth.
[2:02:11.020 --> 2:02:17.020]  And then we have a Jewish history or legend written into the Torah,
[2:02:17.020 --> 2:02:20.020]  or the original Old Testament, telling us what happened.
[2:02:20.020 --> 2:02:25.020]  But if you go into the different ancient Babylonian and Egyptian texts
[2:02:25.020 --> 2:02:30.020]  and others, they say basically the same thing happened.
[2:02:30.020 --> 2:02:33.020]  So there was some big cataclysmic event.
[2:02:33.020 --> 2:02:40.020]  And Plato, who was the top Greek philosopher who held the Greek archives
[2:02:40.020 --> 2:02:42.020]  and who launched really modern civilization,
[2:02:42.020 --> 2:02:48.020]  he said that there was also a giant explosion in the Atlantic Ocean
[2:02:48.020 --> 2:02:53.020]  that then caused the seas to rise and kill most of the people all over the world.
[2:02:53.020 --> 2:02:57.020]  And of course, that explosion was the destruction and fall of Atlantis,
[2:02:57.020 --> 2:03:02.020]  which reportedly had a giant white beam of light that powered the city island
[2:03:02.020 --> 2:03:05.020]  and that they had ships that flew in the air.
[2:03:05.020 --> 2:03:14.020]  Now, whether that was true then, the Plato said it had happened thousands of years before,
[2:03:14.020 --> 2:03:16.020]  it sure is true now.
[2:03:16.020 --> 2:03:21.020]  You can pull up, China creates artificial sun for the longest period of time.
[2:03:21.020 --> 2:03:29.020]  They went for days with an artificial sun that was giving them enough power
[2:03:29.020 --> 2:03:33.020]  to run all of China while it was on.
[2:03:33.020 --> 2:03:35.020]  And it took a lot of power to get it going.
[2:03:35.020 --> 2:03:39.020]  But once they got it going, it created basically unlimited free energy.
[2:03:39.020 --> 2:03:41.020]  That was just last week.
[2:03:41.020 --> 2:03:43.020]  And that's just a footnote.
[2:03:43.020 --> 2:03:47.020]  Just type in China creates longest active artificial sun.
[2:03:47.020 --> 2:03:51.020]  A sign of turns on nuclear-powered artificial sun.
[2:03:51.020 --> 2:03:54.020]  See, that's the kind of stuff I'm into.
[2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:56.020]  And so if you're sitting around having cocktails and you go,
[2:03:56.020 --> 2:03:59.020]  hey, you know, China created artificial sun last week,
[2:03:59.020 --> 2:04:02.020]  people go, uh-huh, I'll show, sure they did.
[2:04:02.020 --> 2:04:04.020]  You dumbass.
[2:04:04.020 --> 2:04:08.020]  Hey, I was reading like 25 years ago that they had animal human hybrids.
[2:04:08.020 --> 2:04:10.020]  Oh, where'd you see that?
[2:04:10.020 --> 2:04:12.020]  You know, in a comic book.
[2:04:12.020 --> 2:04:14.020]  And I'm like, no, it was an MIT report.
[2:04:14.020 --> 2:04:16.020]  I was sent up by a concerned scientist.
[2:04:16.020 --> 2:04:17.020]  Would you like to see it?
[2:04:17.020 --> 2:04:18.020]  It's in my car.
[2:04:18.020 --> 2:04:22.020]  No, we don't want to see about the animals and humans being spliced.
[2:04:22.020 --> 2:04:23.020]  It doesn't exist.
[2:04:23.020 --> 2:04:26.020]  I'll never forget because my ex-wife broke her water that night.
[2:04:26.020 --> 2:04:29.020]  It's a place called Conan's Pizza, delicious deep dish pizza.
[2:04:29.020 --> 2:04:32.020]  And we live right down the street in South Austin from it.
[2:04:32.020 --> 2:04:35.020]  And it was like 10 o'clock at night and I was editing Masters of Terror,
[2:04:35.020 --> 2:04:36.020]  a film I made.
[2:04:36.020 --> 2:04:38.020]  And I was like 9.30 and I wanted a pizza.
[2:04:38.020 --> 2:04:39.020]  So I order it.
[2:04:39.020 --> 2:04:42.020]  I go in to get it because they don't deliver.
[2:04:42.020 --> 2:04:44.020]  And a guy goes, pfft.
[2:04:44.020 --> 2:04:47.020]  Pushes, like, hits me in the back, kind of pretty hard.
[2:04:47.020 --> 2:04:50.020]  But I was tired and I wanted my pizza.
[2:04:50.020 --> 2:04:54.020]  And I turned around and I was like, whoa.
[2:04:54.020 --> 2:04:57.020]  And he goes, I used to watch you for a long time.
[2:04:57.020 --> 2:04:59.020]  But you're a liar.
[2:04:59.020 --> 2:05:02.020]  You can't put insect genes into plants.
[2:05:02.020 --> 2:05:04.020]  There's no such thing as cross species.
[2:05:04.020 --> 2:05:07.020]  I went to UT and I used to think you were a great guy.
[2:05:07.020 --> 2:05:10.020]  But now I know you're an effing liar.
[2:05:10.020 --> 2:05:13.020]  And I told him, I said, number one, back up,
[2:05:13.020 --> 2:05:17.020]  or I'm going to beat the living hell out of you if you touch me again.
[2:05:17.020 --> 2:05:20.020]  And he started running his mouth. I said, listen, you don't look too tough, Jack.
[2:05:20.020 --> 2:05:23.020]  You want to get your genie neck broken?
[2:05:23.020 --> 2:05:25.020]  He goes, oh, I'm sorry.
[2:05:25.020 --> 2:05:26.020]  I just didn't know you were a liar.
[2:05:26.020 --> 2:05:28.020]  And I said, you are never a listener.
[2:05:28.020 --> 2:05:29.020]  You're a punk.
[2:05:29.020 --> 2:05:33.020]  And you came in here to poke me in the back to sit there and try to dominate me.
[2:05:33.020 --> 2:05:34.020]  Well, guess what?
[2:05:34.020 --> 2:05:35.020]  It ain't happening.
[2:05:35.020 --> 2:05:37.020]  Now, I don't tell that story to act tough.
[2:05:37.020 --> 2:05:40.020]  That's a real story happened.
[2:05:40.020 --> 2:05:43.020]  And then I got so mad five minutes later at home,
[2:05:43.020 --> 2:05:45.020]  I actually bit into a fork law.
[2:05:45.020 --> 2:05:47.020]  I was eating a pizza with a fork and knife.
[2:05:47.020 --> 2:05:49.020]  I like to eat it or I'll start just eating each piece.
[2:05:49.020 --> 2:05:51.020]  I feel the knife and fork take my time.
[2:05:51.020 --> 2:05:54.020]  I eat the whole damn pizza in five minutes to like an hour.
[2:05:54.020 --> 2:05:59.020]  But the reason I tell that story is I don't know why the guy poked me in the back.
[2:05:59.020 --> 2:06:02.020]  But it's something about animal human hybrids.
[2:06:02.020 --> 2:06:04.020]  People just can't handle the truth.
[2:06:04.020 --> 2:06:06.020]  And they get very upset.
[2:06:06.020 --> 2:06:10.020]  Because a few months ago, I had somebody in a grocery store go,
[2:06:10.020 --> 2:06:11.020]  the standard stuff.
[2:06:11.020 --> 2:06:12.020]  You know what they say.
[2:06:12.020 --> 2:06:13.020]  It's the standard stuff.
[2:06:13.020 --> 2:06:14.020]  You're a Russian agent.
[2:06:14.020 --> 2:06:15.020]  Oh, yeah.
[2:06:15.020 --> 2:06:17.020]  What about the Sandy Hook families?
[2:06:17.020 --> 2:06:19.020]  I'm like, hey, it's okay to question things,
[2:06:19.020 --> 2:06:21.020]  but I haven't said it happened in years.
[2:06:21.020 --> 2:06:22.020]  Oh, yeah.
[2:06:22.020 --> 2:06:23.020]  And then, oh, yeah.
[2:06:23.020 --> 2:06:26.020]  And they're making animal human hybrids, right?
[2:06:26.020 --> 2:06:28.020]  That's what I get challenged with.
[2:06:28.020 --> 2:06:32.020]  And it just shows these people's ignorance.
[2:06:32.020 --> 2:06:34.020]  Because governments do stage things.
[2:06:34.020 --> 2:06:35.020]  We have a right to question everything.
[2:06:35.020 --> 2:06:38.020]  And there are human animal hybrids.
[2:06:38.020 --> 2:06:40.020]  Take these salmon they just approved.
[2:06:40.020 --> 2:06:44.020]  They had those same genetically engineered salmon 10 years ago,
[2:06:44.020 --> 2:06:47.020]  and they couldn't get FDA authorization.
[2:06:47.020 --> 2:06:53.020]  Because they're part asparagus and walking stick.
[2:06:53.020 --> 2:07:00.020]  And when you ask the company, why is there asparagus and walking stick in it?
[2:07:00.020 --> 2:07:05.020]  And they go, we don't know why we just with a gene gun,
[2:07:05.020 --> 2:07:12.020]  and we're splicing stuff with the genetics and then injecting it into a salmon egg.
[2:07:12.020 --> 2:07:14.020]  And we don't know.
[2:07:14.020 --> 2:07:17.020]  We just know it makes them twice as big.
[2:07:17.020 --> 2:07:21.020]  And real mean, too, that they kill regular salmon.
[2:07:21.020 --> 2:07:22.020]  Not normally carnivorous.
[2:07:22.020 --> 2:07:24.020]  Now they are of their own species.
[2:07:24.020 --> 2:07:30.020]  So we don't know it makes them twice as big and they're really mean.
[2:07:30.020 --> 2:07:33.020]  Now, again, we don't know why asparagus.
[2:07:33.020 --> 2:07:35.020]  And again, I get why listeners hear that.
[2:07:35.020 --> 2:07:40.020]  They go, Jones is saying they got salmon that are part asparagus and walking stick.
[2:07:40.020 --> 2:07:44.020]  Hey, you know, it's like the Pfizer mRNA shot.
[2:07:44.020 --> 2:07:50.020]  It says there's the full genome of a colony creature, jellyfish,
[2:07:50.020 --> 2:07:57.020]  and the full genome of a dead boy that they've been cloning since 1966.
[2:07:57.020 --> 2:08:03.020]  And by the way, when you're reading the literature, it says the human genome clone of his,
[2:08:03.020 --> 2:08:08.020]  of his entire genome was, it gives all the data.
[2:08:08.020 --> 2:08:12.020]  And then by 1987, he was successfully cloned to the laboratory.
[2:08:12.020 --> 2:08:17.020]  And they're cloning the damn embryo for whatever reason of this one boy.
[2:08:17.020 --> 2:08:19.020]  And who knows why they're doing it?
[2:08:19.020 --> 2:08:20.020]  Because it's all proprietary.
[2:08:20.020 --> 2:08:24.020]  They won't tell you why there's a jellyfish genome in there.
[2:08:24.020 --> 2:08:27.020]  They won't tell you why there's the whole genome of a dead boy.
[2:08:27.020 --> 2:08:29.020]  I'm sorry this sounds so crazy.
[2:08:29.020 --> 2:08:35.020]  I'm not the one coming up with this stuff.
[2:08:35.020 --> 2:08:41.020]  So that's where all this is.
[2:08:41.020 --> 2:08:42.020]  Now, there it is.
[2:08:42.020 --> 2:08:47.020]  How can we still use a field cell line from 1960 to make vaccines today?
[2:08:47.020 --> 2:08:48.020]  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
[2:08:48.020 --> 2:08:49.020]  Go read it.
[2:08:49.020 --> 2:08:51.020]  It's a dead boy from 66.
[2:08:51.020 --> 2:08:57.020]  And then they're also using the genes of some dead black woman died in 1954.
[2:08:57.020 --> 2:09:01.020]  I mean, a cancerator in like a week.
[2:09:01.020 --> 2:09:07.020]  And that's the reason they said, we got to check what day or because the cancer like literally like a blob just like eight,
[2:09:07.020 --> 2:09:08.020]  like eight half her body or week.
[2:09:08.020 --> 2:09:12.020]  Like it was moving so fast, like every hour, even eating a few more inches of her.
[2:09:12.020 --> 2:09:14.020]  They were like, what the hell is this?
[2:09:14.020 --> 2:09:17.020]  And the Pentagon flies in and they grab her and they, let's find out.
[2:09:17.020 --> 2:09:21.020]  It's like some super cell, not even the planet eats everything.
[2:09:21.020 --> 2:09:27.020]  And they have just been busy with whatever they found this dead white kid and whatever they got from this dead black woman.
[2:09:27.020 --> 2:09:32.020]  And then walking sticks and asparagus.
[2:09:32.020 --> 2:09:37.020]  I don't know what's going on.
[2:09:37.020 --> 2:09:41.020]  I just know we're in a lot of trouble.
[2:09:41.020 --> 2:09:46.020]  Because if you study what all this stuff does, when you start splicing insects and animals,
[2:09:46.020 --> 2:09:50.020]  it then allows whatever infects those insects to get into humans and vice versa.
[2:09:50.020 --> 2:09:52.020]  And that's the real problem of zoological creations.
[2:09:52.020 --> 2:09:57.020]  Plus God plus, I mean, are they going to have rights?
[2:09:57.020 --> 2:09:58.020]  Who made them?
[2:09:58.020 --> 2:09:59.020]  What's going on?
[2:09:59.020 --> 2:10:02.020]  You think they put Trojan horses in your cell phone?
[2:10:02.020 --> 2:10:05.020]  You think they've got dual use for folks?
[2:10:05.020 --> 2:10:15.020]  When we come back, I'm going to be judicious and I'm going to play you the new trailer for the new TV show that magically came out in a major sigh.
[2:10:15.020 --> 2:10:19.020]  Accompanied by fake news and everything this week.
[2:10:19.020 --> 2:10:24.020]  One week after the Senate legalized human animal clones.
[2:10:24.020 --> 2:10:27.020]  So we are not in Kansas anymore.
[2:10:27.020 --> 2:10:32.020]  I hear some powerful rat from 1983 crank it up.
[2:10:32.020 --> 2:10:35.020]  Yeah.
[2:10:35.020 --> 2:10:38.020]  Good guitar right there.
[2:10:38.020 --> 2:10:41.020]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:10:41.020 --> 2:10:49.020]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:10:49.020 --> 2:10:51.020]  Your voice counts.
[2:10:51.020 --> 2:10:56.020]  When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[2:10:56.020 --> 2:10:59.020]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:10:59.020 --> 2:11:00.020]  They know you're angry.
[2:11:00.020 --> 2:11:06.020]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[2:11:06.020 --> 2:11:13.020]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds.

[2:11:48.020 --> 2:11:57.020]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[2:11:57.020 --> 2:12:02.020]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[2:12:02.020 --> 2:12:13.020]  Super male vitality, specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[2:12:13.020 --> 2:12:24.020]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[2:12:24.020 --> 2:12:30.020]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[2:12:30.020 --> 2:12:37.020]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[2:12:37.020 --> 2:12:38.020]  So what are you waiting for?
[2:12:38.020 --> 2:12:47.020]  Go to the N4 store. Never been a better time than right now. Super male vitality at N4store.com.
[2:12:47.020 --> 2:12:50.020]  It's Friday, June 4th when I'm shooting this quick report.
[2:12:50.020 --> 2:12:56.020]  And I just want to congratulate all the viewers and listeners of N4Wars, our sponsors, our affiliates, the crew.
[2:12:56.020 --> 2:13:04.020]  Because we have been the very tip of the spear when it comes to exposing the fact that the United Nations with the Chai comms released COVID-19 on purpose.
[2:13:04.020 --> 2:13:12.020]  And now all that's coming out, the fact that Big Tech was involved, the fact that Big Pharma ran the operation, it is all coming out.
[2:13:12.020 --> 2:13:21.020]  And that's why it's more important than ever that you tell everyone you know, strangers, neighbors, friends, family, coworkers to tune in to the broadcast every day.
[2:13:21.020 --> 2:13:26.020]  And it's important to get great products that keep us on there at the same time, a symbiotic relationship.
[2:13:26.020 --> 2:13:35.020]  Next Monday, just in a few days, the sale ends for Store Run for Shipping, Double Patriot Points, and DNA Force Plus, 40% off.
[2:13:35.020 --> 2:13:39.020]  And so many other great products, up to 50% off at N4store.com.
[2:13:39.020 --> 2:13:44.020]  It's our biggest sale of the year right now, so please take advantage of it and keep us on air.
[2:13:44.020 --> 2:13:57.020]  Thank you for your past and future support.
[2:14:14.020 --> 2:14:36.020]  So I would love to say this was some grand, incredible psychic moment that I've been telling you about Human Animal Clones for 25 years, plus.
[2:14:36.020 --> 2:14:49.020]  But no, it's in all the literature. And then I've interviewed scientists and talked to others and talked to security people that have been in secret parts of the government that said they saw Human Animal Clones.
[2:14:49.020 --> 2:14:56.020]  And what they described was so nightmarish, I've never really even told you on air.
[2:14:56.020 --> 2:15:03.020]  I've told parts of it.
[2:15:03.020 --> 2:15:08.020]  Once you understand the psychology of these people, and that they're mad scientists, you understand everything.
[2:15:08.020 --> 2:15:17.020]  So guys, pull up the footage we showed last week of the bio bag, a quote, bag that grows a lamb in it.
[2:15:17.020 --> 2:15:24.020]  Now, that's not really a lamb that's being grown in that bag.
[2:15:24.020 --> 2:15:53.020]  They have a brain dead mother sheep or mother pig, depending on the system, in another bag that's putting a permanent coma that then sends the nutrients to the blood into the sheep or the pig.
[2:15:53.020 --> 2:16:04.020]  And all this stuff you're seeing with all the real stuff and all the Hollywood stuff is to condition you to just accept it like its background noise, like its ambient, like, oh, you're just checking your internet.
[2:16:04.020 --> 2:16:08.020]  Oh, you're growing a baby in a pod 10 feet away.
[2:16:08.020 --> 2:16:11.020]  And it's just no big deal.
[2:16:11.020 --> 2:16:20.020]  So let's, let's, let's move from the fake pod they show you, that they show university students to condition them to the real pod, the bio bag.
[2:16:20.020 --> 2:16:41.020]  And the bio bag is simply a bag, an artificial uterus with hoses and things hooked up to a real creature that is in another bag supplying its essence.
[2:16:41.020 --> 2:16:49.020]  And then what you do is you want to get human organs grown up to a large size, because most people get transplants or adult.
[2:16:49.020 --> 2:16:58.020]  And so you, you create a human clone that's part human, but also part cows is the, is the main one they're using.
[2:16:58.020 --> 2:17:08.020]  So that you can then implant into the cows uterus and grow up a 40 or 50 pound humanoid.
[2:17:08.020 --> 2:17:15.020]  So that the liver and organs that you want to be getting are a little bit bigger.
[2:17:15.020 --> 2:17:28.020]  And so when they show you all these horrors, that's just them introducing 50 year old stuff they've been doing.
[2:17:28.020 --> 2:17:32.020]  Yeah, this is mad scientist stuff on PCP.
[2:17:32.020 --> 2:17:36.020]  So see, that's just an introduction to this.
[2:17:36.020 --> 2:17:49.020]  But the big issue with it is you're allowing corporations to take human genetics and put them into animals and then create whole new classes that don't have rights and that they own.
[2:17:49.020 --> 2:18:01.020]  And then if you can patent life and control life, you can release life at a industrial farming level that you control and that you can chip.
[2:18:01.020 --> 2:18:03.020]  Oh, so the general public won't take a chip.
[2:18:03.020 --> 2:18:05.020]  That's okay.
[2:18:05.020 --> 2:18:10.020]  We've got a million clones we just grew that are part animal.
[2:18:10.020 --> 2:18:19.020]  So they have no rights.
[2:18:19.020 --> 2:18:26.020]  And now though, the UN says they do have rights, but rights to follow orders of the UN.
[2:18:26.020 --> 2:18:28.020]  So you don't have a right to say no to them.
[2:18:28.020 --> 2:18:31.020]  You don't have a right to not let one date your daughter.
[2:18:31.020 --> 2:18:34.020]  Oh, think about that.
[2:18:34.020 --> 2:18:46.020]  This got rights under the UN, but it's owned by the corporations and controlled and will have a genetic matrix programmed into it, but also an artificial silicon control system.
[2:18:46.020 --> 2:18:49.020]  And again, this is all biomechanical.
[2:18:49.020 --> 2:19:18.020]  And this was already, as I've told you before, so big in like 1982, 83 that every well known American born implant doctor my dad knew in Dallas and other areas in Texas, they were being approached by the CIA and by DARPA to go to work in human splicing programs with machine.
[2:19:18.020 --> 2:19:21.020]  And my dad said, no, my mom said, we're not moving to Maryland.
[2:19:21.020 --> 2:19:24.020]  You're not going to be two months or whatever it was underground and then a month out.
[2:19:24.020 --> 2:19:26.020]  We're not doing it.
[2:19:26.020 --> 2:19:30.020]  I mean, my mom never threatened divorce, but I remember around the corner, listen, she goes, David, I'll divorce you.
[2:19:30.020 --> 2:19:34.020]  We're not moving to Maryland and you're not working in a damn underground base.
[2:19:34.020 --> 2:19:40.020]  Now, that's when I'm like 10 years old, I'm hearing this.
[2:19:40.020 --> 2:19:48.020]  And I'm just giving you an example of how nobody's in, it's not like, oh, my dad got offered to go to the Mars mission or something.
[2:19:48.020 --> 2:19:52.020]  No, no, it's like, I heard my dad got offered a job driving 18 wheelers.
[2:19:52.020 --> 2:20:00.020]  I mean, they were hiring tens of thousands of dentist who knew how to do implant surgery.
[2:20:00.020 --> 2:20:03.020]  And all they told him is it's cyborgs.
[2:20:03.020 --> 2:20:05.020]  And my dad said, I'm not taking the job.
[2:20:05.020 --> 2:20:11.020]  Even though it was like four times what he was making, that's how big this is.
[2:20:11.020 --> 2:20:17.020]  1983 that most of the dentists he knew were offered it a bunch of them disappeared.
[2:20:17.020 --> 2:20:20.020]  I asked my dad a few years ago, did you ever hear of those guys?
[2:20:20.020 --> 2:20:22.020]  I never heard of those people again, though.
[2:20:22.020 --> 2:20:23.020]  I mean, you heard from other dentists, right?
[2:20:23.020 --> 2:20:24.020]  Yeah, I heard them all the time.
[2:20:24.020 --> 2:20:25.020]  Yeah, he never heard from them again.
[2:20:25.020 --> 2:20:27.020]  What the hell's going on?
[2:20:27.020 --> 2:20:34.020]  He knew a bunch of the dentist that got sucked into a black hole.
[2:20:34.020 --> 2:20:42.020]  So, see, while we're all up here watching TV in the ball game and going out and having a beer
[2:20:42.020 --> 2:20:48.020]  and laughing with our buddies and everything else, there's literally an underground civilization
[2:20:48.020 --> 2:20:51.020]  that is super advanced.
[2:20:51.020 --> 2:20:55.020]  It's already got tears for every cancer that can grow whole clones,
[2:20:55.020 --> 2:20:59.020]  and they can pretty much transfer data into another brain.
[2:20:59.020 --> 2:21:01.020]  The spirit's not there, but it can fool somebody.
[2:21:01.020 --> 2:21:04.020]  So, they've got it.
[2:21:04.020 --> 2:21:05.020]  They've got it.
[2:21:05.020 --> 2:21:10.020]  And they're like sitting back going, are we going to share this with the public?
[2:21:10.020 --> 2:21:12.020]  No.
[2:21:12.020 --> 2:21:19.020]  But let's test on the public all sorts of things and get cures to this and cures that for ourselves,
[2:21:19.020 --> 2:21:24.020]  and let's set the precedent to get rid of the general public and have them dine to your left and dine to your right,
[2:21:24.020 --> 2:21:28.020]  and to see if the doctors and scientists and nurses will just go along with the cover-ups,
[2:21:28.020 --> 2:21:33.020]  and so far, they've been doing it.
[2:21:33.020 --> 2:21:41.020]  And so, this is Elysium meets 1984.
[2:21:41.020 --> 2:21:46.020]  And there's all these selfish people that have even reached out to me, and they're like,
[2:21:46.020 --> 2:21:52.020]  Jones, you're one of us, you understand all this, you should just join us.
[2:21:52.020 --> 2:21:58.020]  And in the beginning, you based it on basically a fake pandemic and blocking regular medicines
[2:21:58.020 --> 2:22:03.020]  that people would get for regular colds and the flu so they'd die.
[2:22:03.020 --> 2:22:07.020]  And I'm supposed to shine on with you?
[2:22:07.020 --> 2:22:13.020]  Oh, because I'll get some advanced treatment and live longer?
[2:22:13.020 --> 2:22:16.020]  You dumbasses think you're the only thing in the universe.
[2:22:16.020 --> 2:22:21.020]  If you had any spiritual connection, you'd know this pisses our maker off big time.
[2:22:21.020 --> 2:22:23.020]  This is the ultimate sin what you're doing.
[2:22:23.020 --> 2:22:31.020]  And I will not change my genetic code, and I will not be involved in sucking off baby clones,
[2:22:31.020 --> 2:22:37.020]  and I will not be involved taking their organs, and I warn everybody to stay completely clear of this
[2:22:37.020 --> 2:22:38.020]  and not be part of it.
[2:22:38.020 --> 2:22:39.020]  But here's the revolution.
[2:22:39.020 --> 2:22:41.020]  It's all coming out in the open now.
[2:22:41.020 --> 2:22:44.020]  So when we come back, we'll play the new trailer for the show, pushing it,
[2:22:44.020 --> 2:22:49.020]  and the giant scythe they just launched.
[2:22:49.020 --> 2:22:51.020]  Your voice counts.
[2:22:51.020 --> 2:22:56.020]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[2:22:56.020 --> 2:22:59.020]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:22:59.020 --> 2:23:00.020]  They know you're angry.
[2:23:00.020 --> 2:23:06.020]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[2:23:06.020 --> 2:23:10.020]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts,

[2:24:48.020 --> 2:24:53.020]  One of the most common questions I get on air, but also off air when I'm just out and about,
[2:24:53.020 --> 2:24:57.020]  is, Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines?
[2:24:57.020 --> 2:24:59.020]  How do I warn them?
[2:24:59.020 --> 2:25:02.020]  Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it.
[2:25:02.020 --> 2:25:03.020]  So many facts.
[2:25:03.020 --> 2:25:08.020]  It's the history of contaminated vaccines, the fact that they have liability protection in the U.S. and Europe,
[2:25:08.020 --> 2:25:13.020]  the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines,
[2:25:13.020 --> 2:25:19.020]  the whole history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans.
[2:25:19.020 --> 2:25:20.020]  The list goes on and on.
[2:25:20.020 --> 2:25:28.020]  But what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress, and so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021,
[2:25:28.020 --> 2:25:36.020]  that around half of the NIH CDC staff, medical doctors, virologists, scientists have refused to take the vaccine until they can save?
[2:25:36.020 --> 2:25:40.020]  Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it.
[2:25:40.020 --> 2:25:44.020]  The same thing in the private practices out there, similar numbers, that that's not something I'm going to be taking.
[2:25:44.020 --> 2:25:46.020]  That's very, very simple.
[2:25:46.020 --> 2:25:47.020]  There's your answer.
[2:25:47.020 --> 2:25:52.020]  I am very, very proud to be at the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[2:25:52.020 --> 2:25:59.020]  But I can't stay at the tip of the spear fighting for my family and your family unless you support us.
[2:25:59.020 --> 2:26:03.020]  And you do that by praying for us, by spreading the word with our articles and videos,
[2:26:03.020 --> 2:26:05.020]  and by financially supporting us.
[2:26:05.020 --> 2:26:11.020]  And that's really important to do because we don't have Bill Gates, we don't have Warren Buffett, we don't have Ted Turner,
[2:26:11.020 --> 2:26:13.020]  we don't have George Soros funding us.
[2:26:13.020 --> 2:26:15.020]  We have the people funding us.
[2:26:15.020 --> 2:26:17.020]  And right now, it's really easy to do.
[2:26:17.020 --> 2:26:24.020]  Biggest sell of the year, double-patriot points, store-wide free shipping, and up to 50% off on all our best-selling products.

[2:26:43.020 --> 2:26:59.020]  That's infowarstore.com, free shipping ends Monday.
[2:27:13.020 --> 2:27:22.020]  We got Jason Jones.
[2:27:22.020 --> 2:27:24.020]  We had to leave Hawaii.
[2:27:24.020 --> 2:27:26.020]  It's basically our martial law.
[2:27:26.020 --> 2:27:31.020]  That's the fellow Texan in the studio with us to cover the waterfront next hour.
[2:27:31.020 --> 2:27:39.020]  Yeah, we got to break out of the globalist spell to put us under a spell.
[2:27:39.020 --> 2:27:44.020]  Now we realize how much trouble we're in.
[2:27:44.020 --> 2:27:52.020]  So there's a scientific revolution happening that makes cruelty to animals and cruelty to humans on a scale of 1 to 10 look like a 1.
[2:27:52.020 --> 2:27:58.020]  This is like a 100. This is so bad, so evil, so abusive, so twisted.
[2:27:58.020 --> 2:28:00.020]  And it's all basically now happening.
[2:28:00.020 --> 2:28:02.020]  It's like the salmon's the perfect microcosm.
[2:28:02.020 --> 2:28:13.020]  They've had it for over a decade, twice the size, kills natural salmon, super vicious, heart insect, heart vegetable.
[2:28:13.020 --> 2:28:22.020]  And they just say, hey, we're going to put it in restaurants that don't label what you're eating.
[2:28:22.020 --> 2:28:24.020]  They admit we're keeping a cigarette from you.
[2:28:24.020 --> 2:28:27.020]  But the FDA said you can do it.
[2:28:27.020 --> 2:28:32.020]  So the FDA is posing to protect you from all these bad things out there, but they're not.
[2:28:32.020 --> 2:28:34.020]  They're letting you take an experimental shot.
[2:28:34.020 --> 2:28:37.020]  They're letting you eat a GMO fish because the decision has been made.
[2:28:37.020 --> 2:28:43.020]  Just go ahead with all of this.
[2:28:43.020 --> 2:28:50.020]  Yeah, Judge orders the FDA to analyze the risk of escaped by the general injured salmon, but they're not really doing it.
[2:28:50.020 --> 2:28:53.020]  So that's what's going on here.
[2:28:53.020 --> 2:29:11.020]  And then comes this show that premiered Friday on Netflix with its whole anti-human agenda one week after the U.S. Senate had a well-written law in front of it,
[2:29:11.020 --> 2:29:17.020]  pointing out that we're doing animal human chimeros, human cloning all over the U.S., which is all confirmed.
[2:29:17.020 --> 2:29:23.020]  And they said we're going to keep doing it, and they said we're not passing a law against it, meaning there is no law.
[2:29:23.020 --> 2:29:25.020]  It's wild, wild west.
[2:29:25.020 --> 2:29:26.020]  I'm going to explain this right now.
[2:29:26.020 --> 2:29:31.020]  I want us to be very careful because there's thousands of applications, but this is one of the worst.
[2:29:31.020 --> 2:29:37.020]  The Holy Grail at MIT of artificial intelligence, the thing that their top scientists are tasked with working on,
[2:29:37.020 --> 2:29:39.020]  because I had dinner with one of their top people.
[2:29:39.020 --> 2:29:42.020]  I'll leave it at that.
[2:29:42.020 --> 2:29:46.020]  A few months ago, I was invited to a little special dinner.
[2:29:46.020 --> 2:29:48.020]  I'll leave it at that.
[2:29:48.020 --> 2:29:58.020]  And they said, yeah, our main mission is to create sex bots that will take control of procreation, and that's just the main goal we've been given.
[2:29:58.020 --> 2:30:03.020]  And there's a lot of reasons for that, obviously, because you can get men away from women and vice versa.
[2:30:03.020 --> 2:30:11.020]  You can control procreation, and it will make the act of creating new humans a pure laboratory function.
[2:30:11.020 --> 2:30:14.020]  And then the globalists are gone, basically, in their view.
[2:30:14.020 --> 2:30:16.020]  But what's it really about?
[2:30:16.020 --> 2:30:18.020]  Well, it's about turning humans into a commodity.
[2:30:18.020 --> 2:30:21.020]  So pedophilia is illegal.
[2:30:21.020 --> 2:30:28.020]  The globalists are obsessed with it because they vampirically draw energy off the child, and Satan likes to see a child's innocence destroyed.
[2:30:28.020 --> 2:30:34.020]  It's a metaphysical, interdimensional act of violence of vandalism against God.
[2:30:34.020 --> 2:30:36.020]  It's like banging a gong.
[2:30:36.020 --> 2:30:43.020]  It's like nails on a chalkboard to God to see innocent children having their potential deaths destroyed, having their innocence sucked off of them.
[2:30:43.020 --> 2:31:02.020]  Did you know there is no law that you can create a child that is one-one-billionth human or one-one-billionth insect or one-one-billionth chimpanzee?
[2:31:02.020 --> 2:31:11.020]  So that child can be 99.99999999% human, or it can look like a human, but it's not really human.
[2:31:11.020 --> 2:31:14.020]  The point is, is that that's the future.
[2:31:14.020 --> 2:31:20.020]  You're not going to go buy a flashlight that's an artificial vagina to have sex with.
[2:31:20.020 --> 2:31:22.020]  Talk about gross.
[2:31:22.020 --> 2:31:34.020]  You will get in the mail a box with a physical vagina that's been grown and made that you eat a little food package, you feed to it, and it's a self-contained vagina you have sex with.
[2:31:34.020 --> 2:31:36.020]  And I'm not trying to be gross here.
[2:31:36.020 --> 2:31:41.020]  We will hear about another thousand uses for this because this is what they're inactive development of.
[2:31:41.020 --> 2:31:47.020]  UT was studying lab-grown vaginas when I was led into their secret complex 20 years ago for just like an hour.
[2:31:47.020 --> 2:31:54.020]  I was just, oh, that's where they're creating artificial vaginas over there.
[2:31:54.020 --> 2:31:57.020]  Because above all, these are perverts.
[2:31:57.020 --> 2:31:59.020]  Do you get where I'm going with this?
[2:31:59.020 --> 2:32:01.020]  I can go for thousands of hours on this.
[2:32:01.020 --> 2:32:04.020]  Let's go to the next place.
[2:32:04.020 --> 2:32:14.020]  You can have a child that's a human, 99.9%, but by changing its genetics, it's no longer a human,
[2:32:14.020 --> 2:32:18.020]  or you can splice two men, two women, put a 1%, whatever you want in there.
[2:32:18.020 --> 2:32:26.020]  And now the Senate says that, and China and the UN agree, that is not a human.
[2:32:26.020 --> 2:32:28.020]  You can have sex with it.
[2:32:28.020 --> 2:32:37.020]  So they can produce lab-made babies, or even lab-made women, up to, you know, looks like a 20-year-old woman.
[2:32:37.020 --> 2:32:39.020]  And then it's a person.
[2:32:39.020 --> 2:32:41.020]  It has the same genetics as a person.
[2:32:41.020 --> 2:32:43.020]  It's got everything.
[2:32:43.020 --> 2:32:46.020]  All it needs is social programming to be able to interact with you.
[2:32:46.020 --> 2:32:53.020]  But it's a humanoid for sex.
[2:32:53.020 --> 2:33:03.020]  Now, there it is, lab-grown vaginas implanted in four girls.
[2:33:03.020 --> 2:33:05.020]  So it's already going on.
[2:33:05.020 --> 2:33:08.020]  So it's not like you get like a chia pet.
[2:33:08.020 --> 2:33:12.020]  You put water on it and it grows, you know, hair on it or wherever, grows the plant.
[2:33:12.020 --> 2:33:19.020]  This is, you know, you get your synthetic vagina, and it's right there, and you feed it, take care of it, you know, it's right there.
[2:33:19.020 --> 2:33:21.020]  I mean, that's what they've developed, okay?
[2:33:21.020 --> 2:33:25.020]  And that's just stuff that's 20, 30 years old.
[2:33:25.020 --> 2:33:30.020]  China, everybody's coming out with designer babies where the parents go, and they go,
[2:33:30.020 --> 2:33:32.020]  oh, we don't want brown eyes.
[2:33:32.020 --> 2:33:34.020]  We want our baby to have blue eyes, or we want whatever, and that's done.
[2:33:34.020 --> 2:33:36.020]  That's already happening.
[2:33:36.020 --> 2:33:37.020]  That's already going on.
[2:33:37.020 --> 2:33:39.020]  So I'm not trying to be gross here.
[2:33:39.020 --> 2:33:42.020]  This is inherently gross.
[2:33:42.020 --> 2:33:52.020]  So to tell you about all this, to tell you about all this is going to be a gross process.
[2:33:52.020 --> 2:34:05.020]  I mean, at least 30 years ago, they created animal marine mammal cross species creatures.
[2:34:05.020 --> 2:34:14.020]  They implanted the embryos in dolphins and belugas and other re-entrants.
[2:34:14.020 --> 2:34:18.020]  And that way, when the dolphin actually had the baby, it would try to take care of it.
[2:34:18.020 --> 2:34:24.020]  And of course, for every hundred failures, they'd have the success of little humanoid dolphins.
[2:34:24.020 --> 2:34:26.020]  And then humans could interact with it.
[2:34:26.020 --> 2:34:29.020]  It had a, you know, it was like half humans, the word I got.
[2:34:29.020 --> 2:34:34.020]  So they could then train, the military could train it to go do more.
[2:34:34.020 --> 2:34:36.020]  So, you know, the military doesn't just train dolphins.
[2:34:36.020 --> 2:34:38.020]  The general military doesn't even know about this.
[2:34:38.020 --> 2:34:45.020]  They have animal human splices.
[2:34:45.020 --> 2:34:48.020]  And then those are projects that they've been running.
[2:34:48.020 --> 2:34:53.020]  So, you know, they make jokes about all this.
[2:34:53.020 --> 2:34:55.020]  You think human life's already cheap.
[2:34:55.020 --> 2:35:02.020]  They're producing life forms that are alien, that have never existed on this planet.
[2:35:02.020 --> 2:35:14.020]  And they have these gene guns that are randomly splicing trillions of different types of creatures together.
[2:35:14.020 --> 2:35:18.020]  And then they put them into an egg to feed it.
[2:35:18.020 --> 2:35:19.020]  It grows.
[2:35:19.020 --> 2:35:22.020]  They get a salmon and they go, man, this salmon's twice as big.
[2:35:22.020 --> 2:35:26.020]  And just like a horror movie, God, if you put it in another thing with another fish,
[2:35:26.020 --> 2:35:28.020]  it just tears it apart and kills it.
[2:35:28.020 --> 2:35:30.020]  It's like psychotic.
[2:35:30.020 --> 2:35:34.020]  We don't know why, because they'll just get like, well, let's try insect genes on the fish.
[2:35:34.020 --> 2:35:36.020]  Let's try plant genes.
[2:35:36.020 --> 2:35:37.020]  Let's just see.
[2:35:37.020 --> 2:35:38.020]  And they put it in an egg.
[2:35:38.020 --> 2:35:40.020]  They put it in the warm water.
[2:35:40.020 --> 2:35:42.020]  They see what hatches.
[2:35:42.020 --> 2:35:49.020]  And they go, look, we ran this on it and we got really big, a lot of meat.
[2:35:49.020 --> 2:35:52.020]  And they go, OK, well, let's keep doing that, dude.
[2:35:52.020 --> 2:35:57.020]  And then they get the fish and they start breeding a fish that'll breed with each other
[2:35:57.020 --> 2:36:06.020]  and produce eggs for another franken fish that's part insect and part asparagus.
[2:36:06.020 --> 2:36:07.020]  They don't know why.
[2:36:07.020 --> 2:36:09.020]  They just know it works.
[2:36:09.020 --> 2:36:16.020]  What could go wrong?
[2:36:16.020 --> 2:36:20.020]  So when we come back, how are they trying to get us to accept it?
[2:36:20.020 --> 2:36:26.020]  Well, you see it, full page USA Today ads, full promotion everywhere with fake news telling you
[2:36:26.020 --> 2:36:28.020]  that, oh, look at the paper.
[2:36:28.020 --> 2:36:29.020]  The clones are on the street.
[2:36:29.020 --> 2:36:30.020]  The clones are on the street.
[2:36:30.020 --> 2:36:34.020]  Well, they are on the street, but they're waiting to announce that to you.
[2:36:34.020 --> 2:36:42.020]  So first they put the fake report out so that your synapses are conditioned to accept it when it actually unfolds.
[2:36:42.020 --> 2:36:43.020]  Yeah.
[2:36:43.020 --> 2:36:46.020]  Well, they're right back.
[2:36:46.020 --> 2:36:54.020]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone for beta testing to operational.
[2:36:54.020 --> 2:36:59.020]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[2:36:59.020 --> 2:37:07.020]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[2:37:07.020 --> 2:37:08.020]  Humanity is strong.
[2:37:08.020 --> 2:37:09.020]  We're incredible.
[2:37:09.020 --> 2:37:13.020]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[2:37:13.020 --> 2:37:16.020]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[2:37:16.020 --> 2:37:17.020]  So prayer is essential.
[2:37:17.020 --> 2:37:18.020]  Research is essential.
[2:37:18.020 --> 2:37:22.020]  Getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential.
[2:37:22.020 --> 2:37:32.020]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're also funding our operation.
[2:37:32.020 --> 2:37:34.020]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:37:34.020 --> 2:37:37.020]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[2:37:37.020 --> 2:37:42.020]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vaso beats and others.
[2:37:42.020 --> 2:37:44.020]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:37:44.020 --> 2:37:47.020]  And I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[2:37:47.020 --> 2:37:52.020]  Randy Dewright.
[2:37:52.020 --> 2:37:53.020]  Randy Dewright.
[2:37:53.020 --> 2:37:54.020]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:37:54.020 --> 2:37:55.020]  Go ahead.
[2:37:55.020 --> 2:37:58.020]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your products.
[2:37:58.020 --> 2:37:59.020]  I am a granny.
[2:37:59.020 --> 2:38:08.020]  And for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[2:38:08.020 --> 2:38:14.020]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[2:38:14.020 --> 2:38:17.020]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:38:17.020 --> 2:38:25.020]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[2:38:25.020 --> 2:38:28.020]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[2:38:28.020 --> 2:38:34.020]  But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[2:38:34.020 --> 2:38:35.020]  This is working.
[2:38:35.020 --> 2:38:36.020]  This is wonderful.
[2:38:36.020 --> 2:38:40.020]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[2:38:40.020 --> 2:38:45.020]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:38:48.020 --> 2:39:00.020]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[2:39:00.020 --> 2:39:07.020]  For the first time, the BIOPROS are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[2:39:07.020 --> 2:39:14.020]  Their first product they are launching is called Bioseptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[2:39:14.020 --> 2:39:19.020]  Bioseptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[2:39:19.020 --> 2:39:21.020]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[2:39:21.020 --> 2:39:30.020]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[2:39:30.020 --> 2:39:35.020]  Bioseptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[2:39:35.020 --> 2:39:39.020]  Visit thebiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[2:39:39.020 --> 2:39:41.020]  That's thebiopros.com.
[2:39:41.020 --> 2:39:45.020]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[2:39:45.020 --> 2:40:06.020]  Thebiopros.com.
[2:40:16.020 --> 2:40:20.020]  I have the Holy Spirit.
[2:40:20.020 --> 2:40:22.020]  I'm a connection to God.
[2:40:22.020 --> 2:40:25.020]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[2:40:25.020 --> 2:40:34.020]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power out of it.
[2:40:34.020 --> 2:40:47.020]  Whether you're just a steel worker or a school teacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God. And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the Universe doesn't like.
[2:40:47.020 --> 2:41:05.020]  That's a fact.
[2:41:17.020 --> 2:41:44.020]  So imagine this globalist system where they can do anything they want, whenever they want, because there's all these new, potentially billions of new life forms, whatever they want to splice and make, that have no rights that are owned by these big corporations.
[2:41:44.020 --> 2:41:56.020]  But the big corporations need to get us to accept that, need to get us to accept giving our resources to the deep state, to the megacorporations to carry all this out.
[2:41:56.020 --> 2:42:03.020]  They need to get us to accept it so that we start buying into it and give up our humanity.
[2:42:03.020 --> 2:42:22.020]  Because the end goal isn't to turn a tomato into a GMO organism, it's to turn us into that and to corporately override us with a synthetic vaccine that goes in and literally changes our body and to get us to accept that, even though it's toxic and poisonous and bad and doesn't protect us,
[2:42:22.020 --> 2:42:28.020]  because it needs to be deadly up front to see if they can cover it up, because everything they're giving us is deadly.
[2:42:28.020 --> 2:42:36.020]  Their plan is the end of humanity, their plan is forced sterilization, their plan is they believe out of us is going to rise this new creature.
[2:42:36.020 --> 2:42:46.020]  This is like a nightmare science fiction film, but it's happening and they're just telling us to get over it.
[2:42:46.020 --> 2:42:52.020]  So this is such a key story because if you understand this, you understand it all.
[2:42:52.020 --> 2:42:59.020]  The minute I saw this Saturday morning or whatever it was, Friday night, I forget now, we can put on screen the USA Day headline.
[2:42:59.020 --> 2:43:07.020]  It was a whole fake cover on the real USA Today and it could have said Aliens land in Central Park, shocking the world.
[2:43:07.020 --> 2:43:15.020]  Boy, that'd be a big issue, but it's more than just selling the magazine or selling the newspaper.
[2:43:15.020 --> 2:43:20.020]  Imagine if they ran a headline next week, Aliens land in Central Park.
[2:43:20.020 --> 2:43:29.020]  They are hitting your mind at the first time that you're learning about this and you're reading the article and you're seeing people are fighting back.
[2:43:29.020 --> 2:43:32.020]  People don't like it. They say it's immoral.
[2:43:32.020 --> 2:43:41.020]  They're having a fake debate about this to set the parameters of the debate so that it's accepted before they actually announce what's going on.
[2:43:41.020 --> 2:43:48.020]  So they do it in a fiction vehicle so they control the parameters of the discussion.
[2:43:48.020 --> 2:43:52.020]  Yeah, this isn't news of the world saying bat child found in a cave.
[2:43:52.020 --> 2:43:58.020]  This is USA Today telling us hybrid babies born across the U.S.
[2:43:58.020 --> 2:44:06.020]  World reaction generation of half human, half animal children with both awe and concern.
[2:44:06.020 --> 2:44:08.020]  So there's awe but concern.
[2:44:08.020 --> 2:44:11.020]  Oh, so who did it? Why is it legal? Why is it going on?
[2:44:11.020 --> 2:44:17.020]  Because it's really going on, but to introduce it to you, they tell you in a fake headline with fake news.
[2:44:17.020 --> 2:44:21.020]  So that when you warn somebody at your church and say, hey, we should organize it.
[2:44:21.020 --> 2:44:24.020]  Oh, that was fake. That's that show.
[2:44:24.020 --> 2:44:28.020]  And then now it's adopted.
[2:44:28.020 --> 2:44:35.020]  And you've got to go to your church up front and hold this up and show the Psyop and tell people about the mind control.
[2:44:35.020 --> 2:44:40.020]  And then if they see it from the beginning, they'll always be in opposition to it, understand the propaganda.
[2:44:40.020 --> 2:44:49.020]  But if they get fooled by the first propaganda and get convinced it's just entertainment, that area of their brain will be manipulated where they see it as non-threatening.
[2:44:49.020 --> 2:44:51.020]  Understand?
[2:44:51.020 --> 2:44:54.020]  They're having you imprint on accepting this.
[2:44:54.020 --> 2:44:56.020]  This is mind control.
[2:44:56.020 --> 2:45:01.020]  So Senate kills GOP legislation to prohibit certain human animal chimerism.
[2:45:01.020 --> 2:45:08.020]  That is May 27.
[2:45:08.020 --> 2:45:12.020]  That's a week and a half ago.
[2:45:12.020 --> 2:45:17.020]  We have the video of the of the bill failing by 10 votes because it's already going on.
[2:45:17.020 --> 2:45:22.020]  It's been going on animal human hybrids.
[2:45:22.020 --> 2:45:27.020]  Senator Langford said we should not need to clarify in law the creating animal human hybrid is ethically unthinkable.
[2:45:27.020 --> 2:45:33.020]  But the Democrats voted it down with some Republicans joining them.
[2:45:33.020 --> 2:45:39.020]  The measure failed by 10 votes.
[2:45:39.020 --> 2:45:48.020]  The measure to federalize elections and hand over the Democrats only failed by one vote, Manchin, Mnuchin.
[2:45:48.020 --> 2:46:00.020]  So you see, right when this is happening, all the shows produced, it's already, it's theater, it's not real.
[2:46:00.020 --> 2:46:06.020]  Here's the bill, HR 6131, Human Animal Chimero Prohibition Act.
[2:46:06.020 --> 2:46:08.020]  This happened five years ago.
[2:46:08.020 --> 2:46:09.020]  They brought it back.
[2:46:09.020 --> 2:46:14.020]  It failed again, HR 6131.
[2:46:14.020 --> 2:46:22.020]  But USA Today wrapped its newspaper with a fake cover about hybrid babies with antlers to advertise a new Netflix show.
[2:46:22.020 --> 2:46:23.020]  But that's not why they did this.
[2:46:23.020 --> 2:46:28.020]  Everything Netflix does is pedophilia dehumanization, confusing you to accept this.
[2:46:28.020 --> 2:46:32.020]  This is, again, aliens land in Central Park.
[2:46:32.020 --> 2:46:33.020]  President Biden meets with them.
[2:46:33.020 --> 2:46:34.020]  You read it.
[2:46:34.020 --> 2:46:35.020]  It's a whole fake paper.
[2:46:35.020 --> 2:46:39.020]  It's all real and never tells you it's fake.
[2:46:39.020 --> 2:46:41.020]  Later, you find out that, okay, you've been gone.
[2:46:41.020 --> 2:46:44.020]  So you've been thinking, oh, my gosh, this is going on.
[2:46:44.020 --> 2:46:47.020]  And then you learn, oh, it wasn't real.
[2:46:47.020 --> 2:46:55.020]  So you have a sense of relief.
[2:46:55.020 --> 2:46:59.020]  You have a sense of relief that it wasn't real, but it was real.
[2:46:59.020 --> 2:47:08.020]  So now every time you hear that news, you have a sense of relief because your first contact with something to shock you and blow you away was then said, oh, it's just fake.
[2:47:08.020 --> 2:47:10.020]  It's okay.
[2:47:10.020 --> 2:47:11.020]  That's not just acclimating you.
[2:47:11.020 --> 2:47:15.020]  That's manipulating your brain at a very deep level.
[2:47:15.020 --> 2:47:20.020]  And that's everything these people do.
[2:47:20.020 --> 2:47:24.020]  And in the movie, I've told you they've stolen black people's identity.
[2:47:24.020 --> 2:47:31.020]  Whether it's genetic engineering or open borders or mass death or force inoculation, every corporate ad now is black people.
[2:47:31.020 --> 2:47:33.020]  That's not it, powering black people.
[2:47:33.020 --> 2:47:43.020]  And I've talked to major producers and major managers, agents, and they say, yeah, we're told only get black people now for corporate jobs.
[2:47:43.020 --> 2:47:51.020]  And in the whole movie is black people protecting white animal human hybrids who are being attacked by other evil humans.
[2:47:51.020 --> 2:47:58.020]  So black guardians are protecting the new GMO humans.
[2:47:58.020 --> 2:48:02.020]  But really, the black man is protecting Satan.
[2:48:02.020 --> 2:48:09.020]  He's protecting the horned one, the horned God in Satanism, the male counterpart.
[2:48:09.020 --> 2:48:14.020]  So all of these signs, no hybrids.
[2:48:14.020 --> 2:48:19.020]  But notice the black man he's been discriminated against.
[2:48:19.020 --> 2:48:21.020]  Yeah, three crosses on the hill.
[2:48:21.020 --> 2:48:23.020]  That's the Rose of Crucians, all of it.
[2:48:23.020 --> 2:48:28.020]  And he's there to tell you that he's been discriminated against.
[2:48:28.020 --> 2:48:32.020]  He's going to protect this.
[2:48:32.020 --> 2:48:40.020]  Just like they have the new ads with Run DMC saying, take the vaccine, fight racists, fight eugenicists that want to kill black people, fight secret experimentation.
[2:48:40.020 --> 2:48:42.020]  They're experimenting on you.
[2:48:42.020 --> 2:48:48.020]  They're killing you and they say, fight what we're doing to you as they say it.
[2:48:48.020 --> 2:48:51.020]  This is their big move.
[2:48:51.020 --> 2:48:52.020]  And here's another one.
[2:48:52.020 --> 2:48:59.020]  Fauci, Town Hall, tied to scandal involving human animal hybrid experiments with aborted fetal parts,
[2:48:59.020 --> 2:49:04.020]  grafting live parts of babies onto animals beyond Joseph Mengele.
[2:49:04.020 --> 2:49:06.020]  But it's OK.
[2:49:06.020 --> 2:49:10.020]  Creation of human monkey embryos sparks concern from.
[2:49:10.020 --> 2:49:22.020]  So here's the TV ad for the new show with its sickening, sickening little name.
[2:49:22.020 --> 2:49:28.020]  Can we talk about how cute the new hybrid babies on sweet tooth are for a second?
[2:49:28.020 --> 2:49:31.020]  This is them introducing their genetic takeover, their Satanism,
[2:49:31.020 --> 2:49:37.020]  and the new babies they're going to produce that aren't human that they can have sex with that are owned by the corporations.
[2:49:37.020 --> 2:49:40.020]  But then there'll be an outcry, then there'll be laws protecting them.
[2:49:40.020 --> 2:49:43.020]  And now the programmed creatures, the abominations they've created,
[2:49:43.020 --> 2:49:48.020]  that will be possessed by demons, literally, that will enter the avatar of these.
[2:49:48.020 --> 2:49:51.020]  They will have the highest rights and will be protected.
[2:49:51.020 --> 2:49:57.020]  Go ahead and roll the trailer.
[2:49:57.020 --> 2:50:02.020]  Some stories start at the beginning.
[2:50:02.020 --> 2:50:14.020]  Ours begins here.
[2:50:14.020 --> 2:50:21.020]  No one knew which came first.
[2:50:21.020 --> 2:50:26.020]  The hybrids or the virus.
[2:50:26.020 --> 2:50:33.020]  That question would become the biggest mystery of our lifetime.
[2:50:33.020 --> 2:50:42.020]  This is a story about a very special boy.
[2:50:42.020 --> 2:50:49.020]  A boy we come to know as sweet tooth.
[2:50:49.020 --> 2:51:05.020]  Some bad people are still out there.
[2:51:05.020 --> 2:51:11.020]  They don't like you because you're different.
[2:51:11.020 --> 2:51:15.020]  It's not just about you and me anymore.
[2:51:15.020 --> 2:51:17.020]  You have to be brave.
[2:51:17.020 --> 2:51:21.020]  The liberals are going to save the country from the spices.
[2:51:21.020 --> 2:51:23.020]  It's all the humans have been killed.
[2:51:23.020 --> 2:51:25.020]  The virus comes with hybrids.
[2:51:25.020 --> 2:51:27.020]  The word all be killed.
[2:51:27.020 --> 2:51:29.020]  And the new life form is to be released.
[2:51:29.020 --> 2:51:32.020]  Or even tell you, they will murder you and your family.
[2:51:32.020 --> 2:51:37.020]  But don't worry, you're racist if you don't let them do it.
[2:51:37.020 --> 2:51:40.020]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person,
[2:51:40.020 --> 2:51:43.020]  but because of the globalist and their attack on humanity,
[2:51:43.020 --> 2:51:46.020]  I've been forced to last 27 years to be a public figure.
[2:51:46.020 --> 2:51:49.020]  I've never given the globalist one hell of a run for their money
[2:51:49.020 --> 2:51:50.020]  because of God.
[2:51:50.020 --> 2:51:53.020]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day,
[2:51:53.020 --> 2:51:54.020]  but just give me a break.
[2:51:54.020 --> 2:51:56.020]  The Satanism is out in the open.
[2:51:56.020 --> 2:51:59.020]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight
[2:51:59.020 --> 2:52:01.020]  between good and evil is so clear.
[2:52:01.020 --> 2:52:02.020]  And I get it.
[2:52:02.020 --> 2:52:04.020]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[2:52:04.020 --> 2:52:07.020]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system.
[2:52:07.020 --> 2:52:08.020]  And I get it.
[2:52:08.020 --> 2:52:09.020]  Me too.
[2:52:09.020 --> 2:52:10.020]  Believe me, I'm one of them.
[2:52:10.020 --> 2:52:14.020]  But it's that relationship with God and just God's universe
[2:52:14.020 --> 2:52:16.020]  created that is so essential.
[2:52:16.020 --> 2:52:19.020]  And God created the universe for us to have communion
[2:52:19.020 --> 2:52:21.020]  with God through and to have life.
[2:52:21.020 --> 2:52:23.020]  And so that's what infill wars is really all about.
[2:52:23.020 --> 2:52:25.020]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[2:52:25.020 --> 2:52:27.020]  Thank you for spreading the word about infill wars.
[2:52:27.020 --> 2:52:29.020]  And thank you for supporting us to keep us on air
[2:52:29.020 --> 2:52:31.020]  by visiting infillwarstore.com.
[2:52:31.020 --> 2:52:33.020]  Because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases,
[2:52:33.020 --> 2:52:34.020]  we'll be taking off the air.
[2:52:34.020 --> 2:52:37.020]  So thank you for the support, infillwarstore.com.
[2:52:40.020 --> 2:52:43.020]  What are champions made of?
[2:52:43.020 --> 2:52:45.020]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:53:43.020 --> 2:53:59.020]  The word chimera no longer refers to an ancient mythological creature
[2:53:59.020 --> 2:54:04.020]  having the head of a lion, the torso of a goat, and a serpent tail.
[2:54:04.020 --> 2:54:07.020]  It is a scientific reality of the world today.
[2:54:07.020 --> 2:54:12.020]  Animal plant hybrids like GMO tomatoes with fish scale skin,
[2:54:12.020 --> 2:54:17.020]  hybrid viruses spliced together in a bio lab like COVID-19,
[2:54:17.020 --> 2:54:21.020]  and even human animal hybrids where human stem cells
[2:54:21.020 --> 2:54:26.020]  are inserted into animal eggs to fertilize a mutant embryo.
[2:54:26.020 --> 2:54:31.020]  Supposedly technological advances announced in the 1970s
[2:54:31.020 --> 2:54:35.020]  enable scientists today to mix the genes of different animals
[2:54:35.020 --> 2:54:37.020]  and the genes of animals and plants.
[2:54:37.020 --> 2:54:41.020]  But how long have these types of experiments been carried out
[2:54:41.020 --> 2:54:43.020]  covertly across the world?
[2:54:43.020 --> 2:54:47.020]  And what human animal chimeras have been created?
[2:54:47.020 --> 2:54:53.020]  In Russia in 1926, biologist Ilya Ivanov attempted to artificially
[2:54:53.020 --> 2:54:57.020]  inseminate women with chimp sperm, artificially inseminate
[2:54:57.020 --> 2:55:00.020]  a transplanted woman's ovary inside a female chimp,
[2:55:00.020 --> 2:55:05.020]  and he even grafted slices of ape testes onto rich aging men
[2:55:05.020 --> 2:55:08.020]  in an attempt to rejuvenate their vigor.
[2:55:08.020 --> 2:55:12.020]  It would be naive to believe this type of experimentation ever stopped
[2:55:12.020 --> 2:55:15.020]  or ceased to advance through its practice.
[2:55:15.020 --> 2:55:20.020]  Who knows what monsters have been spawned behind closed doors
[2:55:20.020 --> 2:55:23.020]  in the 20th century, but in the 21st century,
[2:55:23.020 --> 2:55:27.020]  human animal hybridization is finally creeping out into the open.
[2:55:27.020 --> 2:55:33.020]  In 2003, Chinese scientists successfully fused human cells with rabbit eggs,
[2:55:33.020 --> 2:55:39.020]  and that same year, Dr. Pan Zevos claimed to have created human cow embryos
[2:55:39.020 --> 2:55:43.020]  that could have been implanted into a woman and successfully come to term.
[2:55:43.020 --> 2:55:48.020]  In 2005, human fetal stem cells were transplanted by injection
[2:55:48.020 --> 2:55:50.020]  into the fetal cells of a sheep
[2:55:50.020 --> 2:55:53.020]  and succeeded in growing tissue of human origin.
[2:55:53.020 --> 2:55:58.020]  In 2006, human embryonic stem cells were successfully inserted
[2:55:58.020 --> 2:56:04.020]  into mouse blastosis, basically an egg, where it grew into a human mouse embryo
[2:56:04.020 --> 2:56:09.020]  in vitro that could then be implanted into a foster mouse uterus
[2:56:09.020 --> 2:56:11.020]  to complete the chimera's creation.
[2:56:11.020 --> 2:56:15.020]  In 2017, scientists created a human pig chimera,
[2:56:15.020 --> 2:56:20.020]  over 2,000 of them, that were transferred to surrogate cells.
[2:56:20.020 --> 2:56:25.020]  More than 150 of the embryos developed into chimeras that could have come to term.
[2:56:25.020 --> 2:56:30.020]  In 2018, human sheep chimeras were successfully developed
[2:56:30.020 --> 2:56:35.020]  and were allowed to grow as embryos for 28 days before being terminated.
[2:56:35.020 --> 2:56:41.020]  In April of 2021, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California
[2:56:41.020 --> 2:56:44.020]  participated in a China-led research experiment
[2:56:44.020 --> 2:56:48.020]  that successfully grew human cells and monkey embryos.
[2:56:48.020 --> 2:56:53.020]  The long-tailed macaque human creation was allowed to survive and multiply,
[2:56:53.020 --> 2:56:56.020]  growing for 19 days before terminating it.
[2:56:56.020 --> 2:57:00.020]  All to, quote, aid the study of embryonic development.
[2:57:00.020 --> 2:57:03.020]  So why not just study embryos of the same species?
[2:57:03.020 --> 2:57:05.020]  Why create a chimera?
[2:57:05.020 --> 2:57:08.020]  The research team at the Salk Institute in California,
[2:57:08.020 --> 2:57:11.020]  led by Professor Juan Carlos Belmont,
[2:57:11.020 --> 2:57:16.020]  wrote, quote, these results may help to develop effective strategies
[2:57:16.020 --> 2:57:21.020]  to improve human chimerism, an evolutionary distance species.
[2:57:21.020 --> 2:57:25.020]  In other words, they're just practicing creating human-animal hybrids
[2:57:25.020 --> 2:57:27.020]  so they can get better at it.
[2:57:27.020 --> 2:57:31.020]  Some U.S. lawmakers seek to outlaw human-animal hybrids,
[2:57:31.020 --> 2:57:35.020]  but when it came to a vote in the Senate at the end of May 2021,
[2:57:35.020 --> 2:57:41.020]  the ban on creating chimeras failed 48 to 49 along party lines.
[2:57:41.020 --> 2:57:43.020]  Why is this a divisive issue?
[2:57:43.020 --> 2:57:47.020]  Isn't the ethical question and answer clear here?
[2:57:47.020 --> 2:57:52.020]  One researcher from the Salk Institute oversaw a study funded by the NIH,
[2:57:52.020 --> 2:57:54.020]  which led to a report titled,
[2:57:54.020 --> 2:57:57.020]  Emerging Field of Human Neural Organoids,
[2:57:57.020 --> 2:57:59.020]  Transplants and Chimeras,
[2:57:59.020 --> 2:58:02.020]  Science, Ethics, and Governance.
[2:58:02.020 --> 2:58:04.020]  In reference to the title of the report,
[2:58:04.020 --> 2:58:08.020]  researchers said, quote, the term chimera is used
[2:58:08.020 --> 2:58:10.020]  because it is scientifically accurate,
[2:58:10.020 --> 2:58:15.020]  and the committee believes that its connection with the monsters of ancient myths
[2:58:15.020 --> 2:58:18.020]  is too remote to warrant avoiding its use.
[2:58:18.020 --> 2:58:24.020]  They genuinely believe mythical monsters like the half-man, half-bull minotaur,
[2:58:24.020 --> 2:58:27.020]  the half-man, half-war centaur,
[2:58:27.020 --> 2:58:31.020]  or the half-woman, half-fish mermaids will not come to mind
[2:58:31.020 --> 2:58:35.020]  in the public discourse when human-animal hybrids are announced.
[2:58:35.020 --> 2:58:46.020]  The report also says some studies of human-animal hybrids.
[2:58:46.020 --> 2:58:50.020]  It's not a secret why in the leftist-controlled cities all over the world,
[2:58:50.020 --> 2:58:53.020]  not just the U.S., they encourage people to live in tents,
[2:58:53.020 --> 2:58:57.020]  cities as homeless, and to use drugs and alcohol to engage in petty crime.
[2:58:57.020 --> 2:59:01.020]  It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030,
[2:59:01.020 --> 2:59:04.020]  of course the Great Reset, they want to lower expectations.
[2:59:04.020 --> 2:59:07.020]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere.
[2:59:07.020 --> 2:59:10.020]  They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better.
[2:59:10.020 --> 2:59:13.020]  They want you to think of a civilization that gets progressively worse.
[2:59:13.020 --> 2:59:15.020]  The globalists fly around in private jets.
[2:59:15.020 --> 2:59:17.020]  They have huge private mistakes.
[2:59:17.020 --> 2:59:19.020]  They are separate from us.
[2:59:19.020 --> 2:59:22.020]  Their children go to private tutors. They admit this.
[2:59:22.020 --> 2:59:25.020]  Now they want us locked down, telecommunicating with each other,
[2:59:25.020 --> 2:59:30.020]  so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human infrastructure.
[2:59:30.020 --> 2:59:35.020]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G has been a controlled robot in autonomous cars and trucks.
[2:59:35.020 --> 2:59:37.020]  This is all their admitted plan.
[2:59:37.020 --> 2:59:40.020]  The public is finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta.
[2:59:40.020 --> 2:59:43.020]  It's gone operational. It's a post-human future.
[2:59:43.020 --> 3:00:08.020]  You better find out about it right now.
[3:00:08.020 --> 3:00:13.020]  All right. Well, I know a lot of great people of the Christian faith,
[3:00:13.020 --> 3:00:17.020]  Catholic Protestant, you name it, and I judge a tree by its fruits, as Christ said.
[3:00:17.020 --> 3:00:21.020]  I know people like you, Jason Jones, and Owen Troyer, and George Willey,
[3:00:21.020 --> 3:00:24.020]  that I've known for 30 years protesting abortion clinics.
[3:00:24.020 --> 3:00:26.020]  Most of the Catholics I know are really hardworking, smart,
[3:00:26.020 --> 3:00:30.020]  engaged people that genuinely lead good lives and care.
[3:00:30.020 --> 3:00:36.020]  So I judge a tree by its fruits, and I like seeing John Paul II against abortion, the communist, all that.
[3:00:36.020 --> 3:00:39.020]  But now with this new pope, I wouldn't even call him a pope,
[3:00:39.020 --> 3:00:42.020]  but I'd say the guy acts like Satan's little helper,
[3:00:42.020 --> 3:00:44.020]  and some Catholics send me emails that get called,
[3:00:44.020 --> 3:00:46.020]  Oh, Jones is bashing Catholics.
[3:00:46.020 --> 3:00:49.020]  Well, if that is what a Catholic is, then yeah, I'm definitely not for it.
[3:00:49.020 --> 3:00:51.020]  But Jason Jones is a great American, a Christian.
[3:00:51.020 --> 3:00:53.020]  Also, of course, he's a Catholic.
[3:00:53.020 --> 3:00:56.020]  He's a father of seven and a grandfather of two,
[3:00:56.020 --> 3:00:59.020]  and he's a very famous filmmaker, makes some of the biggest Christian films,
[3:00:59.020 --> 3:01:01.020]  some of the biggest stars out there,
[3:01:01.020 --> 3:01:03.020]  and he's also lived in Hawaii, had to move to Texas.
[3:01:03.020 --> 3:01:07.020]  So Hawaii's under martial law. That's part two of our discussion.
[3:01:07.020 --> 3:01:09.020]  I've been wanting him on for about a month.
[3:01:09.020 --> 3:01:11.020]  He's been all over the country making two movies right now,
[3:01:11.020 --> 3:01:13.020]  so too busy to come on. We understand.
[3:01:13.020 --> 3:01:16.020]  He's here now, and I wanted to get him on about Hawaii,
[3:01:16.020 --> 3:01:18.020]  because it's a model of the lockdowns coming to the mainland,
[3:01:18.020 --> 3:01:20.020]  and we need to free Hawaii. They're great people there.
[3:01:20.020 --> 3:01:22.020]  They're doing really violations of the Nuremberg Code.
[3:01:22.020 --> 3:01:25.020]  We'll talk about that, but he wanted to get into the Catholic reset.
[3:01:25.020 --> 3:01:28.020]  That's a great way to define it, and to really walk through this.
[3:01:28.020 --> 3:01:32.020]  And you write a lot of eloquent articles, too, challenging the church,
[3:01:32.020 --> 3:01:36.020]  and really waking a lot of people up, not just Catholics,
[3:01:36.020 --> 3:01:39.020]  because it's all the major institutions are now showing who they're with.
[3:01:39.020 --> 3:01:41.020]  The New World Order has really made it to move.
[3:01:41.020 --> 3:01:43.020]  The mainline Protestant churches are,
[3:01:43.020 --> 3:01:45.020]  oh, take the vaccine. It's of God,
[3:01:45.020 --> 3:01:48.020]  and don't question the world government and the national ID,
[3:01:48.020 --> 3:01:51.020]  and just don't talk about abortion.
[3:01:51.020 --> 3:01:54.020]  So it doesn't matter what major Christian church it is,
[3:01:54.020 --> 3:01:56.020]  they're all being taken over right now.
[3:01:56.020 --> 3:01:58.020]  We can debate the history of the past all day long,
[3:01:58.020 --> 3:02:00.020]  but it's a serious situation.
[3:02:00.020 --> 3:02:03.020]  So thank you for joining us, Jason Jones.
[3:02:03.020 --> 3:02:06.020]  What's the best website just up front for folks to find all your great material?
[3:02:06.020 --> 3:02:10.020]  Well, they can go to catholicreset.com to talk about where we're talking about this,
[3:02:10.020 --> 3:02:13.020]  movietomovement.com to find all of our movies.
[3:02:13.020 --> 3:02:14.020]  Say it again, Catholic?
[3:02:14.020 --> 3:02:15.020]  Reset.com.
[3:02:15.020 --> 3:02:17.020]  Okay, so you've got the floor. You know, I'll jump in a lot,
[3:02:17.020 --> 3:02:20.020]  but try to big picture of the same stuff you told me on the phone
[3:02:20.020 --> 3:02:23.020]  and just before it went live. It really resonates with me.
[3:02:23.020 --> 3:02:25.020]  Well, Alex, first of all, when I first appeared on your show,
[3:02:25.020 --> 3:02:26.020]  I would get emails from Catholics.
[3:02:26.020 --> 3:02:29.020]  How could you go on Alex Jones' show? He's anti-Catholic.
[3:02:29.020 --> 3:02:31.020]  I'm like, he's anti-Catholic?
[3:02:31.020 --> 3:02:35.020]  My pope is silent on the genocide of Christians in Iraq,
[3:02:35.020 --> 3:02:39.020]  and Alex Jones and his audience have mobilized to speak up
[3:02:39.020 --> 3:02:42.020]  for Christians in Iraq, Catholics in Iraq,
[3:02:42.020 --> 3:02:45.020]  the oldest Catholic community in the world from the first century was in Iraq.
[3:02:45.020 --> 3:02:48.020]  Alex Jones' info wars, his audience was on it.
[3:02:48.020 --> 3:02:50.020]  So if that's anti-Catholic, I'm with Alex Jones.
[3:02:50.020 --> 3:02:53.020]  When I needed to go somewhere to talk about what was happening in the Uyghur,
[3:02:53.020 --> 3:02:58.020]  nobody in the world was talking about 3 million ethnic minorities
[3:02:58.020 --> 3:03:01.020]  in concentration camps. My pope, silent.
[3:03:01.020 --> 3:03:04.020]  Never a word from Pope Francis on the Uyghur. Silent.
[3:03:04.020 --> 3:03:06.020]  Who do they come to? Alex Jones, you have the floor.
[3:03:06.020 --> 3:03:07.020]  Talk about the Uyghur.
[3:03:07.020 --> 3:03:12.020]  And then two weeks ago, a bishop in China, his seminarians and his priests
[3:03:12.020 --> 3:03:16.020]  arrested by the Communist Party of China and sent off to a gulag,
[3:03:16.020 --> 3:03:18.020]  a concentration camp, to be reeducated.
[3:03:18.020 --> 3:03:21.020]  That's when I pinged you. Alex, can we please talk about this?
[3:03:21.020 --> 3:03:26.020]  Because our bishops in the United States are silent about one of their brother bishops
[3:03:26.020 --> 3:03:30.020]  in a concentration camp. Would St. John Paul the Great,
[3:03:30.020 --> 3:03:32.020]  would he have been silent on this? No.
[3:03:32.020 --> 3:03:35.020]  In the 80s, when I was a young boy, and I would go to synagogues
[3:03:35.020 --> 3:03:38.020]  for my friends Bar Mitzvahs, we would always pray for and talk about
[3:03:38.020 --> 3:03:40.020]  the Jews behind the iron curtain.
[3:03:40.020 --> 3:03:44.020]  Catholics were praying and fighting for Catholics behind the iron curtain.
[3:03:44.020 --> 3:03:46.020]  Pope John Paul II helped in communism.
[3:03:46.020 --> 3:03:47.020]  He helped.
[3:03:47.020 --> 3:03:49.020]  It came back later, but that, yeah.
[3:03:49.020 --> 3:03:51.020]  I played a key part. So where do I come?
[3:03:51.020 --> 3:03:55.020]  Now we're talking to your huge audience for the first time they're finding out,
[3:03:55.020 --> 3:03:56.020]  wait, what?
[3:03:56.020 --> 3:03:59.020]  A bishop of the Catholic Church was arrested last week with his priest
[3:03:59.020 --> 3:04:02.020]  and all of his seminarians and sent to a concentration camp.
[3:04:02.020 --> 3:04:04.020]  And tell folks his name. We'll pull it up.
[3:04:04.020 --> 3:04:06.020]  You know, I knew you were going to ask me that.
[3:04:06.020 --> 3:04:07.020]  I didn't write his name down right now.
[3:04:07.020 --> 3:04:09.020]  There's quite a bit. I know they rested like the whole church, basically.
[3:04:09.020 --> 3:04:11.020]  Yeah, they rested his seminarians.
[3:04:11.020 --> 3:04:13.020]  It's in your article. You listen to your article.
[3:04:13.020 --> 3:04:14.020]  Give people the article.
[3:04:14.020 --> 3:04:15.020]  I'm going to get to this.
[3:04:15.020 --> 3:04:18.020]  But yeah, if you go to thestream.org, you can find my most,
[3:04:18.020 --> 3:04:21.020]  a couple of articles ago where I have the bishop's name.
[3:04:21.020 --> 3:04:23.020]  My most recent article is where I interviewed John Gravino,
[3:04:23.020 --> 3:04:26.020]  who has a new book out called Confronting the Pope of Suspicion.
[3:04:26.020 --> 3:04:28.020]  It should be a bestseller.
[3:04:28.020 --> 3:04:32.020]  This is the guy that John Gravino, who was like, listen,
[3:04:32.020 --> 3:04:35.020]  they're going to reset the church because in the joy of love,
[3:04:35.020 --> 3:04:41.020]  a new letter from the Pope, an epistolic exhortation,
[3:04:41.020 --> 3:04:44.020]  Pope Francis said that we need to look to science,
[3:04:44.020 --> 3:04:50.020]  science, not the traditions and history and scripture to find our teachings.
[3:04:50.020 --> 3:04:54.020]  We also need to look to science. So where is this going to lead?
[3:04:54.020 --> 3:04:57.020]  That's a direct levitous attack always trying to create a scientific debate.
[3:04:57.020 --> 3:05:01.020]  When we know the real religion is this new transhumanism.
[3:05:01.020 --> 3:05:03.020]  It's transhuman. This is what scares me,
[3:05:03.020 --> 3:05:05.020]  especially when I know you covered it in detail.
[3:05:05.020 --> 3:05:09.020]  You had the, basically, the Bilderberger group met at the Vatican.
[3:05:09.020 --> 3:05:14.020]  You had Chelsea Clinton in Rome at the Vatican say that we need to
[3:05:14.020 --> 3:05:19.020]  censor anti-vax propaganda, which is the truth about the abortion.
[3:05:19.020 --> 3:05:21.020]  That's incredible that the Vatican say that.
[3:05:21.020 --> 3:05:22.020]  You're coming out of the Vatican.
[3:05:22.020 --> 3:05:24.020]  And so if you're Catholic and you're watching this and you're upset,
[3:05:24.020 --> 3:05:26.020]  you cannot be upset with the messenger.
[3:05:26.020 --> 3:05:30.020]  You have to ask yourself, how in the world could this possibly be happening?
[3:05:30.020 --> 3:05:34.020]  The day after this bishop and his seminarians are arrested,
[3:05:34.020 --> 3:05:38.020]  the day after this happens, the biggest bishop, a celebrity bishop,
[3:05:38.020 --> 3:05:40.020]  he's on all the big shows.
[3:05:40.020 --> 3:05:43.020]  His name is Bishop Robert Baron out of Los Angeles.
[3:05:43.020 --> 3:05:49.020]  The day after a huge scandal, a bishop, it's arrested by the Communist Party of China.
[3:05:49.020 --> 3:05:50.020]  What happens?
[3:05:50.020 --> 3:05:54.020]  Bishop Aaron takes to YouTube his channel with all these subscribers
[3:05:54.020 --> 3:05:56.020]  that he uses donor money to go out and cultivate.
[3:05:56.020 --> 3:06:02.020]  And he sings a song to Bob Dylan for his birthday.
[3:06:02.020 --> 3:06:04.020]  It sounds like I'm kidding.
[3:06:04.020 --> 3:06:05.020]  A joke.
[3:06:05.020 --> 3:06:06.020]  It sounds like a joke.
[3:06:06.020 --> 3:06:08.020]  This is exactly what happens.
[3:06:08.020 --> 3:06:12.020]  So now what we're having Alex is there's the anti-church that lives within the church.
[3:06:12.020 --> 3:06:13.020]  There's the world.
[3:06:13.020 --> 3:06:14.020]  There's the church.
[3:06:14.020 --> 3:06:15.020]  There's the anti-church.
[3:06:15.020 --> 3:06:19.020]  If you believe in the end times and what we as Christians believe about the end times.
[3:06:19.020 --> 3:06:20.020]  Well, there's always a counterfeit.
[3:06:20.020 --> 3:06:21.020]  Yeah.
[3:06:21.020 --> 3:06:22.020]  And there's going to be a great apostasy.
[3:06:22.020 --> 3:06:25.020]  To have a great apostasy, you have to have a church to apostatize.
[3:06:25.020 --> 3:06:27.020]  As Catholics, we believe that's the Catholic church.
[3:06:27.020 --> 3:06:33.020]  What we're seeing now is this anti-church that the Vatican did not say a peep
[3:06:33.020 --> 3:06:38.020]  when our embassy in the Vatican last week flew the pride flag.
[3:06:38.020 --> 3:06:40.020]  Well, would they do that in Saudi Arabia?
[3:06:40.020 --> 3:06:42.020]  Would they do that in Turkey?
[3:06:42.020 --> 3:06:44.020]  And if you're not Catholic, you can say, well, I support that,
[3:06:44.020 --> 3:06:47.020]  but this is the traditional teaching of the Catholic church.
[3:06:47.020 --> 3:06:50.020]  It goes in direct alignment against that.
[3:06:50.020 --> 3:06:51.020]  Yeah, direct alignment.
[3:06:51.020 --> 3:06:54.020]  So this is what John Gravano is writing about.
[3:06:54.020 --> 3:06:55.020]  We interviewed him today at the stream.
[3:06:55.020 --> 3:07:00.020]  John Smirak and I, that we as Catholics and all Christians need to be concerned about this
[3:07:00.020 --> 3:07:03.020]  because where the Catholic church goes, you'll see so many denominations go.
[3:07:03.020 --> 3:07:05.020]  You used to see this with the Anglican church.
[3:07:05.020 --> 3:07:06.020]  It's the biggest domino.
[3:07:06.020 --> 3:07:11.020]  I mean, if it goes for the New World Order and goes for homosexuality being taught in schools and everything,
[3:07:11.020 --> 3:07:12.020]  I mean, it's over.
[3:07:12.020 --> 3:07:14.020]  We have to protect our children.
[3:07:14.020 --> 3:07:17.020]  And this is what it's about in the last segment.
[3:07:17.020 --> 3:07:19.020]  And in my book with John Smirak, The Race to Save Our Century,
[3:07:19.020 --> 3:07:24.020]  we say the first thing we can do to defeat all ideologies of evil, all cabals, all conspiracies,
[3:07:24.020 --> 3:07:29.020]  the first thing we need to do, all of us, is promote the truth about the human person
[3:07:29.020 --> 3:07:33.020]  that each and every one of us has an inviolable dignity and beauty and worth.
[3:07:33.020 --> 3:07:38.020]  And incomparable to every human person is worth more than everything and anything you will ever say.
[3:07:38.020 --> 3:07:39.020]  I'll explain.
[3:07:39.020 --> 3:07:43.020]  That's what's under assault is the sanctity of life and the sovereignty of humans built by God,
[3:07:43.020 --> 3:07:44.020]  the image, the Creator.
[3:07:44.020 --> 3:07:47.020]  If we don't accept that and have respect for ourselves, everything collapses.
[3:07:47.020 --> 3:07:48.020]  Everything collapses.
[3:07:48.020 --> 3:07:49.020]  So they got two games.
[3:07:49.020 --> 3:07:54.020]  They're destroying human dignity by coming up with a million genders and you can choose your identity
[3:07:54.020 --> 3:07:57.020]  and all of this thing, what they're really doing is they're undermining our dignity
[3:07:57.020 --> 3:07:59.020]  because we all are equal in dignity.
[3:07:59.020 --> 3:08:03.020]  Because our identity is what, that we're made in the image of God.
[3:08:03.020 --> 3:08:07.020]  So they're undermining the image of God with all of the subhumanist, disgusting nonsense.
[3:08:07.020 --> 3:08:12.020]  And the second thing they're doing is they're obliterating the idea of authentic solidarity.
[3:08:12.020 --> 3:08:13.020]  What is authentic solidarity?
[3:08:13.020 --> 3:08:15.020]  You see it on Info Wars all the time.
[3:08:15.020 --> 3:08:19.020]  It's standing up for people who are being bullied by very powerful interests.
[3:08:19.020 --> 3:08:21.020]  It's standing up for the Uyghur.
[3:08:21.020 --> 3:08:24.020]  It's standing up for the Chaldeans, the Christians, the Yazidis, the child in the womb,
[3:08:24.020 --> 3:08:28.020]  the unwet team mother, standing with our neighbors without homes,
[3:08:28.020 --> 3:08:31.020]  people with drug addiction, going to prison ministry.
[3:08:31.020 --> 3:08:32.020]  This is difficult stuff.
[3:08:32.020 --> 3:08:33.020]  It's authentic solidarity.
[3:08:33.020 --> 3:08:36.020]  But what they do is they have woke ideology where we're all guilty
[3:08:36.020 --> 3:08:39.020]  and where everyone is guilty, nobody's responsible.
[3:08:39.020 --> 3:08:45.020]  So none of us are responsible because we're all guilty and there's structural racism.
[3:08:45.020 --> 3:08:50.020]  So what that does is in Hannah Errant in 1945, before World War II,
[3:08:50.020 --> 3:08:54.020]  was even over the great Jewish political philosopher Hannah Errant wrote.
[3:08:54.020 --> 3:08:57.020]  They're trying to say all Germans are guilty for the crimes of the Nazis.
[3:08:57.020 --> 3:09:01.020]  Well, if all Germans are guilty, then Hitler is no more or less guilty
[3:09:01.020 --> 3:09:04.020]  than any other German, even the anti-fascists.
[3:09:04.020 --> 3:09:06.020]  Well, that's what the left says, like all whites are bad.
[3:09:06.020 --> 3:09:10.020]  And then what you do there is you actually create what you claim you're opposing.
[3:09:10.020 --> 3:09:13.020]  Yeah, what you're doing is you're exempting from responsibility
[3:09:13.020 --> 3:09:17.020]  people who are actually racist, people who are actually guilty.
[3:09:17.020 --> 3:09:21.020]  And when you obliterate solidarity, which you see with Pope Francis,
[3:09:21.020 --> 3:09:26.020]  Pope Francis had billionaire NBA owners and millionaire NBA players
[3:09:26.020 --> 3:09:28.020]  sponsored by Nike.
[3:09:28.020 --> 3:09:31.020]  Nike uses Uyghur slaves to make their shoes.
[3:09:31.020 --> 3:09:36.020]  They brought them to the Vatican to talk about structural racism in America.
[3:09:36.020 --> 3:09:39.020]  Well, when you're talking about structural racism again, everyone's responsible.
[3:09:39.020 --> 3:09:42.020]  Exactly. Stay there. We'll be right back. Stay there.
[3:09:45.020 --> 3:09:48.020]  My enemies are your enemies.
[3:09:48.020 --> 3:09:50.020]  They're the globalistic extremists.
[3:09:50.020 --> 3:09:55.020]  They are a consortium of mad scientist pedophiles controlled for each devil or spurs.
[3:09:55.020 --> 3:10:00.020]  Vampires, wherever you want to call them, that are highly predatory
[3:10:00.020 --> 3:10:03.020]  and are setting up a false famously land system
[3:10:03.020 --> 3:10:09.020]  of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs and electromagnetic radiation
[3:10:09.020 --> 3:10:14.020]  to change the very DNA of the human species to mutate us
[3:10:14.020 --> 3:10:19.020]  into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[3:10:19.020 --> 3:10:22.020]  The bottom line is they want to play God. They are playing God.
[3:10:22.020 --> 3:10:26.020]  And the news is only going to tie it around our necks from here on out.
[3:10:26.020 --> 3:10:28.020]  So many other people want to be positive.
[3:10:28.020 --> 3:10:32.020]  They want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited amounts
[3:10:32.020 --> 3:10:33.020]  of what's happening with New World Order.
[3:10:33.020 --> 3:10:36.020]  But at the end of the day, it's all about the population.
[3:10:36.020 --> 3:10:37.020]  It's all about world government.
[3:10:37.020 --> 3:10:40.020]  It's all about the end of the human system as we know it.
[3:10:40.020 --> 3:10:44.020]  And on its actions, a nightmare being built only admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[3:10:44.020 --> 3:10:47.020]  This is a Breaking Friday News Alert.
[3:10:47.020 --> 3:10:50.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, the New World Order is in deep trouble.
[3:10:50.020 --> 3:10:56.020]  Their entire program of launching COVID-19 to launch the Great Reset is coming out.
[3:10:56.020 --> 3:11:01.020]  But they are launching massive hack attacks against infrastructure around the world to divert us.
[3:11:01.020 --> 3:11:04.020]  They're also trying to start a major race war to divert us.
[3:11:04.020 --> 3:11:10.020]  And Joe Biden is running around claiming that he cured COVID-19 because of the vaccine, the fact that we wore masks.
[3:11:10.020 --> 3:11:17.020]  No, all they did was lower as soon as he got into office the PCR test from 40 cycles down to 29 or 28.
[3:11:17.020 --> 3:11:21.020]  If you lowered it down to 29 or 28, almost everyone is false negative.
[3:11:21.020 --> 3:11:24.020]  If you raise it to 40, almost everyone is false positive.
[3:11:24.020 --> 3:11:29.020]  This is all a scam that makes Enron look like child's play.
[3:11:29.020 --> 3:11:34.020]  Only by exposing these criminals will we stop the worldwide lockdowns and stop future lockdowns.
[3:11:34.020 --> 3:11:36.020]  That's why it's us or them.
[3:11:36.020 --> 3:11:40.020]  The globalists either get exposed and go to prison or the Great Reset wins and we're all dead.
[3:11:40.020 --> 3:11:48.020]  I'm Alex Jones. This is the info war.
[3:11:48.020 --> 3:11:56.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:11:56.020 --> 3:12:15.020]  All right, Jason Jones is with us. She's got a big voice out there.
[3:12:15.020 --> 3:12:18.020]  We're talking about what's going on.
[3:12:18.020 --> 3:12:24.020]  One of the most powerful institutions in the world and the really one of the oldest Christian institutions.
[3:12:24.020 --> 3:12:26.020]  It's the Catholic Church.
[3:12:26.020 --> 3:12:29.020]  Look, you can criticize it in problems and a lot of big stuff.
[3:12:29.020 --> 3:12:31.020]  We've been critical of things that go on there.
[3:12:31.020 --> 3:12:34.020]  But when you got this new so-called pope and this Jesuit pope,
[3:12:34.020 --> 3:12:39.020]  it was like the leftist press worldwide went from being anti-Catholic, anti-Catholic church,
[3:12:39.020 --> 3:12:42.020]  to being just worshipful.
[3:12:42.020 --> 3:12:45.020]  The only other guy they will love more is like Fauci.
[3:12:45.020 --> 3:12:49.020]  You were telling me during the break when he slapped that Chinese lady's hand, it was her bringing up the Uyghur.
[3:12:49.020 --> 3:12:53.020]  That's what we're told is she was bringing up the Uyghur and there's this secret deal between the Vatican and China.
[3:12:53.020 --> 3:12:54.020]  We know nothing about it.
[3:12:54.020 --> 3:12:58.020]  I've heard from people in the hierarchy that it's a billion dollar a year cash transfer.
[3:12:58.020 --> 3:13:03.020]  I don't know that, but people I trust in the hierarchy have told me that that's in fact what the deal is.
[3:13:03.020 --> 3:13:08.020]  We do know that Pope Francis has not said a single word about the Uyghur publicly.
[3:13:08.020 --> 3:13:13.020]  And one of his encyclicals, he included the Uyghur in a list of about 150 other issues.
[3:13:13.020 --> 3:13:20.020]  He put them in there, but he's never said anything about 3 million ethnic minorities in concentration camps,
[3:13:20.020 --> 3:13:23.020]  including their organs harvested, being forced to pick cotton.
[3:13:23.020 --> 3:13:26.020]  Yes, pick cotton and stitched together shoes.
[3:13:26.020 --> 3:13:27.020]  Absolutely silent.
[3:13:27.020 --> 3:13:33.020]  Silent on the thousands of Catholic human rights freedom activists in Hong Kong.
[3:13:33.020 --> 3:13:36.020]  And those people are there praying to God.
[3:13:36.020 --> 3:13:38.020]  I believe it's the same God.
[3:13:38.020 --> 3:13:40.020]  They're praying to God to save them.
[3:13:40.020 --> 3:13:44.020]  It's our job that God has to work through us to bring attention to this, to stop it.
[3:13:44.020 --> 3:13:49.020]  Yeah, prior to the election of President Trump, I went to Iraq and I did a documentary on the genocide.
[3:13:49.020 --> 3:13:54.020]  And it was a documentary we made just for the new administration, private documentary.
[3:13:54.020 --> 3:13:59.020]  While we were there, we went to a camp where Chaldean Christians were being held.
[3:13:59.020 --> 3:14:00.020]  And they are Catholics.
[3:14:00.020 --> 3:14:03.020]  They're the Chaldean rights and they're in the Catholic Church.
[3:14:03.020 --> 3:14:09.020]  And a priest with tears in his eyes as we were looking at children play in the camp,
[3:14:09.020 --> 3:14:16.020]  he said, why is our Pope beaming images of wild animals onto the walls of St. Peter's
[3:14:16.020 --> 3:14:21.020]  and not beaming those children, not a word from our Pope on what's happening here.
[3:14:21.020 --> 3:14:26.020]  Of course, years and years after President Trump, through his leadership and the use of our military,
[3:14:26.020 --> 3:14:33.020]  destroyed for a time the Caliphate, because Trump made Iraq safe,
[3:14:33.020 --> 3:14:36.020]  or Francis was able to go to Iraq.
[3:14:36.020 --> 3:14:41.020]  And I don't know if my article played a role in this, but I published an article that was in Arabic, Alex.
[3:14:41.020 --> 3:14:43.020]  It was all over Iraq in the week leading up to his visits.
[3:14:43.020 --> 3:14:46.020]  His first words out of his mouth better be, I'm sorry.
[3:14:46.020 --> 3:14:49.020]  And when Francis landed the first words out of his mouth where I'm sorry,
[3:14:49.020 --> 3:14:54.020]  well, there's no evidence of any sort of contrition because he has still been silent on the Uighur.
[3:14:54.020 --> 3:14:57.020]  You know, it says in Scripture, we should love our enemy.
[3:14:57.020 --> 3:14:59.020]  Grace builds upon nature.
[3:14:59.020 --> 3:15:00.020]  It is natural.
[3:15:00.020 --> 3:15:01.020]  You don't need to be a Christian.
[3:15:01.020 --> 3:15:04.020]  You don't need grace to love your own.
[3:15:04.020 --> 3:15:06.020]  He's been silent on the Uighur.
[3:15:06.020 --> 3:15:08.020]  Okay, that's not your own.
[3:15:08.020 --> 3:15:13.020]  He has been silent on prominent Catholic laymen arrested in Hong Kong,
[3:15:13.020 --> 3:15:15.020]  and now a bishop arrested.
[3:15:15.020 --> 3:15:17.020]  Bishop, you asked the name.
[3:15:17.020 --> 3:15:19.020]  It's Bishop Joseph.
[3:15:19.020 --> 3:15:20.020]  Why's you?
[3:15:20.020 --> 3:15:22.020]  My wife is Chinese, but I know I butchered the name.
[3:15:22.020 --> 3:15:25.020]  And I apologize for that.
[3:15:25.020 --> 3:15:27.020]  Silent.
[3:15:27.020 --> 3:15:29.020]  It's natural to fight for your own, right?
[3:15:29.020 --> 3:15:31.020]  We all fight for our own.
[3:15:31.020 --> 3:15:33.020]  This is his own.
[3:15:33.020 --> 3:15:37.020]  Alex, what would you do if one of your employees was doing a report and shot?
[3:15:37.020 --> 3:15:38.020]  He'd be going crazy.
[3:15:38.020 --> 3:15:39.020]  To a concentration camp.
[3:15:39.020 --> 3:15:40.020]  What would you do?
[3:15:40.020 --> 3:15:43.020]  If Ellen Schreuer or anybody was in a concentration camp or you're not even an employee,
[3:15:43.020 --> 3:15:45.020]  if you were in there, I'd be talking about it every day.
[3:15:45.020 --> 3:15:46.020]  Every day.
[3:15:46.020 --> 3:15:48.020]  Francis is their shepherd.
[3:15:48.020 --> 3:15:50.020]  Absolute silence.
[3:15:50.020 --> 3:15:51.020]  Absolute silence.
[3:15:51.020 --> 3:15:53.020]  So what does this mean for us as Christians?
[3:15:53.020 --> 3:15:54.020]  I love the Catholic Church.
[3:15:54.020 --> 3:16:00.020]  I am a Catholic, but I don't want people to confuse certain individuals,
[3:16:00.020 --> 3:16:02.020]  even in a hierarchy, for what is the Church.
[3:16:02.020 --> 3:16:06.020]  You have to go all the way back and look at Scripture, look at the first century,
[3:16:06.020 --> 3:16:10.020]  apostolic succession going back from every pope and every bishop till today.
[3:16:10.020 --> 3:16:13.020]  You can trace them all the way back to the first century.
[3:16:13.020 --> 3:16:19.020]  You can look at all of the beautiful fruit that our civilization has that has come from the Catholic Church.
[3:16:19.020 --> 3:16:24.020]  Even, you know, it's for 1,500 years of monks writing the Gospel out by hand,
[3:16:24.020 --> 3:16:27.020]  writing out the entire Old and New Testament by hand.
[3:16:27.020 --> 3:16:29.020]  That's how we have Scripture today.
[3:16:29.020 --> 3:16:35.020]  It's hospitals and the free market and all these wonderful inventions that were invented by actually by priests.
[3:16:35.020 --> 3:16:38.020]  The ending of serfdom, the ending of slavery.
[3:16:38.020 --> 3:16:41.020]  Even our Declaration of Independence, we hold these truths to be self-evident.
[3:16:41.020 --> 3:16:43.020]  All men are endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights.
[3:16:43.020 --> 3:16:47.020]  The vision of the human person, the founding fathers thought is of self-evident.
[3:16:47.020 --> 3:16:48.020]  They thought it was self-evident.
[3:16:48.020 --> 3:16:50.020]  It is not self-evident.
[3:16:50.020 --> 3:16:53.020]  That vision of the human person, that our founding fathers saw as self-evident,
[3:16:53.020 --> 3:16:55.020]  was the Christian vision of the human person.
[3:16:55.020 --> 3:16:56.020]  That's right.
[3:16:56.020 --> 3:16:57.020]  The left's telling us we're just animals.
[3:16:57.020 --> 3:16:58.020]  It's not self-evident.
[3:16:58.020 --> 3:17:00.020]  We can be made into corporate commodities and clones.
[3:17:00.020 --> 3:17:02.020]  We have to say, no, I am, I am self-evident.
[3:17:02.020 --> 3:17:06.020]  I'm sovereign because God made me, I am not your slave because I belong to God.
[3:17:06.020 --> 3:17:08.020]  Yeah, we're all, I wish.
[3:17:08.020 --> 3:17:12.020]  My biggest, what I love about doing so much pro-life work and all my pro-life movies is,
[3:17:12.020 --> 3:17:19.020]  the one thing I wish everyone on earth could understand is how incomparably beautiful they are.
[3:17:19.020 --> 3:17:21.020]  How unimaginably beautiful they are.
[3:17:21.020 --> 3:17:26.020]  I woke up this morning, I was reading, first thing in the morning, the sun was rising, I'm watching deer.
[3:17:26.020 --> 3:17:29.020]  The deer were beautiful and I was just in awe.
[3:17:29.020 --> 3:17:32.020]  Then I went into the house, got some coffee, did a few chores and I came out.
[3:17:32.020 --> 3:17:36.020]  And then now my daughter and her friends were playing in the very same place those deer were.
[3:17:36.020 --> 3:17:43.020]  And I thought, the chasm and beauty between my daughter and her friends and those deer is unbelievable.
[3:17:43.020 --> 3:17:45.020]  It's infinite, that chasm and beauty.
[3:17:45.020 --> 3:17:50.020]  Because as beautiful as those deer were, they're not made in the image of God.
[3:17:50.020 --> 3:17:53.020]  My daughter and her friends, they're that precious.
[3:17:53.020 --> 3:17:55.020]  And what accounts for that?
[3:17:55.020 --> 3:18:01.020]  The only explanation that we can find that in any revealed religion or any philosophy is what the Christian faith teaches.
[3:18:01.020 --> 3:18:03.020]  Because we are made in the image of God.
[3:18:03.020 --> 3:18:04.020]  That's a fact.
[3:18:04.020 --> 3:18:06.020]  And look what we can build and do, we're pretty amazing.
[3:18:06.020 --> 3:18:07.020]  We're amazing.
[3:18:07.020 --> 3:18:09.020]  That's what they tell us, we're crap all day.
[3:18:09.020 --> 3:18:12.020]  No, we're only crap because we're falling and forgotten our power through God.
[3:18:12.020 --> 3:18:13.020]  Yeah, no, I mean, come on.
[3:18:13.020 --> 3:18:16.020]  Your friend wants to go to Mars, he's got to go to Mars.
[3:18:16.020 --> 3:18:19.020]  You know, we have a battle going on right now in the world.
[3:18:19.020 --> 3:18:21.020]  I say there's two visions of the world.
[3:18:21.020 --> 3:18:23.020]  This might strike you as funny.
[3:18:23.020 --> 3:18:25.020]  I'm going to leave the Catholic faith for a second.
[3:18:25.020 --> 3:18:27.020]  There's Bill Gates and Elon Musk.
[3:18:27.020 --> 3:18:32.020]  Elon Musk is a boy, said he wants everyone to have a big family.
[3:18:32.020 --> 3:18:33.020]  But how can that happen?
[3:18:33.020 --> 3:18:34.020]  We have limited resources on that planet.
[3:18:34.020 --> 3:18:37.020]  He goes, we have to colonize space.
[3:18:37.020 --> 3:18:39.020]  Bill Gates said, there's too many people.
[3:18:39.020 --> 3:18:46.020]  We need to force people to have abortions, force them to have contraception, treat them like animals, human beings.
[3:18:46.020 --> 3:18:49.020]  And that's why these chimeras and stuff, people go, that'll never happen.
[3:18:49.020 --> 3:18:53.020]  How many times do we, as Christians, whenever you hear of anything that we can imagine,
[3:18:53.020 --> 3:18:55.020]  never say that can never happen.
[3:18:55.020 --> 3:18:56.020]  That's weird.
[3:18:56.020 --> 3:18:57.020]  And we'll do it.
[3:18:57.020 --> 3:18:58.020]  And it's scary.
[3:18:58.020 --> 3:19:00.020]  And we're builders, big builders.
[3:19:00.020 --> 3:19:03.020]  Yeah, we fell, but we're made in the image of God.
[3:19:03.020 --> 3:19:07.020]  So anything you read in a science fiction novel or anything that you see on Info Wars,
[3:19:07.020 --> 3:19:09.020]  a friend of mine said about you last night at a dinner party.
[3:19:09.020 --> 3:19:11.020]  I said, I was going to come on.
[3:19:11.020 --> 3:19:17.020]  He said, the only problem with Alex Jones is 2020 proved he didn't go far enough.
[3:19:17.020 --> 3:19:19.020]  He didn't see what was coming.
[3:19:19.020 --> 3:19:20.020]  None of us did.
[3:19:20.020 --> 3:19:22.020]  What they said were conspiracy theories.
[3:19:22.020 --> 3:19:23.020]  I saw a meme.
[3:19:23.020 --> 3:19:25.020]  What's a conspiracy theory?
[3:19:25.020 --> 3:19:28.020]  The difference between a conspiracy theory and the truth.
[3:19:28.020 --> 3:19:29.020]  Four months.
[3:19:29.020 --> 3:19:30.020]  Right?
[3:19:30.020 --> 3:19:35.020]  We read these things in science fiction novels 100 years ago, and it's like history to us already.
[3:19:35.020 --> 3:19:38.020]  And by the way, the Deep Illuminati, they know this.
[3:19:38.020 --> 3:19:43.020]  That's why they said that they created science fiction to pre-program so they can put out ideas
[3:19:43.020 --> 3:19:46.020]  knowing that we would then manifest it and basically follow their plan.
[3:19:46.020 --> 3:19:51.020]  So it's like they write the plan and then we follow it, but it's a very satanic plan.
[3:19:51.020 --> 3:19:52.020]  Yes.
[3:19:52.020 --> 3:19:54.020]  So in the Catholic Church, there's this prophecy.
[3:19:54.020 --> 3:19:58.020]  It's something called Fatima where they talk about the errors of Russia will spread around the whole world.
[3:19:58.020 --> 3:20:01.020]  And this is where I want to talk about the difference between the anti-church and the world.
[3:20:01.020 --> 3:20:03.020]  The anti-church is what you said is the Illuminati.
[3:20:03.020 --> 3:20:07.020]  These aren't people who don't believe in God or secular humanists.
[3:20:07.020 --> 3:20:09.020]  Those are very honest people.
[3:20:09.020 --> 3:20:13.020]  By the way, if I didn't believe in God and I was a secular humanist, I would be a transhumanist
[3:20:13.020 --> 3:20:16.020]  because I would want us to live forever. I would want all of this.
[3:20:16.020 --> 3:20:22.020]  No, but these people you're talking about, they are anti-church, anti-logos, dark logos.
[3:20:22.020 --> 3:20:25.020]  They are rejecting God, rejecting truth.
[3:20:25.020 --> 3:20:26.020]  Because they want to be God.
[3:20:26.020 --> 3:20:28.020]  They don't deny that it's real.
[3:20:28.020 --> 3:20:29.020]  No, they know.
[3:20:29.020 --> 3:20:30.020]  They know.
[3:20:30.020 --> 3:20:33.020]  Well, let's talk about that when we come back because that is really the key to all this.
[3:20:33.020 --> 3:20:36.020]  And the question the listeners is, do you want to be putty in their hands?
[3:20:36.020 --> 3:20:39.020]  Because, you know, God's the great claymaker. God's the person that formed us.
[3:20:39.020 --> 3:20:41.020]  They want to go, no, get out of the way, God. We're going to form things.
[3:20:41.020 --> 3:20:43.020]  I say you'll have a right to do that.
[3:20:43.020 --> 3:20:49.020]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:20:49.020 --> 3:20:55.020]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:20:55.020 --> 3:20:58.020]  and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[3:20:58.020 --> 3:21:03.020]  You know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:21:03.020 --> 3:21:08.020]  But it's true. We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:21:08.020 --> 3:21:10.020]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:21:10.020 --> 3:21:14.020]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups.
[3:21:14.020 --> 3:21:18.020]  And we're still here. And as this whole new world order comes out and be open,
[3:21:18.020 --> 3:21:21.020]  our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:21:21.020 --> 3:21:23.020]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:21:23.020 --> 3:21:27.020]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America is still quasi-free.
[3:21:27.020 --> 3:21:32.020]  You can't have Info Wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:21:32.020 --> 3:21:35.020]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:21:35.020 --> 3:21:39.020]  So thank you all. And get an infowarstore.com. Get some great 2020 election shirts.
[3:21:39.020 --> 3:21:44.020]  Supplement them so much more. They're wonderful products, and they support the Info War. Thank you.
[3:21:44.020 --> 3:21:48.020]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[3:21:48.020 --> 3:21:52.020]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[3:21:52.020 --> 3:21:55.020]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck.
[3:21:55.020 --> 3:22:00.020]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[3:22:00.020 --> 3:22:05.020]  So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[3:22:05.020 --> 3:22:12.020]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt.
[3:22:12.020 --> 3:22:17.020]  Get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[3:22:17.020 --> 3:22:24.020]  I need your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[3:22:24.020 --> 3:22:34.020]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[3:22:34.020 --> 3:22:41.020]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity.
[3:22:41.020 --> 3:22:45.020]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God. Thank you so much.
[3:22:45.020 --> 3:22:51.020]  Fourteen months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[3:22:51.020 --> 3:22:58.020]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world,
[3:22:58.020 --> 3:23:03.020]  it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world.
[3:23:03.020 --> 3:23:07.020]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States.
[3:23:07.020 --> 3:23:14.020]  That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down.
[3:23:14.020 --> 3:23:17.020]  Plus, the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down along with other pipelines.
[3:23:17.020 --> 3:23:20.020]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[3:23:20.020 --> 3:23:23.020]  We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well.
[3:23:23.020 --> 3:23:26.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[3:23:26.020 --> 3:23:29.020]  The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed.
[3:23:29.020 --> 3:23:34.020]  Until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-com takeover, Gregory said, you have no hope.
[3:23:34.020 --> 3:23:39.020]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[3:23:39.020 --> 3:23:44.020]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[3:23:46.020 --> 3:23:54.020]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim
[3:23:54.020 --> 3:24:01.020]  so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[3:24:01.020 --> 3:24:10.020]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[3:24:10.020 --> 3:24:14.020]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset,
[3:24:14.020 --> 3:24:18.020]  or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband,
[3:24:18.020 --> 3:24:22.020]  or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music,
[3:24:22.020 --> 3:24:26.020]  the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic,
[3:24:26.020 --> 3:24:30.020]  and that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[3:24:30.020 --> 3:24:35.020]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things in the system,
[3:24:35.020 --> 3:24:38.020]  but worship the things of God because we're made by God.
[3:24:38.020 --> 3:24:44.020]  And appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[3:24:44.020 --> 3:24:49.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:25:14.020 --> 3:25:21.020]  You got it flat there.
[3:25:21.020 --> 3:25:24.020]  This is where I was even on air though, it's crazy.
[3:25:24.020 --> 3:25:28.020]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Jason Jones is here with us, major filmmaker.
[3:25:28.020 --> 3:25:34.020]  We have a lot of stuff going on, a lot of irons on the fire, but you've been on fire talking about
[3:25:34.020 --> 3:25:45.020]  God's plan and how we just have to simply accept it and be aware of the choice,
[3:25:45.020 --> 3:25:49.020]  but they try to keep us where we don't even know there's a free will choice that we've got to make.
[3:25:49.020 --> 3:25:54.020]  So much of getting people to realize there is a spiritual realm, it's been mathematically proven,
[3:25:54.020 --> 3:25:57.020]  it's there, it's happening, we've got to make a choice and choose Christ.
[3:25:57.020 --> 3:26:04.020]  Yeah, the great evangelical theologian and thinker Francis Schaeffer said,
[3:26:04.020 --> 3:26:07.020]  in our age we need to do what he called pre-evangelization,
[3:26:07.020 --> 3:26:10.020]  that people don't even know they're worthy of mercy, worthy of love.
[3:26:10.020 --> 3:26:13.020]  And so that's kind of, I just think where we are now.
[3:26:13.020 --> 3:26:19.020]  And I saw Owen, I was at this, Abbey Johnson and I and 20 students from Students for Life of America went
[3:26:19.020 --> 3:26:23.020]  to do a counter protest to the abortion industry's event at the Capitol.
[3:26:23.020 --> 3:26:28.020]  You said it was suppressing 20,000 people were there and as I was there and I gave my speech
[3:26:28.020 --> 3:26:33.020]  and I looked out at the crowd, there was one girl, her face was tattooed like a leopard, her whole face.
[3:26:33.020 --> 3:26:36.020]  And I went to take a picture of her and I was going to say something snarky,
[3:26:36.020 --> 3:26:42.020]  but I looked at her and her shoulders were rolled forward and she was just slunched over and alone with her sign.
[3:26:42.020 --> 3:26:43.020]  And I just said, you're beautiful.
[3:26:43.020 --> 3:26:48.020]  And I took the picture and in my speech, I said, you know, I was an atheist, so I was 30.
[3:26:48.020 --> 3:26:53.020]  But if I was an atheist right now and I was talking all the pro-bores and looked at you,
[3:26:53.020 --> 3:26:55.020]  I'd have to believe in God because you're magnificent.
[3:26:55.020 --> 3:26:56.020]  Look at her.
[3:26:56.020 --> 3:26:57.020]  Look around.
[3:26:57.020 --> 3:26:58.020]  Look at yourself.
[3:26:58.020 --> 3:26:59.020]  You're so beautiful.
[3:26:59.020 --> 3:27:00.020]  You're so unique.
[3:27:00.020 --> 3:27:01.020]  Each one of you is different.
[3:27:01.020 --> 3:27:07.020]  The only ones that didn't have that kind of beauty and sadness, they were, we talked about it off air,
[3:27:07.020 --> 3:27:14.020]  all these guys, men, grown men, white men, fit men, they were wearing shirts that said, Hail Satan.
[3:27:14.020 --> 3:27:18.020]  I think you see it in Owen's video, Hail Satan, shirts.
[3:27:18.020 --> 3:27:20.020]  I mean, signs that said Hail Satan.
[3:27:20.020 --> 3:27:22.020]  Oh, they came over and threatened Owen.
[3:27:22.020 --> 3:27:27.020]  And exactly, they see a bunch of sheep, leaderless women, who are captured by the Stichonic Force and they're there to feed on them.
[3:27:27.020 --> 3:27:28.020]  Yeah, it was gross.
[3:27:28.020 --> 3:27:29.020]  You're right.
[3:27:29.020 --> 3:27:34.020]  When you had mentioned it off one, how beautiful and unique so many of the marchers were on the pro-bortion side,
[3:27:34.020 --> 3:27:36.020]  but not the guys with the signs.
[3:27:36.020 --> 3:27:37.020]  There were two types of folks there.
[3:27:37.020 --> 3:27:41.020]  Those that were just seemed like furious and angry and cruel.
[3:27:41.020 --> 3:27:44.020]  And then others that were just kind of lonely and broken.
[3:27:44.020 --> 3:27:46.020]  The woman with her face tattooed was she had no friends.
[3:27:46.020 --> 3:27:47.020]  She had her sign.
[3:27:47.020 --> 3:27:48.020]  She was by herself.
[3:27:48.020 --> 3:27:53.020]  And I bet that that day I was the only person that looked her in the eyes and talked to her.
[3:27:53.020 --> 3:27:56.020]  And you know, people think I have a lot of irons in the fire because I'm a columnist.
[3:27:56.020 --> 3:27:57.020]  I have a podcast.
[3:27:57.020 --> 3:27:59.020]  I make movies, but I have one iron, one iron.
[3:27:59.020 --> 3:28:02.020]  Since I was 17 and my high school girlfriend was forced to have an abortion.
[3:28:02.020 --> 3:28:05.020]  I said, I just want to protect the vulnerable.
[3:28:05.020 --> 3:28:07.020]  I just want to tell people how beautiful they were.
[3:28:07.020 --> 3:28:12.020]  I was an atheist, so I was an iron-rand objectivist and I knew humans had this dignity.
[3:28:12.020 --> 3:28:18.020]  I didn't know where it came from and just self-evident, axiomatic until I finally, by God's grace, became a Christian.
[3:28:18.020 --> 3:28:22.020]  I just want everyone to know the source of their dignity and their beauty.
[3:28:22.020 --> 3:28:26.020]  And there's nothing more wonderful without a God even.
[3:28:26.020 --> 3:28:28.020]  Really, what are we?
[3:28:28.020 --> 3:28:31.020]  We don't believe we're incredible and have goals.
[3:28:31.020 --> 3:28:32.020]  We're nothing.
[3:28:32.020 --> 3:28:35.020]  That's why people commit suicide that they're taught, I don't have a place.
[3:28:35.020 --> 3:28:37.020]  I feel alone.
[3:28:37.020 --> 3:28:38.020]  People are being mean to me.
[3:28:38.020 --> 3:28:45.020]  Well, once the system, the TV and the culture can program you to be depressed, then that resonates and others don't want to be around you.
[3:28:45.020 --> 3:28:48.020]  Just reach out to God and say, I'm weak, but you're strong.
[3:28:48.020 --> 3:28:52.020]  Energize me and God will do it and suddenly everyone's going to be coming at you.
[3:28:52.020 --> 3:28:57.020]  It's literally just have to reach out to God and say, help me and it will happen.
[3:28:57.020 --> 3:29:03.020]  But when it starts to happen, you've got to be ready because you're going to feel this spiritual force comes in and says you're going to have problems.
[3:29:03.020 --> 3:29:05.020]  Don't do this. Don't accept it. It's literally satanic force.
[3:29:05.020 --> 3:29:12.020]  You've got to just keep reaching through and the more it's like electrical, the more you're going to hold of God and the Holy Spirit gets more and more powerful so you're on fire.
[3:29:12.020 --> 3:29:14.020]  Yeah, it's not that you become perfect.
[3:29:14.020 --> 3:29:21.020]  Oh, no, far from it, but you can at least see God's part of God's incredible plan and now you're part of the plan.
[3:29:21.020 --> 3:29:25.020]  Yeah, and in fact, I said to a priest in confession, I said, Father, I keep struggling with the sin.
[3:29:25.020 --> 3:29:29.020]  He said, well, by God's grace you'll become humble.
[3:29:29.020 --> 3:29:31.020]  By God's grace, you'll have empathy.
[3:29:31.020 --> 3:29:35.020]  By God's grace, you'll know other people struggle with other things that they can't overcome.
[3:29:35.020 --> 3:29:37.020]  And that's the beauty and dignity.
[3:29:37.020 --> 3:29:45.020]  That's where we become like our Creator who has mercy on us, who's kind to us, who's loving to us, even when we don't merit it.
[3:29:45.020 --> 3:29:46.020]  We learn to be that way.
[3:29:46.020 --> 3:29:49.020]  I was the most judgmental, harsh person as an atheist.
[3:29:49.020 --> 3:29:54.020]  And, you know, and I was nine random, I was right wing, I was conservative.
[3:29:54.020 --> 3:29:55.020]  How did you wake up?
[3:29:55.020 --> 3:29:57.020]  Have the Holy Spirit was overnight or a process?
[3:29:57.020 --> 3:30:02.020]  It was really, I wanted to know the source of what was our dignity, where did it come from?
[3:30:02.020 --> 3:30:03.020]  So you were asking?
[3:30:03.020 --> 3:30:04.020]  Oh, yeah.
[3:30:04.020 --> 3:30:05.020]  I actually said a prayer.
[3:30:05.020 --> 3:30:06.020]  I'll tell you, I was...
[3:30:06.020 --> 3:30:07.020]  See, I just want to...
[3:30:07.020 --> 3:30:08.020]  Yeah, okay, let me tell you what happened.
[3:30:08.020 --> 3:30:13.020]  I was director of Hawaii Right to Life and I thought we were going to get partial birth abortion banned.
[3:30:13.020 --> 3:30:16.020]  And I had a bill and the state represented it.
[3:30:16.020 --> 3:30:18.020]  So you were already doing God's work?
[3:30:18.020 --> 3:30:22.020]  Yeah, I was super pro-life because of what had happened to me.
[3:30:22.020 --> 3:30:26.020]  And I tried to get this bill passed and it got held up in committee.
[3:30:26.020 --> 3:30:28.020]  The state rep wouldn't hear it.
[3:30:28.020 --> 3:30:29.020]  So I canvassed your district.
[3:30:29.020 --> 3:30:31.020]  I got our parents to sign my petition.
[3:30:31.020 --> 3:30:35.020]  Her staff, 90% of our district took the petition there and nobody would sign it.
[3:30:35.020 --> 3:30:37.020]  I called Ambassador Allen Keyes.
[3:30:37.020 --> 3:30:39.020]  He had come to give a speech for us.
[3:30:39.020 --> 3:30:43.020]  And I said Ambassador Keyes, you know, I'm chairman of the Young Republicans.
[3:30:43.020 --> 3:30:45.020]  I'm chief of staff for a state representative.
[3:30:45.020 --> 3:30:46.020]  I'm director of Hawaii Right to Life.
[3:30:46.020 --> 3:30:47.020]  I have a radio show.
[3:30:47.020 --> 3:30:49.020]  I can't get one bill out of committee.
[3:30:49.020 --> 3:30:53.020]  It would simply ban one procedure in the third trimester from wasting my life.
[3:30:53.020 --> 3:30:56.020]  He said, the darker the world becomes, the further your light will shine, say a prayer.
[3:30:56.020 --> 3:30:59.020]  I went to my little office in Hawaii in Manoa, Pucks Alley.
[3:30:59.020 --> 3:31:00.020]  And this was my prayer, Alex.
[3:31:00.020 --> 3:31:01.020]  I promised to God.
[3:31:01.020 --> 3:31:07.020]  I sat in this office cluttered dirty with books to Tommy Matt because I slept on the floor and shouted at the beach because we had no money.
[3:31:07.020 --> 3:31:10.020]  And I said, God, if you exist, and I don't believe you're real.
[3:31:10.020 --> 3:31:16.020]  And if you're real, I don't believe you're good or powerful because I'm not good or powerful.
[3:31:16.020 --> 3:31:20.020]  And I'm fighting abortion with a bunch of old ladies and a little island in the middle of Pacific Ocean.
[3:31:20.020 --> 3:31:21.020]  You know where to be found.
[3:31:21.020 --> 3:31:26.020]  If you want me to acknowledge you exist, give me rich people, famous people, and powerful people.
[3:31:26.020 --> 3:31:31.020]  And if I were to track my career from that day, it was six years later, I made Bella.
[3:31:31.020 --> 3:31:33.020]  A year later, I went to Washington, D.C.
[3:31:33.020 --> 3:31:36.020]  And I was in meetings at the Oval Office step by step by step.
[3:31:36.020 --> 3:31:38.020]  And I became a Christian.
[3:31:38.020 --> 3:31:39.020]  Because God's all about free will.
[3:31:39.020 --> 3:31:43.020]  You opened up the channel to receive the support.
[3:31:43.020 --> 3:31:44.020]  And I asked him certain things.
[3:31:44.020 --> 3:31:45.020]  And he gave them to me.
[3:31:45.020 --> 3:31:48.020]  I mean, I made a movie with Patty Millett, Justin Bieber's mother.
[3:31:48.020 --> 3:31:51.020]  That's because you were already doing it and you meant to use the power for good.
[3:31:51.020 --> 3:31:53.020]  And you were already doing God's work.
[3:31:53.020 --> 3:31:55.020]  You like almost started backwards in most people.
[3:31:55.020 --> 3:31:57.020]  Most people would find God's into the good work.
[3:31:57.020 --> 3:31:58.020]  You were already doing the good work.
[3:31:58.020 --> 3:31:59.020]  So that's why it came so quick.
[3:31:59.020 --> 3:32:01.020]  I mean, I was fighting abortion.
[3:32:01.020 --> 3:32:02.020]  Well, let me go.
[3:32:02.020 --> 3:32:04.020]  Killing babies and not valuing it.
[3:32:04.020 --> 3:32:08.020]  But see, that's the thing is, you were an atheist, but you still had value for babies.
[3:32:08.020 --> 3:32:10.020]  So that's really unusual.
[3:32:10.020 --> 3:32:15.020]  Well, what I tell people, fighting abortion is like two things I think we could all agree on.
[3:32:15.020 --> 3:32:19.020]  We don't kill babies, our own babies, and we don't eat human beings.
[3:32:19.020 --> 3:32:20.020]  What was your story?
[3:32:20.020 --> 3:32:21.020]  Did you have a girlfriend?
[3:32:21.020 --> 3:32:22.020]  You didn't want to kill the babies?
[3:32:22.020 --> 3:32:23.020]  No.
[3:32:23.020 --> 3:32:27.020]  So I was in high school and my high school girlfriend got pregnant, joined the army, dropped out
[3:32:27.020 --> 3:32:28.020]  of high school and joined the army.
[3:32:28.020 --> 3:32:29.020]  She was hiding.
[3:32:29.020 --> 3:32:31.020]  She was pregnant, trying to keep it a secret until I got back from basic training.
[3:32:31.020 --> 3:32:35.020]  While I was in basic training, her father forced her to have a third trimester abortion
[3:32:35.020 --> 3:32:36.020]  at Chicago Masonic Hospital.
[3:32:36.020 --> 3:32:37.020]  God.
[3:32:37.020 --> 3:32:40.020]  Her dad's best friend was Cardinal Bernadine, very prominent Catholic.
[3:32:40.020 --> 3:32:41.020]  Yeah, famous.
[3:32:41.020 --> 3:32:43.020]  I never went to church a day in my life.
[3:32:43.020 --> 3:32:47.020]  So I didn't know abortion was legal until I heard from my girlfriend, high school girlfriend,
[3:32:47.020 --> 3:32:49.020]  crying on the phone like her soul was crying.
[3:32:49.020 --> 3:32:50.020]  She couldn't even talk.
[3:32:50.020 --> 3:32:51.020]  Her father said, we know your secret.
[3:32:51.020 --> 3:32:52.020]  Your secret's gone.
[3:32:52.020 --> 3:32:53.020]  You can come home now.
[3:32:53.020 --> 3:32:55.020]  So it was at that moment.
[3:32:55.020 --> 3:32:58.020]  See, that's so epic that literally the Satan, the devil killed your child.
[3:32:58.020 --> 3:33:01.020]  So even though you weren't with God yet, you knew you'd been attacked by evil.
[3:33:01.020 --> 3:33:02.020]  You were fighting bad.
[3:33:02.020 --> 3:33:05.020]  And then you finally asked for God.
[3:33:05.020 --> 3:33:06.020]  Well, you know what happened?
[3:33:06.020 --> 3:33:11.020]  My mom had me as a teenager and was married a couple of times, divorced a couple of times.
[3:33:11.020 --> 3:33:13.020]  Kids came along, my dad went off to the army.
[3:33:13.020 --> 3:33:18.020]  My daydream as a boy was to have to be a father and to be a strong man to protect my children.
[3:33:18.020 --> 3:33:20.020]  That's what I would daydream about.
[3:33:20.020 --> 3:33:22.020]  Five years old, six years old, seven years old.
[3:33:22.020 --> 3:33:25.020]  What kind of father I would be and how protective and strong I would be.
[3:33:25.020 --> 3:33:29.020]  Here I was at 17, felt I failed to protect my own child to birth.
[3:33:29.020 --> 3:33:31.020]  It was startling to me.
[3:33:31.020 --> 3:33:32.020]  I'm a failure.
[3:33:32.020 --> 3:33:33.020]  I'm a loser as a man.
[3:33:33.020 --> 3:33:34.020]  How could I?
[3:33:34.020 --> 3:33:36.020]  And I said, I'm never, ever going to let this go.
[3:33:36.020 --> 3:33:40.020]  So as a 17-year-old boy, I said, until the day I die, and I thought no one knew either.
[3:33:40.020 --> 3:33:41.020]  I didn't know.
[3:33:41.020 --> 3:33:44.020]  Well, that brings tears to my eyes because my story is very similar, except I was very
[3:33:44.020 --> 3:33:48.020]  worldly, not a Satanist, but very aggressive and hateful and power strong in the world.
[3:33:48.020 --> 3:33:50.020]  And I would let girlfriends have abortions.
[3:33:50.020 --> 3:33:51.020]  And I'd do it.
[3:33:51.020 --> 3:33:54.020]  And finally, my dad came to me when I was about like 18, about 17.
[3:33:54.020 --> 3:33:56.020]  He said, you know, you've been killing my grandchildren for a while now.
[3:33:56.020 --> 3:33:57.020]  You're doing it.
[3:33:57.020 --> 3:33:58.020]  And he goes, you know, that's really evil.
[3:33:58.020 --> 3:33:59.020]  You should stop that.
[3:33:59.020 --> 3:34:01.020]  And it really touched my heart.
[3:34:01.020 --> 3:34:03.020]  And I said a prayer to God and God would forgive me.
[3:34:03.020 --> 3:34:07.020]  And then, and then literally it was like almost had this whole vision of things.
[3:34:07.020 --> 3:34:13.020]  And it all came out of that was repenting for the abortions that didn't be asking God,
[3:34:13.020 --> 3:34:14.020]  what do I do?
[3:34:14.020 --> 3:34:18.020]  And then it was like everything was then just by increments like set, what I was supposed
[3:34:18.020 --> 3:34:19.020]  to do at that point.
[3:34:19.020 --> 3:34:21.020]  And look at you now, reaching the entire world.
[3:34:21.020 --> 3:34:22.020]  Yeah.
[3:34:22.020 --> 3:34:25.020]  And not just for the child and the womb, but for all of us who have become vulnerable
[3:34:25.020 --> 3:34:26.020]  by a powerful oligarchy.
[3:34:26.020 --> 3:34:31.020]  You know, oligarchies hide behind democracies to rule the masses.
[3:34:31.020 --> 3:34:34.020]  And so in many ways, all of us this year has become vulnerable.
[3:34:34.020 --> 3:34:38.020]  I just came from a funeral from a friend of mine who adored you.
[3:34:38.020 --> 3:34:39.020]  We lost.
[3:34:39.020 --> 3:34:40.020]  Let's talk about suicide.
[3:34:40.020 --> 3:34:41.020]  We come back.
[3:34:41.020 --> 3:34:43.020]  They don't want to just abort us in the world.
[3:34:43.020 --> 3:34:44.020]  They want to board us out.
[3:34:44.020 --> 3:34:59.020]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.

[3:37:44.020 --> 3:37:49.020]  I'm shooting this quick news alert on Friday, June 4th, 2021.
[3:37:49.020 --> 3:37:51.020]  You see this report from over a month ago?
[3:37:51.020 --> 3:37:55.020]  It's just now starting to break in the mainstream news as whistleblowers go public.
[3:37:55.020 --> 3:37:59.020]  But we broke it first and it's a banned off video with 1 million plus views.
[3:37:59.020 --> 3:38:02.020]  We've reposted it on the front page of infowars.com.
[3:38:02.020 --> 3:38:08.020]  The project manager for Fauci bragged in an interview a year and a half ago how they created COVID-19.
[3:38:08.020 --> 3:38:13.020]  And then he secretly wrote the Lancet report claiming that it was naturally occurring.

[3:39:09.020 --> 3:39:26.020]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen. Jason Jones is in studio with us. I'm Alan Jones and my story begins with abortion.
[3:39:26.020 --> 3:39:30.020]  And I've said this a lot of people ask me like why do you tell the horrible story that you paid for?
[3:39:30.020 --> 3:39:32.020]  You have quite a few of several abortions.
[3:39:32.020 --> 3:39:37.020]  When I was a teenager and you know you're telling you it's not a human and the girl comes in and says I want 300 bucks.
[3:39:37.020 --> 3:39:42.020]  Or do you want to have a child and then I went over to one girlfriend's house and her parents are like you don't want to have a kid with her.
[3:39:42.020 --> 3:39:46.020]  You know you need to have an abortion so you go through that process you make an excuse.
[3:39:46.020 --> 3:39:51.020]  But then each time it happened I got more depressed, more upset, more cut off from God.
[3:39:51.020 --> 3:39:58.020]  My life and as soon as I realized and repented of it it was like God totally forgave me and all of that guilt and pain was taken away.
[3:39:58.020 --> 3:40:04.020]  But instead was this drive to stop abortion and it wasn't even driven by guilt.
[3:40:04.020 --> 3:40:08.020]  It was that I had a mission and so I went and protest a lot of places and saw that.
[3:40:08.020 --> 3:40:16.020]  Before I was ever on access TV and you got on air when I was like 18, 19, 20 I was protesting at abortion clinics with Catholics out there doing it mainly.
[3:40:16.020 --> 3:40:22.020]  I was not even going to a church but I was there just because I realized I had to warn other people that you know this is really a human.
[3:40:22.020 --> 3:40:24.020]  You're going to feel bad about this later.
[3:40:24.020 --> 3:40:30.020]  It was a drive and it's interesting you know your story comes from the same place but you didn't want to have an abortion but it was still forced on your girlfriend.
[3:40:30.020 --> 3:40:36.020]  Yeah and our story is very common right. This is most of our generation probably most of our friends.
[3:40:36.020 --> 3:40:41.020]  It's not and it's tragic you know I didn't because I was so ignorant.
[3:40:41.020 --> 3:40:47.020]  I was last in my class out of 565 kids before I dropped out and I was kind of clueless obviously.
[3:40:47.020 --> 3:40:50.020]  I didn't really know that abortion existed until my high school girlfriend called me.
[3:40:50.020 --> 3:40:59.020]  Her soul was crying and I think back in retrospect what would I have done if she called me and said hey you know it's just a grain of sand and a teaspoon of blood.
[3:40:59.020 --> 3:41:03.020]  And we're too young and it's my right and it's no big deal.
[3:41:03.020 --> 3:41:05.020]  I would have probably been pro-choice.
[3:41:05.020 --> 3:41:06.020]  That's exactly the speech.
[3:41:06.020 --> 3:41:10.020]  Yeah I would have been pro-choice but it's how she told me which is she didn't.
[3:41:10.020 --> 3:41:12.020]  Her dad told me she just cried.
[3:41:12.020 --> 3:41:13.020]  My captain gave me a roll of quarters.
[3:41:13.020 --> 3:41:14.020]  A drill sergeant hung up the phone.
[3:41:14.020 --> 3:41:15.020]  I punched him.
[3:41:15.020 --> 3:41:19.020]  Another drill sergeant grabbed me in my captain's office.
[3:41:19.020 --> 3:41:24.020]  He gave me a roll of quarters and I walked to the PX and through an entire roll of quarters she just cried.
[3:41:24.020 --> 3:41:29.020]  I remember thinking just comfort her, just comfort her, just comfort her.
[3:41:29.020 --> 3:41:35.020]  I would say something here, say something there and for 2 hours an entire roll of quarters I just listened to her cry.
[3:41:35.020 --> 3:41:40.020]  And it was that 2 hours on that phone call that revealed to me the truth about what abortion is.
[3:41:40.020 --> 3:41:50.020]  But in a strange way because I was an atheist the magnitude of the crime that was at that moment I also learned the truth about the beauty of the human person.
[3:41:50.020 --> 3:41:53.020]  In a strange way because I didn't know anything about anything.
[3:41:53.020 --> 3:42:00.020]  But at that moment I discovered how beautiful the human person was when I discovered in our country you could kill a child in the womb.
[3:42:00.020 --> 3:42:06.020]  That sent me on my journey to end abortion which eventually led me to becoming a Christian.
[3:42:06.020 --> 3:42:16.020]  And so notice the left doesn't want to execute a serial killer that raped and murdered little kids but then it's happy to chop up the most innocent defenseless form we've got.
[3:42:16.020 --> 3:42:25.020]  If we do that to our weakest we've just allowed Satan to go to God and say hey they're bad, lift the veil of protection.
[3:42:25.020 --> 3:42:29.020]  And that's what's happening. You can feel the veil of protection, the hedge is being removed.
[3:42:29.020 --> 3:42:35.020]  And people are going to find out you can't just go around and kill kids, you can't just go around and pull this crap and not have God remove his protection.
[3:42:35.020 --> 3:42:37.020]  And that's what I believe is happening.
[3:42:37.020 --> 3:42:42.020]  Well in my latest movie Divided Hearts of America with the football player Benjamin Watson we looked at that.
[3:42:42.020 --> 3:42:48.020]  And I really don't believe that first of all that abortion like slavery and segregation is a brutal denial of our founding principles.
[3:42:48.020 --> 3:42:50.020]  So just naturally our republic is going to collapse.
[3:42:50.020 --> 3:42:55.020]  But God is going to remove his grace just like he would if slavery would have continued on much longer.
[3:42:55.020 --> 3:42:57.020]  If segregation would have continued on much longer.
[3:42:57.020 --> 3:43:06.020]  If abortion which is rooted in that, the Supreme Court found the right to abortion in the amendment that made slave citizens.
[3:43:06.020 --> 3:43:15.020]  If we don't value babies and if we kill old people, notice our old and our young none of us have any value anyways. We're idiots.
[3:43:15.020 --> 3:43:18.020]  No, yeah. And what's sad is they internalize that.
[3:43:18.020 --> 3:43:25.020]  So you go to these abortion rallies and you see people who have internalized that they don't have worth.
[3:43:25.020 --> 3:43:30.020]  Because they know the by a lot there but they began the most beautiful pro-life speech I ever heard was by.
[3:43:30.020 --> 3:43:32.020]  That's right when you kill your child you kill yourself.
[3:43:32.020 --> 3:43:35.020]  And you deny their dignity. You deny your dignity.
[3:43:35.020 --> 3:43:42.020]  And Ricardo Montabon from the old fantasy island was asked when did I become I that I become I the night.
[3:43:42.020 --> 3:43:44.020]  Oh, I love that speech. In fact, this is live.
[3:43:44.020 --> 3:43:53.020]  But in post Ricardo Montabon's incredible pro-life speech at this at that actually the front of the whole four hours show today.
[3:43:53.020 --> 3:43:55.020]  I want Ricardo Montabon's admit to air that year ago.
[3:43:55.020 --> 3:43:56.020]  That's power.
[3:43:56.020 --> 3:43:57.020]  It's the best speech right.
[3:43:57.020 --> 3:43:59.020]  And so I don't need to say it because you're going to see it.
[3:43:59.020 --> 3:44:01.020]  You got to come back and see it.
[3:44:01.020 --> 3:44:05.020]  I love how he begins. When did I become I the night my mother said not tonight.
[3:44:05.020 --> 3:44:06.020]  Do I have a headache?
[3:44:06.020 --> 3:44:07.020]  You know, no, not that night.
[3:44:07.020 --> 3:44:09.020]  It was the night she said, Hey, baby, let's go.
[3:44:09.020 --> 3:44:16.020]  And the moment a part of my dad met the part of my mom and they became one is when I became I the way he does it.
[3:44:16.020 --> 3:44:17.020]  It's just so beautiful.
[3:44:17.020 --> 3:44:21.020]  And he was a wild guy womanizing Hollywood guy.
[3:44:21.020 --> 3:44:23.020]  But he I think he paid for some abortions.
[3:44:23.020 --> 3:44:26.020]  I think and it was but one moment consider himself pro-choice.
[3:44:26.020 --> 3:44:28.020]  But at one moment he had that realization.
[3:44:28.020 --> 3:44:31.020]  And that's when he changed and that's what it changes.
[3:44:31.020 --> 3:44:34.020]  When you know who you are, who your neighbors are.
[3:44:34.020 --> 3:44:36.020]  Sometimes I do the spiritual exercise.
[3:44:36.020 --> 3:44:43.020]  I walk through the airport and I look at everyone, everyone and go made an image of God made an incomparable beauty dignity worth.
[3:44:43.020 --> 3:44:45.020]  It's almost you get in this like ecstasy.
[3:44:45.020 --> 3:44:47.020]  I did that same thing.
[3:44:47.020 --> 3:44:51.020]  I literally look and realize these are all here for a reason.
[3:44:51.020 --> 3:44:52.020]  Yeah.
[3:44:52.020 --> 3:44:57.020]  And we're surrounded by them, you know, and and it becomes overwhelming.
[3:44:57.020 --> 3:44:58.020]  We know that.
[3:44:58.020 --> 3:44:59.020]  We know that.
[3:44:59.020 --> 3:45:01.020]  And that's a grace that I pray.
[3:45:01.020 --> 3:45:06.020]  Also when you recognize people as real, you get a better connection with them.
[3:45:06.020 --> 3:45:07.020]  Yeah.
[3:45:07.020 --> 3:45:18.020]  And special and unique and irrepeatable that everyone is irrepeatable that everyone I believe like every culture, every person had they're here to bring something that only they're here to bring.
[3:45:18.020 --> 3:45:25.020]  Well, that's what's so satanic about a human animal clone, which which they admit they've been doing and they've actually brought the term from my sources.
[3:45:25.020 --> 3:45:27.020]  Imagine what does that have a spirit?
[3:45:27.020 --> 3:45:28.020]  Does that have a soul?
[3:45:28.020 --> 3:45:30.020]  That's why the Bible says that's an abomination.
[3:45:30.020 --> 3:45:32.020]  I mean, what is that thing?
[3:45:32.020 --> 3:45:35.020]  I don't hate it, but they're going to try to use that and say, oh, you're against abortion.
[3:45:35.020 --> 3:45:36.020]  How about this?
[3:45:36.020 --> 3:45:38.020]  This thing has rights.
[3:45:38.020 --> 3:45:40.020]  That will have rights.
[3:45:40.020 --> 3:45:43.020]  Why sing a human with literally an animal?
[3:45:43.020 --> 3:45:45.020]  Yes, that's totally to blow away.
[3:45:45.020 --> 3:45:47.020]  You know, people will hear this and they go, that's crazy.
[3:45:47.020 --> 3:45:48.020]  Yeah.
[3:45:48.020 --> 3:45:49.020]  So it's partial birth abortion.
[3:45:49.020 --> 3:45:53.020]  Crazy things happen just because it's going running front page ads with that.
[3:45:53.020 --> 3:45:56.020]  You say that, which is a show.
[3:45:56.020 --> 3:45:59.020]  But the point is there's the Senate.
[3:45:59.020 --> 3:46:01.020]  Rejects ban on human animal hybrids.
[3:46:01.020 --> 3:46:03.020]  Do I remember him last week?
[3:46:03.020 --> 3:46:11.020]  Ambassador Brownback, who's the former governor Brownback and Senator Brownback before that he introduced a bill trying to ban this.
[3:46:11.020 --> 3:46:12.020]  He said this is coming.
[3:46:12.020 --> 3:46:13.020]  He said this 20 years ago.
[3:46:13.020 --> 3:46:14.020]  Exactly.
[3:46:14.020 --> 3:46:15.020]  There's a bill five years ago.
[3:46:15.020 --> 3:46:16.020]  Same thing.
[3:46:16.020 --> 3:46:18.020]  The same bill was brought forward and failed.
[3:46:18.020 --> 3:46:24.020]  Yeah, Brownback said let's ban it before people realize it's a thing and there it is.
[3:46:24.020 --> 3:46:27.020]  So I mean, I even get like, I'm you're busy making film.
[3:46:27.020 --> 3:46:28.020]  You hear me say this.
[3:46:28.020 --> 3:46:29.020]  It sounds crazy.
[3:46:29.020 --> 3:46:30.020]  No, no, I know this is not.
[3:46:30.020 --> 3:46:31.020]  I know it's real.
[3:46:31.020 --> 3:46:33.020]  I'm just saying, but there's no, I can't believe it's real.
[3:46:33.020 --> 3:46:35.020]  I'm saying is in closing suicide.
[3:46:35.020 --> 3:46:36.020]  Yeah.
[3:46:36.020 --> 3:46:37.020]  It's an epidemic.
[3:46:37.020 --> 3:46:38.020]  It's getting worse and worse.
[3:46:38.020 --> 3:46:39.020]  And I run into these people.
[3:46:39.020 --> 3:46:42.020]  I know people that just say, well, I don't have a war with the words too bad.
[3:46:42.020 --> 3:46:43.020]  They kill themselves.
[3:46:43.020 --> 3:46:46.020]  And I think it's because they're not realizing they need to do a lot and serve others.
[3:46:46.020 --> 3:46:47.020]  Yes.
[3:46:47.020 --> 3:46:51.020]  And even if they're in a terrible position and realize there's a mission to save the
[3:46:51.020 --> 3:46:52.020]  innocence.
[3:46:52.020 --> 3:46:54.020]  And I'm not saying they're wimps.
[3:46:54.020 --> 3:46:55.020]  It's terrible.
[3:46:55.020 --> 3:46:57.020]  A lot of them are taking drugs and puts them in that mindset.
[3:46:57.020 --> 3:47:00.020]  But just once you actually try to save others, then you're not worried about yourself.
[3:47:00.020 --> 3:47:03.020]  That's what I personally found makes me never have any depression or any problems.
[3:47:03.020 --> 3:47:06.020]  As soon as I realized, hey, you know, all these other innocent people get destroyed.
[3:47:06.020 --> 3:47:08.020]  It's like you got a mission.
[3:47:08.020 --> 3:47:11.020]  Yeah, I love when I get depressed and actually when I get struck with it because I sit there
[3:47:11.020 --> 3:47:15.020]  and I say to myself, this is how a lot of people feel all the time.
[3:47:15.020 --> 3:47:17.020]  I'm glad I feel this.
[3:47:17.020 --> 3:47:18.020]  It gives me empathy.
[3:47:18.020 --> 3:47:20.020]  In our home state of Hawaii, we were talking offline.
[3:47:20.020 --> 3:47:22.020]  There's a suicide epidemic because people have been locked in.
[3:47:22.020 --> 3:47:24.020]  You're a good friend, you said.
[3:47:24.020 --> 3:47:25.020]  Yeah, we were afraid.
[3:47:25.020 --> 3:47:26.020]  It fell 16 stories.
[3:47:26.020 --> 3:47:29.020]  We're trying to get to the bottom of what happened.
[3:47:29.020 --> 3:47:31.020]  Definitely suffering from depression.
[3:47:31.020 --> 3:47:34.020]  And then when I was in Hawaii, friends of mine in HPD said, Jason, you did not understand
[3:47:34.020 --> 3:47:36.020]  the epidemic of suicides hitting the state.
[3:47:36.020 --> 3:47:40.020]  I knew the year before they reported in one week more suicides than the previous year.
[3:47:40.020 --> 3:47:44.020]  You know, when you're depressed, feel that and know that other people are feeling just
[3:47:44.020 --> 3:47:45.020]  like you are.
[3:47:45.020 --> 3:47:49.020]  And when you think about taking a life, you take your own life or suicidal ideation.
[3:47:49.020 --> 3:47:50.020]  No, I'm feeling this.
[3:47:50.020 --> 3:47:51.020]  I'm thinking this.
[3:47:51.020 --> 3:47:52.020]  So many people are too.
[3:47:52.020 --> 3:47:53.020]  No, I agree.
[3:47:53.020 --> 3:47:55.020]  Instead of fighting it, just own it completely and then come out of it.
[3:47:55.020 --> 3:47:56.020]  Yes.
[3:47:56.020 --> 3:47:59.020]  Like Mel Gibson said, you take that cactus, you hug the cactus and you say, other people
[3:47:59.020 --> 3:48:00.020]  are feeling like this.
[3:48:00.020 --> 3:48:03.020]  I'm going to get through it because suicide becomes an epidemic.
[3:48:03.020 --> 3:48:05.020]  People hear what happened to you and they do it.
[3:48:05.020 --> 3:48:08.020]  But when they, when you can say to them, I feel everything you have felt.
[3:48:08.020 --> 3:48:10.020]  I've been in all these dark places.
[3:48:10.020 --> 3:48:12.020]  I get it, brother.
[3:48:12.020 --> 3:48:13.020]  I get it, sister.
[3:48:13.020 --> 3:48:14.020]  But don't let Satan win.
[3:48:14.020 --> 3:48:15.020]  Do not do this.
[3:48:15.020 --> 3:48:17.020]  God wants us to live.
[3:48:17.020 --> 3:48:20.020]  Satan wants us to kill the image of God.
[3:48:20.020 --> 3:48:21.020]  Yes.
[3:48:21.020 --> 3:48:24.020]  And wear these masks and they cover up God's image.
[3:48:24.020 --> 3:48:27.020]  These masks are the worst because it robs us of our personality.
[3:48:27.020 --> 3:48:29.020]  It robs us of our dignity and our worth and our beauty.
[3:48:29.020 --> 3:48:33.020]  How many times, you know, you want to smile at someone and you got the mask on.
[3:48:33.020 --> 3:48:34.020]  They can't see.
[3:48:34.020 --> 3:48:36.020]  You know, you look at someone, you know, they need a smile.
[3:48:36.020 --> 3:48:38.020]  Now they're off almost everywhere in Austin.
[3:48:38.020 --> 3:48:39.020]  It's so wonderful to see faces.
[3:48:39.020 --> 3:48:40.020]  Austin's on fire.
[3:48:40.020 --> 3:48:43.020]  I was in Austin two nights ago for a meeting and it was like ecstatic.
[3:48:43.020 --> 3:48:46.020]  The waitresses, the waiters, the homeless guys.
[3:48:46.020 --> 3:48:47.020]  I was talking to that.
[3:48:47.020 --> 3:48:48.020]  Hey, Jason, I know you're busy.
[3:48:48.020 --> 3:48:51.020]  Anytime you want to host an hour or come in and co-host, we love you.
[3:48:51.020 --> 3:48:52.020]  You're on fire.
[3:48:52.020 --> 3:48:53.020]  Thank you so much.
[3:48:53.020 --> 3:48:55.020]  I got to do a plug as I forgot last hour.
[3:48:55.020 --> 3:48:57.020]  Not a gimmick that the sale was posted in yesterday.
[3:48:57.020 --> 3:48:59.020]  I didn't end today because I got too busy.
[3:48:59.020 --> 3:49:00.020]  Didn't do the sale.
[3:49:00.020 --> 3:49:04.020]  So free shipping ends at four o'clock today at about an hour and three minutes and 40%
[3:49:04.020 --> 3:49:07.020]  off a DNA force plus 50% off a bunch of other products.
[3:49:07.020 --> 3:49:11.020]  Pollen Block, X2, Wintersun, Ultra 12.
[3:49:11.020 --> 3:49:14.020]  That's what funds our operation, infowarstore.com.
[3:49:14.020 --> 3:49:15.020]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[3:49:15.020 --> 3:49:18.020]  I want to tell the crew, great job today as always.
[3:49:18.020 --> 3:49:24.020]  And Owen Sawyer is coming up with The War Room in T-minus 120 seconds.
[3:49:24.020 --> 3:49:25.020]  Mr. Jones, one more time.
[3:49:25.020 --> 3:49:26.020]  What's the best website folks have visited?
[3:49:26.020 --> 3:49:29.020]  Movietomovement.com and find out all my movies.
[3:49:29.020 --> 3:49:30.020]  All right.
[3:49:30.020 --> 3:49:32.020]  And we covered the Catholic reset today.
[3:49:32.020 --> 3:49:37.020]  All right.
