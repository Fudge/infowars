[00:00.000 --> 00:27.040]  Well, Gert Wilders has now decided to spearhead Tommy Robinson protests in London.
[00:27.040 --> 00:32.320]  Of course, the truth about why Tommy Robinson was arrested is the scariest thing.
[00:32.320 --> 00:35.840]  Here's a report from our own John Bowne with the latest.
[00:35.840 --> 00:40.240]  This is why Tommy Robinson is being held as a political prisoner.
[00:40.240 --> 01:02.240]  That's why Tommy Robinson is being held as a political prisoner.
[01:02.240 --> 01:06.800]  Hospitals have rules with patients and things like that.
[01:06.800 --> 01:10.720]  Well, because I'm dyslexic when I want to be, I don't understand rules.
[01:10.720 --> 01:13.760]  Jimmy Savile's victims have faced years of pain.
[01:14.800 --> 01:19.360]  We owe it to them and to our audiences to understand how this could have happened
[01:20.480 --> 01:27.120]  and to make sure that everything we do ensures that nothing like this could ever happen again.
[01:27.120 --> 01:32.560]  Folks, you ask, there's a bizarre satanic ritual being described by children in a video.
[01:32.560 --> 01:33.280]  Tell us about that.
[01:33.280 --> 01:37.760]  Yeah, this is a chilling video, whether it's hoax or not.
[01:37.760 --> 01:40.240]  I mean, it's gone completely viral over the weekend.
[01:40.240 --> 01:42.160]  It's got over a thousand comments on Reddit.
[01:42.160 --> 01:45.600]  It's got 200,000 views on the original YouTube video.
[01:45.600 --> 01:52.560]  And it's basically two young children describing how they were allegedly sexually abused
[01:52.560 --> 01:58.560]  and forced to partake in bizarre satanic baby sacrifice rituals.
[01:58.560 --> 02:05.040]  Now, after decades of neglect, finally, England must now answer to why the powers that be
[02:05.040 --> 02:11.200]  quietly allowed, mainly Pakistani, Kurdish and Kosovoan Muslim men, according to court records,
[02:11.200 --> 02:15.840]  to form a network of sex trafficking rings all across Great Britain
[02:15.840 --> 02:21.280]  to sadistically rape thousands of English girls for roughly four decades.
[02:21.280 --> 02:28.160]  We seem to be looking at millions of rapes of white and Sikh girls by Muslim men.
[02:28.160 --> 02:34.160]  Only 222 of whom have been convicted since 2005.
[02:34.160 --> 02:39.360]  To say, my Lords, will the government ask our Muslim leaders whether the perpetrators
[02:39.360 --> 02:46.160]  can claim that their behavior is sanctioned in the Quran and to issue a fatwa against it?
[02:46.160 --> 02:54.160]  And second, my Lords, will the government encourage a national debate about the various
[02:54.160 --> 02:56.160]  interpretations of Islam?
[02:56.160 --> 03:00.160]  Can we talk about Islam without being accused of hate crime?
[03:00.160 --> 03:08.160]  And when you look back to the, for example, the 1970s, we had something like 200,000 Muslims
[03:08.160 --> 03:10.160]  in Britain at that time.
[03:10.160 --> 03:12.160]  But every decade, they've doubled since then.
[03:12.160 --> 03:16.160]  So the 200,000 became 400,000 became 800,000.
[03:16.160 --> 03:18.160]  We're now up to 3.2 million.
[03:18.160 --> 03:23.160]  But as they grow, they start demanding more and they start pushing more.
[03:23.160 --> 03:30.160]  And because they back this up with terrorism and with jihad, the government listens to them.
[03:30.160 --> 03:36.160]  You know, when Mohamed said, I have been made victorious through terror, he's speaking absolutely the truth.
[03:36.160 --> 03:40.160]  And our government understands the fact that they are frightened of Islam.
[03:40.160 --> 03:45.160]  And they, Islam pushes and our government buckles.
[03:45.160 --> 03:53.160]  The most recent scandal known as the Telfer scandal was a network of 200 plus Muslim men gang raping local children.
[03:53.160 --> 04:01.160]  While another major incident known as the Rotherham scandal from 1997 to 2013 affected at least 1,400 children.
[04:01.160 --> 04:08.160]  Some had reported being doused with gasoline witnessing violent rape and had their families threatened if they talked.
[04:08.160 --> 04:16.160]  A 2013 inquiry into the Rotherham child sexual exploitation uncovered a local government unwilling to address the problem
[04:16.160 --> 04:23.160]  due to contempt for the working class, a fear of being deemed racist and protection of its reputation.
[04:23.160 --> 04:29.160]  The local government of Rotherham had in a sense been raped of its morality and duty.
[04:29.160 --> 04:36.160]  And the only person that is apparently going to pay the price for it is Tommy Robinson, who is simply reporting on it.
[04:36.160 --> 04:42.160]  Free Tommy Robinson now, John Bown reporting for Infowars.com.
[04:42.160 --> 04:45.160]  But it doesn't stop there now in Europe.
[04:45.160 --> 04:51.160]  France, France has fake news laws that are leaving media experts uneasy.
[04:51.160 --> 04:57.160]  So free speech in Europe, well if it's not dead, it's barely got a pulse.

[06:21.160 --> 06:31.160]  Indeed, yes, here I am on this Tuesday, June 5th, 2018, filling in for Alex Jones, who tries to take a vacation.
[06:31.160 --> 06:37.160]  But the universe says, not quite yet, Mr. Jones.
[06:37.160 --> 06:47.160]  As Alex is heading out for vacation, he runs into the leader of the Democrat socialist movement, Bernie Sanders.
[06:47.160 --> 06:59.160]  Now, there's a lot of interesting things in this video, but how about the fact that Bernie Sanders pretty much doesn't even energize a crowd anymore?
[06:59.160 --> 07:12.160]  Doesn't that show you how the momentum that the left had or thought they had is really coming to a crashing halt where no one even cares that Bernie's at the airport?
[07:12.160 --> 07:26.160]  And then you just look at this guy, and you can just see how low energy he is, where his own soyboy security guard has more energy and courage than Bernie does to actually stand up to Alex Jones.
[07:26.160 --> 07:30.160]  I mean, the guy made a fool of himself, but hey, give him credit, at least he tried.
[07:30.160 --> 07:38.160]  So Alex Jones tries to go on vacation, the universe gives him Bernie Sanders to confront, and here is the aftermath of that.
[07:38.160 --> 07:45.160]  They didn't know Bernie Sanders.
[07:45.160 --> 07:48.160]  Dude, no, come on, not right now.
[07:48.160 --> 07:51.160]  Why'd you say why people didn't know what it was like before?
[07:51.160 --> 07:59.160]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto. You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[07:59.160 --> 08:10.160]  Go, Senator, go, Senator, go, Senator.
[08:10.160 --> 08:18.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just got off our plane here at LAX, and Bernie Sanders, the living embodiment of communist and socialist evil and failure, was here.
[08:18.160 --> 08:24.160]  A living museum piece of Mao Zedong or Joseph Stalin or V.I. Lenin.
[08:24.160 --> 08:33.160]  In fact, after the death of Hugo Chavez, he passed on the mantle. But of course his little handlers wouldn't let him talk to some proletariat slave like me.
[08:33.160 --> 08:39.160]  And so this went on for a while. Then he left the gate, we went to the store, he came back by and we talked to him again.
[08:39.160 --> 08:46.160]  But then his minions came over and put out the same old democratic talking points they do over and over and over again.
[08:46.160 --> 08:51.160]  You talk about brainwash sheep, you're going to see some of those as well. So here it is.
[08:51.160 --> 08:55.160]  Go on board and see your captain. Don't leave us, we'll be in 40 minutes.
[08:55.160 --> 08:57.160]  Oh, they didn't know Bernie Sanders.
[08:57.160 --> 09:01.160]  Dude, no, come on, no, right now. No, Senator.
[09:01.160 --> 09:04.160]  Why'd you say why people didn't know us like before?
[09:04.160 --> 09:11.160]  Because you guys are from our first class, aren't you?
[09:11.160 --> 09:15.160]  Why's he running?
[09:15.160 --> 09:17.160]  Probably why.
[09:17.160 --> 09:19.160]  You guys fought first class, you shouldn't be.
[09:19.160 --> 09:21.160]  I got a coach to get my pocket.
[09:21.160 --> 09:26.160]  You don't need that Venezuela. I like $100,000 around me. I'm going to walk this way.
[09:26.160 --> 09:27.160]  Don't touch me.
[09:27.160 --> 09:28.160]  You just hit me, bro.
[09:28.160 --> 09:29.160]  You put your hand out, Alex.
[09:29.160 --> 09:31.160]  Oh, you're going to do that socialist thing where you're like bumping the people into it?
[09:31.160 --> 09:33.160]  Alex, I'm walking back.
[09:33.160 --> 09:36.160]  Hey, Bernie.
[09:36.160 --> 09:39.160]  Bernie, where are you running, bro?
[09:39.160 --> 09:42.160]  There we go. Carl Robes didn't run like this. He was talking to me.
[09:42.160 --> 09:44.160]  I'll talk to you.
[09:44.160 --> 09:45.160]  You want to have a conversation?
[09:45.160 --> 09:47.160]  Well, he said why people didn't know us like before. This is why people are more.
[09:47.160 --> 09:49.160]  Why? Because you're following?
[09:49.160 --> 09:51.160]  He said why people don't know what it's like before.
[09:51.160 --> 09:53.160]  That was a really racist thing to say.
[09:53.160 --> 09:58.160]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[09:58.160 --> 10:01.160]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[10:01.160 --> 10:04.160]  You don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street
[10:04.160 --> 10:07.160]  or you get dragged out of a car.
[10:07.160 --> 10:11.160]  You guys are so afraid of stuff.
[10:11.160 --> 10:13.160]  Wow, Bernie's here. He's running.
[10:13.160 --> 10:15.160]  There we go.
[10:15.160 --> 10:18.160]  Don't worry. Get my beautiful face on camera.
[10:18.160 --> 10:21.160]  Don't worry. We'll destroy America.
[10:21.160 --> 10:24.160]  We'll turn it into Venezuela.
[10:24.160 --> 10:26.160]  There's over here.
[10:26.160 --> 10:30.160]  Look, look, right there.
[10:30.160 --> 10:33.160]  Bernie, why'd you say why people don't know what it's like to be poor?
[10:33.160 --> 10:35.160]  Don't touch me. Alex, don't touch me.
[10:35.160 --> 10:37.160]  Don't touch me, Alex.
[10:37.160 --> 10:39.160]  You guys have fun.
[10:39.160 --> 10:42.160]  Gotta be around the general public, huh?
[10:42.160 --> 10:44.160]  It's kind of a bad thing.
[10:44.160 --> 10:48.160]  You're on the proletariat like that and you're a ruling class commie, huh?
[10:55.160 --> 10:57.160]  You guys have fun.
[10:57.160 --> 10:59.160]  You're having fun. We're all having fun, aren't we?
[10:59.160 --> 11:01.160]  We're gonna win. Don't worry. America's going back.
[11:01.160 --> 11:03.160]  America's going back.
[11:03.160 --> 11:05.160]  We're gonna win.
[11:05.160 --> 11:07.160]  Have a good one.
[11:07.160 --> 11:11.160]  The truth is, the left is the most vicious evil ideology the planet's ever seen.
[11:11.160 --> 11:14.160]  It's a historical fact. They always lecture us how we're violent, we're bad.
[11:14.160 --> 11:16.160]  They're the ones that want to abort all the babies.
[11:16.160 --> 11:21.160]  They're the ones that want to block Trump being able to have all the experimental cures and treatments
[11:21.160 --> 11:23.160]  given to people that were terminal.
[11:23.160 --> 11:25.160]  They're the people that love the culture of death.
[11:25.160 --> 11:27.160]  It's like Bernie supported Black Lives Matter.
[11:27.160 --> 11:31.160]  Just like he wouldn't decry the cop killers when they killed cops.
[11:31.160 --> 11:35.160]  That's the type of monster a cold-blooded person that Sanders is.
[11:35.160 --> 11:38.160]  He wants to overthrow this country, be a conquest.
[11:38.160 --> 11:41.160]  Bernie Sanders, he's a monster.
[11:45.160 --> 11:49.160]  Mr. Sanders, why do you think socialism works better than capitalism?
[11:49.160 --> 11:51.160]  And why do you live in a capitalist country?
[11:51.160 --> 11:54.160]  I don't know why you're running from me.
[11:54.160 --> 11:56.160]  Where are you flying today?
[11:56.160 --> 11:58.160]  You're gonna apologize to the Sandy Hook families, Alex?
[11:58.160 --> 12:00.160]  Well, that's the media that this represents that.
[12:00.160 --> 12:03.160]  You apologize for all the wars you guys launched in the Democrats.
[12:03.160 --> 12:05.160]  All the millions you killed.
[12:05.160 --> 12:08.160]  Do you enjoy living in a million-dollar vacation house as Bernie?
[12:08.160 --> 12:10.160]  Or do you want to give those to people?
[12:10.160 --> 12:12.160]  Yeah, your $100,000 outies.
[12:17.160 --> 12:19.160]  Anyways, anyways, anyways.
[12:19.160 --> 12:21.160]  You guys have fun.
[12:22.160 --> 12:24.160]  We love reporting all that money.
[12:24.160 --> 12:26.160]  You guys running a little PR stuff.
[12:26.160 --> 12:28.160]  It's not gonna work.
[12:29.160 --> 12:31.160]  Have fun, you know.
[12:31.160 --> 12:33.160]  Good luck, but Google gets broken up.
[12:33.160 --> 12:35.160]  I apologize to the Sandy Hook family, Alex.
[12:35.160 --> 12:37.160]  You guys need to.
[12:37.160 --> 12:39.160]  You've made those places fix from his armadones.
[12:39.160 --> 12:41.160]  And advertised them.
[12:41.160 --> 12:43.160]  What do you think about the fact that 98% of mass shootings
[12:43.160 --> 12:45.160]  occur in gun-free zones, Bernie?
[12:45.160 --> 12:47.160]  Do you want to get rid of those?
[12:47.160 --> 12:49.160]  Why do you stop being an idiot for a second?
[12:49.160 --> 12:50.160]  It's okay.
[12:50.160 --> 12:51.160]  I know it's okay.
[12:51.160 --> 12:53.160]  Are you mad at Hillary Stoly-Lashover, ma'am?
[12:53.160 --> 12:54.160]  No, you don't care about that.
[12:54.160 --> 12:56.160]  I'm mad at your Sandy Hook denier.
[12:56.160 --> 12:58.160]  That's all. You guys are religion.
[12:58.160 --> 13:00.160]  You think that's like some big thing.
[13:00.160 --> 13:02.160]  Who's my guy? Who's my guy? What guy am I?
[13:02.160 --> 13:04.160]  I mean, you like Hillary. What guy am I?
[13:04.160 --> 13:06.160]  No, you like Hillary. Did I bring up Hillary?
[13:06.160 --> 13:08.160]  No, don't worry.
[13:08.160 --> 13:10.160]  You deny Sandy Hook,
[13:10.160 --> 13:12.160]  and you're giving him a hard time.
[13:12.160 --> 13:14.160]  No, Hillary edited tapes of that.
[13:14.160 --> 13:16.160]  Oh, Hillary edited tapes of Sandy Hook.
[13:16.160 --> 13:18.160]  Yeah, that's right.
[13:18.160 --> 13:20.160]  You win.
[13:20.160 --> 13:22.160]  Why don't you talk about all the wars and stuff that's killed millions of people?
[13:22.160 --> 13:24.160]  Or Hillary launching the whole thing
[13:24.160 --> 13:26.160]  and living and destabilizing the whole country
[13:26.160 --> 13:28.160]  instead of feeling good about yourself?
[13:28.160 --> 13:30.160]  Yeah, you're a virtueist signaler.
[13:30.160 --> 13:32.160]  Yeah, so...
[13:32.160 --> 13:34.160]  What are the truths that got there?
[13:34.160 --> 13:36.160]  Do you deny Benghazi, Hillary?
[13:36.160 --> 13:38.160]  You guys are losing.
[13:38.160 --> 13:40.160]  The worlds are like the socialism
[13:40.160 --> 13:42.160]  and all the so-called elite intelligence
[13:42.160 --> 13:44.160]  are totally elected.
[13:44.160 --> 13:46.160]  Oh, yeah.
[13:46.160 --> 13:48.160]  I get what's going on here.
[13:48.160 --> 13:50.160]  Just showing that you are.
[13:50.160 --> 13:52.160]  Anyways, I gotta go.
[13:52.160 --> 13:54.160]  You guys have a great day.
[13:54.160 --> 13:56.160]  One less idiot in L.A. is good.
[13:56.160 --> 13:58.160]  Well, L.A. is trying to hit their idiot.
[13:58.160 --> 14:00.160]  Max, I'm not sure who one of them is.
[14:06.160 --> 14:08.160]  Hey, Bernie, why don't you say white people
[14:08.160 --> 14:10.160]  don't know what it's like to be poor?
[14:10.160 --> 14:12.160]  Why aren't you so racist?
[14:12.160 --> 14:14.160]  You won't answer that, but you did say it.
[14:14.160 --> 14:16.160]  Move to Venezuela, Bernie.
[14:16.160 --> 14:18.160]  You like it. People like you there.
[14:18.160 --> 14:20.160]  So, over and over again,
[14:20.160 --> 14:22.160]  they want to change the subject from communism
[14:22.160 --> 14:24.160]  and socialism, destroying hundreds of countries
[14:24.160 --> 14:26.160]  and killing over 200 million people.
[14:26.160 --> 14:28.160]  They want to change the subject
[14:28.160 --> 14:30.160]  to myself and others
[14:30.160 --> 14:32.160]  asking questions about big public events
[14:32.160 --> 14:34.160]  that are used to blame the Second Amendment.
[14:34.160 --> 14:36.160]  This is incredible, but as long as they can't
[14:36.160 --> 14:38.160]  guilt you into their mind control, they fail.
[14:38.160 --> 14:40.160]  They are sociopaths and psychopaths.
[14:40.160 --> 14:42.160]  Leftist and globalist
[14:42.160 --> 14:44.160]  are there to manipulate those of us that have feelings.
[14:44.160 --> 14:46.160]  So, again, ladies and gentlemen,
[14:46.160 --> 14:48.160]  Bernie Sanders checked off the bucket list
[14:48.160 --> 14:50.160]  running like a cowardly rat
[14:50.160 --> 14:52.160]  into a sewer away from serious questions.
[14:52.160 --> 14:54.160]  When you're white,
[14:54.160 --> 14:56.160]  you don't know what it's like
[14:56.160 --> 14:58.160]  to be living in a ghetto.
[14:58.160 --> 15:00.160]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[15:00.160 --> 15:02.160]  There he is.
[15:02.160 --> 15:04.160]  Bernie Sanders
[15:04.160 --> 15:06.160]  confronted by Alex Jones
[15:06.160 --> 15:08.160]  at LA International,
[15:08.160 --> 15:10.160]  and I'm sure we'll be hearing from Alex Jones again today
[15:10.160 --> 15:12.160]  before the broadcast is over.
[15:12.160 --> 15:14.160]  Now, I have people asking me
[15:14.160 --> 15:16.160]  when are the specials going to end?
[15:16.160 --> 15:18.160]  I need to take advantage. The end of this week,
[15:18.160 --> 15:20.160]  at the end of this week,
[15:20.160 --> 15:22.160]  the specials will end.
[15:22.160 --> 15:24.160]  The Memorial Day specials extended
[15:24.160 --> 15:26.160]  to the early summer specials.
[15:26.160 --> 15:28.160]  Free shipping,

[15:30.160 --> 15:32.160]  like Supermail Vitality,
[15:32.160 --> 15:34.160]  Brainforce Plus.

[15:44.160 --> 15:46.160]  and Infowars and everything we do here.
[15:46.160 --> 15:48.160]  And we're expanding.
[15:48.160 --> 15:50.160]  So you're going to fund our expansion,
[15:50.160 --> 15:52.160]  taking advantage of the specials

[15:54.160 --> 16:22.160]  free shipping store-wide. We'll be right back.
[16:22.160 --> 16:24.160]  We'll be right back.
[16:52.160 --> 16:54.160]  Heart and Body Extract 866-295-5305
[16:54.160 --> 17:22.160]  or hbextract.com.
[17:22.160 --> 17:24.160]  You have been lied to.
[17:24.160 --> 17:26.160]  My name is Kevin Ship.
[17:26.160 --> 17:28.160]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[17:28.160 --> 17:30.160]  Finally, someone has come out
[17:30.160 --> 17:32.160]  and written what I think is the best
[17:32.160 --> 17:34.160]  ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[17:34.160 --> 17:36.160]  We're in a constitutional crisis,
[17:36.160 --> 17:38.160]  and our government is now being run
[17:38.160 --> 17:40.160]  and ruled by a shadow government.
[17:40.160 --> 17:42.160]  We've got to get this out.
[17:42.160 --> 17:44.160]  Just because you're awake, folks,
[17:44.160 --> 17:46.160]  doesn't mean other people aren't.
[17:46.160 --> 17:48.160]  This is critical to get, to read,
[17:48.160 --> 17:50.160]  to give them library, to give them
[17:50.160 --> 17:52.160]  the church. Get them right now
[17:52.160 --> 17:54.160]  at KillingUncleSanBook.com.
[17:54.160 --> 18:20.160]  KillingUncleSanBook.com.
[18:20.160 --> 18:25.160]  It's easy to use, and let me tell you something.
[18:25.160 --> 18:27.160]  It is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts,
[18:27.160 --> 18:29.160]  and entire meals.
[18:29.160 --> 18:31.160]  Woo! That's what I'm talking about.
[18:31.160 --> 18:33.160]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation,
[18:33.160 --> 18:35.160]  like canning or dehydrating,
[18:35.160 --> 18:37.160]  you know, like what you get at the grocery store,
[18:37.160 --> 18:39.160]  there is no comparison.
[18:39.160 --> 18:42.160]  Harvest-right freeze dryers retain 97%
[18:42.160 --> 18:45.160]  of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[18:45.160 --> 18:48.160]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[18:48.160 --> 18:50.160]  Now that's what I call the miracle
[18:50.160 --> 18:52.160]  of food preservation.
[18:52.160 --> 18:54.160]  Harvest-right is truly the world's best,
[18:54.160 --> 18:56.160]  most affordable freeze dryer.
[18:56.160 --> 18:57.160]  So what are you waiting for?
[18:57.160 --> 18:58.160]  Check it out right now
[18:58.160 --> 19:00.160]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[19:00.160 --> 19:02.160]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough
[19:02.160 --> 19:03.160]  in modern medicine,
[19:03.160 --> 19:05.160]  introducing pollen block.
[19:05.160 --> 19:07.160]  We have found an extraordinary new,
[19:07.160 --> 19:09.160]  natural way to alleviate
[19:09.160 --> 19:11.160]  seasonal distress symptoms, including
[19:11.160 --> 19:14.160]  promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[19:14.160 --> 19:17.160]  eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[19:17.160 --> 19:20.160]  In the 1960s, researchers in France
[19:20.160 --> 19:22.160]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[19:22.160 --> 19:24.160]  experienced less seasonal immune
[19:24.160 --> 19:26.160]  and inflammatory responses.
[19:26.160 --> 19:28.160]  They began studying this effect
[19:28.160 --> 19:30.160]  in published trials, and decades later,
[19:30.160 --> 19:32.160]  we now have the fruit of this research,
[19:32.160 --> 19:34.160]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[19:34.160 --> 19:37.160]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[19:37.160 --> 19:40.160]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[19:40.160 --> 19:42.160]  It is not an antihistamine.
[19:42.160 --> 19:44.160]  In fact, current research has found that it actually
[19:44.160 --> 19:46.160]  acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[19:46.160 --> 19:48.160]  which is an enzyme that amplifies
[19:48.160 --> 19:51.160]  immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[19:51.160 --> 19:54.160]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[19:54.160 --> 19:56.160]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com
[19:56.160 --> 20:20.160]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[20:20.160 --> 20:23.160]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[20:23.160 --> 20:26.160]  you are the resistance.
[20:26.160 --> 20:29.160]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[20:29.160 --> 20:31.160]  This is the Alex Jones Show
[20:31.160 --> 20:32.160]  filling in for Alex Jones.
[20:32.160 --> 20:35.160]  I'm Owen Schreuer, and okay,
[20:35.160 --> 20:38.160]  I've got a bunch of news that I need to cover
[20:38.160 --> 20:41.160]  during the three hours that I'm here
[20:41.160 --> 20:43.160]  before Paul Joseph Watson takes over
[20:43.160 --> 20:45.160]  in the fourth hour.
[20:45.160 --> 20:48.160]  What you can expect, Dr. Jerome Corsi
[20:48.160 --> 20:50.160]  is going to join me in the second hour
[20:50.160 --> 20:53.160]  at 12.06.
[20:53.160 --> 20:56.160]  I'm sure we'll be discussing the latest
[20:56.160 --> 20:59.160]  when it comes to the Russian collusion claim
[20:59.160 --> 21:02.160]  where now you've got the Mueller team
[21:02.160 --> 21:05.160]  and prosecutors saying that Paul Manafort
[21:05.160 --> 21:09.160]  needs to be put in jail for tampering with witnesses.
[21:09.160 --> 21:14.160]  Now, this is a razor's edge
[21:14.160 --> 21:17.160]  that this Russian collusion
[21:17.160 --> 21:21.160]  that Mueller probe is now walking on
[21:21.160 --> 21:26.160]  where they are essentially threatening
[21:26.160 --> 21:28.160]  to jail Manafort.
[21:28.160 --> 21:30.160]  They're putting that idea out there
[21:30.160 --> 21:32.160]  that maybe will jail you,
[21:32.160 --> 21:35.160]  thinking I suppose that they can still try
[21:35.160 --> 21:38.160]  to quote unquote flip him on Trump,
[21:38.160 --> 21:40.160]  even though there's nothing to flip,
[21:40.160 --> 21:43.160]  and they know that.
[21:43.160 --> 21:45.160]  But who knows, maybe there's something
[21:45.160 --> 21:47.160]  from eons ago that Trump did to,
[21:47.160 --> 21:49.160]  I don't know, not pay a tax or something.
[21:49.160 --> 21:51.160]  I mean, who knows, some crazy something like that.
[21:51.160 --> 21:53.160]  But probably that's not even going to happen.
[21:53.160 --> 21:55.160]  That's not even the case.
[21:55.160 --> 21:58.160]  But why are they saying
[21:58.160 --> 22:02.160]  Manafort attempted to tamper with witnesses?
[22:02.160 --> 22:05.160]  Well, the same principle that you apply
[22:05.160 --> 22:07.160]  to everything going on
[22:07.160 --> 22:09.160]  via the Mueller probe right now
[22:09.160 --> 22:11.160]  applies here.
[22:11.160 --> 22:14.160]  They are tampering with witnesses.
[22:14.160 --> 22:18.160]  The Mueller team is tampering with witnesses.
[22:18.160 --> 22:22.160]  The deep state that launched this spy operation
[22:22.160 --> 22:24.160]  into Trump's campaign,
[22:24.160 --> 22:27.160]  which we're now dating back to as soon as April,
[22:27.160 --> 22:29.160]  I think it's April 2015,
[22:29.160 --> 22:32.160]  I'd have to review those documents one more time,
[22:32.160 --> 22:35.160]  but it's all coming out now.
[22:35.160 --> 22:38.160]  And then Chuck Ross has the story in the Daily Caller,
[22:38.160 --> 22:40.160]  Papadopoulos wife,
[22:40.160 --> 22:43.160]  Trump aide was absolutely not involved
[22:43.160 --> 22:45.160]  in Russian collusion.
[22:45.160 --> 22:47.160]  It goes through the whole story.
[22:47.160 --> 22:50.160]  Papadopoulos gets set up
[22:50.160 --> 22:55.160]  at a meeting with some misfud.
[22:55.160 --> 22:59.160]  A conversation goes down
[22:59.160 --> 23:03.160]  where they're discussing Hillary's emails
[23:03.160 --> 23:07.160]  where misfud says that he believes
[23:07.160 --> 23:10.160]  that the Russians have the Hillary emails.
[23:10.160 --> 23:13.160]  Then Papadopoulos is at another meeting.
[23:13.160 --> 23:14.160]  They pulled that story back up
[23:14.160 --> 23:16.160]  because I forgot the guy's name
[23:16.160 --> 23:20.160]  and I didn't print the other pages of this story.
[23:20.160 --> 23:22.160]  Then Papadopoulos, again,
[23:22.160 --> 23:24.160]  having a conversation at a bar
[23:24.160 --> 23:27.160]  where their drinks, I don't know, doesn't matter.
[23:27.160 --> 23:30.160]  And he's talking to some, not misfud, go down.
[23:30.160 --> 23:32.160]  He's talking to the guy from Australia
[23:32.160 --> 23:36.160]  who's an Australian British intelligence officer.
[23:36.160 --> 23:38.160]  And he tells them that he's heard
[23:38.160 --> 23:40.160]  that the Russians have Hillary emails.
[23:40.160 --> 23:44.160]  And then that Australian tells his,
[23:44.160 --> 23:46.160]  I shouldn't say handlers,
[23:46.160 --> 23:49.160]  but shall we say connections, informants?
[23:49.160 --> 23:53.160]  There he is, Downer, Alexander Downer,
[23:53.160 --> 23:55.160]  Australia's High Commissioner to the UK.
[23:55.160 --> 23:58.160]  He goes back and tells British intelligence,
[23:58.160 --> 24:01.160]  hey, this guy's claiming the Russians
[24:01.160 --> 24:06.160]  have compromising information on Hillary Clinton.
[24:06.160 --> 24:10.160]  Then he goes Downer and tells US intelligence,
[24:10.160 --> 24:14.160]  hey, this guy from Trump's campaign
[24:14.160 --> 24:17.160]  claims that the Russians have Hillary Clinton's emails.
[24:17.160 --> 24:20.160]  Well, he heard that from misfud.
[24:20.160 --> 24:25.160]  That's not even his own proprietary thought
[24:25.160 --> 24:28.160]  or idea or information.
[24:28.160 --> 24:31.160]  And now it gets to the US intelligence.
[24:31.160 --> 24:34.160]  And so what do they end up doing?
[24:34.160 --> 24:36.160]  Well, now we've got new documents
[24:36.160 --> 24:39.160]  with the redacted Peter Stroke texts
[24:39.160 --> 24:43.160]  that we now know as far back as July 2015,
[24:43.160 --> 24:47.160]  which is when Stefan Halpert was getting paid
[24:47.160 --> 24:50.160]  and entered the payroll, the informant,
[24:50.160 --> 24:54.160]  the spy who was working with James Comey.
[24:54.160 --> 24:57.160]  And then you find out that that is also
[24:57.160 --> 24:59.160]  when they launched their spy operation
[24:59.160 --> 25:04.160]  into Trump's campaign.
[25:04.160 --> 25:06.160]  Now, that's a story from a while ago
[25:06.160 --> 25:09.160]  that the crew just pulled up.
[25:09.160 --> 25:10.160]  White House is running this.
[25:10.160 --> 25:13.160]  Yeah, Obama wanted oversight of the whole thing.
[25:13.160 --> 25:18.160]  New redacted texts have other...
[25:18.160 --> 25:19.160]  I'd have to pull it up,
[25:19.160 --> 25:22.160]  but they have different phrases and words in there.
[25:22.160 --> 25:23.160]  They were basically using spies.
[25:23.160 --> 25:25.160]  I think it's on-killist spies.
[25:25.160 --> 25:30.160]  I forget what the letters are,
[25:30.160 --> 25:33.160]  but they say lures.
[25:33.160 --> 25:35.160]  And it used to be redacted lures,
[25:35.160 --> 25:38.160]  but now lures is out there and that's spies.
[25:38.160 --> 25:40.160]  So they were basically putting in
[25:40.160 --> 25:45.160]  foreign intelligence operatives
[25:45.160 --> 25:48.160]  out for Papadopoulos to talk to
[25:48.160 --> 25:52.160]  as lures or spies to then get the fake intel
[25:52.160 --> 25:54.160]  that the Russians had Hillary emails,
[25:54.160 --> 25:56.160]  which then makes it back to the United States
[25:56.160 --> 25:59.160]  that the Russians have compromising information on Hillary,
[25:59.160 --> 26:02.160]  which then somehow magically transforms
[26:02.160 --> 26:05.160]  into we must spy on the Trump campaign.
[26:05.160 --> 26:07.160]  And we've got all the documents.
[26:07.160 --> 26:09.160]  We've got the redacted texts.
[26:09.160 --> 26:11.160]  We have the FISA documents.
[26:11.160 --> 26:12.160]  We've got it all.
[26:12.160 --> 26:14.160]  Obama's caught red-handed.
[26:14.160 --> 26:17.160]  Comey's caught red-handed.
[26:17.160 --> 26:21.160]  The entire intelligence community is caught red-handed.
[26:21.160 --> 26:24.160]  McCabe is caught red-handed.
[26:24.160 --> 26:30.160]  The list goes on and on and on.
[26:30.160 --> 26:34.160]  So why then are they threatening to jail Manafort
[26:34.160 --> 26:36.160]  for tampering with witnesses
[26:36.160 --> 26:39.160]  because they tampered with witnesses?
[26:39.160 --> 26:42.160]  They are the ones that were tampering with Papadopoulos.
[26:42.160 --> 26:45.160]  They are the ones that have been tampering with this
[26:45.160 --> 26:51.160]  quote-unquote Russian probe since the very outset
[26:51.160 --> 26:53.160]  where they're spying on the Trump campaign
[26:53.160 --> 26:55.160]  as early as July 2015.
[26:55.160 --> 26:57.160]  Here we are June 2018.
[26:57.160 --> 27:00.160]  How much evidence of Russian collusion do they have?
[27:00.160 --> 27:02.160]  Zero.
[27:02.160 --> 27:06.160]  But what is the ultimate irony?
[27:06.160 --> 27:09.160]  The Trump campaign seems to believe
[27:09.160 --> 27:12.160]  that the Russians have compromising information
[27:12.160 --> 27:14.160]  on Hillary Clinton.
[27:14.160 --> 27:16.160]  What would that be?
[27:16.160 --> 27:19.160]  Could it be the emails that Hillary Clinton
[27:19.160 --> 27:23.160]  deleted from her illegal server?
[27:23.160 --> 27:27.160]  Could it be the information that she bleached bit
[27:27.160 --> 27:29.160]  from her illegal servers?
[27:29.160 --> 27:32.160]  Could it be the information and data
[27:32.160 --> 27:34.160]  that was on the servers that were literally
[27:34.160 --> 27:37.160]  smashed by a hammer?
[27:37.160 --> 27:38.160]  No.
[27:38.160 --> 27:41.160]  Actually, there's an element of truth to this.
[27:41.160 --> 27:44.160]  For you see, the Russians did
[27:44.160 --> 27:47.160]  have compromising information on Hillary Clinton.
[27:47.160 --> 27:53.160]  It's called Uranium One.
[27:53.160 --> 27:55.160]  Amazing.
[27:55.160 --> 27:58.160]  So here the Russians are making deals
[27:58.160 --> 28:02.160]  with Hillary Clinton, Uranium One,
[28:02.160 --> 28:05.160]  actual dirt on Hillary Clinton,
[28:05.160 --> 28:09.160]  somehow gets spun into the Russians have
[28:09.160 --> 28:11.160]  Hillary Clinton's deleted emails,
[28:11.160 --> 28:13.160]  which is only a story,
[28:13.160 --> 28:16.160]  because Hillary Clinton broke the law to begin with.
[28:16.160 --> 28:21.160]  And so now, to bring it home,
[28:21.160 --> 28:26.160]  former U.S. Navy Christian Sausier
[28:26.160 --> 28:29.160]  is suing Obama and Comey
[28:29.160 --> 28:32.160]  for selectively prosecuting him in the case
[28:32.160 --> 28:34.160]  of mishandling classified information
[28:34.160 --> 28:37.160]  where he was charged,
[28:37.160 --> 28:39.160]  Hillary Clinton guilty of the same thing,
[28:39.160 --> 28:42.160]  gets no jail time, gets nothing,
[28:42.160 --> 28:44.160]  gets an extra special back brace
[28:44.160 --> 28:48.160]  so that a spineless fraud and thief
[28:48.160 --> 28:50.160]  like Hillary Clinton can still walk around
[28:50.160 --> 28:51.160]  and give speeches.
[28:51.160 --> 28:54.160]  So Mueller's team tampered with witnesses,
[28:54.160 --> 28:56.160]  Hillary Clinton colluded with the Russians,
[28:56.160 --> 28:59.160]  and it's all blowing up in their face.
[28:59.160 --> 29:01.160]  I tried other brands,
[29:01.160 --> 29:03.160]  but I came back to my sunshine.
[29:03.160 --> 29:05.160]  For the best hot or cold pain relief,
[29:05.160 --> 29:07.160]  get a sunny-bay heating pad.
[29:07.160 --> 29:10.160]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck
[29:10.160 --> 29:12.160]  or back or shoulder.
[29:12.160 --> 29:15.160]  And the best relief for that pain is a sunny-bay heating pad.
[29:15.160 --> 29:18.160]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians
[29:18.160 --> 29:20.160]  said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain
[29:20.160 --> 29:21.160]  is heat therapy?
[29:21.160 --> 29:24.160]  Sunny-bay heating pads are handmade with high quality,
[29:24.160 --> 29:26.160]  can be used at home or at work,
[29:26.160 --> 29:29.160]  and have a lifetime 100% positive rating
[29:29.160 --> 29:31.160]  on both Amazon and Etsy.
[29:31.160 --> 29:32.160]  Why take another pill?
[29:32.160 --> 29:35.160]  Many people use our sunny-bay heating pads alone
[29:35.160 --> 29:37.160]  and got rid of the neck pain.
[29:37.160 --> 29:40.160]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer
[29:40.160 --> 29:42.160]  can take its toll on your body.
[29:42.160 --> 29:45.160]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[29:45.160 --> 29:47.160]  That's why we design and test our handmade products
[29:47.160 --> 29:50.160]  with great care before we introduce them to the public.
[29:50.160 --> 29:53.160]  You can easily find sunny-bay heating pads on Amazon.
[29:53.160 --> 29:57.160]  Just go to Amazon.com and search for sunny-bay heating pads.
[29:57.160 --> 30:00.160]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you
[30:00.160 --> 30:02.160]  about the 60-plus products,
[30:02.160 --> 30:04.160]  we have it in Fuller's life.
[30:04.160 --> 30:05.160]  It'd take hours.
[30:05.160 --> 30:07.160]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[30:07.160 --> 30:08.160]  It's stronger.
[30:08.160 --> 30:10.160]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[30:10.160 --> 30:13.160]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[30:13.160 --> 30:14.160]  It's back in stock.
[30:14.160 --> 30:17.160]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[30:17.160 --> 30:19.160]  It's got the preglonone that's the precursor
[30:19.160 --> 30:21.160]  to all the natural hormones in your body.
[30:21.160 --> 30:24.160]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[30:24.160 --> 30:27.160]  So you can upload it.
[30:27.160 --> 30:30.160]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue,
[30:30.160 --> 30:33.160]  colloidal silver, and iodine 4-5 toothpaste
[30:33.160 --> 30:36.160]  is super blue silver immune gargle.
[30:36.160 --> 30:37.160]  That's a spray you do.
[30:37.160 --> 30:38.160]  You can also swallow it.
[30:38.160 --> 30:40.160]  It's a supplement with iodine,
[30:40.160 --> 30:43.160]  super high-quality silver, and a lot more.
[30:43.160 --> 30:45.160]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[30:45.160 --> 30:48.160]  So thank you all for remembering in FullerStore.com
[30:48.160 --> 30:51.160]  and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake,
[30:51.160 --> 30:53.160]  but it's other people that aren't awake.
[30:53.160 --> 30:55.160]  And it's so essential to spread the word.
[30:55.160 --> 30:57.160]  Again, thank you so much for being part
[30:57.160 --> 31:26.160]  of the Second American Revolution.

[33:24.160 --> 33:29.160]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[33:29.160 --> 33:34.160]  I wasn't intending to go on that rabbit trail
[33:34.160 --> 33:36.160]  in the last segment with Manafort
[33:36.160 --> 33:38.160]  and the Mueller probe and Papadopoulos,
[33:38.160 --> 33:40.160]  but we got that out of the way.
[33:40.160 --> 33:42.160]  But there's all kinds of other news,
[33:42.160 --> 33:44.160]  and I really wanted to get back into that
[33:44.160 --> 33:48.160]  with Dr. Corsi, who's going to join me at 1206.
[33:48.160 --> 33:51.160]  In similar news, though,
[33:51.160 --> 33:56.160]  we mentioned Saucier suing Obama and Comey
[33:56.160 --> 33:58.160]  for sparring Hillary Clinton
[33:58.160 --> 34:02.160]  and prosecuting him for the exact same crimes.
[34:02.160 --> 34:05.160]  Oh, but Obama was the scandal-free president.
[34:05.160 --> 34:08.160]  So this story must be fake news.
[34:08.160 --> 34:10.160]  This, this, no, no, no, no.
[34:10.160 --> 34:12.160]  I don't know, Obama's scandal-free!
[34:12.160 --> 34:15.160]  Come on, man!
[34:15.160 --> 34:19.160]  Oh, you know, I think we've got a news crew
[34:19.160 --> 34:22.160]  doing a man on the street right now
[34:22.160 --> 34:24.160]  that is going to be asking people
[34:24.160 --> 34:26.160]  a certain question about Obama.
[34:26.160 --> 34:28.160]  I wonder if they'll be able to answer it.
[34:28.160 --> 34:29.160]  Looking forward to that.
[34:29.160 --> 34:31.160]  In similar news, Imran Awan
[34:31.160 --> 34:34.160]  allegedly tried to hide his money
[34:34.160 --> 34:36.160]  while DOJ negotiates with him.
[34:36.160 --> 34:39.160]  Former Democrat IT staffer Imran Awan
[34:39.160 --> 34:42.160]  allegedly tried to hide his money.
[34:42.160 --> 34:44.160]  Awan's lawyer claims his client
[34:44.160 --> 34:47.160]  does not have a pot to piss in.
[34:47.160 --> 34:50.160]  Awan is currently under FBI investigation
[34:50.160 --> 34:52.160]  over unauthorized access, house servers,
[34:52.160 --> 34:56.160]  and is indicted on charges of bank fraud.
[34:56.160 --> 35:01.160]  Of course, he had all sorts of phony businesses
[35:01.160 --> 35:03.160]  that his brothers were running
[35:03.160 --> 35:05.160]  and probably laundering money out of.
[35:05.160 --> 35:07.160]  That's where the bank fraud comes from.
[35:07.160 --> 35:10.160]  Getting paid millions and millions of dollars
[35:10.160 --> 35:15.160]  by the Democrat Party for this IT work.
[35:15.160 --> 35:17.160]  Now, they're trying to hide this money
[35:17.160 --> 35:19.160]  and his lawyer's claiming he's broke.
[35:19.160 --> 35:21.160]  Well, where'd all that money go then, bro?
[35:21.160 --> 35:24.160]  You and your brothers made millions.
[35:24.160 --> 35:27.160]  And what did the Democrats know about the Awans?
[35:27.160 --> 35:30.160]  I wonder if they knew anything about the Awans,
[35:30.160 --> 35:32.160]  they wouldn't have hired them.
[35:32.160 --> 35:35.160]  Unless, of course, they were engaging
[35:35.160 --> 35:38.160]  in something other than politics.
[35:38.160 --> 35:40.160]  Hmm.
[35:40.160 --> 35:43.160]  Maybe they're paying the Awans this exorbitant amount of cash
[35:43.160 --> 35:46.160]  because they want it laundered.
[35:46.160 --> 35:47.160]  Hmm. I don't know.
[35:47.160 --> 35:50.160]  Maybe that's why this comes from Luke Rosiak
[35:50.160 --> 35:51.160]  at the Daily Caller.
[35:51.160 --> 35:53.160]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz screamed
[35:53.160 --> 35:56.160]  at house officials to kill hacking probe
[35:56.160 --> 36:00.160]  intervened in Pakistani criminal manner.
[36:00.160 --> 36:05.160]  Well, this is Debbie Wasserman Schultz
[36:05.160 --> 36:08.160]  freaking out right now
[36:08.160 --> 36:12.160]  because she knows she's caught guilty dead to rights.
[36:12.160 --> 36:14.160]  But I'm going to get into both of those stories
[36:14.160 --> 36:19.160]  with Dr. Corsi in the next hour.
[36:19.160 --> 36:20.160]  And in the meantime,
[36:20.160 --> 36:22.160]  I'm going to cover some of this other news
[36:22.160 --> 36:24.160]  to just get it out of the way.
[36:24.160 --> 36:28.160]  This is a heartbreaker here.
[36:28.160 --> 36:33.160]  Amber Alert issued in Virginia, North Carolina
[36:33.160 --> 36:36.160]  after police say registered sex offender
[36:36.160 --> 36:39.160]  snatched seven-month-old baby.
[36:39.160 --> 36:42.160]  And they believe that this baby is in immediate
[36:42.160 --> 36:44.160]  and serious danger.
[36:44.160 --> 36:45.160]  Hmm, hmm, hmm.
[36:45.160 --> 36:48.160]  You have to...
[36:48.160 --> 36:50.160]  Boy.
[36:50.160 --> 36:54.160]  Seven-month-old baby kidnapped by a registered sex offender.
[36:54.160 --> 36:56.160]  Now, there may be some other ripples to this story.
[36:56.160 --> 36:59.160]  We'll see if anybody wants to cover it.
[36:59.160 --> 37:06.160]  But it's really just sick that people are that sick.
[37:06.160 --> 37:09.160]  I think really is what that comes down to.
[37:09.160 --> 37:12.160]  Boy, where do you go from there?
[37:12.160 --> 37:15.160]  Okay, well...
[37:15.160 --> 37:19.160]  Paul Joseph Watson has the story that got linked on Drudge Day.
[37:19.160 --> 37:23.160]  Bilderberg Globalists concerned about populist uprising in Europe.
[37:23.160 --> 37:27.160]  So amongst the topics of discussion at the Bilderberg Group,
[37:27.160 --> 37:29.160]  you have populism in Europe.
[37:29.160 --> 37:30.160]  They can't stand that.
[37:30.160 --> 37:32.160]  They want communism.
[37:32.160 --> 37:35.160]  They have the U.S. midterm elections.
[37:35.160 --> 37:38.160]  They have the post-truth world.
[37:38.160 --> 37:40.160]  The post-truth world.
[37:40.160 --> 37:42.160]  The post-truth world.
[37:42.160 --> 37:45.160]  Oh, my gosh.
[37:45.160 --> 37:52.160]  You realize how much truth has been kept from the general public?
[37:52.160 --> 37:59.160]  I mean, unless you have a good history teacher coming up in American schools,
[37:59.160 --> 38:04.160]  you won't know jack crap about human history.
[38:04.160 --> 38:09.160]  A good history teacher in the United States doesn't even go from the textbook
[38:09.160 --> 38:14.160]  because they know that about half of it's BS.
[38:14.160 --> 38:22.160]  But, oh, see, now that we're actually entering a world where truth media is gaining footing,
[38:22.160 --> 38:25.160]  now that we're entering a world where the President of the United States
[38:25.160 --> 38:33.160]  just says things like it is, now it's a post-truth world.
[38:33.160 --> 38:35.160]  It's been a post-truth world.
[38:35.160 --> 38:39.160]  We're entering the post-post-truth world.
[38:39.160 --> 38:40.160]  That's what this really is.
[38:40.160 --> 38:48.160]  So the Bilderberg Group is going to be addressing how to deal with the post-post-truth world
[38:48.160 --> 38:51.160]  or the truth world.
[38:51.160 --> 38:52.160]  Yeah, there's the Washington Post.
[38:52.160 --> 38:56.160]  Welcome to the post-truth presidency.
[38:56.160 --> 38:58.160]  Oh, yes.
[38:58.160 --> 39:00.160]  Not Obama, though.
[39:00.160 --> 39:03.160]  Not Obama, but does Trump have a magic wand?
[39:03.160 --> 39:04.160]  Economy records.
[39:04.160 --> 39:07.160]  Oh, I said Trump up for that economy.
[39:07.160 --> 39:08.160]  No, no, no, no.
[39:08.160 --> 39:09.160]  That was the truth, President.
[39:09.160 --> 39:10.160]  You want that doctor?
[39:10.160 --> 39:11.160]  You keep that doctor.
[39:11.160 --> 39:13.160]  Nope, you can't keep that doctor.
[39:13.160 --> 39:14.160]  You love your health care plan.
[39:14.160 --> 39:15.160]  You keep that health care plan.
[39:15.160 --> 39:16.160]  Sorry, sorry.
[39:16.160 --> 39:17.160]  You don't have that health care plan.
[39:17.160 --> 39:19.160]  That's not your health care plan.
[39:19.160 --> 39:20.160]  You built the business.
[39:20.160 --> 39:22.160]  You didn't build that business.
[39:22.160 --> 39:26.160]  I built that business.
[39:26.160 --> 39:28.160]  So that's not the post-truth, President.
[39:28.160 --> 39:30.160]  It's Trump who's the truth president.
[39:30.160 --> 39:34.160]  So again, Trump is the post-post-truth president.
[39:34.160 --> 39:36.160]  Obama is the post-truth president.
[39:36.160 --> 39:38.160]  And they don't know what to do.
[39:38.160 --> 39:42.160]  And the Bilderberg Group is going to be meeting in Italy,
[39:42.160 --> 39:48.160]  which is right where a nationalist uprising is going on in the face of the EU right now.
[39:48.160 --> 39:54.160]  So Paul Joseph Watson's story is up at infowars.com.
[39:54.160 --> 39:58.160]  Now, the New York Times, like everyone else is having to admit that Trump knew what he
[39:58.160 --> 40:06.160]  was doing with the North Korean trade deal, really just bamboozled the media and bamboozled
[40:06.160 --> 40:16.160]  the Democrats who ended up siding with North Korea, praising the North Korean propaganda
[40:16.160 --> 40:20.160]  head, Kim Jong-un's sister.
[40:20.160 --> 40:25.160]  But the story from the New York Times is shocking because you read the story.
[40:25.160 --> 40:30.160]  The headline is China's trade war with North Korea is set to soar.
[40:30.160 --> 40:34.160]  China's trade with North Korea is set to soar with a Trump-Kim deal.
[40:34.160 --> 40:37.160]  So yeah, North Korea is going to benefit.
[40:37.160 --> 40:42.160]  Now they're going to have to do deals with China, not just sideways deals that China's
[40:42.160 --> 40:48.160]  been taking advantage of North Korea on just basically keeping the power on over there.
[40:48.160 --> 40:54.160]  And then you read the story and it's all about how now in North Korea they're going to have
[40:54.160 --> 40:55.160]  a middle class.
[40:55.160 --> 40:57.160]  And it's like there's a burgeoning middle class.
[40:57.160 --> 40:59.160]  North Korea looks to have a middle class.
[40:59.160 --> 41:06.160]  The new coming trade and the Trump-Kim deal is going to basically create a North Korean
[41:06.160 --> 41:12.160]  economy where you can have a middle class.
[41:12.160 --> 41:16.160]  But he's the post-truth president.
[41:16.160 --> 41:20.160]  Okay, so he's not the post-communist president.
[41:20.160 --> 41:22.160]  He's not the post-Korean war president.
[41:22.160 --> 41:24.160]  He's the post-truth president.
[41:24.160 --> 41:29.160]  I saw it on the same New York Times that actually printed that story admitting that he's probably
[41:29.160 --> 41:34.160]  saving North Korea and creating a middle class there.
[41:34.160 --> 41:37.160]  Here's Trump this morning, meeting in Singapore with North Korea.
[41:37.160 --> 41:41.160]  Go back to that, guys.
[41:41.160 --> 41:47.160]  Meeting in Singapore with North Korea will hopefully be the start of something big we will soon see.
[41:47.160 --> 41:49.160]  That was President Trump this morning.
[41:49.160 --> 41:53.160]  Of course, Kim Jong-un has to have someone pay for his hotel room because that's the dire
[41:53.160 --> 41:55.160]  straights North Korea is in.
[41:55.160 --> 42:03.160]  Now, I want to explain another story that you're probably seeing here with a little bit more detail.
[42:03.160 --> 42:07.160]  Trump taunts NFL players after nixing Eagles White House visit.
[42:07.160 --> 42:13.160]  Well, first of all, the quote-unquote taunt to me was more of just a joke.
[42:13.160 --> 42:18.160]  But there were only going to be 10 Eagles that showed up.
[42:18.160 --> 42:20.160]  So, of course, he wants to cancel it.
[42:20.160 --> 42:21.160]  Only 10 Eagles are going to show up.
[42:21.160 --> 42:23.160]  I'm sorry, he's got better things to do.
[42:23.160 --> 42:25.160]  That's how he looks at this.
[42:25.160 --> 42:29.160]  And as far as the taunt is concerned, it was more of a joke.
[42:29.160 --> 42:39.160]  And if you don't see the connection with this story, Vince McMahon taps Andrew Luck's dad to be XFL's new commissioner.
[42:39.160 --> 42:41.160]  You don't understand how Trump works.
[42:41.160 --> 42:44.160]  The timing here is perfect.
[42:44.160 --> 42:51.160]  Put Vince McMahon and his competition league with the NFL back in the headlines to put more pressure on the NFL.
[42:51.160 --> 42:53.160]  This is the art of the deal.
[42:53.160 --> 42:54.160]  This is what Trump does.
[42:54.160 --> 42:59.160]  He has more friends and is more popular than the globalists.
[43:24.160 --> 43:26.160]  Alkalinity and pH.
[43:26.160 --> 43:32.160]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[43:32.160 --> 43:36.160]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[43:36.160 --> 43:43.160]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[43:43.160 --> 43:48.160]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[43:48.160 --> 43:54.160]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[43:54.160 --> 43:59.160]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[43:59.160 --> 44:04.160]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said,
[44:04.160 --> 44:06.160]  America is back.
[44:06.160 --> 44:08.160]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore.
[44:08.160 --> 44:12.160]  But patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge.
[44:12.160 --> 44:15.160]  And the world is taking notice.

[45:06.160 --> 45:14.160]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now. I remember back when infowars and prison planet,
[45:14.160 --> 45:19.160]  it was just blue text on a white screen and it had to load down the page on my dial-up internet
[45:19.160 --> 45:24.160]  and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all you get.
[45:24.160 --> 45:30.160]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2,
[45:30.160 --> 45:36.160]  the SuperMail Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, MycoZX body, it's all amazing.
[45:36.160 --> 45:37.160]  Thank you brother.
[45:37.160 --> 45:42.160]  Yeah and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind,
[45:42.160 --> 45:47.160]  you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more you know God,
[45:47.160 --> 45:50.160]  the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[45:50.160 --> 45:55.160]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there,
[45:55.160 --> 46:04.160]  1776 World War.
[46:04.160 --> 46:10.160]  Years ago, InfoWars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[46:10.160 --> 46:13.160]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment,
[46:13.160 --> 46:18.160]  our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[46:18.160 --> 46:21.160]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula,
[46:21.160 --> 46:26.160]  a unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[46:26.160 --> 46:29.160]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.

[47:03.160 --> 47:09.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:09.160 --> 47:13.160]  The implanting things in your brain is beyond the creepy line.
[47:13.160 --> 47:16.160]  Take your deskie in your hands and don't let these people control your future.
[47:16.160 --> 47:18.160]  Initialize my modem.
[47:18.160 --> 47:21.160]  I've got one that can sing.
[47:21.160 --> 47:48.420]  with 앉ing on a
[47:48.420 --> 47:50.420]  prism.
[47:50.420 --> 47:52.420]  Come on get down with the sickness
[47:52.420 --> 47:54.920]  Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[47:54.920 --> 47:57.920]  Open up a coffee and then they're going to make
[47:57.920 --> 47:59.920]  Get up, come on get down with the sickness
[47:59.920 --> 48:02.920]  You might not get up, come on get down with the sickness
[48:02.920 --> 48:05.420]  You might not get up, come on get down with the sickness
[48:05.420 --> 48:07.920]  And this has now come over me
[48:07.920 --> 48:09.920]  Do you know what do we?
[48:09.920 --> 48:12.920]  If you are receiving this transmission
[48:12.920 --> 48:14.920]  You are the resistance
[48:15.920 --> 48:19.920]  Well we've hit an interesting nexus point here
[48:19.920 --> 48:22.920]  With humanity and the technology we use
[48:22.920 --> 48:25.920]  And the merging of the two
[48:25.920 --> 48:28.920]  Where it's becoming more and more a part of
[48:28.920 --> 48:33.920]  Not just our daily routine but of us
[48:33.920 --> 48:37.920]  Literally becoming almost part of us
[48:37.920 --> 48:41.920]  Where the end game is of course to merge with machines
[48:41.920 --> 48:44.920]  Will we be forced to merge with machines
[48:44.920 --> 48:47.920]  Because the environment we will create
[48:47.920 --> 48:50.920]  Will we volunteer to merge with machines
[48:50.920 --> 48:52.920]  Because it's going to be trendy and liberal
[48:52.920 --> 48:55.920]  And who doesn't want to have the best eyesight
[48:55.920 --> 48:57.920]  In the world or whatever the case may be
[48:57.920 --> 49:00.920]  Sonar who knows what they'll do
[49:00.920 --> 49:03.920]  But the nexus point we've reached is
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.920]  We're now recognizing what the technology
[49:08.920 --> 49:10.920]  Is doing to us
[49:10.920 --> 49:13.920]  We're now realizing how we're becoming slaves
[49:13.920 --> 49:16.920]  To the technology and we're not just
[49:16.920 --> 49:19.920]  Learning about the psychological side effects
[49:19.920 --> 49:21.920]  But also the physical side effects
[49:21.920 --> 49:25.920]  Where the 5G rollout could
[49:25.920 --> 49:28.920]  I mean seriously who knows the devastating effects
[49:28.920 --> 49:30.920]  Of the 5G rollout
[49:30.920 --> 49:33.920]  The 6G you'll be game over
[49:33.920 --> 49:36.920]  But we're kind of realizing all of this now
[49:36.920 --> 49:39.920]  The tech companies knew it the whole time
[49:39.920 --> 49:42.920]  There have been studies released that indicated this
[49:42.920 --> 49:44.920]  Now they're just coming out with the real studies
[49:44.920 --> 49:46.920]  That they knew the whole time
[49:46.920 --> 49:50.920]  The 5G causing cancer, the light patterns
[49:50.920 --> 49:54.920]  Manipulating your brain waves
[49:54.920 --> 49:56.920]  I mean it's all out there
[49:56.920 --> 50:00.920]  The crew is just going through all the stories right now
[50:00.920 --> 50:03.920]  So I'm going to get into this here
[50:03.920 --> 50:07.920]  But first you've got this story from Michael Snyder
[50:07.920 --> 50:09.920]  The Department of Homeland Security
[50:09.920 --> 50:11.920]  Plans to compile a list of all bloggers
[50:11.920 --> 50:14.920]  Journalists and social media influencers
[50:14.920 --> 50:19.920]  Now it's kind of a no duh situation
[50:19.920 --> 50:21.920]  But Michael Snyder breaks it all down in the story
[50:21.920 --> 50:24.920]  On his website, endoftheamericandream.com
[50:24.920 --> 50:28.920]  But I just want to say this
[50:28.920 --> 50:31.920]  Drudge links to this story
[50:31.920 --> 50:37.920]  But links to the zero hedge link
[50:37.920 --> 50:38.920]  To the story
[50:38.920 --> 50:41.920]  So the story, the link goes to zero hedge on Drudge
[50:41.920 --> 50:43.920]  Instead of end of the American dream
[50:43.920 --> 50:46.920]  Where I just say, Matt Drudge
[50:46.920 --> 50:50.920]  We need you to give Michael Snyder fair attention here
[50:50.920 --> 50:52.920]  You know, he's running for Congress
[50:52.920 --> 50:56.920]  So there's the link that Drudge links to on zero hedge
[50:56.920 --> 51:00.920]  I really wish Drudge would have linked to the original post
[51:00.920 --> 51:03.920]  On the American dream, endoftheamericandream.com
[51:03.920 --> 51:04.920]  By Michael Snyder
[51:04.920 --> 51:06.920]  Because Michael Snyder is running for Congress
[51:06.920 --> 51:09.920]  And he needs more attention
[51:09.920 --> 51:12.920]  So not sure if Drudge even was aware of that
[51:12.920 --> 51:13.920]  Or if it was him
[51:13.920 --> 51:14.920]  But I just wanted to point that out
[51:14.920 --> 51:15.920]  But it all comes back to the same thing
[51:15.920 --> 51:18.920]  So now we know whatever you say and do
[51:18.920 --> 51:20.920]  In the digital world, probably being tracked
[51:20.920 --> 51:22.920]  Probably being spied on
[51:22.920 --> 51:24.920]  Maybe not by human intelligence
[51:24.920 --> 51:25.920]  But at least by artificial intelligence
[51:25.920 --> 51:27.920]  And some respects
[51:27.920 --> 51:29.920]  And stuff you do on social media
[51:29.920 --> 51:33.920]  Is pretty much out there for anyone to discover
[51:33.920 --> 51:36.920]  Or even steal
[51:36.920 --> 51:42.920]  For example, I have certain shortcomings
[51:42.920 --> 51:43.920]  When it comes to this stuff
[51:43.920 --> 51:45.920]  I think I'm probably on the better end of things
[51:45.920 --> 51:47.920]  Where I don't really get on social media much
[51:47.920 --> 51:52.920]  But it's really not that complex
[51:52.920 --> 51:55.920]  You don't have to be a genius to figure this out
[51:55.920 --> 51:59.920]  When you sign up for a Twitter account
[51:59.920 --> 52:02.920]  Or a Facebook account or what have you
[52:02.920 --> 52:07.920]  Your information goes into their databases
[52:07.920 --> 52:12.920]  You don't think that a radical within
[52:12.920 --> 52:15.920]  Facebook or Twitter or who knows what
[52:15.920 --> 52:18.920]  May be motivated to get access to your
[52:18.920 --> 52:20.920]  Private information and share that with others
[52:20.920 --> 52:23.920]  So people are starting to realize this
[52:23.920 --> 52:26.920]  Here's the story from Science Daily
[52:26.920 --> 52:28.920]  Adolescents vulnerable to insomnia
[52:28.920 --> 52:31.920]  Depression from prolonged screen time
[52:31.920 --> 52:33.920]  Just one of dozens of studies about that
[52:33.920 --> 52:35.920]  Depression, everything
[52:35.920 --> 52:38.920]  And now even Apple is unveiling ways
[52:38.920 --> 52:40.920]  To help limit iPhone usage
[52:40.920 --> 52:44.920]  Of course we knew about how Steve Jobs
[52:44.920 --> 52:47.920]  Didn't let his children use iPads
[52:47.920 --> 52:49.920]  How Tim Cook I don't think lets his kids
[52:49.920 --> 52:51.920]  Use iPads either
[52:51.920 --> 52:58.920]  So Apple now comes out with their support plan
[52:58.920 --> 53:01.920]  For phone addiction
[53:01.920 --> 53:03.920]  So guys let's go first to clip 7
[53:03.920 --> 53:08.920]  This is Apple's new support for phone addiction
[53:08.920 --> 53:11.920]  Screen time empowers you with both insight
[53:11.920 --> 53:16.920]  And control over how you spend your time
[53:16.920 --> 53:18.920]  Apple is facing criticism about our
[53:18.920 --> 53:21.920]  Increasingly unhealthy dependence on iPhones
[53:21.920 --> 53:23.920]  The company responded Monday with an iOS feature
[53:23.920 --> 53:25.920]  To help us monitor and limit our usage
[53:25.920 --> 53:28.920]  With reports, every week you get a weekly
[53:28.920 --> 53:32.920]  Activity summary that details how you used
[53:32.920 --> 53:34.920]  Your iPhone or iPad
[53:34.920 --> 53:37.920]  You tap in and you get to view your full
[53:37.920 --> 53:39.920]  Activity report
[53:39.920 --> 53:41.920]  It's really detailed to get deep insight
[53:41.920 --> 53:43.920]  On how much time you're spending
[53:43.920 --> 53:44.920]  Where you're spending it
[53:44.920 --> 53:45.920]  Pause it right there
[53:45.920 --> 53:46.920]  And even how you're using it
[53:46.920 --> 53:49.920]  Yeah, Apple and Google have already been
[53:49.920 --> 53:51.920]  Doing that to you
[53:51.920 --> 53:53.920]  They're just showing you what they've been
[53:53.920 --> 53:55.920]  Doing to you for years
[53:55.920 --> 53:56.920]  Oh you love it, go back
[53:56.920 --> 53:58.920]  It breaks down during the day
[53:58.920 --> 53:59.920]  Or the night
[53:59.920 --> 54:01.920]  Sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night
[54:01.920 --> 54:02.920]  And you look at your phone
[54:02.920 --> 54:03.920]  Maybe just to check the time
[54:03.920 --> 54:06.920]  And you're confronted with something like this
[54:06.920 --> 54:08.920]  Barrage of notifications that spin you up
[54:08.920 --> 54:11.920]  And keep you from falling back asleep
[54:11.920 --> 54:13.920]  And so we're introducing
[54:13.920 --> 54:15.920]  Do not disturb during bedtime
[54:15.920 --> 54:16.920]  Where all you'll see
[54:16.920 --> 54:18.920]  Oh yeah, you don't already have that option
[54:18.920 --> 54:21.920]  Nothing to get you spun up
[54:21.920 --> 54:24.920]  Yeah, you can't just turn off notifications
[54:24.920 --> 54:28.920]  Or put your phone in a different room
[54:28.920 --> 54:31.920]  What?
[54:31.920 --> 54:34.920]  Actually I did this social experiment
[54:34.920 --> 54:36.920]  And again, you know, for me
[54:36.920 --> 54:39.920]  I feel like I have to have my cell phone
[54:39.920 --> 54:41.920]  Attached me in case something comes up here
[54:41.920 --> 54:44.920]  Or in the news and I need to report it
[54:44.920 --> 54:45.920]  So maybe I'm a hypocrite
[54:45.920 --> 54:47.920]  Maybe I'm just forced to be that way
[54:47.920 --> 54:50.920]  But I actually did an experiment myself
[54:50.920 --> 54:53.920]  Where for a couple weeks I left my phone
[54:53.920 --> 54:55.920]  In a different room
[54:55.920 --> 54:57.920]  And I just didn't even have my phone in the room
[54:57.920 --> 54:59.920]  I slept so much better
[54:59.920 --> 55:01.920]  It was very noticeable
[55:01.920 --> 55:03.920]  So you can just do that for yourself
[55:03.920 --> 55:04.920]  And find out
[55:04.920 --> 55:06.920]  So here's Apple, all the studies
[55:06.920 --> 55:07.920]  Everything coming out
[55:07.920 --> 55:09.920]  You know, the iPhone, the apps
[55:09.920 --> 55:11.920]  The smartphones, the screen time
[55:11.920 --> 55:13.920]  It's messing with us
[55:13.920 --> 55:15.920]  The 5G is messing with our DNA
[55:15.920 --> 55:18.920]  It's messing with our reproductive systems
[55:18.920 --> 55:21.920]  The screen time is messing with our psychology
[55:21.920 --> 55:24.920]  Messing with our endorphins
[55:24.920 --> 55:26.920]  The whole thing, it's all going on
[55:26.920 --> 55:28.920]  Manipulating us
[55:28.920 --> 55:30.920]  Declassified documents show that the CIA
[55:30.920 --> 55:33.920]  Can get access to anything on the digital world
[55:33.920 --> 55:36.920]  Other mistakenly leaked documents show
[55:36.920 --> 55:38.920]  How the government can use the cell phones
[55:38.920 --> 55:42.920]  To actually manipulate your physical behavior
[55:42.920 --> 55:44.920]  So that all comes out
[55:44.920 --> 55:46.920]  But listen and look
[55:46.920 --> 55:48.920]  At what ESPN is doing now
[55:48.920 --> 55:51.920]  To market their new app
[55:51.920 --> 55:54.920]  Leaving home is one thing
[55:54.920 --> 55:56.920]  But leaving my sports
[55:56.920 --> 55:58.920]  I could never do that
[55:58.920 --> 56:00.920]  You have no idea how hard it used to be
[56:00.920 --> 56:02.920]  Until the new ESPN app came along
[56:02.920 --> 56:04.920]  We're best mates
[56:04.920 --> 56:06.920]  I can take it anywhere
[56:06.920 --> 56:08.920]  Now with ESPN Plus
[56:08.920 --> 56:10.920]  We stream everything together
[56:10.920 --> 56:12.920]  So just pause it right there
[56:12.920 --> 56:14.920]  So just for the radio audience
[56:14.920 --> 56:16.920]  He's walking around
[56:16.920 --> 56:18.920]  He's at a beautiful beach
[56:18.920 --> 56:20.920]  He's out with some friends
[56:20.920 --> 56:22.920]  Playing some bags
[56:22.920 --> 56:24.920]  He's walking around
[56:24.920 --> 56:26.920]  He doesn't have any friends
[56:26.920 --> 56:28.920]  But he's got his ESPN app
[56:28.920 --> 56:30.920]  On his smartphone
[56:30.920 --> 56:32.920]  And he can finally live his full life
[56:32.920 --> 56:34.920]  Rewind at 10 seconds
[56:34.920 --> 56:36.920]  This is so beautiful
[56:36.920 --> 56:38.920]  Here he is eating breakfast
[56:38.920 --> 56:40.920]  But he's got his ESPN app
[56:40.920 --> 56:42.920]  He's got his sports
[56:42.920 --> 56:44.920]  Here he is in a beautiful walk
[56:44.920 --> 56:46.920]  By an ocean or sea
[56:46.920 --> 56:48.920]  But he's staring at his phone
[56:48.920 --> 56:50.920]  Here he is with friends staring at his phone
[56:50.920 --> 56:52.920]  Heck
[56:52.920 --> 56:54.920]  I'm even starting to get into American sports
[56:56.920 --> 56:58.920]  Now
[56:58.920 --> 57:00.920]  If they were doing that as a joke
[57:00.920 --> 57:02.920]  I think it would be funny
[57:02.920 --> 57:04.920]  That did not seem like a joke
[57:04.920 --> 57:06.920]  That seemed like the real deal
[57:06.920 --> 57:08.920]  Wow man, your whole life
[57:08.920 --> 57:10.920]  Is the ESPN app on a phone
[57:10.920 --> 57:12.920]  And now that is your life
[57:12.920 --> 57:14.920]  When you go out in the real world
[57:14.920 --> 57:16.920]  You're stuck on your phone
[57:16.920 --> 57:18.920]  Looking at the ESPN app
[57:20.920 --> 57:22.920]  So what do we do then?
[57:22.920 --> 57:24.920]  This is a serious question
[57:24.920 --> 57:26.920]  Maybe I should open up the phone lines
[57:26.920 --> 57:28.920]  What do we do?
[57:28.920 --> 57:30.920]  Do we just commit
[57:30.920 --> 57:32.920]  To putting the phones away
[57:32.920 --> 57:34.920]  And readjust
[57:34.920 --> 57:36.920]  Or do we just accept
[57:36.920 --> 57:38.920]  The reality for what it is
[57:38.920 --> 57:40.920]  To go deeper and deeper
[57:40.920 --> 57:42.920]  Into this technology dive
[57:42.920 --> 57:44.920]  So deep that we can never even get back to the surface
[57:44.920 --> 57:46.920]  We'll be right back with Dr. Corsi
[57:46.920 --> 58:10.920]  Don't go anywhere
[58:16.920 --> 58:18.920]  We are the most hated news source
[58:18.920 --> 58:20.920]  In the world by globalist
[58:20.920 --> 58:22.920]  It is so critical that you go to
[58:22.920 --> 58:24.920]  Infowars.com
[58:24.920 --> 58:26.920]  Or slash newsletter
[58:26.920 --> 58:28.920]  And sign up for the free newsletter
[58:28.920 --> 58:30.920]  So we can be in contact with you
[58:30.920 --> 58:32.920]  And so the censors can't bully their way in
[58:32.920 --> 58:34.920]  And block us being able to engage
[58:34.920 --> 58:36.920]  In free open dialogue
[58:36.920 --> 58:38.920]  As a society that is critical to this fight
[58:38.920 --> 58:40.920]  We will prevail if you take action
[58:40.920 --> 58:42.920]  We will take action
[58:42.920 --> 58:44.920]  We will take action
[58:44.920 --> 58:46.920]  We will prevail if you take action
[58:46.920 --> 59:15.920]  And I know you will
[59:46.920 --> 59:49.920]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.920]  Alright, Dr. Jerry Corsi is with me now
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.920]  Now
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.920]  And I just want to say this before we bring
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.920]  Dr. Corsi in
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:19.420]  coursey in. I have decided in the third hour I'm going to open up the phone lines. As of
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:24.520]  right now it's guest free. So in the third hour we may hear from Alex Jones but I am
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:28.860]  going to open up the phone lines. We may even dip into that in the second hour. Specifically
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:38.640]  though what should we do about the smartphones? What should we do as we are going down the,
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.120]  I kind of like the analogy I said actually last edit. We're diving deeper and deeper
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:49.160]  and deeper into this technology. But are we going to get so deep that we can no longer
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:55.760]  come back up to the surface? Is it no longer an option or do we pause now and wonder? Maybe
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.760]  we should go back up to the surface for a minute and reconsider what we've seen so far.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.280]  So I'm going to open up the phone lines maybe later in this hour but definitely in the third
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:11.520]  hour for that. But in the meantime Dr. Jerry Corsi joins me now. Now Dr. Corsi there's
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:19.000]  two developments happening right now domestically that I'd kind of like to get in with you here.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:26.240]  You've got the Mueller prosecutor saying that Manafort should be put in jail for tampering
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.280]  with witnesses. It's my view that's what they're doing. You've got them using this
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:38.840]  Papadopoulos situation as a shall we say catalyst to get the spying going on the Trump campaign
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:42.840]  which we're now learning may have even dated back to as early as April 2015, certainly
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:49.640]  July 2015. What do you think about the Papadopoulos story where it looks like that was real witness
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:55.000]  tampering by the deep state? But then you've got kind of another wing here that's not going
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.600]  away but not getting the press attention. The Imran Awan and the Awan Brothers investigation
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.600]  where they're hiding money, they're trying to flee the country, Wasserman Schultz freaks
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:10.280]  out about the server, threatens the police, now threatening officials apparently screaming
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:15.800]  at them says the Daily Caller. So just in the short segment Dr. Corsi, what do you think
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.800]  we need to get into here in the next half hour?
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:24.400]  Well, I think you're first of all right. We just got 500 new pages from the Senate of
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:33.120]  the Swarovski page text messages and they made clear that Papadopoulos was an agent
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:39.640]  of the federal government who wore a wire. So he was an agent going back to December
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:48.440]  2015 which is way before James Comey argued that we started the counterintelligence investigation.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:55.360]  Comey said that was in July 2016 and it appears that we had our FBI agent Papadopoulos go
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:06.840]  to London to talk to more CIA agents and there's two figures, Stephen Halper and the Australian,
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:14.560]  this guy Downey or Doudney. So we had a whole bunch of our spies talking to our CIA agents
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:21.440]  in order to create the story, falsified story, that Trump was colluding with Russia. It appears
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:28.080]  to have been a entrapment scheme going back to December 2015 and that's pretty startling.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:33.840]  That's pretty amazing actually. And what I find in the other part of this, I'm sorry
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.840]  about that.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.480]  That's all right. Why don't you hit ignore on that and I'll just take over for a second
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:44.480]  here. Yeah. And it's amazing too because again, when you look at the Papadopoulos situation,
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:49.620]  you mentioned the, I think it was a downer. I always forget his name for some reason too.
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:54.640]  When you look at how Papadopoulos was kind of thrown around and tossed around there to
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:59.760]  get the reason to spy, but then you get the newly redacted 500 texts that show that they
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:06.640]  were sending spies in, they admit it in these texts as soon as 2015. And we find out that
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:13.360]  self, Stephen Halper, who was Comey's spy, Comey's link was reintroduced on the payroll
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:18.240]  as early as July 2015, of course, a month after Trump announced. So all the dots are
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.760]  starting to connect here, Dr. Corsi.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:28.200]  And what is connecting into is the entrapment scheme of spies and CIA agents that were designed
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:35.320]  even before Donald Trump was in the primaries to penetrate his campaign and pollute it with
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:40.960]  his Russian collusion narrative. This is clearly an entrapment scheme and I'm maintaining
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:46.400]  a coup d'etat scheme. And then with the Awan brothers, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, I think
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.920]  is really in it very, very deep and it needs to be more thoroughly investigated.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:55.600]  Yeah, I'm wondering if she's not freaking out because she knew about that money laundering.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.360]  We're going to be right back with Dr. Corsi.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:02.960]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home. But sometimes

[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:22.920]  I'll tell you, it's incredible. I mean, everything's pretty much incredible when it comes to this
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:31.760]  Russian collusion probe. But now you wonder, how did this happen where the FBI and clapper
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:38.160]  admit to spying on the Trump campaign? You get the declassified texts that admit they
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:43.440]  were spying on the Trump campaign. You get the unredacted texts that talk about luring
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:50.360]  people in with intelligence assets. You get the documents of Stefan Halper getting rehired
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:58.360]  onto the FBI in July 2015, a month after Trump announced he was running. You've got all these
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:03.160]  foreign intelligence assets like Christopher Steele and Downer with their connections
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:10.720]  to spreading false information and using that to then get the quote unquote reason to get
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:16.320]  the FISA warrant to spy on President Trump, which was actually just using paid for Clinton
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:21.600]  opposition research, which was fake. Did the FBI know it? Did the FISA courts know it?
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:27.240]  Did Obama know it? I would bet yes, but I guess we're still waiting to find that out.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:33.240]  But perhaps the most amazing thing, Dr. Corsi, is what we're seeing now where even though
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:38.720]  they're admitting they spied, they've used about six different terms to say spy now,
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:45.320]  but they have said spy, human resource officer, intelligence officer, whatever, they use all
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:49.960]  these different terms. Spying, they were spying on the Trump campaign. They admit it, but
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:57.400]  Dr. Corsi, somehow, some way, Vox, New York Times, even though they originally printed
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:01.960]  the story that they were spying on Trump, they all say there was no spying on Trump.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.840]  They're making up fake news. There was no spying on Trump. We're like, wait a second,
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.680]  the people that did it just admitted they did it. Now you're gaslighting me telling
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:14.120]  me it didn't happen? I mean, is that not the most incredible thing where even the people
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:19.800]  that spied have admitted they spied? We have the declassified documents. We have the unredacted
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:24.360]  text. We know they spied. And you still have news outlets that are claiming that it never
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:30.320]  happened. You're fake news for saying it. I mean, if this isn't 1984 level, I don't know
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.800]  what is, Dr. Corsi.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:37.480]  Well, I think, oh, and you pegged it. I think that's exactly right. And what I think most
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:44.000]  people don't appreciate is that we're at the end, I think, of the first phase, which I've
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.840]  always typified as the attempt to get Donald Trump impeached. And this is a this a failed
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:56.920]  effort now. And I see all the signs with Giuliani saying, you know, first of all, Donald Trump
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:01.160]  tweeting out that he could pardon himself, which by the way, he could.
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.960]  The only the only first of all, I don't even know why that became a story, but just to
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.880]  clarify, the only thing Trump couldn't pardon himself on his impeachment, which they don't
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.880]  have.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:13.440]  Well, but see, and the point is he the point of that was to say to taunt to Mueller and
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:19.640]  say, go ahead and impeach me. We got to bring it. And then Giuliani is basically saying
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:24.240]  the same thing saying, I don't know if we'll testify, interview subpoenas, we'll take it
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:30.880]  to the Supreme Court. Now, these are these are the calling Mueller's bluff. And this is
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:35.800]  the end game here of the impeachment attempt, because Trump has decided to go ahead and
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:40.360]  play hardball. He's going to call the bluff, show me your cards, Mueller. What do you got?
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:45.560]  You want to go to the Supreme Court subpoena, I mean, fine. You want to impeach me fine.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:50.960]  Otherwise, you've got nothing. And I can pardon myself and walk free and end your whole deal
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:58.320]  tomorrow. Now, Trump won't pardon himself again for political reasons. But the point is the
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:03.520]  messages have been communicated and received by Mueller. And now Mueller's bluff has been
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.840]  called and it's up to Mueller to see what he wants to do. And I think Trump will be happy
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:11.680]  to go to the Supreme Court. I think Trump will win at the Supreme Court was my understanding
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:17.720]  too that the only reason this story of Trump pardoning himself really became a story was
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:22.680]  because you had the Clinton operative George step on all of us, George Stephanopoulos, who
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:28.120]  literally started in media as a Clinton operative, huge Clinton supporter. He has an interview
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:32.840]  with Giuliani where he's basically just forcing the question, just forcing the issue like
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:37.400]  would he pardon himself? Could he pardon himself? Will he pardon himself? Just forcing it and
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.680]  then you know how it goes. And then it becomes a media story. So this is how the operatives
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:47.200]  work. Step on all of us, George, step on all of us at ABC, bores into Giuliani, forces
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:51.400]  home the question of would he pardon himself? Then it becomes a big headline, even though
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.080]  there was nothing really there, except a Clinton operative forcing it into the mainstream
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.080]  news.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:01.600]  Well, you're right exactly in terms of how these operatives for Clinton and work. But
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:07.260]  I think what I'm trying to point out is that there's another story here and that is that
[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:14.160]  Giuliani played Stephanopoulos for a chump because Giuliani was happy to say that Trump
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.920]  could pardon himself because that forces the hand. In other words, he's communicating
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:25.560]  not to Stephanopoulos, but to Mueller. If you've got anything on me, you want to impeach
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:31.760]  me, bring it. Otherwise, I'm not testifying. We're going to the Supreme Court and I'm shutting
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:37.720]  you down. These are all end game moves. These are all calling Mueller's bluff, which means
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:43.440]  that Trump has decided to expose that Mueller's got nothing and put an end to Mueller's prosecution
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:47.800]  efforts. That's what this is really all about.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:55.040]  So I estimate then with the most recent story coming out of this, Manafort attempted to
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:00.720]  tamper with witnesses. Mueller prosecutors say every other claim they've made has really
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:06.280]  been true about them. So I'm now, I mean, you learn how to play these guys really, really
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:13.200]  quickly. So it's my estimation now that they realize that it's them that are guilty of
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:17.400]  tampering with witnesses. It's Mueller that's guilty of tampering with witnesses trying to
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:21.160]  get them to quote unquote flip on Trump. There's nothing to flip on, but they're the ones that
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.160]  have been tampering with witnesses tampering with Papadopoulos, tampering just tampering
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:29.520]  the whole time with spy gate, lying about it. Maybe we spied. Oh, we spied for protection.
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.160]  Oh, well, we weren't spying. So it's, it's to me, it's them that have been tampering
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.000]  with witnesses. Now they realize, oh, that could come back and haunt them. So their point
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.520]  of the finger at Manafort. I mean, this is what they do. The Russian collusion. I mean,
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:46.320]  everything. Do you think that's what's going on with this new narrative that they're saying
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:51.080]  Manafort tampered with witnesses, Dr. Corsi? Yes, I think it's exactly what's going on
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:57.360]  that Mueller has always badgered. Mueller is a crooked prosecutor. We know this back to
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.680]  the Enron days. He badgers witnesses. He tells them that he's going to do all kinds of horrible
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:08.000]  things if they don't produce the story he wants, threatening to indict them. Now what
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.400]  he's denying here is Manafort's right to understand what these witnesses are going
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:18.960]  to say. Manafort has a right to prepare his testimony. He's got a right to talk to Mueller's
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.000]  witnesses. What Mueller is afraid of is the Manafort is going to discover that these witnesses
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.960]  were tampered with. And that's going to be another cause for Mueller to cause motion
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:35.360]  the court for a mistrial on prosecutorial misconduct. And I'm certain that Mueller did
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:41.720]  badger the witnesses and that there is prosecutorial misconduct because that's Mueller's MO. He
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.960]  does it all the time.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:49.120]  Now let's get into Flynn here in the last two minutes of this segment. It looks more
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:54.640]  and more, as we're learning more about this, that Flynn was the target of spying, perhaps
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:01.120]  even before Trump. And now you're looking at a situation with General Flynn, how he
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:06.320]  pleads guilty to a crime he didn't commit just to avoid all the legal damages and everything.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:10.440]  Now they're saying new evidence is going to clear him of that. Well, he was already cleared.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:15.480]  But I'm beginning to wonder, looking at Flynn's situation where, if not for his own personal
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:21.920]  safety, why he declared guilty, even though he was innocent, he realized that he was perhaps
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:27.880]  even a bigger target before Trump of the deep state, knowing all the knowledge and information
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:31.520]  he had. And then once he became linked up with Trump, that's when they became really
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:36.080]  threatened and started spying on Trump. But what is your estimation right now of Flynn's
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.400]  involvement in this as we now learn that they were perhaps spying on Flynn years before
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.400]  Trump?
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:46.480]  Well, I don't think Flynn lied. And I think we now know, I think you're right, that it
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:52.680]  was to get Flynn because prosecutors thought he would turn evidence against Donald Trump
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:58.920]  on the Russian collusion. But Flynn did not lie. And again, it's Mueller's prosecutorial
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:03.400]  misconduct. Flynn had to sell his house to defend himself. Mueller said, if you don't
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:08.720]  plead guilty, I'm going to investigate criminally. Your son was acting as the PR assistance for
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:14.040]  General Flynn at this time. And we just learned the last two days that Sally Yates lied that
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:18.800]  she came over to the White House and said that Flynn was not under investigation. And
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:24.360]  when Trump fired Comey, he had no reason to believe that Flynn was going to be indicted.
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:29.440]  This whole thing was saying no, Flynn did not lie. He did not lie. And then Strozik and
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:35.440]  McCabe changed the interrogation report, which also Mueller did not give over to the defense.
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:41.280]  He violated the Brady rule. This thing stinks. The whole prosecution of Flynn stinks.
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:46.200]  They broke all these laws because they didn't think Trump would win. And they knew if Hillary
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:50.000]  would have won, they wouldn't have to deal with any of this. Now they're scurrying about
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.560]  like cockroaches getting shown the light and they don't know what to do. They're about
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:57.360]  to get stepped on and squashed.

[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:40.560]  to Alex Jones.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.280]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, I've got a couple things on my desk right here before we get
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:50.640]  back with Dr. Corsi. I've got the super blue fluoride free toothpaste with the colloidal
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:56.200]  silver and nascent iodine in it. And then I've got the super blue silver immune gargle
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:02.640]  right here with the same silver and iodine formula right there in a spray bottle. Now
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.460]  let me explain to you what's so incredible about these two products. First of all, the
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:14.520]  toothpaste here, everybody uses toothpaste. Alright, at least I hope. Stennis recommended.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:22.960]  So why not use the best toothpaste and shop with the good guys at InfoWarsStore.com. And
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:28.480]  why this is so incredible, not only is this a great product, not only is this a fantastic
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:38.600]  toothpaste that I use here, look at the reviews, 3,500 reviews, 4.8 stars. And you've got it
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:44.480]  on special right now. What is this, 20% off right now guys? 20% off super blue fluoride
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:51.000]  free toothpaste. So if you're not getting your toothpaste from InfoWarsStore.com, why
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:22:00.080]  not? And if you would, if everybody that listened to this broadcast this week went to InfoWarsStore.com
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:04.320]  and got super blue fluoride free toothpaste and then just decided to switch to super blue
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:10.960]  fluoride free toothpaste, we could expand to be 24 hours live probably by the end this
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:16.920]  year and it would not be near the financial burden that it is with the expansion of the
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:21.360]  live program and the hiring more crew or anything. So that's what makes super blue fluoride free
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:25.920]  toothpaste so incredible. Not only is it a great product, everybody use it, it could
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:33.040]  fund everything we do here. Then you have the super blue silver immune gargle. Now I
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:39.920]  bit my lip on, I think it was either Friday or Saturday, I bit my lip bad and had a huge
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:45.440]  cut in my lip and it's frustrating when you deal with this, it gets swollen and you bite
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:49.200]  it again and then it's bleeding again and it's like, what do you do? And then I thought,
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:56.600]  wait a second, why don't I use the super blue silver immune gargle and spray it on there?
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:03.840]  I sprayed it on there Sunday, Monday and now Tuesday, it's almost totally gone. That's
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:08.160]  the power of colloidal silver that we now have in the spray bottle, super blue silver
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:13.720]  immune gargle spray, which is also 20% off. So great products, those are just two examples
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:20.000]  at infowarstore.com and then your support, of course, goes right back in to everything
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.840]  we do here, expanding here, hiring more crew, more writers, more reporters, getting more
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:29.880]  live broadcast going, that's what we're doing at infowarstore.com. So your support at infowarstore.com
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:39.120]  is key to all of that. All right, now let's bring in Dr. Corsi again and I want to get
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:46.720]  into the Wasserman Schultz story here. So first of all, you've got Dr. Corsi, the developing
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:52.560]  Imran Awan investigation that's for the most part gone uncovered, unmentioned. He's hiding
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:59.720]  money, they're laundering money, he's getting paid millions by Democrats. His credentials
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:03.840]  don't really meet the requirements for the IT work that they were hiring for millions
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:08.720]  of dollars, the Awan brothers, he tries to escape the country. Now he's hiding money,
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:12.960]  all of this stuff is going on, of course, directly related to Debbie Wasserman Schultz
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:18.000]  who was using the Awan brothers. But then you have, of course, after Wasserman Schultz
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.240]  threatening the police, now she's apparently screaming at house officials to kill the hacking
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:28.480]  probe and she's intervening in the Pakistani criminal matter, that's the Awan investigation.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:33.520]  Now I'll just ask you this, Dr. Corsi, and feel free to take this wherever you want.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:39.200]  Why is Debbie Wasserman Schultz freaking out so much? Is Debbie Wasserman Schultz freaking
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:45.600]  out so much because she knows perhaps maybe even was in on the money laundering by the
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:50.960]  Awan brothers, that's why they were paying them so much money? Or as some are suggesting,
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:57.720]  she might know the secrets behind the Seth Rich unsolved murder. Those are just two
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:03.480]  ideas that are being floated around, but Dr. Corsi, what do you think is making Debbie
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.520]  Wasserman Schultz panic?
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:11.880]  Well, let's look at what these Awan brothers were doing. They were, first of all, running
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:16.400]  along the computer systems for many of the members of Congress, Democratic members of
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:23.720]  Congress, and they had access to their classified and security information. Now I have no doubt
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:28.800]  that this was an intelligence operation for the Awan brothers, and they're getting this
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:35.480]  information, my guess is, over to radical Islamic terrorist groups in the Middle East,
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:42.000]  probably in Pakistan. And here, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who authorized these guys to be involved
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:48.840]  and supported them, is also, and consequently, guilty of violating national security requirements
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:55.240]  for handling classified material. So the whole thing can come down as a major spy scheme
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:01.480]  that Debbie Wasserman Schultz allowed to be put in place and championed even to this day.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:08.040]  I think what she's scared of is facing charges that may put her in prison for spying espionage
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:13.040]  and the misuse of classified information through the Awan brothers that could put her in prison
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.040]  for the rest of her life.
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:18.520]  So what does that make Debbie Wasserman Schultz? Is she then a spy for Pakistan? I mean, what
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:23.920]  advantage does she have bringing in these Pakistanis to essentially what appears to
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.520]  be stealing information?
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:30.560]  Well, you're going to find that this was an entire operation in the Obama administration
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:37.120]  that's tilt toward radical Islam. Even John Brennan, whom I'm convinced was a Muslim,
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:41.480]  was not allowing you to say radical Islamic terrorism. If anything to do with Islam, it
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:46.400]  couldn't be terrorist, so the terrorist had to be not Islam. That's a principle of, that's
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.720]  one of the five pillars of Islam, never say anything bad about Islam. And you had Huma
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:57.840]  Abedin, who was an operative working with Hillary, putting all the State Department classified
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:03.960]  emails on her Yahoo account. All she had to do is give her Yahoo password and username
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:06.800]  to anybody in the Middle East. They could read everything from the State Department.
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:14.760]  She was downloading. So between the Awan brothers and then Huma Abedin, our enemies, the Muslim
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:18.400]  terrorists in the Middle East, could have been reading all the classified information
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.440]  that was going through Congress and the State Department. It's pretty shocking, but I think
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:27.280]  that's really what's at the bottom of this. They're both Hillary and Wasserman Schultz
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:32.280]  are worried about going to prison for the rest of their life for espionage.
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:39.040]  But Abedin, I say, yeah, okay, she directly wouldn't surprise me if she was a spy, a foreign
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:44.880]  spy. You know, is Hillary so stupid she didn't realize it? I doubt it. But that I would understand.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:50.440]  I would understand Abedin's role as a spy, but I'm still confused at what Wasserman Schultz
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:56.240]  is thinking. Or is she really just a total moron? I mean, that to me is the two things
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:59.880]  here. Of course, he like, is she a spy too? Or like, what is what is she thinking? Or
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:00.880]  is she just that stupid?
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:06.400]  No, she's not stupid at all. There's two things involved. One is the culture of the Obama
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:12.160]  administration was to do everything under the table they could to tilt to the Muslim brotherhood,
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:17.000]  including in Egypt, supporting the Muslim brotherhood, taking over Mubarak, and then
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.600]  cutting off the aid when LCC took over. So there's a culture here to get intelligence
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:27.200]  information to help the Muslim brotherhood. And Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Hillary think
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:31.520]  they're doing their appointed task under the table. And secondly, they're getting very
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:37.640]  well paid for it. I'm sure the money laundering was being shared in some form with Wasserman
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:41.320]  Schultz. I doubt she now that now I think we're getting into something here because
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:46.160]  why were they paying the Iwan so much money? Ridiculous amounts, millions and millions
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:49.520]  that they were then laundering unless they were taking a little bit of that money for
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.320]  themselves. We're going to have more of this with Dr. Corsi on the other side. Don't go
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:57.320]  anywhere.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:00.880]  It's a very confusing time in the financial markets and nobody knows that better than

[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:18.400]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK. CNN and many others
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:23.480]  are calling for info wars to be shut down, taken off the web. Slate magazine has a professor

[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:49.680]  of America to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused

[01:32:53.120 --> 01:33:01.360]  world. Now it's time to change our bodies with a z shield and forwards live.com. You're
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:16.720]  listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:33.640]  You know, I saw a story on the drudge report today that said 70% of Americans polled are
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:41.640]  burnout on news and that most of them actually were conservative or Republican leaning. I
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:48.440]  can relate to that. But I think about it a little deeper and I think I realize what
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:59.520]  the frustration here is Dr. Corsi. You know, we know what happened with the Obama administration
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:04.840]  spying on Trump. We know what happened with Hillary Clinton rigging the primaries against
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:10.840]  Bernie Sanders. We know what happened with the illegal emails, the illegal servers. Wasserman
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:15.560]  Schultz involvement in that and then Comey writing Clinton off for all the illegal behavior.
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:21.280]  We know about Huma Abedin having the classified information on an illegal server and it's
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:26.800]  like here we are. We know all this. We know about Mueller. Now more people are even calling
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:33.520]  Mueller out for the botched 9 11 investigation where his running of the FBI could be to blame
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:41.120]  for that. But we sit here, Dr. Corsi. Seemingly banging our heads against the wall with the
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:47.400]  same facts and the same information, hoping that the walls of deceit, that the walls of
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:55.120]  misjustice, that the walls of treason get broken down. And yet we're barely even seeing
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:00.160]  cracks yet. We're still waiting for the IG report to come out. But really doesn't this
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:04.920]  all come down to President Trump, Dr. Corsi? Doesn't this all come down to when the president
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:09.400]  decides that he's going to be the president and stop this madness?
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:15.320]  Well, I think I want you to see what I see. And that is that President Trump has already
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:22.000]  started to end Mueller. That's why I say he's basically called Mueller's bluff. Impeach
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:28.120]  me or let's go to the Supreme Court and debate whether you can subpoena me to testify. As
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:34.000]  I'm not testifying and you can impeach me. And Trump is going to win on both of those.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.400]  Now what I see next is very frustrating because people are saying, you know, there's double
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:44.480]  standard of justice. The Clintons are never going to face any justice. It's going to be
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:47.720]  we're going to know all these crimes were committed and they're going to get swept under
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:53.480]  the rug. I when I wrote killing of the state, I said there were three phases. If you read
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:59.400]  it, encourage people really to read it. The second phase is the Trump counter attack.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:03.880]  And for the next two or three years, what we're going to see, I believe is Donald Trump
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:08.640]  systematically, I think it'll take a new special prosecutor. So I don't think you can have
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:13.400]  the Justice Department investigate itself, but I think you're going to see Donald Trump
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:21.120]  systematically bring these deep state criminals to justice. And I say phase three ends close
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:26.120]  to the end of the first term with military tribunals and Donald Trump bringing up issues
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:33.160]  of treason with the defendants being as high as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Now
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:39.320]  I've known Donald Trump a long time and I can see him confidently playing this game out.
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:44.400]  So what I'm looking at is that right now we feel frustrated, but over the next couple
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:49.880]  of years with what I think is coming, we're going to feel that justice is finally being
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:55.720]  restored to the United States and the support that Donald Trump has will double or triple.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:37:00.240]  I mean, Donald Trump is going to be, I think, regarded as one of the most successful presidents
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:05.520]  in American history. And he's well on his way to doing that after the first 500 days.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:12.400]  Just be patient because watch and see. Look at the signs. We are right now in the end
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:19.320]  game of the first phase of this chess match, which is the attempt to impeach Donald Trump
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:24.800]  and it's failed. Now Donald Trump is going to systematically shut down Mueller's operation
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:31.040]  and I see it coming. I see those, the pieces coming into place to make that happen.
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:37.520]  So you really think that he has got this all planned out to be done in his first four years?
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:42.560]  I think a lot of it's, I think it, yes, I do. I think that the first four years are
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.320]  going to have to be devoted to cleaning up the deep state. I mean, there's significant
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:52.680]  accomplishments. Donald Trump's going to try to make the tax cuts permanent for individuals.
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:56.640]  He's going to make sure we get a deal with North Korea and Iran.
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:01.360]  Well, here's my thing. Here's my thing, though, just to just to cut you off before you get
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:09.080]  going down that road is that that stuff he reassures and cements for at least four more
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:13.600]  years after winning again in 2020, which I fully expect him to win again in 2020. I don't
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:18.680]  think it'll even be much of a race. So I feel like that kind of stuff he can continue to
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:23.320]  go down with in 2020 as far as his legacy is concerned. And then who knows what happens
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:27.360]  in 2024. The political landscape is going to be so different than I'm not even going
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:31.360]  to try to predict what could be happening or what will happen.
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:37.560]  But my concern is that even though I expected to win in 2020, if he doesn't get it done
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:42.840]  in four years, he understands that he has no guarantee of another four years. So he has
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:49.480]  to get it done in four years. He has to put Obama testifying on Spygate under oath within
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:53.920]  his first four years because there's no guarantee he has another four.
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:59.240]  Well, I think the first four years are going to be devoted to the counterattack. And then
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:04.760]  the end game of the counterattack, which is the military tribunals and treason charges,
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:11.240]  the bureaucracy will have to be massively cleaned up. And you're firing, I'd fire 95
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:15.320]  percent of the people. Maybe that's not even enough. I closed down different purals.
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:20.200]  Oh, I shut down the CIA. I shut down the CIA and the FBI immediately.
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:24.640]  Well, I have to have term limits on serving in the bureaucracy as well as term limits
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:29.600]  in serving in Congress. But I want to prefigure what I see the next term for Donald Trump
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:36.200]  can be after 2020. What I see is he's going to tackle then even bigger questions like
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:42.400]  getting rid of the Federal Reserve, getting rid of the U.S. debt, handling the entitlement
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:48.640]  problems that we have of out of control entitlement spending, which is taking 60, 70 percent of
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:55.520]  our budget these days and is no control on the site in the future. Those are the problems
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:59.240]  Donald Trump, I think we'll have to tackle in the second administration. And I really
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:03.360]  see it. I mean, I want everybody to kind of understand that, you know, we should be
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:09.600]  hopeful right now because having survived the attempt to impeach Donald Trump. And right
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:15.320]  now Mueller is costing the Democrats votes in the midterms because the Democrats are
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:18.600]  screwed. Yeah, no, the Democrats are in big trouble.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:24.520]  They have only a negative hate Trump policy. You can't win elections on a negative platform.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:30.360]  That or me, too, are Bernie's standards. And I thought that was both backfired on them
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:35.000]  for the total frauds that they are. But I want to just ask you one more question, actually,
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.880]  because I forgot to bring this up. Have you have you seen Michael Hayden's new book by
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:43.360]  any chance? I've not seen it yet. No, I knew I know it's out. There's several of them.
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:47.560]  I have not caught up on that's one of them. I'd like to talk to you about that because
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:52.360]  it's interesting. Now, I'd rather I'd rather wait for you to actually get some intel on
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:56.240]  it before we talk about it. But I'll just give you kind of the groundwork with my understanding.
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:59.560]  I didn't read all of it, but I've read excerpts. I've read reviews of it and other people that
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:04.400]  read it and covering it. I was surprised. Apparently, Michael Hayden writes this book
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:08.960]  and essentially blames Trump for the collapse of the intelligence agency. And it's kind
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:13.240]  of an anti-Trump book. But we were all of this belief and it was understanding that
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:19.240]  it was Michael Hayden that went to Trump. Originally, when he found out about the spying
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:25.400]  to tell Trump about that so that he could respond, you know, in whatever manner he deemed.
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:29.600]  So this book being anti-Trump was kind of a shock to me. I know that you weren't aware
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:35.120]  of this, but, I mean, wasn't it your understanding that it was Hayden that was a?
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:40.160]  Well, what I'm aware of is that this is part of what Brennan is doing. The intelligence
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:45.320]  agencies have caught on that Donald Trump is going to massively reduce the intelligence
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:51.840]  agencies. All of the spying that's being done on the U.S. citizens, including with the
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:57.800]  Facebook and all the other social media spying on us and then censoring conservatives and
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:02.240]  libertarians. Donald Trump's going to pull all this in. Facebook and the others will
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.720]  be regulated through the Federal Trade Commission. And we're going to have the National Security
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:11.640]  Agency and others. I think even Julian Assange will be allowed to come back to the country
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:17.760]  once Donald Trump focuses on the issue without indictment. And we're going to begin to understand
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:22.440]  that everything we've been doing has been recorded by the NSA, all of our emails, all
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:27.480]  of our phone calls, every click we make on the Internet, comfortably taken up by Google
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:32.880]  and the others, that the Internet itself was created by the CIA and the real Internet's
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:36.640]  controlled by the Godfathers, the Larry Ellison's, the...
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:40.760]  Which Obama even admitted in a slip of the tongue. I don't even think he realized he's
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:46.840]  that he admitted that. Dr. Corsi, thank you so much at Jerome Corsi on Twitter. Again,
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:50.800]  Michael Hayden's book to me just proves to you again it's The Deep State, which Jerry
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.240]  has the book Killing the Deep State, Hayden, another member of The Deep State that hates
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:57.120]  Trump. We'll be right back.

[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:43.160]  95 percent of the actin ingredients. Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:49.520]  as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:36.680]  Next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter. And not only were the heavy
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:42.760]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:48.400]  it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:53.920]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain water supply. But more
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:46:00.160]  importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it. As the years go by, it gets
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:05.560]  harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs. With changes in diet, unnatural
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:10.000]  ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino

[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:33.120]  Okay, I am going to open up the phone line in the third hour, the phone lines, excuse
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:41.360]  me, for the third hour. But specifically, I want to talk to the audience about one thing.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:47.840]  What do we do with the knowledge we have about the smartphones, the screen time, what it
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:56.480]  does to our psychology, our biology, our reproductive systems, our DNA even, with the radio waves
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:09.480]  blasting back and forth. What do we do moving forward? How do we implement a plan to curtail
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:17.080]  the reliance we have on new technology? Or do we? Or do we just accept our fate and keep
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:24.880]  diving deeper and deeper until we can't even come up back to the surface? So, I want dedicated
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:30.520]  phone calls just to that topic in the third hour. What do we do about the smartphone technology
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:37.120]  as they're about to roll out the AI, which has already been rolled out in kind of a soft
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:43.080]  rollout that they're now kind of just introducing to you as, oh, it's here, accept it. You're
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:49.480]  seeing all the new commercials, the Google AI, the Microsoft AI, the AI and the smartphones.
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:57.560]  It's all there. And then you're starting to see some of the AI work or learn where if
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:06.160]  you search Google, it says that the Republicans are Nazis or that a Republican senator is
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:12.600]  a bigot. Well, that's not true and it's not natural. That's the Google AI that is learning
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:18.760]  this because of the stuff that goes up online and that it sees. So, it can't really, the
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:26.800]  AI being is how its AI doesn't really know what fake news is and what fake news isn't.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:34.480]  So it kind of just absorbs everything as is and then cranks it back out as an algorithm
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:40.000]  based on the measurements of the data and learns that, oh, yeah, Republicans must be
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:45.680]  Nazis. It's said everywhere, so that's the case. Oh, yeah, a Senator, a Republican Senator,
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:50.720]  obviously a bigot. It's all over social media. It's all in the news. Must be true. Of course,
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:50:02.080]  it's fake news. But this is all rolling out. But it gets even worse now because Apple is
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:08.880]  admitting more time on our smartphone is bad. So we're going to roll out, oh, and then they
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:14.920]  have the app. I almost want to play the video again where they're like, yeah, yeah, oh,
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:20.400]  thank God, this crew, this crew is so great. Apple is facing criticism about our increasingly,
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:24.320]  you know, pause it right there. I'm going to read this and then play the audio because
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:27.360]  this is so funny because this is what we're going to discuss in the next segment and then
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:31.040]  have the ESPN app video after this too because I want to talk about this in the entire third
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:37.280]  hour because I'm serious. I mean, we all suffer from this. I'm not acting above this, folks.
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:40.960]  I have my smartphone right next to my bed, usually check it right before I go to bed
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:45.440]  right when I wake up, see if I have anything work related I need to address. I'm right
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:50.000]  there with you. Even though you don't really find me on social media, which I am proud of,
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.480]  I'm glad I don't have the Instagrams, the Facebooks, the Twitter's and all that. So glad,
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:51:00.160]  so much better. I'm still scouring for news on the internet, on Drudge, even on Twitter
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:06.000]  all day long. So I'm not trying to act like I'm above it. I'm in there with you. We're
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:11.200]  in this together. But let's go to the Apple video, guys, here. Part of back up. Let me read this.
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:17.040]  Apple is facing criticism about our increasingly unhealthy dependence on iPhones. Well, it's not
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:21.920]  really Apple's fault per se. I guess if they're rigging the screens to flicker at that rate,
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:26.320]  perhaps, but I mean, you still choose to pick it up. And it's a cool technology.
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:30.960]  The company responded Monday with iOS features to help us monitor and limit our storage. Now,
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:36.000]  I'm about to tell you the irony of this, but let's pick up the video with audio right from there.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  Screen time empowers you with both insight and control over how you spend your time.
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:47.760]  And here it is, Apple facing the criticism. We have a dependence on iPhones. It's bad for our
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:55.120]  health. We have a new app to help you monitor your usage. And it starts with reports. Every week,
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:03.760]  you get a weekly activity summary that details how you used your iPhone or iPad. You tap in.
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:07.200]  And they all cheer. Okay, so you get it. So pause right there. So that's fine. So they give you
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:11.360]  this bar graph and it shows you how you use your time the whole week. Yada, yada, yada. Whoo. Thank
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:19.840]  you, Apple. Apple, Google, all of them, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, they have been doing that to
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:28.720]  you since you signed up. But now they realize the damage or you realize the damage the smartphones
[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:33.280]  and all the tech is doing to you. And so they're trying to virtue signal like, okay, we care.
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:39.280]  Let's let's show them what we've been doing to them. But let's act like we're doing it for them
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:44.640]  so that they can be healthier. Yeah, that'll work. And so then they say, here's the app,
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:50.240]  monitor your behavior, monitor your phone usage. We've been monitoring it for decades. Now it's
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:59.280]  your turn. Oh, man. So what do we do? I open up the phone lines for the entire third hour.
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:12.080]  1-877-789-ALIX. 1-877-789-2539. 1-877-789-ALIX. Yeah, and you are actually seeing this
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:20.560]  in sales where sales of smartphones have actually already peaked and are now kind of trending downward.
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:28.240]  But we know about the negative side effects of cell phones. We know about the negative side
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:34.800]  effects of the screen time. Now we're learning about the negative side effects of the 4G and what
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:40.640]  soon to be the 5G radio waves that are going to just destroy our environment when it hits 6G
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:49.360]  will be dead. So but they don't see but Apple doesn't point that out. Say we're actually
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:54.720]  going to reconsider and look into the 5G here before we roll it out because there might be
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:54:00.880]  some serious negative health repercussions here. So we're going to dial that back and the 4G is
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:06.720]  already kind of blistering you up inside with the radio waves. But we'll just just hold on a
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:11.360]  familiar. Let's look at this 5G for a second here. Let's see if we can really afford to roll this 5G
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:19.680]  up. Of course, they don't care. They don't care if the human domain dies. They're going to become
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:25.360]  machines and live forever. That's their plan. So yeah, create the 5G, the 6G, boils the environment,
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:30.080]  makes it impossible for humans to live unless they upload their brain to a computer chip.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:40.480]  So again, I open up the phone lines 1-877-789 Alex. What do we do about this? How do we beat
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:47.360]  the addiction to smartphones now with the dependence and the reliance we have on them
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:52.400]  for day-to-day activities, for work, for communication, what have you? But the craziest
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:55:00.320]  thing when you think about this is it wasn't long ago when smartphones didn't even exist. I mean,
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:06.960]  all you got to do is flash back, what, a decade, 15 years? You didn't even have a smartphone.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:14.960]  Shoot, 15 years ago, if you had a camera attached to your phone, that was groundbreaking.
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:23.120]  But we've come so far in such a short period of time where now the dependence is habitual.
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:27.040]  Yeah, and then ESPN has the ad, we don't need to roll it again, where
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:31.200]  they're promoting their new app and it's like, here's a guy at a party with friends,
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:35.600]  what is he doing? He's staring at a smartphone. Here's a guy walking on a beautiful beach,
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:39.440]  beautiful weather, beautiful day. What is he doing? He's watching his smartphone.
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:45.840]  Here's a guy surfing. He's got a surfboard, he's at the beach, but he's watching his smartphone.
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:51.520]  Here's a guy at breakfast, nice little breakfast diner outside. What's he doing? Watching his
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:58.400]  smartphone. So then, oh, yeah. Well, what's the point? I might as well become a machine.
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:03.920]  I don't live in the real world as it is. I'm already living in my smartphone. So who needs the real
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:11.520]  world? So what do we do about this, folks? Again, I'm not asking to hear what you think. I mean,
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:16.320]  I'm like, what do we do? I'm in this with you. Yeah, there's pictures, the crews showing of the
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:20.800]  kids, children. Basically, you know, it used to be the television raised the kids. Now it's the
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:26.720]  smartphone. We played the intro coming into a segment this hour where people just looking at
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:32.160]  their smartphones, walk into pools, walk into holes, walk into each other, walk into traffic,
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:40.800]  get in car accidents. And you see where it goes. You see where this ends.
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:49.200]  So what do we do? How do we be proactive? Do we even want to stop this? So that's what I open up
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:53.120]  the phone lines with and we'll do that for the entire third hour. But folks, please support us

[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:53.200]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is
[01:58:53.200 --> 01:59:00.320]  sending down over the UK. They're set to pass rules not a law that if you criticize Islam or
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:05.840]  gays, you'll get six months in prison. We know we're only about a year or two behind what's
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:10.480]  happening in the UK. CNN and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down,
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:16.800]  taken off the web. Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:22.480]  young people against info wars, psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually
[01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:27.200]  hear what we have to say. We are the most hated news source in the world by globalist.
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:33.040]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com or slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:39.040]  so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:44.880]  to engage in free open dialogue as a society that is critical to this fight. We will prevail if you
[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:54.240]  take action and I know you will. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:54.240 --> 02:00:19.680]  Okay, I am getting a bunch of callers right now lined up by the crew. The topic we're gonna be
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:26.560]  discussing here in the third hour. What do we do about the smartphone technology that's now taking
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:33.280]  over our life? And it's not just that it's taking over our life. It's that we know of all the negative
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:38.560]  health effects. We know about the negative effects of the 5G. We know about the negative side effects
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:50.080]  physically and psychologically of all of the screen time of the flicker rates. So what do we
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:54.880]  do about it? What are we doing about it? What do we do about it? Can we do anything about it?
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:03.440]  A brief discussion in the break with the crew. I mean, honestly, I don't know. I don't have
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:08.320]  an answer. I'm right in this with you. I might not be the worst, but I'm certainly not the best.
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:12.480]  I still use my smartphone. I have two smartphones.
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:25.760]  So what do we do? I mean, how do we buck this? How do we change this tide? How do we slow this
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:32.560]  momentum or renavigate this momentum? And you know where it ends. There's a great illustration
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:37.440]  right there. You're trapped in your smartphone. It becomes your prison. And you know where it ends,
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:43.840]  folks. Eventually, you literally plug in to the machine and become the machine,
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:51.360]  which then enters an entire new realm of debate, which is, do you want to die?
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:54.640]  Or do you want to live forever as a machine?
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:02:05.200]  Yeah. I love that image that we have in that intro, where you have a group of girls at a
[02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:10.000]  baseball game, and there's like 12 of them, and not one of them is watching the game. They're all
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:18.320]  in their smartphone. Yeah. Smartphone, selfie, duck face, looking down, texting a friend.
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:27.280]  You know, that girl has a St. Louis Cardinal hat on taking the duck face selfie, but that is not
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:32.640]  from St. Louis. So I just want to stand up for my city. That is not Bush Stadium.
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:41.840]  Anyway, I mean, you see it, if you go to a ball game, whenever I can, I like to enjoy live sports.
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:49.280]  If I go to a Cardinal game in St. Louis at Bush Stadium, you just look around and half the crowd
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:57.200]  is staring at their smartphone. And I grew up going to ball games. I mean, I'm like 14 years old,
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:04.000]  and my dad is dropping me off with five bucks so I can go get a bleacher seat. And I would go
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:11.200]  with five bucks, get a bleacher seat, maybe take some peanuts with me. And that was it.
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:16.080]  And for three hours, I enjoyed it. I loved watching the game. I didn't need a smartphone.
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:21.360]  I don't even like these new stadiums. They got 500 screens, 500 graphics flashing around you all
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:26.800]  the time, games going on. I'm like, man, what happened to people wanting to go watch the game?
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:31.680]  What happened to people wanting to watch other humans be masters at their craft?
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:36.240]  Do incredible things. Now you just sit on your smartphone and watch, oh, did something happen?
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:43.840]  Woo. But so what do we do? What do we do? Yeah, there is the image right there.
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:54.000]  That's actually in Arlington ballpark in Texas. That is the Texas Rangers ballpark that these
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:04.080]  girls, are you intentionally zooming in on the St. Louis hat? Isn't that so trendy? I'm eating,
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:11.440]  what is that, like a churro taking a duck face selfie? Oh, and now you know what they have to do?
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:19.280]  Now they have to put up a screen. Now in Major League Baseball, they have to put up a screen
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:27.920]  like all around the foul territory because people keep getting hit with baseballs because
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:34.800]  they're not even watching the game. So people staring down at their smartphone, yeah, there's
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:39.200]  one, this guy gets hit in the face with a basketball because he's not even watching,
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:45.440]  they're both staring in a smartphone. So now you have to make a fan safe environment because
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:50.640]  they're not even paying attention to the game so they can be totally droned out on their smartphone,
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:53.680]  not even watching the game and then they don't get hit in the head with a ball,
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:59.440]  they have to go to the game with a helmet on. Fueling your body is hard work. That's why we've

[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:28.080]  Next hour until Paul Joseph Watson takes over the fourth hour here at the Alex Jones Show,
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:35.920]  I'm taking your call specifically on what do we do about the smartphone, cell phone technology
[02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:41.360]  soon to be the 5G that is literally killing us. It's literally destroying us and you know where
[02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:47.520]  the end game goes. We literally have to become machines just to survive or we're so dependent
[02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:53.360]  on machines we have to plug into the digital machine or get a brain chip or whatever it is
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:58.080]  and that's where it's going. You know I'm going to tell you something right here about this story.
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:04.320]  AI brain chips will create a new breed of superhumans who can communicate via telepathy.
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:09.680]  You want to know something? You can already communicate via telepathy folks. You already
[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:16.400]  have that innate ability built in you. Now you know that we only use on average I think about
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:25.440]  10% of our brains but I bet you've experienced probably some form of telepathy in your life
[02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:31.840]  and you can do it. You can manipulate it. It's part of the secret human history that they don't tell
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:41.840]  you. I mean we don't even know the secrets of our pineal gland. So we have all these amazing
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:50.800]  abilities already as humans that we don't even try to tap into. It's just incredible. So that's
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:54.960]  what we're going to be talking about here for the rest of the hour. What do we do about the
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:08:02.800]  technology killing us, the 5G? How do we stop it? How do we stop the momentum of our dependence on it?
[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:08.080]  Let's go out to the phone lines now. Let's start with Jim in California. Go ahead Jim.
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:18.320]  How are you doing? Just fine. All right. I've tried some things that have helped me a lot.
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:23.120]  In fact, I'm not my sleep better is number one, shut everything off at night including the Wi-Fi
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:29.760]  in your house. I bought a pocket pocket from you and I keep my phone in it and yeah it takes
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:35.520]  a minute when I pull it out go back and hook back up to the net so that it works but that
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:43.840]  minute that little bit of time is worth some of my life. You can get a reasonable meter that will
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:54.800]  measure electromagnetic frequency and there's a simple demonstration they showed on YouTube on
[02:08:54.800 --> 02:09:01.840]  putting a ferriday cage over your smart meter. You know this is actually Jim. This is actually
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:06.960]  incredible Jim. There's a guy that works here but we're gonna hear for I think a decade here
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:13.600]  of one of our social media gurus, a friend of mine who he told me about this and he showed me.
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:18.800]  He was like yeah we're getting blasted with all these frequencies and I was like what are you
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:24.320]  talking about? And he pulls out the meter and he just goes around his apartment and he's like oh
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:29.120]  here's my computer blasting it off. Oh here's my wireless router blasting it off. Here's my
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:36.000]  microwave blasting it off. All of these waves are invisible or excuse me invisible if you could see
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.200]  all the radio waves that are going through we wouldn't we wouldn't even be able to see an
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:45.280]  inch in front of our face but I've never heard I like that turning off the wi-fi you know unplugging
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:49.760]  it and all that stuff but I don't know I don't know if that really helps the overall issue that
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:55.440]  might kind of be like one thing to say for each individual to help you with your health and to
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:59.520]  stop the waves from hitting you all the time but I don't know if it really stops the momentum of
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:05.920]  where we're going here Jim. Well I agree with you but the one thing that you need and like
[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:13.840]  you and Alex both need it, sleep. Find a way to make your bedroom peaceful. My next step here I found
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:19.280]  that stainless steel mesh is cheaper than copper and I can hang that on the walls uh you know
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:25.600]  heighted underneath the paneling on the walls of my bedroom and now it doesn't infiltrate my bedroom
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.960]  but it doesn't look like a Faraday cage either and just leave those devices out of the room
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:36.720]  and make sure at least you shut yourself off at night and let your brain rest so it's not getting
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:41.120]  fried constantly because just walking around in the world you're gonna get it unless you're wearing
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:47.360]  a foil hat or something you know hey that's it how about we gotta bring back the foil hats
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:50.560]  we're gonna start selling foil hats at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:57.120]  You guys come up with a hat that is made with the same mesh as the blocket pocket so you can put
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:02.480]  it on your head. Do you remember the audience probably doesn't remember this there is this
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:07.040]  there is this girl it was a Donald Sterling thing Vivian Steviano I think was her name
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:15.600]  she used to wear she used to walk around in a uh um what do the um the steel melders wear like the
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:26.160]  steel melder hat I'm joking like but but here's the thing that is going to be an industry
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:35.920]  mark my words that is going to be an industry with like helmets and and body suits or or even homes
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:42.880]  where it's all an infarity enclosure or or bedrooms or they'll they'll make paints that's
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:50.480]  going to be a market where they create an entire marketplace for you to fight back against all
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:55.200]  the radio waves that are destroying you and Jim is completely right thank you for the call Jim
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:01.680]  and again I know he's right and it's like I can't even do it and I don't know if you've been able
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:07.440]  to notice oh look at that radiation blocking boxers I want to get some of these we should probably
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:12.720]  sell them I'm not even kidding you walk around with your cell phone right next to your testicles
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:19.760]  excuse me it's blasting them with waves destroying your ability to procreate sorry I'd like to have
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:24.400]  kids so so I mean I need to get these boxes apparently we should probably sell them but
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:35.280]  that's going to be a huge marketplace that's not even a joke I just again though I don't I
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:41.600]  guess it's just impossible to stop but the caller Jim was right you really should be turning this
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:47.280]  stuff down yeah there's a story this is even the Huffington Post how your cell phone might be hurting
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:55.920]  your sperm no it's not a mite it is it is it's also hurting female eggs it's all old news and
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:05.840]  they just keep rolling it out we don't even do anything see this is why yesterday I was so
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:12.320]  irked of the supreme court case being such a huge story a freaking gay wedding cake bro
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:19.520]  oh which at all oh and then they do the research it turns out that the two gay guys doing this
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:27.040]  were militant left-wing radicals they specifically looked for the one baker that they knew would
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:32.560]  say no and then they made a national case out of it and then they lost big seven to two mainstream
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:39.520]  media says narrow decision it was a total blowout and that's the big story meanwhile cell phone
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:47.120]  technology is killing us all so how do we stop it Jim has a solution I think in the short term
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:52.800]  not sure how it works in the long term let's jump out to Josh calling in from organ go ahead Josh
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:01.360]  oh um so I wanted to make the comparison between cell phone and uh and cigarettes because I think
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:06.400]  it's uh there's a lot of comparisons there I mean for one thing they're obviously clearly addictive
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:10.960]  but and obviously there's also bogus science that was behind both of them you know when you
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:16.240]  look at cigarettes for a period of time there was dentist and doctors coming out and recommending
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:24.000]  certain brands even um and so you've got this thing where society's addicted to it they think that
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  you're a kook or some kind of nut if you say that it's actually bad for you and the problem here is
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:34.400]  not only do you have industries that can profit off of this but you've got you know different
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:41.760]  entities that can clearly control society uh on so many different levels um as far as as you
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:48.160]  know what we can do to change it that's a tough one because uh people are I would say more addicted
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:52.800]  to their smartphones than they are our two cigarettes well and and this is actually this is
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:59.040]  actually a great caller let's hold Josh to hold Josh because I like the intellectual analogy you
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:02.640]  just made to cigarettes I want to have that I actually want to continue that conversation on
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:08.080]  the other side because that is actually we can actually kind of paint a lot of parallels with
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:11.520]  that and the smartphones but let's do that on the other side uh in the meantime we're about to go
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:14.880]  to break I'm taking your calls the rest of this hour before Paul Joseph Watson takes over but please

[02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:43.760]  host owin treuer we're taking your calls here on the alex jones show discussing the implications
[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:49.760]  of cell phone technology all the screen time what it does to the youth what it does to us
[02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:56.960]  what it does to our humanity no supreme court case no that's a gay cake but the cell phones that you
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:04.960]  know could pretty much destroy our environment via the recent studies we just ignore that so we're
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:12.320]  taking your call specifically on that issue at 1-877-789 alex now i held josh over because he was
[02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:16.400]  making a good point he kind of got cut short on the break so i wanted to bring it back back to
[02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:21.280]  josh josh get back to the point you were making compares uh comparing in the past to other things
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:25.520]  where you kind of had a similar situation where maybe we knew about the negative health effects
[02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:31.280]  maybe we didn't uh maybe they're consistent maybe they're inconsistent maybe we still don't know
[02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:35.680]  and you were using the comparison of cigarettes to that so just get back on your point start from
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:41.840]  wherever you want josh and organ sure things your thing um so the reason i think it's it's actually
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:46.080]  way more dangerous though is because with with cigarettes you had an you know obvious a profit
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:50.800]  motivation and you've got uh these industries you know that are going to pay a lot of money for lobby
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:54.640]  to have scientists and others say like well this is good for you because they want to make a profit
[02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:59.840]  but cell phones not only is extremely addictive but you've got these weird social scientists who
[02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:04.800]  are now getting in there and they can uh they can manipulate people they can uh cause us to uh become
[02:22:04.800 --> 02:22:10.320]  infertile they can help to uh to guide our you know the the way that we think and that makes it
[02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:14.400]  exponentially more dangerous because you've also got the profit motivations all these people who are
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:19.200]  glad to be a part of it for that for that reason but then you've also got the the social control
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:24.800]  aspect of it which just makes it so incredibly dangerous and it's become a part of almost everyone's
[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:30.400]  life i mean we're completely in vela by you know the technology that is around us now and that's
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:34.320]  where i wanted to so let's let's keep it right there for a second with this comparison in the
[02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:38.560]  cigarettes to smartphones and kind of the same deal as far as the health concerns behind it yet
[02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:46.080]  the rollout anyway uh i agree with you cigarettes probably not near as big of an issue as the smartphone
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:51.760]  phones because i agree i think more people are using smartphones where you didn't have children
[02:22:51.760 --> 02:22:57.360]  you know growing up by the age of three smoking cigarettes you do have children by the age of
[02:22:57.360 --> 02:23:02.640]  three on the smartphones on the tablets using that technology so i do agree that that's more of a
[02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:08.160]  threat you've also got just the fact that you know you still choose whether or not you want to
[02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:13.520]  smoke a cigarette cigarette smokers are actually decreasing there's multiple reasons for this
[02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:19.680]  alternatives the vaping and everything but with the smartphones it's like you kind of don't have
[02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:23.920]  a choice in some aspects of life you need the smartphone to work everybody has a cell phone at
[02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:29.200]  least and then you kind of bring it to the second hand issue where it's like okay second hand smoke
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:34.000]  is it bad is it is it is it not bad is there really this negative side effect do we really not know
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:40.640]  know well with the second hand cell phone radiation that's not even an option it's like you can't get
[02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:45.680]  away from the cell phone radiation unless you know you're like 500 miles removed from society
[02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:52.400]  oh absolutely and and the and when you look at the damage that it does to society not only
[02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:57.280]  individuals with society we're more socially disconnected now than we've ever been even though
[02:23:57.280 --> 02:24:02.160]  we're able to connect with people all around the world instantaneously we get so involved in that
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:07.440]  the dopamine hits yeah like there's people there's people uh i used to write i used to ride the bus
[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:12.320]  in st lewis for like five years i took public transportation i remember there'd be some days
[02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:16.480]  where i wouldn't feel like listening to music or you know listening to podcasts or whatever and i
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:21.840]  wouldn't have headphones in and i'd like try to talk to people like either sitting at the bus stop
[02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:26.480]  or on the metro or whatever and there's people out there that are literally like they're shocked
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:31.600]  they're like what is this is he trying to talk to me is this person trying to use words to
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:36.320]  communicate with me uh i don't understand uh so there's like another aspect that you just brought
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:41.920]  up to where it's like we're we're having this communication breakdown where we don't even
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:48.880]  know how to socially interact anymore oh absolutely i mean when you look at the levels of uh uh you
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:53.520]  know even seeing suicide you know it's going up i mean it's just really causing a lot of problems
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:58.880]  for i mean the youth especially um and you know we we know we've been warned by people like Steve
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:04.320]  Jobs heads of facebook but still the conventional wisdom for whatever reason is that you know you're
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:10.080]  a kook if you say this stuff's bad for you well thank you for the call josh great call and and
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:14.720]  just to kind of play both sides of the aisle here and be fair with it just and i don't know if this
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:20.320]  is is actually fair when it comes down to the science but you know let's not recall or let's
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:24.880]  do recall that you've got all the claims about cigarettes and cancer and second hand smoke and
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:33.040]  all that stuff i've got a great aunt that is like pushing 90 years old who's been smoking cigarettes
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:42.960]  since he was 15 years old prior pack a day and you know can still can still you know run like
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:50.960]  she's in college so how do you explain that do you have that same kind of application to the
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:55.920]  cell phones where maybe it affects others more than some i i'm just asking questions i'm trying

[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:17.840]  and i want to see if you can tell me who said this i think it is fair to say at this point
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:23.760]  and we're not trying to compare this to things in the past as far as wars are concerned but
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:29.520]  we're essentially in a civil war right now to this country we are people versus we the people
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:34.160]  versus the brainwash masses and the corrupt washington establishment that hurts them
[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:42.000]  i don't know tell me is that that no go ahead you did oh you just quoted me
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:47.840]  me oh i don't even know what i said and yeah when it comes to quotes when i think something

[02:26:53.920 --> 02:27:02.960]  well that that's strictly up to you but um no i i'm just calling because uh i i have a lot of
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:09.280]  experience talking to and um dealing with people that when you talk about the dangers of cell phones
[02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:14.000]  um i've been trying to build my business to the point where i don't have to do the actual work

[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:26.320]  threats of it but i i know a person that the doctor directly told him that yeah it was your

[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:48.320]  it though as a business you say you're a business owner yeah how hard is it though as a business
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:56.560]  owner to create a business model that can not just exist but even thrive trying to avoid the
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:04.160]  harmful technologies well i mean i i use well you know i use a router as far as my computer but i

[02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:28.880]  all right before we get back to the phone lines with leon and joe and dylan and grant i just
[02:33:28.880 --> 02:33:37.040]  want to do a quick news blitz here california water law prevents showering doing laundry on
[02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:41.680]  same day california governor jerry brown signed two bills that will force water districts and
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:47.440]  municipalities to permanently adopt even more aggressive water rationing level than during
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:55.280]  the state's five-year drought so more government control in california i wonder though if jerry
[02:33:55.280 --> 02:34:05.120]  brown is able to water his plants take a shower make pasta do his laundry do it all on the same
[02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:12.480]  day i wonder if jerry brown has to abide by the same water restrictions as the rest of california
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:22.720]  somehow i doubt it maybe i'm just a cynic did you see this maxine waters plays to empty seats
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:29.600]  as only 10 millennials show up to campaign event anti-maxine guys see if you can find the graphic
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:35.440]  that they made for this the anti-maxine graphic yeah here's the here's the b-roll the crew has it
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:40.880]  there's the uh it's about 10 millennials that show up to this event and then there's maxine waters
[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:48.240]  which i gotta tell you this is actually kind of a powerful footage uh you know i you know i've got
[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:54.480]  a i've got a grandma bless her heart i love her dearly my last grandparent that's still alive
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:59.200]  and you know she's kind of you know she she's short and stature you know usually your your
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:05.360]  grandmother's end up pretty short in statue but when you see maxine who pretends to be this powerful
[02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:12.160]  woman who pretends to be this giant for civil rights standing there like a the smallest person
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:19.040]  the littlest person in the crowd not just physically but mentally when it comes to her integrity when
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:24.080]  it comes to her honesty that's what she's really the littlest in she's really a shrimp when it comes
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:29.840]  to integrity and honesty and then you have the kind of physical manifestation of that in this video
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:38.880]  but but i'm losing my track here 10 people show up to a maxine waters event 10 people with organization
[02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:47.840]  press releases printouts the whole nine please join us for the anti-maxine meet and greet

[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:13.040]  people to show up not to see me not to hear me lecture them but to protest the baby killers of
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:21.280]  planned parenthood bernie sanders at the airport nobody cares low energy looks like a total schlub
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:31.920]  can't even buy a comb for a nickel a total hack a total bum where his his little bodyguard or
[02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:38.960]  whatever this guy is has more energy than he does sanders is just wavering around out there like a
[02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:45.520]  like a uh uh uh what do they call the the the dust things that roll around i can't even think about
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:50.880]  it now and all the western cartoons and everything he's one of those he's like a dust mite a tumble
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:57.200]  tumbleweed bernie sanders is like a tumbleweed tumbling through the airport no energy no one
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:02.800]  cares maxine waters gets 10 people to show up for a highly publicized event folks i'm not
[02:37:02.800 --> 02:37:08.400]  just saying this we are bigger than them do you understand that info wars is bigger than
[02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:15.040]  bernie sanders info wars is bigger than maxine waters these people are losers and they're losing
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:18.160]  i'll move on
[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:31.120]  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten people show up to a maxine waters event
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:31.520]  ten
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:38.160]  nancy polosi on supreme court ruling bake that cake christians
[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:50.400]  nancy polosi woman can't even think straight but she just told you what it was all about
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:58.480]  she just told you what was behind the entire gay cake story it was all about attacking christians
[02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:05.120]  and militant homosexual radicals saying you better bake our cake christians just trying to shove it
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:11.920]  in their face well the supreme court got wise to you and you lost seven to two coke brothers join
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:18.960]  resistance launch campaign against trump tariffs uh you know this is an interesting story but
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:25.760]  i'm a little confused by this because i read a story today that said david coke was actually
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:30.800]  pretty much setting aside all his and his involvement in coke industries citing health reasons
[02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:40.080]  so kind of conflicting stories there so i'm not sure what the deal with that is but to the left
[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:44.160]  who hates the coke brothers you think that they'd be like oh wow the coke brothers hate trump maybe
[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:51.280]  i like trump yeah billionaire conservative donor coke to retire from coke industries so i'm just
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:55.760]  trying to figure this out they claim that he's fighting trump but he's claiming to retire okay
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:39:01.440]  kent state gun girl challenges david hog to an arm wrestling match this is hilarious katlyn bennett
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:07.920]  huge i'm a big fan of katlyn bennett by the way uh she's got a real future and she's not afraid of
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:12.880]  media outlets unlike other activists that are like her that were scared to come on info wars
[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:16.880]  i'll just leave it at that katlyn bennett challenges david hog to an arm wrestling match
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:23.920]  well i think i'd probably take katlyn bennett in that i saw david hog once i said that he uh
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:28.640]  he had a loose a loose thread hanging out of his shirt sleeve i didn't realize it was his arm
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:36.080]  so anyway and then you had uh what what what is this deal family of stoneman douglas student
[02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:43.040]  advocate david hog swatted at home but apparently it was a prank swat thing i don't know again i'm
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:48.000]  just reporting this to you i didn't dive deep into this there's really not many details even in this
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:53.680]  story um so who knows there's probably some angle that'll come from that all right got through that
[02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:59.440]  stack news let's get to another phone call let's go to leon in organ go ahead leon we're talking
[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:05.600]  about the rollout of the 5g technology the smartphone that's killing our humanity and what do we do
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:14.320]  to stop it go ahead leon and good afternoon oh and a good job fight for the cause um well one of
[02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:18.480]  the things oh and if you don't mind i'd like to give a quick shout out to alex from my speak out
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:24.640]  radio it's been a long time um but as far as the 5g you know one of the things and first of all
[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:29.840]  uh don't worry about your use of it because your use of it is as a tool for your work you're not
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:34.800]  like sitting around watching porn and playing games yeah no i understand that there's a big
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:40.400]  difference i do understand that however it still is hurting me i mean i'm still getting negative
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:46.880]  health effects well and you know what honestly they've got us tied so tight into this system that
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:51.200]  to find information i mean you know they're eliminating libraries all over the place that
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:56.240]  used to be a huge source of information oh wait you mean like the obama library that
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:01.520]  doesn't even have any books in it that's now getting protested in chicago oh well and yeah
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:05.440]  pretty much libraries nowadays just have a bunch of computers that are all hooked up to the internet
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:11.360]  anyway but uh you know to find really good information is really difficult thing to do but
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:16.240]  if people do the homework and look at you know company the things that companies put out about
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:21.200]  their technology and this and that and that's that's really my main point here is educate you
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:26.880]  know yourself about these type of technologies and the more that you understand about this stuff the
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:31.760]  more passionate you become because you you understand the the goal of this stuff you know
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:37.440]  dna is manipulated by environmental circumstance and all this stuff that we're putting on us is
[02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:43.120]  literally rearranging our cosmic antenna and you know preventing us from receiving you know like
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:48.880]  creator energy and all that stuff and the thing that i do because i don't have access like you
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:54.240]  guys with a great audience but if you're like standing at a gas pump and you see somebody next
[02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:59.120]  to you strike up a conversation start talking about this stuff because the only way that
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:03.840]  we're going to be able to beat this stuff is by educating yourself becoming passionate

[03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:43.280]  right now the word mother the word father he's being removed in canada you up in here it's a
[03:00:43.280 --> 03:00:51.360]  hateful word it's a hateful evil word and we're teaching the children now in sex education nationwide
[03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:58.000]  how being heterosexual is bad and i i agree with that whole agenda and i think that's a good thing
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:03.280]  now actually again so i'll do the article in the philadelphia newspaper uh just a few days ago
[03:01:03.280 --> 03:01:07.600]  celebrating that i heard alex jones is going to be covering a little bit later but first
[03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:12.160]  i want to explain something to me you little rat you're a little slave
[03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:20.480]  black lives matter is revolutionary standing up against the oppression of the ruling class
[03:01:20.480 --> 03:01:26.800]  and it's just like sanan said that if somebody you know a cop kills somebody questionably in one
[03:01:26.800 --> 03:01:31.600]  part of the country and then officers get shot in another part who are totally innocent well
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:36.720]  they're not innocent and that's not an outrageous message that's officially what we in the communist
[03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:43.680]  i mean socialist party are saying to you right now oh and just get ready for it get ready for it
[03:01:43.680 --> 03:01:48.560]  as soon as we get your guns we're going to have a way with this oh you're going to come for the
[03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:53.280]  guns bernie that's your first plan and then you're going to take we always come for the guns
[03:01:53.280 --> 03:01:58.960]  then offshore banks suck the country dry but bernie didn't hitler come for the guns bernie i mean
[03:01:58.960 --> 03:02:05.120]  didn't didn't hitler come for the the guns and then your your jewish ancestors okay all all
[03:02:05.120 --> 03:02:13.200]  christians all conservatives all nazis that is the official policy of the my king soros and my other
[03:02:13.200 --> 03:02:20.720]  king my good friend the king of the uh child lovers i mean nambler the world chairman of nambler
[03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:26.720]  pope francis you know the king of the uh the king of the pedophiles his deputy pope in jail his other
[03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:32.800]  top pope had caught and indicted he's a good thing here you know i'm sorry i'm getting my
[03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:39.040]  normal gangster accent right now as i was saying why people don't know what it's like to be poor
[03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:44.640]  and uh you're going to find out about that real soon but bernie don't you realize that all of your
[03:02:44.640 --> 03:02:49.280]  hateful rhetoric and your refusal to stand up to hillary clinton stealing the election from you
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:53.440]  don't you realize that that's made you very unpopular and all your supporters have turned
[03:02:53.440 --> 03:03:00.880]  their back on you do you even care socialism works 100 percent of the time so does communism it's great
[03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:08.880]  the problem is it can't work when there's still any uh free mara freedom i mean racism going on
[03:03:08.880 --> 03:03:14.800]  you need to let us the big mega banks run and rule everything and then we will take really good
[03:03:14.800 --> 03:03:21.120]  care of you it's totally normal that the fortune 100 big banks and big tax give almost a hundred
[03:03:21.120 --> 03:03:26.960]  percent democrat money and a good tax exempt they know how to run the slaves i mean the
[03:03:26.960 --> 03:03:32.640]  downtrodden people that we're going to save from america we're going to be just like venezuela
[03:03:33.280 --> 03:03:38.640]  we're going to be just like other barriers and this is all part of the larger plan this is what
[03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:47.600]  we do and jeffrey abstein and my other your good friends over there we all know the best for you
[03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:56.160]  and your children so just let the democratic party take control of your children and let hillary
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:04:01.920]  take control what a beautiful angel she is and everything's gonna be all right oh and oh and
[03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:09.440]  just oh and just let me run things can you look at me oh can you look at me i will run things now
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:20.560]  it's not clear now say to me say to me the cookie monster i am the cookie monster i am bernie sanders
[03:04:20.560 --> 03:04:26.800]  you will die you will give everything to me no i don't think so bernie i think i think that people
[03:04:26.800 --> 03:04:32.720]  like you are going to jail bernie we will break your will no bernie your wife is being investigated
[03:04:32.720 --> 03:04:39.280]  by the fbi right now bernie no no info wars no no no venezuela communism is collapsing bernie
[03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:44.240]  they are not going to contribute they are not going to buy the products i guarantee it or no no
[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:50.880]  if you buy any products they can't even get a comb for a nickel in venezuela bernie you are
[03:04:50.880 --> 03:04:58.080]  expecting you are hopeful i am using magic living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[03:04:58.080 --> 03:05:03.280]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on
[03:05:03.280 --> 03:05:09.280]  rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[03:05:09.280 --> 03:05:15.840]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[03:05:15.840 --> 03:05:22.560]  we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there
[03:05:22.560 --> 03:05:28.720]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[03:05:28.720 --> 03:05:34.560]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:05:34.560 --> 03:05:41.680]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises
[03:05:41.680 --> 03:05:47.840]  the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain
[03:05:47.840 --> 03:05:59.520]  water supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[03:05:59.520 --> 03:06:12.480]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow and now your
[03:06:12.480 --> 03:06:20.640]  host paul joseph watson we are live it is the fourth hour of the alex joneshow on this june
[03:06:20.640 --> 03:06:28.560]  fifth 2018 edition got a host of issues to get into some positive news in fact a lot of positive
[03:06:28.560 --> 03:06:33.760]  news today starting off with one of the top headlines on info wars dot com right now
[03:06:34.960 --> 03:06:40.240]  poll double the amount of americans think young black people doing better under trump
[03:06:40.240 --> 03:06:49.120]  than obama that's right donald trump is proving once again to be a very very bad racist indeed
[03:06:49.120 --> 03:06:54.800]  this is a new poll out of rasmussen and it's found that double double the number of americans think
[03:06:54.800 --> 03:07:00.240]  that young black people are doing better under trump than they did under obama now if you look at
[03:07:00.240 --> 03:07:06.880]  these figures it's pretty interesting because while 36 percent still say that life for young
[03:07:06.880 --> 03:07:12.640]  black people in america is worse 32 percent said that it's got better under under trump compared
[03:07:12.640 --> 03:07:19.840]  to obama now you look at obama's figures compare this to obama's figures from march 2014 where just
[03:07:19.840 --> 03:07:26.480]  16 percent of americans said that life had gotten better for young blacks under obama and by july
[03:07:26.480 --> 03:07:33.920]  2016 this number had slumped to just 13 percent so it was less than half under the obama administration
[03:07:33.920 --> 03:07:38.640]  compared to the trump administration that thought young black people in america were doing well
[03:07:39.440 --> 03:07:44.480]  now people are going to look at these figures and say oh this is just racist bigoted trump
[03:07:44.480 --> 03:07:50.000]  voters saying that life is better for black people how would they know well no that's not the case
[03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:57.600]  because as rasmussen report reports even black voters are nearly twice as likely 28 percent to
[03:07:57.600 --> 03:08:03.520]  say young black americans are better off now than they were in the closing year of obama's presidency
[03:08:03.520 --> 03:08:08.640]  which was 15 percent so no it's not just trump voters who are skewing these polls
[03:08:08.640 --> 03:08:15.840]  almost doubled the number of black voters say the exact same thing that life has gotten better
[03:08:15.840 --> 03:08:22.880]  for young black people in trumps america trump the bigger to racist america compared to obama's
[03:08:22.880 --> 03:08:29.280]  america now it's not really a big surprise is it given the economic numbers given the black
[03:08:29.280 --> 03:08:35.280]  unemployment numbers now of course this is made even more impressive by the fact that as we know
[03:08:35.280 --> 03:08:39.840]  the mainstream media has been attempting to smear trump as a racist bigot for the best part of the
[03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:47.200]  last two years the trump derangement syndrome has run rampant even though trump was largely seen
[03:08:47.200 --> 03:08:53.680]  before he ran as a republican as very beneficial towards the black community did a lot of charity
[03:08:53.680 --> 03:08:59.360]  work he was even name dropped in numerous rap songs by numerous hip hop artists he was seen as a
[03:08:59.360 --> 03:09:05.440]  friend to the black community before he ran as a republican and then he's a bigot of racist he's
[03:09:05.440 --> 03:09:12.080]  literally hitler so again we have the situation where you know obama was brought in he was heralded
[03:09:12.080 --> 03:09:19.040]  as the the the leader of a new era of positive race relations and yet what was going on when he
[03:09:19.040 --> 03:09:25.120]  left office and in the year before he left office we had the riots in furgus and we had the riots
[03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:31.280]  in baltimore we had the emergence of a black lives matter movement that chanted for dead cops that
[03:09:31.280 --> 03:09:37.440]  soured race relations across the board that anointed as its hero let's not forget an actual
[03:09:37.440 --> 03:09:44.000]  cop killer assorted chicor who was on the fbi's most wanted domestic terrorist list so that that was
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:52.480]  obama's accomplishment unfulfilled promises trump came in he offered and he delivered on his promise
[03:09:52.480 --> 03:09:59.520]  which was of course mainly the jobs issue as we saw last week there you see assorted chicor who is
[03:09:59.520 --> 03:10:05.440]  still by the way a fugitive they're still hunting for her i think she was in exile in cuba the last
[03:10:05.440 --> 03:10:11.760]  time anyone heard of her literally involved in murdering police officers and that's who black
[03:10:11.760 --> 03:10:18.800]  lives matter leaders invoke and worship every single event that's the great soothing race
[03:10:18.800 --> 03:10:23.920]  relations that obama brought to america of course last week we found out that black unemployment
[03:10:23.920 --> 03:10:31.120]  hit its lowest level since the government started to record the data in 1972 that black
[03:10:31.120 --> 03:10:39.920]  unemployment level now stands at just 5.9 percent so again donald trump is proving to be a very very
[03:10:39.920 --> 03:10:47.920]  poor racist in fact we just had news about 10 minutes ago which i tweeted breaking noted racist
[03:10:47.920 --> 03:10:53.520]  donald trump to consider pardoning black woman alice marie johnson who was jailed for life for a
[03:10:53.520 --> 03:10:59.520]  first time drug offense of course this came as a result of the meeting with kim kardashian now
[03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:06.960]  trump is considering pardoning alice marie johnson remember there was the famous boxer a couple of
[03:11:06.960 --> 03:11:13.440]  weeks ago that he also pardoned again another african-american so again donald trump not not
[03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:19.760]  not performing too well in terms of being a racist of course we had his meeting with kandice owens
[03:11:19.760 --> 03:11:27.840]  and charlie kerr just about a week ago following canya west public praise for the pro trump activist
[03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:33.120]  and again what did the polls show after that we had the report last month support for trump amongst
[03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:43.040]  black males in the week after karnia west praised kandice owens doubled it doubled how big is that
[03:11:43.040 --> 03:11:52.320]  going to be as we approach 2020 with trump going for reelection absolutely massive and if these
[03:11:52.320 --> 03:11:58.240]  unemployment levels can remain as low or even lower as they've ever been trump is going to pick up
[03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:03.040]  more support amongst african-americans of course he's never going to pick up any anywhere near
[03:12:03.040 --> 03:12:08.160]  a majority of support because they're on the plantation and very much kept there which is why
[03:12:08.160 --> 03:12:13.520]  they fear kandice owens so much in fact today she tweeted that she's probably thinking about running
[03:12:13.520 --> 03:12:19.440]  for political office somewhere in the not too distant future and that is going to absolutely
[03:12:19.440 --> 03:12:25.840]  terrify them because as the polls proved this is actually getting through to black people
[03:12:25.840 --> 03:12:31.200]  specifically getting through to young black people and now we see across the board across america
[03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:38.720]  and and amongst the african-american community they see life as being better for their community
[03:12:38.720 --> 03:12:45.520]  under trump compared to under obama in numbers that are basically doubled that is huge that is
[03:12:45.520 --> 03:12:50.560]  massive as we head towards these midterms now that's this is not in a vacuum let's not forget
[03:12:51.840 --> 03:12:55.920]  given their obsession with identity politics the democrats that left thought they would
[03:12:55.920 --> 03:13:02.160]  recover from the 2016 election they haven't millenials support for democrats is down
[03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:08.320]  nine percentage points since 2016 they haven't picked up anything and in fact they've lost
[03:13:08.320 --> 03:13:13.040]  they've lost their advantage in terms of the midterms remember back in december what was it
[03:13:13.040 --> 03:13:21.040]  they had a 13 point lead on republicans there you see democrats are losing support of millenials
[03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:26.640]  we had obviously oh in earlier talking about mad maxine waters and her handful of millenials that
[03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:33.520]  showed up for her event which is specifically tailored for millenials they had 10 people
[03:13:33.520 --> 03:13:41.360]  in that category show up so that their message just does not resonate they were 13 points ahead
[03:13:41.360 --> 03:13:48.480]  who's talking about a blue wave now who's talking about a blue wave nobody it's collapsed
[03:13:48.480 --> 03:13:55.600]  latest polls show the race for congress is within the margin of error and it's no doubt partly
[03:13:56.560 --> 03:14:02.480]  because of black americans their lives have immeasurably improved as have the lives of many
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:07.760]  because of the economic numbers under donald trump so this is going to be huge going forward
[03:14:08.480 --> 03:14:14.160]  and what do the media have in response again every single day oh the white house is in a
[03:14:14.160 --> 03:14:20.400]  constitutional crisis it's either that or it's some bizarre obsessive distraction like now we
[03:14:20.400 --> 03:14:27.760]  have malania trump she has serious kidney a serious kidney operation which other other people have
[03:14:27.760 --> 03:14:32.720]  commented who've had similar operations it's put them out of action for two months she's been gone
[03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:39.040]  what about three weeks i mean she's appeared in public days ago but now she's been gone from you
[03:14:39.040 --> 03:14:45.200]  know public events where she's on camera for about three weeks they've woven conspiracy theories about
[03:14:45.200 --> 03:14:50.800]  her about donald trump like being in a fight with her or her leaving the country it's absolutely
[03:14:50.800 --> 03:14:57.760]  insane remember these are the same people who said that we in the case of cnn's bryan's delta
[03:14:57.760 --> 03:15:03.280]  were reckless conspiracy theorists because we pointed at hillary clinton as she coughed and
[03:15:03.280 --> 03:15:08.320]  stumbled her way through the campaign trail and said maybe there's something wrong with her
[03:15:08.320 --> 03:15:14.320]  maybe she has some kind of health issue we were reckless conspiracy theorists for doing that now
[03:15:14.320 --> 03:15:19.280]  maloney trump has a serious kidney operation she rests up for a couple of weeks she's but she's
[03:15:19.280 --> 03:15:25.680]  back in public life basically now but they're still on with this crazy conspiracy theory that
[03:15:25.680 --> 03:15:31.200]  she's invisible she's disappeared or that donald trump got in a physical fist fight with her
[03:15:31.760 --> 03:15:35.760]  where conspiracy theories where reckless for doing that with hillary with actual evidence
[03:15:35.760 --> 03:15:40.720]  when maloney has a serious kidney operation oh that's serious journalism to frame it to talk
[03:15:40.720 --> 03:15:45.920]  about it in that context absolutely incredible double standards we'll be back on the other side
[03:15:45.920 --> 03:15:55.280]  to talk about it more this is the allege wars dot com be back healthcare reform is confusing but

[03:22:26.640 --> 03:22:33.760]  right now at info wars store dot com now let's go to this video this is the truth about italy this
[03:22:33.760 --> 03:22:40.400]  went up last night absolutely monumental developments in europe barely anyone's talking about this
[03:22:40.400 --> 03:22:45.280]  because that basically they don't want to they're absolutely terrified of this populist wave
[03:22:45.280 --> 03:22:51.040]  sweeping the continent and where it could head next here is the truth about italy
[03:22:51.040 --> 03:22:57.600]  in case you missed it a political earthquake just hit europe an event that has the globally
[03:22:57.600 --> 03:23:04.560]  truly terrified in the most momentous challenge to the status quo in generations italy formed a
[03:23:04.560 --> 03:23:10.320]  populist government why does that matter because italy's ruling populist left right coalition is
[03:23:10.320 --> 03:23:17.760]  both anti mass migration and euro skeptic if italy's grand experiment succeeds it serves as a
[03:23:17.760 --> 03:23:24.240]  template for the rest of europe and a harbinger of doom for the survival of the european union
[03:23:24.240 --> 03:23:29.360]  if you doubt that then just look at how eu commissioner gunther ottinger reacted to the
[03:23:29.360 --> 03:23:35.920]  election saying quote the markets will teach italyans to vote for the right thing in other words
[03:23:35.920 --> 03:23:42.480]  technocrats will punish you for exercising your democratic choice an astounding level of arrogance
[03:23:42.480 --> 03:23:48.880]  but one that we've come to expect from the eu but worse than this the globalists actually attempted
[03:23:48.880 --> 03:23:56.160]  to install a former imf director and euro file as prime minister completely overriding the will of
[03:23:56.160 --> 03:24:04.160]  the people who voted for the exact opposite they've got the nerve to call victor orban an auto crap
[03:24:04.160 --> 03:24:09.680]  when he was democratically elected in a fair fight while literally attempting to institute a
[03:24:09.680 --> 03:24:16.080]  bloodless coup to overturn the results of a national election jonka has the nerve to tell italyans to
[03:24:16.080 --> 03:24:22.720]  work harder and stop blaming the eu for its problems when italy's economic problems only began
[03:24:22.720 --> 03:24:29.840]  after they joined the eurozone before that they were a powerhouse if you doubt how much italy's
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:35.920]  populist coalition threatens the european elite just look at how two of its preeminent propaganda
[03:24:35.920 --> 03:24:42.400]  organs the financial times and der spiegel referred to what happened the f t called the
[03:24:42.400 --> 03:24:49.360]  democratically elected coalition barbarians while der spiegel said quote italy is destroying
[03:24:49.360 --> 03:24:55.760]  itself and dragging down europe with it look at how george soros reacted spewing evidence-free
[03:24:55.760 --> 03:25:02.960]  conspiracy theories about matteo salvini being a puppet of putin suffice to say those globalist
[03:25:02.960 --> 03:25:09.280]  tears taste extra salty right now while the new left right coalition has numerous populist planks
[03:25:09.280 --> 03:25:15.440]  the most important of which is undoubtedly its vehement opposition to mass immigration league
[03:25:15.440 --> 03:25:23.440]  leader and interior minister salvini has vowed to deport 500 000 illegal migrants salvini had a
[03:25:23.440 --> 03:25:29.520]  message for illegals during a rally on sunday when he told them quote the free ride is over it's time
[03:25:29.520 --> 03:25:35.280]  to pack your bags the incentive for migrants to reach italy via the mediterranean route a
[03:25:35.280 --> 03:25:43.280]  suicidal venture promoted by soros backs angios and the european union will be eliminated instead
[03:25:43.280 --> 03:25:50.160]  of providing a taxi service for economic migrants falsely labeled refugees italy will crack down
[03:25:50.160 --> 03:25:57.200]  on criminal people smugglers and turn the boats back luigi dimayo leader of the five star movement
[03:25:57.200 --> 03:26:04.560]  has also suggested that gdp will no longer be seen as the primary indicator of economic growth
[03:26:04.560 --> 03:26:10.160]  this represents a wholesale rejection of neoliberalism and a return to a kind of
[03:26:10.160 --> 03:26:17.120]  localist high Tory style protectionist view that rampant capitalism and corporatism has massively
[03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:23.120]  eroded communities and culture this idea that monopoly capitalism has in fact harmed social
[03:26:23.120 --> 03:26:30.960]  cohesion diluted and vulgarized culture and corroded morality is one now taking root amongst
[03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:37.200]  increasing numbers of thinkers and influencers on the new right meanwhile the leagues lorenzo
[03:26:37.200 --> 03:26:42.960]  fontana now minister for families has even suggested that abortion and the promotion of
[03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:49.440]  gay marriage is part of a globalist plot to quote erase our people the new government plans to
[03:26:49.440 --> 03:26:55.200]  address italy's plummeting birthrate by boosting welfare for mothers and providing free child
[03:26:55.200 --> 03:27:00.800]  care facilities by upholding the country's catholic identity and proposing to register and
[03:27:00.800 --> 03:27:07.280]  monitor mosques the populist coalition is also showing its intention to reassert italy's christian
[03:27:07.280 --> 03:27:13.680]  heritage putting itself at loggerheads with the pope who has embraced a wishy washy internationalist
[03:27:13.680 --> 03:27:20.320]  view of islam completely at odds with the fact that islamism is an invasive aggressive doctrine
[03:27:20.320 --> 03:27:26.800]  that threatens the very survival of europe as we know it the coalition also wants to end sanctions
[03:27:26.800 --> 03:27:33.280]  on russia and work with mosco on combating the common threat of islamic terrorism a vital policy
[03:27:33.280 --> 03:27:40.000]  that trump attempted to pursue in america before he was hamstrung by relentless hysterical outbursts
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:46.400]  over russian collusion italy's populist coalition has embarked on a policy program that every other
[03:27:46.400 --> 03:27:52.480]  european country should be looking to mirror the global elite will now attempt to portray everything
[03:27:52.480 --> 03:27:59.760]  that happens in the country as a manifestation of chaos and instability in reality the only chaos
[03:27:59.760 --> 03:28:06.560]  and instability is that which is currently consuming the dictatorial arrogant corrupt european union
[03:28:06.560 --> 03:28:14.400]  as voters across the continent reject its arcane discredited Byzantine tyranny italy has said no
[03:28:14.400 --> 03:28:22.160]  to mass immigration no to the EU no to the erosion of its cultural birthright and starting with sweden
[03:28:22.160 --> 03:28:29.600]  in september we can now truly begin to hope that the rest of europe will follow the same course
[03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:38.480]  that is the truth about italy absolutely monumental development in europe and after the
[03:28:38.480 --> 03:28:43.600]  break we're going to tell you how the bilderberg globalists are reacting to this as they prepare

[03:33:28.240 --> 03:33:33.840]  of the biggest stories on the planet we're talking about the first populist government in europe
[03:33:33.840 --> 03:33:39.760]  for generations this is absolutely huge and let's not forget what they tried to do last week
[03:33:39.760 --> 03:33:44.320]  imagine for a second if you know donald trump had won the election which he did and then the
[03:33:44.320 --> 03:33:49.760]  electoral college said oh by the way we're not gonna let donald trump take his position in the
[03:33:49.760 --> 03:33:55.760]  oval office we're gonna give it to hillary clinton instead sorry your votes mean absolutely nothing
[03:33:55.760 --> 03:34:00.960]  that's literally what they tried to do in italy they tried to install this technocrat
[03:34:00.960 --> 03:34:07.840]  who was a former imf official a euro file until they had another election the two winning parties
[03:34:07.840 --> 03:34:13.200]  who were still arguing over how to form a coalition didn't want that to happen the italian people
[03:34:13.200 --> 03:34:17.760]  didn't want it to happen but the technocratic government simply said oh we're gonna do it
[03:34:17.760 --> 03:34:22.400]  anyway thankfully it didn't work i imagine they would have been have riots on the streets if
[03:34:22.400 --> 03:34:28.400]  they'd have tried to pull it off but now we have an agreement we have a platform a policy platform
[03:34:28.400 --> 03:34:33.680]  which as i said in that video should be mirrored across the rest of the continent and we have the
[03:34:33.680 --> 03:34:40.000]  globalist running scared drudge report linked to this earlier it is up on info wars dot com
[03:34:40.800 --> 03:34:45.120]  build above globalist concerned about populist uprising in europe don't take my word for it
[03:34:45.120 --> 03:34:51.920]  go and look at their agenda it's number one on the list the annual elitist confab is set to meet
[03:34:51.920 --> 03:34:57.200]  this week in turin which is an appropriate venue given that italy has just elected an anti mass
[03:34:57.200 --> 03:35:03.440]  migration eurosceptic coalition government let's not forget the promise made by salvini is to
[03:35:03.440 --> 03:35:08.480]  deport not only to stop migrants coming in economic migrants who aren't real refugees
[03:35:08.480 --> 03:35:15.760]  but to deport half a million illegal aliens already in italy that is an absolutely huge number
[03:35:15.760 --> 03:35:22.000]  but he's promised to do it meanwhile we have the EU we have the globalists trying to punish all
[03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:27.680]  these different european countries by forcing them to take migrants when they don't want to italy has
[03:35:27.680 --> 03:35:33.600]  said no italy has rejected it and now the build above globalists are not happy what are they
[03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:39.200]  going to do about it well what did they do about brexit nothing apart from try to derail it after
[03:35:39.200 --> 03:35:43.120]  it was already voted for which is exactly what they're going to do try and do again
[03:35:43.120 --> 03:35:50.240]  now the list for the build above group annual confab has been released as several high profile
[03:35:50.240 --> 03:35:55.200]  individuals on it has all the usual people that you would expect but it's their agenda that's key
[03:35:55.200 --> 03:36:01.600]  because again this is always vague it's always nonspecific but number one on the list they're
[03:36:01.600 --> 03:36:07.680]  talking about the populist movement across europe so they're very concerned about what's happening
[03:36:07.680 --> 03:36:15.520]  in italy because again it could be the example that could set the stage for the rest of the continent
[03:36:15.520 --> 03:36:20.400]  so absolutely monumental developments and nobody's talking about it should be one of the biggest
[03:36:20.400 --> 03:36:24.800]  stories on the planet now nobody's talking about it nobody was really even talking about it last
[03:36:24.800 --> 03:36:31.760]  week when they literally tried to have a bloodless coup and install a technocrat absolutely incredible
[03:36:31.760 --> 03:36:39.760]  situation now you've probably seen the news about miss america will not contestants will no longer
[03:36:39.760 --> 03:36:46.400]  be judged on personal appearances that's right gretchen colson who is now apparently the head
[03:36:46.400 --> 03:36:52.160]  of miss america has basically said that it's more important what comes out of their mouths that's
[03:36:52.160 --> 03:36:58.720]  what we should care about i mean after all it's not like this is a beauty pageant is it yeah
[03:36:58.720 --> 03:37:03.920]  that's exactly what it is it's a beauty pageant these women are supposed to be judged on their
[03:37:03.920 --> 03:37:11.120]  attractiveness on their physical appearance on their beauty that's the whole point this is the
[03:37:11.120 --> 03:37:17.200]  depths of stupidity have not been plumbed until we saw this story today i mean we've had the stories
[03:37:17.200 --> 03:37:23.520]  about banning grid girls the nfl discussing now banning cheerleaders they're banning booze babes
[03:37:23.520 --> 03:37:30.160]  all across the western world now miss america contestants will no longer be judged on personal
[03:37:30.160 --> 03:37:37.680]  appearances but generally speaking the kind of lame overforced virtue signaling cliches that they
[03:37:37.680 --> 03:37:43.680]  can come out with that's what they're going to be judged on which of course will lead to women
[03:37:43.680 --> 03:37:48.560]  who aren't attractive who are fat and ugly feminists trying to take part in this and trying to win it
[03:37:48.560 --> 03:37:55.360]  and some of them probably will win it if this is the new standard for beauty contestants will be asked
[03:37:55.360 --> 03:38:01.200]  to quote demonstrate their passion intelligence and overall understanding of the job of miss america
[03:38:01.200 --> 03:38:06.000]  which of course is completely dull and boring nobody will watch that they've banned the swimsuit
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:12.640]  contest they've banned the evening gown contest nobody is going to watch your stupid beauty pageant
[03:38:12.640 --> 03:38:19.280]  if it's not even a beauty pageant you utter idiots but again we've seen this elsewhere haven't we
[03:38:19.280 --> 03:38:24.800]  we've seen it with the nfl kneeling in front of the anthem we've seen it in the award shows the
[03:38:24.800 --> 03:38:30.400]  golden globes the oscars well they've turned them into basically a mechanism to amplify
[03:38:30.400 --> 03:38:36.160]  cliched woke social justice narratives and how did americans respond how did they respond to the
[03:38:36.160 --> 03:38:42.320]  nfl controversy they turned away in their droves how did they respond to the golden globes to the
[03:38:42.320 --> 03:38:49.840]  oscars lowest ratings ever this ain't gonna work they're literally committing suicide so they can
[03:38:49.840 --> 03:38:57.760]  have some kind of lame virtue signaling moment that nobody even cares about the changes are part
[03:38:57.760 --> 03:39:03.040]  of an effort to bring the contest in line with the me too movement which of course now we know
[03:39:03.040 --> 03:39:08.960]  has been completely exploited and exaggerated to basically denounce everyone as guilty until proven
[03:39:08.960 --> 03:39:16.480]  innocent to the point where now 25 percent of us millennial men think that asking a girl out on a
[03:39:16.480 --> 03:39:23.040]  date is sexual harassment yeah how's that gonna go how's that gonna go with marriage rates already
[03:39:23.040 --> 03:39:28.160]  declining fertility rates declining people not having kids anymore how's that gonna work out for
[03:39:28.160 --> 03:39:35.760]  you carlson who by the way was a very poor fox news host she's probably the worst one there said
[03:39:35.760 --> 03:39:39.600]  we've heard from a lot of young women who say we'd love to be a part of your program but we don't
[03:39:39.600 --> 03:39:46.000]  want to be out there in high heels in a swimsuit that's the point so guess what you don't have to
[03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:51.680]  do that anymore okay so why don't we why don't we apply this to everything why don't we say oh
[03:39:51.680 --> 03:39:56.080]  by the way there's those long jumpers you know the long jumpers in the olympics we're not gonna
[03:39:56.080 --> 03:40:02.320]  judge it anymore on how long they can jump no we're gonna judge it on the kind of speech they give
[03:40:02.320 --> 03:40:07.920]  beforehand we're gonna judge we're not gonna judge olympic swimmers on how well they swim we're not
[03:40:07.920 --> 03:40:14.000]  gonna judge the 100 meters race on who gets to 100 meters the quickest now we're gonna judge it on
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:21.280]  who can recite feminist flam poetry the quickest this is the race to the bottom in terms of quality
[03:40:21.280 --> 03:40:27.280]  and it's utterly utterly stupid but again i've talked about it before we had the grid girls
[03:40:27.280 --> 03:40:34.160]  you had the boob babes you had the cheerleaders going now this is going the same way the whole
[03:40:34.160 --> 03:40:39.520]  point of miss america is the enjoyment of objective standards of beauty and that's what this is all
[03:40:39.520 --> 03:40:45.520]  about it's about fat ugly feminists it's about far left social justice warriors launching war on
[03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:52.000]  objective beauty standards because they literally think there's a giant patriarchal conspiracy
[03:40:52.000 --> 03:40:59.440]  which has been you know foisted on the world in coordination in a conspiracy with the beauty
[03:40:59.440 --> 03:41:04.800]  industry that these objective standards of beauty you know women who are have an attractive base
[03:41:04.800 --> 03:41:10.240]  have an attractive body workout of physically in shape have certain hip to waist ratios which again
[03:41:10.240 --> 03:41:15.920]  scientifically proven to have objective standards of beauty they literally think that's a giant
[03:41:15.920 --> 03:41:22.160]  conspiracy that people got behind closed doors and talked about for decades and that that's why
[03:41:22.160 --> 03:41:27.680]  men are attracted to attractive women they literally think that and this is the kind of
[03:41:27.680 --> 03:41:33.920]  intersectional insanity that is now ruining everything they won't be satisfied until they've
[03:41:33.920 --> 03:41:40.640]  ruined absolutely everything they won't be satisfied until their puritanical g had against
[03:41:40.640 --> 03:41:47.840]  fun is complete now as i write in the article you know what's next is you know miss america miss
[03:41:48.400 --> 03:41:54.240]  miss sounds pretty transphobic to me why don't we have hordes of fat hairy men why aren't they allowed
[03:41:54.240 --> 03:41:59.600]  to enter given that attractiveness is no longer an advantage okay you're saying that attractiveness
[03:41:59.600 --> 03:42:05.360]  personal appearance no longer matters where are the fat hairy men i mean maybe i can enter and you
[03:42:05.360 --> 03:42:11.680]  know given that that's not a standard for victory attractiveness anyone can win absolutely anyone
[03:42:11.680 --> 03:42:18.480]  can win so again the intersectional nonsense that they've tried to inject into everything you see
[03:42:18.480 --> 03:42:23.920]  it across the board you see in sport you see it in hollywood you see it in award shows you even see
[03:42:23.920 --> 03:42:29.760]  it in art where now a piece of art isn't judged on its objective beauty or the skill or craft that
[03:42:29.760 --> 03:42:36.000]  went into it it's judged on whether or not it has the right social justice message they're turning
[03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:43.120]  everything into an amplification device for their narrative for their insane propaganda which
[03:42:43.120 --> 03:42:48.800]  fundamentally is an attack on the family and an attack on basic normal biology this is the alex
[03:42:48.800 --> 03:42:55.120]  john show live will be back after the break in four wars dot com living in volcano may sound more
[03:42:55.120 --> 03:43:00.960]  dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on
[03:43:00.960 --> 03:43:07.520]  the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash
[03:43:07.520 --> 03:43:13.840]  may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels
[03:43:13.840 --> 03:43:20.960]  to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned
[03:43:20.960 --> 03:43:25.360]  was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:31.200]  next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[03:43:31.200 --> 03:43:38.480]  metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out
[03:43:38.480 --> 03:43:44.080]  the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic
[03:43:44.080 --> 03:43:50.800]  ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration
[03:43:50.800 --> 03:43:56.880]  system will purify it staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home

[03:47:16.800 --> 03:47:21.280]  and now your host paul joseph watson
[03:47:23.360 --> 03:47:28.720]  go back it is the final segment of the fourth hour of the alex jones show now before the break
[03:47:28.720 --> 03:47:32.880]  we were talking about the miss america contest contestants to be no longer judged on personal
[03:47:32.880 --> 03:47:37.200]  appearance now the studio reminded me of this video that we have which we're going to roll now
[03:47:37.760 --> 03:47:44.800]  because it's very appropriate given what gretchen carlson said to justify this move we're not only
[03:47:44.800 --> 03:47:49.920]  only banning the swimsuit contest and the evening gown contest they're saying that the contestants
[03:47:49.920 --> 03:47:56.080]  will no longer be judged on their personal beauty in a beauty pageant but they will be judged on
[03:47:56.080 --> 03:48:03.600]  according to gretchen carlson what comes out of their mouths because according to her that's what
[03:48:03.600 --> 03:48:09.520]  we care about let's listen to what came out of the mouth of one beauty contestant i think this
[03:48:09.520 --> 03:48:18.800]  was miss teen usa in this infamous clip let's roll it okay recent polls have shown a fifth of
[03:48:18.800 --> 03:48:26.960]  americans can't locate the us on a world map why do you think this is i personally believe
[03:48:27.680 --> 03:48:36.880]  that us americans are unable to do so because uh some people out there in our nation don't have
[03:48:36.880 --> 03:48:45.200]  bounce and i believe that our education like such as south africa and iraq everywhere like such as
[03:48:45.200 --> 03:48:52.880]  and i believe that they should uh our education over here in the us should help the us or should
[03:48:52.880 --> 03:48:59.040]  help south africa it should help the iraq and the asian countries so we will be able to build up
[03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:09.120]  our future or thank you very much south carolina okay so we're being told that we should judge beauty
[03:49:09.120 --> 03:49:15.360]  pageant contestants based not on their appearance but on what comes out of their mouths according to
[03:49:15.360 --> 03:49:21.680]  gretchen carlson that's what we should care about well that's what comes out of their mouths and that's
[03:49:21.680 --> 03:49:27.200]  not the point is it literally no one cares what comes out of their mouths unless they say something
[03:49:27.200 --> 03:49:32.880]  stupid because we're not trying to find the next rocket scientist we're not trying to find the next
[03:49:32.880 --> 03:49:38.720]  brain surgeon we're trying to find miss america the most attractive woman of course there are other
[03:49:38.720 --> 03:49:44.720]  categories but the beauty the attractiveness the personal appearance has to be prime amongst them
[03:49:44.720 --> 03:49:49.440]  given that it's a beauty pageant and again they say oh we need to provide good role models for
[03:49:49.440 --> 03:49:56.000]  young women so provide those two you can provide academic you can provide intellectual role models
[03:49:56.000 --> 03:50:02.720]  for young women as well as having beauty pageants those two things can exist in the same world you
[03:50:02.720 --> 03:50:10.400]  utter morons and again they did some goal of this there's some objective the eventual consequence
[03:50:10.400 --> 03:50:16.400]  would be to take away opportunities from attractive young women who maybe aren't the most intelligent
[03:50:16.400 --> 03:50:22.080]  but are intelligent enough to use their looks to get ahead in life and why would anyone deprive them
[03:50:22.080 --> 03:50:26.800]  of that if you're an actual feminist why are you trying to deprive women of opportunities
[03:50:28.320 --> 03:50:33.680]  again they they they put out a tweet today the official miss america twitter account
[03:50:34.320 --> 03:50:41.360]  where they showed a bikini going up in smoke with the hashtag bye bye bikini well i don't
[03:50:41.360 --> 03:50:46.080]  know about bye bye bikini i think it's going to be bye bye viewers for you because the american
[03:50:46.080 --> 03:50:51.360]  people have spoken when you've tried to insert this lame floppy virtue signal and crap into
[03:50:51.360 --> 03:50:58.240]  everything else they've rejected it time and time again people are sick of social justice of
[03:50:58.240 --> 03:51:02.800]  intersectional nonsense being injected into absolutely everything when they're trying to
[03:51:02.800 --> 03:51:07.040]  watch a football game when they're trying to watch a beauty pageant when they're trying to get away
[03:51:07.040 --> 03:51:13.280]  from politics for five frigging minutes and they can't because you just keep shoving it down their
[03:51:13.280 --> 03:51:22.960]  throats bye bye bikini no bye bye viewers bye bye miss america absolutely
[03:51:25.520 --> 03:51:31.120]  moving off tapping in the uk we have another poll out the uk today which kind of relates to this
[03:51:31.120 --> 03:51:37.040]  this is the headline out of west monster 66 of britain political correctness has gone too far
[03:51:38.240 --> 03:51:42.560]  every day now in the mainstream media the talk is of being offended or something being banned back
[03:51:42.560 --> 03:51:48.000]  in the real world though brits have had enough of bs political correctness they're all too often
[03:51:48.000 --> 03:51:55.200]  stifles debate comedy and fun and beauty pageants number crunching politics polling firm cap x has
[03:51:55.200 --> 03:52:03.520]  found that 66 percent of brits think political correctness has gone too far only nine percent
[03:52:03.520 --> 03:52:08.960]  saying it hasn't gone far enough now these figures include 41 percent who say that it is on much too
[03:52:08.960 --> 03:52:14.080]  far and an additional 25 percent saying it has gone a little too far so you're talking about the
[03:52:14.080 --> 03:52:19.120]  clear majority of the british people who think the political correctness has gone too far yet
[03:52:19.120 --> 03:52:26.080]  the point that this article makes again is it's that nine percent that hardcore nine percent
[03:52:26.080 --> 03:52:30.400]  that's permanently offended over absolutely everything they're the ones who the companies
[03:52:30.400 --> 03:52:37.360]  apologize to they're the ones who create the mass mob outrage online campaigns to shame to silence
[03:52:37.360 --> 03:52:43.840]  people into basically cowardice rolling over groveling genuflecting to these idiots who don't
[03:52:43.840 --> 03:52:49.280]  have any real power but just because there's a few of them and they're noisy about it people cave
[03:52:49.280 --> 03:52:55.120]  people back down people need to stop caving and backing down to these idiots because they're nowhere
[03:52:55.120 --> 03:53:00.320]  near the majority they're a tiny minority and they should be completely ignored
[03:53:00.320 --> 03:53:07.200]  now over in france we have a fake news law being passed this is out of afp
[03:53:08.000 --> 03:53:13.840]  france's fake news law leaves media experts uneasy france is the latest country attempting to fight
[03:53:13.840 --> 03:53:17.520]  the scourge of fake news with legislation but opponents say the law won't work and could even
[03:53:17.520 --> 03:53:23.280]  be used to silence critics now they're calling it an attempt by the government this this is actually
[03:53:23.280 --> 03:53:28.160]  what the government said they're talking about manipulation of information in the run-up to
[03:53:28.160 --> 03:53:35.440]  elections they want to have the power to stop manipulation of information now of course that
[03:53:35.440 --> 03:53:43.600]  is so vague that it could be used blanket style to silence dissent to silence alternative information
[03:53:43.600 --> 03:53:49.680]  to silence scandalous information potentially about political candidates about establishment
[03:53:49.680 --> 03:53:55.520]  political candidates so we see this across the board of course the EU's threatening to find
[03:53:55.520 --> 03:54:02.480]  people who don't remove fake news within 24 hours facebook has had a system where people can flag
[03:54:02.480 --> 03:54:08.480]  fake news it completely backfired it only made that news go more viral now of course there are fake
[03:54:08.480 --> 03:54:13.680]  news websites that put out genuinely fake news but what they're trying to do with this is apply it
[03:54:13.680 --> 03:54:20.320]  in a vague slapdash fashion so again it silences conservative content and it's in the algorithm
[03:54:20.320 --> 03:54:24.800]  i've said it over and over again we're all slaves to the algorithm the studies show that they can
[03:54:24.800 --> 03:54:32.640]  shift millions millions of votes prior to elections simply based on what search results come up first
[03:54:32.640 --> 03:54:38.720]  in terms of negativity and positivity towards a certain political candidate or a certain political
[03:54:38.720 --> 03:54:45.360]  party i mean i can barely even find news articles that i've written that i'm trying to reference
[03:54:45.360 --> 03:54:50.000]  while writing a new news article on google because they've buried them in the algorithm
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:55.840]  so much you can put in the exact headline into the search bar you can put my name you can put
[03:54:55.840 --> 03:55:01.200]  infowars.com and it still doesn't find it because they've buried infowars.com in the algorithm
[03:55:01.200 --> 03:55:08.080]  they're doing the exact same thing on facebook this is the war of the algorithm this is what will
[03:55:08.080 --> 03:55:15.120]  decide future elections and this is why to some extent these monopolies which are not free market
[03:55:15.120 --> 03:55:22.880]  need to be regulated and people need to have an internet bill of rights now speaking about europe
[03:55:22.880 --> 03:55:28.320]  again this is out of Breitbart donkirk lorry driver stabbed by migrants trying to break into
[03:55:28.320 --> 03:55:33.040]  britain lorry driver has been seriously injured by two migrants who were trying to break into his
[03:55:33.040 --> 03:55:38.800]  vehicle for a ride to britain at the rest stop near donkirk this was a list uanian who was taking
[03:55:38.800 --> 03:55:43.040]  a break after several hours of driving at rest area in the town of craywick in france when he
[03:55:43.040 --> 03:55:49.600]  heard noises in his truck basically they ambushed him they stabbed him trying to get a free ride
[03:55:49.600 --> 03:55:56.320]  again last week we had a story about female truck drivers being threatened with rape if they don't
[03:55:56.320 --> 03:56:01.760]  let these migrants get on board and sneak into the country they raised the calais migrant camp
[03:56:01.760 --> 03:56:05.760]  they just went to different areas of france they're living on the streets paris is basically an
[03:56:05.760 --> 03:56:11.440]  open air migrant camp they're saying oh you can just take over these parks it's absolute bedlam
[03:56:11.440 --> 03:56:16.400]  the calais migrant camp itself is slowly coming back into existence again they haven't dealt
[03:56:16.400 --> 03:56:21.920]  with the problem which is why we need governments like the one in italy which is vowed to deport
[03:56:21.920 --> 03:56:29.360]  500 000 illegals and stop this insane program of basically being a victim of the e use threats
[03:56:29.360 --> 03:56:36.160]  and intimidation to forcibly take migrants to forcibly erase their own populations absolutely
[03:56:36.160 --> 03:56:43.440]  incredible situation meanwhile over in sweden municipal residents will pray for diversity
[03:56:43.440 --> 03:56:49.520]  on their own national day this is the municipality of fallou which celebrates national day basically
[03:56:49.520 --> 03:56:55.840]  swedans july the fourth on wednesday but they've been told by the local municipality that instead
[03:56:55.840 --> 03:57:02.240]  they will be praying for diversity now let's not forget that sweden is a country who they
[03:57:02.240 --> 03:57:08.240]  appointed as the head of their national heritage board somebody who admitted who was a muslim
[03:57:08.240 --> 03:57:13.360]  migrant who admitted that he knew nothing about swedish heritage and what little he did know
[03:57:13.360 --> 03:57:20.640]  about swedish heritage was racist now of course sweden is in the same boat as italy to some extent
[03:57:20.640 --> 03:57:25.280]  they've got a big election coming up in september the nationalist the anti mass migration party
[03:57:25.280 --> 03:57:30.880]  doing really well and we hope they have massive success we hope they mirror the example the
[03:57:30.880 --> 03:57:36.560]  fantastic example set by italy that's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour war room is coming up
