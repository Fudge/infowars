[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:15.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:29.000]  Well, despite all the bad things that are happening around the world and what evil people are up to as they team up together to feed on the rest of us,
[00:29.000 --> 00:39.000]  it's still a beautiful day and life is wonderful. And at least we're waking up on a planetary scale to what the globalist are engaged in on a planetary scale.
[00:39.000 --> 00:52.000]  Thank you so much for joining us today. I really do appreciate you tuning in. It is Wednesday. It is already good old Wednesday or Thursday.
[00:52.000 --> 01:10.000]  The 15th day of May 2008, and we're going to be live for the next four hours. I'm here live Monday through Friday from 11am until 3pm Central Standard Time.
[01:10.000 --> 01:24.000]  We have a really big radio show lined up for you today. Jim Tucker is going to be popping in on the show coming up in the third hour.
[01:24.000 --> 01:40.000]  And we're going to find out if he believes that the Bilderberg group really met in Athens, Greece, outside Athens, Greece in the Mediterranean last weekend. Or is this Greek newspaper wrong? Is Bilderberg.org and Tony Gosling wrong?
[01:40.000 --> 01:48.000]  Tony Gosling is a pretty credible guy. And he seems to think that that was the intel they had before. They were going to be meeting in the next few weeks in Greece.
[01:48.000 --> 02:04.000]  And that indeed that is what has now transpired and happened. This is a victory for the Bilderberg group that for 30-plus years has always had their events covered even back when the media denied the group existed more than 10 years ago or so.
[02:04.000 --> 02:14.000]  It really upset them and has exposed the shadow government. A lot of the leaks and information we get out of the hotel after they leave or while they're there from those that are serving them.
[02:14.000 --> 02:24.000]  The scraps of paper, the itinerary, things of that nature have given us a lot of key intel for the year ahead. And this is indeed the case. It's not a good thing.
[02:24.000 --> 02:34.000]  So we'll find out what Jim Tucker popping in to see if he thinks this has really happened or if this is another diversion that some folks have bought into.
[02:34.000 --> 02:51.000]  We'll be talking again with Jim Tucker coming up in two hours from now. In the meantime, wide open phones today throughout the first, second, third and fourth hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  I was babbling a bit there at the start of the show, stumbling a bit because I have so much here in front of me. This is some of the news that is coming up.
[02:59.000 --> 03:09.000]  Wired magazine, could soldiers be prosecuted for thought crime? That's right. They are now announcing that they're making the troops take implantable chips, as we told you years ago they would do.
[03:09.000 --> 03:18.000]  And now they're announcing that they will have their brain chips. This, of course, was in declassified military documents in 2000. Now they're telling the general slave public.
[03:18.000 --> 03:29.000]  But you'll have access to the latest upgrade of video games like We So So What. Also, Homeland Security to Train Cops to Combat Roadside Bombs in the United States.
[03:29.000 --> 03:39.000]  All part of the false hysteria and fear about imaginary terrorists. The real attacks are carried out by our loving government, which is not our government. It's a foreign owned corporation.
[03:39.000 --> 03:55.000]  Arizona State University test pandemic flu plans. Chicago citizens reject terror drill fear mongering. Speeders under Florida law face vehicle confiscation five to ten years in prison.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  It has passed. It is now the law.
[03:58.000 --> 04:11.000]  Don't forget that the private prison industry is lobbying all 50 states to increase laws and penalties to pack all their private prisons. You thought sending the pot smokers to jail was OK.
[04:11.000 --> 04:20.000]  Well, they're going to be sending you to jail for speeding, buddy. And the felons are going to be the jail guards. So enjoy the new America.
[04:20.000 --> 04:29.000]  Gun owners protest police action despite the fact they were allowed to own guns in the town. Their guns were confiscated and also these tornadoes that have been happening.
[04:29.000 --> 04:38.000]  FEMA locks down the cities and confiscates the guns. That's happening. So it's now a regular course of action. Globalists take a step closer to $200 a bearer oil.
[04:38.000 --> 04:50.000]  U.S. heading towards double digit inflation. England in double digit inflation. Bank of England says we will get into Pentagon carpet bombs. The opposition in cyberspace admits they're engaged in propaganda.
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  Hey, Emily. Wow, you look great.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  I feel great. I've been using medical and colon cleanse.
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.000]  Really? What is it? How does it work?
[05:00.000 --> 05:09.000]  Medicines is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body. Medicines is easy to use without being intrusive.
[05:09.000 --> 05:15.000]  You take two tablespoons of medical powder mixed with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  That's it? What sounds so easy and convenient?
[05:17.000 --> 05:25.000]  It is easy. Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  It helps with all of those elements? That's amazing.
[05:28.000 --> 05:34.000]  And the bentonite clay and medical cleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  Wow. Where can I buy a medical cleanse?
[05:36.000 --> 05:42.000]  A one month supply is available online at Medicines.com. That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E.com.

[05:53.000 --> 05:58.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[05:58.000 --> 06:03.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[06:03.000 --> 06:08.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[06:08.000 --> 06:19.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[06:19.000 --> 06:27.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their after easy.

[07:53.000 --> 08:04.000]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:04.000 --> 08:17.000]  You know, there's a group called Skrula's Change that has logos like 101st Fighting Keyboards, Weed, Chickens for Lunch.
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  Most of the guys on there admit they are currently in psyops or working with the military.
[08:19.000 --> 08:26.000]  I don't know if they're openly paid to run their website of disinformation and lies and black propaganda.
[08:26.000 --> 08:34.000]  By black propaganda, they go out and cover Cooke 9-11 groups and that goes back to the 60s.
[08:34.000 --> 08:46.000]  They would put somebody on the stand during the Garrison trial on JFK and then one of his star witnesses would suddenly start acting insane like a chicken on the stand and then the media would cover that.
[08:46.000 --> 09:01.000]  So they have people running around and Hitler mustaches in front of news cameras screaming 9-11's an inside job and waving signs saying that 9-11 truth carried out the bombing of the Military Recruiting Center in New York and Howard Stern has them on to run around screaming and Hitler mustaches.
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  I mean, people see right through what you're doing. I mean, I want everybody to understand that.
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.000]  I mean, they don't even hide there from the military.
[09:08.000 --> 09:15.000]  And I have all these articles here today where the Pentagon just says, yeah, we're engaging propaganda on the internet domestically and internationally.
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  Yeah, we've got private corporations hired and our own troops doing it and sent comms doing it.
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  And that's what they're admitting. And then these guys all have handles.
[09:24.000 --> 09:36.000]  You know, when they come on your message boards and comment pages and then you can even find their the handle they use and they'll go to their Myspace and it's them in Iraq or it's them at sent com.
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  And they say they're in psyops and they don't even hide it. I mean, it's just because to them they think it's normal.
[09:42.000 --> 09:51.000]  They think it's good. They think being in the military and engaging the American people and trying to lie about us and put out this info.
[09:51.000 --> 09:58.000]  They think that's normal. They think that's good so they don't even sent com and the Pentagon doesn't even really have them hide it anymore.
[09:58.000 --> 10:04.000]  But there's one of them on here saying, hey, I just got the word. I've got to take the chip.
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.000]  And he goes on to say it's a little creepy, but you know, they're ordering me to so I'm going to do it.
[10:10.000 --> 10:16.000]  And then he post on one of the pages, his papers and why he's getting the chip.
[10:16.000 --> 10:24.000]  And I don't know if about it to know that he's either knows about the real program and is wanting us to bite on it so he can then say, oh, I'm not really getting it.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  It's kind of a black propaganda deal again, or probably not the way this is phrased. It's like, yeah, I'm getting it.
[10:30.000 --> 10:37.000]  And, you know, it's kind of a good thing. And then the guys are commenting on the page saying, yeah, you know, this is just a conspiracy theory to be against it.
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  It's this trackable RFID embeddable chip and your skin's good.
[10:41.000 --> 10:52.000]  Of course, five and a half years ago when my cousin knocked on the door, he been in, he's been in Iraq, Afghanistan three times.
[10:52.000 --> 11:01.000]  I rack twice, but in between that he is dealing with infrastructure protection and the government and the army keeping us safe here in Austin.
[11:01.000 --> 11:10.000]  And but he did say, yeah, we were told that all the officers were going to get chips in two years that are in his area and they all got their chips.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  And but then you can't talk about it once you get them.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  And then now the lower level people are getting their chips.
[11:16.000 --> 11:27.000]  And I'm just going off the DARPA report released on the 7th of January 2000 where they said next they would have you take brain chips.
[11:27.000 --> 11:37.000]  And then they said that we would all basically then become rack heads or wire heads, kind of like how a lot of the workers in Japan just live in apartments that are coffin size.
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.000]  They just slide into the wall at night and you have your own TV and stuff in them.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  Well, they say you're going to have a brain pleasure interface.
[11:43.000 --> 11:53.000]  Now soldiers will have an amnesiac interface that erases their memories and that the troops will be rewarded with drugs, rewarded with pleasure, rewarded with sex simulations.
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.000]  The public will be and the pleasure will be so great that you won't be able to refuse it.
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  And so then we'll stop breeding.
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  That's what the more friendly eugenics say that we're all just going to be put in racks.
[12:06.000 --> 12:15.000]  And they talk about how they're going to phase it in with first promoting the microchip for security for Alzheimer's for prisoners for police for military for security.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  And then how they would make you have it to have other security jobs or in power plants or in nursing homes.
[12:20.000 --> 12:26.000]  And then if you want to be in the military, you got to have it in the fighter pilots are the first to get the brain chips.
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  By the way, they've already got research programs doing that.
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.000]  And that's admitted now.
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.000]  We've been going off for 20 years.
[12:30.000 --> 12:31.000]  Now it's admitted.
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.000]  And then you just won't be able to have a job period if you don't have it.
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  And then it will just be put into place and the military says their job.
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  And by the way, goofballs from Centcom listing.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  I mean, you want to go read it for yourself.
[12:44.000 --> 12:52.000]  Federation of American scientists published it, the military freaked out and said that's classified and the Federation said you gave us this to us for release.
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  And they said, well, we don't want that out now, but then it was too late.
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  Now it's finally eight years later in wire magazine today.
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  So we'll cover some of that.
[13:01.000 --> 13:12.000]  And I mean, I'm not the one saying that the Army's job is going to be inducting the citizenry by 2025 into our racks into our hive racks where we're going to live.
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  I'm not the one saying it.
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.000]  They say this is operational program for full dominance, for quote, full protection of the public.
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  We must be put in racks and then there'll be no terrorism, no crime, no problems.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  Now I know you're not going to go check it out.
[13:27.000 --> 13:35.000]  Centcom guys, you're too busy at the bar and playing baseball and acting tough and laughing at us and you know, doing all the things you do.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  Hey, Bermas, get in here.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  Bermas, we're up here at like midnight last night working and he finds all this where they're going, yo, we're getting our chips.
[13:43.000 --> 13:44.000]  And I guess it's good.
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  It wasn't on my desk.
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.000]  Where is it?
[13:46.000 --> 13:47.000]  No, it should be right on the desk.
[13:47.000 --> 13:48.000]  No, no, it was a giant.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  I cleaned off my desk and now it wasn't on the top.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  But I mean, you got all this paperwork, right?
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  Because, you know, they got to prove everything on the Randy forums.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  There was a link over to that.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  Oh, you got it.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  Good job.
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  I want to talk to you about this like at 1230.
[14:04.000 --> 14:05.000]  Hey, thank you so much, Bermas.
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.000]  But I mean, he's got his implantable RFID paperwork here and then the guys all post here.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  Well, this is good.
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  I mean, see, they had the first deny it was all happening.
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.000]  But then once they make them do it and they find out we were telling the truth, they go, okay, well, I'm for it.
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  See, that's a way a coward operates.
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  They say, that's not real.
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.000]  That's crazy.
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  That'll never happen.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  You know, because I haven't been reading DARPA documents.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  And then when it happens, you go, what?
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  And you can see it in the message board take place first.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  It's kind of creepy, but I guess it's an order and it's to keep me safe and then buy five posts down.
[14:43.000 --> 14:44.000]  Yeah, you're right.
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  It's great.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  It's wonderful.
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  God, man.
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  Why didn't I see it?
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  This is the most fabulous things that slice bread.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  Just like they're denying there's a North American Union.
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.000]  Meanwhile, they're on C-SPAN announcing they're already merging the EU with the U.S. and they've already signed the agreement.
[15:02.000 --> 15:10.000]  We're already in the transatlantic union publicly and you can't even get when the president's giving press conferences saying it.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  With Merkel and Barroso.
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  It doesn't matter to you sent con boys.
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  You're at the topless bar.
[15:15.000 --> 15:21.000]  They're in Florida tonight and having fun with your buds and your commanders know how to manipulate you and patch you on the head.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  This little brainwash cult and you went through eight weeks of brainwashing and sleep deprivation and shaved head.
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  All Jim Jones control and you know it all and you're the tough guys and you've got it all figured out.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  Meanwhile, I'm reading the military saying you're going to come and force me into Iraq by 2025.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  Yes, wires into my head.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  Put me into Iraq.
[15:42.000 --> 15:48.000]  And that's what all the top futurists say in the Warwick professor and the heads of all of it.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  And I told the story on local radio today. I'll just tell it again briefly.
[15:51.000 --> 15:58.000]  I've mentioned it, but I remember being about 10 years old and my dad, you know, was a local dentist on the dental office and he comes in.
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  We're having dinner and he says to my mom, he says, Carol, there's a secret government program.
[16:03.000 --> 16:17.000]  You know, I was taught in my class and taught my class in dental school, but they're recruiting a lot of area dentist that have, you know, experience with grafting and with implants, you know, new teeth implants.
[16:17.000 --> 16:30.000]  And with oral surgery and they wouldn't, you know, I'm not allowed to assign on the program to even learn more, but we get a lot more money and we'd moved to Maryland and to be a secret program.
[16:30.000 --> 16:40.000]  And it's all they told me is it's huge and I know it must be big because there's a bunch of other dentists here in Dallas who they're recruiting right now for a secret program in cybernetics.
[16:40.000 --> 16:52.000]  And I was like, what cybernetics dad? And I was like, I don't know, 1011, the first terminator just come out and he said, remember when we were in the hotel a few months ago down in Austin visiting your grandmother, I still remember this.
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.000]  And he goes, remember, watch them that show Terminator. It was on HBO. Well, that's kind of what it's like.
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  But he said they won't let me know all those details unless I sign on to the program.
[17:01.000 --> 17:10.000]  My mom's like, I don't want to leave Texas. And he's like, well, it's, you know, it's hundreds of thousands dollars more than I'm making a year now. And this dental practice was struggling.
[17:10.000 --> 17:21.000]  And, you know, the IRS had just taken some of his money and stuff like that was happening. And, and I remember when they, I remember them having discussions in the car driving to church about, well, should I join the government program?
[17:21.000 --> 17:33.000]  That was 24 years ago. I was 10 or 11, 24, 25 years ago. Text Mars is, of course, a professor of space and aeronautics written government textbooks on robotics, pretty smart guy.
[17:33.000 --> 17:41.000]  And he remembers 30 years ago when he was a professor, guys he knew at UT, leaving for secret nanotech programs and cyborg programs.
[17:41.000 --> 17:50.000]  We've had him on. See, when you're in academia or an or a physician, you'll hear that and dentists are perfect because they work with bone cartilage interfaces.
[17:50.000 --> 17:58.000]  And that's why they mainly wanted dentists. Lord knows what they're doing with the troops, but I'm, I'm told from certain sources that it is extremely grizzly.
[17:58.000 --> 18:08.000]  And they've also developed, obviously, humanoid clones. Yes, folks, in 1998, they admitted they were growing humans in utero of cows that were part cows.
[18:08.000 --> 18:19.000]  They wouldn't ever get rejection just for organ harvesting. Again, you don't get women to carry babies generally and then let them, you know, you take their heart and liver and things out and body parts and sanguate their juices for different programs.
[18:19.000 --> 18:28.000]  But this is all going on. And I'm sorry, my dad did sit at the dinner table and he did almost go for a human cyborg program with the government.
[18:28.000 --> 18:38.000]  Okay. I mean, to go do this stuff is one of their mad scientist technicians and they were getting my dad's, I don't remember the exact number, but he said lots of Dallas dentist, the cream of the crop.
[18:38.000 --> 18:53.000]  They were just scooping up and imagine every major city just scooping up this dentist. I mean, a huge project, huge project where you need thousands of dentists.
[18:53.000 --> 19:01.000]  I mean, I'm guessing at the number, if he said he had colleagues, they approached other people in Dallas, he knew that we're going to do it and other all surgeons. I don't know.
[19:01.000 --> 19:11.000]  But see, this is the real class. This is the real government. Lord knows what's really going on in there. Who knows what's really happening in there.
[19:11.000 --> 19:20.000]  And so see, it's not about sucking your thumb and acting tough and driving your vet around with your Marine Quartets and walking into the base and you got the security clearance.
[19:20.000 --> 19:31.000]  You get on the keyboard and fight American Alcada, Alex Jones, because that nuts is are going to put chips in us. They're going to put them in your brains, you little dummies.
[19:31.000 --> 19:38.000]  And through peer pressure, you're going to do it. And they're going to remote control you to run around the streets, having your way with us.
[19:38.000 --> 19:53.000]  I got a bunch of news I'm going to cover first. Then your phone calls at 1-800-2599-231. We'll get right back.

[20:53.000 --> 20:59.000]  Our beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[20:59.000 --> 21:04.000]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[21:04.000 --> 21:10.000]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.000]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[21:53.000 --> 22:00.000]  Gold. It's like nothing else on earth. From the Romans through the Renaissance. From the industrial age to the space age.
[22:00.000 --> 22:06.000]  Gold has weathered the test of time. For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[22:06.000 --> 22:18.000]  According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint, demand is at an all time high. The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[23:50.000 --> 24:08.000]  I was a highway man along the coach roads I did ride with sword and pistol by my side.
[24:08.000 --> 24:22.000]  Got a big yes joining us next week. Many a young maid lost her bobbles to my tree. Many a soldier. Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
[24:22.000 --> 24:34.000]  The Masters hung me in the spring of 25 but I am still alive.
[24:34.000 --> 24:52.000]  I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide. With the sea I did abide. I sailed a schooner. I sailed a schooner around the Horn of Mexico.
[24:52.000 --> 25:10.000]  I went off the furlough the mains a little close. And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed. But I'm living still.
[25:10.000 --> 25:26.000]  I was a damn builder across the river deep and wild. We're still in wild.
[25:26.000 --> 25:40.000]  I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below. They buried me in that great hill that knows no sand. But I'm still alive.
[25:40.000 --> 25:56.000]  We owe it all to them, the explorers, the trailblazers, the rebels, the renegades, the fighters, the real men and the strong women that supported them.
[25:56.000 --> 26:14.000]  I fly a starship across the universe divide. And when I reach the other side, the trailblazers, I'll find a place to rest my spirit in like the past, present and future.
[26:14.000 --> 26:24.000]  Perhaps I may become a highwayman again. Or I may simply be a single drop of rain.
[26:24.000 --> 26:36.000]  But I will remain. I'll be back again, and again, and again, and again.
[26:36.000 --> 26:44.000]  You only live once all you shit-com fools. Deep in your gut, you know you're on the wrong team.
[26:44.000 --> 26:54.000]  There's a Muslim boogeyman they dangle in front of your eyes all day and that you think you're cutting the rules, breaking the rules, doing all this to protect the U.S.
[26:54.000 --> 27:04.000]  But look at your bosses, get rid of our dollar, get rid of our sovereignty, get rid of our borders, get rid of our good name while they fund your little Muslim cullies, go out there and carry out some of the real terror attacks,
[27:04.000 --> 27:16.000]  the low intensity conflict on the ground level so you can spook the nation of cowards that we've become here and going along with your corporate bosses.
[27:16.000 --> 27:30.000]  I mean, the news I've got here in front of me while I was talking about microchips, soldiers can be prosecuted for thought crime and it says the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is funding a number of technologies
[27:30.000 --> 27:36.000]  that have been in the brain ability to detect threats before the conscious mind is able to process the information.
[27:36.000 --> 27:44.000]  Already, there's a Pentagon-sponsored work on using the brain pattern directed capabilities for enhanced goggles and superfast satellite imagery analysis.
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  What happens, however, when the Pentagon ultimately uses advanced capability for targeting weapons?
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.000]  And then it goes on, but if you read the actual report that they're eight years late reporting on, the very reports,
[27:56.000 --> 28:08.000]  they tell you the five-year, the 10-year, the 20-year strategic plan and it says that it ends with the government inserting us all into racks in the wall.
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.000]  And they're already implanting the finder pilots in some of the research labs.
[28:13.000 --> 28:21.000]  This has been confirmed and even leaked out mainstream news with brain chips that hook into the optic nerve.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  And that's just how it is.
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  The general on pilot, well, you've got to have the enhancement and then you're part of that elite class.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  Oh, I've got it all.
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  But for the general public, it's going to be, again, they've done tests with monkeys, they've done tests with pigeons,
[28:35.000 --> 28:42.000]  they've done tests with rats, they've done tests with pigs, they've done tests with horses and they put them in stalls,
[28:42.000 --> 28:49.000]  put them in cages, put them in containers and they have a button that they teach them how to push, they show them how to push.
[28:49.000 --> 28:57.000]  And they push that button, an implant in their brain 60 years ago when they first admitted they were doing it, 60 years ago in the 50s.
[28:57.000 --> 29:09.000]  They would have a wire going into the brain and it was into the Pleasure Center and the monkey, the rat, would just sit there punching and punching and punching for three, four days
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.000]  and then they'd be laying there on their side a week later.
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  There'd be a huge pool of urine and feces around them.
[29:16.000 --> 29:23.000]  It's going to be gross here, I've seen photos of it, research labs and they just punching, punching, clicking, clicking, clicking, clicking.
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  Well, it's much more complex than that.
[29:25.000 --> 29:34.000]  When the general public finds out that they can go, say, have sex with every favorite movie star they've got and that it's real for all intents and purposes,
[29:34.000 --> 29:35.000]  it's over.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  Stack and rack me, it's over.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  New World Order wins, total control.
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  What do I call that?
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  I call it Flat Out Satanic.
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  We're on the march.
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  The Empire's on the run.

[30:56.000 --> 30:58.000]  A New World Order.
[30:58.000 --> 31:03.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[31:06.000 --> 31:09.000]  What their objective would be world domination?
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[31:12.000 --> 31:15.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[31:15.000 --> 31:20.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[31:22.000 --> 31:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[31:32.000 --> 31:35.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  They're after power.

[31:51.000 --> 31:53.000]  You have been warned.
[31:53.000 --> 31:57.000]  According to the EPA, our indoor air is many times more polluted than outdoor air.
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  One child in 10 suffers from asthma.
[31:59.000 --> 32:01.000]  How can we improve the air we breathe?
[32:01.000 --> 32:02.000]  The answer is clear.

[32:55.000 --> 32:57.000]  Now speaking of gas for your car.
[32:57.000 --> 33:00.000]  Well, you know, gas is gas anywhere you get it.
[33:00.000 --> 33:05.000]  What you're looking for is quick service and all those little extras that go with it.

[33:10.000 --> 33:36.000]  Go ahead good buddy, let a man on it.
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  He dragged me off to the old town square.
[33:40.000 --> 33:43.000]  The justice of the peace are waiting for his share.
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  He didn't look at here boy, you better slow down.
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  In a heap of trouble in this one old town.
[33:49.000 --> 33:52.000]  So look out stranger, you're heading for danger.
[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  There's a welcome sign ahead.
[33:55.000 --> 34:02.000]  I've got to go and drag them off the interstate socket to them JP Blues.

[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  A kangaroo court is the last resort on a low down, shakedown cruise.
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  Got them, drag them off the interstate socket to them JP Blues.
[34:19.000 --> 34:22.000]  You better pray to me and you better let my boots.
[34:22.000 --> 34:25.000]  I'm an officer and you're a lonely civilian.
[34:25.000 --> 34:26.000]  Go ahead.
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  The woman getting mugged in the heart of town.
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  Yells for the cops but there's none to wrap.
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  The down on the interstate is setting the trap.
[34:35.000 --> 34:38.000]  A huntin' for a live one to skin and wrap.
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.000]  So look out stranger, you're heading for danger.
[34:41.000 --> 34:44.000]  There's a welcome sign ahead.
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.000]  When a sign says welcome to God's country.
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  You got competition from a slick JP.
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  Fuzzy old buzzards are fillin' their cross
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.000]  with highway robbery in the name of the law.
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  So look out stranger, you're heading for danger.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  There's a welcome sign ahead.
[35:02.000 --> 35:09.000]  I've got those, drag them off the interstate socket to them JP Blues.
[35:09.000 --> 35:15.000]  Yeah, welcome in the evening and sock them when they're leaving Blues.
[35:15.000 --> 35:21.000]  A kangaroo court is the last resort on a low down, shakedown cruise.
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.000]  Got them, drag them off the interstate socket to them JP Blues.
[35:27.000 --> 35:35.000]  Got them, drag them off the interstate socket to them JP Blues.
[35:35.000 --> 35:36.000]  Yeah, here they come.
[35:36.000 --> 35:37.000]  Lick them, lick the boot.
[35:37.000 --> 35:38.000]  Here, here.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  Now I want you to lick them that way.
[35:41.000 --> 35:42.000]  Lick them this way.
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.000]  You learn, you scum, you civilian trash.
[35:46.000 --> 35:51.000]  Yeah, that's a Dick Curlis remix with a little bit of me online.
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  You know, I had heard Dick Curlis when I was a little kid driving along with some of the old country bumpkins.
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  I'd be riding along with, taking me to my deer stand when I was a kid.
[35:59.000 --> 36:04.000]  And I remember hearing Frank, Dick Curlis and some of the other guys.
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.000]  And boy, I was on YouTube late last night watching different videos with Dick Curlis.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  That is some good country music there, good buddy.
[36:12.000 --> 36:17.000]  Ain't no good buddy there. It's got the kind of service you need, all the little extras.
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.000]  It's got police beating citizens up and throwing people out of wheelchairs.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  It's the music video they put together.
[36:23.000 --> 36:31.000]  I mean, it's so horrible when they threw that quadriplegic out of the wheelchair and broke one of his legs for no reason.
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  They defended it.
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.000]  You think you're going to keep being able to sell that to the public?
[36:36.000 --> 36:42.000]  I mean, you really think that that much of our common sense has been driven from us that we don't understand it?
[36:42.000 --> 36:48.000]  These poor cops trained by the system to be power mad, out of control individuals, some of them.
[36:48.000 --> 36:56.000]  And they have no idea that they're in the grasp of a scientific dictatorship that's attacking them every single day and every single way.
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.000]  Okay, look, I'll just take some calls now at 1-800-25 at 99231.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  And then I'm going to run through more of the news.
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  And believe me, it's all crazy.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  It is all out of control.
[37:07.000 --> 37:15.000]  And I'm going to have Burma's popping here with us in about an hour to talk about our friends over at loveloosechange.com.
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  That's actually screw loose change.
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  But yeah, we're getting our chips.
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  But you know, who raw?
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  You guys are traders.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  Oh, man.
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.000]  But they now say we're crazy not to want our chips.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  They didn't exist before, but now we're crazy not to want them.
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  I mean, who doesn't want one?
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  It helps our troops.
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.000]  If you're against the chips, now you're against the troops and against victory.
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  Burma's, why are you against red, white, and blue?
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  Why do you hate America?
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.000]  Yeah, you hate America.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  Hey, did you get up early this morning?
[37:46.000 --> 37:52.000]  Did you say last night that the crazy no-planers were definitely on Howard Stern's show?
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  Last night, it was on the Stern's website that the no-planers were in studio.
[37:56.000 --> 37:57.000]  Did that happen?
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.000]  I'm not sure.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  I know Paula Gloria was definitely on the bill.
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  I would try to listen to the replay this morning, but it's a five-hour show, but I'm looking into it.
[38:04.000 --> 38:05.000]  I'm sure you are.
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  Yeah, I'll know.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  See, it's sick and funny at one level, but it's not at the other.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  I'm pretty upset about it.
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  I'm not, you know.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  But Pentagon's going to do what they're going to do, folks.
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  And there's no doubt that crew of people, I mean, it's street acting.
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  Running around with Hitler and Mustaches, attacking people, going,
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  with news crews that always show up right when they're there.
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.000]  And just doing all sorts of street theater, imitating, waterboarding,
[38:30.000 --> 38:36.000]  and shang that, you know, we carried out the attack on the Army recruiting facility.
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  I mean, it's black propaganda.
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.000]  They're going to put them all over TV, all over everything else doing that.
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  And sick parts of our movement are going to say, well, we need to listen to this.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  We need to go along with this.
[38:48.000 --> 38:49.000]  But it's all an act.
[38:49.000 --> 38:50.000]  They're not crazy.
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.000]  They're actually pretty good actors.
[38:51.000 --> 38:57.000]  And that's just, I mean, did you think the New World Order wasn't going to try stuff,
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  wasn't going to do that?
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  Black propaganda is their favorite.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  And I see this as a great victory.
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  The fact that the Pentagon's putting out reports saying 9-11 Truthers worked for
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  Ahmed Dinajid and Iran.
[39:09.000 --> 39:15.000]  And that, I mean, that's just laughable that we're putting that out on the payroll
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  of Ahmed Dinajid.
[39:16.000 --> 39:23.000]  And then, conversely, that we believe that cartoon images hit the towers and that no
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  one really saw planes at it.
[39:25.000 --> 39:30.000]  And that it was CG'd into the blue sky.
[39:30.000 --> 39:36.000]  I mean, that only shows inquiring, intelligent, discerning minds just how real all of this
[39:36.000 --> 39:37.000]  is.
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  And so I'm actually quite pleased by it.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  Look, Humpty Dumpty, Southern Wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.000]  All the king's horses and all the king's sent com propaganda men and all their street
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.000]  actors running around in Hitler mustaches to get attention, couldn't put it back together
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.000]  again.
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  Okay, it's over.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  It's been declassified too much.
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.000]  The government admits they've carried out a bunch of other attacks.
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.000]  And see, we're not going to get into space beams and play the game that Bush administration
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.000]  officials who come out for 9-11 Truth do to discredit everything.
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  We're going to go, hey, did the government stage the attack on the liberty with Israel?
[40:13.000 --> 40:14.000]  Declasified.
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  Did they stage the Gulf of Tonkin attack to get us into Vietnam?
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  Yep, declassified.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  Is Northwoods declassified to stage attacks?
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.000]  Yes.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  Did they stage attacks in Iran to overthrow Mosaic?
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  Yes.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  Did they stage all these other attacks under Operation Cyclone?
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  Yes.
[40:27.000 --> 40:33.000]  Did they stage all these other attacks under the NATO option and under Gladio?
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.000]  Yes.
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  Is that admitted in the CIA fact book?
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  Is that even on the government's website?
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  Yes.
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  Okay, done.
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  Who has the motive?
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  Joe Kahn's right memo saying they needed terror attacks.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  Did Gary Hart, CFR top strategist for Homeland Security write a letter to Akhmed Diniji saying
[40:49.000 --> 40:50.000]  we stage the attacks.
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  You better watch it.
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.000]  Better do what we say.
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  We'll stage more.
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  Did we go interview him?
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  And did he admit, yes, that's what I said and what I meant?
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.000]  Yes.
[40:57.000 --> 40:58.000]  Done.
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  It's over for you, sitcom.
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.000]  And I bet you're scared because a lot of you figured out your masters carried out the
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  attacks.
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  But in closed door discussions, it's kind of like, well, we had to do it.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  It's a military sacrifice.
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  It's so dangerous and to defend America, we had to kill 3,000 to get the resolve of the
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  country up to go quote, fight the greater threat.
[41:16.000 --> 41:21.000]  You know, that's what, you know, we've now gone to West Point Military Training School.
[41:21.000 --> 41:27.000]  We learned about necessary pawns sacrifice and how a commander will put a platoon in,
[41:27.000 --> 41:35.000]  division in, you know, from 20, 30 people to 10,000 people because, you know, you've
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  got to lure the enemy in and then have a decisive victory.
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.000]  Because if you didn't do that, you'd end up losing 10 times as many men.
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  And so that's why we did 9-11.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  You guys are still traders and we're going to deal with you.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  You're not going to deal with anybody.
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.000]  You're going to fail.
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  You understand?
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  It's disgusting what you did.
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  It's degenerate what you did.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  Even if you were for the United States and even if this really was to get us to face a
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.000]  real threat, it would be a moral, totally evil and wicked to do something incredibly evil
[42:02.000 --> 42:03.000]  in the name of good.
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.000]  By the way, that's their motto.
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  That's how they sell the youngins to get into it.
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.000]  Later they find out, no, it's for evil and power's sake.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  But it wasn't to defend America.
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  It wasn't a staged event to meet a real threat as you were taught.
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.000]  It was so that the globalists could destroy America and dismantle our freedoms and liberties
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  and sell us off in pieces to the multinational corporations.
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  That's what happened.
[42:25.000 --> 42:30.000]  You think you've gotten some high level of knowledge and some dark truth that you're
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  guarding the goodness with great evil and the bodyguard of lies and I'm weak-minded
[42:35.000 --> 42:40.000]  and we just can't face the strength you did and how you planted those bombs and how you
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.000]  did it as team members for America.
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  But now quite a few of your team members have committed suicide or died in weird car racks
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  and you know they're killing you.
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  You know they're killing your men now, aren't they?
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  Yeah.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  In fact, you're even scared to tune in on the web and listen to this show because you
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  know it's all surveilled.
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  Now you realize and you weren't on the winning team, were you?
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.000]  No, you're not.
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  Disgusting.
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.000]  You can still ask God to forgive you and I think even though you planted the bombs in
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  the towers, God will forgive you.
[43:12.000 --> 43:15.000]  If you repent but your leaders have hardened their hearts, they're not going to.
[43:15.000 --> 43:21.000]  The guys that pulled your strings, you know, they've got the will to do things.
[43:21.000 --> 43:26.000]  We have the will to cut off the finger to save the body.
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.000]  We have the will to cut off the foot to save the leg.
[43:29.000 --> 43:36.000]  And the weak minds like Alex Jones, we just can't fathom the tough decisions you've made
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  for this country.
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.000]  This country is already gone, you idiot.
[43:43.000 --> 43:47.000]  I just popped over the old state line.
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.000]  I was focused on a welcome sign.
[43:50.000 --> 43:56.000]  When air in the bushes awaiting for me was a big policeman with a capital P.
[43:56.000 --> 43:58.000]  Look out, stranger.
[43:58.000 --> 43:59.000]  You're headed for danger.
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.000]  There's a welcome sign ahead.
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  Ha-ha!
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  When the sign says welcome to God's country, you better look out.
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  They got a mean JP.
[44:10.000 --> 44:17.000]  Fuzzy old buzzards stuffing their craw on highway robbery in the name of the law.
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.000]  I just feel like going fishing, man.
[44:20.000 --> 44:21.000]  Big cold front blew in.
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  It's about 65 degrees outside.
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  I like these overcast days.
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  I want to go walk through the forest.
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.000]  Instead of sit here fighting with you scent com idiots all day.
[44:32.000 --> 44:33.000]  Oh, God.
[44:33.000 --> 44:34.000]  Your whole family's future.
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  You're flushing down the toilet.
[44:36.000 --> 44:37.000]  But you're in control.
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  You're part of the command structure.
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  You know it all.
[44:43.000 --> 44:44.000]  All right.
[44:44.000 --> 44:45.000]  Let's just go to your calls.
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.000]  I'm going to go to you quick here.
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.000]  Jim and Mass, go ahead.
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  Hi, Alex.
[44:48.000 --> 44:49.000]  Thanks for taking my call.
[44:49.000 --> 44:50.000]  I appreciate it.
[44:50.000 --> 44:51.000]  Good to hear from you.
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.000]  The reason why I'm calling is two-fold.
[44:54.000 --> 45:00.000]  First, a couple of weeks ago, you had talked about the police chief in Springfield, Mass,
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  wanting to have his officers dressed in black.
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  Yeah, that was in the Associated Press.
[45:04.000 --> 45:05.000]  He said for intimidation.
[45:05.000 --> 45:06.000]  Right.
[45:06.000 --> 45:11.000]  Well, I live in Central Mass outside of the second largest city in Massachusetts, which
[45:11.000 --> 45:12.000]  is Worcester.
[45:12.000 --> 45:17.000]  And the suburban cops have been dressing in black here for the last two years.
[45:17.000 --> 45:23.000]  It started with the canine cops, and then it now migrated into the cruiser police officer.
[45:23.000 --> 45:26.000]  Well, you know, we have the federal grants, why they do that.
[45:26.000 --> 45:27.000]  Right.
[45:27.000 --> 45:28.000]  You know why they do that.
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.000]  The federal grant says it is to project authority, i.e. intimidate people as they admit, but
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.000]  also so that you don't recognize who they are.
[45:36.000 --> 45:42.000]  And it's going from a respectable suit of a guardian with, you know, the epaulets and
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.740]  the rest of it, to a monkey suit, a goon suit with a black baseball cap, so they can mix
[45:47.740 --> 45:50.000]  them in with felons and foreigners and military.
[45:50.000 --> 45:51.000]  Right.
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  I'm going to try to get it on my flip camcorder for you and send it over to y'all.
[45:55.000 --> 45:56.000]  I mean, are you kidding?
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  I mean, I see the cops everywhere.
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.000]  They're dressed like that.
[45:59.000 --> 46:00.000]  Yeah, it's unbelievable.
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.500]  You know, and I actually asked one because he was at the veterinarian with his German
[46:04.500 --> 46:10.640]  shepherd and I was there with my dog and I said, what's with all the camos in the black
[46:10.640 --> 46:12.000]  marine uniforms and everything?
[46:12.000 --> 46:16.520]  And he says, well, you know, police officers are paramilitary anyways.
[46:16.520 --> 46:20.840]  And I'm like, yeah, to a certain extent, I thought more or less the state police are
[46:20.840 --> 46:21.840]  like that.
[46:21.840 --> 46:25.000]  He said, oh, no, the locals were, you know, we're being indoctrinated with that too.
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  And I had a little conversation with him.
[46:27.000 --> 46:28.000]  It was just, you know, very surprising.
[46:28.000 --> 46:29.000]  That's good.
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  They're going to take his mama's bank account just as much as they're going to take my mama's.
[46:32.000 --> 46:33.600]  He gets to be part of what he delivers.
[46:33.600 --> 46:34.600]  Yeah.
[46:34.600 --> 46:39.320]  Now, the second point is, is we're homeschoolers and we're part of a homeschooling group here.
[46:39.320 --> 46:44.240]  And we had one of our families go into the local library a couple weeks ago, like they
[46:44.240 --> 46:45.880]  normally do.
[46:45.880 --> 46:51.760]  And about three days ago, she had a warrant served on her by the local police.
[46:51.760 --> 46:56.840]  Four cruisers went flying up into her driveway and they executed a search warrant.
[46:56.840 --> 46:58.320]  And she said, well, what's this all about?
[46:58.320 --> 47:02.480]  And he said, well, you know, you stole some books from the library and come to find out
[47:02.480 --> 47:07.360]  her 13-year-old son thought his mother had checked them out and put them in the bookbag.
[47:07.360 --> 47:10.600]  And she says, well, you know, it was just an honest mistake.
[47:10.600 --> 47:14.680]  He arrested her for a felony over $250 for larceny.
[47:14.680 --> 47:20.400]  She's facing five years in prison, but the thing was is the woman's got a medical condition
[47:20.400 --> 47:23.480]  and he had her cuffed and she has to use, you know, the bathroom because you're not
[47:23.480 --> 47:24.480]  using no bathroom.
[47:24.480 --> 47:27.760]  And he said, oh yeah, you look like you're a Christian here too.
[47:27.760 --> 47:30.640]  It's nice things that you're passing on to your kids.
[47:30.640 --> 47:34.000]  You know, we know about you homeschoolers and we're going to do everything in our power
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  to make sure that we pass a law.
[47:36.000 --> 47:37.720]  Have her, have her contact me.
[47:37.720 --> 47:39.000]  I look, this is what happens.
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.320]  You have the communists that work at the library.
[47:41.320 --> 47:42.760]  They really hate homeschoolers.
[47:42.760 --> 47:46.240]  They think they're being, you know, not being given their, you know, their enlightenment
[47:46.240 --> 47:50.160]  in the public school learning how to use Ritalin, Prozac, cocaine, heroin, and listen to gang
[47:50.160 --> 47:51.440]  bang music.
[47:51.440 --> 47:53.080]  And so they spy on them.
[47:53.080 --> 47:57.000]  Listen, this has been happening in Round Rock in Williamson County for a long time.
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.920]  Your video that you leave under your seat of your car, you forget and they call and,
[48:00.920 --> 48:04.880]  you know, the kids got the fluce, you don't, you know, return the blockbuster video within
[48:04.880 --> 48:05.880]  two days.
[48:05.880 --> 48:09.120]  And this has been in the paper, the police come and arrest you and they charge you for
[48:09.120 --> 48:11.040]  stealing the video.
[48:11.040 --> 48:14.960]  And the video that the company's buying for like 50, 60 bucks a piece is a rental because
[48:14.960 --> 48:16.960]  they, you know, they have to pay more for that because they're going to run it out a
[48:16.960 --> 48:20.760]  bunch and they'll charge you with the, you know, all sorts of missed, you know, serious
[48:20.760 --> 48:22.720]  misdemeanors and things over that.
[48:22.720 --> 48:24.300]  And that's happening everywhere.
[48:24.300 --> 48:27.640]  So give me that lady's name, email it to Aaron and Trey.
[48:27.640 --> 48:28.640]  Give me your name and number.
[48:28.640 --> 48:29.640]  I'd like to have her on.
[48:29.640 --> 48:30.640]  Okay.
[48:30.640 --> 48:31.640]  Great.
[48:31.640 --> 48:32.640]  Thanks, Alex.
[48:32.640 --> 48:33.640]  You bet.
[48:33.640 --> 48:34.640]  Tell the story though.
[48:34.640 --> 48:35.640]  So Trey knows what he's reading when he sees it.
[48:35.640 --> 48:38.640]  Trey at mfoldwars.com, Aaron at mfoldwars.com, Trey with an E, Aaron with two A's.
[48:38.640 --> 48:45.080]  Yeah, that brings me, I've got news here where if you go over the speeding limit in Florida,
[48:45.080 --> 48:51.080]  you'll get five to 10 years in jail now that they passed that law.
[48:51.080 --> 48:56.560]  And all over the country, especially in Texas, we have more prisons than any other, you know,
[48:56.560 --> 49:00.520]  per square mile anywhere in the world in Texas.
[49:00.520 --> 49:05.200]  And they, they lobby, you can just Google it, private prisons, lobby for tougher laws.
[49:05.200 --> 49:09.800]  And it'll come up a bunch of stories and news reports saying it's how wonderful it is.
[49:09.800 --> 49:10.800]  And they go lobby.
[49:10.800 --> 49:13.120]  They say, we want minor infractions, hard jail time.
[49:13.120 --> 49:14.120]  And they say, absolutely.
[49:14.120 --> 49:16.560]  And that's how it works.
[49:16.560 --> 49:21.040]  Look when you go from 300,000 cops to 2 million cops, and then now they're going to have to
[49:21.040 --> 49:25.760]  have 2 million environmental enforcers, and they got, what is it, like 5 million CPS workers
[49:25.760 --> 49:30.520]  or something, or total social workers, I mean, the numbers are just off the charts.
[49:30.520 --> 49:32.120]  They're just everywhere.
[49:32.120 --> 49:35.280]  And they're going to find something to do.
[49:35.280 --> 49:37.960]  You know, you're going to get months in jail for a banana peel.
[49:37.960 --> 49:41.080]  You're going to get years in jail for a double A battery in your backyard.
[49:41.080 --> 49:45.120]  Your kid dropped out of a toy, but that's already happens while I'm saying that.
[49:45.120 --> 49:50.600]  And it's not, in fact, I have the mainstream news articles here today where all of this
[49:50.600 --> 49:56.400]  is happening, and I have told my wife to not go to the library anymore.
[49:56.400 --> 49:59.960]  And she likes to go, and the kids like it, and they'll get like 20 books, and then we've
[49:59.960 --> 50:01.460]  got hundreds of books.
[50:01.460 --> 50:04.120]  We probably got 500 children's books we've bought.
[50:04.120 --> 50:07.600]  And then hundreds of them, my parents gave me and others, just piles of them.
[50:07.600 --> 50:09.560]  The kids read all the time.
[50:09.560 --> 50:14.680]  And I told my wife, I've said, do not go to the library anymore, because we get these
[50:14.680 --> 50:19.680]  library notices, probably about to get swat teamed over this admitting this, but, and
[50:19.680 --> 50:20.760]  you know, she's got to pay bills.
[50:20.760 --> 50:21.760]  She can't find it.
[50:21.760 --> 50:25.320]  So she's got to mail in 100 bucks, because she can't find the little book that they
[50:25.320 --> 50:29.160]  claims 100 bucks, you know, as they got these fines.
[50:29.160 --> 50:32.360]  And I said, listen, they're going to come here and arrest us.
[50:32.360 --> 50:33.360]  Okay.
[50:33.360 --> 50:35.360]  No more library.
[50:35.360 --> 50:36.360]  Okay.
[50:36.360 --> 50:37.860]  No more.
[50:37.860 --> 50:38.860]  No more.
[50:38.860 --> 50:41.080]  Now, not every area does it.
[50:41.080 --> 50:44.600]  Austin, that I know doesn't come arrest you yet, but I don't take it for granted.
[50:44.600 --> 50:47.880]  I just do not go to the library.
[50:47.880 --> 50:54.320]  And I always get a receipt when I pump gas, because they'll swat team you for that terror
[50:54.320 --> 50:59.440]  storm, a history of government sponsored terror, loose change, final cut, end game blueprint

[52:33.040 --> 52:39.680]  what is said, what yada, yada means, or how it came to be in our society and vocabulary.
[52:39.680 --> 52:42.760]  Yada, yada, yada.

[52:48.080 --> 52:52.560]  And since we are talking dirty talk, let's talk about the word people refer to as the
[52:52.560 --> 52:54.200]  F word.
[52:54.200 --> 53:01.440]  Most do not know the origin of that word either and the true original meaning of it.
[53:01.440 --> 53:06.360]  And what does that word have to do with the word yada, yada?
[53:06.360 --> 53:13.040]  Oh, it's quite a story that's not being told as everyone uses these dirty words, but we

[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[53:57.000 --> 54:00.000]  Why don't you drill it through?
[54:00.000 --> 54:22.000]  Yeah, try Woman Arrested for Unreturned Library Bucks and it's always the same, the person
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.480]  checked out hundreds and you can find a bunch of stories on Google and then they forget
[54:26.480 --> 54:30.760]  one or they lose one or more often than not, they turn in and somebody doesn't file it
[54:30.760 --> 54:31.760]  right.
[54:31.760 --> 54:34.920]  It's not the librarians that are doing this, the police are just sitting around waiting
[54:34.920 --> 54:39.320]  with their attack dogs and the rest of it, just wanting something, just, oh, give us
[54:39.320 --> 54:48.400]  something, oh, man, oh, and you had to look at you homeschooling trash.
[54:48.400 --> 54:51.760]  We're going to get you, you're against the state, and they got them, they got these
[54:51.760 --> 54:54.560]  mental patients, psychopaths everywhere.
[54:54.560 --> 54:58.480]  All over the country the feds are doing drills and they've had this in Austin where I-35
[54:58.480 --> 55:03.360]  gets shut down to some vet, sees a box on the street and has a flashback and they run
[55:03.360 --> 55:07.320]  up to the box and always act like it's real and freak out because they got to give their
[55:07.320 --> 55:12.560]  guys in black uniforms something to do, to freak out about and fear monger about.
[55:12.560 --> 55:17.320]  Just a nation of total cowardice, but again, they always treat it as real so that they
[55:17.320 --> 55:22.760]  can get everybody to keep reporting it and the local report of the local Austin robot
[55:22.760 --> 55:28.240]  blew up a cardboard box by a trash can in downtown and then everybody goes, oh, terrorists,
[55:28.240 --> 55:32.280]  oh, they're keeping me safe from them.
[55:32.280 --> 55:37.720]  Yeah, resting you two days after your blockbuster video has not turned in.
[55:37.720 --> 55:45.440]  I've seen that in the news in Williamson County and I know somebody had happened to.
[55:45.440 --> 55:49.000]  And when they say to the cops, they say, what, what do you mean it's just a few days late
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.280]  and they're like, shut up, you criminal, you know what you've done.
[55:52.280 --> 55:56.600]  Oh, it's so sick.
[55:56.600 --> 55:57.600]  Let's talk to Steven Illinois.
[55:57.600 --> 55:59.480]  David just hung up and Tim Jay and others.
[55:59.480 --> 56:00.480]  Go ahead, Steve.
[56:00.480 --> 56:01.480]  Hi, Alex.
[56:01.480 --> 56:02.480]  Thanks for taking the time.
[56:02.480 --> 56:03.480]  Talk to me.
[56:03.480 --> 56:04.480]  Good hardcore criminal.
[56:04.480 --> 56:06.000]  You ever had a late library book?
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.080]  Yeah, many of them.
[56:08.080 --> 56:10.120]  Well, that's why I don't exactly.
[56:10.120 --> 56:13.520]  And again, I read these stories all the time where somebody pumps gas, the credit card
[56:13.520 --> 56:17.520]  goes through, but somehow then doesn't register and they don't get a receipt.
[56:17.520 --> 56:18.520]  Boom.
[56:18.520 --> 56:22.260]  They call the cops, they arrest them, beat them up, felony, life's over, doesn't matter.
[56:22.260 --> 56:26.800]  If there's even video you stick on the card in, they say, doesn't matter, should've made
[56:26.800 --> 56:27.800]  sure.
[56:27.800 --> 56:28.800]  So I always get that receipt.
[56:28.800 --> 56:32.320]  And then if it doesn't print, I go in and demand one and they always nitty and bustle
[56:32.320 --> 56:35.320]  bustle and I go, listen, you're not releasing them on me.
[56:35.320 --> 56:37.080]  You're not going to release them.
[56:37.080 --> 56:38.080]  Go ahead.
[56:38.080 --> 56:39.080]  Well, it's good to know.
[56:39.080 --> 56:40.080]  Thank you.
[56:40.080 --> 56:43.600]  I wanted to mention something to you and it might have been, my question might have been
[56:43.600 --> 56:50.120]  answered by the last caller, but I live in a suburb of Chicago and yesterday I was driving
[56:50.120 --> 56:54.600]  down the road with my kids in the car and I came across this golf course that's closed
[56:54.600 --> 57:01.400]  down and they had about five police trucks, you know, mobile command units and stuff in
[57:01.400 --> 57:03.000]  the parking lot.
[57:03.000 --> 57:08.440]  But these trucks were from a town about 30 miles away from us and there was five officers
[57:08.440 --> 57:14.200]  in the parking lot in full military, looked like full military combat gear.
[57:14.200 --> 57:17.920]  And they had a big sign out there that just said police training and process.
[57:17.920 --> 57:22.240]  Yeah, all over the country, that may have just been some regular training, but all over
[57:22.240 --> 57:28.160]  the country, it's federalization drills, it's federal mustards and the dumb cops don't
[57:28.160 --> 57:29.160]  even know that.
[57:29.160 --> 57:30.520]  They just say, it's federal program.
[57:30.520 --> 57:33.520]  We all must prepare to find Elka.
[57:33.520 --> 57:34.520]  And I'm sorry.
[57:34.520 --> 57:35.520]  No, I'm sorry.
[57:35.520 --> 57:36.520]  Go ahead.
[57:36.520 --> 57:37.520]  I was just wondering.
[57:37.520 --> 57:42.640]  I mean, because I know that, you know, I'm a first time car driver listening to your show
[57:42.640 --> 57:46.400]  for a while, you know, and I know that there was like martial law happening in certain parts
[57:46.400 --> 57:50.920]  of the country and police state and stuff, and I'm just wondering if this could be like
[57:50.920 --> 57:56.200]  training for something like that, you know, or they did camp and tournament relocation
[57:56.200 --> 57:59.520]  drills in Chicago yesterday and the day before.
[57:59.520 --> 58:09.280]  And in the stockyards in a major city, which city is that?
[58:09.280 --> 58:16.440]  They did mass processing drills at the old stockyards.
[58:16.440 --> 58:22.120]  So yes, sir, no, that was in Des Moines, Iowa.
[58:22.120 --> 58:23.560]  I've got to pull the article out.
[58:23.560 --> 58:24.560]  Sometimes my memory fails.
[58:24.560 --> 58:25.560]  That was just a couple of days ago.
[58:25.560 --> 58:26.560]  We cover that.
[58:26.560 --> 58:27.560]  Stay there.
[58:27.560 --> 58:28.560]  We'll talk more about it.
[58:28.560 --> 58:29.560]  Listen, you want to read about camps?
[58:29.560 --> 58:30.560]  It's in the Houston Chronicle.
[58:30.560 --> 58:31.880]  It's in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[58:31.880 --> 58:35.640]  It's in the government documents.
[58:35.640 --> 58:38.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:38.960 --> 58:50.680]  It is a big idea, a new world order in the near future.
[58:50.680 --> 58:56.080]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government is known as the builder bird.
[58:56.080 --> 59:02.480]  But their objective being world domination for thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:02.480 --> 59:07.480]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[59:07.480 --> 59:12.840]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:12.840 --> 59:17.880]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:17.880 --> 59:22.160]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[59:22.160 --> 59:24.840]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:24.840 --> 59:25.840]  Most people have no idea.
[59:25.840 --> 59:26.840]  They're not after money.
[59:26.840 --> 59:27.840]  They have all the money they need.
[59:27.840 --> 59:28.840]  They're after power.
[59:28.840 --> 59:29.840]  Yes, they're after music.
[59:29.840 --> 59:36.600]  Order in game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now
[59:36.600 --> 59:37.600]  at prisonplanet.tv.
[59:37.600 --> 59:38.600]  In game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[59:38.600 --> 59:39.600]  You have been warned.
[59:39.600 --> 59:58.680]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:58.680 --> 1:00:00.080]  Government cover-ups.
[1:00:00.080 --> 1:00:01.080]  You want answers?
[1:00:01.080 --> 1:00:03.080]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:03.080 --> 1:00:12.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:18.280]  I'm going through my news to see what city that was in a few days ago where they admitted
[1:00:18.280 --> 1:00:23.200]  they were doing drills for mass arrest and they've taken over the old rodeo fairground
[1:00:23.200 --> 1:00:26.400]  slash beef processing facility.
[1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:33.040]  It's all over infowars and prisonplanet, but in a 70-second break, I can't find that
[1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:37.920]  I'm going through like a stack of 200 articles here, trying to find that in-body scanners
[1:00:37.920 --> 1:00:44.160]  could warn doctors, oh, I've got, I hate to mention something like that and then not have
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:48.120]  it in front of me and my memory's failing on it, it's grabbing me up the wall, somebody
[1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:49.120]  will call in.
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:54.560]  I want to say it was in, I know it's in the Midwest, it's just driving me crazy.
[1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:58.320]  Oh, it doesn't exist, everything's fine, government's wonderful.
[1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:04.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Tim in Montana.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  You're on the air.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  Hi, Alex.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  I wanted to say hello.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  Hey, how you doing?
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  Good.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:15.920]  I'm the Ron Paul organizer up here and Jack McClam told you about that show that we had
[1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:22.160]  and we packed the studio and I got a couple of things about JFK, but first I wanted to
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:28.480]  read, it's just like a one sentence long, it has to do with something your guest said
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:34.480]  yesterday, and I know the first part talks about the eugenics, which of course we all
[1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:43.640]  agree on, and this, the final quote is, at the base of this new world order is the ideology
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:51.040]  of women's empowerment which erroneously sees the principal obstacles to a woman's fulfillment
[1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:53.760]  as a family and maternity.
[1:01:53.760 --> 1:02:00.000]  And then the fellow goes on to say at this stage of the development of the new image
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  of the new world, Christians, and not just them, but in any case, they even more than
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:09.760]  others have the duty to protest.
[1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:16.720]  And I sent you this article about an hour ago or so, and that is from a Cardinal Ratzinger
[1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:19.760]  in September 19th of 2000.
[1:02:19.760 --> 1:02:20.760]  Interesting.
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:21.760]  Yeah.
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:30.080]  So it appears that he's not only aware of what's going on, but that he's not for it.
[1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:38.200]  Now that's just, and some of the other good news is we've had a lot, we heckled Bill Clinton
[1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:40.400]  yesterday, he was here.
[1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:46.720]  We've passed out over a thousand end games in our town, and I gave one about two or three
[1:02:46.720 --> 1:02:52.320]  weeks ago to a 9-11 commission person named Bob Kerry.
[1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:58.120]  And I also gave him, I can't give away all of your videos, so I edited down a couple
[1:02:58.120 --> 1:03:05.080]  of griffins and three of yours and lay out the 20th century, and I gave him one of those
[1:03:05.080 --> 1:03:06.080]  too.
[1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:09.960]  He was not very happy at a couple of us who were asking him some tough questions.
[1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:15.280]  Well, the power of folks like you out there handing out the films, the films are, my films
[1:03:15.280 --> 1:03:19.560]  and other films, are the most effective tool, because we're a visual society, that's how
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:23.480]  people take in information, they'll sit down, they'll watch it, and it really wakes people
[1:03:23.480 --> 1:03:24.480]  up.
[1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:28.080]  It's a thousand times more effective than just talking to somebody, and talking is still
[1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:29.080]  good.
[1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:33.680]  But films are changing people's lives, and I really appreciate your call, good to hear
[1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:34.680]  from you.
[1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:36.800]  Jay in Florida, you're on the air.
[1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:38.800]  Yeah, Jones.
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:39.800]  Yes.
[1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:40.800]  How you doing there today, sir?
[1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:41.800]  Good.
[1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:42.800]  Wonderful.
[1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:44.040]  Yeah, I wish you could get outside and enjoy that weather.
[1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:51.160]  Yeah, so I just want to let everybody know out there that this is a real call.
[1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:57.760]  We don't need propaganda in our revolution, you know, just go look at alexjonesmoneybomb.com
[1:03:57.760 --> 1:04:02.040]  and you'll see we're on the move, and soon you'll be licking our boots.
[1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:07.280]  Okay, that's a first, because we had some questions about fake callers and stuff.
[1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:09.280]  So, number two, I just want to ask you something.
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:10.280]  What does that mean?
[1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:11.280]  Let me just stop you, sir.
[1:04:11.280 --> 1:04:12.280]  Okay, go ahead.
[1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:16.480]  I just want to make sure you don't stick in a prank call, and that's fine and dandy.
[1:04:16.480 --> 1:04:21.680]  But if you dislike me or whatever, and I'm sure the type that also posts that all my
[1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:25.640]  calls are screened in fake, but here you are calling in, just go ahead and make whatever
[1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:26.640]  point you want.
[1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:30.760]  Okay, my point was there's so much, you know, we've been talking about the disinformation
[1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:36.080]  in our movement that's out there, with all the videos, I guess, and all that stuff that's
[1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:41.280]  out there, and I appreciate everything you do, and I was just really wondering, there's
[1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:44.760]  one thing that I was, that I've been looking at, because I've been studying Illuminati
[1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:45.760]  tape.
[1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:46.760]  So, stay there.
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:05:15.440]  I really do appreciate, I mean, I'll come back and let you finish up.
[1:05:15.440 --> 1:05:45.280]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[1:05:45.280 --> 1:06:11.760]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:43.640]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web.

[1:06:50.760 --> 1:06:55.400]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[1:06:55.400 --> 1:07:00.240]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:01.240]  Hi, folks.
[1:07:01.240 --> 1:07:02.240]  Alex Jones here.

[1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:56.720]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's
[1:07:56.720 --> 1:07:59.600]  a war on for your mind.
[1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:03.200]  I'm glad I've expanded the radio show to four hours, because I've only gone through an hour
[1:08:03.200 --> 1:08:04.200]  and five minutes.
[1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:05.200]  I feel like I haven't covered enough yet.
[1:08:05.200 --> 1:08:09.440]  I've got so much I want to get to, I've got Jim Tucker coming in, Jason Bermas is going
[1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:13.800]  to pop in for about 10 minutes, with this crazy story of the screw loose changers admitting,
[1:08:13.800 --> 1:08:18.800]  yeah, I'm getting my microchip in the military, but so what, it's good, I love it.
[1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:23.640]  So people really going through a lot of denial there, and of course, more of your phone call
[1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:27.600]  for rocketing through those right now as fast as I can.
[1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:32.680]  Going back to Jay in Florida, okay, maybe I'm stupid, but I'm missing the points you're
[1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:36.440]  making, it sounds somewhat sarcastic, but go ahead and try to make your point.
[1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:37.960]  Okay, I'm sorry about that, Alex.
[1:08:37.960 --> 1:08:41.080]  But I was just joking around there, you know, you like to joke, I like to joke, so.
[1:08:41.080 --> 1:08:44.440]  No, I'm saying I'm stupid, I didn't get the joke, but go ahead.
[1:08:44.440 --> 1:08:49.400]  Oh, I was just, yesterday you had said that you had reports that people said that it was
[1:08:49.400 --> 1:08:53.760]  on the internet that these calls weren't real, and that, you know, it was staged or whatever,
[1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:56.720]  and I was just trying to make a point that this is not staged.
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:09:02.840]  We don't need to stage our things, because we are real, you know, and I mean, I'm part
[1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:07.640]  of the, I'm helping out on the Alex Jones Moneybomb.com, I've pledged, and I just,
[1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:13.120]  my one question for you is, I was just looking at, John Todd, have you done any research
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:14.120]  on that guy?
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:15.120]  Who is it?
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:19.720]  Um, he claims, he's from the 70s, remember back in the 70s when there was big revivals
[1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:25.040]  against rock music, and the whole Christian thing was really in a revival kind of movement,
[1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:26.040]  the mid-70s?
[1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:29.840]  I remember getting like the Peter's Brothers tapes on Backward Masking, The Evil of Rock
[1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:35.640]  and Roll, this guy says he came out of the occult, and he was a member of the Illuminati,
[1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:37.800]  and he was on the council of 13.
[1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:44.480]  You can go on YouTube and listen to all of his old tapes, and supposedly, he preached
[1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:49.360]  for a few years, his life was threatened, and then he gets caught up in something that
[1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:54.840]  lands him in jail, and they say that he was set up for driving some girl across the country,
[1:09:54.840 --> 1:09:58.920]  and the Illuminati finally got him, and the thing that's interesting about it is, if
[1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:04.120]  you listen to his stuff, he explains the Federal Reserve, the way that the Illuminati controls
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:09.520]  everything, their signs, he does go really a little bit crazy on the rock and roll aspect
[1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:10.520]  of the occult.
[1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:15.520]  Look, I just, you know, I don't know about that, and I really have found that a lot of
[1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:21.240]  those guys, I mean, there's people who pop up all the time claiming they're Illuminati,
[1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:25.520]  this, and they'll order that, and they'll show you their Mason ring, and then they put
[1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:30.400]  them on the religious circuit to go around and scare everybody, you know, I just cover
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:35.360]  the news I have in front of me of what they're doing, and I try to stick to that, and so
[1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:40.720]  I don't really spend a lot of time, you know, with those other groups and organizations
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:41.720]  that are out there, so.
[1:10:41.720 --> 1:10:46.320]  I mean, I've seen these other guys who say, you know, they're apart, this is the only
[1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:50.400]  guy that really makes me question, and I was just calling to see, because I'm trying to
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:53.880]  get to the bottom of his thing, because, you know, putting the pieces together here, which
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:56.760]  you do really well, man, and I appreciate all your films, and-
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:00.480]  Okay, well, listen, I appreciate your call, and it's good to talk to you, Jay, trying
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:06.320]  to move through these calls quick here, I'm not criticizing any individual learning group
[1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:11.640]  or any people, it's just, I can't really comment on somebody who I don't know who they are,
[1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:12.640]  okay?
[1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:16.240]  I mean, people all the time email me, and they say, you know who this person is, you haven't
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:20.320]  covered it, and you need to cover it, and I mean, there are millions of people, I don't
[1:11:20.320 --> 1:11:22.320]  know who they are.
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:27.440]  I heard some PhD guy on the radio yesterday about vaccines, who I thought was great, and
[1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:33.640]  he turns out to be pretty big, and I didn't even know who he was, so I just try to stick
[1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:42.120]  with what you can prove, what you know is real, I mean, I got a lot of criticism because
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:49.360]  I wouldn't talk about Planet X in 98, 99, 2000, 2001, 2002, and people said I was covering
[1:11:49.360 --> 1:11:53.400]  up that, you know, a lot of it is, I just, if I can't prove something, I don't cover
[1:11:53.400 --> 1:11:57.040]  it, and I just don't know about all these groups and all this stuff.
[1:11:57.040 --> 1:12:03.640]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call, let's talk to Will and Philly, you're on the
[1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:04.640]  air.
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:07.840]  Good day, sir, I love you when you're in the mood like this.
[1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:09.280]  I really do, it's great.
[1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:12.920]  The last caller I could tell, I could tell it was a, sometimes you get caught up in the
[1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:16.400]  moment, you can't, you think it's some guy pranking, but I could tell he was just, you
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:20.160]  know, he was just mirroring your sarcasm.
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:26.240]  John Todd was talking about this stuff in 1978, Allison, I believe, my, I've been looking
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:31.160]  at this stuff for about 15 years myself, and I think my discernment's on point, this guy
[1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:34.800]  was on point and suddenly he disappeared.
[1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:39.480]  But I called you to talk about, I forgot to tell you, the last couple of times we talked,
[1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:48.600]  I called Stu Bikofsky, the Jagoff from Philadelphia Daily News, and I, he says, I got it on record,
[1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:53.920]  you can go to my MySpace, I can give that out later if it's okay, but he says, he consents
[1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:57.720]  that he didn't write the headline, and that's how it is in journalism, I'm not familiar
[1:12:57.720 --> 1:12:59.360]  with that, but can you speak to that?
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:03.560]  That is the case, editors, about half the time, I mean, I'll do it.
[1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:08.680]  Okay, well at the same time, John, he said, in the article itself, now he tells me, now
[1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:13.840]  if you look at the context of the article, I never said anything like that, now I said,
[1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:17.720]  well look, I got it right here, you say, one month from the anniversary, I'm thinking
[1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:22.040]  another 9-11 would help America, he says, I said that, are you doing the internet with
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:23.040]  that?
[1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:27.920]  I said, no, I have the Daily News paper right here, if you want to hear the first conversation
[1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:32.640]  about six, seven months ago, a little after the story broke, you can go to my MySpace,
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:42.040]  myspace.com, P-A-Y-Z-E, and there's also, that's the prelude to a song that I have that
[1:13:42.040 --> 1:13:45.880]  features you, and I think you would like it very much, it's called Victims Revenge, and
[1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:51.000]  it has you cleverly, I'm a humble man, I'm my own worst critic, but I put you cleverly
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.960]  throughout the song saying things.
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:58.720]  Well, I appreciate that, but let me go back here, yeah, I interviewed that guy and tore
[1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:03.880]  him up, and they admit what they've done, they admit what they said, and he does say
[1:14:03.880 --> 1:14:07.880]  in the article that I'm thinking another 9-11 would be good, and then we have Republican
[1:14:07.880 --> 1:14:13.640]  memos and government memos saying the same thing, and PNAC saying it before it happened,
[1:14:13.640 --> 1:14:18.320]  so yeah, he just got, they're arrogance, he got caught with his pants down, and he did
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:22.560]  write articles trying to backtrack saying, that's not what I meant, you know, the editor
[1:14:22.560 --> 1:14:28.960]  said that, but then the, I'm going from memory here, but the editor then came out and said,
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:32.920]  no, that's basically what he says here in the article, and then they stood by it, so
[1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:35.720]  yeah, he's engaged in a lot of this info, good to hear from you.
[1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:39.080]  Speaking of not being able to remember, the earlier caller at the end of the last hour
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:44.800]  was asking about seeing police run around in camo and weird drills going on, and I mentioned
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:53.400]  how at a giant stockyards, fairground, that one of the largest in the country that the
[1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:58.400]  government had taken it over for a month to do drills, and then it turned out they actually
[1:14:58.400 --> 1:15:03.960]  arrested illegal aliens and did raids of whole families and put them in there, and,
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:08.560]  but Rex 84, and then current documents say that they will set the camps up in the name
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:13.040]  of illegals, get the people accepting it because, oh, well, they're getting them out of here,
[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:14.920]  and then really use it on political dissidents.
[1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:18.000]  We're seeing a lot of activity right now, it's kind of like troop movements, you know,
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.400]  I'd say I can tell them something's about to happen, well, this is similar to troop
[1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:24.400]  movements, and now, though, they've had so many big drills, they get bigger and bigger,
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:28.360]  this could be a buildup to something in the future, could be a prelude to something now,
[1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:33.280]  or in the near future, I don't know, but yeah, it was Des Moines, Iowa, I just wanted to
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:37.120]  be sure, I said Des Moines, Iowa, and then I questioned my memory on that, as predicted
[1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:41.960]  last week, ICE has begun factory raids of illegal aliens in Iowa, and we were able to predict
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:48.120]  that, Lee Rogers was, Des Moines Register and Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier reported
[1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:55.840]  that FEMA and ICE took over the National Cattle Congress fairgrounds in Waterloo, Iowa until
[1:15:55.840 --> 1:16:01.640]  May 25th, and began moving trailers and generators on the location two weeks ago, and now they,
[1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:04.880]  and then Lee Rogers accurately predicted that they were going to first arrest a bunch of
[1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:10.840]  illegal aliens as the pretext for that, but then ICE admits it's also a drill for everybody
[1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:14.920]  else, it's a mass disaster drill, so when they start mixing drills with reality, you
[1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:21.040]  better look out, and we're on record saying that, you know, a decade ago that they would
[1:16:21.040 --> 1:16:24.960]  do this first to illegal aliens, and then to citizens, and you go, well, what do you
[1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:31.800]  want, you say arrest the illegals, no, I'm saying arrest the illegals, deport them, but
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:36.280]  at the same time, the best way to do this is prosecute employers, I don't hire illegal
[1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:42.720]  aliens, myself, you know how hard it is to find a part-time nanny who's not from Latin
[1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:47.400]  America, not that I'm against a Latin American nanny, it's that they're all illegal aliens,
[1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:53.720]  do you have any idea how hard it is to get somebody to clean your house, because I have
[1:16:53.720 --> 1:16:56.640]  somebody clean my house, because I'm busy working all the time, I can either do that
[1:16:56.640 --> 1:17:00.640]  or clean my house, it comes twice a week, and I mean, it is hard, you got to pay about
[1:17:00.640 --> 1:17:06.560]  twice as much for America, but I do that, so I try to, you know, walk the walk, talk,
[1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:12.960]  you know, if you talk the talk, you walk the walk, oh man, but there it is for you and
[1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:17.000]  the headline is illegal alien raid, part of FEMA camp drill, you can just Google that
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:25.520]  and you'll find it at infoawards.com or revgovernment.com, another site out there with good info, okay,
[1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:30.640]  and then there's Chicago citizens reject terror drill, fearmongering, about 350 out of an expected
[1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:36.640]  4,000 participants in bio attack processing exercise at Sears Center arena, the latest
[1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:41.080]  opportunity for authorities to grandstand fearmonger and practice processing citizens
[1:17:41.080 --> 1:17:46.360]  through a de facto internment camp fell flat on its face yesterday when just 350 of an
[1:17:46.360 --> 1:17:52.080]  expected 4,000 turned up to participate in a mock terror drill at Chicago Sears Center
[1:17:52.080 --> 1:17:56.480]  arena, and boy, if you want to look at a picture of bedwetters, folks, this picture of this
[1:17:56.480 --> 1:18:00.920]  crowd of people, the type of nitting chicken neck that would actually hear a government
[1:18:00.920 --> 1:18:07.280]  fearmongering event and practice going to a sports stadium to be processed, it's just
[1:18:07.280 --> 1:18:14.640]  incredible, and it goes on to say an elaborate public health drill Thursday that organizers
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:19.520]  at Hope would use thousands of volunteers to help test the Chicago area's response to
[1:18:19.520 --> 1:18:25.320]  a possible bioterrorism attack, instead drew fewer than 350 people, and one beleaguered
[1:18:25.320 --> 1:18:32.280]  Cook County board president reports the Chicago Tribune, the exercise estimated to cost $80,000
[1:18:32.280 --> 1:18:35.560]  was mandated and funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is called for
[1:18:35.560 --> 1:18:40.280]  Health Department's nationwide to coordinate drills since the terrorist attacks of 9-11,
[1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:44.120]  the government mandates drills since the government attacks of 9-11, authorities practice
[1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:48.800]  processing citizens through the de facto internment camp and giving the mandatory pharmaceutical
[1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:54.360]  products injections, it goes on, Paul's excellent article on that.
[1:18:54.360 --> 1:18:58.440]  Here's the actual Chicago Tribune article, big public health drill has small turnout
[1:18:58.440 --> 1:19:03.600]  in Hoffman Estates, but stronger, but Stroger makes a guest appearance, that's the name
[1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:05.600]  of the councilman.
[1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:12.520]  Okay, I know we got a lot of other callers and we're going to get to you, 1-800-25-99231,
[1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:21.280]  but Jim Tucker popping in, did the Bilderberg group really meet last week in Greece, did
[1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:25.960]  they for 35 years finally beat us and did we miss the location, did they have it early,
[1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:31.480]  or is this an elaborate disinfo ploy, we'll get Jim Tucker's take on it, coming up in
[1:19:31.480 --> 1:19:37.440]  about 40 minutes, Burmese is going to be popping in the last 10 minutes of this hour to talk
[1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:43.920]  about the 9-11 debunkers, they're getting their microchips now, seriously, bunch of
[1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:51.160]  stupid cent gone goofs, and they're kind of having a moment of confusion over it.
[1:19:51.160 --> 1:19:55.200]  Our beloved republic is on her knees, the forces of globalism are destroying national
[1:19:55.200 --> 1:19:59.160]  sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[1:19:59.160 --> 1:20:02.800]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up, it is essential
[1:20:02.800 --> 1:20:06.920]  that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new world order
[1:20:06.920 --> 1:20:11.400]  master plan, we have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet
[1:20:11.400 --> 1:20:12.400]  this threat.
[1:20:12.400 --> 1:20:17.600]  In the info war, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom,
[1:20:17.600 --> 1:20:22.960]  prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information, all 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded
[1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:27.120]  or streamed in super high quality, directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with
[1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:28.120]  others.
[1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:32.240]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this
[1:20:32.240 --> 1:20:37.240]  online video library, my weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews
[1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:38.240]  and so much more.
[1:20:38.240 --> 1:20:44.600]  The info war is waiting for you to set it free, join prisonplanet.tv, burn the info bombs
[1:20:44.600 --> 1:20:51.200]  to disc, put them on the file sharing networks, bring down the new world order, prisonplanet.tv.
[1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:55.400]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:57.880]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[1:20:57.880 --> 1:21:02.920]  Unfortunately with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many
[1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:05.960]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:09.560]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:14.200]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[1:21:14.200 --> 1:21:17.920]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:19.240]  from Jekyll Island.
[1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:23.360]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:24.360]  power.
[1:21:24.360 --> 1:21:28.240]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[1:21:28.240 --> 1:21:29.760]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:34.480]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[1:21:34.480 --> 1:21:39.320]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[1:21:39.320 --> 1:21:42.400]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[1:21:42.400 --> 1:21:47.200]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[1:21:47.200 --> 1:21:51.200]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:55.080]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:21:55.080 --> 1:22:00.000]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:04.800]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the
[1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:05.800]  U.S.
[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:09.360]  Though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary
[1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:14.240]  responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate
[1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:16.440]  since they reside the world over.
[1:22:16.440 --> 1:22:20.840]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:22:20.840 --> 1:22:23.640]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:22:23.640 --> 1:22:27.480]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[1:22:27.480 --> 1:22:31.120]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power
[1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:36.200]  they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind,
[1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:40.400]  we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:44.080]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[1:22:44.080 --> 1:22:48.200]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them.com.
[1:22:48.200 --> 1:22:51.600]  The message of his kingdom.
[1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:55.360]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[1:22:55.360 --> 1:22:57.880]  disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[1:22:57.880 --> 1:23:01.920]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment and
[1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:03.640]  our high stress lifestyles.
[1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:07.720]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain and eventually disease.
[1:23:07.720 --> 1:23:12.240]  The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized
[1:23:12.240 --> 1:23:13.240]  water.
[1:23:13.240 --> 1:23:17.680]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science,
[1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:21.800]  the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:36.960]  ionized water.
[1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:41.280]  Let SnyderHealth.com provide the water ionizer that's right for you and your family.

[1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:59.400]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling
[1:23:59.400 --> 1:24:05.640]  oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:13.600]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard they ought not
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:14.600]  to enjoy.
[1:24:14.600 --> 1:24:34.280]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:36.480]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:41.720]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[1:24:41.720 --> 1:24:46.600]  Water containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:47.600]  Pediatric.
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:52.160]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated
[1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:54.600]  with improved behavior and mental performance.
[1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:59.440]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:04.400]  Her job, the government, had the right under U.S. law to conduct secret testing on the
[1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:06.520]  American public under a specific condition.
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:11.160]  We have to work with dark side while we spend time in the shadows.
[1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:15.200]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:16.200]  Well, join me.
[1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:22.320]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to say there's a need for a new world order.
[1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:48.040]  One day, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:21.800]  I'm just going to let you know now that the Saturday is almost sold out right now.
[1:26:21.800 --> 1:26:27.360]  The Sunday has got, I don't know, they said like 30% of the tickets left, but that's kind
[1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:34.480]  of a illusion because they hold about 10% of the tickets back for the day of at the door.
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:37.520]  They just do that because they want people to be able to walk up for some reason, which
[1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:38.520]  is fine with me.
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:43.720]  So you can also get in line and I don't want to discourage people to not come.
[1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:44.720]  So I hope to see you there.
[1:26:44.720 --> 1:26:47.960]  I'll be giving a speech before each event.
[1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:49.600]  People are asking when the film's going to be out.
[1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:51.920]  It's not going to be out for a month and a half or so.
[1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:57.520]  I've still got to make the cover, make the DVD menu, get it mass produced.
[1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:00.960]  We are just showing it at the Alamo to really get your feedback.
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:06.200]  We might even tweak a few things next week on it after we get your feedback on it.
[1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:12.480]  Oh, there is so much here that I want to go over and also your phone calls.
[1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:15.600]  Tell you what I want to do right now.
[1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:16.600]  Let's just go ahead and take a call.
[1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:20.440]  We'll come back in the long segment and get more into this news.
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:21.760]  Let's talk to Chris and Florida.
[1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:22.760]  Chris, you're on the air.
[1:27:22.760 --> 1:27:23.760]  Hi, Alex.
[1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:24.760]  Hi.
[1:27:24.760 --> 1:27:33.520]  I just got a membership to the Prison Planet TV and I was really happy with it and I liked
[1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:37.360]  that picture you drew of Osama bin Laden.
[1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:40.720]  Maybe you could auction that off on eBay or something.
[1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:43.880]  I think that's an pile of papers that have already been thrown away, but yeah, that's
[1:27:43.880 --> 1:27:45.400]  quite a Picasso, isn't it?
[1:27:45.400 --> 1:27:47.080]  It was lovely.
[1:27:47.080 --> 1:27:48.080]  I like this sort.
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:52.440]  Hey, yesterday I drew some pictures for people.
[1:27:52.440 --> 1:27:53.480]  I must have missed it.
[1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:59.080]  The technocratic superstructure, advanced technology continuum.
[1:27:59.080 --> 1:28:01.120]  I think I may have caught it.
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:08.080]  What I wanted to ask you was, I've been talking to people in my family and some of them are
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:09.080]  pretty influential.
[1:28:09.080 --> 1:28:11.320]  I have an uncle who's the CEO of a company.
[1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:13.200]  He's just written a book.
[1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:17.520]  Well done, Lord Vader.
[1:28:17.520 --> 1:28:23.800]  He likes a lot of the things I tell him about the show and I want you to also pose a question
[1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:26.560]  to Burmese also later.
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:29.440]  Lord Burmese?
[1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:34.280]  What would he say were some of maybe the most compelling because when I talk to these people,
[1:28:34.280 --> 1:28:39.080]  anyone in general, I try to give this information out, were the kind of the most compelling
[1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:44.240]  points he'd make about 9-11, and then kind of...
[1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:48.840]  Well I would give him Terror Storm.
[1:28:48.840 --> 1:28:51.920]  I really think that's the best film on government-sponsored terror.
[1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:54.880]  The best way to convince somebody is to show them that the government's been caught over
[1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:59.280]  and over again admitting, and that other governments do it too, staging terror.
[1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:02.600]  You see, then you've already won the argument, well wait, they've done it before, well wait,
[1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:03.600]  they've got the motive.
[1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:06.920]  Well wait, the government wrote memos and Pentagon documents saying they wanted to stage
[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:10.320]  more attacks, and then you've got them, and then you go into the evidence.
[1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:11.320]  That's the most effective.
[1:29:11.320 --> 1:29:12.320]  Right.
[1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:16.120]  Instead the Pentagon's hiring people to run around and Hitler mustaches screaming and
[1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:19.160]  yelling and putting it on Howard Stern.
[1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:22.920]  So trying to make people think that's who we are, but it's going to fall flat on its
[1:29:22.920 --> 1:29:23.920]  face too.
[1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:24.920]  Anything else, sir?
[1:29:24.920 --> 1:29:25.920]  Yeah.
[1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:30.280]  When I told him, because he's in pharmaceuticals, I said the word eugenics, he said, oh that's
[1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:32.200]  a real politically loaded word.
[1:29:32.200 --> 1:29:36.400]  Stay there, we'll talk more about it on the other side.
[1:29:36.400 --> 1:29:41.520]  Goodbye, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:29:41.520 --> 1:29:51.680]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:55.920]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:29:55.920 --> 1:30:00.720]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:06.440]  It's known as the Bilderberg, but their objective being world domination.
[1:30:06.440 --> 1:30:09.600]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:15.520]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:30:15.520 --> 1:30:19.960]  of humanity is at hand.
[1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:24.960]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:30:24.960 --> 1:30:29.280]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:30:29.280 --> 1:30:31.960]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:35.120]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[1:30:35.120 --> 1:30:36.120]  they're after power.
[1:30:36.120 --> 1:30:37.120]  That's their after issue.
[1:30:37.120 --> 1:30:43.760]  Order in-game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or Infowars.com or watch it online right now
[1:30:43.760 --> 1:30:44.760]  at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:45.760]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:30:45.760 --> 1:30:46.760]  You have been warned.
[1:30:46.760 --> 1:30:49.240]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[1:30:49.240 --> 1:30:56.360]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what
[1:30:56.360 --> 1:31:00.440]  is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[1:31:00.440 --> 1:31:04.080]  For the last three years, the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce
[1:31:04.080 --> 1:31:07.760]  and it has now finally caught up with us, and the U.S. commodities such as flour and
[1:31:07.760 --> 1:31:11.440]  rice are already being rationed and the next rice crop won't be available for another four
[1:31:11.440 --> 1:31:12.960]  to five months.
[1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:16.320]  It's fall in the southern hemisphere and many countries are short the food necessary to
[1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:20.580]  make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[1:31:20.580 --> 1:31:22.240]  Remember our trade deficit?
[1:31:22.240 --> 1:31:25.440]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy
[1:31:25.440 --> 1:31:27.820]  our food production at any price.
[1:31:27.820 --> 1:31:31.920]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food
[1:31:31.920 --> 1:31:34.280]  and food exports under martial law.
[1:31:34.280 --> 1:31:46.320]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202 or visit us at www.ReadyReserveFoods.com

[1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:56.000]  Hemp, the super food for you and your family, hemp has nutritional values that far exceed
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:57.520]  any known plant.
[1:31:57.520 --> 1:32:01.280]  Hemp, used for food, clothing and shelter since time began.
[1:32:01.280 --> 1:32:05.360]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to
[1:32:05.360 --> 1:32:08.640]  grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[1:32:08.640 --> 1:32:12.100]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[1:32:12.100 --> 1:32:16.280]  The protein powder, seeds and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[1:32:16.280 --> 1:32:20.120]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many
[1:32:20.120 --> 1:32:25.320]  ailments, loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids
[1:32:25.320 --> 1:32:27.840]  and nutrients not available in other plants.
[1:32:27.840 --> 1:32:31.280]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and
[1:32:31.280 --> 1:32:32.280]  your family.
[1:32:32.280 --> 1:32:34.480]  Could this be the government's best kept secret?
[1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:41.200]  Call today at 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds and oil can do for you.
[1:32:41.200 --> 1:32:44.440]  Learn, help, shop at hempusa.org.
[1:32:44.440 --> 1:32:50.160]  We do not charge for shipping, that's 908-691-2608 or go to thehempusa.org today.
[1:33:22.360 --> 1:33:25.520]  We've got Jim Tucker coming up, a ton of news I haven't gotten to yet and I mean a ton.
[1:33:25.520 --> 1:33:27.080]  I've got three huge stacks here.
[1:33:27.080 --> 1:33:31.280]  The reason I don't usually cover about 10% of it is you can't do justice to any of it.
[1:33:31.280 --> 1:33:34.440]  I don't even want to mention that they're training police coast to coast to look for
[1:33:34.440 --> 1:33:39.320]  roadside bombs without getting into the fact that that's meant to train them to federalize.
[1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:43.200]  That's the cover story for having the military come in and then why I know that and the whole
[1:33:43.200 --> 1:33:47.760]  history of that and how I got their secret documents there because an idiot FBI agent
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:54.240]  gave us the classified ones on I-35 and they were running a takeover drill in Belton instead
[1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:55.760]  of the public release.
[1:33:55.760 --> 1:34:00.480]  They got so mad about that, that's on the web and in my film police day too, the takeover.
[1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:06.440]  But right now going back briefly here, just to finish up with Chris in Florida, you had
[1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:08.240]  one other point you wanted to make?
[1:34:08.240 --> 1:34:14.400]  Yeah, I guess most distinctly, how would you sum up that Eugenics was the umbrella science
[1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:17.640]  that everything sort of grew up around?
[1:34:17.640 --> 1:34:23.600]  Well notice he said, well that's kind of a politically charged term, see, that's kind
[1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:26.240]  of out of control, you know.
[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:27.240]  Ashism.
[1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:32.280]  Yeah, I mean that's what's always said about it, but we'll be more being reasonable
[1:34:32.280 --> 1:34:33.280]  about Eugenics.
[1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:35.640]  I mean, there's some good things about it.
[1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:38.800]  It's kind of the attitude that comes out of the establishment.
[1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:45.600]  It's simple, Darwin and his cousins are Francis Galton, they develop the idea of the theory
[1:34:45.600 --> 1:34:50.880]  of social Darwinism that the elite killing us, murdering us, enslaving us is good because
[1:34:50.880 --> 1:34:54.520]  it's survival of the fittest and they're making us stronger by doing it and getting
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:56.120]  rid of the useless eaters.
[1:34:56.120 --> 1:35:01.320]  That's a Hitler quote that he got from, of course, a eugenicist that came before him.
[1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:06.440]  And then when you look at the heads of all the major modern sciences, you look at what,
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:11.480]  I mean, Sir Francis Galton no doubt had like 180 IQ, the guy, before they were even doing
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:17.800]  IQs, I mean the guy did develop, it's something like 20 sciences, I mean it's just insane.
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:23.640]  Major branches and certainly a lot of those that research did give good findings.
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:27.520]  And there is some, you know, truth to breeding and genetics and intelligence and there is
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:30.880]  something to be said for some of, you know, so obviously.
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:33.880]  But it's the way they go about it, what they're pushing, what they're trying to do.
[1:35:33.880 --> 1:35:37.200]  So a lot of people go, well, eugenics sounds good to me, but they don't understand what
[1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:42.900]  the true final penultimate goal of eugenics is, that is exterminating their competition,
[1:35:42.900 --> 1:35:47.640]  the bad sons or the rogues that grow up out of the midst.
[1:35:47.640 --> 1:35:51.720]  That's it's really trying to dumb the mass down for orderly extermination, not just
[1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:55.680]  orderly extermination of the dumb mass, but actually orderly extermination of everybody
[1:35:55.680 --> 1:35:57.680]  but the elite.
[1:35:57.680 --> 1:36:03.040]  The ultimate form of war and you look at the beginnings of computers, the founder of the
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:04.840]  modern computer, Thomas Watson.
[1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:07.920]  You look at the founders of the human genome, I mean it's right there out of the Cold Springs
[1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:11.960]  Harbor with the former top eugenic scientist running the human genome.
[1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:15.720]  Remember having to quit last year calling, saying blacks weren't human basically.
[1:36:15.720 --> 1:36:19.120]  Another Mr. Watson, not related to Thomas Watson of IBM and then you find out that
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:23.040]  Prince Philip, Ted Turner, their mommy, their daddy, their grandpa were all obsessed.
[1:36:23.040 --> 1:36:27.200]  The Rockefellers, over 100 eugenics groups, they set up Planned Parenthood, the list goes
[1:36:27.200 --> 1:36:31.280]  on and on, funding Hitler, funding the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[1:36:31.280 --> 1:36:37.920]  You find out that's the name social services, the social workers, the assessments, bioethics,
[1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:43.800]  all of it's out of eugenics, it all, our entire, the royalty and the international banking
[1:36:43.800 --> 1:36:49.040]  cartels bought into this when it was rockstar popular, the law in the U.S. to sterilize and
[1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:51.320]  kill babies and everything else you can imagine.
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:55.720]  They adopted it, that was only 70, 80 years ago and it's total heyday, I guess 60 was
[1:36:55.720 --> 1:37:01.120]  about World War II and when it kind of got in trouble publicly and so all the institutions
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:07.000]  were set up along these lines, the institutions were set up to do this and carry this out
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:14.400]  so in-game covers it and as shocking as in-game is it isn't one inch down the well, the rabbit
[1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:19.480]  hole is so deep it would just blow your mind and it takes intense, I mean we've read scores
[1:37:19.480 --> 1:37:24.920]  of books here, research, sent off for university letters, just spent sometimes 18 hours freaking
[1:37:24.920 --> 1:37:29.520]  out looking at it all and then you can't even put it in a film, it's so horrible, you can't
[1:37:29.520 --> 1:37:33.600]  even and now they turn into the transhumanist and they say it's eugenics and they're going
[1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:37.440]  to force us to have chips and they're going to micromanage us and remote control us and
[1:37:37.440 --> 1:37:41.400]  they say it, that it's official government policy to do it and it doesn't matter, the
[1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:45.840]  sent com guys will just giggle and snicker as they listen and then help implement it.
[1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:50.320]  Them first because they'll make us because they had to do it, I mean it's everything
[1:37:50.320 --> 1:37:55.640]  sir, it's what drives them, it's what they believe in, it's 800 years ago in ancient
[1:37:55.640 --> 1:37:59.960]  England or in the city of Paris, the king of Paris, the king of France as he was known,
[1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:04.800]  had a very small area actually, I digress, it doesn't matter, Germany wasn't unified
[1:38:04.800 --> 1:38:10.680]  till Bismarck, France right before that but I digress into history, all knowledge is like
[1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:15.720]  endless halls of data and then once you start down one you go into another then how they
[1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:24.160]  all interconnect and how it all goes together, 800 years ago, 1,000 years ago, 2,300 years
[1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:28.600]  ago with Plato in the republic, he said we're going to have a suboid mass that we breed
[1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:33.120]  to be dumb and servile that we'll control and that if we get better machines we can
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:39.120]  exterminate them because and he like foresaw large mechanical devices and factories, these
[1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:44.360]  are geniuses but very cold and very evil and he said we won't even need as many of
[1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:50.480]  the slaves then or we can just kill them out and he coined the term eugenics meaning eternal
[1:38:50.480 --> 1:38:58.320]  youth or the gods, man becoming Mount Olympus, that's what it is, eternal youth means godhood,
[1:38:58.320 --> 1:39:02.600]  they don't die, gods don't die, they can create, that's why they want genetic engineering,
[1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:07.920]  it's all about playing god, put yourself in that mindset and then the nobles knew how
[1:39:07.920 --> 1:39:12.080]  to control populations, they would keep the population on 5, 10% of the land starving
[1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:16.120]  at subsistence level, a foot and a half shorter from malnutrition generationally than the
[1:39:16.120 --> 1:39:19.760]  elites riding around on their horses all clean, laughing at the peasants with vomit
[1:39:19.760 --> 1:39:24.920]  down the front of them, starving to death with a third of their children born from in
[1:39:24.920 --> 1:39:28.840]  utero retardation from lack of nourishment, they had that same problem in the rural areas
[1:39:28.840 --> 1:39:33.520]  of China, a third of the kids are retarded, just enjoying riding by all the poor retarded
[1:39:33.520 --> 1:39:40.320]  people and while they would, that was their enjoyment, I mutate you, I starve you, I control
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:43.840]  and then that's their mode to keep their control, only they could have bows, only they could
[1:39:43.840 --> 1:39:48.560]  have knives, only they could have swords and shields, they were a different species, they
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:54.320]  see they thought that 1,000 years ago, Plato thought that 2,350 something years ago and
[1:39:54.320 --> 1:39:58.160]  so this is their philosophy, this is their idea, this is their power trip, this is their
[1:39:58.160 --> 1:40:02.680]  looking down their nose at you, this is who they are, this is what they do, you understand?
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:03.680]  Yep.
[1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:07.800]  Okay, thank you for the call, appreciate it, okay let's shift gears, I don't want to give
[1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:13.640]  these disinfo Pentagon operatives and they are folks, I've met them, I've run into them,
[1:40:13.640 --> 1:40:18.520]  some of them are camp follower, useful idiot, mockingbirds that magnify what's being said
[1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:25.360]  and when you go on their site, it's all first battalion, fighting the chickens, we're fighting
[1:40:25.360 --> 1:40:30.640]  the anti-American al-Qaeda supporters and we've tracked a lot of their handles, other
[1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:34.640]  guys that attack us on dig and our own message boards, they'll even put out their own Myspace,
[1:40:34.640 --> 1:40:38.760]  you go to it, it's them in their uniform, you see the Psyop patch with the skull, they're
[1:40:38.760 --> 1:40:42.600]  bragging, I mean they're not even good, I mean I guess the government's so arrogant
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:47.560]  that and they've put so many idiots into Psyops that they don't understand, you lose all your
[1:40:47.560 --> 1:40:52.720]  effect when you go out and admit you're with Psyops, you dummies, and I mean it's, but
[1:40:52.720 --> 1:40:57.360]  again some of you are just camp followers and you see them posting, where's that print
[1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:06.160]  out you had in here, oh here it is, and we were, he was on the Pentagon website last
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:12.200]  night to the disinfo site, lavishloosechange.com or whatever it is, Corkscrew Loose Change
[1:41:12.200 --> 1:41:16.040]  and Burmese was on the site and he goes look at this and he linked through over to James
[1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:21.920]  Randy Educational Foundation where they debunk everything but don't really debunk it, it's
[1:41:21.920 --> 1:41:26.480]  actually Lord High Protectorville, you know where they deny China takes organs and they
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:30.560]  deny there's mercury in vaccines while the government admits it, and I mean just basically
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:35.560]  whatever the government line is James Randy does and then he, you know, he exposes a few
[1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:39.400]  magicians and then claims we're all magicians when he's a magician too and he admits he's
[1:41:39.400 --> 1:41:44.520]  a former magician, he's just a master magician engaged in larger deceptions and so they're
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:49.360]  on the James Randy thing and they're talking about how he's getting his microchip, why
[1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:53.320]  don't you read this and cover it in your own way, sure thing.
[1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:59.880]  The guy starts out saying okay this sounds like fun, I had to get a medical checkup today,
[1:41:59.880 --> 1:42:04.400]  I was not due for a physical for another five years but for some reason had to go in right
[1:42:04.400 --> 1:42:11.480]  away they said, go now and pick up your medical records, head to the medical center, I do,
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:15.680]  I get checked out head to toe and after I pass they stamp this on my medical records
[1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:22.760]  and it's posted over there but you can see it RFID, big letters, okay, I'm getting chipped,
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:27.000]  I got selected for the 1% of combat troops in my division, by the way that's just info,
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:30.820]  they always claim your city's been chosen for Delta Force training, your city's been
[1:42:30.820 --> 1:42:36.920]  trained for bomb disposal, you're the first, you're the only one, no buffoon, officers,
[1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:40.960]  many officers in select categories got chipped five years ago, go ahead.
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:46.200]  And he says to get one to monitor quote unquote stress patterns Alex for upcoming deployment,
[1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:50.280]  now I just want to stop right there, remember chips were only supposed to have an ID number
[1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:54.240]  that if they scanned it then there'd be a database, well this chip somehow reads stress
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:59.240]  patterns, isn't that just amazing Alex, it's not just a number anymore, so he goes on
[1:42:59.240 --> 1:43:03.160]  and he says, so I have a date when it goes in but no date when it comes out, I don't
[1:43:03.160 --> 1:43:08.480]  want to say this is for nefarious purposes but I don't see any reason to have this in
[1:43:08.480 --> 1:43:12.400]  me because I'm not deployed for another nine to ten months, congrats moonbats, you were
[1:43:12.400 --> 1:43:18.040]  right about something for once, oh yeah, so he actually, but then they go on the Randy
[1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:23.000]  forum and say we're still bad not to like it, yeah, well the funny thing is that a couple
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:26.280]  of them are pretty disgusted, they can't even believe that you know this guy's actually
[1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:29.040]  getting chipped and they ask him about it, they say well why don't you refuse and he's
[1:43:29.040 --> 1:43:33.800]  just like he toes the line, well I lose my military career, that's disobeying a lawful
[1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:38.440]  order, no, you're now known as a jackass, they're going to do more to you stupid guinea pig,
[1:43:38.440 --> 1:43:42.680]  absolutely, and they got wind of this and you know they're like oh well now they're
[1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:47.000]  going to talk about cyborgs, listen the chip has been implemented for over a decade, they
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:51.560]  do have brain chips, all you have to do is look up blind can see now and they have it
[1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:55.600]  set up, so they put a chip in your brain and they hook it up to a small camera where your
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:43:56.600]  iris is.
[1:43:56.600 --> 1:44:01.080]  And see that's all fine and dandy, the point is the Pentagon reports and we have a list
[1:44:01.080 --> 1:44:05.360]  of them, I put it in my book, it was in wire today which is a whitewash, you go read the
[1:44:05.360 --> 1:44:10.720]  actual reports, it says that they're going to make the military take brain chips and
[1:44:10.720 --> 1:44:14.040]  we told you dummies they were going to first put one under your skin, then it was going
[1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:20.000]  to get more advanced, we played the top futurist, you know the top marshal that the head futurist
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:23.840]  like 90 years old the Pentagon says they're going to put you on drugs, remote control
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:29.960]  you, I mean I'm not the one guys, I'm sorry that reality is dawning for you and that this
[1:44:29.960 --> 1:44:37.040]  is all happening but we only cover the facts here and no amount of black propaganda with
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:40.880]  your buddies running around in Hitler mustaches claiming to be us is going to help you.
[1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:46.960]  Yeah, I think the two major points that should dissuade anybody from being pro RFID under
[1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:51.560]  the skin are the fact that the Jacobs family went on the Today Show right after 9-11, said
[1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:55.720]  oh we're taking government chips, it's so great, but it turned out they really worked
[1:44:55.720 --> 1:44:56.720]  for the company.
[1:44:56.720 --> 1:44:57.720]  Yeah, they got a huge job.
[1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:02.800]  But they claimed but they didn't say that on the news, they signed a huge contract and
[1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:06.720]  then the second thing is that Dobbs back in December, the weird thing is the kid died
[1:45:06.720 --> 1:45:11.320]  hitting a light pole, on a motorcycle accident that is kind of bizarre, a little goblin.
[1:45:11.320 --> 1:45:12.320]  Well you know I feel bad for everybody.
[1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:13.320]  I'm saying it's an conspiracy.
[1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:17.480]  Yeah, no I'm just saying you know they took chips as a family on TV because of terrorism.
[1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:20.360]  But they were the ugliest looking little family I've ever seen in my life.
[1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:23.400]  Alright, alright, well they really were little demonic puds.
[1:45:23.400 --> 1:45:27.680]  Well I think what's scarier now Alex is that the Mexican government is actually announcing
[1:45:27.680 --> 1:45:32.000]  that they want to do away with passports for people who live in Guatemala and south of
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  Mexico and they just want to chip people.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:37.520]  They're saying well if you want to come into Mexico now legally you're going to be
[1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:38.520]  chipped.
[1:45:38.520 --> 1:45:42.040]  No I know and then that was mainstream news and then the Mexican Attorney General made
[1:45:42.040 --> 1:45:44.440]  his employees take it, US companies are making him take it.
[1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:47.760]  I had the police chief of Bergen County on and I was getting an email going there's
[1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:50.600]  not police chiefs of counties, there is a New Jersey Jack.
[1:45:50.600 --> 1:45:53.840]  I had him on and he goes yes I will make everyone take chips.
[1:45:53.840 --> 1:45:56.080]  He says I can't wait to make everyone take chips.
[1:45:56.080 --> 1:46:01.240]  Yeah and the Mexican Attorney General thing you're talking about is back in 2004, four
[1:46:01.240 --> 1:46:06.920]  years ago and 144 of his employees took it for quote unquote security purposes.
[1:46:06.920 --> 1:46:07.920]  And that was the first wave.
[1:46:07.920 --> 1:46:09.920]  They just said take it or leave your job.
[1:46:09.920 --> 1:46:11.960]  These are all PSYOP tests you dummies.
[1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:12.960]  Yeah.
[1:46:12.960 --> 1:46:17.680]  I mean you know I'm just, I feel so sorry for these guys but I was reading the comments
[1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:21.600]  in there this morning and it's you know people going oh it's good I mean come on.
[1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:25.600]  Well you know on top of all of everything we just talked about of the control modes
[1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:29.160]  and the fact that RFIDs aren't our friend they cause cancer Alex.
[1:46:29.160 --> 1:46:31.880]  Last year they did a study they found it caused cancer in rats.
[1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:39.000]  Of course having an RFID tag under your skin that omits a radio frequency folk is going
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  to cause cancer.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:42.920]  Well they're going to argue that it's only when it gets pinged that it doesn't do that
[1:46:42.920 --> 1:46:44.840]  but I mean here's an example.
[1:46:44.840 --> 1:46:47.320]  They put up radio readers all over the country that are standardized.
[1:46:47.320 --> 1:46:51.480]  They call it K-tag, Texas Tag, Smart Tag, you know any little Pavlovian term and they
[1:46:51.480 --> 1:46:52.920]  give the idiots.
[1:46:52.920 --> 1:46:56.840]  But then they admit and it's come out, I read it depending on documents first who designed
[1:46:56.840 --> 1:47:00.520]  all this and then later it's in the news as they introduced the slaves that they're reading
[1:47:00.520 --> 1:47:01.760]  them all over this country.
[1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:05.200]  They've got readers everywhere and so they know your name and they're tracking you.
[1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:10.200]  I told everybody that they had whole floors of every phone company was NSA because I read
[1:47:10.200 --> 1:47:11.840]  it in the Telecommunications Act.
[1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:13.200]  Now it came out last year.
[1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:15.800]  I told everybody they're tracking your cell phone even when it's off.
[1:47:15.800 --> 1:47:19.080]  Now they're flipping them on to emergency management centers where the cops type your
[1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:23.920]  name in and real time your phone comes up all designed for control and it turns out when
[1:47:23.920 --> 1:47:28.160]  they were developing cell phones in the 70s they knew that it gave all the rats cancer.
[1:47:28.160 --> 1:47:31.760]  Now there's hundreds of university studies where you get a massive increase fold and
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:37.840]  a rare tumor right where the cell phone's at and they call conspiracy theories there.
[1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:39.760]  The Randy Foundation says that too.
[1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:41.200]  Just everything's a lie.
[1:47:41.200 --> 1:47:44.760]  Just everything we say, the government loves you, everything's fine, the government never
[1:47:44.760 --> 1:47:49.680]  lies, they're never bad, you can trust them and then meanwhile in Florida you're going
[1:47:49.680 --> 1:47:52.800]  to get five to ten years in prison for speeding.
[1:47:52.800 --> 1:47:54.720]  Yeah, that's the way it is.
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:57.120]  If you don't understand RFIDs they're a total mode of control.
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:47:58.440]  It's to make you a product.
[1:47:58.440 --> 1:48:00.560]  It's to make you something that's on a shelf at Walmart.
[1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:01.560]  Well it's more than that.
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:07.480]  The Pentagon who developed them at MIT was actually developed for proximity detonators
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:08.480]  in World War II.
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:13.800]  That's why the flak, the shells wouldn't blow up our planes but would destroy their planes
[1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:17.680]  whenever they were during the Battle of Britain and the rest of it they already had it implemented.
[1:48:17.680 --> 1:48:26.800]  But the smaller RFID was smaller than a grain of sand but much smaller.
[1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:32.160]  They had that a decade ago, Hitachi's got it and they say that all real products will
[1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:36.640]  be like in cyberspace where they can Google where that tin can was or they can Google
[1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:43.520]  that battery so when the battery falls out of your toy and it's in your backyard they
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:47.360]  can come give you five years for the folks, it's already happening.
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:50.800]  Five years for that battery because they were able to scan it, that battery was in your
[1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:51.800]  backyard.
[1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:52.800]  Oh how lovely.
[1:48:52.800 --> 1:48:59.320]  Oh yeah, when your insurance is out they're already scanning your license plates and Texas
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:04.360]  almost passed us the last two legislative sessions in the last four years where the
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:08.480]  minute your insurance is out they're going to arrest you.
[1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:11.280]  But the police have been ordered to leave the illegals alone though.
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:13.040]  It's all selectively enforced.
[1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:14.040]  Like everything.
[1:49:14.040 --> 1:49:18.120]  When I told you they'd put face scanners in to quote stop liquor and cigarettes for kids,
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:22.640]  now AP, now other papers are reporting that yes it's going in.
[1:49:22.640 --> 1:49:28.840]  Well you know face scanners, biometrics, thumb scanners, all that stuff is on the forefront.
[1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:29.840]  It's coming.
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:33.360]  Well the Pentagon said it was to control you and they call it a total control grid.
[1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:34.360]  They call it a grid.
[1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:35.360]  They designed it.
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:39.060]  Well when I talked to Tommy Thompson of you know the X had a huge health and human services
[1:49:39.060 --> 1:49:43.280]  about this he really tried to marginalize it and he said oh well it's great for keeping
[1:49:43.280 --> 1:49:45.280]  track of inventory.
[1:49:45.280 --> 1:49:48.200]  Now inventory to me is a code word for people and soldiers.
[1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:49.840]  But then he said he wouldn't take a chip.
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:54.960]  Yeah well the first thing I prefaced it with was well you went on TV back in 2005 and you
[1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:58.680]  were on all these shows saying you were going to take one of these chips from Vera Chip
[1:49:58.680 --> 1:50:02.720]  with a company that you were working for essentially and he's like well first of all I had to take
[1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:03.720]  a chip.
[1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:04.720]  It wasn't essentially he was on the payroll.
[1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:05.720]  Yeah definitely.
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:06.720]  He was on the board wasn't he?
[1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:07.720]  Yeah.
[1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:09.080]  Yeah he was on the board and I think that was while he was the head of health and human
[1:50:09.080 --> 1:50:10.080]  services.
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:13.240]  But then Tommy Thompson doesn't exist in that national trip to hundreds of high schools
[1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:14.840]  saying get chips.
[1:50:14.840 --> 1:50:15.840]  That didn't exist either.
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:16.840]  Yeah the whole chip.
[1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:20.040]  Yeah there's not a program to recruit the preachers for Homeland Security to tell their
[1:50:20.040 --> 1:50:23.600]  flocks to turn their guns in though it's admitted year after I reported it.
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:26.960]  There's no program to tell kids to take chips even though it's going on.
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:30.200]  The crazy thing is you can go on eBay and you can get a whole kit for about ten bucks.
[1:50:30.200 --> 1:50:31.200]  That reads it.
[1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:34.520]  Yeah and then you can sign up for a program where basically you're a dog and you can locate
[1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:35.520]  yourself everywhere.
[1:50:35.520 --> 1:50:38.880]  You hear that parents you can chip your kids right now if you'd like to for fifteen dollars
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:39.880]  on eBay.
[1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:41.280]  You're good at sizing and so it doesn't exist.
[1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:42.280]  You're crazy.
[1:50:42.280 --> 1:50:43.280]  Get out of here moonbag.

[1:51:50.680 --> 1:51:57.640]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism but globalism.
[1:51:57.640 --> 1:52:01.160]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American Empire instead
[1:52:01.160 --> 1:52:03.480]  of what's fair for the American people.
[1:52:03.480 --> 1:52:07.280]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[1:52:53.600 --> 1:52:57.560]  If the American people truly hope to make a change in Washington, then we must act now
[1:52:57.560 --> 1:53:00.520]  with a cohesive plan for taking back our government.
[1:53:00.520 --> 1:53:04.880]  Washington You're Fired is a new patriotic documentary from the director of Beyond Treason.
[1:53:04.880 --> 1:53:10.320]  The video is the result of a two year endeavor to assemble a video tool for engaging, educating
[1:53:10.320 --> 1:53:14.240]  and motivating the American people to climb back into the driver's seat of Congress.
[1:53:14.240 --> 1:53:18.120]  Washington You're Fired lays out the last seven years of fundamentally flawed terror
[1:53:18.120 --> 1:53:22.320]  related spy bills in a linear fashion that no one has ever constructed before.
[1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:25.760]  The resulting shift in our governmental power structure leaves the American people with
[1:53:25.760 --> 1:53:30.000]  only two choices, be a part of the problem or be a part of the solution.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:33.720]  Washington You're Fired is being described as the best patriotic video since freedom
[1:53:33.720 --> 1:53:37.880]  to fascism and we want you to get a copy and share it with your friends.

[1:54:10.480 --> 1:54:39.680]  at Randy Foundation, the Denial Foundation, we've got the federal statistics up on infowars.com.
[1:54:39.680 --> 1:54:43.200]  Hundreds of times better chance of dying in an automobile accident than you do every year
[1:54:43.200 --> 1:54:47.960]  of dying of terrorism, even when the 3,000 deaths of 9-11 are averaged in if you believe
[1:54:47.960 --> 1:54:51.600]  terrorism really comes from men in caves, that they can run it all, but the government
[1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:52.600]  can't.
[1:54:52.600 --> 1:54:59.400]  It's too complex for the government, but it is not too complex for the men in caves
[1:54:59.400 --> 1:55:04.340]  that you have a 10 plus time chance to die by hitting a deer that caused you to wreck
[1:55:04.340 --> 1:55:05.840]  and kill yourself.
[1:55:05.840 --> 1:55:09.920]  Continue to die by terrorists and hundreds of times a chance of drowning.
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:15.720]  That doesn't matter, does it, because we've got to federalize the police.
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:21.920]  It was the day after Thanksgiving, 1998, Mike Hansen did camera work for me driving along
[1:55:21.920 --> 1:55:26.440]  from doing a construction job in Waco, he's driving through Belton, south of there, and
[1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:30.840]  he sees US Army troops running around, he was in the Army, he was thinking, that's strange,
[1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:38.040]  they were searching Greyhound bus and he pulls over and police walk up, Lieutenant Best,
[1:55:38.040 --> 1:55:43.000]  and says, turn your camera off, and Mike says, no, it's America, so they start threatening
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:51.280]  him on video, and that goes on and on for a while, and then they park all these dump
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:55.360]  trucks in front, but Mike goes ahead and just goes around and talks to the people who've
[1:55:55.360 --> 1:55:59.440]  been waiting 9 hours and it was 12 hours and it went on, Mike says, you can't stop me from
[1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:03.080]  going in Dairy Queen, but then the cops threatened him to arrest him, he didn't turn his camera
[1:56:03.080 --> 1:56:06.680]  off, so he did do that to go eat because he was out there for hours, they're the Lordships,
[1:56:06.680 --> 1:56:09.800]  they tell you not to videotape, and they say, yeah, they just tell us there's a terrorist
[1:56:09.800 --> 1:56:14.200]  and a bomb, but then they told the news it was a drill, and it was a drill, turn out Greyhound
[1:56:14.200 --> 1:56:17.520]  was working with them all over the country, and letting their unwitting passengers who
[1:56:17.520 --> 1:56:21.880]  tend to be poor, tend to not know what's going on, not be able to defend themselves, perfect
[1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:26.240]  group, see these drills always go live now, I've got Marines arresting US citizens in
[1:56:26.240 --> 1:56:32.080]  Swanborough, North Carolina on video quote, a drill that goes live with the police, that
[1:56:32.080 --> 1:56:34.840]  was when they were getting rid of Posse commentators, we told you they were and you said it was
[1:56:34.840 --> 1:56:38.720]  a conspiracy theory and now they've announced they've gotten rid of it, we're always right,
[1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:42.040]  but again, I guess the debunkers will just say that they didn't get rid of Posse commentators
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:46.680]  when they did, but then you'll say they did, but it's good, it's called double thinking
[1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:53.760]  my friends, crime stop, you do it well, but when you see a story like this, the AP carried
[1:56:53.760 --> 1:56:58.640]  Homeland Security to train cops to combat roadside bombs, the US Department of Homeland
[1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:02.720]  Security is holding a workshop in Fayetteville to teach local law enforcement agencies how
[1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:08.880]  to handle roadside bombs reports the AP, no done in Iraq, but here in America, now it
[1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:14.240]  says the department's office of bomb prevention will host Tuesday's workshop, now the FBI
[1:57:14.240 --> 1:57:19.640]  pulled up to threaten Mike in Belton after about two hours and said look, here's a press
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:24.080]  release, get out of here, well he gave us a press release on top and then under it was
[1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:28.600]  a classified not for distribution, it's on the website, it's in the film, police state
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:35.520]  to the takeover, not for distribution internal for police departments and it said bomb disposal
[1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:42.920]  is a cover for a covert military assistance program in 77 counties warrants service, arrest
[1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:50.320]  apprehension, it just lists scores of things and says it's a huge secret covert program
[1:57:50.320 --> 1:57:56.120]  with the US Army out of Fort Hood, 77 counties rapid reaction force and if you need our
[1:57:56.120 --> 1:58:01.720]  military addressing uniforms that aren't identified, because you'll see troops when they're with
[1:58:01.720 --> 1:58:06.920]  them, it won't say police, it'll be a black uniform just like the police, but it won't
[1:58:06.920 --> 1:58:12.720]  be local, criminal, secret, wicked, just like they've been taking your blood for 35 years,
[1:58:12.720 --> 1:58:18.000]  criminal, secret, wicked, at birth, and now Bush signs an ex, Bill last week making it
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:23.720]  legal, criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal, take a newborn
[1:58:23.720 --> 1:58:32.560]  baby's blood for homeland security, criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal.

[1:58:50.400 --> 1:58:56.400]  It's known as the Bilderberg, put their objective being world domination.
[1:58:56.400 --> 1:59:01.800]  For thousands of years their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world
[1:59:01.800 --> 1:59:10.600]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand, for the first time

[1:59:16.320 --> 1:59:19.200]  that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:59:19.200 --> 1:59:21.880]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:59:21.880 --> 1:59:25.000]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:27.240]  they're after power, yes they're after easier.

[1:59:44.080 --> 1:59:51.640]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:51.640 --> 1:59:58.640]  Yeah, government cover-ups, you want answers?
[1:59:58.640 --> 2:00:00.280]  Well so does he.
[2:00:00.280 --> 2:00:09.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:09.080 --> 2:00:17.160]  Yeah, so it sounds ridiculous when you see an AP headline like Homeland Security to
[2:00:17.160 --> 2:00:23.120]  train cops into combat roadside bombs in the US, you think well there's no bombing going
[2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:27.840]  on, you know, that's to train the public aid and any when they see a paper box blowing
[2:00:27.840 --> 2:00:33.600]  around or anything just, men in black uniforms, save me, we're going to get Jim Tucker on
[2:00:33.600 --> 2:00:36.400]  in the next segment, in fact go ahead and get him lined up.
[2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:40.840]  And then we've got this 911 call where this guy's breaking in, attacking this woman and
[2:00:40.840 --> 2:00:46.960]  she calls 911 and the 911 operator says I could care less what happens to you, starts
[2:00:46.960 --> 2:00:51.360]  cussing at her and the reason I want to play this is then we're going to play another piece
[2:00:51.360 --> 2:00:57.600]  where a gun club was meeting with concealed carry holders and others and the police, they
[2:00:57.600 --> 2:01:01.400]  always meet at this restaurant and the police came in and went ahead and took their guns
[2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:04.240]  and arrested some of them.
[2:01:04.240 --> 2:01:07.600]  And there's no law but the cops just said look we arrest you for that.
[2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:12.160]  And that's like Texas, you can walk around with a gun on your hip but don't try it, you'll
[2:01:12.160 --> 2:01:14.480]  be, SWAT team will kill you within minutes.
[2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:19.200]  I mean, every few weeks you hear about an apartment complex or neighborhood shut down
[2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:24.160]  and it always turns out later that, you know, it's deer season, it's really bad during deer
[2:01:24.160 --> 2:01:29.440]  season or it's duck season or it's turkey season where the guy's going to the range
[2:01:29.440 --> 2:01:33.480]  and I'll never forget, well this happened to me I guess about 15 years ago, I was walking
[2:01:33.480 --> 2:01:37.760]  out of my apartment and my Mustang was parked right outside of my apartment and I went and
[2:01:37.760 --> 2:01:43.880]  opened the hatch back up and laid a deer rifle in there and I went back in the house was
[2:01:43.880 --> 2:01:46.400]  doing something and five minutes later a cop pulls up, he's walking around and he's like
[2:01:46.400 --> 2:01:50.560]  if you see somebody with a gun and I'm like yeah I'm going deer hunting, he's like okay
[2:01:50.560 --> 2:01:54.440]  we got to report a one, kind of see it and back then I was young and dumb and was like
[2:01:54.440 --> 2:01:59.880]  well yeah, here man, that's your country dude, just filth, trash, chicken neck, weaklings
[2:01:59.880 --> 2:02:05.600]  everywhere just shaking and cowardly fear and they've got this city council meeting
[2:02:05.600 --> 2:02:09.040]  where they're going I think they should have banned the guns, I think they should have
[2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:14.600]  gotten them and to protest at the gun owners because in that particular state, you know
[2:02:14.600 --> 2:02:20.320]  it's concealed carry open, you can take them in the town hall meeting and they've got guns
[2:02:20.320 --> 2:02:25.440]  there and the citizens are going I'm scared they've got guns, I only want police to have
[2:02:25.440 --> 2:02:27.160]  them.
[2:02:27.160 --> 2:02:30.560]  The average and I haven't looked this up in years so you can look it up but you'll find
[2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:33.480]  that five, six years ago this was the number, I haven't looked it up since then, I want
[2:02:33.480 --> 2:02:36.960]  to be careful with statistics because they change but in fact let me just, I can't do
[2:02:36.960 --> 2:02:44.880]  it now, I want to you Google average 9-11 call national, try this national average 9-11
[2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:51.960]  call time or 9-11 response time, that should get it, 9-11 response time, find the national
[2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:56.120]  average for me but it used to be 11 and a half minutes roughly.
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:03:02.640]  Now let me give you a news flash, if somebody breaks in my house, upstairs in two places
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:08.120]  downstairs I got instant access pistol safe, I just bam bam bam, so five, you know, key
[2:03:08.120 --> 2:03:16.000]  with pinky once, index once, middle finger twice, index again, I'm not giving my actual
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:24.440]  codes but they're all different anyways, the point is boom pops open and you're dead, my
[2:03:24.440 --> 2:03:28.240]  wife my children come first, it's not that I even want to kill you to act tough or have
[2:03:28.240 --> 2:03:31.920]  some macho thing, people that think citizens with guns are like that, believe me I don't
[2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:34.480]  want you bleeding all over my house, I don't want to have to kill you and fill out the
[2:03:34.480 --> 2:03:38.960]  paperwork, but in fact if you're trying to break in my back door, I'm going to kill
[2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:44.440]  you, I'm going to go into a crash position and I'm going to shoot you and that's just
[2:03:44.440 --> 2:03:48.680]  how it works, how the cookie crumbles, that's because my life comes first, not yours you
[2:03:48.680 --> 2:03:54.120]  drugged out idiot on government narcotics trying to come in my house, I'm not going
[2:03:54.120 --> 2:03:59.640]  to call 9-11, it's a joke, I mean if we had officers on every street corner and I called
[2:03:59.640 --> 2:04:04.600]  9-11 that would take 10 seconds to call it, 10 seconds for them to answer, 20 seconds
[2:04:04.600 --> 2:04:10.120]  for me to explain I'm at this address and this guy is breaking in and then it would
[2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:14.600]  take them a minute to arrive and a minute to, I mean 11 and a half minutes is actually
[2:04:14.600 --> 2:04:25.000]  pretty fast, it's just not going to happen, if you do that you're dead and that's why
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:30.520]  Chicago and New York have 4-5-6-7-8 depending on the year of the crime rates of places
[2:04:30.520 --> 2:04:36.920]  like Phoenix, Arizona or Austin, Texas, because you carjacks somebody around here, you come
[2:04:36.920 --> 2:04:41.760]  into somebody's house about half the time they're going to kill you and we got all these cowardly
[2:04:41.760 --> 2:04:48.200]  weak domesticated people that are scared of us having guns, leave the country scum.

[2:05:52.480 --> 2:05:56.480]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[2:05:56.480 --> 2:06:00.520]  the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others

[2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:48.120]  for thought crime when they get their new brain ships? They will be.
[2:09:48.120 --> 2:09:56.680]  And I'm weird for covering it. Arizona State University test pandemic flu plans, mass deaths
[2:09:56.680 --> 2:10:02.640]  and control with simulated newscast, 12 sets of eyes trained across the dark room waiting
[2:10:02.640 --> 2:10:07.200]  for one of the seven Florida ceiling video screens to light up, seconds later the center
[2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:13.080]  screen eliminated revealing a newscast on the latest developments of the avian flu.
[2:10:13.080 --> 2:10:17.600]  Except the news broadcast wasn't real, it was part of a tabletop exercise full of hypothetical
[2:10:17.600 --> 2:10:23.840]  situations intended to test ASU's response. It's meant to fool NSA computers so that branches
[2:10:23.840 --> 2:10:27.440]  of the government that aren't part of the terror op when they really launch a bio attack,
[2:10:27.440 --> 2:10:31.360]  they're so used to hearing chatter about it that the government's unable to stop it.
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:35.080]  That's how the criminals and government operate, very sophisticated. And then it creates fear
[2:10:35.080 --> 2:10:39.520]  mongering and hype and the perception by the intelligentsia that this is going to be normal
[2:10:39.520 --> 2:10:43.560]  when the bird flu comes, normal when the mass deaths happen, all the Hollywood movies saying
[2:10:43.560 --> 2:10:46.560]  the same thing, then you read globalist documents and they show they're going to release bio
[2:10:46.560 --> 2:10:50.160]  weapons and kill you and your family. So just know the number one culprits as you're dying
[2:10:50.160 --> 2:10:55.560]  are them. Just remember, at least as you're dying, you'll know I was right. You can, might
[2:10:55.560 --> 2:11:00.120]  not have a very good internet connection over to the screw loose change of the Randy forums
[2:11:00.120 --> 2:11:03.360]  to try to debunk us when the government's releasing their bio weapon on you whenever
[2:11:03.360 --> 2:11:06.160]  that is. Next month, 20 years from now, I don't know, they just say they're going to
[2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:10.440]  do it, but you can still feel powerful as you know, you're getting your chips and everything's
[2:11:10.440 --> 2:11:21.240]  okay. Oh my goodness. Speeders under Florida law face vehicle confiscation. And it says
[2:11:21.240 --> 2:11:26.040]  as of October 1st, anyone caught doing 30 miles over the speed limit in Florida faces
[2:11:26.040 --> 2:11:33.200]  vehicle confiscation five to 10 years in prison and 10 year license suspension bill HP 137,
[2:11:33.200 --> 2:11:37.080]  which was signed into law earlier today was originally targeted at motorcyclists, but
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:41.920]  was amended at last minute to include all vehicles. The full tax of the bill follows
[2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:45.480]  and you can read it and it and it some of you're going to say, well, man, 30 miles over
[2:11:45.480 --> 2:11:49.320]  the speed limit. That's reckless driving. Oh yeah, I was driving out to Crawford one
[2:11:49.320 --> 2:11:56.000]  time to cover an event on a 60 mile an hour road and guess how fast I was going on my
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:12:01.400]  cruise control. Rob and Aaron were both in the car with me had their cameras ready. We're
[2:12:01.400 --> 2:12:06.040]  driving and I'm driving the middle of nowhere out in the country. There's nothing around
[2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:12.600]  and I didn't see, I mean, he was waiting. I didn't see the 30 mile an hour. It went
[2:12:12.600 --> 2:12:19.400]  down to 30 miles an hour and that was because down a concrete road behind a bunch of trees
[2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:26.080]  was a middle school. Now when the school light flashing, it was just you got to go 30 and
[2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:29.560]  it's only for about a hundred yards. And so I'm, you know, you're talking, you're trying
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:33.240]  to watch the sign and you're blah, blah, blah. You're going out a straight road in
[2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:37.440]  the country and they put a speed trap there and he comes over and he goes, Hey, Alex
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:43.880]  Jones, listen to your radio show on the internet. Listen to your coast to coast. And I go,
[2:12:43.880 --> 2:12:47.360]  do you want my license and registration? So he goes, No. He goes, I know who you are.
[2:12:47.360 --> 2:12:50.720]  Let me just give you a ticket. I was really weird and he just comes back and gives me
[2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:57.120]  a ticket and you want to see my insurance? No, I know you got it. So have a good one.
[2:12:57.120 --> 2:13:01.520]  And I'll never forget that. But the point is, boom, I'm going to prison 10 years. I
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:08.360]  mean, driving like to be white knuckle, totally focused hyperventilating, not to, you know,
[2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:14.600]  you got a late library book felony charges. You don't return a video two days late felony
[2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:23.400]  charges. You don't, you drop a banana peel or, or, or, or, or Apple Corps. You're arrested,
[2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:27.600]  misdemeanor charges. You don't make a turn signal. You're arrested. You don't have a
[2:13:27.600 --> 2:13:32.880]  seatbelt on. You're arrested. The cops waiting in the neighborhood, logo Vista. She takes
[2:13:32.880 --> 2:13:36.960]  off her seatbelt, gets out at the community mailbox, couple hundred yards from her home.
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:40.600]  The cops admitted in court. Yes. She, she had it on, took it off. I witnessed her doing
[2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:45.200]  it. She, I mean, they're sitting around all over England. They have spies. If you're making
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:48.520]  racial comments at dinner at restaurants, they have you arrested. You know, all of this
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:54.800]  thought, crime, harassment, total control with the private prison companies lobbying
[2:13:54.800 --> 2:14:00.560]  all over the country right now to quote, make stricter laws to put people in prison. See,
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:06.360]  and they always release the violent offenders to go out and terrorizes. It's a formula. They
[2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:09.800]  always do that and say, well, see, we need more people in prison while they disarm us
[2:14:09.800 --> 2:14:13.440]  in our city. So they can have their way with us. And while every criminal in Latin America
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:17.480]  knows they can come to the U S give any fake name they want and get an ID with a new identity
[2:14:17.480 --> 2:14:22.320]  and sometimes have five, six identities and go back and forth, kill cops, kill FBI, kill
[2:14:22.320 --> 2:14:27.600]  whoever they want. Hundreds of cops, hundreds, hundreds are killed a year. Go look at the
[2:14:27.600 --> 2:14:34.400]  numbers. Scores every year in Southern California. And they just run right back to Mexico. No
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:38.320]  extradition, but you don't care how many dead cops there are because they don't tell you
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:41.400]  that's a threat. So you're not scared of it. They tell you citizens are a threat. So you
[2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:46.520]  shake and fear and shake when you walk up to cars, when your real death is a semi flying
[2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:51.800]  by you two feet away. I'll see these cops and semis right by them daredevil just just
[2:14:51.800 --> 2:14:58.440]  walking right by traffic going 70 miles an hour, hanging their butts out in the road.
[2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:02.360]  I keep making that point, but they're not scared because they weren't taught to be afraid.
[2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:12.400]  But man, talk about a citizen. They're just a roadside bombs are everywhere. All part
[2:15:12.400 --> 2:15:19.440]  of the paranoia. Go read the bill. So what happens is you're you're going down the road
[2:15:19.440 --> 2:15:30.840]  and it goes from 60 to 30. Boom, they got you 10 years in prison. And the state was
[2:15:30.840 --> 2:15:34.120]  smart. They didn't make it a debate about whether you should go to jail. They made a
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:39.040]  debate about what that's a Delphi technique about whether it should be just for motorcycles
[2:15:39.040 --> 2:15:43.840]  or everybody. They said, should people go to 30 years for going, I mean, 10 years in
[2:15:43.840 --> 2:15:50.040]  prison for 30 miles over the speed limit? Should they, because it says in the newspaper
[2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:57.640]  that that was the debate was about that. Should you get 30 years? I keep getting it wrong.
[2:15:57.640 --> 2:16:01.520]  Should you get 10 years when 30 miles of the speed limit of your motorcycles or if you're
[2:16:01.520 --> 2:16:06.040]  a car driver or both? So they had a big fight with each other. It was a false choice. Should
[2:16:06.040 --> 2:16:10.000]  it be motorcycles or everybody? They said, everybody, everybody, that's not fair. All
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:15.880]  of us. And they said, okay, don't worry, all of you now. Another behavioral psychologist
[2:16:15.880 --> 2:16:23.960]  operation works with absolute precision. 30 miles. That's extreme. Oh yeah, I got one
[2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:29.400]  for 30 miles over. Whenever town that was outside Crawford, 30 miles over. I've only
[2:16:29.400 --> 2:16:32.560]  had one of those tickets in my life. Usually it's like eight miles over, you know, now
[2:16:32.560 --> 2:16:39.240]  to give me a for five over speeders under Florida law face real confiscation five to
[2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:46.880]  10 years in prison. Oh, right. Isn't that nice? And that's special gun owners, a protest
[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:53.400]  police action. I'm going to play this in a moment. Globalists take a step closer to
[2:16:53.400 --> 2:16:58.880]  $200 a barrel oil. Paul Joseph Watson, globalist hell bent on reducing the living standards
[2:16:58.880 --> 2:17:04.320]  of Westerners by jacking up oil prices in a whopping $200 a barrel took a step closer
[2:17:04.320 --> 2:17:08.960]  to their target yesterday after JPMorgan chasing co announced that they will begin trading oil
[2:17:08.960 --> 2:17:16.800]  by the end of the year. And JPMorgan went on to say they believe that it will be $200
[2:17:16.800 --> 2:17:20.120]  by the end of this year. I don't know that's really going to happen. But the fact that
[2:17:20.120 --> 2:17:28.320]  they're betting on that and just get ready for a rape and remember the different debunking
[2:17:28.320 --> 2:17:33.600]  forums and dig in my own website where they can post making fun of me six months ago a
[2:17:33.600 --> 2:17:39.720]  year ago, going, these lion nuts are a dollar in a week. I tell you trying to undermine
[2:17:39.720 --> 2:17:45.600]  our country. We don't appreciate you. Just all that kind of garbage from you. I mean,
[2:17:45.600 --> 2:17:49.640]  these thumbs suck in patriots. They're not real patriots, but these little rosy cheek
[2:17:49.640 --> 2:17:54.600]  soft guys. They've always, you know, got a crew cut and act like they're real tough.
[2:17:54.600 --> 2:18:00.920]  And they're really just little, little, I don't know what the right term. Well, I've
[2:18:00.920 --> 2:18:07.320]  got a profane term. I'm not going to use it. Just little groveling sycophant pumps that
[2:18:07.320 --> 2:18:13.400]  just follow after the system. You know, little kiss ups, you know, thumbsuckers, bedwetters.
[2:18:13.400 --> 2:18:18.320]  I don't know what you call them. I've got really worse comments about the color of their
[2:18:18.320 --> 2:18:25.440]  noses, but I just can't. These people, you're sick fools. You're cowardly little scumbags.
[2:18:25.440 --> 2:18:29.320]  You can't handle the factors. A real tyranny. You certainly don't have the manhood to stand
[2:18:29.320 --> 2:18:34.240]  up and fight this evil, the risk of your blood and name and treasure. So instead you just
[2:18:34.240 --> 2:18:41.040]  nitty and lie about everything and deny everything. Oh, like this, um, AP reported days ago.
[2:18:41.040 --> 2:18:45.080]  I never even got to it. In fact, I just had it in the stack that, oh, the Pentagon quietly
[2:18:45.080 --> 2:18:53.040]  admitted the latest find of Iranian weapons was not Iranian at all. It was Russian bought
[2:18:53.040 --> 2:18:57.640]  decades ago, and they know that it's all got serial numbers. It's all in Jane's weapons
[2:18:57.640 --> 2:19:03.920]  encyclopedia. They all know the weapons experts within seconds know what it is. Iran's trying
[2:19:03.920 --> 2:19:08.680]  to make peace deals. Iran's trying to work everything out. They, the al-sader keeps making
[2:19:08.680 --> 2:19:12.240]  peace deals and they keep trying to murder him. And then when he fights back, you know,
[2:19:12.240 --> 2:19:17.080]  they call him al-Qaeda terrorist when she acts are the opposite of al-Qaeda. And every
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:21.040]  few months they go, we found another weapons cache. General Petraeus comes before the media
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:25.280]  and says, it's definitely Iran. We've got to hit him. And then the media goes, oh my God,
[2:19:25.280 --> 2:19:31.280]  that's incredible. And then later they've got it. Actually it was Russian 15 years old.
[2:19:31.280 --> 2:19:37.000]  It doesn't matter. Iran's with al-Qaeda. That's why our al-Qaeda forces are hitting them hard.
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  Meanwhile Iran's suing the US for running al-Qaeda.
[2:21:02.200 --> 2:21:06.040]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the US, hinting

[2:30:47.760 --> 2:30:51.760]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[2:30:51.760 --> 2:30:56.760]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:30:56.760 --> 2:30:59.760]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[2:30:59.760 --> 2:31:05.760]  But their objective being world domination.
[2:31:05.760 --> 2:31:15.760]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:31:15.760 --> 2:31:21.760]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[2:31:47.760 --> 2:31:51.760]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[2:31:51.760 --> 2:31:55.760]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[2:31:55.760 --> 2:32:02.760]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with the worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[2:32:02.760 --> 2:32:05.760]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[2:32:05.760 --> 2:32:14.760]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[2:32:14.760 --> 2:32:19.760]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[2:32:19.760 --> 2:32:28.760]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way. The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more.
[2:32:28.760 --> 2:32:35.760]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with oxysilver.

[2:32:58.760 --> 2:33:15.760]  There's a stone in yonder graveyard with my name carved in it deep. It don't tell my life story.
[2:33:15.760 --> 2:33:44.760]  These things, it can't repeat. I never had a family. I never took a wife. All I had was a father. And I drank away my life.
[2:33:44.760 --> 2:34:13.760]  So bury the bottle with me for it's what tore me down. So I won't be alone tonight when they put me in the ground when they lower my body down.
[2:34:13.760 --> 2:34:35.760]  A drunker is a sinner. On this I place no doubt. Oh, the Lord won't share his paths with the things he lives without.
[2:34:35.760 --> 2:34:59.760]  For the bottle is the devil and drinking is his name. Now the bottle is what took my soul and petrified my brain.
[2:34:59.760 --> 2:35:26.760]  So bury the bottle with me for it's what tore me down. So I won't be alone tonight when they put me in the ground when they lower my body down.
[2:35:26.760 --> 2:35:32.760]  Later we'll play when daddy was around. That's a really sad song. I was rude to my dad the other day on the phone.
[2:35:32.760 --> 2:35:40.760]  I was a few nights ago watching, actually last night watching a Dick Curliss song on YouTube by watching it.
[2:35:40.760 --> 2:35:46.760]  It's the audio with images on it. I called up my dad and said hi to him because I heard that when daddy was around song.
[2:35:46.760 --> 2:35:56.760]  Better treat your parents good folks because you never know how long you're going to have them. Same thing with your wife, your husband, your kids and don't sweat the little stuff because at least you're not in Myanmar, Burma.
[2:35:56.760 --> 2:36:04.760]  You know where there's 30 something thousand dead or 50 something thousand dead in China from a big earthquake.
[2:36:04.760 --> 2:36:11.760]  We're going to go to Dave, Randy, Leo, Kyle, a bunch of other people but I've got to play this now or we'll never get to it.
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:20.760]  We had a lot of other stuff I'm going to be playing too after we take these calls. I want to play this first. 9-11 operator, I don't give a bleep what happens to you.
[2:36:20.760 --> 2:36:32.760]  And then we'll juxtapose that to some cowardly citizens at a city council meeting literally just crying and whining that citizens can walk around with guns on their hips.
[2:36:32.760 --> 2:36:37.760]  Why not? You think a bank robber is going to follow the law?
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:52.760]  In a safer society, we need to get over our phobia of guns. I mean, let me tell you, you try to drive around in Texas with a gun in your pickup rack, the cops will pull you over, hyperventilating, what you got that for? I'm the one as it, I'm the one.
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:37:04.760]  Hey, Boba, back when everybody had guns in their pickup trucks, we didn't have very much crime. Cops were a lot safer. I know most of the police know that. I mean, they're not one-tenth as idiotic as the general public.
[2:37:04.760 --> 2:37:15.760]  I've told you, I had a carpet cleaner at my house who saw a shotgun in a rack. This is back before I had children up on the wall in the radio studio. I was in it from my house. I had a shotgun on the wall.
[2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:24.760]  And he was like looking at it and acting weird and scared in the room. And I was like, what's going on? And he was like, oh, are you allowed to have that?
[2:37:24.760 --> 2:37:36.760]  And he went and tried to call the police on me, but the higher ups at the carpet cleaner place said, no, and I had a bad feeling and called. And the manager says, we stopped him from calling. We understand you're allowed to own it.
[2:37:36.760 --> 2:37:39.760]  But if you don't like it, you don't have to use us anymore.
[2:37:39.760 --> 2:37:54.760]  And then that night on Access TV, his assistant called in. I was telling the story and he said, yeah, I was there. And he never seen my TV show before. He just so happened. The assistant is so happened. It was a white guy in Hispanic. His Hispanic was like the helper carpet cleaner.
[2:37:54.760 --> 2:38:06.760]  There was two of them. He goes, yeah, no, it was a big thing. They did call the cops, but then it got stopped. And because I had a shotgun in my house in Texas, we're living under mind control.
[2:38:06.760 --> 2:38:15.760]  I see stories every day where people get rated for fish tanks because the idiot repair men think that they're making that methamphetamines being made in terrariums and fish tanks.
[2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:18.760]  I saw that again last week in the news.
[2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:29.760]  They spy on your power bill to see how much power you're using. And if you're a single person in a home using too much or everybody I seem to know, I had a friend I told this story.
[2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:40.760]  Didn't use any drugs. Didn't even drink exercise nuts. Him and his girlfriend. Now they're married. And she was taking botany at UT botany's plant growing and idiot repair man.
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:48.760]  I think it was carpet cleaner again was at their apartment. And this is years before that before you lived in a house with an apartment complex.
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:39:01.760]  And it was a big freak out. Austin SWAT team came out, busted down the door, went in, there were orchids growing in the back, but he saw grow light. He saw plants and I'm going to get 30% of the whatever the conviction is I'm rich.
[2:39:01.760 --> 2:39:10.760]  Most people don't take carpet cleaning jobs and exterminator jobs folks because they want to, they take them a lot of them, not all of them because they want to steal.
[2:39:10.760 --> 2:39:16.760]  They want to pick up on your wife and I've actually seen it happen. And they also want to report on you and get money.
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:29.760]  There I've seen reports where there are people that work in airport checkout lines. It was one case where the woman made like 200 and something grand next to her 30 grand a year because she was getting percentages of stuff that was seized and it finally all stopped.
[2:39:29.760 --> 2:39:46.760]  When some black guy a botanist again back to plants he owned a big greenhouse. He flew down from North Carolina to buy yopans in Houston. Nice trees. We got those in our yard. Yopans grew wild here and he went and paid 14 days. He was going to pay $14,000 cash for him.
[2:39:46.760 --> 2:40:02.760]  He'd done that every year for decades and he was flying down. He was flying from North Carolina to Houston. There's hundreds of cases. This is just one I remember. This is on 60 minutes and he goes up and he pulls out his money and he's sitting there paying with it and she licks her lips.
[2:40:02.760 --> 2:40:16.760]  Black guy money. He's not supposed to have that. And the state called. They seized it. No drugs. No criminal record. He had the previous purchase orders. He'd already made the order. He presented that in court and the federal court said hey, your money's gone.
[2:40:16.760 --> 2:40:31.760]  Okay. Don't carry money around. We rule. Shut up. We got automatic weapons. We got armored vehicles. Take the mercury. You're lucky you're not an African when we ship in potatoes with sterilization compounds in it.
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:40.760]  The Africans run now from the vaccines. Now they won't eat any of the food they dump off. The globalists are real mad. Suddenly all the numbers of them dying from bio weapons are dropping.
[2:40:40.760 --> 2:40:48.760]  It's all over the foreign press. The Nobel Prize winners are coming out. Top scientists analyzing the food that's been injected, the vaccines, all of it.
[2:40:48.760 --> 2:41:03.760]  So now they got spray planes out to help the Africans. Oh, the government so. And look, if you're not flipping out right now like I am, this is sick. I hate talking about this. I hate these people. That's why I'm getting upset.
[2:41:03.760 --> 2:41:17.760]  And I'll tell you who I really hate. Well meaning people in government who have been in denial about this. Everything we've told you has been happening. Oil prices, dollar plunging, housing. We told you years before. We know what we're talking about.
[2:41:17.760 --> 2:41:29.760]  I'm out of control. Go ahead and play the lady calling 911. I'm so sick of seeing women get raped and killed and then people say, well, women can't shoot guns. Women are incredible with guns.
[2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:46.760]  We need to take our women out. You need to take your daughters out, teach them how to shoot, teach them safety. And some piece of garbage comes into her house. You tell her, just be very calm, hit a knee and pump every round right into the center of their mass.
[2:41:46.760 --> 2:41:56.760]  But watching us be turned into domesticated cattle makes me sick. So a gaggle of steroid heads can rule over us. Go ahead and play it.
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:42:01.760]  It's like I'm reliving this stuff. It's really weird. It's not very good to me.
[2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:07.760]  For the first time, a frightened woman hears what a 911 operator says on the other end of her call for help.
[2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:17.760]  When you call 911, you hope you're talking to someone who cares about what happens to you. But an exclusive News Channel 5 investigation has uncovered a shocking 911 emergency.
[2:42:17.760 --> 2:42:25.760]  And what makes it especially shocking is what one call taker says about the woman he's supposed to be helping. Tonight Phil Williams has dug up another exclusive investigation.
[2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:39.760]  You know, 911 workers all across the area do heroic jobs every day under some incredible circumstances. But as you're about to hear, when a national woman needed help the most back in February, the system completely failed.
[2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:43.760]  And so I'm like looking out the window for him and I don't see him.
[2:42:43.760 --> 2:42:48.760]  For Sheila Jones, like, oh God, this is how her call for help began.
[2:42:48.760 --> 2:42:55.760]  At home, he hits the door and he's coming through fast and I'm like this. No, no, no, stop. What are you doing? You didn't call.
[2:42:55.760 --> 2:42:59.760]  It was an angry ex-boyfriend who had barged into her house.
[2:42:59.760 --> 2:43:02.760]  Literally right here is when, bam, he got me.
[2:43:02.760 --> 2:43:10.760]  At Metronashville's 911 center, her first call is recorded at 2.08 p.m.
[2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:28.760]  I felt danger. I felt threatened. I felt fear and I felt, I felt, it was like I was seeing myself being there today, that day.
[2:43:28.760 --> 2:43:30.760]  And you wanted help.
[2:43:30.760 --> 2:43:32.760]  And I wanted help.
[2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:39.760]  For Sheila, hearing that call obtained by News Channel 5 investigates, resurrects the painful emotions of that day.
[2:43:39.760 --> 2:43:41.760]  Get out of my house. Is he a boyfriend?
[2:43:41.760 --> 2:43:44.760]  He ain't. Get out of my house.
[2:43:44.760 --> 2:43:46.760]  He's in that white eye.
[2:43:46.760 --> 2:43:49.760]  He's outside now. He is when outside.
[2:43:49.760 --> 2:43:53.760]  You're emotional. You're desperate. You call for help. Then what happened?
[2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:55.760]  Nothing.
[2:43:55.760 --> 2:43:59.760]  He told me, look, watch out. I ain't gonna see him when he calls.
[2:43:59.760 --> 2:44:07.760]  In fact, get this. Sheila's 911 ordeal drags on for almost three hours through call after call.
[2:44:07.760 --> 2:44:12.760]  They just keep on saying they in route, they in route, but they ain't came. It's been a long time.
[2:44:12.760 --> 2:44:15.760]  And he keeps calling me, threatening me.
[2:44:15.760 --> 2:44:20.760]  Alright, I'll see where he's called and I'm gonna update him and let him know what all you've told me, okay?
[2:44:20.760 --> 2:44:21.760]  Yes, ma'am.
[2:44:21.760 --> 2:44:32.760]  Got one call that said they were in route to you and a more important call came up so they diverted to that call.
[2:44:32.760 --> 2:44:38.760]  I'm saying a knife, my life. I'm wondering what kind of call they got.
[2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:40.760]  Was somebody actually dead then or something?
[2:44:40.760 --> 2:44:42.760]  So where was the officer?
[2:44:42.760 --> 2:44:48.760]  Well, our investigation discovered he was out helping another officer on a traffic stop.
[2:44:48.760 --> 2:44:52.760]  A traffic stop. Never showed up.
[2:44:52.760 --> 2:44:57.760]  All while Sheila was praying for somebody, anybody to help her.
[2:44:57.760 --> 2:44:59.760]  And so ugly.
[2:44:59.760 --> 2:45:02.760]  Go ahead and pause.
[2:45:02.760 --> 2:45:04.760]  It's like that Dick Curlis song.
[2:45:04.760 --> 2:45:08.760]  Go ahead and pause. It's like that Dick Curlis song we played earlier today.
[2:45:08.760 --> 2:45:13.760]  Woman gets mugged in the heart of town, calls for the cops, but there's none around.
[2:45:13.760 --> 2:45:17.760]  They're out on the interstate, setting the trap.
[2:45:17.760 --> 2:45:19.760]  Go ahead and go back to it.
[2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:21.760]  It feels like it just happened.
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:25.760]  That's how I feel right now, like it just happened just now.
[2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:28.760]  Had to know that they were driving stuff over there.
[2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:30.760]  Sheila down.
[2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:34.760]  Then almost two and a half hours in, Sheila calls again.
[2:45:34.760 --> 2:45:38.760]  This time she's told there's no one assigned to answer her call.
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:40.760]  Ain't nobody coming out here?
[2:45:40.760 --> 2:45:43.760]  Yeah, Sam soon as we started to get an officer available, he doesn't send somebody out there.
[2:45:43.760 --> 2:45:47.760]  What do y'all want to kill me so you can put yellow paper around the inside?
[2:45:47.760 --> 2:45:51.760]  We got there just for the dance. Is that it? I don't want to stay here.
[2:45:51.760 --> 2:45:55.760]  It felt like I was a test person, you know, the test subject.
[2:45:55.760 --> 2:45:59.760]  We're going to see how long it takes for him to go back and ask to kill her.
[2:45:59.760 --> 2:46:01.760]  That's what I felt like.
[2:46:01.760 --> 2:46:04.760]  And Sheila had not heard what we had heard.
[2:46:04.760 --> 2:46:06.760]  I don't understand it.
[2:46:06.760 --> 2:46:09.760]  What the 911 call taker says after she hangs up.
[2:46:09.760 --> 2:46:12.760]  I'm scared, they only got my f***ing out.
[2:46:12.760 --> 2:46:20.760]  Okay ma'am, I'll update you to find out if that's going to work out as soon as possible.
[2:46:20.760 --> 2:46:23.760]  I really just don't give a s*** what happens, yeah.
[2:46:23.760 --> 2:46:26.760]  People, he got asked on his phones.
[2:46:26.760 --> 2:46:28.760]  All right.
[2:46:28.760 --> 2:46:30.760]  That's enough.
[2:46:30.760 --> 2:46:35.760]  There are hundreds of cases, you can just Google it, where the woman calls and says he's busting down the door.
[2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:41.760]  He has a gun, he has a knife, and they just hang up on you or say I don't believe it or don't come.
[2:46:41.760 --> 2:46:45.760]  But look, what type of chicken neck society is this?
[2:46:45.760 --> 2:46:49.760]  What type of domesticated, cowardly, pathetic home of the free land of the brave,
[2:46:49.760 --> 2:46:55.760]  where they trained us decades ago, you dial this number, now they have the Tattle 311.
[2:46:55.760 --> 2:47:00.760]  That's the Tattle number, the Stasi number, the East German Tattletale number, the Snitch number.
[2:47:00.760 --> 2:47:08.760]  But the 911, do, do, do, do, oh help me, there go help me, emergency, oh.
[2:47:08.760 --> 2:47:11.760]  And they don't come.
[2:47:11.760 --> 2:47:13.760]  They don't come.
[2:47:13.760 --> 2:47:18.760]  And it's great, I mean the fire department comes, the police come, they try, I'm not saying you're even bad.
[2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:20.760]  The point is 11 minutes.
[2:47:20.760 --> 2:47:25.760]  In fact, we looked that number up, average 911 call time.
[2:47:25.760 --> 2:47:27.760]  I forgot to do that earlier.
[2:47:27.760 --> 2:47:29.760]  Did you do that?
[2:47:29.760 --> 2:47:30.760]  Eight to 11 minutes.
[2:47:30.760 --> 2:47:31.760]  Okay, so my memory was right.
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:34.760]  I remember the national average was like eight and a half minutes.
[2:47:34.760 --> 2:47:35.760]  Eight to 11 minutes.
[2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:38.760]  And I guarantee you those are cook numbers, it's worse.
[2:47:38.760 --> 2:47:47.760]  The Jones house, I mean, somebody bust down my door and they got a knife guaranteed you're dead.
[2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:52.760]  And if I can't get to my gun, I'm going to attack you savagely.
[2:47:52.760 --> 2:47:56.760]  I mean, you're going to think you got a rhinoceros attacking you.
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:47:57.760]  Because it's an instinct.
[2:47:57.760 --> 2:48:01.760]  I am going to attack somebody comes in my nest, comes down my hole.
[2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:03.760]  I mean, any mammal does that.
[2:48:03.760 --> 2:48:07.760]  You people don't have your instincts in line.
[2:48:07.760 --> 2:48:09.760]  Oh man.
[2:48:09.760 --> 2:48:11.760]  Now, let's, let's go to this other club.
[2:48:11.760 --> 2:48:14.760]  This is the local news.
[2:48:14.760 --> 2:48:20.760]  This is a case where gun owners protest police action, the times tribune.
[2:48:20.760 --> 2:48:29.760]  And this is out of Dixon city, a Friday evening police incident spilled over into a borough council with this is Pennsylvania.
[2:48:29.760 --> 2:48:39.760]  Yeah, Tuesday when gun rights advocates allegedly harassed by two police officers, the regular monthly meeting erupted into a full blown debate on the second amendment with more than 20 Pennsylvania fire
[2:48:39.760 --> 2:48:44.760]  owners, association members, many of whom were openly armed to argue that they're right to carry a weapon in public.
[2:48:44.760 --> 2:48:45.760]  Yeah, English common law.
[2:48:45.760 --> 2:48:47.760]  You got to wear the weapon in the open.
[2:48:47.760 --> 2:48:48.760]  It's the concealed.
[2:48:48.760 --> 2:48:53.760]  They trick you and say, oh, we got a permit for a concealed.
[2:48:53.760 --> 2:48:54.760]  And the cops don't know this.
[2:48:54.760 --> 2:49:00.760]  I'm not saying you're tricking anybody, but the lawyers are clear on this under Anglo-Saxon under mosaic law.
[2:49:00.760 --> 2:49:02.760]  It's the same in both laws.
[2:49:02.760 --> 2:49:04.760]  It's ancient law.
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:05.760]  You can have a weapon.
[2:49:05.760 --> 2:49:07.760]  It just has got to be out in the open.
[2:49:07.760 --> 2:49:11.760]  There's only assassins and thieves and people hide a weapon traditionally.
[2:49:11.760 --> 2:49:14.760]  So the point is, I got a weapon and that's meant to deter crime too.
[2:49:14.760 --> 2:49:18.760]  That's why you're also supposed to show the sword, the dagger, the musket, the whatever.
[2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:22.760]  Openly bearing arms, keep and bear arms.
[2:49:22.760 --> 2:49:25.760]  We have a right to keep and bear them.
[2:49:25.760 --> 2:49:30.760]  Under law, you're not allowed to conceal.
[2:49:30.760 --> 2:49:35.760]  This is our common law, ladies and gentlemen, in case you didn't know, it's the concealing.
[2:49:35.760 --> 2:49:40.760]  The government only had the true purview under common law to restrict concealed.
[2:49:40.760 --> 2:49:44.760]  So they tell you, oh, come get a permit for a concealed.
[2:49:44.760 --> 2:49:50.760]  A permit is a right to do something that would be illegal otherwise.
[2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:51.760]  It is.
[2:49:51.760 --> 2:49:53.760]  It's illegal to hunt in the King's Forest.
[2:49:53.760 --> 2:49:56.760]  You get a license, a signet, a letter of mark from him.
[2:49:56.760 --> 2:49:57.760]  That's what a license is.
[2:49:57.760 --> 2:50:00.760]  So see how these lawyers know what they're doing.
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:04.760]  They trick you into going and then doing something that is illegal.
[2:50:04.760 --> 2:50:06.760]  Well, these guys all know.
[2:50:06.760 --> 2:50:08.760]  So they're wearing guns openly.
[2:50:08.760 --> 2:50:09.760]  And they do this.
[2:50:09.760 --> 2:50:11.760]  This is an attempt to take the Second Amendment back.
[2:50:11.760 --> 2:50:14.760]  Instead of having carpet cleaners call the police on you because you got a gun case,
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:18.760]  because they watch TV shows all featured based in New York where guns are banned.
[2:50:18.760 --> 2:50:21.760]  How many cop shows will they pull you over and go, he's got a gun?
[2:50:21.760 --> 2:50:22.760]  Oh, no permit for this.
[2:50:22.760 --> 2:50:23.760]  That's 10 years, buddy.
[2:50:23.760 --> 2:50:27.760]  See little TV heads that mommy didn't teach him how to brush their teeth.
[2:50:27.760 --> 2:50:29.760]  They barely know how to tie their shoelaces as adults.
[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:31.760]  You know who I'm talking about, the general public.
[2:50:31.760 --> 2:50:34.760]  You know that all they do is watch NYPD blue.
[2:50:34.760 --> 2:50:37.760]  And then so they're in your house and they think it's illegal.
[2:50:37.760 --> 2:50:42.760]  We got to start wearing them openly because that makes the idiots realize it's our right.
[2:50:42.760 --> 2:50:43.760]  But we'll tell you what happened.
[2:50:43.760 --> 2:50:45.760]  Play the audio and we get back.
[2:50:47.760 --> 2:50:51.760]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:50:51.760 --> 2:50:56.760]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:50:56.760 --> 2:51:02.760]  It's known as the Bilderberg group, but their objective is the world domination.
[2:51:02.760 --> 2:51:05.760]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:51:05.760 --> 2:51:08.760]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[2:51:08.760 --> 2:51:13.760]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:51:16.760 --> 2:51:21.760]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:51:21.760 --> 2:51:25.760]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:51:25.760 --> 2:51:28.760]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[2:51:28.760 --> 2:51:29.760]  Most people have no idea.
[2:51:29.760 --> 2:51:30.760]  They're not after money.
[2:51:30.760 --> 2:51:31.760]  They have all the money they need.
[2:51:31.760 --> 2:51:32.760]  They're after power.
[2:51:32.760 --> 2:51:33.760]  That's their affidavit.

[2:51:42.760 --> 2:51:45.760]  In-game, blue prep for global enslavement.
[2:51:45.760 --> 2:51:46.760]  You have been warned.
[2:51:46.760 --> 2:51:49.760]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases
[2:51:49.760 --> 2:51:52.760]  cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[2:51:52.760 --> 2:51:57.760]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[2:51:57.760 --> 2:52:03.760]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[2:52:03.760 --> 2:52:09.760]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[2:52:09.760 --> 2:52:12.760]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[2:52:12.760 --> 2:52:15.760]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[2:52:15.760 --> 2:52:19.760]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[2:52:19.760 --> 2:52:24.760]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[2:52:24.760 --> 2:52:25.760]  Do your part.
[2:52:25.760 --> 2:52:27.760]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[2:52:27.760 --> 2:52:31.760]  Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate
[2:52:31.760 --> 2:52:37.760]  that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[2:52:37.760 --> 2:52:43.760]  Order your bottle of Alkavision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[2:52:43.760 --> 2:52:46.760]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[2:52:46.760 --> 2:52:50.760]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[2:52:50.760 --> 2:52:55.760]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[2:52:55.760 --> 2:53:00.760]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[2:53:00.760 --> 2:53:04.760]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system,
[2:53:04.760 --> 2:53:09.760]  protect a complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition,
[2:53:09.760 --> 2:53:11.760]  improving mileage in only one tank full.
[2:53:11.760 --> 2:53:16.760]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine.
[2:53:16.760 --> 2:53:17.760]  Let's face it.
[2:53:17.760 --> 2:53:20.760]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[2:53:20.760 --> 2:53:25.760]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment,
[2:53:25.760 --> 2:53:28.760]  which is a $12.95 value free.
[2:53:28.760 --> 2:53:30.760]  Call triple eight, use SFR1.
[2:53:30.760 --> 2:53:32.760]  That number again is triple eight.
[2:53:32.760 --> 2:53:37.760]  Use SFR1 or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[2:53:37.760 --> 2:53:39.760]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[2:53:39.760 --> 2:53:45.760]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back, and it's safe for all cars. Act now.
[2:53:50.760 --> 2:53:55.760]  Look, I didn't come up with the idea to do this money bomb, and I appreciate the folks that are doing it.
[2:53:55.760 --> 2:53:57.760]  I don't ask for donations on air.
[2:53:57.760 --> 2:53:59.760]  Listeners know that.
[2:53:59.760 --> 2:54:01.760]  I get some.
[2:54:01.760 --> 2:54:05.760]  They've really helped us do a better job around here.
[2:54:05.760 --> 2:54:13.760]  I ask you to donate by buying our books, our videos, the stuff at infowars.com, gettingaprisonplanet.tv membership.
[2:54:13.760 --> 2:54:19.760]  But folks did set up a money bomb for May 31st at infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[2:54:19.760 --> 2:54:23.760]  We're going to put a PayPal link up on that site soon.
[2:54:23.760 --> 2:54:30.760]  I want to get whoever runs it, and I think we're figuring that out, exactly who, on the show in the next few days.
[2:54:30.760 --> 2:54:36.760]  I've got the Voluntary Human Extinction people on the Sunday show. You don't want to miss that. They think we should all die.
[2:54:36.760 --> 2:54:40.760]  So we'll have one of those people on for you on the Sunday show.
[2:54:40.760 --> 2:54:45.760]  But I do hope that everybody goes and pledges. I didn't come up with this $100 pledge.
[2:54:45.760 --> 2:54:51.760]  I'm not bashing it. I'm just saying maybe we should just say you can pledge $1 or you can pledge $10.
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:54.760]  I mean, most people don't have $100.
[2:54:54.760 --> 2:54:59.760]  And again, somebody does a money bomb. Ron Paul didn't ask for one. They just did it.
[2:54:59.760 --> 2:55:04.760]  And a lot of people are frothing with jealousy, thinking I'm going to get a million dollars. Believe me, we're not, folks.
[2:55:04.760 --> 2:55:07.760]  The kind of the Ron Paul super burn is over.
[2:55:07.760 --> 2:55:14.760]  But we raised $20,000. It'd be great. I'd buy a couple new computers, some cameras, free up some money I've got.
[2:55:14.760 --> 2:55:16.760]  I'm already going to get a bigger office.
[2:55:16.760 --> 2:55:23.760]  Am I already moving to look into TV production the next few months to develop something to put on Dish TV and stuff?
[2:55:23.760 --> 2:55:27.760]  People think it's going to be Valhalla. It's not, but it's certainly going to help.
[2:55:27.760 --> 2:55:30.760]  And we're always expanding, always growing here.
[2:55:30.760 --> 2:55:35.760]  And so we try to use the sponsors, the products we sell to fund our operation.
[2:55:35.760 --> 2:55:38.760]  And I've got 14 employees. It's not cheap.
[2:55:38.760 --> 2:55:41.760]  But I don't beat the dead horse of give me money, give me money, give me money.
[2:55:41.760 --> 2:55:45.760]  In fact, I've done the whole show today and haven't plugged my videos live on air.
[2:55:45.760 --> 2:55:51.760]  I really should because they're a great solution to wake people up to not just our funding mechanism,
[2:55:51.760 --> 2:55:57.760]  but infowarsmoneybomb.com. So many people pledged it broke the counter.
[2:55:57.760 --> 2:55:59.760]  The counter only went to a hundred.
[2:55:59.760 --> 2:56:01.760]  And so they need to work on that.
[2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:03.760]  But it's a great looking site.
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:05.760]  And I just hope you'll go pledge.
[2:56:05.760 --> 2:56:10.760]  And I hope you'll do it May 31st or our enemies will celebrate and go, oh, look, Ron Paul,
[2:56:10.760 --> 2:56:14.760]  I know the show raised a million dollars of the millions he raised of the 15 million he raised.
[2:56:14.760 --> 2:56:22.760]  I know that we've raised, you know, so like a still like 15 grand and and we are changed like 10 grand and we do that.
[2:56:22.760 --> 2:56:25.760]  We're also a platform to support other people.
[2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:27.760]  You are the part of that platform.
[2:56:27.760 --> 2:56:30.760]  So I don't know what to say.
[2:56:30.760 --> 2:56:35.760]  I mean, I'm not going to let a money bomb go and then have it fizzle and that would look bad for all of us.
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:37.760]  But I didn't think up this money bomb.
[2:56:37.760 --> 2:56:42.760]  And so I'm kind of a reluctant volunteer here.
[2:56:42.760 --> 2:56:50.760]  But yes, I give you my word that 100% of the money from this money bomb and not 100% of the money I make off selling videos.
[2:56:50.760 --> 2:56:54.760]  My wife's got to have a car to drive and food and clothes for my kids and I give the videos out for free.
[2:56:54.760 --> 2:56:56.760]  I mean, there's nothing good enough for some people.
[2:56:56.760 --> 2:57:06.760]  But the money bomb 100% of the money will go into this office into equipment, into upgrades, into things we need.
[2:57:06.760 --> 2:57:11.760]  And there are a lot of growing pains right now and I'm only trying to intensify what we're doing.
[2:57:11.760 --> 2:57:18.760]  And I've told listeners, if you just want to mail me a check and a donation, because I just see every other weirdo and crazy getting donations,
[2:57:18.760 --> 2:57:20.760]  I might as well because I know I'm going to fight the new world order.
[2:57:20.760 --> 2:57:24.760]  I mean, if you're hell bent on sending donations, write it out to Alex Jones.
[2:57:24.760 --> 2:57:28.760]  And if you say I want 100% of this to go to the fight, it'll go to that.
[2:57:28.760 --> 2:57:31.760]  I've got a few donations where it says, spend this on yourself.
[2:57:31.760 --> 2:57:32.760]  And I've actually done it.
[2:57:32.760 --> 2:57:39.760]  Okay, honey, let's go to a condo for the weekend with the kids or, you know, I mean, I'm not into material things.
[2:57:39.760 --> 2:57:44.760]  So it's kind of a catch-22 because then I don't money grub enough to then have the funds I need.
[2:57:44.760 --> 2:57:48.760]  I mean, I literally forget to plug sponsors, forget to plug my videos.
[2:57:48.760 --> 2:57:50.760]  I mean, I've done three hours and haven't done any of it.
[2:57:50.760 --> 2:57:55.760]  You know, you hear some of the ads playing, but what really gets response is the live on air stuff.
[2:57:55.760 --> 2:58:03.760]  So in closing for this hour, fourth hour coming up, and I promise I'll get your calls after I play this clip of the gun situation.
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:12.760]  I just hope that you will visit infowars.com, prisonplanet.com. I hope you'll get a prisonplanet.tv membership for $0.50 a day.

[2:58:17.760 --> 2:58:18.760]  Like people up.
[2:58:18.760 --> 2:58:19.760]  Okay, I know you've been holding a long time.
[2:58:19.760 --> 2:58:25.760]  We're going to come back in the short segment, play the anti-gun ninning, then go to your calls.

[3:00:10.760 --> 3:00:13.760]  Every day in the New Fourth Hour, we've been doing for over a month now.
[3:00:13.760 --> 3:00:22.760]  We go live with the document cam, the cam on myself, the guest cam, we have guest video feeds, audio feeds from the computer,
[3:00:22.760 --> 3:00:25.760]  video exclusives for prisonplanet.tv members.
[3:00:25.760 --> 3:00:32.760]  Of course everybody can listen out there on the AM and FM dial, shortwave, global satellite, and the internet at infowars.com.
[3:00:32.760 --> 3:00:37.760]  So earlier in the last hour, we played that poor woman crying, screaming, begging.
[3:00:37.760 --> 3:00:42.760]  As this guy's in her house, threatening her with a knife for hours.
[3:00:42.760 --> 3:00:47.760]  And then you hear the 911 caller say, I don't care what happens to you, lady.
[3:00:47.760 --> 3:00:53.760]  Okay, so you've got that reality there, the average response times 8 to 11 minutes, depending on what part of the country.
[3:00:53.760 --> 3:00:56.760]  And with 911.
[3:00:56.760 --> 3:01:02.760]  Or that areas where they have gun bans for the citizens, crimes exponentially higher or that England's banned all guns.
[3:01:02.760 --> 3:01:05.760]  And now it's just guns everywhere and bedlam and murder.
[3:01:05.760 --> 3:01:07.760]  And that's in the news today.
[3:01:07.760 --> 3:01:16.760]  This is a newscast out of Pennsylvania where you have these gun rights groups that go around with guns holstered and the police come and grab them, arrest them, take their guns.
[3:01:16.760 --> 3:01:19.760]  And then they go to city council and they've got their guns.
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:25.760]  And where they're still under common law and the cowardly public is just flipping out in fear.
[3:01:25.760 --> 3:01:29.760]  But they trust the corrupt government and the police with guns.
[3:01:29.760 --> 3:01:31.760]  Now, again, I think police should have guns.
[3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:33.760]  I just don't try to take mine.
[3:01:33.760 --> 3:01:38.760]  Point in statistically, you have more criminals in law enforcement than you do in the general public.
[3:01:38.760 --> 3:01:39.760]  And that's criminology 101.
[3:01:39.760 --> 3:01:41.760]  I'm sorry that I've read the textbooks.
[3:01:41.760 --> 3:01:42.760]  So let's go ahead and roll this.
[3:01:42.760 --> 3:01:49.760]  You want to live your life as a free man and be able to say the things that are guaranteed to you under the First Amendment.
[3:01:49.760 --> 3:02:01.760]  You don't want to stop it, you know, why don't I just go to infowars.com and why don't I just play the video so all the viewers could actually watch it.
[3:02:01.760 --> 3:02:09.760]  I keep forgetting that for a prisonplanet.tv members that this show is interactive.
[3:02:09.760 --> 3:02:11.760]  I just keep forgetting that.
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:22.760]  Oh, no, there's so many stories here that I may not be able to find that an emo post so many stories that he post like 50 times a day, which is great.
[3:02:22.760 --> 3:02:32.760]  But it scrolls through so fast that in the top stories, it's already who knows where in Timbuktu or something.
[3:02:32.760 --> 3:02:37.760]  Speeders force face 10 years in prison.
[3:02:37.760 --> 3:02:39.760]  Gun owners protest police action.
[3:02:39.760 --> 3:02:42.760]  Okay, sorry, folks.
[3:02:42.760 --> 3:02:44.760]  I'm really sorry.
[3:02:44.760 --> 3:02:46.760]  Oh, I just had it.
[3:02:46.760 --> 3:02:47.760]  There we go.
[3:02:47.760 --> 3:02:49.760]  Let's go ahead and click on that.
[3:02:49.760 --> 3:02:54.760]  And we'll go ahead and play this just off my computer here for everybody.
[3:02:54.760 --> 3:02:58.760]  Sorry, I'm getting all my wonderful internet connection here.
[3:02:58.760 --> 3:03:00.760]  It's not loading.
[3:03:00.760 --> 3:03:06.760]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:03:06.760 --> 3:03:16.760]  If you want to live your life as a free man and be able to say the things that are guaranteed to you under the First Amendment, then you need to be able to exercise your Second Amendment.
[3:03:16.760 --> 3:03:18.760]  It ain't about hunting.
[3:03:18.760 --> 3:03:20.760]  And it's not even really about self-defense.
[3:03:20.760 --> 3:03:23.760]  It's about protecting us from overbearing government.
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:27.760]  And what was seen up here on Friday night was overbearing government.
[3:03:27.760 --> 3:03:33.760]  When they can come in and do whatever they want, regardless of what the law says, that is overbearing government.
[3:03:33.760 --> 3:03:37.760]  I would like to have input from different city residents first.
[3:03:37.760 --> 3:03:39.760]  I'd like to give them that courtesy.
[3:03:39.760 --> 3:03:48.760]  And then after that, I have a signing sheet for all of the members of the organization that would like to speak.
[3:03:48.760 --> 3:03:50.760]  I will ask Paul each of you by name.
[3:03:50.760 --> 3:03:52.760]  I will ask you to come up to the podium.
[3:03:52.760 --> 3:03:55.760]  And this will be a kind of session only.
[3:03:55.760 --> 3:03:57.760]  I'll be in question and answer session.
[3:03:57.760 --> 3:04:01.760]  And we'll each give you two minutes to make your comments to council.
[3:04:01.760 --> 3:04:04.760]  And we're glad to listen to anything you have to say.
[3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:09.760]  So right now, on this side of the audience, is there anything for getting you to do some city residents?
[3:04:09.760 --> 3:04:15.760]  Well, I feel a little bit tempted to come in for a council meeting to see if people with guns on them.
[3:04:15.760 --> 3:04:16.760]  Yes.
[3:04:16.760 --> 3:04:19.760]  You don't record house or any other public building.
[3:04:19.760 --> 3:04:23.760]  You go through x-ray machines and airports and everything else.
[3:04:23.760 --> 3:04:26.760]  You can't go to these places with guns.
[3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:37.760]  We're going to come back and go to the sky going, we need to have scanners like airports everywhere.
[3:04:37.760 --> 3:04:39.760]  We can't have sentences with guns.
[3:04:39.760 --> 3:04:44.760]  I'm scared of guns.
[3:04:44.760 --> 3:04:47.760]  It is a big idea.
[3:04:47.760 --> 3:04:49.760]  A new world order.
[3:04:49.760 --> 3:04:54.760]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:04:54.760 --> 3:04:57.760]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[3:04:57.760 --> 3:05:00.760]  What their objective would be world domination?
[3:05:00.760 --> 3:05:03.760]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:05:03.760 --> 3:05:13.760]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:05:13.760 --> 3:05:19.760]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:05:19.760 --> 3:05:23.760]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:05:23.760 --> 3:05:25.760]  America is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:05:25.760 --> 3:05:26.760]  Most people have no idea.
[3:05:26.760 --> 3:05:27.760]  They're not after money.
[3:05:27.760 --> 3:05:28.760]  They have all the money they need.
[3:05:28.760 --> 3:05:29.760]  They're after power.
[3:05:29.760 --> 3:05:30.760]  That's their affidavit.

[3:06:47.760 --> 3:06:49.760]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship.
[3:06:49.760 --> 3:06:53.760]  Martial law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[3:06:53.760 --> 3:06:55.760]  It's going to be incremental.
[3:06:55.760 --> 3:06:57.760]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[3:06:57.760 --> 3:07:00.760]  Any incidents small or large could trigger a total takeover.
[3:07:00.760 --> 3:07:02.760]  Anything could be the final push.

[3:07:15.760 --> 3:07:22.760]  When martial law is officially announced, checkpoints will be enforced, gun confiscations will occur for registered gun owners and cities will be on lockdown.
[3:07:22.760 --> 3:07:26.760]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years preparing for this takeover.

[3:08:08.760 --> 3:08:11.760]  Going toe-to-toe with the New World Order.
[3:08:14.760 --> 3:08:16.760]  Yep, that's us. Thank you for joining us.
[3:08:16.760 --> 3:08:18.760]  I am out of control today not taking your calls.
[3:08:18.760 --> 3:08:22.760]  I'm going to take masses of calls. That means one an hour.
[3:08:22.760 --> 3:08:24.760]  In just a minute.
[3:08:24.760 --> 3:08:27.760]  But I got to finish up with this and I'm going to go right to them, I promise.
[3:08:27.760 --> 3:08:34.760]  Okay, now listen to this nitty-nguye before the city council where in this town, in this state, it's like it used to be.
[3:08:34.760 --> 3:08:39.760]  Now, I used to read about trials. Everybody would go to trials even in like 1920 and 30 all over the country.
[3:08:39.760 --> 3:08:42.760]  The famous Limburg trial, they all had their pistols.
[3:08:42.760 --> 3:08:47.760]  And that was back when the people were the boss and you have no crime to really speak of.
[3:08:47.760 --> 3:08:51.760]  I mean, they would hype up, you know, bank robberies were like nationwide news.
[3:08:51.760 --> 3:08:56.760]  Because, I mean, crooks, this country, they were totally, it was just, you got hunted down.
[3:08:56.760 --> 3:08:59.760]  And the cops needed help. They'd knock on your door, help me get this guy.
[3:08:59.760 --> 3:09:03.760]  In fact, they demanded you help them back then. There was so much trust between people.
[3:09:03.760 --> 3:09:07.760]  I mean, you know, men didn't have to be, I mean, they were looking for a fugitive.
[3:09:07.760 --> 3:09:12.760]  Even when my mom was a little kid in Austin, people would get out of jail and have a jailbreak every once in a while.
[3:09:12.760 --> 3:09:16.760]  And the police would come driving down the street and, you know, they'd get out of their cars.
[3:09:16.760 --> 3:09:18.760]  Have you seen anybody come help us? Look for them.
[3:09:18.760 --> 3:09:23.760]  But see, now it's the opposite. It's look for imaginary terrorists, tattle on neighbors that spanked their kids.
[3:09:23.760 --> 3:09:25.760]  You know, it's stuff like that.
[3:09:25.760 --> 3:09:31.760]  Instead of, you never see the cops until there's a crime and then the cops go crazy like fire ants looking for the criminal.
[3:09:31.760 --> 3:09:34.760]  Now they won't persecute or go after the criminals.
[3:09:34.760 --> 3:09:39.760]  40 and slip. I want them to persecute the criminals, but, but they persecute us.
[3:09:39.760 --> 3:09:43.760]  By the way, what was that Grand Theft Auto edit yesterday? I want to play that audio.
[3:09:43.760 --> 3:09:47.760]  Did you send that? Aaron, can you give that to me? I want to play that later.
[3:09:47.760 --> 3:09:50.760]  Oh, okay. Let's just go ahead and play this from the city council.
[3:09:50.760 --> 3:09:55.760]  They got scanners and airports in control. I don't want citizens armed here.
[3:09:55.760 --> 3:10:00.760]  It's scary to me. It intimidates me to have citizens armed.
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:02.760]  Oh, it's horrible.
[3:10:02.760 --> 3:10:05.760]  So here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:10:05.760 --> 3:10:11.760]  I feel a little intimidated coming to a console meeting and seeing people with guns on their hips.
[3:10:11.760 --> 3:10:18.760]  You go to a courthouse or any other public building. You go through x-ray machines and airports and everything else.
[3:10:18.760 --> 3:10:24.760]  You can't go to these places because this is a government attendee.
[3:10:24.760 --> 3:10:31.760]  I don't see why these men are standing here with siders. They're not police officers, to my opinion.
[3:10:31.760 --> 3:10:36.760]  To me, I don't know them for a matter. And probably a restaurant in the Dixon city, too.
[3:10:36.760 --> 3:10:40.760]  It's their business. They're serving public and family restaurants.
[3:10:40.760 --> 3:10:47.760]  Why should I go to a restaurant with my children or anything and see a guy sitting here with a sider?
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:53.760]  You guys are very intimidating standing here. And I don't believe you should be here with guns on.
[3:10:53.760 --> 3:10:55.760]  Anything else?
[3:10:55.760 --> 3:10:58.760]  I'm not a member of the bar. I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[3:10:58.760 --> 3:11:02.760]  I'd like to ask for help, though, on the matter of greatest importance.
[3:11:02.760 --> 3:11:13.760]  As we know on Friday, a group of my fellow organization members were embarrassed, oppressed, harassed, and violated by members of our police force.
[3:11:13.760 --> 3:11:20.760]  The officers involved perpetrated a systematic and calculated criminal violation of my fellow members' rights.
[3:11:20.760 --> 3:11:27.760]  They arrived at the old country buffet in Dixon City, responding to a call about people having a gun in the open.
[3:11:27.760 --> 3:11:33.760]  After arriving on the scene, instead of ascertaining that no illegal activity was going on,
[3:11:33.760 --> 3:11:38.760]  they began systematically to remove patrons from the restaurant with no compelling reason to do so.
[3:11:38.760 --> 3:11:50.760]  As these innocent patrons' families watched and feared, these citizens were illegally detained, illegally searched, and had their possessions illegally seized.
[3:11:50.760 --> 3:11:57.760]  Alright, so that's basically what happened. And this is how they operate in the new system.
[3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:01.760]  Now, the media there was like zooming in on these guys with side arms going,
[3:12:01.760 --> 3:12:08.760]  oh my gosh, and citizens are pointing like, oh my god.
[3:12:08.760 --> 3:12:18.760]  But then they see guys in black camo with their pants bloused into their combat boots with German shepherds bugging their eyes out.
[3:12:18.760 --> 3:12:22.760]  They go, oh, I feel so safe, and this is so scary.
[3:12:22.760 --> 3:12:28.760]  You understand the most dangerous thing in history is government.
[3:12:28.760 --> 3:12:31.880]  statistically it's the most criminal thing.
[3:12:31.880 --> 3:12:34.360]  I mean, that's universally known in political science
[3:12:34.360 --> 3:12:37.560]  that is an absolute fact, undeniable, undeniable.
[3:12:37.560 --> 3:12:39.680]  A psychopaths rotate towards law enforcement
[3:12:39.680 --> 3:12:40.760]  and towards government.
[3:12:40.760 --> 3:12:42.160]  Does that mean all of them are that?
[3:12:42.160 --> 3:12:43.000]  No.
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:44.360]  Does that mean even a large minority are?
[3:12:44.360 --> 3:12:45.360]  No.
[3:12:45.360 --> 3:12:47.880]  But does it mean that there is a key minority of them
[3:12:47.880 --> 3:12:49.960]  but that many times more statistically
[3:12:49.960 --> 3:12:51.320]  than the general population?
[3:12:51.320 --> 3:12:52.720]  Yes.
[3:12:52.720 --> 3:12:58.960]  That's basic criminology and I'm tired of the denials.
[3:12:58.960 --> 3:13:01.240]  We need to get back to the point where people, now,
[3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:04.600]  I'll be honest with you.
[3:13:04.600 --> 3:13:09.280]  Quite frankly, it offends me when
[3:13:09.280 --> 3:13:11.320]  I see police going around with machine guns
[3:13:11.320 --> 3:13:13.600]  and with automatic, you know, semi-automatic rifles
[3:13:13.600 --> 3:13:15.880]  and in camo and armored vehicles.
[3:13:15.880 --> 3:13:17.280]  It is militarized.
[3:13:17.280 --> 3:13:20.480]  Like if I go on a vacation, I saw a thing on TV
[3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:22.160]  about cruise ships where they don't want to arm them
[3:13:22.160 --> 3:13:24.320]  against pirates that do get attacked sometimes,
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:27.080]  modern-day pirates, because it's offensive to people.
[3:13:27.080 --> 3:13:29.760]  They don't want to be seeing guys in black uniforms walking
[3:13:29.760 --> 3:13:32.440]  around with German shepherds and machine guns
[3:13:32.440 --> 3:13:33.600]  when you're out on your cruise.
[3:13:33.600 --> 3:13:34.880]  You don't want to think about that.
[3:13:34.880 --> 3:13:36.480]  And I've been on a couple of cruises, by the way.
[3:13:36.480 --> 3:13:37.760]  I wish I had time to go on one.
[3:13:37.760 --> 3:13:39.640]  But this was about like cruises off Africa
[3:13:39.640 --> 3:13:43.320]  where they get attacked in Asia, the big fancy ones.
[3:13:43.320 --> 3:13:46.120]  But people don't want to see that.
[3:13:46.120 --> 3:13:47.200]  They don't want to be around it.
[3:13:47.200 --> 3:13:50.040]  And it's not that I'm afraid of guns or don't like guns.
[3:13:50.040 --> 3:13:52.480]  You know, I mean, I know it was 50 years ago
[3:13:52.480 --> 3:13:54.560]  when I saw a cop in a nice fancy blue uniform,
[3:13:54.560 --> 3:13:56.240]  dressed nice, professional.
[3:13:56.240 --> 3:13:58.360]  See, that's why I put them in black monkey outfits
[3:13:58.360 --> 3:14:00.440]  with ball caps so they don't act professional.
[3:14:00.440 --> 3:14:03.080]  Then I probably would feel good, actually.
[3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:04.760]  Because, you know, statistically back then,
[3:14:04.760 --> 3:14:06.920]  and I've looked at those numbers, they were a lot better.
[3:14:06.920 --> 3:14:07.760]  They weren't perfect.
[3:14:07.760 --> 3:14:09.000]  You still had some bad counties,
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:10.280]  but pretty much cops were good.
[3:14:10.280 --> 3:14:12.480]  And that's why people liked them and they were friendly
[3:14:12.480 --> 3:14:13.880]  and they knew everybody.
[3:14:13.880 --> 3:14:15.880]  But man, when a crime happened, they went ape
[3:14:15.880 --> 3:14:18.560]  because they, you know, this is their community.
[3:14:18.560 --> 3:14:20.080]  But then when they shipped it away from that
[3:14:20.080 --> 3:14:22.360]  to revenue generation and law enforcement
[3:14:23.360 --> 3:14:25.680]  and keeping the cattle in line,
[3:14:25.680 --> 3:14:27.480]  and then all gets into the whole philosophy,
[3:14:27.480 --> 3:14:28.320]  the rest of it.
[3:14:28.320 --> 3:14:31.040]  I mean, don't the police wish they wore nice uniforms,
[3:14:31.040 --> 3:14:34.040]  good-looking uniforms, instead of these monkey outfits
[3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:34.880]  you wear?
[3:14:34.880 --> 3:14:36.360]  I mean, I was looking at Canadian cops in Ottawa.
[3:14:36.360 --> 3:14:37.440]  They look sharp.
[3:14:37.440 --> 3:14:38.560]  Like cops used to look here.
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:40.480]  They're like monkeys or something.
[3:14:40.480 --> 3:14:42.360]  But I'm already digressing.
[3:14:42.360 --> 3:14:43.960]  The point is they know the psychology
[3:14:43.960 --> 3:14:46.080]  of how they dress you is how you behave.
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:48.800]  And I think I've said enough on this subject.
[3:14:48.800 --> 3:14:51.600]  It's just that the fact that we've gotten so domesticated
[3:14:51.600 --> 3:14:55.840]  that we've come so far that citizens shake in fear
[3:14:55.840 --> 3:14:56.960]  at the sight of guns.
[3:14:56.960 --> 3:14:59.200]  And I just want to give you an advisory in the U.S.
[3:14:59.200 --> 3:15:01.880]  A lot of cities arrest you a week after a library book
[3:15:01.880 --> 3:15:03.800]  is due and charged you with felonies.
[3:15:03.800 --> 3:15:07.760]  A lot of cities arrest you two days after your video is late
[3:15:07.760 --> 3:15:09.680]  because they need to arrest somebody, folks.
[3:15:09.680 --> 3:15:11.160]  They're not allowed to arrest the illegals
[3:15:11.160 --> 3:15:13.600]  and literally for anything less than felonies.
[3:15:13.600 --> 3:15:15.280]  Drinking, driving and they're allowed to do it.
[3:15:15.280 --> 3:15:16.800]  No ID, no problem.
[3:15:16.800 --> 3:15:18.760]  They're supposed to leave them alone
[3:15:18.760 --> 3:15:20.640]  and you're the fat cattle.
[3:15:20.640 --> 3:15:24.560]  So don't think just because you swiped your credit card
[3:15:24.560 --> 3:15:26.520]  that you paid for gas, make sure you get a receipt
[3:15:26.520 --> 3:15:28.440]  or they'll swat team you.
[3:15:28.440 --> 3:15:29.920]  I see these cases every day, folks.
[3:15:29.920 --> 3:15:32.680]  I'm telling you about real problems here.
[3:15:32.680 --> 3:15:34.800]  If you are putting a rifle on the back of your car
[3:15:34.800 --> 3:15:37.720]  to go deer hunting or to go to the range,
[3:15:37.720 --> 3:15:39.080]  I back my car in the garage.
[3:15:39.080 --> 3:15:41.360]  And it's not that I'm living in fear and a coward.
[3:15:41.360 --> 3:15:43.400]  It's just that these guys can go out on the vanguard
[3:15:43.400 --> 3:15:45.320]  and wear their guns on their sides.
[3:15:45.320 --> 3:15:48.280]  And I know in a way I'm giving into the fear
[3:15:48.280 --> 3:15:51.240]  and the control by pulling my car into load of gun.
[3:15:51.240 --> 3:15:53.720]  But I realize the chicken necks are dangerous, folks.
[3:15:53.720 --> 3:15:55.560]  The chicken necks are everywhere.
[3:15:55.560 --> 3:15:58.080]  And the cops have been trained to respond
[3:15:58.080 --> 3:16:01.040]  to any cowardly, I see a box on the side of the highway.
[3:16:01.040 --> 3:16:04.560]  I think it's an al-Qaeda nuclear bomb with proton missiles
[3:16:04.560 --> 3:16:08.800]  with dinosaurs and Godzilla and 17 flying saucers in it.
[3:16:08.800 --> 3:16:11.520]  But then real threats like Mexican troops attacking
[3:16:11.520 --> 3:16:14.600]  and cross border wars and more rocket attacks this week
[3:16:14.600 --> 3:16:17.440]  and hang grenades and mass death and kidnappings
[3:16:17.440 --> 3:16:20.120]  and slaughter and dead cops back of the paper.
[3:16:22.280 --> 3:16:24.200]  Everything is sick.
[3:16:24.200 --> 3:16:27.280]  It is, I'm living in an insane asylum.
[3:16:27.280 --> 3:16:29.440]  I keep saying it, I can't believe it.
[3:16:30.480 --> 3:16:33.640]  Meanwhile, the Austin police run around with robots,
[3:16:33.640 --> 3:16:35.920]  every cardboard box on the side of the road,
[3:16:35.920 --> 3:16:39.200]  freaking out on the news, training us all to nitty
[3:16:39.200 --> 3:16:41.440]  and run around imaginary al-Qaeda grips.
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:43.400]  All right, now I'm going to calls.
[3:16:43.400 --> 3:16:45.800]  Dave in California, go ahead, thanks for holding.
[3:16:45.800 --> 3:16:47.840]  Hi, Alex, I've got two things that it's really important.
[3:16:47.840 --> 3:16:52.200]  I need you to talk to Officer Booth, please, right away.
[3:16:52.200 --> 3:16:53.160]  Is he there?
[3:16:53.160 --> 3:16:54.280]  Officer Jack Booth?
[3:16:54.280 --> 3:16:55.120]  Yes, sir.
[3:16:55.120 --> 3:16:56.720]  You're trying to conjure Officer Jack Booth?
[3:16:56.720 --> 3:16:57.560]  I need Officer Jack Booth.
[3:16:57.560 --> 3:16:59.840]  Mirror, mirror on the wall.
[3:16:59.840 --> 3:17:02.760]  Show me the Jack Booth-est of them all.
[3:17:04.840 --> 3:17:07.000]  You wanna talk to Officer Jack Booth?
[3:17:07.000 --> 3:17:07.840]  Yes, sir.
[3:17:07.840 --> 3:17:10.680]  I've got to like go back to an imaginary childhood
[3:17:10.680 --> 3:17:12.920]  of being a bully who finally got beat up
[3:17:12.920 --> 3:17:14.560]  by kids that I used to beat up,
[3:17:14.560 --> 3:17:16.880]  and I'm a bully and I'm cowardly,
[3:17:16.880 --> 3:17:18.600]  but I'm into acting masculine,
[3:17:18.600 --> 3:17:21.320]  and I like black uniforms and primitive trappings of power,
[3:17:21.320 --> 3:17:22.840]  and I had a lot of vaccines when I was little,
[3:17:22.840 --> 3:17:24.960]  so my IQ is about 75, hold on.
[3:17:28.400 --> 3:17:32.040]  I don't know, I just don't feel Officer Jack Booth coming.
[3:17:32.040 --> 3:17:32.880]  Okay, what's that?
[3:17:32.880 --> 3:17:33.720]  Hold on, hold on.
[3:17:33.720 --> 3:17:38.720]  Okay, you don't tell me, boy, what to do on my own show.
[3:17:39.520 --> 3:17:42.840]  It's Officer Booth, I have something really important
[3:17:42.840 --> 3:17:44.800]  to report to you, sir.
[3:17:44.800 --> 3:17:46.000]  Please take my report.
[3:17:47.520 --> 3:17:48.360]  Shut up!
[3:17:50.560 --> 3:17:52.680]  But there's boxes.
[3:17:53.600 --> 3:17:54.880]  Boxes?
[3:17:54.880 --> 3:17:56.640]  Where'd you see this box?
[3:17:56.640 --> 3:17:59.800]  Three days ago, sir, in the College of the Redwoods.
[3:17:59.800 --> 3:18:02.840]  Hold on, hold on, let me get the dispatcher.
[3:18:02.840 --> 3:18:05.880]  We saw a box, where was this, was it in Al Qaeda?
[3:18:05.880 --> 3:18:07.440]  Did you see Ben London?
[3:18:07.440 --> 3:18:10.880]  Was he riding, was he riding a flying carpet?
[3:18:10.880 --> 3:18:13.000]  You're a good citizen.
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:15.320]  You want to kiss up to me and act scared?
[3:18:15.320 --> 3:18:16.640]  Yes, sir.
[3:18:16.640 --> 3:18:17.480]  That's better.
[3:18:18.520 --> 3:18:21.520]  But it was, but it, it's a box!
[3:18:23.160 --> 3:18:25.520]  Oh, man, good to hear from you, Dave,
[3:18:25.520 --> 3:18:26.720]  I really appreciate it.
[3:18:27.960 --> 3:18:29.920]  But we have to learn to be ninnying and afraid.
[3:18:29.920 --> 3:18:33.240]  Leo and Masher on the Insane Asylum program.
[3:18:33.240 --> 3:18:34.520]  Pretty soon I'm going to start going,
[3:18:34.520 --> 3:18:35.760]  Leeda!
[3:18:35.760 --> 3:18:37.360]  Myself, go ahead.
[3:18:38.320 --> 3:18:40.960]  Lower the blood pressure.
[3:18:40.960 --> 3:18:42.120]  Hello, sir.
[3:18:42.120 --> 3:18:47.120]  Yeah, I sent you a little thing under movie concepts.
[3:18:47.640 --> 3:18:50.000]  Did you read that on the tips line?
[3:18:50.880 --> 3:18:53.320]  I'm sure one of us did, I'm wallowing in data,
[3:18:53.320 --> 3:18:54.640]  but tell me about it.
[3:18:54.640 --> 3:18:58.240]  Yeah, it's basically, I wrote Collaborate
[3:18:58.240 --> 3:19:00.760]  with Catherine Albrecht of Spy Chips
[3:19:00.760 --> 3:19:02.720]  in an unauthorized makeover of
[3:19:02.720 --> 3:19:04.320]  The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[3:19:04.320 --> 3:19:06.120]  Use both versions.
[3:19:06.120 --> 3:19:08.560]  With all relevant links to factual data,
[3:19:08.560 --> 3:19:10.080]  it should be a visible runner running
[3:19:10.080 --> 3:19:11.880]  at the bottom of the frame,
[3:19:11.880 --> 3:19:13.840]  interspersed throughout the movie,
[3:19:13.840 --> 3:19:15.680]  and use enough material time-wise
[3:19:15.680 --> 3:19:17.120]  to warrant a legal case,
[3:19:17.120 --> 3:19:20.400]  i.e. go way over contemporary limits of free usage,
[3:19:20.400 --> 3:19:23.560]  to make them sue, give you free publicity.
[3:19:23.560 --> 3:19:24.400]  Or if they don't sue,
[3:19:24.400 --> 3:19:27.320]  you establish a new precedent for usage.
[3:19:27.320 --> 3:19:29.800]  And I said I'd volunteer to be the producer of record
[3:19:29.800 --> 3:19:32.160]  for legal cases, because they can't get anything.
[3:19:32.160 --> 3:19:36.000]  Well, that is a nice hypothetical scenario,
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:37.880]  but I don't think I could even make
[3:19:37.880 --> 3:19:40.520]  a live-action Body Snatchers.
[3:19:40.520 --> 3:19:42.920]  Much less, get along with the people
[3:19:42.920 --> 3:19:44.160]  that I've been making it with.
[3:19:44.160 --> 3:19:45.920]  And I like Catherine, but you know, everything's ending.
[3:19:45.920 --> 3:19:47.160]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates
[3:19:47.160 --> 3:19:48.600]  that nine million Americans
[3:19:48.600 --> 3:19:50.720]  are victims of identity theft each year.
[3:19:50.720 --> 3:19:54.000]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds,
[3:19:54.000 --> 3:19:56.720]  costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[3:19:56.720 --> 3:20:00.080]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication,
[3:20:00.080 --> 3:20:02.160]  and often the only protection between a hacker
[3:20:02.160 --> 3:20:03.880]  and your personal information.
[3:20:03.880 --> 3:20:06.520]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file,
[3:20:06.520 --> 3:20:08.160]  data file, or any other file
[3:20:08.160 --> 3:20:10.320]  that is not encrypted and password protected,
[3:20:10.320 --> 3:20:12.880]  are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.
[3:20:12.880 --> 3:20:14.080]  With Password Safe Pro,
[3:20:14.080 --> 3:20:15.560]  your passwords can be secured

[3:20:45.560 --> 3:20:47.840]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change,
[3:20:47.840 --> 3:20:50.000]  the most downloaded film in internet history
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:20:53.560]  comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut,
[3:20:53.560 --> 3:20:55.880]  an entirely new two-hour film
[3:20:55.880 --> 3:20:58.760]  that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[3:20:58.760 --> 3:21:01.040]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst
[3:21:01.040 --> 3:21:02.920]  for a new independent investigation
[3:21:02.920 --> 3:21:05.880]  in which family members receive answers to their questions
[3:21:05.880 --> 3:21:08.560]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime
[3:21:08.560 --> 3:21:09.800]  are brought to justice.
[3:21:09.800 --> 3:21:13.240]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[3:21:13.240 --> 3:21:15.920]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases
[3:21:15.920 --> 3:21:18.480]  to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut
[3:21:18.480 --> 3:21:21.040]  is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[3:21:21.040 --> 3:21:23.840]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today
[3:21:23.840 --> 3:21:26.520]  at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[3:21:26.520 --> 3:21:28.560]  While you're visiting the online video store,
[3:21:28.560 --> 3:21:30.440]  be sure to check out the huge discounts
[3:21:30.440 --> 3:21:33.240]  on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement,
[3:21:33.240 --> 3:21:36.760]  America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[3:21:36.760 --> 3:21:39.320]  We're in a no-holds-far information war.
[3:21:39.320 --> 3:21:42.520]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools
[3:21:42.520 --> 3:21:45.360]  you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[3:21:45.360 --> 3:21:48.360]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years
[3:21:48.360 --> 3:21:50.400]  hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[3:21:50.400 --> 3:21:52.040]  and live out their golden years.
[3:21:52.040 --> 3:21:55.800]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy,
[3:21:55.800 --> 3:21:57.920]  housing, and medical, many retirees
[3:21:57.920 --> 3:22:00.160]  are forced to live below the poverty line.
[3:22:00.160 --> 3:22:02.920]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit
[3:22:02.920 --> 3:22:04.800]  we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us
[3:22:04.800 --> 3:22:08.360]  into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[3:22:08.360 --> 3:22:10.000]  These questions and more can be answered
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:11.840]  by reading G. Edward Griffin's book,
[3:22:11.840 --> 3:22:13.440]  The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[3:22:13.440 --> 3:22:15.240]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's
[3:22:15.240 --> 3:22:18.640]  what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[3:22:18.640 --> 3:22:20.800]  A gripping adventure into the secret world
[3:22:20.800 --> 3:22:22.880]  of international banking cartel.
[3:22:22.880 --> 3:22:24.080]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[3:23:45.560 --> 3:24:12.400]  I drove through LaGrange just the other day.
[3:24:12.400 --> 3:24:17.160]  Even though it's George Bush's favorite band.
[3:24:23.800 --> 3:24:26.640]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[3:24:26.640 --> 3:24:31.200]  Leo and Mass, thanks for holding her on the air.
[3:24:31.200 --> 3:24:32.040]  Hello?
[3:24:32.040 --> 3:24:33.200]  Yes, Leo.
[3:24:33.200 --> 3:24:34.080]  Yeah.
[3:24:34.080 --> 3:24:38.440]  Also, I got a song for Willie I just wrote.
[3:24:38.440 --> 3:24:41.400]  How do I mail it to him?
[3:24:41.400 --> 3:24:43.560]  Listen, Leo, I appreciate your call.
[3:24:43.560 --> 3:24:46.640]  I guess I do have Willie's mailing address,
[3:24:46.640 --> 3:24:50.120]  but it's the same one that's on their Peace Group website.
[3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:52.480]  So I'm not really the agent to get to Willie Nelson
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:24:53.040]  through.
[3:24:53.040 --> 3:24:55.040]  Kyle in Iowa, you're on the air.
[3:24:55.040 --> 3:24:57.600]  Go ahead.
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:24:58.440]  Hi, Alex.
[3:24:58.440 --> 3:24:59.000]  How's it going?
[3:24:59.000 --> 3:24:59.240]  Good.
[3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:00.160]  Thanks for holding Kyle.
[3:25:00.160 --> 3:25:01.160]  You're on the air worldwide.
[3:25:01.160 --> 3:25:02.480]  What's on your mind?
[3:25:02.480 --> 3:25:05.520]  Well, I got two things I want to talk about.
[3:25:05.520 --> 3:25:07.520]  Quick, the first comment I want to make
[3:25:07.520 --> 3:25:10.040]  is that I think we all might need
[3:25:10.040 --> 3:25:14.680]  to start thinking in terms of us being dead men walking.
[3:25:14.680 --> 3:25:16.320]  That way, we can kind of let go and just
[3:25:16.320 --> 3:25:19.480]  do what needs to be done, whatever that means.
[3:25:19.480 --> 3:25:21.680]  Well, we need everybody in universities
[3:25:21.680 --> 3:25:23.320]  to find out if they do have programs
[3:25:23.320 --> 3:25:25.560]  where they're mass injecting potatoes and things
[3:25:25.560 --> 3:25:27.880]  to be shipped to Africa, quote, with vaccines
[3:25:27.880 --> 3:25:30.720]  to help the children to find out actually what's in there.
[3:25:30.720 --> 3:25:32.320]  And that could be a big breaking story.
[3:25:32.320 --> 3:25:33.920]  We know they've been caught already doing them.
[3:25:33.920 --> 3:25:34.760]  That's been in the news.
[3:25:34.760 --> 3:25:36.400]  But you get a call like that.
[3:25:36.400 --> 3:25:40.880]  I start wanting to jump on a plane and go investigate.
[3:25:40.880 --> 3:25:44.040]  Yeah, the other thing I want to talk about, though,
[3:25:44.040 --> 3:25:47.280]  is I actually live here in Cedar Falls
[3:25:47.280 --> 3:25:53.600]  slash Waterloo with these camp drills that are going on.
[3:25:53.600 --> 3:25:57.840]  And I've been paying attention to the local media and everything.
[3:25:57.840 --> 3:26:00.920]  And I noticed the day that the raid was announced,
[3:26:00.920 --> 3:26:03.560]  I just caught the tail end of it just before I was going to bed.
[3:26:03.560 --> 3:26:06.360]  I was flipping through the channel on Discovery Channel.
[3:26:06.360 --> 3:26:08.480]  It appeared that they had some pro-immigration
[3:26:08.480 --> 3:26:09.720]  piece on there.
[3:26:09.720 --> 3:26:15.920]  And then on the local news, they also had a bleeding heart
[3:26:15.920 --> 3:26:18.840]  pro-immigration piece on there where everyone was crying,
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:20.680]  and all these poor people and everything.
[3:26:20.680 --> 3:26:22.200]  And in a way, I do feel bad for them.
[3:26:22.200 --> 3:26:22.800]  But at the same time.
[3:26:22.800 --> 3:26:24.680]  Well, this is a very sophisticated sigh-up.
[3:26:24.680 --> 3:26:26.960]  So I haven't really even gotten into how they're doing it.
[3:26:26.960 --> 3:26:29.480]  But let me try to get into the basics
[3:26:29.480 --> 3:26:31.240]  of how the psychology works.
[3:26:31.240 --> 3:26:34.640]  They had a Washington Post article with the headline
[3:26:34.640 --> 3:26:37.080]  that non-psychiatric patients being
[3:26:37.080 --> 3:26:38.960]  drugged by federal government.
[3:26:38.960 --> 3:26:40.520]  And I've got the headline here.
[3:26:40.520 --> 3:26:41.560]  That's not the exact headline.
[3:26:41.560 --> 3:26:43.040]  I never even got to it yesterday because I
[3:26:43.040 --> 3:26:45.360]  wanted to flesh it out if I didn't cover it.
[3:26:45.360 --> 3:26:51.680]  And it basically said in there that what they were doing
[3:26:51.680 --> 3:26:55.360]  is that if somebody cries or resists,
[3:26:55.360 --> 3:26:59.960]  they inject them with a sedative, a pretty serious
[3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:01.040]  anti-psychotic.
[3:27:01.040 --> 3:27:02.280]  And then the cops lean over.
[3:27:02.280 --> 3:27:05.640]  It said viciously and say, night, night.
[3:27:05.640 --> 3:27:07.680]  And it actually does sound kind of sadistic.
[3:27:07.680 --> 3:27:09.440]  And it does sound kind of creepy.
[3:27:09.440 --> 3:27:11.640]  But that's better than being tasered.
[3:27:11.640 --> 3:27:13.920]  So a citizen just says, well, officer, I wasn't speeding.
[3:27:13.920 --> 3:27:14.520]  They go, that's it.
[3:27:14.520 --> 3:27:15.440]  You're tasered.
[3:27:15.440 --> 3:27:16.880]  Or officer, please.
[3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:18.520]  And the officer says, don't beg to me.
[3:27:18.520 --> 3:27:19.160]  That's a threat.
[3:27:19.160 --> 3:27:20.120]  I'm tasering you.
[3:27:20.120 --> 3:27:22.200]  Or throws a guy out of a wheelchair
[3:27:22.200 --> 3:27:24.280]  who's paralyzed.
[3:27:24.280 --> 3:27:26.000]  They treat us worse.
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:28.040]  But imagine if they didn't let to a citizen,
[3:27:28.040 --> 3:27:30.320]  it'd be how good it was for the officer's safety.
[3:27:30.320 --> 3:27:36.160]  And it's very humane to inject them with the anti-psychotics,
[3:27:36.160 --> 3:27:36.920]  the Thorazine.
[3:27:39.760 --> 3:27:42.080]  But with the illegals, it's all the officer then
[3:27:42.080 --> 3:27:47.200]  sinisterly leaned over and said, night, night.
[3:27:47.200 --> 3:27:48.320]  When actually it's probably like a joke,
[3:27:48.320 --> 3:27:49.280]  night, night.
[3:27:49.280 --> 3:27:52.000]  Because it said the person was fighting them, which they
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:54.200]  actually could have done something then.
[3:27:54.200 --> 3:27:55.840]  And I'm not even condoning it, though it's
[3:27:55.840 --> 3:27:58.520]  on the edge of being condoned.
[3:27:58.520 --> 3:28:01.640]  They catch you in Mexico, they run your credit,
[3:28:01.640 --> 3:28:03.680]  suck every bit of money out of your family,
[3:28:03.680 --> 3:28:06.800]  put you in a dirt floor jail where they beat you up in rapia.
[3:28:06.800 --> 3:28:08.960]  They torture you with Tabasco up the nose.
[3:28:08.960 --> 3:28:09.560]  That's their favorite.
[3:28:09.560 --> 3:28:12.160]  I mean, folks, I know that some people I know.
[3:28:12.160 --> 3:28:13.640]  I mean, Mexico is so corrupt.
[3:28:13.640 --> 3:28:18.920]  It's just, it's called Littlebite or Morditas.
[3:28:18.920 --> 3:28:21.080]  And then you just, I've paid the cops off myself.
[3:28:21.080 --> 3:28:22.360]  They just pull you over and they're
[3:28:22.360 --> 3:28:23.960]  guarding all the marijuana fields out there
[3:28:23.960 --> 3:28:24.760]  while you're driving around.
[3:28:24.760 --> 3:28:27.440]  They walk over and they go, you're speeding.
[3:28:27.440 --> 3:28:29.080]  And you go, no, I wasn't speeding.
[3:28:29.080 --> 3:28:32.800]  And they go, no, you go to jail.
[3:28:32.800 --> 3:28:35.800]  And then you go, OK, well, here's how many pesos do you want?
[3:28:35.800 --> 3:28:37.480]  And they go, I want this meaning.
[3:28:37.480 --> 3:28:38.240]  And then you pay them.
[3:28:38.240 --> 3:28:43.680]  I mean, that's, you know, so yeah, no, it's very sophisticated.
[3:28:43.680 --> 3:28:46.360]  But again, they even admitted they're letting
[3:28:46.360 --> 3:28:47.560]  most of the illegals go.
[3:28:47.560 --> 3:28:48.960]  That was in the Des Moines Register.
[3:28:48.960 --> 3:28:51.000]  Whatever your paper is, I've got the article right here.
[3:28:51.000 --> 3:28:53.280]  It said they're letting most of them go and saying, well,
[3:28:53.280 --> 3:28:54.560]  you promise to come back later.
[3:28:54.560 --> 3:28:59.200]  It's, they're showing us camps and at cattle shoots
[3:28:59.200 --> 3:29:00.160]  to set the image.
[3:29:00.160 --> 3:29:01.400]  And that's not my opinion.
[3:29:01.400 --> 3:29:02.640]  I have the federal documents.
[3:29:02.640 --> 3:29:05.520]  You're absolutely right.
[3:29:05.520 --> 3:29:07.520]  Anything else, Kyle?
[3:29:07.520 --> 3:29:09.680]  Yeah, yeah, I got a point I want to make about all that.
[3:29:09.680 --> 3:29:10.280]  Stay there.
[3:29:10.280 --> 3:29:10.720]  Stay there.
[3:29:10.720 --> 3:29:14.560]  And then I'm going to play this Grand Theft Auto parody piece.
[3:29:14.560 --> 3:29:16.240]  And for Prison Planet TV members,
[3:29:16.240 --> 3:29:19.480]  you'll be able to see this coming up after we talk to Kyle.
[3:29:19.480 --> 3:29:23.960]  Then I'm going to talk to Christian, Dave, Belly Bob,
[3:29:23.960 --> 3:29:26.600]  and others, 1-800-25-99231.
[3:29:26.600 --> 3:29:28.920]  Got a bunch of other news here we haven't gotten to as well.
[3:29:28.920 --> 3:29:31.360]  But I've done a pretty good job today of covering a lot of it.
[3:29:31.360 --> 3:29:32.040]  We'll be right back.
[3:29:35.480 --> 3:29:36.880]  We're on the march.
[3:29:36.880 --> 3:29:39.320]  The empire's on the run.
[3:29:39.320 --> 3:29:42.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:29:45.520 --> 3:29:46.760]  Have you ever thought about what's
[3:29:46.760 --> 3:29:48.640]  in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[3:29:48.640 --> 3:29:52.320]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium,
[3:29:52.320 --> 3:29:54.120]  formaldehydes, and more?
[3:29:54.120 --> 3:29:56.160]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence
[3:29:56.160 --> 3:29:58.320]  of some 4,000 separate ingredients,
[3:29:58.320 --> 3:29:59.880]  most of which are synthetic.
[3:29:59.880 --> 3:30:01.320]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[3:30:01.320 --> 3:30:03.600]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling
[3:30:03.600 --> 3:30:06.160]  these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing,
[3:30:06.160 --> 3:30:08.840]  and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation
[3:30:08.840 --> 3:30:10.680]  of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[3:30:10.680 --> 3:30:12.480]  Now compare a cow-bin pure soap.
[3:30:12.480 --> 3:30:15.720]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals,
[3:30:15.720 --> 3:30:16.760]  no animal testing.
[3:30:16.760 --> 3:30:17.560]  They're safe.
[3:30:17.560 --> 3:30:20.360]  And you save 85% of the money you're spending
[3:30:20.360 --> 3:30:21.720]  on cleaning products now.

[3:30:45.640 --> 3:30:51.680]  It is a big idea, a new world order, in the near future.
[3:30:51.680 --> 3:30:54.800]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:30:54.800 --> 3:30:57.640]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[3:30:57.640 --> 3:31:00.440]  But their objective would be world domination.
[3:31:00.440 --> 3:31:03.520]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:31:03.520 --> 3:31:06.480]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[3:31:06.480 --> 3:31:10.360]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[3:31:10.360 --> 3:31:10.960]  is at hand.
[3:31:13.960 --> 3:31:16.640]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan
[3:31:16.640 --> 3:31:19.400]  for world government is blown wide open.

[3:31:22.160 --> 3:31:23.280]  order agenda.
[3:31:23.280 --> 3:31:25.840]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:31:25.840 --> 3:31:27.000]  Most people have no idea.
[3:31:27.000 --> 3:31:27.800]  They're not after money.
[3:31:27.800 --> 3:31:29.080]  They have all the money they need.
[3:31:29.080 --> 3:31:30.040]  They're after power.
[3:31:30.040 --> 3:31:31.120]  That's their after easy.

[3:31:42.680 --> 3:31:44.640]  You have been warned.
[3:31:44.640 --> 3:31:46.800]  There are many types of storable foods.
[3:31:46.800 --> 3:31:48.840]  But how about a super food that contains
[3:31:48.840 --> 3:31:51.520]  every nutrient that the human body needs for survival?
[3:31:51.520 --> 3:31:55.720]  50% protein, 300 milligrams of potassium per ounce,

[3:32:20.200 --> 3:32:22.000]  You can save and invest your money,
[3:32:22.000 --> 3:32:24.680]  but in the end, food will be your greatest asset.
[3:32:24.680 --> 3:32:28.160]  Remember what the word of God says in Ezekiel 719.

[3:32:32.320 --> 3:32:33.600]  and oil can do for you.

[3:32:57.840 --> 3:32:59.280]  Here come the foreign companies.
[3:32:59.280 --> 3:33:01.040]  They're going to pay off your mayor,
[3:33:01.040 --> 3:33:05.040]  take over your water, and triple the price overnight.
[3:33:05.040 --> 3:33:07.480]  And the cops are doing riot-controlled drills
[3:33:07.480 --> 3:33:10.200]  and building FEMA camps.
[3:33:10.200 --> 3:33:13.280]  Wow, the illegal aliens are above the law.
[3:33:13.280 --> 3:33:15.880]  Hey, party.
[3:33:18.640 --> 3:33:20.280]  Take your vaccines.
[3:33:20.280 --> 3:33:21.240]  La, la, la.
[3:33:24.840 --> 3:33:26.800]  Take your prozac.
[3:33:26.800 --> 3:33:28.480]  Eat your riddlin'.
[3:33:28.480 --> 3:33:29.600]  Get tasered, yeah.
[3:33:35.440 --> 3:33:37.240]  All right, I'll quit acting stupid.
[3:33:37.240 --> 3:33:39.120]  I got an audience of like two out the window here,
[3:33:39.120 --> 3:33:41.480]  and I'm acting stupid for them.
[3:33:41.480 --> 3:33:43.200]  You got to have some fun with this sometime.
[3:33:43.200 --> 3:33:45.240]  This is insane.
[3:33:45.240 --> 3:33:47.320]  I'm telling you, it's a, I keep saying it.
[3:33:47.320 --> 3:33:49.040]  I just can't believe it.
[3:33:49.040 --> 3:33:51.560]  All right, Kyle and Iowa, say whatever you want.
[3:33:51.560 --> 3:33:52.520]  I'll try to shut up.
[3:33:52.520 --> 3:33:53.880]  Go ahead.
[3:33:53.880 --> 3:33:56.440]  Well, Alex, first I must say that your air guitar skills
[3:33:56.440 --> 3:33:57.920]  are unmatched.
[3:33:57.920 --> 3:33:59.840]  But I want to make a general point
[3:33:59.840 --> 3:34:02.440]  about this whole immigration thing.
[3:34:02.440 --> 3:34:03.680]  And I don't remember where I read it.
[3:34:03.680 --> 3:34:05.400]  I want to say it's either the Waterloo Courier
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:06.560]  or the Des Moines Register.
[3:34:06.560 --> 3:34:09.960]  But I read something about how there was,
[3:34:09.960 --> 3:34:12.680]  they had some tip-off like a year or two ago
[3:34:12.680 --> 3:34:14.720]  about all the illegal immigrants being there
[3:34:14.720 --> 3:34:17.160]  because there's apparently a meth lab
[3:34:17.160 --> 3:34:19.880]  on one of these meat packing plants.
[3:34:19.880 --> 3:34:21.240]  I'm just kind of shooting from the hip here,
[3:34:21.240 --> 3:34:22.800]  so I might have some of my details.
[3:34:22.800 --> 3:34:24.040]  No, no, I'm not reading it.
[3:34:24.040 --> 3:34:25.120]  I've got the articles here.
[3:34:25.120 --> 3:34:27.040]  Okay, well, the point is,
[3:34:27.040 --> 3:34:29.880]  hey, why are they letting a meth lab,
[3:34:29.880 --> 3:34:31.680]  you know, stick around for a year or two.
[3:34:31.680 --> 3:34:32.520]  I know, it's.
[3:34:32.520 --> 3:34:33.360]  Not even about it.
[3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:35.960]  And why didn't they get rid of the illegal immigrants then?
[3:34:35.960 --> 3:34:38.440]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[3:34:38.440 --> 3:34:39.960]  I mean, it's flat under space.
[3:34:39.960 --> 3:34:40.800]  It's a fraud.
[3:34:40.800 --> 3:34:42.200]  I mean, they're pretty much admitting
[3:34:42.200 --> 3:34:43.440]  to being criminally negligent.
[3:34:43.440 --> 3:34:44.960]  This is why it's a fraud.
[3:34:44.960 --> 3:34:48.640]  Let's take their official number of 16 million illegals.
[3:34:48.640 --> 3:34:50.240]  It's really like 35 million.
[3:34:50.240 --> 3:34:51.280]  That was a year ago.
[3:34:51.280 --> 3:34:53.040]  And the government actually has real numbers on that.
[3:34:53.040 --> 3:34:54.520]  That's where we get those.
[3:34:54.520 --> 3:34:56.760]  Because the census admits that about half the illegals
[3:34:56.760 --> 3:34:57.800]  actually report themselves.
[3:34:57.800 --> 3:34:59.040]  So they estimate it's twice that.
[3:34:59.040 --> 3:35:01.760]  So what's twice, 15, 16 million, 30 something mil.
[3:35:01.760 --> 3:35:04.040]  And that's a few years old, as I was saying,
[3:35:04.040 --> 3:35:06.400]  what, 2006, almost two years old now,
[3:35:06.400 --> 3:35:09.200]  year and a half old, they'll go out
[3:35:09.200 --> 3:35:10.760]  at every four or five months and they'll
[3:35:10.760 --> 3:35:12.400]  raid a few meatpacking plants.
[3:35:12.400 --> 3:35:14.840]  And you'll hear about 1,100 arrests, 200 arrests,
[3:35:14.840 --> 3:35:17.680]  500 arrests, the biggest I've ever seen is 1,100.
[3:35:17.680 --> 3:35:19.200]  And they'll go, man, getting tough.
[3:35:19.200 --> 3:35:23.160]  Wiles are, and it's always some smaller meatpacking division,
[3:35:23.160 --> 3:35:24.640]  not Tyson or somebody else.
[3:35:24.640 --> 3:35:26.800]  So it's actually even getting rid of some competition.
[3:35:26.800 --> 3:35:28.240]  The globalists are masters at this.
[3:35:28.240 --> 3:35:30.000]  They don't go after the big boys.
[3:35:30.000 --> 3:35:32.160]  And then the media is like, man, they're getting tough.
[3:35:32.160 --> 3:35:35.600]  If you've got three million illegals coming in a year,
[3:35:35.600 --> 3:35:39.000]  at 900 plus thousand, it's right close to a million legal.
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:41.800]  So that's almost four million coming in a year.
[3:35:41.800 --> 3:35:45.520]  And every few months, they're arresting 1,000 people, maybe.
[3:35:46.520 --> 3:35:48.160]  In the big raids and a few thousand,
[3:35:48.160 --> 3:35:49.320]  you can go look the numbers up.
[3:35:49.320 --> 3:35:53.800]  Just like earlier, I said the average times 11 minutes for,
[3:35:53.800 --> 3:35:55.320]  because I go from these statistics,
[3:35:55.320 --> 3:35:57.600]  but then I want to be careful that my memory fails sometimes.
[3:35:57.600 --> 3:35:59.320]  I said 11 minutes was the average.
[3:35:59.320 --> 3:36:01.320]  And he looked it up online and they actually say
[3:36:01.320 --> 3:36:03.360]  11 minutes for an 911 call.
[3:36:03.360 --> 3:36:06.440]  My info is, and let's look this up right now,
[3:36:06.440 --> 3:36:07.680]  let's fact check me,
[3:36:10.800 --> 3:36:15.800]  that I think the ICE only picks up inside the country,
[3:36:18.720 --> 3:36:21.960]  something like 2,000 people a month.
[3:36:21.960 --> 3:36:25.240]  Now at the border, they intercept,
[3:36:25.240 --> 3:36:27.160]  I think it's more than 20,000.
[3:36:27.160 --> 3:36:28.640]  So let me see, 20,000 at the border,
[3:36:28.640 --> 3:36:30.960]  which they say is one out of 10 they're catching.
[3:36:30.960 --> 3:36:34.240]  20,000 at the border, and then at the borders,
[3:36:34.240 --> 3:36:36.480]  and then a couple thousand a month.
[3:36:36.480 --> 3:36:38.120]  So they're arresting a couple thousand.
[3:36:38.120 --> 3:36:39.680]  So what's 12 times a couple thousand?
[3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:42.440]  Let's say 24,000 a year they're arresting.
[3:36:42.440 --> 3:36:47.000]  And again, I'm going off numbers I saw years ago, 24,000.
[3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:48.960]  So if they're arresting 24,000,
[3:36:48.960 --> 3:36:50.440]  but four million are coming in,
[3:36:50.440 --> 3:36:51.760]  three million of them illegal.
[3:36:51.760 --> 3:36:55.720]  You see, that's like trying to ladle out a swimming pool
[3:36:55.720 --> 3:36:57.160]  with a teaspoon.
[3:36:57.160 --> 3:37:02.160]  And oh my gosh, you have to prosecute the employers.
[3:37:03.760 --> 3:37:06.680]  And folks, if they want to do that, they could instantly,
[3:37:06.680 --> 3:37:09.520]  ICE would come in and they would visit in one day,
[3:37:09.520 --> 3:37:12.880]  20 Austin businesses, and they would go in
[3:37:12.880 --> 3:37:15.240]  and there'd be illegal aliens in every kitchen.
[3:37:15.240 --> 3:37:17.440]  And then you'd arrest those people and deport them,
[3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:19.000]  and then you would put felony charges,
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:21.320]  and this is treason, so it should be felony charges
[3:37:21.320 --> 3:37:23.400]  on all these businesses.
[3:37:23.400 --> 3:37:27.200]  And then you do that once a month, three year,
[3:37:27.200 --> 3:37:29.920]  that nobody's gonna hire illegals in Austin, Texas.
[3:37:31.480 --> 3:37:34.000]  Cured, done, finished, easy.
[3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:35.440]  Not even that much enforcement.
[3:37:35.440 --> 3:37:37.320]  How many officers would you need to do
[3:37:37.320 --> 3:37:39.440]  a 10 raids once a month?
[3:37:42.600 --> 3:37:43.960]  I mean, five guys?
[3:37:44.920 --> 3:37:45.760]  Not many.
[3:37:45.760 --> 3:37:48.280]  Yeah, see, no, no, no, no, they're not gonna do that.
[3:37:48.280 --> 3:37:49.680]  Go ahead.
[3:37:49.680 --> 3:37:53.600]  Oh, well, you know, I guess another little thing
[3:37:53.600 --> 3:37:55.880]  I'd like to add on there too, it's like,
[3:37:55.880 --> 3:37:59.160]  I just don't know me, but just even growing up around here,
[3:37:59.160 --> 3:38:01.760]  it's always been well-known there's been tons of Mexicans
[3:38:01.760 --> 3:38:03.760]  that work at all these meatpacking plants,
[3:38:03.760 --> 3:38:07.400]  so it's like, I doubt I'm into privities,
[3:38:07.400 --> 3:38:10.720]  some special knowledge that law enforcement people are.
[3:38:10.720 --> 3:38:12.840]  No one body legals works at them
[3:38:12.840 --> 3:38:14.920]  because you used to get 20 bucks an hour,
[3:38:14.920 --> 3:38:19.240]  a skilled union job, and now they get five, six bucks an hour,
[3:38:19.240 --> 3:38:24.240]  and the illegals will not work with a gringo or a mayota
[3:38:24.280 --> 3:38:25.640]  once they take over.
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:27.960]  Now, not being mean to the illegal aliens,
[3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:31.000]  it's a fact, there's now been newscast in LA admitting it,
[3:38:31.000 --> 3:38:33.760]  I know cooks in LA who can't get hired anywhere
[3:38:33.760 --> 3:38:37.320]  because it's a, we look out for Raza first.
[3:38:37.320 --> 3:38:39.280]  Now, not American Hispanics, they're great folks,
[3:38:39.280 --> 3:38:40.960]  but the illegals, it's a very,
[3:38:40.960 --> 3:38:42.480]  one of the most nationalistic countries
[3:38:42.480 --> 3:38:44.560]  in the world is Mexico, and they come in,
[3:38:44.560 --> 3:38:46.640]  they take over, they only hire their people.
[3:38:46.640 --> 3:38:48.680]  I mean, you think white folks were bad in the 50s
[3:38:48.680 --> 3:38:52.040]  doing this, my gosh, the Latin Americans,
[3:38:52.040 --> 3:38:54.120]  especially the Mexicans, they bring it down
[3:38:54.120 --> 3:38:56.280]  to a fine art of only hiring their people.
[3:38:56.280 --> 3:38:58.920]  There's almost no blacks now in the janitorial business,
[3:38:58.920 --> 3:39:02.600]  almost no blacks in farm work all over the country,
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:06.560]  and it's just absolutely amazing, so you don't work,
[3:39:06.560 --> 3:39:08.000]  and the employers tell you it now,
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:10.600]  don't speak Spanish, you can't work on this meatpacking line,
[3:39:10.600 --> 3:39:14.360]  you can't work at this print shop, I've got a Spanish shop,
[3:39:14.360 --> 3:39:16.600]  and so it's also the language,
[3:39:16.600 --> 3:39:19.080]  and then that drives the wages down
[3:39:19.080 --> 3:39:20.400]  in all those key communities.
[3:39:20.400 --> 3:39:22.520]  Take the truck drivers, all the Hispanic truck drivers,
[3:39:22.520 --> 3:39:23.880]  I know, and I know quite a few,
[3:39:23.880 --> 3:39:26.000]  they come out to our rallies and they're like, oh yeah,
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:28.880]  I've gone from 20 bucks an hour to nine bucks an hour,
[3:39:28.880 --> 3:39:30.800]  and I'm bankrupting my life's over.
[3:39:30.800 --> 3:39:32.240]  You know, it's over, folks,
[3:39:32.240 --> 3:39:35.080]  because the illegal aliens are now doing it.
[3:39:35.080 --> 3:39:36.880]  Thank you for the call.
[3:39:36.880 --> 3:39:38.880]  And does that help Mexicans?
[3:39:38.880 --> 3:39:40.800]  No, that ends up turning us into Mexico
[3:39:40.800 --> 3:39:42.480]  instead of them having a revolution down there
[3:39:42.480 --> 3:39:44.800]  when they got triple the resources the US has,
[3:39:44.800 --> 3:39:49.280]  gold, silver, oil, the place is a heaven.
[3:39:50.440 --> 3:39:52.720]  They got more billionaires than we got in the US,
[3:39:52.720 --> 3:39:54.080]  did you know that?
[3:39:54.080 --> 3:39:56.400]  They got money coming out their ears,
[3:39:56.400 --> 3:39:58.520]  and they export all their criminals,
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:40:00.960]  you kill somebody in Mexico, you just come to the US,
[3:40:00.960 --> 3:40:03.640]  kill somebody in the US, go down to Mexico.
[3:40:03.640 --> 3:40:06.240]  And we kicked Mexico's butt two times,
[3:40:07.080 --> 3:40:09.000]  actually three times if you count when they attacked us
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:11.920]  with the German army in 1918,
[3:40:11.920 --> 3:40:13.520]  and boy you're not supposed to teach that
[3:40:13.520 --> 3:40:14.960]  in the school books, you know,
[3:40:14.960 --> 3:40:17.680]  Mexico attacking us and murdering a bunch of people,
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:20.320]  and I'm tired of it, and I will get on air
[3:40:20.320 --> 3:40:23.400]  and say they work with the Germans to attack this country.
[3:40:23.400 --> 3:40:25.240]  Of course, the Texas Rangers kicked their,
[3:40:25.240 --> 3:40:27.440]  you know what, I just can't handle it.
[3:40:27.440 --> 3:40:29.520]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[3:40:29.520 --> 3:40:31.720]  I'm sorry we keep winning, I'm sorry, you know,
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:35.360]  why don't you get your own country back?
[3:40:35.360 --> 3:40:37.160]  I mean, I'm not gonna play along with the fact
[3:40:37.160 --> 3:40:39.520]  that Mexico loves this, and Mexico's sweet,
[3:40:39.520 --> 3:40:40.520]  and it's a friendly thing.
[3:40:40.520 --> 3:40:42.560]  No, it's not, it's you're gonna die, Gringo,
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:44.520]  we're gonna kill all whites.
[3:40:44.520 --> 3:40:47.960]  Planet San Diego, and then it's very painful
[3:40:47.960 --> 3:40:49.560]  because I have a lot of Hispanic friends
[3:40:49.560 --> 3:40:52.640]  that could care less about having Mexicans around me,
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:40:54.520]  as long as they don't hate me,
[3:40:54.520 --> 3:40:56.040]  as long as they're red, white, and blue.
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:40:57.640]  And I know when the Mexican-Americans,
[3:40:57.640 --> 3:40:58.880]  red, white, and blue, there's red, white, and blue
[3:40:58.880 --> 3:41:02.640]  as anybody, or more so, but I don't like the fact
[3:41:02.640 --> 3:41:06.080]  that I'm supposed to play along with,
[3:41:06.080 --> 3:41:08.120]  and I know a lot of Mexicans call me and tell me,
[3:41:08.120 --> 3:41:09.640]  oh yeah man, you're right, you know,
[3:41:09.640 --> 3:41:12.120]  I hear it all the time, you know, Mexican-Americans,
[3:41:12.120 --> 3:41:13.760]  and I'm just not gonna play along with it anymore.
[3:41:13.760 --> 3:41:15.840]  I mean, I'm not gonna sit around about killing me,
[3:41:15.840 --> 3:41:17.320]  and now you're gonna gut my country,
[3:41:17.320 --> 3:41:19.120]  and the new old order's bringing you in.
[3:41:19.120 --> 3:41:20.800]  I fight everything the new old order does.
[3:41:20.800 --> 3:41:22.280]  Therefore abortion, I'm against it.
[3:41:22.280 --> 3:41:23.800]  Therefore open borders, I'm against it.
[3:41:23.800 --> 3:41:25.800]  Therefore gun bans, I'm against it.
[3:41:25.800 --> 3:41:27.840]  Therefore having foreign water companies
[3:41:27.840 --> 3:41:29.920]  take over our water, I'm against it.
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:31.560]  Anything, therefore, I'm against it.
[3:41:31.560 --> 3:41:33.520]  It's real simple.
[3:41:33.520 --> 3:41:35.280]  Oh, the new orders for the illegal aliens,
[3:41:35.280 --> 3:41:37.040]  well, I'm against you.
[3:41:37.040 --> 3:41:38.840]  Hey, two plus two equals four.
[3:41:38.840 --> 3:41:43.840]  Christian in California, you're on the air, worldwide.
[3:41:45.240 --> 3:41:46.080]  Hello?
[3:41:46.080 --> 3:41:46.920]  Yes, keyboard.
[3:41:46.920 --> 3:41:48.360]  Yeah, so Alex, I just wanna thank you
[3:41:48.360 --> 3:41:51.240]  for doing everything, and to what you was just saying,
[3:41:51.240 --> 3:41:54.440]  yeah, I just was trying to get a temporary job
[3:41:54.440 --> 3:41:56.560]  in a warehouse, and normally, you know,
[3:41:56.560 --> 3:41:58.560]  when I do the temporary thing in the summertime,
[3:41:58.560 --> 3:42:01.000]  it usually takes me about a day to get a job,
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:02.720]  but this time it took me like three weeks,
[3:42:02.720 --> 3:42:05.400]  and when I went in there, it was all illegal immigrants.
[3:42:05.400 --> 3:42:07.120]  I'm in California, so it was like,
[3:42:07.120 --> 3:42:09.920]  I really seen the firsthand effects of it,
[3:42:09.920 --> 3:42:11.560]  it was like crazy.
[3:42:11.560 --> 3:42:14.360]  No, I've got a lot of friends who've got college degrees,
[3:42:14.360 --> 3:42:16.440]  and you know, and computer programming and things,
[3:42:16.440 --> 3:42:18.520]  they, all the, most of the factories
[3:42:18.520 --> 3:42:21.800]  are shut down around here, and Austin's a booming city,
[3:42:21.800 --> 3:42:23.480]  and there's a lot of them shutting down,
[3:42:23.480 --> 3:42:24.960]  and you know, they're at H-E-B,
[3:42:24.960 --> 3:42:26.840]  and then they'll work another job mowing yards,
[3:42:26.840 --> 3:42:29.080]  and they work for the illegals now,
[3:42:29.080 --> 3:42:31.200]  and they're lucky, and they'll laugh at them,
[3:42:31.200 --> 3:42:32.720]  and call them the gringo, and they get to work
[3:42:32.720 --> 3:42:35.960]  under the illegal aliens, and that's how it works now,
[3:42:35.960 --> 3:42:38.200]  and they not only do that,
[3:42:38.200 --> 3:42:41.400]  they don't even like Mexicans that considers their stuff
[3:42:41.400 --> 3:42:43.120]  American, and don't speak Spanish.
[3:42:43.120 --> 3:42:45.040]  Well, I mean, is that you?
[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:46.480]  So is that you?
[3:42:46.480 --> 3:42:48.440]  No, no, I'm not, that's me.
[3:42:48.440 --> 3:42:51.280]  No, but I mean, but I'm saying are you Hispanic?
[3:42:51.280 --> 3:42:52.840]  No, I'm not Hispanic, I'm African-American.
[3:42:52.840 --> 3:42:54.440]  But I mean, you've seen that,
[3:42:54.440 --> 3:42:56.640]  because yes, I've certainly seen that, yeah.
[3:42:56.640 --> 3:42:58.640]  Yeah, I've seen that, I've got a lot of, you know,
[3:42:58.640 --> 3:43:01.480]  Mexican friends that tell me, you know, they don't like,
[3:43:01.480 --> 3:43:03.040]  I don't know, I forgot what they call them.
[3:43:03.040 --> 3:43:05.280]  You know what they call them, you know what the Mexicans,
[3:43:05.280 --> 3:43:07.400]  Mexican-Americans call Mexicans.
[3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:09.080]  Let's just not say it on air.
[3:43:09.080 --> 3:43:10.280]  Yeah, let's not say it on air.
[3:43:10.280 --> 3:43:12.000]  But you know, they say they don't like them,
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:13.200]  or whatever, because of that reason.
[3:43:13.200 --> 3:43:16.160]  So it's kind of like, that's kind of crazy to me,
[3:43:16.160 --> 3:43:17.600]  like to think that, you know, they're here.
[3:43:17.600 --> 3:43:20.760]  Well, that's because Mexicans aren't stupid.
[3:43:20.760 --> 3:43:23.600]  And in fact, on average, they're smarter,
[3:43:23.600 --> 3:43:26.880]  I mean, wiser than Americans, and I appreciate your call.
[3:43:26.880 --> 3:43:28.280]  Anything else you wanted to add?
[3:43:28.280 --> 3:43:29.560]  Oh yeah, and I just wanted to say,
[3:43:29.560 --> 3:43:31.680]  actually I got a comment.
[3:43:31.680 --> 3:43:33.840]  I wanted to say that, you know, to the listeners,
[3:43:33.840 --> 3:43:35.240]  everybody should really, because I was listening,
[3:43:35.240 --> 3:43:36.480]  yes, I listen every day.
[3:43:36.480 --> 3:43:38.840]  So I was listening yesterday, and I was seeing how,
[3:43:38.840 --> 3:43:41.200]  you know, they were trying to get to visit with it,
[3:43:41.200 --> 3:43:42.280]  with the religion and stuff.
[3:43:42.280 --> 3:43:46.360]  Everybody really read the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,
[3:43:46.360 --> 3:43:48.320]  and really read what the founding fathers
[3:43:48.320 --> 3:43:50.080]  were like really trying to teach.
[3:43:50.080 --> 3:43:52.820]  It was like a, you know, it was more of a,
[3:43:52.820 --> 3:43:53.660]  how you say,
[3:43:56.680 --> 3:44:00.160]  It was, it was founded on Christian principles,
[3:44:00.160 --> 3:44:01.640]  but it was secular government,
[3:44:01.640 --> 3:44:04.720]  so you wouldn't get one church cult running everything.
[3:44:04.720 --> 3:44:07.280]  Yeah, it was, it was more of a tolerance.
[3:44:07.280 --> 3:44:09.000]  So you guys, I mean, if you-
[3:44:09.000 --> 3:44:12.120]  Well, no, that's because they lived under religious nuts
[3:44:12.120 --> 3:44:14.080]  that wouldn't let them practice their religion,
[3:44:14.080 --> 3:44:15.480]  so they came here to have freedom,
[3:44:15.480 --> 3:44:17.320]  absolutely right sir, nail on the head.
[3:44:17.320 --> 3:44:18.640]  Yeah, I mean, I mean, I say this,
[3:44:18.640 --> 3:44:21.000]  I've talked to the radical Mexican groups before,
[3:44:21.000 --> 3:44:24.480]  and I've been like, listen, man, I don't mind Hispanics,
[3:44:24.480 --> 3:44:26.040]  I like Hispanic people, you know,
[3:44:26.040 --> 3:44:28.240]  I just stop saying you want to kill me,
[3:44:28.240 --> 3:44:29.480]  and stop saying you're going to get us,
[3:44:29.480 --> 3:44:31.560]  and you know, why is it okay for you to say that?
[3:44:31.560 --> 3:44:34.560]  You know, laugh and go, listen, gringo, you know,
[3:44:34.560 --> 3:44:36.760]  you know we don't like you, and you don't like us,
[3:44:36.760 --> 3:44:38.960]  and I go, no, I don't dislike you.
[3:44:38.960 --> 3:44:40.680]  And I said, I'm not going to be part of this.
[3:44:40.680 --> 3:44:43.960]  And they go, it doesn't matter what you want, gringo,
[3:44:43.960 --> 3:44:46.160]  we're taking over and we're going to get you.
[3:44:46.160 --> 3:44:48.120]  And I say, well, the new world order is engineering all this,
[3:44:48.120 --> 3:44:51.000]  he goes, we'll get them too, you're not going to get anybody,
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:53.440]  you can't even get your own Mexican government down there.
[3:44:53.440 --> 3:44:55.080]  And I'm not blaming you, they got weapons,
[3:44:55.080 --> 3:44:56.560]  and machine guns, and armored vehicles,
[3:44:56.560 --> 3:44:58.840]  and it's incredibly corrupt society.
[3:44:58.840 --> 3:45:01.760]  It's just that I would support Mexican independence,
[3:45:01.760 --> 3:45:03.800]  if they had a true Republic government,
[3:45:03.800 --> 3:45:05.200]  I mean, if they had people in Mexico
[3:45:05.200 --> 3:45:06.920]  that truly wanted liberty and freedom,
[3:45:06.920 --> 3:45:08.320]  and were rebelling against their country,
[3:45:08.320 --> 3:45:09.920]  I'd support them, I'd say send them money,
[3:45:09.920 --> 3:45:11.840]  I'd try to support, I'd probably go down there
[3:45:11.840 --> 3:45:12.840]  and fight with them.
[3:45:14.000 --> 3:45:15.640]  I mean, frankly, I like Latin Americans,
[3:45:15.640 --> 3:45:17.920]  I mean, you know, it's interesting people.
[3:45:18.920 --> 3:45:22.880]  You know, a mix of Mesoamericans, Spanish, Portuguese,
[3:45:22.880 --> 3:45:27.080]  African, Irish, German, it's just an interesting,
[3:45:27.080 --> 3:45:29.240]  nice hard-working family people, they don't like
[3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:31.160]  the new world order, they don't trust vaccines,
[3:45:31.160 --> 3:45:34.200]  when the CPS comes from Mexican kids who are Mexican,
[3:45:34.200 --> 3:45:35.880]  they just leave.
[3:45:35.880 --> 3:45:37.840]  Their kids come first, they just leave
[3:45:37.840 --> 3:45:39.600]  and go to another town, they go to Mexico,
[3:45:39.600 --> 3:45:41.320]  their kids are number one,
[3:45:41.320 --> 3:45:43.840]  not conditioned blacks, whites, and American Mexicans,
[3:45:43.840 --> 3:45:46.280]  we just, oh, have our baby, go ahead,
[3:45:46.280 --> 3:45:49.520]  oh, you're the government, okay, I'll give you my baby.
[3:45:49.520 --> 3:45:52.880]  Over my dead body, folks, so hail the Mexicans,
[3:45:52.880 --> 3:45:55.320]  hail their family, hail their Raza,
[3:45:55.320 --> 3:45:57.320]  I have nothing against them caring about their people
[3:45:57.320 --> 3:45:58.880]  and being proud of who they are
[3:45:58.880 --> 3:46:00.360]  and wanting to have their families
[3:46:00.360 --> 3:46:03.080]  and wanting to have children and wanting to live.
[3:46:03.080 --> 3:46:05.080]  But don't you tell me I gotta die,
[3:46:05.080 --> 3:46:07.480]  don't you tell me to get out of the way for you,
[3:46:07.480 --> 3:46:09.520]  because you're gonna get a fight,
[3:46:09.520 --> 3:46:11.080]  you're gonna get one, believe me,
[3:46:11.080 --> 3:46:13.480]  and you're gonna get a serious one.
[3:46:13.480 --> 3:46:15.400]  And I, you know, the new world order is your enemy,
[3:46:15.400 --> 3:46:16.560]  whether you figured it out or not,
[3:46:16.560 --> 3:46:17.800]  it's not me, the gringo.
[3:46:19.760 --> 3:46:22.320]  Do gringos predominate the global hierarchy?
[3:46:22.320 --> 3:46:25.920]  Yes, but if you hadn't, Latin Americans
[3:46:25.920 --> 3:46:27.000]  would have gotten all the power,
[3:46:27.000 --> 3:46:30.160]  they'd be the same thing, it's the way humans operate.
[3:46:30.160 --> 3:46:32.400]  But the big gringos have got you convinced
[3:46:32.400 --> 3:46:33.960]  the little gringos are your problem.
[3:46:33.960 --> 3:46:36.200]  When they're real elite and I've got their own documents,
[3:46:36.200 --> 3:46:38.200]  they don't like the little gringos.
[3:46:38.200 --> 3:46:40.880]  They are most worried about the little gringos.
[3:46:40.880 --> 3:46:42.320]  Okay, you understand that?
[3:46:42.320 --> 3:46:45.640]  And you're being used to bring down the middle class,
[3:46:45.640 --> 3:46:49.720]  whether it is a Mexican, Chinese, it doesn't matter.
[3:46:49.720 --> 3:46:53.920]  White, black, it's divide and conquer.
[3:46:53.920 --> 3:46:56.640]  It's called the great game by the British Empire.
[3:46:56.640 --> 3:46:59.280]  Google the great game, art of statescraft,
[3:46:59.280 --> 3:47:01.320]  learn how you're manipulated.
[3:47:06.680 --> 3:47:09.620]  Let's go ahead and play this Grand Theft Auto clip.
[3:47:09.620 --> 3:47:13.920]  This is a piece where they joke around with it basically,
[3:47:13.920 --> 3:47:15.800]  where they've taken video from it and re-edited it.
[3:47:15.800 --> 3:47:20.800]  Here it goes, it's a noisy laptop we're gonna fix it.
[3:47:22.000 --> 3:47:23.760]  My name is Brian O'Toole.
[3:47:23.760 --> 3:47:25.480]  I wanted to fight the war on terror,
[3:47:25.480 --> 3:47:27.000]  but I don't read so good.
[3:47:27.000 --> 3:47:28.680]  Most careers were closed to me.
[3:47:28.680 --> 3:47:31.240]  That's why I joined the LCPD.
[3:47:31.240 --> 3:47:33.960]  Now I'm on the front lines, helping tourists
[3:47:33.960 --> 3:47:35.640]  and fighting terrorists.
[3:47:35.640 --> 3:47:37.520]  I rifle through people's bags on the subway
[3:47:37.520 --> 3:47:38.720]  to protect freedom.
[3:47:38.720 --> 3:47:40.960]  I arrest protesters at political conventions
[3:47:40.960 --> 3:47:43.160]  for spraying outside the free speech zone.
[3:47:43.160 --> 3:47:45.380]  Being a cop used to be about stopping crime.
[3:47:45.380 --> 3:47:48.280]  Now thanks to politicians, it's about fighting terrorists.
[3:47:48.280 --> 3:47:50.240]  One old lady at a time.
[3:47:50.240 --> 3:47:52.840]  I'm protecting freedom, whatever the cost.
[3:47:52.840 --> 3:47:54.600]  I'm a hero, and I know it.
[3:48:02.120 --> 3:48:04.360]  Man, they have got it in this 45 second thing.
[3:48:04.360 --> 3:48:06.760]  I'm gonna play it again, it's just too good.
[3:48:06.760 --> 3:48:08.360]  I'm gonna play it again for you.
[3:48:11.600 --> 3:48:13.400]  My name is Brian O'Toole.
[3:48:13.400 --> 3:48:15.160]  I wanted to fight the war on terror,
[3:48:15.160 --> 3:48:16.640]  but I don't read so good.
[3:48:16.640 --> 3:48:18.320]  Most careers were closed to me.
[3:48:18.320 --> 3:48:20.880]  That's why I joined the LCPD.
[3:48:20.880 --> 3:48:23.600]  Now I'm on the front lines, helping tourists
[3:48:23.600 --> 3:48:25.320]  and fighting terrorists.
[3:48:25.320 --> 3:48:27.160]  I rifle through people's bags on the subway
[3:48:27.160 --> 3:48:28.360]  to protect freedom.
[3:48:28.360 --> 3:48:30.600]  I arrest protesters at political conventions
[3:48:30.600 --> 3:48:32.840]  for spraying outside the free speech zone.
[3:48:32.840 --> 3:48:35.040]  Being a cop used to be about stopping crime.
[3:48:35.040 --> 3:48:37.960]  Now thanks to politicians, it's about fighting terrorists.
[3:48:37.960 --> 3:48:39.920]  One old lady at a time.
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:42.520]  I'm protecting freedom, whatever the cost.
[3:48:42.520 --> 3:48:46.960]  I'm a hero, and I know it.
[3:48:46.960 --> 3:48:48.640]  Man, they really got the mindset.
[3:48:48.640 --> 3:48:50.600]  See how dumb that cop looks on this?
[3:48:50.600 --> 3:48:51.680]  Just totally dumb.
[3:48:51.680 --> 3:48:54.160]  Dumb as a box of rocks, man.
[3:48:54.160 --> 3:48:57.400]  I'm sorry, they're giving retards badges and guns now,
[3:48:57.400 --> 3:48:58.920]  and I've had enough of it.
[3:48:58.920 --> 3:49:00.520]  I mean, I look in some of these guys' eyes.
[3:49:00.520 --> 3:49:01.480]  I mean, when I was a kid growing up,
[3:49:01.480 --> 3:49:03.560]  you see cops who were always kind of shifty
[3:49:03.560 --> 3:49:04.400]  and sneaky looking.
[3:49:04.400 --> 3:49:05.800]  You could tell they were smart.
[3:49:05.800 --> 3:49:07.040]  And now you look at them, it's like,
[3:49:07.040 --> 3:49:10.680]  da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
[3:49:10.680 --> 3:49:13.360]  Man, I'm just not trying to be mean here.
[3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:17.280]  I mean, let them go clean the pigeon traps
[3:49:17.280 --> 3:49:19.920]  at the local park or clean the pools out,
[3:49:19.920 --> 3:49:24.920]  or let them put a helmet on them and let them run around.
[3:49:26.040 --> 3:49:27.240]  Sorry.
[3:49:27.240 --> 3:49:28.560]  Man, I apologize, folks.
[3:49:28.560 --> 3:49:30.360]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[3:49:30.360 --> 3:49:32.880]  The image of that cop swaying back and forth,
[3:49:32.880 --> 3:49:34.840]  whoever did that, got the exact,
[3:49:34.840 --> 3:49:36.520]  I mean, I've looked at them do that,
[3:49:36.520 --> 3:49:39.680]  because they do like this little meerkat dance of power
[3:49:39.680 --> 3:49:40.640]  when they're doing something bad.
[3:49:40.640 --> 3:49:42.880]  They go, do, do, do.
[3:49:42.880 --> 3:49:44.240]  They always do that.
[3:49:44.240 --> 3:49:47.920]  I don't know, man, this is incredible.
[3:49:47.920 --> 3:49:49.880]  Watch it, watch it, here it is.
[3:49:49.880 --> 3:49:51.000]  I can't help it.
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:53.360]  I mean, this is exactly what it looks like right here.
[3:49:53.360 --> 3:49:56.040]  The guy right at the end, I'm gonna pause it on him.
[3:49:56.040 --> 3:49:57.400]  And that's who we're gonna worship.
[3:49:57.400 --> 3:49:58.640]  That's gonna be our new God.
[3:49:58.640 --> 3:50:00.640]  Oh, I'm sorry, I had the audio down.
[3:50:00.640 --> 3:50:02.360]  Let's just restart it here.
[3:50:02.360 --> 3:50:04.000]  Most careers were closed to me.
[3:50:04.000 --> 3:50:06.560]  That's why I joined the LCPD.
[3:50:06.560 --> 3:50:09.280]  Now I'm on the front lines, helping tourists
[3:50:09.280 --> 3:50:10.960]  and fighting terrorists.
[3:50:10.960 --> 3:50:12.800]  I rifle through people's bags on the subway
[3:50:12.800 --> 3:50:14.040]  to protect freedom.
[3:50:14.040 --> 3:50:16.240]  I arrest protesters at political conventions
[3:50:16.240 --> 3:50:18.480]  for straying outside the free speech zone.
[3:50:18.480 --> 3:50:20.680]  Being a cop used to be about stopping crime.
[3:50:20.680 --> 3:50:23.600]  Now thanks to politicians, it's about fighting terrorists.
[3:50:23.600 --> 3:50:25.560]  One old lady at a time.
[3:50:25.560 --> 3:50:28.160]  I'm protecting freedom, whatever the cost.
[3:50:28.160 --> 3:50:29.760]  I'm a hero.
[3:50:29.760 --> 3:50:31.920]  There he is, right there.
[3:50:31.920 --> 3:50:34.520]  That's him, dude, that is the Mac leader.
[3:50:34.520 --> 3:50:37.200]  David New York and others final segment straight ahead
[3:50:37.200 --> 3:50:38.280]  in the zone.
[3:50:38.280 --> 3:50:43.400]  I'll be showing my new film, Truth Rising, coming up
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:45.920]  this Saturday and Sunday at Almodraff House.
[3:50:45.920 --> 3:50:50.160]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[3:50:50.160 --> 3:50:53.040]  In the near future, Earth is dominated
[3:50:53.040 --> 3:50:55.080]  by a powerful world government.
[3:50:55.080 --> 3:50:57.880]  It's known as the Builder Bird Group.
[3:50:57.880 --> 3:51:00.720]  Is that their objective being world domination?
[3:51:00.720 --> 3:51:03.800]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:51:03.800 --> 3:51:06.760]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[3:51:06.760 --> 3:51:10.640]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[3:51:10.640 --> 3:51:11.240]  is at hand.
[3:51:14.240 --> 3:51:16.880]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan
[3:51:16.880 --> 3:51:19.680]  for world government is blown wide open.
[3:51:19.680 --> 3:51:22.400]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world
[3:51:22.400 --> 3:51:23.520]  order agenda.
[3:51:23.520 --> 3:51:25.120]  The Builder Bird is making great progress
[3:51:25.120 --> 3:51:26.080]  toward a world government.
[3:51:26.080 --> 3:51:27.240]  Most people have no idea.
[3:51:27.240 --> 3:51:28.040]  They're not after money.
[3:51:28.040 --> 3:51:29.360]  They have all the money they need.
[3:51:29.360 --> 3:51:30.280]  They're after power.
[3:51:30.280 --> 3:51:31.360]  Yes, they're after music.

[3:51:40.120 --> 3:51:42.960]  In game, blueprint for global enslaved.
[3:51:42.960 --> 3:51:44.880]  You have been warned.
[3:51:44.880 --> 3:51:46.560]  Wake up, Protestant America.
[3:51:46.560 --> 3:51:48.760]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned
[3:51:48.760 --> 3:51:50.200]  to join church and state.
[3:51:50.200 --> 3:51:52.640]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics,
[3:51:52.640 --> 3:51:54.120]  and Protestant denominations will
[3:51:54.120 --> 3:51:56.280]  form one huge political voting bloc.
[3:51:56.280 --> 3:51:58.600]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship
[3:51:58.600 --> 3:52:00.280]  and morality by legislation.
[3:52:00.280 --> 3:52:01.920]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights
[3:52:01.920 --> 3:52:04.320]  to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty
[3:52:04.320 --> 3:52:05.080]  of conscience.
[3:52:05.080 --> 3:52:06.560]  History and the Bible prove to them
[3:52:06.560 --> 3:52:08.440]  that these two systems, church and state,
[3:52:08.440 --> 3:52:09.680]  must be kept separate.
[3:52:09.680 --> 3:52:12.080]  It must be our love of God and of country
[3:52:12.080 --> 3:52:13.760]  that prompts or constrains us.
[3:52:13.760 --> 3:52:16.400]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[3:52:16.400 --> 3:52:18.800]  From history, we saw that when church and state united,
[3:52:18.800 --> 3:52:21.680]  known as papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[3:52:21.680 --> 3:52:23.480]  This union would go directly contrary
[3:52:23.480 --> 3:52:25.280]  to the great principles of our nation.
[3:52:25.280 --> 3:52:28.160]  America and papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[3:52:28.160 --> 3:52:30.880]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[3:52:30.880 --> 3:52:32.800]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[3:52:32.800 --> 3:52:38.280]  Jesus is coming soon for free materials call 888-211-1715
[3:52:38.280 --> 3:52:44.320]  or write the Bible says Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee 37771.
[3:52:44.320 --> 3:52:46.400]  Attention GCN listeners, would you
[3:52:46.400 --> 3:52:49.240]  like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned
[3:52:49.240 --> 3:52:50.400]  TV on your computer?
[3:52:50.400 --> 3:52:52.960]  Well, now you can watch satellite TV on your PC
[3:52:52.960 --> 3:52:54.920]  with an extremely simple hookup that
[3:52:54.920 --> 3:52:57.160]  allows computer owners to pick up more channels
[3:52:57.160 --> 3:52:59.560]  than any sane person can even watch
[3:52:59.560 --> 3:53:02.240]  without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[3:53:02.240 --> 3:53:04.920]  Here's the story, new video feed technology
[3:53:04.920 --> 3:53:07.080]  lets anyone with a high speed internet connection
[3:53:07.080 --> 3:53:09.800]  gain instant access to an endless list of underground
[3:53:09.800 --> 3:53:11.560]  channels from all over the globe.
[3:53:11.560 --> 3:53:14.320]  And here's the best part, it's 100% legal.
[3:53:14.320 --> 3:53:16.040]  And it works at home, the office,
[3:53:16.040 --> 3:53:19.000]  or even in other countries to grab television channels
[3:53:19.000 --> 3:53:20.840]  and video feeds at your command.
[3:53:20.840 --> 3:53:23.840]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy
[3:53:23.840 --> 3:53:25.640]  videos absolutely free.
[3:53:25.640 --> 3:53:27.880]  Best of all, you could be watching free TV
[3:53:27.880 --> 3:53:29.960]  on your PC in five minutes or less.
[3:53:29.960 --> 3:53:31.120]  It's that simple.
[3:53:31.120 --> 3:53:34.720]  Just go to www.OrderFreeTV.com.
[3:53:34.720 --> 3:53:38.000]  That's www.OrderFreeTV.com.
[3:53:38.000 --> 3:53:40.560]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC,
[3:53:40.560 --> 3:53:45.520]  go to www.OrderFreeTV.com.
[3:53:45.520 --> 3:54:02.520]  Let's hear it, let's hear it.
[3:54:02.520 --> 3:54:05.920]  That's why you Genesis want to kill you.
[3:54:05.920 --> 3:54:07.920]  Take a shot, take a shot.
[3:54:07.920 --> 3:54:11.240]  Let's go ahead and get sterilized.
[3:54:11.240 --> 3:54:13.040]  Because the government loves you.
[3:54:13.040 --> 3:54:15.640]  You know we've got to find you.
[3:54:15.640 --> 3:54:17.920]  You know we're going to kill you.
[3:54:17.920 --> 3:54:22.960]  To bring some love in here today, yeah.
[3:54:22.960 --> 3:54:23.880]  We're the criminal government.
[3:54:23.880 --> 3:54:25.680]  Father, father, father.
[3:54:25.680 --> 3:54:27.360]  Criminal, criminal, criminal.
[3:54:27.360 --> 3:54:29.240]  We don't need to ask for it.
[3:54:29.240 --> 3:54:32.320]  Criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal.
[3:54:32.320 --> 3:54:35.280]  You see, well, war is not the answer.
[3:54:35.280 --> 3:54:36.840]  I got this AB Club newspaper.
[3:54:36.840 --> 3:54:38.760]  It's about Chris Carter, creator of the X-Files.
[3:54:38.760 --> 3:54:40.880]  He's making a new X-Files movie.
[3:54:40.880 --> 3:54:43.680]  And I was reading this this morning
[3:54:43.680 --> 3:54:44.680]  and I meant to get to it today.
[3:54:44.680 --> 3:54:47.480]  I'm going to leave it on my desk and try to cover it tomorrow.
[3:54:47.480 --> 3:54:49.480]  But he just said, oh, you thought the old X-Files
[3:54:49.480 --> 3:54:51.480]  thought the government was bad behind everything.
[3:54:51.480 --> 3:54:53.520]  He goes, I really now believe that.
[3:54:53.520 --> 3:54:55.160]  And basically our country's gone.
[3:54:55.160 --> 3:54:58.600]  And so my new film says the government's pure evil.
[3:54:58.600 --> 3:55:00.640]  And then that is, we just found out on their website,
[3:55:00.640 --> 3:55:04.160]  that is a Grand Theft Auto trailer.
[3:55:04.160 --> 3:55:05.960]  And what's the tagline?
[3:55:05.960 --> 3:55:08.400]  The American Dream, Wake Up.
[3:55:08.400 --> 3:55:11.120]  And my gosh, and Chris Carter says everybody's
[3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:12.440]  woken up to the government.
[3:55:12.440 --> 3:55:15.080]  I think you guys went too far like with Chilchescu.
[3:55:15.080 --> 3:55:18.160]  So go ahead, hire some more SWAT teams, waddle around,
[3:55:18.160 --> 3:55:20.840]  have Halliburton moved to Dubai and run public white slave
[3:55:20.840 --> 3:55:21.720]  rings.
[3:55:21.720 --> 3:55:23.200]  It's over.
[3:55:23.200 --> 3:55:25.280]  And for the good cops and good people in government,
[3:55:25.280 --> 3:55:27.640]  I suggest you join us quickly.
[3:55:27.640 --> 3:55:29.760]  Because when Grand Theft Auto, and it doesn't get any more
[3:55:29.760 --> 3:55:34.320]  pop culture than that, when Grand Theft Auto wakes up,
[3:55:34.320 --> 3:55:38.920]  the New World Order has got a serious, serious problem.
[3:55:38.920 --> 3:55:40.560]  It's a nice young lady right there.
[3:55:40.560 --> 3:55:42.400]  I'm sure she's very good.
[3:55:42.400 --> 3:55:44.400]  I'll be a college student working hard.
[3:55:47.120 --> 3:55:50.280]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[3:55:50.280 --> 3:55:52.640]  Oh, I'm going to, never mind.
[3:55:52.640 --> 3:55:54.800]  The game Grand Theft Auto has prostitutes in it.
[3:55:54.800 --> 3:55:55.800]  That's the joke.
[3:55:55.800 --> 3:55:57.920]  Ah, I believe that, I never played it.
[3:55:57.920 --> 3:55:59.240]  And in the case of Burmese, yeah.
[3:55:59.240 --> 3:56:01.560]  Burmese is an expert on everything like that.
[3:56:01.560 --> 3:56:04.160]  Ah, all right, I'm going to knock it off.
[3:56:04.160 --> 3:56:06.760]  This is not a comedy show, and I know I'm not funny.
[3:56:06.760 --> 3:56:09.120]  David New York, go ahead.
[3:56:09.120 --> 3:56:10.320]  How are you doing, Alex?
[3:56:10.320 --> 3:56:10.760]  Good, sir.
[3:56:10.760 --> 3:56:11.400]  What's on your mind?
[3:56:11.400 --> 3:56:13.360]  I'm trying to, I'll try to be as quick as possible,
[3:56:13.360 --> 3:56:14.720]  since I know it's almost four o'clock.
[3:56:14.720 --> 3:56:19.360]  But I just want to thank you for informing me seven years ago.
[3:56:19.360 --> 3:56:21.800]  But one thing I don't actually know,
[3:56:21.800 --> 3:56:24.400]  but it does thicken me that I think the government is
[3:56:24.400 --> 3:56:25.720]  behind age, since you're actually
[3:56:25.720 --> 3:56:27.040]  talking about bioweapons.
[3:56:27.040 --> 3:56:28.200]  Oh, there's no doubt they're behind it.
[3:56:28.200 --> 3:56:29.320]  It's a fact, sir.
[3:56:29.320 --> 3:56:31.680]  So I know I was actually reading and looking
[3:56:31.680 --> 3:56:33.040]  at the flow chart online.
[3:56:33.040 --> 3:56:34.560]  I'm just also wondering, have you ever
[3:56:34.560 --> 3:56:37.960]  had Dr. Boydie Graves on your show?
[3:56:37.960 --> 3:56:39.600]  Yes, I have.
[3:56:39.600 --> 3:56:42.720]  Would it be possible, maybe, for you to actually get him up
[3:56:42.720 --> 3:56:45.640]  again, because I definitely would like to hear you question him
[3:56:45.640 --> 3:56:48.040]  and figure out, because I actually question everything.
[3:56:48.040 --> 3:56:50.760]  But the minute I saw the flow chart, it kind of opened my mind.
[3:56:50.760 --> 3:56:54.240]  Because like you said, it's kind of hard to even think that in.
[3:56:54.240 --> 3:56:57.120]  And it thickens me since a lot of people's friends' families
[3:56:57.120 --> 3:56:58.520]  have died because of it.
[3:56:58.520 --> 3:57:00.160]  So it says you're on the topic of bioweapons.
[3:57:00.160 --> 3:57:01.320]  That's right.
[3:57:01.320 --> 3:57:03.040]  No, I hear it. It's a saddening topic.
[3:57:03.040 --> 3:57:06.720]  I shouldn't be joking around while you're even talking about it.
[3:57:06.720 --> 3:57:07.760]  It's terrible.
[3:57:07.760 --> 3:57:09.760]  And we're going to have more guests on about that.
[3:57:09.760 --> 3:57:11.480]  We've been having guests on about it.
[3:57:11.480 --> 3:57:14.640]  In game two, I don't know if I'm going to call it in game two.
[3:57:14.640 --> 3:57:17.240]  I might call it 2012 something.
[3:57:17.240 --> 3:57:21.240]  But that certainly is something we're working on, sir.
[3:57:21.240 --> 3:57:23.080]  You're talking recently about bioweapons.
[3:57:23.080 --> 3:57:25.200]  And most of your audience is informed.
[3:57:25.200 --> 3:57:28.080]  So to those that are listening in that don't know,
[3:57:28.080 --> 3:57:29.760]  that way you can open up their mind
[3:57:29.760 --> 3:57:32.560]  and also have other people that have no idea about it.
[3:57:32.560 --> 3:57:34.720]  So I think that's something that should really be talked about.
[3:57:34.720 --> 3:57:36.320]  Hi, here we are. We're out of time, David.
[3:57:36.320 --> 3:57:40.360]  Thank you. I'll be back tomorrow live 11 to 3 Central Standard Time.

[3:57:46.280 --> 3:57:47.480]  We missed any of it.
[3:57:47.480 --> 3:57:51.280]  If you just tuned in, the start of the show from four hours ago
