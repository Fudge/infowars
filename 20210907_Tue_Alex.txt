[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.000 --> 00:18.000]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.000 --> 00:43.000]  The front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:43.000 --> 00:50.000]  They're constantly monitored by facial recognition cameras that are able to instantly put a face to a name.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  Now the Chinese are also ranked, given a mark out of a possible 950 points.
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  A score in the 700s is considered good, around the 500 mark is not.
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  It forces us to be well-behaved.
[01:04.000 --> 01:14.000]  And then there's Joanne. She's an information collector, a paid enforcer who walks around and writes down deeds about her neighbors.
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  Like the man who carried a drunk person home.
[01:17.000 --> 01:22.000]  Things like this are good deeds, she said, but the farmer overheard swearing and being rude.
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.000]  Yeah, bad deeds.
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  Her quota is 10 a month.
[01:26.000 --> 01:34.000]  In countries such as India, there's little choice. People there must download a state-backed tracing app if they want to travel.
[01:34.000 --> 01:56.000]  From January, every citizen of England and Wales will have a new social credit score. Government and private companies may use your social credit score to make decisions about you.
[01:56.000 --> 02:04.000]  It may include everything from your address to criminal history. That data then used to generate a reputation score.
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  A bad reputation can hurt you personally and professionally.
[02:08.000 --> 02:17.000]  Australians force to submit 100 points of identification like their driver's license or passport when using social media accounts like Facebook and Twitter.
[02:17.000 --> 02:28.000]  The police would have access to those social media accounts and it's all part of a crackdown on online abuse. Now users could be liable for defamation suits or even criminal prosecution.
[02:28.000 --> 02:38.000]  It's all part of a plan hoping to deter people from engaging in bad behaviour. Now the recommendations were handed down by a federal parliamentary inquiry.
[02:38.000 --> 02:50.000]  They're bad, they're just going to ban you from the internet. And that's the holy grail of control. It also says the police will have access to everyone's stuff without a warrant, live time, and that they'll be able to quote,
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  impersonate you, to quote, infiltrate anti-vax groups and disrupt them.
[02:55.000 --> 03:07.000]  It's not going to be safe for people who are not vaccinated to be roaming around the place spreading the virus. That's what they'll be doing. So there's every reason, every reason to get vaccinated.
[03:07.000 --> 03:17.000]  Australia can force citizens to report their location on demand via government tracking app. Home quarantine trial, that's the app, to be launched in South Australia, premier Stephen Marshall announces.
[03:17.000 --> 03:24.000]  First they lock you up in little prison cells, then they go, oh, you'll carry your phone now, now you're allowed to go home, but we got to track you like an ankle bracelet.
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  Israel's done this too. And then it's, oh, everybody gets it. See?
[03:28.000 --> 03:37.000]  So the cops come around and tell this woman off staying over here as well, because there was about five seconds in between her taking a cup of, a sip of a cup of tea.
[03:37.000 --> 03:48.000]  And she took her face mask down. Cops came around literally on the dock and just pulled her up for it. And she said, well, I'm drinking my tea. And they said, well, not right now, you're not putting face masks on.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  Canada's most populous province announces the same thing, basically, ankle bracelets.
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  It's called Immuna Band, a first of its kind wearable piece of vaccine identification.
[03:59.000 --> 04:07.000]  It's nothing extravagant, but it's valuable for sure. It's a wristband that has a QR code on the back that links to your vaccination card.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  So there's an ability to access the initial documentation.
[04:11.000 --> 04:18.000]  Italian diocese announces vaccine passports needed to go to church. Honolulu announces the same thing.
[04:18.000 --> 04:25.000]  Hawaii announces the same thing. Apples merged with it to carry it out. Google and Apple are the same company behind the scenes.
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  They're all run by the NSH CIA and in globalist banks, Rothschild, Rockefeller Money.
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.000]  They are competing only on the surface to be the world ID.
[04:33.000 --> 04:44.000]  They've been in agreement a year and a half ago secretly, but it leaked to have a secret app embedded in all phones that they jointly controlled together.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  Well, it's a new report. It just went up. Last night, it needs to be seen by everybody.
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  It could change the courts of history because it is the global state cover.
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.000]  It's a Band-Aught video. Click the left-hand corner top area of the John Bound section.
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  It's beast system swallows freedom worldwide.
[05:01.000 --> 05:09.000]  This headline is not a joke. This is America in September of 2020.
[05:09.000 --> 05:16.000]  We see court sends man to jail for watching conspiracy theory videos online.
[05:16.000 --> 05:33.000]  Yes, it says the police did a spot check for quote compliance at his home and found him in his garage watching rumble social media site, which they say is a conspiracy site.
[05:33.000 --> 05:41.000]  Also, he admitted to watching Mike Lindell's three-day cyber symposium. Yes, it was part of the conditions of his bail.
[05:41.000 --> 05:47.000]  The judge said he could not look at any videos questioning the election. No joke.
[05:47.000 --> 05:53.000]  And so they sent the stars into his house and caught him doing it. So now he's going into solitary confinement.
[05:53.000 --> 06:03.000]  Communism has come to America. The Republic has fallen.
[06:24.000 --> 06:31.000]  Send in the clowns.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  Don't bother.
[06:34.000 --> 06:45.000]  They're here.
[06:45.000 --> 06:55.000]  Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer?
[06:55.000 --> 07:04.000]  Losing my timing this late in my career.
[07:04.000 --> 07:11.000]  Where are the clowns?
[07:11.000 --> 07:17.000]  There ought to be clowns.
[07:17.000 --> 07:27.000]  Well, maybe next year.
[07:27.000 --> 07:34.000]  It's Tuesday, September 7th. The year is 2021.
[07:34.000 --> 07:41.000]  I always try to be calm. Those are really my best broadcasts. Not normally pretty even keeled.
[07:41.000 --> 07:48.000]  But the mainstream media loves to get the parts where I blow up and yell and scream. And it's entertaining, but they love to try to pigeonhole us as being maniacs.
[07:48.000 --> 08:03.000]  But, you know, it was very goldwater, really in the last century, one of the main people that fought the New World Order and helped build a movement we have today that Ron Paul and Donald Trump and others stood on top of and myself as well in his shoulders.
[08:03.000 --> 08:12.000]  That said, extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.
[08:12.000 --> 08:21.000]  Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice. He also said, sometimes silence isn't golden, it's yellow.
[08:21.000 --> 08:29.000]  Like yellow bellies. Why do they call that in war? Some people fall to the ground and get the catatonic fetal position and urinate on themselves.
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.000]  That's where the term yellow belly comes from, is people pissing themselves.
[08:34.000 --> 08:43.000]  And I can assure you that silence in these times is not golden. It's not like you're watching a sunset with your wife or your husband or your children.
[08:43.000 --> 08:49.000]  It's not like you're meditating or praying. It's not that type of golden silence. It's yellow.
[08:49.000 --> 08:59.000]  And again, I'm not complaining. I did probably three hours of research last night, about four hours of research earlier than that throughout the day.
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.000]  I did several hours of research late last night. I couldn't help myself.
[09:04.000 --> 09:11.000]  And so it's kind of like somebody that goes to a buffet dinner and orders 20 plates, even though you can't consume at all.
[09:11.000 --> 09:21.000]  But I think I have a responsibility to really try to cover all this. As I've said many times, if you're a TV viewer, you can see this, radio listeners can obviously see this later when it's archived at Bandit Video
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  where the live feeds at infowars.com.
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  That's how we override these sensors.
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.000]  But let me just do this before I drill into the top stories. Let me just give you some big announcements.
[09:34.000 --> 09:48.000]  Major journalistic organizations will get into the intercept and others did FOIA request of Fauci and gain of function research at Wuhan and Chapel Hill, North Carolina and USA and China.
[09:48.000 --> 10:07.000]  And it's hundreds of pages of Fauci directing chimeric merger of five viruses into a COVID SARS virus to then quote make a super vaccine for something that didn't exist in the entire evolutionary system of this planet, but was manufactured.
[10:07.000 --> 10:14.000]  So I mean, it's already a fact they built it. They did it. That's already there. But now he's lied to Congress three times and it's open and shut documents.
[10:14.000 --> 10:22.000]  I could do, I could read the documents and cover the news for 30 minutes and then take calls the rest of the show for three and a half hours.
[10:22.000 --> 10:31.000]  And we would not scratch the surface. I mean, it's mega bombshell. He should be swat teamed by the FBI yesterday.
[10:31.000 --> 10:38.000]  But of course, he won't be because he's a Rothschild, Rockefeller, eugenicist, depopulationist frontman.
[10:38.000 --> 10:56.000]  But he did it with Gates and the rest of them. And it's also a scientific fact in the mainline literature that India basically suspended its vaccine program at 7% of the population because they made their own whole virus vaccine.
[10:56.000 --> 11:11.000]  And again, the virus is so deadly in its spike protein, not in what it actually carries that when the body created a response to that, it was also very poisonous. And so India had to stop because of so many deaths, people were a revolted.
[11:11.000 --> 11:25.000]  And the vaccine they made did knock out all these COVID variants except the Delta variant that is now 99% plus of the cases in the United States is 1000 times plus more viral than the original COVID.
[11:25.000 --> 11:40.000]  And then I also had Dr. McCullough on and he had all the documents confirming for major studies that indeed people are shedding that have had the shots and it's lowering their immune system and they're getting antibody derangement basically in their body.
[11:40.000 --> 12:00.000]  And this is all happening. And by the way, it's not debated. It's like you don't debate what temperature water freezes that you don't debate what temperature it boils that the or what the speed of sound is or what the speed of light is or what the atomic weight of uranium is or fluoride.
[12:00.000 --> 12:18.000]  These are known things. And that's what's so incredible. It's known Fauci created this and then released it obviously on purpose, then lied about it. It's known that they knew that if they created a vaccine for even the common cold, it creates deadly super viruses that are much more destructive.
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.000]  That's why they could never do it. They've been trying for 70 years. Animal and human studies killed people and animals every frickin time. Usually the majority died.
[12:26.000 --> 12:39.000]  So just getting your minds around that in my mind and then let me add this, Australia has now announced and their prime minister sits back and turns a blind eye. He's in on it.
[12:39.000 --> 12:47.000]  He acts like a conservative and says they're fighting China and all this, but really it's to get his public behind him while he sells them out.
[12:47.000 --> 12:59.000]  The head of New South Wales and two other major most populous areas in the south have all announced it's all part of a UN plan. They admit I've got the documents from beginning of those that the lockdown is permanent for everybody.
[12:59.000 --> 13:09.000]  You're going to get booster shots every few months forever. I have a vaccine and that the unvaccinated will be on permanent lockdown and will be put in camps.
[13:09.000 --> 13:19.000]  So now we have the video and I have the news articles. They're announcing that you will be put in reeducation camps. Actually say we're going to put you in camps until you understand it's safe and you take it.
[13:19.000 --> 13:33.000]  That's called a reeducation camp. And of course, Obama created a reeducation camp program. You can type in Obama, reeducation camp, click web search and you'll get 2010 document that was leaked to us in 2012.
[13:33.000 --> 13:42.000]  And it was confirmed real by the army says restricted do not release was given to us by people that said they were with army intelligence and it turned out to be a real document.
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  So and they were freaked out about it. Obviously it's concentration camps for Americans.
[13:46.000 --> 14:01.000]  So this has always been the leftist plan. The weathermen got caught by Larry Grafwald was a green beret back from Vietnam. They tried to recruit him at Columbia to put 50 million people in camps once they took over the government and to kill 25 million.
[14:01.000 --> 14:10.000]  That's back when the US had a 200 million population. So the numbers are much higher. So this is all out of control, but it's real.
[14:10.000 --> 14:35.000]  Now, that's just the surface. I'm not even that's three stacks of 12345678910111314151617. That's a giant three inch stack 17181920212222 stacks. Every one of these, you could do a whole show.
[14:35.000 --> 14:51.000]  I have this stack right here is the UN officially announcing they're going to in parenthood and put children in camps worldwide via COVID, including the US, and that it's the end of the family and that the family is bad.
[14:51.000 --> 15:01.000]  Officially from the UN, I'm going to show you the official government document that's their end game as your children. That's one stack right here.
[15:01.000 --> 15:13.000]  Then we have the FBI saying people protesting. People held in solitary confinement for misdemeanors in DC 600 people are terrorists and need to be physically attacked, basically.
[15:13.000 --> 15:27.000]  And the DC is on a red alert. Meanwhile, they're catching more people that have been indicted or really Democrat Antifa operatives that are now arguing in court that they should be released because they're really anti for Democrats that
[15:27.000 --> 15:39.000]  went to set up Trump. Wow. And of course, the judge is throwing the book at him saying, you're not supposed to say that. I was going to let you go. That's even in the news. Why did you just say that in court? Boom, back to prison.
[15:39.000 --> 15:52.000]  Yeah. Oh, you little anti for guys are being thrown into the bus by your by the other thieves you work with. There's no honor amongst thieves. Folks, we are in an information war, proof against lies. Only you can override the sensors.
[15:52.000 --> 16:04.000]  However, you're listening to folks tune in now, now, now. If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:04.000 --> 16:14.000]  Here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock. These emergency backup systems provide life saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:14.000 --> 16:23.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:23.000 --> 16:32.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:32.000 --> 16:44.000]  Even better all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off the grid bonuses to go to my solar backup dot com to learn more and check availability. That's my solar backup dot com.
[16:44.000 --> 16:55.000]  Look for the free report crisis cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage. Yours free at my solar backup dot com.
[16:55.000 --> 17:04.000]  Hey everybody, if you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news. In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:04.000 --> 17:19.000]  Here's the thing, we've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans. These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious and above all with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:19.000 --> 17:30.000]  The best part, we've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to, gets even better.
[17:30.000 --> 17:42.000]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world, period.
[17:42.000 --> 17:55.000]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com and discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[18:12.000 --> 18:20.000]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[18:20.000 --> 18:29.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[18:29.000 --> 18:34.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, and we've also got to get personally prepared.
[18:34.000 --> 18:42.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food, you've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[18:42.000 --> 18:47.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[18:47.000 --> 19:07.000]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits, because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[19:18.000 --> 19:22.000]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  Living defense brought me back.
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.000]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[19:29.000 --> 19:41.000]  This is Matthew 24 verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[19:41.000 --> 19:46.000]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  That's right where we're at brother.
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say.
[19:52.000 --> 20:18.000]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[20:23.000 --> 20:29.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.000]  Live from the info wars.com studios.
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on the September 7th.
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  Tuesday broadcast.
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  And I want to talk big picture for one more segment.
[20:56.000 --> 21:04.000]  When we come back, I'm going to judiciously drill into every single bit of this information.
[21:04.000 --> 21:07.000]  But I'm going to explain this again.
[21:07.000 --> 21:14.000]  The globalists have made the decision and have put it out in so many public statements and documents and internal reports.
[21:14.000 --> 21:23.000]  And State Department memorandums and EU memorandums and Bilderberg group and Davos statements that it makes my head spin.
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  And they've said, we're going to take over the world.
[21:26.000 --> 21:27.000]  We're going to lock everything down.
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  We're going to cut your resources off.
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.000]  Then we're going to have people fight with each other over resources.
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  And we're going to build an authoritarian society.
[21:37.000 --> 21:43.000]  And then we're going to forcibly accelerate depopulation.
[21:43.000 --> 21:54.000]  So they say we are building an absolute dystopic system.
[21:54.000 --> 22:06.000]  And now it's again gone from beta to operational.
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  And I understand that most people aren't built to even be able to face something like this.
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  And I understand a lot of other people just are overwhelmed and say, well, what can we do?
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.000]  But progressively at a very quick pace, things are going to get much worse.
[22:20.000 --> 22:31.000]  And going along with this ensures a absolutely nightmarish dystopic future that the globalists have charted for us.
[22:31.000 --> 22:45.000]  Because at the end of the day, they are very psychotic, evil, twisted, wicked people that enjoy masochistic actions.
[22:45.000 --> 22:49.000]  So here's what you have to know.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  They created the virus at Wuhan.
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  They released it.
[22:53.000 --> 23:01.000]  And they already knew from studies they'd done on humans and animals with the system in China, with the government, that they test on people there.
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.000]  Now they test on people here.
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  They test on all of us now, or it was even approved.
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.000]  And they knew what it would mutate into and what it would do.
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  And they had countless other studies that showed all that as well.
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  And it's a fact that we got the Delta variant from a vaccine.
[23:15.000 --> 23:19.000]  And it's a fact that people that take these shots are shedding.
[23:19.000 --> 23:22.000]  And it's a fact that Fauci cooked it up.
[23:22.000 --> 23:40.000]  And it's a fact that in the EU and the UK and in Australia and Canada, they're either still under lockdown or bringing lockdowns back and bringing in social credit scores and high tech tracking systems that control everyone in live time,
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  not to free you and let you go out and have fun again.
[23:44.000 --> 23:52.000]  No, they say to then bring in the carbon tax and the calorie tax and the tracking tax, the environmental tax.
[23:52.000 --> 24:03.000]  And it's not just me telling you that now, 10 years ago, two years ago, six months ago, I have a whole stack right here that I'll get to today on the Great Reset.
[24:03.000 --> 24:11.000]  Great Reset UN orders 10 year deadline for Australia to shut down entire coal industry to fight climate change.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  We already are shutting it down under that order.
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.000]  The UN is in control of our medical system, in control of big tech, in control of what you can say and what you can do.
[24:20.000 --> 24:25.000]  And we're living in this and Congress has done nothing.
[24:25.000 --> 24:44.000]  The states have done almost nothing as a foreign multinational conglomerate of corporations that created the United Nations of the Rockefeller Foundation take over the planet, not just so they can run things and be in power, but so they can carry out eugenics and total control and build the prison planet.
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  You know, we don't update it anymore.
[24:46.000 --> 24:56.000]  It was a backup site for info wars.com and Paul Watson used to update it and Paul Watson quasi does some work with us, but really doesn't anymore. So no one even updates prison planet.com anymore.
[24:56.000 --> 25:05.000]  Let's put prison planet.com used to be bigger than info wars on screen. Who knows the last time it was updated. I'm going to hire some people and reboot that site.
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  But I started that site 20 something years ago.
[25:09.000 --> 25:13.000]  Yeah, just put in prison planet.com for me and the search engine.
[25:13.000 --> 25:22.000]  Oh, people quit using it. So I forgot a month ago I directed people to direct him to band on video. That's right. But we're going to resurrect that site.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  But yeah, it takes for a month. I mean, it redirects to band up video.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  So that's where we are.
[25:27.000 --> 25:33.000]  We don't even have the staff or the money or the crew.
[25:33.000 --> 25:43.000]  To be able to even have a site that's been around 20 years that predicted everything even stay up or be updated.
[25:43.000 --> 25:50.000]  I'm not complaining. But so much of our crew that we built up and we expanded and we funded when I got the platform.
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.000]  Didn't cut and run but just kind of stood back.
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.000]  Well, that's why they'll be fed on destroyed later, which is not something I'm even happy about.
[26:00.000 --> 26:06.000]  But but that's the level of this fight. So see this isn't a problem coming down the road.
[26:06.000 --> 26:13.000]  This is a problem in our living rooms. This is a nightmare system.
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.000]  And I have the leaders of Australia and the news articles announcing you'll take shots every couple of months.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  Last week it was every five months.
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  A month ago it was.
[26:21.000 --> 26:27.000]  Oh, just take your two shots.
[26:27.000 --> 26:36.000]  Think about that. And now they're on Australian TV saying, oh, yeah, you're not going to be able to ever get off lockdown if you're not vaccinated.
[26:36.000 --> 26:45.000]  But of course, when you go get the app and you accept the shots, you're under lockdown still to the same premiere of New South Wales said, oh, sorry, the lockdown never ends.
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  Even if you have the shot, the shot doesn't work.
[26:47.000 --> 26:56.000]  See, it's called martial law and you go in your house and you never come out again and the store shelves are empty and that's the post industrial world.
[26:56.000 --> 27:05.000]  And then when things break down, they go, oh, we've got a social credit score and we've got a universal guaranteed income.
[27:05.000 --> 27:13.000]  All of you now are on the dole, but you've got to show up to dig ditches or to grow crops under our control.
[27:13.000 --> 27:23.000]  Just like China had the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution where they made the farmers leave their land and the shopkeepers leave their land and go to these communal farms.
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  And 100 million Chinese basically died and started to death.
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  That's what they're doing.
[27:27.000 --> 27:39.000]  The Great Reset is killing the local economy, killing the small businesses, and is a classic Marxist, Leninist, Maoist playbook, and they even admit it's that playbook.
[27:39.000 --> 27:45.000]  And so whether it's the UK or Canada or now in blue cities in the U.S., they're saying, oh, you remember lockdowns?
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  Those are going to be permanent on an app on your phone.
[27:48.000 --> 27:55.000]  It'll tell you, according to your social credit score, when you can leave your house, when you can go to the mall, when you can go to the grocery store.
[27:55.000 --> 28:01.000]  It'll lots of your time to go here and go there with the big technocracy supercomputers running your life.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  Google isn't there, and Apple and Twitter and Facebook aren't there to make your life better.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  There there is an AI system to direct everything you do and where you go.
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  And now we played in the first five minutes of the show that powerful John Bowne report.
[28:14.000 --> 28:19.000]  We put it on screen please, where he shows you newscasting.
[28:19.000 --> 28:27.000]  Europe, Canada, Australia, and China all announcing what's now coming to New York, LA, and other areas.
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  These systems swallows freedom worldwide.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  Is your church going to show this this weekend?
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  No. They're not a church. They're on the payroll.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  Is your is your club?
[28:36.000 --> 28:43.000]  No, they're all going to go along with it like morons as they're inducted into the control grid prison.
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.000]  And they're so full of themselves because they're the good little enforcers,
[28:46.000 --> 28:51.000]  even though they're helping bring in a system that's about a post-human world where we're all obsolete,
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  where we're all non-essential. Stay with us.
[28:54.000 --> 28:59.000]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too.
[28:59.000 --> 29:06.000]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:06.000 --> 29:11.000]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:11.000 --> 29:14.000]  You probably already believe that. I certainly do.
[29:14.000 --> 29:19.000]  So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.

[32:02.000 --> 32:14.000]  333139 is the infowarstore hotline.
[32:14.000 --> 32:21.000]  333139 is the infowarstore hotline.
[32:21.000 --> 32:27.000]  333139 is the infowarstore hotline.
[32:27.000 --> 32:34.000]  If a War Store.com is simply the best, infowarstore.com beats out all the rest.
[32:57.000 --> 33:15.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:15.000 --> 33:20.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, we now take you live to the Central Texas
[33:20.600 --> 33:45.600]  Command Center and the heart of the resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[33:45.600 --> 34:03.600]  The police are running over people all over the western world with horses.
[34:03.600 --> 34:08.600]  Attack dogs are ripping people's faces off while they're in handcuffs.
[34:08.600 --> 34:13.600]  Children are being pepper sprayed because they leave their houses.
[34:13.600 --> 34:16.600]  The leftists have now taken over the police department's most part of the world.
[34:16.600 --> 34:24.600]  You see gangs of women with batons beating women, children, and their husbands over the head with clubs.
[34:24.600 --> 34:27.600]  In France, they've announced forced inoculations of all the children.
[34:27.600 --> 34:29.600]  They say, we don't care of the law.
[34:29.600 --> 34:30.600]  Doesn't even say we can't do it.
[34:30.600 --> 34:31.600]  We're doing it.
[34:31.600 --> 34:33.600]  And Australia is doing the same.
[34:33.600 --> 34:41.600]  And as announced, if you're quote, unvaccinated, you will be put on permanent lockdown and moved to camps.
[34:41.600 --> 34:49.600]  And they say in the newspapers, I've got them right here, you will then be educated on why you should take the shot.
[34:49.600 --> 34:53.600]  So, oh, and they're going to take your children.
[34:53.600 --> 34:56.600]  This is how wars start.
[34:56.600 --> 35:00.600]  These police are soldiers now of a foreign multinational depopulation army.
[35:00.600 --> 35:05.600]  They may be too stupid to know it, but they're doing it.
[35:05.600 --> 35:07.600]  And I want to explain something and then I'm going to get into the news here.
[35:07.600 --> 35:10.600]  This is the most important thing I've said in a long time.
[35:10.600 --> 35:13.600]  We'll say two things.
[35:13.600 --> 35:22.600]  The nature of evil and the nature of those that want to dominate and control others always takes basically the same forms and call it fascism, communism, socialism.
[35:22.600 --> 35:24.600]  You can call it authoritarianism.
[35:24.600 --> 35:27.600]  You can call it tyranny.
[35:27.600 --> 35:29.600]  And, oh, look at this dad caught in the park with his daughter.
[35:29.600 --> 35:30.600]  You're not allowed to do that.
[35:30.600 --> 35:31.600]  You're going to jail.
[35:31.600 --> 35:35.600]  I mean, these are all real videos I'm showing to TV viewers and there's thousands of them.
[35:35.600 --> 35:36.600]  Endless supply, everyday hundreds.
[35:36.600 --> 35:39.600]  I can't even watch them all.
[35:39.600 --> 35:50.600]  And so when good people do nothing, when good people put up with a tyrannical takeover, it's like opening a door, a bulkhead on a submarine.
[35:50.600 --> 35:52.600]  You're going to flood.
[35:52.600 --> 36:01.600]  It's the nature of the corrupt and their minions that they want to dominate and they want to take people's freedoms and they want to bully people.
[36:01.600 --> 36:06.600]  And they finally want to rape and exploit and starve and kill you.
[36:06.600 --> 36:10.600]  So understand, there isn't a vacuum in the universe.
[36:10.600 --> 36:26.600]  When good people don't stand up, when good people don't say no, when good people don't put the brakes on tyranny, it's like hitting in an 18-wheeler on a big mountain road that goes down for 5,000 feet and taking your foot off the brake.
[36:26.600 --> 36:32.600]  You're going to go about 150 miles an hour and you're going to fly off the side into a chasm.
[36:32.600 --> 36:37.600]  The establishment has a compulsion to dominate and control.
[36:37.600 --> 36:47.600]  The type of people that get into that level of power have an instinct to want to kill you, they see you as useless eaters getting in the way of their planet.
[36:47.600 --> 36:54.600]  Allah, Zardaz and Sean Connery in the 1970s.
[36:54.600 --> 37:06.600]  Or Roger Moore and Moonraker, I mean it's all there in Hollywood telling you what's coming and now it's not Hollywood, it's here.
[37:06.600 --> 37:14.600]  And so this will only get worse as Thomas Jefferson was asked what is the level of tyranny that man will live under.
[37:14.600 --> 37:32.600]  And he said the level to which you will accept is the level to which there will be evil people that will push out the other evil people and then they'll be pushed out and they'll be pushed out and they'll be pushed out until nations have gotten rulers that just burn cities down for fun and then commit suicide themselves.
[37:32.600 --> 37:39.600]  Because that's the final thing that Nero did because he was so crazy on such a power trip.
[37:39.600 --> 37:46.600]  That he burned down part of the city, that wasn't enough to build his palace, then he killed himself.
[37:46.600 --> 37:49.600]  And Caligula and all the rest of it.
[37:49.600 --> 37:59.600]  So this is organized corporate governance war against the middle class, against the poor, against the people, against humanity.
[37:59.600 --> 38:05.600]  This is an organized depopulation war because the globalists are saying we're overpopulated like deer in the city.
[38:05.600 --> 38:16.600]  They're just overpopulated, overpopulated, there's no predators. So they're naturally going to create artificial cataclysms with viruses and conflicts and starvation that get rid of us.
[38:16.600 --> 38:22.600]  And you can even argue that in the survival of the fittest mode that that has a place.
[38:22.600 --> 38:29.600]  But you see the people running this are pedophiles and Satanists and are the worst, greediest people out there.
[38:29.600 --> 38:36.600]  They're the ones that according to their rules should die.
[38:36.600 --> 38:44.600]  I've got a stack of news I'm going to get to next hour. The Jeffrey Epstein case is why people believe in pizza cake from the week major mainstream news.
[38:44.600 --> 38:51.600]  No, pizza gate was to cover up Jeffrey Epstein and the Clintons and the real pedophilia and it was a setup.
[38:51.600 --> 38:53.600]  And I'll explain that coming up.
[38:53.600 --> 39:00.600]  But there's major Gisling Maxwell news on all those fronts we're going to be getting to today. That's another one of my stacks.
[39:00.600 --> 39:06.600]  And I will cover every one of these stacks, but I'm just getting these basic facts out.
[39:06.600 --> 39:10.600]  And then what's the other big point?
[39:10.600 --> 39:18.600]  I'm not stupid and you're not stupid and Rand Paul's not stupid and Ted Cruz is stupid and Josh Holly's not stupid and the rest of them aren't stupid.
[39:18.600 --> 39:23.600]  They know all this. They know it's a corporate global takeover and most of them have said as much here and there.
[39:23.600 --> 39:37.600]  So why aren't they organizing us against the global government against the corporate takeover against the great reset and quoting Klaus Schwab and David Rockefeller and Ted Turner and Bill Gates?
[39:37.600 --> 39:41.600]  Why aren't they showing in their own documents how they admitted that was always the plan?
[39:41.600 --> 39:43.600]  I mean Paul is going after Fauci for getting a function.
[39:43.600 --> 39:49.600]  But see, we don't control the Justice Department. It's controlled by the globalist. So it doesn't matter that Fauci cooked it and made it and did it and released it.
[39:49.600 --> 39:51.600]  And the documents all came out.
[39:51.600 --> 39:57.600]  Hell, Peter Dazik two years ago bragged about how they released it before all this even came out to cover their ass.
[39:57.600 --> 39:59.600]  A chimeric virus.
[39:59.600 --> 40:16.600]  So what hope do we have if the people running the FBI and the Pentagon are on board with the globalist and are on board with this depopulation, even though it's going to destroy most of their agents and most of the military.
[40:16.600 --> 40:28.600]  Well, the agents need to wake up and the military needs to wake up and we need to wake up and the Senate needs to wake up and address the attack, address the new form of war, address the globalist great reset depopulation operation
[40:28.600 --> 40:35.600]  that they admit. I've got stacks of their own admissions here and videos. I can do the whole show. I'll do a lot of, I'll do a segment on it.
[40:35.600 --> 40:40.600]  On world government and how they did the lockdowns to prepare you for carbon lockdowns.
[40:40.600 --> 40:45.600]  And how you're going to live in a 200 square foot apartment. Now you're going to have half the calories and they've got all their excuses.
[40:45.600 --> 40:52.600]  Oh, you're too fat. But this is the ultimate tyranny that wants to actually get us in a position to kill us.
[40:52.600 --> 40:56.600]  So we must address what we're under attack by. We must address we're in a war.
[40:56.600 --> 41:00.600]  All right, we're going to go to break. Come back. I'll start drilling into it.
[41:00.600 --> 41:07.600]  Before I go any further, I'm really excited about this. I told you that we're going to have a lot of new products coming out.
[41:07.600 --> 41:14.600]  And I have done a lot with the crew to make sure we have these products in the process of selling my house.
[41:14.600 --> 41:24.600]  So I can make sure to get even more products in the supply chain problems order even more so we get it so we can actually then up our funding and launch a bunch of very exciting new projects.
[41:24.600 --> 41:30.600]  You've seen all the other stuff we've done. You see where public enemy number one of the new order, how we are the King Daddy black sheep.
[41:30.600 --> 41:36.600]  You are part of this community. You are the black sheep as well. Well, it's good to be a black sheep in a world of Satanist.
[41:36.600 --> 41:41.600]  It's good to be their enemy as Christ said, you'll be persecuted if you actually follow me.
[41:41.600 --> 41:49.600]  So I have worked for over a year plus with top formulators to come up with this. We could have come up with some crap really quick.

[43:53.600 --> 44:05.600]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[44:05.600 --> 44:16.600]  But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization. Great reset.
[44:16.600 --> 44:25.600]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[44:25.600 --> 44:37.600]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda. We've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food. We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[44:37.600 --> 44:54.600]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now. Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[44:54.600 --> 45:10.600]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class, not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere. Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[45:10.600 --> 45:28.600]  And that's done by design. The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg Group, the Toronto Rural Commission, the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[45:28.600 --> 45:43.600]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg Group didn't exist. Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public in its former head, shown the steering committee, is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[45:43.600 --> 45:54.600]  And if, as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the fact that they are a worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot. We do expose them. We can beat them easily.
[45:54.600 --> 46:17.600]  Let's go back in time, say, to the mid-1990s. And then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020, where a world government's being established, where members of Congress and former presidents are censured by big tech, and where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood plots and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane.
[46:17.600 --> 46:29.600]  Think about that, because that's where we are. Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell us just five years ago, if somebody told you this would be happening. But it is happening now.
[46:29.600 --> 46:43.600]  And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't really work, so you got to take it every few months. And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[46:43.600 --> 46:53.600]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus. And that's in mainline studies. Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[47:13.600 --> 47:40.600]  And we are back on this September 7th broadcast of the Alex Jones show. I want to be infinity clear. I am not excited to be proven right.
[47:40.600 --> 47:53.600]  In fact, I've gotten really close to God, and I've gotten right with God. And it's only because the times have gotten so bad, I've never been closer to Jesus. And I really would tell you, you need to get close to God yourselves.
[47:53.600 --> 48:02.600]  I'm not lecturing you. I'm not some goody-two shoes up here on some high horse. I'm not one of these fake preachers that's designed to turn you off from God. This is good versus evil.
[48:02.600 --> 48:13.600]  The Satanist, the main Satan group, it's got millions of supporters in the U.S. I've researched them. They've had a hit movie, Hell Satan.
[48:13.600 --> 48:25.600]  I've watched the Democrats basically adopt Satanism as their operating system. They're Jacobins 2.0, French Revolution 2.0. They came out and said, we sacrifice babies when we kill children.
[48:25.600 --> 48:42.600]  Well, I've been protesting at abortion clinics for 30 years. I've been doing it since I was 17. And I'm not Catholic, but I used to mainly go out and protest with the conservative Catholic groups here in Austin, and there's videos of it.
[48:42.600 --> 49:01.600]  And I've been doing it for four or five years before I even got on air when I was like 21. And the reason I don't say that to go, oh, I'm this wonderful person. Oh, I'm so good. I'm saying I would go to abortion clinics in South Austin and East Austin.
[49:01.600 --> 49:12.600]  Well, a lot of you have seen the videos, and people come up and say, I've aborted 25 babies for Satan, and I'm going to kill you, and I love Satan. And these people aren't just saying this. They've got pentagrams all over them.
[49:12.600 --> 49:21.600]  They are into evil. They are into darkness. And most of them end up committing suicide. I mean, they're just horrible demons.
[49:21.600 --> 49:33.600]  So to abortion clinic, literal Satanists show up and pile out of $100,000 Mercedes. They pile out of $70,000 jackwars.
[49:33.600 --> 49:43.600]  They walk up with a pile of $100 bills and say, beat up Alex Jones, and I'll give you this and then some weird super white skin zombie kid comes over and starts trying to attack us.
[49:43.600 --> 49:51.600]  And before I could kick his ass, because he started to hit me, and Jackson grabbed and threw him down the ground when he worked here. Great guy.
[49:51.600 --> 49:58.600]  Jacarie left because he found a girlfriend on a trip in South Carolina and wanted to move to be with her. People thought I like fired Jacarie.
[49:58.600 --> 50:04.600]  No, Jacarie did not want to lose his job. He also wanted to move to South Carolina. I should just let him be a reporter there.
[50:04.600 --> 50:12.600]  But anyway, side issue, he was a great guy. And that was just one of the abortion clinic protests like six, seven years ago, eight years ago.
[50:12.600 --> 50:17.600]  So when I used to get up and say they're Satanists, they say killing babies is their sacrament.
[50:17.600 --> 50:28.600]  I didn't read that in a book. I went and saw it. And then I saw news articles over the years where they would get busted because the nurses would freak you out when they were like having sex with the babies.
[50:28.600 --> 50:36.600]  Sometimes they were alive or dead. You've seen the videos of them like having the babies, having boxing matches, eight month old babies.
[50:36.600 --> 50:45.600]  I mean, when I go on air and say they have sex with the live babies and sex with the dead babies and they keep babies alive and sold their organs, it all comes out on the news later.
[50:45.600 --> 50:56.600]  It's because it was in lawsuits that came out and confirmed. But what did the San Francisco courts do to the group that exposed that all over the country, including San Francisco?
[50:56.600 --> 51:09.600]  They gave a massive, what was it, a $20 million judgment or something? It's rigged. You go to a bar and have a woman talk about how she's buying a Ferrari with the money from live babies and you get a $20 million judgment against you.
[51:09.600 --> 51:15.600]  That's okay. They're going to stage all that stuff and do it to us and try to shut us down. It's not going to happen.
[51:15.600 --> 51:25.600]  That's what the cost of this is if they might kill me. That's okay. I don't want to die. But listen, somebody's got to stand up for these kids, okay?
[51:25.600 --> 51:35.600]  And it's not because I'm some damn hero. God is real. This is a test. You better well stand up or I'll tell you what God's going to do to you.
[51:35.600 --> 51:42.600]  Hell is the absence of God. God is going to put you into the Phantom Zone with these people because you're eternal.
[51:42.600 --> 51:57.600]  God is going to dump you into a pit with these people and believe me, these are dishonest, dishonorable people that are into betrayal and manipulation because they're weak and they're seeking power from the God of this world.
[51:57.600 --> 52:07.600]  They sold out for their 15 minutes of power and even the 15 minutes of power stinks and has nothing in it.
[52:07.600 --> 52:18.600]  I've been around the real Satanists, folks, not these garden variety pop Satanists. I've seen it. I'm going to leave it at that. I'm doing illegal, but I've been on the edge of it.
[52:18.600 --> 52:36.600]  I've been there with the rich people, the billionaires, because Satan is interdimensional, doesn't have long-term omnipresence, but does have the capacity like an AI computer to direct the lines of the future
[52:36.600 --> 52:42.600]  and see what's going to happen. Why do you think they tried to recruit me over and over again no matter where I went or what I did when I was young?
[52:42.600 --> 52:53.600]  Because they could tell I was going to end up going with God and thank God I did, but not before I felt the energy these people are killing kids and stuff trying to get.
[52:53.600 --> 53:01.600]  And it is just a rich, rich people of power. It's all it is, nothing. It's crap.
[53:01.600 --> 53:08.600]  I've experienced the Satanic energy these people are looking for that they get when they kill a baby for just maybe a minute.
[53:08.600 --> 53:14.600]  And then they got to have sex with it to do something blasphemous to piss God off and move themselves further from God.
[53:14.600 --> 53:22.600]  Satan's always trying to get his pawns to do bad things to cut God off from them. And then once they're cut off, then they become like zombies.
[53:22.600 --> 53:32.600]  I played so many clips of abortionist, Asian, white, and black. There's videos of these coming out of abortion clinics. People go, hey, God loves you. Please care about the babies.
[53:32.600 --> 53:36.600]  They say, I don't like the babies. I'm going to kill the babies.
[53:36.600 --> 53:41.600]  I mean, you have, I've been at the Capitol. Yeah, there's one of the videos right there. Cue it up with audio in a minute.
[53:41.600 --> 53:46.600]  I have been at the Capitol on a separate issue and I said, what's this? It's a pro-life thing.
[53:46.600 --> 53:53.600]  And it was all these women praying and it was all these Democrat women that were in the Capitol came out of the Democrats offices in suits.
[53:53.600 --> 53:57.600]  Like shirt look like look like nice ladies live next door that would bake cookies.
[53:57.600 --> 54:04.600]  So there's these women praying to get an anti-abortion law pro-life law passed. And I was just happy to be there one time.
[54:04.600 --> 54:11.600]  It's been caught on video before. All around the country and all of a sudden I go, what's that?
[54:11.600 --> 54:17.600]  And I walk into the hallway and the women are going like this. Guys, show me.
[54:17.600 --> 54:20.600]  There's actual video of this and Owen's seen it too.
[54:20.600 --> 54:25.600]  A few weeks ago he got footage of stuff like this and there's hours of it and there's videos that are famously and the women are going.
[54:25.600 --> 54:34.600]  I mean, folks, this is not a joke. Okay.
[54:34.600 --> 54:37.600]  You can call it mass psychosis. You can call it whatever you want.
[54:37.600 --> 54:42.600]  I have seen this probably 50 times.
[54:42.600 --> 54:52.600]  Now, the rich Satanists that I got ran into because you know, they lure me with, you know, their hot daughters or whatever when I was young.
[54:52.600 --> 54:57.600]  They were not like that. They were not possessed. They were all in control of it.
[54:57.600 --> 55:00.600]  Oh, yes. And all the rest of it.
[55:00.600 --> 55:03.600]  So when you look at the British Role family, those are devil worshipers.
[55:03.600 --> 55:08.600]  Those are blood drinking people and it's come out. They get blood infusions of children, but it's beyond that.
[55:08.600 --> 55:19.600]  It's all about them, their selfishness, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, all of their selfishness to take a one year old baby and to torture it.
[55:19.600 --> 55:24.600]  Their favorite to three year old is old enough to know what's going on and be really horrified.
[55:24.600 --> 55:35.600]  And so you need to come to grips, folks, that you're not worried about the being put in a ghetto or executed or guillotine because that's what it's going to come down to.
[55:35.600 --> 55:41.600]  They're coming for us. You need to worry about your soul and you need to stand against them.
[55:41.600 --> 55:46.600]  Go ahead and they found one of the clips of one of the abortion doctors talking like a demon. Here it is.
[55:46.600 --> 55:54.600]  Friends, sir, you got to repent, sir. You got to repent, sir, for murdering babies.
[55:54.600 --> 55:55.600]  Why?
[55:55.600 --> 55:57.600]  Because it's a sin before God.
[55:57.600 --> 55:58.600]  Why?
[55:58.600 --> 55:59.600]  Stinky breath.
[55:59.600 --> 56:01.600]  Yeah, it's pretty evil of you, sir.
[56:01.600 --> 56:02.600]  Yeah, I am.
[56:02.600 --> 56:05.600]  And I hope and pray that you...
[56:05.600 --> 56:07.600]  Well, that's what you do to babies, huh?
[56:07.600 --> 56:08.600]  Yeah, I love it.
[56:08.600 --> 56:09.600]  You love it, huh?
[56:09.600 --> 56:10.600]  Yeah, I do.
[56:10.600 --> 56:12.600]  Okay, I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[56:12.600 --> 56:13.600]  Oh, I'd never go to Christ.
[56:13.600 --> 56:14.600]  I hope that you come to Christ.
[56:14.600 --> 56:15.600]  No, I don't go to Christ.
[56:15.600 --> 56:16.600]  Yeah, you...
[56:16.600 --> 56:17.600]  I don't listen to Christ.
[56:17.600 --> 56:18.600]  You will have a darkened heart, sir.
[56:18.600 --> 56:19.600]  I do have a darkened heart.
[56:19.600 --> 56:20.600]  Yeah.
[56:20.600 --> 56:21.600]  You have a darkened heart.
[56:21.600 --> 56:22.600]  I do. I do very, very much so.
[56:22.600 --> 56:24.600]  And you will stand before God in judgment day?
[56:24.600 --> 56:25.600]  Yes, I will. Every day.
[56:25.600 --> 56:27.600]  You will stand before God in judgment day?
[56:27.600 --> 56:28.600]  Yes, I will. Every day.
[56:28.600 --> 56:29.600]  All of the babies in that field?
[56:29.600 --> 56:30.600]  I love it. I love it.
[56:30.600 --> 56:32.600]  Yeah, keep tearing the babies apart.
[56:32.600 --> 56:33.600]  Yeah, I will.
[56:33.600 --> 56:34.600]  Keep tearing the babies apart.
[56:34.600 --> 56:35.600]  I will.
[56:35.600 --> 56:37.600]  Keep tearing the babies apart.
[56:37.600 --> 56:38.600]  Oh, yeah.
[56:38.600 --> 56:41.600]  Yes, sir. The babies, their blood screams from the ground.
[56:41.600 --> 56:44.600]  Now, that's not even one of the worst ones. That's one from like two years ago.
[56:44.600 --> 56:46.600]  I've seen that over and over again.
[56:46.600 --> 56:47.600]  Well, far worse than that.
[56:47.600 --> 56:48.600]  We ought to try to find those.
[56:48.600 --> 56:51.600]  I ought to call up some of those anti-abortion groups I know in town.
[56:51.600 --> 56:54.600]  They've got like tapes, you wouldn't believe them, just hours of it.
[56:54.600 --> 56:55.600]  It's the most...
[56:55.600 --> 56:57.600]  And it's got video of the police and LA and stuff.
[56:57.600 --> 57:00.600]  People peacefully protesting outside abortion clinics.
[57:00.600 --> 57:05.600]  They put num chucks around their arms with handcuffs and break their arms.
[57:05.600 --> 57:07.600]  Break their arms.
[57:07.600 --> 57:08.600]  God help us.
[57:08.600 --> 57:10.600]  Okay, I haven't gotten to the news yet.
[57:10.600 --> 57:12.600]  You know, I'm going to try.
[57:12.600 --> 57:13.600]  I don't even know if I can do this.
[57:13.600 --> 57:15.600]  I mean, seriously, I...
[57:15.600 --> 57:17.600]  No, I'm going to expose it all.
[57:17.600 --> 57:19.600]  I'm going to talk about it all, God.
[57:19.600 --> 57:22.600]  It's just every damn evil you can imagine is on this table,
[57:22.600 --> 57:24.600]  and it's just out in the open now.
[57:24.600 --> 57:27.600]  It's just Satan making his move against everybody,
[57:27.600 --> 57:29.600]  and all we've got to do is say no and reject it
[57:29.600 --> 57:32.600]  and not submit to it and ask God to protect us.
[57:32.600 --> 57:34.600]  But you've got to stand up first, or God's not going to help you.
[57:34.600 --> 57:36.600]  God hates cowards.
[57:37.600 --> 57:41.600]  Just a week ago, we got a new shipment of vitamin and minerals.
[57:41.600 --> 57:45.600]  So we got a new shipment of vitamin and mineral fusion back in stock,

[58:32.600 --> 58:34.600]  It's just called hair and beard.
[58:34.600 --> 58:36.600]  So get that as well for your immune system.
[58:36.600 --> 58:38.600]  It's great for women, great for children,
[58:38.600 --> 58:41.600]  and it's designed for men in infowarstore.com.
[59:08.600 --> 59:10.600]  Well, everybody they know about the show
[59:10.600 --> 59:13.600]  is people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[59:13.600 --> 59:15.600]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[59:15.600 --> 59:17.600]  and trying to stop their agenda,
[59:17.600 --> 59:19.600]  and we've also got to get personally prepared.
[59:19.600 --> 59:21.600]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality,
[59:21.600 --> 59:23.600]  storeable food.
[59:23.600 --> 59:25.600]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices

[59:44.600 --> 59:47.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:05.600]  Alright, I will be a good boy
[1:00:05.600 --> 1:00:08.600]  to cover the incredible intercept lawsuit
[1:00:08.600 --> 1:00:10.600]  that got the Fauci documents where he said
[1:00:10.600 --> 1:00:12.600]  make the Kamirobio weapon.
[1:00:12.600 --> 1:00:15.600]  It should be immediately arrested and charged with war crimes.
[1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:17.600]  That's coming up next segment. I'll go over all the documents.
[1:00:17.600 --> 1:00:19.600]  I have been so busy not complaining.
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:22.600]  It's just true that I have not cut a new ad
[1:00:22.600 --> 1:00:25.600]  even though this product has been in for a week.
[1:00:25.600 --> 1:00:27.600]  And we were supposed to launch it last week,
[1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:29.600]  but I've been so busy covering the news I didn't do it.
[1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:31.600]  So during the snowman's land,
[1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:33.600]  some stations don't carry this first little five minutes,
[1:00:33.600 --> 1:00:35.600]  but some do.
[1:00:35.600 --> 1:00:37.600]  I'm going to do a plug in an ad that we can run
[1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:39.600]  during the network breaks
[1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:41.600]  so that I can fund a operation
[1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:44.600]  and so you can get a great product
[1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:46.600]  at the same time.
[1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:48.600]  So ladies and gentlemen,
[1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:50.600]  let me go ahead and get the product
[1:00:50.600 --> 1:00:53.600]  and do the plug for you right now.
[1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:56.600]  Several years ago,
[1:00:56.600 --> 1:00:59.600]  I was talking to a lot of the top developers out there
[1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:02.600]  with high-end supplements and
[1:01:02.600 --> 1:01:05.600]  sports enhancers that are basically safe
[1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:07.600]  and good and that people really, really like
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:09.600]  and that are also at the same time well researched,
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:12.600]  but still cutting edge because a lot of this stuff is coming out.
[1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:15.600]  In the last year and a half or so, we finally got it done
[1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:18.600]  and it's Brainforce Ultra.
[1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:20.600]  We're going to have Brainforce Plus back soon.
[1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:22.600]  It's been sold out,
[1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:24.600]  but Brainforce Ultra is roughly
[1:01:24.600 --> 1:01:29.600]  twice as strong as Brainforce Plus
[1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:33.600]  and there is roughly
[1:01:33.600 --> 1:01:36.600]  twice as much ingredient as well.
[1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:38.600]  So it's not just twice as strong.
[1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:40.600]  There's twice as much of the ingredients
[1:01:40.600 --> 1:01:42.600]  and the ingredients are twice as strong.
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:46.600]  So I guess that's four times what the other is.
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:49.600]  It's discounted out of the gates for $24.95.
[1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:51.600]  A lot of money goes into this.
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:53.600]  This is a high-end product
[1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:55.600]  now available for the first time
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:57.600]  at infowarstore.com today.
[1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:00.600]  And there are, again, no ratings on it yet
[1:02:00.600 --> 1:02:02.600]  because it just launched today,
[1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:05.600]  but I'm sure it's going to be a five-star rating.
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:07.600]  I'd say 98% reviews.
[1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:10.600]  This is just as good as our other top products are better.
[1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:12.600]  Supercharge your state of mind,
[1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:15.600]  get the powerful new Brainforce Ultra
[1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:17.600]  now live at infowarstore.com
[1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:19.600]  and listen to this.
[1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:23.600]  It's got, how do you say it?
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:25.600]  How do you say it?
[1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:27.600]  You're probably wondering.
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:30.600]  It's obviously based onaudience earrape.
[1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:33.600]  How do you yearly produce that seed,
[1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:35.600]  which everybody says is the best super
[1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:37.600]  thing everybody loves?
[1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:39.600]  Gorana seed loaded with energy compounds
[1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:41.600]  and antioxidants,
[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:43.600]  Gorana seed is native to the Amazon
[1:02:43.600 --> 1:02:45.600]  and has been used by Amazonian tribes
[1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:47.600]  for centuries.
[1:02:47.600 --> 1:02:48.840]  Alpha GPC,
[1:02:48.840 --> 1:02:50.600]  a natural compound found in the brain
[1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:51.600]  that delivers
[1:02:52.600 --> 1:02:54.600]  chl manifests and
[1:02:54.600 --> 1:03:00.920]  seeds of the coffee fruit, green coffee bean packs a powerful natural punch and are high
[1:03:00.920 --> 1:03:07.320]  in chlorogenic acid. Again, this is just all the top stuff that the literal scientists
[1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:16.480]  have put in here. Elotha root, a celebrated member of the ginseng family. It has been used
[1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:20.640]  for thousands of years in traditional systems. Yerba mate leaves, don't need to explain to
[1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:26.120]  you what that does. Containing natural amounts of caffeine, Yerba mate is also loaded with
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:34.440]  poly, let me say that phenosus, like quercetin, oh wow quercetin, that's really good for your
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:40.520]  immune system, as well as potassium, magnesium and manganese. Green tea leaves are natural
[1:03:40.520 --> 1:03:49.720]  rich in polyphenols like EGCG, as well as L-theanine, only the highest quality green
[1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:57.080]  tea leaves are included in this formula. Ginko leaf, known for its exceptional antioxidant
[1:03:57.080 --> 1:04:01.680]  content, Ginko comes from the ancient group of plants and have been the focus of both
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:09.520]  ancient and modern fascination. An ashwagandha root, an ancient herb used for 3,000 years,
[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:17.320]  botanical name, is flavored for its many, is favored for its many beneficial properties.
[1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:23.240]  Get yourself in the M4, get Rainforce Ultra now for an exclusive launch prize before it's
[1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:28.400]  gone. Flip the switch and supercharge. And folks, I'll just be honest with you, I'll
[1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:32.440]  have to recut this ad later while I'm on there. I'm so exhausted from reading all this and
[1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:36.160]  I'm so freaked out that I almost took off today and I'm not complaining. I know this
[1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:43.960]  is hard for you guys to take too, but I just, I'll have to cut this ad later. I may have
[1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:47.960]  to take off again next week. I got to just get straight on all this, man. This is just
[1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:51.400]  so horrible. I mean, my God, they just announced all the vaccinations.
[1:04:51.400 --> 1:04:58.360]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class, not
[1:04:58.360 --> 1:05:04.760]  in Communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere. Is there a real
[1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:10.640]  study of the planet's ruling class? And that's done by design. The large central banks that
[1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:16.560]  basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into, say,
[1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:20.760]  the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the trilateral commission,
[1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:25.640]  the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers. Until ten
[1:05:25.640 --> 1:05:30.520]  years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't exist.
[1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:34.880]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public and its former head, the show on the steering
[1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:41.000]  committee, is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government. And
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:45.200]  as a Liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the second
[1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:49.320]  thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover. We don't have a shot. We do expose
[1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:50.320]  them. We can beat them easily.
[1:05:50.320 --> 1:06:04.200]  You thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer
[1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:06.200]  to the violence of the sun.
[1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:11.200]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:11.200 --> 1:06:20.200]  And the colors of the sea, find your eyes with trembling mammoths, and you touch the
[1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:28.200]  distant beaches with tales of regularities. How his naked ears were tortured by the siren
[1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:35.200]  deeply singing, for the sparkling waves are calling you to kiss the white ladies.
[1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:51.760]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen, on this live Tuesday, September 7th, Worldwide
[1:06:51.760 --> 1:06:59.000]  Broadcast. And let me go ahead and just plunge into the news for the rest of this hour. I
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:07.120]  have a very special guest that's going to be joining us coming up in the fourth hour.
[1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:14.840]  Stella Emanuel M.D. from Houston will be joining us. She's been a very brave doctor that's
[1:07:14.840 --> 1:07:19.640]  been absolutely demonized and attacked. We're pointing out that this whole COVID system is
[1:07:19.640 --> 1:07:26.720]  a spiritual genetic takeover, a mark of the beast. Oh, how dare her. Well, that is exactly
[1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:27.720]  what it is.
[1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:36.080]  But let's get into today's top story. And that's saying a lot for this to be today's
[1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:44.480]  top story. You have Australia announcing that the unvaccinated will be locked down. Two
[1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:49.600]  days ago, they said you won't be able to participate in the economy or in culture. Now they said
[1:07:49.600 --> 1:07:56.240]  you will not be able to leave lockdown. In fact, you'll be put in a quarantine center
[1:07:56.240 --> 1:08:00.960]  until you change your behavior. And they're saying they're going to put non-sick people
[1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:08.400]  in centers starting with children to make sure they're quote safe. And I'm going to
[1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:24.560]  hit that next segment. The holy grail of this control system is the state getting the children.
[1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:30.240]  And I had that directly from the United Nations. So they believe that once they get the children,
[1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:34.960]  as all authoritarian regimes do from Hitler to Stalin to Mao, they will finally have full
[1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:41.360]  control of the civilization and then can carry out the orderly depopulation. First, they
[1:08:41.360 --> 1:08:45.880]  had to break up the families and they had to turn the women against the men and so on.
[1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:50.320]  Turn men into lazy people. It's all it's all been signed and we carried out. It's all admitted
[1:08:50.320 --> 1:08:55.400]  to be scientific and it's carrying us into slavery and death. Why wouldn't we organize
[1:08:55.400 --> 1:08:59.680]  against it and say no? Oh, because they spent decades telling you globalism and the break
[1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:05.200]  up the family and the new world order and carbon taxes and using vaccines to take control
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:09.040]  of people and sterilize them. That's never coming, even though it's in all their documents.
[1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:15.120]  Well, now it's here. So will you decide to say no? Or will you let yourself get deeper
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:23.480]  into the control system? These monsters that these lesser men are building over this because
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:32.920]  they crave power and control. So let's get into it. F O I A Freedom of Information Act
[1:09:32.920 --> 1:09:39.520]  confirms Fauci funded construction of Chimeric coronaviruses. That was the headline from
[1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:45.800]  American Journal today. But here's what the intercept is reporting. They sued and got
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:53.460]  the documents. New details emerge about coronavirus research at Chinese lab. Newly released documents
[1:09:53.460 --> 1:09:58.240]  provide detail. And guys, can we go to the story and click on those and show the documents?
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:05.140]  Thanks. Newly released documents provide detail of US funded research on several types of
[1:10:05.140 --> 1:10:10.200]  coronaviruses in the Wuhan lab of arology in China. The intercept was obtained more
[1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:16.680]  than 900 pages of documents telling the work of Eco Health Alliance. That's Peter Dazek
[1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:21.880]  working directly for Bill Gates and Fauci, a US based organization that use federal money
[1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:27.400]  to fund bat coronavirus research at the Chinese laboratory, as well as Gates money. The tribe
[1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:32.400]  of documents includes two previously unpublished grant proposals that were funded by the National
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:36.720]  Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and will well as a project update related
[1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:42.960]  to Eco Health Alliance research, which has been scrutinized amid increased interest in
[1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:48.000]  the origins of the pandemic. The documents were released in connection with the ongoing
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:52.040]  Freedom of Information Act litigation by the Intercept in the National Institutes of Help.
[1:10:52.040 --> 1:11:04.240]  The Intercept is making the full documents available to the public. Now, again, let me
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:11.240]  show you some of those documents right now, some of the screenshots right here. FOIA release,
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:23.280]  Fauci funded coronavirus of, quote, Chimeric coronaviruses in Wuhan. Now, thanks to material
[1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:27.960]  here and here, we can go to the zero hedge article and click the document, please. Released
[1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:33.480]  through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the Intercept against the National Institutes
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:40.240]  of Health, which were unredacted enough to toss Fauci under the bus, we now know that
[1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:45.840]  Fauci funded Eco Health Alliance, a New York based nonprofit headed by Peter Dazik, was
[1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:51.320]  absolutely engaged in gain of function research to make Chimeric SARS based coronaviruses,
[1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:56.120]  which they confirmed could infect humans. They did it. They created the ultimate gain
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:07.280]  of function. And there are the documents on your screen. Let's read some of them. This
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:13.080]  award does not include funds to support research subject to the Department of Health and Human
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:21.000]  Services framework for guiding funding decisions about proposed research involving enhanced
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:30.760]  potential pandemic pathogens. Therefore, for aim one, identify, characterize and rank spillover
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:39.640]  risk of high zoological potential vaccines from wildlife, the building of Chimeric SARS
[1:12:39.640 --> 1:12:50.040]  like the coronaviruses and be based on SCCO 114 or the Pagdolian coronavirus molecular
[1:12:50.040 --> 1:13:00.400]  clones and the building of Chimeric Mears-COVID-V will be based on the HK US Strain. That's
[1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:09.920]  from North Carolina, Chapel Hill. This is continuing for page 293. That was for page
[1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:20.840]  five. Using our reverse genetic system, we constructed Chimeric viruses and re-delivered
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:27.600]  full length recombinant SARS-COVID-V from the silco sequence. All three SARS-COVID-V
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:35.400]  full length isolates and two Chimeric viruses replicated efficiently in vitro, that's in
[1:13:35.400 --> 1:13:48.720]  test tubes, E6 cells and the Hella cells expressing HACE2, Sivert and BATC ACE2. This
[1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:56.560]  is the emerging five viruses, but not in those without the ACE2, 246196. We use the
[1:13:56.560 --> 1:14:04.560]  SARS-COVID-reverse genetics system, 72 to generate Chimeric virus with a mouse-adapted
[1:14:04.560 --> 1:14:11.440]  SARS-COVID backbone that's going to affect humans expressing SHCO14S protein and the
[1:14:11.440 --> 1:14:20.240]  10 sequence divergence from SARS-COVID-S. This is their document confirming what the
[1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:25.480]  Australians and the Indians and the French said in February of last year that it was
[1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:33.440]  five viruses merged. And here it is. And here's Peter Dazik with Fauci. And here he is with
[1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:40.440]  the Batley. Hell, I got him on video saying in December 2019 to cover his ass. And it
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:46.360]  just, yeah, there it is on screen. So there you go, folks. And we have the emails already
[1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:51.200]  from Fauci to him. Because people always report on these as one-offs. If you take the emails
[1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:59.720]  that came out in, what, January of this year, it's Fauci in December of the year before,
[1:14:59.720 --> 1:15:04.520]  before this is even in the news, saying, all right, prepare the vaccines for our programs
[1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:10.360]  on the SARS-COVID viruses we created. He says, prepare the vaccines. They already had the
[1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:16.920]  vaccines, and then they hand them over with what they want designed by Merck, by Moderna,
[1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:19.920]  and by all the others. Because if they gave it to them way before, they go, hey, what's
[1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:23.800]  this? But instead, they do it in December. They go, oh, we've got a leak. It got out.
[1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:29.080]  Oh, here it is making for us. So you look real good when it comes out. At least. And of course,
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:35.160]  then Fauci and Gates own in Moderna and Pfizer, big, big stakes in it. I mean, this is so
[1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:39.960]  damn criminal. This is so open and shut. You put me in front of a grand jury for one day.
[1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:51.480]  They'll indict both their asses for mass murder. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:57.600]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes
[1:15:57.600 --> 1:16:02.560]  the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry. And
[1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:07.520]  now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[1:16:45.760 --> 1:17:04.720]  Have you ever thought about turning your Glock, XD family or 1911 handgun into a semi-automatic
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:19.600]  to your doorstep with no FFL or background check required? What if you could cut your
[1:17:19.600 --> 1:17:35.040]  heating bills this winter with your existing wood burning fireplace and not spend thousands
[1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:49.320]  of dollars on them?
[1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:55.060]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminated water, soil and subsurface material
[1:17:55.060 --> 1:17:59.480]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:04.440]  and degrade targeted pollutants. For the first time, the bio pros are bringing to the public
[1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:08.520]  market, a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[1:18:08.520 --> 1:18:13.600]  Their first product they are launching is called Bioseptic Pro, a product specifically designed
[1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:16.200]  to establish a healthy septic system.
[1:18:16.200 --> 1:18:20.520]  Bioseptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[1:18:20.520 --> 1:18:22.440]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:27.520]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective
[1:18:27.520 --> 1:18:32.280]  than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[1:18:32.280 --> 1:18:36.360]  Biopro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:40.720]  Visit TheBiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:42.680]  That's TheBiopros.com.

[1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:56.120]  In late August, infowars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:19:02.320]  the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:04.800]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:08.720]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:09.720]  have.
[1:19:09.720 --> 1:19:12.560]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water
[1:19:12.560 --> 1:19:16.440]  filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:19.920]  But now, more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.

[1:19:33.280 --> 1:19:34.600]  already taking place.
[1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:40.920]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the Infowar at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:19:40.920 --> 1:19:44.760]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[1:19:44.760 --> 1:19:45.760]  control.
[1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:52.280]  So get prepared now at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:19:52.280 --> 1:20:02.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:02.280 --> 1:20:24.500]  Next segment, I'm going to cover it.
[1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:29.080]  Is it good people are seeing F. Biden at football games across the U.S.?
[1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:32.480]  Is it good that people are saying, you know, arrest Merkel?
[1:20:32.480 --> 1:20:34.360]  Is it good they're saying arrest Boris Johnson?
[1:20:34.360 --> 1:20:40.520]  Is it good they're saying arrest Trudeau and throwing rocks at him and running him off
[1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:41.520]  everywhere?
[1:20:41.520 --> 1:20:42.520]  Yes.
[1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:45.800]  Yeah, I mean, it's good, but I don't want any violence against them because I could
[1:20:45.800 --> 1:20:47.280]  turn them into martyrs.
[1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:53.200]  Their globalist puppets and Klaus Schwab has said they want to create anger at the nation
[1:20:53.200 --> 1:21:01.360]  state and have the public overthrow and burn our cities and then bring in a new world order.
[1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:04.080]  They're running our leaders as puppets.
[1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:08.080]  So your anger needs to be at Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and the U.N.
[1:21:08.080 --> 1:21:10.320]  Yeah, I don't like Biden.
[1:21:10.320 --> 1:21:13.760]  I like seeing people wake up to him and hate him, but he stole the election.
[1:21:13.760 --> 1:21:16.920]  He was put in there for this purpose.
[1:21:16.920 --> 1:21:17.920]  He's a distraction.
[1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:21.360]  He's a shield for the globalist so he could solve the heat and they don't.
[1:21:21.360 --> 1:21:27.480]  I'll explain it next segment, but let's put on screen for everybody the show headline
[1:21:27.480 --> 1:21:33.080]  today and just think about what a bombshell that is.
[1:21:33.080 --> 1:21:40.600]  Global Red Alert, Freedom of Information Act docs confirm Fauci created COVID-19 chimera
[1:21:40.600 --> 1:21:46.800]  bio weapon and lied to Congress.
[1:21:46.800 --> 1:21:49.800]  This is an emergency broadcast.
[1:21:49.800 --> 1:21:56.240]  Australia has announced unvaccinated to be permanently locked down in reeducation camps.
[1:21:56.240 --> 1:22:02.400]  They actually say you're going to be locked up until you quote get some sense in you.
[1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:05.840]  And people are even mainline media is like even the Atlantic that's calling for internet
[1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:09.000]  passports and COVID passports and a world ID.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:10.760]  They're like, gosh, they're like North Korean.
[1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:14.200]  Oh, that's a little too much.
[1:22:14.200 --> 1:22:19.280]  All these fools that are bringing in authoritarianism, it gets rid of all the prosperity.
[1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:23.800]  But the globalist controllers have their own private jets, their own palatial mansions.
[1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:25.960]  Ted Turner owns something like a million acres.
[1:22:25.960 --> 1:22:27.440]  Bill Gates owns the same thing.
[1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:29.160]  They're separate from us.
[1:22:29.160 --> 1:22:30.880]  So they think they can get away with it.
[1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:35.480]  That's why we've got to not put all our energy into Kamala Harris.
[1:22:35.480 --> 1:22:38.920]  Talk about a puppet who's meant to be hated or Biden sure.
[1:22:38.920 --> 1:22:39.920]  Expose them and pitch them.
[1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:40.920]  Remove them.
[1:22:40.920 --> 1:22:41.920]  Great.
[1:22:41.920 --> 1:22:43.520]  Get rid of Nancy Pelosi, all of it.
[1:22:43.520 --> 1:22:52.480]  Don't understand the FBI directors and Boris Johnson, all these people are fronts of the
[1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:56.520]  globalist, of the big corporations that are doing all this.
[1:22:56.520 --> 1:22:58.040]  They're the ones spying on you.
[1:22:58.040 --> 1:23:00.480]  They're the ones propping up China.
[1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:02.280]  They're the ones saying you're not essential.
[1:23:02.280 --> 1:23:03.920]  They're the ones that did the lockdowns.
[1:23:03.920 --> 1:23:06.320]  They're the ones that are bringing in corporate governance.
[1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:08.440]  But look at all these stacks.
[1:23:08.440 --> 1:23:10.200]  They're all just as important.
[1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:17.840]  Just think about the documents, hundreds of pages of them with Fauci specifically signing
[1:23:17.840 --> 1:23:23.640]  them saying, I want five viruses merged in the SARS family with these animals.
[1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:28.960]  And then they tell you on the news that they think these animals all pooped on each other
[1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:32.600]  at a wet market, which means just a big market.
[1:23:32.600 --> 1:23:34.160]  They got it in Mexico too.
[1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:38.920]  They're pretty wild with cats and dogs and parrots and whatever the hell you want to
[1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:41.600]  eat, it's in there.
[1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:46.040]  And they told you, oh, this just popped up in there when the whole time they created
[1:23:46.040 --> 1:23:47.800]  it and then they released it on purpose.
[1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:48.800]  Look at the timing.
[1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:50.000]  Look at the power grab.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:51.160]  Look at the vaccines.
[1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:52.360]  Look at the global ID.
[1:23:52.360 --> 1:23:53.680]  Look at Operation Lockstep.
[1:23:53.680 --> 1:24:01.600]  That's why it's hard for me to look at that war criminal Fauci because he is such a destroyer
[1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:03.120]  of worlds.
[1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:10.000]  Now, let's get into the latest globalist fair mongering reports on info wars.com, different
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:16.120]  pandemic potential brain destroying virus with 75% death rate spreads in India.
[1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:20.360]  And it's all directly linked to the vaccinated where the Delta variant come from.
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:26.600]  They admit, oh, out of India from a vaccine mutation, a different virus classified by
[1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:27.600]  the World Health Organization.
[1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:28.600]  You can't believe it.
[1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:32.760]  And they say is having pandemic potential is spreading more than usual due to care shortages
[1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:34.040]  by COVID.
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:41.440]  The London Telegram reports that the Nipah virus, which attacks the brain and has a
[1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:47.160]  seven up to up to that's keyword, 75% fatality rate has killed a 12 year old boy.
[1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:51.600]  Well, we better lock down again and give people more shots that cause more mutations.
[1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:56.920]  US reaches 40 million recorded COVID-19 cases with 4 million content counted in the last
[1:24:56.920 --> 1:24:57.920]  four weeks.
[1:24:57.920 --> 1:24:58.920]  Yeah.
[1:24:58.920 --> 1:24:59.920]  Last year was a hoax.
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:00.920]  Last year was fair mongering.
[1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:01.920]  Last year was bull.
[1:25:01.920 --> 1:25:04.640]  Last year from India with the Delta variant.
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:05.760]  It's super infectious.
[1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:06.760]  There's no way to hide it.
[1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:08.160]  No way to get away with.
[1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:10.640]  If you haven't already had COVID before, you're going to get it.
[1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:14.720]  You better have your vitamins and your minerals and your water and your sunshine.
[1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:17.840]  And you better get early treatment, not when you go to the hospital.
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:22.680]  My security guy, head security guy had a really good friend who was in great shape.
[1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:26.720]  And she was a nurse in North Austin.
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:30.800]  And she went in and said, man, I'm having a little breather and they said, just go home.
[1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:31.800]  You'll be fine.
[1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:32.800]  They came back in an ambulance.
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:34.160]  They innovated during Kilder.
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:39.000]  Notice they're told do not give early treatment because it's 100% basically.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:44.360]  So this is life and death, ladies and gentlemen, life and death UK government already preparing
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:45.520]  for another lockdown.
[1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:49.880]  I told you, Biden must be testing leaks or something because a month ago they were saying
[1:25:49.880 --> 1:25:51.520]  we're going to do lockdowns the next few weeks.
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:54.960]  They haven't done it except in different regions of the US, but they're definitely getting
[1:25:54.960 --> 1:25:55.960]  ready for it.
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:25:56.960]  Australia never left it.
[1:25:56.960 --> 1:25:58.280]  Canada basically never left it.
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:04.400]  UK's Home Secretary launches new campaign complaining UK spies should have access to
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:05.960]  your private messages.
[1:26:05.960 --> 1:26:09.640]  Same things have been passed by executive fiat in Australia.
[1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:14.440]  So it's all the same global technology takeover.
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:17.800]  Australian authorities to quote lock out unvaccinated people being able to participate
[1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:18.800]  in the economy.
[1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:22.960]  Now we have a clip where they say you will be locked in lockdown in your home or in a
[1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:23.960]  camp.
[1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:24.960]  That's coming up.
[1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:30.560]  Every shelves barren Australia's trucker strike COVID isolation for workers reels economy.
[1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:34.560]  Yeah, it's really was already happened before the trucker strike that most of the stuff
[1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:35.800]  was off the shelves already.
[1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:39.720]  Oh, you try to order your Uber Eats, but no one's there to deliver it and there is no
[1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:45.600]  food because the production stalled that this is the this is what Mao did to bring China
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:46.600]  to its knees.
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:49.720]  He was in control for like 15 years and didn't have full control.
[1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:52.040]  So he just said, oh, everybody has to come off the farms.
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:57.640]  Everybody's got to live in communes, the star of everybody to death.

[1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:33.560]  claus schwaub well i say fight hitler i don't want to blow buildings up i don't want to
[1:34:33.560 --> 1:34:40.640]  shoot cops stuff like that i want to civilly be disobedient and know they're assaulting
[1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:46.880]  us with poison shots and to spread the information to expose them so that the majority of people
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:53.400]  understand the psychological warfare going on and the siege going on and say no now i
[1:34:53.400 --> 1:34:57.680]  already had them today put a compilation of trudobing chased off around the country together
[1:34:57.680 --> 1:35:02.920]  and then now this just broke so we'll show you some of the compilation in a moment and
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:07.920]  we'll narrate the parts that are needed for radio coming up and then we'll play as soon

[1:35:12.600 --> 1:35:18.400]  to do you notice mpr and pbs will play the cussing because technically under fcc rules
[1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:23.280]  if it's for documentary purposes like if trump says a cuss word you're allowed to play that
[1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:26.840]  because it's documenting a historical thing but again we don't want to give our stations
[1:35:26.840 --> 1:35:31.240]  trouble because leftists go and file complaints because they can cuss we can't cuss remember
[1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:37.520]  they're the boss but before i hit that ladies and gentlemen i am just so excited about this

[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:06.000]  i talked to the crew and i said i want to make something even stronger that's super
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:10.080]  clean that is the best strongest formula out there we probably should put warnings on this
[1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:14.320]  so look out what you're doing consult your physician this isn't a game there's twice

[1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:47.880]  I am I've already covered 30 or 40 news articles today and I've not even gotten into the most
[1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:52.520]  substantive stuff and we have a special guest coming up at the next hour and then I got
[1:40:52.520 --> 1:41:00.840]  Paul Watson so I'm gonna just when we come back I'm gonna get myself together because
[1:41:00.840 --> 1:41:03.800]  here's the problem each one of these stories you could talk about for four hours they're
[1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:12.640]  all that big and right now I'm kind of dumbfounded I'm kind of thunderstruck pollax is the word
[1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:17.240]  that it that Israel is announcing permanent martial law the UK basically is that Australia
[1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:22.080]  completely has and that this is all happening I mean I knew it was happening and I know
[1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:25.800]  why the general public can't deal with this because I'm getting the point I can't deal
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:33.120]  with it I mean these people are so damn evil and I'm torn maybe I should just talk about
[1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:37.440]  Fauci and open the phones up and how we now have even more documents we already had a
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:43.200]  bunch of documents and videos that he ordered them to make COVID-19 and we have the entire
[1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:48.760]  recipe of what COVID-19 became with him doing it and then he releases it and he's our God
[1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:53.160]  he's our master and then he owns a bunch of the vaccine stuff and makes money out of it
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:58.280]  and then takes over the world and he doesn't go to prison and said we all get put in prison
[1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:04.520]  and are told we're not essential this is gaslighting this is brainwashing this is ass end up this
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:12.000]  is ridiculous and Rand Paul is the only one that's got hair on his chest and it said Fauci
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:16.600]  should be criminally investigated but is Rand Paul about the great reset and how they cooked
[1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:20.320]  don't cause oh that sounds kooky you say it's run by the Davos group the damn Davos groups
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:27.280]  written four freaking books on it my God they declared war on us they've launched a bio weapon
[1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:33.520]  they're taking over and we're just sitting here and taking it but the people aren't
[1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:37.640]  taking it so I'm going to play the stuff I talked about with her dough and come back
[1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:43.760]  that's what I'm telling you it's just unbelievable but thank God humanity's fighting back I salute
[1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:50.160]  you even more than Trump Mike Lindell has been out there exposing the fact of the 2020
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:55.320]  election was stolen and his symposium was amazing 90 plus percent of the information
[1:42:55.320 --> 1:43:01.920]  was accurate and was damning and was groundbreaking a few poison pills a few pieces of this info
[1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:06.200]  were slipped in to try to discredit the whole thing folks I'm surprised the conference even
[1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:10.760]  happened they had infiltrators and others that really disrupted it and tried to shut
[1:43:10.760 --> 1:43:16.520]  it down because Mike Lindell is over the target and you're over the target when you support
[1:43:16.520 --> 1:43:21.760]  his important investigation that is every American's right to do to contest an election
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:25.040]  if you think that there was issues look what the Democrats have done over the years and
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:29.440]  he's continuing his investigations and continuing his work so it's more important than ever
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:34.240]  to support what he's doing at my pillow dot com and to support info wars at the same time

[1:44:02.640 --> 1:44:08.680]  ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset and that's why it's more important
[1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:13.440]  than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because
[1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:17.720]  people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information warfare
[1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:21.960]  the enemy and try to stop their agenda we've also got to get personally prepared and one
[1:44:21.960 --> 1:44:25.440]  of the number one things to do is high quality storeable food we've got the best food ready

[1:46:41.040 --> 1:47:02.520]  to america the republic has fallen you're listening to the alex jones show it's all
[1:47:02.520 --> 1:47:12.360]  declassified harvard yale oxford all before covid-19 was released by foul shoot by design
[1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:23.800]  twenty two months ago that they would announce lockdowns then take the lockdowns partially
[1:47:23.800 --> 1:47:27.560]  off then tighten them down more than take them partially off and tighten them more that
[1:47:27.560 --> 1:47:35.880]  is a psychological warfare tactic of trauma-based mind control that is in the textbooks and i
[1:47:35.880 --> 1:47:39.200]  talked about this amazing video yesterday that i'm gonna have reposted again today it's
[1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:46.040]  that important under my live show feed make sure they do that the video titled mass psychosis
[1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:50.640]  how an entire population becomes mentally ill and it's in the psychological warfare
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:57.320]  manuals how they create fear then calm fear then calm it's like a horror movie fear then
[1:47:57.320 --> 1:48:05.000]  calm in waves of terror and then they're the savior that each time they tighten down promising
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  do what we say you get out then they let you partially out because you don't notice that
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:17.760]  each time they only loosen it a little bit but tighten it down more the time after so
[1:48:17.760 --> 1:48:22.640]  again they go from a hundred to eighty and they go back to ninety then they go to seventy
[1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:27.220]  and they go back to eighty then they go to sixty then they go back to seventy then they
[1:48:27.220 --> 1:48:31.280]  go down to forty then they go back to fifty then they go back to twenty then they go back
[1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:36.280]  to thirty and they go down to ten and they go out to fifteen then they go down to five
[1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:39.920]  then they go out to seven then they go out to three and they go out to five then they
[1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:44.820]  go down to one and then they snap your neck.
[1:48:44.820 --> 1:48:50.520]  that's how a bulb constrictor works as well it crushes crushes crushes then lets you think
[1:48:50.520 --> 1:48:54.160]  it's going to let go so you and then when you let go and relax to get air it
[1:48:54.160 --> 1:49:02.680]  really now you must get ready others Bloomberg the permanent pandemic they
[1:49:02.680 --> 1:49:06.000]  said day one of their white papers like we're animals to their own people oh
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:09.200]  we'll give people 10 shots a year it'll never end and then we're going to say
[1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:13.440]  adults have it and take their kids to shield centers where the government keeps
[1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:16.980]  your kids well you already let them keep your parents and nursing homes and you
[1:49:16.980 --> 1:49:21.120]  can't see them while they intubate them and kill them they're turning the
[1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:25.520]  hospitals into presence and you sit there oh just put up with it we'll make
[1:49:25.520 --> 1:49:29.760]  it through this just 15 days to cut the curve oh just 15 days from the
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:37.040]  hospitals and I told you it's not 15 days it's forever because these are bad
[1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:42.040]  people going for broke so I had a compilation it's like four minutes long
[1:49:42.040 --> 1:49:46.120]  of people chasing to go around but now it's already escalated to them screaming
[1:49:46.120 --> 1:49:50.080]  tearing things down and throwing rocks at him as he runs and of course they
[1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:52.600]  got the electronic machines and they're gonna stuff them and they're gonna make
[1:49:52.600 --> 1:49:56.280]  sure he wins just like it doesn't matter of Biden as a 20% approval writing he
[1:49:56.280 --> 1:49:59.240]  got put in there he's a puppet but when they want to get rid of him they will
[1:49:59.240 --> 1:50:04.720]  like CNN's like why is he so unpopular 24th Amendment time to step down there's
[1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:11.240]  how about get rid of Kamala too so it would be Nancy Pelosi because it's all
[1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:16.360]  about having whoever's most senior in their authoritarian system like North
[1:50:16.360 --> 1:50:21.360]  Korea get the power so here is video there's a whole bunch of these we can't
[1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:24.520]  play all of those are so much cussing but Canadians rise up Trudeau Pelton
[1:50:24.520 --> 1:50:27.760]  with stones shout it out my angry citizens see all the uncensored video
[1:50:27.760 --> 1:50:31.680]  and info wars calm and then share it and then tell folks to share it and then
[1:50:31.680 --> 1:50:35.080]  tell them to tell folks to share it that triggers the chain reaction which
[1:50:35.080 --> 1:50:39.000]  triggers the victory they wouldn't be suppressing us if we couldn't defeat them
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:42.520]  and we are going to we have to we will and we have a good shot at it if you
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:46.800]  take action to do it easily instead of the hard way so here is the latest
[1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:49.040]  footage
[1:50:49.040 --> 1:51:10.400]  remember what Klaus Schwab said he said I know you're a very angry on the
[1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:14.880]  lockdown you're going to become more angry more it's in a hundred point IMF
[1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:20.720]  plan there's 21st points than 80 sub points that Greg Palace the BBC back
[1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:29.160]  with a decent job 20 years ago got in 2002 so 19 years ago and it said we will
[1:51:29.160 --> 1:51:34.080]  destabilize fascist right-wing left-wing we don't care and we'll make the people
[1:51:34.080 --> 1:51:37.760]  hate the government the government works for us and then they'll finally over
[1:51:37.760 --> 1:51:41.440]  the government and burn everything and that'll drive down all the stocks and
[1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:44.800]  everything and we'll come in and buy it up which is the great reset and then
[1:51:44.800 --> 1:51:51.160]  don't worry now you're going to get them work like a L hefe voice that's not
[1:51:51.160 --> 1:51:56.840]  really a German voice let me think how the German speaks like Klaus Schwab he
[1:51:56.840 --> 1:52:03.440]  says that you are going to be very angry help hear it from him here it is I
[1:52:03.440 --> 1:52:09.640]  don't know how it will play out in November but what we know is that we
[1:52:09.640 --> 1:52:15.520]  will end up with many more unemployed and particularly also people in the gray
[1:52:15.520 --> 1:52:21.280]  economy which are not counted for who lose their job so we will see
[1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:28.560]  definitely a lot of anger already now but probably increased by the end of
[1:52:28.560 --> 1:52:34.240]  the year and because this crisis will be with us until we really have found
[1:52:34.240 --> 1:52:43.840]  remedy so we have to prepare for a more angry world and how to prepare it means
[1:52:43.840 --> 1:52:50.960]  to take the necessary action to create the fair world to see that that's enough
[1:52:50.960 --> 1:52:57.920]  so you this this crisis will continue until we find a solution global
[1:52:57.920 --> 1:53:02.440]  government global ideas guaranteed universal income if you behave yourself
[1:53:02.440 --> 1:53:05.880]  that subsistence level I mean that's the plan that's in his book it's being
[1:53:05.880 --> 1:53:10.320]  implemented all the world that's the dystopian so he hopes you go after
[1:53:10.320 --> 1:53:15.400]  Trudeau he hopes you go after Bill Gates that's a Freudian slip I hope you
[1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:20.200]  go after Bill Gates they hope you just go after their puppets like Biden and
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:24.600]  and and Trudeau and Merkel who I hate and who I think you should protest and
[1:53:24.600 --> 1:53:28.120]  demonstrate against everywhere they go that's great to show their fraud but you
[1:53:28.120 --> 1:53:32.000]  should also be pointing out they're just puppets of the great reset and it's the
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:35.640]  great reset that starving people and destroying the economy on record and
[1:53:35.640 --> 1:53:40.040]  then posing as our saviors and they're the people that cooked up the virus and
[1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:45.080]  made it and released it and that's all admitted now how frickin huge is that
[1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:49.920]  let's play a few more minutes of some of the compilations of Trudeau being
[1:53:49.920 --> 1:53:53.200]  chased around Canada in the last two weeks now building towards people
[1:53:53.200 --> 1:54:10.560]  overturning cars and throwing rocks at him until he has to flee in fear here it is
[1:54:53.200 --> 1:55:08.520]  this is all over Canada this is happening
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:18.320]  that's enough it goes on and on and there's a reason big tech spy I mean
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:22.080]  there's a reason Apple reads all your text messages and scans your phone
[1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:26.320]  Google does it too there's a reason they send pedophiles a drag queen story time
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:30.480]  to me with your kids there's a reason the borders are open they've never been
[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:34.400]  held accountable what did Thomas Jefferson one of the founding terrorists
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:39.560]  say according to Biden when the people fear the government there is tyranny
[1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:46.720]  when the government fears the people there is liberty that's very very simple
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:53.520]  equation ladies and gentlemen and this is not our government this is corporate
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:57.400]  governance we guys put the Washington Post headline back up states are an
[1:55:57.400 --> 1:56:04.800]  archaic thing states are a bygone error get rid of states yeah bygone error like
[1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:09.720]  the nuclear family and a two-gar garage and going on vacation and owning a gun
[1:56:09.720 --> 1:56:14.360]  and having security and having a social contract and the government working for
[1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:17.520]  you and having a culture that's trying to build a better world for our children
[1:56:17.520 --> 1:56:22.080]  you know Christian egalitarian classical liberal society not the leftist
[1:56:22.080 --> 1:56:26.800]  neoliberal fascist slash communist satanic nightmare so look at that
[1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:29.600]  headline for the Washington Post put it back up please great job group finding
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:35.280]  that states are a relic of the past it's time to get rid of them because they
[1:56:35.280 --> 1:56:38.840]  don't want the checks and balances of a bunch of different states the founders
[1:56:38.840 --> 1:56:43.200]  said so if one falls people can move to another and then that'll reform that
[1:56:43.200 --> 1:56:45.960]  state that's why there's three branches of government federally and at the state
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:50.880]  level so that no power gets concentrated up the left and the UN want to get rid
[1:56:50.880 --> 1:56:55.920]  of our nations all together no borders no walls no USA at all America's race is
[1:56:55.920 --> 1:56:59.800]  America's bad because once you get rid of that you don't have to process and any
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:03.680]  of those ideas anymore it's all claus Schwab you will own nothing you will have
[1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:07.600]  nothing you will like it we have captured your government me talks like a
[1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:10.740]  Martian that lands to announces in control we are in control of your
[1:57:10.740 --> 1:57:14.560]  governments we will take your children I haven't gotten to that yet we got a
[1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:17.880]  special guest but I have the UN official announcements that the children
[1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:22.200]  belong to the UN there's a program name all of it and suddenly it's all over the
[1:57:22.200 --> 1:57:26.000]  news saying and I mean every dystopic nightmare every tyrannical action
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:29.520]  everything you ever heard about history that's bad is now being thrown at us
[1:57:29.520 --> 1:57:36.040]  we'll be back the purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty
[1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:40.680]  to be afraid of today half the population has lined up for an untested
[1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:44.760]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be
[1:57:44.760 --> 1:57:49.120]  afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this
[1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:53.760]  have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an
[1:57:53.760 --> 1:57:58.760]  artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years for those of us who
[1:57:58.760 --> 1:58:02.320]  have awoken from the spell we know this is all really happening and it's
[1:58:02.320 --> 1:58:07.680]  unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do we continue
[1:58:07.680 --> 1:58:11.320]  sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken
[1:58:11.320 --> 1:58:16.400]  from the cold spell then we win but even when we win and we eventually will the
[1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:21.200]  days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare get up to a
[1:58:21.200 --> 1:58:27.080]  years worth of storable foods water filtration survival gear seeds shortwave

[2:00:01.240 --> 2:00:06.560]  the frontline battle is Australia it is the admitted UN model coming to the
[2:00:06.560 --> 2:00:10.760]  UK coming to Canada coming to the United States they're gonna release more
[2:00:10.760 --> 2:00:14.400]  viruses for more control have a special guest coming up next segment here's the
[2:00:14.400 --> 2:00:19.080]  Victorian premier Dan Andrew saying we've got everybody locked down we're
[2:00:19.080 --> 2:00:23.240]  going to move to a situation where we're going to lock out and lock down people
[2:00:23.240 --> 2:00:27.840]  who are not vaccinated then they go on to say in quarantine camps and that ties
[2:00:27.840 --> 2:00:33.680]  in to Australian senator Malcolm Roberts on the crime against humanity of
[2:00:33.680 --> 2:00:39.360]  blocking ivermectin and then our special guest is gonna be joining us coming up
[2:00:39.360 --> 2:00:44.120]  here in the next segment but here are two of those clips back to back from a
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:48.720]  situation where to protect the health system we've got everybody locked down
[2:00:48.720 --> 2:00:53.080]  we're gonna move to a situation where to protect the health system we're gonna
[2:00:53.080 --> 2:00:58.160]  lock out people who are not vaccinated and can be if you're making the choice
[2:00:58.160 --> 2:01:02.640]  not to get vaccinated then you're making the wrong choice you're making the
[2:01:02.640 --> 2:01:05.840]  wrong choice and for safety's sake and for the back to that point about how
[2:01:05.840 --> 2:01:10.120]  much work our nurses have to do as this becomes absolutely a pandemic of the
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:14.520]  unvaccinated and we open everything up it's not gonna be safe for people who
[2:01:14.520 --> 2:01:19.120]  are not vaccinated to be roaming around the place spreading the virus that's
[2:01:19.120 --> 2:01:23.320]  what they'll be that's what they'll be doing so there's every reason every reason
[2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:26.840]  to get vaccinated and there are appointments available and there'll be
[2:01:26.840 --> 2:01:30.480]  even more appointments about September October November what a crowd let's
[2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:34.840]  get to those thresholds as fast as we possibly can but yes there's gonna be a
[2:01:34.840 --> 2:01:39.040]  vaccinated economy and you get to participate that you get to participate
[2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:42.880]  in that if you are vaccinated now that's not right now because of course there's
[2:01:42.880 --> 2:01:45.480]  many more people who want to get vaccinated than we actually can get
[2:01:45.480 --> 2:01:48.720]  through the system but we're going to get to a point where everybody that's a lie
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:52.720]  and pause he's creating artificial scarcity they've got it's a total lot
[2:01:52.720 --> 2:01:55.800]  that these people are total evil but I'm sorry go ahead and finish up have a
[2:01:55.800 --> 2:02:03.080]  situation well vaccinated will have been offered the chance to do so and we are
[2:02:03.080 --> 2:02:07.560]  not going to have a situation well at least not in Victoria where we lock the
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:12.680]  whole place down to protect people who won't protect themselves these go and
[2:02:12.680 --> 2:02:17.120]  get vaccinated there's 11,000 AZ appointments available this week 2,000
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:20.560]  Pfizer appointments available this week we'll have more to say with those
[2:02:20.560 --> 2:02:24.280]  additional stocks coming in from overseas but again folks they didn't lock you
[2:02:24.280 --> 2:02:27.520]  down for your safety locks you down to train you how to be a slave they release
[2:02:27.520 --> 2:02:33.600]  the virus it's all coming out Fauci ordered the karmiric creation of SARS
[2:02:33.600 --> 2:02:39.320]  COVID-2 and that's been now released that's public today the documents via a
[2:02:39.320 --> 2:02:42.200]  lawsuit have come out he should be arrested immediately but of course you
[2:02:42.200 --> 2:02:44.920]  did a great job at the establishment he won't be he'll be celebrated as our
[2:02:44.920 --> 2:02:48.360]  savior because he is the author of our destruction here's the Australian
[2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:53.800]  senator Malcolm Roberts treating and preventing people getting COVID-19 we've
[2:02:53.800 --> 2:02:59.400]  been told that the only solution is a brand new vaccine that's not true there
[2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:02.720]  are alternative and complementary treatments for respiratory conditions
[2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:09.200]  which is what COVID-19 is one of them is ivermectin it's had over 3.7 billion
[2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:13.880]  doses administered over the last 60 years in that time it's had a proven
[2:03:13.880 --> 2:03:17.840]  safety record over the past year ivermectin has been successful we're
[2:03:17.840 --> 2:03:22.480]  used against COVID in some Indian states and in some South American European and
[2:03:22.480 --> 2:03:28.000]  Asian countries there are over 40 medical and scientific papers which hail
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:34.560]  ivermectin success so why is it banned for this use with COVID in Australia it
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:38.120]  raises serious questions about big farmers monopoly and conflicts of
[2:03:38.120 --> 2:03:42.320]  interest and its stranglehold over government for example Google's parent
[2:03:42.320 --> 2:03:47.760]  company Alphabet owns YouTube YouTube has banned any videos that even mention
[2:03:47.760 --> 2:03:51.440]  ivermectin as a possible COVID treatment they even took down one of my
[2:03:51.440 --> 2:03:57.840]  videos and I'm a federal senator but here's the kicker Alphabet owns 12% of
[2:03:57.840 --> 2:04:02.800]  Vaxitech who created the AstraZeneca vaccine aren't these conflicts of
[2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:06.640]  interest the federal government's therapeutic goods administration wrote
[2:04:06.640 --> 2:04:12.000]  me a threatening letter for publicly discussing ivermectin the way I see it
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:16.880]  I'm a duly elected member of Australia's National Parliament doing my lawful duty
[2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:23.240]  sharing accurate data and information with you silencing debate and data is a
[2:04:23.240 --> 2:04:30.800]  form of control and always beneath control there is fear is dishonest big
[2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:35.480]  farmer afraid of losing its hundreds of billions of dollars in profits is the
[2:04:35.480 --> 2:04:38.360]  government afraid to admit he goes on to say they have blood on their hands I

[2:06:21.440 --> 2:06:25.400]  today but I definitely kind of want the first hour of it because Paul Watson's
[2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:29.160]  coming up next hour I got a huge guest right now and I feel like today I've
[2:06:29.160 --> 2:06:32.360]  got to get this on record or I may just tape an emergency report after my show
[2:06:32.360 --> 2:06:38.160]  today that we then put out and hopefully over there on his show because
[2:06:38.160 --> 2:06:43.320]  everything breaking right now is totally insane it came out today the
[2:06:43.320 --> 2:06:47.280]  intercept suit and got it very respected investigative journalist group
[2:06:47.280 --> 2:06:55.200]  where Fauci is in hundreds of pages of documents we showed earlier saying I want
[2:06:55.200 --> 2:06:59.800]  all these viruses combined into a kind mirror for a new SARS virus so we can
[2:06:59.800 --> 2:07:02.480]  make a vaccine we already have Peter Dazik we ran the program for him saying
[2:07:02.480 --> 2:07:09.080]  on video but now it's the documents here they are we have them linked up on
[2:07:09.080 --> 2:07:14.640]  info wars.com can also see it again on zero hedge has it linked right there at
[2:07:14.640 --> 2:07:19.840]  the top let's post this zero hedge article info wars it's the best and here
[2:07:19.840 --> 2:07:23.440]  they are with Fauci ordering it all so he's perjured himself to Congress but
[2:07:23.440 --> 2:07:27.280]  we already knew this we already had other documents and here's Fauci with Peter
[2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:33.280]  Dazik so we've got a very special guest so I really wanted to get on she really
[2:07:33.280 --> 2:07:39.560]  helped expose hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and all these other great
[2:07:39.560 --> 2:07:42.520]  things that people get it early basically have a hundred percent treatment
[2:07:42.520 --> 2:07:47.320]  rate we had Dr. McCullough on yesterday it's in mainline news that India
[2:07:47.320 --> 2:07:53.120]  created the mutation of Delta where they vaccinated so I mean the system knows
[2:07:53.120 --> 2:07:58.400]  what they're doing Dr. Stella Immanuel MD is a successful physician with an
[2:07:58.400 --> 2:08:02.040]  active practice in Houston as well as a founder of firepower ministries in
[2:08:02.040 --> 2:08:06.520]  Katy, Texas she diverts her life and resorts the teaching believers everywhere
[2:08:06.520 --> 2:08:10.760]  to identify the sorts of spiritual weakness deception and defeat one
[2:08:10.760 --> 2:08:14.680]  strategies of warfare to enable them to get and maintain her freedom Dr. Stella
[2:08:14.680 --> 2:08:19.400]  MD.com and I don't just agree with her I know this is spiritual war the Satanist
[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:27.320]  the big national church have said came out and said we are sacrificing babies
[2:08:27.320 --> 2:08:32.200]  in a ritual well that they busted a bunch of doctors doing that before so this
[2:08:32.200 --> 2:08:35.400]  is their energy this is their power Satan's making his movies out in the
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:39.560]  open and this is a spiritual war they want in our bodies they want to change
[2:08:39.560 --> 2:08:44.080]  our DNA they want to mutate us and they now admit that Klaus Schwab says I want
[2:08:44.080 --> 2:08:49.040]  to change your body it's a form of rape she said that they made fun of her but
[2:08:49.040 --> 2:08:53.000]  if putting the in genomes of dead babies and dead women and with immortal
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:57.560]  gene lines bizarre cells that never die in us isn't satanic I don't know what
[2:08:57.560 --> 2:09:02.720]  it is if creating deadly spike proteins in us that infect us and now they want
[2:09:02.720 --> 2:09:07.120]  to inject our children then I don't know what satanic supposed to be you know
[2:09:07.120 --> 2:09:13.640]  it means bad Dr. Stella MD.com doctor thank you so much obviously I want to
[2:09:13.640 --> 2:09:16.400]  get into them suppressing treatments I want to get into all things happening
[2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:21.280]  in the world but what do you make of being vindicated and now we know all over
[2:09:21.280 --> 2:09:26.160]  the world where they have ivermectin early like India that that into their
[2:09:26.160 --> 2:09:30.240]  problem where they don't we have mass death and and what do you make of it
[2:09:30.240 --> 2:09:34.160]  coming out confirmed that Fauci created this obviously look at the timing
[2:09:34.160 --> 2:09:38.760]  releasing on purpose what would you call this point we're at right now and I
[2:09:38.760 --> 2:09:42.080]  just want to try to give you the floor of this hour you've been censored and
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:45.400]  lied about so much to really put on record what's really happening God bless
[2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:49.920]  you and thank you for joining us thank you so much Alex it's my pleasure to be
[2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:53.960]  here thank you for having me like I said you're my hero I've watched you for
[2:09:53.960 --> 2:09:57.880]  years so I thank God I'm here to and I've been on your show sorry about it's
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:10:02.800]  awesome to be with you today I wish I could say that I wish I could say I feel
[2:10:02.800 --> 2:10:10.680]  vindicated and happy but I don't because man her Skype was totally clear and
[2:10:10.680 --> 2:10:13.600]  totally up sorry doc your Skype cut off for just a second but it's been clear
[2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:16.440]  the last five minutes while you're waiting and now it's back sorry start over
[2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:22.000]  doc yes I wish I could just say I'm vindicated and feel happy about it but
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:26.840]  people are dying and they're still that they're moving forward with their agenda
[2:10:26.840 --> 2:10:32.120]  to destroy humanity to corrupt humanity and somehow there is still upon the
[2:10:32.120 --> 2:10:37.720]  minds of a lot of people so that is I know that when I talked about the
[2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:40.960]  spiritual warfare I've told my doctor friends now I said I told you guys from
[2:10:40.960 --> 2:10:43.880]  March last year that this was a spiritual body was a spiritual battle and
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:47.600]  y'all thought I was just intense when I said you know we need to pray everybody
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:51.360]  tell Dr. Manu come on just stick to hydroxychlorine of course the sense of
[2:10:51.360 --> 2:10:54.800]  hydroxychlorine but you know what Alex hydroxychlorine still works I've met
[2:10:54.800 --> 2:10:58.880]  in still works videos and I still works and we still use these things little max
[2:10:58.880 --> 2:11:03.600]  we treat patients every day and right now right now over 70,000 patients and
[2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:09.040]  counting right now we're just swarmed we're getting 500 700 patients a day and
[2:11:09.040 --> 2:11:12.720]  we're here I've made a promise to the American people that I would do
[2:11:12.720 --> 2:11:15.880]  everything in my best to continue fighting this battle to help take care of
[2:11:15.880 --> 2:11:20.560]  them take care of our people but it's a serious battle and we have to wake up
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:24.040]  that's all I keep saying that we have to wake up we can we cannot continue just
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:27.480]  sticking our head in the sand like an ostrich and thinking things are gonna go
[2:11:27.480 --> 2:11:32.360]  away we have to wake up this is deeper than science this is actually deeper than
[2:11:32.360 --> 2:11:36.360]  big farmer this is deeper than them trying to make money it's we're going
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:41.040]  straight back into Genesis 6 and it's time for us to wake up that's just it
[2:11:41.040 --> 2:11:44.560]  and I totally agree when you read Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates they say
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:49.200]  they're taking control of humanity and creating a new being they say that humans
[2:11:49.200 --> 2:11:52.920]  are obsolete well that explain to people that's what happened in the days of Noah
[2:11:52.920 --> 2:11:58.680]  didn't it yes in the days of Noah the sons of God came and slept with daughters
[2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:02.040]  of many watchers they left their abode they came and slept with the daughters of
[2:12:02.040 --> 2:12:06.840]  men and they produce a hybrid this hybrid they were violent they were blood
[2:12:06.840 --> 2:12:10.280]  drinkers if you read like if you read in Genesis they talk about the earth was
[2:12:10.280 --> 2:12:16.320]  full of violence in Genesis 6 but there were also such blood drinkers that they
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:21.000]  really wanted to by the way all the other ancient cultures have this in their
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:24.720]  in their text and in their hieroglyphs all the other cultures report the same
[2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:28.880]  thing happened that ships landed these people got off they had sex with humans
[2:12:28.880 --> 2:12:33.120]  and then they made these iconic creatures yes and the creatures were
[2:12:33.120 --> 2:12:38.480]  violent they were blood thirsty and they were they're fed on flesh it was crazy if
[2:12:38.480 --> 2:12:42.200]  you read like the book of Enoch it's not a it's not a biblical book it's one of
[2:12:42.200 --> 2:12:45.800]  the apocrypha books but if you read this books you know the story these are
[2:12:45.800 --> 2:12:49.320]  things that happened in history it's not something I made up from you know
[2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:53.240]  something but so they came after me because they knew that what I was saying
[2:12:53.240 --> 2:12:55.960]  was true they came after me because what I was saying was not just about
[2:12:55.960 --> 2:13:00.560]  hydroxy it was they knew that there was something deeper in what I was doing you
[2:13:00.560 --> 2:13:04.960]  know so that's why they came after me but that's okay but now Alex we have to
[2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:08.880]  wake up the church cannot continue just sitting down and thinking well this is

[2:13:13.120 --> 2:13:17.040]  little more they just things are gonna get back to normal it's not going there
[2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:21.720]  things are getting crazier and crazier and I would sometimes it's good to put
[2:13:21.720 --> 2:13:26.440]  people to go back and tell people this this is what has been written in the
[2:13:26.440 --> 2:13:30.840]  Bible we're looking at today's news yesterday as you always call it and of
[2:13:30.840 --> 2:13:34.840]  course the Bible also in the New Testament predicts the world government
[2:13:34.840 --> 2:13:40.560]  the mark of the beast can't buy or sell and that's all now happening but Alex
[2:13:40.560 --> 2:13:44.320]  the thing about it is there's something I want to I want to talk about today that
[2:13:44.320 --> 2:13:48.680]  my book is coming out let America leave exposing the hidden agenda behind the
[2:13:48.680 --> 2:13:53.480]  2020 pandemic absolutely I should have announced that absolutely let America

[2:13:59.200 --> 2:14:03.160]  God said is showing me about this nation from when I got saved in this nation and
[2:14:03.160 --> 2:14:08.000]  the battles that we have fought up to the time when I got exposed I people think
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:11.040]  I just showed up no I've been praying and fighting for the nation for years and
[2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:15.960]  yes and yes and there's something I want to tell people today and I want
[2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:19.640]  everybody to hear me and I just pray that in minds and everybody will open up
[2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:23.160]  and they will hear what I'm saying and I take authority over every principality
[2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:27.560]  power ruler of darkness which are wickedness in high places any voice that

[2:14:31.480 --> 2:14:36.040]  pit where they belong in the name of Jesus let the prince of the power of the
[2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:40.320]  air be silent so that people can hear and people can wake up and they can be
[2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:44.920]  free in Jesus name I need to pray that prayer so that amen to that doc and we're

[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:09.920]  absolutely agree with you that whether people want to believe the Bible or not
[2:15:09.920 --> 2:15:13.760]  the globalists believe their gods they've been told get rid of humans you're
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:17.080]  gonna merge the machines and become a Superman that's what Ray Kurzweil says
[2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:21.000]  it's what Bill Gates says and they literally have a desire to kill us all
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:24.080]  and they've said they want to kill us and they mean to do it and they're
[2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:27.960]  they're trying it now that's why they're trying to block treatments that you've
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:30.680]  caught early it totally knocks it out people say well you've changed your
[2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:33.480]  story last year you said it was overblown now you say it's dangerous yeah

[2:18:47.680 --> 2:18:51.520]  country we would have never defeated the British 250 years ago if we didn't have
[2:18:51.520 --> 2:18:55.720]  a lot of optimism and we didn't persevere George Washington lost most of
[2:18:55.720 --> 2:18:59.920]  his major battles but he kept fighting for six years and finally we won well

[2:20:09.320 --> 2:20:11.440]  next segment I'm gonna play it's only a few minutes long as I want to get
[2:20:11.440 --> 2:20:17.200]  doctors Stella Emanuel's take on it Australian National Senator Malcolm
[2:20:17.200 --> 2:20:22.560]  Roberts on ivermectin how the suppression of those that did this have
[2:20:22.560 --> 2:20:28.080]  blood on their hands but he gets into very astutely how googled and others
[2:20:28.080 --> 2:20:31.800]  are invested in these so-called vaccines which is a total conflict of
[2:20:31.800 --> 2:20:37.400]  interest remember Fauci is as well so now it's come out that he specifically
[2:20:37.400 --> 2:20:41.960]  ordered them to make COVID-19 the intercept has the documents it's
[2:20:41.960 --> 2:20:44.880]  incredible but we already knew that from other documents but this is the
[2:20:44.880 --> 2:20:49.160]  smoking gun he lied to Congress but remember Google and Facebook invested
[2:20:49.160 --> 2:20:52.680]  hundreds of millions at the Wuhan lab and we're involved in this project as
[2:20:52.680 --> 2:20:57.240]  it's the project to take the world over that's why they're involved suppressing
[2:20:57.240 --> 2:21:02.400]  people so forget just censoring the public they're censoring Congress this
[2:21:02.400 --> 2:21:05.960]  senator Australia says he's been censored for talking about it on YouTube
[2:21:05.960 --> 2:21:11.080]  well so is Senator Paul so Congress really is making itself vestigial
[2:21:11.080 --> 2:21:15.600]  ceremonial by not taking action against this dr. Stella Emanuel the medical
[2:21:15.600 --> 2:21:19.560]  doctor who's had some of the first big press conferences in DC standing up and
[2:21:19.560 --> 2:21:23.120]  saying there are treatments they're suppressing obviously safe countless
[2:21:23.120 --> 2:21:26.520]  lives she's one of the biggest practices in the country in Houston this is a
[2:21:26.520 --> 2:21:29.520]  shorter segment longer segment coming up not her tell you you've got the floor
[2:21:29.520 --> 2:21:33.040]  so just you're like just like me you get excited you're right the world's
[2:21:33.040 --> 2:21:36.920]  changing it's getting worse by design lay out where you think they're going
[2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:40.720]  what we can do you've got the floor wherever you want to go please please
[2:21:40.720 --> 2:21:46.040]  speak to us yes Alex number one before we go forward I want to tell the
[2:21:46.040 --> 2:21:51.520]  American people this battle of hiding is an invisible barrel don't sit down and
[2:21:51.520 --> 2:21:55.120]  think that well you can handle it you're strong you're powerful you're gonna blow
[2:21:55.120 --> 2:21:58.800]  something in the air and you can't breathe so we advise that everybody get
[2:21:58.800 --> 2:22:02.080]  on hydroxychloroquine for prevention or I've been making for prevention in fact
[2:22:02.080 --> 2:22:05.560]  right now they are censoring I've met him as a medicine is going through what
[2:22:05.560 --> 2:22:08.440]  hydroxychloroquine went through last year you know but right now it's harder to
[2:22:08.440 --> 2:22:11.480]  get a medicine so we actually recommend you get hydroxychloroquine get on the
[2:22:11.480 --> 2:22:15.160]  vitamins Alex has a lot of you have a lot of good supplements make sure you get
[2:22:15.160 --> 2:22:19.960]  on your supplements vitamin D vitamin C zinc quacetin make sure that you keep
[2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:23.760]  your immunity strong make sure you get on prevention and when you start having
[2:22:23.760 --> 2:22:27.080]  that little sniffle don't just think oh my god it's just a little sniffle you'll
[2:22:27.080 --> 2:22:31.800]  go away please get early treatment we'd have a few people that are working right
[2:22:31.800 --> 2:22:35.560]  now we're all swamped but we're gonna be here and we're ramping up people to help
[2:22:35.560 --> 2:22:38.640]  to make sure that we continue to take care of the American people right now
[2:22:38.640 --> 2:22:42.440]  there's craziness happening in the hospital Alex people are dying in the
[2:22:42.440 --> 2:22:46.280]  hospitals they're killing people and they are not giving them the treatment
[2:22:46.280 --> 2:22:49.720]  they are begging for treatment people are calling me come and take care of my
[2:22:49.720 --> 2:22:52.200]  family member because I won't give them I've met and they won't give them
[2:22:52.200 --> 2:22:55.800]  anything the people that are not vaccinated are going to the hospital
[2:22:55.800 --> 2:22:59.240]  right now and they are getting they are almost not giving them any treatment and
[2:22:59.240 --> 2:23:03.040]  it's beginning to come to places where they might not want to treat them so
[2:23:03.040 --> 2:23:07.040]  there's something going on that is way deeper than big pharma just trying to
[2:23:07.040 --> 2:23:11.040]  make money is way deeper than you know the globalist or they call it globalist
[2:23:11.040 --> 2:23:16.160]  but I think what is going on right now Alex is that we have people among us that
[2:23:16.160 --> 2:23:20.840]  I'm just gonna say it and somebody wake up and hear this these people were
[2:23:20.840 --> 2:23:26.480]  dealing with they are not human beings we are dealing with an evil seed in the
[2:23:26.480 --> 2:23:31.120]  land that are not human that are blood thirsty and blood drinkers if you go to
[2:23:31.120 --> 2:23:37.360]  the book of Daniel Daniel chapter 2 verse 42 to 43 it talks about an image
[2:23:37.360 --> 2:23:42.000]  that Nebuchadnezzar saw and Daniel interpreted that image to mean that they
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:48.160]  heard that the last part of the image because we're gonna be a ion mixed with
[2:23:48.160 --> 2:23:52.360]  Mary clay Mary clay is human for human was made from earth and then iron is
[2:23:52.360 --> 2:23:57.000]  machine it said that as the way iron mixes with Mary clay they shall mingle
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:24:00.800]  they said let me read the scripture so that you guys can hear me we have people
[2:24:00.800 --> 2:24:05.800]  that are living among us that are not human that are a mixed seed and they
[2:24:05.800 --> 2:24:09.840]  are blood thirsty they are blood drinkers and I'm gonna give you scripture
[2:24:09.840 --> 2:24:14.880]  after scripture to show you this Daniel chapter 2 verse 42 to 44 says and as the
[2:24:14.880 --> 2:24:19.480]  toes of the feet were part iron and part clay so the kingdom shall be partly
[2:24:19.480 --> 2:24:25.320]  strong and partly broken and whereas does so it iron mix with Mary clay they
[2:24:25.320 --> 2:24:30.760]  shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not live one to
[2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:35.640]  another even as iron does not mix with clay they shall mingle themselves with
[2:24:35.640 --> 2:24:40.280]  the seed of men so basically there's an evil seat in the land that is mingled
[2:24:40.280 --> 2:24:43.600]  with the seed of men when they start talking about mingling with the seed
[2:24:43.600 --> 2:24:50.160]  that you again her Skype broke up but I think you need to hear this folks doc
[2:24:50.160 --> 2:24:53.600]  doc stay there while it reconnects depending on how you interpret this
[2:24:53.600 --> 2:24:56.760]  here's what I know they're demon possessed they've been given over to
[2:24:56.760 --> 2:25:00.600]  follow their orders and not because Rob do went to the hospital his family
[2:25:00.600 --> 2:25:04.160]  wanted to go couldn't breathe and they wouldn't give him any medicine they were
[2:25:04.160 --> 2:25:07.640]  just waiting to intubate him and he got up went and got the treatments and got
[2:25:07.640 --> 2:25:12.640]  better and so most hospitals again we've had judges having to order them to give
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:16.920]  people ivermectin, fibroxychloricone or even Regeneron and so what you're
[2:25:16.920 --> 2:25:21.560]  saying is are you saying like David Ike is they actually interdimensionally
[2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:26.440]  been taking over or are you saying that it's a spiritual you know possession
[2:25:26.440 --> 2:25:30.200]  because I agree with you we're seeing the Satan has come out and say abortion is
[2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:34.120]  our ritual we want to kill babies let me ask you this why do you think they're
[2:25:34.120 --> 2:25:40.160]  revealing themselves right now Alex you don't understand there are not human
[2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:44.640]  beings this is not satanist this is not human beings that are possessed they are
[2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:48.480]  not human what the Bible says they are not even human let's look at Revelation
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:54.920]  13 Revelation 13 verse 14 to 16 says he deceived them that dwell on the earth by
[2:25:54.920 --> 2:25:58.560]  the means of the miracles he had power to do inside of the beast saying to them
[2:25:58.560 --> 2:26:03.560]  that dwell on the earth that they should make an image onto the beast which had
[2:26:03.560 --> 2:26:09.160]  been wounded with the sword and it lived he had power to give life to give
[2:26:09.160 --> 2:26:14.000]  breath to the image of the beast that they will speak and they will cause
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:18.680]  those as many as will not worship the image of the beast to be killed he
[2:26:18.680 --> 2:26:23.440]  causes all both great and small rich and poor free and born to receive a mark on
[2:26:23.440 --> 2:26:27.440]  the right hand or their forehead no man will buy or sell except they take the
[2:26:27.440 --> 2:26:32.040]  mark or the name or the number of his name there are three things there's a
[2:26:32.040 --> 2:26:35.440]  mark of the beast there's a name of the beast as in there's the number of his
[2:26:35.440 --> 2:26:40.520]  name right now all the vaccines are full of the number of the name and the name
[2:26:40.520 --> 2:26:45.000]  of the beast it's not a mark but Moderna vaccine as Luciferous that's the name of
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:50.240]  the beast yes I'm saying the vaccine this is 666 is everywhere in it so all the
[2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:53.640]  vaccines are full of that but what they are saying here in Revelation 13 is that
[2:26:53.640 --> 2:26:59.200]  the devil would deceive human beings they will make images they will make clones
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:05.080]  onto themselves and he will give life to those clones so he will give breath to
[2:27:05.080 --> 2:27:09.280]  them that they'll be able to speak so here is a real death behind this Alex
[2:27:09.280 --> 2:27:13.040]  I'm gonna say this because people need to hear this we can no longer just tell
[2:27:13.040 --> 2:27:16.320]  you guys the fluff because we're worried about oh you might not be able to
[2:27:16.320 --> 2:27:20.920]  receive it wake up and receive it and listen and read the Bible in Revelation
[2:27:20.920 --> 2:27:26.520]  13 is saying that the devil would deceive human beings to make images onto the
[2:27:26.520 --> 2:27:31.320]  beast okay people like Gates Fauci or whatever the devil has told them that he
[2:27:31.320 --> 2:27:36.040]  will make them live forever so they know that if they die they can make a clone
[2:27:36.040 --> 2:27:39.880]  of themselves they will download their mind to be intelligent of things and then
[2:27:39.880 --> 2:27:43.960]  they will put their mind back in that clone absolutely Microsoft has patents
[2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:47.720]  on that right here so that's what you're saying so that's the promise of the
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:53.480]  beast is artificial immoral life but it's a deception Alex because you see when
[2:27:53.480 --> 2:27:58.760]  these globalists die they will die and go to hell yes they'll be cloned but what
[2:27:58.760 --> 2:28:03.520]  is gonna live in them it's a demonic spirit and that is why they are so
[2:28:03.520 --> 2:28:07.800]  blood thirsty because what is living in these creatures are demonic spirits
[2:28:07.800 --> 2:28:10.800]  are not human beings so we don't even know what are some of these people that
[2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:14.120]  call themselves globalists whether they are still the human beings or the human
[2:28:14.120 --> 2:28:17.720]  beings have been killed off replaced with their clones and their robots that are
[2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:21.920]  pure evil well I know that's definitely the future plan that's our
[2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:25.200]  interpret revelation as well we know cloning's been going on for really 70
[2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:28.880]  years and we know they've done the animal human clones as well we'll talk
[2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:32.640]  about that when we come back three months ago Congress would not even ban
[2:28:32.640 --> 2:28:37.680]  human animal clones they admit are already been produced if you're concerned
[2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:41.000]  about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:45.080]  electricity this will be the most important message you'll hear this year
[2:28:45.080 --> 2:28:50.560]  here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock these
[2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:54.600]  emergency backup systems provide a life-saving backup power when you need
[2:28:54.600 --> 2:29:00.000]  most and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly emit no dangerous
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:04.640]  fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the Sun whether
[2:29:04.640 --> 2:29:08.640]  it's wildfires dangerous whether power grid issues or just getting off the
[2:29:08.640 --> 2:29:13.520]  grid you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again even better
[2:29:13.520 --> 2:29:19.360]  all this week radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses to go
[2:29:19.360 --> 2:29:23.760]  to my solar backup calm to learn more and check availability that's my solar
[2:29:23.760 --> 2:29:28.080]  backup calm look for the free report crisis cooling how to make absolutely
[2:29:28.080 --> 2:29:33.000]  sure your meat milk and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:39.720]  yours free at my solar backup calm I've been fighting as hard as I can for
[2:29:39.720 --> 2:29:45.160]  almost 28 years against the globalist I wanted to stop their agenda I wanted to
[2:29:45.160 --> 2:29:49.800]  wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational
[2:29:49.800 --> 2:29:54.160]  but we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting caught flat
[2:29:54.160 --> 2:29:59.600]  footed but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[2:29:59.600 --> 2:30:03.680]  great reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and
[2:30:03.680 --> 2:30:07.680]  all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready
[2:30:07.680 --> 2:30:11.360]  to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got a information warfare the
[2:30:11.360 --> 2:30:15.280]  enemy and try to stop their agenda we've also got to get personally prepared and
[2:30:15.280 --> 2:30:18.080]  one of the number one things to do is high-quality storeable food we've got
[2:30:18.080 --> 2:30:22.720]  the best food ready ship at very affordable prices at info or store.com so
[2:30:22.720 --> 2:30:26.480]  whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets it's
[2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:31.360]  ready to ship right now lock your orders in before food prices go up and before
[2:30:31.360 --> 2:30:35.520]  there are long lines and waits because believe me serious times are coming get
[2:30:35.520 --> 2:30:39.800]  ready at info or store.com the scientific dictatorship that I've been
[2:30:39.800 --> 2:30:45.320]  warning you about for 27 years has now gone for beta testing to operational the
[2:30:45.320 --> 2:30:49.120]  globalist are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover
[2:30:49.120 --> 2:30:52.920]  their robot takeover but the good news is we've been working and you've been
[2:30:52.920 --> 2:30:56.480]  working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get
[2:30:56.480 --> 2:31:00.920]  ready for this to be able to find it off humanity is strong we're incredible and
[2:31:00.920 --> 2:31:04.080]  if we're aware of the attack that's happening we have a real chance of
[2:31:04.080 --> 2:31:08.320]  defeating it if we ask God for guidance we will defeat it so prayer is essential
[2:31:08.320 --> 2:31:12.000]  research is essential getting prepared is essential and warning others is
[2:31:12.000 --> 2:31:16.800]  absolutely essential at the same time supporting info wars by buying high
[2:31:16.800 --> 2:31:20.080]  quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products
[2:31:20.080 --> 2:31:24.240]  for you and your family and they're also funding our operation info wars store
[2:31:24.240 --> 2:31:28.920]  dot com info wars store dot com is incredible a lot of our products that
[2:31:28.920 --> 2:31:32.080]  have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies
[2:31:32.080 --> 2:31:36.040]  bazo beats and others so get them today at info wars store calm and I thank you
[2:31:36.040 --> 2:31:41.680]  for being part of the resistance there is very little contemporary study in the
[2:31:41.680 --> 2:31:48.480]  world of the planet's ruling class not in communist China not in Mexico not in
[2:31:48.480 --> 2:31:54.200]  the United States not anywhere is there a real study of the planet's ruling class
[2:31:54.200 --> 2:31:58.300]  and that's done by design the large central banks that basically control the
[2:31:58.300 --> 2:32:03.800]  planet will penalize and target any academics that look into say the Anglo
[2:32:03.800 --> 2:32:07.200]  American establishment the founder the Bilderberg group the trilateral
[2:32:07.200 --> 2:32:12.000]  measure the United Nations whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers
[2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:16.000]  until 10 years ago the media said the control corporate media the Bilderberg
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:19.680]  group didn't exist well now the Bilderberg group is public and its
[2:32:19.680 --> 2:32:24.880]  former head show the steering committee is called Schwab and he has set up the
[2:32:24.880 --> 2:32:29.320]  great reset in global government and give as a liberty movement worldwide we
[2:32:29.320 --> 2:32:32.840]  don't address the globalist head on about the fact that they are worldwide
[2:32:32.840 --> 2:32:36.520]  authoritarian corporate takeover we don't have a shot we do expose them we
[2:32:36.520 --> 2:32:45.120]  can beat a measly you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:32:52.400 --> 2:32:58.800]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[2:32:59.800 --> 2:33:05.240]  dr. Stella Immanuel MD is our guest and she's been a tip of the spear with
[2:33:05.240 --> 2:33:09.400]  alternative treatments that all these major studies are out on now that they
[2:33:09.400 --> 2:33:13.360]  work and and but but she's getting into the spiritual nature of this in her
[2:33:13.360 --> 2:33:18.200]  interpretation of Genesis at the beginning of the Bible and Revelation at
[2:33:18.200 --> 2:33:22.200]  the end and you can't deny that all of that stuff is really coming true and
[2:33:22.200 --> 2:33:26.640]  you reclash wob or all these other globalists they say we're gonna take the
[2:33:26.640 --> 2:33:29.400]  human body over we're gonna merge the machines we're gonna get rid of all the
[2:33:29.400 --> 2:33:32.680]  humans humans are bad I have a whole stack of news right here that actually
[2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:35.680]  while she's talking I'll just show you some of the headlines Wall Street Journal
[2:33:35.680 --> 2:33:39.920]  New York Times they're all saying it they're announcing the end of parental
[2:33:39.920 --> 2:33:45.560]  rights they're gonna take our children that's in the UN but I can put on screen
[2:33:45.560 --> 2:33:49.840]  from two months ago or two and a half months ago the Senate refused to pass a
[2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:55.240]  law by eight votes to ban human animal cloning Senate Dems reject man on
[2:33:55.240 --> 2:34:00.440]  certain types of human animal experiments now I saw articles in
[2:34:00.440 --> 2:34:07.120]  mainline policy reports 25 years ago that were 20 plus years old about human
[2:34:07.120 --> 2:34:12.320]  animal clones because to get around the laws if you create an animal human clone
[2:34:12.320 --> 2:34:17.840]  where the human which part animal it has no rights and there's animal rights for
[2:34:17.840 --> 2:34:21.680]  some animals in testing there's rights for humans but not if they made an animal
[2:34:21.680 --> 2:34:25.600]  human clone also that you can grow a humanoid inside a cow instead of having
[2:34:25.600 --> 2:34:29.600]  to have a woman grow it this has all been going on for a long time people thought
[2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:33.440]  I was crazy you know I had the documents well now it's mainline news so this is a
[2:34:33.440 --> 2:34:37.280]  coming out of the genetic engineering a coming out of the cloning and I've got
[2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:41.160]  an article right here since she mentions it's seeing in Microsoft patented a chat
[2:34:41.160 --> 2:34:44.400]  bot that would let you talk to dead people it was too disturbing for a
[2:34:44.400 --> 2:34:48.840]  production and it records everything you say you do it even fool family members
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:52.680]  that it's you fool voice prints they're talking about putting this into a flesh
[2:34:52.680 --> 2:34:59.240]  body a replicant or into a plastic or metal avatar so yes I've talked to a
[2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:03.560]  high-level MIT scientist this is the holy grail this is what they're told by all
[2:35:03.560 --> 2:35:08.120]  the old rich people to do is a moral life and that is what the devil is
[2:35:08.120 --> 2:35:12.400]  offering him so she's dead on whether this is theoretical they're trying to
[2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:17.720]  build it like atomic bombs were theoretical in 1898 when max blank wrote
[2:35:17.720 --> 2:35:22.040]  up the equations then they were made true you know in 1945 whether this is
[2:35:22.040 --> 2:35:25.920]  theoretical or whether it's already going on at the level she's saying this
[2:35:25.920 --> 2:35:30.160]  is really where they want to take us so please continue with and quantify what
[2:35:30.160 --> 2:35:34.920]  you're trying to say here doctor no Alex it is not where they are taking us
[2:35:34.920 --> 2:35:40.440]  it's now in 2011 where we had been praying when the Lord told me to move to
[2:35:40.440 --> 2:35:45.680]  Houston to because I was ice practice now in Louisiana and I prayed and got to
[2:35:45.680 --> 2:35:48.560]  me to move to Houston and if I had not moved to Houston I'll not be able to do
[2:35:48.560 --> 2:35:52.240]  what I'm doing right now but at that time I had a vision and that vision I saw
[2:35:52.240 --> 2:35:56.920]  human beings walking with people it was a human beings and demons working or the
[2:35:56.920 --> 2:35:59.560]  work you see two or three people walking and some are human beings and some are
[2:35:59.560 --> 2:36:03.880]  other people and I've had many people with the Lord show me that there are
[2:36:03.880 --> 2:36:07.640]  people that are not human among us and I'm like what is this all about and I've
[2:36:07.640 --> 2:36:10.520]  been talking about it I'm preaching about it for years and they say oh yeah
[2:36:10.520 --> 2:36:14.800]  you're just crazy but really if you go in the Bible the Bible talks about it but
[2:36:14.800 --> 2:36:21.240]  here is what is the problem is how it affects us right now this this human
[2:36:21.240 --> 2:36:24.920]  this genetically modified human beings or whatever they are I don't know whether
[2:36:24.920 --> 2:36:28.880]  they're nephalums or they are clones or they are just demonic spirits in in
[2:36:28.880 --> 2:36:32.840]  containers in human-looking containers you should watch a movie called the leaf
[2:36:32.840 --> 2:36:37.120]  because when the Lord gave me this vision the very next day I don't know
[2:36:37.120 --> 2:36:40.600]  I was looking for online I found that movie the leaf so it actually explain
[2:36:40.600 --> 2:36:44.880]  exactly what I'm talking about but here's the thing what's really called the
[2:36:44.880 --> 2:36:53.320]  leaf they live John Carpenter's they live oh they live oh absolutely yeah yeah
[2:36:53.320 --> 2:36:58.400]  that movie just depicts what's going on okay so but here is the issue here these
[2:36:58.400 --> 2:37:02.360]  creatures okay like they can tell you gates or Fauci that wall you know you're
[2:37:02.360 --> 2:37:06.280]  gonna live forever but they are just they'll be useful idiots to listen to the
[2:37:06.280 --> 2:37:09.400]  devil the devil can't give anybody eternal life because he doesn't have it to
[2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:14.880]  give but what yes they see this globalist or the human counterparts told
[2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:18.680]  them that you will live forever so because why would be you get we try to
[2:37:18.680 --> 2:37:22.000]  depopulate you and keep the earth it is going to be dying in the next 20 years
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:24.560]  they've told them to live forever because they've told them they've lived
[2:37:24.560 --> 2:37:28.800]  forever so they are trying to depopulate us let me just say this they had an
[2:37:28.800 --> 2:37:34.040]  article in NBC it's everywhere it's their religion saying yes by 2045 will be no
[2:37:34.040 --> 2:37:38.880]  more humans will all merge the machines or be killed basically so so the global
[2:37:38.880 --> 2:37:44.880] ists say this quote you know there's the quotes from Elon Musk he's come out and
[2:37:44.880 --> 2:37:52.080]  warned about it and basic and so did so did Bill Joy of Sun Microsystems he he
[2:37:52.080 --> 2:37:56.400]  said they have a plan to kill everybody but go ahead yeah so what they are doing
[2:37:56.400 --> 2:38:00.640]  is they're telling this globalist this all of them tell it if they are still
[2:38:00.640 --> 2:38:03.560]  human because it is possible that a lot of them have been killed off and is
[2:38:03.560 --> 2:38:07.240]  their clone just walking around and doing evil so we don't know so they are
[2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:10.840]  telling them that don't worry if you die we're gonna clone you and they were
[2:38:10.840 --> 2:38:13.400]  gonna bring back your brain from the Internet of Things and put it up and
[2:38:13.400 --> 2:38:15.880]  you're gonna live forever so they are trying to depopulate the world so that
[2:38:15.880 --> 2:38:19.200]  they can keep the world for themselves that they are just useful idiots because
[2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:22.080]  the devil is not gonna give them eternal life they're gonna die and go to hell
[2:38:22.080 --> 2:38:25.000]  they will clone them all right but what's gonna live inside them is a
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:29.400]  demonic spirit and those when those clones go around with those demonic spirits
[2:38:29.400 --> 2:38:34.360]  inside them they are so blood thirsty because they need that is why you hear
[2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:38.040]  about child sacrifice and now people are dying in the hospitals because these
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:42.120]  clones have multiplied and they need to they need flesh and blood to live the
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:47.440]  Bible talks about it in in Revelation chapter 17 verse but Revelation 17 says
[2:38:47.440 --> 2:38:51.720]  that that that that they have drunk the blood of people you have some say it
[2:38:51.720 --> 2:38:57.280]  talks about it it says they're drunk on the blood of the saints and that they
[2:38:57.280 --> 2:39:04.040]  traffic in the souls of men yes so they are actually blood tested that is what
[2:39:04.040 --> 2:39:08.200]  keeps them alive that's the only way they can keep that human cloak is to eat
[2:39:08.200 --> 2:39:13.200]  flesh and drink blood some 27 said when my enemies came upon me to eat my flesh
[2:39:13.200 --> 2:39:18.720]  they stumbled and fall you know something Isaiah 49 24 26 say shall the prey be
[2:39:18.720 --> 2:39:23.240]  taken from the mighty we have become the prey and also read it's interesting
[2:39:23.240 --> 2:39:26.920]  around the world vampirism mental illness is expanding and I see a lot of
[2:39:26.920 --> 2:39:30.720]  articles out of cannibalism all over the world Africa you've got these occultist
[2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:37.000]  eating little kids and stuff yes so does does does that everywhere when the Lord
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:40.360]  showed me this thing I've traveled the world and everywhere I went I have met
[2:39:40.360 --> 2:39:43.960]  them so it's not just that they are drinking blood to have the fountain of
[2:39:43.960 --> 2:39:47.960]  use they actually need it for survival just like vampires because they are not
[2:39:47.960 --> 2:39:51.720]  human doing something we need to realize that some of these CEOs in the
[2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:55.280]  hospitals that don't want patients to be treated they want to intubate people and
[2:39:55.280 --> 2:39:59.640]  kill them they are not human they want to drink the blood listen listen that
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:03.200]  sounds pretty far out but it's in the Bible but let me say this we do know
[2:40:03.200 --> 2:40:07.200]  that hospitals are following orders to not give people vitamin C and vitamin D
[2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:11.040]  to not give them intervening as vitamin C the FBI SWAT teaming doctors that do
[2:40:11.040 --> 2:40:14.240]  it even though it totally works so they are trying to keep treatments away and
[2:40:14.240 --> 2:40:18.360]  are trying to kill people yes they're trying to kill people and they are blood
[2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:23.320]  drinkers and we have to see it's time for us to stop all the fluff and realize
[2:40:23.320 --> 2:40:27.040]  we're living in the twilight zone and get deep and spiritual you know you know
[2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:31.400]  I mean I was looking at Fauci on the radio the other day on TV and they put
[2:40:31.400 --> 2:40:34.800]  his face up and I said he's a blood drinker it just came out of me I was
[2:40:34.800 --> 2:40:39.680]  like what is that man I just my soul told me blood drinker yes he sounds like a
[2:40:39.680 --> 2:40:44.640]  legend most of them so I'm trying to say humanity we have to wake up you know
[2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:48.880]  why the locked up churches because when churches get together we assemble
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:53.320]  together the resurrected Christ comes among us the anointing comes and that
[2:40:53.320 --> 2:40:57.400]  anointing breaks that cloak of darkness so if they lock churches up and stop us
[2:40:57.400 --> 2:41:01.320]  from gathering together put us in a house so that we can pray individually we
[2:41:01.320 --> 2:41:05.560]  are not one would chase a thousand two would chase ten thousand so they want
[2:41:05.560 --> 2:41:08.800]  us to they want they don't want us to be around each other so that we don't we're
[2:41:08.800 --> 2:41:12.840]  not able to fight this battle it's only the church that can fight this battle and
[2:41:12.840 --> 2:41:15.480]  if the church is locked up and the church is not praying and people are not
[2:41:15.480 --> 2:41:19.440]  praying then what do we do do something so these are blood drinkers I'm not gonna
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:23.880]  means what's anymore and I'm not gonna wait well it has turned out that the
[2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:28.720]  royal family all of them get blood transfusions of children wake up humanity
[2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:34.400]  we have to wake by the way it was an associated press in like nineteen like
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:42.160]  nineteen what was that year like 1990 something it was an AP that Al Gore was
[2:41:42.160 --> 2:41:46.680]  getting off Air Force two and a refrigerator fell open full of bags of
[2:41:46.680 --> 2:41:51.840]  blood and it said oh he just takes them with him for for transfusions I mean
[2:41:51.840 --> 2:41:56.920]  people are weird yeah not they're not weird Alex they are not human and they
[2:41:56.920 --> 2:42:01.240]  need blood like vampires to survive the world has to hear this it is in the
[2:42:01.240 --> 2:42:06.680]  Bible is in Daniel 242 it is Revelation 13 they are not human and they want to
[2:42:06.680 --> 2:42:11.200]  they want to destroy us they cause wars the Bible says in the book of Nehom
[2:42:11.200 --> 2:42:15.680]  Nehom chapter 3 say war to the bloody city is all full of lies and robbery
[2:42:15.680 --> 2:42:19.040]  because of the whoredom of the well-favoured hallowed that you know
[2:42:19.040 --> 2:42:22.720]  causes nations to be destroyed you know something they want people to be
[2:42:22.720 --> 2:42:26.360]  destroyed they want people to die on the streets because they love to drink they
[2:42:26.360 --> 2:42:31.280]  are not human and humanity has to wake up because the church has to wake up and
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:37.400]  deal with me Bill Gates is not human it is through our five senses that we are
[2:42:37.400 --> 2:42:42.400]  kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only way to see
[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:46.800]  through this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated
[2:42:46.800 --> 2:42:51.680]  water is a big problem consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals
[2:42:51.680 --> 2:42:56.440]  around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions natural functions
[2:42:56.440 --> 2:43:00.880]  which have been known for millennia the Hindu chakras align with the endocrine
[2:43:00.880 --> 2:43:05.400]  system the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:10.000]  described as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:14.680]  higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality
[2:43:14.680 --> 2:43:20.200]  fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy our

[2:43:24.880 --> 2:43:29.760]  fluoride free and the propure shower head will seal the deal get them both

[2:46:37.560 --> 2:46:42.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:46:42.960 --> 2:46:55.680]  All right I want to get Dr. Stella Emanuel back on soon because I've seen her
[2:46:55.680 --> 2:46:58.960]  do speeches on treatments and the thousands of patients he's had as an MD
[2:46:58.960 --> 2:47:02.440]  that's very important but I think it's important to get her perspective on
[2:47:02.440 --> 2:47:08.160]  this because people that have discernment and I see a lot of the
[2:47:08.160 --> 2:47:11.280]  things she's talking about and I see the globalist making statements how they're
[2:47:11.280 --> 2:47:15.680]  gonna merge the machines and take over our children and take over our bodies so
[2:47:15.680 --> 2:47:19.920]  is she spiritually seeing the future and then overlaying it over what's
[2:47:19.920 --> 2:47:24.280]  happening now or is it already worse than we think and already going on but I
[2:47:24.280 --> 2:47:29.880]  know the Senate won't outlaw human animal clones I know I told people about I
[2:47:29.880 --> 2:47:35.120]  had the CEO of a company working with the US Army on 25 years ago who had part
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:39.240]  goat part spider creatures supplying body armor for the Pentagon people thought
[2:47:39.240 --> 2:47:43.760]  it was a fake interview like five years later it was on CBS News but still people
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:48.400]  think I made that up so yeah we got part spider part goats we've got there's
[2:47:48.400 --> 2:47:52.080]  also I mean the the Chinese for 20 years have cows that produce a hundred
[2:47:52.080 --> 2:47:57.400]  percent pure pure human milk with with with the clone genes of a particular
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:02.320]  Chinese woman that produced lots of milk people don't believe me look it up I
[2:48:02.320 --> 2:48:06.400]  mean we're not in Kansas anymore we're kind of in a frozen technological level
[2:48:06.400 --> 2:48:09.400]  we're given phones that track us and things that control us they've got
[2:48:09.400 --> 2:48:14.160]  cures basically everything and they are bringing in this seductive system where
[2:48:14.160 --> 2:48:18.080]  we merge with machines and are given the false idea of immortality which is a
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:23.000]  lie she's totally right so as crazy as this all sounds whether she's picking up
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:28.200]  on this psychically you know discernment to the Holy Spirit in the future or
[2:48:28.200 --> 2:48:33.120]  whether it's actually happening now and a lot of it is that's how crazy this is
[2:48:33.120 --> 2:48:38.440]  so doc I want to put some bookends on that and just move forward with other
[2:48:38.440 --> 2:48:42.800]  points here's an example I was looking at the interview I did yesterday with
[2:48:42.800 --> 2:48:49.120]  Dr. McCullough it was very powerful and Luke 86 said and I hear the salade he
[2:48:49.120 --> 2:48:52.600]  says I'm done with Alex it's been nine years and I'm done with him the virus
[2:48:52.600 --> 2:48:56.640]  doesn't exist and now he's pushing the Delta BS time and time again he has
[2:48:56.640 --> 2:49:01.000]  shown and he still keeps pushing the virus narrative Alex is not fixing
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:05.880]  anything he is mudding the waters of truth he has changed since Trump what
[2:49:05.880 --> 2:49:12.760]  has happened to him okay let's just stop last year I saw car wrecks gunshot wounds
[2:49:12.760 --> 2:49:17.360]  people dying of the flu calling it Delta I knew doctors I knew scientists I
[2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:20.880]  talked to him we went to hospitals they were empty I have family that are
[2:49:20.880 --> 2:49:24.320]  doctors I have family their nurses they say they're totally overwhelmed my dad
[2:49:24.320 --> 2:49:28.040]  almost died my mom almost died I thought like a gorilla was on my chest I
[2:49:28.040 --> 2:49:31.960]  vermectin and hydroxychloric and in the steroids helped me knocked it right out
[2:49:31.960 --> 2:49:37.120]  I mean most our office has had this and some of them have been out three to four
[2:49:37.120 --> 2:49:43.640]  weeks okay so I go off my own observations Dr. McCullough says it came
[2:49:43.640 --> 2:49:47.440]  from the mutation of the vaccines in India that's what they they say they
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:52.840]  admit these vaccines don't work but the idea that there's not prions being
[2:49:52.840 --> 2:49:56.720]  sprayed in the air looks like Texas and Florida were hit first I know a lot of
[2:49:56.720 --> 2:49:59.920]  experts are gonna say names they don't want it out this time but people that
[2:49:59.920 --> 2:50:03.480]  headed up US intelligence agencies believe that they're spraying synthetic
[2:50:03.480 --> 2:50:08.520]  prions on people probably true America's under attack I don't have all the
[2:50:08.520 --> 2:50:13.760]  answers I just know that I've never seen some of these folks I know sick for
[2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:17.200]  three weeks coughing up blood so dr. let me ask you this you said it's crazy in
[2:50:17.200 --> 2:50:22.200]  Houston worse than ever we trust you you you're a real doctor real person what
[2:50:22.200 --> 2:50:28.400]  can you say you see what his name is Luke 88 or 86 Luke 86 what can you say to
[2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:33.840]  him I mean are you seeing more patients are you seeing big problems yeah I was
[2:50:33.840 --> 2:50:37.200]  seeing a lot of patients were seeing both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients
[2:50:37.200 --> 2:50:41.840]  that are sick and they are very sick so whether you're vaccinated or unvaccinated
[2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:44.520]  you need to go on hydroxychloric and you're gonna have a match you need to go
[2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:49.200]  on prevention we're probably seeing about 30% vaccinated that are sick and
[2:50:49.200 --> 2:50:53.880]  about 70% unvaccinated but this is because of the variant which probably
[2:50:53.880 --> 2:50:58.640]  came from a subpar vaccine but what happens when the winter heats and the
[2:50:58.640 --> 2:51:02.720]  wild virus shows up a lot of people are gonna get sick so don't wait till that
[2:51:02.720 --> 2:51:06.200]  time we're seeing a lot of patients I mean we're so swamped Alex went from a
[2:51:06.200 --> 2:51:10.520]  hundred patients a day to seven hundred patients a day in like a week we were
[2:51:10.520 --> 2:51:15.520]  barely sleeping we work all day according to Luke 86 well Luke should go to a
[2:51:15.520 --> 2:51:19.080]  damn hospital because I wouldn't check them out they're all full basically so
[2:51:19.080 --> 2:51:23.360]  you want to explain to Luke what's really going on while he rebukes us I mean
[2:51:23.360 --> 2:51:26.680]  people are sick people are sick because I don't know what they blew up in Texas
[2:51:26.680 --> 2:51:30.920]  like you said you know we work all day we work all day and we fight all night and
[2:51:30.920 --> 2:51:34.400]  we basically don't sleep that's what we do so people are calling me from hospital
[2:51:34.400 --> 2:51:38.320]  come and take my people out of the hospital people are calling me from you
[2:51:38.320 --> 2:51:41.800]  know people are coming to my clinic if you see I mean there's a picture of my
[2:51:41.800 --> 2:51:45.560]  clinic will people sitting lined up sitting in chairs lined up as if they
[2:51:45.560 --> 2:51:50.560]  are going to Black Friday just sitting on a psychosomatic I mean I'm sitting here
[2:51:50.560 --> 2:51:54.360]  until three months ago saying it was basically super exaggerated and BS but
[2:51:54.360 --> 2:51:59.200]  now I mean it's serious and people need to know and preventively protect
[2:51:59.200 --> 2:52:04.080]  themselves yes they've blown something in the air it is serious you know it's
[2:52:04.080 --> 2:52:08.640]  not a fluke people are getting sick and I just believe that I mean whoever said a
[2:52:08.640 --> 2:52:11.960]  virus in the in the summer Alex have you ever seen a respiratory virus in the
[2:52:11.960 --> 2:52:18.280]  summer no this is not right this is crazy nobody sees a respiratory see what I
[2:52:18.280 --> 2:52:21.400]  talk about things you put them on Dr. Mano you're very intense I've been a
[2:52:21.400 --> 2:52:26.440]  spiritual warrior I must I'm a trained spiritual listen listen I'm intense to I
[2:52:26.440 --> 2:52:29.840]  get it world government's being announced Australia says you can't leave
[2:52:29.840 --> 2:52:32.560]  your house if you haven't been vaccinated everybody should be upset
[2:52:32.560 --> 2:52:35.840]  that's what that's what creates free countries is people that aren't gonna be
[2:52:35.840 --> 2:52:41.560]  pushed around so we need to fight I mean I agree with you I'm gonna hold you
[2:52:41.560 --> 2:52:44.400]  over one more segment I'll get you back this on the medical stuff and what's
[2:52:44.400 --> 2:52:47.880]  happening but what do you make just in general of what they did to Trump
[2:52:47.880 --> 2:52:51.280]  where all because I know Trump's a good man but he got snookered into this
[2:52:51.280 --> 2:52:55.280]  supporting this vaccine to re-op the economy how do you think Trump needs to
[2:52:55.280 --> 2:52:58.600]  do I think he needs to come out against the vaccine and say it was like to I

[2:56:13.320 --> 2:56:18.280]  sick demon god and we have to reach out and realize that God created the
[2:56:18.280 --> 2:56:21.480]  universe but gave us free will and that's why we're being put through this
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:26.280]  test and her skype just cut out again folks as
[2:56:26.280 --> 2:56:29.480]  wild as the thing she was saying the globalists really think they're building
[2:56:29.480 --> 2:56:33.320]  this new species it's all really real I don't know if she's right that it's that
[2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:36.520]  far along now but who the hell knows anymore

[2:57:32.120 --> 2:57:35.720]  90 plus percent of the information was accurate and was damning and was
[2:57:35.720 --> 2:57:39.000]  groundbreaking a few poisoned pills a few pieces of
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:42.520]  disinfo were slipped in to try to discredit the whole thing
[2:57:42.520 --> 2:57:45.640]  folks i'm surprised the conference even happened
[2:57:45.640 --> 2:57:49.080]  they had infiltrators and others that really disrupted it and tried to shut
[2:57:49.080 --> 2:57:52.200]  it down because michael indell is over the target

[3:05:01.480 --> 3:05:04.680]  trilateral commission of the united nations the whole project of the ross
[3:05:04.680 --> 3:05:09.240]  shawls and the rock folks until 10 years ago the media said
[3:05:09.240 --> 3:05:12.600]  the control corporate media the bilberberg group didn't exist
[3:05:12.600 --> 3:05:15.960]  well now the bilberberg group is public in its former head
[3:05:15.960 --> 3:05:19.880]  shown the steering committee is claus schwaab and he has set up the great
[3:05:19.880 --> 3:05:23.480]  reset in global government and as a liberty movement
[3:05:23.480 --> 3:05:26.280]  worldwide we don't address the globalist head on
[3:05:26.280 --> 3:05:29.720]  about the second figure worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover we
[3:05:29.720 --> 3:05:45.640]  don't have a shot we do expose them we can beat them easily
[3:05:45.640 --> 3:06:03.560]  live from london england it's haul joseph watson with summit dot news
[3:06:06.680 --> 3:06:12.120]  i'm your back in summit news hour and i am back from holiday albeit a domestic
[3:06:12.120 --> 3:06:15.320]  holiday because you have to jump through 50 flaming hoops to
[3:06:15.320 --> 3:06:18.840]  leave the country meanwhile as i'm going to talk about later the
[3:06:18.840 --> 3:06:22.280]  australian prime minister while his citizens are locked down
[3:06:22.280 --> 3:06:27.800]  permanently he's flying from cambera to sydney to see his family australians
[3:06:27.800 --> 3:06:31.160]  meanwhile are being told that they're not even allowed to engage in
[3:06:31.160 --> 3:06:36.120]  conversations with each other now of course here in the uk we've had
[3:06:36.120 --> 3:06:40.120]  four lockdowns at the latest count because they're so successful we have to
[3:06:40.120 --> 3:06:44.440]  keep having them over and over again the vaccine is so successful
[3:06:44.440 --> 3:06:49.960]  we were told that we're going to vaccinate our way out of the pandemic
[3:06:49.960 --> 3:06:56.840]  well here we are nine months later 80 of the adult population has had
[3:06:56.840 --> 3:07:02.440]  both doses of the clock shot 90 of the population will have had it by
[3:07:02.440 --> 3:07:07.000]  october and yet still yesterday's reporting suggests
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:12.120]  that the uk government is preparing for another lockdown in october
[3:07:12.120 --> 3:07:16.600]  because the vaccines worked so well
[3:07:16.600 --> 3:07:19.800]  uk government already preparing for another lockdown in october is the
[3:07:19.800 --> 3:07:23.400]  headline this is from i news it says the
[3:07:23.400 --> 3:07:27.800]  member of the government's scientific advisory group for emergency sage
[3:07:27.800 --> 3:07:31.880]  who routinely put out ridiculous numbers that never come to fruition
[3:07:31.880 --> 3:07:35.160]  they're proven spectacularly wrong time and time again but everyone still
[3:07:35.160 --> 3:07:38.840]  listens to them for no reason whatsoever
[3:07:38.840 --> 3:07:43.480]  so the uk is about to enter an extended peak of infections and hospitalizations
[3:07:43.480 --> 3:07:47.720]  which are in danger of pushing the nhs beyond breaking point
[3:07:47.720 --> 3:07:50.200]  and could force the government to reintroduce restrictions over the
[3:07:50.200 --> 3:07:53.160]  school half-term period at the end of next month
[3:07:53.160 --> 3:07:57.240]  so they've got the kids going back to school as of a week ago
[3:07:57.240 --> 3:08:00.680]  teachers parents being told to test them on a regular basis
[3:08:00.680 --> 3:08:04.760]  they've got the university students going back to uni here in a couple of
[3:08:04.760 --> 3:08:08.840]  weeks time so they're going to be provided with
[3:08:08.840 --> 3:08:12.680]  enough justification enough positive tests because they're going to
[3:08:12.680 --> 3:08:17.000]  rejig reinitiate the mass testing to create the panic
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:21.720]  the hysterical drum beat two forces to accept another lockdown by having
[3:08:21.720 --> 3:08:25.160]  all those students despite the fact that the vast majority of them don't even
[3:08:25.160 --> 3:08:27.480]  have any symptoms but if they test positive
[3:08:27.480 --> 3:08:31.480]  they can add that to the official positive infection toll and scare
[3:08:31.480 --> 3:08:35.800]  everybody once again and of course we were told
[3:08:35.800 --> 3:08:39.400]  over the past six months that the vaccines were crucial
[3:08:39.400 --> 3:08:46.280]  because they stopped hospitalization influx we were told that the vaccines
[3:08:46.280 --> 3:08:51.400]  even though they don't work you can still carry the virus pass on the virus
[3:08:51.400 --> 3:08:54.680]  if you've had both doses of the vaccine and there's another example of that
[3:08:54.680 --> 3:08:58.600]  that i'm going to get into they don't really work but we were
[3:08:58.600 --> 3:09:02.520]  assured we were promised that the vaccines
[3:09:02.520 --> 3:09:08.280]  reduce severe symptoms of covid and drastically reduce deaths and
[3:09:08.280 --> 3:09:13.160]  hospitalizations okay fair enough we were told that that the vaccines
[3:09:13.160 --> 3:09:18.520]  severely reduce severe symptoms reduce serious covid hospitalizations and
[3:09:18.520 --> 3:09:22.520]  yet now we're being told after 80 of the adult
[3:09:22.520 --> 3:09:26.680]  population has been vaccinated which will be 90 in a couple of
[3:09:26.680 --> 3:09:29.960]  months time that we need another lockdown
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:33.960]  because we're going to get a ton of hospitalizations
[3:09:33.960 --> 3:09:39.080]  that the NHS won't be able to cope with so the very reason
[3:09:39.080 --> 3:09:42.360]  for the government promoting vaccination scheme for everyone
[3:09:42.360 --> 3:09:45.800]  reduce the chance of death reduce hospitalizations
[3:09:45.800 --> 3:09:50.440]  reduce pressure on the NHS now they're saying all that's going to be in play
[3:09:50.440 --> 3:09:55.080]  once again here in a month's time and that that's the reason why we will need
[3:09:55.080 --> 3:09:58.600]  to lock down again kind of suggest to you
[3:09:58.600 --> 3:10:02.280]  that this has stopped being about public health that this has stopped being
[3:10:02.280 --> 3:10:08.920]  about following the science and it's weaponization of population
[3:10:08.920 --> 3:10:14.760]  control it's about conformity mass conformity and even when the masses do
[3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:18.920]  conform to the degree of 90 doing what they're told
[3:10:18.920 --> 3:10:22.360]  no that's not enough even if you're vaccinated
[3:10:22.360 --> 3:10:26.440]  you have to keep the masks on you have to prove
[3:10:26.440 --> 3:10:31.000]  that you have been vaccinated to get into a nightclub
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:34.200]  to get into a theater to get into a football match which is what's going to
[3:10:34.200 --> 3:10:37.640]  be unrolled at the end of this month of course with vaccine
[3:10:37.640 --> 3:10:41.480]  passports notoriously unpopular in Germany and the
[3:10:41.480 --> 3:10:44.520]  Netherlands in France where there are mass protests mass riots where the
[3:10:44.520 --> 3:10:48.120]  businesses in France in Paris the cafes the restaurants the bars
[3:10:48.120 --> 3:10:52.040]  aren't even enforcing vaccine passports aren't even checking them that was all
[3:10:52.040 --> 3:10:54.600]  public relations hoax right at the start of it
[3:10:54.600 --> 3:10:58.360]  when they had those police officers checking people's medical papers so they
[3:10:58.360 --> 3:11:01.880]  could have a cup of coffee they're not really enforcing it
[3:11:01.880 --> 3:11:05.720]  we were promised that these vaccine passports would never be introduced
[3:11:05.720 --> 3:11:09.560]  and the same government the same people in our promising us
[3:11:09.560 --> 3:11:13.320]  that the october lockdown is not going to happen because
[3:11:13.320 --> 3:11:17.880]  you can trust them can't you and again on that subject
[3:11:17.880 --> 3:11:21.640]  they're now saying that to get into a nightclub this is how they tried to
[3:11:21.640 --> 3:11:24.440]  bully and intimidate young people into taking the vaccine
[3:11:24.440 --> 3:11:28.360]  didn't really work because the number of vaccine
[3:11:28.360 --> 3:11:33.000]  acceptance rates reached a plateau and kind of tailed off from there they
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:36.840]  haven't really increased that in the past few weeks or months
[3:11:36.840 --> 3:11:39.800]  they were told they would need to take the vaccine to get into a nightclub
[3:11:39.800 --> 3:11:43.160]  a third of under 40s in the united kingdom
[3:11:43.160 --> 3:11:48.120]  haven't taken one dose of the clock shot the coronavirus vaccine
[3:11:48.120 --> 3:11:51.800]  and that figure doesn't really seem to be budging
[3:11:51.800 --> 3:11:55.320]  and yet they're still going ahead with this vaccine passport scheme
[3:11:55.320 --> 3:11:59.400]  as i pointed out many times the net profit margin of nightclubs
[3:11:59.400 --> 3:12:02.760]  in the united kingdom and pubs and other similar businesses
[3:12:02.760 --> 3:12:07.880]  is 15 so you have a third of people who are most likely
[3:12:07.880 --> 3:12:11.880]  to patronize those venues pubs theaters nightclubs
[3:12:11.880 --> 3:12:15.880]  having not taken the vaccine they're not going to be allowed in
[3:12:15.880 --> 3:12:20.520]  so the entire industry is going to collapse and indeed hospitality
[3:12:20.520 --> 3:12:25.320]  insiders have asserted that once again over the past few days
[3:12:25.320 --> 3:12:28.440]  the most ludicrous aspect of this of course is that they're now
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:33.960]  eliminating the option to provide proof of negative
[3:12:33.960 --> 3:12:38.120]  covid status either through proving you have the antibodies
[3:12:38.120 --> 3:12:42.840]  which as we know are 13 times uh offer 13 times more protection than the
[3:12:42.840 --> 3:12:46.200]  vaccine itself or if you can prove that you've had
[3:12:46.200 --> 3:12:50.040]  a negative test so they're completely happy to allow
[3:12:50.040 --> 3:12:54.440]  vaccinated people into nightclubs if they can prove they had the vaccine
[3:12:54.440 --> 3:12:58.200]  despite telling us that people who've had the vaccine
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:02.200]  can still carry and pass on the virus but if you can prove
[3:13:02.200 --> 3:13:05.720]  that you're negative of covid you don't have the virus at all
[3:13:05.720 --> 3:13:10.280]  which of course is more safe than potentially having the virus but just
[3:13:10.280 --> 3:13:14.120]  saying you've got the vaccine no those people who can prove
[3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:17.960]  they don't have the virus aren't going to be allowed into the nightclubs
[3:13:17.960 --> 3:13:21.880]  but the people who can prove they've been vaccinated but can't prove they
[3:13:21.880 --> 3:13:25.400]  don't have the virus because the vaccines don't work properly
[3:13:25.400 --> 3:13:29.160]  they'll be allowed into the nightclub and they'll be allowed potentially to
[3:13:29.160 --> 3:13:32.920]  spread the virus again kind of suggests to you that this is not
[3:13:32.920 --> 3:13:36.920]  about following the science and that this is not about public
[3:13:36.920 --> 3:13:40.760]  health it's about mass conformity it's about the
[3:13:40.760 --> 3:13:46.760]  weaponization of vaccines as a tool of population control
[3:13:46.760 --> 3:13:49.560]  and by the way the masks are coming back as well but of course we're not
[3:13:49.560 --> 3:13:52.440]  supposed to believe any of this because the government today has assured us
[3:13:52.440 --> 3:13:55.080]  that they have no plans to introduce lockdown in
[3:13:55.080 --> 3:13:59.240]  october having assured us back in december they had no plans to introduce
[3:13:59.240 --> 3:14:04.040]  vaccine passports now they're being rolled out as we speak
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:08.360]  and we see a similar thing with masks Boris Johnson is also believed to be
[3:14:08.360 --> 3:14:11.880]  prepared to reintroduce mask wearing and social distancing
[3:14:11.880 --> 3:14:16.120]  inside public spaces and on transport as early as this month in a move designed
[3:14:16.120 --> 3:14:19.560]  to stem hospital admissions that we were told would
[3:14:19.560 --> 3:14:23.160]  basically tail off to nothing because the vaccine's so great
[3:14:23.160 --> 3:14:28.920]  and prevent the uk's fourth lockdown so the masks which we know from the only
[3:14:28.920 --> 3:14:33.800]  peer-reviewed mass testing studies the dan mask study in particular
[3:14:33.800 --> 3:14:39.640]  don't work the virus is a thousand times smaller than those blue surgical masks
[3:14:39.640 --> 3:14:42.280]  than the holes in them it passes right through
[3:14:42.280 --> 3:14:45.320]  they're going to go ahead and reintroduce them anyway my parents are
[3:14:45.320 --> 3:14:48.680]  visiting from spain and they say that even though the law has been lifted that
[3:14:48.680 --> 3:14:52.680]  you have to wear face masks outside in spain
[3:14:52.680 --> 3:14:59.400]  in blistering 35 degree summer heat celsius people are still
[3:14:59.400 --> 3:15:05.720]  wearing the face masks even outside in spain one of the hottest countries in
[3:15:05.720 --> 3:15:10.280]  europe at the peak of summer so once they get this in
[3:15:10.280 --> 3:15:14.280]  it's very hard to get rid of it and now they're talking about reintroducing
[3:15:14.280 --> 3:15:18.760]  all these mask mandates all these coronavirus restrictions
[3:15:18.760 --> 3:15:22.840]  in october again the story came out the public rebelled against it now they're
[3:15:22.840 --> 3:15:25.880]  denying that it's happening and you can trust them because they've been so
[3:15:25.880 --> 3:15:30.120]  honest to every point haven't they so if you don't use we'll be back don't go away

[3:18:30.760 --> 3:18:33.800]  Gerald in South Carolina go ahead you're on the air trying to move quicker
[3:18:33.800 --> 3:18:37.320]  hey Alex welcome would like to say first off thanks for being the
[3:18:37.320 --> 3:18:40.200]  voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity
[3:18:40.200 --> 3:18:43.480]  wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay
[3:18:43.480 --> 3:18:47.400]  i'm a double amputee and i have bacteria
[3:18:47.400 --> 3:18:51.640]  infection on my lung that'll never go away uh living defense saved my life
[3:18:51.640 --> 3:18:55.800]  they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me
[3:18:55.800 --> 3:19:00.120]  living defense brought me back i wanted to just quote from the bible
[3:19:00.120 --> 3:19:03.080]  jesus is saying as to where we are right now
[3:19:03.080 --> 3:19:08.200]  this is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be
[3:19:08.200 --> 3:19:13.960]  afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my
[3:19:13.960 --> 3:19:17.400]  name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall
[3:19:17.400 --> 3:19:20.520]  betray one another and shall hate one another that's
[3:19:20.520 --> 3:19:24.520]  right where we're at brother and that's because god's name is on the founding of
[3:19:24.520 --> 3:19:28.040]  this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because
[3:19:28.040 --> 3:19:34.360]  god created this country you're listening to the
[3:19:34.360 --> 3:19:37.640]  alex jones show
[3:19:44.120 --> 3:19:50.600]  transmitting worldwide from the summit dot new studios in the united kingdom
[3:19:50.600 --> 3:19:56.520]  you are listening to paul joseph watson
[3:19:56.520 --> 3:20:01.720]  so again back in march 2020 we were told by our esteemed government that we
[3:20:01.720 --> 3:20:05.160]  needed to lockdown for just three weeks to flatten the curve
[3:20:05.160 --> 3:20:09.320]  and protect the nhs the nhs should be protecting us
[3:20:09.320 --> 3:20:13.160]  but it's apparently more concerned with his writing blog posts on its official
[3:20:13.160 --> 3:20:16.520]  website about how bad white people are we're gonna gonna get to that in the
[3:20:16.520 --> 3:20:20.040]  next segment we were told that we needed a
[3:20:20.040 --> 3:20:24.520]  firebreak back in october 2020 to save christmas
[3:20:24.520 --> 3:20:28.760]  we had that then we had another six months of lockdown after that we were
[3:20:28.760 --> 3:20:32.760]  told that we would get to enjoy freedom day on june 21st
[3:20:32.760 --> 3:20:37.240]  that got delayed by another three three weeks we were told on july 19th that
[3:20:37.240 --> 3:20:41.480]  that was freedom day but that was the last lockdown that we were on a process
[3:20:41.480 --> 3:20:44.600]  that couldn't be reversed and yet now official
[3:20:44.600 --> 3:20:47.640]  sounds coming out of west minster suggest that we're going to have yet
[3:20:47.640 --> 3:20:51.480]  another lockdown once again oh but they've denied it like they denied every
[3:20:51.480 --> 3:20:55.640]  other lockdown in the past like they denied the vaccine passports
[3:20:55.640 --> 3:20:59.160]  would be rolled out at the same time that they were funding corporations to
[3:20:59.160 --> 3:21:03.640]  create those vaccine passports and we were told of course that we could
[3:21:03.640 --> 3:21:07.480]  vaccinate our way out of this pandemic well 80 percent of the adult
[3:21:07.480 --> 3:21:11.160]  population has to be vaccinated 90 percent will be by
[3:21:11.160 --> 3:21:14.760]  october the end of october they're now trying to give the
[3:21:14.760 --> 3:21:18.040]  vaccine to 12 year old kids who don't even need
[3:21:18.040 --> 3:21:22.440]  parental permission to get the vaccine we were told that we would
[3:21:22.440 --> 3:21:26.600]  have to go outside and just applaud the NHS bow down and worship the
[3:21:26.600 --> 3:21:30.920]  sanctified great institution that is there to protect us and which is
[3:21:30.920 --> 3:21:34.120]  completely failed by their own score to protect us
[3:21:34.120 --> 3:21:37.480]  we were told that the vaccine prevented severe symptoms
[3:21:37.480 --> 3:21:43.000]  and reduced hospitalizations to the level that the NHS could cope with them
[3:21:43.000 --> 3:21:46.840]  but now they're saying the exact opposite there are too many hospitalizations
[3:21:46.840 --> 3:21:53.160]  and if this covid death toll increases by five times over the next
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:57.160]  six weeks which these esteemed sage directors
[3:21:57.160 --> 3:22:00.360]  advisors are telling us that it's likely to do
[3:22:00.360 --> 3:22:05.080]  that we will need to lock down once again despite the fact that 95 percent of
[3:22:05.080 --> 3:22:10.120]  the population will have antibodies and then there's the question of
[3:22:10.120 --> 3:22:14.280]  NHS bed spaces itself will they be able to cope
[3:22:14.280 --> 3:22:18.280]  with the influx of new hospitalizations there's an article here by
[3:22:18.280 --> 3:22:21.880]  andrew lilico out of the telegraph
[3:22:21.960 --> 3:22:26.840]  headline there can be no justification whatsoever for an october lockdown
[3:22:26.840 --> 3:22:30.840]  and he points out the situation he says there are about 800 hospitalizations
[3:22:30.840 --> 3:22:36.680]  per day in england that's as of right now that compares with around 1600
[3:22:36.680 --> 3:22:41.080]  hospitals in england as a whole and an average of roughly 100
[3:22:41.080 --> 3:22:44.600]  beds per hospital so at present there is less than one
[3:22:44.600 --> 3:22:49.160]  hospitalization per day per hospital occurring
[3:22:49.160 --> 3:22:52.200]  for covid so these hospitals are apparently
[3:22:52.200 --> 3:22:55.240]  apparently over the next few weeks at least going to be on the verge of being
[3:22:55.240 --> 3:22:59.000]  overwhelmed when they've literally got one person being
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:03.800]  hospitalized for covid taking up one bed in these hospitals
[3:23:03.800 --> 3:23:06.920]  it goes on to write that did not swamp the NHS this summer
[3:23:06.920 --> 3:23:10.520]  neither did it come anywhere close to doing so
[3:23:10.520 --> 3:23:15.880]  and he goes on to talk about spare bed capacity which should be able to handle
[3:23:15.880 --> 3:23:19.960]  any increase even up to five times the current level
[3:23:19.960 --> 3:23:24.280]  of course we had the infamous nightingale hospitals built a cost of
[3:23:24.280 --> 3:23:26.920]  millions of millions of pounds to the taxpayer
[3:23:26.920 --> 3:23:30.760]  which even at the height of the pandemic during the first lockdown
[3:23:30.760 --> 3:23:37.160]  were barely if at all used we saw the viral videos which were quickly banned
[3:23:37.160 --> 3:23:41.080]  on social media sites of people visiting these hospitals visiting these
[3:23:41.080 --> 3:23:44.520]  covid wards showing that they were almost completely
[3:23:44.520 --> 3:23:48.680]  empty some good news on this front though
[3:23:48.680 --> 3:23:52.440]  with the vaccine passports ticket sales flatlining as a rebellion against
[3:23:52.440 --> 3:23:55.960]  vaccine passports grows ticket sales for events in the
[3:23:55.960 --> 3:24:00.040]  uk that could require vaccine passports are flatlining according to industry
[3:24:00.040 --> 3:24:02.680]  insiders as the rebellion against the owner of
[3:24:02.680 --> 3:24:06.680]  system grows from the end of the month people seeking to enter a
[3:24:06.680 --> 3:24:10.120]  nightclub in the uk will have to prove they've been double jabbed as I talked
[3:24:10.120 --> 3:24:13.720]  about in the previous segment proof of a negative test will no
[3:24:13.720 --> 3:24:17.000]  longer be accepted despite the fact that the vaccinated
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:21.640]  people can still carry and pass on the virus if you don't have the virus you
[3:24:21.640 --> 3:24:27.400]  can't pass it on you're not infectious but you're not allowed into the nightclub
[3:24:27.400 --> 3:24:31.400]  the people who have complied submitted caved
[3:24:31.400 --> 3:24:34.600]  and had the clock shot they're allowed into the nightclub
[3:24:34.600 --> 3:24:38.040]  because they conform this is not about public health
[3:24:38.040 --> 3:24:41.320]  this is not about following the science it's about
[3:24:41.320 --> 3:24:46.360]  mass compliance and conformity and I go on to explain how
[3:24:46.360 --> 3:24:49.240]  the profit margin of nightclubs is 15 percent
[3:24:49.240 --> 3:24:53.720]  you get 25 percent of young adults in the uk remaining unvaccinated
[3:24:53.720 --> 3:24:57.240]  and that's from the ages of 18 to 29 the people
[3:24:57.240 --> 3:25:00.280]  overwhelmingly likely to go into the nightclubs
[3:25:00.280 --> 3:25:05.000]  they're going to lose 25 percent of their customer base they're going to go out of
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:07.560]  business but now they're also talking about
[3:25:07.560 --> 3:25:11.240]  using this vaccine passport system to apply to
[3:25:11.240 --> 3:25:15.640]  western theaters the larger ones have higher capacity
[3:25:15.640 --> 3:25:20.840]  than 500 people which is the number that they're putting on as a limit
[3:25:20.840 --> 3:25:25.800]  for enforcing these vaccine passports so k nickles the chief executive of
[3:25:25.800 --> 3:25:29.160]  hospital to uk pointed out quote there is a significant
[3:25:29.160 --> 3:25:33.400]  proportion of people who don't want to use passports or are not vaccinated it
[3:25:33.400 --> 3:25:37.000]  settled at 20 in france works back something similar
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:41.880]  here in the uk she noted that with the industry already struggling
[3:25:41.880 --> 3:25:44.600]  as a result of lockdowns the administrative costs combined with the
[3:25:44.600 --> 3:25:48.440]  loss of income as a result of those customers staying away
[3:25:48.440 --> 3:25:52.680]  will deliver quote a further nail in the coffin
[3:25:52.680 --> 3:25:57.080]  of returning for many venues and then you have michael kill of the nighttime
[3:25:57.080 --> 3:26:00.440]  industries association pointing out through the records that they've
[3:26:00.440 --> 3:26:04.840]  studied over the past few weeks or so ticket sales for events at the end of
[3:26:04.840 --> 3:26:09.240]  september and beyond are already quote flatlining
[3:26:09.240 --> 3:26:12.200]  he says we're seeing a lot of pushback from people who don't want to come and
[3:26:12.200 --> 3:26:15.960]  have to show their health status on entry now again whether it's going to be
[3:26:15.960 --> 3:26:20.200]  enforced or not is another matter but the very prospect of it
[3:26:20.200 --> 3:26:25.320]  potentially being enforced when 25 percent of people aged 18 to 29 in the
[3:26:25.320 --> 3:26:28.600]  united kingdom have not been vaccinated won't be able to prove it
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:33.080]  one third of under 40s haven't been vaccinated won't be able to prove it
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:37.560]  that is a massive slice of their profit margin and it's one that they can't
[3:26:37.560 --> 3:26:42.760]  afford they will go bust meanwhile plans to
[3:26:42.760 --> 3:26:46.840]  introduce the passports are also going ahead despite israel
[3:26:46.840 --> 3:26:50.200]  which was the first major country to launch a similar scheme
[3:26:50.200 --> 3:26:56.600]  now experiencing the highest coveted wave out of any major nation as we've
[3:26:56.600 --> 3:26:59.800]  covered before so again their vaccine
[3:26:59.800 --> 3:27:03.640]  rollout was so successful and then their introduction of the vaccine passport
[3:27:03.640 --> 3:27:08.040]  scheme was so successful that now they're experiencing a wave which is
[3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:14.920]  worse than any other major country because the vaccines work so well
[3:27:14.920 --> 3:27:18.680]  so that's the good news that people are still rebelling in enough numbers to make
[3:27:18.680 --> 3:27:23.320]  this economically unviable for many businesses theaters nightclubs
[3:27:23.320 --> 3:27:27.480]  particularly so they're going to file lawsuits against the government there's
[3:27:27.480 --> 3:27:29.800]  apparently going to be big resistance against that
[3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:32.840]  whether it comes to fruition remains to be seen
[3:27:32.840 --> 3:27:37.480]  of course we had Andrew Lloyd Webber before the extension of
[3:27:37.480 --> 3:27:41.160]  Freedom Day of course which was supposed to happen on June 21st then they
[3:27:41.160 --> 3:27:44.520]  delayed it for three more weeks he threatened to open up
[3:27:44.520 --> 3:27:48.440]  anyway and said that he would be prepared to be arrested by the police
[3:27:48.440 --> 3:27:53.720]  for opening his theaters then he became part of a government scheme where they
[3:27:53.720 --> 3:27:57.240]  allowed him to become part of the pilot program and he backed away from that so
[3:27:57.240 --> 3:28:00.840]  it remains to be seen whether these hospitality insiders and theater
[3:28:00.840 --> 3:28:05.000]  owners will actually back up their words with solid
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:08.280]  action and actually file lawsuits against the government
[3:28:08.280 --> 3:28:12.760]  and resist and rebel against this vaccine passport tyranny
[3:28:12.760 --> 3:28:16.040]  remember the vaccine passport is the digital ID
[3:28:16.040 --> 3:28:20.440]  the digital ID is the chinese communist style social credit score
[3:28:20.440 --> 3:28:24.360]  it starts at not being allowed into a nightclub it ends at not being allowed
[3:28:24.360 --> 3:28:27.880]  to purchase food some of the dot news will be backed up
[3:28:27.880 --> 3:28:30.840]  going you know listeners call into the show and they thank me
[3:28:30.840 --> 3:28:36.200]  and it makes me feel pathetic because i sit there and i beg you for support
[3:28:36.200 --> 3:28:39.640]  constantly for prayer for financial support
[3:28:39.640 --> 3:28:43.480]  and for word of mouth and then we're all this together and i you know it gets
[3:28:43.480 --> 3:28:46.520]  told having to come to you and say hey i got great products please bomb or we
[3:28:46.520 --> 3:28:49.800]  won't be here on air but it's true we're the only media organization in the
[3:28:49.800 --> 3:28:52.360]  united states that promotes liberty at this level
[3:28:52.360 --> 3:28:56.040]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost
[3:28:56.040 --> 3:28:58.600]  shut down everybody else they crippled all the other groups
[3:28:58.600 --> 3:29:02.680]  and we're still here and as this whole new world order comes out in the open
[3:29:02.680 --> 3:29:05.720]  our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be taken off there that's
[3:29:05.720 --> 3:29:08.920]  why america has got to be taken down you can't have all these other nations
[3:29:08.920 --> 3:29:13.400]  enslaved and america still quasi free you can't have info wars has been
[3:29:13.400 --> 3:29:17.160]  proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold
[3:29:17.160 --> 3:29:20.600]  because if you think stuff's bad now just get ready so thank you all
[3:29:20.600 --> 3:29:23.960]  and get an info wars store dot com get some great 2020 election shirts

[3:29:26.840 --> 3:29:30.680]  info we're thanking i've been fighting as hard as i can for
[3:29:30.680 --> 3:29:34.680]  almost 28 years against the globalist i wanted to stop
[3:29:34.680 --> 3:29:39.320]  their agenda i wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[3:29:39.320 --> 3:29:43.800]  before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake
[3:29:43.800 --> 3:29:47.000]  yes we're not getting caught flat-footed but they are going
[3:29:47.000 --> 3:29:50.680]  ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[3:29:50.680 --> 3:29:53.560]  great reset and that's why it's more important than ever
[3:29:53.560 --> 3:29:57.560]  than all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[3:29:57.560 --> 3:30:00.520]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth
[3:30:00.520 --> 3:30:03.720]  so we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda
[3:30:03.720 --> 3:30:06.680]  and we've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one
[3:30:06.680 --> 3:30:09.880]  things to do is high quality storeable food we've got the best food ready to
[3:30:09.880 --> 3:30:13.560]  ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com so
[3:30:13.560 --> 3:30:17.160]  whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets

[3:30:28.600 --> 3:30:33.720]  the world is awakening the world is beginning to understand the globalist
[3:30:33.720 --> 3:30:36.680]  paradigm they are discovering the globalist
[3:30:36.680 --> 3:30:40.600]  the elites the manipulation the cfr the trilateral commission
[3:30:40.600 --> 3:30:45.800]  the Bilderberg group the bohemian grove the club of Rome
[3:30:45.800 --> 3:30:49.640]  and so even though it seems like the globalists are winning
[3:30:49.640 --> 3:30:52.760]  the truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack
[3:30:52.760 --> 3:30:57.320]  human freedom because they're actually losing we have forced them
[3:30:57.320 --> 3:31:01.480]  out in the open so as bad as these times are a lot of negative things are
[3:31:01.480 --> 3:31:05.000]  about to happen realize humanity is winning you've got a
[3:31:05.000 --> 3:31:08.680]  trust in the plan of god and trust in the plan of god's
[3:31:08.680 --> 3:31:14.360]  justice that is invincible that is ethereal timeless and unstoppable
[3:31:14.360 --> 3:31:18.520]  so don't trust in man trust in god to lead god and director soul
[3:31:18.520 --> 3:31:21.560]  and then take action against the globalists and realize you've got my
[3:31:21.560 --> 3:31:25.960]  commitment from alex jones and my crew to you we will never back down from the
[3:31:25.960 --> 3:31:29.960]  globalists and we will never surrender
[3:31:29.960 --> 3:31:35.480]  this headline is not a joke this is america in
[3:31:35.480 --> 3:31:41.480]  september of 2020 tc court sends man to jail
[3:31:41.480 --> 3:31:48.360]  for watching conspiracy theory videos online yes it says the police did a
[3:31:48.360 --> 3:31:55.800]  spot check for quote compliance at his home and found him in his garage
[3:31:55.800 --> 3:32:00.280]  watching rumble social media site which they say
[3:32:00.280 --> 3:32:04.120]  is a conspiracy site also he admitted to watching
[3:32:04.120 --> 3:32:08.200]  michael indel's three-day cyber symposium
[3:32:08.200 --> 3:32:12.280]  yes it was part of the conditions of his bail the judge said he could not
[3:32:12.280 --> 3:32:16.040]  look at any videos questioning the election
[3:32:16.040 --> 3:32:20.520]  no joke and so they sent the stars into his house and caught him doing it
[3:32:20.520 --> 3:32:24.840]  so now he's going into solidary confinement communism has come to america
[3:32:24.840 --> 3:32:29.800]  the republic has fallen
[3:32:31.880 --> 3:32:35.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:32:41.000 --> 3:32:44.520]  you're listening to the summit dot news radio hour
[3:32:44.520 --> 3:32:49.800]  with paul joseph watson
[3:32:50.280 --> 3:32:54.200]  well as part of the reintroduction of covid restrictions potentially happening
[3:32:54.200 --> 3:32:56.920]  here in the uk over the next couple of months
[3:32:56.920 --> 3:33:01.320]  they're talking about reimposing travel restrictions of course the current
[3:33:01.320 --> 3:33:04.840]  situation is still in place where if you visit a
[3:33:04.840 --> 3:33:08.440]  ambilist country which is on the government's ambilist
[3:33:08.440 --> 3:33:11.640]  when you return to the uk if you haven't been vaccinated you have to
[3:33:11.640 --> 3:33:15.880]  basically put yourself under house arrest you have to say multiple
[3:33:15.880 --> 3:33:20.840]  pcr covid test to prove that you don't have the virus before you're allowed to
[3:33:20.840 --> 3:33:24.760]  live your life one group of people who aren't
[3:33:24.760 --> 3:33:29.000]  forced to take pcr covid tests when they arrive in the united kingdom
[3:33:29.000 --> 3:33:32.680]  are illegal migrants coming from france on
[3:33:32.680 --> 3:33:37.240]  dingy than boats because of course british people are now second class
[3:33:37.240 --> 3:33:41.640]  citizens migrants are a superior class that we allow into the country
[3:33:41.640 --> 3:33:45.080]  despite the fact that after we did so the previous time
[3:33:45.080 --> 3:33:49.800]  following the fall of libya following the refugee crisis in 2015 we saw
[3:33:49.800 --> 3:33:54.120]  many of these migrants carry out mass casualty terror attacks like the paris
[3:33:54.120 --> 3:33:57.800]  massacre and of course the manchester arena
[3:33:57.800 --> 3:34:01.320]  bombing we're going to get into on the other side what
[3:34:01.320 --> 3:34:06.040]  germany is currently experiencing with their continued fallout from the last
[3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:10.280]  influx of migrants but we're going to set the table here with the video
[3:34:10.280 --> 3:34:14.440]  which is about the fall of afghanistan of course the takeover of afghanistan by
[3:34:14.440 --> 3:34:16.680]  the taliban and how that is threatening
[3:34:16.680 --> 3:34:22.280]  to cause a new influx of quote refugees who are really economic migrants
[3:34:22.280 --> 3:34:26.200]  into the west we're going to play this video now and come back and talk about
[3:34:26.200 --> 3:34:33.800]  the latest developments here it is
[3:34:33.800 --> 3:34:38.040]  taliban takeover of afghanistan means that europe is now facing the risk of
[3:34:38.040 --> 3:34:43.080]  another refugee influx how it started how it ended this has brought the
[3:34:43.080 --> 3:34:47.880]  hashtag refugees welcome crowd out in full force once again
[3:34:47.880 --> 3:34:53.000]  because it went so well the first time seems to be overwhelmingly young men
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:34:56.840]  don't see many women or children but i suppose they're all doctors or lawyers
[3:34:56.840 --> 3:35:00.360]  in waiting so why should we concern ourselves humanitarian
[3:35:00.360 --> 3:35:03.800]  development worker sible schnaharger told german
[3:35:03.800 --> 3:35:09.320]  wdr television on sunday quote we can assume that up to three
[3:35:09.320 --> 3:35:14.440]  million afghans will make their way to europe in the foreseeable future well
[3:35:14.440 --> 3:35:18.600]  what's another three million get ready to see european cities put up more
[3:35:18.600 --> 3:35:24.120]  refugees welcome posters as stones throw away from diversity barriers get ready
[3:35:24.120 --> 3:35:29.080]  to be culturally enriched but once again the facts contradict the narrative
[3:35:29.080 --> 3:35:33.800]  afghanistan will probably be more stable under the taliban than it has during
[3:35:33.800 --> 3:35:39.560]  any time in the past 20 years most of the afghan population welcomes the taliban
[3:35:39.560 --> 3:35:46.040]  takeover and it's over the war's over this situation isn't comparable to syria
[3:35:46.040 --> 3:35:50.360]  and yeah there are a relatively small number of people who worked for the us
[3:35:50.360 --> 3:35:55.240]  in afghanistan whose lives are under threat they're genuine refugees but
[3:35:55.240 --> 3:36:00.920]  three million people they're not refugees they're economic migrants as
[3:36:00.920 --> 3:36:04.840]  taliban spokesman sahail shaheen told sky news
[3:36:04.840 --> 3:36:08.520]  most of the people who are leaving afghanistan are not doing so because they
[3:36:08.520 --> 3:36:12.600]  feel unsafe they're doing it because afghanistan is a poor
[3:36:12.600 --> 3:36:16.840]  country everyone wants to live afghanistan
[3:36:16.840 --> 3:36:21.560]  because afghanistan is a poor country up to 70 person of the people are living
[3:36:21.560 --> 3:36:25.400]  under a poverty line the vast majority of people fleeing afghanistan
[3:36:25.400 --> 3:36:29.800]  are not refugees they're economic migrants that's why they want to go to
[3:36:29.800 --> 3:36:33.240]  germany and the uk and not saudi arabia
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:37.960]  despite saudi arabia being the first safe haven again going back to the works
[3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:43.160]  of the humanitarian worker sebel schna harga quote i always ask people
[3:36:43.160 --> 3:36:46.760]  why don't you go to saudi arabia they are muslims
[3:36:46.760 --> 3:36:50.360]  this is your culture the answer is always no
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:55.080]  germany is better gee i wonder why saudi arabia puts them up in remote
[3:36:55.080 --> 3:36:59.240]  rudimentary refugee tent cities with one communal toilet
[3:36:59.240 --> 3:37:04.280]  the uk and germany put them up in four star hotels and give them free money
[3:37:04.280 --> 3:37:07.640]  that's why they want to come here and personally i don't blame them for wanting
[3:37:07.640 --> 3:37:11.400]  to come here but that's not the issue the issue is we tried this
[3:37:11.400 --> 3:37:15.960]  already back in 2015 and it was an unmitigated disaster with a
[3:37:15.960 --> 3:37:19.800]  likely runoff election against anti mass migration populist marine
[3:37:19.800 --> 3:37:23.240]  lapin coming up next year even globalist stuge
[3:37:23.240 --> 3:37:27.480]  immanuel macron is worried the french president is calling for a robust
[3:37:27.480 --> 3:37:31.720]  plan to quote protect against significant irregular migratory flows
[3:37:31.720 --> 3:37:36.440]  from afghanistan the vast majority of migrants on violent criminals or
[3:37:36.440 --> 3:37:40.280]  terrorists but too many of them are for europe to
[3:37:40.280 --> 3:37:45.560]  put its people at risk again pols show 39 of afghan support
[3:37:45.560 --> 3:37:50.600]  suicide bombings in defense of islam isis bragged about how it exploited the
[3:37:50.600 --> 3:37:55.160]  refugee wave to insert terror cells into europe there were then a multitude of
[3:37:55.160 --> 3:37:59.240]  terror attacks in europe carried out by isis adherents who were either
[3:37:59.240 --> 3:38:02.200]  refugees or asylum seekers the majority of the
[3:38:02.200 --> 3:38:06.600]  paris massacre terrorists entered europe via the refugee wave
[3:38:06.600 --> 3:38:12.360]  i think of 11-year-old ebra accoland torn limb from limb by the stock home
[3:38:12.360 --> 3:38:17.560]  truck terrorist a failed asylum seeker i think of french school teacher
[3:38:17.560 --> 3:38:21.800]  samuel patty beheaded by an islamist who was given
[3:38:21.800 --> 3:38:25.560]  refugee status i think of the woman beheaded near a church
[3:38:25.560 --> 3:38:29.160]  in niece by a tunisian who arrived in italy as a
[3:38:29.160 --> 3:38:33.240]  boat migrant i think of the 1200 women who were
[3:38:33.240 --> 3:38:37.480]  viciously sexually assaulted in one night in cologne
[3:38:37.480 --> 3:38:41.480]  on new year's eve 2015 the culprits were almost entirely
[3:38:41.480 --> 3:38:44.920]  north african or middle eastern men the majority
[3:38:44.920 --> 3:38:49.320]  were either asylum seekers illegal immigrants or refugees
[3:38:49.320 --> 3:38:53.480]  i think of the afghan asylum seeker who raped and murdered a teenage girl in
[3:38:53.480 --> 3:38:57.320]  germany before dumping her body in a river i think of the mentally
[3:38:57.320 --> 3:39:00.920]  disabled 11-year-old girl who was raped by an afghan refugee
[3:39:00.920 --> 3:39:04.840]  and this isn't even to mention the societal dislocation caused by the
[3:39:04.840 --> 3:39:09.160]  mass influx of foreign populations who have no desire to integrate or
[3:39:09.160 --> 3:39:12.200]  contribute the uk government has announced that afghan
[3:39:12.200 --> 3:39:17.080]  refugees will be allowed to enter the country without even needing to show a
[3:39:17.080 --> 3:39:21.800]  passport what could possibly go wrong the previous time the uk began
[3:39:21.800 --> 3:39:25.400]  rescuing asylum seekers from war-torn countries a royal
[3:39:25.400 --> 3:39:30.120]  navy picked up a refugee in libya called salman abadi he
[3:39:30.120 --> 3:39:33.240]  repaid them by blowing up a bunch of kids at the
[3:39:33.240 --> 3:39:36.920]  manchester arena yeah you'd have thought we'd learned our lesson by
[3:39:36.920 --> 3:39:41.800]  now polls show that 99 of afghan support sharia law
[3:39:41.800 --> 3:39:45.080]  good well send them to other middle eastern countries where they'll fit in
[3:39:45.080 --> 3:39:48.600]  europe is full the uk is full we already have record
[3:39:48.600 --> 3:39:53.160]  numbers of boat migrants arriving anyway some of whom just rock up on beaches
[3:39:53.160 --> 3:39:57.320]  in dingies and run into the nearest town we don't even know who these people
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:00.920]  are and now we're just gonna let in thousands more without even checking
[3:40:00.920 --> 3:40:03.960]  their identity meanwhile i'm gonna have to show my
[3:40:03.960 --> 3:40:08.680]  id and vaccine passport to go to a football match in my own country
[3:40:08.680 --> 3:40:13.160]  no enough is enough if these people are genuine refugees
[3:40:13.160 --> 3:40:17.160]  send them to other middle eastern countries because europe has already
[3:40:17.160 --> 3:40:22.680]  tried experimenting with mass economic migration from these areas of the world
[3:40:22.680 --> 3:40:29.080]  and the consequences were horrendous
[3:40:33.400 --> 3:40:37.160]  now of course this problem is being exacerbated by the Taliban's takeover
[3:40:37.160 --> 3:40:40.760]  of afghanistan you had almost a thousand of these
[3:40:40.760 --> 3:40:45.080]  quote refugees arriving over the past few days on the south coast of england
[3:40:45.080 --> 3:40:49.400]  due to the nice weather that we've been having over the past few days
[3:40:49.400 --> 3:40:52.440]  and again no checks whatsoever the british government has openly said
[3:40:52.440 --> 3:40:55.320]  they're not even going to check the passports of afghans they could just
[3:40:55.320 --> 3:40:58.520]  say they're afghans there could be anyone coming into the country
[3:40:58.520 --> 3:41:02.040]  who have this history of massive terror attacks carried out by these quote
[3:41:02.040 --> 3:41:07.000]  refugees exploiting that influx now we have this headline
[3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:11.240]  experts warn isis k planning to exploit refugee wave to send terrorists to the
[3:41:11.240 --> 3:41:13.720]  west don't forget that isis in their own
[3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:17.240]  black flags of rome manifesto back in 2015
[3:41:17.240 --> 3:41:21.720]  bragged about how they had exploited the refugee wave back in 2014 to 15
[3:41:21.720 --> 3:41:25.480]  to insert literal jihadists that carried out the paris massacre
[3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:28.840]  into europe now experts warning the isis k is
[3:41:28.840 --> 3:41:32.920]  preparing to exploit the refugee wave created by the Taliban to do the same
[3:41:32.920 --> 3:41:38.600]  thing once again david otto came to terrorism expert
[3:41:38.600 --> 3:41:41.720]  said determined jihadists could still slip through the net and that there is
[3:41:41.720 --> 3:41:45.080]  little that's being done to protect europe from isis case leaper cells he
[3:41:45.080 --> 3:41:48.360]  said quote europe in the west are at high risk of terrorist attack from
[3:41:48.360 --> 3:41:52.280]  individuals who have sneaked themselves into the country posing as
[3:41:52.280 --> 3:41:55.800]  affiliated to the us of course with the biden
[3:41:55.800 --> 3:42:00.760]  administration funding that to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars
[3:42:00.760 --> 3:42:04.360]  dr jasmine muhammad also said dangerous persons may be subjected to
[3:42:04.360 --> 3:42:08.600]  supervision as we saw with the new zealand jihadist a few days ago they
[3:42:08.600 --> 3:42:11.000]  were watching him they couldn't even put him in prison
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:15.080]  before he went into stab six people but none of them will be imprisoned and
[3:42:15.080 --> 3:42:20.120]  residency status may remain temporary or limited so we're repeating the same
[3:42:20.120 --> 3:42:23.960]  disastrous mistake once again we'll be back to talk about it more on the other

[3:44:48.840 --> 3:44:52.200]  and so no one is addressing the fact this is a 21st century
[3:44:52.200 --> 3:44:56.760]  corporate economic war on the general population and the conversion of the
[3:44:56.760 --> 3:45:00.440]  planet into a high tech technocracy with a global
[3:45:00.440 --> 3:45:04.760]  i.b global medical system global medical control
[3:45:04.760 --> 3:45:08.520]  i.d and of course a carbon taxes that tied to that
[3:45:08.520 --> 3:45:13.080]  the tractor every movement this is their takeover they admitted it they've said
[3:45:13.080 --> 3:45:15.800]  it credo the prime minister canada's on tv
[3:45:15.800 --> 3:45:19.480]  yesterday saying this is an environmental takeover plan
[3:45:19.480 --> 3:45:22.920]  and the whole lockdowns of just talking to prepare for climate lockdowns
[3:45:22.920 --> 3:45:26.520]  so they're announcing their takeover we've got to resist it and say no
[3:45:26.520 --> 3:45:30.440]  just a week ago we got a new shipment of vitamin mineral fusion
[3:45:30.440 --> 3:45:34.120]  back in stock and it was only half of the order we wanted to get
[3:45:34.120 --> 3:45:37.720]  but because we won't cut corners on the quality of what goes into it
[3:45:37.720 --> 3:45:41.320]  the factory can only get limited supplies so again it was half the order we
[3:45:41.320 --> 3:45:44.520]  wanted but despite that i'm still offering it for 33

[3:46:27.960 --> 3:46:37.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:46:45.720 --> 3:46:55.560]  live from the summit dot news headquarters it's paul joseph watson
[3:46:55.560 --> 3:47:00.200]  so experts are warning that isis is planning to infiltrate the west once
[3:47:00.200 --> 3:47:04.520]  again with jihadists to carry out terror attacks via this afghan refugee
[3:47:04.520 --> 3:47:07.080]  wave the british government has come out last
[3:47:07.080 --> 3:47:10.520]  week and said they're not even going to check passports or identity papers
[3:47:10.520 --> 3:47:13.160]  mainly because many of these people don't have them
[3:47:13.160 --> 3:47:16.360]  when they're allowing these random people into the country we've seen the
[3:47:16.360 --> 3:47:20.520]  videos where they rock up on beaches and just run off into the local community
[3:47:20.520 --> 3:47:23.720]  no checks whatsoever these migrants don't face
[3:47:23.720 --> 3:47:27.480]  the same coronavirus PCR tests that brits
[3:47:27.480 --> 3:47:31.960]  returning to their own country do after they come back from holiday
[3:47:31.960 --> 3:47:35.640]  and of course we had the sordid history of what's happened before the
[3:47:35.640 --> 3:47:40.920]  manchester arena bomber salman abadi literally being rescued as a refugee by
[3:47:40.920 --> 3:47:44.360]  the british royal navy from libya after the disastrous
[3:47:44.360 --> 3:47:48.840]  invasion of that country going on to blow himself up along with
[3:47:48.840 --> 3:47:56.120]  25 people dead many of them children during that concert in 2017
[3:47:56.120 --> 3:48:01.240]  you have a thousand migrants arriving on beaches on the south coast of england
[3:48:01.240 --> 3:48:06.600]  yesterday alone the numbers are 600 700 800 up to a thousand every single day we
[3:48:06.600 --> 3:48:11.720]  don't know who these people are but the media consistently laboriously
[3:48:11.720 --> 3:48:16.280]  tunnel vision focuses on oh there was a baby
[3:48:16.280 --> 3:48:20.440]  you read a sky news report about these migrant arrivals on the south coast
[3:48:20.440 --> 3:48:24.600]  literally almost every paragraph is oh we saw a baby
[3:48:24.600 --> 3:48:29.240]  we saw a child we saw a toddler then you look at the actual pictures
[3:48:29.240 --> 3:48:35.720]  that weren't published in those news reports 95 plus young men
[3:48:35.720 --> 3:48:41.160]  fighting age men the likes of which have actually carried out jihadist attacks
[3:48:41.160 --> 3:48:44.520]  in the west and of course attendant to that is the
[3:48:44.520 --> 3:48:49.080]  soaring violent crime rates the mass sexual molestation events that we saw in
[3:48:49.080 --> 3:48:53.400]  places like cologne we're repeating this mistake as a continent
[3:48:53.400 --> 3:48:56.760]  once again and the likes of sky news are busy
[3:48:56.760 --> 3:49:02.040]  writing news reports with oh but there's a child in every other paragraph it's a
[3:49:02.040 --> 3:49:05.640]  complete scam but the consequences are
[3:49:05.640 --> 3:49:09.560]  very real we have this headline out of summit news today official crime
[3:49:09.560 --> 3:49:14.440]  status show foreigners and migrants responsible for nearly half of gang rapes
[3:49:14.440 --> 3:49:20.120]  in one german region alone again this was an afd releasing these statistics
[3:49:20.120 --> 3:49:24.680]  this wasn't some bigoted right wing neo-nazi group
[3:49:24.680 --> 3:49:28.760]  this was the official crime data released by dusseldorf's ministry of the
[3:49:28.760 --> 3:49:33.240]  interior and it's revealed that in the region of north rime west failure
[3:49:33.240 --> 3:49:37.800]  foreigners and migrants who represent around 14.8 percent of the population
[3:49:37.800 --> 3:49:43.000]  which is alarmingly high to begin with are responsible for almost half of
[3:49:43.000 --> 3:49:46.440]  recorded gang rape so diversity continues to be a
[3:49:46.440 --> 3:49:51.080]  strength in that region of germany if you look at germany
[3:49:51.080 --> 3:49:55.560]  as a nation the wider nationwide picture more than that
[3:49:55.560 --> 3:49:59.080]  are represented in gang rape so you have
[3:49:59.080 --> 3:50:03.320]  across the whole country according to official federal criminal police office
[3:50:03.320 --> 3:50:07.880]  bka stats foreigners comprising around half of rape suspects despite
[3:50:07.880 --> 3:50:11.880]  representing only 13.7 percent of the population
[3:50:11.880 --> 3:50:18.680]  in germany as a whole so again vastly over represented in sexual assaults
[3:50:18.680 --> 3:50:23.880]  in gang rapes this is the much wanted diversity culture
[3:50:23.880 --> 3:50:28.680]  that we're importing once again into the west oh but sky news says there was a
[3:50:28.680 --> 3:50:31.560]  toddler on one of these boats so i guess it's all worth it
[3:50:31.560 --> 3:50:35.080]  i guess we need to repeat the same mistake once again
[3:50:35.080 --> 3:50:38.920]  we also have this headline again out of germany
[3:50:38.920 --> 3:50:43.720]  over 80 of culprits responsible for looting after german floods were foreign
[3:50:43.720 --> 3:50:47.720]  migrants again diversity continues to be a strength
[3:50:47.720 --> 3:50:52.040]  the floods killed over 180 people and caused billions of dollars in property
[3:50:52.040 --> 3:50:55.400]  damage or billions of euros but the situation was
[3:50:55.400 --> 3:50:58.760]  worsened by criminal opportunists carrying out looting and robberies at
[3:50:58.760 --> 3:51:03.000]  miss a temporary breakdown in normal law and order they crunched the stats
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:07.000]  again after a demand for the figures to be released by the afd party but the
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:09.960]  figures themselves came from the german ministry
[3:51:09.960 --> 3:51:16.280]  of the interior and they found that 145 suspects between the ages of 12 and 69
[3:51:16.280 --> 3:51:20.280]  were identified 81 of those suspects that carried
[3:51:20.280 --> 3:51:24.200]  out looting and burglaries after the devastating floods in
[3:51:24.200 --> 3:51:30.920]  germany last month were foreign born or migrants or asylum seekers within that
[3:51:30.920 --> 3:51:36.440]  same group meanwhile in sweden afghan migrants gang
[3:51:36.440 --> 3:51:40.040]  rape mentally disabled swedish woman again bringing the wonderful
[3:51:40.040 --> 3:51:44.760]  virtues of their culture to our continent so let's just invite in
[3:51:44.760 --> 3:51:49.480]  hundreds of thousands more of them what could possibly go wrong
[3:51:49.480 --> 3:51:52.520]  now over in australia of course which has now been renamed
[3:51:52.520 --> 3:51:56.600]  prison island australian pm takes private jet
[3:51:56.600 --> 3:52:00.680]  fails to quarantine while citizens remain under lockdown
[3:52:00.680 --> 3:52:03.880]  while lockdown australians are being told they shouldn't even talk to their
[3:52:03.880 --> 3:52:08.040]  neighbors prime minister scott morrison reportedly took a private jet to visit
[3:52:08.040 --> 3:52:11.320]  his family in sydney and then failed to quarantine upon
[3:52:11.320 --> 3:52:16.840]  returning to canberra so he marked father's day by taking a private jet to
[3:52:16.840 --> 3:52:20.760]  visit his family meanwhile australians not only can't visit their
[3:52:20.760 --> 3:52:24.360]  own family they're being told that even if they wear masks and go to the
[3:52:24.360 --> 3:52:28.120]  supermarket they can't have a conversation
[3:52:28.120 --> 3:52:34.440]  with each other we also have this australian authorities to lock out
[3:52:34.440 --> 3:52:37.800]  those are the words of the premier in the state of victoria
[3:52:37.800 --> 3:52:43.480]  to lock out unvaccinated people from being able to participate in the economy
[3:52:43.480 --> 3:52:47.240]  and we flash back to that passage out of revelations once again
[3:52:47.240 --> 3:52:51.160]  don't we he who doesn't have the mark won't be allowed to buy or sell well
[3:52:51.160 --> 3:52:54.920]  that's the road that we're headed towards in australia of course
[3:52:54.920 --> 3:52:59.160]  a country that's imposed probably the most brutal draconian lockdown in all
[3:52:59.160 --> 3:53:02.280]  developed nations now announcing they will lock out
[3:53:02.280 --> 3:53:05.880]  unvaccinated people from being able to participate in the economy
[3:53:05.880 --> 3:53:10.120]  it starts with not being able to travel it starts with being placed under
[3:53:10.120 --> 3:53:13.720]  onerous house arrest it starts with not being able to
[3:53:13.720 --> 3:53:18.200]  engage in basic social activities and then the ultimate course for the
[3:53:18.200 --> 3:53:21.480]  chinese communist style social credit score is of course
[3:53:21.480 --> 3:53:25.960]  not being able to buy or sell you've seen it in china
[3:53:25.960 --> 3:53:30.360]  you buy too much junk food you buy you rent too many video games
[3:53:30.360 --> 3:53:35.960]  you buy quote junk food they limit your purchases they put you on a red list so
[3:53:35.960 --> 3:53:38.520]  you can't get credit you can't get a mortgage
[3:53:38.520 --> 3:53:42.360]  you can't buy a plane ticket you can't buy a train ticket
[3:53:42.360 --> 3:53:45.560]  you are the underclass and that same
[3:53:45.560 --> 3:53:49.880]  orwellian nightmare black mirror dystopia
[3:53:49.880 --> 3:53:55.640]  is now being rolled out in australia the premier of victoria dan andrews said
[3:53:55.640 --> 3:53:59.160]  there is going to be a vaccinated economy and you get to participate in
[3:53:59.160 --> 3:54:02.920]  that if you are vaccinated yes if you've had the clock shot that doesn't even
[3:54:02.920 --> 3:54:07.080]  work if you've complied and being a good boy or girl
[3:54:07.080 --> 3:54:10.120]  the government will allow you to buy things
[3:54:10.120 --> 3:54:12.840]  but he said we're going to move to a situation where to protect the health
[3:54:12.840 --> 3:54:16.600]  system we are going to lock out people who are not vaccinated
[3:54:16.600 --> 3:54:20.280]  and can be so they're literally making noises now that
[3:54:20.280 --> 3:54:23.640]  it's not just you're not going to be allowed into a cinema or a football game
[3:54:23.640 --> 3:54:27.720]  you're not going to be allowed into a supermarket
[3:54:27.720 --> 3:54:31.160]  meanwhile dr kerry chan over in new south wales
[3:54:31.160 --> 3:54:34.760]  which is the region in which sydney is located in australia said
[3:54:34.760 --> 3:54:38.440]  this was the woman the stern faced health
[3:54:38.440 --> 3:54:42.120]  zah who previously told australians they shouldn't even be allowed to talk their
[3:54:42.120 --> 3:54:45.080]  own friends and neighbors now she says covet will be with us
[3:54:45.080 --> 3:54:50.040]  forever and people will have to get used to get used to that's a quote
[3:54:50.040 --> 3:54:54.440]  endless booster vaccines so having two shots
[3:54:54.440 --> 3:54:57.720]  of the clock shot is not going to be enough you're going to have to get three
[3:54:57.720 --> 3:55:02.280]  four five six israeli saying now every six months you're going to have to take
[3:55:02.280 --> 3:55:06.840]  this vaccine no matter the consequences no matter the
[3:55:06.840 --> 3:55:09.960]  pregnant women having complications with their pregnancies
[3:55:09.960 --> 3:55:13.000]  their menstrual cycles being set off completely
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:18.120]  of course we've had numerous instances in japan over the past few days of people
[3:55:18.120 --> 3:55:22.440]  dying after taking the astrazeneca vaccine
[3:55:22.440 --> 3:55:25.640]  that's not enough you're going to have to take seven or eight vaccines
[3:55:25.640 --> 3:55:29.800]  over the next four or five years she said people will have to get used to
[3:55:29.800 --> 3:55:33.640]  taking endless booster vaccines which is somewhat of a concern given the
[3:55:33.640 --> 3:55:37.240]  authorities in australia have also said as we reported last month
[3:55:37.240 --> 3:55:41.000]  they're going to go they wouldn't hesitate to go door to door to carry out
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:44.200]  covid tests well what's going to stop them from carrying out
[3:55:44.200 --> 3:55:47.880]  mandatory clock shots door to door they're now saying
[3:55:47.880 --> 3:55:52.840]  booster jabs is the future same thing in israel which gave
[3:55:52.840 --> 3:55:56.520]  antony facti of course a million dollar reward
[3:55:56.520 --> 3:56:00.600]  now israel is lobbying the biden administration to roll out
[3:56:00.600 --> 3:56:05.000]  that booster shot despite the fact that there's a revolt within the fda
[3:56:05.000 --> 3:56:08.920]  from principal people would you believe it within the fda saying that it's too
[3:56:08.920 --> 3:56:13.080]  soon they don't know the risks but biden's trying to get that rolled out
[3:56:13.080 --> 3:56:17.560]  before the end of the month meanwhile also in australia
[3:56:17.560 --> 3:56:21.320]  australia could force citizens to report their location on demand via government
[3:56:21.320 --> 3:56:24.360]  tracking app they're actually talking about having previously
[3:56:24.360 --> 3:56:28.040]  considered don't forget fitting people in self-isolation with
[3:56:28.040 --> 3:56:32.520]  electronic ankle bracelets prison island
[3:56:32.520 --> 3:56:36.120]  now they're talking about a new system which is the
[3:56:36.120 --> 3:56:39.160]  track and trace on steroids where you will have to
[3:56:39.160 --> 3:56:42.920]  report your location to the government they'll phone you up and within 15
[3:56:42.920 --> 3:56:46.760]  minutes of the government phoning you up you will have to take a selfie
[3:56:46.760 --> 3:56:50.920]  which will be geolocation tagged upload it to a government website
[3:56:50.920 --> 3:56:54.920]  to prove that you're a compliant well behaved submissive
[3:56:54.920 --> 3:56:59.080]  citizen and this is why they're calling australia
[3:56:59.080 --> 3:57:02.600]  prison island and everything they do unless we resist this
[3:57:02.600 --> 3:57:06.200]  is coming to the united kingdom is coming to america
[3:57:06.200 --> 3:57:09.560]  i'm just going to wrap it up war room is coming up next summit dot news
