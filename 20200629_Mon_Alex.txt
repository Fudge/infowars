[00:00.000 --> 00:12.860]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:12.860 --> 00:17.580]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:17.580 --> 00:22.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, June 29th, the year is 2020, we're being told by the
[00:22.460 --> 00:23.460]  Deep State.
[00:23.460 --> 00:27.460]  Every major corporate news outlet that we've got to cancel before the July because of a
[00:27.460 --> 00:34.360]  surge of coronavirus cases, but not a surge of deaths.
[00:34.360 --> 00:41.280]  It's all a giant criminal hoax, but there are little poisonous Easter eggs that we've
[00:41.280 --> 00:45.120]  discovered and documented that are now confirmed in the coronavirus.
[00:45.120 --> 00:47.960]  There's many chapters to this Deep State move.
[00:47.960 --> 00:54.360]  We're going to be laying it all out here today, but America is now officially in civil war.
[00:54.360 --> 00:57.880]  We've been telling you for years, the left is going to engineer this for the breakdown
[00:57.880 --> 01:00.760]  of the society, the UN is at the heart of that.
[01:00.760 --> 01:03.480]  We knew it would happen because we've been reading their battle plans and they had the
[01:03.480 --> 01:07.680]  New York Times and Washington Post and CNN and Nightline, St. Jones is insane.
[01:07.680 --> 01:12.680]  There's no plan for a leftist race war uprising, but now it's all official and I'll be laying
[01:12.680 --> 01:17.360]  it out coming up the next segment because if we deny that we're already in a civil war
[01:17.360 --> 01:21.280]  and we don't face that the enemy has a real chance of winning, they could win.
[01:21.280 --> 01:25.880]  If we face the horror and face the bad news, that is the good news because we can defeat
[01:25.880 --> 01:27.080]  them.
[01:27.080 --> 01:31.280]  Here's a little bit of the excerpts that are posted in full at Bandod video of myself,
[01:31.280 --> 01:37.320]  Owen Schreuer, and I'd say 500 amazing people that came out in defiance of tyranny against
[01:37.320 --> 01:42.480]  the whole cult of the mask garbage, which was demonized nationally and in the local paper
[01:42.480 --> 01:43.640]  is horrible people.
[01:43.640 --> 01:49.080]  But meanwhile, gay and lesbian rallies from England to Chicago were praised with hundreds
[01:49.080 --> 01:51.960]  of thousands out the streets as the best thing on earth.
[01:51.960 --> 01:57.440]  The very same newscast within cut to people protesting the mask and say we are murderers.
[01:57.440 --> 01:58.440]  You see, that doesn't make sense.
[01:58.440 --> 01:59.440]  It's war on logic.
[01:59.440 --> 02:00.440]  It is a war on logic.
[02:00.440 --> 02:01.440]  Here's some of the excerpts.
[02:01.440 --> 02:06.440]  The New World Order is a cult of making you weak and making you believe you need them
[02:06.440 --> 02:10.960]  so they can run your life and stop killing you and we're here to tell the globalist we're
[02:10.960 --> 02:11.960]  not your slaves.
[02:11.960 --> 02:20.960]  We're not in this cult and if you want war, do better believe you've got war.
[02:20.960 --> 02:26.200]  We've had Democrat riots and protests in this city and they never stopped them from
[02:26.200 --> 02:27.200]  doing that.
[02:27.200 --> 02:34.200]  Why are they stopping us from being free citizens?
[02:34.200 --> 02:38.200]  Scientifically, the mask stops nothing.
[02:38.200 --> 02:44.200]  We will not be slaves to this government.
[02:44.200 --> 02:47.200]  We refuse to face masks.
[02:47.200 --> 02:50.200]  God bless America.
[02:50.200 --> 02:54.200]  Let's get this march started.
[02:54.200 --> 02:56.200]  There you are!
[02:56.200 --> 02:57.200]  Yeah!
[02:57.200 --> 02:58.200]  Happy Holidays!
[02:58.200 --> 02:59.200]  Happy Holidays!
[02:59.200 --> 03:00.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:00.200 --> 03:01.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:01.200 --> 03:02.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:02.200 --> 03:03.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:03.200 --> 03:04.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:04.200 --> 03:05.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:05.200 --> 03:06.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:06.200 --> 03:07.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:07.200 --> 03:08.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:08.200 --> 03:09.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:09.200 --> 03:10.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:10.200 --> 03:11.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:11.200 --> 03:12.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:12.200 --> 03:31.200]  Happy Holidays!
[03:31.200 --> 03:36.400]  Why? Democrat protests are allowed to loot and burn businesses to the ground.
[03:36.400 --> 03:38.800]  They shut down 35 here regularly.
[03:38.800 --> 03:42.700]  They go out in front of police station and they're told to stand down when they burn down a flag.
[03:42.700 --> 03:46.400]  And we can't even peacefully march to the sense of our capitol building
[03:46.400 --> 03:49.600]  without having the governor call out the National Guard on us.
[03:49.600 --> 03:51.200]  What is that?
[03:51.200 --> 03:54.000]  So, I'll be honest with you folks,
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.500]  part of me wants to break these barriers down and march to the capitol
[03:57.500 --> 03:59.700]  and we'll just call it a Black Lives Matter protest.
[03:59.700 --> 04:01.800]  How about that?
[04:01.800 --> 04:03.500]  Because then I guess you're allowed to do it.
[04:03.500 --> 04:06.300]  So guys, if we declare this a Black Lives Matter protest
[04:06.300 --> 04:08.700]  are we allowed to climb up there and go to the cal?
[04:08.700 --> 04:12.800]  You can go down and shut down Highway 35 anytime you want.
[04:12.800 --> 04:16.600]  You can go down and burn things and put a moniker on the street.
[04:16.600 --> 04:20.800]  Nobody says anything, but we come here and we're peaceful and law-abiding citizens
[04:20.800 --> 04:22.700]  and we don't have rights.
[04:22.700 --> 04:24.800]  I'll tell you what, it may not be today,
[04:24.800 --> 04:30.100]  but today will come when we say we've had enough.
[04:30.100 --> 04:33.700]  In Jesus' name, we pray, amen.
[04:33.700 --> 04:38.000]  Folks, there is two hours of amazing footage at Band-Aid video.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.500]  It's got hundreds of thousands of views, but millions need to see this
[04:40.500 --> 04:42.600]  so it triggers others to go out and take action.
[04:42.600 --> 04:45.500]  So again, please go to Band-Aid video and get those amazing videos
[04:45.500 --> 04:46.700]  and get them out to folks.
[04:46.700 --> 04:49.600]  All right, I've got an emergency message to the president about the Civil War.
[04:49.600 --> 04:54.500]  We're already in on the other side and we're going to have some special guests today
[04:54.500 --> 04:55.100]  and a lot more.
[04:55.100 --> 05:25.000]  I'll just leave it at that and a huge guest tomorrow.
[05:25.500 --> 05:30.000]  Allow us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals
[05:30.000 --> 05:36.200]  from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into the ultimate spray formula.
[05:36.200 --> 05:41.000]  Iodine is an essential mineral that helps support thyroid health,
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.100]  healthy metabolism, and healthy cognitive function.
[05:45.100 --> 05:52.700]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 spray for 33% off-intro pricing at infowarstore.com.
[05:52.700 --> 05:57.700]  That's Survival Shield X2 spray at infowarstore.com.
[06:23.700 --> 06:27.700]  I have been commissioned by the American people to take action,
[06:27.700 --> 06:31.700]  and we have stood with you and you've stood with us and we've changed the world together.
[06:31.700 --> 06:37.700]  But I want you to know that I salute all of you across the planet who stand with liberty
[06:37.700 --> 06:40.700]  and who help carry the ball of truth forward.
[06:40.700 --> 06:44.700]  You spread the word about the articles, the videos, the live reports, everything we do
[06:44.700 --> 06:49.700]  at infowars.com, newswars.com, and of course Band-Aid video.
[06:49.700 --> 06:54.700]  And the great site Paul has, summit.news, and David Knight's launching a site,
[06:54.700 --> 06:59.700]  and Troyer's launching a site with their own independent sites as infowars
[06:59.700 --> 07:02.700]  that test the sizes in the globalist view.
[07:03.700 --> 07:13.700]  So, let me go ahead and go to an emergency report directly to the president of the United States.
[07:13.700 --> 07:15.700]  We are in civil war.
[07:15.700 --> 07:19.700]  Now, you notice three years ago, two years ago, a year ago, even six months ago,
[07:19.700 --> 07:23.700]  Jones is insane, Brian Stelter said on reliable sources.
[07:23.700 --> 07:28.700]  Nightline said I was insane. CNN shows said I was insane.
[07:28.700 --> 07:31.700]  Dateline said I was insane.
[07:31.700 --> 07:35.700]  Every major so-called news channel said Jones is dangerous.
[07:35.700 --> 07:39.700]  He claims there's a plan for civil war based on race war.
[07:39.700 --> 07:44.700]  And he's warning Trump, try to stop anti-fun, declare them terrorists, and go after Soros.
[07:44.700 --> 07:55.700]  And then, if you remember, the head of judicial watch went on Fox and said the same thing,
[07:55.700 --> 07:59.700]  and then Fox apologized for it and said we won't have him on for a while or he's banned.
[07:59.700 --> 08:04.700]  That's the big no-no, because they've been gearing up and preparing this.
[08:04.700 --> 08:06.700]  We even got their secret documents.
[08:06.700 --> 08:12.700]  So, if we live in denial about this, the globalists have a chance of winning here in the next 126 days.
[08:12.700 --> 08:15.700]  Here is my emergency report to the president.
[08:15.700 --> 08:18.700]  Destroy or be destroyed, Mr. President.
[08:18.700 --> 08:19.700]  Please share the link.
[08:19.700 --> 08:21.700]  It's at band.video. Here it is.
[08:21.700 --> 08:32.700]  COVID-19 is a globalist hoax from counting all deaths as COVID deaths to Fauci and the NIH's involvement with gain of function research in China.
[08:32.700 --> 08:36.700]  Fraudulent Bill Gates funded COVID death estimates.
[08:36.700 --> 08:52.700]  The Clinton Foundation's contact tracing agenda, nursing home murders, asymptomatic cases spiking with more testing, false positives, and mandatory masks that do nothing to protect us and only prepare us for more tyranny.
[08:52.700 --> 08:57.700]  President Trump, it is time to destroy the enemy or be destroyed.
[08:57.700 --> 09:04.700]  I've been all over the country and I talk to people again on the ground.
[09:04.700 --> 09:18.700]  And almost unanimously, they know that almost all of the people that died of shotgun wounds and car wrecks and cancer and pneumonia and the flu have been put in the COVID-19 column.
[09:18.700 --> 09:21.700]  That is incredibly outrageous.
[09:21.700 --> 09:23.700]  And it's just something that's a blip on the radar screen.
[09:23.700 --> 09:27.700]  Mr. President, you have to come out. You have to expose that.
[09:27.700 --> 09:35.700]  I know that you didn't realize that Bill Gates basically owns the NIH in Fauci and you thought surely the doctors wouldn't be political.
[09:35.700 --> 09:40.700]  But historically, there's some of the most political people out there with the corruption of Big Pharma.
[09:40.700 --> 09:44.700]  And from day one, Fauci and Gates have been financing the Wuhan lab.
[09:44.700 --> 09:51.700]  That's why the Pentagon tells you, oh, don't blame China, even though we know it came out of China, because it implicates the deep state.
[09:51.700 --> 09:54.700]  That's not your fault the deep state was in your administration.
[09:54.700 --> 09:59.700]  The American people can tell one from the other, you have to burn them.
[09:59.700 --> 10:02.700]  You have to come out and expose even newsweeks around the headline.
[10:02.700 --> 10:16.700]  Because it's true that Fauci ran most of the research at Wuhan, including weaponized coronavirus research in bats with gain of function transmission to humans.
[10:16.700 --> 10:25.700]  COVID-19 was estimated to kill 22 to 25 times more people than it actually did.
[10:25.700 --> 10:29.700]  In fact, some numbers, they were saying 50, 60, 100 times more were going to die.
[10:29.700 --> 10:37.700]  We were told 2.2 million, 2.5 million in all of these Bill Gates' financed operations, and now it's 110,000.
[10:37.700 --> 10:42.700]  And most of those are people they killed at nursing homes or people that died of something else they put in the column.
[10:42.700 --> 10:54.700]  In Event 201, hosted by Bill and Melinda Gates and John Hopkins University, they laid this all out in October and November of last year as a tabletop exercise for what they've now implemented.
[10:54.700 --> 10:56.700]  Yes, it's a real virus.
[10:56.700 --> 11:01.700]  Yes, it's patented and manmade so they can own all the medical responses to it.
[11:01.700 --> 11:06.700]  They could never patent a regular cold or flu virus before because it was natural.
[11:06.700 --> 11:14.700]  But now they've got something they can own and something they can force us to accept contact tracing and apps on our phones, everywhere we go.
[11:14.700 --> 11:29.700]  And of course, it's not just Bill and Melinda Gates, but the Clintons and their global initiative are on record running the program with Bill Gates, with Chelsea on the board, and Bill Clinton now promoting it, that they will be tracking everybody in America via these apps.
[11:29.700 --> 11:46.700]  They sent in 10 blue states people to nursing homes who had COVID-19, the flu, and other communicable viruses, and that's over half the Desi United States are in those nursing homes in blue cities and blue states.
[11:46.700 --> 11:51.700]  And when Cuomo got caught doing it and others, they came out and said that you advised them.
[11:51.700 --> 11:53.700]  You never did any such thing.
[11:53.700 --> 12:04.700]  The NIH getting orders from the UN and the WHO did, which you've cut the funding to and you've stopped their management and you've canceled their briefings where they put out this information.
[12:04.700 --> 12:06.700]  You obviously know what's going on.
[12:06.700 --> 12:12.700]  You've done the right things behind the scenes, but you've got to come out and lay it out to the American people.
[12:12.700 --> 12:16.700]  But let's look at some of the other things you need to expose while you still have time.
[12:16.700 --> 12:20.700]  They didn't just send people to the nursing homes to get people sick, to have a higher death number.
[12:20.700 --> 12:36.700]  It's on record from doctors and nurses all over the United States that in blue cities and blue states, because it's all a centralized scam, as you know, they were ordering them to intubate people who weren't even sick, who tested positive for COVID-19,
[12:36.700 --> 12:45.700]  because they were getting an additional $40,000 plus every time they did it, in total $52,000 altogether.
[12:45.700 --> 12:47.700]  So that's a bounty on their heads.
[12:47.700 --> 12:57.700]  Another one of the huge COVID-19 frauds that's again on record, not debated, it's just not being put front and center, is that COVID deaths have gone way down because the fraud's been exposed,
[12:57.700 --> 13:08.700]  but COVID positives have gone way up because they're testing more and more people and because the tests have again been ruled to be causing all these false positives,
[13:08.700 --> 13:16.700]  especially the non-anybody test that just finds the detritus or the remnants of a previous viral infection that isn't even COVID-19.
[13:16.700 --> 13:23.700]  You can go up there with the medical research and show that information, and then they get mad at Representative Louis Gohmert of Texas,
[13:23.700 --> 13:28.700]  because he says, I've been tested, I don't have COVID-19, I'm not wearing a mask.
[13:28.700 --> 13:33.700]  If he doesn't have it, why should you wear a mask? That's normal medicine. You're the sick one, you wear the mask.
[13:33.700 --> 13:38.700]  But no, they responded by, you still can have it, you've got to wear a mask to keep people safe.
[13:38.700 --> 13:48.700]  But the M95 mask that's recommended and pushed by the NIH only stops air coming in and releases air coming out in a valve,
[13:48.700 --> 13:52.700]  and so does not reduce the virus at all, and again, is a giant fraud.
[13:52.700 --> 14:05.700]  Hoaxes on top of hoaxes on top of hoaxes, and just like a bunch of bowling pins, we need you to line up, throw that bowling ball and hit a strike and knock them all out at once.
[14:05.700 --> 14:14.700]  It is the fault of the bureaucrats that are the true, deep state, the medical tyranny that did this, and by exposing them and breaking with them,
[14:14.700 --> 14:21.700]  you can destroy them, expose the whole COVID hoax, win reelection and keep America great.
[14:21.700 --> 14:26.700]  If you don't, we're going to go into total depression. If there's more rounds of bailouts, we're going to go into depression.
[14:26.700 --> 14:30.700]  Your own advisors, like Cutlow and others, are telling you this properly.
[14:30.700 --> 14:39.700]  So if you, again, do not move against these people and flamethrow them with the truth, only 100% truth will do it, then you're going to lose,
[14:39.700 --> 14:41.700]  and America's going into an engineered civil war.
[14:41.700 --> 14:45.700]  The New York Times is bragging that the virus won.
[14:45.700 --> 14:50.700]  Other publications are saying that the United States is the epicenter, it needs to be quarantined, and that we're criminals,
[14:50.700 --> 14:56.700]  and that America's over. They're openly celebrating this entire fraud.
[14:56.700 --> 15:00.700]  They're openly celebrating what they hope is the destruction of our republic.
[15:00.700 --> 15:07.700]  It's us or them, President Trump, I know when the chips are down, you're going to stand up and decisively expose these criminals,
[15:07.700 --> 15:11.700]  and call them out for how they're openly engineering this to bring down our republic.
[15:11.700 --> 15:23.700]  It's us or them, President Trump, burn them down politically, destroy them, or go along with national suicide and aid and abet the enemies of this republic.
[15:23.700 --> 15:30.700]  As for me and our viewers or listeners, we're going to continue to fight on, and deep down I know you're going to do the right thing.
[15:54.700 --> 16:03.700]  We're already in the latter part of June, and of course most of the country is not completely reopened again,
[16:03.700 --> 16:09.700]  and already foushee, and the U.N. Bill and the Gates criminal combiner telling us,
[16:09.700 --> 16:15.700]  don't go to Trump rallies, oh no, but the very same media that promotes that we shouldn't go to Trump rallies
[16:15.700 --> 16:19.700]  is telling us we should go to the Democrat Party, Black Lives Matter,
[16:19.700 --> 16:23.700]  all white people are evil, mind control, brainwashing events.
[16:23.700 --> 16:27.700]  This is the attempted murder of common sense and logic.
[16:27.700 --> 16:32.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be more politically active than you ever have,
[16:32.700 --> 16:37.700]  because we are going into hardcore United Nations controlled bondage.
[16:37.700 --> 16:41.700]  Major police departments like Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico are announcing,
[16:41.700 --> 16:47.700]  they're going under U.N. control, and turning their police into community activist organizers.
[16:47.700 --> 16:51.700]  This is just the beginning, everything's going to accelerate now from this point out.
[16:51.700 --> 17:17.700]  So, it's here, no more games, the New World Order has arrived.
[17:21.700 --> 17:27.700]  It's a period of liberty together in a symbiotic relationship that believes in humanity.
[17:27.700 --> 17:31.700]  And we're willing to face the true horror of the New World Order.
[17:31.700 --> 17:38.700]  But if we do not support the actual transmission center that's getting the messages out from the guest,
[17:38.700 --> 17:41.700]  the callers, the host, we will fail.
[17:41.700 --> 17:42.700]  I'm stating the obvious here.
[17:42.700 --> 17:46.700]  I just want to thank you on July 4th, 2020 for your support,
[17:46.700 --> 17:48.700]  no matter what color you are or where you came from.
[17:48.700 --> 17:52.700]  Human liberty and freedom, we're brothers and sisters together, and I salute and thank you all.
[17:52.700 --> 18:18.700]  Now share those links at band.video and crush the globalist murderers.
[18:18.700 --> 18:27.700]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:27.700 --> 18:29.700]  Alright, let me do this in this segment.
[18:29.700 --> 18:31.700]  Let me tell you the basic breakdown of the news.
[18:31.700 --> 18:33.700]  What's front and center, what I think is most important.
[18:33.700 --> 18:39.700]  And then I'm going to get into the Civil War that's now actually going from cold to hot,
[18:39.700 --> 18:45.700]  and the moves I believe we should make to stop it, and I believe the president should make to stop it.
[18:45.700 --> 18:50.700]  But let me just first tell you this, Roger Stone is breaking a silence.
[18:50.700 --> 18:52.700]  He's done a few interviews.
[18:52.700 --> 19:00.700]  He was going to wait to come on my show exclusively after big events that are going to take place, take place, we believe.
[19:00.700 --> 19:10.700]  But he's decided to just go ahead and break his silence, and he's going to break major news here tomorrow in the first hour with us.
[19:10.700 --> 19:15.700]  So I'm going to leave it at that.
[19:15.700 --> 19:23.700]  Huge news, but I am not going to butcher it, and I'm not going to promote it, even though I've been authorized to.
[19:23.700 --> 19:31.700]  I'm just going to let him lay it out and say it, because Joe Rogan called me up really excited, you know, a month ago about a Spotify deal.
[19:31.700 --> 19:38.700]  And then I went on there and talked about it, and there was a big national shakeup over it.
[19:38.700 --> 19:42.700]  Joe said things in his own words, even though he was telling me go ahead and promote what was happening.
[19:42.700 --> 19:48.700]  Because it just always becomes such a giant storm when we break something down here, because the politicos all get involved.
[19:48.700 --> 19:51.700]  But he says, go ahead and promote it.
[19:51.700 --> 19:56.700]  And so it'll be a big interview tomorrow with Roger Stone.
[19:56.700 --> 19:59.700]  In the first hour, I'll leave it at that.
[19:59.700 --> 20:05.700]  Okay, the best way to do this is just try to go over the headlines.
[20:05.700 --> 20:11.700]  We were facing an angry mob, gun-toting St. Louis couple tell their side of the story. That's zero hedge.
[20:11.700 --> 20:15.700]  Can you believe that these people have to tell their side of the story?
[20:15.700 --> 20:22.700]  Black Lives Matter go into their private estate, open the gate.
[20:22.700 --> 20:27.700]  It says private estate at the gate and inside.
[20:27.700 --> 20:30.700]  And you know what Black Lives Matter does? They burn things down.
[20:30.700 --> 20:35.700]  Then they say, after the people say get off our property with guns, Black Lives Matter says, that's it.
[20:35.700 --> 20:39.700]  We got the money shot.
[20:39.700 --> 20:42.700]  So they said, let's go to a private estate.
[20:42.700 --> 20:50.700]  A lot of people don't have a 100-year-old, I guess you'd call it Victorian style or old English style manner.
[20:50.700 --> 20:53.700]  It's got the columns on it, you know, it's got all that stuff.
[20:53.700 --> 20:58.700]  It's a McMansion, and it's got a couple acres of property.
[20:58.700 --> 21:02.700]  It's got the urns and all the rest of it, and I'm narrating for radio listeners.
[21:02.700 --> 21:08.700]  Remember TV viewers, I'm always narrating for the majority of our audiences on AM and FM.
[21:08.700 --> 21:15.700]  And the guy comes out with an AR-15, his wife comes out with what looks like a 9mm.
[21:15.700 --> 21:18.700]  Really the wrong gun for that type of neighborhood. You don't want to shoot your neighbors.
[21:18.700 --> 21:22.700]  You want to come out with a riot shotgun with, you know, 10 rounds.
[21:22.700 --> 21:24.700]  That'll take care of folks.
[21:24.700 --> 21:28.700]  You have whatever you want, still great firearms to have.
[21:28.700 --> 21:31.700]  You just better hit your target and not your neighbors, because that bullet will go over a mile.
[21:31.700 --> 21:33.700]  Not with a shotgun.
[21:33.700 --> 21:37.700]  It'll blast somebody to pieces up close at 50-100 yards, but not past that.
[21:37.700 --> 21:40.700]  Just a little home defense tip.
[21:40.700 --> 21:50.700]  You come to my house, I'm going to come at you with a riot shotgun.
[21:50.700 --> 21:58.700]  And then I got another one sitting right there. I'm going to pick up.
[21:58.700 --> 22:04.700]  As folks know, come to my house, you're going to be dealing with a double-ot buckshot out of a 12 gauge.
[22:04.700 --> 22:06.700]  Just a little tip for you.
[22:06.700 --> 22:10.700]  Maybe what she has in a 9mm or maybe it's a 380.
[22:10.700 --> 22:17.700]  But regardless, this is some lawyer.
[22:17.700 --> 22:21.700]  He's got this big mansion and he's being called a hero.
[22:21.700 --> 22:24.700]  Well, we looked into the guy. He's actually, it looks like a Democrat.
[22:24.700 --> 22:28.700]  But when people bust into your house, there's a big mob of 500 people is what it was.
[22:28.700 --> 22:33.700]  You better come out with a gun or you're about to get your house robbed or burned down.
[22:33.700 --> 22:38.700]  Just a little tip to all the dumbass leftists. Of course, they knew what they were doing.
[22:38.700 --> 22:43.700]  When you go on to somebody's property, there's a sign saying posted, no trespassing.
[22:43.700 --> 22:49.700]  They can kill you if they feel threatened.
[22:49.700 --> 22:55.700]  And again, they were trying to go up to their front door, all of it, strutting around saying, this is our street, we own it.
[22:55.700 --> 23:04.700]  Now, they were sent there by the Democratic Party that's already raised over $50 million off Black Lives Matter.
[23:04.700 --> 23:07.700]  The UN who launched the COVID-19 attacks now raised $7 million.
[23:07.700 --> 23:09.700]  It's that issue I'm going to cover later.
[23:09.700 --> 23:14.700]  But that's the type of thing we're going to be going over. We're going to play the audio, play the video of what happened.
[23:14.700 --> 23:19.700]  But this is what Black Lives Matter directed by Soros and the DNC are doing.
[23:19.700 --> 23:35.700]  They are picking now rich neighborhoods so that they can go pull stunts and open somebody's private gate and then go into their estate and pull this.
[23:35.700 --> 23:40.700]  That's why I would start suggesting to these folks to lock your gate, but that's not their responsibility.
[23:40.700 --> 23:46.700]  They said, posted, this is a private home.
[23:46.700 --> 23:51.700]  And there's another sign, so this is a private road, do not trespass.
[23:51.700 --> 23:55.700]  And you see that this is what's chilling.
[23:55.700 --> 23:59.700]  The mainstream corporate media, see, I said I'd cover this later, I'm already covering it.
[23:59.700 --> 24:09.700]  The mainstream corporate media in St. Louis area said that they were bad and that all the loving, liberal, peaceful people did was walk down a street, a public street.
[24:09.700 --> 24:11.700]  So it's all in the article and in FullWars.com.
[24:11.700 --> 24:17.700]  Now they had to backpedal once it came out that it was a private estate and a gravel driveway.
[24:17.700 --> 24:22.700]  They know the average person doesn't have a mansion like that. This is class warfare.
[24:22.700 --> 24:31.700]  So they see a big ornate two-story building with columns and they think, well, that's a museum.
[24:31.700 --> 24:37.700]  No, that's somebody living in an ostentatious house, probably an ambulance chaser from what we know.
[24:37.700 --> 24:41.700]  You see all those billboards in the highway about call the lawyer, do this, do that, get a big judgment.
[24:41.700 --> 24:44.700]  That's so they can live in big mansions.
[24:44.700 --> 24:49.700]  Now, the guy did that in vitting a medical device or did that in vitting a new firearm or in vitting a new silicon ducker.
[24:49.700 --> 24:56.700]  I'd be fine with it. I'm not saying the lawyer is a bad guy. They're down to the point now of saying their heroes attack them, get them.
[24:56.700 --> 25:02.700]  He's a right winger. He's got a gun. Turns out the guy gave more of the Democrats than he gave to Republicans.
[25:02.700 --> 25:06.700]  He's a lawyer. What do you think he's doing?
[25:06.700 --> 25:13.700]  And so that's my message to the establishment left that thinks you're safe. You're not safe from the mobs that are out there.
[25:13.700 --> 25:16.700]  So I'm going to get more into that and play the audio in the video coming up.
[25:16.700 --> 25:24.700]  Obviously, the big news, Supreme Court struck down an anti-abortion law in Louisiana in its first major abortion case under Trump.
[25:24.700 --> 25:32.700]  Kavanaugh and the other Newspaper members voted against it. They need one more person on the court that Trump appoints to be able to overturn it.
[25:32.700 --> 25:40.700]  The Chief Justice, Rhino Neocon, was the deciding vote that defeated it and continues the extermination of innocent babies.
[25:40.700 --> 25:44.700]  That is all coming up as well.
[25:44.700 --> 25:53.700]  We're going to go to break and talk about how to stop the globalist civil war that's already here and what next tricks they're going to pull in the national lockdown and the mass coax and all the rest of it.

[29:49.700 --> 30:17.700]  I thank you for your continued prayer, your focus and your support. Again, I salute you all.
[30:19.700 --> 30:29.700]  Welcome to the most banned, suppressed broadcast in the world. Thanks to you spreading the word, the Streisand Effect.
[30:29.700 --> 30:39.700]  We're reaching more people than ever, especially the people that count. People that want to take action and want to be informed and want to be free.
[30:39.700 --> 30:45.700]  Okay, let's get into the Civil War. Then I want to open the phones up about your ideas and how we can stop it in the second hour.
[30:45.700 --> 31:00.700]  We are in an artificial civil war where Americans are being played off against each other over sexual preference, over the color of our skin, over where we live, over whether we're a Republican or a Democrat, whether we want to wear a mask or not.
[31:00.700 --> 31:13.700]  And this is simple, old fashioned divide and conquer. And if you go back to the Hillary Clinton emails that are in WikiLeaks, imagine the ones that have been hidden with 36,000.
[31:13.700 --> 31:22.700]  But if you go back to the thousands of emails that were in the WikiLeaks data dump, she's talking to major psychological experts at universities about how to win.
[31:22.700 --> 31:32.700]  And they said the only way to win is more culture war along racial, religious and sexual orientation lines.
[31:32.700 --> 31:48.700]  That's cold blooded. And you've got so many dumbed down, lazy people in this country through the entertainment industry and the dumbing down in the schools and the fluoride and the water and the rest of it that it's very hard to get through to people that are already brainwashed.
[31:48.700 --> 32:05.700]  What's really dangerous is the average white leftist particularly who's gotten two or three degrees but is back in groceries at the grocery store. They believe that they're going to have power once their system comes in.
[32:05.700 --> 32:11.700]  And there's an allotted slot for them in the hierarchy of control in the new world order.
[32:11.700 --> 32:21.700]  And of course the real globalist plan is to phase the left out completely once they're done wrecking the West. They're going to be outlawed. It's like alien dialectic and that's in the white papers.
[32:21.700 --> 32:26.700]  They're not bringing in some clowered and pivot strategy to collapse society so they get power.
[32:26.700 --> 32:41.700]  As you've been to a leftist event or rally, these people don't have hygiene. They can barely talk. They're all on psychotropic drugs. But they've all got their degree in social work or whatever the case may be and they're going to run our lives.
[32:41.700 --> 32:51.700]  And I'm not saying every academic or every social worker or every psychologist is a bad person. I'm saying as a group, they have the highest level of suicide, mental illness.
[32:51.700 --> 33:03.700]  And in all the studies, the left is ugly, unhealthy, six to nine times more likely to steal, four to what is it, seven times more likely not to give to charity.
[33:03.700 --> 33:11.700]  But to tell you they're going to give to charity, they're over nine times more likely. So what they are is fakes.
[33:11.700 --> 33:25.700]  They're frauds. They're all barking no bite. They're all hat and no cattle. They're a mile wide and eight and an inch deep. When the rubber meets the road, they aren't there.
[33:25.700 --> 33:35.700]  And what they are is schmucks. They really believe Bill Gates that he wants to kill old people so he can give them more jobs.
[33:35.700 --> 33:43.700]  You take care of people that builds an economy. You have a barbarous economy that doesn't take care of people. You create a hellhole.
[33:43.700 --> 33:55.700]  So these are very, very, very dangerous bad people. And they see those of us that are informed and involved and competent and they're pissed.
[33:55.700 --> 33:59.700]  They don't like the fact that you've got your act together. They don't like the fact you're successful.
[33:59.700 --> 34:10.700]  And even if you're a poor person but have a good family and love God, you're way richer than they are and they know that and they see that sparkle in your eye and they want to get rid of it.
[34:10.700 --> 34:20.700]  So class warfare hasn't worked too well in the West. So they're just moving to race war. And the former French prime minister came out last week and said that.
[34:20.700 --> 34:29.700]  And he quoted the government where they were admitting class warfare and race warfare.
[34:29.700 --> 34:38.700]  So I know the audience all understands this, but when you look at the left and you look at the idiots and you look at black lives matter that's almost all white,
[34:38.700 --> 34:51.700]  you have to understand that that's just the cover that the establishment needs for the behind the scenes, stealing the election, staging an assassination of the president, staging terror attacks,
[34:51.700 --> 35:05.700]  and that they're trying and failing every day with the new Bubba Smollett event at NASCAR and with this event in St. Louis going on to the private estate and saying it's a public road and trying to lie to people,
[35:05.700 --> 35:10.700]  knowing when people come out of their houses to defend their property from a mob, that they're going to bring guns.
[35:10.700 --> 35:19.700]  And Sasha Merrick Cohen who says get rid of Americans free speech, arrest Alex Jones, a monstrous individual who's not even an American.
[35:19.700 --> 35:28.700]  He comes here and says, oh, you're having a reopen America event.
[35:28.700 --> 35:37.700]  And he says, I, he didn't tell him it was him, he said, oh, I'm a country singer that wants to reopen America.
[35:37.700 --> 35:41.700]  I'll come pay for an extra stage and some security if you let me sing.
[35:41.700 --> 35:43.700]  He gets there, he starts saying racist stuff.
[35:43.700 --> 35:45.700]  They run up and try to stop him.
[35:45.700 --> 35:50.700]  Armed men stop them so he can frame the crowd.
[35:50.700 --> 35:53.700]  And the left goes, oh, you just don't have a sense of humor.
[35:53.700 --> 36:02.700]  Sasha Merrick Cohen's so funny. No, he's a false flagging slimy criminal who says none of us deserve speech,
[36:02.700 --> 36:09.700]  but he'll use speech and fraud to frame people criminally.
[36:09.700 --> 36:14.700]  The man is a super creepy, evil person.
[36:14.700 --> 36:15.700]  He just got caught in a false flag.
[36:15.700 --> 36:16.700]  We'll cover that later.
[36:16.700 --> 36:19.700]  But what am I getting at here?
[36:19.700 --> 36:21.700]  This is the season of Jesse Smollett.
[36:21.700 --> 36:23.700]  This is the season of false flags.
[36:23.700 --> 36:28.700]  This is the season where the average leftist on the street.
[36:28.700 --> 36:34.700]  You've got the zombie class and above them kind of the method want to be academic and if a class,
[36:34.700 --> 36:39.700]  these are the type of people that will come up to you in a restaurant and say,
[36:39.700 --> 36:42.700]  I'm going to kill you three times till you finally are walking out.
[36:42.700 --> 36:47.700]  They turn their cameras on and say, don't harass us at you at your family.
[36:47.700 --> 36:48.700]  Hey, screw you back.
[36:48.700 --> 36:54.700]  They edit the video. Jones attacks innocent people at their table.
[36:54.700 --> 36:55.700]  And I know you know their frauds.
[36:55.700 --> 37:01.700]  I know you know they're evil, but get to understand the average one is an evil person now.
[37:01.700 --> 37:10.700]  They fully converted a third of the country into just nasty, hateful, trashy, drug addict people
[37:10.700 --> 37:20.700]  who believe they're part of a ruling class and have disdain for America and disdain for God and disdain for decency
[37:20.700 --> 37:30.700]  and disdain for families and disdain for capitalism because their degenerate trash
[37:30.700 --> 37:37.700]  and their trash of all colors who have been trained by the media and the culture that they're part of the ruling class
[37:37.700 --> 37:44.700]  and that they're going to cross the River Jordan any minute into heaven, on earth, into a Valhalla,
[37:44.700 --> 37:50.700]  just as soon as they can drag Queen Petafal time your kid, just as soon as they can make you wear a mask,
[37:50.700 --> 37:56.700]  just as soon as they can tell you that you're a Russian, just as soon as they can make you submit to them.
[37:56.700 --> 38:01.700]  If you'll just do what you're told, like they do, they follow orders from the establishment,
[38:01.700 --> 38:05.700]  then suddenly they'll be in charge.
[38:05.700 --> 38:11.700]  So you have to understand their motivation. They're in on the conspiracy now.
[38:11.700 --> 38:16.700]  They know it's all a fraud. They know they're setting people up. They know they're creating racism.
[38:16.700 --> 38:19.700]  They know they're into Satanism. They know they're into pedophilia.
[38:19.700 --> 38:29.700]  This big top Buzzfeed writer that just got fired for plagiarism turns out he's really fired for writing public articles about wanting to shoot child porn.
[38:29.700 --> 38:38.700]  Public articles about how he really wants to shoot sex scenes with children.
[38:38.700 --> 38:45.700]  I'm telling you, folks, half the Democrats are now pedophiles. Pedophilia is just rampant.
[38:45.700 --> 38:50.700]  And when you watch these drag queen story times, don't put any video of it, folks. I don't want to see it right now.
[38:50.700 --> 38:54.700]  Everyone wants to see it, but I'm making specific statements here.
[38:54.700 --> 38:57.700]  So some of these people are just useful idiots and don't know what they're doing.
[38:57.700 --> 39:01.700]  We've gone and we've covered them. I've been around it. I've documented it.
[39:01.700 --> 39:06.700]  When we watched the raw footage we've played it here at these drag queen events with little kids,
[39:06.700 --> 39:15.700]  there are men with no underwear on, with their genitals glued to their leg with glitter on it, with kids sitting in their laps,
[39:15.700 --> 39:20.700]  and the mothers walk up and give them five-year-old boys and girls, and the men start humping them,
[39:20.700 --> 39:26.700]  and the women literally start rubbing their thighs together and are just like having orgasms.
[39:26.700 --> 39:30.700]  They're into the degeneracy of the pedophilia.
[39:30.700 --> 39:36.700]  See, if a leftist can't kill a baby before it's born and keep it alive and take its organs or whatever they want to do,
[39:36.700 --> 39:39.700]  then they're at least going to rape the hell out of it.
[39:39.700 --> 39:46.700]  These people are gone, folks, and this is their Jacobin Satanic Revolution, and they're coming for you and your family.
[39:46.700 --> 39:53.700]  What are you going to do about it? They want your children. They want our. They are evil.
[39:53.700 --> 39:57.700]  The 4th of July, 2020.
[39:57.700 --> 40:03.700]  We are here, and despite all the globalist attacks, you, the viewers and listeners of this transmission,
[40:03.700 --> 40:09.700]  have supported us by prayer, by word of mouth, by buying the products, and you have done all of this.
[40:09.700 --> 40:18.700]  So when you look at the huge effect Info Wars has had, I want you to understand that it's because of what you have done,
[40:18.700 --> 40:24.700]  and myself and the whole crew salute you on this July 4th, 2020.
[40:24.700 --> 40:31.700]  We've got a lot of our best-selling products that were sold out, DNA Force Plus, Bodies, Ultra 12, and others that have been sold out for months.
[40:31.700 --> 40:36.700]  Back in stock, 50% off for the 4th of July.
[40:36.700 --> 40:41.700]  We're running a special. I want to encourage you to get these products because they have enriched my life so much.
[40:41.700 --> 40:47.700]  I know they'll enrich your life, and regardless, it's a total 360 win because it funds the Info War.
[40:47.700 --> 40:52.700]  The only way we fail is when you don't take action. I don't need to tell you that. You already took action.
[40:52.700 --> 41:21.700]  And I salute and thank you.
[41:22.700 --> 41:27.700]  This is a factory that are making fake COVID tests that show everyone is positive.
[41:27.700 --> 41:33.700]  And despite that, they're still testing record numbers of people, creating hysteria and saying the numbers spiking,
[41:33.700 --> 41:38.700]  and why it will be 200,000 dead by the election, and it's all Trump's fault.
[41:38.700 --> 41:43.700]  And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city. We've got to lock down again. Everything's over.
[41:43.700 --> 41:47.700]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners.
[41:47.700 --> 41:55.700]  When we expose the COVID hoax, we're all permanently enslaved by it. Your choice.
[41:55.700 --> 42:00.700]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months
[42:00.700 --> 42:03.700]  because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[42:03.700 --> 42:06.700]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast.
[42:06.700 --> 42:09.700]  And I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[42:09.700 --> 42:11.700]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[42:11.700 --> 42:17.700]  In February 2016, I went in a hospital. I went to VA Hospital out here in Boise, and I was in there until June.
[42:17.700 --> 42:22.700]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to Info Wars three hours a day,
[42:22.700 --> 42:26.700]  and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about Living Defense.
[42:26.700 --> 42:32.700]  Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem, and I stumbled with it for about five or six years,
[42:32.700 --> 42:35.700]  and the doctors, they tried every test. Nobody could figure out what it is.
[42:35.700 --> 42:39.700]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[42:39.700 --> 42:41.700]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[42:41.700 --> 42:44.700]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have a stuff,
[42:44.700 --> 42:48.700]  but I ordered it, had it shipped to me. I got it, I hid it from the nurses.
[42:48.700 --> 42:52.700]  I started taking it, man. That stuff changed my life. It saved my life.
[42:52.700 --> 42:55.700]  Alex Jones and Info Wars saved my life.
[42:55.700 --> 42:59.700]  2020 is a very special year to the globalists, to the occultists,
[42:59.700 --> 43:02.700]  to those that are into esoteric mysticism,
[43:02.700 --> 43:06.700]  and they believe this is the year they're going to totally overthrow America and the world
[43:06.700 --> 43:09.700]  and bring in their anti-God, anti-human tyranny.
[43:09.700 --> 43:14.700]  Well, we're here on air, and we just ask you all to realize that we're in opposition to this evil,
[43:14.700 --> 43:17.700]  and that only your word of mouth helps us reach new people,
[43:17.700 --> 43:19.700]  and I want to salute you all, thank you for your support.
[43:19.700 --> 43:23.700]  And I also want you to know that our 4th of July, once a year, mega sale was here,
[43:23.700 --> 43:27.700]  and we've got a bunch of stuff at 50 to 60% off right now,
[43:27.700 --> 43:30.700]  but bodies are ultimate turmeric formula.
[43:30.700 --> 43:33.700]  This is a turmeric extract, one of the strongest ones out there.
[43:33.700 --> 43:36.700]  It's good for your body, so good for your joints, so good for your cells.
[43:36.700 --> 43:42.700]  It is now back in stock, sold out for over three months, and it is at 50% off.
[43:42.700 --> 43:46.700]  DNA Force Plus is back in stock, it's 50% off as well.
[43:46.700 --> 43:48.700]  Check it all out at InfoWareStore.com.
[43:48.700 --> 43:51.700]  And remember, your funding of our operation makes it all possible.
[43:51.700 --> 43:54.700]  Plus, these are great things that God designed for you and your family's bodies.
[43:54.700 --> 44:06.700]  Please take action.
[44:06.700 --> 44:26.700]  America is not perfect, but America envisioned ideas that came out of the Renaissance and out of England that we should free people and we should empower women.
[44:26.700 --> 44:34.700]  And the idea now that we're the bad guys because the big global corporations that run death camps in China
[44:34.700 --> 44:38.700]  don't want to compete with people that have Western freedom.
[44:38.700 --> 44:41.700]  They don't want to compete against the American system.
[44:41.700 --> 44:47.700]  And so they're selling you being poor and austerity and racial division and anti-Christian garbage.
[44:47.700 --> 44:50.700]  And now the left wants statues of Christ taken down.
[44:50.700 --> 44:54.700]  And now they want statues of Lincoln taken down and they're officially saying,
[44:54.700 --> 44:56.700]  we don't like the emancipation proclamation.
[44:56.700 --> 44:59.700]  Lincoln wasn't good enough.
[44:59.700 --> 45:05.700]  Where they're the gods of the left and no one can ever do enough to show their good.
[45:05.700 --> 45:13.700]  While Nike and Apple have slave shops all over the world, Apple has literal death camps.
[45:13.700 --> 45:21.700]  It would take hours to go over Apple.
[45:21.700 --> 45:23.700]  It's so hellish.
[45:23.700 --> 45:25.700]  I can't even, I start pulling up the data in my mind.
[45:25.700 --> 45:28.700]  It's just, it sounds unbelievable.
[45:28.700 --> 45:33.700]  And they sit there and they tell you how you're bad because they own death camps.
[45:33.700 --> 45:35.700]  Foxconn, look it up.
[45:35.700 --> 45:46.700]  Suicide nets, forced abortion, 16 hour work days, people living in containers, defecating on the ground.
[45:46.700 --> 45:48.700]  Apple just isn't one of the bad ones.
[45:48.700 --> 45:50.700]  They're the worst on record.
[45:50.700 --> 45:52.700]  So is Nike.
[45:52.700 --> 45:56.700]  Oh, but he's got Kaepernick up there.
[45:56.700 --> 45:58.700]  He's for the black people.
[45:58.700 --> 46:00.700]  He's going to stand up for the black people.
[46:00.700 --> 46:05.700]  He's a monster working for globalists to cover up what they've done.
[46:05.700 --> 46:10.700]  He's nothing but a black shield they use to carry out their evil and he's not even black.
[46:10.700 --> 46:15.700]  Looks like an Arab.
[46:15.700 --> 46:18.700]  He didn't have that Afro till he signed with Nike and they said,
[46:18.700 --> 46:20.700]  we want you to look like this and do like this.
[46:20.700 --> 46:23.700]  You represent black people now.
[46:23.700 --> 46:26.700]  The man is a fraud. The man is a clown.
[46:26.700 --> 46:28.700]  The man is a devil.
[46:28.700 --> 46:32.700]  And not because he's got brown skin, but because his heart is evil.
[46:32.700 --> 46:39.700]  Sorry, I'm not going to go down that path right now.
[46:39.700 --> 46:47.700]  So now they're saying they shouldn't even have Star Spangled Banner at sporting events.
[46:47.700 --> 46:51.700]  Now, mainline news is saying, get rid of George Washington.
[46:51.700 --> 46:52.700]  Get rid of the flag.
[46:52.700 --> 47:00.700]  Remember, Trump said it a few years ago and John Oliver made fun of them and said that's totally insane when that was always their plan.
[47:00.700 --> 47:02.700]  This is the overthrow of the country.
[47:02.700 --> 47:09.700]  This is the outlawing of our symbols to outlaw the Bill of Rights and Constitution that stands directly against their new world order takeover.
[47:09.700 --> 47:12.700]  They want that Declaration of Independence.
[47:12.700 --> 47:13.700]  They want that Bill of Rights.
[47:13.700 --> 47:14.700]  I'm getting chills.
[47:14.700 --> 47:20.700]  They want that Constitution because everybody modeled their governments after that and people want that worldwide.
[47:20.700 --> 47:27.700]  They have to repudiate that and overturn that because the idea threatens them.
[47:27.700 --> 47:37.700]  Even though we only expressed part of that idea, we were number one in human freedom and everybody knows it.
[47:37.700 --> 47:48.700]  And that's why they use a bunch of dumb college dropouts and morons running around attacking people and saying they own everything to try to trigger a civil war.
[47:48.700 --> 47:55.700]  And they finally get a video of some old folks in golf carts being screamed at by other old white people.
[47:55.700 --> 47:56.700]  And they're going, you're a Nazi.
[47:56.700 --> 47:57.700]  F you all this stuff.
[47:57.700 --> 47:59.700]  So the old guy goes, yeah, right.
[47:59.700 --> 48:00.700]  White power laughs back at him.
[48:00.700 --> 48:01.700]  Clearly a joke.
[48:01.700 --> 48:03.700]  But everybody's screaming black power all day.
[48:03.700 --> 48:04.700]  Why couldn't he say that?
[48:04.700 --> 48:06.700]  The point is, is that he's a joke.
[48:06.700 --> 48:08.700]  Oh, and it's barely hear it in the clip.
[48:08.700 --> 48:11.700]  Oh, Trump's tweeted white supremism.
[48:11.700 --> 48:12.700]  White supremism.
[48:12.700 --> 48:13.700]  Give me a break.
[48:13.700 --> 48:15.700]  I'll tell you what the white supremism is.
[48:15.700 --> 48:23.700]  John Wayne talked about is that the white man's burden that Rudger Kipling talked about the people aren't literary.
[48:23.700 --> 48:29.700]  They know he was quoting Rudger Kipling and saying, we better build up these areas.
[48:29.700 --> 48:31.700]  The world's everybody was killing each other there.
[48:31.700 --> 48:32.700]  It was total squalor.
[48:32.700 --> 48:41.700]  And once it happened, the populations exploded and people are fighting to get in to get around the white devils.
[48:41.700 --> 48:44.700]  Because the white devils had a renaissance.
[48:44.700 --> 48:48.700]  The white devils thousands of years ago were all killing each other just like in Africa because we didn't have Christ.
[48:48.700 --> 48:50.700]  It's Christ we all need.
[48:50.700 --> 48:52.700]  That's what will unify us.
[48:52.700 --> 48:54.700]  And I'm not going to make you worship Christ.
[48:54.700 --> 48:56.700]  Christ doesn't want you to be made to do it.
[48:56.700 --> 49:00.700]  But they don't even want us to have the right to point out those historical facts.
[49:00.700 --> 49:10.700]  So I'm going to put some nails to chalkboard here for the left who I know tune in over at Media Matters and over at the Democratic Party area.
[49:10.700 --> 49:15.700]  Because they don't want us to exercise these symbols here that are powerful against them.
[49:15.700 --> 49:18.700]  Has America done wrong things with the flag flying over it? Damn right.
[49:18.700 --> 49:20.700]  But what is the flag symbolizes?
[49:20.700 --> 49:22.700]  Why does evil want to get rid of it so much?
[49:22.700 --> 49:24.700]  Because it's a symbol of we the people.
[49:24.700 --> 49:27.700]  And we've taken that symbol back and they're so scared.
[49:27.700 --> 49:31.700]  So here's Whitney Houston and the Star Spangled Banner.
[49:31.700 --> 49:36.700]  And I want you to think as we play this in a moment about which side you're on.
[49:36.700 --> 49:45.700]  Because as America fades and as it falls, pure evil, the Communist Chinese globalist Hollywood pedophile model is the model.
[49:45.700 --> 49:51.700]  And so we're not replacing America that's done amazing things, the best place to live by many metrics, with something better.
[49:51.700 --> 49:56.700]  We're replacing it with real, bona fide slavery.
[49:56.700 --> 50:04.700]  So this Fourth of July is so important because it could be the last real Fourth of July before this country goes down for good.
[50:04.700 --> 50:11.700]  It's a very important Fourth of July and they're telling you, oh, you can't go have a party at your house or have hot dogs or go out to a restaurant or a bar or on a boat.
[50:11.700 --> 50:16.700]  Oh, you don't do that. We need it canceled. We need a national declaration by Trump. Everybody's got to wear masks.
[50:16.700 --> 50:22.700]  Oh, but the gay and lesbian and pedophile rallies, they can happen in Chicago and London and they're good.
[50:22.700 --> 50:24.700]  And the media says that's not a problem.
[50:24.700 --> 50:32.700]  But if you want to go out and you want to shoot off fireworks and you want to be proud of your country, you need to stay in your damn house.
[50:32.700 --> 50:39.700]  That's the war on logic by these leftist cult members, good little dutiful slaves.
[50:39.700 --> 50:44.700]  And remember, at the heart of the whole LGBT system is the P, the pedophile.
[50:44.700 --> 50:47.700]  That's what it's really about, ladies and gentlemen.
[50:47.700 --> 50:53.700]  At the end of the day, that's the operating system. How many major LGBT events it turns out are run by pedophiles.
[50:53.700 --> 50:57.700]  They got all these useful idiots out there that they get some liberation thing.
[50:57.700 --> 51:03.700]  But at the heart of it, what about being able to get married? It was about access to those kids, wasn't it?
[51:03.700 --> 51:12.700]  We're supposed to just turn our kids over to this like Anderson Cooper was turned over by his mother at age eight to the entertainment industry and to male model systems.
[51:12.700 --> 51:18.700]  Well, he might as well just throw your son into a pit of piranhas, but that was their sacrament.
[51:18.700 --> 51:21.700]  Other one didn't play ball off the balcony.
[51:21.700 --> 51:23.700]  Here's the Star Spangled Banner.
[51:23.700 --> 51:36.700]  Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light
[51:36.700 --> 51:48.700]  What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
[51:48.700 --> 52:01.700]  Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
[52:01.700 --> 52:14.700]  O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming
[52:14.700 --> 52:26.700]  And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air
[52:26.700 --> 52:41.700]  And truth, through the night that our flag was still there
[52:41.700 --> 52:52.700]  Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
[52:52.700 --> 52:57.700]  They're trying to take your birthright, everything you are, and let them do it.
[52:57.700 --> 53:11.700]  And the home of the brave, remember that?
[53:11.700 --> 53:21.700]  And instead we've got all these cowardly, globalist corporations teaching us to bow down and worship tyranny, teaching us to, oh my gosh,
[53:21.700 --> 53:27.700]  Laurel is coming out and saying they're going to get rid of makeup that says light makeup or whitening makeup.
[53:27.700 --> 53:30.700]  Hey, some people want to be brown, some people want to look white.
[53:30.700 --> 53:32.700]  I like being brown, feels good to me.
[53:32.700 --> 53:34.700]  I just like how the sun feels.
[53:34.700 --> 53:38.700]  Some folks want to look lighter, some want to look darker.
[53:38.700 --> 53:42.700]  Sometimes I've got a red spot on my face for TV, I got a little bit of whitener to put over it.
[53:42.700 --> 53:46.700]  You know, that's your right to do it, but now even makeup is racist.
[53:46.700 --> 53:51.700]  And now Woodrow Wilson University is changing its name because he wasn't perfect.
[53:51.700 --> 53:53.700]  He was actually a globalist.
[53:53.700 --> 53:55.700]  He found out about it, they tried to poison him, tried to kill him.
[53:55.700 --> 54:01.700]  They spoke out against it publicly about the Federal Reserve Act, but there's no way to capitulate to these people.
[54:01.700 --> 54:06.700]  They're never going to give up, they're never going to stop pushing because they want power over words and over everything
[54:06.700 --> 54:15.700]  because they are a cult of control freaks on top with a cult of losers below them that believe they are going to take over the planet.
[54:15.700 --> 54:19.700]  But they are going to fall just like the Nazi cult, just like the Soviet cult.
[54:19.700 --> 54:21.700]  It is going down.
[54:21.700 --> 54:26.700]  And that's why they're grasping for power right now because they know the time is short for them.
[54:26.700 --> 54:28.700]  Well, thank you all for tuning in.
[54:28.700 --> 54:30.700]  Be activist, be Paul Revere's.
[54:30.700 --> 54:31.700]  Tell folks how you're listening.
[54:31.700 --> 54:34.700]  Spread the links to infowars.com, sports, my show, and Band-Aid video.
[54:34.700 --> 54:36.700]  It is breaking the back of big tech.
[54:36.700 --> 54:38.700]  They can't stand it.
[54:38.700 --> 54:44.700]  Please fight, fight for your future, fight for your rights, or be destroyed.
[54:44.700 --> 54:46.700]  It's finally here.

[55:37.700 --> 56:05.700]  That's Survival Shield X2 Spray at infowarsstore.com.
[56:05.700 --> 56:07.700]  Now the COVID hysteria is all about that.
[56:07.700 --> 56:11.700]  I recently had a woman in the street walls with my youngest daughter.
[56:11.700 --> 56:18.700]  And my daughter walked close to her and she said, get away 6 feet and gave her a super ugly look.
[56:18.700 --> 56:20.700]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is mental illness.
[56:20.700 --> 56:24.700]  My daughter walking 4 feet from some old woman is not a crime.
[56:24.700 --> 56:28.700]  The old woman's mental illness is the crime if we give in to it.
[56:28.700 --> 56:32.700]  This is total and complete mind control.
[56:32.700 --> 56:35.700]  We must expose the COVID hoax now.
[56:35.700 --> 56:37.700]  They're going to continue to clamp down using this.
[56:37.700 --> 56:39.700]  It's a UN Bill Gates plan.
[56:39.700 --> 56:42.700]  They've been proven to be criminal liars and they must be defeated.
[56:42.700 --> 56:44.700]  They must be exposed.
[56:44.700 --> 57:12.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:12.700 --> 57:15.700]  There's some really good news on the COVID hoax.
[57:15.700 --> 57:18.700]  When we start the next segment, Ron Paul is a medical doctor.
[57:18.700 --> 57:21.700]  He's come out and said the media is lying about the second wave.
[57:21.700 --> 57:24.700]  Elon Musk is a top scientist and engineer.
[57:24.700 --> 57:26.700]  He's come out and said it's a fraud.
[57:26.700 --> 57:27.700]  It is a fraud.
[57:27.700 --> 57:28.700]  It is a fraud.
[57:28.700 --> 57:29.700]  It is a fraud.
[57:29.700 --> 57:33.700]  And Trump must go on the offense about this or they're going to keep the damn country locked down
[57:33.700 --> 57:35.700]  and forget whether Trump is reelected or not.
[57:35.700 --> 57:39.700]  He might still be reelected as Biden is such an idiot.
[57:39.700 --> 57:42.700]  But there's already global depressions on.
[57:42.700 --> 57:44.700]  Millions are already starving to death.
[57:44.700 --> 57:47.700]  And for me, it's not some virtue signal that a bunch of black people are starving to death.
[57:47.700 --> 57:49.700]  That freaks me out, folks.
[57:49.700 --> 57:50.700]  That's bad.
[57:50.700 --> 57:52.700]  We shouldn't let this happen for no damn reason.
[57:52.700 --> 57:59.700]  Here is a very important special report that lays out the whole Jesse Smollett part two hoax.
[57:59.700 --> 58:01.700]  It's a deja vu.
[58:01.700 --> 58:03.700]  Smollett, it's up at Band-Aid video.
[58:03.700 --> 58:04.700]  Here it is.
[58:04.700 --> 58:11.700]  Bubba Wallace will run a special Black Lives Matter paint scheme for the race tomorrow night at Martinsville.
[58:11.700 --> 58:12.700]  Pretty cool.
[58:12.700 --> 58:15.700]  His sponsors will allow him to make this statement.
[58:15.700 --> 58:22.700]  The FBI is investigating the discovery of a noose in the garage of NASCAR's only African-American driver.
[58:22.700 --> 58:25.700]  A noose discovered near his team garage.
[58:25.700 --> 58:28.700]  A noose was found in Bubba's garage.
[58:28.700 --> 58:34.700]  Somebody put a noose inside of Bubba Wallace's garage stall over the weekend.
[58:34.700 --> 58:41.700]  That noose was found by a member of his team just hours after someone blew a Confederate flag over Alabama's Talladega Super Speedway
[58:41.700 --> 58:45.700]  to protest NASCAR banning the symbol at all events.
[58:45.700 --> 58:50.700]  This skin color makes him a prime target for this.
[58:50.700 --> 58:52.700]  It's a straight up noose.
[58:52.700 --> 58:58.700]  The FBI has stated it was a noose over and over again. NASCAR leadership has stated it was a noose.
[58:58.700 --> 59:04.700]  The noose in Bubba's garage stall was actually seen by a member of his team.
[59:04.700 --> 59:06.700]  Daryl Bubba never saw it.
[59:06.700 --> 59:12.700]  Didn't you say that it was hanging over your specific car, your area?
[59:12.700 --> 59:15.700]  It was in my garage bay. I never seen it personally.
[59:15.700 --> 59:16.700]  You never saw it?
[59:16.700 --> 59:19.700]  I never, you know, walked up and seen it. Yeah, I never seen it.
[59:19.700 --> 59:28.700]  I can confirm that I actually got evidence of what was hanging in my garage over my car around my thicker guys to confirm that it was a noose.
[59:28.700 --> 59:30.700]  No, it's not a noose. It's a rope to close the garage door.
[59:30.700 --> 59:32.700]  Is this another Justie Smollett?
[59:32.700 --> 59:37.700]  To me, it feels fake. It feels totally phony. It feels like we've been here before.
[59:37.700 --> 59:40.700]  Haven't we heard this story somewhere before?
[59:40.700 --> 59:43.700]  I'm gonna tell you right now, it's a hoax. I don't believe it.
[59:43.700 --> 59:49.700]  I think Bubba, your new name is Bubba Justie Wallace.
[59:49.700 --> 59:55.700]  We begin tonight with breaking news from NASCAR just moments ago saying the FBI investigation into the noose
[59:55.700 --> 59:59.700]  found in the garage of NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace was no crime, they say.
[59:59.700 --> 1:00:06.700]  The noose found in Bubba Wallace's garage at Talladega Speedway was a garage pool that had been there for months
[1:00:06.700 --> 1:00:09.700]  and that he was not the target of a hate crime.
[1:00:09.700 --> 1:00:14.700]  The noose was a garage door pool that had been around well before Bubba ever arrived.
[1:00:14.700 --> 1:00:19.700]  The noose you heard so much about hanging in NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace's garage
[1:00:19.700 --> 1:00:26.700]  turned out to be what almost every other recent noose turned out to be, not a noose at all.
[1:00:26.700 --> 1:00:32.700]  The now hashtag Bubba Hoax and hashtag Bubba Smollett were trending on Twitter.
[1:00:32.700 --> 1:00:38.700]  Time and time and time again these awful, terrible racist stories turned out to be completely flimsy or phony or totally non-existent
[1:00:38.700 --> 1:00:42.700]  and unfortunately have a lot of people who seem to be very invested in wishing that they were true.
[1:00:42.700 --> 1:00:46.700]  They wanted it to be a noose, they wanted it to be a hate crime.
[1:00:46.700 --> 1:00:51.700]  People want to believe this so bad, that's why this lie travels all the way around the world,
[1:00:51.700 --> 1:00:55.700]  that's why Bubba Wallace is still doing interviews.
[1:00:55.700 --> 1:01:01.700]  What would you say to those people who are doubting that this even happened or that it's true?
[1:01:01.700 --> 1:01:08.700]  Yeah, just like Steve Phelps said, it offends me that people would go to those measures, but again, I'm not shocked.
[1:01:08.700 --> 1:01:11.700]  Certainly it was a rushed investigation.
[1:01:14.700 --> 1:01:25.700]  Racism is so hard to find, you have to create these circumstances in order to find one.
[1:01:25.700 --> 1:01:31.700]  How is it that we have more fake hate crimes in America than real ones?
[1:01:31.700 --> 1:01:39.700]  You got all these white people out here coddling you, walking in solidarity, and you know you're full of crap.
[1:01:39.700 --> 1:01:45.700]  The race hustlers on the left double and triple down because they need for black people to feel victimized,
[1:01:45.700 --> 1:01:47.700]  they need for black people to feel like...
[1:01:47.700 --> 1:01:56.700]  It needs to be shared, it's in Band-Aud video, we'll be right back, strap yourselves in.
[1:02:17.700 --> 1:02:30.700]  This is all complete and total preparation for world government, forced inoculation, and complete enslavement of the human population.
[1:02:30.700 --> 1:02:35.700]  This is medical tyranny, this is the Bill and Melinda Gates UN takeover.
[1:02:35.700 --> 1:02:41.700]  This is the end of civilization, as you know it, living in denial only empowers the enemy.
[1:02:41.700 --> 1:02:45.700]  If you want to break free from this trance, there's not much time.
[1:02:45.700 --> 1:02:49.700]  Everyone you know that it's a giant hoax, show them the numbers, show them the facts,
[1:02:49.700 --> 1:03:15.700]  and explain that it's the end of the world as we know it if we don't wake up and resist.
[1:03:15.700 --> 1:03:30.700]  Seasons don't feel the reaper, don't fear the reaper folks, you're going to be like they are.
[1:03:30.700 --> 1:03:36.700]  But if you put your mask on and live in fear, and don't take care of your body and believe you're going to die,
[1:03:36.700 --> 1:03:41.700]  all the statistics show you will statistically not live as long.
[1:03:41.700 --> 1:03:46.700]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. We are now into the second hour. I tend to open the phones up starting in the next segment.
[1:03:46.700 --> 1:03:48.700]  I'm going to give the number out in a moment.
[1:03:48.700 --> 1:03:55.700]  There's a very important report on infowars.com and band.video that I hope you get excited about and share if you want to win.
[1:03:55.700 --> 1:03:59.700]  Destroy or be destroyed, Alex Jones, emergency message to Trump.
[1:03:59.700 --> 1:04:08.700]  I came in on Saturday and shot that. They added a whole bunch of articles and documentation and everything I say is right there for people to see.
[1:04:08.700 --> 1:04:13.700]  And I said, you need to come out and say COVID-19 is a hoax.
[1:04:13.700 --> 1:04:18.700]  The contact tracing is a fraud. Almost all the tests are false positive.
[1:04:18.700 --> 1:04:29.700]  If anything, it's a bad pneumonia and that they're putting people from the column, the diet of other things in the column of those that you say diet of COVID.
[1:04:29.700 --> 1:04:36.700]  And the blue states try to turn around and say Trump told them to do this. They have no evidence. I've looked into it deeply.
[1:04:36.700 --> 1:04:44.700]  They follow the UN directive and put COVID patients in nursing homes to actually kill some people because they needed some debt.
[1:04:44.700 --> 1:04:50.700]  Trump goes on the offense. They're going to freak out. They're going to attack him, but it's going to embolden the public and speak out.
[1:04:50.700 --> 1:04:55.700]  And more doctors and more scientists that have already been censored on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are going to come out even more.
[1:04:55.700 --> 1:05:06.700]  And it's going to make the number one issue to show that those behind the COVID-19 power grab ran the Wuhan lab, engineered it so they would own it in the treatment of it into the future.
[1:05:06.700 --> 1:05:10.700]  And other subsequent mutations they control. I'm getting to that next.
[1:05:10.700 --> 1:05:16.700]  But first, in the report, I said, Mr. Trump, President Trump.
[1:05:16.700 --> 1:05:20.700]  And believe me, if the report gets to him, a lot of them do.
[1:05:20.700 --> 1:05:33.700]  Because they try to keep him from seeing my stuff. He specifically looks for messages from Alex Jones. If you send it to the White House email, if you send it to the campaign, if you go out at events and get it to the president, that's what they fear.
[1:05:33.700 --> 1:05:38.700]  He resonates with not just what I say, but with what you say. If he looks into it, it's true.
[1:05:38.700 --> 1:05:43.700]  And I can tell you, he already knows all this.
[1:05:43.700 --> 1:05:47.700]  Trump will go listen to the public and go listen to what they have to say in a speech.
[1:05:47.700 --> 1:05:51.700]  And then if they already agree with him and his gut, he goes with that.
[1:05:51.700 --> 1:05:57.700]  I was watching a documentary that was made a few years ago right when Trump got into office about Trump.
[1:05:57.700 --> 1:06:04.700]  And it ends in the three-part series. I forget the name of it. I watched it on Saturday with Trump saying, oh, you won't be laughing once I actually run for president.
[1:06:04.700 --> 1:06:08.700]  So I'm going to win. And then of course he gets elected president.
[1:06:08.700 --> 1:06:19.700]  And they talk about it, how he's bad, how he went around to tea party events in 2000s, you know, in 2010, 2011, 2012.
[1:06:19.700 --> 1:06:24.700]  He talked about the chai comms and the one-sided trade deals. He talked about the New World Order.
[1:06:24.700 --> 1:06:29.700]  He talked about globalism and he'd get the biggest standing ovations.
[1:06:29.700 --> 1:06:39.700]  And then when Trump got the biggest standing ovations, he decided to go with that with his campaign in 2015.
[1:06:39.700 --> 1:06:43.700]  As if he was a sociopath.
[1:06:43.700 --> 1:06:51.700]  And just because he heard what the people wanted, that's what he then ran on and is doing what he said he did overall.
[1:06:51.700 --> 1:06:57.700]  Well, he could just get the globalists to tell him what to do and he'd do what they want and they'd keep him in power.
[1:06:57.700 --> 1:07:02.700]  No, the fact that he went and said those things that he believed, you resonated with it.
[1:07:02.700 --> 1:07:09.700]  So he ran on it and then as executed, everybody could get done is the sign of a true and faithful servant.
[1:07:09.700 --> 1:07:17.700]  But the documentary filmmakers, they turned it into he's a sociopath because he did what you wanted.
[1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:19.700]  He found out what you wanted.
[1:07:19.700 --> 1:07:24.700]  No, he thought that you resonated with it. He went with it.
[1:07:24.700 --> 1:07:29.700]  I know who was there advising him, Roger Stone.
[1:07:29.700 --> 1:07:34.700]  And that's why some of its libertarians, some of its liberal, most of its conservative populist anti-war.
[1:07:34.700 --> 1:07:37.700]  It's Roger Stone. It's Donald Trump.
[1:07:37.700 --> 1:07:41.700]  Donald Trump was anti-war in 1991. People are attacking for it.
[1:07:41.700 --> 1:07:47.700]  He was anti-war in 2003.
[1:07:47.700 --> 1:07:52.700]  And where's the left? They hate him.
[1:07:52.700 --> 1:07:57.700]  I don't want to go off into a jag about Donald Trump. Here's the big news.
[1:07:57.700 --> 1:08:06.700]  If we don't expose that the response to COVID-19 is a hoax, that the overblown estimates of 2.5 million dead were a total lie,
[1:08:06.700 --> 1:08:12.700]  and that now we're told if we don't get the country locked down, 30,000 will be dead by November.
[1:08:12.700 --> 1:08:18.700]  Well, all they got to do is put numbers of people that have got three conditions who they test positive for in the column.
[1:08:18.700 --> 1:08:22.700]  So I said, Mr. President, you saw me here last hour.
[1:08:22.700 --> 1:08:27.700]  You must attack the fake testing and the fact that Fauci and others even admit that most of them are false positives
[1:08:27.700 --> 1:08:36.700]  that if you have the detritus, the cellular wreckage of beating a corona or flu virus on average within 10 years,
[1:08:36.700 --> 1:08:45.700]  you will show up in the main test as corona virus positive.
[1:08:45.700 --> 1:08:52.700]  Now, remember, two months ago, the FDA shut down Bill and Melinda Gates' funding of hundreds of factories putting out the main test
[1:08:52.700 --> 1:08:55.700]  because they were doing false positives. They turned it back on a few weeks ago.
[1:08:55.700 --> 1:09:00.700]  I didn't even know this until this weekend and sent out over 14 million kits around the United States that came out this weekend.
[1:09:00.700 --> 1:09:04.700]  They turned it on a few weeks ago and 14 million kits.
[1:09:04.700 --> 1:09:07.700]  Now there's 14 million free kits out there.
[1:09:07.700 --> 1:09:10.700]  You think Bill Gates just gave you something free because he likes you?
[1:09:10.700 --> 1:09:20.700]  It's a fake test. And just like you flip the light switch, everybody's got COVID-19, but the deaths are way down.
[1:09:20.700 --> 1:09:26.700]  These articles are on infowars.com. I suggest you get both of them and share the living hell out of them.
[1:09:26.700 --> 1:09:30.700]  We should post in these articles my emergency message to Trump on this.
[1:09:30.700 --> 1:09:35.700]  Ron Paul, who's a medical doctor and very smart. The media is lying about the second wave.
[1:09:35.700 --> 1:09:38.700]  He goes into it. It's a load of crap.
[1:09:38.700 --> 1:09:42.700]  The death count should be the headline, but it's way down, so it's not.
[1:09:42.700 --> 1:09:47.700]  He explains how it's a fraudulent system, and now you cannot trust the test.
[1:09:47.700 --> 1:09:50.700]  Okay, boom, infowars.com. Here's another one.
[1:09:50.700 --> 1:09:55.700]  Ridiculous number. Elon Musk doubts accuracy of COVID-19 test results.
[1:09:55.700 --> 1:09:59.700]  Anyone who tests positive should resist. Billionaire Mogul says.
[1:09:59.700 --> 1:10:02.700]  But why do you have all of these companies?
[1:10:02.700 --> 1:10:11.700]  Their lawyers tell them, oh, you're a factory, you're a packing meatpacking facility.
[1:10:11.700 --> 1:10:15.700]  You're a warehouse. You need to just get everybody tested to make sure everything's taken care of, and then you can quarantine them.
[1:10:15.700 --> 1:10:25.700]  So preemptively, they'll get tested when there's four or five different tests, all of them they admit are a fraud.
[1:10:25.700 --> 1:10:33.700]  And then it's skyrockets, but read the fine print. Again, meatpacking plants across the Midwest.
[1:10:33.700 --> 1:10:36.700]  Some of them had 3,000 employees, 2,000 employees, 1,000 employees.
[1:10:36.700 --> 1:10:44.700]  Depending on the place, but it was always the same type numbers, you would have 1,000 sick out of 3,000, 500 sick out of 2,000.
[1:10:44.700 --> 1:10:50.700]  And in every case, everyone's fine. Everyone is asymptomatic. No one is even sick.
[1:10:50.700 --> 1:11:03.700]  So now they're in the news today going new COVID symptoms, headaches, sneezing, runny noses in the summer with all the plants.
[1:11:03.700 --> 1:11:08.700]  I go out for a hike. My nose runs like a faucet. Oh, I got COVID. Let me run in and get tested.
[1:11:08.700 --> 1:11:13.700]  Oh, the test says you're positive. Let us take you in here and give you some morphine and snake a tube down your throat.
[1:11:13.700 --> 1:11:24.700]  And we're going to kill your ass and we're going to get all that money. And you've got big tech merge with big pharma and big medicine running the scam.
[1:11:24.700 --> 1:11:33.700]  And boy, if you think Republicans are bad, look at Democrat states where all the deaths are because they're all one big stinking mafia, the hospitals, all of it.
[1:11:33.700 --> 1:11:43.700]  I was talking to the former, I'm not going to even say the company. It's a major defense contractor that also does a bunch of other stuff.
[1:11:43.700 --> 1:11:50.700]  And I got the guy's name and stuff and I looked it up and he was who he said he was.
[1:11:50.700 --> 1:12:00.700]  And he said, listen, our company in New York got contracted to build a certain number of these emergency facilities by Trump and Cuomo is on the news.
[1:12:00.700 --> 1:12:06.700]  Remember saying there's nothing here. No one's helping us. But that's a side issue. He said months later because he's now not at the company.
[1:12:06.700 --> 1:12:11.700]  He talked to the director. This guy used to be like the number three at this thing. Okay.
[1:12:11.700 --> 1:12:18.700]  You look his name up. He was like director of global operations. And they said, yeah, it's all the hoax.
[1:12:18.700 --> 1:12:22.700]  They said it's all the hoax.
[1:12:22.700 --> 1:12:26.700]  And I'm about to say his first name. He was even saying I could say his name. I'm going to do it.
[1:12:26.700 --> 1:12:31.700]  Okay, fine. Kelly, they said Kelly, it's all the hoax. All of them are empty.
[1:12:31.700 --> 1:12:38.700]  And they said the other defense contractors that got paid to put these in New York alone, they're all empty. It's all the hoax.
[1:12:38.700 --> 1:12:43.700]  All the hoax. All the hoax. Hospitalships empty. Everything empty.
[1:12:43.700 --> 1:12:50.700]  Nurses all playing tick tock all day. But the bottom line is this, we've got to get all of this information out now.
[1:12:50.700 --> 1:12:57.700]  When I thank the listeners of this broadcast, I'm not patting you on the head. I'm like a person that's been thrown overboard
[1:12:57.700 --> 1:13:03.700]  who finds a life raft to get on or a piece of driftwood. I am clinging to you.
[1:13:03.700 --> 1:13:08.700]  So when you call the show and thank me, listen, I'm thanking you too. We are in this together.
[1:13:08.700 --> 1:13:12.700]  Now I try to bring you things that I know are amazing that have helped me and my family.
[1:13:12.700 --> 1:13:16.700]  So you get a great response. You order again. I treat you like I want to be treated.
[1:13:16.700 --> 1:13:21.700]  It's not a science. It's not a plan. It's just the way to do it. It's just common sense.
[1:13:21.700 --> 1:13:28.700]  And if you get one product, it's bodies. Now our big Fourth of July Supercell is going right now through Fourth of July.
[1:13:28.700 --> 1:13:35.700]  And bodies have been sold out for over three months. It's now back in stock. It is the strongest turmeric concentrate we can find out there.
[1:13:35.700 --> 1:13:39.700]  It may be the strongest on the market. Somebody might have one stronger. We don't know about it or we doubt it.
[1:13:39.700 --> 1:13:46.700]  It is back in stock at 50% off. I want to encourage you all to get bodies, ultimate turmeric formula while you still can.
[1:13:46.700 --> 1:13:51.700]  50% off for the Fourth of July and find the info or info or short.com. My salute and thank you all.
[1:13:51.700 --> 1:13:55.700]  What can I say to the viewers and listeners? Thank you for supporting us. You've done a great job.
[1:13:55.700 --> 1:13:59.700]  We've done amazing things together. The war is now out in the open.
[1:13:59.700 --> 1:14:07.700]  You can see that info wars world vision of who the globalist are and who we are has been very, very accurate.
[1:14:07.700 --> 1:14:13.700]  We're not just some little Hollywood New World Order rabbit trail trying to distract humanity.
[1:14:13.700 --> 1:14:20.700]  We're the zeitgeist and the spirit of liberty together in a symbiotic relationship that believes in humanity.
[1:14:20.700 --> 1:14:24.700]  And we're willing to face the true horror of the New World Order.
[1:14:24.700 --> 1:14:34.700]  But if we do not support the actual transmission center that's getting the messages out from the guests, the callers, the host, we will fail.
[1:14:34.700 --> 1:14:41.700]  I'm staying the obvious here. I just want to thank you on July 4th, 2020 for your support, no matter what color you are or where you came from.
[1:14:41.700 --> 1:14:46.700]  If you love human liberty and freedom, we're brothers and sisters together and I salute and thank you all.
[1:14:46.700 --> 1:15:05.700]  Share those links at band.video and crush the globalist murderers.
[1:15:17.700 --> 1:15:21.700]  You know, I was sitting here during the break. Welcome back here, Alex Jones show.
[1:15:21.700 --> 1:15:32.700]  And the boom operator, hair wolf over there said, Alex, why don't you remind them that just last week, even AP had to report their spiegel had to report.
[1:15:32.700 --> 1:15:40.700]  The Madrid newspaper had to report that a sewage sample from March of last year tested positive for COVID-19.
[1:15:40.700 --> 1:15:46.700]  Here it is, global news, coronavirus traces found a Spanish sewage sample from March 2019.
[1:15:46.700 --> 1:15:58.700]  Well, that's what the Tanzanian president, who by the way is a famous inventor and chemist, biologist as well, he came out a few months ago and said, why are there so many people tested positive?
[1:15:58.700 --> 1:16:09.700]  I noticed that the WHO is funding this. He said, all right, I'm sending a goat and a papaya to the National Laboratory because the National Laboratory there was not corrupt.
[1:16:09.700 --> 1:16:14.700]  I'm going to take him to test and doing the goat and the papaya tested positive.
[1:16:14.700 --> 1:16:21.700]  So then he sent more things there to be tested, including people that were totally healthy.
[1:16:21.700 --> 1:16:29.700]  And guess what? All of them tested positive.
[1:16:29.700 --> 1:16:35.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, coronavirus is the most common virus in the world.
[1:16:35.700 --> 1:16:41.700]  Most of them are harmless. It's everywhere.
[1:16:41.700 --> 1:16:47.700]  And so if you have that, you're going to test positive. And look, I know the listeners know this. I don't mean to be like a parent.
[1:16:47.700 --> 1:16:52.700]  I've got hundreds of articles, 50, 60 incredible video clips, amazing things to cover.
[1:16:52.700 --> 1:16:57.700]  But this is what's causing the global depression. This is what's causing the total shutdown.
[1:16:57.700 --> 1:16:59.700]  This is what's causing the Civil War.
[1:16:59.700 --> 1:17:07.700]  This is what the globalists are pushing and they're still sending old people I learned still doing it.
[1:17:07.700 --> 1:17:16.700]  In Michigan and Pennsylvania and several other states, they're still sending COVID patients to nursing homes.
[1:17:16.700 --> 1:17:21.700]  You go, wait, you said it's a hoax. No, people with pneumonia, people with the flu.
[1:17:21.700 --> 1:17:27.700]  They go, oh, you test positive for COVID. So they send them in. You don't go see grandma when you've got the flu.
[1:17:27.700 --> 1:17:33.700]  So they get dead people. These are some cold-blooded folks.
[1:17:33.700 --> 1:17:38.700]  You feel safe with them taking the country over? I mean, I'm just desperate to beat these people.
[1:17:38.700 --> 1:17:42.700]  I'm desperate to have you wake up and get pissed at them and just run around warning everybody.
[1:17:42.700 --> 1:17:45.700]  And let me tell you, we're close to this.
[1:17:45.700 --> 1:17:51.700]  I told you I want a vacation a week and a half ago to the coast, the Gulf of Mexico.
[1:17:51.700 --> 1:18:02.700]  Nothing fancy and they had a hotel, nice place. And I went out in the surf and I went to the restaurants and the bars and into the grocery stores and to the CVS and everywhere.
[1:18:02.700 --> 1:18:06.700]  And people were just all over saying the master BS COVID-19's a hoax.
[1:18:06.700 --> 1:18:09.700]  They're counting regular dead people from other things in it.
[1:18:09.700 --> 1:18:14.700]  And the good news was almost none of them knew who I was.
[1:18:14.700 --> 1:18:16.700]  That means they're not even getting it from us.
[1:18:16.700 --> 1:18:23.700]  It's so known now that, and they'd also add, by the way, the Democrats are pedophiles.
[1:18:23.700 --> 1:18:29.700]  I was told that probably 300 times.
[1:18:29.700 --> 1:18:32.700]  And of course, it's true it's coming out.
[1:18:32.700 --> 1:18:35.700]  And for those of us that aren't sick and evil like this, we just can't believe it.
[1:18:35.700 --> 1:18:37.700]  Believe me, I can't believe this.
[1:18:37.700 --> 1:18:42.700]  I've probably learned this stuff. I knew a lot of stuff 20 years ago, 25 years ago when I first got on air.
[1:18:42.700 --> 1:18:46.700]  But man, the more I learned over those years, I mean, I kind of went crazy.
[1:18:46.700 --> 1:18:50.700]  I know it's crazy. I know you don't want to believe it. I don't want to believe it, but it's all true.
[1:18:50.700 --> 1:18:55.700]  World government, devil worship, pedophilia, depopulation.
[1:18:55.700 --> 1:19:03.700]  I've got articles right here, Associated Press, China forcibly sterilizing the Uighurs.
[1:19:03.700 --> 1:19:06.700]  Three million of them are in concentration camps.
[1:19:06.700 --> 1:19:12.700]  And by the way, I don't like Islam invading my country and telling me to do Sharia law, but I don't like killing Muslims.
[1:19:12.700 --> 1:19:15.700]  And these are Muslims that haven't been expansive or taken over.
[1:19:15.700 --> 1:19:18.700]  And they're really ethnic Chinese.
[1:19:18.700 --> 1:19:21.700]  They've been Muslims for over a thousand years.
[1:19:21.700 --> 1:19:24.700]  And China's just testing out on them what they do to their own people.
[1:19:24.700 --> 1:19:29.700]  China sterilizes Chinese, too, on their main country area.
[1:19:29.700 --> 1:19:31.700]  But again, where's the left on that?
[1:19:31.700 --> 1:19:32.700]  It's so monstrous.
[1:19:32.700 --> 1:19:40.700]  What the good news is, Elon Musk, Dr. Ron Paul, everybody's coming out saying it's a hoax. It's a hoax.
[1:19:40.700 --> 1:19:47.700]  Oh, let me tell you, Governor Newsom is presiding over the collapse of California.
[1:19:47.700 --> 1:19:48.700]  He hopes it's the whole country.
[1:19:48.700 --> 1:19:57.700]  I can tell you that without even asking, I have been called by more than 20 prominent major entertainers,
[1:19:57.700 --> 1:20:05.700]  major Hollywood people, major top podcasters.
[1:20:05.700 --> 1:20:08.700]  And did you know that they're already in Austin?
[1:20:08.700 --> 1:20:12.700]  They're not leaving LA.
[1:20:12.700 --> 1:20:15.700]  They already left.
[1:20:15.700 --> 1:20:20.700]  Studios might look the same, but they're gone.
[1:20:20.700 --> 1:20:23.700]  Elon Musk already lives outside Austin.
[1:20:23.700 --> 1:20:27.700]  All of them, they're gone, and everybody that works with them is leaving.
[1:20:27.700 --> 1:20:31.700]  And he is moving Tesla to out by the airport in Austin.
[1:20:31.700 --> 1:20:34.700]  They're moving it all, folks.
[1:20:34.700 --> 1:20:36.700]  And you know what the final straw was?
[1:20:36.700 --> 1:20:39.700]  Making everybody wear a mask.
[1:20:39.700 --> 1:20:41.700]  Let me tell you something.
[1:20:41.700 --> 1:20:45.700]  These people used to be on the fence all of them, but they got kids.
[1:20:45.700 --> 1:20:47.700]  And they know the truth now.
[1:20:47.700 --> 1:20:49.700]  And they listen to this show.
[1:20:49.700 --> 1:20:55.700]  So my job, and this is something key here, is to become obsolete.
[1:20:55.700 --> 1:20:58.700]  There'll always be work to do, and I'll try to keep the crew employed around here.
[1:20:58.700 --> 1:21:01.700]  But a little secret.
[1:21:01.700 --> 1:21:06.700]  About five years ago, I decided to stop doing my show and just make a film a year.
[1:21:06.700 --> 1:21:08.700]  Maybe write a book.
[1:21:08.700 --> 1:21:12.700]  Because I realize that your life just goes by so fast for you this every day when you work 14 hours a day.
[1:21:12.700 --> 1:21:16.700]  And I just want to rediscover myself and do a lot of things.
[1:21:16.700 --> 1:21:21.700]  And I had made the decision before Trump really came along that I was going to quietly start bowing out.
[1:21:21.700 --> 1:21:24.700]  I had about a three-year plan.
[1:21:24.700 --> 1:21:27.700]  And a lot of that was the divorce I had with my ex-wife and just all of it.
[1:21:27.700 --> 1:21:29.700]  And I just wanted to do something nobody would expect me to do.
[1:21:29.700 --> 1:21:30.700]  They persecuted me.
[1:21:30.700 --> 1:21:31.700]  They sued me.
[1:21:31.700 --> 1:21:32.700]  They attacked me.
[1:21:32.700 --> 1:21:33.700]  They death-threaded me.
[1:21:33.700 --> 1:21:34.700]  They said, they'll kill me if I don't stop.
[1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:35.700]  So now I'm not going to stop.
[1:21:35.700 --> 1:21:37.700]  See how that works?
[1:21:37.700 --> 1:21:41.700]  But my mission is to become obsolete.
[1:21:41.700 --> 1:21:45.700]  I want this information to be so well-known, so ubiquitous,
[1:21:45.700 --> 1:21:51.700]  so over-the-counter that Alex Jones is obsolete.
[1:21:51.700 --> 1:21:58.700]  And I can tell you, it's accelerating towards that point that whether we win, lose, or draw on this election,
[1:21:58.700 --> 1:22:01.700]  that might accelerate the awakening even quicker if Trump loses.
[1:22:01.700 --> 1:22:02.700]  It's going to be spectacular.
[1:22:02.700 --> 1:22:03.700]  It's going to be explosive.
[1:22:03.700 --> 1:22:13.700]  But awakening to this general knowledge is going to become so mainstream that within one year I may be obsolete,
[1:22:13.700 --> 1:22:14.700]  which is my goal.
[1:22:14.700 --> 1:22:18.700]  And these sociopaths and globalists, they just can't even get into that mindset.
[1:22:18.700 --> 1:22:29.700]  They don't even know how much I just want to go live in the mountains and have a farm and paint and do artwork and go fishing.
[1:22:29.700 --> 1:22:32.700]  I get so high out in nature.
[1:22:32.700 --> 1:22:34.700]  I get so high out in the mountains.
[1:22:34.700 --> 1:22:38.700]  I just get so high when I'm snorkeling around in the Caribbean.
[1:22:38.700 --> 1:22:44.700]  It's like a form of worship to look at Bill Gates and look at Hillary and have to fight him.
[1:22:44.700 --> 1:22:51.700]  I selfishly just want to win, or at least look, I've done my mission so I can stop.
[1:22:51.700 --> 1:22:53.700]  But see, they won't let you do that, will they?
[1:22:53.700 --> 1:22:55.700]  So they're going to get my full attack.
[1:22:55.700 --> 1:22:59.700]  Then I'm going to burn with everything I've got and go down this path.
[1:22:59.700 --> 1:23:05.700]  I know that it's so disruptive for myself and my family and my body.
[1:23:05.700 --> 1:23:09.700]  Because they just don't know when to quit, do they?
[1:23:09.700 --> 1:23:11.700]  So now I'm going to destroy you, Bill Gates.
[1:23:11.700 --> 1:23:14.700]  I'm going to destroy you, Hillary.
[1:23:14.700 --> 1:23:18.700]  So come get me.
[1:23:18.700 --> 1:23:24.700]  Come get me because you're going to find it's the opposite of what you think.
[1:23:24.700 --> 1:23:29.700]  Because I've got my tentacles wrapped all around your neck.
[1:23:29.700 --> 1:23:33.700]  And right when you bite down on me every time you feel it, don't you?
[1:23:33.700 --> 1:23:35.700]  Because when you crush me, you crush yourself.
[1:23:35.700 --> 1:23:37.700]  And that's my mission.
[1:23:37.700 --> 1:23:39.700]  I might as well just embrace it.
[1:23:39.700 --> 1:23:41.700]  I'm not going to get out of this alive.
[1:23:41.700 --> 1:23:43.700]  But our children might.
[1:23:43.700 --> 1:23:45.700]  We'll get the number out and take your calls.
[1:23:45.700 --> 1:23:49.700]  We return. Stay with us.
[1:23:49.700 --> 1:23:56.700]  2020 is a very special year to the globalists, to the occultists, to those that are into esoteric mysticism.
[1:23:56.700 --> 1:24:00.700]  And they believe this is the year they're going to totally overthrow America and the world
[1:24:00.700 --> 1:24:03.700]  and bring in their anti-God, anti-human tyranny.
[1:24:03.700 --> 1:24:05.700]  Well, we're here on air.
[1:24:05.700 --> 1:24:08.700]  And we just ask you all to realize that we're in opposition to this evil.

[1:27:19.700 --> 1:27:21.700]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:27:21.700 --> 1:27:24.700]  and I need to give the number out to take your calls ahead of Stuart Rhodes,
[1:27:24.700 --> 1:27:30.700]  founder of O.K. for simply joining us in the last 45 minutes of the next hour
[1:27:30.700 --> 1:27:33.700]  to break down the horrible, evil criminal, in my view,
[1:27:33.700 --> 1:27:39.700]  false flag of the anti-American, globalist, anti-free speech kingpin,
[1:27:39.700 --> 1:27:42.700]  Sasha Baron, ADL frontman Cohen.
[1:27:42.700 --> 1:27:47.700]  So that's coming up again Alex Jones here back live.
[1:27:47.700 --> 1:27:51.700]  I want to give the number out, the number to talk about the Civil War we're in.
[1:27:51.700 --> 1:27:52.700]  Let's just not lie to ourselves.
[1:27:52.700 --> 1:27:56.700]  This is a civil war between American patriots and globalist traders.
[1:27:56.700 --> 1:27:58.700]  This is not North against South.
[1:27:58.700 --> 1:28:04.700]  This is globalist traders trying to bankrupt and bring down the whole country.
[1:28:04.700 --> 1:28:08.700]  Everyone should choose the right side and re-embrace
[1:28:08.700 --> 1:28:12.700]  the Declaration of Independence Constitution Bill of Rights and what made this country great.
[1:28:12.700 --> 1:28:14.700]  It is a suicide pact.
[1:28:14.700 --> 1:28:22.700]  It is an idiotic nihilistic exercise in total self-destruction
[1:28:22.700 --> 1:28:26.700]  to not be for the American Republic compared to what they're trying to give us.
[1:28:26.700 --> 1:28:34.700]  There was some global Swiss operation that had even better Constitution Bill of Rights
[1:28:34.700 --> 1:28:38.700]  and it was coming here and had all this investment money and super technology
[1:28:38.700 --> 1:28:41.700]  and had proven itself with other countries building them up.
[1:28:41.700 --> 1:28:45.700]  They say, well, I'll marry you. We'll merge with you.
[1:28:45.700 --> 1:28:50.700]  I mean, if something's better, I'll go for it immediately.
[1:28:50.700 --> 1:28:57.700]  This is the New World Order anti-human poison operation.
[1:28:57.700 --> 1:29:01.700]  It's just mind-blowing to have all this going on.
[1:29:01.700 --> 1:29:10.700]  So for me, the biggest problem is knowing the facts
[1:29:10.700 --> 1:29:14.700]  of how ignorant the left is and how the dumbing down process has been so successful
[1:29:14.700 --> 1:29:18.700]  and it's like you're talking to people that are pouring gasoline on themselves
[1:29:18.700 --> 1:29:22.700]  and lighting themselves on fire.
[1:29:22.700 --> 1:29:25.700]  And then they're telling you that it's your fault
[1:29:25.700 --> 1:29:30.700]  and they play this anti-foot communist game where they call you a Nazi
[1:29:30.700 --> 1:29:32.700]  so they can come shoplifting your store.
[1:29:32.700 --> 1:29:35.700]  Where they call you a Nazi. They don't even know who you are.
[1:29:35.700 --> 1:29:40.700]  They call you a big house so they go through your gate in your front yard
[1:29:40.700 --> 1:29:45.700]  and start freaking out at people.
[1:29:45.700 --> 1:29:50.700]  But this is what the left and the universities have created.
[1:29:50.700 --> 1:29:52.700]  And so we have to be honest with ourselves about it
[1:29:52.700 --> 1:29:54.700]  and what do you think we should do to counter it?
[1:29:54.700 --> 1:29:58.700]  What do you think President Trump should do to respond to it?
[1:29:58.700 --> 1:30:02.700]  I can tell you, you can debate whether he should have a strong hand against these rioters or not.
[1:30:02.700 --> 1:30:05.700]  They're not going so they don't get to be the victims they want to be.
[1:30:05.700 --> 1:30:08.700]  It's a clear adjuprop which is a communist tactic where you go out
[1:30:08.700 --> 1:30:11.700]  and you stage the thing against the police and the public
[1:30:11.700 --> 1:30:13.700]  hoping that they hurt some innocent people.
[1:30:13.700 --> 1:30:16.700]  Because in a war, eggs get cracked.
[1:30:16.700 --> 1:30:19.700]  Things get broken.
[1:30:19.700 --> 1:30:22.700]  There's collateral damage. There's mistakes that are made.
[1:30:22.700 --> 1:30:24.700]  That's why we don't like war.
[1:30:24.700 --> 1:30:26.700]  And that's what civil war is, is a form of war.
[1:30:26.700 --> 1:30:29.700]  When you call the police in, you're calling force in.
[1:30:29.700 --> 1:30:32.700]  There's a video up on infowars.com
[1:30:32.700 --> 1:30:36.700]  of Black Lives Matter individual attacking an old white man.
[1:30:36.700 --> 1:30:40.700]  The old white man starts kicking the younger black guys butt.
[1:30:40.700 --> 1:30:46.700]  And so he runs and calls the police on them.
[1:30:46.700 --> 1:30:48.700]  This again is the death of logic.
[1:30:48.700 --> 1:30:51.700]  If you're calling for getting rid of the police, you want to say you want to kill the police,
[1:30:51.700 --> 1:30:54.700]  then when you go hit an old white dude in the back of the head
[1:30:54.700 --> 1:30:57.700]  and he chases you and starts beating you up, you don't call the police.
[1:30:57.700 --> 1:31:00.700]  With the left, there is no logic, folks.
[1:31:00.700 --> 1:31:02.700]  It's like George Soros said on 60 Minutes,
[1:31:02.700 --> 1:31:05.700]  the best time of his life was being a Nazi collaborator.
[1:31:05.700 --> 1:31:08.700]  And they go, we don't care, Nazi, shut up.
[1:31:08.700 --> 1:31:15.700]  Because to them, it's the empowerment of having no logic.
[1:31:15.700 --> 1:31:18.700]  So the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALIX,
[1:31:18.700 --> 1:31:22.700]  877-789-2539, 877-789-ALIX,
[1:31:22.700 --> 1:31:24.700]  877-789-2539.
[1:31:24.700 --> 1:31:28.700]  And it's longtime callers, first-time callers, it is a free-for-all.
[1:31:28.700 --> 1:31:30.700]  Let me get to some of these clips because I mentioned them.
[1:31:30.700 --> 1:31:32.700]  This has been out, you know, for a couple of days.
[1:31:32.700 --> 1:31:34.700]  And the media is defending this.
[1:31:34.700 --> 1:31:37.700]  MSNBC, I saw it last night.
[1:31:37.700 --> 1:31:41.700]  Oh, BLM's just going into Target, a leftist group,
[1:31:41.700 --> 1:31:44.700]  and I will capitulate and say, we're going to keep coming in here
[1:31:44.700 --> 1:31:48.700]  until you don't call the police when a couple hundred people come in
[1:31:48.700 --> 1:31:50.700]  and start breaking stuff and stealing stuff.
[1:31:50.700 --> 1:31:52.700]  Here's the video.
[1:31:52.700 --> 1:31:59.700]  On black people, on black people, on black people,
[1:31:59.700 --> 1:32:07.700]  living around this neighborhood, living around this neighborhood,
[1:32:07.700 --> 1:32:13.700]  just to prioritize money over people.
[1:32:13.700 --> 1:32:19.700]  So until you stop calling the police,
[1:32:19.700 --> 1:32:24.700]  you're going to shut your business down.
[1:32:24.700 --> 1:32:26.700]  All right, and we're going to get this bleep.
[1:32:26.700 --> 1:32:28.700]  I really wanted to start the show with this today,
[1:32:28.700 --> 1:32:30.700]  but it's not bleep, so I can't play the audio,
[1:32:30.700 --> 1:32:33.700]  which means radio listeners can't hear it.
[1:32:33.700 --> 1:32:38.700]  But this is in St. Louis at the Rich Democrat Lawyer's House
[1:32:38.700 --> 1:32:40.700]  that the idiot left goes to.
[1:32:40.700 --> 1:32:43.700]  They go through the private gate, they open it up,
[1:32:43.700 --> 1:32:46.700]  they go and there's another sign saying this is a private estate,
[1:32:46.700 --> 1:32:49.700]  and they say, we have freedom, these are our streets,
[1:32:49.700 --> 1:32:52.700]  and the guy comes out with a gun knowing this mob's getting ready
[1:32:52.700 --> 1:32:56.700]  to attack his museum house, his McMansion.
[1:32:56.700 --> 1:32:59.700]  Obviously, he went and bought one of the old classic houses there
[1:32:59.700 --> 1:33:01.700]  in St. Louis.
[1:33:01.700 --> 1:33:03.700]  To actually buy all those houses is pretty cheap,
[1:33:03.700 --> 1:33:05.700]  as long as you agree to take care of them with historical societies.
[1:33:05.700 --> 1:33:07.700]  They are a real pain in the butt, though,
[1:33:07.700 --> 1:33:09.700]  have a lot of maintenance problems.
[1:33:09.700 --> 1:33:11.700]  You can see them out there saying, get off my property.
[1:33:11.700 --> 1:33:14.700]  This goes on for 30 minutes, and they're cussing and screaming
[1:33:14.700 --> 1:33:16.700]  and calling him names because he's white.
[1:33:16.700 --> 1:33:19.700]  And then finally, they get up on his front porch in his face,
[1:33:19.700 --> 1:33:21.700]  and he says, I'm going to shoot you.
[1:33:21.700 --> 1:33:23.700]  And then they run off and call the police on him,
[1:33:23.700 --> 1:33:25.700]  saying he illegally had a gun,
[1:33:25.700 --> 1:33:27.700]  and that they were just walking down a city street.
[1:33:27.700 --> 1:33:31.700]  He only went past two, no trespassing areas,
[1:33:31.700 --> 1:33:36.700]  and did the rest of it.
[1:33:36.700 --> 1:33:41.700]  So, folks, this is what it's coming to, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:33:41.700 --> 1:33:44.700]  This is what our country's turned to.
[1:33:44.700 --> 1:33:46.700]  And then they say on the audio, they go,
[1:33:46.700 --> 1:33:48.700]  I mean, all the videos are posted at infowars.com.
[1:33:48.700 --> 1:33:51.700]  Video shows armed residents defending luxurious homes from BLM mom.
[1:33:51.700 --> 1:33:53.700]  They say, it's all right, the white leader does.
[1:33:53.700 --> 1:33:57.700]  We got the money shot,
[1:33:57.700 --> 1:33:59.700]  which is white people with guns,
[1:33:59.700 --> 1:34:01.700]  and they went and lied and said,
[1:34:01.700 --> 1:34:03.700]  we were just walking down a city street,
[1:34:03.700 --> 1:34:05.700]  and they attacked us,
[1:34:05.700 --> 1:34:07.700]  and the newspaper knew full well where it was,
[1:34:07.700 --> 1:34:10.700]  and went along with it and saw the TV station.
[1:34:10.700 --> 1:34:13.700]  Here, let's go off the road, off the sidewalk,
[1:34:13.700 --> 1:34:15.700]  into somebody's private gate.
[1:34:15.700 --> 1:34:17.700]  You came and drive a car through there.
[1:34:17.700 --> 1:34:19.700]  It's a little metal gate,
[1:34:19.700 --> 1:34:24.700]  and now they're at the people's estate on their property.
[1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:28.700]  They're in their backyard on their sidewalk,
[1:34:28.700 --> 1:34:31.700]  screaming, this is our streets.
[1:34:31.700 --> 1:34:33.700]  And he's saying, get off my property,
[1:34:33.700 --> 1:34:36.700]  get off my property, get off my property,
[1:34:36.700 --> 1:34:38.700]  get off my property, get off my property,
[1:34:38.700 --> 1:34:41.700]  until they get up on the steps in his face.
[1:34:41.700 --> 1:34:45.700]  Let me tell you, these are some brave people paid to do this,
[1:34:45.700 --> 1:34:49.700]  because they're waiting for somebody to shoot him.
[1:34:49.700 --> 1:34:52.700]  If this had been the cops,
[1:34:52.700 --> 1:34:54.700]  and it was somebody's private property they were defending,
[1:34:54.700 --> 1:34:55.700]  the cops would have tasered him,
[1:34:55.700 --> 1:34:58.700]  and then you would have seen, oh my God, they attacked the police.
[1:34:58.700 --> 1:35:00.700]  This is the attack on private property.
[1:35:00.700 --> 1:35:07.700]  That is what every single bit of this is about.
[1:35:07.700 --> 1:35:10.700]  We're going to go to break, come back with your calls.
[1:35:10.700 --> 1:35:13.700]  We're going to place Savannah Hernandez being attacked this weekend.
[1:35:13.700 --> 1:35:16.700]  We're holding up a sign they had a Black Lives Matter event,
[1:35:16.700 --> 1:35:18.700]  so she went down by city council,
[1:35:18.700 --> 1:35:21.700]  and held up her sign that said police lives matter,
[1:35:21.700 --> 1:35:25.700]  and the name of the black police officer, Dorn,
[1:35:25.700 --> 1:35:30.700]  shot and killed again in St. Louis for protecting property,
[1:35:30.700 --> 1:35:33.700]  died to pull a blood.
[1:35:33.700 --> 1:35:36.700]  The Black Lives Matter says you don't talk about David Dorn,
[1:35:36.700 --> 1:35:40.700]  and they come up and attack a woman with a sign for a dead police officer,
[1:35:40.700 --> 1:35:44.700]  and the Hispanic woman tells her, suck mine, you know what,
[1:35:44.700 --> 1:35:47.700]  and just acts like a total thug idiot,
[1:35:47.700 --> 1:35:50.700]  and then keeps attacking with these other bizarre leptis
[1:35:50.700 --> 1:35:55.700]  that look like they escaped from mental institutions.
[1:35:55.700 --> 1:36:00.700]  But that, ladies and gentlemen, is who these people are.
[1:36:00.700 --> 1:36:03.700]  So I ask you again, what are we going to do with this civil war?
[1:36:03.700 --> 1:36:06.700]  Because they're trying to get shootings going.
[1:36:06.700 --> 1:36:09.700]  They're saying that people are hanging nooses up when they're not.
[1:36:09.700 --> 1:36:12.700]  Sasha Barakohan is lying about who he is coming to an event
[1:36:12.700 --> 1:36:14.700]  with his own security, who have guns,
[1:36:14.700 --> 1:36:16.700]  so that when he starts saying racist stuff,
[1:36:16.700 --> 1:36:18.700]  they can't stop him so he can frame him.
[1:36:18.700 --> 1:36:20.700]  That is criminal evil.
[1:36:20.700 --> 1:36:24.700]  And then he's all sick and really like vampirish at the 80s,
[1:36:24.700 --> 1:36:27.700]  if you do not let us run you and suck down your speech,
[1:36:27.700 --> 1:36:28.700]  we will arrest you.
[1:36:28.700 --> 1:36:30.700]  We will take over the media and arrest everyone
[1:36:30.700 --> 1:36:32.700]  in this real creepy voice.
[1:36:32.700 --> 1:36:34.700]  And it's just so evil his eyes are electric.
[1:36:34.700 --> 1:36:36.700]  And then he's like, oh, let him have his free speech.
[1:36:36.700 --> 1:36:38.700]  Oh, they just can't have a sense of humor.
[1:36:38.700 --> 1:36:40.700]  He is a monster and a criminal.
[1:36:40.700 --> 1:36:43.700]  That man will destroy America if he can't.
[1:36:43.700 --> 1:36:45.700]  Look at it, he thinks he's better than you.
[1:36:45.700 --> 1:36:46.700]  He's not.
[1:36:46.700 --> 1:37:13.700]  You'll burn in hell.
[1:37:16.700 --> 1:37:17.700]  It's just the way to do it.
[1:37:17.700 --> 1:37:18.700]  It's just common sense.
[1:37:18.700 --> 1:37:21.700]  And if you get one product, it's bodies.
[1:37:21.700 --> 1:37:23.700]  Now, our big Fourth of July Supercell
[1:37:23.700 --> 1:37:25.700]  is going right now through Fourth of July.
[1:37:25.700 --> 1:37:27.700]  And bodies have been sold out for over three months.

[1:37:29.700 --> 1:37:32.700]  It is the strongest tumeric concentrate we can find out there.
[1:37:32.700 --> 1:37:34.700]  It may be the strongest on the market.
[1:37:34.700 --> 1:37:35.700]  Somebody might have one stronger.
[1:37:35.700 --> 1:37:36.700]  We don't know about it or we dab it.
[1:37:36.700 --> 1:37:38.700]  It is back in stock at 50% off.
[1:37:38.700 --> 1:37:40.700]  I want to encourage you all to get bodies,
[1:37:40.700 --> 1:37:42.700]  ultimate tumeric formula while you still can,
[1:37:42.700 --> 1:37:44.700]  50% off for the Fourth of July,
[1:37:44.700 --> 1:37:46.700]  and find the info war at infowarstore.com.
[1:37:46.700 --> 1:37:48.700]  My salute and thank you all.
[1:37:48.700 --> 1:37:51.700]  The Fourth of July, 2020.
[1:37:51.700 --> 1:37:53.700]  We are here.
[1:37:53.700 --> 1:37:55.700]  And despite all the globalist attacks,
[1:37:55.700 --> 1:37:57.700]  you, the viewers and listeners of this transmission,
[1:37:57.700 --> 1:38:00.700]  have supported us by prayer, by word of mouth,
[1:38:00.700 --> 1:38:02.700]  and by buying the products.
[1:38:02.700 --> 1:38:04.700]  And you have done all of this.
[1:38:04.700 --> 1:38:07.700]  So when you look at the huge effect info wars has had,
[1:38:07.700 --> 1:38:12.700]  I want you to understand that it's because of what you have done.
[1:38:12.700 --> 1:38:15.700]  And myself and the whole crew salute you
[1:38:15.700 --> 1:38:18.700]  on this July 4th, 2020.
[1:38:18.700 --> 1:38:20.700]  We've got a lot of our best selling products
[1:38:20.700 --> 1:38:21.700]  that were sold out.
[1:38:21.700 --> 1:38:24.700]  DNA Force Plus, bodies, Ultra 12,
[1:38:24.700 --> 1:38:26.700]  and others that have been sold out for months.
[1:38:26.700 --> 1:38:30.700]  Back in stock, 50% off for the Fourth of July.
[1:38:30.700 --> 1:38:31.700]  We're running a special.
[1:38:31.700 --> 1:38:33.700]  I want to encourage you to get these products
[1:38:33.700 --> 1:38:35.700]  because they have enriched my life so much.
[1:38:35.700 --> 1:38:37.700]  I know they'll enrich your life.
[1:38:37.700 --> 1:38:39.700]  And regardless, it's a total 360 win
[1:38:39.700 --> 1:38:41.700]  because it funds the info war.
[1:38:41.700 --> 1:38:44.700]  The only way we fail is when you don't take action.
[1:38:44.700 --> 1:38:45.700]  I don't need to tell you that.
[1:38:45.700 --> 1:38:46.700]  You already took action.
[1:38:46.700 --> 1:39:15.700]  And I salute and thank you.
[1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:18.700]  And I think down the road, they'll be defeated.
[1:39:18.700 --> 1:39:22.700]  But we are going to still go down the hard road now.
[1:39:22.700 --> 1:39:24.700]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down.
[1:39:24.700 --> 1:39:26.700]  But we've mitigated some of this,
[1:39:26.700 --> 1:39:28.700]  but it's still going to be bad, my view.
[1:39:28.700 --> 1:39:30.700]  You need to get high quality, affordable food.
[1:39:30.700 --> 1:39:31.700]  It's something you need.
[1:39:31.700 --> 1:39:33.700]  We have high quality ready to get out to you.
[1:39:33.700 --> 1:39:35.700]  And it supports the broadcast and 360 wins.
[1:39:35.700 --> 1:39:37.700]  So please take care of your storeable foods needs
[1:39:37.700 --> 1:39:40.700]  at infowarstore.com and get your orders in now
[1:39:40.700 --> 1:39:42.700]  so you get it, so you have it.
[1:39:42.700 --> 1:39:43.700]  It's in great containers, high quality.
[1:39:43.700 --> 1:39:45.700]  Last 25 years, get it while you can
[1:39:45.700 --> 1:39:47.700]  because if you think things are about to let up,
[1:39:47.700 --> 1:39:49.700]  you ain't seen nothing yet.
[1:39:49.700 --> 1:39:51.700]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[1:39:51.700 --> 1:39:53.700]  You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:39:53.700 --> 1:39:54.700]  Hello. Can you hear me?
[1:39:54.700 --> 1:39:55.700]  I sure can, sir. Thank you.
[1:39:55.700 --> 1:39:58.700]  Hey, Alex. Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro.
[1:39:58.700 --> 1:40:01.700]  And it's a pleasure to be talking right now.
[1:40:01.700 --> 1:40:03.700]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[1:40:03.700 --> 1:40:05.700]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut.
[1:40:05.700 --> 1:40:07.700]  And I just want to plug in.
[1:40:07.700 --> 1:40:08.700]  I'm a truck driver.
[1:40:08.700 --> 1:40:11.700]  And two before us have changed the way I drive.
[1:40:11.700 --> 1:40:13.700]  Me and my brothers that drive,
[1:40:13.700 --> 1:40:18.700]  a couple of us, we are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[1:40:18.700 --> 1:40:22.700]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla
[1:40:22.700 --> 1:40:25.700]  and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar
[1:40:25.700 --> 1:40:27.700]  and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[1:40:27.700 --> 1:40:28.700]  Well, brother, we put more in this
[1:40:28.700 --> 1:40:32.700]  than any other long-term, high quality energy powder there is.
[1:40:32.700 --> 1:40:35.700]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[1:40:35.700 --> 1:40:36.700]  He didn't want his name on it
[1:40:36.700 --> 1:40:37.700]  because obviously the political issues,
[1:40:37.700 --> 1:40:39.700]  but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation
[1:40:39.700 --> 1:40:40.700]  just for the design of it.
[1:40:40.700 --> 1:40:44.700]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there
[1:40:44.700 --> 1:40:46.700]  and you're saying that it's made your life better,
[1:40:46.700 --> 1:40:47.700]  so that means a lot to me. Thank you.
[1:40:47.700 --> 1:40:49.700]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[1:40:49.700 --> 1:41:15.700]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:41:15.700 --> 1:41:18.700]  Welcome back. You're listening to The Alex Jones Show
[1:41:18.700 --> 1:41:19.700]  and I am your host.
[1:41:19.700 --> 1:41:21.700]  We're on your phone calls right now.
[1:41:21.700 --> 1:41:23.700]  We're going to take calls for about 30 minutes or so
[1:41:23.700 --> 1:41:26.700]  and then Stuart Rhodes, good friend of mine,
[1:41:26.700 --> 1:41:29.700]  smart guy, patriot, veteran constitutional lawyer,
[1:41:29.700 --> 1:41:32.700]  never talks about that, but he knows his stuff.
[1:41:32.700 --> 1:41:35.700]  We're going to get into this civil war that's already here.
[1:41:35.700 --> 1:41:40.700]  Sasha Barakowan is just such a horrible person.
[1:41:40.700 --> 1:41:43.700]  Now he goes around setting people up and calling it pranks.
[1:41:43.700 --> 1:41:47.700]  Then he says they're racist on TV after he sets them up.
[1:41:47.700 --> 1:41:52.700]  And then he has armed men there when they try to stop
[1:41:52.700 --> 1:41:56.700]  and get off the stage so he can finish it up to then frame them.
[1:41:56.700 --> 1:42:00.700]  He'll sing for seven minutes at one song about
[1:42:00.700 --> 1:42:03.700]  throw the commie down the well.
[1:42:03.700 --> 1:42:07.700]  Oh, you know, give the evil new world order their own COVID.
[1:42:07.700 --> 1:42:09.700]  And then all of a sudden he starts saying,
[1:42:09.700 --> 1:42:11.700]  and then we get the Jews at the end.
[1:42:11.700 --> 1:42:13.700]  They're like, no, no, no, then we get the Chinese.
[1:42:13.700 --> 1:42:14.700]  We kill them.
[1:42:14.700 --> 1:42:15.700]  They're like, no, we don't agree.
[1:42:15.700 --> 1:42:17.700]  He has armed men there to stop him.
[1:42:17.700 --> 1:42:19.700]  So he can still edit it, still put it out.
[1:42:19.700 --> 1:42:25.700]  And the news dutifully covers all that up.
[1:42:25.700 --> 1:42:28.700]  Then he went and dressed up like a militia leader
[1:42:28.700 --> 1:42:31.700]  and came back in trying to agree with the racism
[1:42:31.700 --> 1:42:34.700]  so he can be both ends of it.
[1:42:34.700 --> 1:42:36.700]  It's just he's smaller.
[1:42:36.700 --> 1:42:41.700]  And he's just such a sick, slimy predator.
[1:42:41.700 --> 1:42:43.700]  And all the clips of him saying,
[1:42:43.700 --> 1:42:46.700]  he wants to arrest me and arrest you and arrest everyone.
[1:42:46.700 --> 1:42:50.700]  He wants to put us in jails for our views,
[1:42:50.700 --> 1:42:53.700]  which he's going to lie about us and put us in jail.
[1:42:53.700 --> 1:42:56.700]  What a dangerous evil man.
[1:42:56.700 --> 1:42:57.700]  He's a sociopath.
[1:42:57.700 --> 1:43:02.700]  He has absolutely nothing but a crazed will to dominate you.
[1:43:02.700 --> 1:43:04.700]  And he knows you have a conscience.
[1:43:04.700 --> 1:43:08.700]  So he goes, be my friend, don't be racist, but he's the racist.
[1:43:08.700 --> 1:43:15.700]  He's the supremacist.
[1:43:15.700 --> 1:43:19.700]  Unbelievable.
[1:43:19.700 --> 1:43:21.700]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[1:43:21.700 --> 1:43:24.700]  We've got Resistance and Chris, Justin, Manny and Lyle
[1:43:24.700 --> 1:43:29.700]  and DJ and John and Dave and Mike and Shannon.
[1:43:29.700 --> 1:43:32.700]  Let's go ahead and talk to Justin in Ohio.
[1:43:32.700 --> 1:43:35.700]  What's your view on the Civil War, police versus the mob,
[1:43:35.700 --> 1:43:36.700]  COVID data?
[1:43:36.700 --> 1:43:38.700]  Yeah, so real quick,
[1:43:38.700 --> 1:43:41.700]  I just wanted to throw out this one fact about COVID.
[1:43:41.700 --> 1:43:44.700]  I tried to call in recently about this.
[1:43:44.700 --> 1:43:47.700]  So a close friend of mine is a doctor in northeast Ohio,
[1:43:47.700 --> 1:43:50.700]  which was the original, say the epicenter of Ohio.
[1:43:50.700 --> 1:43:54.700]  And he was working as the ER doctor one night.
[1:43:54.700 --> 1:43:57.700]  And this is about a month and a half ago,
[1:43:57.700 --> 1:44:00.700]  but he had a patient come in multiple stab wounds.
[1:44:00.700 --> 1:44:02.700]  He, from what he told me,
[1:44:02.700 --> 1:44:05.700]  he assumed that this person died in the ambulance on the way.
[1:44:05.700 --> 1:44:09.700]  But he was saying that he had never been the one,
[1:44:09.700 --> 1:44:11.700]  like he all, if he's the acting doctor,
[1:44:11.700 --> 1:44:13.700]  he will be the one to sign.
[1:44:13.700 --> 1:44:15.700]  And so out this death certificate,
[1:44:15.700 --> 1:44:17.700]  he said he received it on his desk though
[1:44:17.700 --> 1:44:20.700]  and the cause was already put in as COVID.
[1:44:20.700 --> 1:44:22.700]  And he asked some questions
[1:44:22.700 --> 1:44:24.700]  and he said he kind of got a little pushback
[1:44:24.700 --> 1:44:28.700]  and he's only been a doctor there for eight years now out of school.
[1:44:28.700 --> 1:44:30.700]  So he was scared to death telling me all this
[1:44:30.700 --> 1:44:32.700]  and doesn't want his name released and everything.
[1:44:32.700 --> 1:44:35.700]  But you know, there's literally hundreds of doctors
[1:44:35.700 --> 1:44:37.700]  that are well known that came out and said the same thing.
[1:44:37.700 --> 1:44:39.700]  And YouTube bans the video of them.
[1:44:39.700 --> 1:44:41.700]  Talk about criminal conspiracy.
[1:44:41.700 --> 1:44:43.700]  Big Tech is helping run this fraud.
[1:44:43.700 --> 1:44:46.700]  Yes, this one just specifically to me just hit home
[1:44:46.700 --> 1:44:49.700]  because it was, you know, a buddy since grade school.
[1:44:49.700 --> 1:44:50.700]  Well, no, no, no, exactly.
[1:44:50.700 --> 1:44:52.700]  You're not just watching a bunch of doctors on YouTube
[1:44:52.700 --> 1:44:53.700]  before they get banned.
[1:44:53.700 --> 1:44:55.700]  You know this guy, you know he's credible
[1:44:55.700 --> 1:44:57.700]  and the guy's got stab wounds and dies
[1:44:57.700 --> 1:44:59.700]  and they call it COVID-19.
[1:44:59.700 --> 1:45:03.700]  Correct. So yeah, feel free.
[1:45:03.700 --> 1:45:05.700]  No, no, but expand on that.
[1:45:05.700 --> 1:45:07.700]  I mean, he should be freaked out. Yeah, exactly.
[1:45:07.700 --> 1:45:09.700]  Because if they'll have him lie about that,
[1:45:09.700 --> 1:45:10.700]  what will they lie about next?
[1:45:10.700 --> 1:45:12.700]  Falsifying the cause of death is a felony.
[1:45:12.700 --> 1:45:15.700]  Yes. Yes.
[1:45:15.700 --> 1:45:17.700]  I mean, I can't really expand much.
[1:45:17.700 --> 1:45:19.700]  And the couple of times I called you before,
[1:45:19.700 --> 1:45:21.700]  I'm a microbiologist.
[1:45:21.700 --> 1:45:26.700]  I've always been on, been in vaccine research for years.
[1:45:26.700 --> 1:45:28.700]  That's usually the topic I can actually speak on.
[1:45:28.700 --> 1:45:32.700]  But, but yeah, but as far as the COVID,
[1:45:32.700 --> 1:45:36.700]  the COVID death for the staff victim up there,
[1:45:36.700 --> 1:45:37.700]  it's just freaky.
[1:45:37.700 --> 1:45:40.700]  This was, this was not long after the Bakersfield
[1:45:40.700 --> 1:45:44.700]  and then a couple other videos came out.
[1:45:44.700 --> 1:45:48.700]  But yeah, it was just kind of mind blowing real quick.
[1:45:48.700 --> 1:45:51.700]  I just want to put in or say as much as I can.
[1:45:51.700 --> 1:45:54.700]  Feel free to hang up on me as soon or whenever you want.
[1:45:54.700 --> 1:45:56.700]  I have actually went to some of the protests
[1:45:56.700 --> 1:45:59.700]  in Columbus, Ohio and have asked questions.
[1:45:59.700 --> 1:46:02.700]  There's some of my previous co-workers in science.
[1:46:02.700 --> 1:46:04.700]  They're up there.
[1:46:04.700 --> 1:46:06.700]  And I saw everyone around asking some questions.
[1:46:06.700 --> 1:46:11.700]  And I always say, so I am a supporter capitalism.
[1:46:11.700 --> 1:46:14.700]  However, I do believe that capitalism cannot,
[1:46:14.700 --> 1:46:16.700]  it can't exist without cronies.
[1:46:16.700 --> 1:46:19.700]  So that is caught, you know, in these people's minds
[1:46:19.700 --> 1:46:22.700]  that that is a big cause for a lot of their rage.
[1:46:22.700 --> 1:46:25.700]  They never feel like they have the same opportunities
[1:46:25.700 --> 1:46:27.700]  as most.
[1:46:27.700 --> 1:46:31.700]  So, but I just kind of went around just interviewing some people.
[1:46:31.700 --> 1:46:34.700]  But I just want to throw this out real quick.
[1:46:34.700 --> 1:46:36.700]  So I have...
[1:46:36.700 --> 1:46:37.700]  Listen, you don't, there's no,
[1:46:37.700 --> 1:46:39.700]  we're not screening your call on air, brother.
[1:46:39.700 --> 1:46:40.700]  You're on air.
[1:46:40.700 --> 1:46:42.700]  You don't have to ask permission for each thing you're going to say.
[1:46:42.700 --> 1:46:44.700]  Well, no, no, I just throw it out
[1:46:44.700 --> 1:46:46.700]  because in the couple of times I've called before,
[1:46:46.700 --> 1:46:48.700]  I know I've talked way too long.
[1:46:48.700 --> 1:46:50.700]  So that's why I was saying hang up on me whenever you need to.
[1:46:50.700 --> 1:46:53.700]  But anyway, I just want to throw this out there.
[1:46:53.700 --> 1:46:55.700]  So I have cops in my family.
[1:46:55.700 --> 1:47:02.700]  I have one child and his mother is the oldest daughter of a sheriff.
[1:47:02.700 --> 1:47:07.700]  And I was recruited into the sheriff's department nine years ago.
[1:47:07.700 --> 1:47:11.700]  And I found out from asking the sheriff at that time
[1:47:11.700 --> 1:47:14.700]  that the only PT test that you had to pass
[1:47:14.700 --> 1:47:17.700]  was the one out of graduating the academy.
[1:47:17.700 --> 1:47:19.700]  He said the rest, they just fudged the numbers.
[1:47:19.700 --> 1:47:22.700]  Well, the PT requirements for the sheriff's department
[1:47:22.700 --> 1:47:27.700]  was less than the female version of the PT test when I was in the army.
[1:47:27.700 --> 1:47:32.700]  So which in my mind two plus two is if you don't have physically fit,
[1:47:32.700 --> 1:47:37.700]  you know, police officers are going to be a lot more apt to use.
[1:47:37.700 --> 1:47:38.700]  No, that's it.
[1:47:38.700 --> 1:47:41.700]  They're not hiring tough police on average anymore.
[1:47:41.700 --> 1:47:43.700]  And it's all being done by design.
[1:47:43.700 --> 1:47:46.700]  So we're a nation of weaklings that the globalist can push and take over.
[1:47:46.700 --> 1:47:47.700]  I appreciate your call.
[1:47:47.700 --> 1:47:50.700]  That's all part of the emasculation program.
[1:47:50.700 --> 1:47:52.700]  The globalist all admit it. Great point, sir.
[1:47:52.700 --> 1:47:55.700]  Gabe in Florida says your wife's a medical tech on coronavirus.
[1:47:55.700 --> 1:47:58.700]  Thanks for calling.
[1:47:58.700 --> 1:47:59.700]  Yeah, how are you doing, man?
[1:47:59.700 --> 1:48:00.700]  I'm good, brother.
[1:48:00.700 --> 1:48:01.700]  Tell us what's going on.
[1:48:01.700 --> 1:48:03.700]  Hello?
[1:48:03.700 --> 1:48:04.700]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[1:48:04.700 --> 1:48:05.700]  Yeah, okay.
[1:48:05.700 --> 1:48:06.700]  All right.
[1:48:06.700 --> 1:48:07.700]  Go ahead, sir.
[1:48:07.700 --> 1:48:09.700]  Tell us what's going on with your wife's a medical tech on coronavirus.
[1:48:09.700 --> 1:48:10.700]  Go ahead.
[1:48:10.700 --> 1:48:11.700]  Sure, man.
[1:48:11.700 --> 1:48:12.700]  First, I want to say this.
[1:48:12.700 --> 1:48:14.700]  Dude, we're going to win this war.
[1:48:14.700 --> 1:48:15.700]  All right.
[1:48:15.700 --> 1:48:17.700]  We're not going to lose this war.
[1:48:17.700 --> 1:48:19.700]  Evil can never win over.
[1:48:19.700 --> 1:48:21.700]  You know this as much as anyone in the world.
[1:48:21.700 --> 1:48:24.700]  History always repeats itself, and we're going to come out on top.
[1:48:24.700 --> 1:48:26.700]  With that being said, we're winners.
[1:48:26.700 --> 1:48:28.700]  Now, my wife is a medical technologist.
[1:48:28.700 --> 1:48:29.700]  My father is a cardiologist.
[1:48:29.700 --> 1:48:30.700]  My mother is an OB.
[1:48:30.700 --> 1:48:31.700]  My sister is an OB.
[1:48:31.700 --> 1:48:34.700]  My brother is orthopedic.
[1:48:34.700 --> 1:48:36.700]  My other brother is an internist.
[1:48:36.700 --> 1:48:38.700]  And I have 60 doctors in my family.
[1:48:38.700 --> 1:48:39.700]  That's six.
[1:48:39.700 --> 1:48:40.700]  That's 16.
[1:48:40.700 --> 1:48:44.700]  60 doctors in my family from dentists like your father and et cetera, et cetera.
[1:48:44.700 --> 1:48:47.700]  None of them believe this B.N.
[1:48:47.700 --> 1:48:56.700]  My wife is a medical technologist who specializes in biochemistry and neurology.
[1:48:56.700 --> 1:48:59.700]  Here in my town, which I'm not going to tell you where it is because it's a small town
[1:48:59.700 --> 1:49:01.700]  and people don't know who I am.
[1:49:01.700 --> 1:49:02.700]  I don't want that to happen.
[1:49:02.700 --> 1:49:05.700]  And I don't want her to get dismissal for fires.
[1:49:05.700 --> 1:49:09.700]  They are doing tests where all of them are coming from false negatives.
[1:49:09.700 --> 1:49:12.700]  They got new tests in just recently.
[1:49:12.700 --> 1:49:16.700]  All of them are showing up positive.
[1:49:16.700 --> 1:49:21.700]  That's what all the medical doctors that have had the courage have come out and said.
[1:49:21.700 --> 1:49:22.700]  But don't tell you this.
[1:49:22.700 --> 1:49:25.700]  You've got to have real courage not to come out and have your wife speak out at others
[1:49:25.700 --> 1:49:26.700]  because this is going to collapse everything.
[1:49:26.700 --> 1:49:30.700]  So we're going to lose everything in the end if people don't come out and expose what's
[1:49:30.700 --> 1:49:31.700]  going on.
[1:49:31.700 --> 1:49:34.700]  Al, we're not going to lose in the end.
[1:49:34.700 --> 1:49:35.700]  Okay.
[1:49:35.700 --> 1:49:36.700]  I got you, brother.
[1:49:36.700 --> 1:49:37.700]  I got you.
[1:49:37.700 --> 1:49:39.700]  So nobody's got to actually stand up or have courage, but we're going to win.
[1:49:39.700 --> 1:49:40.700]  Okay.
[1:49:40.700 --> 1:49:41.700]  Al, we're going to win.
[1:49:41.700 --> 1:49:42.700]  Okay.
[1:49:42.700 --> 1:49:46.700]  I'm betting my life on the United States of America.
[1:49:46.700 --> 1:49:47.700]  We're going to win.
[1:49:47.700 --> 1:49:48.700]  We do not.
[1:49:48.700 --> 1:49:52.700]  But you understand that people speaking up when they see wrong is the United States of
[1:49:52.700 --> 1:49:53.700]  America.
[1:49:53.700 --> 1:49:55.700]  Oh, who are you talking to?
[1:49:55.700 --> 1:49:56.700]  Yeah, I get it.
[1:49:56.700 --> 1:49:57.700]  I get it.
[1:49:57.700 --> 1:49:58.700]  That's why I know.
[1:49:58.700 --> 1:49:59.700]  Dave, I'm not putting your wife down.
[1:49:59.700 --> 1:50:00.700]  You're down.
[1:50:00.700 --> 1:50:01.700]  You called in about this.
[1:50:01.700 --> 1:50:02.700]  That's great.
[1:50:02.700 --> 1:50:03.700]  You need to get the info out and leak it.
[1:50:03.700 --> 1:50:05.700]  You don't need to say who you are in the town.
[1:50:05.700 --> 1:50:09.700]  And I understand that, but everybody's been trying to protect themselves so long that
[1:50:09.700 --> 1:50:12.700]  criminals think they're safe to pull stuff like this.
[1:50:12.700 --> 1:50:13.700]  But that's very important.
[1:50:13.700 --> 1:50:15.700]  You said, because that's what Ron Paul saying, who's a doctor.
[1:50:15.700 --> 1:50:17.700]  Elon Musk is saying is what we're saying.
[1:50:17.700 --> 1:50:19.700]  It's what's come out.
[1:50:19.700 --> 1:50:23.700]  What is he saying that almost all the tests are false positive now?
[1:50:23.700 --> 1:50:24.700]  He's gone.
[1:50:24.700 --> 1:50:26.700]  See, here's the deal.
[1:50:26.700 --> 1:50:31.700]  Why do you think YouTube, Facebook and Twitter take down major medical doctors and scientists
[1:50:31.700 --> 1:50:36.700]  and hospital owners because it's powerful and because they're experts and because they
[1:50:36.700 --> 1:50:39.700]  have credibility and we should be part of that debate.
[1:50:39.700 --> 1:50:45.700]  Instead, I know for a fact that Fox News is trying to block their host from having medical
[1:50:45.700 --> 1:50:50.700]  doctors and scientists on that are saying all this because it's over for their hoax.
[1:50:50.700 --> 1:50:51.700]  If it comes out.
[1:50:51.700 --> 1:50:53.700]  So I'm not trying to lambast the last caller.
[1:50:53.700 --> 1:50:55.700]  He's just like, Oh, I don't want to say the town.
[1:50:55.700 --> 1:50:57.700]  And I want to then don't say the town.
[1:50:57.700 --> 1:51:00.700]  I just don't need to have a discussion about every facet of what you're going to say on
[1:51:00.700 --> 1:51:01.700]  here.
[1:51:01.700 --> 1:51:02.700]  You're on the air.
[1:51:02.700 --> 1:51:03.700]  I'm not mad at you.
[1:51:03.700 --> 1:51:10.700]  I'm just simply saying we need to put our money where our mouths are.
[1:51:10.700 --> 1:51:11.700]  You heard the last caller.
[1:51:11.700 --> 1:51:14.700]  Oh, he's an eight year doctor there and they falsified it.
[1:51:14.700 --> 1:51:15.700]  That's a crime.
[1:51:15.700 --> 1:51:16.700]  Call the police.
[1:51:16.700 --> 1:51:17.700]  Call the FBI.
[1:51:17.700 --> 1:51:20.700]  Go public.
[1:51:20.700 --> 1:51:22.700]  Other place they see these crimes going on.
[1:51:22.700 --> 1:51:23.700]  Nothing's being done.
[1:51:23.700 --> 1:51:28.700]  So the globalists think we're weak and they're going to take everything we've got.
[1:51:28.700 --> 1:51:29.700]  That's all I'm saying.
[1:51:29.700 --> 1:51:33.700]  This is a giant hoax and we need more people to call it.
[1:51:33.700 --> 1:51:34.700]  That's all I'm saying.
[1:51:34.700 --> 1:51:37.700]  We'll arrive back with our number three in your calls.
[1:51:37.700 --> 1:51:50.700]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[1:51:50.700 --> 1:51:52.700]  Where did it come from?
[1:51:52.700 --> 1:51:54.700]  Where did it come from?
[1:51:54.700 --> 1:51:56.700]  Where did it come from?
[1:51:56.700 --> 1:52:02.700]  We can't survive without pure clean drinking water.
[1:52:02.700 --> 1:52:08.700]  So make sure that it's always available to you with the Alexa pure water filtration system.

[1:52:34.700 --> 1:52:40.700]  Other systems just don't compare.
[1:52:40.700 --> 1:52:42.700]  It's finally here.
[1:52:42.700 --> 1:52:46.700]  Introducing the new survival shield X2 spray.

[1:53:42.700 --> 1:53:51.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:51.700 --> 1:53:58.700]  Live raw and uncensored.
[1:53:58.700 --> 1:54:03.700]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[1:54:03.700 --> 1:54:05.700]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:54:05.700 --> 1:54:10.700]  Coming up, French journalist, Marxist, Islamist coalition, waging war on western civilization,
[1:54:10.700 --> 1:54:13.700]  and winning because big corporations are aiding and abetting them,
[1:54:13.700 --> 1:54:18.700]  activists set up guillotine outside DC home of Jeff Bezos during protest of Amazon.
[1:54:18.700 --> 1:54:23.700]  These guys have appeased this stuff so long, they're seeds of their own destruction.
[1:54:23.700 --> 1:54:27.700]  Of course that happened in World War I, World War II, French Revolution, you name it.
[1:54:27.700 --> 1:54:28.700]  It's all coming up.
[1:54:28.700 --> 1:54:31.700]  I'm talking about the Civil War, all the fake COVID testing.
[1:54:31.700 --> 1:54:33.700]  Ron Paul came out and said it's fake.
[1:54:33.700 --> 1:54:37.700]  Jeff Bezos, of course, is just going along with the whole thing,
[1:54:37.700 --> 1:54:40.700]  but folks like Elon Musk are coming out and saying it's abroad.
[1:54:40.700 --> 1:54:43.700]  By the way, I wasn't lecturing the last two callers.
[1:54:43.700 --> 1:54:45.700]  They're just like, they know this doctor is scared to go public.
[1:54:45.700 --> 1:54:52.700]  And well, his wife won't even say the town they're in because they might find out that they're talking about fraudulent tests.
[1:54:52.700 --> 1:54:54.700]  They're the ones engaged in fraud.
[1:54:54.700 --> 1:54:56.700]  They're the ones ought to be worried.
[1:54:56.700 --> 1:54:58.700]  That's all I'm saying.
[1:54:58.700 --> 1:55:02.700]  You're way better than folks that don't even know what's going on or care or don't call in.
[1:55:02.700 --> 1:55:03.700]  I appreciate you.
[1:55:03.700 --> 1:55:05.700]  I'm not on a high horse.
[1:55:05.700 --> 1:55:07.700]  We're losing, man.
[1:55:07.700 --> 1:55:08.700]  That's all I'm saying.
[1:55:08.700 --> 1:55:11.700]  And I'm scared of what happens when everything collapses.
[1:55:11.700 --> 1:55:16.700]  I'm not up here doing this because I got courage and I like to stick my neck out.
[1:55:16.700 --> 1:55:19.700]  These are evil people running the show and we got to fight them.
[1:55:19.700 --> 1:55:22.700]  It's the only way out of this.
[1:55:22.700 --> 1:55:25.700]  Lee wants to talk about Trump's next action.
[1:55:25.700 --> 1:55:26.700]  Lee, talk about that.
[1:55:26.700 --> 1:55:28.700]  Thanks for calling.
[1:55:28.700 --> 1:55:30.700]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[1:55:30.700 --> 1:55:36.700]  You know, you asked before what we should do or what the president should do is actually invoke the Insurrection Act.
[1:55:36.700 --> 1:55:41.700]  You think of enough support with the Pentagon and the other Republicans in Congress to do that?
[1:55:41.700 --> 1:55:46.700]  I don't think he has support with a lot of people in the Pentagon because they've all been hand vetted to be traders at the top.
[1:55:46.700 --> 1:55:48.700]  The average military people are great.
[1:55:48.700 --> 1:55:55.700]  You know, I'd say Lieutenant Colonel and down, there are some few good generals, but they're all just a bunch of back scratching cowards above that.
[1:55:55.700 --> 1:56:03.700]  And I think there's just, if they saw the American people by the tens of millions hit the streets and really go confront globalist and go to their houses,
[1:56:03.700 --> 1:56:06.700]  don't kill them, don't burn them down, but they'll get in their faces.
[1:56:06.700 --> 1:56:12.700]  If they saw strength from us, the globalist minions would go with which way the wind blows.
[1:56:12.700 --> 1:56:21.700]  So all of this is why they try to act powerful and act like America sucks and we're not going to have the Fourth of July and we're not going to have Star Spangled Banner at football games,
[1:56:21.700 --> 1:56:24.700]  is to demoralize us to show their globalist power.
[1:56:24.700 --> 1:56:28.700]  You know, we're not going to call toothpaste whitening now.
[1:56:28.700 --> 1:56:30.700]  It's all just cult brainwashing.
[1:56:30.700 --> 1:56:31.700]  It's not even meant to make sense.
[1:56:31.700 --> 1:56:33.700]  It's all just meant to, everything's bad.
[1:56:33.700 --> 1:56:37.700]  Your country's bad, but we're bringing you something new.
[1:56:37.700 --> 1:56:42.700]  Well, what about white hats inside the intelligence communities?
[1:56:42.700 --> 1:56:45.700]  Can't they help make this possible?
[1:56:45.700 --> 1:56:46.700]  Don't they care?
[1:56:46.700 --> 1:56:52.700]  You know, I know a lot of those people who aren't globalist, but just say, look, if I stick my neck out, they'll get me.
[1:56:52.700 --> 1:56:56.700]  They believe the public's so weak that the public wouldn't stand with them when they took action.
[1:56:56.700 --> 1:56:58.700]  Well, you just got to be a leader.
[1:56:58.700 --> 1:57:00.700]  And there are people out there, but look what happened to General Flynn.
[1:57:00.700 --> 1:57:01.700]  He was one of those guys.
[1:57:01.700 --> 1:57:03.700]  Look what happened to Roger Stone.
[1:57:03.700 --> 1:57:07.700]  Look what they've done to Info Wars, and I'm not up here chronicling what they've done to us.
[1:57:07.700 --> 1:57:08.700]  It's spectacular.
[1:57:08.700 --> 1:57:11.700]  And it's fine with me because, you know, they're evil.
[1:57:11.700 --> 1:57:12.700]  They're going to get it.
[1:57:12.700 --> 1:57:25.700]  But if more people got that rule that you got to do what's right no matter what happens, there's an old saying, good men and hard men create prosperity.
[1:57:25.700 --> 1:57:29.700]  But then prosperity creates soft men who create collapse.
[1:57:29.700 --> 1:57:33.700]  And then it takes strong men again who are hard to bring back the prosperity.
[1:57:33.700 --> 1:57:35.700]  It's just the way it is.
[1:57:35.700 --> 1:57:36.700]  It's a cycle.
[1:57:36.700 --> 1:57:37.700]  It's a cycle.
[1:57:37.700 --> 1:57:39.700]  What do you think, Lee?
[1:57:39.700 --> 1:57:47.700]  Well, I think we all need to get on parlor and make that as strong as possible so that our voices can be heard and it can actually wake more people up.
[1:57:47.700 --> 1:57:48.700]  I agree.
[1:57:48.700 --> 1:57:49.700]  Exit us off of Twitter.
[1:57:49.700 --> 1:57:51.700]  Stay on Twitter, but also push people to parlor.
[1:57:51.700 --> 1:57:53.700]  Things like that, voting with your feet is paramount.
[1:57:53.700 --> 1:57:54.700]  Yes, sir.
[1:57:54.700 --> 1:57:59.700]  And educate our friends and neighbors and keep working on them and explain what's really going on.
[1:57:59.700 --> 1:58:00.700]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:58:00.700 --> 1:58:01.700]  Thank you, Lee.
[1:58:01.700 --> 1:58:03.700]  And look, I don't want to be up here and demoralize folks.
[1:58:03.700 --> 1:58:05.700]  There's a huge awakening happening.
[1:58:05.700 --> 1:58:07.700]  People are really, you know, understanding what's happening.
[1:58:07.700 --> 1:58:09.700]  It's just not enough.
[1:58:09.700 --> 1:58:13.700]  We need to repudiate the globalists, not just wake up to their bed.
[1:58:13.700 --> 1:58:19.700]  We need to repudiate the fake test and the stupid mask, not just say it's a fraud.
[1:58:19.700 --> 1:58:23.700]  We have to get aggressive.
[1:58:23.700 --> 1:58:28.700]  All of you out there can just search into it and find local airplane companies in your area
[1:58:28.700 --> 1:58:34.700]  that for a few thousand dollars a day will fly a message over a major city and hundreds of thousands of non-millions will see it.
[1:58:34.700 --> 1:58:39.700]  But all the middle class guys are just sitting on their 401ks and playing golf and they're staying out of it
[1:58:39.700 --> 1:58:43.700]  and just hoping, you know, Alex Jones and Trump can fix it for them.
[1:58:43.700 --> 1:58:54.700]  We're going to lose everything if you have that attitude.
[1:59:14.700 --> 1:59:20.700]  And we're willing to face the true horror of the New World Order.
[1:59:20.700 --> 1:59:30.700]  But if we do not support the actual transmission center that's getting the messages out from the guest, the callers, the host, we will fail.
[1:59:30.700 --> 1:59:32.700]  I'm stating the obvious here.
[1:59:32.700 --> 1:59:37.700]  I just want to thank you until I forth 2020 for your support, no matter what color you are or where you came from.
[1:59:37.700 --> 1:59:42.700]  If you love human liberty and freedom, we're brothers and sisters together and I salute and thank you all.
[1:59:42.700 --> 1:59:47.700]  Now share those links at band.video and crush the globalist murderers.
[2:00:12.700 --> 2:00:17.700]  I'm saying COVID-19 is a giant hoax that the deaths are absolutely way down.
[2:00:17.700 --> 2:00:24.700]  All this positive results saying people have COVID-19 are based on fraudulent tests gets huge.
[2:00:24.700 --> 2:00:31.700]  Meanwhile, Princeton dumps Woodrow Wilson's name over persistent racism.
[2:00:31.700 --> 2:00:38.700]  We've got major companies coming out and saying they're going to remove whitening.
[2:00:38.700 --> 2:00:42.700]  We're going to remove L'Oreal from any of their products.
[2:00:42.700 --> 2:00:44.700]  I guess you don't have whitening toothpaste either.
[2:00:44.700 --> 2:00:47.700]  It's all about the virtue signaling, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:00:47.700 --> 2:00:56.700]  Meanwhile, federal chief judge cancels himself called black official street smart.
[2:00:56.700 --> 2:01:02.700]  So see, now garage door opener robes are nooses.
[2:01:02.700 --> 2:01:04.700]  And now you have a microaggression.
[2:01:04.700 --> 2:01:06.700]  I've called myself street smart.
[2:01:06.700 --> 2:01:09.700]  I call all sorts of our guests street smart and tell us my street smart.
[2:01:09.700 --> 2:01:14.700]  An old school hand of the world, been around the block, street smart.
[2:01:14.700 --> 2:01:25.700]  But imagine the leftist mental illness that if you call an official who happens to be black street smart for a decision they made or something they caught onto.
[2:01:25.700 --> 2:01:28.700]  I mean street smart means you know what a fake $20 bill looks like.
[2:01:28.700 --> 2:01:33.700]  Street smart means you learn what drug dealers look like and you can see what somebody's on the corner selling drugs.
[2:01:33.700 --> 2:01:39.700]  Street smart means you've been around the streets.
[2:01:39.700 --> 2:01:43.700]  But the federal judge stepped down and pointed by George W.
[2:01:43.700 --> 2:01:45.700]  Because it's a virtue signal.
[2:01:45.700 --> 2:01:50.700]  See, it's always more, more, more, more mental illness, more insanity, more craziness.
[2:01:50.700 --> 2:01:54.700]  That whiteness is bad and everything you say is bad.
[2:01:54.700 --> 2:01:59.700]  This is the takedown of civilization.
[2:01:59.700 --> 2:02:04.700]  Let's talk to Kristen Washington once we talk about Civil War, Trump and signal.
[2:02:04.700 --> 2:02:06.700]  Go ahead and thanks for calling.
[2:02:06.700 --> 2:02:08.700]  Thanks Alex.
[2:02:08.700 --> 2:02:13.700]  Hey, before I get to the civil unrest, I gotta ask one question.
[2:02:13.700 --> 2:02:28.700]  What's your opinion on how Pence and Dr. Berks and Governor Abbott have signaled basically right after having the Tulsa rally?
[2:02:28.700 --> 2:02:32.700]  Now it's not an option.
[2:02:32.700 --> 2:02:37.700]  When the Tulsa rally was that you're right to wear a mask, if you want to wear a mask, don't wear a mask.
[2:02:37.700 --> 2:02:41.700]  Because they think the media is going to hang any COVID deaths around Trump's neck.
[2:02:41.700 --> 2:02:46.700]  So the Democrats can march, BLM can march, and if it can march, the gay pride rallies can march.
[2:02:46.700 --> 2:02:48.700]  But Trump can't march.
[2:02:48.700 --> 2:02:51.700]  And so Trump then says okay, or as people say, wear a mask.
[2:02:51.700 --> 2:02:55.700]  I think they're pressuring Trump to wear one and then he's capitulated.
[2:02:55.700 --> 2:02:59.700]  No, no, they're going to say, oh, he didn't wear one before, now he admits he's wrong.
[2:02:59.700 --> 2:03:02.700]  It doesn't matter if he points out that Democrat operatives don't wear them.
[2:03:02.700 --> 2:03:04.700]  It's just all about manipulation.
[2:03:04.700 --> 2:03:07.700]  That's why he has to go on the offense.
[2:03:07.700 --> 2:03:14.700]  Trump has to go on the offense and point out how it's fake testing, how they take regular people that die of other things and say it's COVID.
[2:03:14.700 --> 2:03:21.700]  He's got to just go after him because that Fauci Gates Bridge in his administration is undermining him.
[2:03:21.700 --> 2:03:23.700]  He has to destroy them.
[2:03:23.700 --> 2:03:26.700]  Is that the Trump? Destroy or be destroyed?
[2:03:26.700 --> 2:03:29.700]  Absolutely. That's what I was getting to next.
[2:03:29.700 --> 2:03:32.700]  It's destroy or be destroyed.
[2:03:32.700 --> 2:03:51.700]  And so with the civil unrest and the civil war that we're about looking at, what is your opinion on what Trump's best way to get his base, which is the majority, not the minority,
[2:03:51.700 --> 2:03:58.700]  but they're silent and they're scared because they don't want to be labeled as like, quote, domestic terrorists.
[2:03:58.700 --> 2:03:59.700]  Well, that's what all this is.
[2:03:59.700 --> 2:04:03.700]  They're going to label you a terrorist, a racist, or you're spreading COVID and killing people.
[2:04:03.700 --> 2:04:06.700]  And now they're telling leftists, go out and beat people up.
[2:04:06.700 --> 2:04:09.700]  Joey Beihar says, I'm stalking those that don't wear a mask.
[2:04:09.700 --> 2:04:11.700]  This is all about these bullies coming after us.
[2:04:11.700 --> 2:04:14.700]  And then when we battle them and wear the mask, it'll be something else, something more.
[2:04:14.700 --> 2:04:18.700]  I mean, this is living under a globalist cult.
[2:04:18.700 --> 2:04:21.700]  Yeah, it is. And, you know, give me liberty or give me death.
[2:04:21.700 --> 2:04:23.700]  I got a 13 year old child.
[2:04:23.700 --> 2:04:24.700]  I don't care about me.
[2:04:24.700 --> 2:04:27.700]  I care about our, our future children.
[2:04:27.700 --> 2:04:29.700]  And we all need to stand up.
[2:04:29.700 --> 2:04:34.700]  We all need to get, get behind and we all need, we all need some guidance from President Trump.
[2:04:34.700 --> 2:04:43.700]  So Mr. Trump, President Trump, if you're listening, please stand up, go against, go against all this.
[2:04:43.700 --> 2:04:45.700]  You know what's going on.
[2:04:45.700 --> 2:04:49.700]  Well, he tried to do it in Tulsa and they blocked people going in the door and blocked most of the seats.
[2:04:49.700 --> 2:04:53.700]  We now learn and made the thermometer people go away so they couldn't get in.
[2:04:53.700 --> 2:04:57.700]  They sabotaged the whole damn thing and Democrats bought most of the tickets up or they weren't, they didn't buy them.
[2:04:57.700 --> 2:04:59.700]  They, they, they reserved them.
[2:04:59.700 --> 2:05:00.700]  And it was just a giant scam they ran.
[2:05:00.700 --> 2:05:01.700]  I appreciate your call.
[2:05:01.700 --> 2:05:02.700]  Trump's totally surrounded.
[2:05:02.700 --> 2:05:06.700]  We've got to fight for the president now at this point.
[2:05:06.700 --> 2:05:10.700]  Patty's calling from Wyoming says she's a nurse on COVID-19 death numbers.
[2:05:10.700 --> 2:05:13.700]  Patty, thanks for calling.
[2:05:13.700 --> 2:05:16.700]  Hey, Alex, wonderful to talk to you.
[2:05:16.700 --> 2:05:19.700]  I just want to real, real quickly tell everyone buy your products.
[2:05:19.700 --> 2:05:27.700]  I have $200 worth of auto ship products and I just ordered some more brain force and bodies, which I love.
[2:05:27.700 --> 2:05:28.700]  I would not live without.
[2:05:28.700 --> 2:05:32.700]  I even give the bodies to my older Airdale who has arthritis now.
[2:05:32.700 --> 2:05:33.700]  It works great for him.
[2:05:33.700 --> 2:05:41.700]  So I'm just shocked that there are medical professionals out there who falsely document death.
[2:05:41.700 --> 2:05:44.700]  I don't understand how this is going on and why people aren't reporting it.
[2:05:44.700 --> 2:05:52.700]  I know that you had that nurse that John Rappapour had that video of the nurse that did the undercover video in Elmhurst.
[2:05:52.700 --> 2:05:54.700]  Yes, very powerful.
[2:05:54.700 --> 2:05:56.700]  And yeah, that was awesome.
[2:05:56.700 --> 2:05:57.700]  And I don't know whatever happened.
[2:05:57.700 --> 2:05:59.700]  Did it just get buried?
[2:05:59.700 --> 2:06:02.700]  I was told that she was going to be on Tucker and it never happened.
[2:06:02.700 --> 2:06:04.700]  And I'm not going to get it inside baseball.
[2:06:04.700 --> 2:06:08.700]  I'm not allowed to, but let's just say something that I'm allowed to is it was given to me in confidence.
[2:06:08.700 --> 2:06:12.700]  I'm not supposed to violate the confidence technically, but here's what's going on.
[2:06:12.700 --> 2:06:15.700]  There's massive pressure to not let medical professionals come tell the truth.
[2:06:15.700 --> 2:06:21.700]  On average, they're very good people, very educated, very informed, very moral, good people.
[2:06:21.700 --> 2:06:24.700]  And they're all being attacked and persecuted when they speak up.
[2:06:24.700 --> 2:06:26.700]  And we've confirmed what she said.
[2:06:26.700 --> 2:06:28.700]  They're being ordered.
[2:06:28.700 --> 2:06:32.700]  Notice it's blue states, deep blue states, deep blue cities.
[2:06:32.700 --> 2:06:39.700]  You have almost all the deaths because they're doing false positives and they're doing people in the COVID column that didn't have COVID.
[2:06:39.700 --> 2:06:46.700]  And that just shows how corrupt the Democrats are that when they're in full control, red states are by and large not engaging in the fraud.
[2:06:46.700 --> 2:06:50.700]  Right. Well, I know she was on for about 10 seconds.
[2:06:50.700 --> 2:06:56.700]  And basically it was a very softball little question that was asked and then she was off and they didn't hit any of the really.
[2:06:56.700 --> 2:06:58.700]  So that's why it technically meant she wasn't on.
[2:06:58.700 --> 2:06:59.700]  Exactly.
[2:06:59.700 --> 2:07:00.700]  Thanks for clarifying.
[2:07:00.700 --> 2:07:02.700]  The body was never on. Yeah.
[2:07:02.700 --> 2:07:05.700]  But what do you think about what's going on?
[2:07:05.700 --> 2:07:10.700]  Well, I think that we're seeing the deadly wound at the beginning of the deadly wound to the new world order.
[2:07:10.700 --> 2:07:20.700]  The book of Daniel, the book of Revelation tells us that the deadly wound that the new world order almost comes into being and it receives the deadly wound.
[2:07:20.700 --> 2:07:22.700]  And we are seeing this deadly wound.
[2:07:22.700 --> 2:07:24.700]  That's what I feel is going on.
[2:07:24.700 --> 2:07:34.700]  And the book of Revelation and the book of Daniel tell us that the deadly wound is healed by Satan who comes in pretending to be Christ.
[2:07:34.700 --> 2:07:40.700]  So we are, you know, and so it's the great fraud because that's all they are fraudsters.
[2:07:40.700 --> 2:07:41.700]  No, you're right.
[2:07:41.700 --> 2:07:45.700]  The whole new world order is being torn apart and incredibly damaged and falling apart.
[2:07:45.700 --> 2:07:53.700]  But we know somehow it's going to be resurrected and Satan's going to have AI that people get convinced is God because it appears to be omnipresent.
[2:07:53.700 --> 2:07:54.700]  Yeah.
[2:07:54.700 --> 2:07:58.700]  And he comes and he's going to come and claim me to be Christ and delude everyone.
[2:07:58.700 --> 2:08:02.700]  I mean, it's not hard to see how easily deluded people are.
[2:08:02.700 --> 2:08:05.700]  So I feel that that's what's going on now.
[2:08:05.700 --> 2:08:08.700]  We're witnessing we and God is calling out his army.
[2:08:08.700 --> 2:08:09.700]  So you got to take a side.
[2:08:09.700 --> 2:08:13.700]  That's why I get so angry about these wishy washy people speak up.
[2:08:13.700 --> 2:08:14.700]  That's right.
[2:08:14.700 --> 2:08:17.700]  So many Christians, so many patriots think be wishy washy.
[2:08:17.700 --> 2:08:18.700]  That's how you win.
[2:08:18.700 --> 2:08:20.700]  No, you're supposed to choose a side now.
[2:08:20.700 --> 2:08:26.700]  Yes, I take, I tell you what, when I go into meetings that work, I take my mask off and I was the only one that ever did it.
[2:08:26.700 --> 2:08:31.700]  And now when we go into meetings, they look at me and they begin taking their mask off.
[2:08:31.700 --> 2:08:39.700]  It's just like we need to stop letting them have the high ground and letting them have pretend that they have the moral high ground and they don't.
[2:08:39.700 --> 2:08:40.700]  Well, that's right.
[2:08:40.700 --> 2:08:44.700]  And again, the M 95 mask that you're supposed to wear doesn't protect air you're putting.
[2:08:44.700 --> 2:08:45.700]  It only protects air going in.
[2:08:45.700 --> 2:08:49.700]  So the idea that we should wear to protect people is a total fraud on its face.
[2:08:49.700 --> 2:09:00.700]  The Boston American statesman attacked us this morning and said, Jones and Shroyer claim the mask don't protect air coming out of the mask.
[2:09:00.700 --> 2:09:01.700]  It's it.
[2:09:01.700 --> 2:09:03.700]  That's on the box of an M 95.
[2:09:03.700 --> 2:09:05.700]  That's a fact.
[2:09:05.700 --> 2:09:12.700]  Well, I had someone tell me I wouldn't even believe it if I read it when I explained to them about the math.
[2:09:12.700 --> 2:09:15.700]  I would not even believe it if I read it on the box.
[2:09:15.700 --> 2:09:16.700]  They told me.
[2:09:16.700 --> 2:09:19.700]  Well, then I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to tell you.
[2:09:19.700 --> 2:09:23.700]  But, you know, I don't want to keep doing the whole Bible thing.
[2:09:23.700 --> 2:09:31.700]  But I know that you have listeners who call in and the word also tells us that in the end times, because my God said my people are sad.
[2:09:31.700 --> 2:09:33.700]  So I will send a strong delusion.
[2:09:33.700 --> 2:09:37.700]  So, you know, if God took the delusion on someone, we're not going to we're not going to remove it.
[2:09:37.700 --> 2:09:39.700]  If you want to be stupid, then he'll help you.
[2:09:39.700 --> 2:09:40.700]  That's right.
[2:09:40.700 --> 2:09:42.700]  Patty never apologized for talking about God.
[2:09:42.700 --> 2:09:43.700]  That's Susan charge.
[2:09:43.700 --> 2:09:45.700]  We need God more now than ever.
[2:09:45.700 --> 2:09:47.700]  We were told by the United Nations.
[2:09:47.700 --> 2:09:54.700]  We were told by the CDC and Fauci that two plus million Americans would die, that millions of Europeans would die.
[2:09:54.700 --> 2:09:57.700]  We did not do exactly as they said.
[2:09:57.700 --> 2:09:59.700]  And it turned out it was all frauds.
[2:09:59.700 --> 2:10:06.700]  The models, the testing, taking regular depths and putting it in the COVID-19 column, all a complete criminal fraud.
[2:10:06.700 --> 2:10:08.700]  But none of them are getting sued.
[2:10:08.700 --> 2:10:09.700]  None of them are getting prosecuted.
[2:10:09.700 --> 2:10:12.700]  None of them are getting in trouble except for Bill Gates, the FDA.
[2:10:12.700 --> 2:10:18.700]  Shut down his factories that are making fake COVID tests that show everyone is positive.
[2:10:18.700 --> 2:10:27.700]  And despite that, there's still testing record numbers of people creating hysteria and saying the numbers spiking and why it will be 200,000 dead by the election.
[2:10:27.700 --> 2:10:28.700]  And it's all Trump's fault.
[2:10:28.700 --> 2:10:31.700]  And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city.
[2:10:31.700 --> 2:10:33.700]  We've had a lockdown again.
[2:10:33.700 --> 2:10:34.700]  Everything's over.
[2:10:34.700 --> 2:10:38.700]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners.
[2:10:38.700 --> 2:10:42.700]  Either we expose the COVID hoax or all permanently enslaved by it.
[2:10:42.700 --> 2:11:08.700]  Your choice.

[2:11:58.700 --> 2:12:25.700]  Let's get started.
[2:12:25.700 --> 2:12:30.700]  Well, Sasha Baron Cohen came out last November at an ADL speech.
[2:12:30.700 --> 2:12:32.700]  We can play the clips coming up next segment.
[2:12:32.700 --> 2:12:33.700]  He called for my arrest.
[2:12:33.700 --> 2:12:40.700]  He called for the arrest of Mark Zuckerberg if he didn't go under full ADL control and censor everyone even more.
[2:12:40.700 --> 2:12:42.700]  And he said the ADL should control the planet.
[2:12:42.700 --> 2:12:45.700]  I mean, it's an hour long speech.
[2:12:45.700 --> 2:12:46.700]  It was huge.
[2:12:46.700 --> 2:12:48.700]  We'll play a few clips of that next segment.
[2:12:48.700 --> 2:12:50.700]  Well, he showed up at a rally.
[2:12:50.700 --> 2:12:55.700]  We'll tell you where exactly what happened with Matt Marshall, who's been on before, who was there and witnessed it.
[2:12:55.700 --> 2:13:05.700]  And they're in Washington state and exposed that Sasha Baron Cohen came in clearly with a production company offered to help this restart America rally.
[2:13:05.700 --> 2:13:13.700]  And they'll fill you in on what unfolded with, of course, Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers.
[2:13:13.700 --> 2:13:21.700]  So Marshall4wa.com is Matt Marshall's site.
[2:13:21.700 --> 2:13:25.700]  He's the state leader of the Washington 3% community-based 501c3 pending nonprofit that strives to support, prepare and defend their communities.
[2:13:25.700 --> 2:13:29.700]  They do this as advocates for the Constitution, limited government, supporting homeless veterans.
[2:13:29.700 --> 2:13:30.700]  We've had them on before.
[2:13:30.700 --> 2:13:31.700]  Nice guy.
[2:13:31.700 --> 2:13:32.700]  Very involved.
[2:13:32.700 --> 2:13:41.700]  Matt's a combat veteran, vice chairman of the second legislative district Republicans in Washington, second amendment advocate and currently running for state rep.
[2:13:41.700 --> 2:13:48.700]  The point is, when Sasha Baron Cohen got caught doing this, all over the news, oh, he went to a Nazi rally.
[2:13:48.700 --> 2:13:50.700]  Oh, he went and exposed them.
[2:13:50.700 --> 2:13:52.700]  Oh, why don't they have a sense of humor?
[2:13:52.700 --> 2:13:54.700]  No, he went there to pose as a Nazi.
[2:13:54.700 --> 2:13:59.700]  We have all the videos so he could then frame them when they tried to stop it.
[2:13:59.700 --> 2:14:05.700]  They had our men try to protect Cohen so he could finish up and jump at an ambulance to speed away.
[2:14:05.700 --> 2:14:07.700]  All the videos are up on him4wars.com.
[2:14:07.700 --> 2:14:15.700]  We'll take hours to watch him, but I spent the time watching and it is insane to watch Jesse Smollett tile style hoax caught in the act.
[2:14:15.700 --> 2:14:19.700]  So Stuart Rhodes, Matt Marshall, we should probably start with Matt Marshall here.
[2:14:19.700 --> 2:14:29.700]  Matt, spend a few minutes talking about the event, what happened and where you see this going because they spend this like group defends themselves says they're not a racist, whatever.
[2:14:29.700 --> 2:14:31.700]  They turn it all around.
[2:14:31.700 --> 2:14:39.700]  He comes, lies about who he is, sets it up, tries to frame you guys, runs off, comes back in the militia outfit to stir stuff up.
[2:14:39.700 --> 2:14:43.700]  I mean, the guy is a complete criminal in my view, Matt.
[2:14:43.700 --> 2:14:47.700]  Yeah, so there's actually quite a bit of misrepresentation on this.
[2:14:47.700 --> 2:14:49.700]  First off, we did have reports of armed men.
[2:14:49.700 --> 2:14:51.700]  We don't actually have those confirmed.
[2:14:51.700 --> 2:15:00.700]  We did have physical security, physically blocking and pulling people off of the stage when they were trying to rush the stage to get Cohen off.
[2:15:00.700 --> 2:15:06.700]  Also, he never actually came back in like they're accusing us of letting him do.
[2:15:06.700 --> 2:15:16.700]  That was actually a supporter who films all of our rallies, who actually has a pretty impressive large beard and hairstyle that looks fake.
[2:15:16.700 --> 2:15:18.700]  But he's actually one of my Facebook friends.
[2:15:18.700 --> 2:15:19.700]  Good.
[2:15:19.700 --> 2:15:20.700]  Well, I'm glad you're here because we're just going off the first report.
[2:15:20.700 --> 2:15:22.700]  So tell us exactly what happened.
[2:15:22.700 --> 2:15:23.700]  Yeah.
[2:15:23.700 --> 2:15:29.700]  So it started earlier, earlier in the week, one of the organizers for the event was reached out via email.
[2:15:29.700 --> 2:15:31.700]  They asked if they could help us out.
[2:15:31.700 --> 2:15:34.700]  They're with a pack out of Orange County, California.
[2:15:34.700 --> 2:15:40.700]  They claimed that they had some big donors that were conservatives that wanted to help with conservative grassroots.
[2:15:40.700 --> 2:15:42.700]  We thought it was a hoax at first.
[2:15:42.700 --> 2:15:48.700]  However, when they started paying for things like picking up the tab on the porta bodies, renting a larger stage,
[2:15:48.700 --> 2:15:55.700]  since this confirmation that they had signed Larry Gatlin as a Gatlin brothers as a live music act.
[2:15:55.700 --> 2:15:57.700]  We were like, okay, maybe this is legit.
[2:15:57.700 --> 2:16:01.700]  And then on Thursday, they flew out and met with myself and one of the other organizers.
[2:16:01.700 --> 2:16:08.700]  It was again, not Sasha Cohen disguised and posing as a pack president.
[2:16:08.700 --> 2:16:16.700]  It was two females who are his producers who flew out and were misrepresenting themselves.
[2:16:16.700 --> 2:16:19.700]  So we went for it.
[2:16:19.700 --> 2:16:21.700]  We let them, we let them set up a stage.
[2:16:21.700 --> 2:16:30.700]  We had an agreement via verbal contract to allow us to use the first two hours for our standard production with governor candidates,
[2:16:30.700 --> 2:16:33.700]  state representative candidates, attorney general candidates.
[2:16:33.700 --> 2:16:35.700]  And we had a good conservative rally.
[2:16:35.700 --> 2:16:41.700]  And then the last two hours they said was for their musical acts.
[2:16:41.700 --> 2:16:48.700]  So they actually asked us to leave the secured area and brought up the first band, which is a local band that we had looked into.
[2:16:48.700 --> 2:16:52.700]  And that band began to play.
[2:16:52.700 --> 2:16:57.700]  After that band, there was going to be about a 20 minute break and then we were going to get the All Right boys,
[2:16:57.700 --> 2:17:00.700]  which is a band we'd never even heard of that apparently they signed that morning.
[2:17:00.700 --> 2:17:08.700]  And All Right is ALRIGHT, not All Right, like as in All For Right.
[2:17:08.700 --> 2:17:14.700]  But we can see the name play right there on us, which is all part of the setup.
[2:17:14.700 --> 2:17:15.700]  Anyway, the band started.
[2:17:15.700 --> 2:17:17.700]  We found out since it's called the Warren G. Hardings.
[2:17:17.700 --> 2:17:20.700]  They're an actual legitimate band that were playing backup.
[2:17:20.700 --> 2:17:22.700]  And they actually played a good first song.
[2:17:22.700 --> 2:17:27.700]  And then this dude in a costume comes up as a guest speaker or a guest singer for them.
[2:17:27.700 --> 2:17:30.700]  And we thought it was, you know, a comedy skit.
[2:17:30.700 --> 2:17:36.700]  Well, he starts into, you know, some stupid song that was just, it was dumb.
[2:17:36.700 --> 2:17:38.700]  It was obviously something complicated.
[2:17:38.700 --> 2:17:40.700]  Exactly.
[2:17:40.700 --> 2:17:45.700]  So at the beginning it didn't start out with basic support.
[2:17:45.700 --> 2:17:49.700]  And at the beginning I hadn't eaten.
[2:17:49.700 --> 2:17:51.700]  It was about 3 p.m.
[2:17:51.700 --> 2:17:52.700]  I'd been there since 6 a.m.
[2:17:52.700 --> 2:17:57.700]  I went around backstage to my truck and got something to eat.
[2:17:57.700 --> 2:18:00.700]  About two or three minutes into me getting something to eat,
[2:18:00.700 --> 2:18:03.700]  it turned into people yelling.
[2:18:03.700 --> 2:18:06.700]  I hear somebody screaming on a megaphone about racists go home.
[2:18:06.700 --> 2:18:10.700]  I see guys scrambling trying to unplug the generator.
[2:18:10.700 --> 2:18:14.700]  There were security guards physically blocking them from unplugging the generator.
[2:18:14.700 --> 2:18:18.700]  I ran up to go back onto the stage to see what the hell was going on.
[2:18:18.700 --> 2:18:25.700]  And I was being physically blocked from going past the 3-foot crowd control barriers.
[2:18:25.700 --> 2:18:29.700]  Despite me having a backstage pass and being one of the organizers of the event.
[2:18:29.700 --> 2:18:34.700]  Myself and a few other men jumped the barrier, rushed to the security,
[2:18:34.700 --> 2:18:39.700]  and then there were people on the stage, or at the stairs of the stage there,
[2:18:39.700 --> 2:18:42.700]  to the right of the stage, behind that black curtain there.
[2:18:42.700 --> 2:18:45.700]  And they were arms and legs spread blocking the stairwell,
[2:18:45.700 --> 2:18:47.700]  so we couldn't get onto the stage.
[2:18:47.700 --> 2:18:51.700]  We physically pushed past them and took the stage and ejected them off there.
[2:18:51.700 --> 2:18:54.700]  But he was able to sit on that stage for a solid eight minutes,
[2:18:54.700 --> 2:18:57.700]  spewing the stuff while the crowd was not participating in it,
[2:18:57.700 --> 2:19:01.700]  because we were being physically restricted from getting back onto the stage.
[2:19:01.700 --> 2:19:05.700]  So he literally engaged in this Jesse Smollett false flag racist event,
[2:19:05.700 --> 2:19:10.700]  and used security to restrain people while they commended the fraud to then frame you.
[2:19:10.700 --> 2:19:13.700]  You talk about a civil lawsuit, Stuart, I know you don't practice law anymore,
[2:19:13.700 --> 2:19:15.700]  we're going to break in a moment, Stuart Rhodes found our hood keepers,
[2:19:15.700 --> 2:19:21.700]  but this looks pretty damn illegal, fraudulent, criminal, uncivil to me.
[2:19:21.700 --> 2:19:22.700]  What do you think?
[2:19:22.700 --> 2:19:25.700]  Well, then he also faked an injury.
[2:19:25.700 --> 2:19:29.700]  He told the ambulance crew that he had hired, that he had a medical emergency,
[2:19:29.700 --> 2:19:31.700]  and that's how he got out of there.
[2:19:31.700 --> 2:19:34.700]  So I think he's definitely criminally culpable for that.
[2:19:34.700 --> 2:19:37.700]  If he can get the local politicians to actually prosecute him,
[2:19:37.700 --> 2:19:39.700]  I think he committed a crime right there.
[2:19:39.700 --> 2:19:40.700]  And also assault.
[2:19:40.700 --> 2:19:43.700]  I mean, Matt was the emcee for the event,
[2:19:43.700 --> 2:19:47.700]  and yet his contracted security people committed assault against Matt,
[2:19:47.700 --> 2:19:51.700]  and his other organizers to keep them off the stage.
[2:19:51.700 --> 2:19:54.700]  So yes, they committed criminal acts to do this.
[2:19:54.700 --> 2:19:56.700]  And I see armed police there.
[2:19:56.700 --> 2:19:59.700]  How are the police involved in 30 seconds, Matt?
[2:19:59.700 --> 2:20:03.700]  Yeah, so the police were there because they saw people surrounding an ambulance.
[2:20:03.700 --> 2:20:04.700]  The ambulance had its lights on.
[2:20:04.700 --> 2:20:09.700]  The EMT in the front told the police that they had a medical emergency and had to get out of there.
[2:20:09.700 --> 2:20:11.700]  Police questioned, what is the emergency?
[2:20:11.700 --> 2:20:14.700]  And the driver said, that is HIPAA protected,
[2:20:14.700 --> 2:20:17.700]  and the police forced everybody out of the way so they could make their escape.
[2:20:17.700 --> 2:20:19.700]  So they're going to stage a false flag.
[2:20:19.700 --> 2:20:20.700]  They're smart.
[2:20:20.700 --> 2:20:21.700]  They hire an ambulance.
[2:20:21.700 --> 2:20:22.700]  They're waiting.
[2:20:22.700 --> 2:20:25.700]  They're ready to literally be able to get around police everybody.
[2:20:25.700 --> 2:20:27.700]  This is a well thought out criminal conspiracy.
[2:20:27.700 --> 2:20:28.700]  We'll be right back.
[2:20:28.700 --> 2:20:30.700]  Remember, this is a monster.
[2:20:30.700 --> 2:20:31.700]  Cohen's not an American.
[2:20:31.700 --> 2:20:34.700]  And we've got the clips coming up.
[2:20:34.700 --> 2:20:36.700]  Literally calls for arresting American patriots.
[2:20:36.700 --> 2:20:39.700]  He says, in free speech, everything must go through the ADL.
[2:20:39.700 --> 2:20:43.700]  And here he is, staging a false flag attack to frame American patriots.
[2:20:43.700 --> 2:20:46.700]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup.
[2:20:46.700 --> 2:20:48.700]  My second cup of the day, it's really strong.
[2:20:48.700 --> 2:20:52.700]  I shouldn't do this because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive boy.
[2:20:52.700 --> 2:20:53.700]  And the coffee adds to it.
[2:20:53.700 --> 2:20:54.700]  But wake up, America.
[2:20:54.700 --> 2:20:55.700]  Coffee there by loves.
[2:20:55.700 --> 2:20:57.700]  Highest rated in the Chiapas Mountains.
[2:20:57.700 --> 2:20:59.700]  It's beyond Mexican coffee, beyond Guatemalan coffee.
[2:20:59.700 --> 2:21:00.700]  It's the best coffee in the world.
[2:21:00.700 --> 2:21:03.700]  It's right on the border between the two countries in those rainforests.
[2:21:03.700 --> 2:21:04.700]  Hand-selected.
[2:21:04.700 --> 2:21:05.700]  It's beyond organic.
[2:21:05.700 --> 2:21:06.700]  Wildcrafted.
[2:21:06.700 --> 2:21:07.700]  Wake up, America.
[2:21:07.700 --> 2:21:08.700]  Coffee.
[2:21:08.700 --> 2:21:09.700]  People are blown away by how good it is.
[2:21:09.700 --> 2:21:13.700]  Same stuff sold in Whole Foods on another name for $30 for the same size container.
[2:21:13.700 --> 2:21:14.700]  Yes, folks.
[2:21:14.700 --> 2:21:15.700]  We've been selling it 10 years.

[2:21:35.700 --> 2:21:38.700]  Only has a 98% out of 814 reviews.
[2:21:38.700 --> 2:21:40.700]  It's not as popular.
[2:21:40.700 --> 2:21:43.700]  Anyways, it's all at infowarstore.com.
[2:21:43.700 --> 2:21:47.700]  Ultra 12 is already our overall number one bestseller.
[2:21:47.700 --> 2:21:53.700]  Ultra 12 is twice as strong as Secret 12 for an even lower price.
[2:21:53.700 --> 2:21:57.700]  Because I signed a huge multi-year contract to guarantee to buy a ton of it.
[2:21:57.700 --> 2:22:01.700]  And my bet ended up to be successful so far.
[2:22:01.700 --> 2:22:03.700]  Folks are ordering it in mass.
[2:22:03.700 --> 2:22:04.700]  They're getting great responses.
[2:22:04.700 --> 2:22:06.700]  They're giving us incredible reviews.
[2:22:06.700 --> 2:22:11.700]  Because we know what vitamin B12 of this type does taken under the tongue where it's more
[2:22:11.700 --> 2:22:12.700]  absorbable.
[2:22:12.700 --> 2:22:14.700]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[2:22:14.700 --> 2:22:16.700]  Helps make DNA.
[2:22:16.700 --> 2:22:18.700]  Help the body produce more energy.
[2:22:18.700 --> 2:22:20.700]  Help produce healthy blood cells.
[2:22:20.700 --> 2:22:23.700]  Essential for proper nervous system function and so much more.
[2:22:23.700 --> 2:22:26.700]  You can take all the energy drinks and they won't do anything if you don't have the basic
[2:22:26.700 --> 2:22:30.700]  art in your body like vitamin B12.
[2:22:30.700 --> 2:22:33.700]  Whether you're old, whether you're young, whether you're black, whether you're white,

[2:22:35.700 --> 2:22:38.700]  Ultra 12 is the best vitamin B12 you're going to find out there.
[2:22:38.700 --> 2:22:44.700]  It's uber, absorbable, and it's 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[2:22:44.700 --> 2:22:46.700]  We're already in the latter part of June.
[2:22:46.700 --> 2:22:49.700]  And of course, most of the country is not completely reopened again.
[2:22:49.700 --> 2:22:55.700]  And already Fauci and the UN Bill of Milindigates criminal combiner telling us,
[2:22:55.700 --> 2:22:57.700]  don't go to Trump rallies.
[2:22:57.700 --> 2:22:58.700]  Oh, no.
[2:22:58.700 --> 2:23:02.700]  But the very same media that promotes that we shouldn't go to Trump rallies is telling
[2:23:02.700 --> 2:23:07.700]  us we should go to the Democrat Party, Black Lives Matter, all white people are evil,
[2:23:07.700 --> 2:23:09.700]  mind control, brainwashing events.
[2:23:09.700 --> 2:23:13.700]  This is the attempted murder of common sense and logic.
[2:23:13.700 --> 2:23:18.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be more politically active than you ever have
[2:23:18.700 --> 2:23:23.700]  because we are going into hardcore United Nations controlled bondage.
[2:23:23.700 --> 2:23:27.700]  Major police departments like Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico are announcing
[2:23:27.700 --> 2:23:32.700]  they're going under UN control and turning their quote police into community activist
[2:23:32.700 --> 2:23:33.700]  organizers.
[2:23:33.700 --> 2:23:34.700]  This is just the beginning.
[2:23:34.700 --> 2:23:37.700]  Everything is going to accelerate now from this point out.
[2:23:37.700 --> 2:23:38.700]  So it's here.
[2:23:38.700 --> 2:23:39.700]  No more games.
[2:23:39.700 --> 2:24:06.700]  The New World Order has arrived.
[2:24:06.700 --> 2:24:09.700]  He never gives up.
[2:24:09.700 --> 2:24:19.700]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[2:24:19.700 --> 2:24:23.700]  Well, Matt Marshall was there in Washington State this weekend.
[2:24:23.700 --> 2:24:27.700]  So I got caught red-handed and I'm just giving breaking news.
[2:24:27.700 --> 2:24:31.700]  The ambulance company, I'll tell you about it in a moment, has come out and said they
[2:24:31.700 --> 2:24:35.700]  were duped by Cohen criminally because they know this is criminal, what they did.
[2:24:35.700 --> 2:24:37.700]  Unless they expose the fact that they were set up.
[2:24:37.700 --> 2:24:39.700]  Now it's his criminal activity.
[2:24:39.700 --> 2:24:43.700]  So this is big, but I got a bunch of these clips, but here's Cohen last November saying
[2:24:43.700 --> 2:24:45.700]  I'm this evil person lying about me.
[2:24:45.700 --> 2:24:49.700]  And then he expanded out to say, arrest everybody, including Mark Zuckerberg.
[2:24:49.700 --> 2:25:17.700]  If you don't go under ADL control, here he is.
[2:25:17.700 --> 2:25:21.700]  The lie that Jews are somehow dangerous.
[2:25:21.700 --> 2:25:27.700]  As one headline put it, just think what Goebbels could have done with Facebook.
[2:25:27.700 --> 2:25:28.700]  All right.
[2:25:28.700 --> 2:25:29.700]  That's another game.
[2:25:29.700 --> 2:25:31.700]  We'll play more coming up, but here's the deal.
[2:25:31.700 --> 2:25:37.700]  He's the one doing throw the Jew down the well, seeing a long song in the last few lines
[2:25:37.700 --> 2:25:40.700]  when he's got people drunk at 2 a.m. throw the Jew down the well.
[2:25:40.700 --> 2:25:41.700]  So my country can be safe.
[2:25:41.700 --> 2:25:42.700]  He makes him clap.
[2:25:42.700 --> 2:25:45.700]  A bunch of drunk people been working all week on Friday night.
[2:25:45.700 --> 2:25:48.700]  And then he sets them up in a movie when he went and did it.
[2:25:48.700 --> 2:25:49.700]  Well, he tried it here.
[2:25:49.700 --> 2:25:50.700]  It didn't work.
[2:25:50.700 --> 2:25:52.700]  I'm going to play the song here.
[2:25:52.700 --> 2:25:53.700]  I'm going to waste our time.
[2:25:53.700 --> 2:25:56.700]  It's on info wars.com with all the racist crap he was spewing.
[2:25:56.700 --> 2:25:59.700]  But this crowd didn't go along with it and tried to stop him.
[2:25:59.700 --> 2:26:01.700]  So he had men try to tackle him.
[2:26:01.700 --> 2:26:02.700]  But guess what?
[2:26:02.700 --> 2:26:04.700]  He got overwhelmed and all the footage is on info wars.com.
[2:26:04.700 --> 2:26:07.700]  I know it's posted at Marshall for w a.com as well.
[2:26:07.700 --> 2:26:12.700]  I'm going to get Stuart Rhodes who's not a practicing lawyer, but is a patriot and wrote a big thesis
[2:26:12.700 --> 2:26:15.700]  at Yale on the fall of the Republican.
[2:26:15.700 --> 2:26:17.700]  All of the stuff we're starting to witness here right now.
[2:26:17.700 --> 2:26:20.700]  But here's the big developing news.
[2:26:20.700 --> 2:26:23.700]  AMR a global medical response solution.
[2:26:23.700 --> 2:26:29.700]  AMR strongly condemns inappropriate use of first responders and EMS resources for hoax.
[2:26:29.700 --> 2:26:32.700]  This just got released last night.
[2:26:32.700 --> 2:26:34.700]  We're just now learning about this.
[2:26:34.700 --> 2:26:38.700]  And they said that they were hired and said someone has a medical condition.
[2:26:38.700 --> 2:26:42.700]  I'm not sure if it was a fraud.
[2:26:42.700 --> 2:26:44.700]  They realized it's illegal what happened.
[2:26:44.700 --> 2:26:46.700]  So they're distancing themselves.
[2:26:46.700 --> 2:26:47.700]  This is a big deal.
[2:26:47.700 --> 2:26:52.700]  This is a false flag like Jesse Smollett and Cohen needs to be charged.
[2:26:52.700 --> 2:26:59.700]  The man hides behind the First Amendment while he wants to get rid of it when he conducts racist false flags.
[2:26:59.700 --> 2:27:02.700]  Stuart Rhodes, you want to respond to this?
[2:27:02.700 --> 2:27:11.700]  He's committed a crime by impersonating a medical emergency by falsely claiming he had a medical emergency to extract himself from the situation.
[2:27:11.700 --> 2:27:13.700]  And also his security guards committed assault.
[2:27:13.700 --> 2:27:18.700]  I mean, Matt was the emcee, one of the event organizers, and the other event organizers, Alan Costa, right?
[2:27:18.700 --> 2:27:19.700]  Alan Costa.
[2:27:19.700 --> 2:27:20.700]  Yeah.
[2:27:20.700 --> 2:27:23.700]  So both Alan and Matt were kept off the stage forcibly.
[2:27:23.700 --> 2:27:24.700]  That's assault.
[2:27:24.700 --> 2:27:30.700]  And so I think they should be charged for both things, that the security guards should be charged for assault and Cohen himself should be charged.
[2:27:30.700 --> 2:27:34.700]  By the way, the left knows that conservatives and nationalists and patriots still extra trouble.
[2:27:34.700 --> 2:27:35.700]  They started the fight.
[2:27:35.700 --> 2:27:38.700]  It's time every case to sue the living hell out of them.
[2:27:38.700 --> 2:27:40.700]  Stuart, you want a big case for us.
[2:27:40.700 --> 2:27:41.700]  It was a sealed case.
[2:27:41.700 --> 2:27:42.700]  We can't talk about it.
[2:27:42.700 --> 2:27:43.700]  But you know what you're talking about.
[2:27:43.700 --> 2:27:44.700]  I know you don't practice law now.
[2:27:44.700 --> 2:27:47.700]  You're full-time this, but hopefully you'll advise these guys to go for the jugular.
[2:27:47.700 --> 2:27:49.700]  They need to go after Cohen.
[2:27:49.700 --> 2:27:50.700]  He is a damn criminal.
[2:27:50.700 --> 2:27:52.700]  Proud to steal on birthright.
[2:27:52.700 --> 2:27:54.700]  For defamation of character as well.
[2:27:54.700 --> 2:27:56.700]  Absolutely libel in defamation of character.
[2:27:56.700 --> 2:28:05.700]  And the audience, when you play the clip at the end, the audience, before he's kicked off the stage, the audience is booing him, going thumbs down and yelling and getting him off the stage.
[2:28:05.700 --> 2:28:08.700]  So of course he will not play those clips.
[2:28:08.700 --> 2:28:17.700]  They'll only play either manufactured or select audio of someone shooting along at the early parts of the song before he turned to racist.
[2:28:17.700 --> 2:28:19.700]  Well, we also know they plant people in the crowd.
[2:28:19.700 --> 2:28:23.700]  I mean, Rand Paul had found out they had people planted his crowds doing this.
[2:28:23.700 --> 2:28:24.700]  Right.
[2:28:24.700 --> 2:28:26.700]  You can expect that as well.
[2:28:26.700 --> 2:28:28.700]  But you know, this is the thing is left.
[2:28:28.700 --> 2:28:30.700]  The only, the only, they're one trick pony.
[2:28:30.700 --> 2:28:33.700]  All they have is a false charge of racism.
[2:28:33.700 --> 2:28:35.700]  This country is racist and evil.
[2:28:35.700 --> 2:28:38.700]  And anybody who's not radical Marxist is a racist.
[2:28:38.700 --> 2:28:39.700]  That's all they've got.
[2:28:39.700 --> 2:28:41.700]  That's, that's their one trick.
[2:28:41.700 --> 2:28:42.700]  That's all they have.
[2:28:42.700 --> 2:28:45.700]  So they're going to keep using it over and over and over again.
[2:28:45.700 --> 2:28:46.700]  That's right.
[2:28:46.700 --> 2:28:47.700]  Well, where do you go from here, Matt?
[2:28:47.700 --> 2:28:52.700]  This is a big deal because you know it's going to be on Showtime or HBO, wherever his new show is.
[2:28:52.700 --> 2:28:55.700]  He's got a couple of them saying here are the white supremacists.
[2:28:55.700 --> 2:28:57.700]  I mean, they're already calling you guys that in the news.
[2:28:57.700 --> 2:28:58.700]  That's defamation right there.
[2:28:58.700 --> 2:29:00.700]  None of your event had anything to do with that.
[2:29:00.700 --> 2:29:02.700]  He's the one up there putting that out.
[2:29:02.700 --> 2:29:03.700]  Yeah.
[2:29:03.700 --> 2:29:06.700]  I mean, we've got the legal angle to take at least for civil lawsuit.
[2:29:06.700 --> 2:29:19.700]  I mean, some of the things that I think is absolutely hilarious about this too is the guy that was with me who bum rushed to the stage and overpowered security is the son of a Holocaust survivor, Eric Rody.
[2:29:19.700 --> 2:29:30.700]  And you can see his son there, R. R. Rody, wearing an Israel flag, yelling at him through a bullhorn to get off the stage as the crowd is angry and shouting him down.
[2:29:30.700 --> 2:29:33.700]  So trying to spin this is somehow we are racist.
[2:29:33.700 --> 2:29:35.700]  I mean, it's absurd.
[2:29:35.700 --> 2:29:40.700]  We want the biggest tent pop, the biggest tent possible to restore this Republic.
[2:29:40.700 --> 2:29:42.700]  Unity is what we want.
[2:29:42.700 --> 2:29:47.700]  And I gave a speech, a long speech when I was up there on the stage during the first hour.
[2:29:47.700 --> 2:29:51.700]  It's talking about political intolerance, being the basis for the divide in this country.
[2:29:51.700 --> 2:29:57.700]  And if we ever want our Republic back, we need to unite because a lot of us have more in common than polarized parties.
[2:29:57.700 --> 2:29:58.700]  Exactly.
[2:29:58.700 --> 2:30:00.700]  The left are the ones exacerbating division.
[2:30:00.700 --> 2:30:02.700]  That's why I explained it's a scythe.
[2:30:02.700 --> 2:30:04.700]  Sure, there are racist against whites and racist against blacks.
[2:30:04.700 --> 2:30:06.700]  We're going to let them rule the damn country.
[2:30:06.700 --> 2:30:07.700]  It's a joke.
[2:30:07.700 --> 2:30:08.700]  We're a good country.
[2:30:08.700 --> 2:30:09.700]  We need to reject this.
[2:30:09.700 --> 2:30:13.700]  And we Stuart Rhodes, let me ask you this and let me ask your compadre.
[2:30:13.700 --> 2:30:18.700]  They're his view. How is the fight right now with Trump and America and the Civil War they've started?
[2:30:18.700 --> 2:30:21.700]  I mean, how would you judge this as a football game at halftime?
[2:30:21.700 --> 2:30:23.700]  I would say that they're desperate.
[2:30:23.700 --> 2:30:26.700]  And that's why they're pulling all the stops out that we discussed before.
[2:30:26.700 --> 2:30:28.700]  There's Al Acosta right there in the shot.
[2:30:28.700 --> 2:30:36.700]  Al is a Filipino immigrant, a special forces veteran, a purple heart winner and a standup combat vet.
[2:30:36.700 --> 2:30:40.700]  That's the main organizer for this event is that little brown guy right there on the screen.
[2:30:40.700 --> 2:30:46.700]  And so they're desperate. They're desperate to try to paint us and it's not working.
[2:30:46.700 --> 2:30:47.700]  That's why Trump is getting...
[2:30:47.700 --> 2:30:53.700]  That's right. They know that brown people are getting involved in the Tea Party and they understand and they are crapping their britches right now.
[2:30:53.700 --> 2:30:54.700]  That's right.
[2:30:54.700 --> 2:31:00.700]  I mean, look at Trump is getting all kind of support now in the black community because he's actually doing something to help them.
[2:31:00.700 --> 2:31:06.700]  Killing them jobs, doing prison reform, you know, bringing their economy back and the left is going crazy.
[2:31:06.700 --> 2:31:07.700]  It's why they want to burn to the ground.
[2:31:07.700 --> 2:31:10.700]  That's why they're trying to destroy the inner cities in this country right now.
[2:31:10.700 --> 2:31:13.700]  And right now we're facing a communist insurrection.
[2:31:13.700 --> 2:31:17.700]  That's what this is. It's a full blown communist driven insurrection.
[2:31:17.700 --> 2:31:21.700]  But their main tool is to try to inspire or create a race war.
[2:31:21.700 --> 2:31:24.700]  But the American people aren't falling for it and hopefully they won't fall for it.
[2:31:24.700 --> 2:31:31.700]  I agree. Matt, what is your view on where the country is right now?
[2:31:31.700 --> 2:31:34.700]  No, we're in a bad spot right now.
[2:31:34.700 --> 2:31:37.700]  The country is more divided than it's ever been.
[2:31:37.700 --> 2:31:45.700]  And, you know, we have two political parties that are both complicit at best, if not, you know, part of the entire divide, because it helps them stay in power.
[2:31:45.700 --> 2:31:52.700]  They know that the majority of the people believe that there's issues with policing, that there's issues with taxation, there's issues with what we're being told about coronavirus.
[2:31:52.700 --> 2:32:03.700]  And they know that if we were to actually come together and us being the ones with all powers derived by the people, if we united, that's the biggest threat to both parties in power right now.
[2:32:03.700 --> 2:32:10.700]  That's right. That's why the Republicans who are still blue blood are going along with us, because they like the division, because they fear the people.
[2:32:10.700 --> 2:32:14.700]  And they ought to fear the globalist offshore sources that really do plan to scuttle this country.
[2:32:14.700 --> 2:32:20.700]  I mean, that's why I tell the blue blood, you better stop siding with the globalist man. You're idiots.
[2:32:20.700 --> 2:32:23.700]  Yeah, most definitely.
[2:32:23.700 --> 2:32:29.700]  Do you think Cohen's happy right now? Because, I mean, I don't see how he can put this out on national TV now that he's been exposed.
[2:32:29.700 --> 2:32:32.700]  But he's so arrogant, he might still do it.
[2:32:32.700 --> 2:32:34.700]  He might do it.
[2:32:34.700 --> 2:32:43.700]  It would be a flop for him because we have so much footage of what really happened that we're going to be able to beat just like when Trump was almost pumped.
[2:32:43.700 --> 2:32:49.700]  Sorry, good try. It was funny, but or you think it's funny, but it didn't work.
[2:32:49.700 --> 2:32:51.700]  We caught you in your own house.
[2:32:51.700 --> 2:32:54.700]  They have sex with Ron Paul. I mean, it's just it's sick.
[2:32:54.700 --> 2:33:06.700]  Yeah, I mean, it's disgusting that somebody would would go for a laughs by inflaming the political divide in our country right now, especially at an event designed to bring unity.
[2:33:06.700 --> 2:33:11.700]  Well, and that's bad enough, but he has free speech, except he wants to take ours, brother.
[2:33:11.700 --> 2:33:12.700]  Yep.
[2:33:12.700 --> 2:33:18.700]  I mean, you've seen his ADL speech where he looks like Count Dracula, and he's literally going, I rest everyone that does not agree with us.
[2:33:18.700 --> 2:33:24.700]  We I mean, he sounds like a Nazi man, a Soviet commissar.
[2:33:24.700 --> 2:33:26.700]  I don't know. And that guy, I mean, I hate his guts.
[2:33:26.700 --> 2:33:28.700]  I mean, he just he literally sits up there.
[2:33:28.700 --> 2:33:32.700]  He's not even an American perches up there and tells us we suck.
[2:33:32.700 --> 2:33:36.700]  And we do arrest big tech heads because they not censoring enough.
[2:33:36.700 --> 2:33:38.700]  I mean, the guy's an enemy. He's a danger.
[2:33:38.700 --> 2:33:39.700]  I mean, I'm just telling you point blank.
[2:33:39.700 --> 2:33:42.700]  They're out back. Stay with us.
[2:33:42.700 --> 2:33:52.700]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.

[2:35:47.700 --> 2:35:50.700]  to those that are into esoteric mysticism.
[2:35:50.700 --> 2:35:54.700]  And they believe this is the year they're going to totally overthrow America and the world
[2:35:54.700 --> 2:35:57.700]  and bring in their anti-God, anti-human tyranny.

[2:37:16.700 --> 2:37:20.700]  forced inoculation, and complete enslavement of the human population.
[2:37:20.700 --> 2:37:25.700]  This is medical tyranny. This is the Bill and Melinda Gates UN takeover.
[2:37:25.700 --> 2:37:31.700]  This is the end of civilization. As you know it, living in denial only empowers the enemy.
[2:37:31.700 --> 2:37:35.700]  If you want to break free from this trance, there's not much time.
[2:37:35.700 --> 2:37:37.700]  Warn everyone you know that it's a giant hoax.
[2:37:37.700 --> 2:37:41.700]  Show them the numbers, show them the facts, and explain that it's the end of the world
[2:37:41.700 --> 2:37:46.700]  as we know it if we don't wake up and resist.
[2:37:46.700 --> 2:38:12.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:12.700 --> 2:38:16.700]  There is so much insane breaking news right now at infowarestore.com.
[2:38:16.700 --> 2:38:21.700]  Travis County, Austin, Texas.
[2:38:21.700 --> 2:38:24.700]  All Travis County parks will be closed on 4th of July weekend,
[2:38:24.700 --> 2:38:28.700]  and the Democrats that run the city are saying no fireworks, no nothing.
[2:38:28.700 --> 2:38:34.700]  But Black Lives Matter, Southern Poverty Law Center, all these other groups,
[2:38:34.700 --> 2:38:37.700]  Antifa, they can be running around, burning, doing whatever they want.
[2:38:37.700 --> 2:38:39.700]  I'm not against the police. They're being ordered to do this,
[2:38:39.700 --> 2:38:45.700]  but they had the National Guard riot police out, state police out, and cops.
[2:38:45.700 --> 2:38:48.700]  Because we were down there covering all the Black Lives Matter, Antifa stuff.
[2:38:48.700 --> 2:38:54.700]  They would put like 20 cops out for a thousand Antifa Black Lives Matter.
[2:38:54.700 --> 2:39:00.700]  We had like 500 people, max, maybe 400, and they had just hundreds of National Guard
[2:39:00.700 --> 2:39:04.700]  and police and state police all over the place and said you can't come on the Capitol.
[2:39:04.700 --> 2:39:07.700]  The Black Lives Matter could come on the Capitol and say we're going to kill the police.
[2:39:07.700 --> 2:39:10.700]  I'm not against the police. They were ordered to do that, folks.
[2:39:10.700 --> 2:39:13.700]  It's pretty shameful, unbelievably disgusting.
[2:39:13.700 --> 2:39:18.700]  Twitch suspends Donald Trump's account as Reddit bans his supporters' communities.
[2:39:18.700 --> 2:39:22.700]  Of course, Reddit's now owned by the Chinese Communist.
[2:39:22.700 --> 2:39:24.700]  It's just insane.
[2:39:24.700 --> 2:39:28.700]  By the way, we're running the annual 4th of July Super Sale right now.

[2:40:02.700 --> 2:40:05.700]  Strongest turmeric extract we can get a company to produce.
[2:40:05.700 --> 2:40:07.700]  95% are cuminoid.
[2:40:07.700 --> 2:40:09.700]  The leading brands are like 3% to 5%.
[2:40:09.700 --> 2:40:13.700]  It's amazing what it does for your joints and your cells and everything else.
[2:40:13.700 --> 2:40:17.700]  So let's go back to Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers who's here with us
[2:40:17.700 --> 2:40:22.700]  and also one of his associates that was there during all this,
[2:40:22.700 --> 2:40:27.700]  the emcee of this event unfolding.
[2:40:27.700 --> 2:40:32.700]  Stuart, big picture, and you guys are in Washington State,
[2:40:32.700 --> 2:40:35.700]  very close to Chas, big shooting yesterday.
[2:40:35.700 --> 2:40:38.700]  Another shooting just happened there, CHOP or whatever it's called.
[2:40:38.700 --> 2:40:40.700]  Can you speak to that as well?
[2:40:40.700 --> 2:40:41.700]  Absolutely.
[2:40:41.700 --> 2:40:44.700]  In fact, we've got one of our undercover guys here, Keith Campbell,
[2:40:44.700 --> 2:40:47.700]  Oath Keeper has been in and out of Chas multiple times.
[2:40:47.700 --> 2:40:49.700]  If you want, he can hop on screen real quick.
[2:40:49.700 --> 2:40:50.700]  Sure, absolutely, whatever you want.
[2:40:50.700 --> 2:40:52.700]  But just, sure, bring him in.
[2:40:52.700 --> 2:40:53.700]  So here's a situation in Chas.
[2:40:53.700 --> 2:40:55.700]  We were just there this morning.
[2:40:55.700 --> 2:40:58.700]  They had a shooting and another person just killed there.
[2:40:58.700 --> 2:41:01.700]  This is a communist enclave in the United States
[2:41:01.700 --> 2:41:05.700]  and Keith has been in and out of the Chas since day two.
[2:41:05.700 --> 2:41:07.700]  Yep, since day two of whatever day.
[2:41:07.700 --> 2:41:09.700]  So give out your quick rundown on what you've seen
[2:41:09.700 --> 2:41:11.700]  and what you think is going to happen.
[2:41:11.700 --> 2:41:14.700]  So basically in the beginning, it was like a party atmosphere.
[2:41:14.700 --> 2:41:17.700]  There were all kinds of bands in and everyone in
[2:41:17.700 --> 2:41:20.700]  to make it a huge party, a love fest basically.
[2:41:20.700 --> 2:41:24.700]  But then as time's gone by, I think they've been feeling the pressure
[2:41:24.700 --> 2:41:28.700]  and it's kind of starting to come on the glues.
[2:41:28.700 --> 2:41:31.700]  Their guards are running around more from place to place,
[2:41:31.700 --> 2:41:33.700]  trying to handle situations.
[2:41:33.700 --> 2:41:36.700]  And it's just a completely different atmosphere.
[2:41:36.700 --> 2:41:40.700]  And the daytime is calm and nice, but it gets dark.
[2:41:40.700 --> 2:41:43.700]  The guns come off, the guns come out and it gets crazy.
[2:41:43.700 --> 2:41:44.700]  Of course, we were there.
[2:41:44.700 --> 2:41:48.700]  I was filming out my window and then I saw my review mirror behind me.
[2:41:48.700 --> 2:41:52.700]  There was a guy chasing our truck, trying to chase down my truck.
[2:41:52.700 --> 2:41:56.700]  So even during daylight, if you're filming them, they get pretty upset.
[2:41:56.700 --> 2:41:57.700]  So let's be clear.
[2:41:57.700 --> 2:41:59.700]  They're stomping on the business owners.
[2:41:59.700 --> 2:42:01.700]  They're ruling the area.
[2:42:01.700 --> 2:42:04.700]  Whatever happened to the warlord of Chopper, Chesh,
[2:42:04.700 --> 2:42:08.700]  who we now on the city was paying for a whole area for him for recording studio?
[2:42:08.700 --> 2:42:11.700]  You know, I haven't seen him lately.
[2:42:11.700 --> 2:42:16.700]  A lot of the humanly hip hop crowd just had split about a week or so ago
[2:42:16.700 --> 2:42:18.700]  and looked like it was going to disband.
[2:42:18.700 --> 2:42:22.700]  I don't know, now they're coming back and getting more aggressive with the recording.
[2:42:22.700 --> 2:42:24.700]  Well, now it's antifa.
[2:42:24.700 --> 2:42:26.700]  This is an antifa operation.
[2:42:26.700 --> 2:42:29.700]  This is a revcom antifa operation.
[2:42:29.700 --> 2:42:32.700]  What they've done is they put into practice what revcom,
[2:42:32.700 --> 2:42:35.700]  the revolutionary communist party, has been preaching for years
[2:42:35.700 --> 2:42:37.700]  that they should take the streets.
[2:42:37.700 --> 2:42:40.700]  That's why they always chant, who streets are streets?
[2:42:40.700 --> 2:42:41.700]  Well, now they've actually done it.
[2:42:41.700 --> 2:42:42.700]  This is the problem.
[2:42:42.700 --> 2:42:45.700]  Even though this is very much the same thing that's been going on
[2:42:45.700 --> 2:42:47.700]  in Portland and Seattle for years,
[2:42:47.700 --> 2:42:49.700]  now they've made it very concrete.
[2:42:49.700 --> 2:42:50.700]  It's in your face.
[2:42:50.700 --> 2:42:51.700]  They've taken over a precinct.
[2:42:51.700 --> 2:42:55.700]  The police, you know, in a cowardly manner, abandoned their own precinct.
[2:42:55.700 --> 2:42:57.700]  And all that's done is embolden them.
[2:42:57.700 --> 2:42:59.700]  And so now it's not going to stop.
[2:42:59.700 --> 2:43:02.700]  That's why I believe President Trump needs to put his foot down
[2:43:02.700 --> 2:43:04.700]  and call the National Guard and the National Service
[2:43:04.700 --> 2:43:06.700]  and suppress this insurrection.
[2:43:06.700 --> 2:43:07.700]  Because that's what this is.
[2:43:07.700 --> 2:43:10.700]  It's not just a local, you know, temporary...
[2:43:10.700 --> 2:43:13.700]  This is men going around with guns,
[2:43:13.700 --> 2:43:16.700]  robbing and attacking journalists, doing whatever they want.
[2:43:16.700 --> 2:43:19.700]  It's just, it's like Lord of the Flies.
[2:43:19.700 --> 2:43:24.700]  Well, it's a microcosm of a communist dictatorship is what it is.
[2:43:24.700 --> 2:43:28.700]  This is the dictatorship of the proletariat in microcosm for now.
[2:43:28.700 --> 2:43:30.700]  But it's going to spread to Berkeley.
[2:43:30.700 --> 2:43:32.700]  It's going to spread to Portland.
[2:43:32.700 --> 2:43:33.700]  It's going to spread to Atlanta.
[2:43:33.700 --> 2:43:36.700]  It's going to spread all over the country, unless it's stopped now.
[2:43:36.700 --> 2:43:37.700]  This is serious.
[2:43:37.700 --> 2:43:39.700]  And they're running around with guns.
[2:43:39.700 --> 2:43:40.700]  It's gone kinetic already.
[2:43:40.700 --> 2:43:44.700]  It's no longer about street battles between the proud boys and antifa.
[2:43:44.700 --> 2:43:45.700]  This is the next level.
[2:43:45.700 --> 2:43:46.700]  That's right.
[2:43:46.700 --> 2:43:49.700]  And this is going to be the cover for if they are able to remove Trump
[2:43:49.700 --> 2:43:52.700]  and have martial law for real teams and organizations and groups
[2:43:52.700 --> 2:43:55.700]  they've got that are planning to do political assassinations,
[2:43:55.700 --> 2:43:56.700]  I believe, start.
[2:43:56.700 --> 2:43:57.700]  Well, absolutely.
[2:43:57.700 --> 2:44:00.700]  In fact, antifa is running around the country right now
[2:44:00.700 --> 2:44:03.700]  targeting police homes, taking pictures of police homes,
[2:44:03.700 --> 2:44:06.700]  mapping where they are for their target list.
[2:44:06.700 --> 2:44:09.700]  Also, conservative and nationalist leaders,
[2:44:09.700 --> 2:44:11.700]  patriot leaders, they've been out to my house as well.
[2:44:11.700 --> 2:44:13.700]  I'm not trying to add myself to the list,
[2:44:13.700 --> 2:44:14.700]  but they've been to Tucker Carlson's.
[2:44:14.700 --> 2:44:16.700]  They're out lazing the targets.
[2:44:16.700 --> 2:44:17.700]  Absolutely right.
[2:44:17.700 --> 2:44:20.700]  Which is why all of us have got to stand up now.
[2:44:20.700 --> 2:44:22.700]  We're doing that already, particularly police families.
[2:44:22.700 --> 2:44:25.700]  But I encourage every veteran out there, every patriot,
[2:44:25.700 --> 2:44:28.700]  to go knock on your neighbor's doors, form a neighborhood watch,
[2:44:28.700 --> 2:44:32.700]  and make sure that you put a priority on protecting the people you know
[2:44:32.700 --> 2:44:34.700]  are being targeted by antifa.
[2:44:34.700 --> 2:44:36.700]  Well, as you see the Black Lives Matter that's interchangeable
[2:44:36.700 --> 2:44:39.700]  in the antifa Democratic Party, go to this private home
[2:44:39.700 --> 2:44:42.700]  with a private gate and say, this is our street
[2:44:42.700 --> 2:44:45.700]  and start approaching the guy's house, trying to get shot.
[2:44:45.700 --> 2:44:48.700]  And then local news in St. Louis said it was a public road
[2:44:48.700 --> 2:44:49.700]  when it wasn't.
[2:44:49.700 --> 2:44:52.700]  I mean, knowing just total fraud.
[2:44:52.700 --> 2:44:53.700]  Well, it's a terror campaign.
[2:44:53.700 --> 2:44:55.700]  This is what communists do.
[2:44:55.700 --> 2:44:57.700]  It's very much like the black shirts in Italy
[2:44:57.700 --> 2:44:59.700]  or the brown shirts in Nazi Germany.
[2:44:59.700 --> 2:45:02.700]  Same tactic that was used in Soviet Russia or China.
[2:45:02.700 --> 2:45:04.700]  It's intimidation and terrorism.
[2:45:04.700 --> 2:45:06.700]  And eventually what they're going to do is they're going to go
[2:45:06.700 --> 2:45:08.700]  and start killing people.
[2:45:08.700 --> 2:45:11.700]  And their ideology drives them towards that ultimate end.
[2:45:11.700 --> 2:45:13.700]  And so when they kill a police family, God forbid,
[2:45:13.700 --> 2:45:16.700]  is when it will be open season on antifa.
[2:45:16.700 --> 2:45:18.700]  I mean, anytime there's even or Black Lives Matter
[2:45:18.700 --> 2:45:20.700]  when they're seen in the streets will be shot in the streets
[2:45:20.700 --> 2:45:24.700]  because no one is going to wait for the police to report a shooting.
[2:45:24.700 --> 2:45:26.700]  They're just going to shoot them and leave.
[2:45:26.700 --> 2:45:29.700]  You're going to shoot and scoot because if you defend yourself against them,
[2:45:29.700 --> 2:45:31.700]  one of these big cities, you go to jail.
[2:45:31.700 --> 2:45:34.700]  By the way, it turns out these lawyers are basically Democrats
[2:45:34.700 --> 2:45:38.700]  and they've got their big fancy mansion and they're there defending it
[2:45:38.700 --> 2:45:39.700]  because they know their rights.
[2:45:39.700 --> 2:45:43.700]  The left is calling for their arrest, defending their house.
[2:45:43.700 --> 2:45:45.700]  Well, like you said earlier in your show,
[2:45:45.700 --> 2:45:47.700]  now they're starting to understand reality.
[2:45:47.700 --> 2:45:50.700]  The moderate Democrats, the ones who aren't as radical,
[2:45:50.700 --> 2:45:52.700]  will have no shelter.
[2:45:52.700 --> 2:45:54.700]  They'll be deprived of their property.
[2:45:54.700 --> 2:45:57.700]  They'll be raped and killed just like everybody else.
[2:45:57.700 --> 2:45:59.700]  And then to understand that they don't want to survive.
[2:45:59.700 --> 2:46:01.700]  They don't want to survive the situation.
[2:46:01.700 --> 2:46:03.700]  They got to come back towards the Constitution
[2:46:03.700 --> 2:46:05.700]  and help us suppress insurrection.
[2:46:05.700 --> 2:46:07.700]  I know you've got Oathkeepers.org.
[2:46:07.700 --> 2:46:11.700]  What's the best website for people to visit and support Oathkeepers to it?
[2:46:11.700 --> 2:46:13.700]  Just Oathkeepers.org.
[2:46:13.700 --> 2:46:16.700]  And they can also go look at defendamericannow.com,
[2:46:16.700 --> 2:46:18.700]  which is our initiative.
[2:46:18.700 --> 2:46:20.700]  It's our gift to the public.
[2:46:20.700 --> 2:46:22.700]  Well, I didn't know you were out there on the West Coast.
[2:46:22.700 --> 2:46:24.700]  I want to invite you guys back this week, you and Matt Marshall.
[2:46:24.700 --> 2:46:25.700]  Thank you, Keith.
[2:46:25.700 --> 2:46:29.700]  Keith, I'd like to interview you in the next few days for like a full hour
[2:46:29.700 --> 2:46:31.700]  just to send us the clips.
[2:46:31.700 --> 2:46:33.700]  We can actually chronologically go through what you've done.
[2:46:33.700 --> 2:46:34.700]  I really appreciate you.
[2:46:34.700 --> 2:46:37.700]  Let's bring Matt Marshall back in and organize the event
[2:46:37.700 --> 2:46:39.700]  that Saucer Bear Cohen got caught false-flagging.
[2:46:39.700 --> 2:46:42.700]  Matt Marshall, you want to add anything in closing?
[2:46:42.700 --> 2:46:44.700]  Oh, yeah.
[2:46:44.700 --> 2:46:50.700]  So in closing, you know, there was a lot of stuff that we,
[2:46:50.700 --> 2:46:52.700]  in hindsight, we should have recognized.
[2:46:52.700 --> 2:46:57.700]  You know, one of the biggest flags is I wear a body camera at every one of my events
[2:46:57.700 --> 2:47:01.700]  because of the quote, contract with the artist.
[2:47:01.700 --> 2:47:03.700]  I was told for artist privacy.
[2:47:03.700 --> 2:47:04.700]  I wear it backstage.
[2:47:04.700 --> 2:47:06.700]  So this is the first time I've ever held an event.
[2:47:06.700 --> 2:47:08.700]  I don't have the entire event from south.
[2:47:08.700 --> 2:47:09.700]  That's right.
[2:47:09.700 --> 2:47:10.700]  They used that against you.
[2:47:10.700 --> 2:47:11.700]  You see how they operate?
[2:47:11.700 --> 2:47:12.700]  Yep.
[2:47:12.700 --> 2:47:14.700]  So this was very well thought out.
[2:47:14.700 --> 2:47:16.700]  They spent a lot of money on this.
[2:47:16.700 --> 2:47:19.700]  And I think it's a sign that we're making some good traction
[2:47:19.700 --> 2:47:21.700]  and so we're making some positive changes.
[2:47:21.700 --> 2:47:22.700]  Well, that's right.
[2:47:22.700 --> 2:47:23.700]  I think that's a takeaway.
[2:47:23.700 --> 2:47:24.700]  We're awake now.
[2:47:24.700 --> 2:47:27.700]  So every one of their false flags, Smollett, Bubba Smollett,
[2:47:27.700 --> 2:47:30.700]  they're all blown up with their face.
[2:47:30.700 --> 2:47:31.700]  Absolutely.
[2:47:31.700 --> 2:47:32.700]  And you know what?
[2:47:32.700 --> 2:47:34.700]  They do it to intimidate the people.
[2:47:34.700 --> 2:47:37.700]  They're trying to make change and we will not be intimidated.
[2:47:37.700 --> 2:47:38.700]  We will not back down.
[2:47:38.700 --> 2:47:39.700]  Let me guess.
[2:47:39.700 --> 2:47:42.700]  You're going to have more events to get more support now that you caught this rat.
[2:47:42.700 --> 2:47:43.700]  Oh, yeah.
[2:47:43.700 --> 2:47:45.700]  March for our rights, 3.1.
[2:47:45.700 --> 2:47:47.700]  We're planning for August.
[2:47:47.700 --> 2:47:50.700]  I got to tell you, I'm glad that little rat had to run into that ambulance.
[2:47:50.700 --> 2:47:53.700]  And again, the ambulance company has come out and said it's a fraud and a hoax.
[2:47:53.700 --> 2:47:59.700]  So the ambulance company says Sasha Merrick Cohen staged a racial hoax.
[2:47:59.700 --> 2:48:02.700]  That is a big damn deal and a big deal for your civil lawsuit.
[2:48:02.700 --> 2:48:03.700]  So don't hesitate.
[2:48:03.700 --> 2:48:04.700]  Please sue them.
[2:48:04.700 --> 2:48:06.700]  I'm sure Sturkin advised you.
[2:48:06.700 --> 2:48:07.700]  Thank you both, gentlemen.
[2:48:07.700 --> 2:48:08.700]  Hey, thank you.
[2:48:08.700 --> 2:48:09.700]  Thank you.
[2:48:09.700 --> 2:48:10.700]  Thank you.
[2:48:10.700 --> 2:48:11.700]  Thank you.
[2:48:11.700 --> 2:48:13.700]  Harold Salente is coming up and then the War Room on Shroyer.
[2:48:13.700 --> 2:48:17.700]  Roger Stone is on the first hour tomorrow with huge exclusive information.
[2:48:17.700 --> 2:48:20.700]  So just, just, you'll just know that.
[2:48:20.700 --> 2:48:21.700]  All right.
[2:48:21.700 --> 2:48:23.700]  Hour number four with Gerald Salente, the Trends forecast from Kings of New York.
[2:48:23.700 --> 2:48:24.700]  Straight ahead.
[2:48:24.700 --> 2:48:25.700]  Infowars.com.
[2:48:25.700 --> 2:48:27.700]  Tomorrow's news today.
[2:48:27.700 --> 2:48:28.700]  Choose what side you're on.
[2:48:28.700 --> 2:48:30.700]  By the way, I'm celebrating the photo that you lie.
[2:48:30.700 --> 2:48:59.700]  Steve Austin can piss up a rope.
[2:49:00.700 --> 2:49:03.700]  I'm trying to overthrow police and put leftists in control.
[2:49:03.700 --> 2:49:07.700]  This is a totally sickening, disgusting joke.
[2:49:07.700 --> 2:49:10.700]  You ever heard the saying, keep your friends close, enemies closer.
[2:49:10.700 --> 2:49:13.700]  Leftists are evil and they divide and conquer people.
[2:49:13.700 --> 2:49:19.700]  But at the heart of them is a eugenics-based depopulation operation.
[2:49:19.700 --> 2:49:23.700]  Why aren't Black Lives Matter at Cold Springs Harbor in New York
[2:49:23.700 --> 2:49:26.700]  where they run the whole operation trying to topple statues?
[2:49:26.700 --> 2:49:30.700]  Why aren't they at the United Nations because they're controlled by the UN
[2:49:30.700 --> 2:49:34.700]  and being directed by their masters?
[2:49:34.700 --> 2:49:36.700]  I was talking to my Patriot supplier, great suppliers.
[2:49:36.700 --> 2:49:39.700]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[2:49:39.700 --> 2:49:40.700]  It's the highest quality.
[2:49:40.700 --> 2:49:41.700]  They've got it.
[2:49:41.700 --> 2:49:46.700]  Use this little rest we have caught in the current to come up to the service.
[2:49:46.700 --> 2:49:48.700]  Get some air before you get sucked back down.
[2:49:48.700 --> 2:49:50.700]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[2:49:50.700 --> 2:49:53.700]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[2:49:53.700 --> 2:49:59.700]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense trying to fully stop the globalists.
[2:49:59.700 --> 2:50:02.700]  We've given them a good run and I think down the road they'll be defeated,
[2:50:02.700 --> 2:50:06.700]  but we are going to still go down the hard road now.
[2:50:06.700 --> 2:50:08.700]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down,
[2:50:08.700 --> 2:50:12.700]  but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[2:50:12.700 --> 2:50:14.700]  You need to get high quality, storeable food.
[2:50:14.700 --> 2:50:15.700]  It's something you need.
[2:50:15.700 --> 2:50:18.700]  We have high quality ready to get out to you and it supports the broadcast.
[2:50:18.700 --> 2:50:23.700]  So please take care of your storable foods needs at infowarstore.com
[2:50:23.700 --> 2:50:24.700]  and get your orders in now.
[2:50:24.700 --> 2:50:25.700]  So you get it.
[2:50:25.700 --> 2:50:26.700]  So you have it.
[2:50:26.700 --> 2:50:27.700]  It's in great containers.
[2:50:27.700 --> 2:50:28.700]  High quality.
[2:50:28.700 --> 2:50:29.700]  Last 25 years.
[2:50:29.700 --> 2:50:31.700]  Get it while you can because if you think things are about to let up,
[2:50:31.700 --> 2:50:57.700]  you ain't seen nothing yet.
[2:50:57.700 --> 2:51:07.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[2:51:07.700 --> 2:51:36.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:36.700 --> 2:52:05.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[2:52:05.700 --> 2:52:29.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[2:52:29.700 --> 2:52:34.700]  Nothing like this has ever happened in my life.
[2:52:34.700 --> 2:52:38.700]  The economy is dead.
[2:52:38.700 --> 2:52:45.700]  The politicians who launched the COVID war have killed it.
[2:52:45.700 --> 2:52:47.700]  It is not coming back.
[2:52:47.700 --> 2:52:53.700]  And that was the line I used to hear from all these little liberals over here
[2:52:53.700 --> 2:53:01.700]  around the area up in Woodstock with their key sheeting grins and balsamic smiles.
[2:53:01.700 --> 2:53:05.700]  It'll come back.
[2:53:05.700 --> 2:53:14.700]  They're all belching out of their dumb heads when their governor Cuomo locked the joint down
[2:53:14.700 --> 2:53:20.700]  as Abbott over there and Abbott and Costello land where you are in info wars.
[2:53:20.700 --> 2:53:22.700]  Oh, we're getting more cases.
[2:53:22.700 --> 2:53:24.700]  Oh, we're getting more cases.
[2:53:24.700 --> 2:53:25.700]  Hey, cut zone.
[2:53:25.700 --> 2:53:26.700]  Hey, imbecile.
[2:53:26.700 --> 2:53:27.700]  Hey, moron.
[2:53:27.700 --> 2:53:28.700]  Hey, jerk.
[2:53:28.700 --> 2:53:33.700]  You're getting more cases because more people are getting tested.
[2:53:33.700 --> 2:53:34.700]  Got it?
[2:53:34.700 --> 2:53:40.700]  Could you figure that out?
[2:53:40.700 --> 2:53:42.700]  What's the death rate?
[2:53:42.700 --> 2:53:45.700]  Wow, the CDC says, you know what?
[2:53:45.700 --> 2:53:48.700]  There's probably about 20 million cases in America.
[2:53:48.700 --> 2:53:50.700]  Oh, OK.
[2:53:50.700 --> 2:53:59.700]  20 million cases about how many died the last time I looked about 145,150,000.
[2:53:59.700 --> 2:54:12.700]  So your death rate is about 99.23 of a recovery rate, I should say.
[2:54:12.700 --> 2:54:19.700]  So the 99.3% of the people that get it recover.
[2:54:19.700 --> 2:54:25.700]  And as we've been reporting in the Trends Journal, taking the quotes from places like Associated Press,
[2:54:25.700 --> 2:54:34.700]  you know, the mainstream media, most people that get it have symptoms, blah, blah, blah,
[2:54:34.700 --> 2:54:39.700]  recover, blah, blah, blah, blah, and that's the end of it.
[2:54:39.700 --> 2:54:42.700]  They recover.
[2:54:42.700 --> 2:54:45.700]  You ever get sick before?
[2:54:45.700 --> 2:54:50.700]  And then you look at the other facts.
[2:54:50.700 --> 2:54:57.700]  The fact is that at minimum, at minimum in America,
[2:54:57.700 --> 2:55:07.700]  because the slimy CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Propaganda,
[2:55:07.700 --> 2:55:12.700]  said to the nursing home companies that haven't reported it in about 23 states,
[2:55:12.700 --> 2:55:15.700]  I don't worry about the earlier numbers.
[2:55:15.700 --> 2:55:22.700]  Just report how many died since like May 10th or something like that, early May.
[2:55:22.700 --> 2:55:35.700]  When the numbers spiked in April,
[2:55:35.700 --> 2:55:44.700]  even with that fake number, you have the fourth of July, 2020.
[2:55:44.700 --> 2:55:48.700]  We are here and despite all the globalist attacks,
[2:55:48.700 --> 2:55:53.700]  you the viewers and listeners of this transmission have supported us by prayer, by word of mouth,
[2:55:53.700 --> 2:55:57.700]  by buying the products, and you have done all of this.
[2:55:57.700 --> 2:56:00.700]  So when you look at the huge effect M4 Wars has had,
[2:56:00.700 --> 2:56:05.700]  I want you to understand that it's because of what you have done.
[2:56:05.700 --> 2:56:11.700]  And myself and the whole crew salute you on this July 4th, 2020.
[2:56:11.700 --> 2:56:14.700]  We've got a lot of our best-selling products that were sold out,
[2:56:14.700 --> 2:56:19.700]  DNA Force Plus, Bodies, Ultra 12, and others that have been sold out for months.
[2:56:19.700 --> 2:56:23.700]  Back in stock, 50% off for the 4th of July.
[2:56:23.700 --> 2:56:24.700]  We're running the special.
[2:56:24.700 --> 2:56:28.700]  I want to encourage you to get these products because they have enriched my life so much.
[2:56:28.700 --> 2:56:30.700]  I know they'll enrich your life.
[2:56:30.700 --> 2:56:34.700]  And regardless, it's a total 360 win because it funds the M4 War.
[2:56:34.700 --> 2:56:37.700]  The only way we fail is when you don't take action.
[2:56:37.700 --> 2:56:38.700]  I don't need to tell you that.
[2:56:38.700 --> 2:56:39.700]  You already took action.
[2:56:39.700 --> 2:56:59.700]  And I salute and thank you.
[2:56:59.700 --> 2:57:09.700]  Harold Solente.
[2:57:09.700 --> 2:57:12.700]  I was talking about the nursing homes,
[2:57:12.700 --> 2:57:15.700]  and how most of the people who died in America come from them.
[2:57:15.700 --> 2:57:17.700]  At minimum 40%.
[2:57:17.700 --> 2:57:20.700]  So subtract 40% from what?
[2:57:20.700 --> 2:57:23.700]  About the 145,000, 50,000 dead.
[2:57:23.700 --> 2:57:24.700]  You've got a pretty low number.
[2:57:24.700 --> 2:57:27.700]  And then you put the rest of the people who died.
[2:57:27.700 --> 2:57:31.700]  Only 42% of Americans are obese.
[2:57:31.700 --> 2:57:33.700]  And they're in great shape.
[2:57:33.700 --> 2:57:36.700]  No hip problems, no knee problems, no back problems.
[2:57:36.700 --> 2:57:39.700]  All that extra weight, it's fine.
[2:57:39.700 --> 2:57:41.700]  It's fine.
[2:57:41.700 --> 2:57:45.700]  We don't go to the hospital for anything.
[2:57:45.700 --> 2:57:46.700]  Type 2 diabetes.
[2:57:46.700 --> 2:57:48.700]  Keep eating that junk.
[2:57:48.700 --> 2:57:50.700]  Swallow it down.
[2:57:50.700 --> 2:57:51.700]  Swallow it down.
[2:57:51.700 --> 2:57:56.700]  So at least 43% of U.S. cases are linked to nursing homes.
[2:57:56.700 --> 2:58:00.700]  What the hell are you closing down the entire economy for?
[2:58:00.700 --> 2:58:03.700]  And then you hear these little pieces of garbage,
[2:58:03.700 --> 2:58:08.700]  like the clown boy over there in Florida playing health minister.
[2:58:08.700 --> 2:58:11.700]  Health minister, the dictators.
[2:58:11.700 --> 2:58:14.700]  Telling the people to wear masks because, oh,
[2:58:14.700 --> 2:58:20.700]  and then you can get your grandfather and grandmother's shit.
[2:58:20.700 --> 2:58:22.700]  And that's the only people they put on.
[2:58:22.700 --> 2:58:25.700]  They don't put on the people that say, hey, listen,
[2:58:25.700 --> 2:58:30.700]  imbecile, hey, listen, wacky.
[2:58:30.700 --> 2:58:35.700]  It's not natural to wear a face mask
[2:58:35.700 --> 2:58:45.700]  when you should be breathing in nature's air.
[2:58:45.700 --> 2:58:49.700]  That's all they do are put out the people
[2:58:49.700 --> 2:58:52.700]  that they want to keep selling fear and hysteria to.
[2:58:52.700 --> 2:58:54.700]  And again, the reasons the numbers are going up
[2:58:54.700 --> 2:58:57.700]  is because more people are freaking out and getting tested.
[2:58:57.700 --> 2:58:59.700]  It's a freak zone.
[2:58:59.700 --> 2:59:02.700]  I watch people at night walking up and down the street.
[2:59:02.700 --> 2:59:04.700]  Oh, yeah, not a soul on.
[2:59:04.700 --> 2:59:05.700]  And they got their masks on.
[2:59:05.700 --> 2:59:09.700]  I saw a couple walking down the street with his arm over the girl
[2:59:09.700 --> 2:59:13.700]  and her arm around his waist with masks on.
[2:59:13.700 --> 2:59:16.700]  Hey, you're going to have a great time with that mask on, huh?
[2:59:16.700 --> 2:59:22.700]  Yeah, maybe you get that, uh, that sadomasochism.
[2:59:22.700 --> 2:59:28.700]  Oh, yeah, you'll like that.
[2:59:28.700 --> 2:59:30.700]  This is a fraud.
[2:59:30.700 --> 2:59:36.700]  The global economy has been destroyed.
[2:59:36.700 --> 2:59:39.700]  It's been killed by the politicians
[2:59:39.700 --> 2:59:42.700]  that launched the COVID war.
[2:59:42.700 --> 2:59:46.700]  It's not coming back.
[2:59:46.700 --> 2:59:50.700]  What arrogant freaks we have running the show
[2:59:50.700 --> 2:59:54.700]  is that people better stand up and fight for their freedom.
[2:59:54.700 --> 2:59:57.700]  And I'm doing everything I can, as Alex Jones does as well,
[2:59:57.700 --> 3:00:03.700]  holding that rally yesterday.
[3:00:03.700 --> 3:00:05.700]  And I'm holding one up here in Kingston
[3:00:05.700 --> 3:00:11.700]  on the four corners of freedom, the crown gardens.
[3:00:11.700 --> 3:00:16.700]  Historical museum setting.
[3:00:16.700 --> 3:00:23.700]  1774 House, 1763,
[3:00:23.700 --> 3:00:29.700]  1750 and 1691 with the seeds of democracy was sown.
[3:00:29.700 --> 3:00:33.700]  Judge Napolitano will be here as one of the speakers.
[3:00:33.700 --> 3:00:38.700]  You go to OccupyPeace.com, OccupyPeace.com for more information.
[3:00:38.700 --> 3:00:43.700]  If you can't make it, send some money for OccupyPeace
[3:00:43.700 --> 3:00:48.700]  so we can keep fighting. We can't do this on our own.
[3:00:48.700 --> 3:00:51.700]  I'm not going down with this, man.
[3:00:51.700 --> 3:00:54.700]  I am not going to live my life in misery
[3:00:54.700 --> 3:00:56.700]  that they're inflicting upon us.
[3:00:56.700 --> 3:00:58.700]  You're not allowed to have a good time selecting.
[3:00:58.700 --> 3:01:02.700]  I am your governor's slime dictator Cuomo.
[3:01:02.700 --> 3:01:06.700]  I will tell you what to do.
[3:01:06.700 --> 3:01:10.700]  You have no constitutional rights.
[3:01:10.700 --> 3:01:21.700]  Your constitutional rights, your bill of rights
[3:01:21.700 --> 3:01:25.700]  is as important as the toilet paper of record,
[3:01:25.700 --> 3:01:27.700]  the New York Times.
[3:01:27.700 --> 3:01:33.700]  You could use all three of them to use what toilet paper is
[3:01:33.700 --> 3:01:39.700]  because I'm the dick caster of your community.
[3:01:39.700 --> 3:01:42.700]  You're mayor, you're governor.
[3:01:42.700 --> 3:01:47.700]  I will tell you what to do, you little piece of crap.
[3:01:47.700 --> 3:01:53.700]  You won't pay me. You're nothing.
[3:01:53.700 --> 3:01:59.700]  All you are is a plantation worker in Slavelandia.
[3:01:59.700 --> 3:02:04.700]  I'm fighting.
[3:02:04.700 --> 3:02:10.700]  You want to just shoot your mouth off or do nothing? Great.
[3:02:10.700 --> 3:02:14.700]  Great.
[3:02:14.700 --> 3:02:19.700]  Well, if you want to do something, get up here
[3:02:19.700 --> 3:02:22.700]  where the seeds of democracy was sown next Saturday,
[3:02:22.700 --> 3:02:26.700]  this Saturday, July 4th, Independence Day.
[3:02:26.700 --> 3:02:29.700]  Look at the freaks. Look at the freaks.
[3:02:29.700 --> 3:02:34.700]  They're masks on.
[3:02:34.700 --> 3:02:36.700]  Look at them.
[3:02:36.700 --> 3:02:40.700]  You know what that little slime rotten piece of crap Cuomo said?
[3:02:40.700 --> 3:02:44.700]  It's in our trends journal.
[3:02:44.700 --> 3:02:49.700]  We're going to culturalize wearing masks.
[3:02:49.700 --> 3:02:53.700]  We're going to make it part of the culture.
[3:02:53.700 --> 3:02:56.700]  And then you know what they're going to do next?
[3:02:56.700 --> 3:03:01.700]  They say to masochists,
[3:03:01.700 --> 3:03:04.700]  they're going to force us to get vaccinated.
[3:03:04.700 --> 3:03:10.700]  You got it. You got it.
[3:03:10.700 --> 3:03:21.700]  Judge Andrew Napolitano and Gerald Salenti defy Cuomo
[3:03:21.700 --> 3:03:29.700]  will hold you night for peace and restore freedom rally
[3:03:29.700 --> 3:03:32.700]  on the 4th of July in the crown gardens
[3:03:32.700 --> 3:03:36.700]  on the most historic four corners in America.
[3:03:36.700 --> 3:03:38.700]  We're going to have bans.
[3:03:38.700 --> 3:03:41.700]  We want to get a permit to have the bans.
[3:03:41.700 --> 3:03:44.700]  The city called us back.
[3:03:44.700 --> 3:03:46.700]  You ready for this?
[3:03:46.700 --> 3:03:51.700]  The governor said you're not allowed to have bans play outside.
[3:03:51.700 --> 3:03:53.700]  Can you imagine that?
[3:03:53.700 --> 3:03:57.700]  Hey, little boy Cuomo, come over here and stop me.
[3:03:57.700 --> 3:04:00.700]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[3:04:00.700 --> 3:04:03.700]  Don't bring your storm troopers.
[3:04:03.700 --> 3:04:06.700]  Bring you in Frado to stop us.
[3:04:06.700 --> 3:04:07.700]  That's right.
[3:04:07.700 --> 3:04:10.700]  The two of you against two of us,
[3:04:10.700 --> 3:04:14.700]  two of me and one of my men against you two.
[3:04:14.700 --> 3:04:17.700]  Come on. Come on.
[3:04:17.700 --> 3:04:19.700]  Come and stop us.
[3:04:19.700 --> 3:04:22.700]  You and little Frado, stick it up here.
[3:04:22.700 --> 3:04:23.700]  You know what?
[3:04:23.700 --> 3:04:26.700]  Come and stop us.
[3:04:26.700 --> 3:04:31.700]  July 4, 3 p.m.
[3:04:31.700 --> 3:04:34.700]  I will not live my life in misery.
[3:04:34.700 --> 3:04:36.700]  I love freedom.
[3:04:36.700 --> 3:04:39.700]  I love having a good time.
[3:04:39.700 --> 3:04:42.700]  I like rocking and rolling, bopping and a reeling.
[3:04:42.700 --> 3:04:46.700]  I like to boogie.
[3:04:46.700 --> 3:04:51.700]  I like to go outside.
[3:04:51.700 --> 3:04:55.700]  No more. No more.
[3:04:55.700 --> 3:05:00.700]  You are under out of control.
[3:05:00.700 --> 3:05:05.700]  You got it?
[3:05:05.700 --> 3:05:09.700]  We have to fight for it.
[3:05:09.700 --> 3:05:11.700]  It's gone.
[3:05:11.700 --> 3:05:17.700]  And the propaganda is telling us how wonderful it is to wear a mask.
[3:05:17.700 --> 3:05:21.700]  How to get used to it.
[3:05:21.700 --> 3:05:26.700]  A restaurant that I used to go to won't go back again.
[3:05:26.700 --> 3:05:32.700]  Waving is the new handshake.
[3:05:32.700 --> 3:05:34.700]  And hugging.
[3:05:34.700 --> 3:05:38.700]  No waving, no handshakes, no hugging, only wave.
[3:05:38.700 --> 3:05:41.700]  Who the hell are you to tell me that?
[3:05:41.700 --> 3:05:48.700]  Take your little poster and shove it.
[3:05:48.700 --> 3:05:51.700]  Mr. Salenti, you should calm down.
[3:05:51.700 --> 3:05:55.700]  You should not raise your voice.
[3:05:55.700 --> 3:05:59.700]  You should be a coward like the rest of us.
[3:05:59.700 --> 3:06:04.700]  We're in the third grade. You got it?
[3:06:04.700 --> 3:06:06.700]  We're in the third grade.
[3:06:06.700 --> 3:06:11.700]  You got your teachers telling you what to do.
[3:06:11.700 --> 3:06:17.700]  The masks speak by the freaks that keep selling them.
[3:06:17.700 --> 3:06:26.700]  The cowards, the cartoon news networks, the MSNBCFUs.
[3:06:26.700 --> 3:06:31.700]  One after another, disgusting.
[3:06:31.700 --> 3:06:37.700]  We have to unite for freedom and support info work.
[3:06:37.700 --> 3:06:39.700]  Define their products.
[3:06:39.700 --> 3:06:43.700]  When I thank the listeners of this broadcast, I'm not patting you on the head.
[3:06:43.700 --> 3:06:50.700]  I'm like a person that's been thrown overboard who finds a life raft to get on or a piece of driftwood.
[3:06:50.700 --> 3:06:52.700]  I am clinging to you.
[3:06:52.700 --> 3:06:55.700]  So when you call the show and thank me, listen, I'm thanking you too.
[3:06:55.700 --> 3:06:57.700]  We are in this together.
[3:06:57.700 --> 3:07:01.700]  We try to bring you things that I know are amazing, that have helped me and my family.
[3:07:01.700 --> 3:07:03.700]  So you get a great response. You order again.
[3:07:03.700 --> 3:07:05.700]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[3:07:05.700 --> 3:07:07.700]  It's not a science. It's not a plan.
[3:07:07.700 --> 3:07:09.700]  It's just the way to do it. It's just common sense.
[3:07:09.700 --> 3:07:12.700]  And if you get one product, it's bodies.
[3:07:12.700 --> 3:07:17.700]  Now, our big Fourth of July Supercell is going right now through Fourth of July.
[3:07:17.700 --> 3:07:19.700]  And bodies have been sold out for over three months.
[3:07:19.700 --> 3:07:23.700]  It's now back in stock. It is the strongest turmeric concentrate we can find out there.
[3:07:23.700 --> 3:07:25.700]  It may be the strongest on the market.
[3:07:25.700 --> 3:07:27.700]  Somebody might have one stronger. We don't know about it or we doubt it.
[3:07:27.700 --> 3:07:29.700]  It is back in stock at 50% off.
[3:07:29.700 --> 3:07:33.700]  I want to encourage you all to get bodies, ultimate turmeric formula while you still can.
[3:07:33.700 --> 3:07:35.700]  50% off for the Fourth of July.

[3:07:49.700 --> 3:07:51.700]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[3:07:51.700 --> 3:07:57.700]  Where did it come from?
[3:07:57.700 --> 3:07:59.700]  infoworthshore.com

[3:08:35.700 --> 3:08:47.700]  Other systems just don't compare.
[3:09:05.700 --> 3:09:15.700]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:09:15.700 --> 3:09:21.700]  So as I was saying, it's the media that started selling this hype.
[3:09:21.700 --> 3:09:23.700]  And that's all it is.
[3:09:23.700 --> 3:09:25.700]  Again, only by the facts.
[3:09:25.700 --> 3:09:28.700]  Go back to the Asian flu.
[3:09:28.700 --> 3:09:30.700]  When I was a youth.
[3:09:30.700 --> 3:09:32.700]  57, 58.
[3:09:32.700 --> 3:09:35.700]  People died worldwide.
[3:09:35.700 --> 3:09:37.700]  Oh, we got a half a million now.
[3:09:37.700 --> 3:09:39.700]  I'll catch it up.
[3:09:39.700 --> 3:09:42.700]  Oh, back then there were 3 billion people on the planet.
[3:09:42.700 --> 3:09:47.700]  We've only added 4.8 billion people since.
[3:09:47.700 --> 3:09:52.700]  So if you go by the same standards back in 57, 58,
[3:09:52.700 --> 3:09:55.700]  rather than 500,000 dead worldwide,
[3:09:55.700 --> 3:09:59.700]  we have 2.6 million dead worldwide by now.
[3:09:59.700 --> 3:10:04.700]  Forget about that. We won't talk about that.
[3:10:04.700 --> 3:10:06.700]  They're selling fear and hysteria.
[3:10:06.700 --> 3:10:09.700]  They didn't lock down the economy back then,
[3:10:09.700 --> 3:10:11.700]  but they're locking it down now.
[3:10:11.700 --> 3:10:17.700]  The economy is dead.
[3:10:17.700 --> 3:10:22.700]  The politicians that launched the COVID war killed it.
[3:10:22.700 --> 3:10:26.700]  Just like the other wars that they launched, they have no exit strategy.
[3:10:26.700 --> 3:10:31.700]  Sick, mentally deranged individuals.
[3:10:31.700 --> 3:10:34.700]  That's why they run for office.
[3:10:34.700 --> 3:10:39.700]  The vast majority of power hungry freaks.
[3:10:39.700 --> 3:10:47.700]  What's going on on Wall Street has absolutely nothing to do with going on in Main Street.
[3:10:47.700 --> 3:10:50.700]  Yelp. Yelp.
[3:10:50.700 --> 3:10:54.700]  Yelp came out with a report last week.
[3:10:54.700 --> 3:10:59.700]  That's the place you go to to find out that restaurant if you want to go there to eat.
[3:10:59.700 --> 3:11:04.700]  53% will not reopen.
[3:11:04.700 --> 3:11:07.700]  53%.
[3:11:07.700 --> 3:11:12.700]  Oh, it'll come back. It'll come back.
[3:11:12.700 --> 3:11:16.700]  No, it won't. It'll go down.
[3:11:16.700 --> 3:11:23.700]  And the harder it goes down, the more this becomes a police state.
[3:11:23.700 --> 3:11:30.700]  Because there's going to be violence like we have never seen before.
[3:11:30.700 --> 3:11:35.700]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[3:11:35.700 --> 3:11:42.700]  And they're going to be losing it big time.
[3:11:42.700 --> 3:11:46.700]  The death rates.
[3:11:46.700 --> 3:11:48.700]  Here in New York.
[3:11:48.700 --> 3:11:53.700]  Up, homicide is back.
[3:11:53.700 --> 3:11:55.700]  Yelp, around the country.
[3:11:55.700 --> 3:11:58.700]  Going up, going up.
[3:11:58.700 --> 3:12:01.700]  And the hypocrisy.
[3:12:01.700 --> 3:12:09.700]  Locking us down while they allow black lives matter.
[3:12:09.700 --> 3:12:11.700]  Another protest is to protest.
[3:12:11.700 --> 3:12:13.700]  But not us.
[3:12:13.700 --> 3:12:15.700]  We can't get a permit.
[3:12:15.700 --> 3:12:22.700]  We can't allow no bands playing by orders of the dictator.
[3:12:22.700 --> 3:12:26.700]  Governor Cuomo.
[3:12:26.700 --> 3:12:29.700]  Murder in the first degree.
[3:12:29.700 --> 3:12:33.700]  That's what they committed against the people.
[3:12:33.700 --> 3:12:39.700]  And now the people are killing others as they get desperate.
[3:12:39.700 --> 3:12:43.700]  Oh, they're all upset in New York City now because people are shooting off fireworks.
[3:12:43.700 --> 3:12:45.700]  Imagine that.
[3:12:45.700 --> 3:12:47.700]  Imagine celebrating the 4th of July.
[3:12:47.700 --> 3:12:53.700]  We're going to crack down on that since that little old life, de Blasio.
[3:12:53.700 --> 3:12:56.700]  Talking about elder care, right?
[3:12:56.700 --> 3:13:00.700]  Elders, virus, deaths, tests, Canada.
[3:13:00.700 --> 3:13:03.700]  Wall Street Journal.
[3:13:03.700 --> 3:13:07.700]  In Canada.
[3:13:07.700 --> 3:13:11.700]  You know what the percentage of people that died
[3:13:11.700 --> 3:13:16.700]  from the virus were from nursing homes?
[3:13:16.700 --> 3:13:19.700]  Only 80%.
[3:13:19.700 --> 3:13:21.700]  But close down the whole place.
[3:13:21.700 --> 3:13:23.700]  I'm a little true dough.
[3:13:23.700 --> 3:13:25.700]  I'm a little true dough.
[3:13:25.700 --> 3:13:30.700]  Another little nobody boy like Andy Cuomo.
[3:13:30.700 --> 3:13:33.700]  A little boy born on third base.
[3:13:33.700 --> 3:13:35.700]  And thought I hit a home run.
[3:13:35.700 --> 3:13:39.700]  A little son of a gun.
[3:13:39.700 --> 3:13:41.700]  A little arrogant nobody.
[3:13:41.700 --> 3:13:43.700]  A little piece of crap.
[3:13:43.700 --> 3:13:47.700]  I'm the leader of Canada.
[3:13:47.700 --> 3:13:49.700]  And you will do what I say.
[3:13:49.700 --> 3:13:54.700]  All your little low life pieces of garbage crap.
[3:13:54.700 --> 3:13:57.700]  A junior, nothing.
[3:13:57.700 --> 3:13:59.700]  What did this little clown do?
[3:13:59.700 --> 3:14:08.700]  What he was teaching, you know, theatrics in college or something like that?
[3:14:08.700 --> 3:14:16.700]  Yeah, how to be a phony on the presidential reality show.
[3:14:16.700 --> 3:14:19.700]  80%.
[3:14:19.700 --> 3:14:22.700]  80%.
[3:14:22.700 --> 3:14:24.700]  You got it?
[3:14:24.700 --> 3:14:27.700]  Hey, how about that place, Sweden that didn't lock down at all?
[3:14:27.700 --> 3:14:32.700]  Oh, well, they had a higher death rate than their Nordic cousins, the neighbors.
[3:14:32.700 --> 3:14:36.700]  They had the same death rate as France.
[3:14:36.700 --> 3:14:39.700]  As the UK.
[3:14:39.700 --> 3:14:42.700]  As Ireland.
[3:14:42.700 --> 3:14:45.700]  And guess what?
[3:14:45.700 --> 3:14:50.700]  86% of the people came from nursing homes that died.
[3:14:50.700 --> 3:14:52.700]  Oh, and let's not forget the other one.
[3:14:52.700 --> 3:14:56.700]  Even they're cooking the numbers in America.
[3:14:56.700 --> 3:15:04.700]  They're cooking the numbers in America because you don't have to prove that they died from the virus.
[3:15:04.700 --> 3:15:06.700]  You only have to suspect it.
[3:15:06.700 --> 3:15:13.700]  And the hospitals like it because they get more money from having COVID deaths, from having COVID deaths.
[3:15:13.700 --> 3:15:16.700]  He's dead set up to nothing.
[3:15:16.700 --> 3:15:18.700]  And they destroyed our economy.
[3:15:18.700 --> 3:15:20.700]  They killed it.
[3:15:20.700 --> 3:15:23.700]  We're going into the greatest depression.
[3:15:23.700 --> 3:15:25.700]  The markets are booming again today.
[3:15:25.700 --> 3:15:28.700]  Has nothing to do with what's going on in real life.
[3:15:28.700 --> 3:15:33.700]  Nothing, zero, nada.
[3:15:33.700 --> 3:15:37.700]  Totally disconnected.
[3:15:37.700 --> 3:15:42.700]  We are going to go through the hottest summer that I've ever lived through.
[3:15:42.700 --> 3:15:46.700]  The worst one was 1968.
[3:15:46.700 --> 3:15:48.700]  We had all those riots.
[3:15:48.700 --> 3:15:51.700]  Just to look like nothing.
[3:15:51.700 --> 3:15:55.700]  And all the protesters.
[3:15:55.700 --> 3:15:59.700]  They'll protest to everything but freedom.
[3:15:59.700 --> 3:16:01.700]  Freedom doesn't count to them.
[3:16:01.700 --> 3:16:03.700]  Let's take government to take over.
[3:16:03.700 --> 3:16:08.700]  Because they're gutless little nothings, boys and girls.
[3:16:08.700 --> 3:16:18.700]  Liberals have become, as my great friend and board member on Occupy Peace, Neil Pacifico says,
[3:16:18.700 --> 3:16:21.700]  liberals have become the new fascists.
[3:16:21.700 --> 3:16:22.700]  That's right.
[3:16:22.700 --> 3:16:24.700]  You have to obey what they want.
[3:16:24.700 --> 3:16:27.700]  You have no right to think for yourself or be yourself.
[3:16:27.700 --> 3:16:28.700]  You have no freedoms.
[3:16:28.700 --> 3:16:30.700]  You will do what we tell you to do.
[3:16:30.700 --> 3:16:32.700]  You will get vaccinated.
[3:16:32.700 --> 3:16:35.700]  You will obey our orders.
[3:16:35.700 --> 3:16:39.700]  We are in charge.
[3:16:39.700 --> 3:16:47.700]  We are the cowards of the country.
[3:16:47.700 --> 3:16:51.700]  They could do anything they want, but we can't do what we want.
[3:16:51.700 --> 3:16:52.700]  Yes, we can.
[3:16:52.700 --> 3:16:54.700]  And we're doing it.
[3:16:54.700 --> 3:17:00.700]  July 4th, unite for peace and restore freedom rally.
[3:17:00.700 --> 3:17:03.700]  Making up this stuff six feet apart.
[3:17:03.700 --> 3:17:05.700]  You have shoved that six feet along with your mask up.
[3:17:05.700 --> 3:17:06.700]  You know what?
[3:17:06.700 --> 3:17:08.700]  The wind doesn't blow in circles.
[3:17:08.700 --> 3:17:11.700]  It doesn't blow vertically or horizontally.
[3:17:11.700 --> 3:17:14.700]  It blows at exactly six feet.
[3:17:14.700 --> 3:17:16.700]  And I'm your governor.
[3:17:16.700 --> 3:17:17.700]  I'm a blowhard.
[3:17:17.700 --> 3:17:23.700]  I know how hard it blows because that's all I do is blow it out.
[3:17:23.700 --> 3:17:27.700]  And you, the little people, suck it up.
[3:17:27.700 --> 3:17:29.700]  I'm a visionary.
[3:17:29.700 --> 3:17:34.700]  And what I see in the future is hell on Earth.
[3:17:34.700 --> 3:18:02.700]  Unless we stop it, we'll be right back.
[3:18:02.700 --> 3:18:04.700]  This is a couple of us.
[3:18:04.700 --> 3:18:07.700]  We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[3:18:07.700 --> 3:18:11.700]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla.
[3:18:11.700 --> 3:18:14.700]  And I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar.
[3:18:14.700 --> 3:18:16.700]  And I just want to thank you for that, man.
[3:18:16.700 --> 3:18:19.700]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term,
[3:18:19.700 --> 3:18:21.700]  high-quality energy powder there is.
[3:18:21.700 --> 3:18:24.700]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[3:18:24.700 --> 3:18:26.700]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues,
[3:18:26.700 --> 3:18:29.700]  but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.

[3:22:32.700 --> 3:22:35.700]  The quicker we win.
[3:22:35.700 --> 3:22:40.700]  Because who we're fighting against our gutless little liberals.
[3:22:40.700 --> 3:22:44.700]  They're the ones that are really pushed through this fear and hysteria.
[3:22:44.700 --> 3:22:50.700]  It started in California in Silicon Valley by the little geeks.
[3:22:50.700 --> 3:22:52.700]  The nothing little boys.
[3:22:52.700 --> 3:22:54.700]  The Zuckerbergs.
[3:22:54.700 --> 3:22:57.700]  The Dorsey's.
[3:22:57.700 --> 3:23:01.700]  The cooks and the other clowns.
[3:23:01.700 --> 3:23:07.700]  As soon as the coronavirus struck nursing homes in Washington state.
[3:23:07.700 --> 3:23:10.700]  That's when the freak show began.
[3:23:10.700 --> 3:23:12.700]  Everybody's going to work from home.
[3:23:12.700 --> 3:23:14.700]  We don't want you coming in.
[3:23:14.700 --> 3:23:18.700]  We're spreading fear and hysteria.
[3:23:18.700 --> 3:23:22.700]  That's who did it.
[3:23:22.700 --> 3:23:25.700]  And it just keeps going.
[3:23:25.700 --> 3:23:32.700]  So you're also Zuckerberg is you're going to protest.
[3:23:32.700 --> 3:23:35.700]  Locking down.
[3:23:35.700 --> 3:23:41.700]  In Michigan by Whitmere or witless, whoever the governor's name is.
[3:23:41.700 --> 3:23:44.700]  And you wanted people to come.
[3:23:44.700 --> 3:23:47.700]  You can't do it on Zuckerberg's.
[3:23:47.700 --> 3:23:49.700]  Facebook.
[3:23:49.700 --> 3:23:54.700]  With banning you with banning you on Twitter with banning you on YouTube.
[3:23:54.700 --> 3:23:56.700]  We're in charge.
[3:23:56.700 --> 3:23:59.700]  You're nothing more than slaves and slave landier.
[3:23:59.700 --> 3:24:04.700]  And that's why you have to support info wars.
[3:24:04.700 --> 3:24:11.700]  And of course the trends journal and occupied peace to keep the truth alive.
[3:24:11.700 --> 3:24:16.700]  Little Cuomo last week announced hotspots in New York.
[3:24:16.700 --> 3:24:19.700]  Not in New York hotspot states.
[3:24:19.700 --> 3:24:23.700]  Like you folks down there in Texas.
[3:24:23.700 --> 3:24:25.700]  Can't come to New York.
[3:24:25.700 --> 3:24:28.700]  You got to quarantine yourself for 14 days.
[3:24:28.700 --> 3:24:33.700]  And if you don't, $2,000 fine for the first violation.
[3:24:33.700 --> 3:24:37.700]  $5,000 thereafter.
[3:24:37.700 --> 3:24:42.700]  And travelers also could face a $10,000 fee.
[3:24:42.700 --> 3:24:44.700]  If they cause harm, he said.
[3:24:44.700 --> 3:24:46.700]  He said.
[3:24:46.700 --> 3:24:50.700]  He the low life piece of garbage crap said.
[3:24:50.700 --> 3:25:01.700]  He the little daddy's boy born on third base and thought he had a home run said.
[3:25:01.700 --> 3:25:03.700]  You got it.
[3:25:03.700 --> 3:25:06.700]  Hey, murderer Cuomo.
[3:25:06.700 --> 3:25:14.700]  The reason you had such a high death rate here is you took the people out of the hospitals.
[3:25:14.700 --> 3:25:20.700]  And you stuck them into nursing homes that had COVID slimer.
[3:25:20.700 --> 3:25:22.700]  Well, the government said to do that.
[3:25:22.700 --> 3:25:24.700]  You're full of crap.
[3:25:24.700 --> 3:25:29.700]  You shot your fat arrogant mouth off and said the hospitals would be overloaded.
[3:25:29.700 --> 3:25:37.700]  And you had to get the people out of the hospitals.
[3:25:37.700 --> 3:25:39.700]  The hospitals weren't overloaded.
[3:25:39.700 --> 3:25:43.700]  You closed down Javits center, the convention center and made a hospital out of it.
[3:25:43.700 --> 3:25:47.700]  And you told Trump to build in a hospital ship.
[3:25:47.700 --> 3:25:49.700]  And nobody went there.
[3:25:49.700 --> 3:25:54.700]  You lie in piece of garbage slimy crap, sir Cuomo.
[3:25:54.700 --> 3:26:01.700]  Murderer, murderer, murderer in the COVID war.
[3:26:01.700 --> 3:26:12.700]  Just like Bush, just like Clinton, just like Obama, the murderers who take us off to war.
[3:26:12.700 --> 3:26:15.700]  Show you the propaganda.
[3:26:15.700 --> 3:26:18.700]  Look at these little jerks.
[3:26:18.700 --> 3:26:20.700]  Cuomo and his brother.
[3:26:20.700 --> 3:26:22.700]  Anyway, look at them.
[3:26:22.700 --> 3:26:23.700]  Look at them.
[3:26:23.700 --> 3:26:24.700]  Look at them.
[3:26:24.700 --> 3:26:32.700]  How could anybody with a brain bigger than a pea believe these little clowns in most do?
[3:26:32.700 --> 3:26:34.700]  How?
[3:26:34.700 --> 3:26:38.700]  March to Mussolini.
[3:26:38.700 --> 3:26:43.700]  Salute Stalin.
[3:26:43.700 --> 3:26:48.700]  This is from the Wall Street Journal.
[3:26:48.700 --> 3:26:51.700]  So I underline the salient points of these stories.
[3:26:51.700 --> 3:26:54.700]  So I know the data.
[3:26:54.700 --> 3:26:57.700]  And this goes on to say, you ready?
[3:26:57.700 --> 3:27:04.700]  There is no evidence that masks are harmful for adults.
[3:27:04.700 --> 3:27:07.700]  And scientists have reported such measures.
[3:27:07.700 --> 3:27:17.700]  Are essential for society to recover without a spike in disease and deaths.
[3:27:17.700 --> 3:27:19.700]  Total lie.
[3:27:19.700 --> 3:27:24.700]  There is evidence that masks are harmful for seniors.
[3:27:24.700 --> 3:27:26.700]  Who wrote this?
[3:27:26.700 --> 3:27:29.700]  Jeff Horwitz.
[3:27:29.700 --> 3:27:30.700]  So take out of that.
[3:27:30.700 --> 3:27:32.700]  I think he spelled it wrong.
[3:27:32.700 --> 3:27:34.700]  He's a prostitute.
[3:27:34.700 --> 3:27:36.700]  So it's Horwitz.
[3:27:36.700 --> 3:27:42.700]  It's W-H-O-R-E.
[3:27:42.700 --> 3:27:44.700]  Witless.
[3:27:44.700 --> 3:27:48.700]  Jeff Horwitz.
[3:27:48.700 --> 3:27:56.700]  A lying piece of garbage propaganda right in front of your eyes.
[3:27:56.700 --> 3:27:59.700]  Oh, why should I support info wars?
[3:27:59.700 --> 3:28:02.700]  Why should I subscribe to the Trends Journal?
[3:28:02.700 --> 3:28:04.700]  I don't understand.
[3:28:04.700 --> 3:28:06.700]  Well, you know, money's tight.
[3:28:06.700 --> 3:28:11.700]  I'll just buy something else and swallow the crap.
[3:28:11.700 --> 3:28:15.700]  If we don't unite, we're gone.
[3:28:15.700 --> 3:28:18.700]  We're dead.
[3:28:18.700 --> 3:28:29.700]  We'll be living in hell on earth.
[3:28:29.700 --> 3:28:30.700]  Mask on.
[3:28:30.700 --> 3:28:31.700]  Smile off.
[3:28:31.700 --> 3:28:33.700]  Or is it?
[3:28:33.700 --> 3:28:36.700]  The toilet paper of record.
[3:28:36.700 --> 3:28:41.700]  Telling you how wonderful it is now to wear a mask.
[3:28:41.700 --> 3:28:48.700]  And they only quote their one or two slimy little low life experts
[3:28:48.700 --> 3:28:54.700]  and keep everybody else off just like they did when they took us to the Iraq war,
[3:28:54.700 --> 3:28:59.700]  the Afghan war, the Vietnam war, the Korean war.
[3:28:59.700 --> 3:29:04.700]  They only put in the people that sell their war.
[3:29:04.700 --> 3:29:07.700]  Vanessa Knackerson reporting had all the facts.
[3:29:07.700 --> 3:29:09.700]  We put them in the Trends Journal.
[3:29:09.700 --> 3:29:12.700]  Hey, remember they fired that guy Phil Donahue?
[3:29:12.700 --> 3:29:15.700]  Being out against the war.
[3:29:15.700 --> 3:29:20.700]  So support info wars because the war is on.
[3:29:20.700 --> 3:29:26.700]  The war for freedom, justice, and the American way.
[3:29:26.700 --> 3:29:29.700]  I'm all in favor of letting freedom ring.
[3:29:29.700 --> 3:29:32.700]  And you're not going to stop me from doing it.
[3:29:32.700 --> 3:29:58.700]  Are they going to stop you?
[3:29:58.700 --> 3:30:03.700]  We're the zeitgeist and the spirit of liberty together in a symbiotic relationship
[3:30:03.700 --> 3:30:05.700]  that believes in humanity.
[3:30:05.700 --> 3:30:09.700]  And we're willing to face the true horror of the New World Order.
[3:30:09.700 --> 3:30:16.700]  But if we do not support the actual transmission center that's getting the messages out from the guest,
[3:30:16.700 --> 3:30:19.700]  the callers, the host, we will fail.
[3:30:19.700 --> 3:30:21.700]  I'm stating the obvious here.
[3:30:21.700 --> 3:30:24.700]  I just want to thank you on July 4th, 2020 for your support,

[3:32:38.220 --> 3:32:44.380]  2020 is a very special year to the globalists, to the occultists, to those that are into esoteric
[3:32:44.380 --> 3:32:48.260]  mysticism. And they believe this is the year they're going to totally overthrow America
[3:32:48.260 --> 3:32:51.940]  and the world and bring in their anti-God, anti-human tyranny.

[3:35:09.060 --> 3:35:20.140]  alive. Experts sketch gloomy picture of virus spread from the toilet paper record. You know
[3:35:20.140 --> 3:35:28.140]  the experts they quote? Fauci, jaw. That's what Fauci is in Italian, the jaw boner. And
[3:35:28.140 --> 3:35:34.460]  that other clown from the CDC, Dr. Redfield. These are the experts. They never bring in
[3:35:34.460 --> 3:35:39.620]  people that are experts that contradict what they have to say. And that's all they're selling
[3:35:39.620 --> 3:35:54.100]  here. And this is going down big. This is just a little news. Chuck E. Cheese goes bankrupt.
[3:35:54.100 --> 3:36:06.780]  Files of bankruptcy. Macy's to shed 3,900 jobs. Vitaly retailer. GNC goes on the black
[3:36:06.780 --> 3:36:17.540]  for bankruptcy. That's just a touch of a touch. This thing's going down hard. And the markets
[3:36:17.540 --> 3:36:23.380]  keep going up. The markets keep going up because they're rigged. The Federal Reserve is pumping
[3:36:23.380 --> 3:36:28.380]  trillions of dollars into it as our other central banks. There's no relationship to
[3:36:28.380 --> 3:36:36.420]  reality. And you saw the data that the billionaires have become now about 600 billion dollars
[3:36:36.420 --> 3:36:41.900]  richer in the United States since the virus broke out because all the small businesses
[3:36:41.900 --> 3:36:50.020]  are going out of businesses. And the pigs at the top are reading them up and gobbling
[3:36:50.020 --> 3:37:01.580]  up their businesses. I mentioned earlier about Yelp. Yelp finds reopening's lag. Roughly
[3:37:01.580 --> 3:37:08.900]  1,400 Yelp listed businesses that had closed since March 1st remain closed on June 15th.
[3:37:08.900 --> 3:37:16.900]  A large share of that 41% have shut for good according to Yelp. And as I mentioned in the
[3:37:16.900 --> 3:37:32.540]  restaurants, 53% dead. So my forecasts. Gold and silver. Gold's up a little bit today,
[3:37:32.540 --> 3:37:38.420]  but it's hanging around that mark where I believe it's going to break to the 2,000 mark.
[3:37:38.420 --> 3:37:48.860]  When gold breaks to 2,000 and above, I see silver rallying. Most people will then understand
[3:37:48.860 --> 3:37:55.420]  how bad it is and that all this digital trash backed by nothing and printed on nothing is
[3:37:55.420 --> 3:38:03.460]  worth nothing. So I don't tell people what to do. I don't give financial advice, but
[3:38:03.460 --> 3:38:11.020]  is that more in the trends journal? And I want to tell info wars people what I forecast
[3:38:11.020 --> 3:38:18.860]  so that if they have the means to prepare to consider all the opportunities ahead. Another
[3:38:18.860 --> 3:38:25.340]  big one is going to be whole health healing. And a lot of info wars products support that.
[3:38:25.340 --> 3:38:31.060]  You have to build up your immune systems. Nobody talks about that in the mainstream
[3:38:31.060 --> 3:38:45.180]  media. And that's going to be big. And so too is going to be martial arts, self defense.
[3:38:45.180 --> 3:38:56.620]  Big. Big. People going to want to learn how to defend themselves. Just like those people
[3:38:56.620 --> 3:39:03.900]  in St. Louis did. And we're thinking on the same line over here. There you go. Anybody
[3:39:03.900 --> 3:39:09.060]  going to attack them? Look at that woman. Look at that woman. I don't think that woman
[3:39:09.060 --> 3:39:17.500]  has ever complained to me, too. She's who she is. And you watch this thing. It goes
[3:39:17.500 --> 3:39:23.340]  on. She goes around the side alone. The guy goes back up on the top. You get off my property.
[3:39:23.340 --> 3:39:29.020]  They'll blow your brains out. The same thing with me. If somebody breaks into my house,
[3:39:29.020 --> 3:39:36.140]  if somebody breaks in, breaks in, I'll blow their brains out. Simple as that. Tell it
[3:39:36.140 --> 3:39:43.900]  to the judge. How dare you violate my rights? I'm an American. I'm born to be free. So you
[3:39:43.900 --> 3:39:50.940]  could see where this is going. And they went into rich neighborhoods. People had nothing
[3:39:50.940 --> 3:39:57.740]  to do with what went on there. Why are you hounding them? I'll tell you why. Because
[3:39:57.740 --> 3:40:04.740]  it's going to be off with their heads 2.0. They're going to go after people with means.
[3:40:04.740 --> 3:40:14.060]  Means by no means. Ignorant. Just like they're knocking down these statues. Oh, and how about
[3:40:14.060 --> 3:40:20.740]  this hypocrisy? This is my favorite. They're pulling down Woodrow Wilson's name around
[3:40:20.740 --> 3:40:28.500]  everything you're having to do with Princeton University because of his racism. This guy
[3:40:28.500 --> 3:40:35.900]  was president of Princeton before he became president of the United States. And you know
[3:40:35.900 --> 3:40:46.300]  what I say. Harvard, Princeton, Yale, bullets, bombs and banks. How about taking down Woodrow
[3:40:46.300 --> 3:40:56.100]  Wilson's name for selling out the country and turning it over to the banksters when
[3:40:56.100 --> 3:41:03.780]  he created the Federal Reserve Bank that's owned by the Goldman Sachs gang, the JPMorgan
[3:41:03.780 --> 3:41:18.820]  Chase? You know, one after another. How about taking down his name for slaughtering hundreds
[3:41:18.820 --> 3:41:23.860]  of thousands of Americans by sending them overseas to go slaughter other people in World
[3:41:23.860 --> 3:41:33.660]  War One? How about that? How about bringing America into a war we had no business being
[3:41:33.660 --> 3:41:39.820]  in to further destroy Europe and kill our soldiers? And the young kids believe it just
[3:41:39.820 --> 3:41:45.580]  like they believe the COVID war now. Even adults believe it. The dough boys. I'm a Yankee
[3:41:45.580 --> 3:41:55.500]  Doodle dandy. A Yankee Doodle do or die. You got it? How about that murderous piece
[3:41:55.500 --> 3:42:02.060]  of crap, Woodrow Wilson? Why not knock it down for that? No, only because of racism.
[3:42:02.060 --> 3:42:10.340]  Hey, let's be fair here. Take down all the monuments to Obama to Clinton to the Bushes.
[3:42:10.340 --> 3:42:18.500]  That's slaughtered people in the Yemen Wars, the Syrian War, the First Gulf War, the Iraq
[3:42:18.500 --> 3:42:26.540]  War, the Afghan War, the Serbian War, the Yugoslavian War. Sanctions that killed over
[3:42:26.540 --> 3:42:34.460]  half a million people under Clinton. You know the clip. Madeleine Albright telling Leslie
[3:42:34.460 --> 3:42:39.540]  Stahl on 60 Minutes when she was UN ambassador, the death of 500,000 children in Iraq was
[3:42:39.540 --> 3:42:47.140]  worth the price. Yep. How about knocking that stuff down? You little low life garbage
[3:42:47.140 --> 3:43:03.220]  pieces of nothing. No, nothing. How about that? Huh? It was worth it. I was on the QE
[3:43:03.220 --> 3:43:07.540]  two with her. She was the, uh, Madeleine Albright was the keynote speaker the first
[3:43:07.540 --> 3:43:13.860]  night I was the next day. And they gave her like this 15 minute introduction. She looked
[3:43:13.860 --> 3:43:19.660]  like the queen of thoughts in this red outfit. The next day, and then she left the ship and
[3:43:19.660 --> 3:43:25.340]  we went on a cruise. I let it off. They introduced me. They gave me a nice introduction. And
[3:43:25.340 --> 3:43:29.900]  I said to the guy, thank you very much. I said, but you sure changed me after hearing
[3:43:29.900 --> 3:43:34.460]  Madeleine Albright's introduction. Everybody started laughing. And I said, what you also
[3:43:34.460 --> 3:43:41.580]  didn't mention that I graduated without honors from PS 76. So I've been around these people
[3:43:41.580 --> 3:43:47.340]  and they're low lives and they're leading us to hell. So do what you can to support
[3:43:47.340 --> 3:43:58.700]  info was occupied peace.com. Occupied peace.com. Fourth of July rally. Judge Napolitano music,
[3:43:58.700 --> 3:44:10.620]  food, booze and a good time. I want to live my life as an American born to be free. That's
[3:44:10.620 --> 3:44:20.100]  me. Napolitano born in the Bronx, born to be myself. And I thank God that that's where
[3:44:20.100 --> 3:44:25.220]  I was born. And that's who I am. So please join us. And if you can't send some money
[3:44:25.220 --> 3:44:41.260]  to donation.
