[00:00.000 --> 00:29.500]  Let's wind the clocks back five years regardless of your political affiliation your political
[00:29.500 --> 00:36.160]  beliefs anyone that you would have talked to would have said that the United States
[00:36.160 --> 00:42.080]  government is corrupt there is a shadow government and they don't like it they'd like to do
[00:42.080 --> 00:50.640]  something about it people have known this for years a lot of people thought they voted
[00:50.640 --> 01:08.040]  for Obama to end such a state wasn't the case and so imagine a deep state shadow government
[01:08.040 --> 01:15.320]  corruption at the FBI corruption at the CIA five years ago you could have asked just about
[01:15.320 --> 01:23.000]  anyone and they would have probably said yep CIA FBI don't trust them Washington DC is
[01:23.000 --> 01:34.080]  deeply corrupt now what do you think it would look like if someone actually decided to fight
[01:34.080 --> 01:40.640]  back against it what do you think it would look like if we the people actually decided
[01:40.640 --> 01:48.720]  to do something about it what do you think that would look like it looks like everything
[01:48.720 --> 01:58.440]  that you're seeing today that's where we are and it's just amazing to me that people can't
[01:58.440 --> 02:13.800]  see it yet Russian collusion I mean really Obama having a hot mic conversation that he
[02:13.800 --> 02:17.520]  didn't think would get aired talking about oh when I get reelected we'll meet with Putin
[02:17.520 --> 02:23.080]  we'll get you know we'll get the things done oh yeah nobody cared Hillary Clinton receives
[02:23.080 --> 02:28.880]  a hundred and forty million dollars from Russian donations to her foundation Bill Clinton gets
[02:28.880 --> 02:34.920]  half a million dollars for a speech Hillary Clinton makes the uranium one deal with Robert
[02:34.920 --> 02:45.400]  Mueller nothing no Russian collusion no complaints no media outrage no Democrat outrage radio
[02:45.400 --> 02:58.720]  silence oh but there's a picture of Jeff Sessions and Lavrov oh Trump's colluding oh Trump had
[02:58.720 --> 03:05.680]  a meeting a one-on-one meeting with Putin he's putting Russia ahead of the United States
[03:05.680 --> 03:10.640]  and this is what people are saying this is what people believe and it couldn't be farther
[03:10.640 --> 03:18.960]  from the truth so everything you're seeing is what pushback looks like everything you're
[03:18.960 --> 03:27.280]  seeing is what it looks like when you actually try to take on the corrupt government that's
[03:27.280 --> 03:42.880]  what you're seeing right now and you've got a news cycle that's so tight that yesterday's
[03:42.880 --> 03:50.920]  congressional hearings on social media censorship is like old news I mean because that's how
[03:50.920 --> 03:57.680]  fast things are moving now and Trump today has just been just savage on Twitter just
[03:57.680 --> 04:03.160]  absolutely savage on Twitter in fact maybe I should just read Trump's tweets at some
[04:03.160 --> 04:08.400]  segment today but in the next segment and in the first hour we're going to be hearing
[04:08.400 --> 04:13.040]  from Alex Jones he's going to give you the latest breaking news on what happened yesterday
[04:13.040 --> 04:17.720]  with the drudge report getting shut down and the Breitbart story highlighting how or excuse
[04:17.720 --> 04:22.760]  me the gateway pundit story highlighting how Breitbart was also shut down Alex is going
[04:22.760 --> 04:30.200]  to be breaking down why the Democrats are in such a panic but again you have to understand
[04:30.200 --> 04:37.560]  no none of the media people cared about Obama or Hillary or anyone talking to Russians quote
[04:37.560 --> 04:45.120]  unquote colluding there is no collusion until Trump did it Trump has mostly said what every
[04:45.120 --> 04:53.160]  other politician has said at some point except he's actually doing this is what the American
[04:53.160 --> 04:56.920]  Revolution looks like this is what taking down the deep state looks like Alex Jones
[04:56.920 --> 05:04.920]  on the other side living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama
[05:04.920 --> 05:10.000]  can be found here in Lelani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater
[05:10.000 --> 05:16.000]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.960]  particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[05:21.960 --> 05:28.560]  we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that
[05:28.560 --> 05:34.000]  there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.120]  tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels
[05:39.120 --> 05:46.280]  within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter
[05:46.280 --> 05:51.920]  on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[05:51.920 --> 05:58.000]  and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration
[05:58.000 --> 06:18.960]  system will purify it from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones and
[06:18.960 --> 06:27.960]  I come to you with the most dire of news our republic is hanging by a thread multinational
[06:27.960 --> 06:35.240]  globalist forces allied with and funded by communist authoritarian China have hacked all
[06:35.240 --> 06:41.000]  of our government computers all our government secrets all the government asset codes their
[06:41.000 --> 06:47.840]  assets we have been set up for a fall in the 11th hour patriots in our country and in our
[06:47.840 --> 06:55.960]  intelligence agencies and in our corporations rallied to get President Trump elected right
[06:55.960 --> 07:02.200]  when the deep state was planning to finish America off in 2017 and 18 it's an all the
[07:02.200 --> 07:08.920]  WikiLeaks they have now been for over a year and a half trying to foment insurrection and
[07:08.920 --> 07:14.280]  civil war in this country and have been trying to push the narrative that President Trump
[07:14.280 --> 07:21.240]  is somehow a Russian agent they have intensified their calls for him to be killed or for him
[07:21.240 --> 07:26.160]  to be removed under the 25th amendment or under a military coup on MSNBC CNN and every other
[07:26.160 --> 07:32.480]  major channel traitors at Fox News have all weighed in except for Tucker Carlson and Sean
[07:32.480 --> 07:38.360]  Hannity and viciously lied about the president and stabbed him in the back I am afraid for
[07:38.360 --> 07:44.080]  my nation I'm afraid for my family I personally am not afraid of myself I am afraid for the
[07:44.080 --> 07:52.000]  society that doesn't deserve President Trump Trump has put himself in the center of unprecedented
[07:52.000 --> 08:01.360]  attacks in history unprecedented lies unprecedented deception and they are now launching the ignition
[08:01.360 --> 08:06.600]  phase you can smell it you can see it they're admitting it to remove President Trump by
[08:06.600 --> 08:14.240]  this fall now Clapper and Brennan said at the Aspen Institute with Will Blitzer last
[08:14.240 --> 08:21.360]  year that they were removing by the Christmas break they tried that coup it failed they
[08:21.360 --> 08:27.160]  are now back on television not just at policy forums but on mainline TV saying overthrow
[08:27.160 --> 08:35.280]  him US military they have all of their Democrat operatives Alexandria Cortez and others will
[08:35.280 --> 08:40.200]  play this in a moment saying occupy federal buildings occupy ice occupy the border blow
[08:40.200 --> 08:47.360]  off the doors of the castle which was an old communist Chinese weathermen plot that was
[08:47.360 --> 08:52.900]  discovered in the 70s people went to prison for it she is executing the weathermen plot
[08:52.900 --> 08:57.760]  Soros and the UN are down in Nicaragua El Salvador Guatemala massing hundreds of thousands
[08:57.760 --> 09:02.680]  to flood which will then open up for millions this is the takedown plan just like you've
[09:02.680 --> 09:06.480]  seen in Europe with 10 million military aged men the last five years and the implosion
[09:06.480 --> 09:12.000]  there and the UN setting up bases now to quote deal with the crisis they created inside Spain
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.480]  and other areas where the EU has ordered them to let in millions more and millions more
[09:16.480 --> 09:23.920]  are on the way Eastern Europe is valiantly fighting back as hordes descend upon them
[09:23.920 --> 09:27.720]  the globalists have collapsed the third world and are now using it as a massive battering
[09:27.720 --> 09:35.000]  ram to takedown the west now on record communist China received the office of personal management
[09:35.000 --> 09:42.960]  files on 21.4 million US government employees their families their assets CIA NSA and 14
[09:42.960 --> 09:48.680]  other intelligence agencies we have been sold out the Panama Canal all deep water ports
[09:48.680 --> 09:53.240]  all rare earth rare earth minerals have been given to China it is off limits for US companies
[09:53.240 --> 10:00.960]  they will be indicted under bush and then Obama if they even try to engage in it only
[10:00.960 --> 10:05.040]  multinational corporations are allowed to be tax exempt apple has officially moved to
[10:05.040 --> 10:10.360]  China and given the code keys to everyone's iPhones and iCloud and bank accounts to the
[10:10.360 --> 10:16.080]  Chinese government officially emojis of Taiwan are not allowed to be sent they're having
[10:16.080 --> 10:22.500]  it by US citizens until they got lifted a few days ago it was a little too obvious congress
[10:22.500 --> 10:27.040]  just had hearings in the judiciary committee lying about info wars diamond and silk and
[10:27.040 --> 10:31.520]  others calling for a complete ban of conservatives online it's already happened they've already
[10:31.520 --> 10:40.040]  governed it back regulated it back over 90% they are making their move ladies and gentlemen
[10:40.040 --> 10:49.160]  right now and we've never been in a more critical position historically trump has proven himself
[10:49.160 --> 10:54.560]  by going in and removing some of the barriers the globalists had put to shut down our economy
[10:54.560 --> 10:58.920]  to bankrupt americans and force us on the welfare and food stamps the admitted clowered in heaven
[10:58.920 --> 11:04.440]  plan in wiki leagues to make us poor independent read hillary's own statements but they've
[11:04.440 --> 11:11.080]  changed the subject on to who hacked the emails nice magicians misdirection isn't it they've
[11:11.080 --> 11:14.680]  changed the subject about why she had an illegal dropbox server why she received three billion
[11:14.680 --> 11:19.640]  dollars mainly from foreign governments to put super secrets on that server daily just
[11:19.640 --> 11:23.880]  like you do putting it under a park bench or behind the bushes in the old days if you
[11:23.880 --> 11:31.520]  were a spy she's not a spy she's a mercenary she's a demolition expert bringing down this
[11:31.520 --> 11:39.160]  country and on our deathbed as america was being prepared for race war and societal disintegration
[11:39.160 --> 11:43.840]  and women being turned against the men and complete collapse donald trump was recruited
[11:43.840 --> 11:49.800]  by patriots two years before he even announced his run when the military did a soft coup
[11:49.800 --> 11:57.800]  on obama and said we're not going to back al qaeda in syria he was recruited and we
[11:57.800 --> 12:04.240]  are here trying to save the country we are americans we are patriots we are not the wicked
[12:04.240 --> 12:09.880]  cnn that supports china's sale of human organs of christians and buddhists we do not support
[12:09.880 --> 12:14.080]  all of this sickening behavior and anti-american behavior by the big universities in hollywood
[12:14.080 --> 12:23.880]  we are fighting with everything we've got and it makes me so sad to see so many americans
[12:23.880 --> 12:27.040]  hit the talking point that was sent out that trump was a traitor for even meeting with
[12:27.040 --> 12:31.440]  putin in private which us presidents have done for decades held back to world war two
[12:31.440 --> 12:36.080]  with russian leaders that's the president's prerogative and congress wants to subpoena
[12:36.080 --> 12:39.840]  the interpreter and they're acting like it's all criminal and saying he's the traitor when
[12:39.840 --> 12:44.680]  they're the globalist they're the people that openly hate the country they're the people
[12:44.680 --> 12:48.780]  that hate the bitter clingers and hate flyover country of democrat courts ban the american
[12:48.780 --> 12:55.080]  flag and say it's a gang symbol in public schools night circuit they're the ones trying
[12:55.080 --> 13:01.280]  to bring in brainwashed collapsed third world populations that are communists out of venezuela
[13:01.280 --> 13:04.480]  venezuela has had four million people the last six months according to their own numbers
[13:04.480 --> 13:09.880]  leave and they're going el norte and they're so dumb down they want to come where they
[13:09.880 --> 13:20.680]  think the communism is better it's happening so let's play this clip of alexandria cortez
[13:20.680 --> 13:26.160]  saying occupy government buildings borders u.s. airports occupy at all that's a communist
[13:26.160 --> 13:32.480]  term occupy shut down the infrastructure for the civil unrest i told you that's coming
[13:32.480 --> 13:36.360]  they are planning to launch a civil war in july 4th and their own admissions was the
[13:36.360 --> 13:40.920]  demarcation line here she is i believe the moral character of the united states is at
[13:40.920 --> 13:50.120]  stake so for me it wasn't a question of whether i should go down there if we have to have
[13:50.120 --> 13:55.360]  a rapid response and i think every day that we go on especially a day when something that
[13:55.360 --> 14:01.240]  heinous happens we have to occupy all of it we need to occupy every airport we need to
[14:01.240 --> 14:06.560]  occupy every border we need to occupy every ice office until those kids are back with
[14:06.560 --> 14:12.520]  their parents period the kids you told to come here the kids many of their parents were killed
[14:12.520 --> 14:16.280]  coming through mexico you don't care hundreds of thousands dead over there never discussed
[14:16.280 --> 14:21.800]  that you dictate america's moral authority as a rich girl posing as a poor girl selling
[14:21.800 --> 14:27.960]  communism and socialism what a monster so that's where we are as a culture that's where
[14:27.960 --> 14:32.920]  we are as a society and i'm going to lay out here their battle plan and what they're going
[14:32.920 --> 14:37.640]  to do and i want to break something down here i'm not trying to win a popularity contest
[14:37.640 --> 14:40.800]  i'm not trying to have google and facebook and twitter let me share all my posts if i
[14:40.800 --> 14:47.160]  wanted to do that i'd be a propagandist for the enemy the fact that they are initiating

[14:51.560 --> 14:58.960]  pro trump group total draconian censorship and suddenly fox news isn't carrying many

[20:29.160 --> 20:32.840]  by the chai coms they're they're in chinese papers bragging they're they're at davos
[20:32.840 --> 20:38.360]  saying we'll defeat trump we'll defeat america the e you the unelected yonker the nazi air
[20:38.360 --> 20:44.280]  with the chai coms all against america which side are you on now when we continue i'm gonna
[20:44.280 --> 20:51.520]  break down what the president needs to do to counter this in my humble opinion now what
[20:51.520 --> 20:58.040]  does the president need to do i understand subtlety it's my job not to be subtle i'm
[20:58.040 --> 21:04.560]  a shock troop you're shock troops you get bullied you get attacked you get discriminated
[21:04.560 --> 21:08.480]  against because you love freedom you tell the truth you know communism's a horrible evil
[21:08.480 --> 21:12.720]  system you support america you support the better ideas of america you support martin
[21:12.720 --> 21:16.680]  luther king's idea of unity and then true ideas and what you stand for not the color
[21:16.680 --> 21:23.760]  you are everything the weaponized corporate left is is the is the is the 180 degree polar
[21:23.760 --> 21:31.800]  opposite of that and they're trying to circumnavigate the success of liberty and freedom and hope
[21:31.800 --> 21:37.640]  we don't have a memory of history or the things they've done but i know the president understands
[21:37.640 --> 21:46.160]  that if he comes out and says we've been penetrated by china um our major 50 public universities
[21:46.160 --> 21:49.400]  or run by chinese intelligence i couldn't even believe the washington post a bit of that
[21:49.400 --> 21:53.640]  two months ago i've been talking about that for years uh the office of personal management
[21:53.640 --> 21:57.680]  all our files were handed over by obama five years ago we are wide open we're gonna that
[21:57.680 --> 22:02.960]  would take the stock market china owns our debt the cfr position does for the chinese
[22:02.960 --> 22:09.960]  century we were set up between the eu the big banks and china to be looted to be controlled
[22:09.960 --> 22:14.600]  to be brought to heal to be dominated and that only be a military set piece that they
[22:14.600 --> 22:21.040]  fully controlled to keep china in line but the double cross was so huge in the global
[22:21.040 --> 22:25.080]  government program that they actually put china in the catbird seat and all the top
[22:25.080 --> 22:30.520]  globalist moved to china and bought houses there and have become dual citizens and that's
[22:30.520 --> 22:34.120]  why apple and all of them have officially moved there do you understand the level of
[22:34.120 --> 22:38.920]  treason i am breaking down to you and your family right now this is all fact when i read
[22:38.920 --> 22:43.880]  four months ago in roiders where they said well it's normal tim kook of apple said we
[22:43.880 --> 22:51.000]  moved to china and the government runs you there now we're tax exempt us had 40 tax china
[22:51.000 --> 22:56.480]  had 15 we went to 15 they went to zero they said you gotta be state run and what had already
[22:56.480 --> 23:04.560]  been done behind the scenes went public you understand the magnitude if trump gave the
[23:04.560 --> 23:08.880]  office of personal management files to russia if he if he allowed apple to move to russia
[23:08.880 --> 23:16.640]  i would call for his impeachment in fact i would call for high treason charges which
[23:16.640 --> 23:21.000]  i call for for all these globalists have done it but donald trump didn't do that he was
[23:21.000 --> 23:27.400]  steadfast he believed in free market he believed in america he believed in pragmatically turning
[23:27.400 --> 23:30.600]  on the free market and trying to free these countries and trying to make a deal with north
[23:30.600 --> 23:36.040]  korean and actually help their people with with development these cults of power they
[23:36.040 --> 23:40.440]  don't want that common china's trying to block that the left is celebrating betting on china
[23:40.440 --> 23:46.680]  saying oh china controls the north you'll never get them to come into the light you'll never
[23:46.680 --> 23:49.400]  get them to come out of the dark you'll never get them to come in on the cold you'll never
[23:49.400 --> 23:54.920]  get them to free their people and i watch hollywood and the left and the cynical evil people
[23:54.920 --> 24:03.600]  laughing at america and doing all these evil things oh yeah china's the new i m f the new
[24:03.600 --> 24:08.600]  world bank they're the new robber baron they're the new economic hitmen they go in they're
[24:08.600 --> 24:13.600]  the goldman sacks j p morgan all bragg last year they said you'll never save america china's
[24:13.600 --> 24:18.720]  we're giving them unlimited money they've built dozens of cities bigger than austin texas
[24:18.720 --> 24:26.600]  that no one even lives in there's just huge empty buildings and it's for the west they
[24:26.600 --> 24:32.040]  say when we collapse america the rich americans will come here and join the party and they've
[24:32.040 --> 24:38.320]  done it they bet on 1.5 billion slaves they've bet on china that didn't even have running
[24:38.320 --> 24:45.280]  water 60 years ago didn't even have a sewage in 90 plus percent now they have everything
[24:45.280 --> 24:53.440]  all our secrets everything and this is what they've done to our country and then i sit
[24:53.440 --> 24:58.680]  there and i watch these people piss on our desperate deathbed struggle rallying like
[24:58.680 --> 25:04.440]  i saw my grandmother rally a month before she died she lost she went down like 80 pounds
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.080]  she looked like the crypt keeper beautiful woman just believe that my mother said look
[25:08.080 --> 25:11.720]  i can't believe it she's she came back from the dead basically and then she wanted to
[25:11.720 --> 25:15.840]  talk to us wanted to talk about things and then she died about a month later she came
[25:15.840 --> 25:21.880]  some way back but then died and you know i really think the communists and the globalist
[25:21.880 --> 25:25.280]  all of them might just win actually they're going to bankrupt the country and have race
[25:25.280 --> 25:29.880]  wars the left won't even care they don't even know because they were trained like ducks
[25:29.880 --> 25:37.600]  like baby gazlings baby goose ducklings baby baby ducks they imprinted on hating america
[25:37.600 --> 25:41.000]  they were brought up that their ideology because they were intellectual elites even though
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.920]  they have nothing and are nothing was hating god hating america hating john wane hating
[25:45.920 --> 25:50.440]  at least those ideals of george washington because there's such beta followers and they
[25:50.440 --> 25:55.480]  sold them on a system you can be a trader you can be a scumbag you can be a piece of
[25:55.480 --> 26:01.160]  filth and if you just go along with the system you can then take all those alpha males and
[26:01.160 --> 26:05.840]  all those guys with the big barrel chest with the good looking wives and then the guys that
[26:05.840 --> 26:15.320]  built all this and you can rule over them and then you're run by the communists chinese
[26:15.320 --> 26:20.520]  and the big cfr rockefeller foundation that he wrote the new york times and when mal died
[26:20.520 --> 26:25.840]  the editorials online stipend that rockefeller sprays for mousetown when he died in the late
[26:25.840 --> 26:30.840]  70s and he says china is the model for the future china is what we're going to do to
[26:30.840 --> 26:35.440]  america but america will serve china and i just admire chairman mal even though chairman
[26:35.440 --> 26:40.120]  mal was hated by the chinese communists when they removed him and put his wife in prison
[26:40.120 --> 26:46.600]  and he died on house arrest because they learned he was a c i a o s s agent and was actually
[26:46.600 --> 26:53.000]  planning their long term sabotage as well and a triple cross secret nuclear attack
[26:53.000 --> 27:01.400]  with russia and it's true what trump said the chinese communists have outmaneuvered
[27:01.400 --> 27:06.560]  our elites because our elites just think in 10 year cycles not 50 or 100 and so they hated
[27:06.560 --> 27:10.320]  america because they were trained to hate america because the robber barons 120 years
[27:10.320 --> 27:14.120]  ago couldn't beat the american spirit so they said we'll finance public school we'll make
[27:14.120 --> 27:20.600]  people hate america and so they were just tailor made with this education system to
[27:20.600 --> 27:25.640]  be overtaken by foreign enemies that will slit their throats in a minute the minute
[27:25.640 --> 27:31.800]  the u.s. goes down in that whole process china is going to get all these globalists to run
[27:31.800 --> 27:37.120]  over there and then within a decade they'll take everything they've got as well just
[27:37.120 --> 27:48.440]  the cold-blooded psychotic almost robot reptilian like evil of communism melded with the worst
[27:48.440 --> 28:09.800]  attributes of the lesser angels of chinese culture has created the ultimate abomination
[28:09.800 --> 28:15.320]  god help us is all i can say god help us we are under total attack this is our country
[28:15.320 --> 28:23.120]  under total attack and 150 years ago royalty was being thrown out in europe so they financed
[28:23.120 --> 28:26.520]  the communists to calm the serfs were being freed off the land back into another communal
[28:26.520 --> 28:33.760]  system and the and the poor peasants bought it up like what cyanide and babies milked
[28:33.760 --> 28:41.680]  baby doesn't know so this is where we stand i want to go to a few more of these clips

[33:39.600 --> 33:45.720]  economy you want to show folks that but in a country where even our poor people are better
[33:45.720 --> 33:52.080]  often a lot of folks in third world countries people have the identity of hating you and
[33:52.080 --> 33:58.960]  hating america more than they want to be independent and wealthy you've got to square with them
[33:58.960 --> 34:03.440]  and just come out about the office of personnel management hack the sellout to the communist
[34:03.440 --> 34:07.720]  chinese you got to go ahead and tell the chinese because they're not backing down you got to
[34:07.720 --> 34:12.040]  go ahead and tell them what the traders like phil mud and and and brennan all the scum
[34:12.040 --> 34:15.600]  of the earth that was put in there and obama that's quarterbacking all this that you're
[34:15.600 --> 34:20.040]  not going to get away with a daylight coup and saying all of us that support freedom
[34:20.040 --> 34:26.360]  or russian agents because we want to bring america back and do all this russia is in the
[34:26.360 --> 34:30.440]  globalist crosshairs because it too is a sovereign country out of their control doesn't mean they
[34:30.440 --> 34:34.480]  don't have their own problems or have corruption but they're not anti christian they're not
[34:34.480 --> 34:40.080]  anti-western now and the globalists know that russia got away from them after 87 years of
[34:40.080 --> 34:48.080]  being brutalized and they're aware of what's unfolding so let me get into some of these
[34:48.080 --> 34:55.240]  important clips now and then i have some other key points i've not made yet let's go ahead
[34:55.240 --> 34:58.520]  and just play this little clip because at the same time he's saying oh the intelligence
[34:58.520 --> 35:02.880]  agencies are really great people the lights go out you can see they're clearly dimmed
[35:02.880 --> 35:08.960]  on purpose was it a stunt an sos by the president tucker carlsson points out that it was his
[35:08.960 --> 35:14.960]  statement was like that of a kidnapped man of a man held hostage a hostage letter a hostage
[35:14.960 --> 35:21.040]  tape the lights go out but at the same time drudge report dot com info wars dot com zero
[35:21.040 --> 35:28.960]  hedge dot com and bright bar dot com and others selectively had their dns is turned off where
[35:28.960 --> 35:37.280]  no one can go to the websites for one hour 60 minutes exactly turned off in a statement
[35:37.280 --> 35:44.000]  that we have the internet kill switch and trump needs to take back control they built back
[35:44.000 --> 35:49.360]  doors into this they gave it to china grinning all the obama people still are in the national
[35:49.360 --> 35:55.120]  security system that is totally illegal totally panopticon absolutely beyond big brother big
[35:55.120 --> 36:01.440]  brother to infinity and now that's going on so here's the president with the lights going
[36:01.440 --> 36:06.960]  off ladies and gentlemen and then we've got his hostage statement so this is where we
[36:06.960 --> 36:11.200]  are and you can have america you can have prosperity you can have free market worldwide
[36:11.200 --> 36:17.120]  1776 worldwide to free freedom for everybody to chinese the indians the mexicans the germans
[36:17.120 --> 36:22.400]  the russians humanity or we can have big corporate anti-human depopulation that you see everywhere
[36:22.960 --> 36:26.560]  it's the choice is up to you so here's trump with the lights going off then we'll play back
[36:26.560 --> 36:32.720]  to back the clip of him uh when he basically uh you know says oh i meant you know oh these
[36:32.720 --> 36:37.200]  agencies the same one run by obama run by brennan run by clapper that have all been caught lying
[36:37.200 --> 36:43.200]  that lied about spying on him that were in bed with russia uranium is anything evil they do it
[36:43.200 --> 36:48.240]  and then they turn it around it's sick it's a fraud it's a hoax and again the internet censorship
[36:48.240 --> 36:53.440]  kicking in right now because they're making their move the globalists are gearing up right now
[36:53.440 --> 36:57.840]  this is it and then if we back them off this time we'll try again next year but they're really
[36:57.840 --> 37:00.880]  they're committed i can feel it i can see it they're making their move
[37:03.120 --> 37:09.840]  let's go ahead and go to these clips by saying that uh once again the full faith and support
[37:09.840 --> 37:16.720]  for america's intelligence agencies i have a full faith in our intelligence agencies
[37:17.360 --> 37:20.320]  whoops they just turned off the light that must be the intelligence agents
[37:22.240 --> 37:27.200]  there it goes okay you guys okay it was strange
[37:30.320 --> 37:34.400]  it was big news back during the campaign that google was rigging stuff for hillary and the cnn
[37:34.400 --> 37:38.960]  was rigging debates but now the media is like oh we're just banning all the conservatives it's
[37:38.960 --> 37:43.280]  okay they're bad people diamond and silk alex jones and the republican congressman sat there and
[37:43.280 --> 37:48.640]  hearings go okay well i guess it's your own company just ban everybody and then lie about him
[37:49.280 --> 37:52.960]  and then attack him and then call for the overthrow of the president we're in an information war
[37:52.960 --> 37:58.720]  here's the president stucker carlson said being held hostage yesterday basically reversing himself
[37:58.720 --> 38:03.280]  when he didn't buy into russia you know meddling is the reason he won give me a break hillary wasn't
[38:03.280 --> 38:07.760]  bad with russia but now oh my god he's this big trader siding with russia even though he's bringing
[38:07.760 --> 38:13.920]  the country back if he doesn't say it so they demonizing i have felt very strongly that while
[38:13.920 --> 38:21.120]  russia's actions had no impact at all on the outcome of the election let me be totally clear
[38:21.120 --> 38:28.720]  in saying that and i've said this many times i accept our intelligent community's conclusion
[38:28.720 --> 38:39.120]  that russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place could be other people also so a lot of
[38:39.120 --> 38:49.920]  people out there there was no collusion at all now look at what they do they make a guy that
[38:49.920 --> 38:55.040]  came from nowhere in politics wins the economy turns around a year and a half later all these
[38:55.040 --> 38:59.840]  good things are happening and they say oh it's the russians and it's the perfect way to persecute
[38:59.840 --> 39:05.040]  the american people and talk show host they call tucker carlson a russian agent to his face uh on
[39:05.040 --> 39:11.200]  fox news they've called ran paul a russian agent ran paul got threatened uh just this week by uh
[39:12.240 --> 39:17.840]  cnn saying oh what are you with putin now by will blitzer this is the insanity russia can't even get
[39:17.840 --> 39:25.200]  its traffic lights working in half its country china is who sold us down the river china is who
[39:25.200 --> 39:30.320]  the globalist have been allied with china is the issue and everybody knows that in any policy paper
[39:31.120 --> 39:34.560]  so some of the other key points here i'm gonna come back with the whole tucker carlson
[39:35.600 --> 39:39.440]  situation because there's only a few patriots out there left and i'm so ashamed of the other
[39:39.440 --> 39:42.560]  fox news people and the rest of them but thank god there's still some patriots they need to be
[39:42.560 --> 39:48.240]  praised thank you the listeners out there for your uh being awake as well there is a coup against
[39:48.240 --> 39:52.560]  trump taking place now in full swing this is the ignition phase he needs to get involved with the
[39:52.560 --> 39:58.080]  internet kill switch they're clearly testing to shut down dns's uh patriot websites entirely
[39:58.080 --> 40:02.880]  and the first step to shut us down on the social networks first and again this is a beta test for
[40:02.880 --> 40:07.600]  everybody but they're making their move trump must tell the american people about how the
[40:07.600 --> 40:11.200]  democratic party and the globalist are allied with china and just go ahead and bring it out
[40:11.200 --> 40:15.440]  you know that that that we're penetrated by the chicoms i know the intelligence agencies
[40:15.440 --> 40:19.200]  tell you don't do it and they're the ones that help get you elected the patriot groups but
[40:20.080 --> 40:24.960]  this is emergency surgery you you you've gotta they're saying you're a foreign asset president from
[40:26.320 --> 40:29.600]  you've got to bring out that they're the foreign assets i mean anybody that's got two brain cells
[40:29.600 --> 40:34.240]  rub together we know you're a patriot we know you're americana good lord but everybody knows that
[40:34.240 --> 40:39.840]  about me but you've still got to tell the public and hit them with the fact that they are what they
[40:39.840 --> 40:45.280]  say you are they're projecting they're flipping it so you must tell the american people i know
[40:45.280 --> 40:48.720]  they're planning to crash markets and try to hold you hostage and so that's why you've been
[40:48.720 --> 40:53.200]  trying to just nicely share power and say come on let's not destroy america that's not fair
[40:53.200 --> 40:58.320]  in public and in private meetings he's like why do we have a 280 tariff on our milk to canada
[40:58.320 --> 41:02.320]  and then everybody says screw america why does china have huge tariffs no why are you out to get
[41:02.320 --> 41:06.560]  america let's just have prosperity let's have global victory let's have free market because
[41:06.560 --> 41:12.320]  they don't want free market the big billionaire trillion controlling companies want total power
[41:12.320 --> 41:17.680]  and control ladies and gentlemen as tucker carlson said the president is more and more
[41:17.680 --> 41:22.240]  being held hostage he believed in us he believed we would rally he believed we would want freedom
[41:22.240 --> 41:26.400]  he believed we would see through the lies and a lot of us have but big tech has brought in total
[41:26.400 --> 41:32.400]  censorship to to to dial back his reach to dial back our resistance a lot of conservatives are

[47:25.040 --> 47:29.520]  combat and is trying to bring this country down instead i want to recognize the individuals
[47:29.520 --> 47:37.120]  last two days who publicly stood up for president trump and told the truth senator rand paul former

[47:56.560 --> 48:02.960]  the other host rolled over like a big old fat dead fish in the sun floating around in the water
[48:04.480 --> 48:10.480]  and it makes me sad for them trump is an american trump is taking america back from the globalists
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.920]  that are allied with the chicoms trump is a patriot and i just want to say i'm not a
[48:15.920 --> 48:26.080]  sunshine patriot i'm a winter soldier and i 1000 support the president i 10000 no a man
[48:26.080 --> 48:30.480]  by his enemies and i've seen him get limited control of our government and things turn around
[48:31.040 --> 48:34.400]  and he knew it would turn around because they were artificially suppressing this country
[48:34.400 --> 48:42.800]  epic history is happening right now the globalists have internet kill switch obama put in
[48:43.360 --> 48:48.800]  grinning all of them still have control of it the deep state is filled with a bunch of people
[48:48.800 --> 48:53.200]  like reality winner who wanted to join ices and hated all white people when she was white
[48:54.240 --> 48:58.960]  we are overrun by the filth the universities have produced for two generations to finally
[48:58.960 --> 49:04.720]  bring america down and they launched their attack with hillary and the last minute failed they
[49:04.720 --> 49:12.240]  failed in that battle they are now launching counter strikes ladies and gentlemen you can
[49:12.240 --> 49:17.440]  say what you want about me or trump or tucker curls finish on handy but we believe in free market
[49:17.440 --> 49:24.960]  we believe in america we believe in this republic why not it's a thousand times better than
[49:24.960 --> 49:29.760]  communist china or the eu or venezuela and and this is where we're from and they teach us that
[49:29.760 --> 49:35.440]  it's stupid it's quaint to love america or love free market in these universities that have become
[49:35.440 --> 49:39.360]  engines of anti-free speech and evil and now they're all over the news saying overthrow the
[49:39.360 --> 49:45.200]  president tucker curls is right trump was like a captured man when he made those statements knowing
[49:45.200 --> 49:49.200]  it's brennan and all those people with all their fake intelligence caught spying on him illegally
[49:49.200 --> 49:54.480]  the people that ran america and the ground by design our military and forces world government
[49:54.480 --> 50:00.640]  china economically takes over so let's go to tucker carlson and the courage of telling the truth
[50:07.280 --> 50:11.200]  good evening welcome to tucker carlson tonight we just landed from helsinki back in the nation's
[50:11.200 --> 50:16.480]  capital where it is hot and intense we're gonna have our full extended interview with the president
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.880]  from helsinki and we're gonna show that to you in just a minute we asked him of course about russia
[50:20.880 --> 50:25.360]  but there are believe it or not many more important and pressing issues on the world
[50:25.360 --> 50:28.880]  stage not just russia and we asked the president about those as well we'll bring the whole thing
[50:28.880 --> 50:34.960]  to you coming up in just a second but first tonight with remarkable speed and intensity the media the
[50:34.960 --> 50:40.960]  foreign policy establishment both political parties have come together as one to attack the president
[50:40.960 --> 50:46.480]  for his meeting yesterday with the russian president vladimir putin Anderson cooper john mccain mit romney
[50:46.480 --> 50:52.240]  they all described the president's remarks about russia as disgraceful former ci director john
[50:52.240 --> 50:56.800]  brennan called those remarks treasonous and grounds for impeachment nancy polosi and chuck
[50:56.800 --> 51:01.600]  schumer announced that trump was being blackmailed by a foreign power others accused him of being a
[51:01.600 --> 51:08.080]  sleeper agent a spy one member of congress from tennessee called for a military coup against the
[51:08.080 --> 51:13.360]  presidency well as the rage storm swirled the president bowed to the inevitable
[51:13.360 --> 51:18.720]  genuflecting before u.s. intelligence agencies whose judgment must never be questioned and recited
[51:18.720 --> 51:23.760]  the now obligatory oath of loyalty to the spy bureaucrats now in charge of our country watch
[51:24.400 --> 51:31.680]  in a key sentence in my remarks i said the word would instead of wouldn't the sentence should
[51:31.680 --> 51:40.160]  have been i don't see any reason why i wouldn't or why it wouldn't be russia so just to repeat it
[51:40.160 --> 51:46.480]  i said the word would instead of wouldn't and the sentence should have been and i thought it would
[51:46.480 --> 51:53.600]  be maybe a little bit unclear on the transcript or unclear on the actual video the sentence should
[51:53.600 --> 52:02.480]  have been i don't see any reason why it wouldn't be russia sort of a double negative so you can
[52:02.480 --> 52:08.800]  put that in and i think that probably clarifies things pretty good by itself so that's the hostage
[52:08.800 --> 52:12.560]  tape the president buckled to criticism i don't know what they're saying that's exactly what
[52:12.560 --> 52:17.840]  happened he buckled and that happens this is politics after all what is amazing and unusual
[52:17.840 --> 52:23.680]  and ominous is who made him buckle the people yelling the loudest about how the russians are
[52:23.680 --> 52:27.920]  our greatest enemy and trump is their puppet happens to be the very same people who have been
[52:27.920 --> 52:32.880]  mismanaging our foreign policy for the past two decades the people who invaded iraq and wouldn't
[52:32.880 --> 52:38.000]  admit it was a mistake people who killed momar qaddafi for no obvious reason and prolonged the
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.480]  horrible syrian civil war and then threw open the borders of europe the ones still defending
[52:42.480 --> 52:47.280]  the pointless afghan conflict and even now planning brand new disasters around the world
[52:47.280 --> 52:53.200]  in lebanon or ron and yes in russia these are the people who've made america weaker and poorer
[52:53.200 --> 52:59.040]  and sadder the group whose failures got trump elected in the first place you would think by this
[52:59.040 --> 53:03.920]  late date they would be discredited completely and unemployable wearing uniforms and picking up trash
[53:03.920 --> 53:08.320]  by the side of a turnpike somewhere but no they think we don't have memory they're hosting cable
[53:08.320 --> 53:12.080]  news shows they're holding high they were for the shy comms of course they're trying to wreck us
[53:12.080 --> 53:16.880]  they run virtually every non-profit public policy institution in washington they are still in some
[53:16.880 --> 53:22.880]  sense in charge of our national conversation and naturally they hate the idea of rethinking or
[53:22.880 --> 53:27.360]  correcting any of the countless blunders they hate is the idea of a president is actually president
[53:27.360 --> 53:32.000]  that's why they're pissed calls them on those blunders now being trump he can't always explain
[53:32.000 --> 53:36.960]  precisely what he means to say sometimes he gets the details wrong or he gets sidetracked with some
[53:36.960 --> 53:42.640]  personal vendetta as if anybody cares about that which is real a cost a guy nobody does but on the
[53:42.640 --> 53:49.760]  big questions trump is indisputably right the cold war is over the world has changed it is time to
[53:49.760 --> 53:56.000]  rethink america's alliances god thank god there's still people in our total traders russia is not a
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.880]  close friend of the united states but the question is why should we consider russia a mortal enemy
[54:00.880 --> 54:06.080]  of course russia spies on us so do a lot of countries kind of far more effectively than russia
[54:06.640 --> 54:12.080]  the russian attempt to meddle in our election was comically amateurish badly targeted facebook ads
[54:12.080 --> 54:17.760]  almost nobody saw compared that effort to the deep penetration of american industry and the
[54:17.760 --> 54:22.640]  defense sector by the communist government of china or compared to the remarkable sway that the
[54:22.640 --> 54:27.600]  sunni gulf states have over a political process or the fact that latin american countries are
[54:27.600 --> 54:32.080]  changing election outcomes here by forcing demographic change on this country to rate
[54:32.080 --> 54:38.000]  that american voters consistently say they don't want those are all major challenges from foreign
[54:38.000 --> 54:43.520]  powers to our american democracy they're real and say it tucker the democrats and republican are on
[54:43.520 --> 54:49.440]  the god damn payroll why is that well here's one reason those may come man you're the traders
[54:49.440 --> 54:54.000]  we're gonna get your ass burning and you too mud and their homes and watch their kids those
[54:54.000 --> 54:59.200]  countries can't be our enemies in their view but nobody here is getting rich from russia
[54:59.200 --> 55:04.560]  so therefore putin must be a mortal foe that's who the neocons are telling us we are required
[55:04.560 --> 55:08.480]  they don't run russia is why they don't actually believe it just like a hate crime person who's
[55:08.480 --> 55:12.240]  read a newspaper this year could recite that talking point without laughing because it's stupid
[55:12.800 --> 55:16.960]  so the only option if you want to force the population and tell your girls that's ridiculous
[55:16.960 --> 55:20.720]  is to make sure they don't think too much about it this is the next level quiet tucker girl
[55:20.720 --> 55:24.480]  soon as the next level and if you don't believe it watch what's happening everything we've been
[55:24.480 --> 55:29.040]  looking for right there obviously it's possible entirely possible maybe likely that the russian
[55:29.040 --> 55:33.200]  government broke into the dnc servers before the last election it certainly sounds like something
[55:33.200 --> 55:39.120]  they might do but before we act like we know for a fact that that's what happened and go to war
[55:39.120 --> 55:44.320]  with russia over that shouldn't we see some actual evidence that had happened why not like maybe a
[55:44.320 --> 55:48.640]  server or at least a clear like congress having hearings to ban me and they're not letting me be
[55:48.640 --> 55:54.400]  there that's my cousin how dare he that's a treasonous thought we were told he's a quisling
[55:54.400 --> 55:58.320]  a traitor to his country that's what they're saying and not just a few of them all of them
[55:58.320 --> 56:01.840]  are saying that but they're globalists they're the ones that sold the country out a second about
[56:01.840 --> 56:07.680]  what they're demanding if you don't automatically accept the imprecise non-spirited russian agent
[56:07.680 --> 56:13.360]  never fully explained findings of shadowy intelligence agencies with long documented track
[56:13.360 --> 56:19.040]  records of making serious mistakes you've somehow betrayed your country the very people who assured
[56:19.040 --> 56:24.000]  you that iraq had weapons of mass destruction the ones who said the shah would never fall in iran
[56:24.000 --> 56:30.720]  etc etc those people must be believed without question or else on television this group is
[56:30.720 --> 56:36.080]  called the intelligence community that's an orwellian name if there ever was one where exactly is
[56:36.080 --> 56:41.120]  this community we hear so much about does it have a zip code a public library system a youth football
[56:41.120 --> 56:47.440]  league how long before congress starts demanding unthinking obedience to the lawmaker community
[56:47.440 --> 56:52.560]  the community after all you must obey it dissent is unpatriotic and if you don't agree you're
[56:52.560 --> 56:58.560]  working for vladimir putin that's where we're heading by the way and fast in some ways this
[56:58.560 --> 57:03.280]  whole story is about donald trump and what he said and what he does but on a deeper level it has
[57:03.280 --> 57:09.120]  nothing to do with donald trump this is about democracy whether or not voters rule their
[57:09.120 --> 57:14.400]  country it turns out the very people telling you they are saving our democracy are working
[57:14.400 --> 57:22.400]  over time to destroy it and scolding you as they do 100 pure veritas it's it's a whole in one it's
[57:22.400 --> 57:27.360]  i've never done anything like that tucker crawleston's the king now period he's the guy and he wrote
[57:27.360 --> 57:33.200]  that and understand this just like they tell you over and over again you know worship edward
[57:33.200 --> 57:37.760]  armuro that's what edward armuro wished he was we're the americans we're taking the country back

[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.000]  welcome back to the alex joneshow olyn shroyer filling in
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:34.400]  i want to show this graphic here because it really explains everything
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:44.160]  when it comes to how the media treats donald trump and you can go off and try to understand
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:49.840]  why the media treats donald trump like that obviously we know why but if you look at the
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:57.520]  time magazine covers that featured barack obama versus the time magazine covers that feature
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:05.280]  donald trump you understand everything and so you have the four time magazine covers praising
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:11.360]  obama he's the best he's the hero he can do no wrong and then you have the four time magazine
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:16.080]  covers trump is the worst he's melting down he's separating kids he's a failure
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:27.440]  of course what is the truth what is the truth the truth is that in two years
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:32.000]  president donald trump has gotten more done than any president maybe ever
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:40.240]  i mean i'm not sure if it's even fair to compare certain presidents given the
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:46.400]  the landscape and the time in which they were president but compared to obama
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:58.160]  trump is an elephant and obama is a fly on the elephant's ass that is being switched away with
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:06.560]  the tail obama is a horse fly on the ass of of of trump the elephant and trump is is slapping
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:13.120]  him away with his tail right now so why though does time magazine hate donald trump so much even
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:19.040]  though he's done incredible things for america and why did they love obama so much who did what
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.480]  seriously go ask obama supporters what are obama's accomplishments he they can't tell you
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.720]  he's done nothing oh he won the nobel peace prize well what'd he get that for can't tell you that
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:40.800]  and it just is the perfect illustration of the total bias against donald trump in the media
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:49.280]  but the incredible thing is it hasn't stopped him and it hasn't hurt his approval ratings
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:56.240]  you know mike adams is about to come in studio we're gonna we're gonna get some real news but
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:02.480]  you know what i just want to say something real quick you know we were out with the proud boys
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:07.680]  last night and i always love meeting new people and and and hearing other opinions and stuff and
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:15.520]  and just you know just being a regular person with other people and i'm sure that there's a lot
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:21.920]  of young people that are listening to this right now whether it be at your university or your school
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:27.200]  or in your friend group or whatever but you feel that you're slighted you feel that
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:35.280]  you're underestimated and you probably feel like maybe you don't belong or you don't deserve or
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:41.600]  whatever the case may be i'm kind of going off on a jag here but i know that there's audience members
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:46.400]  out there that feel that way and so they tune in to to info wars to to feel the empowerment
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:53.840]  and to empower themselves with knowledge and truth but to the young people out there
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:03.120]  that have to deal with people insulting them calling them names you know family not wanting
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:09.520]  to talk about them anymore it may not feel good at the time it may feel like it's hurting you
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:17.760]  but it's actually a blessing in disguise because the more people underestimate you the more people
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:25.280]  have low expectations for you the more success you can have and so it's all the young audience
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:31.040]  out there right now that that that feels like they don't belong because they love trump and
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:35.680]  everyone else hates trump and or or they're underestimated or they have low expectations
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:42.880]  do not let that keep you down let that motivate you and understand that when you succeed when you
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:48.800]  have low expectations when you are underestimated and you succeed despite that that is even a
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:55.840]  greater victory for you so that's what you need to do just put your head down and win and the rest
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:03.040]  will come i want to plow into all of this but i'm going to spend a few minutes here first
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:10.000]  just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or

[01:05:53.680 --> 01:06:02.640]  coming back against us so we need your support. President trump gives every indication by what
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:07.760]  he says and what he does and what he doesn't do that he's mean as a Wolverine.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:21.760]  it's 1159 at radio free america and this is uncle sam with music and the truth until dawn
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:27.120]  right now i got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone the chair
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:33.840]  is against the wall the chair is against the wall john has a long mustache john has a long
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:39.280]  mustache it's 12 o'clock americans another day closer to victory and for all of you out there on
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:50.160]  or behind the lines this is your song but they took a lot of people away people that they thought
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.240]  we're gonna make trouble for them people that had guns and things they wanted it just took them away
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:59.840]  where re-education camps that's what they're calling so part of it is we have to break through
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.240]  our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:10.560]  and recognize the kids belong to whole communities. I have decided we really need camps for adults
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:19.040]  and we need the kind of camps that you all run i mean really all persons of japanese
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:24.080]  descent were required to register now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:29.680]  almost overnight had built assembly centers come on i'm a sorry citizen i refuse to recognize you
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.840]  guys what kind of a situation in the u.s would you see that happening i mean we've got a lot of
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:39.200]  competition with a lot of people that it's not filed with plus you have a lot of people that are
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:44.720]  coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to to build ied's and to defeat
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:51.600]  law enforcement techniques these people are radicalized and they don't support the united states
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:57.200]  and they're disloyal to the united states it's our right and our obligation to segregate them from
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:08.800]  the normal community is what we're doing here and let's not kid about it we're building a domestic
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:16.400]  army because the government is afraid of its own citizens put your gun down really rallying
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:24.720]  patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's alex jones are you some kind of a constitutionalist
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:34.720]  so these people will hold themselves out to be patriots or not they're nothing more than domestic
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:50.160]  terrorists if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:59.440]  grandad trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does what he doesn't do
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:10.560]  is that he's mean as a wolverine thank you dan rather for giving us another meme for president
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.840]  trump boy it's great they give us all these memes the deplorables fake news mean like a wolverine
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:20.160]  i love it mike adams is in studio with me here's the deal we're going to be talking about the
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:24.960]  congressional hearings we're going to be talking about the internet censorship we're going to be
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:30.240]  talking about the internet kill switch then we're going to break down why the media and the democrat
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:36.240]  party is so upset with the trump putin summit but but first i've got all of these notes here
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:41.920]  so i was watching the congressional hearings yesterday mike and i've got these five pages of
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:47.200]  notes but you had monica bickert from facebook juniper down from youtube who was actually there
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:52.480]  to represent google they requested google's presence they sent juniper down from youtube and then yes
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:10:00.240]  mr pickles mr nick pickles right from twitter uh to be a part of this congressional hearing now
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:08.960]  obviously as usual it's pretty much the same stuff mike right uh what are you doing about
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:14.320]  fake news what are we doing about russian interference you know so they kind of use that
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:20.960]  as the basis for having this hearing but then what happens they say why aren't you banning info wars
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:27.520]  you know why does alex jones get to promote his new stories on twitter so why do you think
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:35.920]  you have these congressional hearings happening is it to create an atmosphere to shut info wars
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:42.400]  and other sites like us down or are they genuinely concerned about what's happening on social media
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:49.120]  well i think we have to back up and first look at the arrogance of the assertion that just because
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:54.480]  certain left-leaning members of congress don't like the content that info wars broadcast that
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:11:01.520]  therefore they can demand that these social media giants pull the info wars channel this premise
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:07.200]  is utterly fraudulent and they lied about info wars multiple times on the record you know info
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:13.440]  wars has demanded retractions of a one senator i don't recall which one uh donnie deutch deutch
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:18.720]  there you go deutch deutch but they they lie they deliberately lie and then they say info wars is
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:24.080]  fake news while they are lying about info wars so by their own logic they should be censored
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:30.480]  because they're lying and meanwhile don't we have the freedom to express different ideas
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:36.560]  including especially unpopular ideas and by the way most of the ideas that info wars broadcast
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:43.200]  are very popular they are you know freedom is popular right from time to time truth is popular
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:51.120]  but info wars views contradict the mainstream fake news narrative narrative precisely because
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.320]  the media monopolists are fake news and so for that reason info wars gets called out
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.360]  and congress demands that info wars get banned well if that's the case then aren't they setting up
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:07.440]  a precedent oh and where they say that anytime a democrat member of congress doesn't like what a
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:13.600]  broadcaster is saying that they can demand facebook censor their entire channel is that
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:19.200]  what this has come to because that's absurd that's not america well the it's even wilder than that
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:24.000]  because first of all you had all the democrats whenever they got their five minutes every
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.800]  single one of them had to slam trump putin so so before they didn't even got to the actual content
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.200]  of what the hearing was for they had to get their two cents in about you know trump bad russia bad
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.440]  bad but what you really had here and we're going to play the clip in the next segment
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:42.880]  i think the most shocking thing mic was you had democrats claiming i can't even believe
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:47.840]  i'm telling you this but this is this we have the clips we'll show you you have democrats claiming
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:53.680]  that conservatives are essentially running the social media networks bullying it yeah i know
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:13:00.800]  right bullying bullying uh liberal and and left ideas and content out of social media that they
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:06.080]  they make that claim that conservatives are bullying uh leftists and liberals off of social
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.480]  media they make that claim and then in the very next sentence they call for info wars to be shut
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:18.880]  down it's like that is the most ironic thing you could ever think of i saw a headline on
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:23.120]  a gateway pun that last night that talked about it may be on info wars as well 93
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:29.440]  percent reduction in traffic to conservative websites since facebook began the purge of
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:35.280]  conservative information in january of 2017 as as trump was about to you know become
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:44.320]  sworn in president this is a deliberate malicious censorship tyranny that's being used by facebook
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:52.800]  by google youtube twitter and other internet giants and it is an algorithmic attempt to
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:58.240]  suppress the free speech of those selected political targets and info wars is merely the
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:03.600]  test case and this is one reason why why i'm here and why i'm speaking out about this oh and because
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:10.800]  i know that if they manage to take down alex jones and info wars guess what natural news is next
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:16.640]  i'm next and then bright part is next and drudge is next who's next it's it's a it's a domino effect
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:20.480]  on the gateway pun it is what they want and they even mentioned the gateway pun it yesterday too
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:28.240]  along with info wars bright part and others and some of the crazy stuff here i mean they want to say
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:34.640]  election meddling because of social media activity so what so now you're saying if i go on social
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:39.280]  media and i say hey president trump's doing a great job with tax cuts am i now meddling in the
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:46.320]  election well what's clear now is is google and facebook are fraudulently stealing the 2018 mid-term
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:50.800]  elections right now by the fact that they are censoring conservative voices they are engaged
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:55.840]  in a massive fraud right now and it's been going on all year i mean what robert muhler charged these
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:01.040]  russians with was i think an attempt to defraud the united states of america by influencing
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:06.640]  the elections right key word attempt they they they don't even have conclusive evidence that it
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.240]  even happened their efforts were miniscule even if they spend a few hundred thousand dollars in
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.800]  advertising it's nothing it's a drop in the bucket right but what google and facebook and youtube and
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:20.480]  twitter are doing is massive they are massively defrauding the united states of america they are
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:26.800]  deliberately attempting to steal the election right now which makes me think that you know what if
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:35.200]  if democrats win in 2018 isn't that on a fraudulent basis because google and facebook have cut off
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.240]  half of the debate the conservative half who are not allowed to speak and that's how they're trying
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.440]  to destroy this country and take over politically so they can crush our economy and and put us in
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.880]  the war with russia by the way which is what they want we got to talk about that yeah we're going
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:53.520]  to talk about that we're going to have the clip of senator raskin on the other side but really the

[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:06.800]  is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:13.280]  on rain water and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:19.760]  metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:26.240]  employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:32.400]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:38.240]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:45.440]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:51.360]  the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:56.960]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:07.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:18.720]  you
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:30.720]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones and now your host owin
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:39.440]  treuer one of the crew members here matt weber fellow st lewison from the ill side gave a great
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:46.720]  quote during the break winners are focused on winning and losers are focused on winners i guess
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:53.200]  that's why everybody talks about info wars and shutting us down so i've just gotten two stories
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:58.800]  here that alex wants me to talk about obama spoke in johannesburg south africa his biggest speech
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:06.160]  um since handing over the reins of the u.s president to donald trump spoke for about an hour
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:14.400]  but he says men are getting on his nerves now and he's sick of men and he wants to
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:21.360]  empower more women i guess is he talking about michelle men getting on his nerves i guess his
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:25.440]  husband wife is getting on his nerves uh so you got that going on so obama you know it's
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:31.920]  it's a nice day obama just sewing more discord and you know sewing more uh warfare between men
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:37.520]  and women you know so that's nice thanks obama thanks for jabbing the knife into our back one
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:44.160]  more time then you have this story from the hill g.o.p lawmaker regrets appearing on alex jones radio
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:52.480]  show you know look i i i really like matt gates i think he is the future of the republicans in
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:22:00.480]  congress i think he is a real patriot and he's fighting the good fight and i don't know why
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:06.640]  he's he's making statements about regretting going on jones show or or regretting info wars
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:13.920]  appearances or whatever but i mean do you think here here's because here's my theory you've got
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:21.840]  a an element to this where i understand i understand why matt gates would want to say things like this
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:26.080]  because he's catching so much flak and he may not actually even believe what he's saying he may
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:30.640]  really like us he may really like alex but he's just you know pigeon pigeon hold here was trying
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:36.160]  to insulate himself because info wars is under attack by all of these lying democrats who are
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:41.120]  literally factually misrepresenting what what info wars has said and so yeah i agree with you i
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:45.760]  think gates is just distancing himself you and i both probably very much appreciate gates
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.640]  views and work the things that he has done are are quite commendable in fact and there are many
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:56.480]  others like jim jordan and louis gomert and ran paul for example these are the republicans that are
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:03.120]  that are actually fighting right right but you know there's look info wars is not supposed to be
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:07.760]  the conservative establishment it's not even conservative it's it's libertarian right it's
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:13.760]  anti-establishment in the job of info wars and independent media is to prod the establishment
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:19.280]  and ask the big questions and be the dissenting view express free speech and frankly oh and i
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:25.680]  would say you know matt gates if he were going to be ashamed about going on any news program it
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:32.560]  should be cnn has he boycotted cnn and if yeah where's all the disavowing of cnn and fake news and
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:38.080]  and these left-wing media establishments you talk you want to talk about actually killing kids i mean
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:44.160]  not just comments about parkland or sandy hook cnn promotes the psychiatric drugging of children
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:50.240]  the gmo's the pesticides and funds their news exactly that the mass medication of children
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:55.520]  some of which leads to mass shootings because people coming off antidepressants and so on cnn
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:03.760]  is pushing these toxins and poisons that damage the environment that that destroy our food supply
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:09.840]  that give people cancer if anybody should be ashamed it's cnn cnn is cancer but this is what
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:18.000]  they do they it's like it's like info wars entire identity is sandy hook or or crisis actors at
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.240]  parkland and it's like that's not even a tenth of a percent of of what we cover here and you know
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:29.200]  see it's like i don't know again i i don't know why matt gates is saying this i don't know if he
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:34.960]  has even looked into these things whether it be sandy hook or the parkland shooting i mean look i'm
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:40.960]  not going to sit here and talk about sandy hook but i mean come on you know like well matt gates
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:47.440]  no question this is a strategic move on his part you almost can't blame him in a way he's trying
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:52.560]  to insulate himself from info wars during these these hearings when info wars is being unfairly
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:25:00.400]  and falsely accused of doing things that did not happen now can can alex sue for defamation
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.800]  members of congress probably not because i'm talking about the democrats who are lying defamation
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:10.160]  suits are the hardest suits to win they are you have to prove monetary you know losses the best
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:17.040]  thing that i think that info wars can do is just continue to put out quality professional journalism
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:25.600]  and independent analysis of events and be that beacon of asking big questions having
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:32.960]  a constitutionally protected dissent against the monopolized media script but but matt gate
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:36.640]  needs matt here's what matt gates needs to understand and again i'm not here to attack matt gates i'm
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:42.400]  not going to speak for alex uh as far as what matt gates is saying but but if matt if matt gates
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.840]  doesn't understand this this is what he needs to understand we're under attack they're trying to
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:51.520]  shut us down they're trying to end our right to free speech matt he gives you a platform like we
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:55.680]  give you a platform to come on here and promote truth so so but but let me just play this clip
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:00.640]  of of congressman raskin because this is this is really what it's all about and and these are the
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:05.920]  people that are trying to shut us down uh mr gate so let's go to the clip of congressman raskin this
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:15.600]  is honestly unbelievable about the continuing demonization and vilification of families and
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:22.080]  children who are victimized in episodes of mass gunswater and we know it's now an ideological
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:28.480]  fixture on uh the right wing in america to deny the existence of these atrocities like what took
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.840]  place in newtown connecticut what took place in parkland and then to allege that they're the product
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:39.360]  of uh some kind of conspiracy or hoax and of course the the founding myth in this vein is
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:44.400]  holocaust revisionism which claims that the holocaust never took place but so mr george asks
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:50.880]  the question what's being done about this have you appointed a committee to review um the problem
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:56.240]  of bias against people who are victims of gun violence and the way that they are being treated
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:02.400]  on the internet and the way that there is voice being given to people who are denying uh the
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:09.440]  historical fact of their experience certainly if anybody alleges that the parkland survivors
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:13.440]  are crisis actors that violates our policies we remove it show the take to your question about
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:17.680]  remove it and then and they're allowed to continue to keep putting it out so so in the future you're
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.480]  impossible quick so so here they are talking about censoring info wars they're already doing it so
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:28.800]  this is but it's about to be even more incredible they complain that conservatives are censoring
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:34.480]  liberals on twitter as they are literally here talking about censoring us well and also think
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.720]  about oh they're asserting essentially that there has never been a false flag ever in the history
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:43.600]  of the world that no event has ever been faked you know i mean it's infuriating they don't do the
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:48.720]  research of course the the historical record regardless of what you think about parkland or
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:54.800]  sandy hooker any of those others history documented history the united states declassified documents
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:59.600]  showed that the u.s. government was attempting false flag operations in the past many many
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:06.080]  classified exactly so this assertion that every event is automatically true and that there's no
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:10.240]  alternative narrative that you're not even to think about anything you're not even to think
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:14.400]  outside of the box you can't go against the alright we need to look here i need to plug i
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:18.800]  have barely even plugged today folks we're playing the clips they're they're calling to shut us down
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:23.200]  this is this is the united states government this is congress this is democrats calling to shut us
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:29.440]  down this is losers at cnn going and flagging our videos to try to shut us down mr potato head

[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:29.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show you know i gotta tell you i'm probably one of those men
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:35.440]  that obama's getting tired of because you know what mike adams alex jones olyn shroyer david night
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:42.000]  the guests that we have on this show we're real men and i'm i'm reaching a point where i'm getting
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:47.600]  so sick of some of the pushback against us that i'm almost wanting to say things that that that
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:52.320]  people don't want us to say i'll just put it that way when it comes to sandy hook and pizza gate but
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:56.560]  you want to keep pushing this man you're gonna you're gonna get what you want now
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:02.160]  mike is going over a bombshell story that we've just got here mark zuckerberg was on a podcast
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:05.920]  saying info was shouldn't be shut down of course it's a misnomer they're already trying to shut
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:11.600]  us down they admit that they algorithm us out of existence at least 80 percent that's their numbers
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:16.560]  so mike is gonna address this here he's getting the poll quotes from the story now uh uh our
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:21.520]  producers are working on getting the clips from this this podcast that zuckerberg went on here's
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.080]  an idea why doesn't zuckerberg actually come on the alex joneship i mean you want an idea you
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:30.400]  want to talk about the breaking the internet if mark zuckerberg came on the alex joneshow that
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:36.640]  would be like probably bigger than the uh rogan jones podcast but look i need to i need to plug
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.400]  here i've barely plugged and we have these huge specials running right now it's the defeat the
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:45.760]  democrat censorship sale and it's just like so so here we are in the middle of all of this you
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:49.280]  know they call for info wars to be shut down democrats congress call for info wars to be
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:54.160]  shut down mainstream news outlets like cnn call for info wars to be shut down uh potato head from
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:35:00.800]  toy story on cnn says for info wars to be shut down so and then they say oh look at info wars
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:05.680]  claiming to be the victim like the people want to shut them down and it's like we play all the clips
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:10.960]  we have the congressional hearings they go on for three hours and then they call us conspiracy
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:14.160]  theorists because we say they want to shut us down and we're just going to their own their own
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:20.080]  quotes so so we're not look it's not it's not something where we're just trying to patronize you
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:25.680]  here they really want to shut down folks and the difference is they cannot shut us down because
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:31.760]  we're funded by you that's the key to everything we do here we're an independent news organization
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:37.360]  funded by our audience no other news outlet with our reach with our numbers when it comes to how
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:42.320]  many crew members we have with everything we do here no one else is funded like us and you're not
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.960]  funded by the toxic prescription medications that fund cnn by the way i mean think about that
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:53.440]  the info wars products promote health longevity cognitive performance the stuff that cnn pushes
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:59.840]  it's poison and i poison for your body poison for your mind and people who people who use these
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:04.880]  products know how good they are and they become repeat customers i'm one of them so info wars

[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:40.000]  zuckerberg goes on a podcast says he doesn't want info wars to be shut down even though they are
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.280]  shutting us down uh but you said there's some incredible quotes from this we're working on
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:46.560]  getting the audio what did you find it's extraordinary this is an interview that zuckerberg
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:53.520]  did with recode uh cara swisher i'm sorry if i pronounced that correctly yeah yeah someone
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:58.000]  no no one's heard of this podcast no one's heard of this person nothing against this
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.160]  podcast a person i'm sure they're fine people or i don't know but i don't know why don't they come
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:07.680]  on here this is the big audience dude but look here's what zuckerberg says when he's asked why
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:12.960]  doesn't he take down info wars listen to this you're going to be shocked he says this is zuckerberg
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:17.760]  talking about info wars he says quote i don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:21.840]  he's talking about info wars i don't think they're intentionally getting it wrong now yeah because
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.920]  we're getting it right but his supposition his info wars is wrong but they're not doing it
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:30.880]  intentionally now listen to his logic though this this is fascinating it's hard to impugn intent
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:38.480]  and to understand the intent he says in other words zuckerberg is like he gets it so much more
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:43.440]  than any of these democrats which is called ban info wars shut them up censor him zuckerberg is
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:48.000]  is saying well we think they're wrong but how do you determine someone's intent i don't think
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.760]  info wars is trying to get it wrong he says i this is his quote i just think as important as
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:59.120]  some of those examples are i think the reality is also that i get things wrong when i speak publicly
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:03.760]  this is zuckerberg saying that that he gets things wrong when he speaks public publicly and he says
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:10.080]  i'm sure you do i'm sure a lot of leaders and public leaders who we respect do too he says
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:15.680]  i just don't think that it is the right thing to say we're going to take someone off the platform
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:21.440]  if they get things wrong even multiple times you know this is actually fascinating so here's the deal
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:27.360]  deal alex isn't buying this and i'm not going to speak for alex jones here i'm not alex jones
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:31.120]  and and and i'm sure he's going to respond to this and he's going to break this down
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:35.920]  so i'm going to i'm i don't think i'm speaking for alex here i'm just asking questions absorbing
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:41.120]  it all i'm wondering what's going on in zuckerberg's head right now because we know that they're
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:48.320]  trying to censor us they admit that they they have algorithms that chop us down 80 but i've
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:52.800]  never heard zuckerberg say anything like this and i'm wondering if zucker if this is if it now alex
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:57.120]  isn't buying this but i'm wondering if zuckerberg is being genuine here or he's just placating
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.880]  uh it's pretending like he cares about free speech but let's first first mic hold that thought
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:04.800]  because we have the audio ready let's actually go to the audio or zuckerberg on this podcast
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:12.080]  are if it's going to result in real harm real physical harm or if you're attacking individuals
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.920]  then that content shouldn't be on the platform right and there's a lot of categories of that
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:23.360]  that we can get into democrats the left and there's broad debate and okay sandy hook didn't happen is not
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:31.600]  a debate it is false you can't just take that down i agree that it is false um and i also think
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:37.920]  that going to someone who is a victim um of sandy hook and telling them hey no you're a liar here
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:42.960]  pause it real quick pause real you can't because they said whatever that you can't argue with it
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:46.720]  but think about what they just said see this is this is what they do they dumb down the conversation
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:51.200]  they say oh sandy hook didn't happen wait what did you what does that even mean nobody said sandy
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:57.280]  hook didn't happen of a place yeah oh sandy hook didn't have what sandy hook didn't have like what
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:02.480]  element are you talking mars didn't happen right galaxy didn't have like what like nobody says it
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:06.000]  didn't happen all right so it's just this is how they dumb down their conversation all right let's
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:11.440]  go back then we actually will take that down um but overall you know i mean let's let's take this
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:16.880]  a little closer to home right so i'm jewish um and there's a set of people who deny that the
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:24.080]  holocaust happened right i find that deeply offensive but at the end of the day i don't
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:29.200]  believe that our platform should take that down because i think that there are things
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:34.240]  that different people get wrong um either i don't think that they're intentionally getting
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:42.960]  wrong but i think that they um it's it's hard to impugn intent um and to understand the intent
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:50.080]  um but i just think for as important as some of those examples are i think the reality is also
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:56.400]  that um i get things wrong when i speak publicly um i'm sure you do i'm sure a lot of leaders and
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:02.560]  public figures we respect due to and i just don't think that it is the right thing to say
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:08.720]  we are going to take someone off the platform if they get things wrong um even multiple times
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:15.520]  all right here's what i'm gonna say here here's what i'm gonna say genuinely i i want to see
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:22.480]  this country come together genuinely i want to see all americans enjoy this american resurgence
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:27.760]  enjoy our freedom and prosperity that's our birthright and i don't want to fight with fellow
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.840]  americans i don't want to go out in the streets and and wave an american flag at a march and then
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:37.920]  have some thug clad in a black hoodie come up and try to you know punch me or stick me with a needle
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:43.920]  or something so so i'll just say this and again we'll get alex alex's take on this i know he's
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:49.200]  not buying it he may even disagree with me but if mark zuckerberg wants to come out as a patriot
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:55.360]  for america then i'm down you know like that's what i'm saying like i don't it's just just quit
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:42:00.640]  being such liars quit being such frauds quit trying to shut down free speech and let's just come
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:04.880]  together so if zuckerberg is being genuine about this i think he should come on alex jones' show
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:11.760]  oh if if i could interrupt if if he is genuine about this opinion this is a very commendable
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:17.760]  point of view compared to the insanity of the left which is just ban everyone that disagrees with us
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:22.160]  i mean i can't believe i'm saying this because i think he's evil but mark zuckerberg is a genius
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:27.920]  compared to this moron who's interviewing him okay let me just say that he is a genius compared
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:33.920]  to her he's actually got a reason behind his positions here is he faking it or is he serious
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:39.760]  if he's serious it actually makes sense you can't impune people based on just your beliefs
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:45.680]  when info wars reports the news info wars is always working to tell but here's the key every
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:51.920]  time here's the key if people like zuckerberg kanye west and others come out against all the hate

[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:05.440]  may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:10.400]  but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:16.640]  and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:23.280]  ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:29.120]  alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:35.120]  and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our elixir pure gravity filter
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:40.960]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored to
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:47.920]  optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of the water so what
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:53.680]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:46:00.320]  importantly a good water filtration system will purify it as the years go by it gets harder and

[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:36.720]  all right so we've got mark zuckerberg goes on some unknown podcast and says info wars should
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:43.760]  not be shut down because they don't intentionally get the news wrong now look again i i just want
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:49.520]  to see americans come together and someone like mark zuckerberg does have power okay and if he is
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:56.480]  willing to be cordial in in disagreements and if he is willing to say hey look info wars is not the
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.400]  the boogie man that people think they are they should have free speech too and you have more
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:05.600]  people like zuckerberg doing that this is how we can stop the the tensions in the united states
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:09.840]  whether i like zuckerberg or not as irrelevant i want zuckerberg to stop fueling the street
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:15.040]  minions out there they're causing violence but but here's the key he says info wars does not
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:20.160]  intentionally report fake news now let's not forget what facebook is done we're not trying to
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:25.600]  facebook is banned conservatives they've shut conservatives down they chop us down to 80 percent
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:29.680]  censorship so so we're not discounting what facebook is done in fact most the audience is
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.960]  private censored on facebook you've been shut down on facebook we've been shut down on facebook so
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:37.760]  i'm not forgetting that i'm just trying to get the positive pulp from this i'm trying to squeeze
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:42.480]  this and get some positivity out of it we'll see what zuckerberg says next or if he really means
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:47.040]  this i would say that mark zuckerberg needs to come on the alex joneshow at least oh and zuckerberg
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:52.160]  is not going along with the lynch mob mentality of the democrats and that's what is he exactly
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:58.080]  that's commend me yeah i mean i can't believe i'm actually i'm impressed by mark zuckerberg's
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:02.560]  defense here now granted he has been censoring through the down ranking algorithms the shadow
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:06.880]  banning all of these other things they're very malicious and facebook has been engaged in that
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:11.520]  but he's not going along with this lynch mob that just says shut these people down because
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:16.080]  they report a different view than we report i mean you know no matter what you think about
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:22.080]  sandy hook or parkland or even as zuckerberg cites the holocaust no matter what you think zuckerberg
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:27.760]  is saying that if you don't intentionally fake the news that you should at least have a platform
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:32.800]  to express something even if they downrank you 99 percent you still have like the the one percent
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:37.440]  but i mean look the bottom line for all of us is we got to move to other platforms anyway right
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:42.800]  we got to get off of facebook oh but see now you've hit the key see that might be the zeitgeist
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:46.240]  see you know these guys are capitalist at the end of the day mike right they don't they don't
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:50.880]  want to lose all the people that would flee if they outright ban which which is already happening
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:57.200]  now now let's go to an organization that actually does intentionally fake news now you have hillary
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:02.000]  clinton who lies about being under sniper fire brian williams who lies about some experience i
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.920]  think he said he was in an apache helicopter getting shot at or something totally made up of
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:13.200]  course he gets hired by msnbc go figure so you want to see a news organization that intentionally
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:19.200]  fakes news let's go back to this classic from charles jaco on cnn pretending to get bombed uh
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:28.560]  during the gulf war now again as we said we're not sure what caused this um it could possibly
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:33.280]  and we emphasize possibly had been a ground impact of a scud it could have been a ground
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:37.520]  impact of a patriot or it could have been a blue crystal screen between he's got the blue screen
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:42.000]  behind him it's like a fake palm tree a plastic palm tree these scud missiles incoming were fired
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.160]  to react you can see some of the lights shining off his forehead they were both shot down charles
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:51.440]  jaco cnn reporting live from saudi arabia he was in an inlanta basement is that a saturday night
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:56.880]  live skit what what was that i love the part hold on hold on that's not the clip that's not the clip
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:02.320]  find the clip where they they they sent the sirens off and he freaks out and puts a gas mask on that's
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:07.200]  the bombshell clip wait and doesn't the guy next to him put on a helmet yeah yeah there he comes in
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:12.880]  with a this is so ridiculous on a helmet think about anyone who bought this crap here go go to the
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:22.560]  clip this is cnn faking news oh look at this yeah yeah what is it this is pure comedy man
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:30.160]  cnn live in saudi arabia not in saudi news this guy gets down he's buckling his helmet
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:40.080]  and jaco puts on a gas mask so oh yeah jaco the wrong here jaco's got the gas mask on what about
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:44.960]  the cameraman what about the other guy right right they're all gonna die of sarin gas i guess
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:51.520]  according to now he takes it off he's like oh the attack has passed we're gonna live we're gonna live
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:52:00.240]  this is cnn literally faking news what year was this about 1991 or something around then i would
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:07.840]  guess 91 and then you have the new one what year i thought some 90 90 okay and then you have the
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:13.760]  new one and then you have the new one where they set up a fake protest and they recruit people off
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:18.000]  the street to stage a fake protest and then they shoot their camera shot like there's a real protest
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.560]  going on what about the time when was it cnn they had two reporters in the same parking lot and they
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:29.280]  sent all the remote reporter but the same buses are driving behind both reporters talk about fake
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:34.560]  news cnn deliberately fakes the news people this is the key when info wars you know info wars is
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:38.960]  covering breaking news sometimes early details have to get corrected that's called journalism
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:46.640]  that's called covering real news cnn fabricates fake news with fake sets fake parking lot scenes
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:52.240]  cnn fakes the news why is why aren't these democrat congress people calling for cnn to
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:56.160]  be banned for faking the news huh you know what let's go back to the democrats in congress let's
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:53:01.360]  go back to raskin who out of one side of his mouth says hey conservatives are trying to shut down
[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:06.400]  liberals and then on the other side of his mouth says we need to shut down info wars i mean raised
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:12.720]  a very profound yeah go ahead roll it raised a very profound concern about the continuing
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:20.400]  demonization and vilification of families and children who were victimized in episodes of
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:26.400]  mass gun slaughter and we know it's now an ideological fixture on the right wing in america
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:32.480]  to deny the existence of these atrocities pauses so we're not even allowed to report on it you
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:37.360]  i'm not even allowed to report on a mass shooting i'm demonizing people if i just report on it let's
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:43.120]  go back newtown connecticut what took place in parkland and then to allege that they're
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:48.720]  the product of uh some kind of conspiracy or hoax and of course the the founding myth in this vein
[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:52.960]  is holocaust revisionism which claims that the holocaust never took place which we have nothing
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:57.200]  to do with mr britch asks the question what's being done about this have you appointed so he
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:02.880]  makes a false a false equivalent there of course the problem of bias against people who are victims
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:08.400]  of gun violence and the way that they are being treated on the internet and the way that there
[01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:15.840]  is voice being given to people who are denying uh the historical fact of their experience you know
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:20.320]  what about certainly interrupt here what about the cnn pushing the chemical violence of children
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:24.800]  uh you know we're talking about the mass psychiatric drugging of children and senior citizens over a
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:30.080]  quarter of a million americans by some estimates die each year by fda approved prescription drugs
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:35.280]  oh no no no no no no no no no no no no uh for chemical violence prescription drugs kill more
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:40.720]  people in this country than cocaine heroin and methamphetamine combined yes yes prescription
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:46.240]  opioids alone or what cdc said 60 000 plus per year that's that's more americans than died in the
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:52.400]  entire vietnam war by the way every year and cnn is promoting that industry they have a lot of
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:57.600]  violence against children and cnn is in denial of that you talk about denying violence against
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:01.760]  children you can't get a better example than cnn and pushing their pharmaceuticals and pushing
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:06.640]  their toxic pesticides herbicides glyphosate in the food supply how many cases of cancer
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:10.560]  you know 300 000 plus people die of cancer every year in america i believe that's the
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:15.360]  correct number many of them are children i mean you talk about violence against children that
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:21.280]  dwarfs anything that happened in parkland or even sandy hook not not that those numbers are small
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:26.640]  but compared to the number of children killed by chemical violence promoted by cnn through toxic
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:33.520]  poison chemicals drugging medications i mean it's insane we've got to change the script on this this
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:40.320]  is not about what info wars reports about parkland this is about cnn poisoning america poisoning
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:46.400]  children mentally and physically death that's the real issue cnn should be ashamed of themselves
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:52.160]  they are poison pushers and they push that poison for profit and then they dare attack you and alex
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:56.800]  jones for having a different point of view that even mark zuckerberg says they should be allowed
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:00.480]  to have a different point of view i still say mark zuckerberg should come on the alex jones show
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:05.120]  let's go back to uh congressman raskin the parkland survivors or crisis actors that violates our
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.680]  policies we remove it but to your question about remove it and then and they're allowed to again
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:14.000]  it just pause real quick i just it's so we get we're never gonna get through this they just it's
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.200]  just so ridiculous mike they never play the clips they never show any evidence they just make these
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:25.040]  false claims and then it just becomes out there as as a truth right when there's no evidence of it
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:29.040]  all right go back they're demonstrating fake news as they're testifying they're making it they're
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:33.920]  making fake news they're and they're allowed to continue to keep putting it out in the future
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:38.960]  or are they banned from facebook uh we would remove that content if they put it up again and at a
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:43.440]  certain point their account or their page would be removed so just to explain what's happened with
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:48.720]  info wars because they've made a cottage industry out of this what they do is they deny
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:53.120]  that these events have happened that's totally false is fake is completely false we have removed
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.040]  content from the info wars page to the extent that it's violated our policies they have not
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:00.800]  reached the threshold at which they're entirely you know she didn't correct the record right that
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:04.960]  she didn't tell the truth the nature of the violation so there are sometimes more severe
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:11.360]  violations and all right well look um i'm with mr lu which is that you guys are private journalistic
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:19.200]  entities right now um but if you're going to be uh ideologically badgered and bulldozed to take
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:23.680]  positions in the interest of right wing politics then you're gonna have to look at what's happening
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:30.000]  there because i can't believe it that's what i'm saying oh my god these people are badgering info
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:36.320]  wars at alex jones every day lying about what he said lying about info wars they are fake news
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:41.360]  every word that comes out of their mouth is is fake can you believe that can you believe what you

[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:14.480]  seen all the dvds and followed all your guests and i've been using your product since the first
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:20.560]  iteration of survival shield and since then i'm on the x2 the super male vitality the caveman
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:26.240]  the real red pill micro zx body it's all amazing thank you brother yeah and i wanted to say that
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:32.000]  by following you so much it's like you're just detoxing the mind you're detoxing the body you're
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.440]  detoxing the spirit and it's just the more you know god the more you fear god but the more you
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:42.480]  chase god and i wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you the crew and the
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:53.760]  listeners out here 1776 world war you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:11.200]  info wars dot com is tomorrow's news today and now your host owin treuer
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:16.560]  all right filling in for alex jones here we may be hearing again from alex before the end of the
[02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:20.880]  broadcast i know he's fired up about the latest remarks zuckerberg but i want to go back to this
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:26.320]  clip that i can't get out because i can't stop talking i don't even know how to explain this
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:35.280]  you have a democrat congressman calling for info wars to be shut down and then says that
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:42.720]  that essentially info wars is is bullying liberals off of social media honestly i i'm struggling to
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:47.360]  find the worst to even explain how how ludicrous this is so so i guess i'll just play the clip
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:50.720]  so just cue it up to that right moment guys so we don't play the whole clip again do we have it
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:59.440]  queued up to the right moment listen to congressman raskin i'm i'm beyond words i i cannot believe
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:06.080]  that anybody would a say this in front of congress and get away with it this is this is truly
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:13.040]  incredible this is the epitome of irony what raskin is about to say go ahead and roll it
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:20.640]  but if you're going to be uh ideologically badgered and bulldozed to take positions in the interest
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:24.640]  of the right wing politics then we are going to have to look at what's happening there because
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:28.960]  at that point there's not viewpoint neutrality would you agree that you should not be catering
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:33.280]  to particular interest as opposed to everybody who's concerned about what's taking place on
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:38.720]  a gentleman's time has well expired so we're gonna uh now recognize mr rutherford of florida for five
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:44.000]  minutes i would love it if you would follow up also about alex jones and info wars if certain
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:49.840]  content you're saying has been taken down when they are taunting the students from parkland
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:02:00.880]  but at what point does the whole page get taken down he calls for a democrat in congress
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:05.920]  at a congressional hearing that they don't air on c span because they don't want you to see it
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:14.720]  calls for info wars to be shut down and then says that info wars is trying to shut down liberals
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:23.840]  uh seriously i i don't even know how to properly uh i can't even believe this
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:28.240]  i can't even think of a real analogy to this this is like
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:39.200]  that that has to be the most ludicrous thing i've ever seen in congress and let me tell you i've
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:45.200]  seen some crap i mean anytime hank johnson opens his mouth you're just stunned at the
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:53.840]  utter stupidity hank johnson has been reelected twice after he said islands float he thought
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:59.840]  guam was gonna tip over if too many people were on one side he got reelected twice
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:07.840]  he's a complete bumbling fool a moron oh my god think about the people that would vote for him
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:15.280]  but seriously how do you i i just i
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:23.200]  this has to be the most unprecedented double speak this is right out of 1984
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:31.120]  raskin for five minutes calls for info wars to be shut down and then claims that facebook is
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:36.080]  catering to right wing politics even though it's conservatives that have been banned on facebook
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:41.360]  it's conservatives that are getting censored on facebook like what in the hell is he talking about
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:52.000]  you haven't in i'm just you have an entire three hour hearing about facebook twitter youtube
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:57.920]  censorship because they're censoring conservatives that's the whole basis like that's the whole thing
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:05.520]  is how can they censor conservatives that's the entire scope of the entire hearing the third time
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:11.120]  they've had one you've had diamond and silk you've had zuckerberg this is the third congressional
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:17.440]  hearing it's all about how social media is censoring conservatives and then this jackass raskin
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:22.880]  says you need to stop catering to right wing politics you need to quit being bullied and
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:28.080]  badgered by the right wing to to to cater to them to for your social media platforms
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:35.840]  dude you have been calling for them to shut down the right wing you've been calling for it's like
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:45.280]  i don't even know how the wow wow they don't want you to see people like
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:53.600]  like congressman raskin a total idiot who's dumber raskin or or or hank johnson
[02:04:56.720 --> 02:05:03.840]  anyone who's studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified we have global
[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:09.760]  hardcore anti-human psychopaths in control the big corporations they're trying to wreck free market
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:15.840]  and consolidate total control dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines and trump
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:20.560]  has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future they are launching a civil
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:25.680]  war against nation states right now collapsing our borders and my only message is this everybody
[02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:30.960]  better wake up and realize the fight is now everybody should be very very urgent because the
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:36.080]  left and the globalists are frantic and launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:41.360]  people those of us that are pro-human don't crave power we already have the power but we have to
[02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:47.280]  realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now info wars
[02:05:47.280 --> 02:06:13.200]  is on the front line and so are you we are the resistance
[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:20.800]  i have thought an awful lot about blowing up the white house protesters followed trump supporters
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:25.520]  to their cars as they left the convention center around the corner and away from police protection
[02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:34.160]  on san carlo street a mob mentality to robert what do you say to the people who are who dragged
[02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:38.720]  a poor white guy out of a car and beat him all my goodness poor white people please all my staff
[02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:45.440]  these were pure attacks trump supporters men women even the elderly left this building last night
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:51.360]  and walked right into danger police say anti-trump protesters sprayed five trump supporters including
[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:58.240]  an eight and 11 year old girl outside anaheim city hall the guy who has a trump shirt on
[02:06:58.240 --> 02:07:14.160]  oh it just got knocked in the back of the head he just got punched in the face and now they're rushing
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:20.080]  we're saying if you're out there and you're trying to represent your first amendment
[02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:25.200]  right to free speech if somebody comes and attacks you it's your right to defend yourself
[02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:33.200]  it got ugly violence erupting at the event is fight broke out fifth flying between trump
[02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:38.640]  supporters and anti-trump supporters it gets pretty ugly yeah i want to warn the folks watching at
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:43.520]  home you're about to see some very violent footage do you want to fight you better believe you can
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:53.040]  organize to say today's rallies were meant as a show of unity against what they call a seditious
[02:07:53.040 --> 02:08:00.320]  friend allegedly trying to sabotage the president see there a fennec delivery driver
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:04.720]  jumping in to try to put an end to the protest you don't like you don't like to get this strength

[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:16.080]  me because that's what's going to take believe me people like myself will stand up and we'll be
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:30.560]  coming right back at you you say you're president then you shouldn't be here wow what a time to be
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:36.480]  alive one of the men that will stand and fight is with me in studio again today rufio panman
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:41.600]  of course you've seen the viral videos by now uh i don't know where to go i wanted to get your take
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:46.160]  on congressman raskin calling for info wars to be shut down and then saying that the right
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:52.560]  wing is trying to shut the left wing down it's like uh utter nonsense double thing unlike anything
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:09:02.560]  you could ever imagine but while we see that clip i mean i it's like i don't want to fight fellow
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:10.080]  americans but at a certain point where do these people i mean these people don't even like america
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:14.640]  right i mean if you like i have videotape they say down with america death to america these people
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:19.920]  are communists man so they want to shut down the country that provides all of our freedom and
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:26.000]  prosperity and they don't want real men and women to stand up to them right yeah exactly and and and
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.080]  you of course will stand up to them other people will stand up for them i mean just just what do
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:34.320]  you think is the mindset right now of these people do they do they think that they can really win this
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:42.400]  battle do they think they can really shut america down um you know i i can't you know um on behalf
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:46.000]  of them i think they're just reaching for anything they can't i think they're grabbing for anything
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:51.360]  and everything and making up things as we saw earlier in that clip he's just blatantly lying
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:55.680]  about alex jones and info wars this is happening with people like faith goldie lauren southern
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:01.040]  mylo you know alex jones even me now that i'm starting to come a little bit more famous they're
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:07.600]  doing everything everything they can to tarnish your name and create lies about you and i you know
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:12.880]  at a certain point you wonder if they're ever going to learn but it's not you know what if you
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:19.040]  don't understand that america is the greatest nation in the world to create a life for yourself
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:25.520]  to raise a family to to to have freedom and prosperity if they just want to spit on that
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:29.120]  then how are they even going to come to the grips of reality that that they're not even
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:34.400]  going to win this fight i mean they can't even understand what they're doing here yeah um you
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:39.200]  know yeah it's nothing nothing makes sense there's no logic here this is this isn't like a a fair
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:45.200]  fight like we're competing uh in a campaign this is just straight lies um this isn't who's better
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:50.240]  who's more righteous this is just straight lies and they're and they're trying to uh sway the
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:54.240]  public and you know in some cases it's working uh with the people who are kind of brainwashed
[02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:59.600]  they're following this narrative and it's dangerous no that's exactly it the democrats call for
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:06.240]  violence the democrats demonize people like us and so what you have is a bunch of brainwash
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:10.080]  treatmentians that go out there thinking they're fighting some good fight but they don't even it's
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:15.280]  like look at the optics you're the ones out here with weapons you're the ones out here with your
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:19.360]  face is covered you're the ones out here hitting women and children i mean even the optics you
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:24.080]  think that they would see the optics and realize they're on the wrong side yeah well i mean you
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:32.000]  know um there it's really odd to see how fast they can recruit um and that's why it's so suspicious
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:37.120]  i mean we've spent you know almost a better half of two years doing what we can to spread the word
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:43.520]  recruit as much as we can get people out there and within a weekend it seems like if they can gather
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:49.600]  a thousand plus people you know and so obviously what they're doing is somewhat effective and that's
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:55.280]  why it's dangerous and it really makes you wonder who these people are yeah you know because they
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:59.920]  have their face cover these all these all professors are these you know people that work in government
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:04.960]  i mean who are these people that are going out here and trying to start fights that they can't
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:08.960]  even finish i mean that's what i'm saying like i mean you're the same day it's like i'm not here
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:13.440]  trying to start a fight trust me i am not here trying to start a fight but i'll be damned i'll
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:18.240]  finish it right the part that worries me a lot is you know just like you're saying who are these
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:22.720]  people i mean these people could be your children's teacher you know they could be your doctor
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:26.640]  people that you feel like you should be able to trust you know on the other hand they're
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:32.880]  putting on a mask and going out there and beating on americans and so you know this is kind of our
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:38.480]  dilemma here is there's these thousands of people showing up with masks and they could very well be
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:43.200]  your neighbor or somebody you feel like you should trust for your own safety and you can't know who
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:49.120]  they are like and a lot of them have been have been caught and arrested and it turns out they are
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:54.720]  professors and that is a scary thought and i go out to these protests i have ut professors
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:00.880]  blowing fart whistles at me it's like that literally happens i it happened three times
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:07.360]  and then i and then i found her at another uh protest and i said oh i said hey where's your
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:12.240]  fart whistle today and she goes oh what are you talking about i've never talked to you i'm like
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:17.920]  woman i have the footage and now i have the footage of you denying the footage it's like they don't
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:23.280]  even honestly it's crazy it's it's crazy rufio they don't even live in reality anymore it's
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:27.920]  like they just create their own reality as they go along and it's just whatever's convenient for
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:33.280]  them at the moment yeah i remember watching that specific clip and it was hilarious because i'd seen
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:38.080]  the other i'd seen the other footage as well so i know exactly what you're talking about um and i
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:44.240]  you know at this point i've just i've lost um the need or the feel for the need to debate these people
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:48.640]  i've tried i've spent hours and hours and hours trying to talk to them and and like you said they
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:52.160]  just have these whistles and these blow horns and stuff and they get in your face there's no
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:56.880]  there's no interest on their side to find middle ground and so you have to ask yourself you know
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:00.800]  what do you do then you know when they're backing you physically and things like that
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:08.480]  well and there is no debate i that specific event that i went to i i said it to the camera i go look
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:14.080]  i'm gonna ask every individual here there about 50 people there i said i'm gonna ask every single
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:19.920]  one of these people why they're out here what they're protesting i asked every single one
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:26.800]  not one of them could give me a concise answer not one of them yeah fleckis talks does does a
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:34.480]  really good job at kind of um you know getting under their radar and he yeah yeah that's a good
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:41.520]  way to put it of the left because they're not triggered by his presence and it's amazing to
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:47.120]  watch you know obviously your guys and your style and his style and people like him and just see this
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:52.720]  almost the same reaction the same logic except when they're talking to you they're just so triggered
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:57.680]  yeah because i'm you know i'm a snarling bulldog i'm obnoxious and i have the info was my flag so
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:01.440]  they're immediately triggered by my presence but but fleckis kind of like you said he kind of goes
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:05.600]  under the radar sneaks in and they think they're having just a real conversation with somebody
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:10.000]  and then they give their genuine thoughts and ideas and it's just like and it's still the same

[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:13.680]  oh
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:23.200]  oh yes it's mind control all right how else do you explain people protesting against their own
[02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:30.400]  freedom their own prosperity you've got democrats i've got the story somewhere democrats are now
[02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:35.840]  suing over the trump tax cuts do you see how insane this is
[02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:43.760]  who doesn't want a tax cut i mean what and it wasn't until trump that now democrats admit
[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:48.560]  that they want to increase your taxes i mean it's it's honestly shocking brock obama comes out
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:56.560]  yesterday in a speech in johannesburg south africa and he says that men are are getting on his nerves
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:21:02.560]  so so rufio he says men have been getting on his nerves recently i i think he's talking about people
[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:08.560]  like you i'm sure you know that's probably exactly what he's talking about how dare you punch out his
[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:15.360]  street minions yeah well so there's a huge not only are we facing a kind of quiet civil war
[02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:22.000]  there's a blatant war against men right now um you know obviously we've all heard the term toxic
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:27.040]  masculinity it's out there and it's you know when you when you start going to these college campuses
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:33.360]  it's just so crazy the kind of things they'll say to you and they won't even take your opinion
[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:38.720]  as legitimate just because you're a man just because you show any kind of masculinity especially
[02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:42.880]  if you know if you're a white guy or you know any of these things you start to lose legitimacy in
[02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:47.680]  their eyes one one after another and it's all fake like they don't even know you this is this guy
[02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:52.480]  that they're showing right now is the perfect example this guy's probably hopped up on drugs
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:56.640]  hopped up on hatred and he comes out here he spits at me he throws punches at me
[02:21:57.520 --> 02:22:01.840]  he curses at me and i just feel bad for the guy and but but you know what rufio what
[02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:05.920]  why don't you let obama street minions just beat you up and beat you with billy clubs why don't
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:10.000]  you just let them do it that's what they want you to do that i mean just lay down don't be a man
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.840]  just just let them beat you senseless yeah i've always been stubborn you know i've always been
[02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:19.200]  a really stubborn all my whole life defiance huh you know maybe it'll it'll take one of these days
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:22.880]  if they're just persistent enough maybe i'll just give in you know maybe i'll do that i don't know
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:28.320]  the funny thing is i don't even think you know there's this video we've been looking for it
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:32.960]  i think was from the london protest where they put a trump mask on one of those boxing dummies
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:36.960]  you know with the body where you do the kick and boxing exercises and stuff and they put a
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:41.200]  trump mask on it and and they're all taking their turns punching and kicking and you're just like
[02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:47.920]  oh my gosh like you couldn't even hurt me like you know i mean i'm sure you've seen their training
[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:54.880]  videos where they do like yeah i saw there's a a post i think it was uh roe city and tifa
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:23:00.240]  they were talking about how they do navy seal training and i've that's the hardest training
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:05.520]  in the world i've done navy seal training with navy seals and it's not something you
[02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:12.320]  necessarily brag about it's just something about it's enduring you know hard things it's not like
[02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:17.520]  you're becoming a better fighter or anything like that it's about you know being able to be in cold
[02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:23.280]  water for long periods of time so obviously they don't know what they're talking about and it's funny
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:27.120]  that they make these claims i mean yeah look at this video here yeah i got news for you buddy
[02:23:27.120 --> 02:23:32.960]  that's not navy seal training no navy seal training is actually probably the hardest
[02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:40.400]  training regimen in the world yeah those guys do incredible thing in fact i i remember i had friends
[02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:45.760]  ufc fighters now that that did the navy seal training and they're the toughest people i know
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:51.280]  and they were just like just god-smacked at how these seals are able to just go do this training
[02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:56.400]  and just just knock it out just like bam yeah yeah it's about overcoming all sorts of obstacles
[02:23:56.400 --> 02:24:01.440]  it's not necessarily about building strength or you know becoming a better fighter it's it's about
[02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:08.400]  testing you know you're the spirit of a man oh my gosh i think they found it look at this madness
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:16.640]  that's it yep oh my gosh that's the closest they'll ever get right there and it's like it's like a
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:22.880]  whole like it's like a fake victory for them it's just like when uh it's just like when they uh it's
[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:28.000]  a decent kick i'll give that guy some credit it's just like when they um they tore down the uh
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:34.240]  confederate statue and they and so they rip it down and then they all run up to it and they start
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:39.360]  kicking it and punching it and it's like a total faux victory it's like dude you're hitting an inanimate
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:43.680]  object yeah but they still get a sense of victory from it because they've never had any real victories
[02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:48.160]  in life yeah that's the uh keyboard warrior mentality that's how they celebrate and that's
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:53.200]  their victory right there uh because if they were hitting a real person um they would probably
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:25:00.000]  like look at this is deranged behavior right here this is genuinely deranged behavior look
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:05.040]  at this woman that if that isn't an example of a human being that needs to be put in a mental
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:11.440]  institution this is their highlight reel right here guys guys pull up pull up also the video of
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:16.480]  the uh when they when they tear down the democrat or it is a democrat statue actually when they tear
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:21.200]  down the democrat uh confederate statue so that's that's a funny thing the democrats are the ones
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:27.840]  that put all the confederate statues up you go look at the history seriously guys pull up pull
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:31.840]  up the video where they they tear down the the confederate statue and then they're all running
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:37.520]  up to it punching it like having a victory like yeah we beat the confederates uh the confederates
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:44.320]  lost 50 plus years ago it's like i don't know we got three minutes left of this segment just
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:48.960]  just what do you think comes next with with the street protests i mean do you think it's going
[02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:52.240]  to get worse do you think these people are going to realize that they're on the wrong side of history
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:59.360]  or how do you think this goes um you know what we saw in portland um i think we're going to keep
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:05.360]  continuing to see things like that maybe not as violent um but i think we're going to start
[02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:10.640]  seeing more conservatives show up and push back and hopefully yeah we'll start to see that they
[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:14.560]  realize they're on the wrong side of history right now and then hopefully they'll start leaving in
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:19.680]  droves like they are the democratic party yeah here's the clip of them taking down the confederate
[02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:26.640]  statue now they all get to have their little fake victory yeah spit on it man yeah yeah right on man
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:42.160]  right on yeah right on man this is a group of deranged lunatics and you know but it's like
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:46.080]  the same thing i'm saying i don't want to fight these people they can go out and be deranged
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:50.560]  lunatics and do whatever the hell they want just stay out of my way just quit trying to destroy
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:56.000]  this country and if you if you want to start a fight it's going to be finished and it's not
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:00.640]  going to be finished by you it's going to be finished by people like rufio that you couldn't
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:07.360]  even that you couldn't even hurt if he gave you 500 free shots at him it's just ridiculous to me
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:13.840]  there there he goes that's i mean but you know i know that you don't want to go punch these people
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:19.280]  you're that's not what you that's i mean it reaches a point where you have an instinct to defend
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:25.440]  yourself but you didn't you didn't grow up thinking oh i'm going to be a street warrior that's going
[02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:30.000]  to fight commies in the street you didn't nobody thinks like that that's the that's the that's the
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.480]  platform they've now given you yeah i mean if you would have found me too you know two years ago
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:38.480]  i would not have ever thought that i'd be out there on the streets doing that i just didn't
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:43.520]  think that this is where we would be you know i grew up in in a part of america where everybody
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:48.800]  was really you know polite to each other and and so to start seeing this stuff happen in the streets
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:54.960]  was you know uh surprising to say the least well we were glad to have you here we're glad that you
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:28:00.080]  came to austin to be in studio with us and um you know uh hopefully you don't have to deal with too

[02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:43.440]  1776 when it was the united states of america that changed the entire status quo of being a human
[02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:52.960]  where we said the individual human is independent and can be self relying we don't need
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:58.880]  a king or queen we don't need and i just an establishment we don't need a government we just
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:05.760]  need freedom we just need me we just need independence change the world
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:11.520]  change the world for good created the most wealth and prosperity the world has ever seen
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:18.800]  and now here you are you know but the incredible thing about it is
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:26.080]  is you would expect this perhaps from brainwashed sheeple that don't understand history because
[02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:31.920]  they were never taught it so they don't even understand how good they have it uh because
[02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:36.080]  they have no perspective but for people on television people in the democrat party to
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:42.400]  go down that same thought pattern is alarming look at this clip again and it's like this is why
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:48.560]  i stand with ron paul and ran paul this is why i'm so proud to be a patriot right now because
[02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:53.360]  i know what history is going to say about these times we are the people that will once again
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:35:00.080]  change the world for the good once again say the average individual human can be self-reliant
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:08.320]  we don't need a king we don't need a government you can do everything that is america you're free
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:16.160]  you're independent you're self-reliant and now they've tried to wash it all away look at how
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:22.880]  cbs news treats ran paul talking about trump putin summit listen you've heard the avalanche
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:28.720]  of criticism and negativity appalling shameful disgraceful shocking it's coming from all sides
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:34.000]  and i'm wondering you're here this morning you're doing a cleanup one aisle three well you know i
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:39.040]  think we ought to take a step back and look at the bigger picture and decide whether or not we want
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:43.200]  to have conversations with even our adversaries during the height of the cold war during the
[02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:48.720]  cuban missile crisis kennedy had a direct line to cruise shop and i think the world is uh a safer
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:54.080]  and a much better place because we had that line of communication we had ambassadors so we had let
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:58.080]  me finish my question if you can ask questions let me finish all right all right it was also it was
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:02.560]  also a good idea but you put the truth out ambassadors and diplomatic relations with russia
[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:07.040]  even though they are our adversaries senator paul i don't think anybody would object to trying to
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:13.520]  have a good relationship with russia i think the problem is that he seemed to throw it right there
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:20.000]  is she serious did she they're all demonizing trump they're all demonizing putin they're all
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.320]  demonizing russia they're saying russia's the enemy and then she's like well i don't think anybody
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:30.240]  wants to not have a good relationship with russia that's exactly what you're trying to do this is
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:37.520]  this is okay go on jen's community under the bus while doing that is there a part of you that
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:42.240]  wishes i think that's incorrect i think that's incorrect i think what you just said that no
[02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:46.800]  one would object to him meeting with putin every democrat on capital he'll objected to him
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:52.720]  exactly bingo every a neoconservative and warmonger on the right also objected to it so yes the vast
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:57.040]  majority of the foreign policy community the bipartisan consensus said you shouldn't meet
[02:36:57.040 --> 02:37:00.960]  with putin they also said he shouldn't meet with kim and this is an extraordinary thing about
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:05.040]  president trump that should be lauded and not belittled is that he is willing to meet with
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:10.240]  adversaries to try to prevent us from having uh world war three but you talked about the uh
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:14.320]  and that's what they want they want to work with russia distinct about both uh president kennedy
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:18.800]  you mentioned and president reagan was that they did two things they both met with america's adversaries
[02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:23.440]  and they were quite clear about america's moral view about the repression of both the soviet union
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:31.040]  and then subsequent to that russia now which most uh people think is led by uh basically a dictator
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:35.120]  what the president didn't do and is getting criticized for is he did not make that moral
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:40.320]  case he basically said in the relationship between the two both sides are at fault that's the
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:43.680]  distinction here not the weather to have a meeting so what about that but i don't think
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:47.920]  you're yeah but i don't think you're being fair of the president no they never had president reagan
[02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:54.480]  met with uh korbachev do you think he uh listed the uh litany of soviet abuses from stalin on
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:59.040]  in a one to one meeting no they were listed and recounted by other people in the administration
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:02.560]  there have also been people within the trump administration have listed and recounted
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:07.360]  the human rights violations in russia but we also have to understand that we have to
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:11.680]  deal with the world as it is not as we wish it to be and if we're only going to talk to people
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:16.080]  who have perfect constitutional republics we're going to have a very small audience and we're
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:21.600]  going to have a lot of potential conflict with no outlet for diplomacy so no i think the president
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:26.480]  did a good thing by meeting with putin and i think it's a mistake for people to try to try to turn
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:32.400]  this into a partisan partisan escapade senator president reagan called the soviet union the evil
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:37.440]  empire many of his most famous comments are calling out the soviet union on its moral
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:42.000]  shortcomings so i think that come comparison between president reagan and president trump is
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:47.200]  is off a bit but let me ask you this question is also ridiculous they're comparing they're
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:52.160]  comparing russia to the soviet union i mean that's absurd the evil empire in a press conference with
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:58.800]  borbachev he also sat down with borbachev and we also had uh strategic arms limitations so they he
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:03.360]  actually did well the rhetoric was strong you actually might compare that to uh trump's rhetoric
[02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:07.760]  with north korea it's been very strong but he's been willing to sit down with them so i think there's
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:11.920]  actually some apt comparisons between reagan and trump on the diplomatic front the difference here
[02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:17.120]  is senator the president trump is not short about offering criticism to american allies
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:22.880]  whether it's on the german gas deal or whether they want rand paul to say trump bad so much
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:28.640]  they're just want to say trump is bad just say he's bad rand just say it itself in a one-on-one
[02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:33.200]  interview bends over backwards to say nice things about the russians and that that robsom of an
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:38.960]  opportunity to make a clear moral case about the distinction between america which has grown up and
[02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:43.600]  had a history of supporting freedom and the russian regime which does not do so and why not
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:48.560]  take that opportunity as an american president i think that's what what this gets into is that
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:53.680]  the president has undergone an onslaught of a year a year and a half of a partisan investigation
[02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:57.600]  accusing him of somehow colluding with the russian so i think he's sensitive to that but there's
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:02.000]  another aspect of the investigation that is a legitimate one and that is saying did russians
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:06.720]  hack hillary clinton's emails and so there's a legitimate aspect and then there's a partisan
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:12.080]  aspect and we all have now concluded and all understand that the investigation was started
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:17.040]  by partisans jamed clapper john brennan who started the investigation at the behest of the
[02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:22.720]  clinton campaign who paid somebody in russia to come up with a dossier so really it's funny
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:27.200]  that we keep talking about trump and russia when in fact the only person actually known to pay russian
[02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:32.000]  agents was hillary clinton who paid a british spy who then paid british agents for dirt on
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:37.040]  uh... concocted dirt on trump i know we can go down that road again but i still think the question
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:42.160]  remains doesn't happen to the american intelligence community under the bus i still think that's a
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:45.840]  big question that we were writing but we're gonna have to leave it there one of the reasons for it
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:50.320]  one of the reasons for it is change clappers a known uh liar has lied to congress so that's why
[02:40:50.320 --> 02:40:54.400]  you have this problem for transparency senator a lot of people were outraged at this meeting took
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:58.240]  place privately i think that we're an outrage but we're gonna have to leave it there we appreciate
[02:40:58.240 --> 02:41:05.440]  i'm sorry yeah oh yeah oh we got we got ran paul on here we were hoping that he would say that
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:10.240]  trump is bad and and we and we we pressed him on it and for five minutes we tried to get him to
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:14.880]  say trump bad and he he wouldn't say trump bad so sorry uh ran paul we have no interest in having
[02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:20.080]  you on air anymore sorry unless you want to say trump bad ran do you want to say trump bad
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:24.000]  okay you don't want to say trump bad okay sorry we cut cut the segment cut them off cut them off cut
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:31.040]  them off they're so deranged that they're comparing the trump putin summit to pearl harbour do you
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:41.120]  know how offensive that is and now you're seeing the stories i can't even find them on my desk it's
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:47.280]  fine where trump there they're there here it is they're trying to say that trump is walking back
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:52.720]  his statements or or he didn't go far enough with his statements with putin here here's the here's
[02:41:52.720 --> 02:41:57.520]  the thing here's the subtleties and the nuance about donald trump that the media doesn't understand
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:06.080]  see trump is so much smarter than them and he can see five moves ahead so so he knows how to play
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:14.560]  the chessboard if donald trump would have lambasted vladimir putin during the trump putin summit
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:19.680]  if donald trump would have said oh yeah oh yeah they were hacking they're really bad they were
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:26.880]  hacking they meddled oh yeah if he would have done that the entire news cycle the next day would have
[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:32.800]  been look president trump admits russia rigged the election look president trump admits that he won
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:37.760]  because of russia look president trump admits his presidency is illegitimate that would have been the
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:43.120]  the narrative that would have been the talking point instead he knows that if he has a good
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:47.840]  relationship with putin the media will go off their rocker and just go completely psycho and
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:52.880]  compare it to pearl harbor so trump outsmarted you again you anti-american scum

[02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:46.560]  country and the democrats are ignoring all of them but you see here's the key they're trying
[02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:51.760]  to protect their establishment they're trying to protect their kingdom of screwing over the american
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:48:04.720]  people raping you stealing your money funding abortions do you know look this up the uh uh uh uh
[02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:11.600]  a planned parenthood i believe has spent 30 million dollars funding democrats for the midterm
[02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:21.440]  election see if you guys can find that uh why are they getting taxpayer dollars if you want to abort
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:30.560]  your baby that's between you and god okay quit making me pay for it and then and then but there's
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:35.600]  all these real issues going on yeah there it is right there planned parenthood groups to spend 30
[02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:41.680]  million on midterm elections so why are we funding planned parenthood i so now i'm funding the democrat
[02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:50.800]  party so now they take your tax dollars they they fund abortions and then they
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:55.600]  fund the democrat party that's anti-american
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:49:05.040]  it's honestly just so ridiculous they're becoming totally unhinged completely deranged
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:10.720]  because trump's the real deal the american people are waking up and their entire kingdom of robbing

[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:21.360]  corrupt and out of control trump is actually not corrupt and out of control and he's destroying the
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:26.240]  entire corrupt establishment that's why they're panicking that's why you have people like raskin
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:30.720]  talking out of both sides of their mouth at congressional hearings here's alex jones breaking
[02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:37.600]  it down these are one of the conspiracy theorists theorists whose brand is bullying college jones
[02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:41.920]  is going to hear this is going to say why is cnn out to get me why are you trying to take me down
[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:47.680]  and in the weeks after the shooting alex jones's youtube channel posted a video uh that was seen
[02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:54.880]  by 2.3 million subscribers alleging that these were merely uh that these were actors and not
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:59.520]  real students who had experienced the most horrific thing anyone could possibly imagine what's
[02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:04.720]  happened with the info wars because they've made a cottage industry out of this what they do is they
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:09.760]  deny that these events have happened why are they still on facebook you recently decided
[02:50:09.760 --> 02:50:14.480]  not to ban info wars can you explain that decision we would continue to remove any violations
[02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:20.640]  from the info wars page does it stop with jones or does it also go uh a transfer to other outlets
[02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:24.880]  i would love it if you would follow up also about alex jones and info wars i want to know how you're
[02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:31.440]  dealing with all these conspiracy theorists on your platform info wars tomorrow's news today
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:38.320]  they engaged in premeditated defamation these people are all lawyers they're very smart
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:43.920]  they defame me in fake lawsuits they filed fun about the democratic party knowing they're protected
[02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:48.880]  filing false statements under defamation in lawsuits and then they do it as members of congress
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:58.160]  protected with immunity for false statements but some of them made mistakes and made public
[02:50:58.160 --> 02:51:03.120]  statements outside of congress when they're not sitting in their chairs so i am forced as i've
[02:51:03.120 --> 02:51:08.000]  done with anti slap suits and other operations to prepare lawsuits i've sent the tort letters
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:16.400]  uh as of today to them and i've got those letters right here uh letting congressman dutch and
[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:24.320]  congressman uh raskin know that they are on notice of our lawsuits i don't want to follow
[02:51:24.320 --> 02:51:31.520]  these lawsuits but i cannot continue to allow them to lie they went in with an adl southern
[02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:35.680]  primary law center script southern primary law center and adl write a lot of the reports for
[02:51:35.680 --> 02:51:41.280]  soros run media matters and i know word for word that was media matters and they said
[02:51:42.080 --> 02:51:50.400]  jones says no one died at parkland in florida this year valentine's day my one of my daughter's
[02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:56.480]  birthday and that jones has bullied them there's no video there's no statements and in the weeks
[02:51:56.480 --> 02:52:02.880]  after the shooting alex jones's youtube channel posted a video uh that was seen by 2.3 million
[02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:09.760]  subscribers alleging that these were merely uh that these were actors and not real students who
[02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:14.880]  had experienced the most horrific thing anyone could possibly imagine the video violated youtube's
[02:52:14.880 --> 02:52:19.200]  rules against bullying and it was removed an article posted to slate dot com describes this
[02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:23.600]  as a strike against the channel miss downs uh how many strikes does a channel get
[02:52:26.640 --> 02:52:30.320]  typically a channel gets three strikes and then we terminate the channel
[02:52:30.320 --> 02:52:35.600]  so uh the reason i ask is alex jones obviously is a well known conspiracy theorist theorist
[02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:41.760]  whose brand is bullying their moderators from bloomberg uh uh uh from a southern
[02:52:41.760 --> 02:52:47.360]  primary law center bloomberg reported falsely made claims that i said nobody died and that i
[02:52:47.360 --> 02:52:51.920]  went and bullied them david hog a day after the event started working for the democratic party
[02:52:51.920 --> 02:52:57.120]  in soros flying around on private jets being anti-gun spokesperson i said he's a pr man
[02:52:57.120 --> 02:53:03.920]  and then he was an actor at the school part of the drama club so he's well spoken and he's been
[02:53:03.920 --> 02:53:08.560]  chosen to be anti-gun i said i believe people died and i believed he's a real student but
[02:53:08.560 --> 02:53:13.120]  they misrepresented it and said that i bullied him and said that nobody died even though he's a
[02:53:13.120 --> 02:53:17.920]  public figure i would have a right to say that i didn't say that uh when alex jones posted the
[02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:23.680]  video you described saying that the survivors of the parkland massacre were crisis actors that
[02:53:23.680 --> 02:53:28.320]  violated our harassment policy we have a specific policy that says if you say a well documented
[02:53:28.320 --> 02:53:34.160]  violent attack should happen and you use the name or image of of survivors or victims of that attack
[02:53:34.160 --> 02:53:39.680]  that is a malicious attack and it violates our policy and i did not post a video doing man it
[02:53:39.680 --> 02:53:44.960]  was all over the news they had to remove all the strikes they were putting strikes on videos that
[02:53:44.960 --> 02:53:50.880]  i put up showing what i'd said that i didn't say it and you got your ass kicked because i had info
[02:53:50.880 --> 02:53:59.200]  wars.com and i had news wars.com and i was able to counter and show what i said and that's why
[02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:06.080]  you're pissed so she knows this all full well it's a huge controversy so she says oh we took down
[02:54:06.080 --> 02:54:12.880]  she re defames me says it and then it continues here we go alex jones posted the video you described
[02:54:12.880 --> 02:54:18.400]  saying that the survivors of the parkland massacre were crisis actors that violated our harassment
[02:54:18.400 --> 02:54:23.600]  policy. They just opened themselves up to defamation but i know she thinks she's in a congressional
[02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:27.680]  hearing can do it i don't even want to sue these people lady you know who i am you're obsessed
[02:54:27.680 --> 02:54:34.400]  with me we have project veritas internal videos because i'm the guy that won't sell out i'm the
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:38.160]  guy that stands up against the psychopaths you're all just the scared lettuce that got controlled
[02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:44.880]  by them because you're about to stock on syndrome people so you just defame me again saying alex
[02:54:44.880 --> 02:54:50.880]  jones posted we took it down no i didn't and you know that don't go back to it
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:57.600]  that says if you say a well-documented violent attack well back up to the beginning are
[02:54:57.600 --> 02:55:04.320]  back at a 20 seconds i i'm stopping too much it's just everything they say is pure crap i did not
[02:55:04.320 --> 02:55:09.440]  put a video up you will not show it you will not show the text because you are a fraud
[02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:18.080]  and she knows full well who i am and she goes alex jones posted this when she knows full well
[02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:22.400]  that they had thousands of articles crap on them when they had to put it back up because
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:27.280]  their lawyers told them he's got 14 million views on the video countering you on his own
[02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:32.320]  server he's got his own platform we aren't going to be able to take him down today stop it he's
[02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:37.360]  goddess i've got your internal people recorded i've got videotapes i got stuff you even know
[02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:42.320]  about and you know it and you're just afraid the president's going to bust up your damn monopoly
[02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:48.480]  which i'm on my knees praying they do well alex jones puts out false content no that all got
[02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:55.680]  reversed and we want him banned why are you so obsessed with me because no one else will challenge
[02:55:55.680 --> 02:56:00.720]  you everyone else didn't have their balls dropped he launched similar attacks against the families
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:06.400]  who's six and seven year old kids were slaughtered at sandy hook and he's not the only one truthers
[02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:12.960]  have spread these lies claiming that sandy hook never happened at all a slate article references
[02:56:12.960 --> 02:56:16.640]  a study by jonathan albright director of the tau center for digital journalism at columbia who
[02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:22.400]  found 9 000 videos on youtube with titles that are and i quote a mixture of shocking vile and
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:28.640]  promotional themes that include rape game jokes shock reality social experiments celebrity pedophilia
[02:56:28.640 --> 02:56:33.840]  false flag rants and terror related conspiracy theories dating back to the oklahoma city attacks
[02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:39.680]  in 1995 so you mix terror related conspiracies in with false flags when gulf atonkin all these
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:44.080]  other things are declassified to be staged anybody has a right to question that when it's a history
[02:56:44.080 --> 02:56:48.800]  of it doesn't mean we always think it's fake we have to look at it we hope it never even happened
[02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:52.640]  to begin with but if it does we look at what really went on and terror related conspiracy
[02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:58.320]  theories dating back to the oklahoma city attacks in 1995 because again oh my god it dates back like
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:57:04.160]  hitler fire bombed their capital building to bring in martial law february 20th 1933 and the
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:08.320]  nine of the long knives were operation himmler and operation gliwitz the state's terror attacks
[02:57:08.320 --> 02:57:12.720]  on german bases to launch world war two or the history channel documentaries that admit the
[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:18.320]  us and british states false flags for pr purposes or false flags going back 500 years in the british
[02:57:18.320 --> 02:57:24.320]  and spanish navies but see those of us that are informed they don't want us asking questions so
[02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:29.680]  we've got another lawyer saying we need to be shut up because he doesn't like us asking questions
[02:57:29.680 --> 02:57:35.440]  because his party is getting its ass handed to him if you are receiving this transmission

[03:00:12.800 --> 03:00:39.520]  front lines of the information war it's alex jones emoji the image of the taiwanese flag
[03:00:39.520 --> 03:00:49.920]  it makes your phone crash number 12 years ago john mccain said if you hack anybody or you download
[03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:55.440]  illegal music we will fry your computer we will crash it or maybe even fry it people said that's
[03:00:55.440 --> 03:01:02.720]  outrageous they already had that technology apple's china friendly censorship caused an iphone crashing
[03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:12.880]  bug wired it goes on that if you try to send the taiwanese flag your iphone crashes well what happened
[03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:17.440]  five months ago apple officially moved to china to be tax exempt merged with the government and
[03:01:17.440 --> 03:01:22.720]  they told Reuters in china if you are based here the government runs you that's just the way it is
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:29.360]  and boom if they can censor a flag in real time they can do a voice print and ban alex jones
[03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:34.320]  or president trump they can ban words just like you try to type on your iphone a cuss word it won't
[03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:40.560]  let you do it it's beyond that it's here and that's the new article 13 article 11 the EU's been trying
[03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:49.040]  to pass saying that software by law will be on all devices where you cannot even say or do certain
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:54.960]  things preemptively now this was such a big blow up for apple they had to back off they said we

[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:09.520]  programs saying i'm a racist and misrepresenting who i am defaming me you've got the very same
[03:02:09.520 --> 03:02:14.320]  corporations and calling for me to be shut down so they can lie about me and you and we don't have
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:20.640]  a way to speak out or resist it and even counter it we have them suing is trying to shut us down
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:23.840]  they're trying to shadow ban and block the president which they're doing on twitter
[03:02:23.840 --> 03:02:30.160]  with his push notifications apple and others have moved to china and are now putting the
[03:02:30.160 --> 03:02:36.880]  iCloud data keys to everyone's iphone on their platform and admitting that chinese intelligence
[03:02:36.880 --> 03:02:42.000]  now runs apple most of the universities are run by the chai comms hollywood zone by it the ufc is
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:48.320]  being bought up by it everything and i'm just a loyal american sitting here saying it's wrong
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:53.360]  for an american citizen not to be able to send the taiwanese flag to somebody because the chai
[03:02:53.360 --> 03:02:58.480]  comms have killed over 100 million of their own people and sell christians organs because they're
[03:02:58.480 --> 03:03:02.880]  christians on the world market what tell me a 30 year old christian doesn't have a heartbeat or a
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:08.320]  soul next liberals you're not liberals you are weak followers that sold out to every form of
[03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:14.000]  evil and didn't even get a payoff to do it you like to watch mainstream news and feel like you're
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:19.600]  on the winning team let me tell you something i'm not here trying to just get along to go along
[03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:23.520]  or go along to get along i'm here to fight the globalist i'm here to hit the barb wire i'm here
[03:03:23.520 --> 03:03:29.040]  to expose them i'm here to never stop never back down and win and thank god trump's going to europe
[03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:33.760]  and saying we pay half a nato that's not fair pay a little more hey china you got a 900 billion
[03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:41.040]  dollar deficit on us give us 50 billion they said no he goes 250 500 billion let's go the days of
[03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:45.760]  everybody laying down are over and all you traders saying the president's a trader you're the trader
[03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:51.040]  and you're going to lose now don't forget we've launched while it's still available
[03:03:51.760 --> 03:03:58.080]  let them censor it that's just another victory to show who they are on iphone and android android
[03:03:58.080 --> 03:04:04.320]  the official info wars that works great live video streaming push notifications uh listen
[03:04:04.320 --> 03:04:20.240]  without watching you turn the video off everything
[03:04:34.480 --> 03:04:50.240]  so
[03:04:54.720 --> 03:04:57.840]  anyone who studied history and knows how human systems
[03:04:57.840 --> 03:05:05.040]  work is horrified we have global hardcore anti-human psychopaths in control of the big
[03:05:05.040 --> 03:05:10.880]  corporations they're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control dumb humanity down
[03:05:10.880 --> 03:05:15.760]  ahead of replacing us with machines and trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we
[03:05:15.760 --> 03:05:20.560]  have a human future they are launching a civil war against nation states right now collapsing
[03:05:20.560 --> 03:05:26.080]  our borders and my only message is this everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now
[03:05:26.080 --> 03:05:31.440]  everybody should be very very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and launching
[03:05:31.440 --> 03:05:36.880]  their anti-human plan because they crave to control people those of us that are pro-human
[03:05:36.880 --> 03:05:41.760]  don't crave power we already have the power but we have to realize these scum are coming after us
[03:05:41.760 --> 03:05:47.920]  and we have to speak out and take action now info wars is on the front line and so are you we are
[03:05:47.920 --> 03:06:06.640]  the resistance before you slip into unconsciousness and now the tip of the spear leading the fight
[03:06:06.640 --> 03:06:18.960]  to take back the nation it's roger stone welcome back you're on the alex jones show and these are
[03:06:18.960 --> 03:06:27.680]  tumultuous times we live in what we've seen unfold in recent days is nothing less than an
[03:06:27.680 --> 03:06:35.280]  all-out assault by the mainstream media and their handmaidens in the democratic party
[03:06:35.280 --> 03:06:41.520]  in an effort to destabilize a more and more popular and successful president
[03:06:42.640 --> 03:06:48.880]  the mere fact alone of the highly publicized indictments of russian intelligence officers
[03:06:48.880 --> 03:06:57.040]  being sought timed so as to short circuit the fallout from the fbi stroke testimony debacle
[03:06:57.040 --> 03:07:04.880]  and to shove the collusion hoax right into the forefront of all reporting literally hours before
[03:07:04.880 --> 03:07:11.440]  the president of the united states first important summit with the russians and their national leader
[03:07:11.440 --> 03:07:19.840]  is enough to conclude beyond any reasonable doubt that not only is the Mueller cell corrupt
[03:07:19.840 --> 03:07:29.520]  malintended and politicized but this cabal of doj and fbi insurrectionist criminals are actually
[03:07:29.520 --> 03:07:38.560]  brazen reckless and reckless enough to exploit their corrupt abusive sham investigation via
[03:07:38.560 --> 03:07:47.200]  Mueller's secretive ambush style prosecutorial style this is nothing less than an effort to
[03:07:47.200 --> 03:07:54.800]  sabotage the diplomatic and foreign policy of the undertakings of the president of the united states
[03:07:54.800 --> 03:08:06.080]  add to this the scripted coordinated greek chorus-like conniption fit of hysterical hyperbolic
[03:08:06.080 --> 03:08:15.360]  openly seditious mainstream media mow mows and their defamatory accusations uh above treason
[03:08:15.360 --> 03:08:24.960]  uh uh that is completely generated by the cia infested propaganda machine we call the mainstream
[03:08:24.960 --> 03:08:33.200]  media these crypto fascist pundits from the intelligence community and their mainstream
[03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:43.520]  media allies spin lie after lie in an effort to make up lost ground why because the american
[03:08:43.520 --> 03:08:50.960]  people are on to robert muller because the american people realize that this is a partisan witch hunt
[03:08:50.960 --> 03:09:00.320]  which has only one purpose to undo the results of the last election yes when anytime you are
[03:09:00.320 --> 03:09:07.760]  criticizing the president of the united states when he is on foreign soil you are on thin ice
[03:09:07.760 --> 03:09:15.920]  indeed these acts by the seditionists in the mainstream media and in both parties are apparent
[03:09:15.920 --> 03:09:24.240]  and despicable the other thing that i find incredibly despicable are the personal attacks
[03:09:24.240 --> 03:09:34.080]  on congressman jim jordan this is a complete fabrication led by a democrat connected law firm
[03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:43.520]  in ohio to try to take out one of the bravest most courageous boy scouts that i know a man of impeccable
[03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:52.000]  integrity do not be surprised if you shortly see similar fabricated personal attacks against
[03:09:52.000 --> 03:10:00.880]  congressman matt gates congressman ron desantis congressman trey gaudy congressman lee selden
[03:10:00.880 --> 03:10:08.960]  these men are heroes these men don't go didn't go to congress to go along to get along they are
[03:10:08.960 --> 03:10:15.600]  using their positions in government to fight the deep state and to take the muller cabal
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:24.080]  on frontally and as jim jordan's situation demonstrates they will pay a terrible price
[03:10:24.080 --> 03:10:33.120]  in the defamatory attacks on their personalities and characters jim jordan is an innocent man
[03:10:33.120 --> 03:10:41.360]  falsely accused in one of the most vicious smear campaigns that i have seen in 40 years
[03:10:41.360 --> 03:10:50.560]  in american politics also this morning uh there are reports that lawyers for andrew miller a
[03:10:50.560 --> 03:10:58.320]  former top eight of mine were in closed session with the chief judge of the district court of dc
[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:06.880]  and lawyers for the office of special counsel this is presumably the hearing for a motion
[03:11:06.880 --> 03:11:14.480]  by miller's lawyers headed by the washington legal foundation questioning the constitutional
[03:11:14.480 --> 03:11:23.280]  authority of mr muller no report from that all important hearing although i have had inquiries
[03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:30.800]  from talking points memo political and others i don't know what's happening behind closed doors
[03:11:30.800 --> 03:11:39.360]  but i am praying for justice also an interesting article by phil bump of the washington post now
[03:11:39.360 --> 03:11:46.720]  bump was caught repeatedly lying about bill clinton's sexual assaults against women during the
[03:11:46.720 --> 03:11:55.280]  2016 campaign mr bump is not a journalist mr bump is a propagandist on the payroll of the
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:12:04.800]  washington post today he says donald trump is touting mediocre economic statistics no the
[03:12:04.800 --> 03:12:12.560]  economy is growingly robust there are without any dispute more than one million jobs created
[03:12:12.560 --> 03:12:21.200]  since donald trump became president 228 000 in may alone the only thing mediocre here is you
[03:12:21.200 --> 03:12:32.080]  mr bump you are most mediocre as a reporter uh the other big news which we broke yesterday on the
[03:12:32.080 --> 03:12:43.920]  war room and this is a info wars exclusive omb director mic mulvaney will replace general john
[03:12:43.920 --> 03:12:52.960]  kelly as president donald trump's white house chief of staff as our friends over at one america
[03:12:52.960 --> 03:13:01.040]  online reported yesterday in a terrific story by jack passobiec we now know that in a complete
[03:13:01.040 --> 03:13:08.800]  act of treachery white house chief of staff john kelly was calling capitol hill republicans
[03:13:08.800 --> 03:13:15.120]  and urging them to publicly denounce his boss the president of the united states
[03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:22.560]  for his conduct of the summit press conference with putin if that isn't disloyalty if that
[03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:30.000]  isn't treachery what is it if i were president i would have general kelly removed forcefully
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:36.480]  from the premises right now and i would have his computer and his office locked locked down
[03:13:36.480 --> 03:13:43.840]  but then i'm not the president mic mulvaney on the other hand is not part of the washington swamp
[03:13:43.840 --> 03:13:51.840]  he hails from south carolina an early supporter of president donald trump a man of impeccable
[03:13:51.840 --> 03:14:00.320]  integrity whose political views and outlook are uncorrupted by the inside the beltway mentality
[03:14:00.320 --> 03:14:08.400]  which unfortunately has sometimes affected or infected the president's advisors you're here
[03:14:08.400 --> 03:14:16.320]  on the alex jones show we're breaking news today but let me remind you none of this would be possible

[03:20:55.680 --> 03:21:03.840]  to disagree with them and express ourselves in fact it's un-american to see congressmen like
[03:21:03.840 --> 03:21:11.680]  ted douche i mean deutch uh uh cavorting around talking about silencing our first amendment rights
[03:21:11.680 --> 03:21:18.240]  congressmen i know you're dumb but try reading the constitution the first amendment part and maybe
[03:21:18.240 --> 03:21:24.880]  you'll understand that america is based on a concept of freedom and that includes free speech
[03:21:25.680 --> 03:21:29.680]  joining us later on the war room will be congressman deutch's
[03:21:29.680 --> 03:21:38.320]  opponent javier manieris uh the republican uh who is going to discuss the outlandish extremist
[03:21:38.320 --> 03:21:46.560]  position of congressman deutch uh when it comes to censorship but the stunning admission by mark
[03:21:46.560 --> 03:21:55.840]  zuckerberg that he favors slow strangulation of info wars instead of outright decapitation
[03:21:55.840 --> 03:22:04.800]  is an outrage in itself all one has to do is be on facebook today uh where i have a hundred and
[03:22:04.800 --> 03:22:13.120]  fifty thousand followers at the stone cold truth yet when i post something i have written i get
[03:22:13.120 --> 03:22:22.400]  two reposts seven reposts three reposts and then every once in a while they'll let you have a hundred
[03:22:22.400 --> 03:22:30.480]  so as not to catch on to their manipulation of the algorithms these illegal monopolistic
[03:22:30.480 --> 03:22:38.080]  practices have got to be exposed in a court of law and that is where this fight is going
[03:22:38.080 --> 03:22:43.680]  the fight for fence censorship will be fought out at all levels in the streets through peaceful
[03:22:43.680 --> 03:22:52.800]  protest on the net and uh in the courts uh not to mention pushing this administration to have the
[03:22:52.800 --> 03:23:00.160]  assistant uh or deputy attorney general for antitrust to bring an immediate action against
[03:23:00.160 --> 03:23:09.440]  facebook twitter google amazon and others you see it's not just the future of info wars it's not
[03:23:09.440 --> 03:23:18.800]  just the future broadcasts of alex jones or roger stone or david night or oan schreuer or
[03:23:18.800 --> 03:23:25.200]  rob dew and so many of the other incredibly talented people here at info wars it's the
[03:23:25.200 --> 03:23:33.200]  future of donald trump in this administration it's the future of a free and fair election
[03:23:33.200 --> 03:23:40.880]  they worry about russian hacking i worry about leftist censorship you see 2016
[03:23:41.440 --> 03:23:49.040]  was the first year in which the mainstream media lost their stranglehold monopoly on political
[03:23:49.040 --> 03:23:58.480]  discourse prior to 2016 when critical mass was finally reached if it didn't happen on abc nbc
[03:23:58.480 --> 03:24:09.840]  cbs cnn and sometimes on fox well it didn't happen at all the rise of a free and open internet
[03:24:10.400 --> 03:24:18.800]  gave rise to a robust and alternative media and that alternative media gave donald trump
[03:24:18.800 --> 03:24:26.400]  a forum for a counter narrative uh to the lies being spread by the network you remember those
[03:24:26.400 --> 03:24:37.040]  news hillary clinton was a sure thing the odds of her winning 90 percent uh the uh the extraordinary
[03:24:37.040 --> 03:24:44.400]  extent to which the mainstream media went to create an atmosphere in which it was unquestioned
[03:24:44.400 --> 03:24:52.160]  that hillary would win seeking to create a safe a self-fulfilling prophecy was extraordinary
[03:24:52.160 --> 03:25:01.600]  and without info wars without bright bar without the daily caller without terrific uh talking heads
[03:25:01.600 --> 03:25:11.200]  like sean hannity and tucker carlson uh and laura ingram and others and without info wars being in
[03:25:11.200 --> 03:25:19.440]  the vanguard the election of donald trump will just never have been possible now they would like to
[03:25:19.440 --> 03:25:28.160]  run the 2018 elections and the 2020 elections without our voices and it's important that our
[03:25:28.160 --> 03:25:38.800]  fellow conservatives understand we at info wars are the test case we go first if they decapitate us
[03:25:39.760 --> 03:25:47.040]  they're coming for sean hannity they're coming for tucker carlson they're coming for laura ingram
[03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:54.640]  they're coming for michael savage they're coming for rush limbaugh they're coming for bright bar
[03:25:54.640 --> 03:26:02.000]  the daily caller and so many other conservative outlets like the gateway pundit and so many others
[03:26:02.720 --> 03:26:10.480]  this is the way in which we are not only the tip of the spear but we are the test case so object to
[03:26:10.480 --> 03:26:19.280]  the censorship of info wars or face the same censorship yourself in the days ahead this
[03:26:19.280 --> 03:26:26.480]  would be a spectacular time to remind you that we need your support in this epic war against
[03:26:26.480 --> 03:26:34.320]  censorship you have no idea the millions of dollars it will cost alex jones and info wars

[03:26:41.520 --> 03:26:51.120]  across the country these stories these uh lawsuits have two purposes one is to generate vicious
[03:26:51.120 --> 03:27:00.400]  negative headlines that can then be cited in turn as the basis for silencing our voices at youtube
[03:27:00.400 --> 03:27:09.760]  on facebook on twitter and so on it is going to cost literally millions of dollars to fight
[03:27:09.760 --> 03:27:19.360]  this soros funded onslaught against info wars we cannot do it alone therefore i ask you to go

[03:32:57.840 --> 03:33:13.760]  to the alex jones show
[03:33:15.040 --> 03:33:21.040]  hi this is former mayor and the greatest mayor mr line 11 rudy juliani and you're listening to
[03:33:21.040 --> 03:33:32.320]  roger stone on info wars and there you have the president's most effective lawyer former mayor
[03:33:32.320 --> 03:33:40.320]  rudy juliani who i think has done a superb job of getting the president off of defense and on
[03:33:40.320 --> 03:33:48.400]  offense and calling out the criminality of james comey robert moeller and the other deep state
[03:33:48.400 --> 03:33:56.480]  spooks who operate without any constitutional oversight whatsoever answering only to the traitor
[03:33:57.200 --> 03:34:05.280]  rod rozenstein mr rozenstein is the man who signed the unconstitutional faisal warrant
[03:34:05.280 --> 03:34:13.040]  that was used to spy on the trump campaign that is a crime for which mr rozenstein
[03:34:13.040 --> 03:34:22.560]  must be prosecuted this is just the beginning of an epic clash ladies and gentlemen but anyone
[03:34:22.560 --> 03:34:31.920]  who read the indictment laid out last week by mr rozenstein needs to be reminded as i was forced
[03:34:31.920 --> 03:34:41.920]  to remind chris quomo the other night on cnn an indictment is an unproven accusation by the government
[03:34:41.920 --> 03:34:51.280]  it is not an undisputed fact you can say goose for 2.0 is a russian asset as many times as you
[03:34:51.280 --> 03:34:58.080]  want to say it that does not make it a fact certified in a court of law and in fact if that
[03:34:58.080 --> 03:35:06.560]  question goes to trial the government is likely to lose i would call ray mcgovern as a witness the
[03:35:06.560 --> 03:35:16.640]  former counterintelligence it expert i'd call bill benny i'd call the experts to prove definitively
[03:35:16.640 --> 03:35:24.400]  that when rod rozenstein says that goose for 2.0 is indisputably a russian he's full of
[03:35:25.440 --> 03:35:35.600]  exactly now it is amazing how the mainstream media memies the screaming memies the vox is the
[03:35:35.600 --> 03:35:44.320]  daily beasts and the other garbage media such as raw garbage as i call them uh continue to say
[03:35:45.120 --> 03:35:54.320]  roger stones indictment in connection with the hacking of the dnc is imminent in fact some numskull
[03:35:54.320 --> 03:36:02.640]  named barbara mcquade first of all said on msnbc that i was too cheap to pay two million dollars
[03:36:02.640 --> 03:36:12.000]  to an fbi informant who tried to set me up and sell me so-called negative information on uh uh
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:21.280]  hillary clinton but now writes that i am subject to a client conspiracy indictment hey barbara
[03:36:21.280 --> 03:36:28.080]  where did you go to law school are you sure you ever passed the bar because you see to be subject
[03:36:28.080 --> 03:36:35.760]  to a client conspiracy one had to either be involved in the hacking of the dnc i wasn't
[03:36:36.320 --> 03:36:44.320]  or the dissemination of the information that was allegedly obtained i also wasn't there is no
[03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:51.440]  evidence to the contrary but i'm going to see your fat derriere in court baby because that's
[03:36:51.440 --> 03:37:01.600]  defamation where does msnbc get these morons let's take nick ackerman for example he touts
[03:37:01.600 --> 03:37:11.440]  himself as a former watergate prosecutor no he's a loudmouth a blowhard a buffoon a jackass
[03:37:11.440 --> 03:37:17.840]  he wouldn't know one end of the law from the other yet he continues to say former president
[03:37:17.840 --> 03:37:24.640]  richard nixon approved the break in in advance we've just never been able to find the proof
[03:37:24.640 --> 03:37:30.560]  no nick i just called you out you're a full fleshing phony you have no evidence of that
[03:37:30.560 --> 03:37:37.280]  it's a smear just like everything you say to me anytime nick you want to come on info wars

[03:48:16.160 --> 03:48:24.160]  be taking your calls and now a special report from alex jones followed by a special report
[03:48:24.160 --> 03:48:31.120]  from john bound i've been telling you for two years the democratic party plan announced by
[03:48:31.120 --> 03:48:37.040]  hillary just months before she lost to donald trump was to demonize info wars misrepresent
[03:48:37.040 --> 03:48:41.680]  what we've said because we're seen as the tip of the spear of americana and its re-emergence
[03:48:42.720 --> 03:48:48.320]  then use that demonization to label all other conservatives libertarians nationalist christians
[03:48:48.320 --> 03:48:55.760]  you name it and deplatform everyone from facebook twitter youtube you name it which are about 80 percent
[03:48:55.760 --> 03:49:02.720]  of the worldwide web traffic cnn announced on thursday that they had met with other so-called
[03:49:02.720 --> 03:49:07.520]  media companies and other so-called journalists and professors of journalism and we're asking
[03:49:07.520 --> 03:49:16.560]  facebook why we weren't completely banned facebook then said look we already restrict 80 percent of
[03:49:16.560 --> 03:49:20.880]  conservatives post that's the number i've told you previously because we can actually see it on
[03:49:20.880 --> 03:49:26.560]  the graph it's not just me it's everybody diamonds and silk it's 97 percent because they're so
[03:49:26.560 --> 03:49:32.800]  lovable they're so funny and they're not negative it was indirectly they're even more effective than i
[03:49:32.800 --> 03:49:41.280]  am so they're 97 percent banned thank you guys for hearing us two months ago on so you've got
[03:49:41.280 --> 03:49:49.120]  cnn the kings of fake media kicking all this off thursday covering it and then you had the
[03:49:49.120 --> 03:49:54.240]  washington post the new york times new yorker magazine all of them weigh in and say yes totally
[03:49:54.240 --> 03:50:00.000]  banned anyone that it's a conspiracy theorist that's anyone that says they're liars you know like we
[03:50:00.000 --> 03:50:04.080]  said that they give them the debate questions at cnn to hillary beforehand of course it came out in
[03:50:04.080 --> 03:50:08.240]  wiki leaks but you can see she'd been given beforehand it was all studied and ready and she
[03:50:08.240 --> 03:50:13.280]  instantly answered with a can prepared statements you can see when something's rigged i'ma didn't
[03:50:13.280 --> 03:50:17.520]  raise the fool just like i told you some of her town halls were fake i know 80 millimeter when i see
[03:50:17.520 --> 03:50:25.680]  it i know fake when i see it you know a hollywood movie because of the production quality it's so
[03:50:25.680 --> 03:50:32.720]  real it isn't real months later came out indeed it was totally fake with hired actors so they're
[03:50:32.720 --> 03:50:39.360]  mad that we're covering this and then they say we got a deplatform him well donald trump jr
[03:50:39.360 --> 03:50:44.080]  tweeted out and said really cnn is supposedly the policeman that's going to run all this
[03:50:44.960 --> 03:50:50.560]  seriously if someone is going to lead the charge against fake news shouldn't they be a lot more
[03:50:50.560 --> 03:50:56.240]  credible than cnn then they said donald trump jr endorsed info wars more deception by cnn
[03:50:57.040 --> 03:51:02.160]  when all he did was say you shouldn't be the arbiter and list what is news or what is it news
[03:51:02.160 --> 03:51:09.360]  because again even facebook said look one person's fake news or somebody else's news the media's in
[03:51:09.360 --> 03:51:14.560]  a war the liberals put out fake news conservatives put out fake news but then they added but don't
[03:51:14.560 --> 03:51:22.480]  worry info wars posts are dialed back 80% they went on to say really actually it's more than that
[03:51:22.480 --> 03:51:27.760]  only if you go to the page do you see it we don't let people share it and if they do we
[03:51:27.760 --> 03:51:35.040]  penalize them which is social engineering so the censorship here and the smarter corrupt tech giants
[03:51:35.040 --> 03:51:41.280]  like google and facebook are in the news saying shut up this is racketeering we're involved in
[03:51:41.280 --> 03:51:48.480]  in fact i am quite frankly pinching myself thinking maybe this is virtual reality like total recall
[03:51:48.480 --> 03:51:53.920]  and i'm just playing some video game or you know i'm the hero fighting the evil you genesis globalist
[03:51:53.920 --> 03:51:58.400]  who are trying to censor everybody and poisoning the water with fluoride but then it's all real
[03:51:58.400 --> 03:52:24.480]  and it's really happening sasha barron cohen has always been a controversial enigma supported by
[03:52:24.480 --> 03:52:30.160]  those opposed to the establishment via his injection of himself into the geopolitical narrative
[03:52:30.160 --> 03:52:37.280]  with his parade of characters intended to disrupt the hypocrisy eccentric and with unlimited oil
[03:52:37.280 --> 03:52:54.160]  wealth he recently hosted his own olympic games now cohen has become the hypocrisy much appreciation
[03:52:54.160 --> 03:53:00.720]  for how you've always spoken out on behalf of veterans what led you to believe that you were
[03:53:00.720 --> 03:53:06.080]  going to talk about that with the person that was going to interview you well it was proposed to me
[03:53:06.080 --> 03:53:11.280]  as a legitimate interview to speak about veterans issues in our military and current events to a
[03:53:11.280 --> 03:53:17.200]  new audience it just it just got worse and worse and worse as the minutes went on in this bizarre
[03:53:17.200 --> 03:53:24.400]  i'm really embarrassing humiliating interview that you know it it mocked middle-class americans it
[03:53:24.400 --> 03:53:32.240]  mocked our values it it mocked the disabled and it it just got worse and worse and and you know
[03:53:32.240 --> 03:53:38.880]  it was occurring to me whatever this show is whatever this interview really is is all about
[03:53:38.880 --> 03:53:47.200]  humiliation and devaluing middle-class americans whom i represent so yeah i i said enough was enough
[03:53:47.200 --> 03:53:53.200]  and i took off my mic and i walked out from an info wars mock style site cohen responded
[03:53:53.200 --> 03:54:01.680]  as his new alter ego i am dr billy wane rudick founder ceo accountant of truth brary dot org
[03:54:01.680 --> 03:54:09.040]  and it was i that interviewed you rudick writes if they tune in well the ill gotten gains by cbs
[03:54:09.040 --> 03:54:17.360]  and showtime those i say need to be donated to people who deserve the gains rudick asked palin
[03:54:17.360 --> 03:54:23.680]  so why hunt a fine citizen journalist like myself i demand an apology cohen has dumped his
[03:54:23.680 --> 03:54:30.320]  waning career and a percentage of his fans to join a roster of info wars mock site clones
[03:54:30.320 --> 03:54:34.560]  that eventually end up in the trash dump of history you're a god posing like you're like
[03:54:34.560 --> 03:54:38.800]  a journalist and i you're you're a want to be a comedian it's all right who are we describing
[03:54:38.800 --> 03:54:42.880]  i'm talking about you oh sorry yeah so so so are you basically after pretending to be a journalist
[03:54:42.880 --> 03:54:46.880]  is yes yes yes that's right you're an actor pretending to be a journalist pretending to
[03:54:46.880 --> 03:54:50.480]  be a comedian i mean so they're confused your audience like you're a new show i don't think
[03:54:50.480 --> 03:54:54.160]  i don't think a person putting on a big perform to show i'm claiming to be a journalist we can't
[03:54:54.160 --> 03:54:58.080]  watch him following oh yeah really but this is all about being snarky the whole point is your
[03:54:58.080 --> 03:55:02.560]  fake news and that's why you're falling apart so keep misrepresenting the thinking people in this
[03:55:02.560 --> 03:55:07.440]  country know what's going on it was trying to feed me like a hamster if you were the real
[03:55:07.440 --> 03:55:11.680]  house jones i would eat that pill okay i'm just not sure the reason you're the real house judge
[03:55:11.680 --> 03:55:15.120]  i'm not sure about it i'm not sure like an animatronic robot from checke cheese
[03:55:16.720 --> 03:55:24.640]  expectantly cohen will insult real americans and real american values values increasingly foreign
[03:55:24.640 --> 03:55:30.560]  to a far left and chinese-owned hollywood this could possibly result in the conclusion that
[03:55:30.560 --> 03:55:37.600]  cohen will no longer be allowed to set foot again in the united states
[03:55:37.600 --> 03:55:48.000]  the greatest country in the world all other countries are run by little girls
[03:55:48.560 --> 03:55:55.520]  well my idea is to come out with just like these ice cream gloves that make the ice cream not go
[03:55:55.520 --> 03:56:02.640]  on your hands and make it all well sticky and also keep your hands warm okay when when you is eating
[03:56:02.640 --> 03:56:07.520]  the ice cream okay is you win or is you win okay well it sounds like a good idea and i hope you
[03:56:07.520 --> 03:56:11.680]  make a lot of money good luck folks it's been nice seeing you you take care of yourself okay
[03:56:11.680 --> 03:56:16.720]  yes you're going to have a couple of jokes about donald trump which i'm not going to spoil um well
[03:56:16.720 --> 03:56:25.040]  it's a fairy tale ending so donald trump contracts hiv at the end many may initially tune in to witness
[03:56:25.040 --> 03:56:31.120]  the outrage but ultimately cohen's audience is the far left bubble of hollywood and what remains of
[03:56:31.120 --> 03:56:38.080]  msnbc and cnn's audience dying mediate dinosaurs ridiculing the very people who fought and died
[03:56:38.080 --> 03:56:44.560]  for their freedoms and inherent success if i could give you a purple heart i would you deserve one
[03:56:45.840 --> 03:56:51.520]  this has been an attack on you in a way to attack mr muller and the investigation that is to get at
[03:56:51.520 --> 03:56:58.320]  russia collusion involved in our election that hearing today was 10 hours of travesty mockery
[03:56:58.320 --> 03:57:03.520]  but travesty wrapped in a sham wrapped in a mockery not my word but it fits yet the angry
[03:57:03.520 --> 03:57:08.000]  republicans who didn't make the case that bias tainted the probe the high dudgeon democrats
[03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:14.160]  who have contempt for the other side frankly cohen is nothing less than an entitled englishman
[03:57:14.160 --> 03:57:20.320]  jealous of the fortitude of the american people while his hometown of hammersmith london england
[03:57:20.320 --> 03:57:27.440]  swiftly becomes a sharia law no go zone and is the pitiful hypocrisy in all of this john
