[00:30.000 --> 00:36.800]  Well, Info Wars is born for this, the battle for the Republic, the United States totally
[00:36.800 --> 00:39.000]  surrounded fighting for its life.
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.720]  I've been on there 26 plus years, for the moment we're now living in, and I can tell
[00:44.720 --> 00:48.920]  you as bad as it is, we're going to come through this stronger on the other side no matter
[00:48.920 --> 00:51.840]  what happens to Trump.
[00:51.840 --> 00:58.760]  But I'd wish that we could bypass what's coming, I wish we could have gone around this, wish
[00:58.760 --> 01:03.720]  we could have had an easy landing and kept Trump, and there's still 20% chance of doing
[01:03.720 --> 01:08.240]  that, there's about 100% chance of doing that if Trump takes dramatic action.
[01:08.240 --> 01:15.960]  Now my brain is so on fire, and I brainstormed so hard this morning, from about 6am to about
[01:15.960 --> 01:25.400]  12 noon when I got to the office, that I got completely exhausted about an hour and a half
[01:25.400 --> 01:29.720]  ago and had to go take a nap, because I had smoke coming out of my ears, I mean I have
[01:29.720 --> 01:34.920]  war game to every angle, I know exactly what they're going to pull next, I know what their
[01:34.920 --> 01:41.080]  next move is, and it's not bragging, it's well known that I have this large map of the
[01:41.080 --> 01:46.600]  operation in my head, and it doesn't make me have a power trip to have the White House
[01:46.600 --> 01:50.680]  calling up asking what they think they should do, and to have the Democrats watching everything
[01:50.680 --> 01:55.920]  we say, it actually scares the living hell out of me, because that's the thing, these
[01:55.920 --> 02:00.640]  globalists don't think two or three steps ahead, they think two or three steps ahead
[02:00.640 --> 02:06.600]  about what they want and power they want, but not about the big picture, and so I'm
[02:06.600 --> 02:10.360]  not going to stop, I'm not going to quit, I'm not going to give up, but I got to be honest
[02:10.360 --> 02:16.920]  with you, to watch the American people reject a really great president like President Trump,
[02:16.920 --> 02:22.120]  and to watch the corporate media reject a president, I mean he won the election clearly,
[02:22.120 --> 02:28.400]  buy a landslide and they stole it so far, but still it should be 95% of America rejecting
[02:28.400 --> 02:41.000]  this, it shouldn't be 50%, because a good 20% didn't vote, and so that means even if
[02:41.000 --> 02:51.280]  we won, what, 47% voted, it should have been basically almost everybody getting this understanding.
[02:51.280 --> 02:55.480]  I've looked at Biden's policies and he means to, the one area he's been honest is what
[02:55.480 --> 02:58.960]  he's going to carry out, because he says all that knowing his constituents are idiots
[02:58.960 --> 03:03.840]  and he knows they'll follow orders, and the Chi Coms know he needs to say what he's going
[03:03.840 --> 03:10.080]  to do, his ending of fossil fuels would starve the whole planet, his shutting down a fracking
[03:10.080 --> 03:15.640]  would cause a depression, his shutting down the coal power plants would destroy the country,
[03:15.640 --> 03:22.520]  and then bringing back Obamacare and getting rid of companies being able to match 401Ks
[03:22.520 --> 03:30.880]  will end 401Ks, I mean, I could go for hours, it's so horrible that I spend hours and hours
[03:30.880 --> 03:37.120]  a week reading his policies, and it's so horrible I get a headache and get dizzy, because it's
[03:37.120 --> 03:45.240]  so bad, it's like I promise to cut your legs off and stab you in the head, oh, I want that,
[03:45.240 --> 03:48.960]  and then to get the young people to vote for them, oh, and free healthcare and free education
[03:48.960 --> 03:58.640]  and free cars and a guaranteed universal income, none of it's true, now we have total evidence
[03:58.640 --> 04:04.720]  of election fraud coming out all across the country, and we have the media blackout on
[04:04.720 --> 04:08.280]  that and the internet censorship, which we knew would come with this overthrow of Trump
[04:08.280 --> 04:14.200]  and our populist movement, and I can sit there and count coup all day and bitch about Trump
[04:14.200 --> 04:18.800]  and say oh, we told you so old man, you didn't stop all the censorship, so now you're in
[04:18.800 --> 04:23.040]  trouble, now that doesn't do anything, that's like cutting your nose off, spot your face,
[04:23.040 --> 04:27.960]  I'm just going to move on from that, though we should point out to Republicans and the
[04:27.960 --> 04:33.200]  populist in the future they should fight back, but that's like fighting the last war instead
[04:33.200 --> 04:36.360]  of fighting the new war, I'm going to tell you what's coming next, the head of the British
[04:36.360 --> 04:43.280]  military gets it, the UK, says global World War III, worldwide depression, economic collapse,
[04:43.280 --> 04:47.240]  collapse of the third world hell on earth is coming within a few months if the next
[04:47.240 --> 04:52.280]  lockdown happens, and Joe Biden and the UN and the EU have all announced it, there's
[04:52.280 --> 05:17.560]  one country won't be locked down, and that's our boss, Chi-Com China.
[05:17.560 --> 05:22.920]  Lady competitors have 3-5%, the things the numeric does, I don't have to tell you,
[05:22.920 --> 05:25.440]  This is the highest quality, the strongest you're gonna find.
[05:25.440 --> 05:27.400]  So both these are amazing products
[05:27.400 --> 05:30.440]  and they fund the InfoWare, which is a 360 win.
[05:30.440 --> 05:32.840]  On top of it, despite the fact they're in demand,
[05:32.840 --> 05:34.120]  they've been sold out for months,
[05:34.120 --> 05:38.440]  they're both 50% off, triple Patriot points,
[05:38.440 --> 05:41.200]  and free shipping at infowarstore.com.
[05:41.200 --> 05:44.280]  That's bio, true selenium, from the mustard seed,
[05:44.280 --> 05:46.800]  it's amazing, and on top of it,
[05:46.800 --> 05:49.200]  we also have bodies, ultimate turmeric formula
[05:49.200 --> 05:51.280]  at infowarstore.com.
[05:51.280 --> 05:53.200]  This cell will not last long,
[05:53.200 --> 05:54.320]  but thank you all for your support,
[05:54.320 --> 05:55.720]  and really, to try these products.

[05:56.600 --> 05:57.800]  because they really, really work.
[05:57.800 --> 05:59.680]  InfoWareStore.com.
[05:59.680 --> 06:11.920]  The year is 2020.
[06:11.920 --> 06:14.760]  The day is Sunday, November 8th.
[06:14.760 --> 06:17.280]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[06:17.280 --> 06:19.760]  you are the resistance.
[06:19.760 --> 06:23.040]  Live from the InfoWare.com studios,
[06:23.040 --> 06:25.040]  it's Alex Jones.
[06:38.040 --> 06:40.240]  Well, this morning, I talked to my oldest daughter
[06:40.240 --> 06:41.520]  and my wife at breakfast,
[06:41.520 --> 06:43.920]  while my three-year-old daughter played
[06:43.920 --> 06:46.040]  toy cars and blocks on the floor,
[06:46.040 --> 06:48.720]  and I prepared them both for what was happening.
[06:48.720 --> 06:51.000]  Both my wife and my oldest daughter
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.440]  finished my sentences before I could even complete them,
[06:54.440 --> 06:55.400]  and they looked at me, and they said,
[06:55.400 --> 06:59.840]  we know you're right, and we're ready, and we understand.
[06:59.840 --> 07:03.520]  And it was a very good feeling, a feeling of strength,
[07:03.520 --> 07:04.800]  because they weren't repeating things
[07:04.800 --> 07:06.480]  that had been drilled into their head.
[07:06.480 --> 07:08.560]  I'd never really pushed these things on them,
[07:08.560 --> 07:10.280]  but they'd been listening, and they'd been checking,
[07:10.280 --> 07:11.360]  and they knew the truth.
[07:11.360 --> 07:12.680]  My oldest daughter, Charlotte, looked at me,
[07:12.680 --> 07:16.400]  and she said, Dad, you're almost always right.
[07:16.400 --> 07:18.800]  A little tear came out of her eye,
[07:18.800 --> 07:21.240]  and that meant so much to me
[07:21.240 --> 07:23.360]  when I gave them this speech at the breakfast table
[07:23.360 --> 07:27.680]  at 8 a.m. this morning, and I laid out the future.
[07:27.680 --> 07:30.080]  I told them we tried to stop what was coming.
[07:30.080 --> 07:32.880]  I told them what was coming next, and they understood,
[07:32.880 --> 07:35.160]  and they began to tell me things I hadn't even thought of
[07:35.160 --> 07:36.000]  that were dead on.
[07:37.760 --> 07:39.920]  And so this is gonna be a lot easier now,
[07:41.240 --> 07:44.080]  because the enemy's gonna be right out in the open.
[07:44.080 --> 07:47.240]  But for all the yuppies and all the trendies
[07:47.240 --> 07:49.280]  and all those that have signed on to Satan,
[07:50.400 --> 07:51.880]  as things get worse and worse,
[07:51.880 --> 07:54.440]  they will only submit more and more,
[07:54.440 --> 07:56.680]  hoping that things get better
[07:56.680 --> 07:58.520]  if they just give up all their rights
[07:58.520 --> 08:01.640]  and try to force us to submit to them.
[08:01.640 --> 08:03.640]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[08:03.640 --> 08:05.880]  It is Sunday, November 8th, the year is 2020.
[08:05.880 --> 08:12.880]  And I come to you under blood red skies and under true crisis.
[08:15.520 --> 08:19.480]  I have in front of me no less than conservatively,
[08:19.480 --> 08:20.920]  because I counted them up this afternoon,
[08:20.920 --> 08:25.920]  300 different articles with election officials,
[08:25.920 --> 08:30.920]  postal service workers, lawyers, law enforcement,
[08:30.920 --> 08:35.920]  confirming total, systematic, absolute, complete fraud
[08:36.240 --> 08:38.520]  in the five key battleground states were told
[08:38.520 --> 08:39.840]  that President Trump is lost.
[08:41.880 --> 08:44.480]  And we can sit there and talk about those issues all day,
[08:44.480 --> 08:47.480]  but the system put in their censorship,
[08:47.480 --> 08:51.200]  put in their control, and now the president gives a speech,
[08:51.200 --> 08:55.960]  or when Rudolf Giuliani gives a speech,
[08:55.960 --> 08:59.040]  or when Corey Lewandowski gives a speech,
[08:59.040 --> 09:02.040]  the only place it is is infowars.com
[09:02.040 --> 09:03.720]  and right side broadcasting.
[09:04.720 --> 09:07.680]  The other's patriot sites don't even really have
[09:07.680 --> 09:11.760]  live coverage, and so we have our audiences and that's it.
[09:11.760 --> 09:14.200]  Now, as things get serious,
[09:14.200 --> 09:17.200]  we have more viewers yesterday and today per hour,
[09:17.200 --> 09:20.040]  over a million people on the audio and video streams
[09:20.040 --> 09:24.040]  than we did during election day, but you'd expect that.
[09:24.040 --> 09:26.040]  I told you, Trump was gonna win,
[09:26.040 --> 09:28.040]  but they'd freeze the stand-up.
[09:28.040 --> 09:30.800]  Freeze the states and bring in mail-in ballots,
[09:30.800 --> 09:35.120]  because Democrats said, it's a red mirage,
[09:35.120 --> 09:36.920]  he'll look like he won that day,
[09:36.920 --> 09:38.160]  we're gonna freeze the voting,
[09:38.160 --> 09:39.920]  and then we're gonna count the ballots that came in
[09:39.920 --> 09:43.480]  and Trump will lose, and Pelosi said he will lose.
[09:43.480 --> 09:45.920]  She said, we'll do whatever we do on
[09:45.920 --> 09:48.240]  whatever that thing is, election day,
[09:48.240 --> 09:51.120]  and then by inauguration, he'll be the president.
[09:53.680 --> 09:55.160]  You know, Google has a big article
[09:55.160 --> 09:57.160]  that's up on infowars.com,
[09:57.160 --> 10:01.520]  Google Analytics, and they had a record search
[10:01.520 --> 10:04.240]  in the days before the election,
[10:04.240 --> 10:07.440]  and the days after the election that no one ever searches.
[10:09.160 --> 10:12.360]  What is the penalty was one of the searches,
[10:12.360 --> 10:15.640]  and what is the consequences, and what is the prison time,
[10:15.640 --> 10:17.840]  and what is the jail time, these are searches
[10:17.840 --> 10:22.520]  no one's ever done, but now it was by the thousands
[10:22.520 --> 10:27.520]  per state in Pennsylvania, in Georgia, in Minnesota,
[10:28.480 --> 10:31.160]  in Wisconsin, in Michigan.
[10:34.720 --> 10:38.080]  The search was for what is the consequences,
[10:38.080 --> 10:40.720]  what is the penalty, what is the prison time
[10:40.720 --> 10:42.000]  for election fraud.
[10:43.440 --> 10:46.000]  Wow, because that's election officials in fraud,
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.000]  not voter fraud.
[10:50.240 --> 10:52.320]  There it is, scroll up, Google trends searches
[10:52.320 --> 10:54.960]  for election fraud punishment surge
[10:54.960 --> 10:56.760]  in the key battleground states.
[10:56.760 --> 10:58.560]  It's not just those, more's come out.
[10:59.840 --> 11:02.560]  That is people checking to see
[11:02.560 --> 11:03.920]  what's gonna happen to them.
[11:06.280 --> 11:08.200]  You put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[11:11.160 --> 11:13.560]  And I've got stacks of those articles.
[11:13.560 --> 11:16.120]  Felt like a drug deal.
[11:16.120 --> 11:18.200]  Asian American ballot observer in Detroit
[11:18.200 --> 11:21.240]  describes a mysterious fan dropping off 61 boxes
[11:21.240 --> 11:23.320]  of ballots at four a.m. illegally
[11:23.320 --> 11:24.840]  after the polls had closed.
[11:26.800 --> 11:28.560]  Trying to share that on Facebook,
[11:28.560 --> 11:30.800]  you're banned in two seconds flat.
[11:30.800 --> 11:33.720]  You see, Trump now has had his legs cut out from under him.
[11:33.720 --> 11:36.240]  They'll let Lou Dobbs defend him on Fox Business
[11:37.320 --> 11:40.280]  with very small viewership compared to Fox.
[11:42.880 --> 11:46.440]  But none of it's on Fox, it's all Trump needs to concede,
[11:46.440 --> 11:48.840]  George W. Bush need to concede,
[11:48.840 --> 11:50.360]  and when I come back from break,
[11:50.360 --> 11:53.440]  I'm gonna explain what they're saying to the president
[11:53.440 --> 11:55.920]  inside the White House right now,
[11:55.920 --> 11:57.200]  and how they're trying to get him conceded.
[11:57.200 --> 11:58.920]  But let me just say this right now.
[12:01.800 --> 12:06.320]  If Trump concedes, they're gonna blame him
[12:06.320 --> 12:09.600]  for the COVID-19 deaths, they're gonna set up
[12:09.600 --> 12:11.280]  a truth and reconciliation commission
[12:11.280 --> 12:13.080]  to demonize all of his supporters,
[12:13.080 --> 12:15.480]  and they're gonna make the lock down
[12:15.480 --> 12:17.920]  and the shutdown of our economy 10 times worse
[12:17.920 --> 12:19.640]  and now Biden's announced that.
[12:19.640 --> 12:21.000]  All these conservatives are like,
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.400]  well, Alex, I saw my neighbor yesterday, he goes,
[12:27.200 --> 12:31.040]  he goes, Alex, he goes, at least,
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.160]  at least they'll turn the economy back on.
[12:37.160 --> 12:39.440]  And I said, no, they're not going to.
[12:39.440 --> 12:41.200]  And I showed him on my phone
[12:41.200 --> 12:43.920]  where Biden's new commission says it'll never open,
[12:43.920 --> 12:46.560]  ever, ever, ever.
[12:46.560 --> 12:51.000]  You think these control freaks are ever gonna turn loose
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.360]  once this dog has you and its jaws?
[12:53.360 --> 12:56.880]  Once this great white shark's got you in its mouth, come on.
[12:56.880 --> 12:58.800]  Oh, Joe Biden wants peace and love
[12:58.800 --> 13:00.440]  and wants us all to heal.
[13:00.440 --> 13:01.840]  Everything he says is a lie.
[13:01.840 --> 13:04.840]  He said, I wanna ban all fossil fuels
[13:04.840 --> 13:07.080]  and all fracking on all these videos.
[13:07.080 --> 13:08.240]  And then Trump says, you wanna ban it?
[13:08.240 --> 13:10.320]  He goes, I never said that, you're a liar,
[13:10.320 --> 13:12.400]  even though it's all on video.
[13:12.400 --> 13:13.720]  He said, I'll never take your guns.
[13:13.720 --> 13:17.920]  Now he says, I wanna ban all guns.
[13:17.920 --> 13:19.240]  But when it comes to following orders
[13:19.240 --> 13:22.000]  from the UN and Bill Gates and the Chai Coms,
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.840]  he 100% follows those orders.
[13:23.840 --> 13:25.720]  And I've got what he's released
[13:25.720 --> 13:27.840]  and what he says starts Monday.
[13:27.840 --> 13:29.520]  They'll be announcing by Tuesday
[13:30.560 --> 13:31.840]  the way to drive Trump from office.
[13:31.840 --> 13:34.160]  It's gonna work just like this.
[13:34.160 --> 13:35.560]  I'll cover it next segment.
[13:36.720 --> 13:38.360]  Trump got all those people killed.
[13:38.360 --> 13:43.360]  He needs to be removed by the 25th Amendment by his cabinet,
[13:45.120 --> 13:47.480]  70-something days before he's supposed to go.
[13:48.520 --> 13:52.040]  If he doesn't agree to implement contact tracers,
[13:52.040 --> 13:56.000]  checkpoints, endless lockdowns, national mask mandate,
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.880]  and they'll say to Trump, if you approve this,
[13:58.880 --> 14:01.640]  we will say it's not your fault COVID,
[14:01.640 --> 14:02.680]  which wasn't his fault.
[14:02.680 --> 14:06.360]  It was the Chai Coms, the EU, the UN, Bill Gates,
[14:06.360 --> 14:10.160]  Fauci, the Wuan lab, that all came out.
[14:10.160 --> 14:12.600]  And if Trump does that and makes a deal,
[14:12.600 --> 14:15.400]  they'll break that deal before he's even gone.
[14:15.400 --> 14:17.240]  The minute he comes out and says, fine,
[14:17.240 --> 14:18.960]  I'll implement your next lockdown.
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.800]  And he sues for peace.
[14:21.800 --> 14:22.880]  They're not gonna give him Trump peace.
[14:22.880 --> 14:26.440]  They wanna destroy him and imprison him
[14:26.440 --> 14:29.040]  in front of the world to discredit his supporters
[14:29.040 --> 14:31.160]  and to basically make us bow down.
[14:31.160 --> 14:32.520]  But we cannot do that.
[14:34.040 --> 14:36.240]  I've already been through this with,
[14:36.240 --> 14:37.520]  I've said billions of things,
[14:37.520 --> 14:38.920]  and they take a few things out of context
[14:38.920 --> 14:39.960]  and say it's my identity,
[14:39.960 --> 14:42.160]  and say, Jones lives off this,
[14:42.160 --> 14:44.040]  Jones' identity is Sandy Hook,
[14:44.040 --> 14:45.200]  Jones' money comes,
[14:45.200 --> 14:46.880]  I barely even ever talked about Sandy Hook.
[14:46.880 --> 14:48.240]  And they're always like, don't let him on air,
[14:48.240 --> 14:49.440]  he's gonna say no kids died,
[14:49.440 --> 14:51.840]  he's gonna harass the children, all made up.
[14:52.920 --> 14:55.440]  Well, they say, well, Trump, oh, he's a COVID-19 guy,
[14:55.440 --> 14:57.560]  it's the Trump virus.
[14:57.560 --> 14:59.320]  And then they're gonna use that every election
[14:59.320 --> 15:00.880]  to shut the economy back down
[15:00.880 --> 15:02.680]  and decide what businesses can operate.
[15:02.680 --> 15:05.360]  And the businesses will all dutifully stay shut down.
[15:05.360 --> 15:08.960]  And now Joe Biden and Rahm Emanuel have come out and said,
[15:09.800 --> 15:14.000]  learn to code, you're never gonna have a small business again,
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.880]  only big corporations are allowed to stay open.
[15:16.880 --> 15:18.880]  And the big corporations have unlimited financing,
[15:18.880 --> 15:20.400]  they'll do the social distancing
[15:20.400 --> 15:22.840]  and the lockdowns for years.
[15:22.840 --> 15:24.560]  Until you're all out of business
[15:24.560 --> 15:25.840]  and then they'll turn back on
[15:25.840 --> 15:27.240]  and they're the only service economy.
[15:27.240 --> 15:29.080]  But to go to them, you've gotta have an app
[15:29.080 --> 15:32.000]  with a phone, with a tracker system for a grocery store,
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.800]  a restaurant, a movie theater, they admit all this.
[15:34.800 --> 15:37.400]  It's the social credit score, AI takeover.
[15:38.920 --> 15:40.160]  And the British Ministry of Defense
[15:40.160 --> 15:41.760]  has now come out and admitted that
[15:41.760 --> 15:43.720]  and said this is part of a robot takeover.
[15:43.720 --> 15:45.720]  I've got the article right here,
[15:45.720 --> 15:47.960]  but I'm not gonna just tell you what's coming next.
[15:47.960 --> 15:49.640]  I'm gonna tell you how to stop it.
[15:50.680 --> 15:52.800]  I'm gonna tell you how to stop it straight ahead.
[15:52.800 --> 15:55.480]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[15:58.080 --> 16:00.560]  The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces
[16:00.560 --> 16:03.520]  for any big corporation or government that'll pay them.
[16:03.520 --> 16:04.800]  It's that simple, and they'd use
[16:04.800 --> 16:07.760]  our open free society against us.
[16:07.760 --> 16:09.000]  The controlled media will talk about
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.720]  a few mistakes I've made over the years
[16:10.720 --> 16:12.440]  and obsess over it and say see,
[16:12.440 --> 16:13.720]  he's a liar on purpose,
[16:13.720 --> 16:16.280]  even though our success rate, our accuracy rate,
[16:16.280 --> 16:17.760]  is way, way better than theirs.
[16:17.760 --> 16:19.600]  We try to tell the truth.
[16:19.600 --> 16:21.840]  They try to lie, they try to deceive.
[16:21.840 --> 16:23.280]  I'm trying to get people,
[16:23.280 --> 16:24.240]  career loss of the globalist,
[16:24.240 --> 16:25.920]  to operate and how they manipulate,
[16:25.920 --> 16:28.640]  how they, they have boozled the public.
[16:28.640 --> 16:31.560]  I'm trying to get the public to ask the questions
[16:31.560 --> 16:33.640]  and to not believe what they're told in the face.
[16:33.640 --> 16:38.320]  I'm trying to get people to research for themselves.
[16:38.320 --> 16:40.120]  The globalists and their controlled corporate press
[16:40.120 --> 16:43.200]  say that researching and not trusting media
[16:43.200 --> 16:45.480]  is evil and is a conspiracy theory.
[16:45.480 --> 16:48.560]  But again, on its face, that is a fraud.
[16:48.560 --> 16:50.880]  Question everything, question info wars.
[16:50.880 --> 16:52.760]  Add your own research to it and then decide
[16:52.760 --> 16:54.280]  what you're gonna promote to others
[16:54.280 --> 16:56.000]  and what new sources are accurate.
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.400]  I believe info wars is the best source out there.
[16:58.400 --> 17:01.400]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms
[17:01.400 --> 17:04.360]  of civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[17:04.360 --> 17:05.640]  One is born of Renaissance,
[17:05.640 --> 17:07.440]  the other is born of conquest.
[17:07.440 --> 17:10.120]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened,
[17:10.120 --> 17:13.280]  focused people with an ethos and a culture
[17:13.280 --> 17:16.600]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[17:16.600 --> 17:19.240]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves
[17:19.240 --> 17:22.920]  it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[17:22.920 --> 17:25.600]  America is transferring out of a system
[17:25.600 --> 17:27.800]  based on the ethos of liberty and freedom
[17:27.800 --> 17:31.040]  into one of total mass high tech slavery.
[17:31.040 --> 17:32.760]  That's why the globalists tell us America
[17:32.760 --> 17:34.640]  was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[17:34.640 --> 17:36.360]  They point out one of our evils
[17:36.360 --> 17:37.760]  so they can invert the facts that they
[17:37.760 --> 17:39.480]  are truly the slave masters.
[17:39.480 --> 17:41.840]  A global permanent lockdown is here
[17:41.840 --> 17:43.480]  that is already causing millions and millions
[17:43.480 --> 17:44.600]  to starve to death.
[17:44.600 --> 17:46.760]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[17:46.760 --> 17:48.720]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense
[17:48.720 --> 17:51.400]  in England and a top general have come out and said
[17:51.400 --> 17:54.640]  the COVID lockdown is gonna trigger a giant new world war.
[17:54.640 --> 17:55.480]  That's the facts.
[17:55.480 --> 17:57.720]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[17:57.720 --> 18:01.320]  DNA Force Plus, if you did one thing for your immune system,
[18:01.320 --> 18:03.320]  you would be get all the essential things.
[18:03.320 --> 18:05.640]  And that's the clean I-9, X2 or X3.
[18:05.640 --> 18:07.320]  That's the bio trucelinium.
[18:07.320 --> 18:09.120]  That is the vitamin D3.
[18:09.120 --> 18:10.520]  That is the C. That is the zinc.
[18:10.520 --> 18:12.320]  There's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential
[18:12.320 --> 18:13.160]  without them you die.
[18:13.160 --> 18:14.520]  And studies show you really need the other ones too.
[18:14.520 --> 18:15.920]  But DNA Force goes beyond that.
[18:15.920 --> 18:18.520]  It helps get all that in the cells and out the cells
[18:18.520 --> 18:21.320]  with PQQ and CoQ10, the highest quality sources
[18:21.320 --> 18:24.320]  with other ingredients that clean out the cells,
[18:24.320 --> 18:26.960]  that unclog them so all that stuff can get
[18:26.960 --> 18:29.760]  in viruses don't get in the good stuff gets in
[18:29.760 --> 18:32.160]  as the NIH website says that if you have all the proper
[18:32.160 --> 18:33.960]  things they can't replicate like they could.
[18:33.960 --> 18:36.560]  But I do this because it's essential like oxygen like water.
[18:36.560 --> 18:39.760]  DNA Force sold out for months 50% off out of the gates.
[18:39.760 --> 18:43.160]  Triple Patriot points free shipping infowarstore.com.
[18:43.160 --> 18:45.360]  DNA Force election special that's gonna have to end
[18:45.360 --> 18:46.200]  in a week.
[18:46.200 --> 18:47.360]  We've got a limited supply and it was very hard
[18:47.360 --> 18:48.560]  to get the PQQ this time.
[18:48.560 --> 18:50.160]  A lot of our stuff is can't get any more.
[18:50.160 --> 18:52.160]  A lot of our products because the supply chain is broken down.
[18:52.160 --> 18:54.760]  That's part of the global's plan infowarstore.com
[18:54.760 --> 18:57.560]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[18:57.560 --> 18:58.960]  I wanna thank you all for tuning in.
[18:58.960 --> 19:13.960]  Now it's easier than ever to have Bandot video on your iPhone.
[19:13.960 --> 19:17.560]  Simply go to Bandot video with your Safari browser.
[19:17.560 --> 19:20.760]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[19:20.760 --> 19:24.160]  When the menu comes up you simply click add to home screen.
[19:24.160 --> 19:26.560]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[19:26.560 --> 19:28.760]  I suggest Bandot video.
[19:28.760 --> 19:32.160]  You will now have Bandot video app on your home screen
[19:32.160 --> 19:34.160]  despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[19:34.160 --> 19:35.760]  The globalists think you're lazy
[19:35.760 --> 19:37.160]  but by taking a little bit of action
[19:37.160 --> 19:39.560]  you can override them, have the app
[19:39.560 --> 19:42.560]  and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[19:42.560 --> 19:45.160]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech
[19:45.160 --> 19:47.560]  and click the share buttons below on your email,
[19:47.560 --> 19:49.360]  on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[19:49.360 --> 19:54.360]  However you want, be sure and share Bandot video.
[20:19.360 --> 20:22.360]  All right, welcome back.
[20:22.360 --> 20:24.360]  Let me make some big announcements right here
[20:24.360 --> 20:26.360]  and then I'll get into all the meat potatoes,
[20:26.360 --> 20:28.360]  the actual factoids for everybody.
[20:28.360 --> 20:31.360]  You know, you'd think that when I got a lot of desperate calls
[20:31.360 --> 20:33.360]  from the White House the last few days
[20:33.360 --> 20:35.360]  it made my ego feel big.
[20:35.360 --> 20:40.360]  It made me feel pathetic that I'm one of the few people
[20:40.360 --> 20:44.360]  that has the deep knowledge of the overall globalist attack
[20:44.360 --> 20:50.360]  and that we failed in the last four years
[20:50.360 --> 20:53.360]  to actually get Trump on the exact right track
[20:53.360 --> 20:55.360]  on how to beat these people.
[20:55.360 --> 21:00.360]  Trump overrode four previous coup attempts
[21:00.360 --> 21:02.360]  but because he couldn't punish the coup plotters
[21:02.360 --> 21:05.360]  it only made their next attacks more bold.
[21:05.360 --> 21:08.360]  And if they succeed in this coup plot
[21:08.360 --> 21:11.360]  all the liberals are like calling everyone they know,
[21:11.360 --> 21:13.360]  texting everyone they know,
[21:13.360 --> 21:15.360]  they haven't talked to in years and they're saying,
[21:15.360 --> 21:18.360]  listen, we want to be friends, just stay in your houses,
[21:18.360 --> 21:23.360]  just submit, Biden's going to be nice.
[21:23.360 --> 21:25.360]  Oh, he's going to be real nice.
[21:25.360 --> 21:28.360]  America is the prize to collapse
[21:28.360 --> 21:30.360]  to then dictate our full surrender.
[21:30.360 --> 21:33.360]  Hillary was already planning to collapse the economy
[21:33.360 --> 21:35.360]  and run the COVID scam years ago.
[21:35.360 --> 21:37.360]  It was all pre-packaged, pre-prepared,
[21:37.360 --> 21:41.360]  that's been admitted, lockstep, event 201.
[21:41.360 --> 21:43.360]  But when Trump got in it kind of messed it all up
[21:43.360 --> 21:46.360]  but they still launched the attack
[21:46.360 --> 21:48.360]  and it's meant to bring us down
[21:48.360 --> 21:50.360]  so they can consolidate power and control over us.
[21:50.360 --> 21:54.360]  And you've seen big tech basically double its profits
[21:54.360 --> 21:58.360]  in just the last year under the scam.
[21:58.360 --> 22:00.360]  This is about conquering you.
[22:00.360 --> 22:03.360]  They don't want anybody that has wealth that isn't them.
[22:03.360 --> 22:06.360]  They don't want a middle class.
[22:06.360 --> 22:10.360]  The social contract is broken.
[22:10.360 --> 22:12.360]  And I drove around Austin, Texas yesterday
[22:12.360 --> 22:14.360]  and the black folks I all saw weren't flipping me off.
[22:14.360 --> 22:17.360]  They were waving and looked upset and really angry
[22:17.360 --> 22:19.360]  because they know their lives gotten better the last four years.
[22:19.360 --> 22:22.360]  But the white yuppies and some of the Hispanics
[22:22.360 --> 22:24.360]  were saying, we're going to kill you,
[22:24.360 --> 22:27.360]  you're going to prison, we have it on video, flipping us off.
[22:27.360 --> 22:30.360]  Just absolutely brainwashed,
[22:30.360 --> 22:32.360]  imagining that they worked for the system
[22:32.360 --> 22:34.360]  when they're really just useful idiots.
[22:34.360 --> 22:38.360]  But let's go ahead and lay it out right now.
[22:38.360 --> 22:43.360]  Owen Schreuer started tomorrow.
[22:43.360 --> 22:46.360]  He's going to launch a caravan that's going to leave at 5pm
[22:46.360 --> 22:48.360]  from the location we're going to announce.
[22:48.360 --> 22:50.360]  And it's going to drive to Houston and then along
[22:50.360 --> 22:56.360]  the Gulf of Mexico border through Louisiana, Mississippi
[22:56.360 --> 22:57.360]  into Florida.
[22:57.360 --> 23:01.360]  We'll turn north into Georgia and we'll go up
[23:01.360 --> 23:03.360]  through the Carolinas into Virginia
[23:03.360 --> 23:08.360]  where I will meet it in D.C. on Friday.
[23:08.360 --> 23:10.360]  And we're going to call for others to launch caravans
[23:10.360 --> 23:14.360]  around the nation, in the Midwest, in the South,
[23:14.360 --> 23:16.360]  and in the East Coast to D.C.
[23:16.360 --> 23:18.360]  Truckers are already announcing big strikes
[23:18.360 --> 23:22.360]  they're going to have take over to D.C. this next weekend.
[23:22.360 --> 23:25.360]  So don't worry, President Trump, the catalog is coming.
[23:25.360 --> 23:28.360]  If you're on the West Coast, we're going to announce
[23:28.360 --> 23:29.360]  days and times.
[23:29.360 --> 23:31.360]  We're looking for leaders to do it.
[23:31.360 --> 23:34.360]  The leaders who will show up at the big tech heads
[23:34.360 --> 23:38.360]  there outside San Francisco and protest at the real enemy
[23:38.360 --> 23:40.360]  who has shut down the communication systems
[23:40.360 --> 23:43.360]  and who helps run the death camps in communist China.
[23:43.360 --> 23:45.360]  We need Americans to show up on the West Coast
[23:45.360 --> 23:46.360]  but people are fired up.
[23:46.360 --> 23:47.360]  They're ready.
[23:47.360 --> 23:49.360]  And because all the other sites have been shut down
[23:49.360 --> 23:51.360]  in full wars, again, as record traffic,
[23:51.360 --> 23:53.360]  record people coming, looking for leadership
[23:53.360 --> 23:55.360]  and we're not going to desert you at this time,
[23:55.360 --> 23:56.360]  we're going to give you that leadership.
[23:56.360 --> 23:58.360]  I don't know what the enemy's going to do to us,
[23:58.360 --> 23:59.360]  but that's just fine.
[23:59.360 --> 24:00.360]  I'm here to take my legs.
[24:00.360 --> 24:01.360]  Part of being a man.
[24:01.360 --> 24:03.360]  In fact, I look forward to it.
[24:03.360 --> 24:06.360]  I'm not into pain, but if pain gets me where I'm going,
[24:06.360 --> 24:08.360]  I will certainly accept it and I will take it
[24:08.360 --> 24:11.360]  and it's up to God to meet out how much of this
[24:11.360 --> 24:13.360]  I've put up with, but I put my faith
[24:13.360 --> 24:16.360]  and deliver myself into the hands of Christ,
[24:16.360 --> 24:19.360]  as the good book says.
[24:19.360 --> 24:26.360]  Now, here's my message to President Trump.
[24:26.360 --> 24:28.360]  President Trump, you cannot concede
[24:28.360 --> 24:30.360]  because it's not just about you.
[24:30.360 --> 24:34.360]  There has been a systemic, organized election fraud
[24:34.360 --> 24:36.360]  in all of these key battleground states.
[24:36.360 --> 24:37.360]  They've been caught red-handed.
[24:37.360 --> 24:38.360]  It's all embedded.
[24:38.360 --> 24:40.360]  The corporate media, with no evidence,
[24:40.360 --> 24:41.360]  called you a Russian agent,
[24:41.360 --> 24:43.360]  said that you stole the election,
[24:43.360 --> 24:45.360]  spent three-plus years prosecuting a fraud,
[24:45.360 --> 24:48.360]  illegally surveilling you, and found nothing.
[24:48.360 --> 24:50.360]  Meanwhile, Biden, the Clintons, the Obamas
[24:50.360 --> 24:52.360]  are up to their eyeballs, the Russians,
[24:52.360 --> 24:56.360]  the communists, Chinese, anybody else that will pay them.
[24:56.360 --> 25:00.360]  And now you have a responsibility to stand up
[25:00.360 --> 25:02.360]  for the majority that voted for you
[25:02.360 --> 25:04.360]  and the American people that love you and support you.
[25:04.360 --> 25:06.360]  And I see you doing that.
[25:06.360 --> 25:08.360]  I know you're surrounded by career politicians
[25:08.360 --> 25:11.360]  and a lot of weak members of your family,
[25:11.360 --> 25:14.360]  other than folks like Junior,
[25:14.360 --> 25:18.360]  who want to parlay your destruction into their next job
[25:18.360 --> 25:21.360]  and who want the angel of New World Order death
[25:21.360 --> 25:23.360]  to pass over them.
[25:23.360 --> 25:26.360]  When the mere association with you will ensure
[25:26.360 --> 25:28.360]  they're going to be betrayed,
[25:28.360 --> 25:31.360]  they don't have real leadership qualities.
[25:31.360 --> 25:36.360]  If it's true that Jared came to you and asked you to concede.
[25:36.360 --> 25:39.360]  It is very disheartening and very concerning.
[25:39.360 --> 25:42.360]  I understand you need to get focused and get zinned out
[25:42.360 --> 25:44.360]  and take a break, I'm not against that,
[25:44.360 --> 25:46.360]  but to see that you're playing golf every day
[25:46.360 --> 25:48.360]  and not making statements.
[25:48.360 --> 25:51.360]  It'd be one thing if you were playing golf in the morning
[25:51.360 --> 25:54.360]  and the afternoon at the Resolute desk,
[25:54.360 --> 25:57.360]  laying out all the fraud at the Gateway Pundit
[25:57.360 --> 26:00.360]  and that Red State and the Daily Caller
[26:00.360 --> 26:03.360]  and that Breitbart and Info Wars have been doing
[26:03.360 --> 26:06.360]  and all the witnesses and the law enforcement
[26:06.360 --> 26:09.360]  and the poll watchers and the lawyers
[26:09.360 --> 26:14.360]  and your own ambassador who her vote wasn't counted
[26:14.360 --> 26:17.360]  and her dead husband's vote was sent.
[26:17.360 --> 26:22.360]  Just the orgy of just today over 300 articles I read
[26:22.360 --> 26:24.360]  and I go and check the numbers, it's true.
[26:24.360 --> 26:28.360]  I mean, 600 plus thousand votes counted
[26:28.360 --> 26:31.360]  that were all Joe Biden's in these states
[26:31.360 --> 26:35.360]  were 20,000 here, 50,000 there, 10,000 here, 6,000 there,
[26:35.360 --> 26:40.360]  totaling up to 600,000 plus ballots came in
[26:40.360 --> 26:43.360]  that were only for Joe Biden with no other Trump votes.
[26:43.360 --> 26:45.360]  That's arrogance.
[26:45.360 --> 26:47.360]  The criminal ballot box stuffers
[26:47.360 --> 26:49.360]  didn't want to mix a few real Trumps in.
[26:49.360 --> 26:54.360]  They wanted to get the bare minimum in for fraud.
[26:54.360 --> 26:59.360]  And that's what the graphs show.
[26:59.360 --> 27:05.360]  The graphs show that it's a normal organic line
[27:05.360 --> 27:08.360]  Trump's winning, they close the polls early
[27:08.360 --> 27:11.360]  and then all of a sudden a straight line goes up
[27:11.360 --> 27:14.360]  from Biden to complete the win.
[27:14.360 --> 27:17.360]  They didn't even hide it because they want to piss
[27:17.360 --> 27:19.360]  in our face and demoralize us
[27:19.360 --> 27:22.360]  and make us not want to vote the next election.
[27:22.360 --> 27:24.360]  Justice Department, okay,
[27:24.360 --> 27:27.360]  armed officers investigating fraud and ballot counting sites.
[27:27.360 --> 27:29.360]  Yeah, that's three days old, two days old.
[27:29.360 --> 27:30.360]  Now it's all confirmed.
[27:30.360 --> 27:32.360]  I'll cover it when we come back.
[27:32.360 --> 27:34.360]  And we've got so much to lay out
[27:34.360 --> 27:36.360]  and so much to break down today,
[27:36.360 --> 27:39.360]  but it is extremely powerful information.
[27:39.360 --> 27:43.360]  But it doesn't matter because on Facebook,
[27:43.360 --> 27:47.360]  on Twitter, on YouTube, they're blocking all of it.
[27:47.360 --> 27:50.360]  As soon as something goes viral, they block it.
[27:50.360 --> 27:52.360]  They're blocking Fox News clips,
[27:52.360 --> 27:54.360]  they're blocking C-SPAN clips,
[27:54.360 --> 27:56.360]  they're blocking Giuliani speaking
[27:56.360 --> 27:58.360]  because this is their move.
[27:58.360 --> 28:03.360]  They got caught in all those other previous frauds.
[28:03.360 --> 28:05.360]  And now they don't know what to do.
[28:05.360 --> 28:07.360]  And so they waited the election,
[28:07.360 --> 28:09.360]  were plausible in liability,
[28:09.360 --> 28:12.360]  and they launched this whole operation.
[28:12.360 --> 28:14.360]  The question is, what are we going to do?
[28:14.360 --> 28:18.360]  Well, if Trump concedes,
[28:18.360 --> 28:22.360]  they will always demonize him.
[28:22.360 --> 28:24.360]  They will, go ahead and scroll down.
[28:24.360 --> 28:25.360]  This means scroll down.
[28:25.360 --> 28:26.360]  Yeah, go ahead.
[28:26.360 --> 28:27.360]  Go ahead and scroll down.
[28:27.360 --> 28:28.360]  Show TV viewers.
[28:28.360 --> 28:29.360]  Yeah, there you go.
[28:29.360 --> 28:31.360]  You see those, those are real graphs.
[28:31.360 --> 28:34.360]  Perfect straight ups until they go above Trump.
[28:34.360 --> 28:37.360]  I mean, it happened in Michigan.
[28:37.360 --> 28:39.360]  It happened in Wisconsin.
[28:39.360 --> 28:40.360]  It happened in Georgia.
[28:40.360 --> 28:41.360]  It happened in Pennsylvania.
[28:41.360 --> 28:43.360]  I mean, folks, the exact same graph,
[28:43.360 --> 28:46.360]  the exact same fraudulent voting machine company
[28:46.360 --> 28:48.360]  owned by George Soros, it turns out,
[28:48.360 --> 28:50.360]  and the Bush's car law group,
[28:50.360 --> 28:51.360]  it's all coming off of Alan's show.
[28:51.360 --> 28:54.360]  So everybody you know, tune in now to infowars.com.
[28:54.360 --> 28:58.360]  We're still on air bigger than ever at infowars.com.
[28:58.360 --> 29:00.360]  I get asked all the time by listeners
[29:00.360 --> 29:01.360]  and by the media,
[29:01.360 --> 29:03.360]  what am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[29:03.360 --> 29:05.360]  And it's the fact that info wars
[29:05.360 --> 29:08.360]  more than 25 years ago doing basic research
[29:08.360 --> 29:10.360]  with what the club of Rome and the CFR
[29:10.360 --> 29:13.360]  and others were actually saying developed the hypothesis
[29:13.360 --> 29:15.360]  that the communist China had been set up
[29:15.360 --> 29:17.360]  to take our jobs and transfer them to China
[29:17.360 --> 29:19.360]  and then make us economically destitute
[29:19.360 --> 29:21.360]  and position us into debt.
[29:21.360 --> 29:22.360]  Well, now China owns the debt,
[29:22.360 --> 29:24.360]  now China owns Hollywood,
[29:24.360 --> 29:26.360]  all the one side of trading deals.
[29:26.360 --> 29:28.360]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on,
[29:28.360 --> 29:30.360]  but again, it wasn't that hard
[29:30.360 --> 29:32.360]  the CFR and others admitted what they were doing,
[29:32.360 --> 29:36.360]  but still others didn't want to focus on that issue.
[29:36.360 --> 29:38.360]  We did and you focused on it
[29:38.360 --> 29:40.360]  by supporting us at infowars.
[29:40.360 --> 29:42.360]  So when you go to infowars.com
[29:42.360 --> 29:45.360]  and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films,
[29:45.360 --> 29:47.360]  water filtration, air filtration, all of it,
[29:47.360 --> 29:49.360]  you're funding the organization that literally
[29:49.360 --> 29:51.360]  helped make up the world what's really happening.
[29:51.360 --> 29:53.360]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[29:53.360 --> 29:55.360]  I want to thank you for your support.
[29:58.360 --> 30:00.360]  Look it up for yourself.
[30:00.360 --> 30:02.360]  The head of the Davos Group issued a report
[30:02.360 --> 30:04.360]  more than six months ago calling for
[30:04.360 --> 30:07.360]  world government to be openly established
[30:07.360 --> 30:09.360]  to respond to COVID-19.
[30:09.360 --> 30:11.360]  The COVID-19 was a blessing to lower
[30:11.360 --> 30:13.360]  the planet's carbon footprint.
[30:13.360 --> 30:16.360]  Since then, Prince Charles and countless others
[30:16.360 --> 30:19.360]  have come out and said the exact same thing.
[30:19.360 --> 30:24.360]  The most ancient form of total war is called siege.
[30:24.360 --> 30:27.360]  And that's when you cut people off from their resources.
[30:27.360 --> 30:29.360]  That's when you lock them down.
[30:29.360 --> 30:31.360]  And this isn't siege to make us
[30:31.360 --> 30:33.360]  capitulate to the globalist or just get rid of Donald Trump.
[30:33.360 --> 30:34.360]  That's only part of it.
[30:34.360 --> 30:36.360]  This is siege to literally train us
[30:36.360 --> 30:38.360]  to be poor and to get us into deep debt.
[30:38.360 --> 30:41.360]  So then the globalist social engineers
[30:41.360 --> 30:43.360]  can dictate how we live our lives
[30:43.360 --> 30:46.360]  with the social credit score surveillance grid.
[30:46.360 --> 30:48.360]  So you've heard the U.S. Army saying
[30:48.360 --> 30:50.360]  our job is to kill people and break things.
[30:50.360 --> 30:52.360]  Well, that's what the lockdown's doing.
[30:52.360 --> 30:54.360]  It's starving the third world, millions and millions of death.
[30:54.360 --> 30:56.360]  It's breaking down the supply chain in society.
[30:56.360 --> 30:58.360]  It's their mission.
[30:58.360 --> 31:00.360]  Much of the time on big issues
[31:00.360 --> 31:02.360]  and societal developments,
[31:02.360 --> 31:04.360]  Info Wars is many, many years ahead.
[31:04.360 --> 31:06.360]  And almost all the time,
[31:06.360 --> 31:08.360]  we are tomorrow's news today.
[31:08.360 --> 31:10.360]  But there's a blind spot that Info Wars has.
[31:10.360 --> 31:12.360]  And I've noticed that really informed people
[31:12.360 --> 31:13.360]  have this as well.
[31:13.360 --> 31:15.360]  And I know a lot of you tuning in
[31:15.360 --> 31:17.360]  are some of the most performable out there.
[31:17.360 --> 31:18.360]  So I want you to be retrospective
[31:18.360 --> 31:19.360]  and kind of examine yourself
[31:19.360 --> 31:21.360]  because that's what I do every day.
[31:21.360 --> 31:23.360]  This Hunterbyte laptop is important,
[31:23.360 --> 31:26.360]  but the new audio confirmed to be him,
[31:26.360 --> 31:28.360]  where he admits he works under the
[31:28.360 --> 31:30.360]  Communist Chinese spy sheaf.
[31:30.360 --> 31:32.360]  He should be arrested right now.
[31:32.360 --> 31:34.360]  That is so huge.
[31:34.360 --> 31:36.360]  That is hiding in plain view.
[31:36.360 --> 31:38.360]  And it's getting almost no attention.
[31:38.360 --> 31:41.360]  We have to get that information out to everybody.
[31:41.360 --> 31:43.360]  It's all posted on InfoWars.com.
[31:43.360 --> 31:46.360]  So many other major patriotic sites.
[31:46.360 --> 31:48.360]  But we need to get it out to everybody
[31:48.360 --> 31:50.360]  and remember that we know all of this.
[31:50.360 --> 31:52.360]  We knew it a long time ago.
[31:52.360 --> 31:53.360]  So when it breaks down, we kind of go,
[31:53.360 --> 31:55.360]  okay, tell us that we didn't know.
[31:55.360 --> 32:02.360]  The point is now it's documented, now it's proven.
[32:25.360 --> 32:27.360]  It's been sold out for months.
[32:27.360 --> 32:29.360]  It's back in stock in spite that.
[32:29.360 --> 32:31.360]  Bodies, ultimate turmeric formula
[32:31.360 --> 32:34.360]  at InfoWars.com is 50% off
[32:34.360 --> 32:37.360]  with free shipping and triple patriot points
[32:37.360 --> 32:39.360]  at InfoWars.com.
[32:39.360 --> 32:41.360]  It's bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[32:41.360 --> 32:43.360]  If you haven't tried it,
[32:43.360 --> 32:45.360]  learn why it's got thousands of five-star reviews
[32:45.360 --> 32:47.360]  at InfoWars.com.
[32:47.360 --> 32:49.360]  And if you haven't tried it,
[32:49.360 --> 32:51.360]  learn why it's got thousands of five-star reviews
[32:51.360 --> 32:53.360]  at InfoWars.com.
[32:53.360 --> 32:56.360]  And you can't lose, it funds the InfoWars.
[33:24.360 --> 33:26.360]  I was talking to Rob,
[33:26.360 --> 33:29.360]  one of our great producers and researchers.
[33:29.360 --> 33:31.360]  And I said, are you mad?
[33:31.360 --> 33:33.360]  And Alan Sheehan's here back live.
[33:33.360 --> 33:35.360]  He said, man, I'm really mad.
[33:35.360 --> 33:37.360]  He said, I live in San Antonio.
[33:37.360 --> 33:39.360]  I was driving back up here today to Austin.
[33:39.360 --> 33:41.360]  He said, all I saw was Trump flags.
[33:41.360 --> 33:43.360]  All I saw was Trump vehicles.
[33:43.360 --> 33:45.360]  That's all I've seen, black, white, Hispanic.
[33:45.360 --> 33:47.360]  You name it, it's just everywhere.
[33:47.360 --> 33:49.360]  No Joe Biden anywhere.
[33:49.360 --> 33:51.360]  And they tell us Trump lost,
[33:51.360 --> 33:53.360]  and the election fraud's coming out, all confirmed.
[33:53.360 --> 33:55.360]  You turn on national news though,
[33:55.360 --> 33:57.360]  Fox CNN, oh, there's no proof.
[33:57.360 --> 33:59.360]  It's ridiculous. He needs to step down.
[33:59.360 --> 34:02.360]  They tried these four previous coups that failed.
[34:02.360 --> 34:05.360]  The key is President Trump must not concede.
[34:05.360 --> 34:07.360]  Now, we've announced,
[34:07.360 --> 34:10.360]  Owen Schreuer starting tomorrow morning.
[34:10.360 --> 34:13.360]  We cooked this up with some of our crew,
[34:13.360 --> 34:15.360]  and also Ali Alexander
[34:15.360 --> 34:17.360]  is going to launch at 5 p.m.
[34:17.360 --> 34:19.360]  from a location we'll announce tomorrow during my show
[34:19.360 --> 34:21.360]  to start a caravan.
[34:21.360 --> 34:23.360]  And the point is the long haul.
[34:23.360 --> 34:25.360]  From Austin,
[34:25.360 --> 34:27.360]  we decided the southern route down to Houston.
[34:27.360 --> 34:29.360]  They're going to stop
[34:29.360 --> 34:31.360]  either in Houston or a little bit further,
[34:31.360 --> 34:33.360]  maybe Beaumont.
[34:33.360 --> 34:35.360]  And then they're going to go all the way
[34:35.360 --> 34:37.360]  into Tallahassee,
[34:37.360 --> 34:39.360]  the capital of Florida.
[34:39.360 --> 34:41.360]  And they're going to turn up the next day
[34:41.360 --> 34:43.360]  and go all the way up to the capital of Georgia, Atlanta,
[34:43.360 --> 34:45.360]  and then ride up
[34:45.360 --> 34:47.360]  to the Carolinas into D.C.
[34:47.360 --> 34:49.360]  And I'll be arriving the next day
[34:49.360 --> 34:51.360]  with Ali Alexander and a lot of other crew.
[34:51.360 --> 34:53.360]  I've got some other secret plans.
[34:53.360 --> 34:55.360]  I'm going to leave it at that, but believe me,
[34:55.360 --> 34:57.360]  we're working really hard. I've never worked this hard.
[34:57.360 --> 34:59.360]  I'm very pleased to be here, very thankful to be here,
[34:59.360 --> 35:01.360]  but it's a responsibility.
[35:01.360 --> 35:03.360]  Ali Alexander has not been doing interviews
[35:03.360 --> 35:05.360]  because he helped start, stop the steal.
[35:05.360 --> 35:07.360]  In fact, he first did it,
[35:07.360 --> 35:09.360]  but months and months ago started the movement
[35:09.360 --> 35:11.360]  knowing this was coming,
[35:11.360 --> 35:13.360]  and he's here to give us the latest numbers.
[35:13.360 --> 35:15.360]  But it's so critical, Ali,
[35:15.360 --> 35:17.360]  that you can see because the cavalry is coming
[35:17.360 --> 35:19.360]  and the evidence of fraud is mounting
[35:19.360 --> 35:21.360]  massively, Ali Alexander.
[35:21.360 --> 35:23.360]  We know that the president
[35:23.360 --> 35:25.360]  is watching these broadcasts,
[35:25.360 --> 35:27.360]  and so I want to say, Mr. President,
[35:27.360 --> 35:29.360]  the Calvary is coming.
[35:29.360 --> 35:31.360]  Stop the steal.us is
[35:31.360 --> 35:33.360]  uniting every one of all kinds of
[35:33.360 --> 35:35.360]  different stripes, all kinds of different persuasions
[35:35.360 --> 35:37.360]  saying, we want a transparent
[35:37.360 --> 35:39.360]  election, not an opaque election.
[35:39.360 --> 35:41.360]  So give us a transparent
[35:41.360 --> 35:43.360]  election. And what Democrats
[35:43.360 --> 35:45.360]  are you hiding? Because it's only
[35:45.360 --> 35:47.360]  in states where there are Democrats
[35:47.360 --> 35:49.360]  governors and Democrat secretaries
[35:49.360 --> 35:51.360]  of states, are we really having
[35:51.360 --> 35:53.360]  the problems in most of these
[35:53.360 --> 35:55.360]  in these contests? So,
[35:55.360 --> 35:57.360]  Alex, I just want to applaud you because look,
[35:57.360 --> 35:59.360]  you know, taxes under a Biden-Harris
[35:59.360 --> 36:01.360]  administration are going to go up, but people
[36:01.360 --> 36:03.360]  like you and me, we're selling
[36:03.360 --> 36:05.360]  our lives, our treasure, and our
[36:05.360 --> 36:07.360]  sacred honor to try to stop
[36:07.360 --> 36:09.360]  this steal.
[36:09.360 --> 36:11.360]  I want to be clear,
[36:11.360 --> 36:13.360]  his taxes are meant to erect the U.S.
[36:13.360 --> 36:15.360]  economy, all the big globalist billionaires that funding
[36:15.360 --> 36:17.360]  were tax exempt offshore, but he's talking
[36:17.360 --> 36:19.360]  about a permanent lockdown
[36:19.360 --> 36:21.360]  clowered and pivot program for those that don't
[36:21.360 --> 36:23.360]  know is to bankrupt us to make us go into
[36:23.360 --> 36:25.360]  socialism. They want to break the American
[36:25.360 --> 36:27.360]  model, put us on a guaranteed universal
[36:27.360 --> 36:29.360]  income to dictate the way we live
[36:29.360 --> 36:31.360]  our lives. America is going into
[36:31.360 --> 36:33.360]  bondage right now under this Biden
[36:33.360 --> 36:35.360]  fraud. We must reject it. And finally,
[36:35.360 --> 36:37.360]  I see a little bit of a truthful headline
[36:37.360 --> 36:39.360]  out of Fox News. Republicans
[36:39.360 --> 36:41.360]  are angry at mainstream
[36:41.360 --> 36:43.360]  media projections
[36:43.360 --> 36:45.360]  of Biden
[36:45.360 --> 36:47.360]  win. That's all these are, is projections.
[36:47.360 --> 36:49.360]  This is not a Biden win.
[36:49.360 --> 36:51.360]  Right. It's not a Biden win.
[36:51.360 --> 36:53.360]  What people need to understand, the media
[36:53.360 --> 36:55.360]  is saying that if there are
[36:55.360 --> 36:57.360]  no court cases that favor
[36:57.360 --> 36:59.360]  Trump, then
[36:59.360 --> 37:01.360]  this may be how the
[37:01.360 --> 37:03.360]  Secretary of State of these respective states
[37:03.360 --> 37:05.360]  certify the election.
[37:05.360 --> 37:07.360]  We're talking about a guess of a
[37:07.360 --> 37:09.360]  guess, and it's stupid. It's irresponsible.
[37:09.360 --> 37:11.360]  Honestly, it should be against
[37:11.360 --> 37:13.360]  the law. It should be totally against the law.
[37:13.360 --> 37:15.360]  We should regulate the media,
[37:15.360 --> 37:17.360]  keep open the first amendment and free
[37:17.360 --> 37:19.360]  speech for the citizens. But these corporate powers
[37:19.360 --> 37:21.360]  have totally
[37:21.360 --> 37:23.360]  broken democracy. And I don't say
[37:23.360 --> 37:25.360]  that lightly. They have broken democracy.
[37:25.360 --> 37:27.360]  We are not going to be able to come
[37:27.360 --> 37:29.360]  together after this. What we
[37:29.360 --> 37:31.360]  are choosing is who will have
[37:31.360 --> 37:33.360]  the state powers? Who will
[37:33.360 --> 37:35.360]  have control of the state? Will it be
[37:35.360 --> 37:37.360]  Donald J. Trump
[37:37.360 --> 37:39.360]  or the cabal that is putting up
[37:39.360 --> 37:41.360]  this empty vessel, Joe Biden?
[37:41.360 --> 37:43.360]  And I got to tell you, I'm not
[37:43.360 --> 37:45.360]  safe in that environment. You're not
[37:45.360 --> 37:47.360]  safe in that environment. They make
[37:47.360 --> 37:49.360]  lists of people who watch this show.
[37:49.360 --> 37:51.360]  You're not safe listener in that
[37:51.360 --> 37:53.360]  environment. So we all need to take to the streets
[37:53.360 --> 37:55.360]  and say we want a transparent election
[37:55.360 --> 37:57.360]  or we got to stop this country from
[37:57.360 --> 37:59.360]  moving peacefully.
[37:59.360 --> 38:01.360]  Well, that's right. For those that don't know,
[38:01.360 --> 38:03.360]  even under the UN's own rules, which they love
[38:03.360 --> 38:05.360]  to quote, if a thing's not transparent,
[38:05.360 --> 38:07.360]  there's not poll watchers, there's illegitimate election.
[38:07.360 --> 38:09.360]  Then we have the evidence of fraud in all these states
[38:09.360 --> 38:11.360]  that's happened. We have the five states stopping
[38:11.360 --> 38:13.360]  the votes at the same time. Trump being way ahead
[38:13.360 --> 38:15.360]  then magically when the magic ballots come in,
[38:15.360 --> 38:17.360]  it goes straight up. We have the right
[38:17.360 --> 38:19.360]  and the duty to say no to this. Then
[38:19.360 --> 38:21.360]  Biden's a chai-com agent on top of it,
[38:21.360 --> 38:23.360]  even if he won the election, which he hasn't,
[38:23.360 --> 38:25.360]  we have a right to not let him beat the president
[38:25.360 --> 38:27.360]  because they claim Trump was this Russian agent
[38:27.360 --> 38:29.360]  with no proof. But Joe Biden, my God,
[38:29.360 --> 38:31.360]  Oli Alexander, we've got incredible
[38:31.360 --> 38:33.360]  evidence.
[38:33.360 --> 38:35.360]  We've got damning evidence. We've got him dead
[38:35.360 --> 38:37.360]  to rights. The audacity
[38:37.360 --> 38:39.360]  was that he got to shake Hunter Biden in our
[38:39.360 --> 38:41.360]  faces on stage last night.
[38:41.360 --> 38:43.360]  I mean, they know that the coup
[38:43.360 --> 38:45.360]  has worked. They know that the
[38:45.360 --> 38:47.360]  sigh up on the American people has worked.
[38:47.360 --> 38:49.360]  They know that censorship has worked.
[38:49.360 --> 38:51.360]  They think that you're a coward.
[38:51.360 --> 38:53.360]  Okay. They think we're all
[38:53.360 --> 38:55.360]  cowards and I'm here to let them know
[38:55.360 --> 38:57.360]  you can arrest me.
[38:57.360 --> 38:59.360]  You can hurt me, but you're not going to take
[38:59.360 --> 39:01.360]  away my sovereignty. This is a gift given
[39:01.360 --> 39:03.360]  to me by God. My rights are given to me
[39:03.360 --> 39:05.360]  by God. And if you want to wipe me off
[39:05.360 --> 39:07.360]  this earth, I'm going to make you do it on live
[39:07.360 --> 39:09.360]  television. This is dumb.
[39:09.360 --> 39:11.360]  What is happening is dumb.
[39:11.360 --> 39:13.360]  The weak Republican Party has given
[39:13.360 --> 39:15.360]  room for this to happen, but the Democrats
[39:15.360 --> 39:17.360]  partnered with China. They're partnering
[39:17.360 --> 39:19.360]  with Iran.
[39:19.360 --> 39:21.360]  Look, Alex, all of Joe Biden's
[39:21.360 --> 39:23.360]  announcements today were about
[39:23.360 --> 39:25.360]  the Paris Climate Accord
[39:25.360 --> 39:27.360]  giving Iran some more money and then
[39:27.360 --> 39:29.360]  working with the Chinese. He's obviously
[39:29.360 --> 39:31.360]  a globalist.
[39:31.360 --> 39:33.360]  He's obviously a globalist
[39:33.360 --> 39:35.360]  and they are seeking to rape
[39:35.360 --> 39:37.360]  and pillage America. You and me.
[39:37.360 --> 39:39.360]  There's not going to be a US
[39:39.360 --> 39:41.360]  dollar. There's not going to be a
[39:41.360 --> 39:43.360]  US border. We're not going to be able
[39:43.360 --> 39:45.360]  to get the supplies that we
[39:45.360 --> 39:47.360]  have relied on in normal
[39:47.360 --> 39:49.360]  America. He's going to lock us down
[39:49.360 --> 39:51.360]  and that's going to become the new norm and I'm telling you
[39:51.360 --> 39:53.360]  I won't live in that world. They will have to
[39:53.360 --> 39:55.360]  wipe me out. I'm not even kidding.
[39:55.360 --> 39:57.360]  Well, I'm glad you raised that point.
[39:57.360 --> 39:59.360]  We'll play the clip in a moment where maybe we'll just play
[39:59.360 --> 40:01.360]  the whole Biden speech next segment.
[40:01.360 --> 40:03.360]  That's probably the easiest way to show it, but he leads
[40:03.360 --> 40:05.360]  his evil crackhead
[40:05.360 --> 40:07.360]  Chinese communist Russian spy
[40:07.360 --> 40:09.360]  son on video on audio admitting
[40:09.360 --> 40:11.360]  it all. He Biden's bragged about how
[40:11.360 --> 40:13.360]  he's a foreign agent on to the stage
[40:13.360 --> 40:15.360]  in front of everybody
[40:15.360 --> 40:17.360]  with this baby in his arms
[40:17.360 --> 40:19.360]  when he's a known pervert
[40:19.360 --> 40:21.360]  and they just throw that in our face. I mean, this is
[40:21.360 --> 40:23.360]  insane. He's been in hiding for months
[40:23.360 --> 40:25.360]  and they throw this in our face.
[40:25.360 --> 40:27.360]  Yeah, it's what they're saying
[40:27.360 --> 40:29.360]  is that the media controls you.
[40:29.360 --> 40:31.360]  They're saying that the media controls you
[40:31.360 --> 40:33.360]  and Fox News is in on the game.
[40:33.360 --> 40:35.360]  You know, Alex,
[40:35.360 --> 40:37.360]  your listeners are pretty educated so they'll probably
[40:37.360 --> 40:39.360]  know this. When you buy that cable
[40:39.360 --> 40:41.360]  package because oh, I got a favorite
[40:41.360 --> 40:43.360]  show on this channel or that channel
[40:43.360 --> 40:45.360]  and Alex, I did hear you bragging about watching
[40:45.360 --> 40:47.360]  some show or whatever.
[40:47.360 --> 40:49.360]  A portion of that
[40:49.360 --> 40:51.360]  bill goes to CNN.
[40:51.360 --> 40:53.360]  So if you're buying
[40:53.360 --> 40:55.360]  the cable package and you're paying $60
[40:55.360 --> 40:57.360]  a month, CNN
[40:57.360 --> 40:59.360]  is making $3 of that a month whether
[40:59.360 --> 41:01.360]  or not you subscribe to them
[41:01.360 --> 41:03.360]  or not or you watch them or not.
[41:03.360 --> 41:05.360]  We've got to decide that the media
[41:05.360 --> 41:07.360]  is the problem.
[41:07.360 --> 41:09.360]  How we know what we know is the problem
[41:09.360 --> 41:11.360]  and for Joe Biden to have the audacity
[41:11.360 --> 41:13.360]  that's how we know he's the evil godfather
[41:13.360 --> 41:15.360]  figure because he had the audacity
[41:15.360 --> 41:17.360]  to shove it in our faces.
[41:17.360 --> 41:19.360]  By the way, there's a new
[41:19.360 --> 41:21.360]  Atlantic Monthly article.
[41:21.360 --> 41:23.360]  I'm not joking. I had it out there. I left it
[41:23.360 --> 41:25.360]  in my office where it says,
[41:25.360 --> 41:27.360]  Biden fondling your child is like
[41:27.360 --> 41:29.360]  Christ touching you and that's a new
[41:29.360 --> 41:31.360]  holy act that heals the nation. Did you
[41:31.360 --> 41:33.360]  see that? No, I did not see that.
[41:33.360 --> 41:35.360]  It would not surprise me.
[41:35.360 --> 41:37.360]  These people, they're perverts and they're
[41:37.360 --> 41:39.360]  seeking to, you and I have talked about this,
[41:39.360 --> 41:41.360]  invert, invert all of these
[41:41.360 --> 41:43.360]  holy orders that we have,
[41:43.360 --> 41:45.360]  that Christianity stabilized
[41:45.360 --> 41:47.360]  this feral version
[41:47.360 --> 41:49.360]  of what Rome had after it burned
[41:49.360 --> 41:51.360]  and all this. Christianity injected
[41:51.360 --> 41:53.360]  into
[41:53.360 --> 41:55.360]  Western civilization a stabilizing
[41:55.360 --> 41:57.360]  formula. Western civilization
[41:57.360 --> 41:59.360]  didn't work until he had it.
[41:59.360 --> 42:01.360]  Exactly. So the basis
[42:01.360 --> 42:03.360]  of what we call Western civilization
[42:03.360 --> 42:05.360]  now is Christianity because prior
[42:05.360 --> 42:07.360]  Western civilization didn't work and what
[42:07.360 --> 42:09.360]  Joe Biden and George Soros
[42:09.360 --> 42:11.360]  and Marina Abramovic and Lady
[42:11.360 --> 42:13.360]  Gaga and Jay-Z and all
[42:13.360 --> 42:15.360]  these people are doing is they're seeking to find
[42:15.360 --> 42:17.360]  these things that we find holy
[42:17.360 --> 42:19.360]  and then pervert them.
[42:19.360 --> 42:21.360]  Less the nature of Satanism is to invert
[42:21.360 --> 42:23.360]  Christianity because they want the power.
[42:23.360 --> 42:25.360]  All right, Ali Alexander, great job.
[42:25.360 --> 42:27.360]  We're going to be announcing with maps and
[42:27.360 --> 42:29.360]  everything tomorrow. The big caravan
[42:29.360 --> 42:31.360]  with an RV and the armored vehicle.
[42:31.360 --> 42:33.360]  I think tens of thousands of vehicles should join us.
[42:33.360 --> 42:35.360]  Truck drivers are planning to shut down DC
[42:35.360 --> 42:37.360]  coming up this week. We've only begun to fight.
[42:37.360 --> 42:39.360]  The cavalry is coming for the president. Do not
[42:39.360 --> 42:41.360]  concede President Trump. Ali Alexander,
[42:41.360 --> 42:43.360]  thank you so much.
[42:43.360 --> 42:45.360]  We'll be right back. I'm going to go over the
[42:45.360 --> 42:47.360]  election numbers
[42:47.360 --> 42:49.360]  and so much more in the next segment. Please
[42:49.360 --> 42:51.360]  spread the word, folks. Only when we get out
[42:51.360 --> 42:53.360]  is you spread the word.
[42:53.360 --> 42:55.360]  MUSIC
[42:55.360 --> 42:57.360]  MUSIC
[42:57.360 --> 42:59.360]  DNA Force Plus, if you did
[42:59.360 --> 43:01.360]  one thing for your immune system
[43:01.360 --> 43:03.360]  you would be getting all the essential things
[43:03.360 --> 43:05.360]  and that's the clean iodine, X2 or X3,
[43:05.360 --> 43:07.360]  that's the bio tricillinium
[43:07.360 --> 43:09.360]  that is the vitamin D3,
[43:09.360 --> 43:11.360]  that is the C, that is the zinc, there's 13
[43:11.360 --> 43:13.360]  vitamins and minerals that are essential without them
[43:13.360 --> 43:15.360]  and studies show you really need the other ones too.
[43:15.360 --> 43:17.360]  But DNA Force goes beyond that. It helps
[43:17.360 --> 43:19.360]  get all that in the cells and out the cells
[43:19.360 --> 43:21.360]  with PQQ and CoQ10 of the highest quality
[43:21.360 --> 43:23.360]  sources with other ingredients that
[43:23.360 --> 43:25.360]  clean out the cells, that
[43:25.360 --> 43:27.360]  unclog them so all that stuff can get
[43:27.360 --> 43:29.360]  in. Viruses don't get in. The good stuff
[43:29.360 --> 43:31.360]  gets in as the NIH website says
[43:31.360 --> 43:33.360]  that if you have all the proper things, they can't
[43:33.360 --> 43:35.360]  replicate like they could. But I do this because
[43:35.360 --> 43:37.360]  it's essential, like oxygen, like water. DNA Force
[43:37.360 --> 43:39.360]  sold out for months, 50% off out of the gates,
[43:39.360 --> 43:41.360]  triple pay 3 at points, free shipping
[43:41.360 --> 43:43.360]  infowarstore.com
[43:43.360 --> 43:45.360]  DNA Force, election special, that's going to have to
[43:45.360 --> 43:47.360]  end in a week. We've got a limited supply and it was very hard
[43:47.360 --> 43:49.360]  to get the PQQ this time. A lot of our stuff
[43:49.360 --> 43:51.360]  can't get any more, a lot of our products because the supply
[43:51.360 --> 43:53.360]  chain is broken down, that's part of the global's plan.
[43:53.360 --> 43:55.360]  infowarstore.com or
[43:55.360 --> 43:57.360]  triple 82533139.
[43:57.360 --> 43:59.360]  I want to thank you all for tuning in. Election 2020
[43:59.360 --> 44:01.360]  is here and whether Trump wins or loses
[44:01.360 --> 44:03.360]  we have all won
[44:03.360 --> 44:05.360]  by exposing the commonest Chinese,
[44:05.360 --> 44:07.360]  by exposing the globalist, by exposing the
[44:07.360 --> 44:09.360]  world.
[44:09.360 --> 44:11.360]  This is really a fight between good
[44:11.360 --> 44:13.360]  versus evil.
[44:13.360 --> 44:15.360]  I'm personally a Christian and I believe in God
[44:15.360 --> 44:17.360]  and I know God's real and I've experienced it in my life.
[44:17.360 --> 44:19.360]  Believe you don't believe in God.
[44:19.360 --> 44:21.360]  It's important to recognize that there is good
[44:21.360 --> 44:23.360]  in this world, there is evil.
[44:23.360 --> 44:25.360]  There are people out there that want to do you harm
[44:25.360 --> 44:27.360]  because they enjoy doing that.
[44:27.360 --> 44:29.360]  And what I see happening across
[44:29.360 --> 44:31.360]  the spectrum of different political views
[44:31.360 --> 44:33.360]  is people finally get that,
[44:33.360 --> 44:35.360]  they finally understand that they're not
[44:35.360 --> 44:37.360]  being naive anymore.
[44:37.360 --> 44:39.360]  Don't ever project your decency
[44:39.360 --> 44:41.360]  and your goodness on to other people
[44:41.360 --> 44:43.360]  until they've proven
[44:43.360 --> 44:45.360]  what they stand for and who they are.
[44:45.360 --> 44:47.360]  Or you're going to get hurt. But those of you
[44:47.360 --> 44:49.360]  out there that have done your own research and discovered
[44:49.360 --> 44:51.360]  who's good and who is faithful
[44:51.360 --> 44:53.360]  will then come together with those organizations
[44:53.360 --> 44:55.360]  and support them like info wars.
[44:55.360 --> 44:57.360]  Without your support info wars would not exist.
[44:59.360 --> 45:03.360]  The days of hell.
[45:03.360 --> 45:07.360]  The nightmare is here.
[45:07.360 --> 45:11.360]  79 days of hell has begun.
[45:11.360 --> 45:13.360]  Multinational corporations,
[45:13.360 --> 45:15.360]  the mainstream media apparatus
[45:15.360 --> 45:17.360]  and social media tech giants
[45:17.360 --> 45:19.360]  are all now being deployed
[45:19.360 --> 45:23.360]  by the archaic inbred crooked establishment
[45:23.360 --> 45:27.360]  to interfere with the 2020 US elections,
[45:27.360 --> 45:29.360]  remove the populist champion of the people,
[45:29.360 --> 45:31.360]  Donald J. Trump
[45:31.360 --> 45:33.360]  and install the decrepit, perverted,
[45:33.360 --> 45:35.360]  traitorous establishment
[45:35.360 --> 45:37.360]  puppet Joe Biden
[45:37.360 --> 45:41.360]  along with rabid radical hag Kamala Harris.
[45:41.360 --> 45:43.360]  Keep your heads on a swivel
[45:43.360 --> 45:47.360]  and tune in to 79days.news
[45:47.360 --> 45:51.360]  for tomorrow's news today.
[45:51.360 --> 45:53.360]  79days.news
[45:53.360 --> 45:55.360]  America's last stand.
[45:55.360 --> 45:59.360]  79days.news.
[45:59.360 --> 46:02.360]  Throughout history there have been two basic forms of civilizations
[46:02.360 --> 46:04.360]  and different mixes of the two.
[46:04.360 --> 46:07.360]  One is born of renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[46:07.360 --> 46:10.360]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened,
[46:10.360 --> 46:13.360]  focused people with an ethos and a culture
[46:13.360 --> 46:16.360]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[46:16.360 --> 46:19.360]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves
[46:19.360 --> 46:22.360]  it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[46:22.360 --> 46:25.360]  America is transferring out of a system
[46:25.360 --> 46:27.360]  based on the ethos of liberty and freedom
[46:27.360 --> 46:30.360]  into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[46:30.360 --> 46:32.360]  That's why the globalists tell us America
[46:32.360 --> 46:34.360]  was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[46:34.360 --> 46:36.360]  They point out one of our evils
[46:36.360 --> 46:39.360]  so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[46:39.360 --> 46:41.360]  A global permanent lockdown is here
[46:41.360 --> 46:44.360]  that is already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[46:44.360 --> 46:46.360]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[46:46.360 --> 46:48.360]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense
[46:48.360 --> 46:51.360]  in England and a top general have come out and said
[46:51.360 --> 46:54.360]  the coming lockdown is going to trigger a giant New World War.
[46:54.360 --> 46:58.360]  That's the facts. This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[47:01.360 --> 47:04.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:20.360 --> 47:22.360]  I always knew World Government was coming.
[47:22.360 --> 47:26.360]  I always knew they'd use a bio-weapon attack
[47:26.360 --> 47:29.360]  as the cover for it because they told us they would.
[47:29.360 --> 47:32.360]  I made documentaries about it and predicted it all.
[47:32.360 --> 47:35.360]  But now, we're here.
[47:37.360 --> 47:40.360]  And who would have ever imagined
[47:40.360 --> 47:43.360]  that we would have had a president fighting it
[47:43.360 --> 47:45.360]  who had turned around the economy
[47:45.360 --> 47:47.360]  and rolled back so much of their fraud
[47:47.360 --> 47:52.360]  and had all these peace deals and ended all these wars
[47:52.360 --> 47:56.360]  and that they would then have a fraudulent election and reject him.
[47:56.360 --> 48:00.360]  And then put in a weird corpse that says he's his grandma,
[48:00.360 --> 48:02.360]  he's his wife, he's his son, he's his daughter,
[48:02.360 --> 48:05.360]  doesn't know who he is and brings his crack head,
[48:05.360 --> 48:08.360]  Chinese Communist son up on stage with him.
[48:08.360 --> 48:10.360]  But they didn't wear their mask for that.
[48:10.360 --> 48:13.360]  They wore them before it, but oh, when they want to, they take them off.
[48:13.360 --> 48:17.360]  It's all sick.
[48:17.360 --> 48:20.360]  And to see all these domesticated slaves living off the blood
[48:20.360 --> 48:23.360]  to sweat the toil of men and women that fought for their freedom,
[48:23.360 --> 48:25.360]  disgust me.
[48:25.360 --> 48:28.360]  A lot of folks go, well, then let these idiots learn.
[48:28.360 --> 48:30.360]  Let the bunch of dumb idiots get run over
[48:30.360 --> 48:32.360]  and be slaves doesn't make us free.
[48:32.360 --> 48:34.360]  I take no pleasure watching idiots get conned.
[48:34.360 --> 48:37.360]  I take no pleasure watching them die.
[48:37.360 --> 48:41.360]  Their ignorance is our weakness.
[48:41.360 --> 48:43.360]  In fact, beginning to hate the slaves,
[48:43.360 --> 48:46.360]  because I used to be a slave too, is the beginning of the end.
[48:46.360 --> 48:49.360]  Because then you become the globalist who decide,
[48:49.360 --> 48:52.360]  let's not try to empower people, let's dumb them down on purpose.
[48:52.360 --> 48:57.360]  Because humanity is bad enough when we're falling.
[48:57.360 --> 48:59.360]  But the devil even takes us lower.
[48:59.360 --> 49:01.360]  Let's play a few of these clips.
[49:01.360 --> 49:03.360]  Here's Biden two months ago saying,
[49:03.360 --> 49:05.360]  we've got the most people ever for election fraud
[49:05.360 --> 49:07.360]  and then Pelosi a week and a half ago saying,
[49:07.360 --> 49:10.360]  I don't care what happens with this thing coming up.
[49:10.360 --> 49:12.360]  He'll be inaugurated after.
[49:12.360 --> 49:15.360]  And they told us they do it with a balance and they did it.
[49:15.360 --> 49:18.360]  Because there was one thing criminals do, they love to brag.
[49:18.360 --> 49:20.360]  Only time they tell the truth is when they're telling you
[49:20.360 --> 49:22.360]  how they're effing you over. Here it is.
[49:22.360 --> 49:26.360]  Secondly, we're in a situation where we have put together,
[49:26.360 --> 49:30.360]  and you guys did it for our administration,
[49:30.360 --> 49:33.360]  the President Obama's administration before this.
[49:33.360 --> 49:38.360]  We have put together, I think, the most extensive
[49:38.360 --> 49:44.360]  and inclusive voter fraud organization
[49:44.360 --> 49:47.360]  in the history of American politics.
[49:47.360 --> 49:49.360]  But we are ready.
[49:49.360 --> 49:55.360]  I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected President on Tuesday.
[49:55.360 --> 49:59.360]  Whatever the end count is,
[49:59.360 --> 50:02.360]  but on the election that occurs on Tuesday,
[50:02.360 --> 50:04.360]  he will be elected on January 20th.
[50:04.360 --> 50:09.360]  He will be inaugurated President of the United States.
[50:09.360 --> 50:12.360]  She's the one that goes to the salon that's going bankrupt,
[50:12.360 --> 50:14.360]  doesn't wear a mask, it's caught, not wearing a...
[50:14.360 --> 50:17.360]  Oh, but for the TV, she wears it up there on the stage.
[50:17.360 --> 50:20.360]  How similar if she's dirty, she's bad, COVID's deadly.
[50:20.360 --> 50:22.360]  Oh, my gosh. Oh, it's all Trump's fault.
[50:22.360 --> 50:24.360]  America has...
[50:24.360 --> 50:27.360]  America's 4% of the world population,
[50:27.360 --> 50:29.360]  but we're 30% of the COVID cases.
[50:29.360 --> 50:31.360]  BS, other countries...
[50:31.360 --> 50:34.360]  Well, don't worry, Biden has a new plan.
[50:34.360 --> 50:36.360]  Everyone will be tested under government law.
[50:36.360 --> 50:38.360]  You'll all be tested for COVID,
[50:38.360 --> 50:41.360]  and you'll be disappeared off to a COVID center
[50:41.360 --> 50:43.360]  because the tests are false.
[50:43.360 --> 50:45.360]  How do they come and take us away to jail?
[50:45.360 --> 50:47.360]  Well, you don't learn it, just like Australia,
[50:47.360 --> 50:49.360]  just like Spain, just like Scotland.
[50:49.360 --> 50:51.360]  I've got the articles right here.
[50:51.360 --> 50:53.360]  I'll cover it next hour.
[50:53.360 --> 50:55.360]  This is the police state.
[50:55.360 --> 50:58.360]  But the accomplished attorney and lawyer
[50:58.360 --> 51:01.360]  for General Flynn Sidney Powell
[51:01.360 --> 51:03.360]  joined Fox News host
[51:03.360 --> 51:05.360]  to talk about some of the latest info.
[51:05.360 --> 51:07.360]  The number is now over 600,000.
[51:07.360 --> 51:10.360]  This was a day ago, but it's on GatewayPunna.com.
[51:10.360 --> 51:12.360]  They've identified 450,000 ballots
[51:12.360 --> 51:16.360]  that miraculously only have a Joe Biden on them.
[51:16.360 --> 51:18.360]  I mean, literally, they'll come in by the hundreds of thousands,
[51:18.360 --> 51:21.360]  the 20,000s, all for Biden.
[51:21.360 --> 51:23.360]  They all come in days later.
[51:23.360 --> 51:25.360]  They've already got federal courts, the state courts saying,
[51:25.360 --> 51:27.360]  yeah, these ballots aren't good.
[51:27.360 --> 51:29.360]  If you remove the ballots that came in after the fact,
[51:29.360 --> 51:31.360]  Trump wins Pennsylvania, he wins Michigan,
[51:31.360 --> 51:33.360]  he wins Wisconsin, he wins Georgia,
[51:33.360 --> 51:35.360]  but they don't care
[51:35.360 --> 51:37.360]  because they're all having everyone announced
[51:37.360 --> 51:39.360]  that Trump has lost and he's a sore loser.
[51:39.360 --> 51:41.360]  If we give into this hoax,
[51:41.360 --> 51:43.360]  we give into the end of our electoral process
[51:43.360 --> 51:45.360]  and every fraud that comes after it,
[51:45.360 --> 51:47.360]  here is the Fox News report.
[51:47.360 --> 51:52.360]  What has taken place here as you see it?
[51:52.360 --> 51:55.360]  Yes, there has been a massive and coordinated effort
[51:55.360 --> 51:57.360]  to steal this election
[51:57.360 --> 52:00.360]  from we the people of the United States of America
[52:00.360 --> 52:04.360]  to delegitimize and destroy votes for Donald Trump,
[52:04.360 --> 52:07.360]  to manufacture votes for Joe Biden.
[52:07.360 --> 52:09.360]  They have done it in every way imaginable
[52:09.360 --> 52:13.360]  from having dead people vote in massive numbers
[52:13.360 --> 52:18.360]  to absolutely fraudulently creating ballots
[52:18.360 --> 52:20.360]  that exist only voting for Biden.
[52:20.360 --> 52:24.360]  We've identified at least 450,000 ballots
[52:24.360 --> 52:28.360]  in the key states that miraculously only have a mark
[52:28.360 --> 52:31.360]  for Joe Biden on them and no other candidate.
[52:31.360 --> 52:34.360]  If you look at Florida where things were done right,
[52:34.360 --> 52:36.360]  you can see that that's how the rest of the country
[52:36.360 --> 52:38.360]  should have gone,
[52:38.360 --> 52:41.360]  but they also used an algorithm to calculate the votes
[52:41.360 --> 52:43.360]  they would need to flip
[52:43.360 --> 52:46.360]  and they used the computers to flip those votes
[52:46.360 --> 52:49.360]  from Biden, I mean, from Trump to Biden
[52:49.360 --> 52:51.360]  and from other Republican candidates
[52:51.360 --> 52:53.360]  to their competitors also.
[52:53.360 --> 52:56.360]  I think Doug Collins had the race stolen from him.
[52:56.360 --> 52:59.360]  I think John James had his race stolen from him.
[52:59.360 --> 53:01.360]  It wasn't just President Trump.
[53:01.360 --> 53:03.360]  There were many people affected by this.
[53:03.360 --> 53:07.360]  We have got to fight tooth and nail in federal court
[53:07.360 --> 53:11.360]  to expose this abject fraud and the conspiracy behind it
[53:11.360 --> 53:15.360]  and get a recount and audits in every place it's needed,
[53:15.360 --> 53:18.360]  which is frankly most of the country.
[53:18.360 --> 53:22.360]  Yeah, it's not just where they took the steal over the top.
[53:22.360 --> 53:24.360]  They thought they could do the steal
[53:24.360 --> 53:26.360]  and have Biden announce the victor that day.
[53:26.360 --> 53:28.360]  That was plan A, but if they couldn't,
[53:28.360 --> 53:30.360]  they'd freeze it, as we said,
[53:30.360 --> 53:33.360]  and then add the fraudulent votes in.
[53:33.360 --> 53:36.360]  The good news is Trump supporters,
[53:36.360 --> 53:39.360]  Trump candidates won the biggest landslide ever
[53:39.360 --> 53:41.360]  at state legislature level
[53:41.360 --> 53:43.360]  and they're going to change the laws.
[53:43.360 --> 53:46.360]  Texas, North Carolina, several other states throughout,
[53:46.360 --> 53:49.360]  I've got a whole stack of documents on that right here.
[53:49.360 --> 53:51.360]  I'm covered at your show, Saturday show.
[53:51.360 --> 53:55.360]  A whole stack of documents that prove
[53:55.360 --> 53:58.360]  that this Soros group is throwing this fraud
[53:58.360 --> 54:01.360]  and all these states have thrown out and decertified
[54:01.360 --> 54:03.360]  this company, Staple Street,
[54:03.360 --> 54:06.360]  that's owned partly by Soros and the Bushes,
[54:06.360 --> 54:09.360]  and Mitt Romney.
[54:09.360 --> 54:11.360]  And they use this in third world countries, too,
[54:11.360 --> 54:13.360]  as Staple Street's involved in that.
[54:13.360 --> 54:15.360]  So that's what they did.
[54:15.360 --> 54:16.360]  And they think you're an idiot.
[54:16.360 --> 54:19.360]  They think you're a moron.
[54:19.360 --> 54:21.360]  And they have stolen things out in the open
[54:21.360 --> 54:23.360]  and now they just want Trump to concede.
[54:23.360 --> 54:24.360]  Don't have court.
[54:24.360 --> 54:25.360]  Don't investigate.
[54:25.360 --> 54:26.360]  Don't look.
[54:26.360 --> 54:28.360]  No, we're going to investigate.
[54:28.360 --> 54:30.360]  We're going to look and we're going to burrow into it.
[54:30.360 --> 54:31.360]  We're going to expose you.
[54:31.360 --> 54:34.360]  And if you're crazy enough to steal this from us
[54:34.360 --> 54:40.360]  and put in the zombie crackhead communist agent,
[54:40.360 --> 54:45.360]  Hunter Biden's dad, who got up on C-SPAN and said,
[54:45.360 --> 54:47.360]  yeah, I had the prosecutor fired.
[54:47.360 --> 54:48.360]  He was investigating my son.
[54:48.360 --> 54:49.360]  I said, you don't get the billion dollars.
[54:49.360 --> 54:50.360]  You don't fire him.
[54:50.360 --> 54:54.360]  It's son of a bitch they did.
[54:54.360 --> 54:58.360]  So they've got a big, big, big problem
[54:58.360 --> 55:00.360]  because we're not going to concede.
[55:00.360 --> 55:01.360]  We're not going to roll over.
[55:01.360 --> 55:03.360]  We're not going to listen to that liar, Joe Biden,
[55:03.360 --> 55:06.360]  that he wants to be our buddy while his surrogate,
[55:06.360 --> 55:08.360]  Michelle Obama, Big Mike, comes out
[55:08.360 --> 55:10.360]  and says all white people are the devil
[55:10.360 --> 55:11.360]  and conservatives are the devil.
[55:11.360 --> 55:13.360]  And we all need to go to put in a prison
[55:13.360 --> 55:17.360]  and AOC says that we need to have reconciliation commissions
[55:17.360 --> 55:19.360]  where everybody associated with Trump's taking to jail
[55:19.360 --> 55:21.360]  until we say we're sorry.
[55:21.360 --> 55:24.360]  I mean, these people are out of control
[55:24.360 --> 55:26.360]  and they failed their first four steals
[55:26.360 --> 55:28.360]  and now they're pushing their latest one.
[55:28.360 --> 55:32.360]  But I'll say this real quick.
[55:32.360 --> 55:35.360]  We'll play that next segment where Biden,
[55:35.360 --> 55:37.360]  a year ago in Austin or San Antonio,
[55:37.360 --> 55:38.360]  got exposed for his pedophile activity.
[55:38.360 --> 55:42.360]  That's coming up next segment, next hour.
[55:42.360 --> 55:43.360]  I'm not funded by George Soros.
[55:43.360 --> 55:45.360]  I'm not funded by the DNC.
[55:45.360 --> 55:47.360]  I'm not funded by Lord Rothschild
[55:47.360 --> 55:48.360]  or the Rockefellers or Bill Gates.
[55:48.360 --> 55:50.360]  I'm funded by you.
[55:50.360 --> 55:51.360]  And I need your support.
[55:51.360 --> 55:52.360]  I need your help.
[55:52.360 --> 55:54.360]  We have t-shirts, books, films,
[55:54.360 --> 55:56.360]  incredibly high quality supplements,
[55:56.360 --> 55:58.360]  nutraceuticals that fund our operation.
[55:58.360 --> 56:02.360]  And we've had an extra 10 million people
[56:02.360 --> 56:05.360]  on the live streams in the last six days.
[56:05.360 --> 56:06.360]  And I got to pay for it all.
[56:06.360 --> 56:07.360]  I'm not bitching. It's just true.
[56:07.360 --> 56:09.360]  And the money's running out of our bank accounts
[56:09.360 --> 56:10.360]  so quick it makes my head spin.
[56:10.360 --> 56:12.360]  And I'm going to pay to have that caravan
[56:12.360 --> 56:14.360]  go to the East Coast.
[56:14.360 --> 56:16.360]  And I'm going to pay to fly up there with my crew.
[56:16.360 --> 56:17.360]  And I'm going to pay for it all,
[56:17.360 --> 56:18.360]  no matter what happens,
[56:18.360 --> 56:19.360]  and put it in God's hands.
[56:19.360 --> 56:21.360]  But listen, all the new audience tuning in.
[56:21.360 --> 56:23.360]  Tell folks about infowars.com.
[56:23.360 --> 56:25.360]  Tell folks about newswars.com.
[56:25.360 --> 56:26.360]  Tell them about band.video.
[56:26.360 --> 56:27.360]  Share the link on your email.
[56:27.360 --> 56:29.360]  It's all one who's reached two people.
[56:29.360 --> 56:32.360]  And then keep this last beacon of truth
[56:32.360 --> 56:35.360]  as all the other systems get shut down on air
[56:35.360 --> 56:36.360]  with the big tech censorship.
[56:36.360 --> 56:38.360]  We called it all before it happened.
[56:38.360 --> 56:40.360]  And then go to infowarsstore.com.
[56:40.360 --> 56:43.360]  As the 2020 election super sale prepares to end,
[56:43.360 --> 56:46.360]  DNA Force Plus with the PQQ of the CoQ10
[56:46.360 --> 56:49.360]  for your telomeres in your immune system
[56:49.360 --> 56:52.360]  and the vitamin mineral fusion for adults and children
[56:52.360 --> 56:54.360]  with all the vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[56:54.360 --> 56:56.360]  all the essential amino acids for you,
[56:56.360 --> 56:59.360]  so good for your body, it's there discounted.
[56:59.360 --> 57:03.360]  And body's ultimate turmeric formula back in stock.
[57:03.360 --> 57:05.360]  95% are cumanoids.
[57:05.360 --> 57:07.360]  The average turmeric formula does great.
[57:07.360 --> 57:08.360]  It's three to 5%.
[57:08.360 --> 57:10.360]  This is an extract to concentrate.
[57:10.360 --> 57:13.360]  95% body's ultimate turmeric formula,
[57:13.360 --> 57:16.360]  50% off, free shipping, triple patriot points
[57:16.360 --> 57:18.360]  on everything I just mentioned.
[57:18.360 --> 57:20.360]  But we need money to fund ourselves.
[57:20.360 --> 57:21.360]  I'm running out of our resources.
[57:21.360 --> 57:24.360]  I'm on less than a quarter tank
[57:24.360 --> 57:27.360]  and I've got my foot down on that accelerator,
[57:27.360 --> 57:30.360]  ramming speed like a game of chicken up against the enemy.
[57:30.360 --> 57:31.360]  And I just want to keep the gas in
[57:31.360 --> 57:33.360]  so I'm going 200 miles an hour
[57:33.360 --> 57:35.360]  when I go head into those sons of bitches.
[57:35.360 --> 57:37.360]  We've proven it, we're the real deal.
[57:37.360 --> 57:39.360]  I need money, this is a war.
[57:39.360 --> 57:42.360]  You need these products, get in there and buy them right now.
[57:48.360 --> 57:50.360]  It's all on record.
[57:50.360 --> 57:53.360]  Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford,
[57:53.360 --> 57:56.360]  they were all hired a year ago
[57:56.360 --> 57:59.360]  and then again six months ago to war game
[57:59.360 --> 58:02.360]  how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic
[58:02.360 --> 58:05.360]  and how to get the public to take inoculations.
[58:05.360 --> 58:08.360]  And they talk about calling people heroes that do it.
[58:08.360 --> 58:10.360]  They talk about shaming those that don't.
[58:10.360 --> 58:13.360]  This has all been psychologically tested.
[58:13.360 --> 58:15.360]  It's all been psychologically prepared
[58:15.360 --> 58:17.360]  and once they get you locked down for 15 days
[58:17.360 --> 58:19.360]  you notice now they say it's permanent.
[58:19.360 --> 58:20.360]  That's how it works.
[58:20.360 --> 58:22.360]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[58:22.360 --> 58:24.360]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot
[58:24.360 --> 58:26.360]  and everything will be alright.
[58:26.360 --> 58:27.360]  No.
[58:27.360 --> 58:29.360]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on
[58:29.360 --> 58:31.360]  and we're in the serial killer's van.
[58:31.360 --> 58:34.360]  He's taking us to his shack in the woods
[58:34.360 --> 58:36.360]  to slowly torture us to death.
[58:36.360 --> 58:37.360]  That's the allegory.
[58:37.360 --> 58:39.360]  We've got to bust out of this thing now.
[58:39.360 --> 58:40.360]  We've got to say no now.
[58:40.360 --> 58:42.360]  We've got to make a run for it now and we still can't.
[58:42.360 --> 58:44.360]  Once he gets us in that basement
[58:44.360 --> 58:46.360]  it's going to get a lot, lot worse folks.
[58:46.360 --> 58:48.360]  So stop submitting.
[58:48.360 --> 58:50.360]  The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces
[58:50.360 --> 58:53.360]  for any big corporation or government that'll pay them.
[58:53.360 --> 58:54.360]  It's that simple.
[58:54.360 --> 58:57.360]  They've used our open free society against us.
[58:57.360 --> 58:59.360]  The controlled media will talk about a few mistakes
[58:59.360 --> 59:01.360]  I've made over the years and obsess over it
[59:01.360 --> 59:03.360]  and say see he's a liar on purpose
[59:03.360 --> 59:06.360]  even though our success rate, our accuracy rate
[59:06.360 --> 59:08.360]  is way, way better than theirs.
[59:08.360 --> 59:09.360]  We try to tell the truth.
[59:09.360 --> 59:10.360]  They try to lie.
[59:10.360 --> 59:11.360]  They try to deceive.
[59:11.360 --> 59:14.360]  I'm trying to get people to realize that the globalists
[59:14.360 --> 59:18.360]  operate how they manipulate, how they bamboozle the public.
[59:18.360 --> 59:21.360]  I'm trying to get the public to ask questions
[59:21.360 --> 59:23.360]  and to not believe what they're told in the face.
[59:23.360 --> 59:28.360]  I'm trying to get people to research for themselves.
[59:28.360 --> 59:30.360]  The globalists and their controlled corporate press
[59:30.360 --> 59:33.360]  say that researching and not trusting media
[59:33.360 --> 59:35.360]  is evil and is a conspiracy theory.
[59:35.360 --> 59:38.360]  But again, on its face, that is a fraud.
[59:38.360 --> 59:39.360]  Question everything.
[59:39.360 --> 59:40.360]  Question info wars.
[59:40.360 --> 59:42.360]  Add your own research to it and then decide
[59:42.360 --> 59:44.360]  what you're going to promote to others
[59:44.360 --> 59:45.360]  and what new sources are accurate.
[59:45.360 --> 59:48.360]  I believe info wars is the best source out there.
[1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:03.360]  The far and own globalist media tells us
[1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:05.360]  there's no evidence of fraud.
[1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:08.360]  But John Bounds filed a 15-minute report
[1:00:08.360 --> 1:00:14.360]  that's at band.video that lays it all out.
[1:00:14.360 --> 1:00:16.360]  We're going to air like four minutes of it right now
[1:00:16.360 --> 1:00:18.360]  and come back and lay out the latest news
[1:00:18.360 --> 1:00:19.360]  on the other side of that.
[1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:21.360]  But the evidence of fraud ignored.
[1:00:21.360 --> 1:00:25.360]  Here it is from John Bowne and we'll be right back.
[1:00:25.360 --> 1:00:26.360]  Well, it's official America.
[1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:28.360]  Joe Biden has just been declared
[1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:32.360]  the first blatantly fraudulent president-elect of America.
[1:00:32.360 --> 1:00:35.360]  Joe Biden is now president-elect to Joe Biden
[1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:38.360]  and Senator Kamala Harris is now vice president-elect
[1:00:38.360 --> 1:00:40.360]  Kamala Harris.
[1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:41.360]  It's probably a good time for Republicans
[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:42.360]  to learn how to pronounce her name.
[1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:44.360]  This process has been tainted.
[1:00:44.360 --> 1:00:46.360]  And if you tainted for one party,
[1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:48.360]  you're tainted for the other party.
[1:00:48.360 --> 1:00:50.360]  If you tainted for one American,
[1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:52.360]  then you're tainted for all Americans.
[1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:54.360]  And we're not going to stand for this.
[1:00:54.360 --> 1:00:57.360]  What damage do you think that Trump will do
[1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:01.360]  between losing the election and the swearing,
[1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:04.360]  the inauguration of Joe Biden?
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:06.360]  Maybe you didn't phrase it quite that way,
[1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:08.360]  but that's how I heard it.
[1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:12.360]  And we knew that he would be up to mischief,
[1:01:12.360 --> 1:01:16.360]  separate and apart from trying to destroy
[1:01:16.360 --> 1:01:17.360]  the credibility of our elections,
[1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:20.360]  which we criticize other nations for doing,
[1:01:20.360 --> 1:01:24.360]  and now all enemies, foreign and domestic,
[1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:26.360]  making assault on our elections.
[1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:27.360]  Well, we have one domestic.
[1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:29.360]  But apart from that...
[1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:32.360]  The word transparency gets kicked around a lot,
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:34.360]  but there is nothing transparent about
[1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:37.360]  the disgraceful 2020 election process
[1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:40.360]  that blatantly crushed the will of the American people.
[1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:42.360]  And as expected, those votes did indeed
[1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:43.360]  close the gap for Joe Biden.
[1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:45.360]  Also, the numbers coming out of Green Bay, Wisconsin,
[1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:47.360]  went in favor of Joe Biden.
[1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:51.360]  They are still not in compliance.
[1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:53.360]  Our votes are being suppressed.
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:56.360]  We cannot count the votes properly.
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:02.360]  What's happening is they have moved the barrier up to 16,
[1:02:02.360 --> 1:02:05.360]  but they took away the ballot machines
[1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:07.360]  that were in the front row
[1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:09.360]  and moved them to the back of the building.
[1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:11.360]  The court order is in effect.
[1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:13.360]  They will not give us access,
[1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:15.360]  and the sheriff has decided not to come down here
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:17.360]  to enforce that court order.
[1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:21.360]  We're there, supposedly observing, but we can't see.
[1:02:21.360 --> 1:02:25.360]  We're further away than I am from you all here.
[1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:28.360]  Hundreds, at least 100 feet away from open ballots
[1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:30.360]  that go back out of our sight.
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:31.360]  We can't see them.
[1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:33.360]  We don't know what's happening to them.
[1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:36.360]  It's just, there's no way for us to meaningfully
[1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:39.360]  observe the process from where they have us.
[1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:42.360]  Tell us how many ballots approximately
[1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:45.360]  went through that process that you had no chance to observe?
[1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:47.360]  Based on the counts that we've heard,
[1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:50.360]  it's about 125,000, maybe more.
[1:02:50.360 --> 1:02:53.360]  The mummy, Biden, rose from his slumber
[1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:56.360]  to remind the American public of his insolence,
[1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:59.360]  fumbling giant words on the teleprompter
[1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:02.360]  in front of a crowd of corporatic ghost jeeps.
[1:03:02.360 --> 1:03:05.360]  I know watching these vote tallies on TV
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:08.360]  moves very slow and it's...
[1:03:08.360 --> 1:03:10.360]  Speaking of ghosts,
[1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:12.360]  of the many things Biden didn't mention
[1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:15.360]  was the overwhelming evidence of a ghost in the machine
[1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:17.360]  as Dominion Software,
[1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:20.360]  the second largest seller of voting machines,
[1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:23.360]  flooded our national election with glitches
[1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:25.360]  favoring Joe Biden.
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:29.360]  In Antrim County, ballots were counted for Democrats
[1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:31.360]  that were meant for Republicans,
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:36.360]  causing a 6,000-vote swing against our candidates.
[1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:39.360]  The county clerk came forward and said,
[1:03:39.360 --> 1:03:41.360]  tabulating software glitched
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:44.360]  and caused a miscalculation of the votes.
[1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:48.360]  Since then, we have now discovered that 47 counties
[1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:52.360]  use this same software in the same capacity.
[1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:55.360]  And there is also Benford's law.
[1:03:55.360 --> 1:03:57.360]  It has been used in criminal cases
[1:03:57.360 --> 1:03:59.360]  regarding election fraud in the United States
[1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:01.360]  at the federal, state and local levels.
[1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:03.360]  The law detected ballot stuffing
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:05.360]  in the 2009 Iranian elections,
[1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:08.360]  and the Washington Post reported on the instance
[1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:10.360]  of the 2016 Russian election,
[1:04:10.360 --> 1:04:13.360]  conforming purposefully to Benford's law
[1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:15.360]  in order to hide vote rigging.
[1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:19.360]  I've been active in this since 1958.
[1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:21.360]  That's 62 years.
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:26.360]  I am the angriest I have been in that entire six decades.
[1:04:26.360 --> 1:04:29.360]  You have a group of corrupt people
[1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:33.360]  who have absolute contempt for the American people,
[1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:36.360]  who believe that we are so spineless,
[1:04:36.360 --> 1:04:40.360]  so cowardly, so unwilling to stand up for ourselves,
[1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:42.360]  that they can steal the presidency
[1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:46.360]  and we'll wring our hands, bring in a few lawyers,
[1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:48.360]  and do nothing.
[1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:50.360]  The videos of incidents of...
[1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:51.360]  You know, this is important.
[1:04:51.360 --> 1:04:54.360]  I'm going to come back and finish this report on the other side.
[1:04:54.360 --> 1:04:56.360]  We've got two big remorse about the...
[1:04:56.360 --> 1:05:01.360]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:02.360]  And why is that?
[1:05:02.360 --> 1:05:04.360]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there,
[1:05:04.360 --> 1:05:07.360]  but a giant tree like bush grows from it
[1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:10.360]  that produces more mustard seeds.
[1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:13.360]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world
[1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:15.360]  to have amazing health effects.
[1:05:15.360 --> 1:05:16.360]  They didn't know why.
[1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:18.360]  Well, with modern science we know,
[1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:22.360]  it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of selenium.
[1:05:22.360 --> 1:05:25.360]  We have bio-true selenium sold out for months
[1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:29.360]  back in stock at infowarsstore.com
[1:05:29.360 --> 1:05:32.360]  at 50% off store-rived free shipping
[1:05:32.360 --> 1:05:34.360]  and triple the Patriot points.
[1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:38.360]  Biotrue selenium at infowarsstore.com
[1:05:38.360 --> 1:05:40.360]  is an amazing product,
[1:05:40.360 --> 1:05:43.360]  and it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:46.360]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[1:05:46.360 --> 1:05:48.360]  It is an essential nutrient in the body
[1:05:48.360 --> 1:05:50.360]  that you actually have to have.
[1:05:50.360 --> 1:05:53.360]  It's back in stock 50% off triple Patriot points
[1:05:53.360 --> 1:06:17.360]  at infowarsstore.com and with free shipping.
[1:06:17.360 --> 1:06:20.360]  Alright, I'm going to issue
[1:06:20.360 --> 1:06:23.360]  an emergency message to President Trump
[1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:26.360]  coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[1:06:26.360 --> 1:06:29.360]  And then I have a report that I'm going to issue
[1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:32.360]  a lot of research for it right before we went live today
[1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:35.360]  dealing with the ongoing COVID-19 lockdown
[1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:37.360]  and what's going to mean for you and your family.
[1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:40.360]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, but I want to explain something.
[1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:42.360]  They already had this COVID-19 lockdown
[1:06:42.360 --> 1:06:44.360]  cooked up with the Chinese to lock down the world
[1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:46.360]  and then to reopen China
[1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:48.360]  and have China bankrupt the planet.
[1:06:48.360 --> 1:06:51.360]  It doesn't be done under Hillary, even if Trump lost.
[1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:53.360]  But now they're going ahead
[1:06:53.360 --> 1:06:56.360]  whether it's not based on reality, it's so dangerous.
[1:06:56.360 --> 1:06:59.360]  We, the people, must reject it.
[1:06:59.360 --> 1:07:02.360]  Let me just show you some of the headlines
[1:07:02.360 --> 1:07:05.360]  right now on what's happening with COVID-19.
[1:07:05.360 --> 1:07:09.360]  Joe Biden's pandemic plan, mandatory national face mask,
[1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:12.360]  quote, paid sick leave
[1:07:12.360 --> 1:07:14.360]  so that anybody that tests positive goes home,
[1:07:14.360 --> 1:07:17.360]  even if you're not sick, to again have the economy shut down,
[1:07:17.360 --> 1:07:20.360]  restoring Obamacare and free COVID tests
[1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:23.360]  to again cause the shutdown.
[1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:28.360]  There's a real risk of third world war
[1:07:28.360 --> 1:07:32.360]  being unleashed, the head of the UK military,
[1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:35.360]  top general warrants.
[1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:38.360]  Interview with Sky TV,
[1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:40.360]  let's grab that interview, guys,
[1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:42.360]  with the UK's chief of defense staff,
[1:07:42.360 --> 1:07:44.360]  General Sir Rick Carter,
[1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:47.360]  has warned that the global economic meltdown
[1:07:47.360 --> 1:07:50.360]  caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to new security threats
[1:07:50.360 --> 1:07:53.360]  which in turn spark a new world war.
[1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:56.360]  And he points out that the third world's already collapsing
[1:07:56.360 --> 1:07:59.360]  from starvation from the COVID-19 lockdown,
[1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:02.360]  not from COVID-19, and millions have already died
[1:08:02.360 --> 1:08:04.360]  and hundreds of millions are set to starve to death,
[1:08:04.360 --> 1:08:07.360]  and that's going to cause huge resource wars
[1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:10.360]  in these countries.
[1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:13.360]  Empty bellies cause wars, though that collapses our borders.
[1:08:13.360 --> 1:08:16.360]  And then Joe Biden's going to sit back during this global crisis
[1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:18.360]  and say, give me all the power,
[1:08:18.360 --> 1:08:20.360]  we're going to keep the lockdown in place
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:23.360]  that causes it, and the left now loves war,
[1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:25.360]  loves torture, loves death,
[1:08:25.360 --> 1:08:27.360]  doesn't want to leave the Middle East,
[1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:30.360]  wants to stay in charge.
[1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:35.360]  What a twilight zone situation, folks.
[1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:38.360]  They couldn't kick Trump out with all the fake hearings
[1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:42.360]  and all the rushing aid, so they stole the election.
[1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:45.360]  And now the head of the UK military comes out
[1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:48.360]  and says, Katie, bar the door,
[1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:51.360]  this is going to cause a global meltdown and martial law.
[1:08:51.360 --> 1:08:55.360]  In fact, since you guys have Biden up there,
[1:08:55.360 --> 1:08:58.360]  I've got several of his clips here.
[1:08:58.360 --> 1:09:00.360]  Let's play these frauds.
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:02.360]  Let's play clip two.
[1:09:02.360 --> 1:09:05.360]  President-elect Joe Biden vows to usher in a time to heal
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:08.360]  in America, just a few minutes of it.
[1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:10.360]  And then Biden pledges to unify and not divide.
[1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:12.360]  Let's play that first.
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:14.360]  Biden pledges to unify and not divide.
[1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:16.360]  Then his surrogates to nothing but divide.
[1:09:16.360 --> 1:09:18.360]  They don't want the country to exist.
[1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:20.360]  And then Biden's message to Trump supporters.
[1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:22.360]  Let's play clip three and four
[1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:26.360]  before he brought out his chai-com agent son, Joe Biden.
[1:09:26.360 --> 1:09:28.360]  Talk about American humiliation.
[1:09:28.360 --> 1:09:30.360]  This is it. Here it is.
[1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:33.360]  And I'm humbled by the trust and confidence
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:36.360]  you placed in me.
[1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:38.360]  I pledge to be a president
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:40.360]  who seeks not to divide
[1:09:40.360 --> 1:09:42.360]  but unify.
[1:09:42.360 --> 1:09:45.360]  Who doesn't see red states and blue states
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:48.360]  only sees the United States.
[1:09:48.360 --> 1:09:50.360]  I hate the company's existence.
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:52.360]  I work with all my heart
[1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:54.360]  with the confidence
[1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:56.360]  of the whole people
[1:09:56.360 --> 1:09:58.360]  to win the confidence of all of you.
[1:09:58.360 --> 1:10:00.360]  And for that
[1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:04.360]  is what America, I believe, is about.
[1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:06.360]  It's about people.
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:10.360]  And that's what our administration will be all about.
[1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:12.360]  What a monster.
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:15.360]  I sought this office to restore the soul of America.
[1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:18.360]  To rebuild the backbone of this nation.
[1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:20.360]  The middle class.
[1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:22.360]  Everything he did was to ship our jobs to China.
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:24.360]  Everything he did was to sell us out.
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:26.360]  Everything he did was a big joke
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:28.360]  saying America's never coming back.
[1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:30.360]  And now he's like, don't be afraid.
[1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:32.360]  I'm going to take care of you. I'm going to fix the country.
[1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:34.360]  What a con man.
[1:10:34.360 --> 1:10:36.360]  He's going to make America proud
[1:10:36.360 --> 1:10:38.360]  while his surrogates just attack
[1:10:38.360 --> 1:10:40.360]  the very existence of the country
[1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:42.360]  and just try to make you slaves. Let's continue.
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:44.360]  Make America respected around the world again.
[1:10:44.360 --> 1:10:46.360]  Because, again,
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:48.360]  sold out to the entire world.
[1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:50.360]  But he's going to make America respected
[1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:52.360]  when he doesn't even believe America should exist.
[1:10:52.360 --> 1:10:54.360]  Continue.
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:56.360]  To unite us here at home
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:10:58.360]  is the honor of my lifetime
[1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:00.360]  that so many millions of Americans
[1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:02.360]  have voted for that vision
[1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:04.360]  and now the work
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:06.360]  of making that vision is real
[1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:08.360]  who voted for President Trump.
[1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:10.360]  I understand the disappointment tonight.
[1:11:10.360 --> 1:11:12.360]  I've lost a couple of times myself.
[1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:14.360]  But now,
[1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:16.360]  let's give each other a chance.
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:18.360]  Lower your guards.
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:20.360]  I'm going to stab you hard.
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:22.360]  Leave this higher.
[1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:24.360]  It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric.
[1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:26.360]  Don't want your guns.
[1:11:26.360 --> 1:11:28.360]  Lower the temperature.
[1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:30.360]  See each other again. Listen to each other again.
[1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:32.360]  Lay down.
[1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:34.360]  Make progress.
[1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:36.360]  Stop treating our opponents as our enemies.
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:38.360]  They are not our enemies.
[1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:40.360]  They are Americans.
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:42.360]  They are Americans.
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:46.360]  You're the Patriots outside Hongan.
[1:11:46.360 --> 1:11:48.360]  Bob will tell us to everything there is a season,
[1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:50.360]  a time to build,
[1:11:50.360 --> 1:11:52.360]  a time to reap and a time to sow
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:54.360]  and a time to heal.
[1:11:54.360 --> 1:12:00.360]  This is the time to heal in America.
[1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:02.360]  This deceiver wants you to lower your defenses
[1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:04.360]  so I can save him in private.
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:06.360]  Ryan with the Nazis is about to stab the guy to death.
[1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:08.360]  He's about to win.
[1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:10.360]  He goes, oh no, I'm your friend.
[1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:12.360]  The guy goes, oh you're my friend, the Nazi stabs him.
[1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:14.360]  That's all this is.
[1:12:14.360 --> 1:12:16.360]  That's all this is.
[1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:18.360]  You don't have to believe me.
[1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:20.360]  What I've told you has been almost completely true.
[1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:22.360]  I've made mistakes. I've admitted to it.
[1:12:22.360 --> 1:12:24.360]  I've been so honest, I tell you.
[1:12:24.360 --> 1:12:26.360]  Cops put me over there. They've been drinking the out of that bottle of wine.
[1:12:26.360 --> 1:12:28.360]  Boom, you're arrested.
[1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:30.360]  Because I'm like neurotic about the truth, folks.
[1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:32.360]  That guy,
[1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:34.360]  because I literally cannot, I'm like George Washington.
[1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:36.360]  I wasn't earlier in my life.
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:38.360]  I didn't tell a lot of lies, but I'd lie about stuff.
[1:12:38.360 --> 1:12:40.360]  Like a girlfriend, like are you cheating on me?
[1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:42.360]  No, honey.
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:44.360]  You know, my mom, like you steal 50 bucks out of my purse?
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:46.360]  No, mommy.
[1:12:46.360 --> 1:12:48.360]  When I was 12 years old.
[1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:50.360]  But I haven't told a lie consciously in many years now.
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:52.360]  That guy
[1:12:52.360 --> 1:12:54.360]  spends his whole life lying
[1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:56.360]  and lying and lying and everything
[1:12:56.360 --> 1:12:58.360]  he tells you is a lie.
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:02.360]  And now he wants to sit there
[1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:04.360]  and get you to believe him
[1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:06.360]  so you'll chump up to the table and say
[1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:08.360]  God, it's scary. He won.
[1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:10.360]  But under Stockholm syndrome, he wants you to Stockholm syndrome.
[1:13:10.360 --> 1:13:12.360]  Oh, he's going to be nice to me now.
[1:13:16.360 --> 1:13:18.360]  He said that laptop wasn't real.
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:20.360]  Later he said it didn't matter.
[1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:22.360]  He said he didn't want to ban fracking or any oil stuff.
[1:13:22.360 --> 1:13:24.360]  He said he wants to ban it all.
[1:13:24.360 --> 1:13:26.360]  He said he didn't want your guns. He says ban them all.
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:28.360]  You know he's a liar.
[1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:32.360]  He's an empty, disgusting
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:34.360]  pus bucket that they're preparing to remove.
[1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:36.360]  And then Kamala Harris will probably bring Hillary Clinton in.
[1:13:38.360 --> 1:13:40.360]  What a time to be alive.
[1:13:40.360 --> 1:13:42.360]  What a time to be alive. I just know this.
[1:13:42.360 --> 1:13:44.360]  Thank God for you, the viewers and listeners.
[1:13:44.360 --> 1:13:46.360]  And I mean that. And that's not me patting you on the head.
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:48.360]  That's not me patting you on the head.
[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:50.360]  You knew it was going down
[1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:52.360]  and you supported us through thick and thin.
[1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:54.360]  And now everybody else is shut down and we're not.
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:56.360]  And out of night, we have millions
[1:13:56.360 --> 1:13:58.360]  and millions of new listeners.
[1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:00.360]  Tuned in to hear the truth.
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:02.360]  Tuned in to get the truth out.
[1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:04.360]  Everybody else fell. Everybody else sold out.
[1:14:04.360 --> 1:14:06.360]  Everybody else didn't get it.
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:08.360]  Everybody else didn't make provisions.
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:10.360]  But we built the arc.
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:12.360]  You built the arc.
[1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:14.360]  We built this system. This crew built the system.
[1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:16.360]  And I salute the crew.
[1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:18.360]  I support our radio affiliates,
[1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:20.360]  our TV affiliates, our few sponsors
[1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:22.360]  and our supporters that buy the products
[1:14:22.360 --> 1:14:24.360]  because you change the world forever.
[1:14:26.360 --> 1:14:28.360]  And whether we're supposed to be like the Alamo
[1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:30.360]  and go forward and be destroyed in this fight
[1:14:32.360 --> 1:14:34.360]  or whether we are victorious,
[1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:36.360]  it doesn't matter because it's all before God
[1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:40.360]  and God's looking down to see what decisions
[1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:42.360]  we make right now.
[1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:44.360]  Of course,
[1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:46.360]  Biden is the king of Pinocchio.
[1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:48.360]  He is the king
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:50.360]  long-nosed Pinocchio, but that's okay.
[1:14:50.360 --> 1:14:52.360]  He's a slave of evil.
[1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:54.360]  He's a joke. His whole family's a joke.
[1:14:54.360 --> 1:14:56.360]  Thank God every day you're the Hunter Biden.
[1:14:56.360 --> 1:14:58.360]  Thank God you'd be a lone truck driver
[1:14:58.360 --> 1:15:00.360]  barely paying his bills or a school teacher
[1:15:00.360 --> 1:15:02.360]  or a doctor or a farmer.
[1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:04.360]  As long as you've got a connection to God,
[1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:06.360]  you've got all the wealth in the universe
[1:15:06.360 --> 1:15:08.360]  compared to these people and I want to thank you
[1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:10.360]  and I appreciate you.
[1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:12.360]  We're going to come back and I'm going to hit
[1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:14.360]  some other big news.
[1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:16.360]  I was coming on with the COVID lockdown part two
[1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:20.360]  and then I've got my emergency message to
[1:15:20.360 --> 1:15:22.360]  president.
[1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:24.360]  I've got my emergency breakdown of the COVID-19 lockdown
[1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:26.360]  and then Owen Troyer
[1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:28.360]  is coming in here live.
[1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:30.360]  He's live and he's strong
[1:15:32.360 --> 1:15:34.360]  and he's preparing to deploy
[1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:36.360]  on a four-day trip to DC
[1:15:36.360 --> 1:15:38.360]  and lead a massive caravan
[1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:40.360]  and you can join it
[1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:42.360]  and if you decide to join it,
[1:15:42.360 --> 1:15:44.360]  send a message to the globalists
[1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:46.360]  that they are in deep trouble.
[1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:48.360]  Everybody always wanted to march on DC.
[1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:50.360]  It's here.
[1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:52.360]  When the chips are down,
[1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:54.360]  what are you going to do now? Stay with us.
[1:15:56.360 --> 1:15:58.360]  We're only here on air
[1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:00.360]  facing the globalist onsots,
[1:16:00.360 --> 1:16:02.360]  the DMC funded lawsuits
[1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:04.360]  and everything that's happening because of you.
[1:16:04.360 --> 1:16:06.360]  We've built the only truly multimedia
[1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:08.360]  content film organization in the world
[1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:10.360]  that promotes the truth against the globalist.
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:12.360]  We've had a devastating effect.
[1:16:12.360 --> 1:16:14.360]  We're a national treasure, you're a national treasure
[1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:16.360]  for supporting us and so go get a t-shirt.
[1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:18.360]  Go get a historic t-shirt.
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:20.360]  We've got a funny one that's the
[1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:22.360]  Biden groping a woman.
[1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:24.360]  It's a woman's design shirt. My wife really likes it.
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:26.360]  She sent me this gift. It's pretty cute. Here it is.
[1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:28.360]  It's a little historic thing.
[1:16:28.360 --> 1:16:30.360]  I think Trump's going to win but if Biden's able to steal it,
[1:16:30.360 --> 1:16:32.360]  we'll be probably shut down pretty quick
[1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:34.360]  so it'll be a historic thing to have.
[1:16:34.360 --> 1:16:36.360]  Biden is the third dimension on the street
[1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:38.360]  with graffiti, with hand bills you hand out
[1:16:38.360 --> 1:16:40.360]  and with non-compliance, not paying taxes
[1:16:40.360 --> 1:16:42.360]  and pulling your kids out of the schools
[1:16:42.360 --> 1:16:44.360]  and just making it a full-time job
[1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:46.360]  to expose and fight and obstruct
[1:16:46.360 --> 1:16:48.360]  the criminal foreign takeover of America.
[1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:50.360]  We've gotten to that point. Biden's we're nursing home.
[1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:52.360]  I hope to retire Biden and that be a collector's item.
[1:16:52.360 --> 1:16:54.360]  Get it while you still can. We're not ordering more.
[1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:56.360]  infowarstore.com
[1:16:56.360 --> 1:16:58.360]  The problem with social Darwinism is
[1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:00.360]  the so-called elites,
[1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:02.360]  the most cunning, smart,
[1:17:02.360 --> 1:17:04.360]  kind of people
[1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:06.360]  believe that
[1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:08.360]  chivalry doesn't exist anymore. They don't believe
[1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:10.360]  it being aristocrats.
[1:17:10.360 --> 1:17:12.360]  They try to hold up civilization and empower the people.
[1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:14.360]  And once the establishment has that predatory idea,
[1:17:14.360 --> 1:17:16.360]  civilization collapses very, very quickly.
[1:17:16.360 --> 1:17:18.360]  You can't treat the least of us
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:20.360]  like garbage and not treat your own family like that.
[1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:22.360]  And so it is this lack of empathy
[1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:24.360]  that's going to destroy us.
[1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:26.360]  The globalists can try to be
[1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:28.360]  heartless devil worshipers that commit
[1:17:28.360 --> 1:17:30.360]  rituals of all sorts of
[1:17:30.360 --> 1:17:32.360]  horrible crimes, try to get away from a humanity.
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:34.360]  But really, they can't escape the laws
[1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:36.360]  of the universe. They may train themselves
[1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:38.360]  to commit heinous crimes
[1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:40.360]  and not feel it themselves.
[1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:42.360]  But the repercussions of what they commit
[1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:44.360]  always comes back on them and their families
[1:17:44.360 --> 1:17:46.360]  and the very structure itself.
[1:17:46.360 --> 1:17:48.360]  Wealth is created by loving God.
[1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:50.360]  Wealth is created by having a connection to God.
[1:17:50.360 --> 1:17:52.360]  God is the source of all creation,
[1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:54.360]  all success, all power.
[1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:56.360]  If you deny that, you'll be destroyed.
[1:17:56.360 --> 1:17:58.360]  Two info wars best selling products
[1:17:58.360 --> 1:18:00.360]  are now back in stock for big sold out for months.
[1:18:00.360 --> 1:18:02.360]  Biotruce, selenium from the mustard seed,
[1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:04.360]  essential in all electrochemical activity
[1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:06.360]  of the cells in the body.
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:08.360]  That's every human activity.
[1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:10.360]  And on top of it,
[1:18:10.360 --> 1:18:12.360]  body's ultimate turmeric formula
[1:18:12.360 --> 1:18:14.360]  with 95 percent incuminoid.
[1:18:14.360 --> 1:18:16.360]  Lady competitors have 3 to 5 percent
[1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:18.360]  of the things that turmeric does.
[1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:20.360]  I don't have to tell you, this is the highest quality,
[1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:22.360]  the strongest you're going to find.
[1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:24.360]  So both these are amazing products
[1:18:24.360 --> 1:18:26.360]  and they fund the info war,
[1:18:26.360 --> 1:18:28.360]  which is a 360 win.
[1:18:28.360 --> 1:18:30.360]  On top of it, despite the factor in demand
[1:18:30.360 --> 1:18:32.360]  they've been sold out for months,
[1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:34.360]  they're both 50 percent off
[1:18:34.360 --> 1:18:36.360]  triple patriot points
[1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:38.360]  and free shipping at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:38.360 --> 1:18:40.360]  That's Biotruce selenium
[1:18:40.360 --> 1:18:42.360]  from the mustard seed.
[1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:44.360]  It's amazing and on top of it
[1:18:44.360 --> 1:18:46.360]  we also have body's ultimate turmeric formula
[1:18:46.360 --> 1:18:48.360]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:50.360]  This cell will not last long.
[1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:52.360]  I want to thank you all for your support
[1:18:52.360 --> 1:18:54.360]  really to try these products.
[1:18:54.360 --> 1:18:56.360]  They really, really work at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:26.360]  You're doing on the apps as well
[1:19:26.360 --> 1:19:28.360]  including having apps turn on
[1:19:28.360 --> 1:19:30.360]  and listen to what you're saying
[1:19:30.360 --> 1:19:32.360]  just like Siri or Alexa do
[1:19:32.360 --> 1:19:34.360]  and then putting databases, transcripts
[1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:36.360]  of everything you say
[1:19:36.360 --> 1:19:38.360]  into those systems to be saved forever.
[1:19:38.360 --> 1:19:40.360]  Your phone is spying on you
[1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:42.360]  and companies are generating secret surveillance scores
[1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:44.360]  based on information.
[1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:46.360]  This is the global Chinese communist social credit score.

[1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:02.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:16.360 --> 1:20:18.360]  I'm sorry the universe works this way
[1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:20.360]  but it does.
[1:20:20.360 --> 1:20:22.360]  You see
[1:20:22.360 --> 1:20:24.360]  there's always predators
[1:20:24.360 --> 1:20:26.360]  there's always people
[1:20:26.360 --> 1:20:28.360]  that seek to take advantage of you
[1:20:28.360 --> 1:20:30.360]  and most
[1:20:30.360 --> 1:20:32.360]  human civilizations
[1:20:32.360 --> 1:20:34.360]  get taken over by them
[1:20:34.360 --> 1:20:36.360]  and they never get off the ground
[1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:38.360]  because the thugs destroy them
[1:20:38.360 --> 1:20:40.360]  but other systems
[1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:42.360]  get set up
[1:20:42.360 --> 1:20:44.360]  and western civilization
[1:20:44.360 --> 1:20:46.360]  is a great example of that
[1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:48.360]  and over time
[1:20:48.360 --> 1:20:50.360]  people begin to resent
[1:20:50.360 --> 1:20:52.360]  the guardians of their freedom
[1:20:52.360 --> 1:20:54.360]  and they begin to resent the bell of rights
[1:20:54.360 --> 1:20:56.360]  the constitution
[1:20:56.360 --> 1:20:58.360]  the systems that protect them
[1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:00.360]  and they begin to hate those
[1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:02.360]  and call for an end to them.
[1:21:02.360 --> 1:21:04.360]  They don't care they've ever been to communist China
[1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:06.360]  they don't care they've ever been to North Korea
[1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:08.360]  they don't care they've never been
[1:21:08.360 --> 1:21:10.360]  inside the EU bureaucracy
[1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:12.360]  they want America gone
[1:21:12.360 --> 1:21:14.360]  because their professor taught them
[1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:16.360]  that they got an A plus
[1:21:16.360 --> 1:21:18.360]  and they said America shouldn't exist
[1:21:18.360 --> 1:21:20.360]  and capitalism was bad.
[1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:22.360]  They didn't care
[1:21:22.360 --> 1:21:24.360]  that all the big billionaires
[1:21:24.360 --> 1:21:26.360]  other than Trump
[1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:28.360]  literally are tax exempt
[1:21:28.360 --> 1:21:30.360]  offshore and aren't service based
[1:21:30.360 --> 1:21:32.360]  and make money off interest
[1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:34.360]  and want you enslaved.
[1:21:34.360 --> 1:21:36.360]  They don't care that Bill Joy writes
[1:21:36.360 --> 1:21:38.360]  articles about it
[1:21:38.360 --> 1:21:40.360]  and Bill Gates writes articles about it
[1:21:40.360 --> 1:21:42.360]  they don't care about opposition research
[1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:44.360]  they don't care about white papers
[1:21:44.360 --> 1:21:46.360]  they don't care about facts
[1:21:48.360 --> 1:21:50.360]  they just believe because the media
[1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:52.360]  told them you're going to rule
[1:21:52.360 --> 1:21:54.360]  and you're going to get some free stuff
[1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:56.360]  because you take over society
[1:21:56.360 --> 1:21:58.360]  and you take over the culture
[1:21:58.360 --> 1:22:00.360]  and they sit back they go I'm going to be in charge
[1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:02.360]  oh yes
[1:22:02.360 --> 1:22:04.360]  you want to bring in unlimited third world populations
[1:22:04.360 --> 1:22:06.360]  you're smart
[1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:08.360]  you want to sterilize little boys
[1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:10.360]  you're good
[1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:12.360]  you want to get rid of the churches in Christianity
[1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:14.360]  you're a winner
[1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:16.360]  and they go I'm a winner
[1:22:16.360 --> 1:22:18.360]  you know people tell me
[1:22:18.360 --> 1:22:20.360]  oh on the street
[1:22:20.360 --> 1:22:22.360]  yesterday when I was outside
[1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:24.360]  for four or five hours different events
[1:22:24.360 --> 1:22:26.360]  people come up and say F.U. Jones
[1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:28.360]  you're leaders out of office
[1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:30.360]  ha ha ha
[1:22:30.360 --> 1:22:32.360]  and I'd be like well that's not really true
[1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:34.360]  but they think like persecuting me
[1:22:34.360 --> 1:22:36.360]  makes me get upset
[1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:38.360]  do you know what happened to Imphil Wars
[1:22:38.360 --> 1:22:40.360]  after Trump got elected
[1:22:40.360 --> 1:22:42.360]  Alex Jones basically stopped
[1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:44.360]  getting paychecks
[1:22:44.360 --> 1:22:46.360]  I mean I got some pretty good paychecks
[1:22:46.360 --> 1:22:48.360]  was the reason I was doing this but I did like to save some money
[1:22:48.360 --> 1:22:50.360]  take care of all the lawsuits
[1:22:50.360 --> 1:22:52.360]  do everything but Trump came along
[1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:54.360]  and the days of Alex building
[1:22:54.360 --> 1:22:56.360]  this big operation and
[1:22:56.360 --> 1:22:58.360]  hiring all this crew and having all this extra money
[1:22:58.360 --> 1:23:00.360]  and being able to fund all these other organizations
[1:23:00.360 --> 1:23:02.360]  and groups that nobody ever knew about
[1:23:02.360 --> 1:23:04.360]  because I didn't want the credit
[1:23:04.360 --> 1:23:06.360]  that all ended
[1:23:06.360 --> 1:23:08.360]  the day I signed on
[1:23:08.360 --> 1:23:10.360]  with Donald John Trump all I got
[1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:12.360]  was pain
[1:23:12.360 --> 1:23:14.360]  but I knew that was the way to go
[1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:16.360]  the old World War II saying
[1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:18.360]  both my grandfathers were in World War II
[1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:20.360]  in Europe
[1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:22.360]  my dad's dad always said
[1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:24.360]  oh I was a army officer
[1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:26.360]  sure went to A&M
[1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:28.360]  but I was just I managed like food supply
[1:23:28.360 --> 1:23:30.360]  and stuff he'd ever told
[1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:32.360]  us he flew 22 missions over Germany
[1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:34.360]  out of North Africa and Italy
[1:23:34.360 --> 1:23:36.360]  and how he got injured
[1:23:36.360 --> 1:23:38.360]  and then the next day his crew went out
[1:23:38.360 --> 1:23:40.360]  they all died blown up over Germany
[1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:42.360]  till he died we got his letters
[1:23:42.360 --> 1:23:44.360]  and his manual and the whole nine yards
[1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:46.360]  but they had a saying then
[1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:48.360]  the other one was a fighter pilot
[1:23:48.360 --> 1:23:50.360]  crashed almost died in England
[1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:52.360]  my mom's dad
[1:23:52.360 --> 1:23:54.360]  they had a saying though
[1:23:54.360 --> 1:23:56.360]  they'd ever radar back then
[1:23:56.360 --> 1:23:58.360]  England had it a little bit limited but the planes didn't have it
[1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:00.360]  there wasn't satellite back then
[1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:02.360]  they're flying in over Germany
[1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:04.360]  and you know where they do how to fly
[1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:06.360]  the Germans would put up their guns
[1:24:06.360 --> 1:24:08.360]  their flak guns the shrapnel guns
[1:24:08.360 --> 1:24:10.360]  they'd go up and explode
[1:24:10.360 --> 1:24:12.360]  inhaling metal
[1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:14.360]  they would encircle the factories
[1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:16.360]  the military bases with guns
[1:24:16.360 --> 1:24:18.360]  and they'd set off these big tar systems
[1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:20.360]  to create black smoke
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:22.360]  so they flew towards the black smoke
[1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:24.360]  and towards the explosions
[1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:26.360]  and they would fly in under orders
[1:24:26.360 --> 1:24:28.360]  imagine you're ordered to fly in
[1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:30.360]  to artillery attacking you
[1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:32.360]  and you fly in
[1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:34.360]  and hope you get a shot
[1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:36.360]  as best dead reckoning on the map
[1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:38.360]  to drop your bombs
[1:24:38.360 --> 1:24:40.360]  so if my grandfather
[1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:42.360]  could get into B-17 as the captain
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:44.360]  and strap himself in in Africa
[1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:46.360]  and launch that thing
[1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:48.360]  and go in with no radar no nothing
[1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:50.360]  but a compass and point himself
[1:24:50.360 --> 1:24:52.360]  towards the gunfire
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:54.360]  I can sure as hell do what I'm doing right now
[1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:56.360]  because I've got all these gears
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:24:58.360]  all these tracking systems all these gauges
[1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:00.360]  all this intel
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:02.360]  and we're doing an amazing job thanks to your support
[1:25:04.360 --> 1:25:06.360]  and so the enemy's always like
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:08.360]  how do you like it getting attacked?
[1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:10.360]  you like that?
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:14.360]  I'm like well I don't like it
[1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:16.360]  but I can feel it
[1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:18.360]  because it's right when I'm getting the most attacked
[1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:20.360]  that I drop the bombs
[1:25:22.360 --> 1:25:24.360]  and then I can look down
[1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:26.360]  and see the explosions below
[1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:28.360]  through the black smoke and know
[1:25:28.360 --> 1:25:30.360]  you nailed your dirty
[1:25:30.360 --> 1:25:32.360]  ass
[1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:34.360]  and that's what I want listeners to get
[1:25:34.360 --> 1:25:36.360]  nothing is gained
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:38.360]  without a fight
[1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:40.360]  nothing is gained without struggle
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:42.360]  no freedom
[1:25:42.360 --> 1:25:44.360]  we have is free
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:46.360]  none of it
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:48.360]  and the minute you start to figure that out
[1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:50.360]  the world gets a lot better from them
[1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:52.360]  you bow down to Bill Gates
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:54.360]  you bow down to Jeff Bezos
[1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:56.360]  you bow down to Tim Cook
[1:25:56.360 --> 1:25:58.360]  you bow down to any of these monsters
[1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:00.360]  and all you gets hell
[1:26:00.360 --> 1:26:02.360]  because they've made the selfish
[1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:04.360]  elitist decision
[1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:06.360]  that you are scum
[1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:08.360]  and you're there to be fed
[1:26:08.360 --> 1:26:10.360]  on by them
[1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:14.360]  I love to be on this live show and I'm live right now
[1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:16.360]  at 526 central time
[1:26:18.360 --> 1:26:20.360]  but right before I went live
[1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:22.360]  before the crew was here
[1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:24.360]  I shot two reports and gave it all I have
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:26.360]  the facts
[1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:28.360]  on what President Trump needs to do
[1:26:28.360 --> 1:26:30.360]  and how he should concede
[1:26:30.360 --> 1:26:32.360]  and how Joe Biden has a
[1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:34.360]  martial law plan for you and your family
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:36.360]  first we're going to air my emergency
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:38.360]  message to President Trump
[1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:40.360]  only way it gets amplified
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:42.360]  only way it gets bat signaled
[1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:44.360]  only way it gets Paul Revere is you
[1:26:44.360 --> 1:26:46.360]  that's next segment
[1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:48.360]  and then
[1:26:48.360 --> 1:26:50.360]  I have Joe Biden's
[1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:52.360]  announced martial law plan
[1:26:52.360 --> 1:26:54.360]  to bring America to its knees
[1:26:54.360 --> 1:26:56.360]  a foreign army
[1:26:56.360 --> 1:26:58.360]  if it rolled in with tanks and weapons
[1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:00.360]  we'd all get up and kick their ass
[1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:02.360]  but if it's done through the UN
[1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:04.360]  the Democratic party to permanently lock us down
[1:27:04.360 --> 1:27:06.360]  and claim it's all for mask
[1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:08.360]  if it's all for this virus
[1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:10.360]  we would fall
[1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:12.360]  we must not comply
[1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:14.360]  it's the final assault
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:16.360]  it's the takeover and it's here
[1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:18.360]  and I believe in you
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:20.360]  put pressure on your governors
[1:27:20.360 --> 1:27:22.360]  put pressure on your legislators
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:24.360]  before Joe Biden announces this Tuesday
[1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:26.360]  or Wednesday
[1:27:26.360 --> 1:27:28.360]  it's a permanent lockdown
[1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:30.360]  and it's coming
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:32.360]  small businesses will be shut down
[1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:34.360]  the big corporations will be kept open
[1:27:34.360 --> 1:27:36.360]  this is a consolidation
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:38.360]  of vertical integration
[1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:40.360]  and just don't ever spend money with the big banks again
[1:27:40.360 --> 1:27:42.360]  don't ever spend money with the big corporations again
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:44.360]  because they're vertically integrating you
[1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:46.360]  and they're attacking you and support those local radio stations
[1:27:46.360 --> 1:27:48.360]  and please support them for wars

[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:36.360]  coming up
[1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:38.360]  my emergency message to President Trump
[1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:40.360]  then, Joe Biden's plan
[1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:42.360]  to finally destroy America
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:44.360]  have you learned it's not hype
[1:28:44.360 --> 1:28:46.360]  Joe Biden is a chai-com globalist
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:48.360]  agent planning to end the country
[1:28:48.360 --> 1:28:50.360]  and bankrupt you and make you a financial slave
[1:28:50.360 --> 1:28:52.360]  if you're aware of it

[1:28:56.360 --> 1:28:58.360]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read
[1:28:58.360 --> 1:29:00.360]  if you want your children to listen to you
[1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:02.360]  whisper
[1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:04.360]  and it's true a lot of times
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:06.360]  if somebody's shouting and yelling
[1:29:06.360 --> 1:29:08.360]  even if what they're talking about is important
[1:29:08.360 --> 1:29:10.360]  people tend to tune it out
[1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:12.360]  you know why I know that?
[1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:14.360]  because I'm Alex Jones
[1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:16.360]  and I've been pretty obnoxious over the years
[1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:18.360]  because I'm worried about the new world order
[1:29:18.360 --> 1:29:20.360]  and I read about all their plans
[1:29:20.360 --> 1:29:22.360]  to lock down civilization
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:24.360]  start the third world and then enslave
[1:29:24.360 --> 1:29:26.360]  the first world
[1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:28.360]  so I've been really really loud and really really aggressive
[1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:30.360]  and we've had a big effect
[1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:32.360]  but now it's time to think about
[1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:34.360]  every different angle
[1:29:34.360 --> 1:29:36.360]  and every different way we can get people to think
[1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:38.360]  for themselves before it's too late
[1:29:38.360 --> 1:29:40.360]  the lockdown
[1:29:40.360 --> 1:29:42.360]  social distancing
[1:29:42.360 --> 1:29:44.360]  the mask is meant to end human civilization
[1:29:44.360 --> 1:29:46.360]  we are under a civilization
[1:29:46.360 --> 1:29:48.360]  collapse weapon
[1:29:48.360 --> 1:29:50.360]  so this is live and death

[1:29:52.360 --> 1:29:54.360]  and band our video and watch our live election coverage
[1:29:56.360 --> 1:29:58.360]  look it up for yourself
[1:29:58.360 --> 1:30:00.360]  the head of the devos group issued a report
[1:30:00.360 --> 1:30:02.360]  one six months ago calling for
[1:30:02.360 --> 1:30:04.360]  world government to be openly
[1:30:04.360 --> 1:30:06.360]  established to respond to COVID-19
[1:30:06.360 --> 1:30:08.360]  and the COVID-19 was a blessing
[1:30:08.360 --> 1:30:10.360]  to lower the planet's carbon footprint
[1:30:10.360 --> 1:30:12.360]  since then Prince Charles
[1:30:12.360 --> 1:30:14.360]  and countless others have come out
[1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:16.360]  and said the exact same thing
[1:30:16.360 --> 1:30:18.360]  the most ancient form
[1:30:18.360 --> 1:30:20.360]  of total war is called
[1:30:20.360 --> 1:30:22.360]  siege
[1:30:22.360 --> 1:30:24.360]  and that's when you cut people off
[1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:26.360]  from their resources
[1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:28.360]  that's when you lock them down
[1:30:28.360 --> 1:30:30.360]  and this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalist
[1:30:30.360 --> 1:30:32.360]  or just get rid of Donald Trump
[1:30:32.360 --> 1:30:34.360]  that's only part of it
[1:30:34.360 --> 1:30:36.360]  this is siege to literally train us to be poor
[1:30:36.360 --> 1:30:38.360]  that's so then
[1:30:38.360 --> 1:30:40.360]  the globalist social engineers
[1:30:40.360 --> 1:30:42.360]  can dictate how we live our lives
[1:30:42.360 --> 1:30:44.360]  with the social credit score
[1:30:44.360 --> 1:30:46.360]  surveillance script
[1:30:46.360 --> 1:30:48.360]  so you've heard the US Army saying
[1:30:48.360 --> 1:30:50.360]  our job is to kill people and break things
[1:30:50.360 --> 1:30:52.360]  well that's what the lockdown's doing
[1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:54.360]  it's starving the third world
[1:30:54.360 --> 1:30:56.360]  millions and millions of death
[1:30:56.360 --> 1:30:58.360]  it's breaking down the supply chain in society
[1:30:58.360 --> 1:31:00.360]  it's their mission
[1:31:00.360 --> 1:31:02.360]  the days of hell
[1:31:02.360 --> 1:31:04.360]  the nightmare is here

[1:31:12.360 --> 1:31:14.360]  and social media tech giants
[1:31:14.360 --> 1:31:16.360]  are all now
[1:31:16.360 --> 1:31:18.360]  being deployed by the archaic
[1:31:18.360 --> 1:31:20.360]  inbred crooked establishment
[1:31:20.360 --> 1:31:22.360]  to interfere with the
[1:31:22.360 --> 1:31:24.360]  2020 US elections
[1:31:24.360 --> 1:31:26.360]  remove the populist champion
[1:31:26.360 --> 1:31:28.360]  of the people, Donald J. Trump
[1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:30.360]  and install the decrepit
[1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:32.360]  perverted traitorous
[1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:34.360]  establishment puppet Joe Biden
[1:31:34.360 --> 1:31:36.360]  along with
[1:31:36.360 --> 1:31:38.360]  rabid radical hag Kamala Harris

[1:33:31.540 --> 1:33:32.940]  trump do not concede.
[1:33:33.440 --> 1:33:36.640]  There's over a million people conservatively on our streams over a
[1:33:36.640 --> 1:33:38.040]  million listening on radio stations.
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:41.440]  That's two million people conservatively.
[1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:42.340]  I love you.
[1:33:42.340 --> 1:33:43.640]  I appreciate you're amazing.

[1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:48.940]  If you decide to spread this video, the president will wake up and say,
[1:33:48.940 --> 1:33:50.440]  no, if you don't, we're doomed.
[1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:51.740]  Here is the report.
[1:33:51.940 --> 1:33:56.740]  Next report is on Obama's minion Joe Biden's plan for martial law.
[1:33:57.340 --> 1:33:58.140]  President Trump.
[1:33:58.140 --> 1:34:02.540]  You were about to be approached by Joe Biden and his new covid 19
[1:34:02.540 --> 1:34:03.140]  commission.
[1:34:03.340 --> 1:34:06.440]  They're going to tell you that sir, you're going to be blamed for the
[1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:07.740]  hundreds of thousands of deaths.
[1:34:07.740 --> 1:34:12.540]  Unless you sign on to a new lockdown, contact tracing and even people being
[1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:15.540]  taken from their homes and forced inoculations.
[1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:19.440]  When you sign on to that, you'll be confirming that covid 19 was your
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:24.240]  fault and legitimizing the martial law takedown of this country and the
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:25.640]  complete shutdown of our economy.
[1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:30.040]  This will be the end of the republic and you sir will be known as benedict
[1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:31.440]  Arnold who allowed it all to happen.
[1:34:31.440 --> 1:34:40.440]  President Trump, you survived at least four previous illegal coups.
[1:34:41.340 --> 1:34:43.940]  You were illegally spied on during your campaign.
[1:34:44.140 --> 1:34:47.140]  Everyone knows about the illegal fraud of Russia gate, Ukraine gate,
[1:34:47.240 --> 1:34:48.740]  the fake impeachment and more.
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:52.740]  And now the very same corporate media that's so discredited.
[1:34:52.740 --> 1:34:55.140]  It's so low that is the enemy of the American people.
[1:34:55.140 --> 1:34:59.640]  As you've rightfully said, has announced that you're the loser and you
[1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:03.040]  have rightfully gone to those states where there is overwhelming clear
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:07.840]  evidence pouring out that there was organized criminal fraud by big city
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:12.040]  corrupt machines, but your own internal advisors and others are telling
[1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:12.840]  you stand down.
[1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:16.840]  You're being congratulated by George W. Bush that.
[1:35:16.840 --> 1:35:17.940]  Oh, you made a good showing.
[1:35:17.940 --> 1:35:18.540]  Step down.
[1:35:19.140 --> 1:35:23.540]  If you do that, they're going to set you up and destroy your legacy and
[1:35:23.540 --> 1:35:27.240]  blame you for covid 19 and then destroy this republic.
[1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:30.340]  If you stand up and fight back hard.
[1:35:30.740 --> 1:35:35.440]  It is they that will be destroyed, not you and not America, Bill Gates,
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:40.640]  the United Nations, the Wuhan lab, Fauci are all on record running that
[1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:44.340]  facility and as soon as they knew that you were about to beat the fake
[1:35:44.340 --> 1:35:48.240]  impeachment, they rolled out the hysteria and the fear that we witnessed.
[1:35:49.140 --> 1:35:52.340]  You took the right action, not knowing how deadly it was and shut down
[1:35:52.340 --> 1:35:57.340]  flights from China because their plan all along was to blame you for it.
[1:35:57.640 --> 1:36:01.340]  Then once it spread to the United States and began killing Americans,
[1:36:01.640 --> 1:36:04.840]  they turned around and said that you were to blame.
[1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:10.240]  That's why it's so essential for you now to not concede the election,
[1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:15.140]  but to come out with your bully pulpit of the Oval Office and lay out the
[1:36:15.140 --> 1:36:19.540]  Newsweek articles and the new scientist articles and all the documents that
[1:36:19.540 --> 1:36:25.640]  Fauci and Gates under Obama's command before you ever got into office in
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:34.340]  2013, 14 and 15 were running the very exact covid 19 weaponized virus test
[1:36:34.540 --> 1:36:36.140]  at Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[1:36:36.340 --> 1:36:39.340]  And then when that was made illegal because of protest by the scientific
[1:36:39.340 --> 1:36:43.040]  community, it was moved to communist China at Wuhan.
[1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:47.040]  I know the viewers of this emergency video and the White House and even
[1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:50.640]  the president are asking Jones, we know about what happened with covid and
[1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:51.940]  the UN Chinese power grab.
[1:36:51.940 --> 1:36:52.940]  Why are you telling us about it?
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:36:57.040]  Instead of getting into the election fraud in Pennsylvania, the election fraud
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:00.540]  in Georgia, the election fraud in Michigan and Nevada and Arizona.
[1:37:00.740 --> 1:37:06.040]  Why Jones you covering covid because sir, I want you and your advisors to
[1:37:06.040 --> 1:37:11.540]  know what they're planning to do to drive you from office before January
[1:37:11.540 --> 1:37:16.040]  20th and how they're planning to then blame you for covid 19.
[1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:20.640]  That's been their plan all along if they're able to trick you, then your
[1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:25.940]  legacy and all your supporters will be irrevocably connected to the covid 19
[1:37:25.940 --> 1:37:30.640]  deaths and the American people will be persecuted and Americanism itself
[1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:35.140]  will be demonized connected to the Wuhan virus, which is a Chinese
[1:37:35.140 --> 1:37:38.540]  communist by a weapon Joe Biden who's already had the entire corporate
[1:37:38.540 --> 1:37:43.540]  media blaming you, President Trump and the American people for covid 19 with
[1:37:43.540 --> 1:37:46.440]  all of their testing and all of their hysteria and all their false
[1:37:46.440 --> 1:37:47.140]  positives.
[1:37:47.740 --> 1:37:51.840]  They are going to come out and form early this week Joe Biden's new
[1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:57.540]  coronavirus task force that task force made up of UN Bill Gates, Chai
[1:37:57.540 --> 1:38:04.040]  Com operators like Fauci and others will call for an extended undefined
[1:38:04.040 --> 1:38:10.140]  lockdown face mask for at least two more years and a shutdown of the
[1:38:10.140 --> 1:38:14.240]  economy as well as forced inoculations as soon as they're ready.
[1:38:15.140 --> 1:38:19.340]  Then they will demand that you who is still president elected under the
[1:38:19.340 --> 1:38:22.040]  Constitution implement these plans.
[1:38:22.540 --> 1:38:26.940]  If you do not immediately agree, they're going to say that 260 plus
[1:38:26.940 --> 1:38:32.340]  thousand most of deaths as you know from something else are on your watch
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:38.140]  and are on your head and that you are guilty of this under the 25th
[1:38:38.140 --> 1:38:41.940]  amendment and are not fit to be the president of the United States.
[1:38:42.140 --> 1:38:46.940]  They want to further discredit you not just with this fraudulent election,
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:50.940]  but to certify that fraudulent election by having your own cabinet
[1:38:50.940 --> 1:38:54.840]  remove you under the 25th amendment because you don't follow the
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:39:00.040]  recommendations and orders of Joe Biden's new globalist covid 19 task
[1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:00.440]  force.
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:01.440]  And here's the problem.
[1:39:02.140 --> 1:39:05.640]  If you follow the lockdown, they will put your name on the coming
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:10.540]  depression in the United States and blame you for all the previous
[1:39:10.540 --> 1:39:14.740]  deaths saying later you actually admitted that you were the one behind
[1:39:14.740 --> 1:39:15.140]  it all.
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:19.840]  Again, if you don't sign on to it, you've got to come out and expose
[1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:25.040]  Fauci, Bill Gates, Joe Biden and all of them in Oval Office addresses.
[1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:27.840]  And that is the only path to stop them.
[1:39:28.440 --> 1:39:30.240]  They're going to have Jared Kushner approach you.
[1:39:30.340 --> 1:39:32.840]  They're going to have others come to you and say, listen, we're ready to
[1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:33.340]  make a deal.
[1:39:33.340 --> 1:39:35.540]  Trump, we won't destroy your legacy.
[1:39:36.140 --> 1:39:40.540]  We won't blame you for covid, but you've got to admit you were wrong
[1:39:41.040 --> 1:39:44.740]  and you've got to do what Biden says and you've got to let us take
[1:39:44.740 --> 1:39:45.240]  control.
[1:39:45.640 --> 1:39:48.540]  President Trump, the mainstream media has choreographed all of this.
[1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:50.740]  They have fraudulently blamed you for covid 19.
[1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:52.240]  The American people do not believe it.
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:53.040]  They know the truth.
[1:39:53.140 --> 1:39:54.340]  They elect you overwhelmingly.
[1:39:54.540 --> 1:39:58.440]  And so this new fifth coup of election fraud is designed to take you out.
[1:39:58.740 --> 1:40:02.740]  If you comply, if you quote, take the olive branch of the neocons and
[1:40:02.740 --> 1:40:07.040]  Mitt Romney and George W. Bush and say, okay, I'll follow the recommendations
[1:40:07.040 --> 1:40:11.540]  of President elect Joe Biden to lock things down to wear the mask to
[1:40:11.540 --> 1:40:15.240]  take inoculations and for contact tracers, they will then turn around
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:18.540]  later and admit that you were repudiated and the deaths were your
[1:40:18.540 --> 1:40:22.140]  fault and legitimize the persecution of your supporters.
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:25.740]  Mr. President, I know you care about America and I know you stood
[1:40:25.740 --> 1:40:29.940]  against their four previous coups, but now this fifth coup needs your
[1:40:29.940 --> 1:40:34.340]  mental will to say no, hold the course and let all the election fraud
[1:40:34.540 --> 1:40:37.640]  now being documented come out so the American people have a chance to
[1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:42.140]  rally behind you and to come to your aid and their own aid and save the
[1:40:42.140 --> 1:40:42.740]  Republic.
[1:40:42.940 --> 1:40:44.540]  We are waiting for leadership.
[1:40:44.740 --> 1:40:46.940]  We need the address from the Oval Office.
[1:40:47.040 --> 1:40:50.540]  We need you to reconfirm in the face of Fox News and the other sellout
[1:40:50.540 --> 1:40:55.240]  traders that you are never going to concede to fraud and sell out the
[1:40:55.240 --> 1:40:56.940]  election system in this country.
[1:40:57.040 --> 1:40:59.540]  We know you're our champion and we stand behind you.
[1:40:59.540 --> 1:41:02.540]  President Trump, you have rightfully pointed out the statistics from
[1:41:02.540 --> 1:41:06.340]  the UN itself that the lockdown was too intense, so strong and has
[1:41:06.340 --> 1:41:09.440]  already caused millions to die and tens of millions are on the verge
[1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:10.240]  of starvation.
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:14.040]  You have come out and pointed out that you can never defeat a virus
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:17.140]  by staying locked up in your house that only herd immunity and
[1:41:17.140 --> 1:41:18.740]  therapeutics is the answer.
[1:41:19.240 --> 1:41:24.240]  And now President Trump, we have the head of the UK military, their
[1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:29.040]  Secretary of Defense, their chairman of their Joint Chiefs of their
[1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:33.740]  defense staff, General Sir Nick Carter coming out and saying this
[1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:37.740]  lockdown could trigger World War III and there's an extreme danger
[1:41:37.740 --> 1:41:40.940]  of it and that another lockdown is not needed.
[1:41:41.440 --> 1:41:44.940]  Mr. President, we need you to point out the millions that are starving
[1:41:44.940 --> 1:41:49.440]  to death, the collapse of borders and what this is doing to good
[1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:50.740]  governance around the world.
[1:41:50.940 --> 1:41:55.040]  The big megabanks, the big corporations want to have a crisis to consolidate
[1:41:55.040 --> 1:41:55.640]  control.
[1:41:55.640 --> 1:41:57.140]  They want to destroy middle classes.
[1:41:57.140 --> 1:42:00.140]  You've been a champion of the middle classes and we need you to come
[1:42:00.140 --> 1:42:05.640]  out in daily Oval Office announcements behind that resolute desk
[1:42:05.740 --> 1:42:07.440]  and be the true commander in chief.
[1:42:07.740 --> 1:42:10.840]  America is really concerned that you've only been seen two times
[1:42:10.940 --> 1:42:13.240]  since the election fraud of November 3rd.
[1:42:13.340 --> 1:42:17.940]  Only you can call out the people of America to support you and to
[1:42:17.940 --> 1:42:19.640]  peacefully stand against this tyranny.
[1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:22.640]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of
[1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:23.240]  their country.
[1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:26.440]  For all of you watching, not just the White House and law enforcement
[1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:28.040]  security agencies around the world.
[1:42:28.440 --> 1:42:31.340]  I also want to encourage you to remember, despite the fact that big
[1:42:31.340 --> 1:42:34.440]  tech censorship has basically silenced everyone else's voice.
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:38.940]  We're still on air at infowars.com for its last show and band on video.
[1:42:39.240 --> 1:42:43.040]  We're making major announcements later this evening about massive
[1:42:43.040 --> 1:42:46.440]  caravans from all corners of the United States descending on
[1:42:46.440 --> 1:42:51.040]  Washington DC in the next few days led by infowars.com and more
[1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:52.140]  action we're about to take.
[1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:54.640]  Mr. President, we don't just have your back.
[1:42:54.640 --> 1:42:56.140]  We've got America's back.
[1:42:56.140 --> 1:42:59.640]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired, even
[1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:02.840]  worshiped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations.
[1:43:03.140 --> 1:43:06.340]  With modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[1:43:06.540 --> 1:43:08.340]  It's antioxidant effect.
[1:43:08.340 --> 1:43:10.640]  It's anti-inflammatory effect.
[1:43:10.940 --> 1:43:13.340]  Everything it does is simply amazing.
[1:43:13.540 --> 1:43:17.140]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[1:43:17.140 --> 1:43:21.940]  They're three to five percent curculinoid, but we have bodies
[1:43:21.940 --> 1:43:27.540]  ultimate turmeric formula with a 95 percent curculinoid level.

[1:43:58.240 --> 1:43:59.340]  amongst the left.
[1:43:59.440 --> 1:44:03.640]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:44:03.740 --> 1:44:07.140]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[1:44:07.140 --> 1:44:10.740]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from
[1:44:10.740 --> 1:44:15.140]  infowarsstore.com studies have suggested that fish oils and
[1:44:15.140 --> 1:44:18.840]  fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure,
[1:44:18.840 --> 1:44:22.940]  decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque
[1:44:23.040 --> 1:44:26.840]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses
[1:44:26.940 --> 1:44:29.040]  and joints and the digestive system.
[1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:34.140]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:38.340]  can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[1:44:38.440 --> 1:44:40.540]  and activity of immune cells.
[1:44:40.740 --> 1:44:45.040]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm
[1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:49.240]  discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.

[1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:31.640]  the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[1:45:31.740 --> 1:45:34.140]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit
[1:45:34.140 --> 1:45:37.740]  of action, you can override them, have the app and then tell
[1:45:37.740 --> 1:45:39.940]  others about it so they can get the app.
[1:45:39.940 --> 1:45:42.640]  So it's up to you whether you wanted to find big tech and

[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:46.740]  on Twitter, on YouTube.
[1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:49.840]  However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[1:45:57.140 --> 1:45:59.340]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of
[1:45:59.340 --> 1:46:02.040]  civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[1:46:02.140 --> 1:46:03.440]  One is born of Renaissance.
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:04.940]  The other is born of conquest.
[1:46:05.240 --> 1:46:08.340]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused
[1:46:08.340 --> 1:46:12.640]  people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity, art
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:13.940]  and skill and strength.
[1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:17.940]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls
[1:46:18.440 --> 1:46:19.940]  with a tiny elite above it.
[1:46:20.740 --> 1:46:24.340]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos
[1:46:24.340 --> 1:46:28.640]  of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high tech slavery.
[1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:31.040]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded
[1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:32.240]  of slavery when it wasn't.
[1:46:32.440 --> 1:46:35.040]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the
[1:46:35.040 --> 1:46:37.040]  facts that they are truly the slave masters.
[1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:39.140]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:41.640]  It is already causing millions and millions of starved
[1:46:41.640 --> 1:46:42.140]  deaths.
[1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:44.140]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[1:46:44.540 --> 1:46:47.140]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England
[1:46:47.140 --> 1:46:50.140]  and a top general have come out and said the COVID lockdown
[1:46:50.140 --> 1:46:52.440]  is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:53.240]  That's the facts.
[1:46:53.240 --> 1:46:55.440]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[1:46:55.440 --> 1:47:13.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:17.840]  I come to you with horrifying and grave news, but I don't come
[1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:19.440]  to you with this information to scare you.
[1:47:20.340 --> 1:47:24.240]  I respect you and I believe that you deserve to know the truth
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:29.540]  of what we're facing President elect Joe Biden, who has been
[1:47:29.540 --> 1:47:31.840]  announced by the corporate media and all the big banks and
[1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:34.540]  the chai comms to be our new president, despite all the
[1:47:34.540 --> 1:47:39.840]  fraud is openly preparing a task force in his own press releases
[1:47:40.440 --> 1:47:45.740]  that is calling for an endless permanent lockdown, endless
[1:47:45.740 --> 1:47:49.940]  face mask, COVID-19 tracking and tracing and forced
[1:47:49.940 --> 1:47:55.140]  inoculations about to lay out this information for you and
[1:47:55.140 --> 1:47:58.640]  your family when Joe Biden says he wants love and reconciliation.
[1:47:59.240 --> 1:48:02.940]  Remember that everything he's told you previously is a giant
[1:48:03.140 --> 1:48:06.440]  bald face line and remember the establishment.
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:10.340]  The most corrupt corporation is the world are steamrolling him
[1:48:10.540 --> 1:48:14.440]  to install him as the first dictator of the United States.
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:17.740]  Now is when the real work begins.
[1:48:17.740 --> 1:48:23.340]  The hard work, the necessary work, the good work, the essential
[1:48:23.340 --> 1:48:26.640]  work to save lives and beat this epidemic.
[1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:30.440]  The UK's chief of the defense staff, General Sir Nick Carter
[1:48:30.540 --> 1:48:32.940]  has warned that the global economic meltdown caused by
[1:48:32.940 --> 1:48:36.140]  the COVID-19 lockdown pandemic may lead to new security
[1:48:36.140 --> 1:48:39.640]  threats, which in turn may spark a new world war.
[1:48:40.140 --> 1:48:42.740]  First off on this emergency Sunday night transmission.
[1:48:43.340 --> 1:48:46.240]  Let me show you an article posted on infowars.com with
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:49.040]  direct links to the Ministry of Defense in the UK.
[1:48:49.940 --> 1:48:52.940]  There's a real risk of third world war being unleashed.
[1:48:52.940 --> 1:48:57.640]  Top UK general says and he says because of the COVID-19
[1:48:57.640 --> 1:48:59.540]  lockdowns, their secretary of defense.
[1:49:00.540 --> 1:49:03.040]  It's already starved millions of death and it's already
[1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:07.940]  triggering giant wars in the third and first world that could
[1:49:08.140 --> 1:49:13.040]  escalate very easily in a domino effect into World War three.
[1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:16.340]  Well, it just so turns out the communist Chinese and others
[1:49:16.540 --> 1:49:19.040]  are on record with Bill Gates admitting that they're trying
[1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:22.040]  to lower the world's carbon footprint and destroy everybody
[1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:25.240]  else's industries who locked down because they're good guys
[1:49:25.340 --> 1:49:28.240]  and want to defeat the virus and then only communist China
[1:49:28.340 --> 1:49:30.240]  and the globalist holdings are left operating.
[1:49:30.840 --> 1:49:35.640]  The problem is that the population is growing the fastest
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:38.840]  where people are less able to deal with it.
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:41.740]  So it's in the very poorest places.
[1:49:41.740 --> 1:49:45.240]  The individuals that Joe Biden is nominating for his COVID-19
[1:49:45.240 --> 1:49:48.640]  Task Force are on record working for Bill Gates in the U.N.
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:51.540]  and they openly admit they want forced inoculations,
[1:49:51.540 --> 1:49:55.040]  contact tracers and individuals that come to your home and
[1:49:55.040 --> 1:49:58.040]  even break up your family and take you away to COVID centers.
[1:49:58.740 --> 1:50:01.440]  This isn't some nightmare science fiction movie.
[1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:04.440]  This is the reality of what's happening and Bill Gates is on
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:07.040]  record just a few weeks ago saying the lockdown is going to
[1:50:07.040 --> 1:50:09.840]  last 10 years until you go back to normal.
[1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:12.540]  Remember it was going to be 15 days because the hospitals
[1:50:12.540 --> 1:50:14.740]  were full, but they weren't that it'd be two months that it
[1:50:14.740 --> 1:50:17.140]  would be six months that it'd be two years that it'd be five
[1:50:17.140 --> 1:50:19.540]  years and now they're telling you it's forever.
[1:50:19.940 --> 1:50:26.140]  The only way we'll get completely back to normal is by having
[1:50:26.340 --> 1:50:29.940]  not maybe not the first generation vaccines, but eventually
[1:50:29.940 --> 1:50:34.240]  a vaccine that is super effective and that a lot of the
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:39.540]  people take and that we get the disease eliminated on a good
[1:50:39.540 --> 1:50:41.040]  on a global basis.
[1:50:41.940 --> 1:50:47.140]  That is where we can finally start taking all the problems
[1:50:47.140 --> 1:50:49.840]  that have been created in education mental health and
[1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:53.240]  start to build back in a positive way.
[1:50:53.440 --> 1:50:56.440]  It's not COVID-19 that's triggering global starvation.
[1:50:56.840 --> 1:50:59.740]  It's not COVID-19 that's triggering a global depression.
[1:50:59.940 --> 1:51:03.140]  It's not COVID-19 that experts believe could trigger a new
[1:51:03.140 --> 1:51:05.540]  world war and have already started countless conflicts.
[1:51:05.940 --> 1:51:09.340]  It is the lockdown used built around the fraud of
[1:51:09.340 --> 1:51:11.440]  COVID-19 the empty hospitals.
[1:51:11.440 --> 1:51:14.340]  They said were filled all people that died of other diseases.
[1:51:14.340 --> 1:51:16.940]  They put the COVID column the fact that most of the test or
[1:51:16.940 --> 1:51:21.240]  false positive and the rate of infection increases while the
[1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:23.040]  rate of death stays very, very small.
[1:51:23.440 --> 1:51:25.640]  They told us 5% of the population will be dead.
[1:51:25.740 --> 1:51:28.640]  They told us 2.5 million than 2.3 million Americans will be
[1:51:28.640 --> 1:51:28.940]  dead.
[1:51:29.040 --> 1:51:30.540]  They told us a half million Brits will be dead.
[1:51:30.740 --> 1:51:32.240]  None of it was true.
[1:51:32.640 --> 1:51:36.440]  It was part of putting us under a martial law system ahead
[1:51:36.440 --> 1:51:39.840]  of taking out nation states run by populist and nationalist
[1:51:39.840 --> 1:51:42.240]  like Donald Trump, Bolsonaro and others.
[1:51:42.540 --> 1:51:45.740]  So let that sink in that the head of the UK military is
[1:51:45.740 --> 1:51:49.140]  coming out and admitting that the COVID-19 lockdown is
[1:51:49.140 --> 1:51:51.240]  bringing our world towards total destruction.
[1:51:51.640 --> 1:51:55.040]  How worried are you that the global economic crisis brought
[1:51:55.040 --> 1:51:59.240]  on by coronavirus could lead to new security threats
[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:00.640]  potentially even war?
[1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:04.040]  Yes, and I think you know we're living at a moment in time
[1:52:04.040 --> 1:52:07.340]  where the world is a very uncertain and anxious place.
[1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:12.040]  And of course the dynamic of global competition is a feature
[1:52:12.040 --> 1:52:13.040]  of our lives as well.
[1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:15.440]  And I think the real risk we have with quite a lot of the
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:18.040]  regional conflicts that are going on at the moment is you
[1:52:18.040 --> 1:52:21.040]  could see escalation lead to miscalculation.
[1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:23.740]  So what that means is that the is that the protagonists
[1:52:23.740 --> 1:52:25.940]  either because they don't realize the implications of their
[1:52:25.940 --> 1:52:29.640]  actions lead to an escalation, which means that more people
[1:52:29.640 --> 1:52:31.940]  perhaps get involved, more weaponry gets involved.
[1:52:31.940 --> 1:52:36.440]  And before you can contain it, it leads to the sides ending
[1:52:36.440 --> 1:52:37.840]  up in a full blown war.
[1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:41.040]  And if you look back at the last century before both world
[1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:44.340]  wars, I think it was unarguable that there was escalation
[1:52:44.340 --> 1:52:47.140]  that led to the miscalculation, which ultimately led to war
[1:52:47.140 --> 1:52:49.040]  at a scale we would hopefully never see again.
[1:52:49.440 --> 1:52:51.340]  Now here's where President Trump comes in.
[1:52:51.940 --> 1:52:55.140]  Joe Biden is forming his new commission made up of a bunch
[1:52:55.140 --> 1:52:58.640]  of Bill Gates and UN alumni that are going to blame President
[1:52:58.640 --> 1:53:01.040]  Trump for what happened with COVID-19.
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:04.040]  Despite the fact that you and admits they help cover up the
[1:53:04.040 --> 1:53:07.040]  fact that China is where COVID-19 came from and that's
[1:53:07.040 --> 1:53:08.540]  where the initial spread took place.
[1:53:08.840 --> 1:53:13.040]  Joe Biden's transition team today released a nightmare list
[1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:16.040]  of information to market watch about what they're planning
[1:53:16.040 --> 1:53:17.540]  to do in it.
[1:53:18.040 --> 1:53:21.040]  They say we're going to have a quasi permanent lockdown that
[1:53:21.040 --> 1:53:23.540]  they turn up and dial back whenever they want.
[1:53:23.540 --> 1:53:27.040]  We've all got to have a federal mask mandate, even more mask
[1:53:27.040 --> 1:53:31.040]  in our houses that contact tracers will be coming into our
[1:53:31.040 --> 1:53:34.040]  homes and that forced inoculations are about to take
[1:53:34.040 --> 1:53:35.040]  place.
[1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:38.040]  But because those inoculations they admit won't work because
[1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:41.040]  you can't get antibodies for COVID-19 because it's such an
[1:53:41.040 --> 1:53:45.040]  alien virus they've engineered that permanently you're going
[1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:47.540]  to have to stay in your home when they say so.
[1:53:48.040 --> 1:53:51.040]  We're going to act to get COVID under control on day one of
[1:53:51.040 --> 1:53:55.040]  my presidency, I'll put an action, a plan I've been taking
[1:53:55.040 --> 1:53:58.040]  about talking about for months already laid out, a national
[1:53:58.040 --> 1:54:02.040]  mandate, mask wearing, social distancing, testing, tracing,
[1:54:02.040 --> 1:54:07.040]  all things as President Obama just said that should have
[1:54:07.040 --> 1:54:10.040]  been put in place months and months ago.
[1:54:10.040 --> 1:54:13.040]  They're now coming out and saying President Trump is to
[1:54:13.040 --> 1:54:16.040]  blame for COVID-19, hoping he doesn't challenge it.
[1:54:16.040 --> 1:54:19.040]  Saying that if Trump doesn't give control 70 plus days
[1:54:19.040 --> 1:54:23.040]  before he leaves office to Joe Biden, he will be blamed for
[1:54:23.040 --> 1:54:26.040]  any future COVID deaths.
[1:54:26.040 --> 1:54:29.040]  Even if President Trump does that they're going to turn around
[1:54:29.040 --> 1:54:32.040]  and say see he admits he's wrong, his previous response was
[1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:34.040]  bad, it's his fault.
[1:54:34.040 --> 1:54:37.040]  If he does turn over the administration, which no
[1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:41.040]  presidents ever done, months early it sets an incredibly
[1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:45.040]  dangerous precedent as well and now Trump will be signing
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:49.040]  his legacy on to the endless lockdown and the depression
[1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:51.040]  and the worldwide collapse that's being engineered by the
[1:54:51.040 --> 1:54:55.040]  globalists to consolidate power and control on record.
[1:54:55.040 --> 1:54:58.040]  And then they're still going to blame Trump and say he's the
[1:54:58.040 --> 1:54:59.040]  one to blame.
[1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:03.040]  The only path out of this is the hard core steel truth that
[1:55:03.040 --> 1:55:07.040]  will smash through their lies and that's that Fauci and the
[1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:10.040]  U.M. of Bill Gates cooked this up, they released it, they
[1:55:10.040 --> 1:55:13.040]  created the fear, they got it in the United States, they
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:16.040]  hyped it up, they exaggerated it, they created the hysteria
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:20.040]  and now they intend to never turn loose of the weapon they
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:23.040]  released and they're going to blame the populist president
[1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:26.040]  they launched it on for being the one that allowed it to
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:27.040]  take place.
[1:55:27.040 --> 1:55:31.040]  That is true destruction and inversion of the truth and it
[1:55:31.040 --> 1:55:34.040]  must be rejected because this is a trillion times bigger
[1:55:34.040 --> 1:55:35.040]  than President Trump.
[1:55:35.040 --> 1:55:39.040]  This is about all of our lives and our future and stopping this
[1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:43.040]  medical big pharma tyranny takeover that's happening now.
[1:55:43.040 --> 1:55:46.040]  Don't believe me, go to infowars.com and read the quotes
[1:55:46.040 --> 1:55:51.040]  from Biden's new U.N.-backed COVID-19 task force and above
[1:55:51.040 --> 1:55:54.040]  his comments, I have my own comment and here's what I had
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:55.040]  to say.
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:58.040]  If you want to have a martial law takeover, you want to use
[1:55:58.040 --> 1:56:01.040]  medical systems to do it because those are the most respected
[1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:04.040]  and studies show people will submit to that more.
[1:56:04.040 --> 1:56:07.040]  Then you create a manmade virus that spreads very well that's
[1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:10.040]  not very deadly but that reinfects and then you announce
[1:56:10.040 --> 1:56:13.040]  that no one can ever have their freedoms back until it's
[1:56:13.040 --> 1:56:16.040]  totally eradicated and that you take the vaccine.
[1:56:16.040 --> 1:56:18.040]  Then they tell you, sorry, the vaccine's never going to work
[1:56:18.040 --> 1:56:21.040]  either so you just got to have restrictions of where you go
[1:56:21.040 --> 1:56:24.040]  and what you do forever with these apps that control the
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:27.040]  track your whole life, the social credit score and that's
[1:56:27.040 --> 1:56:28.040]  the takeover.
[1:56:28.040 --> 1:56:30.040]  Then they start announcing but we are going to send contact
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:33.040]  treasures to your house and take you away if you don't submit
[1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:36.040]  to the medical protocols we're going to carry out that don't
[1:56:36.040 --> 1:56:37.040]  even protect you.
[1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:39.040]  That's the total takeover plan they can turn on and turn off
[1:56:39.040 --> 1:56:42.040]  for every election for total control.
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:45.040]  The Info Wars has the biggest audiences right now.
[1:56:45.040 --> 1:56:48.040]  We've ever had despite the censorship and I'm not happy
[1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:49.040]  about that.
[1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:52.040]  People are tuned in because we predicted they steal the
[1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:53.040]  election from Trump.
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:55.040]  We predicted forced seduction.
[1:56:55.040 --> 1:56:59.040]  We predicted contact tracers and films I made 13 years ago
[1:56:59.040 --> 1:57:02.040]  because we're going off the globalist own plans.
[1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:06.040]  So President Trump, you must address from the Oval Office
[1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:07.040]  this fraud.
[1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:08.040]  You must take on Fauci.
[1:57:08.040 --> 1:57:10.040]  You must take on Gates.
[1:57:10.040 --> 1:57:12.040]  I know they're coming to you and saying we won't blame you
[1:57:12.040 --> 1:57:13.040]  for the deaths.
[1:57:13.040 --> 1:57:17.040]  We'll protect your entire legacy if you roll over to us but
[1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:20.040]  they want to destroy the American people's legacy and
[1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:22.040]  they're going to betray you.
[1:57:22.040 --> 1:57:24.040]  You know they've been lying about you for five years.
[1:57:24.040 --> 1:57:27.040]  You know they're frauds and the only way out of this is for
[1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:31.040]  you to not concede and to expose these criminals now more
[1:57:31.040 --> 1:57:32.040]  than you've ever done.
[1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:35.040]  Only you can cut through the censorship and propaganda.
[1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:39.040]  Only you can awaken the sleeping giant and now is the time
[1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:42.040]  because they are again in all these news articles announcing
[1:57:42.040 --> 1:57:46.040]  permanent lockdowns, forced inoculations, masked forever.
[1:57:46.040 --> 1:57:49.040]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media what
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:52.040]  am I most proud of when it comes to the show and it's the fact
[1:57:52.040 --> 1:57:55.040]  that info wars more than 25 years ago doing basic research
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:57:58.040]  with what the club of Rome and the CFR and others were
[1:57:58.040 --> 1:58:02.040]  actually saying developed the hypothesis that communist China
[1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:05.040]  had been set up to take our jobs and transform to China and
[1:58:05.040 --> 1:58:08.040]  then make us economically destitute and position us into
[1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:09.040]  debt.
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:12.040]  Well now China owns the debt, now China owns Hollywood, all
[1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:14.040]  the one side of trading deals.
[1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:17.040]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on but again
[1:58:17.040 --> 1:58:18.040]  it wasn't that hard.
[1:58:18.040 --> 1:58:22.040]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing but still
[1:58:22.040 --> 1:58:25.040]  others didn't want to focus on that issue we did and you
[1:58:25.040 --> 1:58:28.040]  focused on it by supporting us at info wars.
[1:58:28.040 --> 1:58:31.040]  So when you go to info wars store.com and get all the great
[1:58:31.040 --> 1:58:34.040]  supplements, books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air
[1:58:34.040 --> 1:58:37.040]  filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that
[1:58:37.040 --> 1:58:40.040]  literally helped make up the world what's really happening.
[1:58:40.040 --> 1:58:42.040]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[1:58:42.040 --> 1:59:08.040]  Thank you for your support.
