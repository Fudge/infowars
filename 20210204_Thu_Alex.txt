[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[00:07.000 --> 00:09.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:09.000 --> 00:14.000]  It's Thursday, February 4th, the year is 2021.
[00:14.000 --> 00:17.000]  Dr. Steve Pacenek is going to face the music.
[00:17.000 --> 00:18.000]  We really appreciate him.
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.000]  He has a lot of courage coming up in hour number two.
[00:21.000 --> 00:36.000]  Stay with us.
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.000]  Man, come on, man.
[00:37.000 --> 00:39.000]  I ain't finna go Alex Jones level with y'all.
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.000]  Man, come on, man.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  What y'all like?
[00:42.000 --> 00:43.000]  Wake up!
[00:43.000 --> 00:45.000]  I want people to wake up right now.
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  I want people to listen to me and just come out of your trance.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.000]  White male!
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  So, Alex Jones' whole brand is based on the idea.
[00:55.000 --> 00:58.000]  He's giving you the real story, not the fake news out there.
[00:58.000 --> 00:59.000]  Hey, listen.
[00:59.000 --> 01:00.000]  I'm here to warn people.
[01:00.000 --> 01:01.000]  You keep telling me to shut up.
[01:01.000 --> 01:02.000]  This isn't a game.
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  Humanity is awakening.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  InfoWars.com.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:08.000 --> 01:09.000]  The tyrants did it.
[01:09.000 --> 01:10.000]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.000]  Mao took the guns.
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  if you're proud to take our firearm.
[01:18.000 --> 01:19.000]  Alex Jones.
[01:19.000 --> 01:20.000]  InfoWars.com.
[01:20.000 --> 01:21.000]  I just don't know who you are.
[01:21.000 --> 01:22.000]  You guys know who he is?
[01:22.000 --> 01:23.000]  You know Alex Jones.
[01:23.000 --> 01:24.000]  That's InfoWars.
[01:24.000 --> 01:25.000]  Great popular.
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  InfoWars.
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.000]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:31.000 --> 01:32.000]  We know we're under attack.
[01:32.000 --> 01:33.000]  We know it.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  We're breaking the conditioning.
[01:35.000 --> 01:36.000]  Ah!
[01:36.000 --> 01:37.000]  Ah!
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.000]  Talking about Alex Jones.
[01:39.000 --> 01:40.000]  InfoWars.
[01:40.000 --> 01:41.000]  Alex Jones.
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.000]  InfoWars.
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.000]  Alex Jones.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  Ah!
[01:48.000 --> 01:49.000]  That's just level one.
[01:49.000 --> 01:50.000]  What's level two?
[01:50.000 --> 01:51.000]  I'll tell you.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  The animated contest of Liberty is waiting for you.
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  But you've got to take in your business.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  You've got to have the will to accept the truth
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  and bust the system and the group collection.
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  Do that and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[02:08.000 --> 02:23.000]  This is the InfoWars.
[02:23.000 --> 02:26.000]  The following was written by Dr. Gad Sad
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  about the narcissism and grandiosity of celebrities.
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  Let me explain yet again the source
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  for all the platitudinous virtue signaling.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  The truly privileged elites know that deep down,
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  they are frauds.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  They suffer from existential guilt.
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  Hence, one of the ways by which they assuage
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  the guilt albatross around their necks
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  is to demonstrate to the world
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  that they are truly compassionate,
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  truly loving, truly caring, truly profound.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  Hence, they love all undocumented immigrants.
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.000]  They love Mother Earth.
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.000]  They love the ozone layer.
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  They love BLM.
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.000]  They love socialism.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  They love inner cities.
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  They hate the gentrification of neighborhoods.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  They love mentors of color.
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  They cherish diversity.
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  They love LGBTQ movies.
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  They adore queer architecture.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  They are better than you.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  More caring, more cultured, more empathetic.
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  This permits them to sleep better at night.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  See, I'm not a fraud.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  I may be a gargantuan parasitic hedge fund BSR,
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  but I really care.
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  I may be an overpaid BS actor,
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  but I fight for solar panels.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  Those fly over rubes, you know, down there,
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  deserve their lot in life.
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  They are racists who bed their siblings.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  We are science supporters who fight
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  against Mother Earth rapists
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  while flying in our private jets.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  It is a classic ego-defensive strategy
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  that permits the ruling class to exist
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  within their fractured selves.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  And if decent people don't wake up
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  against what is taking place,
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  you will wake up and say,
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  what happened to my liberties?
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  Stop giving your support to the parasites,
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  cowards and traders in pop culture.
[04:17.000 --> 04:18.000]  Support the truth.
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  Support the new renaissance.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  Support the information war.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  in the info war and say,
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  I don't know what's going to happen to me into this,
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  but you want to fight, you better believe,
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  you got one!
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  From the front lines of the information war,
[04:43.000 --> 05:02.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  infowars.com,
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  newswars.com,
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  band.video,
[05:19.000 --> 05:21.000]  and hundreds of other URLs we've launched
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.000]  have been banned.
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  That's why every month we launch
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  a new URL
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  before they ban it.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  But Soros and Bill Gates
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  and the globalists are on our tail.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  But the new website is
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  theresistance.video,
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  theresistance.video.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  They're trying to block us because the truth
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  is powerful and can defeat them.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  So the new URL that links
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  right to band.video and all of our videos
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  and all of our documentaries
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  and all the special reports
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  and all the suppressed information
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  is at theresistance.video.
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.000]  Share the link.
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  Theresistance.video.
[05:57.000 --> 06:15.000]  Theresistance.video.
[06:15.000 --> 06:17.000]  You are being conditioned and prepared to live under
[06:17.000 --> 06:21.000]  permanent, big tech,
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  big pharma,
[06:23.000 --> 06:24.000]  big bank,
[06:24.000 --> 06:26.000]  technocracy,
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  the military is to be phased out.
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.000]  The human military is to be basically removed.
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.000]  We're to be ruled by combat robots
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  on land, sea, and air.
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  The post-human world
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  is beginning.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  It is a total dystopia
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  and it only gets worse from here on out
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  until you realize that
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.000]  and until we fully
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  set our entire lifestyles
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  and our entire purpose
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  against this system.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  The sooner you wake up to the system
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.000]  and the sooner you wake up to how much trouble
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  we're all in, the sooner we can turn this around.
[07:00.000 --> 07:02.000]  But great men
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  and great women that helped them
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  built the American system
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  that was the flower of the Renaissance
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  and had the greatest ideals
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  ever put forth in human time.
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  We were far from perfect
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  but we were building the greatest experiment
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  with the most human empowerment ever
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  but we became stupid, we became lazy,
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  we became decadent, we became forgetful.
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  We became forgetful
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  and we sold out our birthright
[07:26.000 --> 07:28.000]  and now we are in the jaws.
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  We are on the horns.
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  We are in the grip
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  of this system
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  and are being consolidated
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  and bankrupted
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  not just financially but most importantly
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  culturally and spiritually.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  Everything here
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  that I'm going to cover today
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  is part of that larger assault.
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  A cold blooded
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  worldwide scientific
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  corporate takeover
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  that does not wish you to join with it.
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  It wishes to suck you dry
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  and blow you into the atmosphere as ashes.
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  Now,
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.000]  bottom of the hour
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  I'm going to hit the biggest news
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  that you've basically
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  ever heard covered on this broadcast
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000]  and it's the old news you've already heard covered
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  but a lot of new breaking pieces
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  of the puzzle coming together
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  and it deals with these little headlines
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  right here but I'll tie it together
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  at the bottom of the hour
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.000]  in about 25 minutes.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  Obama administration placed
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  children with human traffickers
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  Senate report, that's the Washington Post.
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  Remember that?
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  Here's another one.
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  New York Magazine, Obama
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  administration handed
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  out migrants over to human traffickers
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  who are put them in snuff films.
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  I don't want to know that part.
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.000]  What happened to kids in cages
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  seeing them refers to immigrant detention center
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  as overflow facility?
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  Trump's one that took them out of the cages.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  German nuns rented orphaned boys
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  to businessmen
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  for gang bangs
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  and orgies suppressed
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  report seen by media.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  Many of them got HIV and hepatitis.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  D.W. dot com
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  biggest TV station in Germany
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  child sex abuse trial
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  the horrors of Germany's
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  operations tens of thousands of children
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.000]  by the state delivered
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  to live with rich pedophiles.
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  Now why is all this so important?
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  How's it all tied together?
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  I'll tell you at the bottom of the hour.
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  But when Nancy Pelosi comes out
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  and attacks the Republican
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  leader McCarthy and says,
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  aha, you're a Q idiot.
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  Aha.
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  None of the child sex stuff exists.
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  You're all crazy.
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  Q was designed to make it all fantastical
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  to divert from all the total admissions.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  You see.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  And then to make it fantastical and discredited
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  then the Q leader said it's all over.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  It's not true. Go back about your business.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  You got suckered. You got had.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  I tried to warn you.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  Most of you got it.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  Most of you didn't need me to tell you that.
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  But anybody telling you this is going to be
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  the worst thing that's handled is singing you
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  what they call a lullaby.
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  So anyone that actually studies
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  how governments and corrupt groups
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  and intelligence agencies operate
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  and the different types of them would know what this is.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  But see, you were involved with a secret
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  intelligence agency of good guys
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  that everything was handled and you believed
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  what H-Han told you when it was
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  the enemy.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  You didn't believe me.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  See, I'm not exoteric.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  I'm here.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  I'm in the fight. I am who I say I am.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  You can check my family.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  They go back to the start of the country.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  Oh, you don't want the real thing.
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  No, you want the lie.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  Because we wake up the mass public
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  and now they know about the New World Order
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  but they're still inculcated in the lie
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  so they're going to still believe
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  a version of the truth that is a fraud.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  I'm not lecturing our audience.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  I am simply trying to explain
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  to most of you that already
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  understood this why I'm still beating
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  the dead horse of Q.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  Most of my listeners knew this was a fraud,
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  90% of you, or more.
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  And you're like, stop talking about it, Jones.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  We already know that. Well, listen.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  Remember, this show is not for the people
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  that already know what's going on, OK?
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  I know a lot of you know more than I do.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  This is for new people.
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  That's how we're going to win this war.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  And so that's what I'm trying to do.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  One of the other news that ties into this.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  CIA counter-terror chief
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  suggests going to war
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  against domestic insurgents.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  He said it again. He didn't suggest that.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  He said they are.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  What did I say a week ago when he first said this?
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  Two weeks ago, I said they're modeling it
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  after Reconstruction.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  He just said they want to have Reconstruction
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  in the United States. Wait till I hit that.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  Ties into this. AOC claims
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  she thought she was going to die
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  during Capital Riot wasn't even in the building.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  It doesn't matter.
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  The new leader of the military
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  with a civilian head
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  who's not a civilian
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  says the main mission is rooting out
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  white supremacy. See, because America
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  is the enemy and they order
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  a military-wide
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  60-day stand-down.
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  So I guess
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  China that's declared war on us
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  told Biden
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  we want to see you've valid us
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  and he sure as hell did it.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  And now Defense Secretary
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  orders 60-day stand-down
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  to confront extremism
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  in the military. Have the military
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  eat itself
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  with a non-existent enemy, which this will only
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  create more division.
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  And what are they looking for as symbols of it?
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  San Francisco school teacher says
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  Bernie Sanders mittens are a symbol of white privilege
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  but you're like, well, that's just stupid. That's one teacher.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  No, whole college systems
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  are now saying acronyms are racist.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  But it gets better.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  In the UK
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  they have the National Day for Veterans
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  leftists are openly mocking
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  free speech as a right-wing fetish
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  reverence slam for declaring
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  clapping for dead veterans
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  as a cult of white British nationalism.
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  Yeah, you just live in the empire
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  they carved out. Damn them.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  Treating dogs
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  humanely is racist. Says
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  leftist professor, it's good that China eats them.
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  Don't criticize another culture
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  unless it's yours.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  That's
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  just some of what's coming up.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  And then we now have the videos
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  of the TSA that I always told you
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  was training to be on buses
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  and on trains
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  and just randomly on highways.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  Guess what?
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  The TSA is
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  here. The borders open.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  The borders open.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  People with TB and everything else come across.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  But you,
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  you, my pretty
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  ladies, you are under the mass police
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  and they're threatening felonies if you don't wear them.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  So you, do what they say
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  and then have your vaccine passport next
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  but oh, the teachers unions
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  will be exempt. Oh, the Democrats
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  don't have to take the shot.
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  I've got that article too for you.
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  You're like, none of this makes sense.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  It's all upside down. It's all super unpopular.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  Yeah, they stole the election
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  and they know it.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  And so they want to trigger a physical civil war
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  using gun confiscation
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  as the detonator
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  to legitimize the permanent
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  total takeover of the United States
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  and a new civil war and reconstruction.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  That's their plan. So when Biden says
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  I want to stop this uncivil civil war
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  in his inauguration, remember
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  everything he tells you it's the opposite.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  Except
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  the litmus test of promising to cut U.S.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  energy off. Oh, he's
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  doing that.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  So
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  it's all coming up today
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  and people are like, oh, well, look at these headlines.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  We are seeing coronavirus cases
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  fall so fast in the U.S.
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  New infections dropped 44% over the last
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  three weeks. But so they can just
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  tell the companies how to set the PCR test.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  So they turn them up
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  if they want more cases. They turn them down
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  if they're told these big health companies have less cases.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  But they're saying they'll just turn it up and down forever
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  internal documents and now public statements
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  by Obama.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  It's not a slip. Obama administration
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  2.0, the third administration
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  of Obama with the puppet Biden the
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  Obama administration
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  2021 has had their spokesperson
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  out on
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  meet the pressure name and I covered it Monday
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  and they say, oh, it's five years
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  at least. I mean,
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  which is into the next election.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  Got to have balance in four years.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Whoo.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  So that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  Oh, and the ATF said, we don't need legislation
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  to ban your guns. They've had an announcement
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  that they're going to ban most of your guns.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  I've got that new rule change right here for you.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  So we'll tell you all
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  about it today. I mean, it's
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  it's on folks. And the left
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  loves it. They're going to lose everything they got, but they don't care
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  because it's spiritual. They hate America.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  You were founded as a Christian nation.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  They want to destroy that.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  I've got some bad news.
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  Our best selling vitamin mineral fusion
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  has sold out because people understand
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  in these stressful times, it's now more important
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  But here's the good news.
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  Tumoric acts in very similar
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  ways and is so good
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  for inflammation, so good for your immune system.
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  And we've got two great tumeric formulas.
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  One is body's ultimate tumeric
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  formula that is a dried tumeric
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  extract, 95%
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  humanoid. People love it. That's selling
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  out. Despite that, it's still discounted
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  and then for our store.com.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  And then also selling out this week
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  is our liquid tumeric extract.
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  It's called liquid tumeric extract.
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  People really love it. It's extremely strong
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  as well. It's selling out.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  And your purchase doesn't just help
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  yourself and your body. It also
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  funds the Info War and keeps us on air
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  So thank you all for your support.

[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  Hey Alex, how you doing, man?
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  Is this the guy that called in
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  about living defense?
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've been trying
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  to tell you since Monday
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  when I heard you got that fresh shipment
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  of living defense in from Utah.
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  I said, man, I got to get on
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  that show and give him an update.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  I said, if I ever get a chance
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  to be on an Alex Jones show, I'm
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  going to tell the world about
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  living defense and what it did for me personally.
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  Now look, I'm 64
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  years old going on 20
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  thanks to the Info War Store
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  products. And by the way, I bought
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  $800 worth the other night.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  I'm doing what I can, brother.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  So what my convention is
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  why don't we start this new year off
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  right with everybody getting
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  couple bottles of living defense.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  Now you got to follow that up with the
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  Microsoft Act. I learned that.
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  We didn't know, we didn't screen
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  your call, we had no idea, and I go
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  to you a year later and you're here
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  telling people about living defense.
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  Living defense. Living defense.
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  Wrapping up the way things ought
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  to be.
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  And I don't mind
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  them switching sides and standing
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  up for things they believe
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  in.
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  But when they're running down our country
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  they're walking on
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  the fighting side of me.
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  Walking on the fighting side of me.
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  Walking on the fighting side of me.
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  you have every right as an American,
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  you're free speech.
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  But when you say you want the country
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  to not exist anymore.
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  And when you say you want to lock people
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  up in their houses, when you say they're
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  non-essential, when you say you love
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  world government, well you're an enemy
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  of that republic.
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  And you need to get the hell out of it.
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  But instead the globalists are telling
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  us we only need to be reeducated.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  We need to be arrested. They have the
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  former head of CIA counter-terrorism
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  that's now being rehired by Obama
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  in another news article saying we want
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  a new country. We want a new reconstruction.
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  We want to go after our fellow
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  countrymen. These are quotes.
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  The enemy is now our fellow citizens
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  because a couple hundred people out of
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  a couple hundred thousand went in the capital
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  and beat up a couple cops and one had a heart
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  attack a few days later and died.
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  That's one one thousandth
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  conservatively of what Antifa
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  and BLM have done. Hell, they've probably done
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  ten thousand times more.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  Oh, but AOC said
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  that's a good, Antifa's good. CNN
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  said Antifa's good in the last four years.
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  MSNBC, Black Lives Matter's good.
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  They can't get their propaganda
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  straight. Remember, Nadler
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  said it doesn't exist. It's a myth.
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  Let's see, these are liars.
[20:04.000 --> 20:06.000]  In a moment, I'm going to show you AOC
[20:06.000 --> 20:08.000]  caught in the line we talked about
[20:08.000 --> 20:10.000]  a few days ago. I said, wait a minute.
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.000]  Look up where her office is.
[20:12.000 --> 20:14.000]  She's a junior member of the house
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  and I've actually been there while she was
[20:16.000 --> 20:18.000]  a congresswoman and saw her scurrying around
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.000]  in the halls about a year and a half ago.
[20:20.000 --> 20:22.000]  She wasn't even in the
[20:22.000 --> 20:24.000]  damn capital.
[20:24.000 --> 20:26.000]  I mean, I mean, I know
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  we talked about a few days ago, but now it's even on
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  Fox News. This woman is
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  a congenital liar.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  We're going to get to that here in a moment.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  But first,
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  my dad launched a new company
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  about a year and a half ago and developed
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  his own amazing toothpaste and other big line
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  of products. He's a retired dentist, oral
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  surgeon, DR Jones
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  Naturals, DrJonesNaturals.com
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  can find all the products there on his amazing
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  shopping cart and, of course, he's a sponsor
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  of ours and a lot of that goes to support
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  what we're doing so you can get the right products, the entire
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  line of them, at drjonesnaturals.com
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  or simply by going
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  to infowars
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  store.com and all the
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  products are there as well. Like
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  activated charcoal, concentrated
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  toothpaste, it doesn't have the additives or
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  crap, it doesn't have the fluoride, it doesn't have
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  the aspartame. This is the high
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  end. Again, it's very, very strong.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  Works incredibly well on your teeth
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  but doesn't abrade off the enamel like
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  some of the other ones do. It's available
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  at infowarsstore.com
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  and at drjonesnaturals.com
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  and what else is available
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  there?
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  Rocket rest. Now, I
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  love knockout. It's something I had an idea
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  for
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  seven years ago. I said, you know
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  how much does a bottle
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  of melatonin
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  with a standard milligram
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  dosage of it that they recommend cost?
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  They said about 20 bucks
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  and I said, well, how much does it cost to put
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  a good melatonin in a bottle? They said about $2
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  and the cost of bottles like 50 cents
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  and I said, well, I'm not going to sell that
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  for $5. I mean
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  that won't fund our operation. But I said, how about if we put
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  eltryptophan
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  valerian root, chamomile
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  and a bunch of other natural stuff
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  that all works together to make you sleep
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  better and that hits people at a whole bunch of their
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  receptors, not just one receptor. I talked
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  to some top developers. They said, that's a great idea.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  We made knockout.
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  The thing about it is, when you take a
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  formula a long time, for a lot of people, it doesn't work
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  as well. So I'll go on knockoff
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  a knockout for six months,
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  stops working as good, go off of it, take
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  something else. Sometimes I get jazzed up, have trouble
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  sleeping.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  Well, my dad came up with a top
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  developer. It just so happens to be my
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  brother-in-law who's actually in his own right
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  has some big supplement companies. He's very successful
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  in organic lines and has
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  multiple degrees in chemistry
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  and the rest of it. He came up
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  with rocket rest, deep sleep support
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  and this will knock you
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  in the dirt in a good way.
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  And then you feel super refreshed when you wake up
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  and you blast off. Rocket rest is available
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  at infowarstore.com
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  but also at drjonesnaturals.com
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  and I'm not going to go over
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  all the ingredients in it because it would take
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  a while.
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  But this has got
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  basically a different combination, different
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  ingredients and is super strong.
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  And so we're talking about 200 milligrams
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  of this, 100 milligrams of that, 50 of this
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  5
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  of melatonin. So this is a lot stronger
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  than
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  the other product, but different
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  strokes for different folks. Again, the first
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  few years I was taking
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  knockout, one of
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  them would knock me out for 10 hours. Now it would take
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  2 to knock me out for 6 or 7
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  and I still take it sometimes and both are
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  apples and oranges folks. It's just this is
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  like
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  this is like Mike Tyson
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  versus
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  who's that top lightweight
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  I know his name, I watched the matches
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  and he's a black guy, he's awesome. He just
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  beat the hell out of McGregor a few years
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  ago.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  Mayweather, yeah, so one of them
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  exactly. So
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  knockouts like Mayweather
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  and Rocket rest is like
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  Mike Tyson and his prime.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  So they're all available
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  at infowarstore.com
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  and it funds their operation
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  and also we got
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  DNA Force Plus about to sell out, it's still discounted
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  it's amazing for your body and we have Ultra 12
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  the highest quality B12, take it under the tongue, a lot of people
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  can't absorb it in the gut, especially older folks
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  you take it under the tongue, sit about a minute, it tastes
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  sweet. People say why does it taste sweet? B12
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  when it's natural and organic tastes sweet
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  and it's a red purple color and like any color
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  it's beautiful. So check it out at infowarstore.com
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  Okay, I'm going to give you the really big news
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  on the globalist pedophile rings, the latest
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  developments there in a moment, but let's go out to break
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  with Fox News on the
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  lying sack of communist
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  garbage that works $3,000
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  outfits. She's all for communism, but she works
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  $3,000 outfits and $1,000 shoes and
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  $20,000 watches, but capitalism is bad
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  and she applies on private jets, but you should be able
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  to fly commercial. Here she is.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  I jump into my
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  bathroom
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  and I close the door and I just keep
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  hearing these bang, bang, bang
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  I open the door
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  when all of a sudden I hear
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  that whoever was trying
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  to get inside got into my office
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  and I just hear
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  where is she?
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  Where is she?
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  And this was the moment
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  where
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  I thought
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  everything
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  was over.
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  I mean, I thought I was going to die.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  That was
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  the moment that
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  it all began to become
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  more common in the United States.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  On the other hand, his
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  Democratic Congresswoman
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, her
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  dramatic recounting of her
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  experience in her office during the US Capitol
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  riots last month, but critics and lawmakers
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  are accusing her now of exaggerating
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  that story, pointing out that she wasn't
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  in the Capitol building at the time, but in the
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  Cannon office building across from
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.880]  this is a deeply cynical and disgusting attack as the capital complex was
[26:00.880 --> 26:04.560]  stormed and people were being killed none of us knew in the moment what areas
[26:04.560 --> 26:08.720]  were compromised you previously told reporters yourself that you barricaded
[26:08.720 --> 26:12.760]  in your office afraid you'd be hurt
[26:13.640 --> 26:17.760]  congressman I'd like to start with you you you're we have to revisit this later
[26:17.760 --> 26:21.200]  because they get into the evidence that she wasn't even in the capital but what
[26:21.200 --> 26:24.080]  about when she went to that border facility a few years ago remember that
[26:24.080 --> 26:28.080]  and she said they saw kids drinking out of toilets when there's built-in
[26:28.080 --> 26:34.840]  stainless steel systems and kids weren't even in there liar liar liar but she
[26:34.840 --> 26:37.080]  never gets in trouble help Ryan Williams said he got shot down in a
[26:37.080 --> 26:44.960]  helicopter he's he hosts a show again and does fact-checking for NBC let's have
[26:44.960 --> 26:49.080]  Pinocchio do it next all right folks I'm gonna hit the big news dr. Steve
[26:49.080 --> 26:54.720]  machanics coming up as well oh yeah stay with us
[27:19.080 --> 27:24.880]  they ever thought COVID more devastating than ever imagine they told us that two
[27:24.880 --> 27:28.400]  and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three
[27:28.400 --> 27:33.800]  months okay it's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of
[27:33.800 --> 27:37.920]  other things we're talking 96% had co-morbidity these are real numbers
[27:37.920 --> 27:41.760]  these are real facts this is the chicken little event we'll run our houses
[27:41.760 --> 27:45.480]  never come out and are taught we're not essential all the big box tours in
[27:45.480 --> 27:50.880]  Amazon take over the planet review could stand up against it this is slavery it
[27:50.880 --> 27:55.560]  is not something you can put up with and survive there are thousands of
[27:55.560 --> 27:59.840]  ideologies out there hundreds of different political systems and most of
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.520]  them are funded by the globalist info wars is truly the tip of the spear of
[28:04.520 --> 28:07.960]  the zeitgeist that's what a globalist are obsessed with it trying to shut it
[28:07.960 --> 28:12.840]  down I didn't invent all this I went and researched the Renaissance Americana and
[28:12.840 --> 28:16.920]  what really works for humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back and
[28:16.920 --> 28:21.080]  lo and behold it's super popular like it's always been that's why the
[28:21.080 --> 28:25.120]  globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the light
[28:25.120 --> 28:29.400]  in the dark of the night that's since chills up my spine so whatever you do
[28:29.400 --> 28:33.360]  continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the great products and
[28:33.360 --> 28:37.120]  info or store.com by spreading the articles by spreading the videos and by
[28:37.120 --> 28:40.800]  praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for

[30:50.360 --> 30:57.600]  gentlemen welcome to this worldwide broadcast February 4 2021 and dr. Steve
[30:57.600 --> 31:01.520]  Pachennick we have the clip will play it here in a few minutes has the courage to
[31:01.520 --> 31:06.560]  come back on the show after coming on for 19 years and saying about 95% of what
[31:06.560 --> 31:10.720]  he's predicted come true what he predicted here a month ago before
[31:10.720 --> 31:17.200]  January 20th did not come true and he's gonna give us his take on it I can't
[31:17.200 --> 31:23.080]  wait to talk to him I'm not here to count coup or count points I'm actually
[31:23.080 --> 31:26.680]  really upset about all the things that have been unfolding and really hoped
[31:26.680 --> 31:31.680]  that he would be right so I am certainly not triumphant and the fact that my
[31:31.680 --> 31:36.800]  prediction is correct it is very painful but I didn't like the predictions
[31:36.800 --> 31:39.120]  they were making either I didn't like that road we were going down but now
[31:39.120 --> 31:45.400]  we're going down that road via Biden and the corrupt globalist CIA and I
[31:45.400 --> 31:51.120]  actually have talked to you know a lot of people that are at the Pentagon and
[31:51.120 --> 31:55.040]  based out of Florida at the Special Operations Command and other people and
[31:55.040 --> 31:58.360]  they're really concerned about Biden and trying to trigger a civil war and
[31:58.360 --> 32:03.000]  martial law and that's what they tried to do that's the second part of the
[32:03.000 --> 32:07.440]  Psyop that failed on the 20th and so we should be thinking our lucky stars that
[32:07.440 --> 32:12.040]  it was not a lot worse than what some of the bad actors were planning so I'm
[32:12.040 --> 32:15.280]  going to go ahead and just not in a mean way but take the gloves off of the chair
[32:15.280 --> 32:19.880]  and I can tell him what I really know so we'll be talking coming up coming up
[32:19.880 --> 32:30.280]  in the second hour now I rattle on so much and I cover incredibly important
[32:30.280 --> 32:35.280]  stuff and it's almost a function of how much news there is that you got to go
[32:35.280 --> 32:43.120]  through it like you're a person in a state sale as a individual rattling off
[32:43.120 --> 32:52.320]  what the latest bids are but this is a huge issue and and there are a lot of
[32:52.320 --> 32:57.280]  currencies on the planet that the establishment operates under there's
[32:57.280 --> 33:02.640]  cash there's digital money there's the derivatives there's art there's drugs
[33:02.640 --> 33:11.080]  there's sex there's information and there is all sorts of weird decadent
[33:11.080 --> 33:17.040]  pleasures I mean a big one is eating dead bodies a lot of established with
[33:17.040 --> 33:22.320]  people really like to eat human flesh and they get them from morgues and stuff
[33:22.320 --> 33:27.400]  with dead kids and people and that's something that's well known and then my
[33:27.400 --> 33:29.840]  dad told me all about this when I was a kid and later I saw it come out in the
[33:29.840 --> 33:34.320]  news he told me about how in Italy they go into the catacombs and they like to
[33:34.320 --> 33:42.560]  eat a thousand year old 500 year old bones and then they boil them in the in
[33:42.560 --> 33:48.320]  the soups and they even have a name for it and I thought he was crazy when I was
[33:48.320 --> 33:52.480]  a kid tell me that later I saw it in literature and it was actually a fact so
[33:52.480 --> 33:58.840]  that's the type of stuff that goes on that's the type of stuff going on where
[33:58.840 --> 34:01.760]  these people have all the money all the power and so they just do more and more
[34:01.760 --> 34:04.960]  degenerate stuff I mean it's very popular for establishment folks to
[34:04.960 --> 34:09.760]  just eat big bowls of fresh feces right out of a woman's rear end and you know
[34:09.760 --> 34:14.480]  I'm not trying to be gross here folks I just want you to know what we're up
[34:14.480 --> 34:24.720]  against and what we're dealing with okay and so there is industrial level
[34:24.720 --> 34:31.080]  evil going on and you can psychically feel it you can see it in the culture
[34:31.080 --> 34:37.640]  it's everywhere and so let's let's lay it out it's spiritual there are millions
[34:37.640 --> 34:41.600]  of people coming across the US border and other borders tens of thousands end
[34:41.600 --> 34:45.920]  up conservatively per country and sex slavery every year and many of them end
[34:45.920 --> 34:52.320]  up missing they end up killed and I'm gonna show you evidence of that and so
[34:52.320 --> 34:57.480]  that's why for me it cheapened it that when Trump really did tenfold plus
[34:57.480 --> 35:01.680]  increase the arrest of pedophiles pedophile rings sign executive orders
[35:01.680 --> 35:05.920]  the banks the groups doing it going after Epstein going after all these
[35:05.920 --> 35:11.400]  sources it was really having a big effect and then to watch all that stolen
[35:11.400 --> 35:15.920]  into a black hole of an eight-chan board with some goblin-like creatures at the
[35:15.920 --> 35:19.560]  command of it obviously being told what to do to make everybody think that it
[35:19.560 --> 35:27.480]  was all cartoonized underground millions of children you know just all like
[35:27.480 --> 35:31.960]  Marvel comics on steroids so that when the dates always were wrong Hillary
[35:31.960 --> 35:36.480]  wasn't in Gitmo Trump didn't win Trump had it stolen you know the 20th there
[35:36.480 --> 35:43.440]  wasn't executions up on the up on the platform but it said it put us into the
[35:43.440 --> 35:46.240]  martial law it put us into the troops it put us into the purge of
[35:46.240 --> 35:51.640]  conservatives it put us into the global of storm coming after everybody and so
[35:51.640 --> 35:55.520]  this was a way to set up the legitimate movement against pedophilia against
[35:55.520 --> 35:59.320]  Satanism against world government against genetic engineering with human
[35:59.320 --> 36:02.960]  animal hybrids all the real things that were coming out it just became like a
[36:02.960 --> 36:08.000]  cartoon like a comic book and I'd go to gun rallies or and you know but Trump
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.160]  rallies and I'd see maybe 10% in the queue thing and they all had this weird
[36:12.160 --> 36:15.440]  crazy look in their eye like they were part of an invincible group and they
[36:15.440 --> 36:18.080]  were part of a secret army and they always have this satisfied look and go
[36:18.080 --> 36:24.120]  Jones you're not Q level we know you're the bad guy and I'm just like oh my god
[36:24.120 --> 36:27.600]  these people are under mind control and they're gonna set us up and none of this
[36:27.600 --> 36:30.120]  is gonna happen like they said and they're gonna beat us up with a head
[36:30.120 --> 36:35.320]  with it and use that to discredit all the serious gains we've made now the truth
[36:35.320 --> 36:38.320]  is it's still backfiring on them and it didn't go off the way they wanted they
[36:38.320 --> 36:42.080]  wanted to have insurrection and uprisings and through these groups they
[36:42.080 --> 36:46.120]  commanded people to be violent but it didn't work when Antifa helped break
[36:46.120 --> 36:50.560]  through with a few groups the capital a few hundred Q fools wearing Q garb went
[36:50.560 --> 36:53.720]  in and stayed in the velvet ropes and did it all and got suckered and they've
[36:53.720 --> 36:58.240]  all been indicted out the real operatives and I pointed that out and I did
[36:58.240 --> 37:00.880]  that so the federal southern property law center groups running this had
[37:00.880 --> 37:07.360]  pressured on them to actually bust their own operatives who are now in hiding so
[37:07.360 --> 37:15.640]  that's where we are here and that's why I'm so upset is because when we come back
[37:15.640 --> 37:20.360]  of the next segment I'm gonna go over the latest development of hundreds of
[37:20.360 --> 37:31.400]  thousands of children in industrial level raping industrial level raping by
[37:31.400 --> 37:35.000]  what you call the Catholic Church but really satanic cobbins within it where
[37:35.000 --> 37:42.400]  the nuns deliver the five and ten year old boys between ages five and ten some
[37:42.400 --> 37:51.840]  even younger to giant rape events were up to 30 men rape and also inject blood
[37:51.840 --> 37:56.880]  product semen into children giving them HIV and hepatitis that's the real
[37:56.880 --> 38:00.640]  satanic event is is hurting the child that's why California passed a law that
[38:00.640 --> 38:04.840]  you can give children HIV it's not a crime oh but COVID such a big
[38:04.840 --> 38:09.520]  problem then this is a cult of psychotic control freaks and they love you
[38:09.520 --> 38:13.120]  wearing the mask they that's the cup that's a simple the child gagged you're
[38:13.120 --> 38:17.160]  covered up the woman gagged they've got control over you you shut your mouth to
[38:17.160 --> 38:20.840]  them this is all spiritual and it makes these demons that run these people so
[38:20.840 --> 38:29.000]  incredibly happy and so that's where we are when we come back I'm gonna show you
[38:29.000 --> 38:33.200]  the latest with the German government now having to admit it's all true but not
[38:33.200 --> 38:37.760]  as the Catholic Church the German government in every state placing as
[38:37.760 --> 38:42.480]  young as three-year-old boys it's always boys because you got to destroy the

[40:46.240 --> 40:49.840]  horrible food it starts with digging in with a long globalist fight you'll win
[40:49.840 --> 40:52.080]  in the end
[40:52.320 --> 40:56.680]  the Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate
[40:56.680 --> 41:01.040]  alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income
[41:01.040 --> 41:04.600]  which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through
[41:04.600 --> 41:08.080]  the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin it's all now
[41:08.080 --> 41:13.160]  completely official part of the UN great reset of the Davos group and
[41:13.160 --> 41:17.600]  Klaus Schwab all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and
[41:17.600 --> 41:21.640]  Rockefeller Foundation all the rest of them at 10 to 21, 10 to 20 30 it's here
[41:21.640 --> 41:26.360]  and only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until
[41:26.360 --> 41:32.000]  you reject it all and the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.800]  battle the first evil and stopping abortion we must start valuing human
[41:36.800 --> 41:41.600]  life again we must start saying that we are not expendable that we are not
[41:41.600 --> 41:47.960]  disposable that we are essential until we do that we are all slaves we must stand
[41:47.960 --> 41:52.800]  up and declare our basic God-given human rights now
[41:52.800 --> 41:59.280]  there are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United
[41:59.280 --> 42:03.240]  States much less in the entire world info wars and stand alone with our own
[42:03.240 --> 42:07.320]  radio and TV satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations picking us up
[42:07.320 --> 42:12.800]  almost no one else has that especially anybody covering real issues of global
[42:12.800 --> 42:17.480]  populism the right to self-defense and exposing the anti-human globalist death
[42:17.480 --> 42:22.480]  agenda that's why when we go out and shoot videos they're at banned on video
[42:22.480 --> 42:28.120]  they're not allowed to be on Twitter on YouTube on Facebook that's why it's so
[42:28.120 --> 42:33.040]  precious because the censorship expands to everyone which it is now with AI
[42:33.040 --> 42:37.520]  monitoring controlling what you can say and do it's going to be the OACs black
[42:37.520 --> 42:41.560]  band on video and the now redesigned info wars calm become more and more
[42:41.560 --> 42:46.800]  important which they are and the enemy is suing us attacking us hacking us lying
[42:46.800 --> 42:51.400]  about us sabotaging us infiltrating us trying to shut us down right now they're
[42:51.400 --> 42:57.320]  coming after everyone so spread the word now the post-industrial world that's
[42:57.320 --> 43:03.320]  what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21
[43:03.320 --> 43:09.640]  conference back in 1992 now they've launched agenda 2030 which is a post

[43:20.160 --> 43:25.600]  want to find out what agenda 2030 is it is the destruction of society as we know
[43:25.600 --> 43:29.840]  it is making the population poor by designs we can be controlled with a
[43:29.840 --> 43:35.680]  medical technocracy over you and your family they're destroying civilization

[43:56.840 --> 44:02.280]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:07.200 --> 44:15.800]  there's a man coming round taking names going round taking names and he decides
[44:15.800 --> 44:25.640]  who to free and who to blame everybody won't be treated all the same there'll
[44:25.640 --> 44:30.160]  be a golden letter reaching down
[44:31.120 --> 44:42.240]  when the man comes around. Okay let me lay it out I have dug around over the
[44:42.240 --> 44:47.320]  years and run into in the last 27 years on air the actual court filings that
[44:47.320 --> 44:52.600]  usually get sealed later in Europe in Russia in the United States in Canada
[44:52.600 --> 44:56.960]  and Australia it's always the same I mean little kids in cages people eating
[44:56.960 --> 45:02.120]  them lines of men raping these children also some women but it's maybe one out
[45:02.120 --> 45:07.880]  of 50s a woman and it's just the most horrific stuff you've ever imagined so
[45:07.880 --> 45:11.640]  the things I was telling you earlier that's all real I mean the descriptions
[45:11.640 --> 45:17.400]  of the snuff films in FBI reports this is confirmed stuff and also the finders
[45:17.400 --> 45:22.560]  the CIA in the DC back in the 80s and this all came out I mean the FBI agents
[45:22.560 --> 45:25.880]  couldn't even deal with it when they got in there it was like hundreds of

[51:44.560 --> 51:47.960]  who they are so let's just get this straight
[51:47.960 --> 51:52.960]  Sandusky pull up that demons face and then compare him to compare him to
[51:52.960 --> 51:57.960]  Epstein the same demon face that same satisfied greedy selfish thing that
[51:57.960 --> 52:02.440]  wants to ruin a child's life humans aren't sexually attracted to children
[52:02.440 --> 52:09.640]  demons are I'm attracted to killing people that hurt children I'm attracted
[52:09.640 --> 52:15.640]  to cutting their throats that's what I'm attracted to I'm attracted to jamming
[52:15.640 --> 52:21.840]  ice picks and pedophiles eyeballs and pulling their teeth out with pliers but
[52:21.840 --> 52:27.000]  don't worry I'm not gonna do any of that because God will have vengeance on all
[52:27.000 --> 52:34.080]  of you and you will burn in hell with your God Lucifer forever you will be
[52:34.080 --> 52:39.000]  bound in your so-called chaos and you're reveling against God and you will be
[52:39.000 --> 52:47.360]  destroyed so we let these maggots take over and now we're gonna be judged but
[52:47.360 --> 52:51.600]  they're not the ones in control God is the one in control so there you go
[52:51.600 --> 52:57.200]  there's the rest of the story and you're lucky and I'm lucky that I didn't
[52:57.200 --> 53:03.240]  read you the descriptions of what is in the confirmed police reports but if you
[53:03.240 --> 53:05.600]  want to know why they've got the government doing all this bad stuff and
[53:05.600 --> 53:08.040]  government shutting off the economy when everybody hates it and why they don't
[53:08.040 --> 53:14.880]  because they're controlled because they turn to blind eye first you go to a
[53:14.880 --> 53:18.920]  party and you have sex with prostitutes then you have sex with 16 year old
[53:18.920 --> 53:22.240]  girls then you have sex with ten year old girls then you have sex with ten
[53:22.240 --> 53:26.640]  year old boys even if you don't want to then you kill a kid that girl that kid
[53:26.640 --> 53:32.160]  causing problems get there and kill that go strangle that seven-year-old and they

[53:43.120 --> 53:46.880]  rituals where they get beat up by those above them all a hierarchical
[53:46.880 --> 53:53.360]  trampling and being trampled on just like O'Brien tells Winston in 1984 Hillary
[53:53.360 --> 54:00.560]  Clinton's handbook for dystopia but vengeance is God's sayeth the Lord is

[54:56.120 --> 55:00.400]  vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different
[55:00.400 --> 55:04.240]  natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average
[55:04.240 --> 55:07.840]  metabolic system metabolism of a human some people get 15 hours out of some
[55:07.840 --> 55:10.960]  people get about eight hours but people take this people taking sports people
[55:10.960 --> 55:14.760]  cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not hype nobody

[55:53.320 --> 55:57.040]  social distance and report them back to cell towers to track for every movement
[55:57.040 --> 56:01.920]  this is for everybody the way it's better now France has programs in their
[56:01.920 --> 56:06.360]  factories government push and sponsor to make everyone wear actual dog callers
[56:06.360 --> 56:10.360]  you can make your social distance and report back to civil computers they're
[56:10.360 --> 56:15.280]  turning us into a commodity human animal clones been around for 50 years it's all
[56:15.280 --> 56:18.600]  being announced they are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and
[56:18.600 --> 56:23.680]  making us obsolete and big corporations now they own us with these gene therapy
[56:23.680 --> 56:28.480]  systems and patents that they produced do you understand it is a takeover of the
[56:28.480 --> 56:32.560]  entire species of the genetic level and now they're coming with dog ballers and
[56:32.560 --> 56:36.360]  they're announcing in public schools in the u.s. starting next year it will begin
[56:36.360 --> 56:40.920]  did you hear me dog collars for your children all based on a hoax all based
[56:40.920 --> 56:45.680]  on a lot implore wars continue to spread the word to fight back
[56:45.680 --> 57:04.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[57:15.680 --> 57:23.320]  if you are receiving this transmission
[57:23.320 --> 57:29.560]  the resistance live from Austin Texas broadcasting
[57:29.560 --> 57:39.240]  it's Alex John he's never been in a military to you do not understand what
[57:39.240 --> 57:43.680]  that means you do not understand how quickly we work and how long we've been
[57:43.680 --> 57:48.840]  preparing for this if I'm wrong I will never appear on your show again but if
[57:48.840 --> 57:55.720]  I'm right I become one of your official paid commentator you want that right
[57:55.720 --> 57:59.960]  I'll hurry and pay you can be on show over there we are now officially in a
[57:59.960 --> 58:06.240]  military coup what has happened and why I was part of it is because I've had a
[58:06.240 --> 58:10.800]  history of doing soft coups in the United States and what we call hard coups
[58:10.800 --> 58:16.240]  overseas overthrowing regimes using the military in this case we have what we
[58:16.240 --> 58:21.160]  call a hard coup it was initiated as I said a month and a half ago two months
[58:21.160 --> 58:26.840]  ago by our cyber command using special forces they were over 400 people from
[58:26.840 --> 58:32.040]  all parts of the intelligence community I won't go into the names but in effect
[58:32.040 --> 58:39.080]  now we are about to arrest Pelosi we're gonna arrest Biden Hunter Biden Mitt
[58:39.080 --> 58:44.600]  Romney you're talking about a whole list of individuals whom I identified on this
[58:44.600 --> 58:50.420]  show for years when I said Gina Haspel has to go she went when I said Barr was a
[58:50.420 --> 58:55.680]  CIA operative he went when I told you Pence was not to be believed because he
[58:55.680 --> 59:00.320]  came out of a democratic Catholic background became an evangelical
[59:00.320 --> 59:05.720]  Christian he led so what's happening now is that we are literally in a military
[59:05.720 --> 59:11.920]  coup that means in effect this country will watch the arrest that will come out
[59:11.920 --> 59:17.120]  of this we have already arrested and basically overseas we have taken out the
[59:17.120 --> 59:22.160]  Pope whom I've identified for over 30 years as a terrorist when he was
[59:22.160 --> 59:26.640]  director of the Jesuits that killed three of our American nuns two of our
[59:26.640 --> 59:31.440]  Jesuits we arrested a young man from the an older man from the State
[59:31.440 --> 59:36.960]  Department Stefanin Serini who basically leaked all the information used
[59:36.960 --> 59:42.840]  Leonardo the sites going up to the satellites which were controlled by the
[59:42.840 --> 59:48.960]  Vatican we in turn intercepted all that information and were able to get along
[59:48.960 --> 59:55.960]  with Nancy Pelosi's a computer by the way there was no rioting in the Capitol I
[59:55.960 --> 1:00:00.080]  happened to know three to four people here from my town who said it was very
[1:00:00.080 --> 1:00:04.960]  peaceful the police took down the barriers and in effect what people don't
[1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:11.960]  know is we sent special forces operators in there to take Pelosi's computer I'm
[1:00:11.960 --> 1:00:21.160]  about there it is the new Pearl Harbor the ultimate attack of history the
[1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:26.280]  devastating special ops takeover in the takedown of the globalist unbelievable
[1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:29.120]  all right we're gonna go to break some stations aren't carrying this segment

[1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:37.160]  highly anticipated interview I his interview with Owen shroyer got about
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:41.320]  five and a half million views on band-op video back a few months ago when he
[1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:44.480]  said that you know Trump was invincible and all this was gonna happen and a lot
[1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:48.320]  of people thought that too a lot of televangelist the general public a lot
[1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:51.320]  of people I know behind the scenes a lot of people even in government thought
[1:00:51.320 --> 1:00:54.800]  this was happening but really it was used to then bring in the real martial law and
[1:00:54.800 --> 1:00:58.520]  the troops and everything that's for us and the former head of counterterrorism
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:03.520]  saying they're gonna come after the American people I've got all of that

[1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:02.360]  gonna let that happen they had to have some way to repudiate the populist
[1:02:02.360 --> 1:02:07.240]  movement emanating from the United States that spread across the world from
[1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:11.920]  the UK to Brazil they were desperate they admitted their own publications they
[1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:16.520]  didn't know what to do and so they put out 80 million fake ballots violated
[1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:21.680]  state law and stole it better than death and now they're coming after the
[1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:24.920]  president they're coming after you they're coming after me they're shutting

[1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:10.200]  live raw and unfiltered by globalist propaganda it's the Alex Jones show
[1:03:10.200 --> 1:03:14.440]  tomorrow's news today
[1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:30.120]  coming to you live from the ATX broadcasting worldwide I'm not gonna
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:33.880]  try to rehabilitate dr. Steve Chinnick here on air and some people's eyes but
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:37.680]  he did leave the CFR and say 9-11 was an inside job and called the real
[1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:41.360]  perpetrators out that were actually involved orchestrating it I'm not
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:44.520]  saying radical Islam doesn't exist and he's done a lot of other good things
[1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:48.520]  wasn't for the Syrian war it supported Trump trying to get troops out but I
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:53.320]  thought he was buying into the whole Q8 Chan deal that Trump's invincible
[1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:57.560]  military coup I didn't even want a military coup and I saw this as a big
[1:03:57.560 --> 1:04:01.680]  setup and then I thought the Secret Service would be at the Capitol if they
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:04.680]  knew Trump was planning to speak there then sure as hell Trump says I'm going
[1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:07.800]  to the Capitol and the Secret Service opens up the gates and leads me over to
[1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:11.080]  lead it but already a hundred plus thousand already marched in a few
[1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:15.160]  hundred we're already attacking a tiny force of like 30 police that then got
[1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:19.560]  pushed out of the way by we know operatives that had embedded themselves
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:26.040]  in every major Patriot group and in Antifa so I was there witnessing that
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:30.440]  historical false flag it was kind of a consolation like a memento to even be
[1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:33.200]  hitting the face with some tear gas I'm not a victim was actually kind of
[1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:39.320]  enjoyable but I mean this actually was going on and so I got a hand at the
[1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:42.880]  folks that hijacked this you know they really won this round you really screwed
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:47.320]  me over felt like I was Jeff Bridges in Arlington Road but luckily we were able
[1:04:47.320 --> 1:04:51.360]  to de-escalate it so it didn't go to the pipe bombs and the killing that some of
[1:04:51.360 --> 1:04:54.760]  the Q-tards thought they were supposed to go in and actually zip tie people and
[1:04:54.760 --> 1:04:58.520]  get them out the reason they moved from saying oh Trump sent people there is they
[1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:01.560]  wanted to move to a planned operation but now they know that the FBI is
[1:05:01.560 --> 1:05:04.680]  controlling those groups now they want to back off that as well they've been
[1:05:04.680 --> 1:05:10.600]  trying to back off the impeachment now Senator Kane wants censure instead and
[1:05:10.600 --> 1:05:17.200]  so I appreciate Steve Pachinic coming on and having the courage after he was on
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:21.040]  well let's punch that up is this Steve Pachinic's last interview because I can
[1:05:21.040 --> 1:05:25.320]  give you the date I forget the date there it is is this Dr. Steve Pachinic's
[1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:31.800]  last Grand Central Wars and that was January 13th seven days before we were
[1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:36.880]  supposedly gonna see Joe Biden's head cut off like a chicken up there on the
[1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:41.280]  the dais in front of the Capitol running around like a chicken but it didn't
[1:05:41.280 --> 1:05:46.400]  happen so Steve Pachinic tell us was it all a big joke are you in with the Q
[1:05:46.400 --> 1:05:49.640]  guys were you part of the setup or were you really believing this was gonna
[1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:54.720]  happen we really appreciate you coming on number one I enjoy coming on the show
[1:05:54.720 --> 1:06:00.520]  number two what I do resent is the ad hominem comments coming from your
[1:06:00.520 --> 1:06:07.720]  disgusting viewers who think that I lie or in some way gave them false promise
[1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:12.640]  if they want to know who I am what I am let them read my book American Warrior
[1:06:12.640 --> 1:06:18.640]  in Crisis I came on the show again to basically say to you I will double down
[1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:24.680]  on the military coup and the reason I'm doubling down is that right now it's
[1:06:24.680 --> 1:06:31.680]  taking more time and I don't directly deal with military operatives as I had in
[1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:37.360]  the past when I went over seas so I still have faith in my cyber command I
[1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:44.440]  have faith in my special forces I have faith in the generals that my friend's
[1:06:44.440 --> 1:06:49.080]  brother was appointed sync pack commander and other commanders so what I'm
[1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:54.480]  saying to you right now is what you're seeing happening is exactly what Trump
[1:06:54.480 --> 1:07:00.200]  wanted to happen he's exposing now you got to remember one thing I've said
[1:07:00.200 --> 1:07:05.640]  about Trump he never fails at what he does and by the way he has remained
[1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:11.840]  silent only one individual picked that up repeatedly and that's Bill Maher of
[1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:20.520]  HBO he hit it right on the head why is Trump silent when in his history he has
[1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:25.480]  never been silent and part of the reason is and I'm going back to Sun Tzu he
[1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:30.080]  understands that in order to take back the power that he has he never gave it
[1:07:30.080 --> 1:07:35.840]  away he has to expose to the American public number one I said to you the
[1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:42.200]  Lincoln project was the disaster John Conway was a liar pathological liar and
[1:07:42.200 --> 1:07:47.240]  his wife was also a pathological iron cop did say in the interview of our
[1:07:47.240 --> 1:07:50.440]  member on the 13th that the Lincoln project was going down and about three
[1:07:50.440 --> 1:07:55.240]  days later or days later it started all right what was exposed beyond that was
[1:07:55.240 --> 1:08:01.160]  the homosexuality of John Weaver and the pedophilia that was rampant in the
[1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:07.280]  Lincoln project involving all kinds of guys named Schmidt Mitt Romney Bain
[1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:13.200]  Capitol Google if you look at who was involved in Lincoln project you have a
[1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:18.600]  whole list of advertisers and supporters including some of the major
[1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:24.240]  Republican Party why did he Trump do that he wanted to expose it on that end
[1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:31.080]  then the second part he's showing you how corrupt and stupid Biden is I said to
[1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:36.600]  you before the years Biden will pick those people who are incompetent and
[1:08:36.600 --> 1:08:42.200]  corrupt and primarily they were Jewish I have a synagogue going on there with
[1:08:42.200 --> 1:08:48.600]  Blanken with all kinds of people I've got 11 Jews in there all of whom I've never
[1:08:48.600 --> 1:08:53.240]  met before some of whom I have a lot of things in common but they're all
[1:08:53.240 --> 1:09:00.120]  incompetent they're all Route 28 and they are Washington insiders who are
[1:09:00.120 --> 1:09:05.320]  corrupt making their millions through government contracts in the military
[1:09:05.320 --> 1:09:10.800]  what did I say the first thing Biden would do he go to war what happened two
[1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:15.960]  days ago within 24 hours of the time Biden went in we went right back into
[1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:21.720]  Syria and we have one moron from the National Security Council and the
[1:09:21.720 --> 1:09:27.360]  State Department which is run by Blanken and Wendy Sherman I got a Jew on top
[1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:33.360]  there who's never been in the military and I have a 45-minute slip but I
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:37.200]  gotta unpack all this let's just go back let's just go with your scenario they
[1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:41.880]  are doing this anti-racism stand down let's talk about it let's talk about it
[1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:45.080]  because they are trying to purge the military right now they're saying they
[1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:48.200]  think there's a military coup you're saying there's a military coup what's
[1:09:48.200 --> 1:09:54.480]  going on there I just said it to you listen Alex listen I'm telling you
[1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:57.800]  listen crops gonna get inaugurated on the 20th I'm saying let's unpack that
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:03.840]  first I didn't say he was gonna get inaugurated on the 20th I never said
[1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:08.840]  that I said that he would still be president of the United States what's
[1:10:08.840 --> 1:10:14.240]  going on in Mar-a-Lago you tell me we have another White House that's fully
[1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:21.280]  staffed down in Palm Beach we have a military that hasn't changed command in
[1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:27.600]  any way and still in the White House and in other areas of the country why is
[1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:33.080]  all the Mitt Romney's being exposed for being totally corrupt why it's
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:38.920]  McConnell coming out to be the jerk and the corrupt son I'll say this I'll say
[1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:42.440]  well then talk to us because you're so smart like you said we haven't in the
[1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:45.840]  military like you like it's a magical level when you get there tell us then
[1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:50.120]  what's what's going on in your view I'm just telling you right now I said it's
[1:10:50.120 --> 1:10:55.520]  part of Sun Zoo you understand Alex what Sun Zoo is you allow the enemy to
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:11:01.480]  expose all of the faults that they have without intervening and he's showing it
[1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:07.760]  to you the Republican Party dead McConnell a total wastrel a corrupt
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:13.720]  individual Mitt Romney corrupt Mormon he reminds me of the days of the massacre
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:18.000]  of Meadows that the Mormons did when they slaughtered Christians he was
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:22.280]  warned and the Mormons were warned to take care of him and they didn't do it
[1:11:22.280 --> 1:11:27.800]  you've got a whole bunch of other people Alexandria who's going to be arrested so
[1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:35.360]  this goes on and on and on do I think it's going to be over in a day no is it
[1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:40.600]  going to be over in a few weeks I don't know the timing honestly because right
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:46.880]  now the exposure of the corruption and the degree to which is unbelievable even
[1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:50.640]  for a guy like me who worked in the Bush administrations and other
[1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:54.920]  administrations which I knew were corrupt and I stayed away from but you
[1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:59.240]  gotta remember I didn't make money I never took a degree I never took a
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:03.960]  right still a coup going on and Trump's got stay behind networks in like
[1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:07.640]  Obama did to him and so there's a power struggle in the bureaucracy I get that
[1:12:07.640 --> 1:12:11.640]  saying he's like co-president with Biden and now now now that we'll have people
[1:12:11.640 --> 1:12:15.760]  missing Trump and so Biden will be in and all the corruption will come out it
[1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:18.760]  will hamstring him I would believe a lot of that was happening if he hadn't killed
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:22.880]  the keystone pipeline a Biden wasn't sitting everybody back into war if all
[1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:26.680]  these great military guys are still in command under Trump well then why are we
[1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:33.920]  back in Syria I didn't say all these guys the guys I work with aren't cyber
[1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:38.160]  command and there's certain units whatever the come back let's come back
[1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:40.960]  and talk about that to the other side because I want to have a serious
[1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:44.800]  discussion about this and really get your take on this all right we'll be right

[1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:20.400]  we're still on air and in many ways stronger than ever at band.video and
[1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:26.560]  info wars.com forward slash show I'm alex jones your host utter Steve
[1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:31.960]  pacinic is face of the music here now he did say one thing that didn't happen
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:38.920]  one thing that did he was on the 13th of January he said that the pope has been
[1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:42.920]  arrested and he'll be out today he's been arrested today but he did say the
[1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:46.800]  Italian government will collapse tomorrow it actually took about a week
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:52.760]  we can have I guess nine nine days ten days or so so I'm sitting here and I'm
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:56.840]  a good gauge of BS okay and most of what pacinics told us over the years has
[1:15:56.840 --> 1:16:00.400]  been true but any disinfo most of it's true they had a poison pill but he
[1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:03.640]  legitimately if you look at him on Skype during the breaks you know looks
[1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:06.720]  like he feels like he's a good guy and he's telling the truth and we're all
[1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:11.080]  just wrong what does it mean he is God none of us are God I mean he could be
[1:16:11.080 --> 1:16:15.240]  wrong about things he could be right I mean is he legitimately saying this is
[1:16:15.240 --> 1:16:18.840]  he tied to the whole cute thing that's what I'm getting at but the idea here
[1:16:18.840 --> 1:16:25.240]  doc that you didn't say Trump would be the president on the 20th you were just
[1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:29.920]  saying that there'd be this on no no you did say that and so it's not about
[1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:33.760]  putting you down for that if you were wrong about something or I was talking
[1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:36.960]  one of the producers they said that you said the military didn't carry out what
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:40.640]  you thought they were going to do so somebody seriously unpack your thinking
[1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:44.080]  and what you really because I mean I see martial law in DC they're saying
[1:16:44.080 --> 1:16:48.240]  permanent troops I see federal mandates federal police on the streets for
[1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:53.120]  masks I see them the former director of counterterrorism the CIA saying we want
[1:16:53.120 --> 1:16:58.040]  a new reconstruction we want to arrest tens of thousands of people I see them
[1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:03.560]  trying to start an actual civil war so I get the militaries awake and upset they
[1:17:03.560 --> 1:17:08.080]  are trying to purge the military they are trying a 60-day stand down while
[1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:11.720]  China takes over the South China Sea so I agree with you there's lots of coup
[1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:16.720]  counter coup stuff but boil it down from your view so people get your
[1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:19.960]  perspective so they don't just think you know that because it was out of Freudian
[1:17:19.960 --> 1:17:23.800]  slip you're disgusting audience or you mean some people that said disgusting
[1:17:23.800 --> 1:17:28.600]  things about you because most the audience doesn't hate you honestly I
[1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:32.480]  don't even read most of the comments let me let me be very frank I'm not
[1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:37.480]  interested in what your audience says or doesn't say I don't really listen well
[1:17:37.480 --> 1:17:43.160]  you said you said it listen to me Alex you want me on the show cool it cool it
[1:17:43.160 --> 1:17:48.240]  here's the military to do with Q I don't even know who Q is I don't read that
[1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:53.600]  nonsense I have nothing to do with Q or anybody else other than you you're the
[1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:58.560]  only show I go on I don't read comments I don't read Twitter I don't read the
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:02.480]  internet so that's not me there's somebody else doing it and I appreciate
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:06.760]  what they're doing now let's get down to basics I said to you there was a
[1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:12.200]  military coup and it's still an effect what exactly is Trump doing you think
[1:18:12.200 --> 1:18:17.160]  Trump is just sitting there and waiting and writing a novel what do you think is
[1:18:17.160 --> 1:18:22.120]  going on when we're exposing the Republicans the Democrats we're
[1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:28.000]  exposing the Lincoln project we've exposed all the senators McConnell how do
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:32.120]  you expose a guy like McConnell if you don't allow him to come out and show
[1:18:32.120 --> 1:18:37.200]  what a coward he really is and how dangerous he was or Mitt Romney how many
[1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:41.880]  times do we have to say Mitt Romney was in bane capital it was corrupt how many
[1:18:41.880 --> 1:18:45.600]  times do the Mormons have to be told that they have to get rid of Mitt Romney
[1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:50.360]  or they have another metal massacre where they killed Christians how many times
[1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:54.920]  do you think this goes on I'm not in charge of the timing I was asked to do
[1:18:54.920 --> 1:19:00.120]  what I did I worked with a few select people and that's what I I have faith in
[1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:06.080]  in the past I've done my own poos on my own I've done what I had to do never
[1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:11.600]  apologize I've had all these contravailing sides against me even in the
[1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:16.400]  other administrations that doesn't bother me the only thing I'm saying to you
[1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:21.960]  why I went on the show wasn't to be right or wrong that's not what I'm about I am
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:27.040]  the son of the Republic and in the Republic there are people with me who
[1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:32.040]  believe in what we're doing let me give you an example I live in a small town in
[1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:38.600]  northern Florida we got hate mail from the from the from the post office that
[1:19:38.600 --> 1:19:43.840]  said we Republicans are out of control and basically should come back to the
[1:19:43.840 --> 1:19:48.840]  mainstream I don't know what that came out of I know that the FBI came into our
[1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:55.040]  town a small town with less than 2000 and I told you the FBI was corrupt I told
[1:19:55.040 --> 1:19:59.640]  you they were incompetent and what do they do they go around and intimidate
[1:19:59.640 --> 1:20:05.240]  people who may have been there at the Capitol and did nothing wrong they don't
[1:20:05.240 --> 1:20:08.720]  go and arrest other people because they're incompetent they're corrupt
[1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:13.160]  that's what you're beginning to see and that's what the American people are
[1:20:13.160 --> 1:20:18.360]  seeing no one in this area and the Baptist Southern area or in any other
[1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:23.560]  area I know in the South have taken down their Trump signs go around and go into
[1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:27.360]  the streets and see how many Trump signs there are and how many people still
[1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:31.920]  sure even Democrats have said that that Trump support is going up but you
[1:20:31.920 --> 1:20:35.720]  specifically let's just get this straight because people understand if you
[1:20:35.720 --> 1:20:39.920]  were wrong about time error whatever you legitimately thought Trump would end up
[1:20:39.920 --> 1:20:44.000]  being sworn in on the 20th you said he's gonna be the president I didn't say you
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:48.240]  be on the 20th he will be he is still the president of the United States and
[1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:52.600]  he will continue to be the president well I know he won the election and it's
[1:20:52.600 --> 1:20:56.800]  important not to recognize Biden so so so tell me this what is your view on
[1:20:56.800 --> 1:21:02.280]  what's gonna unfold how long will it take I mean what's gonna unfold what is
[1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:06.520]  unfolding I'm telling you we're arresting different people how long will it
[1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:11.680]  take I just told you what I do not know and I don't want to know is the
[1:21:11.680 --> 1:21:16.440]  ongoing timing is this a day a week it's a couple of months I said to you it
[1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:22.440]  takes time when in fact we initiated we did this years ago to do a sting up
[1:21:22.440 --> 1:21:27.480]  operation that was years ago where it was marked and people didn't believe that
[1:21:27.480 --> 1:21:32.880]  the the Dominions were controlled or that we had a sense of what was going on
[1:21:32.880 --> 1:21:37.760]  in the ballot as well as the voting machine it turned out to be exactly what
[1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:41.920]  we thought we knew exactly what the timing was when the votes came out and
[1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:46.360]  they were fraud it's up to the people who are involved in the White House and
[1:21:46.360 --> 1:21:51.080]  their national security concerns they don't ask me about the timing what they
[1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:55.880]  asked me to do is what I did on your show and the rest of it it's just to give
[1:21:55.880 --> 1:21:59.360]  them the support that they need okay well let me tell you let me tell you
[1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:03.080]  talking to folks that are currently folks you've worked with before down there
[1:22:03.080 --> 1:22:06.240]  in South Florida special operations command I've actually talked to some of
[1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:11.120]  the head people there who I know and separately and some here closer to home
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:16.040]  and they said Biden was hijacking the cue thing hoping that the Capitol would
[1:22:16.040 --> 1:22:18.800]  be bigger hoping there'd be an insurrection to bring in real
[1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:23.440]  martial law they're planning false flags try to trigger a civil war and the
[1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:26.640]  Patriots the Pentagon are worried about it and when we come back I'll show you
[1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:32.320]  where CIA counter is CIA counterterrorism chiefs suggest going to war

[1:23:53.920 --> 1:24:00.120]  mutations this is forced evolution or de-evolution when you look at all the
[1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:03.680]  major research all the major programs are carrying out they are not to produce
[1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:08.800]  people that are smarter or folks that live longer or more oral no it's turning
[1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:12.840]  humanity into a commodity now we see some drop again like communist China

[1:24:33.640 --> 1:24:37.520]  Alex we know it hurts a lot of people that's for a greater good but that's not
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:41.440]  even true and it violates the Geneva Convention the Nuremberg Code federal
[1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:45.800]  state law this is violence being carried out against us by the military we have

[1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:24.200]  host waging war on corruption crashing the lies and disinformation
[1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:28.800]  all right getting really serious here i'll tell you this we're not a normal
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:33.680]  point for america you have martial law in dc you have total censorship going on
[1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:37.480]  you have list cheney with a 10% approval rate with republicans promoter into
[1:27:37.480 --> 1:27:41.880]  leadership you have communist china openly putting out red lines threatening
[1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:48.840]  to attack basically invading hong kong threatening to invade taiwan and joe
[1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:55.440]  biden is gone and can't even talk a few times they rolled him out very bizarre
[1:27:55.440 --> 1:28:05.280]  stuff going on and so all i know is that they're trying to start a civil war with
[1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:11.360]  the american people someone asked dr. t picinic his take on that here's a o c
[1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:14.960]  claims she was going to die during capital right wasn't even the building
[1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:20.960]  but this is what gets serious we've seen the press secretary sake laugh at
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:23.920]  space force and say it doesn't exist you know there's a giant secret space
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:27.120]  program a lot of it declassified she says oh how do you even talk to those
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:30.200]  people well that adds the whole thing that that's like nasa kennedy set that
[1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:35.640]  up as a shadow government so yeah i mean picinic trying to give courage like
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:39.800]  obama and hillary did like hang on brennan said to the democrats inside
[1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:43.200]  you'll keep fighting trump if he's saying hang on the government be your own
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:47.200]  government will trump still in command that's kind of a simple psychological
[1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:52.720]  gestalt of the banner of the signet to you know the roman eagle still up there
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:55.680]  so people don't give up i mean if that's what he's doing he's just be honest
[1:28:55.680 --> 1:28:59.640]  about it but cia counterterrorism she suggests going to war against domestic
[1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:04.560]  insurgent and he says we may have to have a war with our own countrymen and
[1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:09.760]  have a new reconstruction i mean this is just fabulous try to start a fight crazy
[1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:13.560]  town the new defense secretary doesn't know what planet he's on saying there's
[1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:17.280]  america's evil and racist i mean one place you know what saying that's the
[1:29:17.280 --> 1:29:24.480]  military i mean 60 day stand down to root out the insurgents i mean what in
[1:29:24.480 --> 1:29:28.720]  the hell is going on so definitely we're not in
[1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:32.560]  kansas anymore steve picinic and and and you were talking to the producer maybe
[1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:35.520]  she got it wrong but you did think something big was gonna happen that day
[1:29:35.520 --> 1:29:40.400]  now you think they messed it up and didn't do it properly or did you not say that
[1:29:40.400 --> 1:29:45.600]  didn't say that i just said it would take time in my mind i didn't know exactly
[1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:52.080]  when and how long it would take number one the cia has been always replete with
[1:29:52.080 --> 1:29:56.880]  incompetence and corruption i mean we saw that you get we got rid of jenna
[1:29:56.880 --> 1:30:00.480]  haspel whoever said you know we have domestic
[1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:06.800]  terrorist i mean what you're seeing now is the exposure of a corrupt
[1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:12.960]  incompetent regime of biden and all his people and what it really is it's not
[1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:18.960]  only an indictment of biden forget that it's an indictment of obama and
[1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:24.400]  brandon this goes to the heart of the matter obama as i told you
[1:30:24.400 --> 1:30:31.680]  was a gay flaming homosexual nobody who came was the cia operative and brandon
[1:30:31.680 --> 1:30:37.120]  was his control officer and both of them messed up so you have people there
[1:30:37.120 --> 1:30:42.400]  who are sectaries that defend sectaries of state who started a war in ibrac
[1:30:42.400 --> 1:30:49.120]  where we lost five thousand started a war in libya started a war in yemen sumalia
[1:30:49.120 --> 1:30:55.680]  sudan afghanistan syria am i getting through to you how incompetent
[1:30:55.680 --> 1:31:01.200]  and what we have to show they stole the election and took over
[1:31:01.200 --> 1:31:04.480]  they stole what election they stole the election or take it over
[1:31:04.480 --> 1:31:09.360]  they're so incompetent let me ask you how do you know they stole the election
[1:31:09.360 --> 1:31:14.640]  what we are the numbers coming in our trump had double triple quadruple in
[1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:19.440]  battleground states before they shut down the election that night stole it
[1:31:19.440 --> 1:31:23.600]  and you say there's a set of complete right you think that's over
[1:31:23.600 --> 1:31:28.080]  and i'm sure i never give up but i'm also realistic about what i face

[1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:11.200]  i you and i don't agree but what we are having hold on hold on hold on you're
[1:32:11.200 --> 1:32:14.720]  saying that leftist groups aren't controlling and manipulating right-wing
[1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:17.360]  terror groups and winning a false flag i mean they're gearing up with the
[1:32:17.360 --> 1:32:19.120]  pentagon to go out to the american people
[1:32:19.120 --> 1:32:22.240]  they've got cia counterterrorism head saying they want a war with us
[1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:26.720]  this is treason this is criminal this is disgusting this is a war on us
[1:32:26.720 --> 1:32:30.640]  not us kicking ass not us winning not us taking over they're running the tables
[1:32:30.640 --> 1:32:33.600]  against us and and unless we wake up to this and have the states
[1:32:33.600 --> 1:32:37.040]  and good governors like the santas repudiated we're in deep trouble and
[1:32:37.040 --> 1:32:39.440]  these idiots are gonna start a war they're gonna lose in the end but it's
[1:32:39.440 --> 1:32:43.040]  not gonna be fun
[1:32:43.920 --> 1:32:48.880]  i'm in a state where the sanftis is here he's in military intelligence after
[1:32:48.880 --> 1:32:53.040]  you're yelling and screaming would you like to know who he really is
[1:32:53.040 --> 1:32:57.760]  he's the guy who came out of jacksonville had no special privileges
[1:32:57.760 --> 1:33:01.760]  went to harvard and yell and then was a special force
[1:33:01.760 --> 1:33:06.080]  and now here in florida we're not listening to either fouchie who by the
[1:33:06.080 --> 1:33:09.600]  way was exposed isn't that interesting trump didn't
[1:33:09.600 --> 1:33:13.200]  have to say he was a total fraud because the new york times
[1:33:13.200 --> 1:33:16.800]  and the atlantic monthly exposed the bullshit
[1:33:16.800 --> 1:33:21.680]  that fouchie has been saying and the nonsense about wearing a mask now you
[1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:25.600]  don't wear one mask you wear two masks so take it easy alex
[1:33:25.600 --> 1:33:29.280]  listen to what's going on do not get upset
[1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:32.800]  and what i want is that i'm nice to you and i i think you actually believe the
[1:33:32.800 --> 1:33:35.120]  stuff you're saying and you're an interesting talk show host and people
[1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:37.280]  like you on the show so i like you as a person
[1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:41.280]  but the patronizing dude i'm 47 years old i've been around the block 100 times
[1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:45.440]  i don't patronize you i'm being serious about this
[1:33:45.440 --> 1:33:49.760]  what do you want me to say i've said to you alex
[1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:55.680]  i've said to you exactly what's happening am i patronizing you no
[1:33:55.680 --> 1:33:59.840]  am i saying you're wrong yes am i saying that
[1:33:59.840 --> 1:34:06.240]  biden administration will not last yes am i saying this is part of the scyops in
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:09.760]  order to expose to the american public the amount of
[1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:13.840]  corruption not only the democrat i agree with you that he's the worst
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:16.640]  damn choice i mean if you want to discredit your party
[1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:19.840]  i agree with you that this is looks like a disaster how do they extricate
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:24.160]  themselves from biden when kamala is even more unpopular
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:28.880]  that's correct and that's what we're waiting for to see when she comes in and
[1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:33.680]  what the problems will be but at the same time when were you ever exposed to the
[1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:36.480]  fact that mcconnell was corrupt and was an
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:41.520]  operative of the chinese shipping building when were you exposed to the
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:46.720]  fact that lindsay grayham was ineffectual a homosexual even though he
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:52.560]  served in the army when was that exposed no it is all starting to come out i
[1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:57.360]  the democrats are now panicking wanting a war because they can't win the political
[1:34:57.360 --> 1:35:00.800]  fight i agree that they're trying to start a civil war because they're losing
[1:35:00.800 --> 1:35:04.320]  i'm concerned about them staging it bullet
[1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:08.480]  there is no civil war they can't stage anything right now
[1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:16.000]  we have control over the entire country that's why we deputized army command i
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:20.400]  don't know about south com i've been to south com i'm not dealing with south com
[1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:24.720]  so much better okay what do you want me to say to you
[1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:29.120]  minima just had a coup now who initiated the coup
[1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:32.240]  well i know that's a soros group and then the globalists are pissed i know
[1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:37.120]  pompeos pissed i know the democrats are pissed oh and who did i say didn't i say
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:41.520]  to you pompeo was a disaster secretary of state didn't i tell you
[1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:47.600]  that tense was a disaster sec as as vice president it all came out how would it
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:52.080]  have come out if trump didn't allow it to happen
[1:35:52.080 --> 1:35:55.600]  how would you have exposed it no no i told listeners that in a way
[1:35:55.600 --> 1:35:59.440]  biden being in is worse for the globalist agenda than if trump stayed in
[1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:03.280]  because they could keep wow remember what i said to you
[1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:06.400]  the globalist or whatever party you want to do
[1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:11.520]  is in the process of self-destruction and that's what you're watching right now
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:15.280]  and trumpling is allowing to happen he said it to you
[1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:19.760]  i will be back he then says i'm not going to say a word
[1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:24.240]  and then there's all kinds of exposures let me say this do one more segment with
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:27.840]  us because you there you've got a point remember trump at whirlpool like eight
[1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:31.360]  months ago he said i he said listen i just cut
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:35.520]  off the middleman i cut off the globalist i may not be here for a while
[1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:39.360]  but i'll be back remember he said i'm gonna be gone for a while
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:42.960]  that that was when he said that i'm like i'm gonna be gone
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:46.960]  for a while but let's find that clip guys trump says i'm about to be gone for a
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:50.400]  while mountain patriot in colorado thank you for
[1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:53.760]  holding how you doing alex man i'm just working as
[1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:56.240]  hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you
[1:36:56.240 --> 1:36:59.440]  i love you man i want to uh make a quick plug
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:04.000]  that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while and i just went
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.360]  looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains
[1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:13.040]  quercetin which according to some published studies that dr mercola has
[1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:18.320]  cited is an ion of four similar to hydroxychloroquine
[1:37:18.320 --> 1:37:21.200]  and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so
[1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:26.320]  people might want to take a look at that all i know is with dna force
[1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:29.520]  we went out and looked at these high-end products
[1:37:29.520 --> 1:37:32.480]  that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor
[1:37:32.480 --> 1:37:35.520]  sold like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and
[1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:39.280]  it was really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two
[1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:42.800]  different top brands together and that's what produced this so thanks
[1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:47.360]  thanks for the plug

[1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:06.480]  all right dr. steve pacinic is our guest i'm alex jones your host we appreciate
[1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:11.440]  him joining us today okay i'm not name dropping i just finally got this they
[1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:15.040]  just delivered it two minutes ago so i thought i'd talk about this it's so cool
[1:41:15.040 --> 1:41:17.520]  because the clock is ticking down america in the world i don't have time to
[1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:21.200]  program this yet i don't know how to do it three of these clocks exist of this
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:24.400]  type one joe rogan has he gave another to elan musk
[1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:27.600]  i liked it he just got me one and just got delivered today
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:31.520]  i just plugged it in like two minutes ago so it's this is not a digital clock
[1:41:31.520 --> 1:41:35.360]  it's not a mechanical clock it is an electrical clock
[1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:38.640]  so it's a very interesting rare clock out of canada
[1:41:38.640 --> 1:41:41.920]  and the guy makes these only like i don't know 20 or so a year and there's only
[1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:46.960]  three of this clock very interesting kind of symbolic of the countdown
[1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:50.480]  on the republic and so we're here discussing all this but i'm talking
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:54.320]  to dr. steve pacinic and obviously the democrats are scared they put 30 000
[1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:57.120]  troops now they want more troops now they're saying it's permanent now they
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:00.400]  want a new civil war now they want to arrest everybody now they're obsessed
[1:42:00.400 --> 1:42:03.600]  with trump they're saying he's getting more popular not less that
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:07.680]  that actually has credibility with pacinic saying uh pacinic in my opinion
[1:42:07.680 --> 1:42:11.280]  is walking back a little bit that had this big events could happen on the 20th
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:14.400]  but but i do agree they stole the election trump is the president but
[1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:17.840]  here he is last year seven eight months ago i'm going from
[1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:22.560]  memory maybe you guys can find the date here he is at a appliance factory
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:26.480]  in the midwest saying hey i've i've stood up to big pharma we're paying the
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:29.040]  highest prizes i've cut the prizes which he did by half
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:32.640]  they're going to come after me i'm going to be gone for a while
[1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:37.280]  here it is you have to produce a product and it has to be a good product
[1:42:37.280 --> 1:42:41.680]  but the middlemen well the rebate that i'm doing cuts out the middlemen and it
[1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:46.960]  reduces costs and the money goes back to the people purchasing the drugs so i
[1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:50.240]  have a lot of enemies out there this may be the last time you'll see me for a
[1:42:50.240 --> 1:42:53.440]  while a lot of very very rich enemies but they
[1:42:53.440 --> 1:42:58.000]  are not happy with what i'm doing but i figure we have one chance to do it and
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:00.320]  no other president is going to do what i do
[1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:06.160]  no other president would do a favorite nations a rebate a buy from other
[1:43:06.160 --> 1:43:11.600]  nations at much less cost nobody and there are a lot of unhappy people
[1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:14.640]  and then he said at the military base before he got on the planet for a
[1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:18.640]  long ago he said i will i will be back so so that adds
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:21.760]  something there to what you're saying chenny i just want to put all our marbles
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:27.280]  on trump i'm genuinely concerned about biden and the chinese and their red line
[1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:30.480]  and now a 60 day standout of the military because we're racist
[1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:34.240]  i mean this this doesn't look good so so i mean they're definitely trying to start
[1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:37.600]  a civil war you don't agree with that
[1:43:37.600 --> 1:43:42.480]  they can try whatever they want what trump is doing and you have to think for
[1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:46.080]  a minute how he thinks that's what i'm working with
[1:43:46.080 --> 1:43:51.760]  he basically is allowing us the american public both democrats and
[1:43:51.760 --> 1:43:57.200]  republicans to see how truly corrupt this entire
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:03.360]  government and country is bar none now why is he the only one to do this it's
[1:44:03.360 --> 1:44:08.880]  not because he's just morally righteous it's because he's a businessman
[1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:13.440]  he understands the very core of what corruption is about
[1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:17.040]  he understands the dynamics but he's not going to stand there
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:20.560]  and give you a lecture on the dynamics of corruption
[1:44:20.560 --> 1:44:24.160]  nor is he going to tell you how great he is which he has told you
[1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:29.200]  but he's now going to show you in effect what he was talking about and what
[1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:33.840]  he's doing is allowing the audience to watch a tv show
[1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:39.200]  without trump being there and well i do it with you that their ratings of plunge
[1:44:39.200 --> 1:44:42.480]  they're falling apart now that he's not there and the fact that he won't resist
[1:44:42.480 --> 1:44:45.920]  them they're actually bitching now wanting a fight with his supporters
[1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:48.880]  because they need us as the cover for what they're doing
[1:44:48.880 --> 1:44:52.960]  let me ask you something in in the in the world of sun zoo
[1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:56.480]  in the world of where we fight let's say in martial arts
[1:44:56.480 --> 1:45:03.200]  a defensive position has an offensive element so you've got to think
[1:45:03.200 --> 1:45:06.240]  a little bit like draws them out it makes them make their next moves you can
[1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:09.920]  use their energy against them that's what he's been doing so governor
[1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:15.360]  nuesome of of hot of california we have 1.3
[1:45:15.360 --> 1:45:20.320]  million signatures for a recall on this corrupt
[1:45:20.320 --> 1:45:26.960]  nephew of alessandra or nancy pelosi we've got a young man running against
[1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:31.760]  maxine waters who's now in trouble because she's so corrupt
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:37.040]  such a liar and pathological corrupt individual she's paying her kids millions
[1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:40.400]  of bucks but that my point is this what he's
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.400]  letting you do is the biggest apprentice show he's ever done
[1:45:44.400 --> 1:45:50.240]  he's putting america into project he's literally showing you the american
[1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:55.040]  show which is massive corruption and the first president
[1:45:55.040 --> 1:45:58.720]  we didn't have it with bush senior he was corrupt i worked with him we didn't
[1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:03.360]  have it with nixon he was corrupt jimmy carter he was corrupt
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:08.080]  clinton's they were corrupt okay let me let me let me just tell you
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:11.360]  what i've witnessed trump means well he cares about the country he's not out to
[1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:13.760]  get us he was the president that pissed him off
[1:46:13.760 --> 1:46:16.800]  i was there when almost the whole white house was gone
[1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:20.800]  and and he had like 10 staffers that were loyal and then and then and then the
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:24.320]  secret service stood down at the capital and he literally pointed at me and i
[1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:26.880]  led the people out i was like my god this is really happening
[1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:30.480]  then we got set up so just the idea that trumps got all this
[1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:33.920]  masterful stuff going on this sounds like a reboot
[1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:37.200]  i mean i agree politically what you're saying is happening this is destroying
[1:46:37.200 --> 1:46:40.560]  by the democrats worse than ever as they turn the economy off as they launch
[1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:43.280]  all these wars people are like whoa this is horrible
[1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:46.720]  i get it at a macchiavelli level or a sunsue level or a napoleon level
[1:46:46.720 --> 1:46:49.040]  they'll interrupt your enemy while they're destroying themselves but
[1:46:49.040 --> 1:46:52.560]  i mean they're destroying us they're they're they're coming after our guns
[1:46:52.560 --> 1:46:57.200]  they are i think they'll lose in the end but they're just crazy so i i just don't
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:02.560]  i mean i know people that know trump well he's isolated at marlago right now
[1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:07.920]  and what what the point is what the point is you're saying trump is like you
[1:47:07.920 --> 1:47:10.640]  know mr spacely and the jessons with all his
[1:47:10.640 --> 1:47:15.280]  hands on the levers from my information he he needs to be out the public
[1:47:15.280 --> 1:47:18.640]  fighting he needs to be exposing he needs to go into that trial to
[1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:22.720]  annihilate them in the senate and be thrown in that briar patch instead
[1:47:22.720 --> 1:47:25.680]  he's totally cut off with a bunch of cowardly lawyers selling to be afraid of a
[1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:31.200]  shadow how do you know he's totally cut off
[1:47:31.200 --> 1:47:34.960]  i mean i mean i've talked to the president some people that talk to him i
[1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:39.280]  know i know the lawyers that are involved i mean i know that he's cut off
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:45.760]  and what is this next trial about the second impeachment what does that mean
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:49.520]  no it's totally fake that even john roberts isn't involved it's a sham now
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:52.720]  they're trying to back off of it i think he should go into that briar patch and
[1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:58.800]  use that to expose him but he's already when did you ever hear besides
[1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:03.200]  what i have said that john roberts is one of the most corrupt supreme court
[1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:08.080]  justices we've ever had he's been involved with malta he's been involved
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:11.200]  with all kinds of problems and an adoption
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:15.200]  of kids when did you ever hear that other than for me and now you're beginning
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:18.960]  to see how the chief justice of the supreme court
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:22.960]  is so corrupt and what may have happened to another chief
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:26.960]  just was somebody killed by the way was there a
[1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:29.600]  member of the supreme court who might have been killed
[1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:35.040]  i don't know you tell me but when you go directly to the enemy you show me
[1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:39.360]  exactly what your strengths are and exactly what your weaknesses
[1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:44.480]  when you withdraw i have no idea of what sure no that's a trump tactic to say
[1:48:44.480 --> 1:48:48.480]  okay i'm for gun control what do you want we want to totally ban guns and that

[1:52:44.720 --> 1:52:48.320]  you must guard the very genetic code of the planet the globalists have set
[1:52:48.320 --> 1:52:51.600]  themselves up as the guardians of this world
[1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:54.080]  but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and
[1:52:54.080 --> 1:52:57.440]  poisoning the planet they are the ones that are now
[1:52:57.440 --> 1:53:01.520]  engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth
[1:53:01.520 --> 1:53:05.840]  to the GMO crops and now they've moved on to their main target
[1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:10.320]  humanity with the mRNA vaccines which are not vaccines
[1:53:10.320 --> 1:53:14.160]  they are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned
[1:53:14.160 --> 1:53:19.200]  phenosis we're then inserted into your genome to take over
[1:53:19.200 --> 1:53:23.840]  your body's systems go read the actual inserts
[1:53:23.840 --> 1:53:28.560]  for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned
[1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:32.320]  this is the equivalent of an alien takeover whether it's interdimensional
[1:53:32.320 --> 1:53:35.200]  whether it's little green men the globalists are acting like another
[1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:37.520]  species that's overtaking us and overriding us
[1:53:37.520 --> 1:53:40.640]  it's all the same in the end
[1:53:40.640 --> 1:53:48.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:54:00.080]  and look he he actually goes to coffee shops and reads poetry
[1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:03.840]  in his off time so this guy doesn't just go out their books with tom clancy or
[1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:07.600]  help found out the force he's reading poetry
[1:54:07.600 --> 1:54:10.880]  and and and everybody gets really excited when he talks about who it's
[1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:14.240]  dedicated to this is uh called impending chaos by
[1:54:14.240 --> 1:54:18.960]  steve pacenic here's the end of it
[1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:23.040]  capable of accepting all those false narratives
[1:54:23.040 --> 1:54:29.600]  recounted long ago time time time again
[1:54:29.600 --> 1:54:35.920]  chaos arrives long forgotten in a bounding without infinite vitality
[1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:41.520]  to a limit and disintegrate matter into electronic
[1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:46.000]  penetrating the invisible and the digital
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:55.360]  silence returns to those who do not die or disappear
[1:54:55.360 --> 1:55:09.760]  valorian in excelsis the capitalist lucifer
[1:55:09.760 --> 1:55:15.600]  amen what what is this so it's like oh false narratives but someday they'll
[1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:19.280]  come true like hb lovecraft like someday even death may die
[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:23.520]  so is this a love letter to lucifer steve pacenic are you
[1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:27.840]  secretly got a little heart for the devil
[1:55:27.840 --> 1:55:33.360]  no i have the heart for no no neither the devil nor the angels what i have a
[1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:37.200]  heart for is simply and why i go on your show
[1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:39.920]  you're the only show i ever go on is number one
[1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:44.640]  your incredible intelligence number two your incredible sense of humor
[1:55:44.640 --> 1:55:48.320]  from wherever it came you have an incredible sense of humor
[1:55:48.320 --> 1:55:53.520]  and i happen to enjoy it now as lucifer and the son of lucifer
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:58.240]  i basically look at cold fact when 9 11 occurred
[1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:03.520]  i was ostracized within minutes i was deprecated ostracized
[1:56:03.520 --> 1:56:07.120]  and bob gates of the secretary of defense
[1:56:07.120 --> 1:56:11.200]  and the former dci whom i couldn't admire at all i thought he was
[1:56:11.200 --> 1:56:15.040]  disgusting and stupid because he couldn't get in the rand corporation
[1:56:15.040 --> 1:56:19.280]  basically warned me not to do a coup and yet we had a shift
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:23.520]  in generals and what i'm beginning to tell you is simple
[1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:27.600]  look nobody owes me anything i owe nothing to everybody
[1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:33.840]  anybody i enjoy what i do i love what you say and what you do we don't always
[1:56:33.840 --> 1:56:36.800]  agree but for the most part i will be right
[1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:41.920]  and sometimes you will be wrong but that's not unusual for you because
[1:56:41.920 --> 1:56:46.720]  that's what you enjoy and the entretomb between the both of us
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:52.240]  is poetic i don't want to be right i don't need to be right i don't get paid
[1:56:52.240 --> 1:56:55.840]  no it's certainly radio it's certainly good radio even though i disagree with
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:56:58.480]  some stuff people don't have someone only disagree with them i think it's good
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:02.240]  to have people on the disagree i agree with you but the most
[1:57:02.240 --> 1:57:06.800]  important part here and i i'm i seriously mean it and and you have to

[1:57:21.120 --> 1:57:24.720]  means he is on to himself no you're right he's now a symbol of our
[1:57:24.720 --> 1:57:27.600]  populism so we need to celebrate him as our president
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:33.200]  regardless correct but he will be back as our president
[1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:37.680]  and it's not as simple as anybody would you host a daily show with with with

[1:58:20.720 --> 1:58:23.520]  all right well i i think you meant what you said and i don't think you did it out
[1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:25.680]  of meanness or madness and that's what my gut tells me
[1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:28.960]  so steven shane dot com hey come back on next week
[1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:32.880]  we're challenging david night he come in studio and we will okay all right
[1:58:32.880 --> 1:58:36.000]  hey steven shane dot com thank you so much for another guest coming up
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.560]  i appreciate your time with us all right we'll be right back
[1:58:38.560 --> 1:58:41.360]  well that was a powerful interview ladies and gentlemen and definitely something
[1:58:41.360 --> 1:58:44.480]  is going on i don't know what it is but it's crazy the office of the
[1:58:44.480 --> 1:58:50.080]  former president there are thousands of ideologies out there
[1:58:50.080 --> 1:58:53.280]  hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the
[1:58:53.280 --> 1:58:56.960]  globalist info wars is truly the tip of the
[1:58:56.960 --> 1:59:00.080]  sphere of the zeitgeist that's what a globalist are obsessed with it
[1:59:00.080 --> 1:59:03.920]  trying to shut it down i didn't invent all this i went and researched the
[1:59:03.920 --> 1:59:07.600]  renaissance americana and what really works for humanity
[1:59:07.600 --> 1:59:11.440]  and i'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular
[1:59:11.440 --> 1:59:14.640]  like it's always been that's why the globalists are trying
[1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:18.400]  to shut it down so desperately because we have the light
[1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:21.360]  in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine
[1:59:21.360 --> 1:59:24.880]  so whatever you do continue to support yourself and info wars
[1:59:24.880 --> 1:59:27.920]  by buying the great products at info wars store dot com by spreading the
[1:59:27.920 --> 1:59:31.440]  articles by spreading the videos and by praying for this operation and for
[1:59:31.440 --> 1:59:34.960]  praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment
[1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:38.640]  for myself and the whole info wars family i want to thank all of you for
[1:59:38.640 --> 1:59:42.800]  what you've done because without you info wars is nothing
[1:59:42.800 --> 1:59:47.360]  you are the info war and i salute you
[1:59:47.360 --> 2:00:05.200]  the following was written by dr gad said about the narcissism and grandiosity
[2:00:05.200 --> 2:00:09.120]  of celebrities let me explain yet again the source
[2:00:09.120 --> 2:00:14.320]  for all the platitudinous virtue signaling the truly privileged elites
[2:00:14.320 --> 2:00:20.400]  know that deep down they are frauds they suffer from existential guilt hence
[2:00:20.400 --> 2:00:24.720]  one of the ways by which they assuage the guilt albatross around their necks
[2:00:24.720 --> 2:00:28.480]  is to demonstrate to the world that they are truly compassionate
[2:00:28.480 --> 2:00:35.440]  truly loving truly caring truly profound hence they love all undocumented
[2:00:35.440 --> 2:00:39.760]  immigrants they love mother earth they love the ozone layer they love
[2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:46.000]  blm they love socialism they love inner cities they hate the gentrification of
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:51.280]  neighborhoods they love mentors of color they cherish diversity
[2:00:51.280 --> 2:00:56.480]  they love lgbtq movies they adore queer architecture
[2:00:56.480 --> 2:01:00.320]  they are better than you more caring more cultured
[2:01:00.320 --> 2:01:05.280]  more empathetic this permits them to sleep better at night
[2:01:05.280 --> 2:01:10.880]  see i'm not a fraud i may be a gargantuan parasitic hedge fund bsr
[2:01:10.880 --> 2:01:14.880]  but i really care i may be an overpaid bs actor
[2:01:14.880 --> 2:01:20.960]  but i fight for solar panels those fly over rubes you know down there
[2:01:20.960 --> 2:01:25.680]  deserve their lot in life they are racists who bed their siblings
[2:01:25.680 --> 2:01:30.720]  we are science supporters who fight against mother earth rapists
[2:01:30.720 --> 2:01:36.320]  while flying in our private jets it is a classic ego defensive strategy
[2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:40.880]  that permits the ruling class to exist within their fractured selves
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:44.640]  and if decent people don't wake up against what is taking place
[2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:49.120]  you will wake up and say what happened to my liberties
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:52.800]  stop giving your support to the parasites cowards and traders
[2:01:52.800 --> 2:01:56.880]  in pop culture support the truth support the new renaissance
[2:01:56.880 --> 2:02:01.360]  support the information war
[2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:05.280]  former senator john carrey is your new climate czar joe biden hired him the
[2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:09.840]  other day a lot of czars all of a sudden so we want to keep them separate
[2:02:09.840 --> 2:02:13.280]  the climate czar is very different from a reality czar which apparently we're
[2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:16.960]  also getting the climate czar is not worried about reality or science for
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:20.640]  that matter any of that the climate czar fights climate change
[2:02:20.640 --> 2:02:23.680]  and if facts or common sense get in the way of that the climate czar will fight
[2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:26.880]  those two it's the perfect role for john carrey john carrey has divided his
[2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:30.720]  entire life to taking on global warming by contributing as much to global
[2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:34.320]  warming as he possibly can over the past year today i'm just one among
[2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:37.600]  many examples john carrey's private jet yes he has one
[2:02:37.600 --> 2:02:41.520]  has spent at least 20 hours in the air admitting in the process
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:44.720]  more than a hundred metric tons of carbon emissions
[2:02:44.720 --> 2:02:48.080]  much more than you will emit in a lifetime since you don't have
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:52.960]  a private jet john carrey is the kind of leader who leads by negative examples
[2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:56.960]  well in 2019 the world finally recognized john carrey's sacrifice his
[2:02:56.960 --> 2:03:01.200]  enduring commitment to doing precisely what he wants
[2:03:01.200 --> 2:03:04.720]  while preventing you from doing the same john carrey was given in recognition
[2:03:04.720 --> 2:03:07.520]  of this something called the arctic circle award
[2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:11.440]  that award recognizes his efforts to quote tackle environmental matters
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:15.760]  naturally john carrey flew all the way to iceland that's 3000 miles away
[2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:21.120]  on his private jet to accept this honor in his acceptance speech john carrey made
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:23.120]  it very clear that people like john carrey
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:27.120]  make him very angry in order to fight climate change john carrey said
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:30.640]  we need to do exactly the opposite of what john carrey himself
[2:03:30.640 --> 2:03:34.240]  is doing at the moment people are dying around the world
[2:03:34.240 --> 2:03:38.880]  because of climate change i see it in my country
[2:03:38.880 --> 2:03:43.200]  floods in mid part of our country that wiped out farms
[2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:47.920]  fires even now in california mudslides that swallowed up
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:52.480]  whole homes and people i get angry when i look at what public responsibility is
[2:03:52.480 --> 2:03:56.160]  supposed to be and i don't see people doing it
[2:03:56.160 --> 2:03:59.920]  there are mudslides and floods and fires therefore i must have more power
[2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:04.240]  and if you don't give it to me i will be angry and to prove that point john carrey
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:07.280]  will personally cause as many mudslides and floods
[2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:10.560]  and fires as it takes to wake you up to this problem
[2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:13.600]  that's the cross he's willing to bear any questions
[2:04:13.600 --> 2:04:17.360]  well at the time no one had any questions actually they never do no one
[2:04:17.360 --> 2:04:21.520]  in american media asks questions or thought that speech was weird in any
[2:04:21.520 --> 2:04:25.600]  way but back in 2019 one journalist in
[2:04:25.600 --> 2:04:29.520]  iceland not yet brainwashed did have a question he asked
[2:04:29.520 --> 2:04:32.800]  why did john carrey fly all the way to iceland
[2:04:32.800 --> 2:04:36.480]  on a private plane isn't that a little hypocritical
[2:04:36.480 --> 2:04:40.160]  now to our knowledge no one covered john carrey's response at the time it was
[2:04:40.160 --> 2:04:43.920]  completely buried we have it now you're gonna want to see it this is john carrey's
[2:04:43.920 --> 2:04:47.600]  response it's the only choice for somebody
[2:04:47.600 --> 2:04:51.280]  like me who is traveling the world to win this
[2:04:51.280 --> 2:04:55.840]  battle i believe the time it takes me to get somewhere i can't sail across the
[2:04:55.840 --> 2:05:00.560]  ocean i have to fly to meet with people and get things done
[2:05:00.560 --> 2:05:05.280]  it's the only choice for someone like me it's the only choice for someone like
[2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:07.840]  me what if a 12 000 square foot house on the
[2:05:07.840 --> 2:05:11.920]  water in nantucket it's the only choice for someone
[2:05:11.920 --> 2:05:14.960]  like me not a choice you're allowed to have
[2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:18.720]  none of the rules apply to the people in charge obviously the people in charge
[2:05:18.720 --> 2:05:21.760]  are important you are insignificant and that's why corporations
[2:05:21.760 --> 2:05:25.120]  amazon microsoft apple are seeing record profits right now
[2:05:25.120 --> 2:05:29.440]  even as your life falls apart even if if you run a small business
[2:05:29.440 --> 2:05:33.280]  you get arrested for trying to make a living
[2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:36.880]  this is just standard in the climate movement they don't have any problem with
[2:05:36.880 --> 2:05:39.280]  it at all john carrey's answer any of this behavior
[2:05:39.280 --> 2:05:42.080]  because for them it's not really about the environment
[2:05:42.080 --> 2:05:45.520]  none of these people none of these people the ones yelling about
[2:05:45.520 --> 2:05:50.480]  there's no planet b know anything about nature they don't go outside
[2:05:50.480 --> 2:05:53.840]  they couldn't name three bird species they don't know the insidious from a
[2:05:53.840 --> 2:05:57.120]  conifer they're completely cut off from nature they hate nature they're at war
[2:05:57.120 --> 2:06:01.120]  with it but there is one exception one
[2:06:01.120 --> 2:06:05.200]  principled voice in the environmental movement we reached out today to get her
[2:06:05.200 --> 2:06:09.360]  reaction to john carrey's speech in iceland and again no one has reported on this
[2:06:09.360 --> 2:06:13.520]  here exclusively if you can handle it is gretta
[2:06:13.520 --> 2:06:19.520]  thunberg's response to john carrey you all come to us young people
[2:06:19.520 --> 2:06:25.760]  for hope how dare you you have stolen my dreams
[2:06:25.760 --> 2:06:33.280]  and my childhood with your empty words yeah you go gretta thunberg
[2:06:33.280 --> 2:06:36.640]  you tell that john carrey he's wrecking your childhood
[2:06:36.640 --> 2:06:40.960]  all right i wanted to get magnus panvidia on last week again when i had him on
[2:06:40.960 --> 2:06:44.560]  and i wasn't keeping him on hold uh just for no reason but he was
[2:06:44.560 --> 2:06:47.600]  recommending an antifa member to get on so we were behind the scenes trying to
[2:06:47.600 --> 2:06:50.160]  work that out to make sure that can happen we're gonna come back from break
[2:06:50.160 --> 2:06:53.920]  talk to him for a segment and get her on with him then he can stay on i'll take
[2:06:53.920 --> 2:06:56.160]  a little bit time the next hour so he doesn't lose him because i want to have
[2:06:56.160 --> 2:07:00.640]  an in-depth discussion and then matt bracken is scheduled to take over but i
[2:07:00.640 --> 2:07:04.400]  wanted to say something here when i read 1984 and then it talked about
[2:07:04.400 --> 2:07:08.320]  immanuel goldstein and then i actually read the old soviet papers the bolshevik
[2:07:08.320 --> 2:07:12.080]  stuff carl marx you know engel dos kapital and all that
[2:07:12.080 --> 2:07:15.920]  they're always saying and i went back to malthus and the british philotis furs
[2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:21.040]  and i went back to playdough and i knew nichy said it in the last century
[2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:24.560]  that oh there's three types of people there's the proletariat that doesn't
[2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:27.920]  care and just wants to go around and you know work their jobs and have lottery
[2:07:27.920 --> 2:07:32.720]  tickets and get drunk and then there's uh the elites that are the aristocracy
[2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:34.960]  and there's those of us that want to be them
[2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:39.040]  uh that's no that's not true and every time i've run into globalists you know
[2:07:39.040 --> 2:07:41.520]  that's part of being a journalist it's off record but i mean some of this has
[2:07:41.520 --> 2:07:44.400]  come out in the news they're like you want 10 million
[2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:47.520]  you want a hundred million dollars i mean hell one of them did it in front of
[2:07:47.520 --> 2:07:50.320]  my crew so i can actually say it roth cop head of the kissinger group's like
[2:07:50.320 --> 2:07:53.120]  what do you want you'll get anything just come here i'm like dude you're in
[2:07:53.120 --> 2:07:57.600]  front of my crew saying this no i don't want to be an aristocrat in hollywood
[2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:02.800]  hills or in new york or at marlago i don't no no no no i don't
[2:08:02.800 --> 2:08:06.480]  i like my family and regular people some are rich some are poor some are black
[2:08:06.480 --> 2:08:08.880]  some are white i like interesting people i go eat
[2:08:08.880 --> 2:08:11.600]  restaurants where the food's good i listen to music i don't think about color
[2:08:11.600 --> 2:08:14.800]  they are i like a song i like it and so there's this thing in the
[2:08:14.800 --> 2:08:18.000]  establishment that they think there's us up here and then there's
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:22.560]  everyone that wants to be us no i don't want to be you
[2:08:22.560 --> 2:08:25.280]  and that's what this all comes down to it's like joy reed said last week she
[2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:28.400]  goes she goes all these white people want to
[2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:31.040]  be us and they're racist and they love hollywood
[2:08:31.040 --> 2:08:33.920]  and they like like like like like white people are robots like
[2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:37.040]  we want to be hollywood we don't like black people
[2:08:37.040 --> 2:08:43.680]  it is the most asinine ridiculous crap and anyone knows that
[2:08:43.680 --> 2:08:46.880]  you go to any country even homogenous countries like china
[2:08:46.880 --> 2:08:50.160]  they've got thousands of different factions and views you go to india
[2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:53.200]  one guy's got the same genetics one guy's the hindu ones a muzzle and they're
[2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:56.080]  killing each other this idea that i'm white
[2:08:56.080 --> 2:09:00.160]  and i have like certain like i am against black people i'm white
[2:09:00.160 --> 2:09:06.400]  is or i want to be an aristocrat is is insane
[2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:10.320]  it is insane i want a future i want freedom
[2:09:10.320 --> 2:09:14.240]  i want prosperity i want life extension i want health care
[2:09:14.240 --> 2:09:18.720]  i want to be free and i do not sit there
[2:09:18.720 --> 2:09:21.600]  like the there will be blood character who is like a lot of these elites who's

[2:11:56.320 --> 2:12:09.920]  Magnus Benvidia is here with us and star
[2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:15.920]  Shakti who's an antiva member he is a boogaloo boy and look you know I saw
[2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:20.160]  some stuff and comments online from Mike Dunn last week or others reporting to
[2:12:20.160 --> 2:12:23.920]  be him and like oh jones knows he got punked on the show that's why he's being
[2:12:23.920 --> 2:12:27.360]  nice now no I mean I did have a small backlash from listeners who are like
[2:12:27.360 --> 2:12:29.360]  hey we want a revolution yeah they're right let's
[2:12:29.360 --> 2:12:33.760]  start you know killing everybody I'm not saying Dunn was even saying that but I
[2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:37.040]  get america's piss right wing's piss left wing's piss everybody's pissed
[2:12:37.040 --> 2:12:42.240]  boogaloo's are pissed antiva's pissed uh I mean everybody's tired of everything
[2:12:42.240 --> 2:12:44.560]  I just want you know and even though it's shorter it's like during the break I
[2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:47.200]  should be nicer to him you know he's actually a nice guest or whatever and
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:50.080]  he said hey you ought to have this a Magnus Benvidia guy and he said this
[2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:54.560]  big viral interview with Jimmy Dore's being attacked for even interviewing him
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:57.760]  well why shouldn't you people interview Charlie Manson they interview me they
[2:12:57.760 --> 2:12:59.920]  can interview you know Adolf Hitler for time
[2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:03.200]  timeline books I mean you should talk to everybody shouldn't you no no no
[2:13:03.200 --> 2:13:06.640]  because they want to misrepresent who you are and so I had a small backlash
[2:13:06.640 --> 2:13:10.720]  most the audience you know is concerned about things it doesn't want violence
[2:13:10.720 --> 2:13:13.840]  but at a certain point everybody's got their right to their own declaration
[2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:18.960]  of independence doesn't mean it's gonna go like it did 450 years ago but
[2:13:18.960 --> 2:13:23.120]  still it's it's it really is in our system the right to revolt
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:26.240]  didn't give us that right just points out it's always inherently there I
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:30.640]  personally don't think that I could organize or run that properly
[2:13:30.640 --> 2:13:34.160]  other people seem to think they can or they just kind of want to be the person
[2:13:34.160 --> 2:13:38.400]  that likes the match maybe they're pyromaniacs but Magnus Benvidia is a
[2:13:38.400 --> 2:13:41.680]  very well-spoken person very popular guest when he came on so we're getting
[2:13:41.680 --> 2:13:44.960]  him back on and then he's introduced us to this anti-filady who's gonna be
[2:13:44.960 --> 2:13:48.880]  almost in the next segment as well sorry I got you a little bit late here
[2:13:48.880 --> 2:13:51.920]  it was kind of backed up today with a lot of stuff we didn't get to but we got
[2:13:51.920 --> 2:13:55.200]  about seven minutes of this segment long seven coming up a lot happening in the
[2:13:55.200 --> 2:13:59.040]  world what do you want to dig into first
[2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:04.080]  me on again Alex and uh yeah just kind of this whole crazy
[2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:08.000]  idea of unity that we've been pushing has sort of blown up over the last week
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:12.320]  uh you know getting getting you know BLM 757 on your show on a
[2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:15.920]  orange oren toyer's war room that was huge I don't know if you've ever had a
[2:14:15.920 --> 2:14:21.200]  BLM activist on before yeah so just having people talking to
[2:14:21.200 --> 2:14:24.400]  each other and more and more groups kind of reaching out
[2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:28.640]  and then the establishment has kind of picked up wind of this and a lot of
[2:14:28.640 --> 2:14:32.400]  progressive and liberal youtube channels that have been talking about hey
[2:14:32.400 --> 2:14:35.520]  maybe unity hey maybe we should work together with x trump supporters
[2:14:35.520 --> 2:14:39.040]  they've started to get demonetized or have their facebook pages talked out
[2:14:39.040 --> 2:14:42.640]  will take it down which is like oh that's really convenient that you know like
[2:14:42.640 --> 2:14:45.600]  they're saying the same thing they've been saying all last year but the moment
[2:14:45.600 --> 2:14:48.240]  they started to be like hey maybe we should work with trump supporters maybe
[2:14:48.240 --> 2:14:52.080]  we should reach out to the right they get their you know you because they want
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:55.520]  because they want a civil war you guys want revolution and a change
[2:14:55.520 --> 2:14:58.560]  you don't want a civil war right yeah and that's that's what they want and
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:01.200]  that's what I've been saying from the very beginning is that the
[2:15:01.200 --> 2:15:03.920]  establishment and the elites are the people that want to keep everyone
[2:15:03.920 --> 2:15:07.520]  divided and they want everyone to kill each other they want you know the more
[2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:12.160]  civil conflict the more closer we get to like a serious style situation the
[2:15:12.160 --> 2:15:16.240]  easier it is for them to consolidate power easier it is for them to pass a
[2:15:16.240 --> 2:15:19.280]  second patriot act or something like that
[2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:22.160]  well that's a great point when i was talking to mike done when we were set
[2:15:22.160 --> 2:15:26.000]  off the show or the producer was he's like listen we don't want
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:30.640]  rebel we don't want anarchy we don't want civil war we want a revolution
[2:15:30.640 --> 2:15:34.560]  and that's two different things it seems like the cia the globalists they're
[2:15:34.560 --> 2:15:38.960]  phrasing this as a civil war no no it's not us killing each other we want a
[2:15:38.960 --> 2:15:43.120]  revolution yeah the the the opponent everyone we've
[2:15:43.120 --> 2:15:45.200]  always talked about is the federal government
[2:15:45.200 --> 2:15:48.560]  there's never a meme made or a post made about
[2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:52.960]  going out and fighting democrats or going out and attacking Trump supporters
[2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:56.240]  none of our information none of our messaging has ever been about that
[2:15:56.240 --> 2:15:59.360]  everything we've always talked about is the government and particularly the
[2:15:59.360 --> 2:16:01.760]  federal government that's always been the opponent
[2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:05.600]  so it's it's never been a civil war and we've already most of us have stated
[2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:08.960]  that if there was some republican versus democrat
[2:16:08.960 --> 2:16:13.040]  kind of civil warfare most of us wouldn't participate we would go out into our
[2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:17.360]  cabins and into the woods and you know just try to stay out of it
[2:16:17.360 --> 2:16:21.040]  because you know nothing good would ever come out of that that is exactly i've
[2:16:21.040 --> 2:16:23.200]  never had to actually set up a cabin in the woods
[2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:27.440]  i've actually got one now because i don't intend to take part in in the civil war
[2:16:27.440 --> 2:16:31.040]  yeah so if you know that's the funniest thing is you know you'll have these
[2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:33.840]  people that are like oh you you're warning that the elites are trying to
[2:16:33.840 --> 2:16:37.120]  push a civil war that's so crazy that'll never happen but then those
[2:16:37.120 --> 2:16:40.480]  same people will turn around and be like can't talk to the other side they need
[2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:43.360]  to be deleted off of everything they need to be kicked out of the government
[2:16:43.360 --> 2:16:46.320]  and it's like which one of us sounds like they're pushing for a notice that's
[2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:49.760]  what all that does is put people in groups they force you into groups they
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:53.600]  can control you yeah i actually i hope what you're saying is revolutionary
[2:16:53.600 --> 2:16:56.720]  you're right whether our ideas are different or not we should talk to each
[2:16:56.720 --> 2:17:00.720]  other that's simple that simple detente simple diplomacy
[2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:04.320]  absolutely and i put on twitter today that a michigan-based
[2:17:04.320 --> 2:17:09.680]  anti-fascist account got restricted today for posting that they wanted to
[2:17:09.680 --> 2:17:13.280]  reach out to x trump supporters that account is several years old
[2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:17.280]  it nothing in the tweet was violent or calling for violence there was nothing
[2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:20.880]  about it but just including hey maybe we should start talking to x
[2:17:20.880 --> 2:17:24.160]  trump supporters facebook flagged the post and took it down
[2:17:24.160 --> 2:17:27.360]  so it's like you're exactly right to where the moment anyone starts stepping
[2:17:27.360 --> 2:17:30.720]  outside of these bubbles they're attacked they're targeted you're the one that pointed
[2:17:30.720 --> 2:17:34.160]  this out and oh and shroyer and others was like hey i was like hey be nice
[2:17:34.160 --> 2:17:36.400]  even if you disagree with some of the stuff we need to talk to each other they
[2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:39.280]  don't want this that's that i'm not the one that picked up on this trend i think
[2:17:39.280 --> 2:17:42.160]  you did i think you're the one i think you were jimmy door this just started a
[2:17:42.160 --> 2:17:44.720]  few weeks ago but this is big now like you said
[2:17:44.720 --> 2:17:48.160]  yeah it's picking up steam and particularly like people are starting to
[2:17:48.160 --> 2:17:52.480]  look into things and starting to question whether you know they had false
[2:17:52.480 --> 2:17:55.440]  beliefs on all of these different movements or even if they didn't have
[2:17:55.440 --> 2:17:59.600]  false beliefs that their feelings on them were exaggerated or focused by the
[2:17:59.600 --> 2:18:03.360]  media to an extreme to get them to the point where they dehumanize half the
[2:18:03.360 --> 2:18:06.080]  population and that happens on both sides you have
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:09.760]  yeah it's total radicalization it's total radicalization
[2:18:09.760 --> 2:18:13.360]  absolutely you have you have people that literally view like everyone in the
[2:18:13.360 --> 2:18:17.280]  opposing party as like some evil destructive force that has to be
[2:18:17.280 --> 2:18:20.400]  physically removed and the fact that people you know people don't get to
[2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:23.840]  that naturally you don't hate your neighbor like that as just a regular
[2:18:23.840 --> 2:18:26.000]  human being it's totally manufactured is
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:30.400]  totally pushed by the media to get people to that point
[2:18:30.400 --> 2:18:33.520]  what do you think's going to happen to biden post trump they don't have trump
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:37.680]  to blame anymore and now he's launching all these wars and all this i mean this
[2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:41.280]  is crazy i think a lot of the left is like uh
[2:18:41.280 --> 2:18:44.080]  because this happened under obama too if people for you know a lot of people
[2:18:44.080 --> 2:18:47.920]  forget that once bush was out obama started doing
[2:18:47.920 --> 2:18:51.760]  all the same things bush was doing but a lot of the left kind of just were
[2:18:51.760 --> 2:18:55.600]  never told about it or kind of you know sat back and gave up on activism
[2:18:55.600 --> 2:18:58.640]  because like obama's in charge now everything's going to be fixed
[2:18:58.640 --> 2:19:01.200]  what i've seen but what i've seen across the internet and all these
[2:19:01.200 --> 2:19:03.840]  movements is people are very aware that biden is
[2:19:03.840 --> 2:19:07.360]  broken every single one of his promises that he's very much a warmonger
[2:19:07.360 --> 2:19:11.120]  and then you a lot of people even are very aware of kind of the patriarch
[2:19:11.120 --> 2:19:14.240]  patriot act two thing that's building right now to where i have
[2:19:14.240 --> 2:19:17.840]  progressives on twitter like open bernie sanders supporters
[2:19:17.840 --> 2:19:21.120]  posting that they're trying to start a civil war that they're going after
[2:19:21.120 --> 2:19:24.640]  americans that they're going to expand the security state and start running
[2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:27.120]  around with fbi agents and arresting people and these
[2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:29.760]  these aren't info wars people these aren't trump supporters these are
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:33.120]  bernie sanders supporters these are tulsi gabbard supporters so even they're
[2:19:33.120 --> 2:19:36.160]  kind of like more aware of what's happening
[2:19:36.160 --> 2:19:39.040]  you know i'm glad you raised that because the first article i wanted to hit
[2:19:39.040 --> 2:19:41.280]  and of course i got distracted and didn't get to it
[2:19:41.280 --> 2:19:46.640]  is ci counterterrorism chief says there's going to be a new civil war
[2:19:46.640 --> 2:19:50.960]  they want a new reconstruction and that quote our own country men are the
[2:19:50.960 --> 2:19:54.400]  enemy i'm going to show you this we come back there's video of it too
[2:19:54.400 --> 2:19:58.400]  and this is even got the squad upset it's got rand paul upset because
[2:19:58.400 --> 2:20:01.440]  it's not it's scaring us like oh the cia is going to get us
[2:20:01.440 --> 2:20:04.640]  couldn't beat the north vietnamese couldn't beat the
[2:20:04.640 --> 2:20:11.360]  the afghans but it's so illegal yeah and it's it's it's horrifying that you
[2:20:11.360 --> 2:20:15.440]  have unelected representatives that that can literally get on cnn and
[2:20:15.440 --> 2:20:19.360]  like say that they want to go after americans who haven't committed any crime
[2:20:19.360 --> 2:20:23.120]  they've blown up the idea of what represents a domestic terrorist to
[2:20:23.120 --> 2:20:25.680]  such an extreme that a person like me that doesn't
[2:20:25.680 --> 2:20:27.840]  even have a criminal record and have never you know
[2:20:27.840 --> 2:20:32.240]  hurt anyone in violence in my life is now considered by john brennan as some
[2:20:32.240 --> 2:20:35.600]  as equivalent to someone like isis which is insane
[2:20:35.600 --> 2:20:39.920]  this is a total nightmare i mean it's so unreal even alex jones can't believe it
[2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:41.840]  i mean we're we're in uncharted territory
[2:20:41.840 --> 2:20:45.360]  well they're right back stay with us all of the experts agree that getting
[2:20:45.360 --> 2:20:48.960]  proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health it has been proven that a
[2:20:48.960 --> 2:20:52.720]  poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems including
[2:20:52.720 --> 2:20:55.440]  weight gain memory issues mood changes

[2:22:10.400 --> 2:22:13.440]  they're at bandot video they're not allowed to be
[2:22:13.440 --> 2:22:18.000]  on twitter on youtube on facebook that's why it's so precious because the
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:21.600]  censorship expands to everyone which it is now

[2:23:44.880 --> 2:23:59.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:59.200 --> 2:24:03.360]  magnus panvidia is our guest from the boogaloo boys
[2:24:03.360 --> 2:24:08.880]  with star shakti a member of anti and you know i've seen some criticism
[2:24:08.880 --> 2:24:12.000]  actually i'll ensure you're having these guys on or have other people on
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:16.560]  i've gotten some and listen i'm all about debating people discussing
[2:24:16.560 --> 2:24:19.600]  i think that's a good thing anybody that says you shouldn't do that
[2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:23.120]  is that a serious screw loose but notice it's the left mainly
[2:24:23.120 --> 2:24:26.880]  saying oh you shouldn't give somebody a platform jimmy door because by the way
[2:24:26.880 --> 2:24:30.240]  i don't follow jimmy door i think he's funny he spit you know
[2:24:30.240 --> 2:24:34.960]  xtm on face one time after the young turks invited us up then set us up
[2:24:34.960 --> 2:24:38.640]  i don't think door was in on it i'd love to go on door show it's entertaining
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:42.320]  when i see it but he without even looking is my point
[2:24:42.320 --> 2:24:45.760]  i'm not saying i don't watch a show i watch it sometimes without following him
[2:24:45.760 --> 2:24:50.480]  i see it all over the news the last week and have how dare jimmy door cancel him
[2:24:50.480 --> 2:24:54.880]  take him down he had magnus panvidia on so i finally went a few days ago and
[2:24:54.880 --> 2:24:58.080]  watched the interview it was a very nice come together interview
[2:24:58.080 --> 2:25:02.400]  which again you can have antifa you can have white supremacist online saying
[2:25:02.400 --> 2:25:06.000]  kill the other group they're allowed to so it really does show the system
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:09.440]  wants this collision the civil war
[2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:13.360]  totally and you know people wanting to keep people in echo chambers because if
[2:25:13.360 --> 2:25:17.120]  you actually talk to the average american if you just go to your gas station
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:21.680]  and just speak to somebody we have all way more in common than we realize in
[2:25:21.680 --> 2:25:25.600]  the whole point of social media and it's particularly over the lockdowns because
[2:25:25.600 --> 2:25:30.080]  people aren't interacting in person you it dehumanizes people it's really easy
[2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:34.800]  to look at your neighbor as the enemy and the government as the savior when it's
[2:25:34.800 --> 2:25:37.440]  the exact opposite i don't mean to interrupt but i've been through that
[2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:40.160]  because i've said some things that are wrong out of context i apologize
[2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:42.480]  they distill it and twist it and amplify it
[2:25:42.480 --> 2:25:46.160]  where this thing they make you is not who you are at all
[2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:49.600]  yeah they've already did that to me because they've gone back
[2:25:49.600 --> 2:25:53.280]  and doxed me and tried to go through my old facebook post
[2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:56.880]  where i said where i you know i was very suspicious of antifa i didn't like
[2:25:56.880 --> 2:26:00.960]  antifa and then i actually ended up talking to people from antifa on the
[2:26:00.960 --> 2:26:04.720]  ground and as my opinion started changing so they went all the way back to
[2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:08.480]  june and they're like see he posts something bad about antifa that and
[2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:12.080]  there's impossible for his opinion to change cancel him to where now like
[2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:15.440]  some of my best friends are in this movement and we've humanized each other
[2:26:15.440 --> 2:26:19.280]  by just talking by realizing despite our differences we are people
[2:26:19.280 --> 2:26:22.080]  and that we have things in common and a lot of the things that we're concerned
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:24.880]  about they are equally as concerned well sure i mean look look here's the deal
[2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:28.400]  obviously a lot of grassroots antifa are going to mean well i've set out one of
[2:26:28.400 --> 2:26:31.600]  them on the show that's why i appreciate this lady on it's very diverse i'm
[2:26:31.600 --> 2:26:35.920]  talking about the funding on top or the image the media puts out that's one thing
[2:26:35.920 --> 2:26:40.960]  versus what a real boogaloo is versus what a you know real antifa person is
[2:26:40.960 --> 2:26:44.080]  and i'm not defending white supremacist because i've actually been around some of
[2:26:44.080 --> 2:26:47.440]  them uh the average one though thinks they're a victim and
[2:26:47.440 --> 2:26:50.560]  thinks everybody's out to get them and actually is not what the media even
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:53.600]  says i'm not defending them but they i've talked to them they actually believe
[2:26:53.600 --> 2:26:56.720]  something totally different as well so it seems like what we're hearing about
[2:26:56.720 --> 2:27:00.640]  each group is not actually what's going on no yeah because they they
[2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:04.560]  intentionally want everyone to look scarier and more dangerous and more evil
[2:27:04.560 --> 2:27:07.920]  than they actually are they don't they don't want you know
[2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:11.200]  like because before if you go back it's very much kind of like to kill a
[2:27:11.200 --> 2:27:13.440]  mockingbird bird and you know the whole thing with boo
[2:27:13.440 --> 2:27:17.200]  radley of they just want to take someone who might be a little weird or might be
[2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:20.480]  wrong and they want to make them look like a demon they
[2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:23.440]  wanted to make them look like a devil no i agree so what's the answer to ending
[2:27:23.440 --> 2:27:28.160]  what we wouldn't if we get boogaloo's militias the kkk and black lives matter
[2:27:28.160 --> 2:27:32.480]  all at a barbecue and i would guess at the end of it most people will be friends
[2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:35.600]  you have a still people trying to start a fight or maybe provocateurs but if you
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:40.080]  actually got everybody together the most people would stop it
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:43.520]  yeah that's the whole thing daryl davis did and daryl davis you know almost
[2:27:43.520 --> 2:27:48.000]  single-handedly destroyed entire you know kkk groups by being a black man and
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:52.080]  just going and talking to them and then humanizing himself and humanizing
[2:27:52.080 --> 2:27:55.680]  them and then those people were like you know what i can't be in the clan
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:27:58.960]  anymore because one of my best friends is a black man and i love daryl davis
[2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:02.800]  so you know that was his approach and he's one of my mentors like he's a hero
[2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:06.640]  to me daryl davis so it's exactly like you said of like when you get people
[2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:09.680]  from different groups to just sit down and actually talk to each other as
[2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:13.120]  people a lot of the bigotry a lot of the hatred a
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:15.920]  lot of you know whether it be racism whether it be
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:20.160]  homophobia whether you know and any kind of negative view of the other
[2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:23.040]  starts to melt away when you actually just talk to be sure and i want to give
[2:28:23.040 --> 2:28:25.520]  this handy for lady i don't want to make her sit there on hold when we can go a
[2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:28.000]  little bit the next hour i appreciate your time but let me just say this first
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:31.440]  but you get the left and the big cia foundations
[2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:34.560]  create a false left false liberal thing where
[2:28:34.560 --> 2:28:38.480]  oh bernie sanders mittens are racist and acronyms are racist and
[2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:42.480]  white people are inherently bad so a lot of white folks that weren't racist
[2:28:42.480 --> 2:28:46.000]  are getting pissed because they're being told they're bad because they're white
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:50.880]  so i mean you i mean that's really the system trying to create a racial division
[2:28:50.880 --> 2:28:54.320]  yeah absolutely and and a lot of especially lately a lot of you know
[2:28:54.320 --> 2:28:58.560]  left-wing people that have spoken up against that get turned on way harder
[2:28:58.560 --> 2:29:02.000]  than you know maybe even you have i've been watching on twitter because now
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:04.960]  that i've been embraced by a lot of progressives and stuff and i watched
[2:29:04.960 --> 2:29:09.040]  them get tore apart for even trying to humanize the other side i watched them
[2:29:09.040 --> 2:29:13.520]  get put on lists and called nazis for even speaking to someone like me
[2:29:13.520 --> 2:29:17.920]  which is you know surreal or or and i've even seen daryl davis be called like
[2:29:17.920 --> 2:29:21.840]  race trader and stuff like that for talking to the clan when he has
[2:29:21.840 --> 2:29:25.760]  done more to get ready has incredible courage to go into a group of a hundred
[2:29:25.760 --> 2:29:29.840]  clansmen i mean yeah and he and he's he's had dozens and
[2:29:29.840 --> 2:29:33.600]  dozens of them give up their robes he has an entire wardrobe full of x clan
[2:29:33.600 --> 2:29:37.200]  members that have quit the kkk just because he went and talked to them and
[2:29:37.200 --> 2:29:40.880]  he went to them and de-radicalized them by just that's the issue though man you
[2:29:40.880 --> 2:29:45.440]  try to get into a a conservative event that they get hoards of people calling
[2:29:45.440 --> 2:29:48.720]  themselves antifa that beat peeps peaceful people and against free speech
[2:29:48.720 --> 2:29:52.800]  you got antifa attacking andy to go so let's bring in star
[2:29:52.800 --> 2:30:01.440]  and she's at star shakti one or at united voluntary on twitter star thanks for
[2:30:01.440 --> 2:30:05.120]  joining us we've got about 15 minutes the next hour i appreciate you holding
[2:30:05.120 --> 2:30:08.720]  what do you want to say i can ask a lot of questions but you're antifa i guess
[2:30:08.720 --> 2:30:12.800]  uh in involved in activism of seattle and portland for now
[2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:18.480]  21 22 years this is the wto protest what do you want to say about
[2:30:18.480 --> 2:30:21.840]  i guess what you're calling is the real antifa or what's your what's your
[2:30:21.840 --> 2:30:25.760]  message um i think that it's really time that we
[2:30:25.760 --> 2:30:28.880]  start treating our other americans citizens as humans
[2:30:28.880 --> 2:30:32.640]  um and really start having the hard conversation
[2:30:32.640 --> 2:30:36.960]  because we are all souls we're humans we're trapped in this meat suit and we
[2:30:36.960 --> 2:30:39.760]  have to get along and live together and i think that it's time that we like
[2:30:39.760 --> 2:30:42.880]  start having the conversations about how we do that
[2:30:42.880 --> 2:30:45.920]  the whole corporate takeover is not good for anyone
[2:30:45.920 --> 2:30:50.240]  it doesn't allow people to serve their own self-interest and it doesn't
[2:30:50.240 --> 2:30:53.520]  take care of others and i think that it's time that we like start to figure
[2:30:53.520 --> 2:30:57.280]  out is people how we're going to unite to resolve this
[2:30:57.280 --> 2:31:00.800]  and we have to live on the same planet together so let's figure out how to get
[2:31:00.800 --> 2:31:04.160]  along well i mean it's great to have
[2:31:04.160 --> 2:31:07.040]  somebody that says they've been with the antifa and i believe you people say
[2:31:07.040 --> 2:31:11.280]  you're bona fide what was the antifa back at the WTO
[2:31:11.280 --> 2:31:15.280]  21 years ago in seattle versus what it is now
[2:31:15.280 --> 2:31:19.440]  strangely it's kind of changed um so a lot of us
[2:31:19.440 --> 2:31:24.320]  would never claim the term um on tifa you know we're involved in our pods or
[2:31:24.320 --> 2:31:27.760]  our groups or you know doing the things that we're passionate about
[2:31:27.760 --> 2:31:31.360]  and then we kind of all get lumped together and in the reality well yeah
[2:31:31.360 --> 2:31:35.120]  in the broad sense we're all anti-fascists um knowing
[2:31:35.120 --> 2:31:38.960]  at the definition turbo what fascism is and we're against those things you know
[2:31:38.960 --> 2:31:43.600]  pretty much um so one of the ways i see it is that
[2:31:43.600 --> 2:31:47.680]  we're kind of what would you call it militant
[2:31:47.680 --> 2:31:51.440]  compassion we tend to see things that are you know not being taken care of or
[2:31:51.440 --> 2:31:54.880]  not being addressed to the world or people that are being oppressed and
[2:31:54.880 --> 2:31:58.560]  exploited and we tend to speak out about it and that and speak out about it
[2:31:58.560 --> 2:32:01.840]  through direct action because direct action is the thing
[2:32:01.840 --> 2:32:07.120]  historically that tends to work well you can say violence has solved a lot of
[2:32:07.120 --> 2:32:09.680]  things it's also kicked off civil wars but i mean
[2:32:09.680 --> 2:32:12.720]  you don't endorse the stuff we've seen where antifa tries to shut down other
[2:32:12.720 --> 2:32:15.920]  people's free speech events because i don't care if it's a kkk or black lives
[2:32:15.920 --> 2:32:18.320]  matter antifa i believe everybody has arrived at free
[2:32:18.320 --> 2:32:23.200]  speech as long as it's not violent so that's complicated because i think that
[2:32:23.200 --> 2:32:26.960]  we also have freedom to counter speech we're having a war of signs where i
[2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:29.920]  live and you know there's been a more conservative sign
[2:32:29.920 --> 2:32:33.200]  it forever but then they fight us having our liberal sign up
[2:32:33.200 --> 2:32:36.640]  oh listen i agree with you coming out counter protesting
[2:32:36.640 --> 2:32:40.240]  i just think you don't hit somebody in the baseball bat
[2:32:40.240 --> 2:32:44.160]  no i think that that's violence on other human being is not ever
[2:32:44.160 --> 2:32:47.440]  condoned well stay there because you just hit something key
[2:32:47.440 --> 2:32:52.320]  the left always thinks that protesting somebody or disagreeing with them is a

[2:34:51.280 --> 2:34:56.720]  actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason
[2:34:56.720 --> 2:35:00.640]  it's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them
[2:35:00.640 --> 2:35:04.080]  that's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is
[2:35:04.080 --> 2:35:07.920]  do you see the headlines from CNN ABC News doctors say it's worse than they
[2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:11.520]  ever thought COVID more devastating they could ever imagine
[2:35:11.520 --> 2:35:15.280]  they told us that two and a half million people would be dead
[2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:18.640]  just eight months ago within three months okay
[2:35:18.640 --> 2:35:22.560]  it's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other
[2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:25.600]  things we're talking 96 percent had co-morbidity
[2:35:25.600 --> 2:35:29.280]  these are real numbers these are real facts this is the chicken little event

[2:35:43.520 --> 2:35:49.440]  president trump won in a landslide on November 3rd but the globalists weren't
[2:35:49.440 --> 2:35:54.080]  going to let that happen they had to have some way to repudiate the populist
[2:35:54.080 --> 2:35:58.000]  movement emanating from the united states that spread across
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:02.800]  the world from the uk to brazil they were desperate they admitted their own
[2:36:02.800 --> 2:36:05.520]  publications they didn't know what to do
[2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:10.000]  and so they put out 80 million fake ballots violated state law
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:13.760]  and stole it better than death and now they're coming after the president
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:17.040]  they're coming after you they're coming after me they're shutting everybody

[2:38:05.840 --> 2:38:10.400]  commentary with these two folks with us i could play these clips already played
[2:38:10.400 --> 2:38:13.600]  it when he said it two weeks ago he said it again yesterday
[2:38:13.600 --> 2:38:18.160]  here it is cia counterterrorism chief says going to war against domestic
[2:38:18.160 --> 2:38:22.400]  insurgents is the next mission uh he says he's worried about a violent wave of
[2:38:22.400 --> 2:38:26.960]  our own countrymen talks about a new reconstruction
[2:38:26.960 --> 2:38:30.800]  that of course is robert grenier and it's not just him
[2:38:30.800 --> 2:38:34.480]  they have white house press briefing so if i saw trump
[2:38:34.480 --> 2:38:37.280]  because i didn't agree with the q thing about let's arrest everybody let's
[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:40.640]  execute them i was like that sounds like bs it's a setup that's the
[2:38:40.640 --> 2:38:44.240]  globalist discrediting us and it was i mean if i saw
[2:38:44.240 --> 2:38:50.160]  trump or anybody or bush or clinton or obama get up and say this i would be
[2:38:50.160 --> 2:38:54.240]  going crazy but now it's so surreal because it's happening
[2:38:54.240 --> 2:38:57.920]  and now they want more troops in dc and they're saying oh we're going to get the
[2:38:57.920 --> 2:39:00.960]  anti-fatue and we're going to get the commies and we're going to get the
[2:39:00.960 --> 2:39:03.360]  black lives matter and we're going to get the militias and
[2:39:03.360 --> 2:39:07.040]  we're going to get the kkk but they can label anybody they want
[2:39:07.040 --> 2:39:12.240]  anytime so you raise this magnus panvidia uh right at the start again
[2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:15.680]  boogaloo a prominent spokesperson there's no central group you're
[2:39:15.680 --> 2:39:20.000]  you know up there the you know the top guys uh and then of course uh we've got
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:23.680]  star here who's an anti-fatue member for for 21 years
[2:39:23.680 --> 2:39:27.680]  she can comment but to me i'm not worried about boogaloo's i'm not worried
[2:39:27.680 --> 2:39:30.720]  about white supremacist oh jones didn't worry about white supremacist
[2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:33.520]  no i don't agree with him i'm saying i'm not worried about it i'm not worried
[2:39:33.520 --> 2:39:36.640]  about black lives matter i'm not worried about even the communist party
[2:39:36.640 --> 2:39:41.680]  or or i'm worried i'm worried not about even islamic terror
[2:39:41.680 --> 2:39:45.840]  compared to this i'm worried about the big state the central government the cia
[2:39:45.840 --> 2:39:48.720]  the pentagon that they're in press briefing saying
[2:39:48.720 --> 2:39:51.840]  is coming after everybody that doesn't tell the line
[2:39:51.840 --> 2:39:56.160]  this is ominous this is a revolution of the establishment what's your view do
[2:39:56.160 --> 2:39:59.680]  you agree why do you think you're doing it
[2:39:59.680 --> 2:40:02.800]  are you asking me and whoever wants to jump in star
[2:40:02.800 --> 2:40:09.200]  okay for me my fight is against really the corporate global takeover
[2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:13.120]  it's not good for indigenous countries it's not good for our country it's not
[2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:16.560]  good for the worker it's not good for anyone on
[2:40:16.560 --> 2:40:20.480]  minimum wage it's not good for anyone who lives on the planet
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:25.120]  it's only good for the profits of this massive entity that's taking over and
[2:40:25.120 --> 2:40:28.720]  getting its fingers in every government globally
[2:40:28.720 --> 2:40:32.560]  sure but i mean what do you make of this i mean if you told people 20 years ago
[2:40:32.560 --> 2:40:36.240]  a year ago the cia is gonna announce war with america
[2:40:36.240 --> 2:40:40.640]  it's totally illegal in the constitution i mean it's just insane
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:44.400]  oh i totally feel like this is part of that takeover that you know puts in the
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:47.280]  interest of the corporations is us being good little batteries and fighting
[2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:49.920]  each other if we organize and actually start to
[2:40:49.920 --> 2:40:54.320]  take a stand against you know the takeover of the planet then
[2:40:54.320 --> 2:40:57.920]  we're a threat but as long as they have us distracted fighting each other
[2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:01.920]  then we're distracted they want the people to either be distracted
[2:41:01.920 --> 2:41:06.560]  or sedated or just compliant no i agree with that i'm asking you the overall
[2:41:06.560 --> 2:41:11.120]  what do you make of the making this move i mean this is a this is a big deal
[2:41:11.120 --> 2:41:14.720]  this is a like it reminds me a lot it reminds me a lot
[2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:17.840]  like as far as the things that are going on with cia and this whole life what's
[2:41:17.840 --> 2:41:21.520]  feeling like a patriot act too and the restriction of free speech
[2:41:21.520 --> 2:41:24.880]  it reminds me a lot of what happens see after the wto protest which was in
[2:41:24.880 --> 2:41:27.840]  november and just at the beginning of december 99
[2:41:27.840 --> 2:41:32.320]  um what happened is we were we thought this would be our life right we were
[2:41:32.320 --> 2:41:34.400]  going to show up and we were going to make a difference and we were going to
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:38.960]  speak out and then 9-11 happened just the nine
[2:41:38.960 --> 2:41:43.920]  months later 10 months later um and then we had the patriot act in
[2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:48.080]  homeland security and we found that communicating was nearly impossible
[2:41:48.080 --> 2:41:51.600]  we couldn't organize again like we did at wto i mean the
[2:41:51.600 --> 2:41:54.640]  straights was the fact that we organized
[2:41:54.640 --> 2:41:59.120]  like i think there was closer to 250 000 people there than what they report
[2:41:59.120 --> 2:42:02.720]  i know that we filled up the city and it was a massive organization of lots of
[2:42:02.720 --> 2:42:06.160]  people with different interests and different objectives saying that these
[2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:09.840]  corporations and this support of governments of these
[2:42:09.840 --> 2:42:13.760]  corporations and the intertangling of it and the revolving door is not good
[2:42:13.760 --> 2:42:16.720]  for anybody i'm glad you raised that and i wish we
[2:42:16.720 --> 2:42:20.320]  could see your face because i know it's not for covid but for your own identity
[2:42:20.320 --> 2:42:23.840]  you're you're covering your face it muffles you it it muffles you a bit star
[2:42:23.840 --> 2:42:28.560]  but we sent reporters there we covered i made a film police state to the takeover
[2:42:28.560 --> 2:42:31.680]  where the antifa people claiming they were antifa
[2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:35.120]  were actually under bill clinton's delta force command
[2:42:35.120 --> 2:42:39.120]  they staged attacks so that massive attacks could then happen
[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:42.240]  against the peaceful protesters and route them into the neighborhoods
[2:42:42.240 --> 2:42:48.080]  and remember the city even housed uh the antifa in and a building they kicked
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:52.000]  the tenants out and move antifa in so again i'm not saying you're a federal
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:55.040]  operative uh but here's the actual footage from police state
[2:42:55.040 --> 2:42:59.200]  to the takeover from local news but i have personally
[2:42:59.200 --> 2:43:04.480]  witnessed the president's own military his umperturian guard do this
[2:43:04.480 --> 2:43:08.960]  yeah that's actually that documentary yeah that documentary is where i
[2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:12.480]  actually found you from way long ago when i was a very young man ironically
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:15.280]  enough so that's kind of you know what i brought that on
[2:43:15.280 --> 2:43:19.760]  and definitely to your point about like the cia building up and everything
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:23.120]  a lot of the things that went on under trump with antifa
[2:43:23.120 --> 2:43:26.800]  have been building up to now go after militias and then they're including
[2:43:26.800 --> 2:43:29.840]  antifa in that and that's another thing that's waking a lot of liberals up is
[2:43:29.840 --> 2:43:32.960]  everybody thinks that all this new patriot act too stuff is just going
[2:43:32.960 --> 2:43:36.160]  after proud boys and everything to where if you actually read the documents
[2:43:36.160 --> 2:43:38.400]  they include black lives matter groups they
[2:43:38.400 --> 2:43:43.040]  include actual local antifascist groups and just like you know like you said
[2:43:43.040 --> 2:43:47.120]  with with instances when there is attacks by people wearing all black
[2:43:47.120 --> 2:43:51.440]  and calling themselves antifa we don't know if they're actual local
[2:43:51.440 --> 2:43:55.440]  activists or if they're cops pretending to be antifascist activists
[2:43:55.440 --> 2:43:58.400]  and star can even speak about it to where you know their local groups
[2:43:58.400 --> 2:44:02.480]  constantly have to protect themselves against cops and other people
[2:44:02.480 --> 2:44:06.800]  trying to pretend to be antifascist activists to start violence at protests
[2:44:06.800 --> 2:44:10.240]  and even within their own organizations they try to stop those people and fight
[2:44:10.240 --> 2:44:13.440]  those people but it's so decentralized that it's hard to do
[2:44:13.440 --> 2:44:18.080]  sure exactly that's what i'm getting at is that was a totally legitimate
[2:44:18.080 --> 2:44:22.400]  liberal protest that i would agree with don't give the wto power over our trade
[2:44:22.400 --> 2:44:25.120]  don't let them sign with china exploit all these people
[2:44:25.120 --> 2:44:29.120]  those were good old-fashioned liberals i liked they got set up they got attacked
[2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:31.920]  because i don't believe in the army
[2:44:31.920 --> 2:44:38.640]  obama ordered clinton ordered the military to go set that up and demon
[2:44:38.640 --> 2:44:42.000]  and they ran it up successfully against america
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:49.200]  and so this is what i'm saying is we now just see this accelerating
[2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:54.240]  absolutely and definitely like you're you know you're seeing more and more
[2:44:54.240 --> 2:44:58.080]  the government try to infiltrate all of these groups and and looking for a
[2:44:58.080 --> 2:45:02.400]  patsy they want a patsy really bad they want somebody to fly off the handle
[2:45:02.400 --> 2:45:06.640]  and shoot somebody or commit a terrorist attack and we've we've seen over many
[2:45:06.640 --> 2:45:09.440]  years that they will make that patsy if they have to
[2:45:09.440 --> 2:45:13.920]  the fbi will create their own terror plot to stop that terror plot to justify
[2:45:13.920 --> 2:45:17.680]  expanding the police thing i agree with you that's
[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:20.960]  historic so what do we do to stop that because i don't want a civil war
[2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:24.240]  i know you might want a revolution i get your point well we're all acceleration
[2:45:24.240 --> 2:45:27.600]  as you know thomas jepperson i mean we want to get this change but i just
[2:45:27.600 --> 2:45:31.760]  don't see well both of you how do you see fixing this
[2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:34.880]  star can jump in a magnet i mean how do we fix this
[2:45:34.880 --> 2:45:38.080]  is the only way violence in your views or well what is revolution how do you
[2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:42.880]  define that okay so um like the very first step
[2:45:42.880 --> 2:45:46.640]  is doing exactly what we're doing now because on your original show i discussed
[2:45:46.640 --> 2:45:50.640]  that like me and star talking together and me and you know local
[2:45:50.640 --> 2:45:54.800]  anti-fascist organizations talking together literally started with trying
[2:45:54.800 --> 2:45:58.240]  to identify foreign actors attempting to pretend to
[2:45:58.240 --> 2:46:01.600]  be us to attack each other and just just taking that step of
[2:46:01.600 --> 2:46:05.280]  acknowledging the government's going to try to destroy us no matter what we do
[2:46:05.280 --> 2:46:09.520]  and working together to at least prevent that has brought unity between these
[2:46:09.520 --> 2:46:14.240]  groups and then from there just kind of having like a working class
[2:46:14.240 --> 2:46:18.640]  big kumbaya come together and opposing these people in every single way and
[2:46:18.640 --> 2:46:22.080]  taking actions against them every single way if we can get enough
[2:46:22.080 --> 2:46:25.200]  people together if we can unite all the tribes
[2:46:25.200 --> 2:46:28.640]  then there doesn't have to be a violent revolution there doesn't have to be a
[2:46:28.640 --> 2:46:33.440]  fight with the government but if we stay separated if we don't work together
[2:46:33.440 --> 2:46:36.800]  then they're going to pick us apart and there won't even be it won't even come
[2:46:36.800 --> 2:46:40.320]  across as a civil war we'll just wake up one day and live in some crazy
[2:46:40.320 --> 2:46:43.200]  corporateist fascist state that's just spying on you
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:46.480]  even worse than we have now any any term i could use to describe it is
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:50.080]  something we already live under well that's what you said is key we're already
[2:46:50.080 --> 2:46:54.080]  in it it's just going to get more intense so either a violent revolution
[2:46:54.080 --> 2:46:58.960]  a violent civil war or wake up in this fascist hell we're already in or that
[2:46:58.960 --> 2:47:02.880]  fourth way people come together under populism say here is our
[2:47:02.880 --> 2:47:07.280]  social demand here is our here is our social contract
[2:47:07.280 --> 2:47:10.320]  and we all agree this is what you're going to do if we come together they have
[2:47:10.320 --> 2:47:13.680]  no power absolutely and you know the star star if
[2:47:13.680 --> 2:47:17.520]  you want you can talk about how like you got linked up with the boogaloo and
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:21.600]  all your efforts in kind of not only opposing people trying to sneak in to
[2:47:21.600 --> 2:47:25.440]  antifa but also like how we've been working
[2:47:25.440 --> 2:47:30.240]  so much in the accomplishments we've made well there's so much to it like that
[2:47:30.240 --> 2:47:33.840]  that right there would be an hour to unpack
[2:47:33.840 --> 2:47:37.440]  i think that because my upbringing was definitely more like
[2:47:37.440 --> 2:47:42.880]  farming more rural more conservative there was never the innate fear of men
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:46.960]  with guns or arms or second amendment
[2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:51.200]  i never had the preconceived biases against
[2:47:51.200 --> 2:47:57.360]  the conservative side of things but then i also for myself had more of a
[2:47:57.360 --> 2:48:02.800]  you know liberal view on the world and i concerned myself a lot with others but
[2:48:02.800 --> 2:48:06.400]  um things that happened this summer definitely
[2:48:06.400 --> 2:48:11.680]  were more volatile because we had the i saw more than ever the divisiveness and
[2:48:11.680 --> 2:48:16.880]  the mass media portraying antifa all the activists and i hate to use the
[2:48:16.880 --> 2:48:20.240]  term antifa because we're not i mean yeah i guess that's what we get blanketed
[2:48:20.240 --> 2:48:22.800]  i don't want to interrupt you start two minutes we're coming back to you we got
[2:48:22.800 --> 2:48:26.480]  to start the fourth hour we'll come back and talk about your
[2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:29.760]  awakening as antifa you should reach out to others
[2:48:29.760 --> 2:48:34.800]  hour four straight ahead hey alex how you doing man
[2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:37.680]  is this the guy that called in about living defense
[2:48:37.680 --> 2:48:41.760]  yes sir yes sir i've been trying to get a hold of you since monday
[2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:46.320]  when i heard you got that fresh shipment of living defense in from utah
[2:48:46.320 --> 2:48:50.000]  i said man i gotta get on that show and give him an update
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:53.520]  i said if i ever get a chance to be on alex stone show
[2:48:53.520 --> 2:48:58.320]  i'm gonna tell the world about living defense and what it did for me personally
[2:48:58.320 --> 2:49:03.440]  now look i'm 64 years old going on 20 thanks to this info
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:07.600]  for store products and by the way i bought 800 dollars worth the other night
[2:49:07.600 --> 2:49:12.800]  so i'm doing what i can brother so what my my contingency is why don't we start
[2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:16.880]  this new year off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of
[2:49:16.880 --> 2:49:21.920]  living defense now you gotta follow that up with the micro vx i learned that
[2:49:21.920 --> 2:49:26.320]  so it's like god working is so amazing we didn't know we didn't screen your call
[2:49:26.320 --> 2:49:29.600]  we had no idea and i go to you a year later and you're
[2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:33.520]  here telling people about living defense living defense living defense
[2:49:33.520 --> 2:49:37.040]  the pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate
[2:49:37.040 --> 2:49:41.040]  alliance to redistribute wealth create a planetary universal
[2:49:41.040 --> 2:49:44.160]  income which of course the united nations and global corporations will
[2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:47.520]  control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin
[2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:53.440]  it's all now completely official part of the un great reset of the debauchery
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:57.760]  and claus schwaub all officially written about in hundreds of books by schwaub
[2:49:57.760 --> 2:50:01.520]  and rocker feller foundation all the rest of them at 10 to 21 to 20 30
[2:50:01.520 --> 2:50:05.280]  it's here and only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper
[2:50:05.280 --> 2:50:09.360]  or a meat grinder until you reject it all
[2:50:09.360 --> 2:50:13.760]  and the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle good versus evil
[2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:17.920]  and stopping abortion we must start valuing human life again
[2:50:17.920 --> 2:50:22.800]  we must start saying that we are not expendable that we are not disposable
[2:50:22.800 --> 2:50:28.800]  that we are essential until we do that we are all slaves we must stand up and
[2:50:28.800 --> 2:50:33.040]  declare our basic god-given human rights now
[2:50:33.040 --> 2:50:42.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:45.920 --> 2:50:52.880]  back about 18 and 25 i left tennessee very much alive
[2:50:52.880 --> 2:50:57.680]  i never would have made it through the arkansas mud if i hadn't been riding
[2:50:57.680 --> 2:51:03.280]  on the tennessee stud
[2:51:03.280 --> 2:51:10.720]  had some trouble with my sweetheart's paw one of her brothers was a bad outlaw
[2:51:10.720 --> 2:51:16.560]  i rolled a letter to my uncle's foot and i rode away on the tennessee stud
[2:51:16.560 --> 2:51:20.560]  all right we've got an antifa member starbe and a member 21 plus years as the
[2:51:20.560 --> 2:51:26.000]  w d o riots magnus panvidia is a one of the main spokesman or
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:30.560]  prominent speakers for the boogalos we've got
[2:51:30.560 --> 2:51:34.160]  matt bracken joining us next segment he can ask these guys some questions before
[2:51:34.160 --> 2:51:38.480]  he takes over of a star you got caught up on the break you were getting into
[2:51:38.480 --> 2:51:41.760]  kind of you're away getting to reach out to people and start speaking out
[2:51:41.760 --> 2:51:45.040]  that you were saying happened six seven eight months ago please continue
[2:51:45.040 --> 2:51:48.880]  yeah what i was saying is more and more see it's always been a battle
[2:51:48.880 --> 2:51:52.720]  of us against the you know what's going on that we're upset about
[2:51:52.720 --> 2:51:56.240]  um usually something involving corporate takeover or
[2:51:56.240 --> 2:51:59.680]  oppression of people like the black lives matter movement totally jumped on
[2:51:59.680 --> 2:52:05.440]  because there is systemic racism and oppression and cops need to quit
[2:52:05.440 --> 2:52:10.000]  overstepping and the um the entire police union of the way it's set up
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:15.200]  protects them and so there's like things going on that shouldn't and we need to
[2:52:15.200 --> 2:52:18.880]  in exchange by any means necessary pretty much
[2:52:18.880 --> 2:52:23.120]  so i jumped on that because it's like yes it's ridiculous crown of taylor was a
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:27.120]  big thing for me um it like as a gun owner myself
[2:52:27.120 --> 2:52:33.760]  and as a medical professional there was the feeling of like thought she's been
[2:52:33.760 --> 2:52:37.840]  just stretching herself so thin working double shifts you know helping with
[2:52:37.840 --> 2:52:42.480]  covid and then she gets shot in bed sleeping
[2:52:42.480 --> 2:52:45.840]  probably wake up at the time but anyway and then like i thought about it it's
[2:52:45.840 --> 2:52:48.960]  like why aren't all of the like the right wing and the
[2:52:48.960 --> 2:52:52.640]  two-way and the nra being out the outreach about this these were legally
[2:52:52.640 --> 2:52:55.520]  owned guns this was a no not great it wasn't even
[2:52:55.520 --> 2:52:59.520]  the person that they needed to rest was in custody these people bombarded this
[2:52:59.520 --> 2:53:03.920]  house not in uniform not declaring themselves police
[2:53:03.920 --> 2:53:06.960]  like what would someone think if they were in their bed
[2:53:06.960 --> 2:53:11.040]  and all of a sudden these people probably fight and busting into the house
[2:53:11.040 --> 2:53:15.120]  with guns i would think i have the right to defend myself that is exactly why we
[2:53:15.120 --> 2:53:19.040]  have the right to our arms to defend ourselves between who knows what coming
[2:53:19.040 --> 2:53:22.960]  in to lynch us so that's one point i make a
[2:53:22.960 --> 2:53:25.760]  lot i want you to continue to interrupt i mean
[2:53:25.760 --> 2:53:29.600]  is that seeing anti-faction out with guns
[2:53:29.600 --> 2:53:32.720]  and other liberal groups i'm like oh you finally get it now you got to take power
[2:53:32.720 --> 2:53:36.160]  into your own hands that's what the second amendment is all about so i'm
[2:53:36.160 --> 2:53:39.200]  actually not threatened by them having guns as long as they don't shoot innocent
[2:53:39.200 --> 2:53:42.800]  people just like i'm not upset of some right wing group has guns so i think
[2:53:42.800 --> 2:53:46.640]  the left i talked a lot of gun shops and the national numbers show this
[2:53:46.640 --> 2:53:50.080]  the biggest group buying guns now is leftist and liberals can you comment to
[2:53:50.080 --> 2:53:54.240]  that absolutely uh that's when i got mine
[2:53:54.240 --> 2:53:59.280]  was at the beginning of this actually so um and i know a lot of us are and i mean
[2:53:59.280 --> 2:54:04.080]  i do have a farm so we do have a problem i did lose some goats to cougar um
[2:54:04.080 --> 2:54:08.000]  but was it not liberating the first time you started squeezing off a few rounds
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:11.120]  i've actually was raised around guns so it wasn't the first time i had fired a
[2:54:11.120 --> 2:54:13.840]  gun and it didn't necessarily feel liberating or not
[2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:16.800]  liberating what about your friends i mean people shooting
[2:54:16.800 --> 2:54:19.440]  guns is fun i mean i take people that never shot
[2:54:19.440 --> 2:54:23.280]  before shooting they have a great time i think because i was raised so much
[2:54:23.280 --> 2:54:26.960]  around it i don't even think of it as fun i think it is is a tool it's a tool
[2:54:26.960 --> 2:54:30.720]  that is necessary at certain time and if a cougar comes to get my goats i don't
[2:54:30.720 --> 2:54:35.040]  want to get too close um but also you know i don't i want to be able to defend
[2:54:35.040 --> 2:54:40.480]  myself i want to be able to protect my family and that matters to me
[2:54:40.480 --> 2:54:44.640]  but um yeah the whole thing with young taylor happened and then i'd
[2:54:44.640 --> 2:54:47.840]  like that summer so i've been i've been active active some and in the street
[2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:51.920]  some um i had heard an npr thing about the big blue boys
[2:54:51.920 --> 2:54:55.360]  and it was actually i feel like a pretty good representation then because i
[2:54:55.360 --> 2:54:58.080]  thought oh they're just some of those white guys with guns that have now made
[2:54:58.080 --> 2:55:00.720]  us terrified because whereas our normal battle is
[2:55:00.720 --> 2:55:03.920]  maybe with the police or you know things like that now
[2:55:03.920 --> 2:55:07.520]  all of a sudden out from the side comes these guys with guns and what are
[2:55:07.520 --> 2:55:11.200]  their intentions like some of them aren't good it was clear that the proud
[2:55:11.200 --> 2:55:14.320]  boys and whatever else were there to intimidate us to terrify us and to make
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:18.400]  us think they might just shoot us all um which was not lovely and some of the
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:20.960]  things they said made it pretty clear that their intention might be to shoot us
[2:55:20.960 --> 2:55:24.400]  all um but then there's these guys and these white
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:28.560]  shirts that seem a little different and yeah there was a couple situations
[2:55:28.560 --> 2:55:32.400]  where um they said or did things that made it not
[2:55:32.400 --> 2:55:35.200]  quite certain who they were there to support well i'll tell you that is an
[2:55:35.200 --> 2:55:42.080]  exciting thing to talk about back in 60 seconds and matt ragan joins us
[2:55:42.160 --> 2:55:45.840]  info wars is a archetypal classic example
[2:55:45.840 --> 2:55:49.600]  of free independent organic resistance against tyranny
[2:55:49.600 --> 2:55:53.680]  you built info wars you spread the word you prayed for us
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:55:58.560]  you bought the products you called in you made recommendations info wars is as
[2:55:58.560 --> 2:56:02.800]  much yours as it is mine and that's why the enemy is so upset that
[2:56:02.800 --> 2:56:06.480]  under the deplatforming under all the dnc lawsuits under all the attack
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:11.040]  in many ways we become stronger with bandot video redesign info wars with
[2:56:11.040 --> 2:56:15.120]  all of our great crew with documentary films and
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:19.680]  10 hours of live radio and tv a day we are the resistance
[2:56:19.680 --> 2:56:24.320]  you are the resistance so remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you
[2:56:24.320 --> 2:56:28.240]  to continue to spread the word about it and to continue for you to support
[2:56:28.240 --> 2:56:31.600]  because this is something we built together it's not just a national
[2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:35.360]  treasure it's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants and they know it
[2:56:35.360 --> 2:56:38.240]  and they can't stand it and as everything we talked about comes true
[2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:43.040]  our credibility only goes up together so i salute you all
[2:56:52.320 --> 2:56:57.120]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[2:56:57.120 --> 2:57:03.920]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from austin texas broadcasting
[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:10.320]  worldwide it's alex jones well we had steve machinicon for an hour that was
[2:57:10.320 --> 2:57:14.800]  wild and now we've got magnus penn videa who's a major leader in the boogaloo
[2:57:14.800 --> 2:57:19.760]  movement and his friend 21 year long and if i remember star
[2:57:19.760 --> 2:57:27.520]  who's on with a star s h a k t i one or at united voluntary on twitter
[2:57:27.520 --> 2:57:30.240]  and i'm all about talking to groups from all over town people she was just
[2:57:30.240 --> 2:57:33.440]  saying like i wish she i guess she's protecting her
[2:57:33.440 --> 2:57:36.720]  and that she's wearing the mask it's kind of like antipope wasn't cool that it
[2:57:36.720 --> 2:57:40.320]  was totally chic under the lockdown everybody wearing masks but she's
[2:57:40.320 --> 2:57:43.200]  talking about oh my god i saw this black person get killed for their guns well
[2:57:43.200 --> 2:57:47.520]  i don't care what color you are but still about 14 black men a year is the
[2:57:47.520 --> 2:57:52.000]  numbers maybe you can say they're higher or lower get killed by cops
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:56.480]  in a way that's wrong and the studies actually show that cops are
[2:57:56.480 --> 2:57:59.120]  more likely twice as likely to shoot a white person
[2:57:59.120 --> 2:58:02.640]  because they're not scared uh and they slow roll into communities i see two
[2:58:02.640 --> 2:58:07.280]  thousand dead black people year in chicago and then i see you know 14 dead
[2:58:07.280 --> 2:58:09.840]  there i don't want to get off in a statistical debate
[2:58:09.840 --> 2:58:14.000]  i just see soros the democratic party claiming they own black people
[2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:17.440]  and they represent them and then everybody like oh our movement's tied to
[2:58:17.440 --> 2:58:20.560]  this we're out protesting to protect the black people i mean
[2:58:20.560 --> 2:58:23.600]  what about half the black folks that never get out of the womb
[2:58:23.600 --> 2:58:26.960]  that's a whole nother debate but magnus you want to comment on that
[2:58:26.960 --> 2:58:30.000]  star you want to comment on that because i'm not here to defend the police
[2:58:30.000 --> 2:58:33.520]  hell we got the cia saying they're coming after american gun owners and
[2:58:33.520 --> 2:58:37.680]  conservatives i'm worried about the power of the state but the individual
[2:58:37.680 --> 2:58:42.480]  cop i i just don't think on average is some kkk grand dragon like a senator
[2:58:42.480 --> 2:58:45.520]  bird well that that's that's kind of the thing though
[2:58:45.520 --> 2:58:48.800]  it's like oh sorry sorry sorry yeah that that's just the thing though is is
[2:58:48.800 --> 2:58:52.240]  yeah the whole bunch of white people get killed by cops and shady sentences too
[2:58:52.240 --> 2:58:55.680]  but i don't think that diminishes from things or blm are saying
[2:58:55.680 --> 2:58:59.520]  our entire movement was formed because of a no knock raid against a legal gun
[2:58:59.520 --> 2:59:03.760]  owner that was killed in his bed you know and he was a white guy in maryland
[2:59:03.760 --> 2:59:07.760]  so that that's kind of why we've come together on this and you've seen
[2:59:07.760 --> 2:59:11.520]  you know like i i agreed with you before that i don't view just average officer
[2:59:11.520 --> 2:59:15.120]  friendly as some evil enemy but you have these police unions you have these
[2:59:15.120 --> 2:59:19.440]  police institutions you have these party funds coming into these and they are
[2:59:19.440 --> 2:59:22.880]  covering up things they're lying about things and they're going after people
[2:59:22.880 --> 2:59:25.760]  and i know i also know that there's plenty of officers that have spoken up
[2:59:25.760 --> 2:59:29.280]  against this themselves and have been fired or kicked out of their
[2:59:29.280 --> 2:59:33.200]  precinct for sure i just see the democrat soros deep state wanting control
[2:59:33.200 --> 2:59:36.800]  that apparatus i don't see them trying to reform it
[2:59:36.800 --> 2:59:42.080]  i want the apparatus to be lessened or go away that's where i'm at with it
[2:59:42.080 --> 2:59:45.040]  like i i think that yes there's a certain level of legitimate policing that
[2:59:45.040 --> 2:59:48.880]  needs to occur um one of the things that i think is legitimate is okay we have
[2:59:48.880 --> 2:59:51.920]  rape victims now i don't think that anybody doesn't rape
[2:59:51.920 --> 2:59:55.600]  because they might get busted for some reason that's not how it works
[2:59:55.600 --> 2:59:58.960]  but when we do have rape victims and they do submit to
[2:59:58.960 --> 3:00:03.920]  a very invasive test to actually you know
[3:00:03.920 --> 3:00:08.960]  now what do you make of the Minnesota AG saying don't report rape
[3:00:09.600 --> 3:00:12.000]  i don't even know what i think about that because i hadn't even heard about
[3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:15.760]  that
[3:00:15.760 --> 3:00:20.720]  he said the woman's rape you'd call the rape hotline don't call the cops
[3:00:20.720 --> 3:00:23.760]  you know that might be a better idea at this point because there's so many
[3:00:23.760 --> 3:00:26.560]  untested rape kits in every precinct
[3:00:26.560 --> 3:00:30.240]  everywhere so i don't understand where the cops have the funding for doing all
[3:00:30.240 --> 3:00:32.880]  these other things that they do and enforcing all these other things they
[3:00:32.880 --> 3:00:35.760]  enforce but if they say oh we don't have the funds to test rape kit
[3:00:35.760 --> 3:00:38.800]  i think that that is just horrible it's important if a woman has gone through
[3:00:38.800 --> 3:00:42.240]  having a rape kit collected which is almost as violating
[3:00:42.240 --> 3:00:46.800]  as being raped in the first place it's yeah it sounds like the new uh
[3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:50.640]  covid anal swabs i don't want that either let's bring in matt bracken he's
[3:00:50.640 --> 3:00:54.080]  about to take over the rest of the hour matt bracken's a former navy seal
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:00:58.240]  an author researcher enemies for in the midst of com matt we've got a boogaloo
[3:00:58.240 --> 3:01:02.240]  uh prominent spokesperson and we've got a prominent antifa here right now so
[3:01:02.240 --> 3:01:06.400]  we're all together yeah nice to meet you yeah i i'm
[3:01:06.400 --> 3:01:09.360]  i'm not familiar with these guys i was listening a little bit while i was
[3:01:09.360 --> 3:01:13.680]  doing my show prep um you know honestly uh
[3:01:13.680 --> 3:01:18.160]  researching the history of antifa it goes back to the 1930s with the
[3:01:18.160 --> 3:01:22.800]  street wars against the national socialists essentially antifa were the
[3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:27.600]  international socialists and when they had their very first congress
[3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:32.320]  in burlain they had giant hammers and sickles and
[3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:36.240]  marxist leninist symbology all over the background you can
[3:01:36.240 --> 3:01:40.320]  look up the pictures notably they had the exact same
[3:01:40.320 --> 3:01:45.360]  logos that they're using today so you know if an antifa person tells me
[3:01:45.360 --> 3:01:49.920]  that they want to find common cause uh with you know former trump supporters
[3:01:49.920 --> 3:01:53.920]  or something like that i'm just rolling my eyes and saying
[3:01:53.920 --> 3:01:57.360]  you know this is either an a historical useful idiot
[3:01:57.360 --> 3:02:01.360]  you know larper or just outright lying because
[3:02:01.360 --> 3:02:05.840]  antifa has been hardcore international socialist
[3:02:05.840 --> 3:02:11.520]  aka globalist communist from its roots until now let me throw that out and
[3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:14.480]  let me ask anybody that anybody that's familiar with this is a useful idea to
[3:02:14.480 --> 3:02:18.480]  rely on yeah we had a report six months ago or
[3:02:18.480 --> 3:02:23.200]  five months ago in burlain with the original enclave since the 30s that
[3:02:23.200 --> 3:02:28.080]  is their own controlled zone uh what you for those that don't know
[3:02:28.080 --> 3:02:32.080]  what are your roots star to the original antifascist that control part of
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:36.560]  burlain well i think that that is actually
[3:02:36.560 --> 3:02:41.280]  part of the whole packaging that is being done by the media
[3:02:41.280 --> 3:02:46.800]  um first of all i'm not a member like any more than anyone else is it is so
[3:02:46.800 --> 3:02:50.720]  decentralized it's impossible to
[3:02:50.720 --> 3:02:54.160]  to explain actually truly how decentralized it is
[3:02:54.160 --> 3:02:58.880]  um secondly very few that are under the blanket that they call
[3:02:58.880 --> 3:03:03.760]  antifa are actually adherent to any of those ideologies
[3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:07.760]  like most well i think it's good to have a discussion to to open up
[3:03:07.760 --> 3:03:10.320]  talks about the different stratas of different groups that are there personally
[3:03:10.320 --> 3:03:14.480]  i'm not even a communist so like i'm way more of just a general
[3:03:14.480 --> 3:03:18.320]  anarchist or monarchist i feel like some government is okay but it needs to exist
[3:03:18.320 --> 3:03:22.240]  on a very local level i think that the problems that every community faces are
[3:03:22.240 --> 3:03:24.960]  different i feel like the things that are needed for
[3:03:24.960 --> 3:03:28.320]  seattle or what would make a good certain that would say you're just
[3:03:28.320 --> 3:03:32.000]  sounding reasonable to recruit people and i think you sound like a real person
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:35.600]  i think this just shows the strata about is okay magnus
[3:03:35.600 --> 3:03:38.960]  hand video i do know that there's a complicated history
[3:03:38.960 --> 3:03:43.760]  to the origins of the term on tifa but i will also say that almost nobody that
[3:03:43.760 --> 3:03:48.800]  marches with that umbrella association is actually
[3:03:48.800 --> 3:03:54.480]  okay and you're against using force to stop people's free speech
[3:03:54.480 --> 3:03:58.240]  yes i guess using force to stop free speech all right i'm out of time
[3:03:58.240 --> 3:04:05.760]  a magnus band video i appreciate you star uh who's star s h a k t i one or you
[3:04:05.760 --> 3:04:11.200]  you know united uh voluntary uh on twitter thank you so much for your time
[3:04:11.200 --> 3:04:15.200]  i appreciate all of it today and we'll talk to both of you again
[3:04:15.200 --> 3:04:19.440]  very very soon thank you all right matt rackin i thought we should do some
[3:04:19.440 --> 3:04:22.560]  different things here and get some different ideas here on the broadcast we
[3:04:22.560 --> 3:04:26.720]  certainly shake things up with steve pacinic and these folks today tell us
[3:04:26.720 --> 3:04:30.000]  matt what you've got coming up in the next 45 minutes
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:34.400]  um well you know i'd like to finish out a little bit uh just of that
[3:04:34.400 --> 3:04:37.440]  that previous conversation because i think it's very important this whole
[3:04:37.440 --> 3:04:41.760]  distinction between antifa blm so-called anarchists
[3:04:41.760 --> 3:04:46.480]  and where they really fit into the revolutionary revolutionary movement
[3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:49.600]  the way that i see it it's sort of as as a
[3:04:49.600 --> 3:04:55.600]  a a one step removed cut out from the actual communists they're used as
[3:04:55.600 --> 3:05:00.640]  street thugs useful idiots but in the end the communists just
[3:05:00.640 --> 3:05:04.400]  you know either communists know they're not popular so they've got a dozen
[3:05:04.400 --> 3:05:08.640]  different flavors that forms their command and control army to try to suck
[3:05:08.640 --> 3:05:12.720]  people up into it but in but in the end the anarchists that
[3:05:12.720 --> 3:05:16.880]  are kind of like you know just uh ultra libertarian
[3:05:16.880 --> 3:05:20.880]  um they're just murdered in the spanish civil war the anarchists fought with the
[3:05:20.880 --> 3:05:24.800]  communists but they could never decide like what time to start an attack
[3:05:24.800 --> 3:05:27.040]  you know because they're anarchists there's no leader
[3:05:27.040 --> 3:05:31.760]  eventually the communists said march under our banner anybody who doesn't
[3:05:31.760 --> 3:05:35.280]  you're gonna be shot and that's what happens in the end they all
[3:05:35.280 --> 3:05:40.240]  march under the the hammer and sickle or their shot
[3:05:40.240 --> 3:05:43.600]  i think that's historically true and we'll we should have these guys back on
[3:05:43.600 --> 3:05:46.720]  if she was a good guest with a mask on you can understand half of it
[3:05:46.720 --> 3:05:50.800]  so i just it's all it's all like notice antifa's wearing a mask now there's
[3:05:50.800 --> 3:05:53.840]  this happens so now everybody's wearing a mask now they can operate however they
[3:05:53.840 --> 3:05:57.280]  want all right matt bracken is about to take over

[3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:08.360]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your
[3:09:08.360 --> 3:09:12.400]  host matt bracken
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:19.200]  you know that the last segment was a pretty good lead in and I'd like to
[3:09:19.200 --> 3:09:25.520]  continue on that theme a little bit it's not like we're just discovering how to
[3:09:25.520 --> 3:09:30.640]  operate in the middle of this type of a of a fourth generation communist
[3:09:30.640 --> 3:09:35.640]  revolution and it's worth going over a little bit of history you know well
[3:09:35.640 --> 3:09:40.800]  meaning or well well meaning at least in appearance people that call themselves
[3:09:40.800 --> 3:09:48.800]  anarchists or antifa or BLM 99% of them are have the personal issues and
[3:09:48.800 --> 3:09:53.440]  they're larping but it's important to understand that the hardcore communists
[3:09:53.440 --> 3:09:59.960]  that are really the puppet masters they they use these people as just as just
[3:09:59.960 --> 3:10:05.160]  street agitators this is part of Lenin's formula where he said the worst the
[3:10:05.160 --> 3:10:09.280]  better you know to make the proper revolutionary conditions you need what
[3:10:09.280 --> 3:10:14.720]  we saw all summer with BLM and antifa burning cities attacking police
[3:10:14.720 --> 3:10:19.960]  stations and you know government buildings but in the end once the
[3:10:19.960 --> 3:10:25.360]  proper revolutionary conditions are met all of those larkers are swept aside
[3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:29.920]  they're either they're either shot and bulldozed into mass graves as useful
[3:10:29.920 --> 3:10:35.680]  idiots whose whose you know usefulness has expired or they're just told look
[3:10:35.680 --> 3:10:40.360]  wear the uniform put on the hammer and sickle and shut up and if you want to
[3:10:40.360 --> 3:10:43.960]  live that's what you'll do in the Spanish Civil War that's exactly what
[3:10:43.960 --> 3:10:48.880]  happened people went there to fight against the against the phalanges you
[3:10:48.880 --> 3:10:53.800]  know the Franco forces many of them identified as anarchists or socialists
[3:10:53.800 --> 3:10:58.600]  but in the end they all had to put on the hammer and sickle or end up shot
[3:10:58.600 --> 3:11:03.480]  that's just simple reality and I and I feel sorry for people like the last two
[3:11:03.480 --> 3:11:08.040]  guests who are so historically ignorant that they don't understand that they're
[3:11:08.040 --> 3:11:13.080]  just essentially like a bag of mulch that's going to be thrown into the ground
[3:11:13.080 --> 3:11:18.600]  you know when when their usefulness is over now that the main thing I want to
[3:11:18.600 --> 3:11:24.600]  talk about today is that the backwash of the the capital what I call the Reich
[3:11:24.600 --> 3:11:30.000]  Stagg riot because it's clear that it was allowed to happen there was there was
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:36.040]  much advanced notice that it that there were several factions planning to rush
[3:11:36.040 --> 3:11:42.240]  the capital they were in position as we've discussed well before Trump finished
[3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:47.920]  his speech it's a half hour walk from the ellipse down the mall to the capital
[3:11:47.920 --> 3:11:52.400]  the attack was already underway you know when I was near the Washington
[3:11:52.400 --> 3:11:57.520]  monument where I could watch both north to the ellipse and east to the capital
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:12:02.200]  and by the time I was halfway down the mall there were already banners being
[3:12:02.200 --> 3:12:07.280]  hung from upper balconies and you know with binoculars you could see people
[3:12:07.280 --> 3:12:12.440]  swarming the outside of the capital clearly in denied areas so the attack
[3:12:12.440 --> 3:12:17.360]  was underway before Trump ever finished so that's why I call it the Reich Stagg
[3:12:17.360 --> 3:12:22.680]  riot if all they had outside were the bicycle racks which are useless for
[3:12:22.680 --> 3:12:27.320]  stopping a crowd you know when you have a half a million people less than a mile
[3:12:27.320 --> 3:12:31.760]  away and all you put up are bicycle racks I don't care if they were the little
[3:12:31.760 --> 3:12:36.440]  sisters of the poor a half a million of anybody means that there's going to be
[3:12:36.440 --> 3:12:41.720]  some element that's that's prepared to storm a government building so by by
[3:12:41.720 --> 3:12:48.160]  having just a ring of bicycle racks around the the capital and no extra no
[3:12:48.160 --> 3:12:53.720]  extra police force on duty clearly they wanted the place to be stormed that's
[3:12:53.720 --> 3:13:01.480]  why I call it the Reich Stagg riot and now we're seeing calls for a war on
[3:13:01.480 --> 3:13:08.880]  domestic terrorism essentially branding any Caucasian Trump supporter as a
[3:13:08.880 --> 3:13:16.120]  potential insider threat and I want to go right to the news today which is the
[3:13:16.120 --> 3:13:21.960]  United States Army doing a 60-day stand-down you know to root out white
[3:13:21.960 --> 3:13:28.120]  extremists it's interesting that when Obama was president there was a guy
[3:13:28.120 --> 3:13:35.560]  named Major Major Hassan Nidal or Nidal Hassan at Fort Hood Texas he was
[3:13:35.560 --> 3:13:41.400]  giving PowerPoint lectures on the legitimacy of Jihad and the and the
[3:13:41.400 --> 3:13:47.680]  legitimacy of attacking US soldiers because of America attacking Islamic
[3:13:47.680 --> 3:13:53.480]  countries and the US Army thought that's fine he was even in contact emailing
[3:13:53.480 --> 3:13:59.280]  Anwar Alaki who was in Somalia at the time and before and after his terror
[3:13:59.280 --> 3:14:03.680]  attack the army said well he was just doing research for his religious studies
[3:14:03.680 --> 3:14:09.840]  they called his attack workplace violence I mean the guy had a business
[3:14:09.840 --> 3:14:17.120]  card that said soldier of Allah and he was outside of the uniform he wore you
[3:14:17.120 --> 3:14:23.280]  know radical traditional extremist Muslim garb all these warning signs
[3:14:23.280 --> 3:14:29.480]  completely ignored and even after he murdered 13 army personnel independence
[3:14:29.480 --> 3:14:35.600]  and wounded 30 they called it workplace violence the victims wouldn't even get
[3:14:35.600 --> 3:14:40.520]  purple hearts for years later until Trump came into office as I understand it
[3:14:40.520 --> 3:14:48.120]  but as as compared to that a couple you know a handful of goofballs going into
[3:14:48.120 --> 3:14:52.960]  the Capitol some of whom were violent and it's completely wrong but I mean look
[3:14:52.960 --> 3:14:57.520]  going into capitals has been done by the you know the pink hat brigade it's been
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:15:02.040]  done by unions in Wisconsin and Michigan it's not like this has never happened
[3:15:02.040 --> 3:15:07.080]  yeah look at them storming through those those velvet ropes or that how about the
[3:15:07.080 --> 3:15:12.600]  you know our friend the Q shaman the Q shaman is going to probably spend as much
[3:15:12.600 --> 3:15:18.320]  time in prison you know as as a real terrorist and it's it's such a joke and
[3:15:18.320 --> 3:15:22.520]  it's so transparent what they're trying to do is go to conservatives into a
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:27.400]  reaction they're they're poking and poking if this is like in bar fight
[3:15:27.400 --> 3:15:32.360]  behavior this is the disrespecting and poking you know this is the calling your
[3:15:32.360 --> 3:15:36.920]  girlfriend a slut this is the this is the getting real close and breathing in
[3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:41.640]  your face they're trying to provoke a reaction this is where you get this
[3:15:41.640 --> 3:15:48.400]  former CIA counterterrorism boss named Grineer saying that they're going to need
[3:15:48.400 --> 3:15:55.080]  to declare war on domestic insurgents and he names proud boys oath keepers
[3:15:55.080 --> 3:16:00.800]  oath keepers who who's promised to abide by their oath to defend the
[3:16:00.800 --> 3:16:05.240]  Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic Stuart Rhodes has been on
[3:16:05.240 --> 3:16:11.280]  this program many times they're now a declared enemy and the former head of
[3:16:11.280 --> 3:16:16.840]  CIA counterterrorism who ordered drone strikes all over Iraq and Afghanistan
[3:16:16.840 --> 3:16:23.080]  he's saying we're going to have to use military tactics against this dangerous
[3:16:23.080 --> 3:16:29.520]  insider threat and what they are trying to do because this is a CIA senior
[3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:37.040]  officer you know retired long career he's not exactly naive or foolish this
[3:16:37.040 --> 3:16:41.560]  is the this is the chest bumping and chest poking calling your girlfriend a
[3:16:41.560 --> 3:16:46.840]  slut and you know breathing so close to your face trying to get you to punch
[3:16:46.840 --> 3:16:52.160]  back because they were actually I believe disappointed that the capital
[3:16:52.160 --> 3:16:57.480]  right-stag riot didn't go further and wasn't worse you know they were thinking
[3:16:57.480 --> 3:17:02.320]  in terms of BLM or Antifa once they're inside they'll be knocking over statues
[3:17:02.320 --> 3:17:07.600]  setting fires it didn't happen so they need to provoke and even get a bigger
[3:17:07.600 --> 3:17:12.600]  rise out of us what they're really really hoping for is something on the
[3:17:12.600 --> 3:17:18.040]  level of the Las Vegas shooting or Oklahoma City that's what that's the
[3:17:18.040 --> 3:17:22.120]  dream that keeps them up at night because then they'll be able to put the
[3:17:22.120 --> 3:17:28.360]  screws to us with a full-on completely totalitarian security state and I'm
[3:17:28.360 --> 3:17:38.600]  going to continue talking about this on the other side we told you it was
[3:17:38.600 --> 3:17:42.840]  coming under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore for eight months
[3:17:42.840 --> 3:17:47.160]  they made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that makes them a social
[3:17:47.160 --> 3:17:50.520]  distance and report them back to cell towers to track through every movement
[3:17:50.520 --> 3:17:55.400]  this is for everybody the way it's better now France has programs in their
[3:17:55.400 --> 3:17:59.840]  factories government push and sponsor to make everyone wear actual dog callers
[3:17:59.840 --> 3:18:04.360]  making social distance and report back to several computers they're turning us
[3:18:04.360 --> 3:18:08.720]  into a commodity human animal clones have been around for 50 years it's all
[3:18:08.720 --> 3:18:12.120]  being announced they are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and
[3:18:12.120 --> 3:18:16.400]  making us obsolete and big corporations downplay that they own us with these
[3:18:16.400 --> 3:18:20.840]  gene therapy systems and patents that they produced do you understand it is a
[3:18:20.840 --> 3:18:25.080]  takeover of the entire species of the genetic level and now they're coming with
[3:18:25.080 --> 3:18:28.920]  dog callers and they're announcing in public schools in the US starting next
[3:18:28.920 --> 3:18:33.440]  year it will begin did you hear me dog callers for your children all based on a
[3:18:33.440 --> 3:18:36.960]  hoax all based on a lot implore wars continue to spread the word to fight

[3:20:45.600 --> 3:21:09.480]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 it's Matt Bracken you're listening to the Alex
[3:21:09.480 --> 3:21:17.840]  Jones show you just see my book covers there you saw my book covers you know
[3:21:17.840 --> 3:21:23.080]  I wrote those books because I've been looking you know into the future so to
[3:21:23.080 --> 3:21:29.560]  speak just projecting trends forward comparing it to former history cycles
[3:21:29.560 --> 3:21:36.000]  and now we're there and I would recommend anybody that wants to you know
[3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:41.200]  to see the playbook and read some of the history you know get these novels and
[3:21:41.200 --> 3:21:46.280]  read them because we're in the middle of it now people ask me often Matt when
[3:21:46.280 --> 3:21:50.440]  you're gonna write your next novel and I say I'm not writing a novel because now
[3:21:50.440 --> 3:21:54.320]  we're living it now we're in it but if you want to see some more of these
[3:21:54.320 --> 3:22:01.440]  patterns I've been writing about it for years so the one January 27th and then
[3:22:01.440 --> 3:22:07.080]  we're last last week really the New York Times had a major opinion piece by
[3:22:07.080 --> 3:22:16.280]  Robert Grenier a former CIA station chief and counterterrorism boss imagine
[3:22:16.280 --> 3:22:22.000]  the New York Times 10 or 15 years ago putting in an opinion piece by a CIA
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  station chief that no way only it you know they would have been calling him a
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:33.680]  murdering butchering torturing you know rendition secret torture center guy
[3:22:33.680 --> 3:22:38.160]  he would have been public enemy number one but now that this guy who has
[3:22:38.160 --> 3:22:44.280]  actually came in under under of W under Bush into the counterterrorism world
[3:22:44.280 --> 3:22:51.200]  he's now saying we need to use the same war tools that we used against al Qaeda
[3:22:51.200 --> 3:22:58.160]  and the Taliban against and he lists them the proud boys the three percenters
[3:22:58.160 --> 3:23:05.560]  the oathkeepers Christian national chauvinists white supremacists and Q
[3:23:05.560 --> 3:23:12.840]  Anon fantasists he says they need to be defeated like an enemy army I wonder
[3:23:12.840 --> 3:23:18.520]  does that include drone strikes against weddings I mean this is some pretty sick
[3:23:18.520 --> 3:23:24.560]  stuff and they're not joking what they're trying to do is get a action
[3:23:24.560 --> 3:23:32.480]  reaction tit for tat going where they can use each but actual act of terrorism
[3:23:32.480 --> 3:23:38.440]  that they're trying to go to the right into providing for another excuse to
[3:23:38.440 --> 3:23:45.280]  slam down harder more troops on our streets more fences more razor wire less
[3:23:45.280 --> 3:23:51.080]  freedom of speech or no freedom of speech and what they'll always go to when
[3:23:51.080 --> 3:23:56.000]  they once they start going into this domestic terrorism mode it's going to
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:24:02.320]  be what they're called what they called in in northern Ireland internment or
[3:24:02.320 --> 3:24:07.600]  preventive detention this is where they just say look you're so anti-social
[3:24:07.600 --> 3:24:13.280]  you're so dangerous our algorithms our predictive programs say that you're the
[3:24:13.280 --> 3:24:18.720]  next Timothy McVeigh so we're just going to grab you off the street and that's it
[3:24:18.720 --> 3:24:24.120]  you'll be in a camp or at the very least you'll be silenced you'll be lucky if
[3:24:24.120 --> 3:24:28.880]  your ATM card works you won't be able to use any social media you'll be
[3:24:28.880 --> 3:24:34.040]  unpersoned we're already seeing them pushing to de-platform even people like
[3:24:34.040 --> 3:24:39.880]  Tucker Carlson you know I wrote an I wrote an article last week for American
[3:24:39.880 --> 3:24:45.360]  Partisan called called there are no guardrails on the left and this is a
[3:24:45.360 --> 3:24:50.920]  really important point for me to explain when when the when the
[3:24:50.920 --> 3:24:59.640]  conservatives gain total power say after a war there's a Judeo-Christian element
[3:24:59.640 --> 3:25:07.840]  and that that some moral moral compass some conscience says you know even
[3:25:07.840 --> 3:25:12.720]  though we've defeated the Plains Indians and there's a lot of bad blood right
[3:25:12.720 --> 3:25:17.880]  massacres we're not going to exterminate them you know that the
[3:25:17.880 --> 3:25:23.600]  president Grant could have said to General Sherman and General Sheridan who
[3:25:23.600 --> 3:25:28.400]  were out west after the after the Civil War let's just get rid of these red
[3:25:28.400 --> 3:25:33.040]  savages but we don't do it all right now I'm not saying there weren't massacres
[3:25:33.040 --> 3:25:37.800]  and there weren't atrocities like the Mai Lai massacre in Vietnam but that's not
[3:25:37.800 --> 3:25:43.480]  our paradigm we don't we didn't turn that we don't turn that way but on the
[3:25:43.480 --> 3:25:49.000]  left they do on the left there is no moral compass that says this is too far
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:56.200]  when the left gets full power they go to guillotines they go to gas chambers they
[3:25:56.200 --> 3:26:03.040]  go to gullogs they don't have a moral break they go until they're stopped or
[3:26:03.040 --> 3:26:09.000]  they just collapse you know North Korea is still running Cuba is still running
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:15.080]  Venezuela is on the way there's no there's no breaking mechanism and this
[3:26:15.080 --> 3:26:21.000]  is what we're going to see next we're going to see an action reaction back
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:26.640]  and forth this is what they want you know this is their goal to absolutely
[3:26:26.640 --> 3:26:33.000]  crush the 75 million people that at least that voted for Trump to to make us
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:39.080]  you know third-class citizens afraid to speak not allowed to speak I wouldn't be
[3:26:39.080 --> 3:26:43.960]  surprised if we have to wear a red tee on our shirt you know and get in the back
[3:26:43.960 --> 3:26:48.600]  of the line or only be able to shop when all the good people have already
[3:26:48.600 --> 3:26:54.120]  shopped you know get the leftovers because we are being framed as the most
[3:26:54.120 --> 3:26:59.960]  evil people if this this was sent to me and I'm going to read something this was
[3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:06.760]  sent to me by a former special forces officer okay he says I got a call from a
[3:27:06.760 --> 3:27:11.680]  fellow army officer I served with in Afghanistan in Iraq that was about 10
[3:27:11.680 --> 3:27:17.360]  years ago he is way up there in the hierarchy of blank blank blank all right
[3:27:17.360 --> 3:27:22.280]  he's still in the military the diversity a high senior officer the
[3:27:22.280 --> 3:27:27.040]  diversity nonsense is so completely rampant as to make the military we
[3:27:27.040 --> 3:27:32.520]  served in to be unrecognizable basically they are saying that diversity is now
[3:27:32.520 --> 3:27:39.640]  our readiness the mantra is that diversity inclusion support readiness he
[3:27:39.640 --> 3:27:45.840]  and another 160 senior senior leaders had to sit through a program taught by
[3:27:45.840 --> 3:27:53.280]  two transgender e4s e4s one guy who wants to be a woman and one woman who
[3:27:53.280 --> 3:27:58.080]  wants to be a guy it was all about how the military can make these people's
[3:27:58.080 --> 3:28:04.960]  lives better what the military should do etc etc you know the drill the fact
[3:28:04.960 --> 3:28:10.280]  that senior military leaders are sitting through this blather is insane the
[3:28:10.280 --> 3:28:15.720]  vice chief of the army paid them a visit and conducted a select hand-picked
[3:28:15.720 --> 3:28:21.120]  round table to discuss the topic and the hand-picking did not include people like
[3:28:21.120 --> 3:28:27.880]  my friend and now to catch this a new oath in addition they were having officers
[3:28:27.880 --> 3:28:34.160]  swear another oath like the first one we took also all those many years ago this
[3:28:34.160 --> 3:28:40.240]  time the new oath is to affirm that you are not in an extremist group of course
[3:28:40.240 --> 3:28:46.480]  there's no definition they'll be finalizing this oath and they'll be
[3:28:46.480 --> 3:28:53.800]  expanding it in time anything that's not explicitly leftist and woke will be
[3:28:53.800 --> 3:29:00.880]  banned were you ever a member of the NRA did you go to Washington on January 6
[3:29:00.880 --> 3:29:05.560]  were you in any group like the oath keepers which is so unbelievable because
[3:29:05.560 --> 3:29:10.400]  the oath keepers all about supporting the oath to defend the Constitution that
[3:29:10.400 --> 3:29:15.760]  these same army officers all swore to defend now they're they have to take
[3:29:15.760 --> 3:29:22.760]  the new woke oath this is craziness and the purpose of all this is to drive
[3:29:22.760 --> 3:29:28.880]  traditional heritage conservative Americans out of the military if you are
[3:29:28.880 --> 3:29:34.560]  assigned a transgender subordinate who wants to come to work with purple hair
[3:29:34.560 --> 3:29:41.680]  then you just have to accept it and if you even look sideways your career is
[3:29:41.680 --> 3:29:48.040]  over and this will be used to drive conservatives out because these subordinate
[3:29:48.040 --> 3:29:55.160]  you know these liberated subordinate SJW enlisted personnel and junior
[3:29:55.160 --> 3:30:01.320]  officers will have the power they can go to eat the EO the equal opportunity
[3:30:01.320 --> 3:30:06.360]  officer and say that officer is disrespecting me that's the end of that
[3:30:06.360 --> 3:30:11.120]  senior officers career this is going to force conservatives out of the military
[3:30:11.120 --> 3:30:17.440]  in droves this is the purpose of general Austin's 60-day stand down they want
[3:30:17.440 --> 3:30:22.680]  conservatives out of the military they want to turn the military into a
[3:30:22.680 --> 3:30:28.600]  completely woke SJW military and when we come back from the break I'm going to
[3:30:28.600 --> 3:30:34.640]  talk about where this will go next and it's not a good place
[3:30:36.840 --> 3:30:45.120]  as men age they often experience a slowdown in vitality energy and overall

[3:31:49.600 --> 3:31:54.000]  are carrying out they are not to produce people that are smarter folks that live
[3:31:54.000 --> 3:31:59.360]  longer or more oral no it's turning humanity into a commodity now we see
[3:31:59.360 --> 3:32:03.920]  some propaganda like communist China bragging hey we've done mRNA vaccines
[3:32:03.920 --> 3:32:08.520]  to make our soldiers superman that's a way to make it sexy that hey we're
[3:32:08.520 --> 3:32:12.480]  experimenting on our troops we'll say things with that into our troops and
[3:32:12.480 --> 3:32:16.440]  thousands and thousands died each time they tried a new experimental vaccine
[3:32:16.440 --> 3:32:20.320]  I've talked to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of
[3:32:20.320 --> 3:32:24.160]  South Park they say Alex you know it hurts a lot of people that's for a greater
[3:32:24.160 --> 3:32:28.120]  good but that's not even true and it violates the Geneva Convention the
[3:32:28.120 --> 3:32:32.360]  Nuremberg code federal state law this is violence being carried out against us
[3:32:32.360 --> 3:32:35.440]  by that is a charity and we have a right to resist it with any means
[3:32:35.440 --> 3:32:41.800]  necessary there are thousands of ideologies out there hundreds of
[3:32:41.800 --> 3:32:46.560]  different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist info
[3:32:46.560 --> 3:32:50.400]  wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist that's what a globalist are
[3:32:50.400 --> 3:32:54.600]  obsessed with it trying to shut it down I didn't invent all this I went and
[3:32:54.600 --> 3:32:59.120]  researched the Renaissance Americana and what really works for humanity and I'm
[3:32:59.120 --> 3:33:03.040]  simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular like it's
[3:33:03.040 --> 3:33:07.560]  always been that's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately
[3:33:07.560 --> 3:33:11.880]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that's since chills up my

[3:34:40.080 --> 3:34:45.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:34:45.440 --> 3:35:07.440]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[3:35:07.440 --> 3:35:20.880]  I can recommend this book very strongly foreign enemies and traders and let me
[3:35:20.880 --> 3:35:26.040]  tell you the internal traders are a lot more dangerous than the foreign enemies
[3:35:26.040 --> 3:35:32.000]  I wrote that and it was considered hyperbolic now people are saying it's
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:37.640]  like checking every box so what's going on in the military right now is a purge
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:42.920]  that's a it's a political purge it's using the cap the capital right stag
[3:35:42.920 --> 3:35:48.800]  riot as the excuse now there was no problem with hundreds of BLM and Antifa
[3:35:48.800 --> 3:35:57.480]  violent riots injured cops dead cops no problem but allow and incursion into the
[3:35:57.480 --> 3:36:04.640]  capital allow the right stag riot bicycle racks mean come on in when there's a
[3:36:04.640 --> 3:36:10.740]  half a million people 20 minutes away bicycle racks mean we want our building
[3:36:10.740 --> 3:36:18.320]  overrun that's why extra security forces were turned down that's why two
[3:36:18.320 --> 3:36:22.400]  police officers that I understand actually committed suicide afterwards I
[3:36:22.400 --> 3:36:26.800]  mean imagine the stress on these people knowing they were played for ponds like
[3:36:26.800 --> 3:36:32.240]  this now when I get back to talking about the military purge I need to talk
[3:36:32.240 --> 3:36:38.760]  a little bit about about the the about Lloyd Austin who's called this purge
[3:36:38.760 --> 3:36:46.240]  excuse me the rooting out extremism stand down I looked up on Wikipedia and
[3:36:46.240 --> 3:36:52.240]  some other places you can tell by his career path that he was selected for
[3:36:52.240 --> 3:36:58.000]  super fast affirmative action promotion it's apparent anybody that's been in the
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:03.160]  military can read that and say wow he was fast-tracked from the day he was
[3:37:03.160 --> 3:37:08.040]  commissioned at West Point in the 70s 41 years in the military that's great
[3:37:08.040 --> 3:37:13.600]  look at all those ribbons so he did no combat he's got a CIB on top but he
[3:37:13.600 --> 3:37:19.200]  really did no combat because when he was in the military as a junior officer when
[3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:22.760]  he would have when he would have been you know a platoon or company commander
[3:37:22.760 --> 3:37:28.040]  there was no war but he went to every you know 82nd Airborne 10th Mountain
[3:37:28.040 --> 3:37:33.280]  Division he was always there getting early promoted early promoted what
[3:37:33.280 --> 3:37:38.280]  really ticks me off or you know kind of bugs me because it's one of these bogus
[3:37:38.280 --> 3:37:43.640]  metals like Lyndon Baines Johnson gave himself during World War two to help his
[3:37:43.640 --> 3:37:48.400]  help launch for him from the Texas Congress to the Senate after World War
[3:37:48.400 --> 3:37:54.680]  two Lloyd Austin's got a silver star he was a general he got a silver star for
[3:37:54.680 --> 3:38:01.920]  his part in planning the invasion of Iraq as an assistant division commander
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:08.800]  this guy is going to get no closer to an Iraqi bullet than LBJ got to a
[3:38:08.800 --> 3:38:15.080]  Japanese fighter plane in other words he was maybe within a hundred miles ever
[3:38:15.080 --> 3:38:21.880]  of an Iraqi combatant and he got a silver star so after his 41 years four
[3:38:21.880 --> 3:38:27.760]  star general he gets out and he goes to work on the board of Raytheon new core
[3:38:27.760 --> 3:38:34.560]  and a big health a health care company so he he got his pay off as soon as he
[3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:41.600]  got out and now he's paying the deep state back by being their purge man so
[3:38:41.600 --> 3:38:48.480]  this is a guy who his military career from what I can tell fast-tracked every
[3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:54.000]  door opened in front of him miraculously early promotion silver star as a general
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:39:01.040]  what a joke okay I mean he he's almost shameless to accept a silver star he was
[3:39:01.040 --> 3:39:04.960]  at one of these deals where you write one for me and I'll write one for you and
[3:39:04.960 --> 3:39:11.040]  we'll all get silver stars this is like gag me material so now he's doing the
[3:39:11.040 --> 3:39:15.960]  stand-down purge to root out the white extremists well he was in the army when
[3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:22.560]  when Major Nadal Hassan murdered 13 army people at Fort Hood he was a
[3:39:22.560 --> 3:39:28.000]  mechanized army general in a when he went into Iraq did he say anything about
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:35.280]  what a ridiculous insult it is to call call this jihadist a murder mass
[3:39:35.280 --> 3:39:40.920]  murder an example of workplace violence now he's completely down for a 60 day
[3:39:40.920 --> 3:39:48.080]  purge you know this wasn't his idea this is purely political now I'm going to
[3:39:48.080 --> 3:39:52.600]  compare this to something that happened in the Soviet Union in the 1930s that
[3:39:52.600 --> 3:39:59.960]  had major consequences later when the Nazis invaded in 1941 Stalin was so much
[3:39:59.960 --> 3:40:04.720]  more worried and paranoid about security within his own ranks that he
[3:40:04.720 --> 3:40:09.280]  instituted a system of political officers I think they were called some
[3:40:09.280 --> 3:40:16.480]  police they were the Soviet equivalent of what today we have which is called the
[3:40:16.480 --> 3:40:22.960]  equal and equal opportunity officer who is an non-commissioned officer usually a
[3:40:22.960 --> 3:40:29.520]  minority almost invariably a minority who is assigned you know to to every
[3:40:29.520 --> 3:40:35.600]  company in battalion everywhere else as sort of a political correctness officer
[3:40:35.600 --> 3:40:42.120]  you know that's where the the transsexual adjutant will go to make a report that
[3:40:42.120 --> 3:40:48.240]  the Christian conservative you know insulted him in some way him or her
[3:40:48.240 --> 3:40:54.480]  slash you know whatever they are that day this is being used to purge our
[3:40:54.480 --> 3:41:01.960]  military the EO the the equal opportunity NCOs are the Zompolitz of the
[3:41:01.960 --> 3:41:08.400]  U.S. military and when I was serving I never saw these giant Soviet style
[3:41:08.400 --> 3:41:13.120]  murals but now you do see them all over the place the giant diversity is our
[3:41:13.120 --> 3:41:20.560]  strength murals very Soviet now what happened in the 1930s Stalin's paranoia
[3:41:20.560 --> 3:41:25.480]  increased and he began purging senior officers who weren't appropriately
[3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:30.480]  bootlicking or there was any rumor about them or they were just too successful
[3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:36.560]  were thought of too highly by their men which made them dangerous so he purged
[3:41:36.560 --> 3:41:41.600]  the officer Corps of the of the Red Army this meant when the Nazis you know
[3:41:41.600 --> 3:41:48.160]  turned around and attacked in June of 1941 his most qualified combat leaders
[3:41:48.160 --> 3:41:53.320]  were gone they were dead or they were in gulags some of them were brought back
[3:41:53.320 --> 3:41:57.680]  from the gulags because like you know a pinch hitter because it was recognized
[3:41:57.680 --> 3:42:02.400]  that they were talented officers but that wouldn't happen until late in the war
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:06.760]  when the Soviet Union had practically lost what's happening in the military
[3:42:06.760 --> 3:42:13.800]  now our combat arms anybody that has served and vouch for this the the good
[3:42:13.800 --> 3:42:20.600]  old boys the country boys the hillbillies the the rednecks are a high
[3:42:20.600 --> 3:42:28.960]  percentage of our combat arms special operations armor artillery and they are
[3:42:28.960 --> 3:42:34.280]  going to be pushed out that more conservative will be pushed out the
[3:42:34.280 --> 3:42:39.040]  ones that are not going to sit through hours a day of transsexual you know
[3:42:39.040 --> 3:42:44.320]  wonderfulness lectures which is literally happening in our military our
[3:42:44.320 --> 3:42:50.360]  military is spending more time on brainwashing lectures or political
[3:42:50.360 --> 3:42:56.960]  correctness than they are in the field training for combat this is partly
[3:42:56.960 --> 3:43:04.400]  responsible for for two of our best most modern destroyers high speed high
[3:43:04.400 --> 3:43:10.880]  maneuverability every sensor package in the world getting rammed by slow tankers
[3:43:10.880 --> 3:43:18.000]  because political correctness has run a muck in our military you know until 10
[3:43:18.000 --> 3:43:22.960]  or 15 years ago it was extremely difficult to become a surface warfare
[3:43:22.960 --> 3:43:28.480]  officer and it was challenging you had to go to a school you had to be you had
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:34.520]  to check off a qualifications list that was extremely demanding and if you
[3:43:34.520 --> 3:43:39.280]  didn't within a certain period on of after boarding your ship you couldn't
[3:43:39.280 --> 3:43:44.680]  even ever qualify for surface warfare officer you were out well if the wrong
[3:43:44.680 --> 3:43:48.880]  minorities aren't passing at the exact same rate as those evil old you know
[3:43:48.880 --> 3:43:54.120]  white men then get rid of the test get rid of the school make it on the job
[3:43:54.120 --> 3:44:00.760]  training and if and if the if females or today transgenders or minorities
[3:44:00.760 --> 3:44:05.760]  complain that they're not equally represented represented as surface
[3:44:05.760 --> 3:44:10.720]  warfare officers and you can extend this to missile officers or submarine
[3:44:10.720 --> 3:44:16.160]  officers then get rid of the test get rid of the qualification it's more
[3:44:16.160 --> 3:44:22.240]  important diversity is more important than anything so you can see where this
[3:44:22.240 --> 3:44:27.600]  is going to go when we actually have to fight a peer-level enemy like a China
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:32.320]  or Russia or an Iran and if we fight one it's very likely we'll have to fight
[3:44:32.320 --> 3:44:37.200]  them all because they'll all you know dogpile us at the same time this could
[3:44:37.200 --> 3:44:42.880]  come over Taiwan or any other you know flash points but our our enemies that
[3:44:42.880 --> 3:44:49.120]  have not lost their minds and sunk into this you know a level of insanity in
[3:44:49.120 --> 3:44:53.880]  the military are watching us and saying when will we ever have another
[3:44:53.880 --> 3:45:00.720]  opportunity America has a has a a vacuum tube for a president you know an empty
[3:45:00.720 --> 3:45:05.840]  vessel a senile fool who just signs anything they put in front of him they
[3:45:05.840 --> 3:45:11.840]  have a retired general who is standing down their military to root out white
