[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  It's the World Wrestling Federation. It's the Washington Wrestling Federation.
[00:12.000 --> 00:19.000]  They put on this show that they're bitter rivalries, you know, villains, and they really don't like each other.
[00:19.000 --> 00:23.000]  But behind closed doors, they buddy up for a drink and make deals.
[00:23.000 --> 00:30.000]  Both the Republican and Democratic parties are owned by the same global elites.
[00:30.000 --> 00:37.000]  And on issues that matter to those global elites, they act as one.
[00:37.000 --> 00:44.000]  They've wrapped themselves in the American flag and they've talked about preserving American heritage and principles.
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  And all the while, they're working to merge us into a new world order where our sovereignty will be destroyed,
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  and we'll lose all connection with our American heritage.
[00:55.000 --> 00:58.000]  With Bush, you knew exactly what you were getting.
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  There was no iron fist in a velvet glove. It was just the iron fist.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  Whereas with Obama, you've got the velvet glove and the iron fist.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  You know, a very sharp guy, very smooth, knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  For that reason, far more dangerous than Bush.
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  Well, at the end of last year, I was willing to give Obama the benefit of the doubt.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  I thought it was premature to write this guy off.
[01:24.000 --> 01:32.000]  But now that he's been in office for a while, it's obvious that he is very tight with the Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan's on Wall Street.
[01:32.000 --> 01:39.000]  And he is extremely compliant and pliant to the wishes of the large banks,
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  going back to what we saw with Robert Rubin under the Clinton administration,
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  changing laws in favor of the banks, and he's not doing anything to stop the banks.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  He's helping the banks continue to do what they were doing under Bush.
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.000]  So in fact, he's just a continuation of Bush on the subject of markets and finance,
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  which is the most important part of his policy right now.
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  People who voted for Obama wanted real change and are getting platitudes,
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  are getting a lot of nice talk, but nothing in the way of concrete change is taking place.
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  In this town, business as usual.
[02:12.000 --> 02:20.000]  There's one puppet master that controls the left, and the same puppet master controls the right.
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.000]  They control the Republican Party, and they control the Democratic Party.
[02:26.000 --> 02:33.000]  This is not a party issue. This is not a left-right issue.
[02:33.000 --> 02:40.000]  The question is, who should government serve? And it should serve the people.
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.000]  In fact, government is just a tool of government minority that uses economics and government law
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  to enforce upon the public various mandates.
[02:48.000 --> 02:56.000]  The right-left paradigm in the US, in US politics, is taken directly from the commercial world and the corporate world.
[02:56.000 --> 03:03.000]  In the business world, you have Coke Pepsi, you have McDonald's Burger King, you've got 1818 Verizon,
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  you've got Duopolis, and Duopoly gives the illusion of there being some competition and some choice.
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  And it looks a little bit better than a monopoly.
[03:13.000 --> 03:21.000]  So, for example, in communist Russia, if they had communist Russia red and communist Russia chartreuse,
[03:21.000 --> 03:27.000]  there would have been the illusion of choice and something akin to democracy in Russia.
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  But they simply said, forget it, we're just going to go with red.
[03:30.000 --> 03:40.000]  In the US, they have this left-right paradigm, which unfortunately it doesn't take them out of the hard-cold fact
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  that there is no choice, there's no social justice.
[03:42.000 --> 03:50.000]  There's only one choice, which is to supply more rent to the rent seekers who have now taken the whole system hostage.
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  We've seen the limitations on government whittled away.
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.000]  We have seen this erosion to the point where today seems like nobody does care.
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.000]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[04:05.000 --> 04:10.000]  If the United States doesn't have its Bill of Rights and Constitution, it doesn't exist anymore.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  It's just more real estate, more dirt.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  And that's what these global corporates want.
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.000]  They want to completely dismantle the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and they're doing that right now.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  This is the fall of the Republic.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  Our nation is dying.
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.000]  We, the people that live in this fine country, need to stand up, get involved, and take the system back.
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  It's the Bill of Rights and Constitution that we owe allegiance to, not to a political party,
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  and not to politicians that wrap themselves in the red, white, and blue,
[04:41.000 --> 04:58.000]  while at the same time they destroy everything that that sacred flag stands for.
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  But for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver,
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  They both make fabulous investments.
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[05:48.000 --> 05:54.000]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[05:54.000 --> 06:10.000]  That's eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[06:24.000 --> 06:34.000]  We're very excited to have him here with us today from his Lake Jackson office.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  Congressman, happy new year to you.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  Thank you. Same to you.
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  There's so much to talk about here.
[06:41.000 --> 06:47.000]  Out of the gates, you're now the chairman of that banking subcommittee dealing with the Federal Reserve,
[06:47.000 --> 06:53.000]  and it couldn't be a more perfect time as the New York Times announces the federal government is preparing
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  to basically take the states in under receivership and their bankruptcy,
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  and as the Chinese openly say that it's time for the dollar to not be the World Reserve currency.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  Can you speak to your concerns?
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  A few years ago you said something big is about to happen.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  Are we now on the cusp of that?
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  We certainly are, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  Even though we had this major crisis starting in 0708, I thought that was just the beginning
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  because the real crisis comes with the dollar, with people losing confidence in the dollar.
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.000]  The dollar doesn't deserve confidence that it has,
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  but you can put confidence in something that isn't real if you're deceived,
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  and people are deceived that we are very wealthy and we have a great military,
[07:35.000 --> 07:40.000]  and therefore we can trust the United States because of our past performances.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  But eventually that is eroded and people will reject it,
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.000]  and I think we're witnessing that with the Chinese.
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.000]  Sadly, I guess, in a way they have become more capitalistic than ours.
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  I don't care about them becoming more capitalistic,
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  but I don't like the idea that we become more militaristic and more socialistic.
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  That's what's so bad.
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  They have their problems in China, but just think of what they've done.
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  They produce and they save money.
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  They take the money and they buy up resources around the world.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  They buy gold. They're a wealthy country.
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  They loan us all this money. They're in the driver's seat.
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  Don't you think that if you or I or any American was involved in that,
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  we wouldn't be wanting to just be taking paper money that they know is going to depreciate.
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  There would be a limit, and I think we're at that point,
[08:27.000 --> 08:33.000]  and when that happens, that will be a major event when the world rejects the dollar.
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  So when it comes and how it comes and how quickly it comes, those are still unknowns,
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  but it will come and I think we're starting to see it happen right now.
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  Absolutely. Congressman, as a doctor, as a congressperson,
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  as someone who's been on the banking committees for many years
[08:49.000 --> 08:55.000]  and studied Austrian economics, for those that don't know,
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  comparing our situation to the Weimar Republic, I see a lot of similarities.
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.000]  We're already seeing inflation in commodities and inflation in food.
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  What is the basic timeframe that you see currently?
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  And for those that don't know, what does dollar devaluation
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  and the dollar losing World Reserve currency status mean for people?
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  Well, it means higher prices and eventually higher interest rates,
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.000]  which means higher prices again.
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  But the government always reports statistics that are deceiving,
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.000]  and they tell us that inflation is like one and a half, two percent.
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  And yet if you talk to the average person and they know that prices are going up
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  and you're right about the commodities, there was a report yesterday,
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  I think it was the S&P commodity index for last year, a whole group of commodities.
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  It was at 24 percent. That's huge.
[09:46.000 --> 09:53.000]  And you can't have that and not have that translate into day-to-day living.
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  People know this, the energy prices are going to go up
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  and it wouldn't take much to push that oil up over $100.
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.000]  It's bouncing around there already, which means the standard of living goes down.
[10:05.000 --> 10:11.000]  If an individual borrows and they get into debt but they live high on the hog
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  and they buy more cars than they need and have a fancy house
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.000]  and their job is just marginal, but if they lose their job or prices go up,
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  they get wiped out.
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  In order to get back on their feet again, they have to work harder and spend less.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  It's a little different with a country because they have this printing press
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  where they're able to tax people, but there is a limit.
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  But the economic law is the same for the country as it is for the individual.
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  The country eventually has to live beneath its means and that's what we're witnessing now.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  And it usually hits some people more than others.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  So the middle class and the poor get hit the first.
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.000]  They lose their jobs and they're hurt the most through the inflation.
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  The very wealthy actually, there's a transfer of wealth.
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  This has been argued by Austrian economists for decades
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  that when you destroy a currency, it erodes the value of the currency,
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  but the middle class suffer the most and the wealth is accumulated by the very rich.
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  We're seeing that and what does it do?
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  It drives up resentment.
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  If they don't fully understand this, the middle class is getting wiped out.
[11:15.000 --> 11:20.000]  They only have anger and they might strike out everybody who has wealth
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  rather than the wealth that has been accumulated because of the government programs.
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.000]  And the social engineers, as you know, Dr. Paul Congressman,
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  they're fully aware of that, the pressure from above and below.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  And so right when they got rid of the glass steel 11 years ago,
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  we start seeing ran corporation reports.
[11:38.000 --> 11:44.000]  We start seeing Department of Defense reports saying we've got to basically set up a police state
[11:44.000 --> 11:51.000]  because there's a danger of social unrest coming because of the dwindling middle class.
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  And now we see a British Ministry of Defense report saying the same thing in 2007.
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  And lo and behold, now Homeland Security is putting in 9,000 locations,
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  telescreens saying watch your neighbors.
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  Three new videos were released yesterday in frightening videos by Homeland Security airing on TV.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  They're up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com if listeners want to see it
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  or if the congressman hasn't seen it.
[12:15.000 --> 12:21.000]  And it's got people in shopping malls and on the streets, and it shows DHS, TSA on the streets,
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  searching people, and it says we're going to protect you, but we need you to watch your neighbors.
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  I mean, clearly they're trying to bring in an authoritarian system,
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.000]  not for Al Qaeda or these overseas reported threats,
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  but they're now shifting it over to domestic groups.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  And we saw that attempt to attack conservatives and libertarians and yourself and myself
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  and even Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh and talk radio in the First Amendment after the tragic shooting.
[12:48.000 --> 12:55.000]  So can you speak to that, sir, and this conscious movement towards authoritarianism?
[12:55.000 --> 13:03.000]  Well, there's no doubt about it, and you're absolutely right about the disruption that comes to the communities
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  because it is there.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  Most major changes occur domestically.
[13:09.000 --> 13:16.000]  We take an oath of office to obey the constitution and defend it against enemies, foreign and domestic.
[13:16.000 --> 13:22.000]  Well, I usually make that point, and even in the very, very patriotic crowds and veterans,
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.000]  which you think would be more hawkish, if you emphasize the domestic threat, they understand this.
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.000]  But I think we're actually winning this argument about this need for militarism around the world
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.000]  to protect ourselves and that we have to worry about domestically
[13:39.000 --> 13:45.000]  because people are getting tired of having somebody from the government check every single thing.
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.000]  You know, back again to China, you can start businesses easier in China than here.
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.000]  So people who have land, people who want to start a business,
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  people who have to pay these high taxes and pay for all these regulations,
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  they're starting to realize this.
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  So I think there's a healthy resistance developing,
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  but like you pointed out, there is some danger here, and that is, of course,
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000]  if we get people to understand where the cause comes from, that we might be able to prevent this.
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  See, the one thing, the one coalition that we should build,
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.000]  we talk a lot about the poor getting poorer and the middle class being wiped out,
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.000]  but the left always think, well, the answer to that is just more transfer of wealth.
[14:35.000 --> 14:42.000]  But we have to get them to understand that the reason this happens is because the government is too big,
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  even though they argue for government programs, the government is too big,
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  they argue for these programs and get who lost their homes, the rich got richer
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.000]  and the poor people lost their homes because of this program.
[14:54.000 --> 15:01.000]  But the other big issue is to make sure that people know that, you know,
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  corporatism is not free market economics, and that's a misunderstanding.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  Well, that was my other point, and I'm glad you got into that,
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  because we're of the same mind because we've studied history,
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  but quantify that for listeners who may be new.
[15:15.000 --> 15:21.000]  The ultra-robber baron, non-free market crony capitalist always, as Carol quickly said at Georgetown,
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  the Clinton's mentor, lobby for authoritarianism,
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  whether it's right-wing, left-wing, fascist, socialist, communist,
[15:27.000 --> 15:33.000]  because they create this big pool of collectivized wealth and they take it offshore,
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  and now the ultra-rich are trying to sell the poor people who are losing their jobs
[15:37.000 --> 15:42.000]  on higher taxes and looting their neighbor who's got more money than them,
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  selling them the lie that that's going to give them a good economy
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  when it's freedom that's going to give them a future.
[16:17.000 --> 16:22.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  now being expanded nationwide.
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  an old powerful shadow state.

[16:38.000 --> 16:41.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  The police state isn't coming.

[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.

[19:58.000 --> 20:24.000]  Thank you.
[20:24.000 --> 20:28.000]  Congressman, we're seeing riots all over the world over global inflation
[20:28.000 --> 20:31.000]  driven by the devaluation of the dollar and other fiat currencies.
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  You've been mentioning unrest here
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  and clearly we're seeing more and more signs of that here.
[20:38.000 --> 20:44.000]  I remember you back in Austin giving a speech that I attended seven years ago.
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  We were talking about it during the break when you first got on
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.000]  and you warned that when the empire starts collapsing, there's two ways to go.
[20:51.000 --> 20:54.000]  You can either recognize that big government breeds corruption
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  and go the opposite direction towards liberty,
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  but then more often than not, instead the government's going to sell
[20:59.000 --> 21:02.000]  even more of the same as the solution.
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.000]  So now is the time to get this out to people.
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  I mean this is a life and death situation for our republic, is it not?
[21:10.000 --> 21:16.000]  Yes, and it's hard teaching people some of these lessons in the midst of a crisis
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  because then, and you can understand the emotions,
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.000]  you know, when law and order breaks down,
[21:22.000 --> 21:26.000]  most people say, well, just quit the killing, calm down things.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  You better bring more police in.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  And that's, you know, a pretty natural response,
[21:30.000 --> 21:34.000]  but not realizing that we have had too many policemen already
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  and too many bureaucrats and too much federal government,
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  too much taxes and all that.
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  So it, to me, the earlier the education occurs,
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  the better I think people have to know and understand why it's in their best interest
[21:47.000 --> 21:51.000]  that the free market works better.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  People think that you have to sacrifice and all this,
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  and I don't think you have to sacrifice a thing.
[21:55.000 --> 21:56.000]  Freedom, freedom.
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  If you get your freedom, you don't have to sacrifice anything
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  because you have your incentives,
[22:02.000 --> 22:05.000]  you can take care of yourself a lot better than the government,
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  and that's a system that has worked,
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  and unfortunately we're about to give it up,
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.000]  and that's why I fear the day when law and order breaks down,
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  but people are questioning whether there'll be riots in our streets
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  like there've been overseas already,
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  and I suspect that the American people are like other people,
[22:21.000 --> 22:27.000]  and even in the 60s we had our riots and our shares of problems here.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  So people will act in a violent manner,
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  and that's up for grabs, and, you know,
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  all factions then will be looking to get the powers
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  and the strings of government,
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.000]  so we have a big job ahead of us.
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  So we're going into some very stormy waters.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  No doubt it's coming.
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  Congressman, no doubt you've probably heard about it or seen it,
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  but CNN, MSNBC, Democracy Now,
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  they all singled you and I out specifically
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.000]  and played clips of you speaking in your Texas Straight Talk
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.000]  and clips of my radio slash TV show
[23:06.000 --> 23:09.000]  where we talked about the Second Amendment being there,
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  and it's in the Declaration of Independence,
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  it's in the Bill of Rights to defend against crime on the streets,
[23:16.000 --> 23:19.000]  but also against a tyrannical government,
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  and they have tried to now demonize and imply
[23:23.000 --> 23:27.000]  that you and I and others are the progenitors
[23:27.000 --> 23:32.000]  in an asinine way of what happened in Tucson,
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  which we now know was a schizophrenic who was politically a liberal,
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  I'm not blaming the Democrats,
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  but what do you think about the desperation?
[23:39.000 --> 23:44.000]  Well, Rachel Maddow and others go after your son
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  and tell a laundry list of Dr. Rand Paul,
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  and of course that backfired on him,
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  only seemed to boost his approval rating
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  when Clinton went and campaigned against him.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  Now we see them doing it against you and I
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.000]  because they see us as a threat because we're getting the truth out.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  What is your view on A,
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  the ratcheting up of their rhetoric?
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.000]  Congressman Steve Cohen calling Republicans Nazis a few days ago,
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  and the fact that it's backfiring in every case
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  from the polls we're seeing.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  Well, there's a limit, and as something for the American people,
[24:14.000 --> 24:17.000]  maybe they won't buy into that,
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  but they're certainly going to make any effort.
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  And this is a frustration for me
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  because I do make a diligent effort to try to work with
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  honest, straightforward people
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  who may be called to progressives and liberals
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  because some of them are decent and they're honest,
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  but they're not these demagogues,
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  and those people who turn on you,
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.000]  their goal is more like
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  the promotion of the Democrat Party
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.000]  or promoting of government power.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  So they might say they agree with us on a couple issues,
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  but I sort them out,
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  and some of them, the ones that you're talking about
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  are just the demagogues who may say one thing
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  and say, oh yeah, we don't like this, we don't like that,
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  but then they'll turn on you
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  and they'll do anything to maintain their power
[25:06.000 --> 25:09.000]  or to discredit us for what we're doing.
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  Well, and it's also hypocritical.
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  They're demonizing the First Amendment
[25:13.000 --> 25:16.000]  and talking about fairness doctrine for talk radio, FCC,
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  jurisdiction over the Internet.
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  This is all being announced.
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  While Matthews is calling white people crackers,
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  Matt Owl is implying that we're causing violence,
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  the congressman's calling Republicans Nazis.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  I mean, it's just incredible
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  how they're trying to balkanize
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  and turn the American people against each other.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  When you look at the polls, liberals, conservatives, libertarians,
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.000]  almost everybody's against the banker bailouts, the wars.
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  I mean, the momentum is shifting towards freedom.
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.000]  No doubt about that, but there's still a lot of people,
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  and I think that you can say at the grassroots level
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  that is the case. Our problem has been, you know,
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  it's taking a long time to build the bureaucracy
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  and when you think of these millions of people
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  who are living off the government
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  and work for the government and they work in Washington,
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  they're embedded into the political system
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  and so many in Congress,
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.000]  they have all clung to these views that they've held before,
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.000]  but the American people, you know, are further ahead.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  I think the people are always ahead of the politicians
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.000]  and hopefully we'll win out on this fight,
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  but unfortunately, the opposition has a lot of guns.
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  It's interesting how they want to take our guns away,
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  but everything the government does depends on a gun.
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  It's all about it.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  It's their guns against the guns of the civilians,
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  but you know, whether it's tax collection
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  or telling you whether you can dig a ditch on your land
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  and how you can use your land,
[26:50.000 --> 26:56.000]  you may, you know, be costed by a federal agent with a gun.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  Everything they do has to be, you know,
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  enforced with a gun.
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  It's a threat.
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  They never talk about that kind of gun violence.
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  How often have they been barging into houses,
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  into the wrong houses with guns blaring
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  and blowing up the places and looking for drugs
[27:14.000 --> 27:17.000]  that didn't exist and not even apologize
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  and never compensate these people
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  and sometimes hurt and kill some of these people,
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  innocent people, and that's the kind of gun violence
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  that ought to be, you know, rejected.
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  Absolutely.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  Mao Zedong said political power goes out of the barrel of a gun.
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  Well, we're the people and that's our check and balance.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  Congressman, in the eight minutes we've got left with you,
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.000]  we have a prisonplanet.com, infowars.com headline.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  Congressman, Senator or President, as you know,
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  a lot of big scientific polls, the Hill newspaper,
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  the Democratic affiliate, public policy polling,
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  and others are finding that you're in the number one
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  or number two seat to win the Texas Senate race
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  for U.S. Senate if you so choose.
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.000]  Well, unfortunately, I'm still very ambivalent about all this.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  I usually am not ambivalent on my views
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  and what I do and what my plans are,
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  but it does require a major decision,
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.000]  a personal decision, a family decision, a political decision,
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.000]  all of these things.
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  So I am, I'm pretty undecided on what to do
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  and I think it through, people keep asking me,
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  do you think about doing this or that?
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  I admit it, I do, I think about it all the time,
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  not only because I wonder what I'm going to do
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  the rest of my life, but I often think about it
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.000]  because when I get on the radio talk show,
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  they ask me these kind of questions.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  But I'm still pretty undecided on what I should do
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.000]  and what I can do and what I'll end up doing.
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  in the last century alone.
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[29:11.000 --> 29:14.000]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.000]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  and they really are calling the shots.
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  as American citizens to pay attention.
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.000]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[29:29.000 --> 29:33.000]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  They're asking for more matches
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  And right now in Washington, D.C.

[32:58.000 --> 33:27.000]  Thank you.
[33:28.000 --> 33:33.000]  All right ladies and gentlemen
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.000]  he is the number one overnight talk show host in the world.
[33:37.000 --> 33:40.000]  He is the second largest talk show host on the planet
[33:40.000 --> 33:43.000]  but he is the number one overnight in the world
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  number two worldwide behind Rush Limbaugh
[33:45.000 --> 33:49.000]  a close second and you know in the age of
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.000]  Anderson Cooper with a million viewers
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  and Glenn Beck you know with three million on Fox
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.000]  it's amazing when you talk about media
[33:57.000 --> 34:00.000]  the only media on this planet
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  of the thousands and thousands of choices
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  on broadcast and mainline media
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.000]  and alternative included the only audiences
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  that are still mega huge
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  and actually reach giant numbers of people
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  are massive syndicated talk radio
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  and of course he's right up there at the top on internet as well
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.000]  and it's great to have somebody like George Norrie
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.000]  because I admire Art Bell incredibly well spoken
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  very intelligent I admire him as a broadcaster
[34:30.000 --> 34:33.000]  but when George Norrie took the show over seven eight years ago
[34:33.000 --> 34:37.000]  and took the show in a somewhat other direction
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.000]  started covering a lot of hardcore political issues
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  forced inoculations the private Federal Reserve
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.000]  the Bilderberg group Bohemian Grove
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  George Norrie pulls no punches
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  sensors no one and no one anywhere
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  in what can be called mainstream media
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.000]  of course he's that crossover he's both alternative
[34:57.000 --> 35:00.000]  and mainstream no one can hold a candle to George Norrie
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  and he's with us for the next 45 minutes
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  and we'll take calls for 15-20 minutes or so
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  into the next hour right now I've got George all to myself
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  the website's coast2coastam.com
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  that's coast2coastam.com
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  really probably no stranger to most of you out there
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  but if you're new listeners out there or haven't given it a listen
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  it's on 500 plus radio stations across the country
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  in fact George I know the show just keeps keeps keeps growing
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  even past what Art Bell did
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  how many stations are you on now George?
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  as of yesterday Alex my affiliates people sent me my monthly report
[35:35.000 --> 35:40.000]  we are now on 540 stations in North America
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.000]  which is an all-time high and as you were saying
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.000]  we're the second largest affiliated program in the country
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.000]  like a horse race we're coming around the stretch
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  and I think we're going to be number one
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  I really do I can feel it and I can see it
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  and that's our goal
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  so we've got a hard dedicated staff
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  and though we're going right after one of our own syndicated folks
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  I want to beat him and that's what we're going to do
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  hey well Rush is all about the free market of ideas
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  and so in fact I've even seen industry publications say
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  that if you continue to grow like this within six months to a year
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  you may eclipse Rush Limbaugh
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  that's right so we're keeping our fingers crossed
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.000]  and we'll see what happens and I'll tell you a funny story
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  years ago I was having lunch in Austin Texas
[36:28.000 --> 36:33.000]  and I found a black book a small black book
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  I opened it up and it was the Alex Jones playbook
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  of how to do a successful show
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  and it said cover the Federal Reserve cover inoculations
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  so I took it and I changed the format
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  did you really find a black book?
[36:49.000 --> 36:50.000]  I'm kidding
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  it's a metaphor yeah
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  oh man you are something else
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  well look we have talked a lot about globalist forces
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  the big mega Davos George Soros type folks
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  who you know we think of it as America versus the Middle East
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  or America versus Russia no
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  these globalists want turmoil they want the strategy of tension
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  you've talked so much about that
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  and now we see what's happening in the Middle East
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  the Muslim Brotherhood
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  openly being funded by our own government
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  openly calling for an end of the peace treaty with Israel
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  that they take over Egypt
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  and the whole world is saying
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  why would our government overthrow their own puppet
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  they're not trying to bring in a democracy
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  which I wish they would or a free society
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  they're trying to bring in something
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.000]  in Saudi Arabia, in Jordan, in Yemen, in Egypt
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.000]  that is going to destabilize the entire region
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  what's your view on that?
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  well there's something very strange going on in the Middle East
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  Alex and as you know I am Middle Eastern
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  I'm a Christian Lebanese
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  my father was born in Cairo
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  my mother who is Christian Lebanese
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  was born in Boston, Massachusetts, Pittsburgh actually
[38:01.000 --> 38:06.000]  I know the Middle East probably better than most national radio talk shows
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  I was raised in that
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  I mean we eat the food
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  we know the culture
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  we eat broken Arabic
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  I mean I know the Middle East
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  and there's a situation out there
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  that is very scary right now
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  and that is
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  you just don't know who the players are
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  and by that I mean
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  governments have propped up
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  dictatorship regimes for years
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  we did it with Saddam Hussein
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  we've done it with Mubarak
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  and the people of these countries at this point
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  are fed up with it
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  whether they hate America or not
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  and that we can talk about in a moment
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  they are fed up with the dictators
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  controlling their destiny
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  the unemployment rate in Egypt
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  is absolutely ridiculous
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  those people of young age
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.000]  the unemployment rate has got to be over 40 to 50%
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  people are existing on a few dollars a day
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  and they're at a point where they said enough is enough
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.000]  now the problem with all this is
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  is you just don't know
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  who's instigating how it started
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  I mean we saw what happened in Tunisia weeks ago
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.000]  and now all of a sudden it's filtered into Yemen
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  it's filtered into Egypt
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  and you don't know if the globalists are behind it
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  or not and it's very frustrating
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  I think what happened is Mubarak had to go
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  he's been in power for 30 years
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  and governments probably said
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  enough of this guy, let's get something fresh in here
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.000]  but the population of those countries
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  took things into their own hands
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  through the power of the internet
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  through the power of Facebook
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  through the power of Twitter
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  something they've never anticipated before
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  and these people have organized
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  their own peaceful protests
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  now just yesterday
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  we saw what happened in Cairo
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  with Mubarak supporters
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  henchmen who started causing problems
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  shooting and everything else
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  now the place is in chaos
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  I think Egypt's going to collapse
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  and I don't know what direction
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  honestly it's going to go
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  Well George, I'm going to put a headline up on the TV screen
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  for PrismPlanet.tv viewers
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  but for listeners, the London Telegraph
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  the Associated Press, they all reported
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  US government, here's the headline
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  Egypt protest, America's secret backing
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  for rebel leaders
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  behind uprising and now it's confirmed
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  they met a year ago, six months ago
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  and again, three weeks ago
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  with the Muslim Brotherhood
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  who are openly now saying
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  they're going to overthrow all of the regimes
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  including the Jordanians
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  the Saudi leadership
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  who I'm no fan of any of them
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  I'm having a big critic of Haas-e-Mubarak
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  and the black sites and the torture sites
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  and the ghost sites
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  but at the same time
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  then you see them maneuvering the Muslim Brotherhood
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  and this Elberide
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  who's this big UN chief
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  who's a globalist
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  and our government says, oh we don't really want freedom there
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  we just want something new
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  and then now know this group that George Soros
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  funds, the crisis group
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  is involved
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  and then suddenly they're announcing
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  we're going to take over and we're going to break our peace treaty
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  with Israel and Israel's freaking out
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  I mean, that looks like
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  the ordered out of chaos card
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  here's the headline today, Muslim Brotherhood
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  wants into Egypt
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  Israeli peace deal
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  this is some scary stuff
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  but we know the globalists again
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  want to play countries off against each other
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  there's no question about it
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  my father when I was growing up as a boy
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  Detroit, Michigan
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  was a member of an organization called the Mardin Club
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  now Mardin was in Turkey
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  we had a lot of relatives who were also born out there
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  we're not Turkish
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  but that's where they were
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  and in Detroit they had this building
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  they had a club that was called the Mardin Club
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  and I would go with them
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  when they would get together on Friday nights
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  or Saturday nights
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  and this is what they did
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  they ate Middle Eastern food
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  they played Middle Eastern music
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  they played, well I thought it was
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  Domino's but it was a different kind of game
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  and it just had a great time
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  there was nothing clandestine
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  they never talked about overthrowing governments
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  they loved America, they were immigrants
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  who came here legally
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  something strange about the Muslim Brotherhood
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  it was formed in Egypt a long time ago
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  as a peaceful organization
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  to promote Islam
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  that's what they wanted to do
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  that's what their intent was
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  along the lines
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  some people infiltrated that organization
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  and started spouting
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  the hatred that we see today
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  British intelligence, that's on record
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  they wanted to destabilize
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  Osama bin Laden
[42:48.000 --> 43:00.000]  was basically part of that organization
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  you've heard Alex explain
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  how the Silver Lungs Generator
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  infuses the respiratory system
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  with your self produced colloidal silver solutions
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  yet many are unaware of the entire function
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  of the Silver Lungs system
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  anywhere in or on the body
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  my name is Mario Safaldi
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  not only does the Silver Lungs system produce
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.000]  endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  it also comes equipped with the proper
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  applicators and devices needed
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  to deliver your silver solutions
[43:32.000 --> 43:34.000]  directly to key target areas
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  this includes the eyes, ears
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  nose, lungs
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  topically to the skin
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  and orally for the digestive system
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  be sure to watch our new 7 minute
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  video tour of the Silver Lungs system

[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  to learn more about

[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  this is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  you should consider buying a solar power generator
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  number 1
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  your electric bill
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  number 2
[44:12.000 --> 44:14.000]  how much power your electric company
[44:14.000 --> 44:15.000]  allows you to have
[44:15.000 --> 44:16.000]  it's true
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  total government control of electricity
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  in the name of smart grid technology
[44:20.000 --> 44:21.000]  is coming
[44:21.000 --> 44:22.000]  number 3
[44:22.000 --> 44:23.000]  in some areas of the country
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  and now new socialist legislation
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  is only compounding the problem
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.000]  number 4
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  every year thousands of families
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  lose their power from weather related onages
[44:36.000 --> 44:37.000]  number 5
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  a solar power generator provides powerful
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  backup insurance and peace of mind
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  offered by solutions from science
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  one of my oldest sponsors

[45:54.000 --> 46:00.000]  and you go to gusset.com forward slash america today
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  alex told you the government announced recently
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  that the recession is over
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  and it ended on june of 2009
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  the millions of americans unable to find work
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  might not agree
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  perhaps the recession ended for the bankers
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  and government employees but for the rest of us
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  things seemed to be getting worse
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  gold and silver haven't heard the news either
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.000]  they've begun their long expected journey to the moon
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  in addition to converting your shrinking dollars
[46:23.000 --> 46:24.000]  into gold and silver
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  you should consider a food savings account

[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  they both make fabulous investments
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  food is our greatest dependency
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  more precious than any financial resource
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.000]  you and your family need food to survive a crisis
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.000]  and you can't eat paper stocks or metals
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  alex has been urging you to invest in delicious

[47:02.000 --> 47:05.000]  coast to coast direct from austin
[47:05.000 --> 47:09.000]  you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network
[47:09.000 --> 47:11.000]  network
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  we now take you live
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  to the central texas command center
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  in the heart of the resistance
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  we are listening to the alex jones show
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  we don't know who to believe anymore
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  we know a couple things that are true
[47:31.000 --> 47:32.000]  and that is
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.000]  the globalists want to control this planet
[47:35.000 --> 47:38.000]  the globalists will do whatever they have to do
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  in order to disrupt all of us
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.000]  i am so convinced at this point
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.000]  that if every person who hated america
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  for whatever reason said
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.000]  you know what, we want peace, let's make this work
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  we're done with violence
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.000]  i'm convinced the globalists would do things
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  and blame it on those people again
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  so you don't know who to believe anymore
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  and i am deathly afraid
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  that this planet is heading toward
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  some kind of massive destruction
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  in terms of political leanings
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  that there may be nothing we can do
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  except to continue to fight on the air
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  and do what we're doing
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.000]  i find it amazing that you and i continue to talk
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  without anybody clipping the wires
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  well that was the next issue i was going to raise
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  i want to get back into geopolitically what's happening
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  with the dollar devaluation
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  now putting incredible pressure on countries
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  like egypt where right at half the population
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  is on two dollars a day
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  the imf world bank pressuring them to cut
[48:43.000 --> 48:44.000]  the food allotment
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  43 million americans now on food stamps
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  so the big central banks, the globalists
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  trigger a political atmosphere
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  that they know is going to cause upheaval
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  in the middle east and north africa
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  then they roll in with the quote revolutionaries
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  knowing that revolution was already coming
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  so they're going to use it to put in a new system
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  and then it looks like it's going to be a system
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  that wants to have war with israel
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  so it's proof right there
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  that this unseen hand is now coming out in the open
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  but i want to get more into that with you george in a moment
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  first you brought up censorship
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  we have the FCC announcing
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  that they want to run the internet and control it
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  we've got all these diversities at the FCC
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  saying they want to restrict free speech
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  we have MSNBC now saying the tea party
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  is like the quote muslim brotherhood
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  and radical and dangerous
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  that came out last night with chris matthews
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  we have the white house
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.000]  regulations are calling to restrict free speech
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  we have the internet kill switch being announced
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  similar to what we just saw in egypt
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  we're now really starting to see a move
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  where don't talk about political stuff
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  or you could cause another tusan shooting
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  when we know the guy was drugged out of his mind
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  and had nothing to do with politics
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  we're finally not just seeing an attack
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  on the second amendment
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  we're seeing open trial balloons to go after the first
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  as we go into this global depression
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  george norrie what's your view on that
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  well first of all i can't believe
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  but i had an email after the tusan tragedy
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  when i called that shooter on the air
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  a whacked out lunatic
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  and the next day
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  i got an email from a woman who said
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  how can you do that to him
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  he's got rights too
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  and i went man these people just don't understand
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  they just don't understand
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  there's something
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  when i was in school i was told
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  two things one is
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  the airwaves belong to the public
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  the public's interests
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  convenience and necessity
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  they're not owned by me
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  they're not owned by corporations
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.000]  the public owns those airwaves
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  we were under the fairness doctrine
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  when i was in broadcasting in 1971
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  that's a long time ago
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  it didn't bother me
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  i mean i think broadcasters
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  have a responsibility alex
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  to balance their shows
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  i think if you
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  or if i say something
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  about someone or someone
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  we should back it up with facts
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  and also give them the opportunity
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  or someone
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  to explain how they feel
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  there's nothing wrong with that
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  but what's happened today
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  is everybody's gone in
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  these different tangents
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  these different directions
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  and they forgot about the most important thing
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  that has kept american broadcasting
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  so strong
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  and that is balance
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  and we just don't have that anymore
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  when i started tweaking coast to coast
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  eight years ago
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  i did it for one main reason
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  this planet was changing
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  and changing very fast
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  and it needed voices
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  and it needed truth
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  we still do as you well know
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  the ghosts, the UFOs
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  the bigfoots, the mysteries
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  we do all that stuff, i love that
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  but we had to add the other ingredient
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  and specifically after 9-11 occurred
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  regardless
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  of how you believe it happened
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  or who did it
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  we needed to tweak this program
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  and i did that
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  and so i devote the first hour
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  to hard news
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  breaking issues with a coast to coast
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  alex jones type flair
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  to it, i don't want to do what mainstream does
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  and i don't want to
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  by the time i'm on the air
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  that stuff's been beaten like a horse
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  and i don't want to go in that direction
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  but we will cover those topics
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  i think
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  governments are taking a very close look
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  at all kinds of things right now
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  including a kill switch
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  for the internet as they saw what happened in Egypt
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  and i think these are very
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  dangerous, very dangerous
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  times for us
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  well sure, i agree with you but you talk about imbalance
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  when we have JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  knowingly creating trillions in derivatives
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  knowing its worth was selling it to people
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  personally
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  i'm helping my three children
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  with their mortgages and their car payments
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  because they're my kids
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  i can't see them
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  tossed out
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  they've got some problems
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  financially as most Americans do right now
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  i have had friends call me
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  asking for
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  a thousand dollars or two thousand dollars
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  that they say i want to borrow
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  now you know when you lend money to a friend
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  you're not getting it back, it's gone
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  and so you do it
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  but i've never seen a situation
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  where people were so backed up
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  and it's not like
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  they're going to bars every night
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  and going out to party with them
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  and the media is telling us everything's great though
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  yeah absolutely
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  this is what's happening
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  those of us who are working
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  you and me and other people
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  are doing okay
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  we're paying our bills
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  we're buying things once in a while
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  we're keeping the economy going
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  the automobile sales in the US
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  people who are working
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  are spending their money
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  and they're doing okay
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  but the number of people
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  who aren't working
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  and who aren't okay
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  continues to grow dramatically
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  so much of what he's been talking about
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  for decades on radio
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  what i've been talking about for 16 years
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  is now unfortunately unfolding
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  and so the credibility of people that cover
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  these type of subjects is really going up
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  but before we get into that
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  and then come back and take calls George
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  for 15-20 minutes of the next hour
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  tell us about your books
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  tell us about your radio show
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  tell us about coast-to-coast AM
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  for folks that may not routinely tune in
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  because they've got to work during the day
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  they can always subscribe to Streamlink
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  and listen whenever they want like I do on my iPhone
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  oh we love Streamlink
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  it only costs
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  25 cents a day
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  but they can get downloads
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  podcasting and it's really an exciting
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  fast of the listening to the program
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  along with the terrestrial radio station
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  which has really been the staple
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  of coast-to-coast over all these years
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  it continues to grow Alex
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  just yesterday I signed
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  an extension taking me through
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  2013 and the network
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  at the same time said hey sometime this year
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  let's talk about a five-year extension
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  beyond that
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  so you know I'm going to end up being
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  the casey case of a radio
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  I'm going to just hang in there as long as I can
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  bringing everybody the truth
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  we've got a couple books out
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  my partner for writing Bill Burns
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  who does an incredible job
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  doing 98%
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  of the late work for these things
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  worker in the light
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  and journey to the light
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  the worker of course being the first one in journey
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  even I've got another one coming out in the fall
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  with Rosemary Ellen Diley
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  called Talking to the Dead
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  which is more like the old traditional
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  coast-to-coast show but
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  I've got a two-fold goal
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  and that is one stay healthy
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  because I had a lot of problems
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  you know ten years ago
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  and I didn't eat right and I did stupid stuff
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  and I decided you know what
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  enough is this and I got into
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  a major workout regimen
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  and eating properly and taking
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  natural supplements
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  I hope to God we continue
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  to take natural supplements
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  but that's the direction I'm going to
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  Oh yeah you're in great shape
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  depending on that George
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  you also have done quite a few national TV shows
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  on sci-fi channel
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  and others I mean you're doing a lot
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  yeah I am Henry Winkler
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  the font approached us
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  a couple months ago
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  and he would like to do a
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  Twilight Zone type show
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  and said look I want you to be Rob Sterling
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  so let's see what he works on
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  but the bottom line here is
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  I want this program
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  to succeed I want you to
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  succeed for people
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  I'm going to tell you a funny story
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  as you know I go back and forth between
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  St. Louis and Los Angeles
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  you know my family is in St. Louis
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  so I have a chance to go see my kids
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  my soon to be six God children
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  and we just built
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  this little facility in Hawaii by the way
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  and I can pop up there
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  and do a show out of there too
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  it gives us that flavor way out there
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  but I'm at my favorite restaurant
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  in St. Louis called the Cafe Napoli
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  and I'm sitting there
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  I sit at the corner
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  and a guy comes in and he's staring at me
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  and I'm like oh boy here we go
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  and a young guy
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  he's next to Cory and he comes up to me
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  and he goes oh my god it's you
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  and I said
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  I figure oh I'll sign the autograph
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  I always do that so if they want a picture
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  I'll do that you know it's for you
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  I don't charge for that stuff
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  I'm not like some of the baseball players
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  and he comes up to me and he goes oh my god it's you
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  and I said yeah I put up my hand and he went
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  oh hey love Alex Jones
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  hahahaha
[57:46.000 --> 58:14.000]  If I want to pay for it
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  This documentary exposes
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  how the continuity of government program
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  has established an old powerful shadow state
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  Police State 4 chronicles
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  Prepare to enter
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  the secret of world of emergency
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  dictatorship
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  stage terror and cameras
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  on every street corner
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  The police state isn't coming

[59:48.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  Thank you!
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  I know George a lot
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  because I really want to reach people
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  I want to warn folks about corrupt things that are happening
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  I get angry about being oppressed
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  and he's the biggest outlet
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  to ever just give me free reign
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  and to reach 16 million people
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  a night and I've been on the show probably
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  60-70 times I haven't counted
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  in the last seven and a half years
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  and he took a risk putting Alex Jones on him
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  and we were growing exponentially way back then
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  but now it just
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  supercharged us like nitrous oxide
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  on a drag racer
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  and I just want to thank you again George
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  for helping me get the word out
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  Well Alex you earned
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  your way on the coast to coast
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  when I started doing the program
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  I didn't know who you were
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  you know I was in the paranormal
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  the unusual and I kept getting emails
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  from people saying you ought to put
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  talk show host Alex Jones on it
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  well at that point brand new
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  just replaced Art Bell
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  was the competitive here doing what I'm doing
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  I don't want to promote another talk show host
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  but I started getting
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  more and more and more of these emails
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  and I said you know what I better start listening
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  to this guy so I googled you
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  opcameprisonplanet.com
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  infowars.com I started listening
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  to some of the things you did
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  and I said I like this guy
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  and I said you know he's like a little brother to me
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  and I said you know
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  the things he says
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  are right on
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  and then you and I had that first program
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  exploded our phone lines
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  and that's been our relationship
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  ever ever since other than when you
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  pushed me into a lake in Austin, Texas
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  hey you got to stop with that joke
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  I had people come up to me on the street and go
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  why'd you push George Norrie into the pond
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  and I'm like I did
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  I don't know I think if you just go into
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  the search on YouTube and go Norrie falls
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  you'll see a
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  seven second clip
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  coming out of the radio station
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  KLBJ at night
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  Dan Heiser
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  and I hit what I thought
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  was a half inch puddle of water
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  they had the sprinklers going on all night
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  and I hit a half inch
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  pool of water
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  that ended up being two feet deep
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  and I went right down into it
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  and right on my face
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  and I had that big event as you know
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  the talk fest the next day
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  I didn't have any backup clothes
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  I was soaked to the gills
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  and Dan Heiser had to go out
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  buy me clothes
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  I'm in my hotel room
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  stark naked
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  waiting for him to get in there with new shoes
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  pants and a shirt
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  and down come the window washers
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  they come right down to my level
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  and I'm standing right in front of them
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  no clothes on and the guy just keeps cleaning
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  the window no big deal
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  well I just want to say we just played the video
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  and I am a good
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  eight feet from you and you fall down
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  it's Dan Heiser that's behind you
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  Harvey Oswald
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  sure you're eight feet away from me
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  listen we've only got one more segment
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  with you but it's a long segment 12 minutes or so
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  we're going to talk to Henry, Al, Bell, Noel
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  and Tony
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  quick questions or comments for George Orrin
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  we come back in this next segment
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  but what's coming up tonight
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  on Coast to Coast AM
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  what's coming up in the next few days
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  first hour we'll talk a little bit about Egypt
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  and some other mainstream issues
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  with that coast flavor
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  we're going to show a little more coasty tonight
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  as we talk with Dr. Richard Boylan
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  about what he believes to be
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  anti-UFO machines
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  that are flying around all over the planet
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  so we'll do that with him
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  and then Friday I always dedicated
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  some fun unusual things
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  we're going to be talking to the people from Ripley
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  believe it or not
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  and then we'll have open lines later on
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  in the program on Friday night out
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  we've only got about a minute but what did you think of
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  that strange
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  over the dome of the rock
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  and the reason?
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  Bizarre timing
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  things are happening, they're weird
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  now in this particular case
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  I don't know if it's a sign from above
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  or whether someone's got some drone
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  out there just checking things out
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  who knows
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  but I'm telling you we get some bizarre things
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  the strangest story of course is
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  the crop formation in Indonesia
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  Indonesia
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  the farmer said he was there
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  and there was nothing there
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  you can't make it that fast
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  even with 90 people
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  it makes no sense
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  yeah I think they're really gearing up for a fake type
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  UFO invasion
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  we know in a project Bluebeam that's there as well
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  and they've got this battle of Los Angeles coming out
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  I mean they're really pushing it
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  George Norrie is our guest
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  coast2coastam.com
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  our sites are infowars.com and prismwanda.com
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  we'll be right back after this quick break
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  with your phone calls
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  this is Alex Jones
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  with five good reasons you should consider
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  buying a solar power generator
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  number one new climate legislation
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  number two our new energies
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  are wants to control how much power
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  your electric company allows you to have
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  it's true total government control
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  technology is coming
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  number three in some areas of the country
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  and now new socialist legislation
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  is only compounding the problem
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  number four dangerous weather is always
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  a threat to local grids
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  every year thousands of families lose their power
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  from weather related onages
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  number five a solar power generator provides
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  folks I really believe in the solar powered
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  generators offered by solutions from science
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  one of my oldest sponsors
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  you can get more information at

[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  command center
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  and the heart of the resistance
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  rallying patriots
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  worldwide
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  you're listening
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000]  to the Alex Jones show
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  now
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  many have dubbed
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  the most controversial speaker on the planet
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  much of what he's talked about the last 20 years
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  is unfortunately come true
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  he deals with this false program
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  of matrix reality
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  of disinformation were fed
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  and his latest book is
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  human race get off your knees
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  the lion sleeps no more
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  www.davidike.com
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  and David
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  serious times coming
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  rebellion worldwide
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  but the globalists strangely admit that they're behind it
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  they know the rebellion was already coming
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  so they're trying to trigger it
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  so kind of like red a dare would blow up an oil well
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  once it was already on fire
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  to extinguish the flames of revolution
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  what does David Ike think is happening
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  well I think what we're seeing Alex
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  is a classic
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  reformation or confirmation
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  of something that anyone that wants to understand
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  what's going on in the world
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  must keep at the front of their mind
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  and that is no situation
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  he's ever black and white
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  it's always if you're looking for the real truth
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  it's a shade of gray
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  and that's what we're looking at here
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  we have understandably
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  I believe
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  a genuine
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  uprising
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  from angry
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  poverty-stricken
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  oppressed and suppressed people
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  but when people are in that situation
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  where as we talked about before
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  when you reach that point
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  where you've got nothing to lose
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  if you take certain action
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  then suddenly you lose your fear
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  because what have I got to lose
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  I'm in this situation anyway
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  now because of the massive economic
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  collapse
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  and catastrophe around the world
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  people in all parts of the world
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  not just the Middle East
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  are feeling that
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  and they're heading closer and closer
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  to that line that says
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  I've got nothing to lose let's go
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  now of course
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  the mind manipulators
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  because that's what it is in the end
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  of the psychological game
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  they knew that this was coming
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  and they have got to try to manage it
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  for their own ends
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  so here we have Alex
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  a genuine
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  reaction to this
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  30 years of
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  suppression and violence
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  and tyranny
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  by this US
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  and no doubt British too
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  they two go together
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  tyranny and dictator
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  Iraq who has served their interests
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  and served the interests of Israel
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  against the interests of the Palestinians
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  and that is a genuine
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  reaction no doubt
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  but you can see
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  that when you've got a powder keg
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  like that
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  of resentment
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  and oppression
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  that will not take it anymore
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  then it's very easy to trigger that
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  and then manipulate it
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  and that's why when the revolution truly
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  comes to America
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  and Britain as it will
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  then we involved in any of that
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  need to learn the lessons
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  and become street wise
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  about the way this thing works
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  because how many times
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  when you look at these
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  so called people's
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  revolutions not least in the form
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  of Soviet Union of Georgia
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  of Ukraine of the Czech Republic
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  of Kyrgyzstan
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  and so on
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  so called people's revolutions
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  as they call them
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  again and again it's been shown quite clearly
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  that
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  Rothschild connected people
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  like George Soros
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  and Sabigny Brzezinski
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  have been behind them
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  not least Soros' network of foundations
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  they're not there for philanthropy
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  they are there to manipulate
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  so called on the surface
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  people's revolutions
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  that are putting their people
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  in power and you cannot
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  ever judge
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  the true nature of a revolution
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  its motivation and its background
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  until we see what
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  has replaced the regime
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  the revolution has
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  removed
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  and when you look at Georgia
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  and Ukraine and all these places
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  where these Soros networks
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  have been involved in the
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  manipulation and not only that
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  the training of people
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  non-cooperation
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  and protest techniques
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  the people that have
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  gone into place have been
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  invariably people who are front men
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  for the very
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  the globalist and the Soros networks
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  classic Georgia
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  Mikhail Sargashvili
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  Scholarship to the US, Columbia Law School
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  George Washington University
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  New York law firm
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  turns up and becomes president
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  of Georgia after the so called
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  revolution manipulated by the Soros
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  foundations. We have this
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  extraordinarily ludicrous
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  situation now
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  in the Ukraine where I'm speaking next
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  week where a guy
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  called Viktor Yanukovych
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  was
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  removed after what was
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  claimed to be
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  rigged elections in I think it was
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  2004 the so called Orange Revolution
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  that very man
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  is now president
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  of the country so that
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  revolution of course
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  changed nothing with hindsight
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  and when you look at
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  the situation now in Egypt
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  who turns up
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  not lived in the country
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  for most of his adult?
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  Muhammad Elberide the head of the
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  UN and who is this man
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  he's been on the
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  board of the international crisis
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  group which claims
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  on its website to be
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  independent non-profit
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  non-governmental organization committed to
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  preventing and solving deadly conflict
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  when it's actually there
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  to manipulate regime change
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  in the very way that I'm talking about
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  and they now admit that they
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  sent him in the week before they admittedly
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  triggered it they're bragging about it
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  while publicly saying that they support
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  Mubarak because they know western support
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  for Mubarak will enrage the populace
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  even more but then publicly at the same
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  level admit that they're
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  doing it and so this is what I wanted
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  to ask you David I want you to continue do you agree
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  with my analysis here because
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  I knew this a decade ago because I saw them bragging
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  about it but now they've come out and wired
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  magazine you name it and admitted
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  Google is
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  NSA software for keyword
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  they just get you to search the database
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  to put your own information on it
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  so they literally know what you're thinking
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  and doing and Google says
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  93 to 99%
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  of the time they know where you're going to
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  eat what you're going to surf what you're
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  going to do more than you even
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  know and they're able to predict
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  the future it's a it's a scientific crystal
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  ball to a certain extent
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  by tracking mass movements of
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  people and they knew
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  that there was rebellion against all their
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  dictators forming and so they're going
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  to trigger it early
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  to then bring their people
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  back in and that's basically
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  what's happened but we'll put up on screen
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  those articles about Google
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  and it was now claiming they're getting
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  companies where they can do this that's
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  what they've been set up to do all along
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  that's why the globalist are so arrogant
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  is because
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  they literally do nothing but study
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  humanity and how we operate
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  yeah well the international crisis group
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  board members chairman George
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  Thoris Mohammed Elberardi
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  Wesley Clark say no more you have
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  a Solana the
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  NATO secretary general as was
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  the big new Brazinski is one of their
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  senior advisors we could
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  amatage for goodness sake
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  and Prince Turkey Al-Faisal
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  who is a member of the Saudi
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  Arabia royal family who of course
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  love democracy and freedom which
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  this international crisis group is supposed to
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  represent so you look
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  at that and it's quite
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  clear that Elberardi
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  is their man now
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  also the Daily Telegraph in Britain
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  has been running stories
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  and articles about the fact that
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  some of the people that were
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  that triggered this
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  popular uprising which in its
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  entirety that's what it is
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  from the people's point of view
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  were actually connected to
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  the American embassy
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  in Cairo and came to America
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  and all the rest of it so
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  you can see how it's been manipulated
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  and the thing is that people like
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  Brazinski in his books
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  they are telling you what's
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  going to happen disguised
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  as prophecy if you like
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  Kissinger came out on
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  Bloomberg last night and said
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  this is only the first scene
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  in the first act of a play
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  that's exactly what I was coming to
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  that quote this is
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  only the first scene of the first act of the drama
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  that is played out that is
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  telling you what's coming and you see
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  I've been writing for years
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  about the fact that these
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  Arab oil states and these
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  Arab dictatorships and royal
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  dictatorships were being played
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  like a violin it was only a matter of
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  time and again you come
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  to the shades of grey
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  the dictators and royal
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  tyrannies in Yemen
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  Algeria, Libya, Jordan, Syria
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  Morocco, Saudi Arabia
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  stay there David we got to break
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  a powerful info we're going to look
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  at the geopolitical map when we come back
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  Alex told you the government
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  announced recently that the
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  recession is over it ended on June of
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  2009 the millions of Americans
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  unable to find work might not agree
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  perhaps a recession ended for the
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  bankers and government employees but for
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  the rest of us things seem to be getting worse
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  gold and silver haven't heard the news
