[00:00.000 --> 00:23.160]  It's Monday, June 3, 2019.
[00:23.160 --> 00:24.900]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:24.900 --> 00:30.800]  Strapped in for the next four hours because this broadcast continues to make history thanks
[00:30.800 --> 00:36.840]  to this great crew, our talk show host, our analysts, and you, the audience who are in
[00:36.840 --> 00:40.680]  the arena, big time, we salute you all.
[00:40.680 --> 00:46.360]  Well, constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is helping prepare lawsuits for us, class
[00:46.360 --> 00:52.640]  action lawsuits and more against big tech and others that have been engaged in fascist
[00:52.640 --> 01:02.000]  oligopoly coordination, tortuous interference to also defame us and basically bankrupt us
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.160]  as a political punishment.
[01:04.160 --> 01:11.040]  He's going to be in studio hosting again today with us in the second hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11.040 --> 01:16.480]  And we're going to get him scheduled as well on David Knight's program that comes on weekday
[01:16.480 --> 01:17.920]  mornings at 8 a.m.
[01:17.920 --> 01:21.040]  He'll be on with David tomorrow.
[01:21.040 --> 01:25.920]  So that's set up, I think, in the third hour, so it'll be 10 a.m. tomorrow.
[01:25.920 --> 01:29.960]  That said, we also have several big guests today.
[01:29.960 --> 01:34.680]  We have the great awakening, QAnon.
[01:34.680 --> 01:39.400]  I thought I'd have the best-selling author of this on because I've had mixed feelings
[01:39.400 --> 01:46.000]  about the whole QAnon phenomenon and I haven't had a lot of time to follow it, but I'll tune
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.360]  in to a YouTube video, somebody texts me or whatever and it's like, I used to like Alex
[01:51.360 --> 01:55.440]  Jones with, now I know he's a globalist agent.
[01:55.440 --> 02:00.960]  I'm with Trump and I'm with Q and, you know, just weird stuff like that and there's clearly
[02:00.960 --> 02:05.240]  people out there, even if Q was ever real or whatever it is, that are attacking some
[02:05.240 --> 02:11.200]  of Trump's most key supporters by claiming that they magically are under Trump's command.
[02:11.200 --> 02:12.940]  I talk to the president.
[02:12.940 --> 02:15.040]  My guests talk to the president.
[02:15.040 --> 02:21.120]  I go and write detailed reports directly to the president at the president's request.
[02:21.120 --> 02:27.600]  The White House calls here and asks, what are the best videos of yours for us to tweet?
[02:27.600 --> 02:32.680]  I'm on record talking to the president and it's disgusting to have shadowy people, any
[02:32.680 --> 02:38.840]  other names, telling you that the show and the broadcast that the enemy recognizes was
[02:38.840 --> 02:42.720]  instrumental in getting President Trump in that we're somehow the bad guys.
[02:42.720 --> 02:49.840]  If that isn't a big, fat, globalist scythe, I don't know what is and it's disgusting.
[02:49.840 --> 02:56.240]  Now this individual, I meant to read the book, I haven't yet, and I don't really know if
[02:56.240 --> 02:57.740]  he's attacked me or not.
[02:57.740 --> 03:00.800]  The producer says he seems like a pretty well-spoken, nice fellow.
[03:00.800 --> 03:06.000]  I want to make friends with whatever Q is, but I'm going to explain something.
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.880]  I used to get calls back when the anonymous movement was really getting started seven,
[03:12.880 --> 03:16.160]  eight, nine, ten years ago, whenever it started, about eight, nine years ago.
[03:16.160 --> 03:17.160]  Look that up.
[03:17.160 --> 03:18.160]  When did anonymous phenomenon pop up?
[03:18.160 --> 03:22.960]  And I get calls from listeners and I'd be asked on the street and I would get just all
[03:22.960 --> 03:26.160]  sorts of questions like, do you support anonymous?
[03:26.160 --> 03:28.000]  That's like saying, do I support the ocean?
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.800]  Yeah, I like the ocean.
[03:29.800 --> 03:32.600]  You can also drown in it.
[03:32.600 --> 03:33.800]  Anybody can be anonymous.
[03:33.800 --> 03:35.800]  Anybody can put on a guy, Fox Mask.
[03:35.800 --> 03:41.000]  In 2003, wow, around a lot longer than that, so it's been around 15, 16 years.
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.800]  I guess it got big like 10 years ago.
[03:43.800 --> 03:44.800]  So do you support anonymous?
[03:44.800 --> 03:45.800]  What?
[03:45.800 --> 03:49.080]  Anybody and everybody putting a mask on?
[03:49.080 --> 03:52.840]  And then just saying that they're this big, powerful, anonymous thing and they speak for
[03:52.840 --> 03:54.720]  legions?
[03:54.720 --> 04:00.680]  That's got more credibility in my book than people putting out codes and religious statements
[04:00.680 --> 04:07.120]  and fortune cookie type stuff and little fables and Easter egg hunts, looking for pots of
[04:07.120 --> 04:14.520]  gold in the Klondike's or the treasure of the Sierra Madres, when right there is the
[04:14.520 --> 04:20.880]  real fight against the globalist open in your face, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:20.880 --> 04:26.760]  So that's the bottom line and it's just amazing.
[04:26.760 --> 04:31.880]  I can have former top CIA people on that are openly have the support of Trump, they'll
[04:31.880 --> 04:34.640]  say the most bombshell stuff, no one even cares.
[04:34.640 --> 04:39.080]  But you go on 4chan and you say, I looked in the toilet this morning and on the way
[04:39.080 --> 04:42.840]  the turds were floating around, I saw a secret message from the president.
[04:42.840 --> 04:48.240]  It is taken like, you know, people seeing the Virgin Mary and their toast or something.
[04:48.240 --> 04:49.240]  So that's fine.
[04:49.240 --> 04:53.720]  We're going to get to the bottom of it in the third hour.
[04:53.720 --> 05:01.400]  Unbelievable, stay with us newswars.com.
[05:01.400 --> 05:08.760]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[05:08.760 --> 05:22.400]  This is a digital AI enforced gag order, not to say the name Alex Jones or m4wars.com.
[05:22.400 --> 05:24.120]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[05:24.120 --> 05:25.320]  This is racketeering.
[05:25.320 --> 05:26.320]  This is cartels.
[05:26.320 --> 05:28.840]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[05:28.840 --> 05:30.720]  We need it now.
[05:30.720 --> 05:32.400]  You can take on big tech.
[05:32.400 --> 05:39.720]  They saw m4wars as a dominant, independent, anti-war pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family
[05:39.720 --> 05:41.360]  populist organization.
[05:41.360 --> 05:46.080]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him
[05:46.080 --> 05:49.360]  off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[05:49.360 --> 05:54.280]  Their way to fight back is to support m4wars now more than ever and make it a standard
[05:54.280 --> 05:56.080]  of freedom and free speech.
[05:56.080 --> 06:22.720]  And they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[06:22.720 --> 06:34.920]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:34.920 --> 06:41.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a big broadcast lined up for you today.
[06:41.720 --> 06:50.400]  We have one of the spokesperson for the foggy, unknown, leprechaun-esque cue movement joining
[06:50.400 --> 06:52.720]  us in the third hour should be interesting.
[06:52.720 --> 06:57.120]  We have a constitutional lawyer, Robert Barnes, who's again been here in Austin, often on
[06:57.120 --> 07:02.240]  the last few months, preparing the strategies to defend the First Amendment and the right
[07:02.240 --> 07:08.080]  to buy and sell and the right to commerce and more against the big tech giants and preparing
[07:08.080 --> 07:13.560]  for the antitrust criminal investigations, not just regulatory investigations that will
[07:13.560 --> 07:17.600]  be launching in July last time I was told.
[07:17.600 --> 07:26.880]  And like I told you in 2018 that released the Mueller report in March of 2019, that's
[07:26.880 --> 07:31.920]  how far out the globalists were scripting what they were doing and we had intel on it
[07:31.920 --> 07:33.880]  that was incredibly accurate.
[07:33.880 --> 07:40.880]  But right now, ladies and gentlemen, President Trump is planning symbolically, as of now,
[07:40.880 --> 07:47.040]  as of people that have been in the room, to launch the antitrust salvos and more in or
[07:47.040 --> 07:51.920]  around July 4th, 2019.
[07:51.920 --> 07:59.400]  So this is a big deal and again, we told you this was coming weeks ago, months ago, specifically
[07:59.400 --> 08:04.440]  when I went to D.C. and now the Wall Street Journal has reported and of course the White
[08:04.440 --> 08:13.160]  House has confirmed they are preparing major antitrust action, not just against Google
[08:13.160 --> 08:21.640]  but against others, others like Facebook, why do you think Twitter has been there?
[08:21.640 --> 08:26.440]  And so a lot is coming, a lot is unfolding and the White House is gathering intel and
[08:26.440 --> 08:27.440]  data.
[08:27.440 --> 08:31.280]  Bloomberg of course reported Google should be afraid, very afraid, we're going to get
[08:31.280 --> 08:39.720]  into that in detail today and we are also going to get into the President and First
[08:39.720 --> 08:43.720]  Lady shining over in the U.K.
[08:43.720 --> 08:49.960]  We are also going to look at the collapsed border, which the Democrats now admit has
[08:49.960 --> 08:58.880]  collapsed but they're blaming Trump and we also have the Mexican President saying that
[08:58.880 --> 09:03.760]  the U.S. is basically Mexico's enemy and then you have the Mexican envoy who's in charge
[09:03.760 --> 09:11.960]  of the immigration talks in D.C. saying that President Trump is an enemy of Mexico and
[09:11.960 --> 09:20.720]  that Mexico is at war with the United States.
[09:20.720 --> 09:23.960]  Mexico is a collapsed state and I'm very sorry to say that, it's got a lot of cool people,
[09:23.960 --> 09:28.760]  a lot of nice things, a lot of great art, a lot of interesting innovation, I mean the
[09:28.760 --> 09:35.160]  Mexicans are interesting people but their country is a hellish police state and it's
[09:35.160 --> 09:43.520]  collapsed in many areas and they are weaponizing third world populations and getting payment
[09:43.520 --> 09:49.480]  from coyotes now, smugglers that are bringing them in, including hundreds of Africans at
[09:49.480 --> 09:59.720]  a time coming across into Texas over the Rio Grande, unbelievable and many times up to
[09:59.720 --> 10:03.480]  30% of the children with them, whether they be African, whether they be from Mexico are
[10:03.480 --> 10:11.400]  kidnapped as the passage into the country and as the anchor baby but the problem is
[10:11.400 --> 10:17.840]  is that the government's doing genetic testing and 30% are not related, yes these are kidnapped
[10:17.840 --> 10:28.640]  children and remember Obama started this entire practice, that is all coming up here today.
[10:28.640 --> 10:37.080]  Now when we come back, John Bownes in a very important report, antitrust suits threaten
[10:37.080 --> 10:41.680]  technocratic domination, that's just suits that the Supreme Court's already ruled in
[10:41.680 --> 10:49.440]  favor of against Apple and so we've got a lot of different angles to all of this that
[10:49.440 --> 10:54.400]  we're going to be breaking down today but you couldn't have a bigger victory than to
[10:54.400 --> 10:59.360]  begin moving in the direction of ensuring that citizens of this country but others around
[10:59.360 --> 11:04.600]  the world can simply communicate with each other, Twitter first it was hundreds of accounts
[11:04.600 --> 11:15.040]  two days ago, now it's thousands of accounts ahead of the Tiananmen Square anniversary,
[11:15.040 --> 11:20.720]  hundreds of accounts at the direction of the Chinese government have been taken down because
[11:20.720 --> 11:26.880]  they're seen as being against the communist dictatorship that's killed tens of millions
[11:26.880 --> 11:32.640]  well actually over a hundred million to stay in power so to translate that, Twitter works
[11:32.640 --> 11:39.760]  with a regime that's killed five times what Hitler did, that's not disputed, oh but Twitter
[11:39.760 --> 11:46.640]  and Facebook and Google and Apple can name me a dangerous person, Facebook said the most
[11:46.640 --> 11:53.200]  dangerous, they said Alex Jones has a designation no one else has, he has a new level where
[11:53.200 --> 11:58.640]  you may not even say his name unless it's negative connotation so it's beyond Voldemort
[11:58.640 --> 12:04.280]  where you can't say my name, you can only say it if you say to hell with Alex Jones
[12:04.280 --> 12:10.880]  or Alex Jones is a horrible person you must disparage me, you must bully me, a big giant
[12:10.880 --> 12:22.360]  tech company or hundreds of billions of dollars saying that you should all attack me all 2.4
[12:22.360 --> 12:29.760]  billion users, well that's not dangerous, that's not scary, that's not a problem and
[12:29.760 --> 12:33.360]  then they back these governments that have killed over a hundred million, back other
[12:33.360 --> 12:38.120]  governments that have killed tens of millions, back the force relocation and two million
[12:38.120 --> 12:43.360]  people in China put in concentration camps and it's all admitted and Apple and Google
[12:43.360 --> 12:47.520]  are at the vanguard, they're at the forefront, they're at the tip of the spear, they are
[12:47.520 --> 12:58.320]  the Rangers way out on the front
[12:58.320 --> 13:02.840]  and they can sit there with their straight faces splattered with blood thirst telling
[13:02.840 --> 13:08.640]  the world that someone with no criminal record, someone who never heard a fly that didn't
[13:08.640 --> 13:16.560]  attack me first, somebody that's a sweet daddy with 3 daughters and a great son, I'm
[13:16.560 --> 13:23.120]  the dangerous one, you see, I'm the bad man, says Tim Cook who owns and runs and contracts
[13:23.120 --> 13:16.560]  the worst factories according to even Am
[13:26.560 --> 13:34.520]  International in the world, out of all the tens of thousands of sweatshops and slave factories
[13:34.520 --> 13:43.000]  nobody can top Apple, nobody but because he's skinny and he hops around saying I'm gay,
[13:43.000 --> 14:12.040]  I'm gay every 15 seconds, we must bow to him because he's gay, he's gay, he's gay, he's gay, can
[14:12.040 --> 14:40.200]  in a tableunit, when someone going why did I bet on Brent Jesse's Well, who have its obvious,
[14:40.200 --> 14:41.480]  AOC

[14:44.280 --> 14:47.320]  But history shows again and again
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.240]  The tyrants like you fall and if you look at the way the winds been blowing
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  And if you look at everything's been unfolding
[14:57.040 --> 15:02.720]  Does the season for people like you to fall into oblivion and to fall forever?

[20:05.280 --> 20:30.680]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[20:36.160 --> 20:38.400]  The fight is on ladies and gentlemen
[20:39.040 --> 20:44.320]  Big tech tried to hypnotize the world as they openly allied themselves with the murderous
[20:46.160 --> 20:52.000]  Communist chai comms and tell us that oh no one can regulate us on speech
[20:54.200 --> 21:00.800]  And then they would use their corporate freedom to then violate everybody else's rights on their platforms and bully and docks and harass
[21:01.400 --> 21:03.400]  anyone that was Christian or
[21:03.400 --> 21:05.400]  pro-america or pro-freedom
[21:05.760 --> 21:07.760]  or pro self-defense
[21:08.560 --> 21:10.560]  But what about
[21:11.200 --> 21:15.480]  Being giant trust what about being giant monopolies and working
[21:16.160 --> 21:21.400]  With all the rest of Silicon Valley to ban Alex Jones in one day and
[21:22.440 --> 21:24.440]  Then to start banning others
[21:24.560 --> 21:28.880]  Bring in the Communist Chinese social score, which is their model that showed the world
[21:28.880 --> 21:35.680]  They're working in concert to shut down their competition and Facebook and Apple and Google buy
[21:36.440 --> 21:43.720]  Hundreds of companies a year. I saw a report last year where Google had bought over a thousand companies in one year
[21:45.440 --> 21:49.640]  You know, how do they do that they're worth almost a trillion dollars Apple's worth almost a trillion
[21:50.120 --> 21:56.000]  Facebook close to a trillion they go out and buy anything and everything up so that there's no
[21:56.000 --> 22:01.400]  Competition what did Eisenhower warn of be where the power of the consolidated
[22:02.920 --> 22:04.920]  technological elite
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.080]  In control of government research labs working with private corporations
[22:10.280 --> 22:16.440]  Creating monopolies of scientific development and consolidating control. That was his full statement
[22:17.360 --> 22:21.840]  Then he said beware the Maryland Terry industrial complex
[22:21.840 --> 22:28.120]  They're buying everything up to kill the competition
[22:28.920 --> 22:34.680]  And that's just downright un-American and so we're gonna bust their asses up
[22:36.120 --> 22:42.280]  Anybody like gab or anybody tries to build their own social network. They come after you the banks come after you
[22:42.600 --> 22:45.320]  Google comes after you they work in concert
[22:46.080 --> 22:48.320]  To create a centralized system
[22:48.320 --> 22:54.640]  Let's go to this important report antitrust suits threaten
[22:55.520 --> 22:57.520]  the technocratic
[22:57.520 --> 22:59.520]  tyranny of big tech
[23:00.400 --> 23:03.840]  Recently of all sources a Bloomberg opinion piece
[23:04.160 --> 23:11.640]  Threaten the tech industry by titling the article Google should be afraid very afraid the piece continues
[23:11.640 --> 23:19.360]  This is the moment the u.s. Technology superpowers surely knew was coming the u.s. Government is preparing to crawl all over
[23:19.720 --> 23:27.600]  Google to figure out whether it is an abusive monopolist Google parent company alphabet incorporated and the other tech giants
[23:27.600 --> 23:30.320]  Should be quaking in their fleece vests
[23:30.560 --> 23:38.000]  It was reported recently that the Department of Justice is preparing to open an investigation into Google's compliance with
[23:38.000 --> 23:42.880]  Antitrust laws, but as the tech industry actually got in the message
[23:43.080 --> 23:48.480]  replete with all of its hubris and billions flowing in from the Saudis and the Chinese if
[23:48.920 --> 23:56.200]  Silicon Valley were a country it would be one of the richest countries on earth and it might as well be another country
[23:56.200 --> 24:00.680]  It certainly holds the rights of its host country in utter content
[24:00.760 --> 24:07.480]  Which is why the Justice Department is finally doing something about it. I mean after all we are supposed to have laws
[24:07.480 --> 24:14.240]  Right Reuters continued to analyze how the tech giants had rigged the game one source said the potential investigation
[24:14.920 --> 24:22.800]  First reported by the Wall Street Journal focused on accusations that Google gave preference to its own businesses and searches
[24:23.240 --> 24:30.160]  Early in 2013 the FTC closed a long-running investigation of Google giving it a slap on the wrist
[24:30.440 --> 24:34.760]  under FTC pressure Google agreed to end the practice of
[24:34.760 --> 24:41.840]  scraping reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products and to let
[24:42.320 --> 24:47.600]  advertisers export data to independently assess campaigns Google search
[24:47.920 --> 24:53.640]  YouTube reviews maps and other businesses which are largely free to consumers
[24:53.680 --> 25:02.320]  But finance through advertising have catapulted it from a startup to one of the world's richest companies in just two decades and
[25:02.320 --> 25:08.040]  Amazon with its single-handed decimation of retail outlets across the United States is
[25:08.440 --> 25:13.480]  Preparing for the worst as San Francisco Gate reports Amazon could face heightened
[25:13.800 --> 25:20.400]  Antitrust scrutiny under a new agreement between US regulators that puts it under closer watch by the FTC
[25:20.640 --> 25:27.320]  While Facebook continues to dox the privacy of those merely using its fascistic platform to
[25:27.320 --> 25:34.880]  Criticize one of those holding the most public of all public offices the speaker of the house as Jamie White reported
[25:35.040 --> 25:43.040]  Facebook has helped far left publication the daily beast dox the user behind the Pelosi meme that went viral last week in
[25:43.360 --> 25:48.720]  Pursuing the identity of the person who uploaded a slowed-down video of how Speaker Nancy Pelosi
[25:49.400 --> 25:55.320]  Slurring and stammering during a press conference, which was only made more surreal by slowing it down
[25:55.320 --> 26:03.760]  Facebook confirmed to the Daily Beast the account belonged to one Sean Brooks a black 34-year-old day laborer and Trump supporter
[26:03.760 --> 26:10.160]  But a Facebook official confirming a Daily Beast investigation said the video was first posted on
[26:10.360 --> 26:18.320]  Politics watchdog directly from Brooks personal Facebook account according to the Daily Beast report Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook
[26:18.320 --> 26:25.680]  Bezos is Amazon and YouTube's cannibalistic algorithm is the crazed musting elephant in the room
[26:26.240 --> 26:31.040]  Zuckerberg's lawyer recently argued that users have no expectation of privacy
[26:31.200 --> 26:37.920]  Which completely contradicts Zuckerberg's claim that he will be making Facebook more private in the near future
[26:38.040 --> 26:47.000]  Meanwhile Facebook aides serial bank robbing kidnappers the platform fueled a genocide in Myanmar and puts the speaker of the United States
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.800]  Congress favored by an invading small country known as Silicon Valley
[26:52.560 --> 26:57.960]  dominating the United States Bill of Rights and its citizens John Bowne reporting
[27:05.160 --> 27:10.400]  This amazing report that you just listened to every TV viewer just watched is very important
[27:10.560 --> 27:14.760]  It's such a powerful short little four-and-a-half minute report. I don't know what to call it
[27:14.760 --> 27:18.200]  See the report big tech fears
[27:21.920 --> 27:23.920]  See the report
[27:25.680 --> 27:31.180]  Showing show the see the report documenting big tech's crimes. I
[27:32.440 --> 27:34.440]  Don't know we're gonna post it
[27:34.680 --> 27:37.280]  10 full wars calm assignment been posted yet

[27:52.920 --> 27:55.840]  They've tried to set the precedent to kick us off all these platforms
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.640]  But then also tell you you're not allowed to put it back up and to even try to tell other talk show hosts
[28:01.640 --> 28:07.200]  They can't have us on and I can tell you that's part of the whole anti-trust investigation
[28:07.760 --> 28:10.800]  Is serious civil rights abuse of the average American?
[28:10.800 --> 28:19.760]  Telling them who they can talk about who they can promote. That's cult-like and it's extremely illegal and extremely dangerous
[28:20.480 --> 28:22.480]  so I can tell you that the White House and
[28:23.280 --> 28:27.640]  the Federal Trade Commission and others are looking at that I can tell you that
[28:30.600 --> 28:34.880]  Bob Barnes will be back in studio constitutional lawyer has been up in DC
[28:34.880 --> 28:41.440]  Talking to the top Republicans and others and so we mean business and we are going to be filing suit

[33:13.400 --> 33:15.400]  Big brother
[33:15.520 --> 33:17.520]  mainstream media
[33:17.720 --> 33:20.920]  Government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny?
[33:21.280 --> 33:23.280]  Well, so does he
[33:23.280 --> 33:28.200]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones
[33:32.680 --> 33:34.680]  You know what's amazing
[33:35.880 --> 33:37.880]  If you go back just ten years ago
[33:39.160 --> 33:41.920]  When corporate media lined up for the nightly news
[33:42.440 --> 33:46.120]  You would have the same sponsors in the same order during the breaks
[33:46.920 --> 33:52.480]  almost all all the time and you would also always have the same news stories
[33:52.480 --> 34:00.320]  In the same order with the same talking points on ABC CBS NBC you name it
[34:01.840 --> 34:05.560]  Fox came in and just changed the talking points just a little bit
[34:07.360 --> 34:09.360]  But now today
[34:09.520 --> 34:13.440]  Nine times out of ten the public just doesn't believe the talking points
[34:13.920 --> 34:20.160]  Put out by corporate media and the perspective or the view or the analysis put out here
[34:20.160 --> 34:21.720]  becomes
[34:21.720 --> 34:27.840]  The talking point and they've tracked back because of our activist audience and how informed you are
[34:28.240 --> 34:30.960]  That info wars the majority of the time
[34:32.160 --> 34:34.160]  for talk radio
[34:34.320 --> 34:39.400]  Is the place where countervailing points are made to the establishment?
[34:42.160 --> 34:47.280]  Now that isn't again about getting up on a mountain and thought that my chest and saying I'm so good
[34:47.280 --> 34:51.400]  I'm so great without drudge report calm being able to really
[34:52.160 --> 34:59.360]  Set the agenda for newsrooms. We wouldn't even have moved the ball down the field drudge when it just comes to making things a focal point
[35:00.080 --> 35:05.920]  In many cases that the mainstream media isn't focused on and then causing them to follow his lead is
[35:06.560 --> 35:09.560]  Unprecedented in the annals of telecommunications and news
[35:10.840 --> 35:14.880]  So I simply point out how we're winning this fight against the globalist and
[35:14.880 --> 35:20.720]  And why they're trying to shut us down and why they're trying to censor is because we're kicking the living snot out of them
[35:21.720 --> 35:24.920]  And it was an extremely bold reckless move
[35:26.960 --> 35:31.720]  To come out and try to engage in open draconian blacklisting
[35:32.920 --> 35:39.440]  The likes of which jesus mccarthy never dreamed of and not just the blacklisting the defamation the demonization
[35:39.440 --> 35:46.200]  The lying about the people once you've silenced them. It's really
[35:47.400 --> 35:50.800]  Mind-blowing that this isn't some 1984 novel
[35:51.960 --> 35:54.760]  Projecting into the future some dystopia. This is
[35:55.640 --> 35:58.280]  The dystopia attempting to take over
[35:59.440 --> 36:06.640]  Freenations and in many cases failing because they can censor in the short term they can get up there and
[36:06.640 --> 36:12.920]  Crow like roosters from the rooftops, but it always fails long term
[36:14.560 --> 36:16.560]  And it's failing
[36:17.240 --> 36:20.160]  Very very quickly now
[36:21.400 --> 36:23.400]  So this is an amazing time to be alive
[36:25.760 --> 36:28.560]  Make no mistake, but how are the globalists going to counter
[36:29.640 --> 36:35.960]  They're going to counter with imploding borders. They're gonna counter with government programs designed to undermine society
[36:35.960 --> 36:40.720]  They're going to counter with racial and cultural and religious and sexual
[36:42.480 --> 36:44.200]  Balkanization and
[36:44.200 --> 36:50.200]  It's in the democratic talking points to create liberation theology and to make young people's
[36:51.200 --> 36:53.200]  World view their identity
[36:54.320 --> 37:01.400]  Be fighting the evil America and believing America sucks even though they fight to get into America
[37:01.400 --> 37:06.920]  At the same time that's a very dangerous operating system, but if you look at
[37:08.200 --> 37:10.560]  Every blue city every blue state
[37:11.320 --> 37:15.200]  They can't hide it anymore the giant open-air sewers the rats
[37:16.480 --> 37:20.720]  The bizarreness the Sodom and Gomorrah behavior when I was in
[37:23.880 --> 37:27.080]  Skid robe and we're gonna play these videos next segment
[37:27.080 --> 37:34.480]  In Los Angeles, that's a right around the police department and it was go on for 10 15 blocks in all directions. I
[37:36.080 --> 37:40.840]  Saw things that I couldn't go over with a camera and film
[37:43.320 --> 37:45.320]  Because I was gonna throw up
[37:47.760 --> 37:51.840]  And I actually can't even say this on air we've got a couple of reports we put them out
[37:51.840 --> 37:56.000]  I never even aired them here because I I actually didn't want to relive seeing it and
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.880]  And just seeing them put what they put up on screen. I almost threw up and I'm not kidding
[38:02.440 --> 38:03.920]  Because
[38:03.920 --> 38:08.640]  We were gonna still be there for another hour and I had to leave and we had an LAPD detective
[38:08.760 --> 38:10.880]  Who was off-duty that escorted us down there?
[38:12.560 --> 38:17.200]  And yeah, here we are going inside of some of these tents with Katie Hopkins and
[38:17.200 --> 38:24.560]  And and he's got his disabled wife and there's some of these folks who really really sad a lot of folks hurt on heroin, but
[38:26.720 --> 38:28.720]  When I had to leave
[38:29.760 --> 38:33.080]  He'd stopped and we're filming and talking to some people and I looked over in a tent
[38:34.880 --> 38:36.880]  But there were two people having sex in it
[38:36.880 --> 38:47.240]  I'm searching if I pull this up my brain. I'm gonna throw up but people need to hear this and it was horrible smell
[38:48.440 --> 38:50.440]  smells you can't describe
[38:50.840 --> 38:52.840]  Beyond sewage beyond rotting food
[38:53.360 --> 38:55.360]  There's a smell of like sex
[38:55.920 --> 39:03.400]  Okay, and like out of a zombie movie. You think you've seen zombies crawl out of graves or be crawling through the shopping mall all bleeding with their
[39:03.960 --> 39:05.960]  guts hanging out
[39:05.960 --> 39:11.400]  Yeah, that's on TV's real footage of homeless people. Well, how'd you guys find that? That's exactly what I saw
[39:11.800 --> 39:13.800]  There was a black man
[39:14.280 --> 39:16.280]  with a wig on
[39:16.920 --> 39:21.880]  With a white guy with huge breast so he obviously he was giving hormone treatments
[39:24.240 --> 39:30.160]  Having sex and I'm not even I'm sitting there all doing every and I look over in this tent and I go what in the hell is that
[39:30.960 --> 39:32.960]  They're having sex
[39:32.960 --> 39:36.880]  So I turn around for two minutes ignore it all of a sudden like zombies
[39:36.880 --> 39:43.480]  They've crawled out and are coming at me and the man has put a shirt back on he has big breasts and
[39:43.760 --> 39:47.640]  There's sweat all over him and the smell is deafening
[39:49.640 --> 39:54.720]  And they're both looking at me with sexual desire and I look down to the black guy and
[39:55.480 --> 40:00.800]  He had like rolls of fat, but he was skinny hanging down like like melting
[40:00.800 --> 40:08.720]  Wax and you could see the spinal cord. There was nothing there and I look down and the feet were rotting
[40:09.560 --> 40:12.640]  They look grosser than zombies and there were flies all over
[40:14.200 --> 40:16.200]  His genitals
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  And I
[40:20.840 --> 40:22.840]  Began to throw up and
[40:22.840 --> 40:30.200]  And the LAPD detective said yeah, it's bad. He had a handkerchief over his face and we ran we ran we started running
[40:31.640 --> 40:33.480]  Okay
[40:33.480 --> 40:34.800]  Let me tell you folks
[40:34.800 --> 40:37.920]  I've never seen anything like it
[40:37.920 --> 40:42.360]  I've had to drag with a tractor a dead horse when I worked on a ranch that maggots all over it
[40:42.360 --> 40:47.400]  I've seen car wrecks where I pull over to render a for somebody's head was almost completely cut off
[40:47.400 --> 40:53.600]  There was blood spraying everywhere and I knew him. I went to high school with him. It was nothing nothing
[40:54.560 --> 40:56.440]  because the
[40:56.440 --> 40:58.440]  sickening gravy
[40:58.440 --> 41:03.520]  On top of the mess was what was so sick the the people enjoying
[41:04.400 --> 41:09.320]  The 90 degree heat sweat all over him having sex
[41:10.160 --> 41:12.640]  With what looked like two zombies
[41:12.640 --> 41:17.520]  And I'll never forget looking down the stomach
[41:18.120 --> 41:23.040]  Because I started looking head-to-toe as the zombies are advancing by the time I turn around they're like six feet away
[41:23.040 --> 41:29.280]  I'm like, huh, huh, and all of a sudden I just looked down. I was like what the hell
[41:29.960 --> 41:33.040]  because one of them was wearing like a tube top and
[41:35.080 --> 41:36.680]  There was like
[41:36.680 --> 41:38.560]  Again like giblets hanging down
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.440]  But you could see the spinal cord in this tiny waist and and and it just went
[41:44.240 --> 41:50.800]  It was sexual desire and I could smell it and it was flies all over and I started throwing up for
[41:51.320 --> 41:53.320]  I'm gonna do it again for the memory
[41:53.960 --> 41:55.960]  We actually ran
[41:58.680 --> 42:01.760]  We ran ran
[42:01.760 --> 42:12.040]  I remember the LAPD cop we had another security people with us like you know as we jogged out they're going yeah
[42:12.040 --> 42:13.840]  Let's just get the hell out of here. We don't need to be here anymore
[42:13.840 --> 42:17.440]  And again, it's not that you're afraid of the drug dealers threatening or any of that. It's that
[42:18.360 --> 42:20.360]  when you're around
[42:20.600 --> 42:24.320]  piles of human feces and gutters filled with urine and
[42:24.320 --> 42:31.300]  And and and all of it and then you see people that look like zombies having sex in the middle of it, you know
[42:33.200 --> 42:35.200]  You know that this is Satan's work
[42:36.440 --> 42:39.760]  Unbelievable and I haven't told you the worst part. There were all these young women
[42:40.280 --> 42:47.880]  18 19 20 years old who looked very pretty but who's like zombies now who would be like sitting there with their pimps being sold
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  with all the needles around them and
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.480]  And right in front of the department is the police are ordered not to stop them
[42:56.240 --> 42:58.240]  Yes, folks, it's beyond evil
[42:58.720 --> 43:05.400]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine
[43:05.400 --> 43:08.880]  Bro, mind you name it that it lowers IQ it literally

[43:15.040 --> 43:17.040]  We've gone through two permutations
[43:17.040 --> 43:23.840]  First seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it
[43:23.920 --> 43:29.560]  So we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2. That's been incredible
[43:30.200 --> 43:37.760]  Now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but
[43:38.440 --> 43:46.000]  Chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.240]  It supercharges it and makes it even more
[43:49.960 --> 43:57.960]  Bioavailable ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it? It's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4slife.com

[45:06.760 --> 45:12.320]  To talk to you before I get into what I want to say. I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all
[45:12.320 --> 45:14.400]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force
[45:14.400 --> 45:19.160]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic root things like that that I trust
[45:19.160 --> 45:21.440]  You know because I've seen a lot of other vitamins
[45:21.440 --> 45:25.280]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them and they're often not things that are natural
[45:25.280 --> 45:29.080]  I appreciate that what happened with ultimate female force. Tell us about it. Well, it's really great
[45:29.080 --> 45:31.560]  You know, it's like a multivitamin. I take it it tastes good
[45:31.560 --> 45:38.080]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste that actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste and you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day
[45:38.080 --> 45:41.720]  So I really like it. Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are

[45:51.520 --> 45:57.080]  So I'm glad you plugged it in four store.com or triple a two five three three one three nine
[45:57.080 --> 46:02.080]  Okay, it's true
[46:27.080 --> 46:29.080]  I
[46:57.880 --> 46:59.880]  Get the fish oil
[47:02.960 --> 47:05.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:05.840 --> 47:20.560]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[47:20.560 --> 47:38.280]  Welcome back folks Alex Jones here live and you know, I apologize the listeners for the gross details
[47:38.280 --> 47:43.360]  But I don't apologize on the one end because it's got to be done. You got to know how bad it is
[47:44.040 --> 47:46.040]  And I didn't even describe properly
[47:46.040 --> 47:54.040]  The two undead zombie creatures dressed like women that I saw having sex that then came after us
[47:55.040 --> 47:58.040]  And unlike a zombie movie where they want your brains
[47:58.040 --> 48:02.040]  It was a look of total desire and acting like women going
[48:02.040 --> 48:12.040]  Baby high and and again you look down and there's flies all over these fetid panties that he's wearing
[48:12.040 --> 48:16.040]  And show the feet again because we've got video these two Zambos
[48:16.040 --> 48:20.040]  I don't think we put it in the report but because it was so gross
[48:21.040 --> 48:27.040]  But we probably should but but the crew found it. That's what the feet on one of them look like
[48:27.040 --> 48:30.040]  But the stomach looked like that too
[48:31.040 --> 48:35.040]  I'm telling you folks. I've never seen anything like it
[48:35.040 --> 48:45.040]  And I'm telling you imagine like a shopping shirt one of them was obviously on hormones and big breasts with flies
[48:45.040 --> 48:50.040]  All it was a white guy with this wig on drooling at me and others and again
[48:50.040 --> 48:55.040]  They just been having sex in the tent and came out because we were there 15 feet away
[48:57.040 --> 49:02.040]  And I'm telling you folks you could go into any one of the tents and people would do it
[49:02.040 --> 49:07.040]  You could go into any one of the tents and people would death threat you there were drug dealers out there with escalades
[49:07.040 --> 49:10.040]  With with with people that had just been out there a few months
[49:10.040 --> 49:16.040]  So you'd see young girls that have like black eyes and you know look like your daughter out there
[49:16.040 --> 49:25.040]  It was just unbelievable and folks it went on and on and on for mile after mile after mile after mile after mile after mile after mile
[49:25.040 --> 49:37.040]  And when you see somebody covered in flies and sweat and everything else dragging one foot and going baby baby
[49:37.040 --> 49:42.040]  Let me take care of you. You know you've entered the ninth circle hell
[49:45.040 --> 49:50.040]  Again if you're a radio listener you're lucky you're not seeing this but you know what people have a right to know folks
[49:50.040 --> 49:52.040]  Because we got to clean this up
[49:52.040 --> 50:00.040]  Good God that's enough let's there's so many these reports but here's this report on LA and typhoids back
[50:00.040 --> 50:04.040]  The police are getting sick, sewage everywhere kids are getting TB in school
[50:04.040 --> 50:08.040]  Illegal aliens aren't allowed to be tested because that's racist so they're put right in class with people
[50:08.040 --> 50:10.040]  It's the collapse of civilization by design
[50:10.040 --> 50:14.040]  Nobody's ever done this in any country unless they want to fall
[50:14.040 --> 50:18.040]  Europe's doing the exact same thing so you in attack here it is
[50:18.040 --> 50:24.040]  I have to begin with the shocking case out of LA and two friends of mine have told me about this
[50:24.040 --> 50:32.040]  A police officer now has contracted that really rare and life threatening illness disease typhoid fever
[50:32.040 --> 50:38.040]  Now is it fewer than 350 Americans contract this every year so what's going on here
[50:38.040 --> 50:44.040]  We have complete breakdown of the basic needs of civilization in Los Angeles right now
[50:44.040 --> 50:49.040]  We have the three prongs of airborne disease tuberculosis is exploding
[50:49.040 --> 50:53.040]  Rodenborn we're one of the only major cities in the country does not have a rodent control program
[50:53.040 --> 50:59.040]  And sanitation is broken down we had a typhus outbreak last number we will have a typhus outbreak this summer
[50:59.040 --> 51:04.040]  I'm hearing from experts that bubonic plague is likely it's already here we'll get on to the rat fleas
[51:04.040 --> 51:10.040]  And then now finally we have this this oral fecal root contamination which is typhoid fever
[51:10.040 --> 51:17.040]  Three cases one confirmed probably three this is unbelievable I can't believe I live in a city
[51:17.040 --> 51:24.040]  Where this is not third world but Laura this is medieval third world countries are insulted if they are cues of being like this
[51:24.040 --> 51:34.040]  No city on earth tolerate this the entire population is at risk and God forbid if measles this is a population that's suboptimally immunized
[51:34.040 --> 51:39.040]  If measles gets in I just have an image of myself on my knees and the gutter tending to people
[51:39.040 --> 51:45.040]  That's right there buddy boy Dr. Drew it's the illegals bringing in the measles the measles vaccine doesn't protect you
[51:45.040 --> 51:58.040]  It admits that on the insert so don't try that but again San Diego is the same Long Beach LA San Francisco
[51:58.040 --> 52:13.040]  Portland Seattle Chicago New York Austin now has shanning towns I can walk 600 yards
[52:13.040 --> 52:24.040]  And show you giant piles of feces and people laid out on the ground pissing on themselves in three different directions
[52:24.040 --> 52:32.040]  This is all been done by design this is the collapse of civilization we are flooded with heroin we are flooded by the opiates
[52:32.040 --> 52:38.040]  We are flooded by cities that put up with it and and and give these people money so they can keep the habits going
[52:38.040 --> 52:45.040]  And there's these whole leftist systems that milk it and that control it on top
[52:45.040 --> 52:58.040]  Let's go ahead and go to this report Seattle is dead just just part of it then we'll go to LA here it is
[52:58.040 --> 53:04.040]  Let me ask you something what if Seattle is dying and we don't even know it
[53:04.040 --> 53:10.040]  This story is about a seething simmering anger that is now boiling over into outrage
[53:10.040 --> 53:18.040]  It is about people who have felt compassion yes but who no longer feel safe no longer feel like they are heard no longer feel protected
[53:18.040 --> 53:28.040]  It is about lost souls who wander our streets untethered to home or family or reality chasing a drug which in turn chases them
[53:28.040 --> 53:35.040]  It is about the damage they inflict on themselves to be sure but also on the fabric of this place where we live
[53:35.040 --> 53:46.040]  This story is about a beautiful jewel that has been violated and a crisis of faith amongst a generation of Seattleites falling out of love with their home
[53:50.040 --> 53:57.040]  There is another part of this story too it's about a solution an idea for a city that has run out of them
[53:57.040 --> 54:01.040]  Let's stop right there and we'll just roll some of the b-roll for TV viewers
[54:01.040 --> 54:09.040]  Criminal elements of our government on record are shipping narcotics into the US
[54:09.040 --> 54:19.040]  They've been caught over and over again I know that Army officers who were in Afghanistan under Obama when they would tell them
[54:19.040 --> 54:27.040]  Get your men addicted and Russian helicopters would land delivering them prescription opioids saying oh you're stressed out you all just need this
[54:27.040 --> 54:32.040]  Not blaming the Russians as they would deliver it Pentagon would send these drugs in to get them addicted
[54:32.040 --> 54:40.040]  So they would then be dealers and help bring it back into the US and wouldn't talk when the C-130s were loaded with the heroin
[54:40.040 --> 54:46.040]  So that's part one of this and Trump's trying to stop it
[54:46.040 --> 54:54.040]  But heroin is cheaper a dose of heroin is cheaper than a cup of coffee in Austin, Texas or Seattle, Washington
[54:54.040 --> 55:03.040]  It's fact so when a dose of heroin is two or three dollars and you get people on it it's game over
[55:03.040 --> 55:11.040]  And when cities tolerate it and they tolerate the dealers and they tolerate it being brought in this is what happens
[55:11.040 --> 55:16.040]  And your daughter gets on it your son gets on it and their lives over
[55:16.040 --> 55:21.040]  So that's what this is all about and you take the police that told me they said yeah we're really mad about this
[55:21.040 --> 55:33.040]  We're ordered by the sitting not to stop this we've got the footage of the drug dealers and their big escalades staring at me with armed police
[55:33.040 --> 55:39.040]  Like what the hell are you doing here we own this area and I'm talking not even a block
[55:39.040 --> 55:45.040]  The damn shantytown is less than 100 yards from the police station in LA
[55:45.040 --> 55:51.040]  And you drive all over LA and you see more shantytowns on underpasses and up on hills it's everywhere
[55:51.040 --> 55:56.040]  And they wonder why there's all the fires because the homeless burn fires during high winds
[55:56.040 --> 56:01.040]  They inject heroin while their fire is going and it burns down half the city
[56:01.040 --> 56:06.040]  This is the leftist mentality it's a demonic spirit it's what they create
[56:06.040 --> 56:09.040]  I'm going to come back for Bob Barnes joining us again in studio
[56:09.040 --> 56:14.040]  I'm going to play local LA report that's pretty powerful but this is what they do it's what they create
[56:14.040 --> 56:19.040]  We're fighting to stop this and red cities don't have this
[56:19.040 --> 56:26.040]  It just doesn't happen because when it does pop up people take it damn serious and care
[56:26.040 --> 56:34.040]  Kind of like when multiple convicted pedophiles get caught running drag queen story times in Austin and Houston everywhere else
[56:34.040 --> 56:40.040]  We make a big deal about it the media taxes the platforms this but guess what folks are getting arrested
[56:40.040 --> 56:47.040]  Because we're the weirdos that think shouldn't be taking kids into convicted pedophiles and having them sit on their laps

[58:48.040 --> 58:53.040]  InfoWars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine
[58:53.040 --> 59:00.040]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[59:00.040 --> 59:07.040]  Including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function
[59:07.040 --> 59:16.040]  In the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[59:16.040 --> 59:24.040]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[59:24.040 --> 59:31.040]  That helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine
[59:31.040 --> 59:41.040]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body
[59:41.040 --> 59:49.040]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets
[1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:21.040]  Tirelessly waging war on corruption from deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide
[1:00:21.040 --> 1:00:44.040]  It's Alex Jones. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. You are GOAT! We are GOAT! Launch!
[1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:57.040]  1776 worldwide, which you are seeing happen. It's true. My plan, which was a common sense plan, was adopted by the patriots.
[1:00:57.040 --> 1:01:05.040]  Made perfect sense. It wasn't my plan. I just relaunched the plan that was already there and the globalists don't like me for it, but hell, it doesn't matter. We're going to win in the end.
[1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:12.040]  Let's go to this special report on the collapse of the blue cities and then we'll get to Bob Barnes here in the studio
[1:01:12.040 --> 1:01:21.040]  It's a breeding ground for disease and fleas carrying typhus. Now the rats are living in mountains of trash left, uncollected for weeks, even months.
[1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:32.040]  The mayor has promised to clean it up, but eye team investigator Joe Grover found the city continues to ignore the growing garbage heaps, and that puts all of us at risk
[1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:43.040]  You're getting a bird's eye view of LA's most notorious trash pile. It's in downtown on Saras Avenue, right between the fashion and produce districts.
[1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:52.040]  Day and night, this spot and countless others are magnets for rats that could carry fleas infected with typhus and other diseases.
[1:01:52.040 --> 1:02:02.040]  I am so scared. Estella Lopez represents business owners who've complained to the city about the Saras Avenue trash pile and others like it.
[1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:06.040]  I can't walk down the street without thinking that a flea could jump on me.
[1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:18.040]  This national survey now ranks LA as the second most rat infested city in the nation. One reason experts say heaps of uncollected trash at hundreds of homeless encampments,
[1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:27.040]  where people are literally living in piles of garbage, like outside this supermarket and inside that mountain of filth on Saras Avenue.
[1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:31.040]  This is a breeding ground for typhus. I'm disgusted by it personally.
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:36.040]  We first told Mayor Garcetti about that Saras Avenue health hazard last October.
[1:02:36.040 --> 1:02:42.040]  Our responsibility is to make sure the trash doesn't even accumulate in the first place. That shouldn't have happened, and we're going to make sure it doesn't.
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:53.040]  Right after that interview, the city did clear away the trash here. But month after month since then, we've been watching and the filth has been piling up once again.
[1:02:53.040 --> 1:02:57.040]  I want to report a huge trash pile at 800 Saras Street.
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:02:59.040]  And even a call to 311.
[1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:01.040]  Hello, this is Mayor Eric Garcetti.
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:03.040]  Couldn't get the city to act fast.
[1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:05.040]  You're saying it could take up to 90 days to clean it up.
[1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:16.040]  An inefficient system for collecting rotting garbage. And the I team has learned the city has no program to control the growing rat population that feasts on all that trash.
[1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:23.040]  Other big cities like New York and Washington have entire teams devoted to rat control.
[1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:30.040]  This DC crew is even experimenting with bait stations laced with a new rat contraceptive.
[1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:37.040]  The traditional methods that we use doesn't work, you know, so we need something else.
[1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:39.040]  We have so many rats.
[1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:42.040]  Pepe Garcia of LA's Sanitation Bureau.
[1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:45.040]  Shouldn't the city be doing some kind of rodent control?
[1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:47.040]  It's something that we'll look into.
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:59.040]  But some say there's no time to waste, like UCLA infectious disease doctor Jeffrey Klausner, who says LA's trash and rat problem ranks right up there with the worst slums he's seen in the third world.
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:01.040]  Trash and food waste attracts rats.
[1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:09.040]  Klausner warns that rats spread not only typhus, but also dangerous strains of salmonella and even bubonic plague.
[1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:10.040]  I am so worried.
[1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:20.040]  Worried because rats carrying typhus infected fleas were found around LA last fall, according to health department emails obtained by the I team.
[1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:28.040]  The I team has learned that fleas found on some animals at LA's north central shelter tested positive for typhus.
[1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:38.040]  As the summer fleas season looms and the garbage heaps grow, so does concern that an even bigger disease outbreak could hit LA in the months ahead.
[1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:44.040]  This is serious. People get very violently sick. This is unacceptable.
[1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:54.040]  We asked Mayor Garcetti to speak with us about that trash pile on Saras Avenue and about the growing epidemic threat, but he declined to sit down with us.
[1:04:54.040 --> 1:04:57.040]  His spokesman told us we could find him at a...
[1:04:57.040 --> 1:04:58.040]  Right back.
[1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:03.040]  Mike in New Jersey. You're on the air. Thanks for calling, Mike.
[1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:07.040]  You are the man, Alex. I'm so glad to be talking to you. I'm so excited. I'm such a big fan.
[1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:12.040]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products. I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[1:05:12.040 --> 1:05:18.040]  The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth.
[1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:22.040]  Tastes like, tastes like great milkshake. You know, if you just add it to milk.
[1:05:22.040 --> 1:05:28.040]  It tastes like oval-team. It tastes like oval-team. It tastes like oval-team. Like, good.
[1:05:28.040 --> 1:05:34.040]  I feel great since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste.
[1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:40.040]  I've used the SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for that as well.
[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:44.040]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air. I'm thanking you, but yes.
[1:05:44.040 --> 1:05:49.040]  This is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[1:05:49.040 --> 1:05:52.040]  It is next level. It really is good, so thank you.
[1:05:52.040 --> 1:06:21.040]  I feel great since I've been taking it. Thank you.
[1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:31.040]  You know, lost in all the news is the fact that it's admitted that Obama and Kerry and the Democrats
[1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:42.040]  and deep statutes have been undermining U.S. policy for Iran and trying to sabotage Trump's political operations,
[1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:46.040]  which is the definition of treason. You add that to pushing open borders.
[1:06:46.040 --> 1:06:51.040]  You add that to trying to overthrow the president. You add that to this whole constellation
[1:06:51.040 --> 1:06:55.040]  of trying to sell us out on trade to China, and it's called treason.
[1:06:55.040 --> 1:06:59.040]  Well, they're the Democrats. America was never great. It'll never be great.
[1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:01.040]  They are the party that's been selling the nation out.
[1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:09.040]  Their blue cities are collapsing into piles of rats and typhoid and black plague and TB.
[1:07:09.040 --> 1:07:12.040]  But here is just a little piece of the treason.
[1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:16.040]  In a shocking new report today, we are now learning that former members of the Obama administration
[1:07:16.040 --> 1:07:20.040]  have been caught holding back channel communications with Iranian officials
[1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:24.040]  on how to defeat U.S. foreign policy under the Trump administration.
[1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:30.040]  Specifically, they've been contacting Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif.
[1:07:30.040 --> 1:07:35.040]  One American news exposed John Kerry's illegal shadow diplomacy with Zarif last year,
[1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:40.040]  when the two were caught holding secret meetings together in Paris and photos were taken up them.
[1:07:40.040 --> 1:07:43.040]  Kerry's deep ties to Zarif are well known.
[1:07:43.040 --> 1:07:48.040]  In some cases, Obama officials reportedly attended Capitol Hill meetings
[1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:52.040]  to learn information about new U.S. policies from congressional Democrats
[1:07:52.040 --> 1:07:56.040]  and then relayed that information to the Iranian government.
[1:07:56.040 --> 1:07:58.040]  This of course is in violation of the Logan Act,
[1:07:58.040 --> 1:08:03.040]  the same act that General Flynn was spied upon after Trump had been elected.
[1:08:03.040 --> 1:08:08.040]  Obama officials are desperate to rebuild the Iran nuclear deal that Trump dropped,
[1:08:08.040 --> 1:08:12.040]  and they are working with their allies in Congress to complete it.
[1:08:12.040 --> 1:08:16.040]  All of this comes at a time when the Trump administration has been successful
[1:08:16.040 --> 1:08:20.040]  in isolating Iran from many of its European allies and trading partners,
[1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:24.040]  and now in some cases even seem to isolate Iran from Syria and Russia
[1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:29.040]  by pulling Hezbollah fighters out of Syria and Russia rejecting Iran's offer
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:32.040]  to purchase a major air defense system from Moscow.
[1:08:32.040 --> 1:08:37.040]  The U.S. has also labeled the Iranian Revolutionary National Guard a terrorist force
[1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:40.040]  that sent military equipment to the Middle East with escalating tensions
[1:08:40.040 --> 1:08:42.040]  against the Islamic Republic.
[1:08:42.040 --> 1:08:49.040]  To be clear, the fact that former Obama officials are holding shadow diplomacy with Iran
[1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:53.040]  and possibly passing them information from allies in Congress
[1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:56.040]  to undermine U.S. foreign policy is shocking
[1:08:56.040 --> 1:09:00.040]  and must be investigated by AG Barr immediately.
[1:09:00.040 --> 1:09:02.040]  Let that sink in.
[1:09:02.040 --> 1:09:05.040]  For America News, I'm Jack Fisobak.
[1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:08.040]  Well, it just so happens, Jack Fisobak, as everybody knows,
[1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:12.040]  has a pipeline directly to the White House every day writing reports for him.
[1:09:12.040 --> 1:09:14.040]  He just so happens to be able to tell us this as well.
[1:09:14.040 --> 1:09:20.040]  They are not happy at this point because there is a wind on down the road, my friends.
[1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:27.040]  All right, Bob Barnes, attorney at law, writing shotgun again with us today doing a great job.
[1:09:27.040 --> 1:09:30.040]  Bill Barr, the attorney general, we've got some more clips.
[1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:32.040]  We played yesterday's, some more clips we're going to get to,
[1:09:32.040 --> 1:09:35.040]  because I was asking, there's so much happening with the censorship,
[1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:38.040]  the global government, all the things that are happening.
[1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:39.040]  But what do you want to hit first?
[1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:43.040]  You were like, well, I want to get back into the fact that they're trying to say
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:47.040]  that Barr is this traitor, that he's doing all these things with no evidence.
[1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:51.040]  When, as Trump said, we'll play this clip coming up next segment before he left England,
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:53.040]  he said the real treason's on their side.
[1:09:53.040 --> 1:09:55.040]  They're the ones with the illegal investigation,
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:10:00.040]  and the way they try to turn this around shows they're not going away.
[1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:01.040]  They're not going to quit.
[1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:02.040]  Oh, no doubt.
[1:10:02.040 --> 1:10:06.040]  I think what was key with what Barr did yesterday on CBS in his interview,
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:09.040]  parts of which got leaked different times last week,
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:14.040]  was to send the message that he will be completely unaffected by every form of attack that they could make.
[1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:16.040]  He said he doesn't care about his legacy, doesn't care about his reputation,
[1:10:16.040 --> 1:10:17.040]  doesn't care about his life.
[1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:19.040]  He said, I'll be dead soon.
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:20.040]  Exactly.
[1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:21.040]  And we all die.
[1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:23.040]  Everybody dies, as he put it famously.
[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:27.040]  He doesn't care about having a, he doesn't want to be a Homer hero,
[1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:30.040]  where they're singing songs and lyrics about him centuries later.
[1:10:30.040 --> 1:10:33.040]  So what matters to him is doing what's right now by the country
[1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:35.040]  and its democratic institutions now,
[1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:40.040]  and that requires taking out the deep state operatives that tried to do this illicit coup
[1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:42.040]  and misused and abused state power.
[1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:44.040]  And all the CBS reporters and the person in the interview,
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:47.040]  as I ended up watching the whole thing, I should say before I did the live show,
[1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:48.040]  they were shaken by it.
[1:10:48.040 --> 1:10:49.040]  No doubt.
[1:10:49.040 --> 1:10:51.040]  Because everybody gets, they all know what they did.
[1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:53.040]  They all know they got talking points.
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:56.040]  They all know the Obama CIA stayed behind and went and met with everybody from,
[1:10:56.040 --> 1:11:00.040]  you know, from Moby to Hollywood to CBS.
[1:11:00.040 --> 1:11:01.040]  They all got walking orders.
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:02.040]  Trump's a Russian.
[1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:03.040]  He's an illegitimate government.
[1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:06.040]  The real US government's under Obama and Hillary's control.
[1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:07.040]  He'll be gone soon.
[1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:08.040]  But he never was gone.
[1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:10.040]  And now they know they were lied to.
[1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:11.040]  They're freaking out.
[1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:12.040]  Oh, no doubt.
[1:11:12.040 --> 1:11:15.040]  I mean, they expected, that whole thing was sort of almost an inquisitive interview
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:16.040]  as much as it was anything else.
[1:11:16.040 --> 1:11:18.040]  It was, won't you be affected by this?
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:19.040]  Won't you be affected by this?
[1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:20.040]  Aren't you scared?
[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:21.040]  Exactly.
[1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:23.040]  Aren't you scared that we'll destroy your legacy?
[1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:25.040]  Aren't you scared that we'll destroy you?
[1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:27.040]  We'll wreck your bill, you make money.
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:28.040]  You had a great life.
[1:11:28.040 --> 1:11:29.040]  You were respected.
[1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:30.040]  What's your problem?
[1:11:30.040 --> 1:11:31.040]  They're so disconnected.
[1:11:31.040 --> 1:11:36.040]  Like when Pele, who lost his job a month later, was sitting there with Jack Pesovic.
[1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:38.040]  And no, it wasn't Jack Pesovic.
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:40.040]  It was Jack Pesovic on the mind.
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:43.040]  It was a pop in my mind here in just a second.
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:45.040]  The guerrilla mind guy, the lawyer out in California.
[1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:46.040]  Oh, Cernivich.
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:47.040]  Yeah, Mike Cernivich.
[1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:49.040]  He's on with Mike Cernivich with Teleprompter Free, folks.
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:51.040]  I got to think of names sometimes.
[1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:54.040]  And he says, but Hillary's camp said she was totally healthy.
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:55.040]  She was all down.
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:11:59.040]  And he said, but why would you believe the Democratic Party on their talking points?
[1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:04.040]  And he laughs back at Cernivich again thinking it's all a confidence game.
[1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:05.040]  It's all I'm in the suit.
[1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:06.040]  I'm CBS anchor.
[1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:07.040]  You don't question me.
[1:12:07.040 --> 1:12:08.040]  The sky's red.
[1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:09.040]  Oh, exactly.
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:11.040]  I mean, it's people who were completely accustomed.
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:16.040]  You saw a reaction to bar by CBS and now you're seeing it radioactive throughout the press
[1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:18.040]  and their reaction and what they're talking about writing today.
[1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:21.040]  The same reaction that you saw them react to Trump.
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:23.040]  Like, I mean, aren't you going to apologize?
[1:12:23.040 --> 1:12:24.040]  Aren't you going to fold?
[1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:26.040]  Aren't you going to realize that you can't do this?
[1:12:26.040 --> 1:12:28.040]  Don't you realize we'll destroy you economically?
[1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:30.040]  Don't you realize we'll wreck your reputation?
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:33.040]  Don't you realize we'll defame you and libel you to the end of days?
[1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:34.040]  And Trump's like, I don't care.
[1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:36.040]  I'm going to go forward and bar to the exact same thing.
[1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:39.040]  I said, I don't care about all the things you think you can use against me.
[1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:43.040]  I already knew you were going to try to use against me and I'm going to be unaffected by it.
[1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:48.040]  The globalists and the social engineers thought they'd intimidated America and broken our back.
[1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:52.040]  But collectively we were really asleep thinking everything was okay since the 50s.
[1:12:52.040 --> 1:12:55.040]  All of this evil out in the open now has only awakened people.
[1:12:55.040 --> 1:12:59.040]  So they try the old tactic of intimidating Trump or Barr or you or me.
[1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:03.040]  Like in some of your biggest famous cases where feds would, you know, try to arrest you.
[1:13:03.040 --> 1:13:05.040]  So you're going to prison, you wouldn't back down.
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:11.040]  They don't get that once you cross a Rubicon or an event horizon, it's a point of no return.
[1:13:11.040 --> 1:13:16.040]  It's really spiritual in my view that as a man, you just click in and it's over.
[1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:19.040]  No matter what they do, you're going to keep on the attack.
[1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:21.040]  In fact, the more they attack, the more you know you're right.
[1:13:21.040 --> 1:13:23.040]  And I think that's what's freaking them out.
[1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:27.040]  Is they're using the old intimidation tactic of old that they thought was working.
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:29.040]  No, we were asleep.
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:33.040]  That was sort of the most analogous to I see that this is like the civil rights movement.
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:42.040]  So from, you know, from 1870 to 1950 intimidation tactics work to keep people from asserting their civil rights,
[1:13:42.040 --> 1:13:44.040]  particularly in the South African American community.
[1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:48.040]  And then what happened is all of a sudden you had people recognized like Medgar Evers,
[1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:54.040]  who said the biggest fear is fear itself, that if you forfeit the fear of what bad outcome might come about,
[1:13:54.040 --> 1:13:57.040]  then you actually seize the power and have the upper ground.
[1:13:57.040 --> 1:13:58.040]  That's what King did.
[1:13:58.040 --> 1:14:02.040]  That's what the civil rights, that's what that's what all the civil rights marchers did.
[1:14:02.040 --> 1:14:06.040]  They forfeited the fear of the bad actions that might come to them by taking action.
[1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:11.040]  And by doing so, they ended up with not only the moral power, but the real power.
[1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:13.040]  And that's what Barr and Trump have been doing.
[1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:14.040]  And that's what Barr did.
[1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:19.040]  All the things you think will motivate me or deter me or discourage me or dissuade me will not
[1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:24.040]  because I forfeited the fear of what can happen to my reputation, what can happen to my legacy,
[1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:26.040]  what can happen to me financially.
[1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:31.040]  And he tells them, look, I'm retired with grandkids, but stuff's so screwed up and the deep state's still out of control.
[1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:34.040]  I got to do this because you guys are going to cause a giant civil war.
[1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:35.040]  Exactly.
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:40.040]  He cares more about the legacy of the American democracy than he does his own personal individual reputation or history.
[1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:43.040]  He's like an old school soldier, an old school patriot.
[1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:46.040]  And that and by that's what's shocking all of them.
[1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:51.040]  They're realizing that he's not only sincere, but they have all the tools and mechanisms they thought they had.
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:54.040]  They do not have to restrain him from going forward.
[1:14:54.040 --> 1:14:56.040]  That he's going to march forward no matter what.
[1:14:56.040 --> 1:15:00.040]  And you've got people like Schiff and Mueller's whole pitch was, hey, use impeachment as the counter threat.
[1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:05.040]  And instead what you had today was Schiff coming out and saying, oh, that'd be a waste of time because the Senate will never impeach anyway.
[1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:07.040]  It will look like a bunch of idiots.
[1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:10.040]  So all of a sudden they realized they have no more cards left to play.
[1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:13.040]  And now it's just going to be an onslaught.
[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:17.040]  It's literally like unleashing Godzilla and not having any resistance available to you.
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:20.040]  And that's what effectively what Barr sent the signal up.
[1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:29.040]  And Barr and Trump and M4 and all of us from little folks like us at the top, we're all launching attacks this summer politically, legislatively, legally.
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:37.040]  And all of us, whether you call in the C-SPAN or you go to a city council meeting and speak or whether you buy some products at m4store.com or whether you go and speak to your PTA meeting.
[1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:44.040]  All of you launch your political attacks on the left peacefully, lovingly, but in focused energy this summer.
[1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:47.040]  The attack is now full attack ahead of the election.
[1:15:47.040 --> 1:15:49.040]  We launch the counter strike now.
[1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:51.040]  The left's been attacking for three years.
[1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:53.040]  We now launched the counter strike politically.
[1:15:53.040 --> 1:15:57.040]  So now is the time to explode.
[1:15:57.040 --> 1:16:01.040]  Oh, these pains, my neck, my back, shoulders.

[1:16:57.040 --> 1:17:03.040]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:06.040]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:12.040]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:16.040]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:18.040]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[1:17:18.040 --> 1:17:21.040]  The Deep State began with World War I.

[1:19:55.040 --> 1:20:22.040]  This has taken on the globalist and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[1:20:22.040 --> 1:20:29.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting EWY, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:29.040 --> 1:20:38.040]  45 had this to say yesterday before he jumped on that big old jet airplane to fly over to the UK.
[1:20:38.040 --> 1:20:42.040]  There is no basis whatsoever for impeachment.
[1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:43.040]  None.
[1:20:43.040 --> 1:20:44.040]  There was no collusion.
[1:20:44.040 --> 1:20:45.040]  There was no obstruction.
[1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:47.040]  There was no crime.
[1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:49.040]  The crime was by the Democrats.
[1:20:49.040 --> 1:20:51.040]  The crime was by the Democrats.
[1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:55.040]  There was no legal basis for impeachment.
[1:20:55.040 --> 1:20:56.040]  It's a big witch hunt.
[1:20:56.040 --> 1:21:02.040]  Everybody knows it, including the Democrats.
[1:21:02.040 --> 1:21:06.040]  Trump ran for office for the first time in his life and became the president of the US.
[1:21:06.040 --> 1:21:07.040]  The guy's incredible.
[1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:10.040]  You cannot deny the stamina, the energy.
[1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:15.040]  I'm 45 and I get exhausted now by like three or four o'clock.
[1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:17.040]  I can go rest and stuff and get back to work later.
[1:21:17.040 --> 1:21:19.040]  But Trump is amazing.
[1:21:19.040 --> 1:21:21.040]  It's a godsend.
[1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:22.040]  And I'm not groveling at Trump.
[1:21:22.040 --> 1:21:26.040]  I'm very thankful to God and the universe.
[1:21:26.040 --> 1:21:35.040]  And I was getting back to this before we get back to Bill Barr, attorney general, and the amazing things happening with Bob Barnes, your constitutional lawyer,
[1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:39.040]  who's been up in D.C. a lot, has his ear to the ground.
[1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:41.040]  Earlier, I wanted your take on this.
[1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:42.040]  Then we'll play these clips.
[1:21:42.040 --> 1:21:48.040]  Do you agree with me that the country was kind of asleep and things go through those periods of sleep?
[1:21:48.040 --> 1:21:55.040]  But now there's this period of awakening and the establishment in Hollywood and the politically correct.
[1:21:55.040 --> 1:21:57.040]  They keep trying to bully to keep us in line.
[1:21:57.040 --> 1:22:00.040]  They thought the bullying is why they were in power before.
[1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:02.040]  It was because we were asleep.
[1:22:02.040 --> 1:22:11.040]  And it's their intense bullying that's actually awakening people and stealing, hardening their defiance to their tyranny.
[1:22:11.040 --> 1:22:14.040]  And I just can't believe they haven't figured it out yet.
[1:22:14.040 --> 1:22:19.040]  I mean, they are accustomed to a mindset where people just react and do what they want them to do.
[1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:24.040]  So I think that's happened ever since really starting the 80s and the 90s, particularly on college campuses, happened in the 90s.
[1:22:24.040 --> 1:22:28.040]  But the media, particularly to very young, overwhelmingly share the same ideology.
[1:22:28.040 --> 1:22:32.040]  They're accustomed from the time they're in high school that they get what they want.
[1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:37.040]  If they wanted to sort of blackmail someone effectively into going along with their ideas,
[1:22:37.040 --> 1:22:42.040]  whether it's their peer pressure in high school or college, whether it's the university regulators and administrators,
[1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:49.040]  or once they're in the media, they just threaten, hey, we'll ruin you financially, we'll ruin your reputation, we'll ruin your life unless you go along with this.
[1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:58.040]  So what it is, it's an arrested development psychology of the nation of babies, but real men are returning where it's about the chivalry and the honor and the commitment.
[1:22:58.040 --> 1:22:59.040]  It's not about what you do to me.
[1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:00.040]  Precisely.
[1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:04.040]  And they don't even know how to deal with someone who has that mentality.
[1:23:04.040 --> 1:23:06.040]  They have no idea how to react to a mindset.
[1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:14.040]  Will Chamberlain had a piece in a human event to which he's a publisher that where they're bringing back human events in the old Reagan-esque mode that it used to be.
[1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:20.040]  And his whole point was, you have these peacetime conservatives, quote unquote, who are just wooses at heart, who don't have, they're the Romney types.
[1:23:20.040 --> 1:23:21.040]  They're the campaign types.
[1:23:21.040 --> 1:23:22.040]  They always appease.
[1:23:22.040 --> 1:23:24.040]  They want to be friends with the corporate media.
[1:23:24.040 --> 1:23:26.040]  That's why you're a loser, Romney.
[1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:29.040]  The corporate media doesn't have power except over Weenies.
[1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:30.040]  Exactly.
[1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:32.040]  And his whole point is, we need wartime conservatives.
[1:23:32.040 --> 1:23:37.040]  And that's a mindset of patriots, chivalry, old school ideas, Sinatra style.
[1:23:37.040 --> 1:23:38.040]  I love that.
[1:23:38.040 --> 1:23:40.040]  We need wartime conservatives.
[1:23:40.040 --> 1:23:41.040]  Precisely.
[1:23:41.040 --> 1:23:44.040]  People with a mindset and a mentality that recognizes that we're at a war.
[1:23:44.040 --> 1:23:47.040]  And in order to win that war, you have to forfeit all fear.
[1:23:47.040 --> 1:23:49.040]  Almost like an info war.
[1:23:49.040 --> 1:23:50.040]  Exactly.
[1:23:50.040 --> 1:23:53.040]  Forfeit fear of what they can do to you personally, what they can do to you professionally.
[1:23:53.040 --> 1:23:59.040]  But I mean, for example, just when I took on this case, there was at least a half dozen hit pieces on me.
[1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:02.040]  Well, that's just the norm. They're accustomed to that having the effect of...
[1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:04.040]  And they tried to take you off the case and failed.
[1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:05.040]  You didn't make a big deal about that.
[1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:09.040]  But that's a big deal to say you don't have speech about Sandy Hook if you represent me.
[1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:10.040]  Shut up.
[1:24:10.040 --> 1:24:11.040]  Oh, exactly.
[1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:13.040]  Or that I couldn't speak about free speech in general.
[1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:18.040]  I mean, the idea and the goal was to have a sort of a one-sided gag order effectively.
[1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:21.040]  And so it is, and usually that deterrence works.
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:24.040]  This deterrence of where the press comes out and does a hit piece on you,
[1:24:24.040 --> 1:24:26.040]  like, well, I'm scared to give a hit piece.
[1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:29.040]  Like, for example, there's a good piece by Kurt Schlichter as well in Town Hall,
[1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:34.040]  where he's talking about these sort of peacetime conservatives, these sort of Wuss conservatives,
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:38.040]  who won't even have people that have been blacklisted on their TV shows.
[1:24:38.040 --> 1:24:41.040]  Won't have people that have been blacklisted by big tech and big media.
[1:24:41.040 --> 1:24:43.040]  And they don't get it as they're giving into the wave that will crush them.
[1:24:43.040 --> 1:24:44.040]  Exactly.
[1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:45.040]  There's no way to be...
[1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:47.040]  Just as there's no way to be halfway pregnant,
[1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:52.040]  there's no way to be halfway in bed with the Stasi-style mode of operations of big tech and big media.
[1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:53.040]  That just can't happen.
[1:24:53.040 --> 1:24:55.040]  You're either fighting him or you're rolling over.
[1:24:55.040 --> 1:24:56.040]  And you're forfeiting.
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:24:58.040]  I don't know why people don't get this.
[1:24:58.040 --> 1:25:02.040]  I mean, when you're being told you can't say somebody's name on Facebook like Alex Jones,
[1:25:02.040 --> 1:25:05.040]  and you're being told you can't say that there's only two genders.
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:08.040]  If there were more than two genders, which of course there aren't,
[1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:09.040]  it doesn't matter.
[1:25:09.040 --> 1:25:10.040]  You have a damn right to do it.
[1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:16.040]  That's a clear and present, incredible danger, a cult of control freaks,
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:18.040]  the likes of which the world's never seen.
[1:25:18.040 --> 1:25:20.040]  Obviously, they must be opposed.
[1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:21.040]  No doubt about it.
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:22.040]  Not a piece.
[1:25:22.040 --> 1:25:28.040]  You see people like AOC on Twitter yesterday talking about how big tech needs to make sure
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:30.040]  that they have a quote-unquote healthy conversation,
[1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:36.040]  and make sure that they get rid of these people causing fake news or disinformation.
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:41.040]  So she can say America sucks and cauliflower is racist in the world's ending in 12 years,
[1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:44.040]  and then we can't counter her a public figure.
[1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:47.040]  The most unprotected person out there is a public figure.
[1:25:47.040 --> 1:25:48.040]  A child is protected.
[1:25:48.040 --> 1:25:52.040]  A public figure lady, you are not just in a man's world.
[1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:55.040]  You are in the damn gladiatorial arena.
[1:25:55.040 --> 1:26:00.040]  You climbed in there with Mike Tyson, and then you want him tied up in the corner
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:01.040]  so you can piss on him.
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:02.040]  It's not going to happen.
[1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:03.040]  Oh, precisely.
[1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:05.040]  And it shows the mindset and the mentality of these people.
[1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:08.040]  So you see it now, like with YouTube launch,
[1:26:08.040 --> 1:26:10.040]  claiming they're going to investigate Steven Crowe.
[1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:11.040]  What is it?
[1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:12.040]  Here's that article.
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:15.040]  In fact, I went and looked at the video that's being flagged by this Fox guy
[1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:18.040]  that called for us to be taken down, and it's like he's God or something.
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:21.040]  And it goes, well, Vox says, you made fun of me.
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:22.040]  I'm gay.
[1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:23.040]  They didn't even do that.
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:24.040]  But so what if they did?
[1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:25.040]  You know, it's I'm queer.
[1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:26.040]  I'm here.
[1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:28.040]  And if you talk about me, I'll sue you.
[1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:29.040]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:31.040]  And it's the same mindset.
[1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:34.040]  Well, for example, Axios did an interview with Jared Kushner where they were back on the
[1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:39.040]  idea that any criticism of Obama concerning where he was born was racist.
[1:26:39.040 --> 1:26:41.040]  But in fact, that originated as a criticism of John McCain.
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:43.040]  That didn't originate as a criticism of Obama.
[1:26:43.040 --> 1:26:47.040]  And the criticism of Obama originated from the Clinton camp within the Democratic process.
[1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:49.040]  Not anybody on the Republican side.
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:51.040]  Just like Hillary created the whole Mercer type of thing.
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:52.040]  Exactly.
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:54.040]  It's creating immunity based on status.
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:59.040]  It's OK if I'm African-American or if I'm woman or if I'm gay, if I'm disabled,
[1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:01.040]  suddenly you can't talk about me at all.
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:02.040]  Then you're a protected group.
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:03.040]  Well, here's the thing.
[1:27:03.040 --> 1:27:04.040]  But only if you have the right ideas.
[1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:08.040]  I investigated this Vox guy, hops around going, I'm queer.
[1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:09.040]  I'm queer.
[1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:12.040]  And then so Crowder says, OK, well, the self-described queer.
[1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:15.040]  Now he goes, oh, no, only I can say I'm queer.
[1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:16.040]  You can't use the magic word.
[1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:18.040]  It's literally thought police.
[1:27:18.040 --> 1:27:19.040]  It's pathetic.
[1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:22.040]  I mean, Crowder is not exactly a radical dramatic guy.
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:25.040]  He's in the Mark Dice sort of comedic school of conservative thought.
[1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:28.040]  He's not out there really doing anything that controversial at all.
[1:27:28.040 --> 1:27:33.040]  And if he's being targeted by Google's YouTube, then you get a sense of what the problem is.
[1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:36.040]  Well, they're just moving on to the next person.
[1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:37.040]  Yes.
[1:27:37.040 --> 1:27:39.040]  Because they need to stand up for Alex Jones and then Paul Watson.
[1:27:39.040 --> 1:27:41.040]  Paul Watson, a hate figure.
[1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:42.040]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:27:42.040 --> 1:27:45.040]  Someone too dangerous to allow in the public arena.
[1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:49.040]  And it's using that sort of language and that sort of lingo and that sort of approach.
[1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:56.040]  They just have a mindset that's a collectivist mindset that's rooted in weakness in terms of their ideas
[1:27:56.040 --> 1:27:58.040]  and actually confidence and belief in their...
[1:27:58.040 --> 1:28:00.040]  And what they are is incredible authoritarians.
[1:28:00.040 --> 1:28:03.040]  And they're in these bubbles where they think you shouldn't have speech.
[1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:06.040]  I mean, you're filed on in court saying you don't have speech.
[1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:07.040]  Just shut up.
[1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:12.040]  Exactly. It's a mindset that they've grown up in a safe space culture that produces...
[1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:14.040]  That they think a hip piece and a smear piece will work.
[1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:15.040]  That's why it gets... I mean, when you have...
[1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:18.040]  By the way, the Vox guy has been working for years to get Crowder off here.
[1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:19.040]  He helped get us off.
[1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:21.040]  And so he's a salting Crowder.
[1:28:21.040 --> 1:28:23.040]  Crowder does nothing back and he goes,
[1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:26.040]  Well, I haven't gotten you taken down so you're attacking me.
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:28.040]  This is a big tech, big media collusion.
[1:28:28.040 --> 1:28:31.040]  Oh yeah, this guy got $200 million to run Vox.
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:33.040]  Oh, I mean, that's how much money...
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:34.040]  And Vox is still losing money.
[1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:36.040]  Vox is not doing well at all.
[1:28:36.040 --> 1:28:37.040]  It's not...
[1:28:37.040 --> 1:28:38.040]  And that's why they want Crowder off.
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:43.040]  Exactly. They want big tech, big media to collude to stop the audience from getting to choose what new media they have.
[1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:47.040]  That's going to still give you an audience if you take us all off you morons.
[1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:50.040]  It's going to get your asses busted up in the antitrust action.
[1:28:50.040 --> 1:28:52.040]  But just wait.
[1:28:52.040 --> 1:29:17.040]  See you authoritarian dirtbags.

[1:32:56.200 --> 1:33:01.040]  lowered the price.
[1:33:01.040 --> 1:33:09.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:09.400 --> 1:33:39.280]  It was last year that the Islamic Caliphate commando, Sadiq Khan, who literally has said
[1:33:39.280 --> 1:33:43.240]  women should cover themselves up in London, who covers up the knife attacks, works for
[1:33:43.240 --> 1:33:49.640]  the jihadis, said that Trump shouldn't be allowed into the UK. What an authoritarian.
[1:33:49.640 --> 1:33:59.720]  What a monster. Now here's some of his comments about Trump just today.
[1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:04.120]  President Trump, if you're watching this, your values and what you stand for are the
[1:34:04.120 --> 1:34:08.880]  complete opposite of London's values and the values in this country. We think diversity
[1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:13.200]  is not a weakness, diversity is a strength. We respect women and we think they're equal
[1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:17.920]  to men. We think it's important to safeguard the rights of all of us, particularly the
[1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:22.360]  vulnerable and the marginalised. When you are the president of the USA, you have a massive
[1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:26.120]  leadership role. You have a massive platform as well. People follow what you do. What we've
[1:34:26.120 --> 1:34:29.960]  seen over the last few years in the USA is a rolling back of much of the progress made
[1:34:29.960 --> 1:34:34.160]  in previous decades. It's really important we continue to move forwards. What is seen
[1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:39.840]  in the USA is a rolling back of the reproductive rights of women. We've got a situation now
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:44.720]  where some states in the USA are making it almost impossible for women to have the right
[1:34:44.720 --> 1:34:49.520]  to have an abortion. We're only here to look at the history books to realise the consequences
[1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:53.120]  of women having the right to choose over their own body. What we can't afford to do is return
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:57.400]  to backstreet abortions. What we can't afford to see is a return to the situation in the
[1:34:57.400 --> 1:35:05.640]  last decades where you had women having no control over their bodies. It's really important
[1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:07.280]  we support women in the USA.
[1:35:07.280 --> 1:35:11.440]  So you can have acid attacks on women in England all over the world exploding. You can have
[1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:15.080]  their genitals being cut off. You can have all this. He's an Islamist, but then he's
[1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:22.520]  this leftist like AOC and Ilhan Omar at the same time praising Venezuela, praising all
[1:35:22.520 --> 1:35:27.280]  of it. And again, cancelled Donald Trump's state visit says to eat connet or London attack
[1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:32.600]  tweets pointing out they were Islamic attacks. So this guy's a real authoritarian.
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:36.360]  Well, no doubt about that. I mean, also you have the sort of rape gangs that were being
[1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:41.040]  covered up that sort of outraged so many people in the United Kingdom. It's sort of really
[1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:46.080]  what put Tommy Robinson on the map more publicly was the fact that that had been covered up.
[1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:50.320]  So you have, I mean, I think the president's description of con is very good. He's basically
[1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:56.320]  de Blasio, but a lot shorter. That's very apt. That's who con is he's an inept and an
[1:35:56.320 --> 1:36:01.400]  ineffective mayor. His main primary job was to keep the city secure, keep the city safe.
[1:36:01.400 --> 1:36:05.560]  That has badly failed. They've had a way of they've had a rave, a wave of knife attacks
[1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:09.520]  throughout the city that have been unsolved and unresolved. When I was there just in November
[1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:12.960]  and December, there was heightened security concerns. I was talking to people that were
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:17.440]  old school leftist throughout the city, and they were very bothered by what was happening.
[1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:22.640]  They were bothered by the degree of John Cleese is leaving. There's an exodus out and why
[1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:28.000]  everywhere the left controls things to city suddenly degenerate the giant piles of rats
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:32.480]  and fleas and knife attacks and acid attacks and people defecating everywhere. It's just
[1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:36.560]  not an effective model. In other words, it's much like statism and communism. I mean, with
[1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:41.680]  statism, it just failed sooner or later. Statism in the form of fascism failed. Statism in the
[1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:46.400]  fail in the form of communism failed and statism in the form of sort of backdoor politics and
[1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:50.160]  mediocre political machine politics. It's not like old school machine politics in the
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:54.160]  in the 1900s in the United States, where you really had the working class tied into governmental
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:58.720]  control. This is the professional class running these cities, and they just failed completely
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:04.560]  and abysmally. And we've got the junior senator from Missouri shooting up the ranks, pointing
[1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:09.040]  out that the right wing needs to stop being elitist. He's been more populist like Trump,
[1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:14.960]  but beyond Trump, we need to really get back to average people and jobs and our country itself
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:21.520]  and not worshiping the establishment, not parlaying America into some larger global vision of America
[1:37:21.520 --> 1:37:27.440]  hating elites. That's the truth. It's very popular. It's a pro human future, and we need to adopt it.
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:31.760]  Oh, no doubt. I think what is the the a lot of the attacks on the Info Wars audience is because
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:35.440]  the Info Wars audience was at the tip of the spear for the political revolution that we've
[1:37:35.440 --> 1:37:40.000]  seen now all across the United States and Western Europe. By the way, you you ahead of some lawsuits
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:44.720]  and things have been doing some big demographic studies with top firms. Why don't you tell folks
[1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:49.200]  what we found about the Info Wars audience? Sure. The Info Wars audience has a strong overlap with
[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:53.680]  Trump's original core audience. It's disproportionately populist oriented audience,
[1:37:53.680 --> 1:37:58.960]  an audience that had for frequently checked out of American politics. And so the fact
[1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:03.280]  that the Info Wars audience re in people that knew it was controlled, who's now activated
[1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:08.000]  against they know it's on. Exactly. They saw in Trump the capacity to make a meaningful difference
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:13.120]  again. Then so they re engaged in the political process and re engaged across the board really
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:16.720]  as a smart Americans that knew what was going on are back in the game because now
[1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:21.840]  it's a little bit more level. Yeah, they now actually have a real voice. I mean disproportionately,
[1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:25.440]  this was an audience that recognized that their voice was not being listened to that you had the
[1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:30.000]  elites. You basically had a competition between whether big government or big corporations run
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:34.400]  your life prior to Trump. It was very much economic elites ran the Republican Party,
[1:38:34.400 --> 1:38:38.640]  cultural elites ran the Democratic Party. Both of them were against middle America. Both of
[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:43.680]  them were propagating stupid and foolish wars for crazy reasons. Both of them were propagating
[1:38:44.480 --> 1:38:50.080]  control and surveillance techniques using social media to suppress thought using social media to
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:55.040]  surveil mass populations. That's what their goal and objective was. And the independent populist
[1:38:55.040 --> 1:38:59.760]  America that built the American ideal that built the American dream that kept the flame of liberty
[1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:05.920]  alike over the past 200 years was fading until Trump came on the scene and through your audience
[1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:11.760]  was able to connect to ordinary Americans in a unique and revolutionary way and create a basically
[1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:17.680]  overturn the entire deep state apparatus and win an election against the most institutionally corrupt
[1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:24.000]  candidate maybe in American history. And by the way, she was supposed to be the winner. They printed
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:28.400]  hundreds of thousands of madam president and put this out. That's why they're so pissed. But even
[1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:34.880]  when Trump won the deep state, the bureaucracy continued to operate as if she and Obama and
[1:39:34.880 --> 1:39:41.520]  to a certain extent like Joe Biden are these triple heads of this dragon that we're actually still
[1:39:41.520 --> 1:39:46.320]  fighting. And no doubt because they had so much control within the administrative part of government.
[1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:51.280]  The old construct of the deep state is a dual state. They have all these administrative hacks
[1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:55.200]  who control the everyday operation of government against the elected branch. And so you had all
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:39:59.120]  these people that were underneath Trump who were daily undermining Trump and embassies around the
[1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:03.200]  world within the State Department, within the Justice Department. That's why they put Mueller
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:07.520]  in place. So you're a smart guy. I want to hit a bunch of others as we come back. As their power
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:13.760]  runs out, as they know they're losing, as Trump goes on the offense, what are they going to do now?
[1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:18.400]  Because their stay behind networks have got to know they've already lost. They admit Trump's
[1:40:18.400 --> 1:40:23.680]  going to win in 2020 unless they impeach. That's in their own analyst words. So what are they going
[1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:28.240]  to do? Try to implode the border, try to kill the economy, Federal Reserve's going to make moves,
[1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:33.600]  the chai comms are making moves. But Americans now get, even if the economy gets bad, hey,
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:37.760]  Trump went to bat, we're in a fight. So when you're in a fight, you might get your nose broken.
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:41.040]  But you know what? You're going to win the fight in the end. I think the global's keep going.
[1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:45.520]  You want all your money kind of like Bill Barr. You know, we could ruin your life. He's like,
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:48.960]  you already are ruining it. I didn't want to have to do it. It's because you're such a thug.
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:53.040]  I've got to do this. They don't get like, we're ready to get our nose broken. We're ready to get
[1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:57.040]  arms and legs broken. We don't want it. But believe me, while they're trying to break our
[1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:01.200]  nose politically, they're going to get their brains bashed up. And I think as a whole, their
[1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:04.640]  first option is impeachment. But the problem with impeachment is as Schiff admitted today,
[1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:07.600]  they're going to lose in the Senate. So it'll just be a waste of time and effort.
[1:41:07.600 --> 1:41:09.680]  Exactly. So the walls are closing in. What are they going to do?
[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:14.800]  The next option is what they are doing is trying to invade the privacy of the president. Anybody
[1:41:14.800 --> 1:41:18.960]  connected to the president with these invasive subpoenas, but the US Supreme Court should step
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:23.520]  in at some point and stop that from happening. So once that doesn't happen, they no longer
[1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:28.320]  have any legitimate power left. So you're going to see sabotage efforts undermining the North Korean
[1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:32.640]  peace process. You have people wishing and hoping that the economy collapsed like Bill Maher talked
[1:41:32.640 --> 1:41:36.880]  about some time ago. That's going to come back. You're going to see probably more celebration
[1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:40.960]  of Intifa and street violence to encourage it and invite it. It's going to be street violence.
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:45.120]  You're going to see a continuous effort to sort of scapegoat the political right and the populist
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:48.640]  right. It's already happening in certain intellectual circles. So there's a publication
[1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:54.000]  called Quillette that was established to be sort of a cross heterodox intellectual academic publication
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:58.800]  for people outside of the progressive left. But they're already writing hit pieces on Dave Reuben
[1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:03.920]  and other people solely for the purposes of purging the populist, the national populist wing
[1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:07.120]  of the intellectual wing from their publications. So they're already trying to do that.
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:14.240]  Oh, I mean, two weeks ago, a turd bag over young turds, he had the founder of Antifa on that's
[1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:18.160]  called and the guy said, we're getting ready for a violent overthrow. Our forces are prepared
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:21.920]  and they're just on TV preparing for their big attack. I mean, it's incredible. They're going
[1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:25.200]  to keep attacking people's reputations. They're going to keep attacking people economically.
[1:42:25.200 --> 1:42:28.320]  They're going to continue to attack people in the judiciary. They're going to get the deep
[1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:32.960]  state is continue to leak against the president. But they are on the back foot there and they
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:37.360]  have the low ground. The president has the high ground. And with a general like bar, he has the
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:42.560]  meaningful ability to make meaningful change. And if we ride that tail wave, we can we agree.
[1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:46.480]  But we need Soros watch. We need the young Turks watch. We need that Antifa leadership
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:50.960]  watch because they're going to use Antifa as the decoys for the real paramilitary attack
[1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:54.160]  on the president and their American Republic reboot leadership.
[1:42:54.160 --> 1:43:13.520]  Okay, it's true. I stayed up late last night. So I had half the turbo force this morning.
[1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:33.680]  So
[1:43:43.520 --> 1:44:01.040]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[1:44:01.040 --> 1:44:06.280]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[1:44:06.280 --> 1:44:09.160]  literally dumbs the population down.
[1:44:09.160 --> 1:44:13.320]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've
[1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:16.080]  gone through two permutations.
[1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:20.200]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the globalists
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:24.800]  tried to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure
[1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:28.200]  nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been incredible.
[1:44:28.200 --> 1:44:33.360]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:35.600]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:40.080]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:46.160]  three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes
[1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:49.560]  it even more bioavailable.
[1:44:49.560 --> 1:44:52.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[1:44:52.720 --> 1:44:53.720]  discovery.
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:45:20.120]  Next three, now available at m4slife.com.
[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:23.040]  This is Nazi Germany level, this is racketeering.
[1:45:23.040 --> 1:45:24.040]  This is cartels.
[1:45:24.040 --> 1:45:28.440]  Mr. President, we need your help, we need it now.
[1:45:28.440 --> 1:45:30.080]  You can take on Big Tech.
[1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:36.520]  They saw Info Wars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[1:45:36.520 --> 1:45:39.040]  populist organization.
[1:45:39.040 --> 1:45:43.760]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him
[1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:47.040]  off the air, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[1:45:47.040 --> 1:45:51.960]  The way to fight back is to support Info Wars now more than ever and make it a standard
[1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:53.800]  of freedom and free speech.
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:46:00.080]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[1:46:00.080 --> 1:46:02.800]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air, thanks for calling Mike.
[1:46:02.800 --> 1:46:06.640]  You are the man, Alex, I'm so glad to be talking to you, I'm so excited, I'm such
[1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:07.640]  a big fan.
[1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:10.800]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products, I got to do a shoutout
[1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:12.320]  for the bone broth.
[1:46:12.320 --> 1:46:18.000]  The bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth.
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:22.600]  It tastes like, tastes like, great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:27.200]  It tastes like oval theme, it tastes like oval theme, it tastes like oval theme, like
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:28.200]  good.
[1:46:28.200 --> 1:46:29.200]  Whoa.
[1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:33.200]  I feel great since I've been taking it, my daughter uses the bubblegum, fluoride-free
[1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:34.200]  toothpaste.
[1:46:34.200 --> 1:46:39.400]  I've used the SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for
[1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:40.400]  that as well.
[1:46:40.400 --> 1:46:43.480]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air, I'm thanking
[1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:47.960]  you, but yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[1:46:47.960 --> 1:46:51.960]  the turban broth, it is next level, it really is good, so thank you.
[1:46:51.960 --> 1:47:01.960]  I feel great since I've been taking it, thank you.
[1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:29.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:35.920]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host, Bob Barnes, constitutional
[1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:40.080]  lawyers riding shotgun with us, we're going to get in the big enchilada here in a moment.
[1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:45.160]  What made Trump finally announce antitrust probes of big tech that's already lost him
[1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:49.160]  $137 billion since it was announced a few days ago, we're going to cover that here in
[1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:51.640]  a moment and the next stage of this.
[1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:56.200]  Yeah, American farmers are going to get hurt by the trade war with China, other industries
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:47:58.840]  to be hurt, but we're finally standing up, we're in a fight.
[1:47:58.840 --> 1:48:04.120]  We've been in a war, we've been getting our ass kicked for 40 years, it stops now, but
[1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:08.800]  the left side, you can get your nose bloody, you can get your arm broken, we already know
[1:48:08.800 --> 1:48:14.240]  that, and so stop telling us all day how we got our ass kicked, all it does is piss us
[1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:15.240]  off.
[1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:20.280]  I can't wait to see what the leftists do when they lose because you can smell the fear,
[1:48:20.280 --> 1:48:25.000]  you can smell the defeat, you can also smell the hubris still, they've been doubling down
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:26.440]  forever and winning.
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:30.680]  Listeners, the only reason we're on air is because of you.
[1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:36.040]  You are incredible, you are amazing, I salute you, I thank you, but we really make it easy
[1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:37.040]  to support the broadcast.
[1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:46.240]  One of the only true independent media operations in the world, Vox gets $200 million a year
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:50.760]  to go out and police the internet and ban conservatives and ban nationalists and ban
[1:48:50.760 --> 1:48:55.400]  Christians and ban gun groups and ban veteran groups and they're just treated as if they're
[1:48:55.400 --> 1:48:56.400]  dead.
[1:48:56.400 --> 1:49:08.440]  In the last four years, since HBO bought it, Vice has been given over $5 billion, $5 billion.
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:13.480]  Hundreds and hundreds of millions extra a year just from Soros to keep them afloat.
[1:49:13.480 --> 1:49:18.440]  Despite that, they're going bankrupt, they're collapsing, no one's watching it, no one wants
[1:49:18.440 --> 1:49:24.640]  to watch the head of Apple tell us what the big liberal is, no one wants the dime a dozen
[1:49:24.640 --> 1:49:27.520]  liberal trendies to hop around and talk about how they're oppressed.
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:31.760]  You're not oppressed, we're not even looking at you, you're so damn boring.
[1:49:31.760 --> 1:49:37.080]  People want authentic, they want Americana, they want the real thing, even if it's ugly,
[1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:38.240]  they want real.
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:43.520]  They keep trying to figure out what the magic sauce is, the secret sauce dumbasses, I must
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:50.000]  tell us the audience, tell us the leftist, it's that people want the real McCoy.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:53.440]  So we make it easy to support the broadcast, we've got one of the biggest sales in a long
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:58.280]  time that must end today, I promise you it's gone tomorrow, less than 24 hours left to
[1:49:58.280 --> 1:50:00.760]  renouncing some new specials tomorrow.
[1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:12.360]  This new special is 60 to 40% off all of our bestselling supplements at importwarstore.com
[1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:18.440]  and I'm just going to tell you this again, we don't compete with drugs, drugs compete
[1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:22.480]  with us and there are a lot of amazing drugs and a lot of good pharmaceuticals, a lot of
[1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:26.680]  bad ones, there's a lot of great cars, a lot of bad cars, a lot of great women, a lot of
[1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:31.000]  bad women, a lot of great houses, a lot of bad houses, a lot of great sunsets, a lot
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:36.520]  of ugly sunsets, you know, if you're a woman, a lot of great men, a lot of bad men.
[1:50:36.520 --> 1:50:45.520]  But the point is, is that InfoWars can sell $40 million worth of product and we don't
[1:50:45.520 --> 1:50:50.800]  mark up products five, six times, we put real value into it, in fact I was just in a meeting
[1:50:50.800 --> 1:50:57.880]  two days ago on, three days ago on Saturday and I said how did this happen and they said
[1:50:57.880 --> 1:51:03.360]  you said put the very best in it and the market research guy, we're finally getting
[1:51:03.360 --> 1:51:08.200]  into marketing, said yeah but the average, you know, multi-pack, two dose a day thing
[1:51:08.200 --> 1:51:14.360]  is like $35 and we learned maybe $5 of products in the whole thing and the box cost a dollar
[1:51:14.360 --> 1:51:22.720]  so that's like $6 but you put, you put $25 into the eight pack power stack, $25 for
[1:51:22.720 --> 1:51:30.600]  the pills alone, these are highest in and then our marketing guy, smart guy bitched
[1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:35.440]  at me, he said hey you barely talked about it because it's not selling and it's our
[1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:42.960]  new flagship product that's AM and PM, 13 different pills, four new formulas and then
[1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:48.560]  the other basic vitamins that supercharge it and I'm like I don't have time to get
[1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:53.040]  into it, you know it's got 100% reviews right now for people that research it but no I can't
[1:51:53.040 --> 1:52:00.040]  sell it for $30, like leading competitors because there's $25 in product and I bought
[1:52:00.040 --> 1:52:04.840]  a million dollars of it that comes in over the next year.
[1:52:04.840 --> 1:52:09.040]  This is one of the top three manufacturers in the country because we go to the highest
[1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:12.960]  in manufacturers to have our stuff done, obviously we want the highest in for you plus we know
[1:52:12.960 --> 1:52:17.800]  we're targeting it tested so we tested after they do all the testing so that jacks the
[1:52:17.800 --> 1:52:24.840]  price even more, I forgot testing on top of $25 a box and I'm just telling you nobody
[1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:30.080]  does that folks, the highest in stuff out there might have $5 of product in it and vitamins
[1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:37.560]  with God gave us are so incredible that it'll do good for you, this has $25 in a box, that's
[1:52:37.560 --> 1:52:51.000]  what it cost me $25 so yes it's $59.95 that's 50% off so I'm not going to belabor this
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:58.640]  all day I'm just going to tell you we've got the best products period and we're proud
[1:52:58.640 --> 1:53:04.160]  of them and I go to these companies and I tell them put the best in there and then later
[1:53:04.160 --> 1:53:08.640]  I turn back and I go maybe I should have put $10 in there that had been better than anybody
[1:53:08.640 --> 1:53:13.440]  else then I charge $30 and make money and we're great it's a philosophy I don't have
[1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:18.800]  cold blooded scientific manipulation like everybody else I just go with my red blood
[1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:25.240]  and that's where I'm at in this but these specials in tomorrow and they're amazing
[1:53:25.240 --> 1:53:30.440]  and the eight pack power stack is what gets people to habituate like myself to put it
[1:53:30.440 --> 1:53:34.760]  in your lunch box and the habit at home before you go to bed at night the AM and PM two different
[1:53:34.760 --> 1:53:38.920]  packets to a day because then you don't forget to take it which is the biggest problem for
[1:53:38.920 --> 1:53:42.800]  people like me and you so I'm really proud of the eight pack power stack I don't have
[1:53:42.800 --> 1:53:47.920]  an hour to go through the four new formulas and all the rest of it but it's amazing and
[1:53:47.920 --> 1:53:51.640]  I appreciate your support not much time left in this segment we've got this segment on
[1:53:51.640 --> 1:53:58.760]  the next for our next guest joins us Bob Barnes attorney at law getting into the inside baseball
[1:53:58.760 --> 1:54:07.240]  your meetings at CPAC your meetings in DC my similar meetings that confirm that we've
[1:54:07.240 --> 1:54:11.000]  been telling people Trump's about to go on the offense you were getting into the fact
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:18.720]  that the last straw really was Facebook banning certain names in certain terms that really
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:23.600]  pushed Trump over the edge and now human events is riding on it it's now being confirmed
[1:54:23.600 --> 1:54:27.720]  by Bloomberg you want to talk about this this is pretty big to show Trump's thinking just
[1:54:27.720 --> 1:54:32.600]  to show how real he is exactly in other words had they simply not made the choice to ban
[1:54:32.600 --> 1:54:37.640]  your name from their platform and had not made the choice to try to go after and censor
[1:54:37.640 --> 1:54:42.200]  people saying anything positive about Alex Jones or info it would not have led to the
[1:54:42.200 --> 1:54:47.400]  antitrust investigation and just the announcement of the investigation and the possibility was
[1:54:47.400 --> 1:54:54.280]  going to go into Facebook as well cost them $137 billion that's how much money was lost
[1:54:54.280 --> 1:54:59.400]  by big tech by choosing to go after you that's how much the president cost them just by announcing
[1:54:59.400 --> 1:55:06.720]  the possibility of an investigation $137 billion collectively lost across big tech in less
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:12.160]  than a day solely because they decided to come after you not recognizing that the president
[1:55:12.160 --> 1:55:16.240]  was going to stand by his audience was going to stand by his people and was going to stand
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:19.720]  by the original principles of free speech and free press that govern and guide this
[1:55:19.720 --> 1:55:25.160]  country and because of it now they've lost tons of money so ultimately don't be surprised
[1:55:25.160 --> 1:55:31.280]  of coming down the pipeline will be your stockholder actions that may be part of an ongoing that
[1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:36.600]  may be part of a whole set of litigation coming up this summer to sort of ride the tail wave
[1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:41.000]  of what is happening in the tailwinds of what is happening by the president and to go go
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  behind what the Attorney General Barr is doing and notice they tried to spend it all YouTube
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:49.120]  is the reason this happened no it's because you're spying you're selling data you're
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:54.000]  censoring people you got caught lying to Congress that's why you're in trouble and you're only
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:58.120]  going to get in more trouble because you've abused your monopoly which monopolist always
[1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:02.960]  do and you've worked with other monopolies to form combines and cartels and oligopolies
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:08.280]  which they always in their final phase cartels form out of the monopolies but but but it's
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:13.600]  just so amazing that they can't stop and they won't back down because Google even had press
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:18.680]  conferences internally to their members saying oh my god Hillary lost we won't let this happen
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:22.320]  again right exactly I mean all they had to do is hear the president meets with Jack at
[1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:26.480]  Twitter there's a there's a of all these problems that already been documented by that point
[1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:30.000]  saying look just pull back don't meddle in the election don't continue to suppress and
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:33.280]  censor speech and they would have been able to save their stockholders over a hundred
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:37.000]  billion dollars but they refused they decided they're going to go after they're not spending
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:41.320]  it because we cut off the fake news we lost money no it's because you're censoring and
[1:56:41.320 --> 1:56:45.320]  antitrust investigations have been opened up on you precisely there would be no antitrust
[1:56:45.320 --> 1:56:49.240]  investigation if they weren't engaged in any antitrust illicit activity when they decided
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:53.720]  to go from just being a technological monopoly on a platform and instead be a technological
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:56:58.760]  monopoly on speech on press and on elections they made a decision that was a faithful decision
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:02.520]  that has now cost them billions of dollars will cost them billions of dollars more in
[1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:06.640]  the future and now they're under major antitrust investigation and it's not going to stop at
[1:57:06.640 --> 1:57:10.480]  Google it's going to keep going and it's going to expand to Facebook it's going to expand
[1:57:10.480 --> 1:57:15.560]  to other operations and again they've been riding high since the 80s where we said leave
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:20.400]  it alone let it grow so we dominate globally but as soon as Apple and Google said screw
[1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:27.600]  America familiarity breeds contempt we love the Chinese we want to work at the chai comms
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:32.080]  because that's their ideology when the billionaires ran off to get married to the chai com dragon
[1:57:32.080 --> 1:57:37.160]  that's when the real system over here finally woke up and said we've got to do something
[1:57:37.160 --> 1:57:43.000]  and the final straw was undercutting the president's main base show you want to fight boys at
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:50.920]  silicon valley you better believe you got one it's never been easy to figure out the

[2:00:14.200 --> 2:00:25.880]  transmission you are the resistance look at social media to think old free speech rights
[2:00:25.880 --> 2:00:34.280]  you look at google facebook twitter and other social media giants and i've made it clear
[2:00:34.280 --> 2:00:42.720]  that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship blacklisting and rigged search
[2:00:42.720 --> 2:00:51.880]  results and you know it can go the other way also into this house for throne into this
[2:00:51.880 --> 2:00:58.560]  world with so that's what's happening is it's political meddling it's election meddling
[2:00:58.560 --> 2:01:06.760]  it's violating political speech the most protected type constitutional lawyer robert barns here
[2:01:06.760 --> 2:01:10.840]  with us getting into this you told me about this days ago from your sources in dc i have
[2:01:10.840 --> 2:01:15.320]  similar sources that the last straw for trump wasn't just me getting banned my name getting
[2:01:15.320 --> 2:01:20.280]  banned was paul watson particularly and now they've lost a hundred thirty seven million
[2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:26.400]  in two days at facebook and google over this and and the trump is coming this is a big
[2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:30.680]  deal oh no doubt about it the they made a massive mistake you're seeing bloomberg talk about
[2:01:30.680 --> 2:01:36.680]  the possibility that all of these big social media tech giants might be taken apart might
[2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:42.120]  be wiped off the map might be basically forced to dissolve and forced to separate out its
[2:01:42.120 --> 2:01:46.840]  assets in the same way that rockefeller was in with with standard oil back at the turn
[2:01:46.840 --> 2:01:50.720]  of the century so i think what's happening is there's now the u.s. federal trade commission
[2:01:50.720 --> 2:01:55.720]  has now announced that facebook has agreed to subject itself to any trust investigation
[2:01:55.720 --> 2:02:01.120]  the the google antitrust investigation was leaked on friday there's talk that it will
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:04.760]  go further than facebook and google and they're looking at twitter they're looking at netflix
[2:02:04.760 --> 2:02:09.840]  are looking at other operators so these operators that decided to be so overtly political over
[2:02:09.840 --> 2:02:14.040]  the last two years that they're going to use their tech monopoly their platform monopoly
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:19.640]  to suppress censor speech to shame individuals to leak private information against them to
[2:02:19.640 --> 2:02:24.040]  used and leverage their power to help the democrats take the house to help the democrat
[2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:29.320]  win the senate in 2017 threatening to do so the same in 2020 when they reached the point
[2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:33.000]  where not only they banned people from using your name and info wars name and at the same
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:40.040]  time banned paul joseph watson from all facebook and instagram overnight when he they had
[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:45.640]  agreed he hadn't violated any rule ever was such a shock that it's what put the president
[2:02:45.640 --> 2:02:51.280]  motion he realized okay this is too severe so severe action needs to be taken let's unleash
[2:02:51.280 --> 2:02:56.960]  the the kraken of antitrust enforcement against these rogue operators who think now they get
[2:02:56.960 --> 2:03:01.400]  to control and govern the country and get to impose a chinese social credit model system
[2:03:01.400 --> 2:03:05.800]  on the united states democracy and speech systems and that's why this is happening and wall
[2:03:05.800 --> 2:03:11.440]  street is responding when you see this kind of massive one day half day stock drop it's
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:16.000]  a message that wall street got the message investors got the message the political people
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:20.720]  got the message these folks are going to pay a real consequence and and what the point that
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:25.600]  will chair that will chamberlain and others were making is imagine that one guy paul joseph
[2:03:25.600 --> 2:03:30.480]  watson in london that was the final straw that broke the camel's back cost just facebook
[2:03:30.480 --> 2:03:35.200]  uh 40 billion dollars today cause the white house is a fan of paul i'm not going to get
[2:03:35.200 --> 2:03:39.800]  into the old detail but i mean that everybody knows paul's it's a funny happy guy and there's
[2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:44.200]  like this is this is it's the point is it's not going to stop right oh i mean they didn't
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:48.000]  just kick him off facebook they said he's dangerous he's evil and by the way the white
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:52.600]  house knows since obama was in they have this whole interpol system which they're so freaked
[2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:56.000]  out they haven't announced it yet because it hurt the banking system because it's so discrediting
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:59.960]  imagine saying black people can't use credit cards they have a plan where conservatives
[2:03:59.960 --> 2:04:04.440]  can't use credit cards it was even in reuters two weeks ago that the nr a won't be able
[2:04:04.440 --> 2:04:09.320]  to use cards that they're hiring a southern poverty law center group to be a quote human
[2:04:09.320 --> 2:04:16.480]  rights commission at visa and mastercard to oversee what individuals are buying and doing
[2:04:16.480 --> 2:04:21.080]  to punish you if you support conservatives i mean they're so they want to abuse the big
[2:04:21.080 --> 2:04:25.960]  tech system not an increments but out of the gates and that's really woken up people oh
[2:04:25.960 --> 2:04:29.920]  no doubt and what it does is what's in would just made it clear that their objective is
[2:04:29.920 --> 2:04:33.840]  purely political because here they admitted that they had no violation whatsoever of any

[2:07:49.280 --> 2:07:53.680]  becoming the public square and they control how we interact with each other and if you
[2:07:53.680 --> 2:07:57.240]  think that you are going to throw up your hands and say well they're private companies you
[2:07:57.240 --> 2:08:01.720]  are absolutely insane and you are part of the problem you are a bad person you should
[2:08:01.720 --> 2:08:06.040]  be censored off the internet bad yes but get out of here alex info wars might have been
[2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:09.760]  banned from from twitter but it seems to have found a new home over at trump's twitter feed
[2:08:09.760 --> 2:08:17.000]  president trumps furious reaction to facebook's action showcases that he is i'm sorry to say
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:25.080]  but info wars president info wars the most banned network in the world how dangerous

[2:09:00.920 --> 2:09:07.760]  with patriots in the federal government now on this next subject and i wanted bob to ride
[2:09:07.760 --> 2:09:12.600]  shotgun with us some because he's got some views on this i remember like two years ago
[2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:16.480]  two and a half years ago doctor's room coursey that used to do some work here with us i've
[2:09:16.480 --> 2:09:22.240]  been interviewing him for like 18 years was like oh this qanon this is a good thing you
[2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:27.720]  know this is people inside the us intelligence and they're giving us all these little fortune
[2:09:27.720 --> 2:09:33.080]  cookie type deals and these i guess like uh pressure hunt type deals it was just kind
[2:09:33.080 --> 2:09:37.240]  of fun and some of the stuff in there you know i agree with whatever but you know i'm
[2:09:37.240 --> 2:09:40.760]  talking to the president and you're talking to folks in the white house and you know i'm
[2:09:40.760 --> 2:09:44.520]  going and having meetings with us intelligence right and reports law firms to the president
[2:09:44.520 --> 2:09:48.840]  you know i'm actually watching it on the news the next day and i'm being come after everything
[2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:54.080]  you know and and and then i would then just see qanon which would just be rams of internet
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:59.160]  say jones works for the israelis uh while he'll be in jail soon trumps out to get him
[2:09:59.160 --> 2:10:05.720]  but i tell you that jeff sessions he's a good guy and so is that uh so is that uh special
[2:10:05.720 --> 2:10:12.280]  counsel will have jones dealt with soon enough that enemy of trump meanwhile you know get the
[2:10:12.280 --> 2:10:17.520]  miss more phone calls from the president than i've been able to take but then you know i
[2:10:17.520 --> 2:10:20.080]  heard this is a pretty good book i haven't read the whole thing and i've scanned over
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:26.760]  it and i just want to find out what is qanon has anyone ever met the magical like pixie
[2:10:26.760 --> 2:10:31.880]  or leprechaun or thing that does this because i've been on air 25 years i've got hillary
[2:10:31.880 --> 2:10:36.040]  clinton suing me 20 something times to shut us down you know the globalist credit us and
[2:10:36.040 --> 2:10:40.160]  our audience were getting trouble-elected but then if i could you know find this fount
[2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:45.640]  because you know the president tweets our stuff out but there's a q even in the stuff
[2:10:45.640 --> 2:10:50.800]  that's texted out then it's the total proof that that this is the this is the headwaters
[2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:56.920]  this is the progenitor this is the moses on the mountain this this is everything and it
[2:10:56.920 --> 2:11:01.840]  says not this book but but whoever q is because q could be anybody you know i get the question
[2:11:01.840 --> 2:11:07.720]  years ago decade ago why are you for anonymous and i said anonymous to be anybody you want
[2:11:07.720 --> 2:11:11.760]  i'm for people having free speech i'm for people being anonymous but anonymous is anybody
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:16.520]  who wants to put on a guy fox mask put a video on the internet oh yeah so so so my thing
[2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:24.160]  is hey i'm not enemies with this q thing course he got deep into it and then said oh it's
[2:11:24.160 --> 2:11:27.680]  terrible it's saying we're bad because it's all this infighting over the magical holy
[2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:31.920]  grail of i mean it doesn't matter you talk to the president doesn't matter you go confront
[2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:38.040]  sidic uh you know in the head of the google sundar and congress none of what you've ever
[2:11:38.040 --> 2:11:45.920]  done matters because if you don't have the blessing of that magic sky opens angels descend
[2:11:45.920 --> 2:11:52.240]  and the q forms you don't have that it doesn't matter your 10th generation texan it doesn't
[2:11:52.240 --> 2:11:59.200]  matter your family in the 1776 because this is more important than trump this is god this
[2:11:59.200 --> 2:12:04.120]  is king jesus no one's ever seen it no one knows what it is but it's got to be bowed
[2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:10.480]  down to show here's the thing i'm ready to bow down to it i'm ready all i'm saying is
[2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:16.800]  i have no credibility i just talked to the president i just write reports to the president
[2:12:16.800 --> 2:12:22.240]  the president just tweets my stuff out i this has the credibility so joining us is roi davis
[2:12:22.240 --> 2:12:27.400]  who is a nice guy from the q movement and and and so he captain roi is a proud father
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:32.080]  two boys and grandfather he's retired from the travel industry and lives on his boat
[2:12:32.080 --> 2:12:36.480]  in florida he's a us merchant marine officer holding masters captain ready with the us coast
[2:12:36.480 --> 2:12:44.000]  guard and dhs homeland security he's a reddit original poster and q scribe again i'm not
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:49.120]  put it down i don't know this i'm gonna learn the magic author and patriot roi's the best
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:55.720]  selling co-author of q anon an invitation to the great awakening the book was the second
[2:12:55.720 --> 2:13:00.640]  bestselling book on amazon the first on censorship and politics category his new book is directed
[2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:05.440]  lieutenant general michael flan and a good percentage of every book sold the right towards
[2:13:05.440 --> 2:13:10.720]  that so thanks for joining us captain roi davis and i'm being serious we want to break
[2:13:10.720 --> 2:13:15.760]  here in a few minutes you've got the floor but just just did i not properly worship
[2:13:15.760 --> 2:13:20.240]  q or because i'm not an israeli agent and i do talk to the president and our audience
[2:13:20.240 --> 2:13:26.720]  did help get him elected how do i become worthy to even suck the toes of q alex it's not that
[2:13:26.720 --> 2:13:31.880]  official really and again we're not looking to be confrontational we're just you mentioned
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:35.800]  earlier in this program and i was glad i was listening because you said that a lot of times
[2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:40.960]  the the the folks are looking for the truth the secret sauce and what we're here to say
[2:13:40.960 --> 2:13:48.000]  is that myself and thousands of anons feel like we finally found real mccoy somebody
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:56.440]  that was going to be able to drop truth informational we call them drops but it gives us a chance
[2:13:56.440 --> 2:14:01.840]  to look behind the curtain and really the genesis of this book it really was with with
[2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:06.800]  twelve associates of mine we all took a chapter it came out you'll appreciate this it came
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:11.440]  out of censorship and being banned we we just had a little group we're not trying to convert
[2:14:11.440 --> 2:14:15.360]  anybody we're just trying to let people know what we found and you can choose to believe
[2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:18.960]  it or not we're just reporting what we found and we feel like we found the real mccoy
[2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:24.040]  in the chanboards some true insider that's giving us the the skinny about what's happening
[2:14:24.040 --> 2:14:29.320]  and not the the mockingbird media lies and i want to be clear because i'll have you on
[2:14:29.320 --> 2:14:33.480]  for ten hours over the next month at the bottom of this i'm really on because i respect course
[2:14:33.480 --> 2:14:39.520]  seat yes went with us and some of what i saw q shane was in league what i got i think people
[2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:43.640]  then on the inside sort of did start leaking some things under it using it as a symbol
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:48.040]  so i think a lot of what q has said is real all i'm telling you is it got hijacked by
[2:14:48.040 --> 2:14:52.880]  a bunch of people saying trump hates me and i'm an israeli agent and none of that's true
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:57.440]  well no it really wasn't you know it wasn't really hijacked and i was explaining this
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:03.040]  to darien i said this to some other people is that the the network and no one has talked
[2:15:03.040 --> 2:15:08.560]  to q and there's no communications outside of the the board is a group of people that
[2:15:08.560 --> 2:15:14.400]  that are our military intelligence background and they've been asked to give this information
[2:15:14.400 --> 2:15:19.520]  out it's not classified information it's just little tidbits of truth and in pointing people
[2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:24.040]  in the right direction and nothing magical about it we've just stumbled across this and
[2:15:24.040 --> 2:15:28.600]  we're just reporting what we found now not everything is is uh a hundred percent accurate
[2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:32.400]  but uh we're just doing the best well you seem like a genuine nice smart guy and people
[2:15:32.400 --> 2:15:36.000]  that tell me they read your books that's great i'm going to read it i've just been so busy

[2:20:26.560 --> 2:20:32.480]  all right alex jones here broadcasting live worldwide in defiance of the globalist attempt
[2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:36.520]  to shut us down thanks to the audience spreading the word you're beyond the resistance you're
[2:20:36.520 --> 2:20:41.800]  the heart and blood and guts and bone and fist and brains and eyeballs of this whole
[2:20:41.800 --> 2:20:48.040]  damn operation so i'm going to read this book this weekend i got it a few weeks ago i read
[2:20:48.040 --> 2:20:53.880]  the q anon stuff and it's a bunch of as we all as one goes we all go and you know look
[2:20:53.880 --> 2:20:59.480]  for the magic stuff figure out what it means if it gets people thinking about politics
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:04.520]  and about behind the scenes and about not just one dimensional it's healthy my issue
[2:21:04.520 --> 2:21:13.360]  is people saying they were q anon saying jeff sessions is good alex jones is bad trumps
[2:21:13.360 --> 2:21:16.760]  got it all under control and i know for a fact he's fighting for his life we're starting
[2:21:16.760 --> 2:21:22.400]  to turn the corner that that's where i got frustrated and i know bob barns constitutional
[2:21:22.400 --> 2:21:29.160]  lawyer has some points on this and why he thinks the q anon thing is so uh you know important
[2:21:29.160 --> 2:21:34.720]  i just know i go out to like trump rallies and i'm shaking almost every hands a listener
[2:21:34.720 --> 2:21:39.160]  except every 20th hands like alex i used to like you but is it true what q says about
[2:21:39.160 --> 2:21:45.120]  you what did you say well i saw a message board saying saying you're really bell hex
[2:21:45.120 --> 2:21:51.800]  or whatever and i'm just like i'm like i understand that q is the holy one i i just
[2:21:51.800 --> 2:21:56.080]  have had the president on and on record talk to him and get him reports and you know do
[2:21:56.080 --> 2:22:01.440]  all this but but but but how do i become a holy one but but i understand your your book
[2:22:01.440 --> 2:22:06.040]  an invitation to the great awakening the renaissance that's something i promote so we appreciate
[2:22:06.040 --> 2:22:13.480]  roi davis katlin roi davis at gmail dot com bestselling book on amazon i mean who can
[2:22:13.480 --> 2:22:20.360]  speak for q anon has anyone met this person or or what's your what do you want to say
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:26.000]  about it no alex said nobody's ever met q and i did probably nobody will it's a team
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:30.080]  of people and and no one's even spoke to q all all the communications are just through
[2:22:30.080 --> 2:22:34.120]  the chan boards originally for chan alate chan and that's the way it's set up it's
[2:22:34.120 --> 2:22:39.840]  just a an informational drop it's a that's all it is it's an insider and and and and
[2:22:39.840 --> 2:22:43.680]  thousands have been following us for a year and a half and we feel it's a valid insider
[2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:47.680]  and there's there's no special grace needed and the one thing you have to bear in mind
[2:22:47.680 --> 2:22:54.120]  is that this is a public board and what we've learned over the course of this journey is
[2:22:54.120 --> 2:22:58.520]  that not everything that's put up there is either intended for it for strictly for the
[2:22:58.520 --> 2:23:03.560]  anons or or intended for the the good people a lot of the times it's put up there for misinformation
[2:23:03.560 --> 2:23:08.560]  for deceptive reasons just like you said you watch the board the enemy watches the board
[2:23:08.560 --> 2:23:12.480]  and that's that's part of the whole thing is that it's not all spelled out and certainly
[2:23:12.480 --> 2:23:15.800]  we know president trump that i mean one of the first things he's told everybody is he's
[2:23:15.800 --> 2:23:21.080]  never going to dictate his plans he's never going to forecast what he's going to do and
[2:23:21.080 --> 2:23:25.240]  again part of that is the art of deception the art of the deal what have you and again
[2:23:25.240 --> 2:23:29.240]  that's the way the board works there's no one person that speaks for it this is information
[2:23:29.240 --> 2:23:33.720]  that flows freely publicly and we're just some people have dedicated some time into
[2:23:33.720 --> 2:23:38.680]  figuring out what's going on and just conveying that to the public okay let's say cues real
[2:23:38.680 --> 2:23:44.760]  a team of it's just one person in government with all his other deals i have a former cia
[2:23:44.760 --> 2:23:49.880]  section chief son with breaking down plans to overthrow the president i have him i have
[2:23:49.880 --> 2:23:54.560]  former you know full bird kernels that ran huge black op ops saying hillary was shipping
[2:23:54.560 --> 2:23:59.160]  missiles into syria and they killed the ambassador and two years later it all comes out as true
[2:23:59.160 --> 2:24:06.400]  no one cares when i've got like former section chief or former commander it's like whatever
[2:24:06.400 --> 2:24:14.040]  we have q and it says you're a trader and i'm just sitting here looking at this so i
[2:24:14.040 --> 2:24:18.680]  can't follow it all the time have you see how do you win q how do you know what it's
[2:24:18.680 --> 2:24:23.320]  on four channel h hand that it is the q person because i've seen some smart things said by
[2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:28.600]  who they said was q but how do you even know all this and then and then have you seen the
[2:24:28.600 --> 2:24:35.040]  lord and savior of the highness supreme king of kings the actual q say that i'm this horrible
[2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:39.040]  person who's about to be arrested for treason against frump because i i get these calls
[2:24:39.040 --> 2:24:44.640]  that the lord q has said that i'm bad well there's a lot of misinformation out there
[2:24:44.640 --> 2:24:48.040]  alex i mean for one i could tell you and i've seen every post there's never anything mentioned
[2:24:48.040 --> 2:24:51.720]  about bill hicks so you know somebody told you that that was in there they've been giving
[2:24:51.720 --> 2:24:55.160]  you false information trying to pin it on us and i can see these youtube videos of the
[2:24:55.160 --> 2:24:59.400]  hat million views of guys going i used to like alex jones till i learned he was a trader
[2:24:59.400 --> 2:25:06.600]  from q and so i'm just i'm trying okay so those are q and pretenders to the q throne
[2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:11.320]  well it's it's not even a throne alex this is just a a movement of millions of people
[2:25:11.320 --> 2:25:15.200]  and there's no real leader and i think it's built that way and i think a lot of people
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:19.560]  are trying to grasp about how we can bottle this how we can get this all who's the spokesperson
[2:25:19.560 --> 2:25:23.400]  it's it's really saying his brother i've read some of your book it looks good you seem like
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:27.520]  a nice guy like i've had the president on i've had a whole bunch of conversations with
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:32.600]  the president but our listeners got him elected so this is tail wagging the dog we were real
[2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:37.800]  people like like but hold on i'm an american patriot all i'm saying is is that i'm here
[2:25:37.800 --> 2:25:43.360]  i'm a real person my name is alexander jones i've been here 25 years i'm real and so when
[2:25:43.360 --> 2:25:47.960]  i just hear people saying that this holiness has said that i'm bad i want to just find
[2:25:47.960 --> 2:25:53.320]  out what who the holiness is well alex there's been there's been a year and a half and i think
[2:25:53.320 --> 2:25:57.800]  what happened a while back if we're talking about late april or may i mean i mean i would
[2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:04.280]  i knew jerry coursey before before q i come from the jfk movement um that that i think
[2:26:04.280 --> 2:26:10.320]  jerry coursey what what it said some things that were toxic to the to our point of view
[2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:15.400]  and again as you know i mean he did a 180 so again i'm not trying to talk out of school
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:19.320]  or talk bad about anybody else he just changed his mind and now i hear you and course he's
[2:26:19.320 --> 2:26:24.480]  suing me and i'm not going to get into it for no reason so i i agree i just respected
[2:26:24.480 --> 2:26:29.480]  him and said okay q must be back as he said and maybe when i attack q than other people
[2:26:29.480 --> 2:26:33.360]  in q's name attack me i mean if i'm wrong i'll say it well it's not your question be
[2:26:33.360 --> 2:26:37.440]  right we're just trying to all move forward this is everybody and i was talking to everybody
[2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:43.480]  that is q is 100 behind our president trump i mean so everybody here's on the same team
[2:26:43.480 --> 2:26:46.560]  and it's well that's good news let's talk about it when we come back you don't have the four
[2:26:46.560 --> 2:26:50.280]  to break that down because i want to move forward because i'm i mean i think i'm known
[2:26:50.280 --> 2:26:54.760]  for 25 years i've talked to president i'm a patriot you know and i just want to know
[2:26:54.760 --> 2:26:59.440]  out there that i think the left me of hijacked q your constitutional lawyer what's your take
[2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:03.560]  on this briefly well i mean i think some of the interesting things that maybe he can answer
[2:27:03.560 --> 2:27:07.880]  is i'm i've been a q skeptic from day one and there's a wide range of reasons for that
[2:27:07.880 --> 2:27:11.480]  i respect the people who want to do their own independent inquiry and want to come to
[2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:17.200]  their own conclusions i'm skeptical of anything that was suggesting that either trump had more
[2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:22.320]  control than they didn't recognize the degree of threat that the president faced we do have
[2:27:22.320 --> 2:27:26.680]  exactly we do have a real dual state in the country that the president does not control
[2:27:26.680 --> 2:27:31.080]  and that is a constant continuous threat to the president i was particularly critical
[2:27:31.080 --> 2:27:36.840]  when aspects of the q crowd was suggesting that either sessions or huber were in control
[2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:41.120]  when my view was they were not based on my experience in the criminal defense field and
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:44.320]  and now of course turned out we wouldn't bar wouldn't need to be there and wouldn't need
[2:27:44.320 --> 2:27:48.640]  to be stepping in and hiring other people if huber had been doing anything over the last
[2:27:48.640 --> 2:27:53.200]  two years of consequence um but i respect the sincerity of the people that are involved
[2:27:53.200 --> 2:27:58.720]  in the q concerns my concern was that that some of that was being misled and misdirected
[2:27:58.720 --> 2:28:03.120]  to believe things were safer than they really were to believe that julien assange was in
[2:28:03.120 --> 2:28:07.440]  a better position than he really was there was part of the q movement that thought that
[2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:12.880]  julien assange oh yeah drudge even picked up our story from coursey that that he was
[2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:17.520]  going to be flown out to switzerland and i tried to call coursey coursey says q says
[2:28:17.520 --> 2:28:23.640]  and i said man stop going with what q says correct and i don't want to feed drudge bs i've never
[2:28:23.640 --> 2:28:28.240]  done that in my life precisely and and the other important part is i think you know in
[2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:31.360]  dealing with people in the tax protest movement other movements have dealt with people that
[2:28:31.360 --> 2:28:34.440]  they get they get the point is stay there when you come back i had so much credibility
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:40.240]  then because i'd never screwed yet drudge over that i think drudge probably halfway
[2:28:40.240 --> 2:28:45.120]  looks at me a little sconce now rightfully so because he linked to coursey saying that
[2:28:45.120 --> 2:28:51.040]  assange is being flown next week to switzerland it wasn't true it wasn't real and it burned

[2:34:02.280 --> 2:34:09.160]  about qanon and all of this because you know it became this huge phenomenon i remember being
[2:34:09.160 --> 2:34:14.760]  three years ago at the rnc about a third of the shirts rimful wars dot com and hillary
[2:34:14.760 --> 2:34:18.680]  for president shirts are shirts and you know i go to the trump rise about 10 percent 15
[2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:23.760]  percent are now and the other 50 percent are qanon and a lot of folks will shake my hand
[2:34:23.760 --> 2:34:27.880]  and like me but others look at me and they say you know too bad you're going to president
[2:34:27.880 --> 2:34:34.520]  q said so you're saying people might have told me wrong whatever it is on the internet
[2:34:34.520 --> 2:34:38.600]  thinks the guy that the mainstream media thinks got trump elected is the enemy and i've got
[2:34:38.600 --> 2:34:44.680]  to be shut down so that's why i'm just interested in it why would trump put all those tweets
[2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:49.600]  out supporting implores and saying we're good and saying we don't doctor video and tweeting
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:55.640]  our and saying he's so proud so happy to see our work is that like some super slick q thing
[2:34:55.640 --> 2:35:00.440]  a code let folks know i'm the bad guy no i think we're all on the same side alex i think
[2:35:00.440 --> 2:35:04.720]  it just got a skewed a while back with the course coursey controversy if you ask me
[2:35:04.720 --> 2:35:10.000]  and again i'm you're on the page with me boy let me tell you so so so so so send me interrupting
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:15.040]  give us your q view then well you were talking about where to start in the book here i i'll
[2:35:15.040 --> 2:35:18.800]  tell you because all all my articles are about political corruption that'd be right right
[2:35:18.800 --> 2:35:23.520]  in your wheelhouse my my chapter there in that book was was called the characters of obama
[2:35:23.520 --> 2:35:28.400]  gate the good the bad the ugly a little bit of a Clint Eastwood theme and what i did is
[2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:33.520]  i have about 200 articles that deep dives on all these characters and i picked that five
[2:35:33.520 --> 2:35:38.240]  good guys like admiral rogers mike flin i picked that five medium people and then i picked
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:42.800]  that five of the real bad guys like sorosus and hillary clinton's and such and i didn't
[2:35:42.800 --> 2:35:46.600]  read that part of your book and i agree with what q has said who the good guys are admiral
[2:35:46.600 --> 2:35:52.360]  rogers help blow the whistle when he was president elect he did a great job i think there's aspects
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:56.760]  that i mean i think the biggest concern people had was that you had within the q movement
[2:35:56.760 --> 2:36:01.480]  a lot of very intelligent people a lot of very sincere people a lot of very dedicated people
[2:36:01.480 --> 2:36:05.960]  and the fear was or the worry was that they would that there are great skills and collective
[2:36:05.960 --> 2:36:12.440]  talent and collective voices would be detoured on agendas that were not consistent with protecting
[2:36:12.440 --> 2:36:18.600]  the right hold exactly it basically eliminated from the public debate and dialogue about
[2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:23.880]  issues about julia massange issues about deep state issues because there was part of the
[2:36:23.880 --> 2:36:28.520]  q movement that was giving this impression of safety and security that said don't worry
[2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:32.120]  all of its planned out you don't have to worry about whether sessions is doing his job you
[2:36:32.120 --> 2:36:35.400]  don't have to worry about whether huber is doing anything at all you don't have to worry
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:40.520]  about whether the president is under constant continuous threat of de facto blackmail and
[2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:44.800]  extortion to engage in unnecessary wars and military conflicts you don't have to worry
[2:36:44.800 --> 2:36:48.560]  about whether julien massange will spend the rest of his life in the bottom of a prison
[2:36:48.560 --> 2:36:53.320]  cells somewhere at supermax when from said if you got it release it absolutely none
[2:36:53.320 --> 2:36:57.160]  of that what julien assange did was expose the corruption of hillary clinton let's be
[2:36:57.160 --> 2:37:00.760]  clear that's the only reason why you ever got prosecuted oh same reason we're under attack
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:04.360]  is because we stood against the little dear madam president and i started seeing so-called
[2:37:04.360 --> 2:37:09.000]  q and on people saying oh don't worry jones will be arrested soon trump knows when they
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:13.720]  actually had a justice department deal open trying to arrest me so that i was seeing concerted
[2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:19.160]  effort using q and on's name in stuff no one would know so i'm like oh he does have intel
[2:37:19.160 --> 2:37:23.720]  but he's working for the democrats the well the what happened in my interaction was people
[2:37:23.720 --> 2:37:27.480]  that were part of the q community were emailing me asking me about whether or not there are
[2:37:27.480 --> 2:37:32.120]  military tribunals in guantanamo how would that work legally and jurisdictionally and i pointed
[2:37:32.120 --> 2:37:36.280]  out it said that's just not happening obama's not being picked up and arrested the bush family's
[2:37:36.280 --> 2:37:41.080]  not being picked up and arrested deep state people historically have never faced the consequences
[2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:44.520]  of their bad act trump can't even get legal stuff through without the court's challenging
[2:37:44.520 --> 2:37:47.640]  so let's go back to our guests you made some good points and i'll have you back for a full
[2:37:47.640 --> 2:37:51.320]  hour just for you to talk the great awakening the book people should get it at amazon where
[2:37:51.320 --> 2:37:56.280]  we're also want to get it and he makes some good points from what i've read the book well actually
[2:37:56.280 --> 2:38:00.600]  actually alex i'm the reason i was initially talking to darry is in a couple weeks i'm coming
[2:38:00.600 --> 2:38:05.400]  out with my own personal book which is going to be about spy gate and we're real thrilled about
[2:38:05.400 --> 2:38:10.680]  that just trying to do the all the characters are going to be appearing here as the d class and some
[2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:19.720]  of the fiza information is led out to the public um but to answer mr barnes uh let's look at mr
[2:38:19.720 --> 2:38:26.120]  uber you talked about john uber a special prosecutor out of utah um now i granted that the attorney
[2:38:26.120 --> 2:38:31.080]  general bar just cleared up that uh that he initially had taken a look at everything and
[2:38:31.080 --> 2:38:36.280]  then he stepped back until horowitz could do the things and then at this point uh bar is assigned
[2:38:36.280 --> 2:38:41.400]  all the fiza stuff to durham but but but what they mentioned it and and attorney bar attorney general
[2:38:41.400 --> 2:38:46.280]  bar mentioned this is that uber's been working on the clinton foundation from day one so that's
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:51.320]  since november 17 that he's been doing the clinton foundation and so i say let's just give it some time
[2:38:51.320 --> 2:38:55.800]  before we say that there's been absolutes or nobody's done anything what one of our adages
[2:38:55.800 --> 2:39:00.840]  is future proofs past and and this is a long game alex especially you know people like myself have
[2:39:00.840 --> 2:39:08.840]  been fighting since the dalas 63 for for truth um let's give it a time you know and i'm not saying
[2:39:08.840 --> 2:39:14.600]  that well should i get the history history repeats so right and then you just change that adage
[2:39:14.600 --> 2:39:19.160]  but what about people that say it's like cult account says as we one go we all go or give us
[2:39:19.160 --> 2:39:23.640]  some of the other adages because they just seem like rewrites of other things well the our title
[2:39:23.640 --> 2:39:28.360]  that that we used we picked because it was the this first book that we did was a clabbered effort by
[2:39:28.360 --> 2:39:34.280]  12 of us is that we used a old john f kennedy saying which is where we go when we go all it not
[2:39:34.280 --> 2:39:40.120]  only was on his personal yacht bell and i have some affinity to the to the water but uh it was also
[2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:45.400]  mentioned in in white squall jeff bridges used that the term and actually they brought in a dummy
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:50.680]  bell and used the bell it's just a saying and it goes back to president kennedy and it's more of a
[2:39:50.680 --> 2:39:54.840]  collective effort to you remember back in the 60s he was just trying to get us all together as a
[2:39:54.840 --> 2:40:00.040]  country there are many hands make light work and i think that's just been a resurgence it's just like
[2:40:00.040 --> 2:40:04.040]  make america great again we're trying to bring back some of the old ways and certainly sure so
[2:40:04.040 --> 2:40:09.880]  how does it work because you say you never heard how do you know who it's the real q on the
[2:40:09.880 --> 2:40:17.080]  channels because you say the real q says i'm not this evil person well people in q's name say i am
[2:40:17.080 --> 2:40:22.760]  so let me just say q then let's say for sake of argument q is it knows what q's talking about
[2:40:23.320 --> 2:40:30.840]  the actual q doesn't say i'm bad alex again a lot of stuff has been said either way and again i
[2:40:30.840 --> 2:40:35.400]  think you're concentrating on something back in april may that course he was involved with it
[2:40:35.400 --> 2:40:39.880]  i you know we're trying to you know move on i don't want to depict everything that he said
[2:40:39.880 --> 2:40:44.200]  because a lot of the stuff they've said is misinformation just like i said about i personally
[2:40:44.200 --> 2:40:50.520]  believe mr barnes that sessions is actually gonna come out at the end of us being a very good guy
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:54.760]  when we see everything he's done behind the scenes again we got to give a lot of this stuff time to
[2:40:54.760 --> 2:41:00.600]  play out there's been no bob did you say that i mean my view is a much more skeptical view of
[2:41:00.600 --> 2:41:04.200]  sessions and the reason for that is i mean for example i understand everybody wanting to believe
[2:41:04.200 --> 2:41:08.840]  that john huber huber was doing good activities two things i know sessions of modus operandi when
[2:41:08.840 --> 2:41:14.600]  he was a united states attorney um and the second part is with huber irs criminal investigations
[2:41:14.600 --> 2:41:18.840]  is what was purportedly happening with the clinton foundation the reason why congressman meadows
[2:41:18.840 --> 2:41:23.800]  called that committee investigation is because he knew huber wasn't doing anything the i knew that
[2:41:23.800 --> 2:41:28.360]  if it was an irs criminal investigation in the clinton foundation uh there's about a 99
[2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:33.160]  percent chance i would have heard about it because irs criminal investigations i do more of than
[2:41:33.160 --> 2:41:37.400]  almost anything else i do figure correct exactly and because of the nature of that case
[2:41:37.400 --> 2:41:41.160]  because of the way iris criminal investigations work who they subpoena who they reach out to
[2:41:41.160 --> 2:41:44.760]  i've i've been involved in a bunch of iris whistleblower cases on both sides of the aisle
[2:41:45.800 --> 2:41:49.480]  there's almost no chance that huber is doing any meaningful investigation beyond
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:53.880]  looking at some pieces of paper uh he didn't even know basic information that the whistleblowers
[2:41:53.880 --> 2:41:57.800]  had given him that they were having to call back that's the reason why meadows was so upset
[2:41:57.800 --> 2:42:03.560]  and so i thought that part of what q was doing was meant to quiet and silence potential criticism
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:09.080]  of sessions by having some of the most informed and passionate people that were in the q movement
[2:42:09.080 --> 2:42:12.440]  misdirect their energies and that's where some of the concern came from so let me ask this
[2:42:12.440 --> 2:42:19.560]  question is we got a break you finish up after uh captain roe d yes sir how do you know when it is
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:23.800]  the real moses from the mountain the real tablets how do you know on four ten eight
[2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:30.200]  chan this is the the the q it's like pit chain it's it's they they have trip codes and it's
[2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:36.040]  just like the same encryption with bit with with with the bitcoin that it's encrypted and it's only
[2:42:36.040 --> 2:42:39.800]  one one person can have that number and that's how we've tracked it for last year and a half
[2:42:39.800 --> 2:42:44.360]  it's so four chan or eight chan whoever runs those boards they could never fake that they're
[2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:50.280]  they're a little sweetsies as as well as as the experts say alex and again it hasn't been no one
[2:42:50.280 --> 2:42:54.600]  else has come up with the dupe being able to duplicate their own numbers so again you know
[2:42:54.600 --> 2:43:00.520]  i'm not saying that shut down our speech we're at info wars dot com and news wars dot com and we're
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:05.320]  defeating the leftist tyrants i got mob on the streets by fans but almost all of us said we used to

[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:04.760]  research or interesting book uh q and on an invitation to the great away thing let me ask
[2:48:04.760 --> 2:48:08.920]  you this question i'll take a few calls let me ask you this question i'll have you back for a full
[2:48:08.920 --> 2:48:12.040]  hour or two just to take calls and really give you the floor to talk about it more because
[2:48:12.040 --> 2:48:15.880]  i'm really fascinated a lot of folks are into this in a way i like it because it gets them looking
[2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:20.280]  for political stuff but you can look in government documents you can look at actions you can look at
[2:48:20.280 --> 2:48:25.560]  history you know instead of four-chan things i'm not in competition with four-chan but four-chan
[2:48:25.560 --> 2:48:30.280]  and eight-chan have launched a lot of famous hoaxes the okay symbol being white supremacist all of it
[2:48:30.280 --> 2:48:34.200]  they got a lot of smart folks on there it's very interesting very dynamic stuff you know i'm all
[2:48:34.200 --> 2:48:41.000]  for free speech but what could this not be four-chan or eight-chan's greatest hoax where they say
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:47.880]  here's this code the mouth of god speaks from this and then everybody runs around crazily
[2:48:47.880 --> 2:48:52.840]  you know after it well what the one thing alex is it it's one thing to have the code but it's
[2:48:52.840 --> 2:48:57.720]  another to have the goodies and they've had both you know like what we've said and it doesn't matter
[2:48:57.720 --> 2:49:03.160]  if it's lionel or doug hagman or john b wells was that the goodies though well he wasn't the
[2:49:03.160 --> 2:49:09.480]  goodies when they said that robert moeller was a good guy well let's let's just say that
[2:49:10.200 --> 2:49:15.000]  some of this as i said some of this is put out there's a few people that have always been kind
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:21.800]  of a gray hat that we've not been 100 told either way you know and i'll stand with hoober and not
[2:49:21.800 --> 2:49:27.800]  to be confrontational mr barnes but yeah i believe that hoover is a good guy and that he'll he'll he'll
[2:49:27.800 --> 2:49:32.040]  come up with it with the with the goods on on the clinton find a hoover what about that standoff at
[2:49:32.040 --> 2:49:38.040]  the hoover damn what happened there that's that's it was some individual on his own and it's just
[2:49:38.040 --> 2:49:41.880]  like everything else you hate to be if you had one crazy listener you'd hate to be tagged to
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:46.200]  that no i'm not i'm just trying to he thought there was some cue message there there's a lot
[2:49:46.200 --> 2:49:50.760]  of people that have been activated as you know with your mk alter and so forth alex with all the
[2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:55.080]  history you've done there's people been activated and again they're activating people on both sides
[2:49:55.080 --> 2:50:03.320]  look all i know is the so-called cue people say that i'm not talking to trump and then all this
[2:50:03.320 --> 2:50:08.040]  other stuff's going on and boy that's that's funny then because i've talked to trump publicly i
[2:50:08.040 --> 2:50:12.600]  talked to trump privately and i just know that like everyone bows down to some anonymous deal
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:18.440]  it just gets a little weird let's go to uh lee in washington dc then carlos and a few others
[2:50:18.440 --> 2:50:26.280]  and and jump in any time i hear captain davis uh go ahead is it lee go ahead yes we're in a
[2:50:26.280 --> 2:50:31.400]  little brother i'll go ahead your phone's a little distorted go ahead with your question
[2:50:31.400 --> 2:50:36.120]  yeah sorry sorry about that you know my my main concern is that a lot of trump people
[2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:42.040]  had learned to be very skeptical of the media and learned to be very skeptical of for instance
[2:50:42.040 --> 2:50:49.000]  when a when a news story says well an unnamed source told us my concern is that cue seems like the
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:55.800]  ultimate unnamed source in fact they're saying we don't have a name on it and so my concern is
[2:50:55.800 --> 2:51:00.840]  that a lot of well-meaning people have been i hear this on the assange thing all the time
[2:51:00.840 --> 2:51:07.640]  there are people who believe in the cue thing who are saying that assange is not in belmarsh prison
[2:51:07.640 --> 2:51:14.120]  but he's in fact being in protective custody and it's simply it's simply not true but i would even
[2:51:14.120 --> 2:51:21.080]  ask what what if you're wrong if you're wrong you're misleading people if if if the interpretation of
[2:51:21.080 --> 2:51:26.920]  cue is wrong it's misleading a lot of people and i see them all the time so how does how does this
[2:51:26.920 --> 2:51:33.320]  contribute doesn't this isn't this getting people to commit exactly the same error that regular people
[2:51:33.320 --> 2:51:42.040]  make about cnn and msnbc all the time just with a pro trump's land i have a valid point sir i'm
[2:51:42.680 --> 2:51:47.800]  i back you up on that as far as misinformation but i've not seen anything that has stated
[2:51:47.800 --> 2:51:54.280]  on the boards that joy in assange is is in or out or there's any specific location this this would
[2:51:54.280 --> 2:51:58.520]  be a few people done interpretations just like few people called alex that's not what's appeared
[2:51:58.520 --> 2:52:03.080]  on the board and i guarantee you you can look at my joy in assange article that i have posted
[2:52:03.080 --> 2:52:09.160]  and there's no no such deviations i mean this has been true but it comes on my show
[2:52:09.960 --> 2:52:16.680]  does trump himself trump a cue and on board or like maybe johova is trump by it like is there
[2:52:16.680 --> 2:52:22.120]  anything in the known universe that trumps a four-chan comment is there or is that like so
[2:52:22.120 --> 2:52:27.160]  powerful that you just like like a four-chan said everyone kill yourselves we all do it
[2:52:27.800 --> 2:52:32.680]  no no no you're you're you're misrepresenting all the four-chan stuff i mean that everybody
[2:52:32.680 --> 2:52:37.640]  that we work with the cue and on people we're 100 behind president trump he's the the ultimate
[2:52:37.640 --> 2:52:43.640]  authority that's who we're all with we've we've interpreted that general flan has has has uh
[2:52:44.440 --> 2:52:49.320]  through some of his his comments and statements is that he's uh mentioned about putting together
[2:52:49.320 --> 2:52:53.240]  an army of digital soldiers and we've all interpreted that as the cue board and then
[2:52:53.240 --> 2:52:58.840]  what we've been been groomed and told to almost like info wars that cue invented like an info
[2:52:58.840 --> 2:53:05.400]  war get the public involved getting fighting for freedom uh cue yeah info invented force yeah
[2:53:08.280 --> 2:53:12.520]  exactly it wouldn't actually be real patriots involved in creating a real info war group
[2:53:12.520 --> 2:53:17.880]  thank god there's cue to tell us what it is though well i think one thing to go back to the idea that
[2:53:17.880 --> 2:53:23.080]  future uh explains the unjustifies pat prior beliefs another version of that is you know
[2:53:23.080 --> 2:53:27.720]  past as prologue from my experience i mean i'm as someone who's a political better and a political
[2:53:27.720 --> 2:53:31.640]  gambler i'm always fine with the various predictions that are made out there i always like it when
[2:53:31.640 --> 2:53:36.440]  people put money with their mouth is and at least in my experience and interface with some of the
[2:53:36.440 --> 2:53:41.240]  stronger cue components who use cue is the justification to believe things that i don't
[2:53:41.240 --> 2:53:47.480]  find to be likely to be proven true ultimately at least as it applies to moeller as it applies to
[2:53:47.480 --> 2:53:52.600]  sessions that part of the cue community that was advancing those hanamam exactly that there
[2:53:52.600 --> 2:53:56.440]  were those guys were white hats completely false there is no guantanamo cases that was
[2:53:56.440 --> 2:54:00.280]  completely false there was secret military jurisdiction completely false because at this
[2:54:00.280 --> 2:54:04.440]  point we have got to that future point because moeller is now retired we're going by the way
[2:54:04.440 --> 2:54:09.160]  we're people that actually talk to the white house so it's not like our names aren't known
[2:54:09.160 --> 2:54:12.120]  but but then i'm not putting this fellow down it's just important to cover cue and look at some of
[2:54:12.120 --> 2:54:16.600]  the good things get people thinking i'm not gonna beat him up but but but but like at what point
[2:54:17.160 --> 2:54:23.000]  do people not understand that that there's all this bonafide real stuff going on well and and
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:27.160]  the only thing i'm recommending to the cue audience is to use their same uh intellectual
[2:54:27.160 --> 2:54:32.840]  capacities and devoted passion that it to be skeptical of wherever cue is necessarily leading
[2:54:32.840 --> 2:54:39.560]  them to be so if if if cue's outcome is hey let's be less critical of sessions let's be less critical
[2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:44.840]  of aspects of the press let's be less public in defense of the sange then i would be skeptical
[2:54:44.840 --> 2:54:51.080]  of whether or not that is my next point because i noticed on the board uh lee is it from dc you had
[2:54:51.080 --> 2:55:01.160]  a point about a sange real quick for our guest oh he hung up i feel hey what do you make of a sange
[2:55:01.160 --> 2:55:05.080]  trump said if you've got the documents released and then and then and then everybody's saying oh
[2:55:05.080 --> 2:55:10.200]  a sange is great a sange is wonderful a sange reportedly is in the hospital now i just as a
[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:17.000]  citizen think trump should pardon a sange i mean what what what is a cue say cue cue's not really
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:22.120]  delved into you a lot on julian a sange you know there's just been a few cryptic drops that's what
[2:55:22.120 --> 2:55:26.360]  i said there's been nothing outlined where he is what the hospital is in it nothing this has
[2:55:26.360 --> 2:55:32.120]  been your what you're referring to his people's interpretations um i think you have to look at
[2:55:32.120 --> 2:55:37.080]  everything as a big picture alex it's just not one particular item on one particular day this is
[2:55:37.080 --> 2:55:42.200]  just a confluence of information a cue asked us to think for ourselves to to research ourselves
[2:55:42.200 --> 2:55:47.960]  to figure these things out ourselves all it is is is pointing us in the right direction um and
[2:55:47.960 --> 2:55:53.640]  letting us explore and find out the real truth now again a lot of the information we have is is
[2:55:53.640 --> 2:56:01.400]  we know right up front is is uh maybe misinformation and a lot of this is is from the beginning
[2:56:01.400 --> 2:56:07.000]  not to be revealed as far as what exactly role it'd be nice if we knew from day one a session's
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:11.080]  role it'd be nice if we knew where a sange was and everything else i mean the one thing that we've
[2:56:11.080 --> 2:56:16.760]  been with the boards with the sange it's more about seth rich we that's where we've been focusing
[2:56:16.760 --> 2:56:20.760]  on this stay there let's do five more minutes to take a few calls here uh and then and then we'll
[2:56:20.760 --> 2:56:27.960]  let jerry salante take over do a great job but we just promote americana and and cut and dry issues
[2:56:27.960 --> 2:56:33.560]  and values and ideas and that's how we get out there and change things and when it comes to just

[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:35.880]  the law never yeah i'm good friends with uh shooter genics my name robin i'm a real person
[3:00:35.880 --> 3:00:41.240]  that's been around 25 years on air everybody questions who i am and what i really stand for
[3:00:41.240 --> 3:00:46.200]  even though the personal pudding listen i want this q and on thing to be real it's great people
[3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:51.080]  have a right to whoever they want i have a right to counter it because i've gotten a lot of stiff
[3:00:51.080 --> 3:00:57.240]  criticism out of it and the biggest thing i get to someone that calls himself a q scholar
[3:00:59.560 --> 3:01:06.920]  if that's the term you use a q scribe is it's like a fortune cookie or a fortune teller
[3:01:07.720 --> 3:01:13.960]  and it's just all nebulous so i get how people's brains like that but i'm in the real world dealing
[3:01:13.960 --> 3:01:19.400]  with this stuff i know i'm not an israeli agent i know i'm talking to the president i know i'm
[3:01:19.400 --> 3:01:24.040]  coordinating with pay i mean i'm actually this is about q like i'm i'm going to dc i'm in rooms
[3:01:24.040 --> 3:01:27.960]  with real intelligence operatives that are patriots they're asking me for reports and
[3:01:27.960 --> 3:01:31.800]  ideas and you know for the president and not because i'm that important but because we're
[3:01:31.800 --> 3:01:37.720]  just brainstorming and i've got a giant audience so i'm i'm really doing the real stuff i've been
[3:01:37.720 --> 3:01:42.200]  doing in a long time and then i just watched some nebulous thing on a four-chan channel
[3:01:42.920 --> 3:01:48.440]  tell me how the cow ate the cabbage and i think that's where people get frustrated captain
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:53.480]  roy d well nobody's trying to do each other and then everybody knows you've been around a while
[3:01:53.480 --> 3:02:00.040]  alex i listen to you i'm a i'm a i'm a follower you know and there's there's um there's reverence
[3:02:00.040 --> 3:02:05.080]  and there's credit to be given for history mother i don't want reverence i'm just here to tell people
[3:02:05.080 --> 3:02:10.200]  trump doesn't want me arrested and put in wantonimo well i think it's never been on the keyboard
[3:02:10.200 --> 3:02:14.920]  that that statement you know again a lot of this stuff's been worked around and again all i could
[3:02:14.920 --> 3:02:20.120]  say is that's why it's all nebulous i tell people the president's planning to prosecute the deep state
[3:02:20.120 --> 3:02:25.240]  and do antitrust things a year ago and a month ago and then it happens i mean this is real stuff
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:29.560]  i've written the same stuff i i mean i've written the same stuff and been on duck hag many
[3:02:29.560 --> 3:02:33.560]  years ago saying the same stuff we're all on the same page alex and it's really not a competition
[3:02:33.560 --> 3:02:39.560]  we're not the competition you gotta understand is that is that i don't go out and so dissent
[3:02:39.560 --> 3:02:43.640]  with patriot leaders out there if somebody's promoting americana i have them on and back them
[3:02:43.640 --> 3:02:49.400]  yeah i mean like matt drudge the last interview he gave three years ago very reclusive was here
[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:53.800]  matt drudge is at the white house all the time advising the president what you see you think
[3:02:53.800 --> 3:02:59.240]  there's q is matt drudge real i mean is this matt drudge important now all these guys are
[3:02:59.240 --> 3:03:02.920]  important alex all these people report we're not trying to take somebody's title though
[3:03:02.920 --> 3:03:07.080]  like the last supper he'd be at the end of the table though right right no no it's not even
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:11.320]  questioning you're trying to put a hierarchy on this but i mean i've got trump on i've got matt drudge
[3:03:11.320 --> 3:03:17.080]  on i'm real i relaunch the patriot movement i'm not bragging here i'm just saying along comes the
[3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:23.160]  royalty of q and it just it tells me that i'm this anti-american and let me tell you for a lot of
[3:03:23.160 --> 3:03:28.200]  generations that's not what's been going on we've been doing a lot of stuff writing books and financing
[3:03:28.200 --> 3:03:35.000]  things and killing people for this country my family's been killing people for 240 plus years for this
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:40.200]  country brother killing people doing a lot of dangerous stuff and people come along that won't
[3:03:40.200 --> 3:03:45.080]  say who their name is and accuse me of being a goddamn russian agent i'll come after their ass
[3:03:45.080 --> 3:03:50.680]  do you understand that uh certainly i understand threats alex we've been no it's not a threat to
[3:03:50.680 --> 3:03:56.840]  you i'm telling all these shadowy people jerking their ding dongs out there that this is the real
[3:03:56.840 --> 3:04:03.320]  world this isn't a place for message boards where is where is q confronting the head of google

[3:06:11.960 --> 3:06:17.800]  jones all right again roi davis is a very nice person he's been very gentlemanly and i already
[3:06:17.800 --> 3:06:22.520]  read a few chapters of his book a lot of us good points and i thought q was healthy just to question
[3:06:22.520 --> 3:06:28.440]  things and look into things and i appreciate him coming on so i'm not mad at him i'm just irritated
[3:06:29.480 --> 3:06:36.440]  that i know what's going on the president has told me many times press the attack keep it up great
[3:06:36.440 --> 3:06:40.920]  job and i hear people claiming that on fourchan they speak for the president they don't have
[3:06:40.920 --> 3:06:44.920]  interviews with the president they don't have seen and saying it's the it's the trump uh
[3:06:44.920 --> 3:06:49.080]  informer's presidency so in closing i'll take a few phone calls here and invite you back with
[3:06:49.080 --> 3:06:53.720]  your new book coming up soon but other points about q and on and and and where this whole thing's going
[3:06:55.720 --> 3:07:00.760]  well the the boards haven't been saying that alexa i mean there's a lot of misrepresentation
[3:07:00.760 --> 3:07:04.920]  here going on i think that's all part of it is that the boards have not come out and so maybe
[3:07:04.920 --> 3:07:10.440]  the left then misrepresents q and on so q and on whoever q and on is to come out and say that the
[3:07:10.440 --> 3:07:15.480]  main street the main street media has been on us since day one i mean you there's thousands and
[3:07:15.480 --> 3:07:20.680]  thousands of negative articles i mean lester holt from nbc nightly news did a hit piece on on me
[3:07:20.680 --> 3:07:25.400]  in this book just a few months ago and i had all these calls no you're right and that's why i agree
[3:07:25.400 --> 3:07:29.880]  with q and on early on i talked to people i knew in the pentagon they said we don't know what it is
[3:07:29.880 --> 3:07:34.040]  we think of some guys that have some knowledge and maybe like a fourchan prank but at least they're
[3:07:34.040 --> 3:07:38.360]  getting the ball going that we're gonna arrest the deep state because that's the right thing to do
[3:07:38.360 --> 3:07:45.080]  and so on everybody thinking it's got everybody no i agree with that and so maybe it was coursey
[3:07:45.080 --> 3:07:51.080]  triggered at all against me i'm just sick of being a trader when i'm not well there's there's a lot to
[3:07:51.080 --> 3:07:55.240]  be said i'm not going to argue with that because i take course he's been i had problems with jerry
[3:07:55.240 --> 3:07:59.960]  coursey back in march when he blew up our first sub at reddit they call him before the storm was
[3:07:59.960 --> 3:08:03.720]  before the great awakening stuff and i don't want to put it i don't want to attack coursey he sued me
[3:08:03.720 --> 3:08:07.720]  and stuff over things i didn't do so it's all been a very very it's like eating a dirt sandwich
[3:08:07.720 --> 3:08:12.040]  it's just okay well maybe you can come to town then we can meet for a few hours too and come on
[3:08:12.040 --> 3:08:16.280]  erica's i know you're a prominent guy people respect you i just know i have been kicked in
[3:08:16.280 --> 3:08:21.160]  the teeth by q and on for no damn reason and i am not a damn russian spy that's about to be put in
[3:08:21.160 --> 3:08:25.960]  prison well one of our goals alex is that and i explained this to some other people when i said
[3:08:25.960 --> 3:08:30.280]  i was going on your show i said eventually we've got to bring all the leftist over is this one
[3:08:30.280 --> 3:08:34.680]  country we're all american so you know i i said let's just mend all the bridges and get everything
[3:08:34.680 --> 3:08:39.400]  put up put put the bed first let's start with our alt media crowd there's been a lot of people that
[3:08:39.400 --> 3:08:43.000]  have embraced us and there's been some people that've been resistant from q from no no i mean i
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:47.160]  agree with you and i i really want to find out what this is so if i've had been discharging a lot of
[3:08:47.720 --> 3:08:52.680]  uh negativity on you i apologize you've been a general i apologize to you but all the other people
[3:08:53.320 --> 3:08:57.800]  making up stuff like i got pissed off at you know congressman schiff saying i'm a russian agent you
[3:08:57.800 --> 3:09:03.240]  know i can't help but get mad when i'm accused of things i haven't done schiff will get his not to
[3:09:03.240 --> 3:09:08.280]  worry his days coming well no i mean if one thing q's been right about is these prosecutions we've
[3:09:08.280 --> 3:09:13.800]  been saying it before q existed but q's definitely right on that front let's go to carlos in canada
[3:09:13.800 --> 3:09:19.400]  you're on the air with a leading qanon scholar go ahead you're on the air i'm just a writer not a
[3:09:19.400 --> 3:09:28.440]  scholar i'm just a writer thank you alex um on the question of q um i am a scientist by training
[3:09:28.440 --> 3:09:34.360]  and i have also like you uh uh been reading history well since i was 18 years old
[3:09:34.360 --> 3:09:40.200]  non-deer colored conspiracy and so you know that so i find that uh when i heard of q for the first
[3:09:40.200 --> 3:09:45.720]  time i was interested and i said okay what is this and i looked into it and the claim was made
[3:09:45.720 --> 3:09:54.040]  that that it was a source claiming to have a top secret clearance now when i heard that i said that's
[3:09:54.040 --> 3:10:00.520]  a fact then let's this is reliable that's good let's listen to it the question is how do you
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:06.680]  establish over time whether the source claiming to have a top clear top secret clearance is giving
[3:10:06.680 --> 3:10:15.720]  people factual evidence or not i've found that i wasn't getting the thesis supported by the evidence
[3:10:15.720 --> 3:10:24.200]  and if you look at for instance just back on february 18 january 18 and so on you find claims
[3:10:24.200 --> 3:10:29.800]  were being made that never panned out now there were claims that someone who had a top secret
[3:10:29.800 --> 3:10:37.640]  clearance would have known and even if they were cased in in mystery or questions um i steal or cubes
[3:10:37.640 --> 3:10:42.760]  at least they should pan out and when they don't pan out a year later then you wonder hey what's
[3:10:42.760 --> 3:10:47.880]  going on what's what's his top clearance related by the way carlos i'm not tooting my horn but
[3:10:48.680 --> 3:10:53.080]  we're hated by the establishment because we get historical trends i said trump will be elected
[3:10:53.080 --> 3:10:57.960]  poppills be elected everywhere we'll have a new renaissance worldwide if we want it i just believe
[3:10:57.960 --> 3:11:03.080]  that humanity saw the different forces and had a big enough audience to believe we could set the
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:09.560]  chain reaction that's something that actually came through carlos that's right and that's why
[3:11:09.560 --> 3:11:16.760]  i believe with all my heart that fact and history together may sound at first like a conspiracy
[3:11:16.760 --> 3:11:24.120]  but the victory of truth is that once a conspiracy is shown to be factually to be historically true
[3:11:24.120 --> 3:11:29.240]  which is the case with info wars and that's why i call your program okay because i'll give you a
[3:11:29.240 --> 3:11:34.840]  little prediction we've been doing analysis now for two and a half years about hillary clinton
[3:11:34.840 --> 3:11:42.120]  and i have come with statistical um analyses of semantic things that she have said things that she
[3:11:42.120 --> 3:11:48.040]  have said the way people say it what people do and how they behave tells you a lot and if you
[3:11:48.040 --> 3:11:52.200]  keep the record like you read the tea leaves at the end of the day you can come to a pretty good
[3:11:52.200 --> 3:12:01.320]  prediction i have a statistical analysis clears close to 90.3 percent that as soon as she feels
[3:12:01.320 --> 3:12:06.040]  that she's going to be indicted she's going to announce that she's running for president
[3:12:06.040 --> 3:12:10.280]  knowing she's not going to get 100 percent that's why she's got it ready this is to say it's
[3:12:10.280 --> 3:12:16.920]  political if trump goes after exactly isn't it in the past she's she's run before saying oh this
[3:12:16.920 --> 3:12:23.000]  is just a political attack uh you know the carlos great points uh roi davis uh one of the authors
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:27.480]  of the great awakening go ahead your point on that well no i was just agreeing with carlos about
[3:12:27.480 --> 3:12:34.200]  the conspiracy thing i think i myself and all the and ones i work with are 100 behind you as far as
[3:12:34.200 --> 3:12:40.040]  the your premise and i think what what we have to do is just give it a little bit more time to pan out
[3:12:40.040 --> 3:12:44.920]  a lot of the specifics like i i mentioned alex right in the beginning some of this is misinformation
[3:12:44.920 --> 3:12:49.400]  not a lot of it but we knew from the get go 100 wasn't going to be right because some of it
[3:12:49.400 --> 3:12:54.360]  was to faint to throw the people off the trail about what what really was going to be the plan
[3:12:54.360 --> 3:12:58.600]  especially on big moves and that's that's again that's that's president trump's ml and i think
[3:12:58.600 --> 3:13:03.800]  if we just give it a little bit of time and see how things turn out we will be able to
[3:13:03.800 --> 3:13:07.800]  better judge and you'll be able to fill in your statistics and i think you'll be proven right
[3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:13.080]  all right uh let's go to venessa and texas you're on the air with our guests go ahead venessa thanks
[3:13:13.080 --> 3:13:18.040]  for holding thanks for taking my call alex but i just wanted to say you went to high school with
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:25.320]  my cousin so i know you're not bill hick um back in the rockwell texas but um i've been following
[3:13:25.320 --> 3:13:31.000]  the q uh post ever since the beginning i came across at about week two i've read all of them
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:35.720]  i've looked into the things that it uh you know points the finger at and there's there's great
[3:13:35.720 --> 3:13:40.600]  information in there and i believe it teaches people how to research and for that it's useful
[3:13:40.600 --> 3:13:45.640]  i've been listening to you for 20 years i think that you're spot on with with your analysis
[3:13:45.640 --> 3:13:52.520]  and i believe that q anon is spot on with the direction that he sends people you know to research
[3:13:52.520 --> 3:13:58.760]  and for that it's it's helpful for that it's it's a tool to wake people up and i think that
[3:13:58.760 --> 3:14:05.720]  unfortunately people have taken information that has come out on the chance not directly from q
[3:14:05.720 --> 3:14:11.800]  anon but from other people posting there and taken and run with it um q anon mentioned how
[3:14:11.800 --> 3:14:18.200]  Jerome course he tried to infiltrate um you know the q movement and his analysis of the q post
[3:14:18.200 --> 3:14:23.800]  and i think just you got tied up in that web and and guilty by association and a lot of people's
[3:14:23.800 --> 3:14:29.240]  eyes and i think it's unfair to you um well i think you're making a really good point here so
[3:14:29.240 --> 3:14:32.840]  i've been emotional about this i apologize because your guess is nice and you're nice
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:37.160]  all the q followers i mean are really smart and i think it is good to get people thinking but i'm
[3:14:37.160 --> 3:14:42.760]  not getting into coursey but amen to that is whatever that guy's up to i'm not part of it i
[3:14:42.760 --> 3:14:48.280]  agree with the caller she she's she's spot on alex 100 percent that's that's the the the direction
[3:14:48.280 --> 3:14:53.160]  and again i think everything can be worked out i mean our our goal is part of part of this digital
[3:14:54.040 --> 3:14:58.600]  that general flinn described as our army of digital soldiers part of the thing is just not
[3:14:58.600 --> 3:15:03.560]  informational but as far as comforting you know when when the person carlos has mentioned about
[3:15:03.560 --> 3:15:08.040]  hillary getting arrested it you know we suspect that there's some things like this in the future
[3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:11.240]  and and again we have to comfort the people that quite well let's do one more segment
[3:15:11.240 --> 3:15:14.920]  than jerry saloon he's taking over i promise a little more calls but finesse you talked about

[3:21:28.280 --> 3:21:33.720]  alex long time listener and i i love you dear and i'm thankful for everything that you've been
[3:21:33.720 --> 3:21:38.840]  doing thank you i understand where you're coming with the cube movement but i want you to be i want
[3:21:38.840 --> 3:21:44.760]  you to be understood from us the ones that are followers of yours but also have it got involved
[3:21:44.760 --> 3:21:48.360]  in the cube movement but from a spectacle standpoint because of the information that you
[3:21:48.360 --> 3:21:54.120]  said it made us dig deeper and i i need to thank you because if you wouldn't have been doing what
[3:21:54.120 --> 3:22:00.120]  you've been doing for the last 25 years alex none of us would have been open to this and would have
[3:22:00.120 --> 3:22:07.000]  would have believed that this could happen and the uh let's be clear i'm all for any other movement
[3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:11.240]  bigger than what i'm doing i'm great with that i just want some parts of it saying something about
[3:22:11.240 --> 3:22:17.000]  me that isn't true that's when i get upset absolutely absolutely and i was offended and
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:20.200]  when i heard people when people make comments to me and i said well you know what you better
[3:22:20.200 --> 3:22:24.120]  you better check your sources because you ain't right that's not how it goes i've listened to
[3:22:24.120 --> 3:22:29.560]  this guy for 25 years and i know this guy excuse me 20 years i've listened to you and i know you
[3:22:29.560 --> 3:22:33.720]  and i i i take all of your products i give all your products to everybody i know betty you're
[3:22:33.720 --> 3:22:40.280]  amazing you're a sweetheart so what's your view on this overall what i think is that i think we all
[3:22:40.280 --> 3:22:44.840]  need to kind of sit back and wait for all the plan to kind of unfold because there's a lot of stuff
[3:22:44.840 --> 3:22:51.160]  that the q has proved there's so many proofs out there alex there's tons of them but in the same
[3:22:51.160 --> 3:22:55.880]  respects there is also people out there who's threatened the bullcrap and you know it as well
[3:22:55.880 --> 3:22:59.560]  as i do they've done it to you and they've done it to the cube movement doing it all of it and we
[3:22:59.560 --> 3:23:04.680]  also have to understand is that even though there is patriots looking at the cube board there also
[3:23:04.680 --> 3:23:10.440]  is the enemy looking at the cube board all right i appreciate your call betty you want to comment
[3:23:10.440 --> 3:23:17.080]  on on that uh roy betty's 100 i couldn't have said any better 100 and i'll stand by everything she
[3:23:17.080 --> 3:23:22.120]  said really i you know and it there's there's truth to this where we go when we go all i mean
[3:23:22.120 --> 3:23:26.600]  it's it's it's a part of making america great again is we all have to chip in we all have to
[3:23:26.600 --> 3:23:31.880]  recognize we're on the same team and we have to all go forward together yeah let's not look back
[3:23:31.880 --> 3:23:36.360]  backwards i think that's part of the uh the movement is that we research we we find this
[3:23:36.360 --> 3:23:43.480]  information out on our own and we we we move forward as a country and as a as a all americans
[3:23:43.480 --> 3:23:46.680]  well regardless we're in a war with the deep state it's all coming out we've been exposing
[3:23:46.680 --> 3:23:51.320]  it's that's great news the m4's audience has been amazing brandon in texas you're on the year go ahead
[3:23:51.320 --> 3:23:59.640]  yeah hi alex uh thanks for taking oh um first of all and real quick i don't know but you're back
[3:23:59.640 --> 3:24:06.200]  on apple podcast i don't know if you knew that or not war room david night alex jones throw all back
[3:24:06.200 --> 3:24:12.120]  on did they reload our millions of subscribers or is somebody else putting it up there oh no and
[3:24:12.120 --> 3:24:17.160]  this is from apple it's your channel i this is podcast now you're not on the app or here
[3:24:17.160 --> 3:24:22.520]  in apple podcast let me ask you this is it our 30 something million subscribers between the shows
[3:24:23.480 --> 3:24:27.320]  or or did they here's what i'm asking did they just resubscribe you all of a sudden
[3:24:27.320 --> 3:24:31.800]  or did you have to go find it yep yep nope they resubscribe me i got a notification that
[3:24:31.800 --> 3:24:37.320]  there were 42 downloads available it's crazy well because i don't want to say this on air yet
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:44.520]  but about a week ago i noticed some other stuff and and so wow i'm gonna have to check i mean
[3:24:44.520 --> 3:24:48.200]  it looks like they're starting to convince you like we'll see what happens yeah but
[3:24:48.200 --> 3:24:53.400]  anyways about this q and on saying i thought for a long time that our favorite community organizer
[3:24:53.400 --> 3:24:57.640]  may be involved and i've seen the divisiveness on twitter regarding q people add each other's
[3:24:57.640 --> 3:25:02.520]  throat also we have people like praying medic and as much as i respect this captain you have on
[3:25:02.520 --> 3:25:09.000]  all these people seem to be for profit right there's people who decode these easter eggs for boomers
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:14.280]  for money why if you guys are part of a movement why are why does everyone seem to be capitalizing
[3:25:14.280 --> 3:25:21.480]  on it and um it just seems uh too perfect right and where we go when we go all and if that includes
[3:25:21.480 --> 3:25:27.480]  off of a cliff when all these crazy q and on people get pinned with uh the pizza gate conspiracy
[3:25:27.480 --> 3:25:34.200]  that nbc's already done that nbc abc ran these articles saying that q folks are pushing wild
[3:25:34.200 --> 3:25:39.480]  conspiracy it's already been happening so i it's really clear to me i don't see why these people
[3:25:39.480 --> 3:25:46.520]  follow fanfiction and it's not considered lunacy where who is q right well that's my issue with
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:52.040]  anything that's anonymous but i get people that their free speech rights is that once it's anonymous
[3:25:52.040 --> 3:25:56.760]  then the system can do whatever it wants in its name and so that's all i'm saying do you have any
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:26:03.320]  comments and thank you brandon do you have any comments uh captain roi davis about but well the
[3:26:03.320 --> 3:26:07.960]  proof will be in the pudding alex it's just a question of timing you know it's a you know this
[3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:12.520]  is but the deep states take a long time to build up and it's taking a long time to tear down and
[3:26:13.160 --> 3:26:19.320]  you know and again we you know i understand the color being a little uh suspicious and and and uh
[3:26:20.120 --> 3:26:25.560]  you know i'm trusting of anonymous sources but again i a lot of us are a lot of the people
[3:26:25.560 --> 3:26:31.640]  that do the youtube's i i know praying medic i know dav he's he's he's a pretty religious guy and
[3:26:31.640 --> 3:26:37.080]  he's pretty straightforward he wrote religious books before q he was an author before q and again
[3:26:37.080 --> 3:26:41.800]  if he's writing a book about q now it's hard to say that that's a profiteer fellow because he was
[3:26:41.800 --> 3:26:47.000]  already a known writer ahead of time he's just changing subjects it'd be like steven king changing
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:52.440]  a subject and then trying to condemn him for not staying in the original lane uh myself i wasn't
[3:26:52.440 --> 3:26:56.840]  an author before i got into this but i i've done public speaking and and that's one of the reasons
[3:26:56.840 --> 3:27:01.240]  i volunteered to be one of the people do it i understand let's take another call then real
[3:27:01.240 --> 3:27:07.880]  quick sandy in minnesota you're on the air thanks for holding thanks for taking my call um i'll try
[3:27:07.880 --> 3:27:14.200]  to make this really fast uh first of all i agree with brandon 100 because i've been around the like
[3:27:15.640 --> 3:27:20.920]  the patriot soapbox with pamphlet and all the rest of them and i i started out in the beginning of
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:27.640]  it i wouldn't have nothing to do with it uh they ask for money all the time and the difference between
[3:27:27.640 --> 3:27:33.080]  you alex and the difference between q no i'm really i you know what you do the research all the
[3:27:33.080 --> 3:27:37.800]  research and stuff and all these people research and they think for themselves wonderful great idea
[3:27:38.520 --> 3:27:45.320]  but here's the thing is you have always brought the proof and the proof is in the putting alex
[3:27:45.880 --> 3:27:51.800]  all the time now on the other hand everything is vague and you got to research for yourself
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:58.120]  if this is the almighty q then why is it that he has to profit from it number one and the people
[3:27:58.120 --> 3:28:05.080]  have to profit from it and i'm not talking about somebody writing a book whatever but then why is
[3:28:05.080 --> 3:28:15.480]  it you have to ask in these chat lines like patriot soapbox etc to donate money and second of all
[3:28:15.480 --> 3:28:27.320]  this big jfk jr conspiracy now jfk jr is dead he is not coming back he i heard that too you know
[3:28:27.320 --> 3:28:31.000]  we've got to end this now because i already took 30 months to realize and i apologize top

[3:32:21.720 --> 3:32:29.400]  we need it now you can take on big tech they saw info wars as a dominant independent anti-war
[3:32:29.400 --> 3:32:35.560]  pro-human pro-sovereign pro-family populist organization so they thought first they come
[3:32:35.560 --> 3:32:42.200]  for alex jones then when people say okay take him off the air everyone else like dominoes would fall

[3:33:27.480 --> 3:33:38.680]  hi this is jerald solente great being on thank you so much alex for having me on it's a real
[3:33:38.680 --> 3:33:46.040]  honor i'm a supporter of info wars even though sometimes it's not so popular alex always let
[3:33:46.040 --> 3:33:50.440]  me say what i want to say and i say that to everybody i go on all different kinds of shows
[3:33:50.440 --> 3:33:57.720]  they say what i want to say i agree disagree you know me i don't have any agenda i think fias
[3:33:57.720 --> 3:34:02.600]  self is the model of the trends journal and the latest edition of the trends journal just came
[3:34:02.600 --> 3:34:09.320]  out the only magazine in the world will you will read history before it happens and the history
[3:34:09.320 --> 3:34:14.600]  we're going to be talking about a little bit right now is the history of the economy and as we will
[3:34:14.600 --> 3:34:20.760]  know following the panic of 08 they juice the markets with that monetary methadone things like
[3:34:20.760 --> 3:34:26.440]  they never taught you in graduate school or economics 101 quantitative easing zero negative
[3:34:26.440 --> 3:34:35.880]  interest rate policy is a global slowdown it's real one of the ways we forecast trends is we
[3:34:35.880 --> 3:34:45.640]  read a lot of stuff financial times new york times china today alga zero hot ads truselm post
[3:34:45.640 --> 3:34:52.440]  far as news agency you name it we read it and a load of business publications as well so when
[3:34:52.440 --> 3:34:57.240]  you just start looking deeper into what's going on and you can see where things are going what's
[3:34:57.240 --> 3:35:02.600]  going on has nothing to do with the trade war bs because that's all that is there's nothing to
[3:35:02.600 --> 3:35:07.640]  do with that at all it's the monetary methadone that they shot into the system is finally wearing
[3:35:07.640 --> 3:35:14.920]  down and all these governments are really really infected with very heavy doses of
[3:35:16.680 --> 3:35:25.320]  debt so here's our forecast as you well know i've been on info wars and the media now for you
[3:35:25.320 --> 3:35:38.360]  know scores of years i've been saying gold prices accurately since i call the gold bull run back in
[3:35:38.360 --> 3:35:49.720]  early 2000s i call the retraction i call the bottom and now i'm saying gold has bottomed it may go
[3:35:49.720 --> 3:35:57.400]  down a little bit more but it may go up much much more and when i say it may go up much much more
[3:35:57.400 --> 3:36:06.440]  i'm going to give you the parameters today goes up 20 bucks that's a lot it's been going up
[3:36:07.800 --> 3:36:15.160]  why nothing to do with trade wars it has to do with a global slowdown and the understanding that the
[3:36:15.160 --> 3:36:26.520]  the attics that people call investors the gamblers they need more cheap money and the global banks
[3:36:26.520 --> 3:36:34.760]  are going to do it including the united states back in march i had forecast the federal reserve
[3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:42.680]  with lower interest rates and that mortgage rates back in november when they were around five percent
[3:36:42.680 --> 3:36:48.840]  i said they would go under four percent thirty a mortgage in the united states guess what
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:55.720]  we just hit three nine nine they're going to do everything they can to pump this economy up
[3:36:56.440 --> 3:37:02.760]  trump wants to get reelected he knows we need more cheap money in there he helped do it with
[3:37:02.760 --> 3:37:09.480]  lowering taxes for the corporations big stock buybacks over a trillion bought back that's slowed
[3:37:09.480 --> 3:37:17.720]  right now now there's stock selling gold is the ultimate safe haven asset the other safe haven
[3:37:17.720 --> 3:37:26.120]  asset is bonds and you're seeing a lot of money flowing into bonds even though the yield is way
[3:37:26.120 --> 3:37:37.480]  down why because global players want safe havens and bonds us bonds are a safe haven
[3:37:37.480 --> 3:37:46.600]  they're not going to go bust they'll just keep printing more money so gold prices my forecast is
[3:37:47.160 --> 3:37:55.000]  the lowest they're going to go is probably around 1270 1260 they have to break above
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:38:07.640]  1385 an ounce 1385 per ounce print the next mark and that next mark is 1450 i don't give financial
[3:38:07.640 --> 3:38:15.240]  advice i'm a trend forecaster is a global slowdown china factories slowdown stirs global fears
[3:38:16.200 --> 3:38:23.320]  financial times activity at chinese factories slowed and a key employment indicator
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:29.160]  tumbled to a 10 year low in may oh this is june only may
[3:38:32.520 --> 3:38:41.080]  reviving worries you ready that trade tensions with the us and troubles in the country's
[3:38:41.080 --> 3:38:49.320]  banking sector could weigh on growth no not trade with us it's the 40 trillion dollars in debt
[3:38:49.320 --> 3:38:59.000]  that the chinese economy built up to get this thing rolling that's what's going on
[3:38:59.000 --> 3:39:16.360]  time so the chinese manufacturing index for may fell to 49.4 anything below 50 is contraction
[3:39:16.360 --> 3:39:28.760]  so brazil and mexico contract as low commodity prices take toll has nothing to do with trade wars
[3:39:29.400 --> 3:39:33.240]  low commodity prices because there's more supply than demand
[3:39:36.360 --> 3:39:44.440]  and what else do we add here mexico pacel peso tumbles 2.5 percent as investors seek out safety
[3:39:44.440 --> 3:39:50.440]  and of course that follows trumps telling them that listen stop these people flowing over our
[3:39:50.440 --> 3:40:01.400]  borders will put tariffs on you what if it was reverse what if americans excuse me
[3:40:02.920 --> 3:40:05.560]  were flooding into mexico's borders
[3:40:05.560 --> 3:40:13.880]  what would the reaction be down in mexico oh let's take them in oh let's take them in
[3:40:13.880 --> 3:40:20.360]  the more the merrier oh yeah we're not making much money now we need more cheap labor bring
[3:40:20.360 --> 3:40:27.080]  them in we can't take care of our own bring in some more we'll pay for them would that be the
[3:40:27.080 --> 3:40:37.160]  reverse no and what else do we have here ah factory slump hints at troubles ahead
[3:40:38.520 --> 3:40:43.880]  us manufacturers are having a hard time mounting an encore to last year's strong performance
[3:40:44.520 --> 3:40:51.240]  factories are on track for their weakest showing this year since 2016
[3:40:51.240 --> 3:41:01.960]  you don't have manufacturing accounts for in the united states the grand total of 11 percent
[3:41:01.960 --> 3:41:10.680]  of our gross domestic product 11 percent oh yeah it's a trade war we want everything made
[3:41:10.680 --> 3:41:17.000]  in another country we don't want to have manufacturing we don't want to pay people working
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:25.640]  wages living wages no they could be uh plantation workers on the multinational plantations enslave
[3:41:25.640 --> 3:41:34.040]  landia get a job at amazon pick those boxes up ship them out pick them up ship them out pack
[3:41:34.040 --> 3:41:40.600]  them pick them up ship them out pack them and make by the time you pay taxes and health care and
[3:41:40.600 --> 3:41:47.320]  everything else you left with 62 50 a week in a hernia that's the kind of job you want
[3:41:50.760 --> 3:41:59.400]  so you can see where this is going expansion slips and spending cools oh where could that be
[3:41:59.400 --> 3:42:11.240]  india export weakness weighs on growth oh where's that coming from canada you got it
[3:42:12.120 --> 3:42:14.920]  i forgot about turkey hey how about argentina
[3:42:17.320 --> 3:42:24.040]  wonderful in italy oh slow down in germany it's a global slowdown
[3:42:24.040 --> 3:42:33.080]  things are getting tight out there you're gonna blame it on trade wars it's not it's bigger than
