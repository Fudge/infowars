[00:40.160 --> 00:49.040]  Republican congressional leaders and a key house Democrat are voicing misgivings over the Senate version of an economic recovery plan, but for different reasons.
[00:49.040 --> 00:57.440]  The Republicans, Nevada Senator John Ensign and Congressman Mike Pence of Indiana, say the plan has too much spending and not enough tax cuts.
[00:57.440 --> 01:02.600]  Ensign says the housing crisis is to blame for sending the nation's economy in a downward spiral.
[01:02.600 --> 01:07.760]  If you don't fix that underlying cancer, if you don't treat that, the rest of the economy can't recover.
[01:07.760 --> 01:11.480]  Pence says support for the present stimulus package is collapsing.
[01:11.480 --> 01:21.680]  American people know we can't borrow and spend and bail our way back to a growing economy. This bill, the only thing this bill is going to stimulate is more government and more debt.
[01:21.680 --> 01:27.720]  And Congressman Barney Frank says the bill cuts spending needed to protect the jobs of police and firefighters.
[01:27.720 --> 01:30.200]  They spoke on NBC's Meet the Press.
[01:30.200 --> 01:33.720]  This is IRN, USA Radio News.

[02:34.080 --> 02:43.640]  Republican Senator John McCain is accusing Democrats of doing the same thing he says Republicans did during the Bush administration, not listening to the opposition.
[02:43.640 --> 02:50.320]  McCain, on CBS, criticized the way Democratic lawmakers are putting together an economic stimulus plan.
[02:50.320 --> 02:57.840]  I think it's massive. It's much larger than any measure that was taken during the Great Depression.
[02:57.840 --> 03:02.480]  I think it has policy changes in it, which are fundamentally bad.
[03:02.480 --> 03:09.320]  And officials in Australia say it will be days before wildfires in Victoria State are brought under control.

[04:04.040 --> 04:08.560]  Palestinians have fired two rockets at Israel from Gaza. Here's Mark Latte.
[04:08.560 --> 04:19.120]  Two rockets fired from Gaza exploded in southern Israel. No one was hurt, but the rocket fire underlined the instability of the situation three weeks after Israel's punishing offensive in Gaza ended.
[04:19.120 --> 04:24.720]  Israel hits back for every rocket, targeting smuggling tunnels along the Gaza-Egypt border and other targets.
[04:24.720 --> 04:29.160]  At the same time, there are signs of progress and talks toward a long-term truce.
[04:29.160 --> 04:35.440]  Egypt is mediating the contacts because Israel and the Islamic Hamas rulers of Gaza don't talk to each other.
[04:35.440 --> 04:36.680]  Mark Latte, Jerusalem.
[04:36.680 --> 04:42.760]  Resilient authorities are investigating the crash of a twin turboprop plane into the Amazon Jungle River.
[04:42.760 --> 04:49.240]  Saturday's crash killed 24 people who were on board. Four survived. Here's Telessa Elizoni.
[04:49.240 --> 05:02.920]  Reports made the pilots reported problems with the weather at the time of the crash, and the relatives of the four survivors said that apparently one of the engines malfunctioned, which caused the plane to lose altitude.
[05:02.920 --> 05:08.920]  More from the Sunday talk shows were Lawrence Summers, one of President Barack Obama's top economic advisors.
[05:08.920 --> 05:12.680]  Say aggressive action must be taken to turn the economy around.
[05:12.680 --> 05:24.400]  A very wide consensus of economists, they may disagree about the details of which particular step you should take, but a very wide cross-section of opinion believes that this economy needs help quickly.
[05:24.400 --> 05:32.560]  And in Iraq, police say a roadside bomb killed two Shia pilgrims today. I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.
[05:32.560 --> 05:44.400]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S. and the world. And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.

[06:32.760 --> 07:02.520]  I.R.A. USA Radio News. I'm Jody Jordan. Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas tells Fox News Sunday he expects President Barack Obama's
[07:02.520 --> 07:08.160]  stimulus package to pass the Senate, but warns it could damage the economy in the future.
[07:08.160 --> 07:11.840]  Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill says Americans are herding.
[07:11.840 --> 07:17.480]  Well, it is the two-hour Sunday abbreviated version of my weekday syndicated transmission.
[07:17.480 --> 07:24.000]  Thank you so much for joining us. It is the eighth day of February 2009.
[07:24.000 --> 07:37.880]  We'll be here for the next hour and 55 minutes. The toll-free number to join us on air is 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525.
[07:37.880 --> 07:44.240]  If you're in central Texas, you're welcome to call 836-0590.
[07:44.240 --> 07:51.160]  I want to take a lot of calls today, and that's going to be a challenge because the news is all extremely important.
[07:51.160 --> 07:57.000]  The Washington Post today has the headline, Obama's National Security Council Will Get New Power.
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.640]  Directive Expands Makeup and Role of Security Body.
[08:01.640 --> 08:12.040]  And this is open dictatorship. It couples perfectly with Homeland Security, the Northern Command, the Indo-Pacific Command TOTUS, the John Warren Defense Authorization Act,
[08:12.040 --> 08:17.560]  Presidential Decision Directive 51, the Military Commissions Act,
[08:17.560 --> 08:25.400]  and the former commandant of the Marine Corps, Bilderberg Group, and the world government supporter, James L. Jones, is to head it up.
[08:25.400 --> 08:39.640]  Congress will have no oversight, no involvement. Every major federal agency will be under the control of the National Security Council and operated secrecy under the 1947 National Security Act.
[08:39.640 --> 08:45.080]  This is a coup d'etat, and you're like, wait a minute, Bush just left, Obama just came in.
[08:45.080 --> 08:50.760]  Well, what did I cover in Endgame and Terror Storm? I said Bush was going to leave office in my films.
[08:50.760 --> 08:57.960]  I said he would pass on the powers to a new puppet, but I have to say it looks like they're going to make their full move with Obama.
[08:57.960 --> 09:04.760]  All this preparation, the way they're setting him up as a messianic savior, we're in a lot of trouble.
[09:04.760 --> 09:08.760]  Why do the elites want tyranny? They want to steal all your pension funds.
[09:08.760 --> 09:19.000]  Offshore banks have seized control of the country, and they're using dictatorial power that they set up in third world nations they loot to ensure that we never bring them to justice.
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.160]  The tyranny is only a rearguard action for the thieving.
[09:25.160 --> 09:40.040]  So we'll get into that. Kurt Nemo's there an excellent story. So is Paul Watson at prisonpana.com, Kurt Nemo's article. Obama's change, expanding the power of the NSC and shadow government just out about an hour ago, full of hyperlinks to all the federal documents themselves.
[09:40.040 --> 09:49.400]  Every claim we make is documented. And as scary as this article is, I read it. I have to tell you it's worse than even Kurt is saying.
[09:49.400 --> 09:55.880]  And in the last week at Dovetails with this article, new legislation authorizes FEMA camps in the United States.
[09:55.880 --> 10:07.400]  HR 645 says they're going to merge local police, the military, all governmental functions, the governors will be titular, ceremonial, everything around the local FEMA camps.
[10:07.400 --> 10:14.440]  And it says local pastors will help the public prepare to go into the camps. It's in the bill.
[10:14.440 --> 10:22.280]  Of course, we told you about that three years ago when it was top secret, when we got the secret classified documents and posted them.
[10:22.280 --> 10:29.800]  Did people appreciate us being brave? No, they just said they were fake. Now mainstream news admits they're real.
[10:29.800 --> 10:33.080]  That's right. They got a FEMA camp for you and your family.
[10:33.080 --> 10:42.120]  The Defense Department announces civilian expeditionary force. We told you that Obama, because he said so, and his chief of staff wrote a book about it and said so, and said so in ceaseband.
[10:42.120 --> 10:46.440]  National compulsory service and a one million man new domestic army.
[10:46.440 --> 10:51.800]  Well, they don't need legislation now under the new North Com system.
[10:51.800 --> 10:58.680]  It is simply a Defense Department directive, 1404.10 Defense Department directive.
[10:58.680 --> 11:02.920]  So we'll go over that a little bit for you today.
[11:02.920 --> 11:06.920]  Here's another one with the Pentagon taking over the entire country.
[11:06.920 --> 11:14.680]  Bomb plants could shift to control a Pentagon. This is the New York Times, the Obama administration, considering whether to shift the management of nuclear weapons production,
[11:14.680 --> 11:19.320]  because the Pentagon got caught trying to steal six cruise missiles a year and a half ago. Remember that?
[11:19.320 --> 11:23.720]  They wanted to claim I ran at them and then they had to kill.
[11:23.720 --> 11:29.400]  It was about 14 people involved in loading them. So they shut everybody up. It was blowing the whistle.
[11:29.400 --> 11:35.800]  But they got to have one agency doing it so they can have black ops get in there easier and claim they were stolen.
[11:35.800 --> 11:40.760]  Bomb plants could shift the control of Pentagon under James L. Jones.
[11:40.760 --> 11:44.600]  So have that there for you in the stack as well.
[11:44.600 --> 11:49.880]  One of the New York Times. Yeah, we're not in Kansas anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:49.880 --> 11:55.880]  That's right. Alex Jones was right. It was all real. It's true. It's happening.
[11:55.880 --> 12:04.360]  And they're so secure in their power, they have come out in the last month with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of mainstream articles.
[12:04.360 --> 12:11.160]  The latest was last week. I'm still just spinning from it in the Wall Street Journal saying,
[12:11.160 --> 12:16.200]  yes, we're setting up a North American Union. Yes, we kept it secret from you for your own good.
[12:16.200 --> 12:18.440]  Yes, we're going to get rid of the dollar for a new Amaro.
[12:19.240 --> 12:23.960]  And it said the New World Order is your savior. The New World Order is good.
[12:24.920 --> 12:30.520]  Just Google Wall Street Journal, North American Union or Amaro and click news and you can read it.
[12:30.520 --> 12:40.520]  I mean, don't believe me. Just go read. I'm telling you, that's exactly what the Sunday Times of London said a month ago in an article titled and now for world government.
[12:40.520 --> 12:46.520]  By the way, it's published by Mr. Wolf, one of the Bilderberg group members openly calling for world government.
[12:46.520 --> 12:51.480]  And they said, yeah, we kept it secret for your own good. It is real and we're setting it up.
[12:51.480 --> 12:58.520]  And by the way, they use the word undemocratic, dictatorial. But they said that is good.
[12:58.520 --> 13:02.520]  See, when they enter the final phase and go ahead and move forward with all of this,
[13:02.520 --> 13:08.520]  they have to create all these crises and say, well, we've got to be dictatorial to save you.
[13:10.520 --> 13:16.520]  And who do we always tell you the top of the new order was the private central banks that control the printing presses of the western world.
[13:16.520 --> 13:22.520]  We always said they would implode the markets and have a credit crisis like they did in 1929 by design.
[13:22.520 --> 13:28.520]  They would then cut off liquidity to the public. This time they claim they've turned on the money,
[13:28.520 --> 13:32.520]  but they're only giving it to themselves while everything else is cash-starved to buy up all the infrastructure.
[13:32.520 --> 13:38.520]  And again, if you don't like it, Northcom standing by. Now, the military doesn't like their new Obama oath,
[13:38.520 --> 13:43.520]  and we've confirmed this. They don't swear an oath to the Constitution now. They swear it to Obama.
[13:43.520 --> 13:50.520]  Now, Bush tested this, but withdrew it. Well, Obama's doing it. And the troops are finally starting to have the wheels turn and go,
[13:50.520 --> 13:58.520]  didn't that happen in 1933 when Adolf Hitler got elected? They had to no longer swear allegiance to the Republic to Deutschland.
[13:58.520 --> 14:07.520]  They had to swear it to Adolf Alois Hitler. Oh, boy, we are in serious waters here.
[14:07.520 --> 14:12.520]  Oh, by the way, Obama has gone back on everything he said he'd do.
[14:12.520 --> 14:22.520]  Bloomberg, AP & Reuters all report that all the big banks in the executive order signed this week are exempt from salary caps and CEO caps.
[14:22.520 --> 14:30.520]  Totally exempt. It's only if the government chooses on smaller institutions they can do it. That's going to end up being your business.
[14:30.520 --> 14:36.520]  See, you're going to get a salary cap. The international bankers aren't. The same guys that don't pay their taxes.
[14:36.520 --> 14:41.520]  I found all these quotes in news articles that David Rockefeller bragging he doesn't pay $1 in tax. None of them do.
[14:41.520 --> 14:46.520]  It's a big joke to them. It's for us schmucks to pay because the income tax doesn't go to run the country.
[14:46.520 --> 14:52.520]  It goes right into the bankers' pocket. You know, you write your check to the private Federal Reserve when you write an income tax check.
[14:52.520 --> 14:55.520]  You know that, right? It's all the other taxes that run the country.
[14:55.520 --> 15:01.520]  So I thought I'd go over that a little bit later. We have those mainstream articles. I'll be covering them.
[15:01.520 --> 15:05.520]  Of course, I could read the bills and tell you that it did that.
[15:05.520 --> 15:11.520]  Obama preserves renditions as counterterrorism tool under executive orders issued by Obama recently.
[15:11.520 --> 15:17.520]  The CIA still has authority to carry out what are known as renditions, secret abductions and transfers of prisoners.
[15:17.520 --> 15:20.520]  And then the LA Times goes on to admit they're keeping all the camps open.
[15:20.520 --> 15:24.520]  And the ACLU has now sent a letter to them saying, you promised not to do this.
[15:24.520 --> 15:27.520]  And then the British were about to release documents about torture.
[15:27.520 --> 15:33.520]  And Obama threatened to withdraw national security data transfers.
[15:33.520 --> 15:38.520]  And so, again, total betrayal. He promised to get rid of NAFTA and GATT.
[15:38.520 --> 15:43.520]  But then speaking to a business council in Canada, his top advisor said, oh, that's just rhetoric.
[15:43.520 --> 15:49.520]  And now Obama is saying he's going to expand NAFTA and GATT and the SPP, known as the North American Union.
[15:49.520 --> 15:52.520]  So another betrayal right there. He promised not to appoint any lobbyist.
[15:52.520 --> 15:56.520]  Everyone he is appointing is a top lobbyist. Everyone in a cabinet position.
[15:56.520 --> 16:03.520]  Secretary of Defense Lobbyist, Deputy Secretary of Defense Lobbyist, Blair over National Security Lobbyist,
[16:03.520 --> 16:10.520]  Panetta, Leon Panetta for CIA Lobbyist, George Mitchell Lobbyist, just all lobbyist.
[16:10.520 --> 16:15.520]  Total lies. And the lies will continue when we get back here.
[16:15.520 --> 16:20.520]  See, foreign banks have hijacked the government in a corporate takeover.
[16:20.520 --> 16:25.520]  They now run the military. They run the states. They're building FEMA camps.
[16:25.520 --> 16:30.520]  They're going to make us so poor and so desperate they want us to revolt.
[16:30.520 --> 16:33.520]  Oh, yeah, it's serious. We'll be right back.
[16:33.520 --> 16:37.520]  Time is more precious than money. You could be running out of time.
[16:37.520 --> 16:40.520]  I want to share something with you about your body.
[16:40.520 --> 16:45.520]  Quote, make no mistake about it. Parasites are the most toxic agents in the human body.
[16:45.520 --> 16:51.520]  They are one of the primary underlying causes of diseases and are the most basic cause of a compromised immune system.
[16:51.520 --> 16:57.520]  Dr. Hazel Parsley's PhD. Quote, we have a tremendous parasite problem right here in the U.S.
[16:57.520 --> 17:01.520]  It is just not being addressed. Dr. Peter Weina, quote,
[17:01.520 --> 17:06.520]  in terms of numbers, there are more parasitic infections acquired in this country than in Africa.
[17:06.520 --> 17:11.520]  Dr. Frank Nova, Chief of the Laboratory for Parasitic Diseases of the National Institute of Health.
[17:11.520 --> 17:14.520]  As you can see, parasites are more dangerous than you think.
[17:14.520 --> 17:17.520]  For about a buck a day, you can read yourself of all parasites.

[20:44.520 --> 20:56.520]  All right, we are back live. I'm going to go into your phone calls and I'll get into the National Security Council and open dictatorship.
[20:56.520 --> 21:00.520]  Meet the new boss, worse than the last boss.
[21:00.520 --> 21:13.520]  And then Democratic senators, House members, Obama administration officials on tape are saying yes, they are going to re-institute the fairness doctrine with Orwellian Doublespeak restricting free speech on talk radio.
[21:13.520 --> 21:17.520]  That is indeed happening right now.
[21:17.520 --> 21:24.520]  They will limit the debate to only Republican and Democratic voices, which are all part of the controlled paradigm.
[21:24.520 --> 21:27.520]  Obama is fear mongering, saying, where did all the hope and change go?
[21:27.520 --> 21:31.520]  Pass the economic stimulus, all the pork barrel to buy off more people.
[21:31.520 --> 21:36.520]  Or there will be a catastrophe.
[21:36.520 --> 21:55.520]  Meanwhile, the trillion dollar stimulus is a distraction itself from the 8.5 trillion so far stolen by offshore banks from the U.S. Treasury in the last four months, three and a half months since the October 3rd Banker Takeover Bill was passed.
[21:55.520 --> 21:57.520]  So we'll get into that as well.
[21:57.520 --> 22:13.520]  And a story by Kurt Nemo up on infowars.com, increasing numbers of states declaring sovereignty, eight separate states, Washington, New Hampshire, Arizona, Montana, Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma, California, Georgia, either pass laws declaring sovereignty or in the process of it.
[22:13.520 --> 22:18.520]  And when you read the bills like the new New Hampshire legislation, it looks like it's got a good chance of passing.
[22:18.520 --> 22:27.520]  It says because FEMA camps are being built, because offshore banks have seized the government, because gun confiscations being prepared, and that's right.
[22:27.520 --> 22:31.520]  The legislatures are now actually reading the new laws that have been passed.
[22:31.520 --> 22:40.520]  Statesmen, lawyers, people that know how to research these bills like we've done are looking at them and they're finding out that it's really happening.
[22:40.520 --> 22:42.520]  All of this tyranny is really being brought in.
[22:42.520 --> 22:48.520]  And there are more than 10 bills introduced with co-sponsors.
[22:48.520 --> 22:57.520]  Some of them introduced right before he left the house to go to the White House, be Chief of Staff, by Rahm Emanuel, to ban all semi-automatic rifles and handguns.
[22:57.520 --> 23:02.520]  I mean, you have to hand them in, not just ban their future sale.
[23:02.520 --> 23:12.520]  They also are announcing that they may just put people on a no-fly list, a black list, no judge, no jury, no nothing. You just can't own guns if you're on a no-fly list.
[23:12.520 --> 23:18.520]  We played during the weekday show, Rahm Emanuel is saying that in the speech, to the Brady campaign, Sarah Brady and the gun grabbers.
[23:18.520 --> 23:20.520]  And they've got other bills in there.
[23:20.520 --> 23:24.520]  We'll have to be federally registered to own a gun, go through federal psychological testing.
[23:24.520 --> 23:27.520]  I mean, it's all happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:27.520 --> 23:47.520]  They've got the Obama noids out there stumbling around, just thinking he's some wonderful new liberal come to save the day when he is totally bought and paid for by the very same military industrial complex that has been setting up the takeover of this nation.
[23:47.520 --> 23:48.520]  So get past Obama.
[23:48.520 --> 23:53.520]  He may be the most wonderful person since sliced bread, since milk and cookies.
[23:53.520 --> 24:02.520]  But the guy is bought and paid for by the new rule order and now three weeks into his presidency, we have all his policies and it's worse than we had even said.
[24:02.520 --> 24:08.520]  It is bold how much lying has gone on and how much corruption and how much tyranny has been brought into place.
[24:08.520 --> 24:11.520]  So that's all coming up.
[24:11.520 --> 24:14.520]  But first off, let's go to Roger in Kansas.
[24:14.520 --> 24:16.520]  You're on the air, Roger.
[24:16.520 --> 24:24.520]  Hey, Alex, 100,000 vaticanglo via Nazi, sons of Lucifer run the world.
[24:24.520 --> 24:29.520]  And that's the simplest way I can describe the new world order after all the research I've done.
[24:29.520 --> 24:31.520]  Now, does that make any sense to you?
[24:31.520 --> 24:32.520]  Well, I know this.
[24:32.520 --> 24:34.520]  Evil corrupt people throughout history have run.
[24:34.520 --> 24:38.520]  Normally nations and empires are run by corrupt tyrants.
[24:38.520 --> 24:40.520]  Liberty is the exception.
[24:40.520 --> 24:46.520]  And every major nation in the world, even countries that are part of the new world order are most of them are run by thugs.
[24:46.520 --> 24:47.520]  That's the nature of things.
[24:47.520 --> 24:52.520]  But we have a particularly virulent group of thugs in control of the United States and Europe.
[24:52.520 --> 24:53.520]  Okay.
[24:53.520 --> 24:54.520]  Now, I have a question.
[24:54.520 --> 24:55.520]  I have an idea.
[24:55.520 --> 25:01.520]  And if this is a bad idea, then you tell me why this won't work because you need to get paid just to do what you do.
[25:01.520 --> 25:08.520]  And we know there's all these people in Hollywood that are on your side, but they're scared of repercussions because they don't, you know, they don't want to be harassed.
[25:08.520 --> 25:10.520]  So here's the deal.
[25:10.520 --> 25:20.520]  They can hire their assistants to purchase untraceable, legal, ethical, $1,000 money orders with your name on it, save the receipt, send it to you.
[25:20.520 --> 25:22.520]  Nobody knows about anything.
[25:22.520 --> 25:25.520]  And they could find the whole thing anonymously legally.
[25:25.520 --> 25:26.520]  Well, listen, here's the deal.
[25:26.520 --> 25:30.520]  You know, we're funding my radio show.
[25:30.520 --> 25:31.520]  We're funding filmmaking.
[25:31.520 --> 25:32.520]  We're funding the websites.
[25:32.520 --> 25:35.520]  We are not the only game in town fighting tyranny.
[25:35.520 --> 25:41.520]  We're here to get people to go out and take action in their own way.
[25:41.520 --> 25:43.520]  I don't call up people I know in Hollywood.
[25:43.520 --> 25:49.520]  And just as I know, quite a few folks in Hollywood that have contacted me over the years.
[25:49.520 --> 25:52.520]  I mean, what does that mean?
[25:52.520 --> 25:59.520]  So again, we're doing as much as we can here and we're growing and people need to support us.
[25:59.520 --> 26:08.520]  But to just say it's not the people's job to support or spread the word and it's just time for people in Hollywood to give you money or people, you know, and music to give you money.
[26:08.520 --> 26:11.520]  Again, it's about news and information here.
[26:11.520 --> 26:13.520]  We can't make it all about Alex Jones, folks.
[26:13.520 --> 26:17.520]  Plus, let's say I became the big giant leader and really grew in size.
[26:17.520 --> 26:19.520]  They just kill me or set me up.
[26:19.520 --> 26:24.520]  It needs to be a movement, an idea, a manifesto, a constitution, a bill of rights.
[26:24.520 --> 26:26.520]  An idea is bulletproof.
[26:26.520 --> 26:27.520]  I am not.
[26:27.520 --> 26:30.520]  George in Texas, you're on the air.
[26:30.520 --> 26:31.520]  How are you doing, Alex?
[26:31.520 --> 26:32.520]  Good.
[26:32.520 --> 26:33.520]  Yes.
[26:33.520 --> 26:39.520]  I mean, you heard about in a world that they revamped, I think, what back up the UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child.
[26:39.520 --> 26:42.520]  Yes, and it says that you can't teach your children your religion.
[26:42.520 --> 26:44.520]  You can't spank them.
[26:44.520 --> 26:51.520]  You have to put them in government training camps and that the right of the child is to be put on Prozac and Redland.
[26:51.520 --> 26:57.520]  It's to totally destroy the family and Hillary Clinton says they're going to try to reintroduce it and get Obama to ratify it.
[26:57.520 --> 27:01.520]  And that means it's a CPS on steroids.
[27:01.520 --> 27:05.520]  Oh, it talks about that every child will be assessed by the state and they'll take a lot of people's children.
[27:05.520 --> 27:06.520]  Yes.
[27:06.520 --> 27:08.520]  Well, because I was in a reading on parentalrights.org.
[27:08.520 --> 27:16.520]  If I don't want my son to go to a vocal rapper concert, he can go call CPS and review my decision.
[27:16.520 --> 27:20.520]  Absolutely, but the children will find out real fast how hellish it is if they do do that.
[27:20.520 --> 27:23.520]  Let me expand on a section in there.
[27:23.520 --> 27:33.520]  It says that even if your 11-year-old wants to have an abortion, that it is to be secret from you and that if you try to intervene in any way, you will be arrested.
[27:33.520 --> 27:35.520]  So, I mean, just goes on and on.
[27:35.520 --> 27:38.520]  Just Google UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child.
[27:38.520 --> 27:43.520]  Go read the articles in the section and just see it for yourself.
[27:43.520 --> 27:45.520]  It's just unbelievable.
[27:45.520 --> 27:47.520]  Let's go to another caller.
[27:47.520 --> 27:52.520]  Gary NPA, you're on the air.
[27:52.520 --> 27:53.520]  Hello, Alex.
[27:53.520 --> 27:54.520]  Hi.
[27:54.520 --> 27:56.520]  You're my hero, man.
[27:56.520 --> 27:57.520]  You're incredible.
[27:57.520 --> 28:00.520]  Hey, I just wanted to bring to your attention.
[28:00.520 --> 28:02.520]  I'm not sure if you know about it.
[28:02.520 --> 28:07.520]  I'm sure you know of Catherine Albrecht.
[28:07.520 --> 28:09.520]  She's been on Coast to Coast.
[28:09.520 --> 28:10.520]  Yeah, I know.
[28:10.520 --> 28:11.520]  No, I know.
[28:11.520 --> 28:16.520]  I mean, the guy that broke all that was Tex Mars in 1994 with his book, Project Lucent.
[28:16.520 --> 28:19.520]  That one book, by the way, we sell it at infowars.com.
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.520]  You'll know the entire agenda because that book was written 14 years ago, 15 years ago,
[28:25.520 --> 28:28.520]  and when you read it, it's exactly everything that happened.
[28:28.520 --> 28:32.520]  Tracker chips and everything, RFID, absolutely.
[28:32.520 --> 28:33.520]  Right.
[28:33.520 --> 28:40.520]  Well, the reason I'm bringing her up is she was on the 28th, Wednesday the 20th, January,
[28:40.520 --> 28:50.520]  and she brought up a private secure search engine, IX Quick, and it looks good to me.
[28:50.520 --> 28:52.520]  Maybe you should check it out.
[28:52.520 --> 28:53.520]  No, yeah.
[28:53.520 --> 28:58.520]  It sends, it puts you into a virtual browser and then it does the searching for you and
[28:58.520 --> 29:02.520]  then delivers the info through its conduit to you.
[29:02.520 --> 29:06.520]  Yeah, I hadn't heard you mention it since then, so I didn't know if you know.
[29:06.520 --> 29:10.520]  We use secure, supposedly, search engines.
[29:10.520 --> 29:15.520]  Yeah, the other thing I was going to ask you about was, you know, I tried to call in to
[29:15.520 --> 29:23.520]  when they had that IRS agent that investigated.
[29:23.520 --> 29:24.520]  Hold on.
[29:24.520 --> 29:25.520]  Stay there.
[29:25.520 --> 29:26.520]  We'll come back to you after the break.
[29:26.520 --> 29:33.520]  Stay with us.
[29:33.520 --> 29:35.520]  The headlines are clear.
[29:35.520 --> 29:38.520]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[29:38.520 --> 29:41.520]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[29:41.520 --> 29:43.520]  The market of beast is at hand.
[29:43.520 --> 29:46.520]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[29:46.520 --> 29:49.520]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.

[34:00.520 --> 34:07.520]  To cover the latest martial law police state developments, why is the White House setting all this up?
[34:07.520 --> 34:12.520]  Why did Bush pass the baton perfectly to the new puppet in chief, Barack Obama?

[34:25.520 --> 34:27.520]  But let's go back to your calls.
[34:27.520 --> 34:32.520]  Okay, Gary and P.A., you were asking a question.
[34:32.520 --> 34:34.520]  Go ahead and finish up your question.
[34:34.520 --> 34:49.520]  I was trying to get through the coast to coast when they had that IRS agent who investigated the legality of the income tax and got himself fired.
[34:49.520 --> 34:52.520]  I think his name might have been Bannister or something like that.
[34:52.520 --> 34:54.520]  Yeah, I was the first person to interview Bannister.
[34:54.520 --> 34:58.520]  He's a film comprehensive annual financial reports exposed.
[34:58.520 --> 35:01.520]  Yeah, I saw your interview on YouTube, I guess it was.
[35:01.520 --> 35:05.520]  Yeah, I interviewed him 10 years ago.
[35:05.520 --> 35:16.520]  Anyway, I wanted to bring to their attention about the CAFR and Walter Burian.
[35:16.520 --> 35:22.520]  They kept disconnecting me or connecting me to a busy signal or something.
[35:22.520 --> 35:30.520]  Well, sir, I mean the issue is other people's shows are their shows and I can't control what their shows do.
[35:30.520 --> 35:31.520]  I can't really comment on it.
[35:31.520 --> 35:33.520]  Coast to coast has never censored me.
[35:33.520 --> 35:35.520]  They get a lot of calls coming in.
[35:35.520 --> 35:38.520]  I think they try to choose what they think is the best calls to put on.
[35:38.520 --> 35:39.520]  Sometimes they don't even screen them.
[35:39.520 --> 35:40.520]  We don't screen calls here.
[35:40.520 --> 35:42.520]  Nobody screens your calls.
[35:42.520 --> 35:46.520]  But we're here covering the comprehensive annual financial reports.
[35:46.520 --> 35:52.520]  Then I have covered those before with George Norring, so we appreciate George and what they're doing over there.
[35:52.520 --> 35:54.520]  Let's talk to Robert in Colorado.
[35:54.520 --> 35:55.520]  Robert, you're on the air.
[35:55.520 --> 35:56.520]  Yeah, Alex.
[35:56.520 --> 35:57.520]  Thanks very much for taking my call.
[35:57.520 --> 35:58.520]  Appreciate it.
[35:58.520 --> 35:59.520]  Two things.
[35:59.520 --> 36:09.520]  Number one, did you hear about that bonehead stump that Bill Gates did last Friday at a meeting out in California?
[36:09.520 --> 36:10.520]  What did he do?
[36:10.520 --> 36:12.520]  Were he supposedly released the mosquitoes?
[36:12.520 --> 36:16.520]  Yeah, wasn't that stupid as hell?
[36:16.520 --> 36:23.520]  He made a comment that not only poor people should have to suffer from malaria, so he really sees those out of his jar or whatever.
[36:23.520 --> 36:27.520]  Yeah, and he wants to design the mosquitoes that have the vaccine in them.
[36:27.520 --> 36:36.520]  And his father's the head of Planned Parenthood, and Bill Gates is openly for a one-shot policy, and they use their big foundation as a eugenics front.
[36:36.520 --> 36:37.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[36:37.520 --> 36:41.520]  Instead of finding a cure, he's probably spreading it in Africa or wherever.
[36:41.520 --> 36:43.520]  People need to see the documentation.
[36:43.520 --> 36:46.520]  They need to see in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[36:46.520 --> 36:47.520]  Have you seen that?
[36:47.520 --> 36:48.520]  Yeah, I have.
[36:48.520 --> 36:51.520]  Well, it covers it for folks that don't know and want to learn more.
[36:51.520 --> 36:54.520]  Yeah, I just thought it was idiotic to do that.
[36:54.520 --> 37:03.520]  The other thing is, I think Obama made a verbal opog last Thursday or Friday.
[37:03.520 --> 37:13.520]  He was at some type of meeting in Pennsylvania somewhere, I think, and he was, I'm loosely quoting here, paraphrasing, I don't remember his exact words, but something along the lines of,
[37:13.520 --> 37:17.520]  criticisms against the stimulus bill are that, well, it's just another spending bill.
[37:17.520 --> 37:19.520]  Well, that's what a stimulus bill is.
[37:19.520 --> 37:28.520]  So I thought that was kind of a tipping of a handful to speak by him saying that he, in effect, admitted that it was a spending bill, which...
[37:28.520 --> 37:29.520]  Now, I hear you.
[37:29.520 --> 37:36.520]  Look, the trillion dollar bailout bill or stimulus bill itself is a diversion.
[37:36.520 --> 37:42.520]  In the first two months of the banker takeover, 8.5 trillion was missing according to the Associated Press and Bloomberg.
[37:42.520 --> 37:44.520]  They won't say where the money went.
[37:44.520 --> 37:45.520]  Now I have all these congressional hearings.
[37:45.520 --> 37:50.520]  I'm putting clips of them in the Obama film I'm making, the Obama deception that comes out March 15th.
[37:50.520 --> 37:53.520]  And they're saying to the Federal Reserve, where's the money?
[37:53.520 --> 37:55.520]  And they go, we don't have to tell you.
[37:55.520 --> 37:58.520]  We're a private group outside of your control.
[37:58.520 --> 38:01.520]  Just like Alan Greenspan has lately said on the news.
[38:01.520 --> 38:09.520]  So the country's been hijacked and they love to have, you know, Obama come out and say he screwed up or he's running things to create that illusion.
[38:09.520 --> 38:12.520]  So he gets all the blame or Bush gets all the blame.
[38:12.520 --> 38:17.520]  So we never get past these puppets and look at the real policies being set in secret by the globalist.
[38:17.520 --> 38:20.520]  Robert in Texas, Robert, you're on the air.
[38:20.520 --> 38:23.520]  Alex, great honor to speak with you.
[38:23.520 --> 38:24.520]  Honor to speak with you, sir.
[38:24.520 --> 38:28.520]  I just have two points and I'll make them quick.
[38:28.520 --> 38:34.520]  The first one, I have a friend who recently got out of federal prison here in Texas.
[38:34.520 --> 38:37.520]  One of the private jail group installations.
[38:37.520 --> 38:41.520]  And he was meeting his medical records.
[38:41.520 --> 38:46.520]  And so he called the unit and got hold of the medical part of the unit there.
[38:46.520 --> 38:54.520]  And they put him through a big rigmarole, told him he had to get notarized releases and all this to them.
[38:54.520 --> 39:01.520]  And when he finally did, they told him that he wasn't allowed to have them because they weren't his property.
[39:01.520 --> 39:04.520]  And he asked them, well, whose property are they?
[39:04.520 --> 39:09.520]  And they told him, well, we have sold your medical records and they're the property of the people who bought them.
[39:09.520 --> 39:11.520]  And he said, well, then who bought them?
[39:11.520 --> 39:13.520]  And they refused to tell him.
[39:13.520 --> 39:16.520]  Yeah, well, they do a lot of medical experiments.
[39:16.520 --> 39:22.520]  This has come out even the jail guards have gotten sick and huntsful on people in the state and federal prisons.
[39:22.520 --> 39:27.520]  And when they take your blood at the hospital, they claim that they own it.
[39:27.520 --> 39:37.520]  And I remember 12 years ago on air when I learned that since 1973, everyone born in the hospital has their blood taken and they claim it's for a blood test.
[39:37.520 --> 39:38.520]  But that's true.
[39:38.520 --> 39:39.520]  Part of it is for that.
[39:39.520 --> 39:42.520]  The other part went into a federal secret register.
[39:42.520 --> 39:49.520]  Now, because of lawsuits the last few years, they've now admitted the University of Texas is the main body for the U.S. keeping them.
[39:49.520 --> 39:57.520]  It's a global database and they then claim they own your blood, your DNA, and your entire protein makeup.
[39:57.520 --> 40:00.520]  And then they have databases on people.
[40:00.520 --> 40:08.520]  And when you go to get gene therapy later, you learn you've got to pay a company because the government owns your DNA or private groups they sold it to.
[40:08.520 --> 40:12.520]  And I've had state reps in Congress been on about this and the public still doesn't believe it.
[40:12.520 --> 40:15.520]  That's how sneaky the shadow government is.
[40:15.520 --> 40:30.520]  That if you're 35 or 36 years old or younger, every person born in the hospital, including myself and Parkland in Dallas, Texas, had your blood taken, they lied to you and said it was for something else.
[40:30.520 --> 40:32.520]  The compartmentalized nurses, they didn't lie.
[40:32.520 --> 40:33.520]  They didn't know.
[40:33.520 --> 40:36.520]  And it's like that on thousands of instances.
[40:36.520 --> 40:39.520]  This is a scientific dictatorship.
[40:39.520 --> 40:46.520]  The Human Genome Project is a race specific bio weapon program.
[40:46.520 --> 40:50.520]  It's late in the game, ladies and gentlemen, late in the game.
[40:50.520 --> 40:53.520]  Alex in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[40:53.520 --> 40:55.520]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[40:55.520 --> 40:56.520]  Good.
[40:56.520 --> 41:06.520]  I think that the way that you're going about getting liberty in our lifetime is good, but I think that there's something even better that we can do and that's join the Free State Project.
[41:06.520 --> 41:07.520]  Have you ever heard of that?
[41:07.520 --> 41:08.520]  Yeah, of course.
[41:08.520 --> 41:10.520]  I've interviewed a lot of the folks involved up in New Hampshire.
[41:10.520 --> 41:15.520]  They're all, quote, moving there so they can take over the government through the electoral process.
[41:15.520 --> 41:21.520]  And I think it's a fabulous idea, but I think lots of ideas can't be blocked.
[41:21.520 --> 41:30.520]  If we have a wide ranging multifaceted attack on the New World Order that's leaderless resistance, it can't be stopped.
[41:30.520 --> 41:37.520]  But if we just go for one thing, let's say you get New Hampshire, well, then the feds will just come in and federalize it.
[41:37.520 --> 41:42.520]  We've got to have the spirit of liberty, the culture of liberty being rediscovered everywhere.
[41:42.520 --> 41:49.520]  And, you know, case in point is eight states passing or moving to pass bills that say we're not going under martial law.
[41:49.520 --> 41:57.520]  You're not sovereign, you're not confiscating guns, ordering the state police and the cities chartered under the state to not confiscate guns or violate the
[41:57.520 --> 41:58.520]  Bill of Rights of Constitution.
[41:58.520 --> 42:08.520]  Now, I had the idea for this seven years ago with the Patriot Act and people picked it up and have thrown the Patriot Act out in eight
[42:08.520 --> 42:10.520]  hundred cities in eight states.
[42:10.520 --> 42:15.520]  Now seven states are moving with this, but it's because individuals took the idea and built on it.
[42:15.520 --> 42:19.520]  Now, the question is, those of you out there, what big idea do you have?
[42:19.520 --> 42:20.520]  Let's hear your big idea.
[42:20.520 --> 42:22.520]  The solutions are here.
[42:22.520 --> 42:23.520]  It's called resisting.
[42:23.520 --> 42:25.520]  Resistance is victory.
[42:25.520 --> 42:31.520]  I think if we get everyone that thinks like you together, you know, we can do more together than we can apart.
[42:31.520 --> 42:35.520]  If we're all together in one spot, they can chop our head off.
[42:35.520 --> 42:37.520]  We don't want a one-headed hydra.
[42:37.520 --> 42:41.520]  Not if we have guns.
[42:41.520 --> 42:46.520]  Well, I mean, again, sir, the answer is having 50 free states.
[42:46.520 --> 42:50.520]  The answer is multifaceted.
[42:50.520 --> 42:51.520]  True.
[42:51.520 --> 42:56.520]  I just think that the free state project has a lot of potential.
[42:56.520 --> 43:02.520]  It does, but if you only have one state doing it, it can be infiltrated and bought off and damaged.
[43:02.520 --> 43:03.520]  That's how the enemy attacks.
[43:03.520 --> 43:10.520]  Everything they do is built along widespread operations that go in at one big target.
[43:10.520 --> 43:13.520]  We need multifaceted info war.
[43:13.520 --> 43:20.520]  Look, I'm telling you, folks, the number one thing you got to do is spread the word that offshore banks have taken over the
[43:20.520 --> 43:26.520]  government of the National Security Act and are bankrupting the country and that it's fraudulent, that it's illegitimate,
[43:26.520 --> 43:29.520]  that it's criminal, and that we say no.
[43:29.520 --> 43:32.520]  I mean, they're getting ready to put troops on the streets, folks.
[43:32.520 --> 43:42.520]  That's what we're announcing.
[44:02.520 --> 44:31.520]  Thank you.
[44:32.520 --> 44:36.520]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.

[47:55.520 --> 48:03.520]  But I want to go ahead and go into more detail on Obama's change, expanding the power of the National Security Council and the shadow government.
[48:03.520 --> 48:12.520]  A story by Kurt Nemo that's reporting on what is in the Washington Post today. Obama's NSC will get new power.
[48:12.520 --> 48:18.520]  Here we go. This is up on infowars.com. Right now needs to go viral.
[48:18.520 --> 48:21.520]  They can't get away with this until people understand what it is.
[48:21.520 --> 48:27.520]  On February 8, Karen DeYoung, writing for the CIA's favorite newspaper, they admittedly run it,
[48:27.520 --> 48:33.520]  the Washington Post reported that President Obama's plans to order a sleeping overhaul of the National Security Council,
[48:33.520 --> 48:44.520]  what Bush was already setting up, see, it's seamless, expanded its membership and increasing its authority to set strategy across a wide spectrum of international and domestic issues.
[48:44.520 --> 48:49.520]  That's a quote from the Washington Post. This is outside of Congress' control.
[48:49.520 --> 48:55.520]  According to National Security Advisor and former Marine Corps Commandant James L. Jones, who's a big globalist,
[48:55.520 --> 49:03.520]  the world that we live in has changed so dramatically that in this decade, that organizations that were created to meet a certain set of criteria,
[49:03.520 --> 49:09.520]  like the Bellarites Constitution, they keep calling Posse Commentatus, outdated, no longer are terribly useful.
[49:09.520 --> 49:16.520]  Obama will issue a presidential directive that will expand the NSC's reach, this is quoting Jones, General Jones,
[49:16.520 --> 49:22.520]  far beyond the range of additional policies, issues, and turn it into a much more elastic body.
[49:22.520 --> 49:26.520]  So dangerous is the world now, he goes on, they have to have it.
[49:26.520 --> 49:34.520]  Now, all, it says, he, quoting General Jones, all law enforcement agencies, the Drug Enforcement Administration,
[49:34.520 --> 49:41.520]  all those things will be merged into the NSC and embrace a broader membership.
[49:41.520 --> 49:48.520]  And it goes into the National Security Act in 1947 that allowed the CIA to be created and for the shadow government to start.
[49:48.520 --> 49:54.520]  They're not just rolling the entire government into that. The legislation created as the CIA institutionalized under the rubric
[49:54.520 --> 50:01.520]  of national security justification for new weapons systems, huge military expenditures, and military interventions in the third world.
[50:01.520 --> 50:03.520]  Now they're just taking over the U.S.
[50:03.520 --> 50:12.520]  Continuing, national security state institutions like the NSC and the CIA are also dangerous because they greatly expand the power of the
[50:12.520 --> 50:19.520]  state, and thereby threaten the constitutional system of checks and balances, writes Jack Nelson, Paul Mir, in the book,
[50:19.520 --> 50:27.520]  Brave New World Order. The institutions that make up the national security state apparatus are supposedly set up to defend national security
[50:27.520 --> 50:36.520]  and the integrity of the state. However, they often abuse power, violate national international laws, and may actually erode the democracy
[50:36.520 --> 50:47.520]  they supposedly defend. Senate investigations led by Frank Church in 1975 detailed numerous illegal activities conducted by the CIA against
[50:47.520 --> 50:54.520]  U.S. and foreign individuals and groups. The recent Iran-Contra scandal offers frightening testimonies to abuses of power by the
[50:54.520 --> 50:58.520]  National Security Council. Yeah, they were setting up concentration camps then, but got caught.
[50:58.520 --> 51:06.520]  We have the National Security Council hearings, including numerous violations of the U.S. Constitution. It appears the ruling elite will now expand
[51:06.520 --> 51:13.520]  these abuses of power and numerous violations of the U.S. Constitution far beyond the Defense Department and a little bit of the State Department
[51:13.520 --> 51:22.520]  from a quote. As Jones characterizes it, in one fell swoop, Obama may expand the reach of the Pentagon, the CIA, and the military industrial complex
[51:22.520 --> 51:31.520]  President Eisenhower warned against in his farewell 1961 farewell speech to the nation. New NSC directorates will deal with such
[51:31.520 --> 51:38.520]  departments spanning 21st century issues as cyber security, that means taking over the web, as they've announced they'll do, through the Violent
[51:38.520 --> 51:45.520]  Radicalization Act, energy, climate change is in there. Just the odd directives. That means shutting down your businesses, your farms, your
[51:45.520 --> 51:52.520]  businesses. Nation building, that means attacking nations, and infrastructure, seizing roads for the North American Union. Many of the functions of the
[51:52.520 --> 51:58.520]  Homeland Security Council established as a separate White House entity by President Bush after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001
[51:58.520 --> 52:12.520]  may be rolled into the expanded NSC, although it is still undetermined what elements of the HSC will remain as a separate body within the White
[52:12.520 --> 52:22.520]  House. In other words, with the struggle of a pen, Obama has taken the military and intelligence policy making and control functions of the
[52:22.520 --> 52:30.520]  new shadow government operating under the cover of the NSC unanswerable to Congress or the American people. Will dictate energy policy,
[52:30.520 --> 52:37.520]  computer network security, climate change mandates, national infrastructure and Homeland Security surveillance grid, which controls every federal
[52:37.520 --> 52:49.520]  agency itself. It should be noted that the secret 5,412 committee, now known simply as the special group responsible for black operations,
[52:49.520 --> 52:59.520]  secret operations, is a component of the NSC of the folks that ship in the most of the narcotics. According to the research of David Guyatt,
[52:59.520 --> 53:07.520]  the secret gold tree, the truth behind World War II gold, Nazi plunder, and elite plans to control our financial future, remember the Nazis
[53:07.520 --> 53:17.520]  funded and tried to hire then head Marine Smedley Butler, who was about to be commandant, to do what James L. Jones is now doing. I would just add that
[53:17.520 --> 53:30.520]  and the book covers it, and he blew the whistle and it didn't happen. In 1935, the 5,412 committee, which met in room 4 at the CIA headquarters in
[53:30.520 --> 53:37.520]  Lainley, Virginia, became the de facto parallel government of the United States, a fact that was later acknowledged by President Eisenhower in his speech
[53:37.520 --> 53:44.520]  regarding the dangers of the military industrial complex. At the heart of the U.S. secret government lay a doctrine that was driven by the twin goals of
[53:44.520 --> 53:52.520]  reinforcing the private interests that largely control the state, that means foreign banks robbing you, and maintaining an international environment in which
[53:52.520 --> 53:59.520]  they can prosper, that means taking over other countries, so enslaving us and using us as an engine to take over others. The broader interests of the people
[53:59.520 --> 54:09.520]  are not permitted to enter the equation, which is reserved entirely for the men of wealth and power that have a seat in the system. As the post-story quotes
[54:09.520 --> 54:17.520]  Jones deputy, John O. Brennan, a CIA veteran who serves as presidential advisor for counterterrorism and homeland security, quote,
[54:17.520 --> 54:26.520]  will review options for the Homeland Council, including its responsibility for preparing for and responding to natural and terrorism-related
[54:26.520 --> 54:34.520]  domestic disasters. And then it just goes into how they're setting up Homeland Security. We have links to the Army War College, links to the Army's
[54:34.520 --> 54:41.520]  own announcements that they are preparing to engage the American people, that Northcom's main mission is to suppress civil unrest and to stop
[54:41.520 --> 54:48.520]  governors from declaring state sovereignty and resisting a takeover. That's why you have seven states passing or trying to pass laws that are
[54:48.520 --> 54:56.520]  mentioning this right now. I mean, the states even know that aren't fully controlled. On January 27th, Paul Watson, Writing for Prison
[54:56.520 --> 55:04.520]  Planet, reported on a bill introduced in Congress authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to set up a network of FEMA camp facilities to be used to
[55:04.520 --> 55:11.520]  house U.S. citizens in the event of a national emergency. Ominously, the bill also states that the camps can be used to meet other appropriate needs,
[55:11.520 --> 55:18.520]  and from previous NSC documents, we know that means putting us in the camps, as a term by the Secretary of Homeland Security, an open-ended mandate which
[55:18.520 --> 55:24.520]  many fear could mean the forced detention of American citizens, well, I've been at the Urban Warfare drills, the troops are training for it,
[55:24.520 --> 55:30.520]  he says they're getting ready. In the event of a widespread rioting and or national emergency or total economic collapse, wrote Watson.
[55:30.520 --> 55:38.520]  Obama's directive will pass operational responsibility for the proposed network of internment camps from the Department of Homeland Security directly to the
[55:38.520 --> 55:47.520]  parallel government in the National Security Council. The DHS plan soon to become a plan implemented by the NSC and the Special Group,
[55:47.520 --> 55:54.520]  followed on the heels of the Pentagon announcement late last year that it expects to have 20,000 uniformed troops inside the United States,
[55:54.520 --> 56:02.520]  trained to help state and local officials respond to nuclear terror attack or other domestic catastrophe, including crowd control and riots.
[56:02.520 --> 56:10.520]  As the Washington Post described on December 1, 2008, the Pentagon plan calls for three rapid reaction forces to be ready for emergency response by
[56:10.520 --> 56:20.520]  September 2011. The first 4,700-person unit built around an active-duty combat brigade based at Fort Stewart, Georgia, was available as of October 1,
[56:20.520 --> 56:29.520]  and General Victor R. Reinhardt, Jr., Commander of the U.S. Northern Command. That's a quote from him. According to Burt B. Tussing,
[56:29.520 --> 56:37.520]  Director of Homeland Defense and Security Issues at the U.S. Army War College Center for Strategic Leadership, the new Pentagon approach breaks the
[56:37.520 --> 56:46.520]  mold by assessing active-duty combat brigade to the Northern Command for the first time. It also federalizes all state guards and the states,
[56:46.520 --> 56:52.520]  making governors federal officers in the military who serve at the pleasure of the National Security Council, the President of the Pentagon,
[56:52.520 --> 57:04.520]  or its designates. So, I mean, this is it. Regional governors will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station will back up that threat.
[57:04.520 --> 57:12.520]  It now appears, doesn't appear, it's a fact. The ruling elite have plans to break many more molds as they continue their slow-motion coup d'état against the
[57:12.520 --> 57:19.520]  Constitution of the American people while the banking looting goes on. Obama was installed to add finishing touches to the globalist plan,
[57:19.520 --> 57:26.520]  and to be a messianic populator to carry it out, to decimate the Constitution, destroy the sovereignty of the United States, impose a military dictatorship of the
[57:26.520 --> 57:35.520]  particular importance to the parallel government as the engineered implosion of the global economy commences, and reduce the greatest nation on Earth to a
[57:35.520 --> 57:42.520]  third-world status. And then that will make everybody become domesticated and institutionalized, because even if you have money in the bank,
[57:42.520 --> 57:53.520]  they're planning to devalue it the next 24 months, I would add. Excellent report from Kurt Nemo, and it's a very dry report.
[57:53.520 --> 58:02.520]  It probably only covers 10% of the nightmare, but people will have trouble believing this, but every statement in here links to a hyperlink with the government documents,
[58:02.520 --> 58:10.520]  legislations, presidential decision directives. Go read it for yourself. Second hour straight ahead, your phone calls and the attack on free speech,

[58:52.520 --> 59:09.520]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency, is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.

[1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:49.520]  Hi, RNUSA Radio News. I'm Jody Jordan. Congressional Democrats and Republicans remain sharply divided over what kind of economic stimulus is needed to pull the country out of a recession. Here's Tim McGuire.
[1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:55.520]  Nevada GOP Senator John Ensign tells NBC's Meet the Press Congress has only one shot to get it right.
[1:00:55.520 --> 1:00:57.520]  You don't get do-overs with a trillion dollars.
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:06.520]  Missouri Democrat Claire McCaskill, also on Meet the Press, says too many people in Congress seem stuck on the process rather than getting the bill out and the money into the economy.
[1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:13.520]  The building is on fire, and what we typically do in Washington is argue what color of fire truck do we send to the scene.
[1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:20.520]  White House officials are also worried that the $100 billion in changes made to the Senate bailout bill may do more harm than good.
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:22.520]  Tim McGuire, Washington.
[1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:30.520]  In Lawrence Summers, one of President Barack Obama's top economic advisors says local and state governments need infusion of federal dollars.
[1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:33.520]  This is IRNUSA Radio News.
[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:40.520]  My name is Michael Delozier. We live in West Georgia. I've been with Andy Willoughby's three-step plan for the past three months.
[1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:46.520]  I love that Andy Willoughby's three-step plan has some credibility because I find that people are asking me, how can I get there?
[1:01:46.520 --> 1:01:54.520]  I thought, wow, if all these people want to actually build a business and they're all coming into Andy Willoughby's three-step plan, I thought, well, this is really great.
[1:01:54.520 --> 1:01:57.520]  I got to do it, and the Lord blessed it, and it's just been wonderful.
[1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:00.520]  With Andy Willoughby's three-step plan, I make a friend and a business partner.
[1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:07.520]  I want to build a business that can minister to my family and I can minister to others and have some flexibility to go on mission strips.
[1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:12.520]  It's just a great program. It's really been a blessing to me. It's been fun. It's brilliant.
[1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:21.520]  The way it's all put together, especially with the credibility there, if you enjoy people and giving people an opportunity to change their life, then why wouldn't you like this?
[1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:33.520]  Hi. How in the world are you anyway? I'm Andy Willoughby. Go to threestepplan.com or call 800-480-2102.
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:40.520]  A handful of survivors are describing their escape from a plane that crashed in a muddy river in the Amazon rainforest.
[1:02:40.520 --> 1:02:45.520]  They say they only managed to get out because they were seated near an emergency door in the back.
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:51.520]  They swam to safety as the plane sank, dragging at least 24 others to their deaths.
[1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:59.520]  Here's to Les Zazzoni. Among the 24 people who died, there were seven children, nine women, and eight men.
[1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:06.520]  Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell has been subpoenaed to testify tomorrow at the federal corruption trial of a former state senator.
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:12.520]  Lawyers for Vincent Fumo plan to ask Rendell about how the two powerful Philadelphia Democrats work together.
[1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:20.520]  Fumo is accused of misusing millions of dollars that belong to the state, the Maritime Museum, and the nonprofit community group.
[1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:25.520]  And he's just not that into you. He's been drawing people into theaters this weekend.
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:28.520]  The ensemble romance is tops at the box office.

[1:03:33.520 --> 1:03:37.520]  Did you know the average household owes over 25,000 in credit card debt?
[1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:40.520]  And 65% of those households can only afford the minimum monthly payment.
[1:03:40.520 --> 1:03:42.520]  Are you in a debt trap? You can't get out of.
[1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:44.520]  I can't keep this up. I need relief.

[1:04:03.520 --> 1:04:13.520]  Republican Senator John McCain is accusing Democrats of doing the same thing he says Republicans did during the Bush administration, not listening to the opposition.
[1:04:13.520 --> 1:04:19.520]  McCain, on CBS, criticized the way Democratic lawmakers are putting together an economic stimulus plan.
[1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:29.520]  We're going to mask the largest debt in the history of this country by any measurement and we're going to ask our kids and grandkids to pay for it.
[1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:34.520]  More from the Sunday talk shows on the stimulus plan was Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill.
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:38.520]  She says Washington must spark the nation's banks to increase their lending.
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:45.520]  We cannot have this economy recover if we can't figure out a way for these banks to start making more loans.
[1:04:45.520 --> 1:04:55.520]  We're beginning to make more loans because of what we did last year but we've got to have more and we've got to characterize this not as saving the banks but saving the economy.
[1:04:55.520 --> 1:04:59.520]  Gaza militants have fired rockets at southern Israel. Here's Mark Levy.
[1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:05.520]  Palestinian militants fired two rockets at southern Israel. They didn't hurt anyone but it's triggering an Israeli response.
[1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:09.520]  Israel has determined it will always head back for rocket fire now.
[1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:13.520]  The rocket fire violates an informal truce with Palestinian militants.
[1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:22.520]  Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers meanwhile are working through intermediaries on a long term ceasefire deal two days before Israeli elections.
[1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:29.520]  And in today's Orlando signal, a eulogy of Kayleigh Anthony has prompted donations to a number of organizations.

[1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:10.520]  Now live from Austin, Texas. Here's Alex Jones.
[1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:19.520]  We are now into our number two. Your phone call is coming up here in just a few minutes and a ton of other vital news I haven't gotten to yet.
[1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:25.520]  You know, George Bush tripled the size of government. Bill Clinton before him expanded the size.
[1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:31.520]  Ronald Reagan made it bigger. George Bush Sr. made it bigger. Kennedy made it bigger. Nixon made it bigger. It doesn't matter.
[1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:38.520]  It's bigger and bigger because big financial interests, corporations, the big elite corporations, they like the corporate welfare.
[1:07:38.520 --> 1:07:43.520]  They like using government to go shut down their smaller competition with regulation.
[1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:52.520]  A very small part of overall government is actually welfare. Most of its interest to offshore banks on our debt and corporate welfare.
[1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:58.520]  So you hear the Republicans talk about the Democrats wanting to expand government right now. You bet they are.
[1:07:58.520 --> 1:08:05.520]  And the Republicans just now claim they're coming to their senses. That's because they're out of power now and they can play that game.
[1:08:05.520 --> 1:08:08.520]  They are bought and paid for by the very same people.
[1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:17.520]  So we have to address that and understand that or they'll keep just switching the two parties up on us at each election and fooling the population.
[1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:23.520]  You know, last hour I covered some pretty scary news about how they built FEMA camps for the American people.
[1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:29.520]  It's openly announced. The North Comm and the military is announcing they're preparing to fight the American people.
[1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:34.520]  They're announcing that the governors have basically been turned into federal viceroys or front men.
[1:08:34.520 --> 1:08:41.520]  They're announcing that Congress more and more is being removed from the decision making process via PDD 51.
[1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:47.520]  And the Washington Post is announcing it like it's a good thing.
[1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:55.520]  And a lot of people are emailing me and calling and saying, yeah, Alex, you did talk about how they're building FEMA camps and how they use the financial collapse all these years to sell it.
[1:08:55.520 --> 1:09:03.520]  But, you know, they're just now announcing all this. They're just now building it. No, they've been building it quietly for decades and training police and military
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:09.520]  people to go along with it and finding out what counties and cities and states weren't going to go along with it.
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:19.520]  And now the entire military buildup is designed and openly announcing that it is to take over the states, the counties, the cities, the courthouses, the schools.
[1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:27.520]  This is high treason. This is outrageous. But the globalists are smart.
[1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:32.520]  They're in power for a reason. They're going to sell this to you through crises.
[1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:35.520]  Oh, we've got to take your rights because terrorists attacked us.
[1:09:35.520 --> 1:09:39.520]  Oh, we've got to give the banks unlimited power and let them steal trillions to save the economy.
[1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:42.520]  Or a depression will come.
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:47.520]  Oh, we've got to have North Commonwealth streets of America because people are going to riot and crimes going to explode.
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:56.520]  When they knew the entire time putting millions and millions of Americans in prison would train them how to be hardcore criminals and then they would go out and train others to be criminals.
[1:09:56.520 --> 1:10:00.520]  They know putting a lot of people in prison actually increases crime.
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:04.520]  They're social engineers. They did the studies that we quote.
[1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:12.520]  They knew that by imploding the economy and getting everybody in debt that it would end in riots and destabilization and economy falling apart.
[1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:16.520]  That's why all these leaders run around and say we're going into a depression. We're going into a depression.
[1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:21.520]  They want to destroy confidence to implode things so they can buy up all the infrastructure.
[1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:26.520]  And then if you politically don't like it, they'll just sit Northcom on you.
[1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:30.520]  So we have to reach out to the police, the military now and tell them this story.
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:42.520]  Show them the documents. Show them my films, my police state series, in game terror storm, all of them so that they know the big picture.
[1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:44.520]  And so they understand.
[1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:47.520]  And the proofs in the pudding. I mean, you can see films I made a decade ago.
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:52.520]  It's all accurate. It all came through. We were 100%.
[1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:57.520]  Why is that? Because we read their own documents. Here's just one snapshot.
[1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:07.520]  IMF World Bank documents, a couple thousand pages get leaked right around the time Joseph Stiglitz, the chief economist, World Bank, leaves in 2001 in December.
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:10.520]  2002, they come out in the BBC.
[1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:13.520]  We had other documents and other congressional hearings and others.
[1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:17.520]  And it was the internal IMF World Bank agreements, how they take our tax money.
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:20.520]  They go pay off politicians. They buy off third world governments.
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:23.520]  They tell them to run up big debts and not pay them back.
[1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:33.520]  The politicians that sell the country out, retire to Spain or Switzerland or the Cook Islands or wherever they go, the Bahamas.
[1:11:33.520 --> 1:11:41.520]  And then the nation implodes and then martial law is brought in and the people are literally enslaved and everything's taken from them.
[1:11:41.520 --> 1:11:48.520]  That's what they're doing here because the IMF documents state that they're planning to do it in Europe and the U.S.
[1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:53.520]  And I told you folks that it would look like 2008 to 2010 was the time.
[1:11:53.520 --> 1:12:00.520]  I wrote that in my book, The Sentent to Terony, published in February of 2002.
[1:12:00.520 --> 1:12:05.520]  I mean, I've written books on this. I've made films on this.
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:10.520]  And so a lot of cops are all hopped up on roids or power trips.
[1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:16.520]  A lot of them are good, but the directorship they're under, the leadership they're under is corrupt and they feel like they're on the winning team.
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:19.520]  They feel like it's the state maintaining order.
[1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:21.520]  No, you're being set up as well.
[1:12:21.520 --> 1:12:24.520]  Your pension funds are going to be taken as well.
[1:12:24.520 --> 1:12:32.520]  And to the military, read the Declaration of Independence and then compare that to what the federal government's doing today and ask me, who is the enemy?
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:34.520]  Is this a legitimate government?
[1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:39.520]  Now, they know most of the troops in questionnaires they've given them, like 29 Palms is the best known.
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:46.520]  1994, would they fire on US citizens in order to confiscate guns under a presidential decision directive?
[1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:49.520]  76% said no.
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:54.520]  They were sent overseas. They were given deadly inoculations. They were kicked out of the military.
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:12:59.520]  Now they've been put on a list of people that can't own guns under the PTSD designation.
[1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:02.520]  But the 24% that said yes.
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:05.520]  And they gave the questionnaire over and over again.
[1:13:05.520 --> 1:13:08.520]  They get promoted. They become police commanders.
[1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:12.520]  They get put in black ops all around you.
[1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:21.520]  And now they're openly announcing it in the fusion centers, the FEMA camps, the command bases that are federalizing our local cities and counties.
[1:13:21.520 --> 1:13:28.520]  And everything we told you they would do is now happening word for word.
[1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:31.520]  Now, let me tell you what's coming in the future.
[1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:37.520]  They are going to stage more terror attacks in Europe, the Middle East, the United States in the next two years, unless we get the word out.
[1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:39.520]  They are going to continue to steal trillion after trillion.
[1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:42.520]  They're going to pass a new banker quote bailout.
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:50.520]  The first one gave them unlimited power and allowed offshore banks to have unlimited treasury money and no review by Congress or any court in the land.
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:53.520]  So why would they need a new bill if they were given unlimited power before?
[1:13:53.520 --> 1:14:01.520]  Well, because they're abolishing Congress's last link of control in the House and Senate banking committees over the banks.
[1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:10.520]  And it's going to be transferred to a new international bank that will globally set interest rates and that will set the value of currencies daily.
[1:14:10.520 --> 1:14:11.520]  This is now being announced.
[1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:13.520]  We told you a decade ago what happened.
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:17.520]  We had the trilateral commission documents.
[1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:25.520]  Now it's mainstream news, but they're putting spin on it saying it's the solution to the crisis.
[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:32.520]  We've got about 15% real inflation right now across the board, except in a few commodities like oil and natural gas.
[1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:33.520]  All the others are up.
[1:14:33.520 --> 1:14:38.520]  It will be 20% by the end of the year and probably 25% by the middle of next year.
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:42.520]  That will erode those of you that didn't get into debt and had savings.
[1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:51.520]  Riots will start breaking out in the next year and a half in the United States and they'll have beta test where the army goes out and stores order, does a good job, isn't abusive.
[1:14:51.520 --> 1:14:55.520]  And they'll say, see the precedent set to use the army.
[1:14:55.520 --> 1:15:04.520]  And they'll have case after case where the army goes into people, helps them, does a good job, north com, the threat integration centers.
[1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:08.520]  They'll have starving inner city people begging to be led into the FEMA camps.
[1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:12.520]  They'll show news image of rock bands in their plan for them.
[1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:16.520]  But then they'll talk about riots and problems and crime in the camp.
[1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:20.520]  They'll say, don't worry, we've got stockades in the camp.
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:32.520]  And then, of course, they have all their other quasi-secret camps like the civilian inmate labor camp program, but they'll only advertise the public camps.
[1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:34.520]  This is happening everywhere.
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:40.520]  They'll use any ice storm, any disaster to put in permanent FEMA centers like they have at the old Highland Mall here in Austin, Texas.
[1:15:40.520 --> 1:15:42.520]  Then it'll stay in place.
[1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:44.520]  And again, this isn't Alex Jones.
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:45.520]  How did you know?
[1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:47.520]  How did you guess it all exactly?
[1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:53.520]  And you said they'd have preachers there and it's in the bill to tell their flocks to go to the camps and turn in their guns.
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:54.520]  It's in the documents.
[1:15:54.520 --> 1:15:55.520]  It's in the documents.
[1:15:55.520 --> 1:15:56.520]  That's the only reason I knew.
[1:15:56.520 --> 1:16:02.520]  I, in 1996, started reading about urban warfare drills in local papers.
[1:16:02.520 --> 1:16:09.520]  It would say in newspapers that Delta Force was there bribing people and CIA were buying off the town and they were building weird camps.
[1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:16.520]  And I'd cover it and get laughed at because it was never in the national news or regional news, just local news.
[1:16:16.520 --> 1:16:22.520]  Folks, all the bankers have to do is get control of the government, then they can steal everything.
[1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:24.520]  This is a criminal hijacking.
[1:16:24.520 --> 1:16:25.520]  It's a heist.
[1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:27.520]  It's a Wall Street takeover.
[1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:30.520]  That's what the neural order is, is banks taking over your government.
[1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:32.520]  Stay with us.
[1:16:32.520 --> 1:16:38.520]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:43.520]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:49.520]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[1:16:49.520 --> 1:16:55.520]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[1:16:55.520 --> 1:16:58.520]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[1:16:58.520 --> 1:17:01.520]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:05.520]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:10.520]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[1:17:10.520 --> 1:17:14.520]  Do your part, alkalize, and supercharge your body now.
[1:17:14.520 --> 1:17:23.520]  Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:38.520]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S. dollar has been evaluating.
[1:18:38.520 --> 1:18:42.520]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:45.520]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:47.520]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:50.520]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[1:18:50.520 --> 1:18:59.520]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now,
[1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:03.520]  your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800,
[1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:07.520]  but your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million.
[1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:09.520]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[1:20:50.720 --> 1:21:07.720]  What did presidential candidate Barry Goldwater have to say in his book with no apologies, 1964, when he was running against Lyndon Baines Johnson for president?
[1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:14.720]  Now this is who Obama has filled his cabinet with. This is who General James L. Jones is with.
[1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:29.720]  Mr. Berg, CFR Tri-Lateral Commission. The Tri-Lateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by seizing control of the political government of the United States.
[1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:40.720]  The Tri-Lateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power, political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical.
[1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:49.720]  What the Tri-Lateral Commission intends to do is to create a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nation states involved.
[1:21:49.720 --> 1:21:53.720]  As managers and creators of the system, they will rule the future.
[1:21:53.720 --> 1:22:00.720]  Now that's exactly what's happening. Foreign offshore banks have spent decades buying off the government.
[1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:11.720]  They're now declaring martial law within the government under PDD 51 and others and the National Security Council. And every president they've had for decades has been their servant.
[1:22:11.720 --> 1:22:15.720]  It's happening. You can't live in denial. I know a lot of you won't listen.
[1:22:15.720 --> 1:22:24.720]  But when they take your pension funds and you're being issued out of the back of an army truck, your new National ID card that has the new digital creds so you can eat.
[1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:32.720]  When they take everything you've got, then you can fight, then you can spread the word, then you will remember that you were warned and told.
[1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:42.720]  Or people can spread the information we're putting out virally and they won't be able to get away with this because it's so outrageous and so criminal.
[1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:47.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Canada. I'm going to move to these calls quickly. Kevin, you're on the air.
[1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:48.720]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:49.720]  Good, sir.
[1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:59.720]  I just want to ask, I just came across an information about the Queen cancelling her trip to Dubai and something about an illegal transfer to Citibank or from Citibank.
[1:22:59.720 --> 1:23:15.720]  I don't know about the Queen of England cancelling her trip to Dubai, but I do know that the Queen of England a few months ago when the parliament was about to throw out their puppet, she had her governor general declare the parliament had no power because then truth, she still runs it.
[1:23:15.720 --> 1:23:25.720]  Another thing too, I had watched a video of yours because someone had uploaded on YouTube about guillotine and I could never come back across it again, but I just didn't believe that was my video.
[1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:27.720]  I've never put a video out about guillotines.
[1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:46.720]  Well, no, you just mentioned an order for 30,000 that America had taken order of and you're just impassing on one of those videos where you're just reading the papers, but now I've come across the information that HP 1274 in Georgia is basically legislation in order to have it so that using the guillotine is now a method of execution.
[1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:48.720]  This has been passed in law since 19...
[1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:56.720]  Oh, yes, I mean, I know they passed laws to use that as a method of execution, yes. Julian, in Montana, you're on the air.
[1:23:56.720 --> 1:23:57.720]  Hi, Alex.
[1:23:57.720 --> 1:23:58.720]  Hi.
[1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:08.720]  I just wanted to say that the Robert Winnick kid was just so awesome because I was kind of in the same position as him back when I was in 11th and 12th grade.
[1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:13.720]  I was a kid who came with the Constitution to class and shown everybody these things fluoride.
[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:18.720]  And they told you, they called you to the principal's office like him and said he wasn't allowed to talk about the Constitution?
[1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:28.720]  Well, not exactly, but I did get an entire classroom just to get... they got into that group thing and they just...
[1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:31.720]  like the whole classroom was trying to just put me down and debate.
[1:24:31.720 --> 1:24:36.720]  It was like they were a group of body snatchers and you were the last human. They were pointing and hissing, yes.
[1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:38.720]  Well, they liked being slaves. It's fun to be slaves.
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:39.720]  Oh, I was so sick.
[1:24:39.720 --> 1:24:41.720]  It's fun to be bamboozled and be conned.
[1:24:41.720 --> 1:24:48.720]  But after that, I kind of stopped being so open with it because I felt so alone, you know?
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:53.720]  Well, you had to keep getting the info to them and down the road they will wake up.
[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:59.720]  Yeah, and well, now I go down to the grocery store and I see all kinds of...
[1:24:59.720 --> 1:25:08.720]  I see guys with 9-11 inside job stickers on their cars and I was on a plane the other day going to Virginia.
[1:25:08.720 --> 1:25:13.720]  I moved a few seats behind me. Some guy was talking about the founders and true conservatism.
[1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:17.720]  And then I moved to the back because the guy next to me was just like an evil little guy.
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:19.720]  I just didn't like it because he...
[1:25:19.720 --> 1:25:24.720]  Now, everywhere. Sir, we've got different polls and market research we've seen,
[1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:28.720]  but more than half the country now knows about the New World Order and hates the government.
[1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:31.720]  They're just hoping some of them that Obama would do what he said,
[1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:34.720]  but it's becoming apparent he's a liar and a puppet too.
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:39.720]  So we've got a good chance of beating this if we spread the word now about what's really happening.
[1:25:39.720 --> 1:25:47.720]  By the way, my Obama film is coming out March 15th. Check it out at TheObamaDeception.net.
[1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:51.720]  There's a big banner on the right-hand side of infowars.com. Go watch the trailer for that.
[1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:55.720]  Anthony N. Georgian. By the way, we don't get into where he was really born
[1:25:55.720 --> 1:25:59.720]  and the stupid communist background stuff. That's just his foundation front.
[1:25:59.720 --> 1:26:06.720]  We get into what his policies are, who really runs him, and what his agenda is, and it's hardcore.
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:09.720]  Anthony N. Georgia, you're on the air.
[1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:11.720]  Hey, Alex, since we're taking a call.
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:12.720]  Yes, sir.
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:15.720]  I just want to report a few things, so much going on inside to tell what to say.
[1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:20.720]  But a few weeks ago, I went to the movie The Years, and I saw the movie Valkyrie with Tom Cruise,
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:24.720]  the newest one he made, and it was pretty good. It was pretty much an instruction manual
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:26.720]  for what this country needs to do one at a time.
[1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:31.720]  Yeah, well, it's a true story. Hitler had a martial law control grid under his National Security Council
[1:26:31.720 --> 1:26:38.720]  over every city, and some of his staff tried to use Operation Valkyrie as a reverse
[1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:43.720]  to use that to take over Germany, reverse it through the martial law grid.
[1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:48.720]  Right, right. And I swear to God, Alex, I looked to the left and right
[1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:54.720]  and about half the movie theater was asleep. I was amazed. It was like I was one.
[1:26:54.720 --> 1:26:58.720]  Notice the media normally loves Holocaust movies, but they demonize the movie.
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:00.720]  They attacked it because they don't like that message.
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:05.720]  They don't want you thinking about martial law grids, and people should go see the movie
[1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:10.720]  because it's historical down to the T. I haven't seen the film.
[1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:14.720]  I saw a review of it and have read quite a few historical books on what happened,
[1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:22.720]  just with that attempt alone, and the exact martial law grid they had has actually been adopted.
[1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:25.720]  The same group tried to overthrow, and I'm not saying he's a good guy,
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:30.720]  but tried to overthrow Roosevelt, and they tried to hire the Marine Corps Commandant,
[1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:33.720]  Spedley Butler, and he said no. Now they've got the Marine Corps Commandant,
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:38.720]  and they're going to use the Marines. That's what the Marines do. They go in and overthrow countries.
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:42.720]  Right, and it's just amazing. You know, I've sat through some boring movies.
[1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:45.720]  I've sat through Waterworld, and I've sat through an interview with Vampire,
[1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:50.720]  and I've never, ever seen so many people sleep at one time in a movie theater,
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:54.720]  and it's like they've been programmed just to shut down, you know,
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:27:58.720]  when you hear something that's informed, you know, it's actually going to help you,
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:02.720]  and, you know, it's talking in a political manner, like they just turned off,
[1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:05.720]  and, you know, it's pitiful.
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:08.720]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call. I'll jam in one more.
[1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:10.720]  Micah, North Carolina, you're on the air.
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:12.720]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:13.720]  You bet.
[1:28:13.720 --> 1:28:17.720]  One point I wanted to make was the relationship between religion and pacifism
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:20.720]  that I've seen in a lot of people when I try to wake them up.
[1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:24.720]  I understand that you're Christian. There's certainly plenty of Christians in our nation today,
[1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:28.720]  and one of the arguments that I'm getting when I try to present this new order of information to these people
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:32.720]  is that it is, in fact, a divine will of God to be pacifistic.
[1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:35.720]  Well, no, no, no. Let me stop you. I'm going to hold you over.
[1:28:35.720 --> 1:28:38.720]  Sir, three years ago we got the secret documents from pastors.
[1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:41.720]  Now it's been mainstream news confirmed.
[1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:46.720]  They have tens of thousands of preachers teaching their flocks, Romans 13,
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:51.720]  stand down to government, give them your guns, go to FEMA camps, rejoice it's of the Lord.
[1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:54.720]  Well, then the founding fathers shouldn't have fought back, or we shouldn't have fought Hitler,
[1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:57.720]  or the Chinese should have let Mao kill them, which they did.
[1:28:57.720 --> 1:29:02.720]  And so this is state paid for. How sinister is that?
[1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:07.720]  Exactly, and I completely agree with you, and I would add to that that love does not imply pacifism.
[1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:10.720]  If you love your fellow man, if you love your country, you will not be pacifistic.
[1:29:10.720 --> 1:29:12.720]  You will fight evil. You will fight oppression.
[1:29:12.720 --> 1:29:16.720]  Hey, listen, listen, I'm going to put you on hold and come back to you after the break.
[1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:19.720]  They're going to find plenty of cowards that want to cop out, listen to that,
[1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:21.720]  but there's plenty of people who aren't cowards.
[1:29:21.720 --> 1:29:25.720]  Almost all the prophets were killed for not following the government's orders.
[1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:29.720]  Christ was. It's a fraud, but it's government paid for.
[1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:32.720]  When you hear your preachers say that, it was paid for.
[1:29:34.720 --> 1:29:40.720]  It's a new year full of uncertainties. People are being laid off in record numbers.
[1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:44.720]  The price of food continues to rise, and the economy continues to falter.
[1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:50.720]  You know that you need to prepare, and maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:53.720]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.

[1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:36.720]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[1:30:36.720 --> 1:30:40.720]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[1:30:40.720 --> 1:30:46.720]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver,
[1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:52.720]  who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[1:30:52.720 --> 1:30:58.720]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level,
[1:30:58.720 --> 1:31:03.720]  and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[1:31:03.720 --> 1:31:08.720]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper,
[1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:11.720]  with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[1:31:11.720 --> 1:31:15.720]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies
[1:31:15.720 --> 1:31:19.720]  that would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[1:31:32.720 --> 1:31:37.720]  Phase one of the insiders' plan for a one-world government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[1:31:37.720 --> 1:31:41.720]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis
[1:31:41.720 --> 1:31:44.720]  to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior.
[1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:46.720]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[1:31:46.720 --> 1:31:50.720]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:54.720]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[1:31:54.720 --> 1:31:58.720]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[1:31:58.720 --> 1:32:03.720]  Phase one is a one-world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:07.720]  Phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[1:32:07.720 --> 1:32:11.720]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.

[1:32:32.720 --> 1:32:35.720]  You worry. You see the signs and worry about the future.
[1:32:35.720 --> 1:32:38.720]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[1:32:38.720 --> 1:32:40.720]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:42.720]  Your answer may be at hand.
[1:32:42.720 --> 1:32:45.720]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:50.720]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:54.720]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[1:32:54.720 --> 1:32:59.720]  The cost of learning is minimal. Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[1:32:59.720 --> 1:33:02.720]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[1:33:02.720 --> 1:33:07.720]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards and video,
[1:33:07.720 --> 1:33:11.720]  with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy.

[1:33:29.720 --> 1:33:32.720]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:38.720]  Are you tired of searching for Crick Talk Radio?
[1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:43.720]  Well, search no more. We are the GCN Radio Network.
[1:33:43.720 --> 1:33:53.720]  Throughout history, 99.9% of the time, the military, bought and paid for by private interest,
[1:33:53.720 --> 1:33:57.720]  normally the banking interest, back in the time of Rome, Julius Caesar,
[1:33:57.720 --> 1:34:03.720]  they just come in and announce some crisis and use it as an excuse to first weaken the Senate,
[1:34:03.720 --> 1:34:09.720]  weaken the legislative system and then fully make it ceremonial and then even get rid of it.
[1:34:09.720 --> 1:34:12.720]  It happens all over the world all the time. It's happened here.
[1:34:12.720 --> 1:34:14.720]  We're the big prize.
[1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:19.720]  And they're going to hurt you bad. The globalists aren't going to give you any quarter.
[1:34:19.720 --> 1:34:26.720]  Washington Post headline, half of corn syrup products have high levels of mercury in it,
[1:34:26.720 --> 1:34:27.720]  and they're not even going to take it out.
[1:34:27.720 --> 1:34:29.720]  It's all done by design, folks.
[1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:35.720]  Learn what eugenics is. Learn quickly what neo eugenics, what crypto eugenics is.
[1:34:35.720 --> 1:34:40.720]  Find out. Truth is so horrible. It's hard to believe, but it's real.
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:42.720]  But also, truth is so wonderful.
[1:34:42.720 --> 1:34:46.720]  I mean, life is great. So many innocent good people, so many hardworking people,
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:49.720]  but you judge the world according to your lens.
[1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:52.720]  The folks running the country, the world, aren't like you. They're evil.
[1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:54.720]  That's why they're in power.
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:35:00.720]  And most of the folks you see in power are just puppets to the real power structure behind the throne.
[1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:04.720]  Now, Hitler's favorite Bible verse was Romans 13.
[1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:06.720]  They used the preachers there to pacify people.
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:09.720]  Stalin did it. Mal did it. Many others did it.
[1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:16.720]  And we've got a clergy response team news clip that came out a year and a half after I first,
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:19.720]  well, the Genesis Network first broke it.
[1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:22.720]  And I don't have time to play the whole thing.
[1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:24.720]  You can just Google clergy response teams.
[1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:27.720]  There's quite a few newscasts out there.
[1:35:27.720 --> 1:35:30.720]  Now, imagine in secret, they've trained 26,000 preachers.
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:33.720]  That's us of a year ago to tell their flocks.
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:37.720]  This is classified to go say it's of the Lord.
[1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:40.720]  Lay down your guns. Play a little bit of it.
[1:35:40.720 --> 1:35:43.720]  It starts off with, will martial law ever become a reality? Here it is.
[1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:46.720]  Law ever become a reality in America?
[1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:51.720]  Some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical attack on U.S. territory
[1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:53.720]  might trigger just that.
[1:35:53.720 --> 1:35:55.720]  And as KSLA News 12 Jeff Ferrell discovered,
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:36:00.720]  the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:02.720]  Stop right there.
[1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:03.720]  Stop right there.
[1:36:03.720 --> 1:36:05.720]  From my cold, dead hand, they cut to hasten and then admit
[1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:08.720]  they're preparing for national gun confiscation during an emergency.
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:11.720]  Now, taking the guns, they won't bring you aid like New Orleans.
[1:36:11.720 --> 1:36:14.720]  They will come and get the guns and then things will break down.
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:17.720]  Then the crisis gets bigger and they can bring in more martial law.
[1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:21.720]  I remember 11 years ago videotaping the military,
[1:36:21.720 --> 1:36:24.720]  practicing to confiscate American citizens' guns,
[1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:28.720]  cooperative nugget in Louisiana and other drills.
[1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:31.720]  Now it's just openly being admitted.
[1:36:31.720 --> 1:36:34.720]  Oh, the biggest problem for the government is us.
[1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:38.720]  See, we're not the government anymore. We're the problem.
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:41.720]  So, see, oh, it's just amazing.
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:43.720]  We could play the rest of it.
[1:36:43.720 --> 1:36:45.720]  Play a little bit more and then we'll go back to the calls.
[1:36:45.720 --> 1:36:50.720]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value,
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:53.720]  the overarching desire to protect our freedoms.
[1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:56.720]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened
[1:36:56.720 --> 1:37:00.720]  during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
[1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:02.720]  U.S. troops also arrived,
[1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:06.720]  something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination
[1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:09.720]  of the 1878 Posse-Cometotus Act.
[1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:13.720]  That forbid U.S. troops from policing on American soil.
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:17.720]  If martial law weren't enacted here at home,
[1:37:17.720 --> 1:37:19.720]  like depicted in the movie The Siege,
[1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:22.720]  easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:26.720]  And that's exactly what the clergy response team, as it's called,
[1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:28.720]  helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[1:37:28.720 --> 1:37:30.720]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody
[1:37:30.720 --> 1:37:32.720]  is let's cooperate and get this thing over with
[1:37:32.720 --> 1:37:44.720]  and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:07.720]  I can't listen anymore of it.
[1:38:07.720 --> 1:38:09.720]  The point is this was set up in secret.
[1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:11.720]  They ought to be right there. They have been brainwashed
[1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:12.720]  and that's the point that I wanted to make.
[1:38:12.720 --> 1:38:14.720]  And I would add to that that at this point,
[1:38:14.720 --> 1:38:16.720]  in this present time, in the situation that we're in,
[1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:19.720]  I would dare say that it's stupid to not own a gun.
[1:38:19.720 --> 1:38:21.720]  Once they get the guns, it's all over.
[1:38:21.720 --> 1:38:23.720]  That's our last chance.
[1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:26.720]  When they've introduced bills to completely ban all semi-automatics,
[1:38:26.720 --> 1:38:29.720]  they've introduced bills where they can just,
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:32.720]  without a judge or a jury, through the quote,
[1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:34.720]  terror list, they're going to make that nationwide,
[1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:38.720]  a no-buy, no-sell list where you have to swipe a credit card
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:40.720]  or an ID even if you're paying cash.
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:42.720]  And notice stores are already doing this.
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:45.720]  They're saying this, a grid where you can't buy and sell
[1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:48.720]  or own a gun if they just put you on a list.
[1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:50.720]  And it's coming. It's coming soon
[1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:51.720]  and people need to be ready for it.
[1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:52.720]  This is our last chance.
[1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:54.720]  Well, I mean, thank you.
[1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:56.720]  I appreciate your call.
[1:38:56.720 --> 1:38:59.720]  What is that not out of a nightmare science fiction movie
[1:38:59.720 --> 1:39:03.720]  where the clergy are secretly on the government payroll
[1:39:03.720 --> 1:39:06.720]  and they're just now admitting it because they're getting ready to go public?
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:08.720]  See, when they go public, they finally admit it all.
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:10.720]  And they're admitting everything now,
[1:39:10.720 --> 1:39:12.720]  the New World Order, the North American Union,
[1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:13.720]  the world government.
[1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:17.720]  That means they've got the safety off with the martial law gun.
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:19.720]  They've got their finger on the trigger.
[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:21.720]  They got it to the republic's head.
[1:39:21.720 --> 1:39:24.720]  And all you good old boys think you're part of the system
[1:39:24.720 --> 1:39:26.720]  like you, Obama, Max and all of you.
[1:39:26.720 --> 1:39:28.720]  You're the targets, too.
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:30.720]  You're not immune.
[1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:32.720]  You're not a good old boy.
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:34.720]  You're not part of the power structure.
[1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:35.720]  They're going to get you, too.
[1:39:35.720 --> 1:39:36.720]  You understand that?
[1:39:36.720 --> 1:39:38.720]  We got to stand together.
[1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:40.720]  This is so illegitimate, so illegal.
[1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:43.720]  They staged the terror attacks,
[1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:45.720]  their own documents state they wanted to stage terror attacks
[1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:47.720]  to bring in the police state grid.
[1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:49.720]  And now they're swinging it around on the nightly news thing.
[1:39:49.720 --> 1:39:52.720]  Oh, yeah, we're going to use the anti-terror system on regular people now.
[1:39:52.720 --> 1:39:56.720]  We're going to use the military on the American people now.
[1:39:56.720 --> 1:39:58.720]  It's all happening.
[1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:00.720]  John, in Virginia, go ahead.
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:02.720]  Hi, Alex. How's it going?
[1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:03.720]  Good, sir.
[1:40:03.720 --> 1:40:07.720]  I was wondering if you could talk about...
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:10.720]  Sorry, I'm a little bit nervous.
[1:40:10.720 --> 1:40:14.720]  Didn't they actually bring the guns back in New Orleans?
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:15.720]  No.
[1:40:15.720 --> 1:40:16.720]  After that whole thing happened?
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:18.720]  No, they confiscated them and very few got them back,
[1:40:18.720 --> 1:40:20.720]  even though they won lawsuits and the state passed a law
[1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:22.720]  that it was illegal.
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:25.720]  They went to high and dry homes and confiscated the guns.
[1:40:25.720 --> 1:40:27.720]  I can play the clubs right now if you want.
[1:40:27.720 --> 1:40:30.720]  Yeah.
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:33.720]  I mean, I've got the police chief saying all the guns will be taken.
[1:40:33.720 --> 1:40:34.720]  This is martial law.
[1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:39.720]  And people can't even believe that when it happened.
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:42.720]  Sir, have you seen my police state films?
[1:40:42.720 --> 1:40:43.720]  Yes, sir.
[1:40:43.720 --> 1:40:46.720]  Actually, on your martial law one right now.
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:51.720]  Okay, well, then you've seen the video of troops training to confiscate your guns
[1:40:51.720 --> 1:40:53.720]  and admitting it's for America.
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:54.720]  Yes, sir.
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:40:57.720]  Okay, so, I mean, it's real. It's real.
[1:40:57.720 --> 1:41:00.720]  And see, the new patriotism, that's why they're propagandizing about how great it is
[1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:02.720]  to be in the military, how wonderful the troops are.
[1:41:02.720 --> 1:41:05.720]  They're getting us ready for the military to be used against us.
[1:41:05.720 --> 1:41:08.720]  Now, most of the military doesn't like it.
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:11.720]  That's why they've got large portions of the Army and the Marine Corps
[1:41:11.720 --> 1:41:12.720]  are now illegal aliens.
[1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:15.720]  They legalized to be part of the military or their aggravated felons.
[1:41:15.720 --> 1:41:16.720]  Don't believe me?
[1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:20.720]  Just Google military hiring, military recruiting aggravated felons.
[1:41:20.720 --> 1:41:22.720]  That means a violent felon.
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:25.720]  Jim, Ian, Texas, you're on the air.
[1:41:25.720 --> 1:41:26.720]  How you doing, Alex?
[1:41:26.720 --> 1:41:27.720]  Good, sir.
[1:41:27.720 --> 1:41:33.720]  Hey, I was calling, basically, to give you a little story that might sway a few skeptics.
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:37.720]  You know, last year when Georgia went into South Ossetia,
[1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:40.720]  well, that's actually what happened.
[1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:43.720]  And the media said that Russia snuck attack, thinking we're dumb.
[1:41:43.720 --> 1:41:44.720]  Exactly.
[1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:48.720]  I had a co-worker who's from Eastern Europe, and when he walked in the door
[1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:52.720]  and saw that on the news, and they had Condoleezza Rice on there and everything,
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:55.720]  he got visibly upset instead of was all alive.
[1:41:55.720 --> 1:41:59.720]  And that led me down the path of, you know, looking up,
[1:41:59.720 --> 1:42:03.720]  you know, what corporate media does and controls, you know, what's out there.
[1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:07.720]  So I did my research on the Internet, looked at your websites,
[1:42:07.720 --> 1:42:11.720]  did a lot of YouTube stuff, watched your videos, you know, just various things.
[1:42:11.720 --> 1:42:15.720]  Nothing, nothing that would be considered obsessive.
[1:42:15.720 --> 1:42:18.720]  Yeah, it starts with investigating one line, a whole universe opens.
[1:42:18.720 --> 1:42:20.720]  Oh, it's amazing.
[1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:22.720]  I've had an incredible awakening.
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:27.720]  Well, with that said, I've been working in commercial aviation for 22 years.
[1:42:27.720 --> 1:42:30.720]  All right, I've gone through several FBI checks.
[1:42:30.720 --> 1:42:35.720]  When 9-11 happened, we all had to get re-finger printed and have new checks and everything.
[1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:37.720]  And now you can't buy a gun.
[1:42:37.720 --> 1:42:39.720]  Well, no, check it out.
[1:42:39.720 --> 1:42:44.720]  I had a friend who died back in November and I had to fly out to go to his funeral.
[1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:48.720]  When I went to fly, I discovered I was on the Federal No Fly List.
[1:42:48.720 --> 1:42:52.720]  Which over a million people are on, they plan to get everybody on it.
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:55.720]  And there's no judge, no jury, it's just a blacklist.
[1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:59.720]  Exactly, and I have never been on that list.
[1:42:59.720 --> 1:43:01.720]  I mean, I've flown since September 11.
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:06.720]  Well, Obama is saying that if you're on that list, that you can't own a gun.
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:08.720]  Stay there, I want to come back and hear the rest of the story, okay?
[1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:09.720]  All right.
[1:43:09.720 --> 1:43:10.720]  Don't hang up.
[1:43:10.720 --> 1:43:13.720]  We'll come back to your calls.
[1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:17.720]  I'm going to rampage through calls in the final segment, get into the fairness doctrine.
[1:43:17.720 --> 1:43:20.720]  They promised they weren't going to do it, now they are.
[1:43:20.720 --> 1:43:24.720]  Are you one of the people who think, I have plenty of time, nothing's ever going to happen bad to me?
[1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:29.720]  Do you believe that when your cupboards are bare, our corporate controlled government will jump right into feed you and yours?
[1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:32.720]  Do you have at least a year's supply of food for your family?
[1:43:32.720 --> 1:43:35.720]  This is Kurt, the armchair survivalist, heard on this network.
[1:43:35.720 --> 1:43:38.720]  Survival enterprises sells real food, canned for long-term storage.
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:42.720]  Beef, chicken, turkey, bacon, butter, cheese, eggs, freeze-dried fruits and vegetables,
[1:43:42.720 --> 1:43:48.720]  Mountain House freeze-dried meals, MREs, a full nutritional line, the British Birkfeld water filter, and more.
[1:43:48.720 --> 1:43:51.720]  If you want to prepare now, go to beforeitstoolate.us.
[1:43:51.720 --> 1:43:56.720]  That's beforeitstoolate.us, or call 1-800-753-1981.
[1:43:56.720 --> 1:43:59.720]  That's 1-800-753-1981.
[1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:03.720]  Or you can put your head in the sand and be just another sheeple in the corporate controlled flock.
[1:44:03.720 --> 1:44:07.720]  But remember, those who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it.
[1:44:19.720 --> 1:44:23.720]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:27.720]  and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[1:44:27.720 --> 1:44:32.720]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:36.720]  One of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[1:44:36.720 --> 1:44:38.720]  It's a documented fact.
[1:44:38.720 --> 1:44:45.720]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[1:44:45.720 --> 1:44:51.720]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely
[1:44:51.720 --> 1:44:57.720]  by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[1:47:36.720 --> 1:47:45.720]  Just to briefly get into this and then back into your calls, Bill Press, Fairness Doctrine will remedy conservative media conspiracy.
[1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:54.720]  That's a quote. He wrote an article for The Washington Post saying there's no free market and talk radio today. Only the exclusive, tightly held, conservative media conspiracy.
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:48:03.720]  But that isn't conservative media. That's fake conservative media saying there's no new world order, no CFR, no such thing as a trilateral commission.
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:07.720]  Making fun of real conservatives like Barry Goldwater who warned us.
[1:48:07.720 --> 1:48:12.720]  And they don't have a total monopoly. You can go out and buy a radio station. You can get on it.
[1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:17.720]  No, the station he's on got zero ratings, and so they're changing formats.
[1:48:17.720 --> 1:48:23.720]  Bill Press' show, it's in the article, didn't even get zero ratings.
[1:48:23.720 --> 1:48:34.720]  And so he's whining and complaining, but then last week he had on Senator Stabenow and she agreed they're going to have the FCC start restricting what you can and can't do on talk radio.
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:41.720]  But they're going to leave all the big fake Republicans on who were there to pacify conservatives and bring in the new world order.
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:44.720]  It'll be people like me they go after. Pretty disgusting.
[1:48:44.720 --> 1:48:49.720]  Okay, who was it I was just talking to last? It was on the no fly list. Was it Jim?
[1:48:49.720 --> 1:48:56.720]  Jim in Texas, so you're now on a no fly list, which is going to be a no buy list.
[1:48:56.720 --> 1:49:00.720]  Two million are on it in England, over a million in the U.S. and I have a crime list.
[1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:03.720]  No judge, no jury, you're supposedly a terrorist. Why don't they go and rush you?
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:08.720]  No, it's just you won't be able to buy or sell through the new Homeland Security System.
[1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:10.720]  You'll have to swipe your card even if you're paying cash.
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:14.720]  And this is what people want. They want to be slaves, Jim. Go ahead.
[1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:23.720]  Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, all I did was just a little bit of research, you know, to try to try to find out if there's any truth to, you know, corporate controlled media.
[1:49:23.720 --> 1:49:33.720]  And just through doing that, you know, I all of a sudden out of the blue, first time I fly since I do that, I'm now on the federal no fly list.
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:38.720]  Well, yeah, they want that message out to everybody. Hey, don't do anything to us and you're not getting food.
[1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:41.720]  You're not going to fly or not. But listen, it may not be that with you.
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:48.720]  There's a lot of people whose name is similar to somebody's. But the point is it's all a load of bull.
[1:49:48.720 --> 1:49:52.720]  It doesn't protect us from terrorists. The government staged the terror attacks.
[1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:59.720]  And all it allows them to do is set the precedent that they can just, in a Kafka-esque way, just say we're all guilty.
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:06.720]  Yeah, and you know, and I did some research on being on that list. Like you said, it may not be me.
[1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:13.720]  And that's what they told me all the way. They looked at me with great suspicion. And what is called as a false positive.
[1:50:13.720 --> 1:50:15.720]  That's what they say.
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:20.720]  Yeah, but what's going to happen is they're going to lose their bank account to those little idiots working there.
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:24.720]  Let them love their petty power. Their bosses are going to hurt them real bad.
[1:50:24.720 --> 1:50:29.720]  See, that's the good news in all of this. They may be able to bring this country down.
[1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:33.720]  But all the scum that helped them is going to get hurt by their bosses.
[1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:36.720]  And all of you are going to cry for mommy. A lot of you already are.
[1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:39.720]  Why don't you wake up and fight back now before it's too late?
[1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:40.720]  Or keep being suckers.
[1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:43.720]  William N. Austin, you're on the air.
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:48.720]  Hey, Alex, I want to say that I think there's a good chance.
[1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:51.720]  Go ahead.
[1:50:51.720 --> 1:50:59.720]  Alex, I want to say there's a good chance that we're going to see maybe a multiple gunman attacker situation like in Pakistan.
[1:50:59.720 --> 1:51:03.720]  So they can justify going after everyone's guns.
[1:51:03.720 --> 1:51:06.720]  Well, I mean, the evidence is clear, and it's even in mainstream foreign news,
[1:51:06.720 --> 1:51:09.720]  that that Mumbai attack a few months ago was a stage deal.
[1:51:09.720 --> 1:51:12.720]  Right, right, right. And that's, you know, exactly what I mean.
[1:51:12.720 --> 1:51:14.720]  And I think they're going to blame it on possible.
[1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:18.720]  Hey, Aaron Zelman's a mainline head at the Jews' Preservation of Farms ownership.
[1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:21.720]  And he says he thinks the Obama people are going to stage a mass shooting here.
[1:51:21.720 --> 1:51:26.720]  Right, that's what I'm saying. That's what I think we're going to see next here as the false flag attack.
[1:51:26.720 --> 1:51:31.720]  Oh, yeah, the FBI and CIA are saying Muslims are going to shoot up shopping malls, but you watch.
[1:51:31.720 --> 1:51:33.720]  Well, I think it'll be globalist dressed up like Muslims.
[1:51:33.720 --> 1:51:36.720]  They caught British SAS and Iraq running around.
[1:51:36.720 --> 1:51:41.720]  I think there's a good chance that they'll blame it on, you know, constitutionalist right-wings, maybe even neo-Nazis.
[1:51:41.720 --> 1:51:46.720]  Oh, they're already claiming that there's white al-Qaeda everywhere working with al-Qaeda.
[1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:54.720]  Well, and we're also seeing a revillification of, you know, militia types and extremists in the media and popular culture.
[1:51:54.720 --> 1:52:01.720]  Yeah, that's anybody that doesn't like them to take their farm or ranch or their bank account or you don't like being able to not buy and sell because you're on the global list.
[1:52:01.720 --> 1:52:04.720]  You know, oh, you want some food, you're a terrorist.
[1:52:04.720 --> 1:52:10.720]  Right, right. So people I just think need to be real vigil and ready for anything to go down around them.
[1:52:10.720 --> 1:52:15.720]  I agree. Rampaging to the calls. Chris in Kentucky. Welcome, Chris.
[1:52:15.720 --> 1:52:19.720]  Yeah, thanks, Alex. I'll make it real quick and repress for time.
[1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:27.720]  Yeah, you were talking about the ice storms that we had. We had a lot of Kentucky National Guards in rural counties on the news parading with their cameras,
[1:52:27.720 --> 1:52:32.720]  walking on people's properties without permission, seeing how they're doing and kind of looking around.
[1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:38.720]  And this conditioning is making me sick. I mean, I'm not saying that the Kentucky National Guard is bad, but the problem...
[1:52:38.720 --> 1:52:42.720]  There's no longer a Kentucky National Guard under the new restructuring.
[1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:45.720]  It's completely federal and they've openly announced the governor's having no power.
[1:52:45.720 --> 1:52:49.720]  Yeah, and they had a clips of roadblocks and one National Guard says,
[1:52:49.720 --> 1:52:54.720]  if we have any desirables that act up out here, we have a place to take them. And I know what that meant.
[1:52:54.720 --> 1:53:00.720]  Wow, I'd love to have footage of that. Yeah, no, no. They've got Marines out all over the country running DUI checkpoints.
[1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:06.720]  And they go, what? You're against stopping drunks? And they've now announced that in Northcom, they're going to be on the streets,
[1:53:06.720 --> 1:53:12.720]  but helping at Carrex. You're not against the Army helping at Carrex. See how they're conditioning us?
[1:53:12.720 --> 1:53:18.720]  Exactly. Exactly. And if you have those listeners out there who've never got the police state 2000, the police state to take over,
[1:53:18.720 --> 1:53:22.720]  look at those. Before 9-11, they were talking about terrorism in those films.
[1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:28.720]  I know it's my documentaries. I appreciate it. Great call. Let's talk to Josh in North Carolina. Go ahead, Josh.
[1:53:28.720 --> 1:53:35.720]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing? So I have something of very vital importance to bring everyone's attention.
[1:53:35.720 --> 1:53:44.720]  If you go to whitehouse.gov and the top link under the briefing room and you check out the blog, the article posted on Friday
[1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:50.720]  reads, Working with Faith. And basically, I'll sum it up for you really quick for time's sake,
[1:53:50.720 --> 1:54:00.720]  Obama announced that they will be creating a new White House faith-based and neighborhood partnership position under his cabinet.
[1:54:00.720 --> 1:54:04.720]  Basically, this ties into the whole thing that you've been saying about how they...
[1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:09.720]  Oh, no, no, no. Sir, in the FEMA camp, in the FEMA camp legislation, they've already built the camps.
[1:54:09.720 --> 1:54:17.720]  It says they're going to merge local police, the clergy under HR 645, and you'll have local block clergy that lead you to the camp
[1:54:17.720 --> 1:54:22.720]  and come and knock on your door and ask you if you're a terrorist. Okay. I'm at whitehouse.gov.
[1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:29.720]  Right. On whitehouse.gov, you go to the briefing room and then click on the blog.
[1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:37.720]  And Friday's article, Working with Faith, he announced that there is now going to be a president and actual executive order
[1:54:37.720 --> 1:54:44.720]  establishing, I'm reading it worth the work, executive order establishing the new White House office of faith-based...
[1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:48.720]  That's right. They're taking over everything. And again, I have the bill.
[1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:53.720]  It says that the clergy will lead us to the camps. Here it is. I'm there. Working with faith.
[1:54:53.720 --> 1:54:59.720]  Exactly. And it says people trust them, communities rely on them, and we will help them.
[1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:05.720]  See, they're imploding the economy, knowing things are going to break down, decades quietly setting this up,
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:09.720]  and it says everything you're saying right here. Precisely. Exactly.
[1:55:09.720 --> 1:55:15.720]  It says helping people get new jobs, figuring out the role of faith-based organizations to combat global climate change.
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:21.720]  So, see, the new religion will be taxing humans. Humans are bad, only having one child.
[1:55:21.720 --> 1:55:25.720]  That's, oh my gosh, it's just... I mean, I know all this, but to see him doing it...
[1:55:25.720 --> 1:55:34.720]  Put it out in public. He put it out in public on Friday. This is, as we all know, as you know, a blatant violation of the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights.
[1:55:34.720 --> 1:55:35.720]  And of course...
[1:55:35.720 --> 1:55:41.720]  Separation of church and state, but let's expand on that. The Democrat... Folks, this is...
[1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:50.720]  They are announcing force compulsory draft, 18 to 24. That's there. It's all happening, folks. It's all happening.
[1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:52.720]  Exactly. Exactly.
[1:55:52.720 --> 1:55:56.720]  Okay, I've got to get Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, or Steve Watson to do an article on this immediately.
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:55:59.720]  But again, it's in the FEMA camp article.
[1:55:59.720 --> 1:56:03.720]  Right. Right. I mean, because they've talked about it in the bills that you've mentioned.
[1:56:03.720 --> 1:56:07.720]  Well, look at this. Defense Department announced a civilian expeditionary force.
[1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:11.720]  A new Pentagon arm, just as big, just as strong, domestically to spy on Americans.
[1:56:11.720 --> 1:56:19.720]  That's Obama's own words. All these Obama zombies on power trips, angry at any of us who don't want to go along with their new world order.
[1:56:19.720 --> 1:56:26.720]  Man, they're really going for it, man. And Limbaugh and Hannity, they're not going to tell you all this stuff.
[1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:29.720]  Or they'll tell you the Republicans are going to save you and they're going to bring the same deal.
[1:56:29.720 --> 1:56:36.720]  The good news is all these yuppies who've been laughing at me and who've helped this happen, they're going to lose everything they've got.
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:41.720]  Just understand, we're all going to get hurt in this, but at least the scum is going to get hurt, too.
[1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:45.720]  Now, a lot of the scums are going to try to join this to get power.
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:51.720]  Imagine every control freak, every nobody who can't build a business, who can't run a company, who never creates anything.
[1:56:51.720 --> 1:56:59.720]  They're all going to have their own little uniforms on power trips with all these roid head cops who've been in Iraq confiscating guns, killing 1.3 million.
[1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:03.720]  They're all coming home to America to drink our country's blood down.
[1:57:03.720 --> 1:57:08.720]  Oh, it's sick. And you're not a patriot if you don't turn your guns into the military.
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:18.720]  Oh, no, it's ridiculous. Oh, man. I mean, Jesus, and the average population are so dumbed down and so conditioned that they think that this is a good thing.
[1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:20.720]  There's even a video of him announcing it.
[1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:21.720]  Yes.
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:23.720]  This guy's doing like 20 videos a day.
[1:57:23.720 --> 1:57:24.720]  Uh-huh.
[1:57:24.720 --> 1:57:26.720]  He is the pitch man.
[1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:28.720]  You should check this out.
[1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:33.720]  Well, I guarantee you, all these preachers they name here are the head guys over each region.
[1:57:33.720 --> 1:57:41.720]  Like Dr. Ararto Chavez, Ph.D., President, CEO, Mexican American Cultural Center, San Antonio Sex, I mean, it's just all here.
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:45.720]  Dr. William J. Shaw, President, National Baptist Convention, USA.
[1:57:45.720 --> 1:57:48.720]  And they're, oh my gosh, hardcore, hardcore.
[1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:49.720]  Exactly.
[1:57:49.720 --> 1:57:51.720]  Hey, that's the kind of tips we need.
[1:57:51.720 --> 1:57:52.720]  And we don't have enough writers.
[1:57:52.720 --> 1:57:53.720]  Write an article.
[1:57:53.720 --> 1:57:55.720]  Email it to airininfowars.com.
[1:57:55.720 --> 1:57:56.720]  Get them posted.
[1:57:56.720 --> 1:57:57.720]  Help us.
[1:57:57.720 --> 1:57:59.720]  We're fighting as hard as we can and spread the word.
[1:57:59.720 --> 1:58:05.720]  The American people can defend this, we can defend the Republic, we can expose this hoax and defeat the New World Order.
[1:58:05.720 --> 1:58:06.720]  God bless you all.
[1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:35.720]  Check out TheObamaDeception.net.
