[02:08.960 --> 02:13.520]  port cities that have been recording in many cases in europe over 200 years the
[02:13.520 --> 02:18.560]  exact water line or you can go to san francisco just search engine the term
[02:18.560 --> 02:23.920]  sea level measurement san francisco you'll get hundreds of graphs from the navy
[02:24.480 --> 02:30.320]  shipping concerns the city's been keeping record since the 1840s the water level is
[02:30.320 --> 02:38.400]  down it's down it's down let me say that again down down down down down i don't
[02:38.400 --> 02:45.360]  need the you and to admit they were lying okay you can check weather pattern records
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.520]  going back hundreds of years and nothing's been recorded as well as the water level
[02:49.520 --> 02:55.840]  because that's what sailors are obsessed with navigation weather records sea levels
[02:55.840 --> 03:02.400]  absolutely incredible by the way that doesn't matter to glenn back glenn back
[03:03.360 --> 03:09.280]  i mean every day i try to not talk about this guy but he's so duplicitous so backstabbing
[03:09.280 --> 03:13.440]  he says one thing one minute the next minute one day it's we need new taxes the next day
[03:13.440 --> 03:18.080]  we've got to cut taxes or one day the patriot acts good the next day it's bad and the next day
[03:18.080 --> 03:21.840]  it's good always when it's a key time for a vote or something he supports it
[03:21.840 --> 03:29.440]  and there's a usa today big feature to interview with him don't judge beck bias cover the inside
[03:29.440 --> 03:35.440]  story of red hot conservative glenn beck reveals a softer side and then it starts out by saying he
[03:35.440 --> 03:43.600]  believes in global warming the article is called in defense of glenn beck the left to test him
[03:43.600 --> 03:47.680]  and some conservatives say he's undermining the cause the truth is he must be doing something
[03:47.680 --> 03:57.840]  right and then it goes on to have him say that he believes global warming is real i mean you cannot
[03:58.480 --> 04:05.360]  make this type of stuff up but so does sir palin but look that's not our our top stories over the
[04:05.360 --> 04:15.520]  weekend several different financial news sites like the future of capitalism

[07:59.520 --> 08:07.840]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[08:08.400 --> 08:16.160]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network waging war on corruption crashing through the lies and
[08:16.160 --> 08:22.800]  disinformation i'm alex jones we're gonna be live here for the next three hours and 52 minutes
[08:22.800 --> 08:26.880]  dr paul craig roberts breaking down the latest developments in the economy former wall street
[08:26.880 --> 08:32.240]  journal editor former head of policy at the treasury the father of ergonomics will be joining
[08:32.240 --> 08:39.600]  us to talk about the state of the world economy now i'm going to get into bank runs and the big
[08:39.600 --> 08:47.040]  developments on that front here in just a moment but later after dr roberts leaves us i want to
[08:47.040 --> 08:53.840]  get into glen back a little bit more the problem with becky is and this show covering him is that
[08:53.840 --> 08:58.800]  i'm busy making films not just a film i'm producing that i'm directing but also jason
[08:58.800 --> 09:07.040]  murmuses that is incredibly powerful invisible empire i am busy running this operation the
[09:07.040 --> 09:13.680]  business side of it i'm not complaining here and i'm busy reading government documents
[09:13.680 --> 09:20.720]  legislation conservatively i scan over probably 300 pieces of news a day i'm totally addicted
[09:20.720 --> 09:27.200]  i can't go to sleep at night all i do is read and so i have hundreds of big issues we need to
[09:27.200 --> 09:32.160]  cover and talk about why do i spend so much time a couple hours a week probably total now on glen
[09:32.160 --> 09:40.240]  back because he's he is a key operative place in our midst to stab us in the back and sell us
[09:40.240 --> 09:46.720]  out at key opportunities then that's a hundred percent it's a hundred percent i mean limbaugh
[09:46.720 --> 09:53.200]  is limbaugh and doesn't really change okay limbaugh was not for the banker bailout
[09:55.920 --> 09:59.200]  michael savage was not for it and they're not perfect by any stretch of them
[10:01.040 --> 10:08.080]  yardstick but with beck he is a total actor he admits that's what he is is an actor and it's
[10:08.080 --> 10:14.080]  all fake and everything is a lie or a deception i went ahead and watched a lot of his cpaq speech
[10:14.080 --> 10:21.040]  last night and you would see that and see a lot of things that are true in it but then tomorrow
[10:21.680 --> 10:24.800]  or the next day he'll say 180 degrees in the opposite direction
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.760]  that's the problem and this is a guy who's calling for a value added tax or sales tax on
[10:31.760 --> 10:35.600]  top of the income tax this is a guy calling for reauthorization of the patriot act this is a guy
[10:35.600 --> 10:40.800]  that said the homeland security mic reports demonizing conservatives and patriots he read
[10:40.800 --> 10:47.200]  over the list and said a lot of it was reasonable uh this is a guy who just everything's a deception
[10:47.200 --> 10:51.760]  i saw a clip this morning i only had time to watch about four minutes of it every clip i watched
[10:51.760 --> 10:57.040]  was pure evil and he was saying a few weeks ago oh look at all these old executive orders about
[10:57.040 --> 11:04.640]  taking over power and production and manufacturing and crops and roads and the states but he said
[11:04.640 --> 11:11.760]  the conspiracy theorists tell you this is going on now their liars this was all rescinded well yes
[11:11.760 --> 11:17.440]  back in the 10 000 series and then each subsequent president reissues their executive orders but on
[11:17.440 --> 11:22.560]  average more than 99 percent of the executive orders are kept they just issue them in the new
[11:22.560 --> 11:28.560]  series number everything in those executive orders he showed has been brought back in
[11:28.560 --> 11:40.480]  in by nixon and by ford and by jimmy carter and by reagan and by bush senior and by clinton
[11:41.040 --> 11:44.640]  and by bush w and by obama
[11:47.600 --> 11:51.360]  obama reissued pdd 51 and the accompanying executive order
[11:52.720 --> 11:58.160]  but they they what they do is they bundle all the executive orders of the last president
[11:58.160 --> 12:03.040]  because that's an act of that president sometimes they take one out or change something in it
[12:03.040 --> 12:07.840]  of hundreds and hundreds the president signed summer 500 some 600 some 200 but it's up in the
[12:07.840 --> 12:14.240]  13 mid 13 thousands now from 10 000 back under uh kennedy going all the way back to george
[12:14.240 --> 12:18.560]  washington with the first one they issued the first few were about the type of plates martha
[12:18.560 --> 12:23.280]  washington wanted money to buy to entertain dignitaries they're in new york at the at the
[12:23.280 --> 12:31.200]  at the residence of the president before it moved on after his death to uh dc near near his farm
[12:33.360 --> 12:37.520]  so all the way back to executive order number one which dealt with the type of horses they
[12:37.520 --> 12:41.920]  wanted to buy or the type of plates the type of lanterns i mean or what color to paint the
[12:41.920 --> 12:48.400]  residents that was all a president could issue with his budget given to him by congress he could decide
[12:48.400 --> 12:56.720]  under congressional review what type of ham to buy when the ambassador from france or england
[12:56.720 --> 13:02.080]  was visiting uh i mean it's incredible you can read about them buying teacups and martha washington
[13:02.080 --> 13:07.520]  complaining she had to buy cruddy ones because there was no money until you fast forward to
[13:07.520 --> 13:12.560]  obama saying i don't care if you don't pass the greenhouse gas taxes i'm just going to do it
[13:12.560 --> 13:15.920]  and he doesn't even need an executive order he said he'll just order the bureaucracy to do it
[13:15.920 --> 13:20.000]  and signing statements that he promised he wouldn't do and now he's expanding it and
[13:20.000 --> 13:27.440]  outstripping even bush and i've gone over all these executive orders i know their numbers
[13:27.440 --> 13:32.320]  we've written articles about them but he uses a little lawyer trick like that to say don't worry
[13:32.320 --> 13:36.400]  none of these executive orders are on the books nixon who was a good guy
[13:38.880 --> 13:45.600]  got rid of them complete and total lie nixon actually implemented those kennedy era executive
[13:45.600 --> 13:50.160]  orders under new executive order numbers you can go pull them up and that's how he put price controls
[13:50.160 --> 13:55.680]  in that's how he took us off the golden silver standard that's how he did all the things he
[13:55.680 --> 14:01.920]  did what are you talking about it's just everything is a deception with this guy he'll sit there and
[14:01.920 --> 14:06.720]  say the the truth for five minutes and then lies for another five minutes and then the next day
[14:06.720 --> 14:13.920]  it's like he'll have ron paul on and then attack him the next day he is duplicitous with rush limbaugh
[14:13.920 --> 14:19.200]  what's you hear one year is the same a year later when matt drudge was on the radio what you hear
[14:19.200 --> 14:23.600]  one year is the same the next year with michael savage what you hear one year is the same the
[14:23.600 --> 14:30.640]  next year no one is as sneaky and deceptive as this guy and and look folks i could go on for
[14:30.640 --> 14:36.000]  hours but all the stuff back does that's the problem and i am tempted to make a full-blown
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.960]  film about it but then i think no i've got to make a eugenics film i've got to make a kim trail
[14:40.960 --> 14:45.520]  film i've got to make i mean you know i've only got so much energy our films reach tens of millions
[14:45.520 --> 14:51.920]  of people each one conservatively i have a responsibility should i make a film about him
[14:51.920 --> 14:59.760]  because i can't just do this in a half-assed way as they say i've got to really do it if i do it i
[14:59.760 --> 15:06.080]  mean i can destroy this guy i seriously damage him just his own attack on deborah medina lost
[15:06.080 --> 15:13.120]  him 500 000 viewers two weeks in and he's now admitting he's had quite a backlash just stop it
[15:13.120 --> 15:19.600]  back stop it can't that you know they got rid of loo dobs at cnn he wasn't perfect for the drug
[15:19.600 --> 15:25.120]  war and a few other things i'm against but the guys for real and he was serious he was real he
[15:25.120 --> 15:33.440]  never changed it was he he he he he he he's real and all i want is somebody who's real so everybody
[15:33.440 --> 15:38.960]  loves ron paul he doesn't flip flop he doesn't waffle that's why he won the c-pack poll and fox
[15:38.960 --> 15:43.840]  news is attacking that saying it's unscientific now they always hail it as oh my gosh the most
[15:43.840 --> 15:48.880]  influential conservatives in the country thousands of them taking the straw poll ron paul heads above
[15:48.880 --> 15:53.440]  everybody else he's gotten one of the biggest percentages ever at c-pack and fox news today
[15:53.440 --> 15:58.000]  is saying none of this counts none of this is important none of this means anything in fact
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.800]  will you print me the raw story about that watson's got it linked up on prisonplanet.com but i
[16:02.800 --> 16:08.000]  didn't see it in my stacks that i aimed over to be printed thank you may have missed it
[16:10.560 --> 16:17.280]  headlines like fox news attacks c-pack poll or frauds it is credited the point is is that
[16:18.720 --> 16:23.680]  ron paul got a standing ovation last year at c-pack he's anti-war he gave an anti-war speech
[16:23.680 --> 16:27.520]  explaining how it's destroying america and bankrupting isn't he got a standing ovation
[16:27.520 --> 16:35.120]  it's an illusion that conservatives won all these wars it's an illusion liberals want it nobody
[16:35.120 --> 16:40.800]  wants it but maybe 20 of the population and i've talked to liquor store owners and and pizza place
[16:40.800 --> 16:46.240]  owners they say when a war starts that more liquor gets sold in the fourth of july christmas and
[16:46.240 --> 16:52.960]  new years rolled into one i mean it is you got people that have an extension of their manhood
[16:52.960 --> 16:59.040]  watching shock and awe and whole skylines being blown to bits and they get big bottles of jack
[16:59.040 --> 17:05.680]  daniels and pizza and they get drunk for a week laying back feeling manly it is ridiculous it's
[17:05.680 --> 17:11.600]  just like people that go to a football game and fill manly yelling for their team they're taking
[17:11.600 --> 17:16.560]  normal tribal energies you've got you want to yell and scream and fill manly fill manly about how
[17:16.560 --> 17:22.560]  we're destroying the global warming myth we're we're routing these people and that's another
[17:22.560 --> 17:25.680]  thing you know i don't have time to research all this i've just seen it over the years i've heard
[17:25.680 --> 17:31.280]  glen back over and over again on radio and tv say global warming's real i've heard sarah palin
[17:31.280 --> 17:36.800]  say it we've got to do something you know until until it came out four months ago the climate
[17:36.800 --> 17:40.880]  gate most of the fox news shows were saying they believed in it now they flip-flopped
[17:42.880 --> 17:47.760]  but don't believe me i mean this is just one that fell in my lap this morning that jaren sent me
[17:47.760 --> 17:52.960]  uh that he happened to catch that was curtain emil actually sent me this because i'm not even
[17:52.960 --> 17:57.840]  really looking at glenn beck stuff it's just like littered like a city park with dog droppings you
[17:57.840 --> 18:01.520]  know i'm not looking for the dog droppings but i can't walk to the park without getting it all

[18:40.480 --> 18:47.920]  but use the cfls he says of the compact fluorescent light bulbs i put them in once and couldn't

[24:08.320 --> 24:18.240]  and i'm getting into the huge banking news is that i'm watching glenn bag about 10 of the time out
[24:18.240 --> 24:25.360]  of one eye and it's so horrible and so obvious that this guy is a complete shill and a fraud
[24:25.360 --> 24:32.640]  from the establishment to try to suppress a true constitutionalist populist libertarian takeover
[24:32.640 --> 24:39.120]  of the republican party you read the republican party platform in texas and other states it sounds
[24:39.120 --> 24:43.760]  like alex jones wrote it get us out of the un get out of the new world order in the nafta
[24:44.560 --> 24:49.440]  gat scam erect fair tariffs against china and others that have tariffs against us
[24:50.560 --> 24:53.920]  on and on control our borders but it isn't implemented
[24:56.480 --> 25:00.640]  instead you see a tripling of government banker looting all of it police state
[25:00.640 --> 25:07.520]  8 remember it was bush that issued in april of 2008 through homeland security the mike report
[25:07.520 --> 25:13.680]  that got leaked once obama was in office we pointed it out day one it was bipartisan
[25:13.680 --> 25:17.760]  but all the big neocon sites and fox news and glenn beck that picked it up and made it their own
[25:17.760 --> 25:27.200]  story didn't tell you that now ron paul has won the coveted c pack straw poll if they always hail
[25:27.200 --> 25:32.400]  you know reagan won this back in what 79 and they said that said he's going to win he's who
[25:32.400 --> 25:39.040]  the conservatives want thousands of the most prestigious conservatives in the country all
[25:39.040 --> 25:45.120]  meet once a year and they said we want ron paul no one got even close in the straw poll he trounced
[25:45.120 --> 25:50.720]  met ronnie and see they know everything's perception it's like in texas oh i'm scratching
[25:50.720 --> 25:55.040]  her off my list beck said oh that's it ever madina can't have her doesn't matter if she
[25:55.040 --> 26:02.560]  said stuff even lighter on 9 11 than sarah paleon is darlin mrs global warming mrs john mccain supporter
[26:06.240 --> 26:09.600]  oh you can't vote for her now that'll be a wasted vote it's the perception
[26:09.600 --> 26:13.680]  see she had the perception going that she was going to win getting five points a week and they
[26:13.680 --> 26:22.080]  didn't destroy her with it but it slowed her down a bit and it's the same thing from fox news
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.720]  we've got the video clips we have time later to plan we will say no this isn't real oh it's
[26:26.720 --> 26:32.240]  unscientific you can't believe what happened at c pack no one wants ron paul he's not viable
[26:32.960 --> 26:38.080]  forget it uh for you know this is not what conservatives want they do not want to nullify
[26:38.080 --> 26:42.480]  the federal government at the state level uh they do not want lower taxes they do not want to get
[26:42.480 --> 26:46.960]  us out of these wars that are bankrupting us they do not want to repeal the patriot act
[26:46.960 --> 26:55.760]  they do not want to get rid of the naked body scanners no no no no no see they sent back
[26:55.760 --> 27:00.240]  and hanity and palan and others in to try to fully take control
[27:03.120 --> 27:08.320]  of the fact that republicans don't want to get fooled again they're finally waking up we've
[27:08.320 --> 27:14.160]  done our job you've done your job listeners we're going to keep on doing it we're gaining ground
[27:14.160 --> 27:17.920]  every day we're not just gaining ground on the liberals and the democrats and their
[27:17.920 --> 27:22.800]  hoaxes and their swine flu hoaxes and their naked body scanners and the carbon taxes we're
[27:22.800 --> 27:26.400]  gaining ground on the entire fraud that is big out of control government
[27:28.240 --> 27:33.760]  fox news scrambles a discredit c pack after ron paul wins presidential poll raw story updated
[27:33.760 --> 27:45.120]  bottom paul tells cnbc he's and it continues says he's leaning to be undecided i don't know what
[27:45.120 --> 27:51.040]  that means remember the big conservative conference fox news has been hyping over the past 10 days
[27:51.040 --> 27:56.400]  the conservative political action conferences presidential straw poll a key marker for the
[27:56.400 --> 28:02.000]  mood among conservative voters apparently didn't mean anything to the network as if it did mean
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.960]  something the only real result is bragging rights for the individual candidates who are so well
[28:06.960 --> 28:15.200]  exposed and they even dick cheney showed up again hey even dick cheney showed up no it's
[28:15.840 --> 28:25.840]  republican leaders more than 5000 of them more than 2000 voting in the straw poll and ron paul won
[28:25.840 --> 28:33.600]  by a giant margin dozens of people being voted for and he got 31
[28:33.600 --> 28:34.080]  percent
[28:38.240 --> 28:43.680]  mit romney 22 percent i've gone back and looked at previous straw polls at c pack that they say is
[28:43.680 --> 28:51.600]  so important and usually it's very close not this time 31 percent he had nine points over mit
[28:51.600 --> 29:02.640]  romney's 22 nine points above him and gaining and so even raw story the liberal publication
[29:02.640 --> 29:07.600]  establishment liberal publication is like it doesn't mean anything that's right ron paul's bad
[29:10.400 --> 29:15.600]  but then they go on to come back and say or at least that's how fox news characterized the poll
[29:15.600 --> 29:23.120]  after it was reported that congressman ron paul had won it by a wide margin
[29:23.680 --> 29:26.800]  we'll finish up with this and get into the top story today
[29:29.520 --> 29:36.960]  top story up at prisonplanet.com update city group says feds ordered seven day restriction

[37:08.800 --> 37:17.840]  after he leaves us i'm gonna get more into this and a bunch of other important news but
[37:17.840 --> 37:21.840]  fox news scrambles to discredit c pack after ron paul wins presidential poll
[37:27.440 --> 37:33.120]  c pack participants voted for ron paul is their favorite candidate by some 31 giving him the
[37:33.120 --> 37:38.080]  largest margin of victory in recent years former massachusetts government romney who has won the vote
[37:38.080 --> 37:42.960]  over the last three years was the runner-up with 22% former alaska governor sarah palin
[37:42.960 --> 37:51.520]  was third with 7% if you run her against barack obama he will win another turn now i've been
[37:51.520 --> 37:57.360]  saying that for six months now michael savage agrees anyone with any political understanding
[37:57.360 --> 38:04.960]  knows that that's why the neocons are pushing her because they own and run obama notice now
[38:04.960 --> 38:12.320]  they're trying to beef him up and huckabee had michelle obama on last night i mean this is sick
[38:15.200 --> 38:20.560]  over 10 000 people attended c pack this year among them 2395 voted in the straw poll
[38:24.960 --> 38:30.160]  it is way early it is unscientific setting fox news host even as the split screen showed
[38:30.160 --> 38:35.440]  glenn back on stage at the conference perhaps it offers nothing more than bragging rights uh though
[38:36.320 --> 38:41.680]  the course of this year but it is quite uh enthusiastic crowd what a difference a year
[38:41.680 --> 38:47.680]  makes that's a quote what a difference a year makes indeed paul himself said something quite
[38:47.680 --> 38:52.880]  similar a day prior when he spoke before the largest loudest audience of any other presenter
[38:52.880 --> 39:00.240]  he asked of the crowd remembered when he was a guy off in the corner predicting doom and none of
[39:00.240 --> 39:05.200]  the media paid him any serious money i remember 14 years ago or hardly anybody knew who ron paul
[39:05.200 --> 39:13.760]  was interviewing him multiple times each year i remember yes i do all the sudden the crash
[39:13.760 --> 39:19.200]  that i had been predicting all along it came said paul and now fox news tv has me on about
[39:19.200 --> 39:24.000]  60 times since the campaign was over on its website fox news said that the vote is not
[39:24.000 --> 39:28.800]  necessarily a good forecaster of conservatives leanings nationwide oh really of course they've
[39:28.800 --> 39:36.640]  already said it was key in the past and it goes on from there we could take this country back but
[39:36.640 --> 39:42.960]  don't just count on the federal level as ron paul has said and many others it's the states 30
[39:42.960 --> 39:51.440]  plus states almost 40 now are moving to pass laws nullifying unconstitutional federal jurisdiction
[39:51.440 --> 39:56.720]  i mean they use the commerce clause now commerce clause was to make states accept goods from other
[39:56.720 --> 40:05.200]  states that was it now they use it decide the light bulbs in your house the size of your toilet
[40:05.200 --> 40:17.760]  they use it for everything to totally run your life to have bureaucrats inside your office without
[40:17.760 --> 40:25.280]  warrants we have to take the states back at the state level at the county the city the state
[40:26.880 --> 40:30.640]  and we also have to get people elected to congress and it's going to happen
[40:30.640 --> 40:36.160]  and if it doesn't happen republicans will get back into the house in the next year they're
[40:36.160 --> 40:40.160]  probably about to win control of the house this year they'll get the senate the next year
[40:45.360 --> 40:50.320]  and they'll probably get the presidency if they don't run palan and then they will flip-flop
[40:50.320 --> 40:55.360]  stage more terror attacks bring in more government continue business as usual and then they'll all
[40:55.360 --> 40:59.200]  get flushed out we'll get democrats back in they'll continue the same operation no
[40:59.200 --> 41:07.040]  no remember uh rama manual 2006 admitted his main job was ensuring that anti-war democrats did
[41:07.040 --> 41:19.520]  not get elected was to make sure that anti-war democrats did not get elected just like the
[41:19.520 --> 41:28.800]  republicans are running three different fake tea party oid people against ron paul the democrats
[41:28.800 --> 41:36.240]  aren't even opposing ron paul the republicans are now that tells you who these people are
[41:37.200 --> 41:42.640]  that tells you what they're up to and what they're doing and what their game plan is
[41:47.600 --> 41:52.400]  and glenn beck and sir palan are the two key operatives right in the middle of it rushing
[41:52.400 --> 41:57.840]  to arizona to try to get mccain elected because if they kick out that anti-gun pro bailout republican
[41:57.840 --> 42:02.320]  that sends an even bigger message than brown in massachusetts so they want to make this just
[42:02.320 --> 42:08.800]  a route of democrats not a route of establishment republicans they send palan and everybody else
[42:08.800 --> 42:16.320]  down to texas to save rick perry they send republican money down to go after ron paul
[42:16.320 --> 42:23.760]  it's as plain as the nose on your face it's as plain as a trunk on an elephant's face
[42:23.760 --> 42:28.560]  it's as plain as stripes on a tiger
[42:31.360 --> 42:39.120]  or as spots on a leopard or as pink on a flamingo i don't know how some of you out there don't get
[42:39.120 --> 42:44.560]  it i get constant emails and people in person i used to think you were wrong about but now
[42:44.560 --> 42:50.480]  i'm starting to see it starting to see it he's in usa today on sunday saying global warming
[42:50.480 --> 42:55.840]  is real and we've all got to do something about it and then on another show he'll criticize it he's
[42:55.840 --> 43:08.240]  totally two-faced he has disdain for his audiences that's why i talk about it not because he makes
[43:08.240 --> 43:13.760]  30 million dollars a year not because he's stolen what i cover and what i do and twisted it and in
[43:13.760 --> 43:17.600]  a way will end up discrediting me down the road if i don't separate myself from him that you know
[43:17.600 --> 43:26.640]  that's a small part of it that last issue it isn't that he steals my information and twisted all
[43:27.840 --> 43:34.160]  and i have that from inside fox knows it's that he twisted so i get the blame and get compared
[43:34.160 --> 43:40.800]  to him and i'm all about integrity i'm all about being real that's what i value that's my true
[43:40.800 --> 43:47.520]  possession and i'm not going to let glenn beck take it from me or you he's meant to discredit you
[43:47.520 --> 43:53.760]  tea party america that's what he's there for he's meant to look like a clown and look abhorrent
[43:53.760 --> 44:01.600]  and stick his tongue out on the cover of time magazine to make all of you look silly he's designed
[44:01.600 --> 44:07.120]  scientifically to create a left right paradigm and then stab conservatives in the back of you i'm
[44:07.120 --> 44:13.600]  done i'm done i've just got to keep warning people it's like if there's a boat dock and i know there's
[44:13.600 --> 44:18.480]  a big submerged rock right out in the middle of the bay and boats keep running into it and sinking
[44:18.480 --> 44:25.360]  i'm going to go out there and put a big buoy on it to warn people that's what i do that's what i stand
[44:25.360 --> 44:31.200]  for just like i went out against obama day one we had an 84 percent approval rating and it was
[44:31.200 --> 44:39.440]  like the second coming of christ when neo cons were even leaving him alone when pat robertson was
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.320]  saying he is of the lord nothing can stop his socialism he will not be stopped i said that's
[44:44.320 --> 44:52.960]  a lie just like i told you bush was a fraud and clinton was a fraud these people are frauds
[44:54.000 --> 44:59.680]  and people will be listening to this in 10 years let me listen to it in 20 but you won't have to
[44:59.680 --> 45:04.240]  wait that long for everything i've said to be proven true it's already proven true in your face
[45:06.160 --> 45:06.480]  okay
[45:10.320 --> 45:16.320]  bob shatman has had a key source going back a year ago that us embassies were dumping their main
[45:16.320 --> 45:22.000]  reserves of dollars every big embassy has a huge vault full of cash in case a war breaks out they
[45:22.000 --> 45:32.240]  get locked down they've got gold and other things and weapons a year ago right around a year ago
[45:32.240 --> 45:36.800]  i guess 11 months ago they began dumping most of their dollars and buying local currencies
[45:37.760 --> 45:43.520]  and an index of regional currencies the euro and other things later it came out in the news that
[45:43.520 --> 45:52.240]  was confirmed the euros going down but that also pulls the dollar down the g20 in a concerted effort
[45:52.240 --> 45:58.080]  is devaluing currencies worldwide together gordon brown gave a speech last friday we're
[45:58.080 --> 46:02.560]  going to play it later in the show where he admitted world government is here new world order
[46:02.560 --> 46:07.760]  we're using the financial crisis to bring in our world government we've got to have a global
[46:07.760 --> 46:13.600]  constitution of the banks to establish a world government they're right out in the open and
[46:13.600 --> 46:20.880]  remember two weeks ago this headline of the news of australia secret summit of top bankers in
[46:20.880 --> 46:27.440]  australia 24 central banks and monetary authorities including us federal reserve european central
[46:27.440 --> 46:32.720]  bank landed and sitting to meet tomorrow at a secret location the herald sun reports a secret
[46:32.720 --> 46:37.680]  location they have lots of bilderberg ask type meetings it's the same players bilderberg's is
[46:37.680 --> 46:42.880]  one of these secret meetings so it's a kind of a label on it the media tries to discredit us and go
[46:42.880 --> 46:48.240]  is it cfr is it trilateral commission is it bilderberg is it royal institute of international
[46:48.240 --> 46:54.400]  affairs who is it is it club of rome all the heads of those groups are members of bilderberg
[46:54.400 --> 47:00.960]  and each group manages different sectors i mean what do you call this secret meeting
[47:00.960 --> 47:09.360]  the point is they had it to set their policy for the g20 coming up next month in canada notice
[47:09.360 --> 47:13.760]  they're not having g20 meetings once a year now they're having to remember three months now and
[47:13.760 --> 47:19.200]  they're having secret ones every week because they are wrangling and hammering out the global
[47:19.840 --> 47:24.880]  constitution that the central banks that have hijacked and run our countries are just going
[47:24.880 --> 47:28.800]  to sign they don't even need us to go along with it it's like gordon brown said two and a half months
[47:28.800 --> 47:34.240]  ago he said it doesn't matter if copenhagen just failed we're just going to have the central banks
[47:34.240 --> 47:39.360]  letting the taxes in the western world and pay it to themselves and that's what he said last friday
[47:45.200 --> 47:50.320]  illegal lawless world government and they're going to implement as gordon brown and obama
[47:50.320 --> 47:57.760]  have said via the bureaucracies if the house of commons won't pass it so what if the congress won't
[47:57.760 --> 48:02.560]  pass the carbon taxes and home inspections and regulations and hellish control that'll shut
[48:02.560 --> 48:08.000]  down industry by design in their own words that's their goal where only the industry they own in
[48:08.000 --> 48:14.400]  china and india will still be operating completing their monopoly so be it you don't want banks running
[48:14.400 --> 48:24.720]  your life so what now all of that said it is not just city group we've confirmed wells fargo is
[48:24.720 --> 48:32.720]  doing this the feds have told every major bank this and they told them in december of last year

[55:26.480 --> 55:32.560]  morning over the weekend i saw the articles out there went and checked it into it and noticed
[55:32.560 --> 55:38.960]  that yes it was true and not just that i found other major banks sending their customers notices
[55:38.960 --> 55:44.240]  that they may hold their money for seven days and that's not just when you come into positive
[55:44.240 --> 55:50.720]  check they wait seven days that's your savings they may keep it they're also saying as of
[55:50.720 --> 55:55.760]  a month and a half two months ago that oh your money market you know i've got some savings savings
[55:55.760 --> 56:03.200]  for the business savings for my children in the bank and i don't put at the stock market and
[56:03.200 --> 56:10.320]  they supposedly risky i keep some of it fluid in a money market you get like three percent
[56:10.320 --> 56:14.720]  maybe four percent depending on which one i have i have several that's nothing it doesn't
[56:14.720 --> 56:21.520]  even keep up with inflation and they're saying no no we may just take that it's not insured

[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:09.360]  go and deposit their checks at wells fargo you name it they make them wait seven days to get their
[1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:15.440]  money the point is they're using your money and a lot of people say well the federal reserve
[1:01:15.440 --> 1:01:20.640]  could just print more money even though the fdic is running out of money and just give them more
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:27.200]  they're already monetizing our debts so that's true but they may shut down supplying people
[1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:32.800]  with money because they want to cause rioting the point is why did the feds put this regulation in
[1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:40.240]  that was adopted january first and secondarily no this news report is real prisonplanet.com
[1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:46.880]  article has a link to the city group website city group says feds ordered seven day restrictions

[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:41.360]  ah yes meeting and secret meanwhile they have a organized concerted global devaluation of currencies
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:48.960]  it was in november of last year that dr paul craig roberts former wall street journal editor
[1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:57.520]  had a policy the treasury father reaganomics said look for the euro to go down look for the
[1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:02.480]  reverse carry trade to come back into the u.s. early next year and to boost the dollar for a time
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:07.600]  but then it'll pull down all currencies well that actually happened i guess he's a pretty smart guy
[1:03:07.600 --> 1:03:11.760]  that's why he's been listed by many publications like forbes is one of the top 10 economists in
[1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:17.600]  the world he'll be talking to us again coming up after this break but it's a black hole it's

[1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:23.120]  michael moore's film capitalism is already online i haven't seen it but i've talked to jason

[1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:41.760]  by design we have the head climatologist at nasa writing a book saying they want to destroy the
[1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:47.760]  industrial economy uh... to save the environment we have bill gates talking about this we have
[1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:52.800]  morris strong at the u n i'm gonna talk about that in the next hour but joining us for the next
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:59.520]  fifty one minutes the author of how the economy was lost the war of the world's paul craig roberts
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:07.040]  and he joins us via video uh... connection from his home and this book is uh... just now
[1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:12.560]  hitting store shelves or here in the near future will get the actual uh... details from
[1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:18.320]  dr roberts i just got this in the mail friday just had a chance to scan over it today excellent
[1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:22.800]  uh... book from this uh... multi-time bestselling author course he was an editor at wall street
[1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:27.280]  journal the father reaganomics had a policy under ronald reagan at the department of treasury
[1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:31.840]  and he's a real conservative who's spoken out against the neo cons and this whole system
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:38.240]  and it's great to have him joining us sir thanks for coming on please be with you alex well so much
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:44.000]  is happening and before i start throwing out questions uh... what is most important on your
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:49.920]  radar today sir well the book well let's talk about the book
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:57.520]  well that's a good idea alex because uh... what what i'm able to do in this book and
[1:09:57.520 --> 1:10:04.640]  just common sense terms it's easy to read very short chapters is to explain to people
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:08.720]  how their economic uh... future has been destroyed
[1:10:08.720 --> 1:10:16.320]  uh... there are many villains uh... but the biggest one is the offshoring of the jobs
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:22.960]  because when you all show the jobs you all show the incomes and when you all show the incomes
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:29.120]  you all show the gross domestic product and so what all sharing does is it makes us
[1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:34.080]  poorer it's a process of becoming less developed
[1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:41.040]  and it destroys uh... career opportunities it destroys a lattice of upward mobility
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:47.440]  and it makes recovery from recessions impossible because there's nothing left to recover
[1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:54.320]  well sir you're not a sick person you tried to cut taxes for america one of the biggest
[1:10:54.320 --> 1:10:58.800]  growth rates we ever had in the last century if i'm correct the second fastest growth rate
[1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:04.320]  uh... in the twentieth century correct me if i'm wrong because you want people to do well you
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:09.120]  want to empower the free market uh... and so you talking to you in the past it seems you you have
[1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:13.520]  somewhat of a blind spot or correct me if i'm wrong towards believing that the system would
[1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:19.280]  want to destroy and consolidate power to create monopolies but i have all the globalist own
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:25.840]  statements that this is what they want but regardless this is the end uh... scenario
[1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:31.440]  the uh... this is what globalization and offshoring has delivered to us is
[1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:34.960]  deindustrialization lowering standard of livings across the west
[1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:42.880]  that's exactly correct whether it's a uh... intentional plan or whether it's the result of
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:50.080]  uh... incompetence and incentives uh... angry it doesn't much matter because the effect on the
[1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:58.640]  people is the same and uh... and until they uh... have a grasp of it they can't react no matter
[1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:05.520]  what the cause is well let's specifically talk about the disease and what's happened with nafta
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:13.520]  and gat and the rest of it uh... versus the cure because you cover the disease and the cure in your
[1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:25.200]  book well and as i said alex and as you know there there are many uh... adverse happenings
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:31.920]  and the book mentions a number of them but its main focus is on the offshoring of the jobs
[1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:43.360]  and this came about uh... largely in my view because of the incentive structure
[1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:52.400]  uh... wall street uh... pressured corporations to increase the shareholder return that is to be
[1:12:52.400 --> 1:13:00.400]  more profitable produce more capital gains uh... the government passed a law that uh...
[1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:07.040]  you can let a company could not deduct uh... executive pay in excess of one million dollars
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:14.800]  uh... you know as a business expense unless it was performance related and an earlier reform
[1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:21.680]  which requires a quarterly reporting uh... the unintended result of that was to focus
[1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:30.080]  companies and the top executives own very short run profits so you had that kind of
[1:13:30.080 --> 1:13:36.320]  incentive system now what kept it from going wrong for a long time was it wasn't really possible
[1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:42.720]  to all show the jobs because it was no high-speed internet and so you couldn't have intellectual
[1:13:42.720 --> 1:13:49.600]  work skill professional work like engineering uh... done all sure and and sent in and the
[1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:55.840]  work in the world was still uh... socialist you couldn't uh... open uh... factories and uh...
[1:13:55.840 --> 1:14:02.400]  communist china and hire their labor for example and so the collapse of world socialism the rise
[1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:08.720]  of the high-speed internet created a totally new economic environment in which the incentives
[1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:15.600]  that already existed the cap on the cap on executive pay the pressure from wall street on the firms
[1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:23.440]  the result was that firms started closing plant equipment in the united states or if they built
[1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:30.160]  new plant equipment move it and make a little broad and they greatly increased the profits
[1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:38.080]  and their own remuneration by substituting very cheap foreign labor for american labor
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:44.320]  and this has now gone on long enough that many american firms that we once knew is manufacturing
[1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:51.120]  firms they're really just marketing firms selling an american brand name that's made
[1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:56.720]  all sure and so by moving all these jobs and facilities offshore
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:03.840]  they have reduced the opportunities for americans increase them for foreigners and when the goods
[1:15:03.840 --> 1:15:11.760]  come back in they count as imports and are responsible for a good percentage of our very
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:19.440]  large trade deficit which in turn has to be financed by giving over the ownership of the
[1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:27.520]  existing american assets existing companies real estate even toll roads foreigners now even on a
[1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:35.680]  99-year lease is on the toll roads in virginia in illinois and in other states and so when when
[1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:44.000]  they then end up as owners of the tolls the capital gains the dividends the rents the interest that
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:51.360]  were formerly going into american coffers they now go abroad too so this work this worsens the
[1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:58.240]  current account deficit which is the next step up from the trade deficit so it's put the united
[1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:07.600]  states in a situation where it is now a massive debtor it has massive debts to service and yet
[1:16:07.600 --> 1:16:18.000]  it has massive deficits both domestic budget deficits and trade deficits that make it increasingly
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:27.200]  impossible to to service so that is a is a dilemma is how do you bring an economy back
[1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:37.440]  that's in that situation well how do you do that well to the extent that
[1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:45.360]  it could be done i think there are two things that you have to do first you have to protect
[1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:51.680]  the dollar's reserve currency roll because if we lose that we can't pay for our our import bill
[1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:58.560]  we can't we simply can't pay for the imports so they would they would have to do something
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:08.560]  to bring the jobs back now historically you could have relied on high tariffs on goods made
[1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:15.120]  offshore but we now have so many trade agreements that we would have to wiggle out of that that
[1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:22.080]  might not be possible but what you could do is change the way you tax corporations instead
[1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:29.280]  of having an income tax you could tax them according to where the value is added to their
[1:17:29.280 --> 1:17:37.360]  product in other words if um there were a wide production if the value is added mainly in the
[1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:43.440]  united states then they'll have a low tax rate but if it was added abroad china for example
[1:17:43.440 --> 1:17:51.200]  they would have a high tax rate and so you could use taxation then to offset the advantage of the
[1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:59.680]  very low cost foreign labor if you did that you could you would then be showing the world hey look
[1:17:59.680 --> 1:18:05.040]  they're going to get the trade deficit under control they're going to again have an economy that
[1:18:05.040 --> 1:18:10.800]  makes things and creates high paid jobs and and restores a middle class so that would be
[1:18:11.840 --> 1:18:17.600]  one thing that could be done at least conceptually now of course the large global corporations
[1:18:17.600 --> 1:18:23.040]  would fight it and they would they don't want that and they want the profits that they get from
[1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:29.440]  the cheap foreign labor so whether or not the the government or the people could prevail over these
[1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:34.880]  powerful moneyed interests we'd have to doubt very much but conceptually that would be something
[1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:41.920]  that could be done now on the budget deficit front you know the budget deficit now is horrendous the
[1:18:41.920 --> 1:18:50.880]  world has never seen deficits to be financed to this magnitude the deficits exceed the the trade
[1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:57.440]  purposes of our trading partners which is what has been financing the budget deficit in fact i
[1:18:57.440 --> 1:19:06.640]  think they exceed the world savings so what could you do well you could certainly stop the wars
[1:19:06.640 --> 1:19:11.840]  the wars don't serve any interest of the american people they're extremely expensive
[1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:17.760]  they would have to cut and they're not only have to stop the wars they would have to cut
[1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:24.560]  the defense budget they'd have to close those 700 or more foreign bases they would have to
[1:19:24.560 --> 1:19:32.640]  give up this goal of world hedging hedging enemy the empire we can't afford it there's no money
[1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:37.760]  for all right uh dr paul craig roberts we've got a break we come back let's continue with what has
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:43.520]  to be cut now the majority of democrats are against all the empires and all the bases that come with
[1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:49.680]  that empire ron paul just won the big c-pack straw poll of conservatives by one of the biggest
[1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:56.480]  margins ever frouncing mit romney by nine points but the establishment that controls the liberals
[1:19:56.480 --> 1:20:01.280]  and conservatives doesn't want that so the question is can we take our country back and shut down the
[1:20:01.280 --> 1:20:06.800]  empire in time we all know that the burki water purification systems are the most trusted name

[1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:39.280]  i think it must be almost now available from amazon i don't know how they intend to market it
[1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:45.680]  whether they are going to put it in the bookstores or whether simply and market it through online
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:53.040]  sellers like amazon but it is available now from from counterpunches book site and i think the
[1:24:53.040 --> 1:25:00.560]  availability date for for amazon is march first but it may already be available okay so folks are
[1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:06.720]  folks are really hearing about it here first then and again you've had several best sellers
[1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:11.360]  previously through giant publishers and of course the folks over at counterpunch are great the book
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:16.800]  is very is excellent read and also looks great why'd you go with counterpunch to get it out quickly
[1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:28.400]  well actually was there idea and alex coven approached me and he's and so i had an easy time
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:32.880]  of it so well we're glad you got it out so quickly okay this is a short segment we'll
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:36.000]  continue to get into solutions and more of what's currently happening in the world in the next
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:40.480]  segment but going into break i brought up ron paul winning c pack by one of the biggest margins
[1:25:40.480 --> 1:25:48.000]  ever similar margins that ronald reagan got there in 1979 and then again in 1980 at c pack for those
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:53.040]  that don't know the you know very important republican national meeting of a key leadership that they
[1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:59.600]  have as as well as grassroots conservatives ron paul whose anti-imperial war i mean this
[1:25:59.600 --> 1:26:06.000]  sends a strong message to fox news and the neocons and glenn beck who are beating the war drums
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:10.960]  for iran you talk about solutions we're gonna get more into those but instead of going with
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:16.720]  tried and true solutions that you're discussing they want more wars more taxes more regulations
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:22.400]  glenn beck wants a value added and sales tax on top of the income tax they know kennedy cut
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:29.440]  taxes by 50 the tax rolls doubled so why do they want more taxes i mean they're not complete idiots
[1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:35.760]  and and obama wants all these new taxes and all the greenhouse gas taxes he says he's going to have
[1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:42.160]  the government implement through the epa regardless of the senate not passing his bill so they're
[1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:48.960]  obviously doing things that will accelerate the destruction of our faltering economy that's exactly
[1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:55.520]  right they're going to drive the american people into the ground except for you know one percent
[1:26:55.520 --> 1:27:03.360]  or even less half of one percent of the population is super rich on wall street that's exactly
[1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:09.520]  what they're going to do and the reason they want this this global warming stuff is cap and trade
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:17.680]  is because it creates a new product a new instrument that can be sold traded that is the
[1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:24.480]  right to pollute and wall street of course will create derivatives based on their on the right
[1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:30.800]  to pollute and that's really what the whole environmental scare is all about there's a lot
[1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:35.920]  of course sincere people who are concerned about the environment but but it's the money
[1:27:35.920 --> 1:27:43.200]  that interests who are funding it and who are behind it and they're creating a a new property
[1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:49.440]  right the right to pollute that will be very valuable that will be sold and that they can create
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:57.120]  financial instruments such as derivatives on the basis of so the whole thing is a hoax it's really
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:05.040]  a hoax it's another it's it's like the subprime derivatives and it's for the enrichment of the
[1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:12.560]  of the investment banks it's golden sacks for example so we have a country whose economic policy
[1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:20.480]  serves no one but the war industries and the investment banks and everyone else is being
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:26.160]  driven into the ground even the big industrial concerns look at general motors look at our
[1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:32.720]  automobile industry you know it these are the epitome of capitalism is driven into the ground
[1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:41.360]  so what we have is linens financial capitalism where the banks control everything and rip
[1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:48.480]  everybody off and that's the type of economy that has evolved here and that's what we're living in
[1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:56.640]  today so there's really no indicator of the establishment reversing course in fact i've
[1:28:56.640 --> 1:29:03.520]  seen many articles in the wall street journal new york times with the big bank heads celebrating
[1:29:03.520 --> 1:29:09.440]  their expanded power out of the crisis that they authored well see they got away with it
[1:29:09.440 --> 1:29:14.640]  and they blocked all the efforts to bring back regulation which would have protected the people
[1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:22.720]  against the crisis and now you see what it what the goldman sacks had hank paulson the former
[1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:30.400]  treasury secretary what he is doing now is he's out leaving a campaign to pay for the bailout of
[1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:37.440]  the banks by taking away people's social security and medicare coverage let's talk about that after
[1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:45.600]  the quick break let's get into the expanded looting of the already tiny savings of this

[1:34:54.800 --> 1:35:00.400]  roberts you got cut off by the break you were talking about how the economy's falling apart
[1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:04.960]  they know this they're squeezing the public i saw an article you wrote about we're now a police
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:08.880]  state we should probably get back into that clearly they've made the decision and i have an
[1:35:09.440 --> 1:35:13.440]  city bank document to cover the next hour after you leave us where they've made the decision to
[1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:19.600]  make us poppers as a tool of control and to uh... enrich themselves so
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:22.480]  uh... they're not adopting your solutions and we're going over more of those
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:26.640]  how then dr paul craig roberts do you see this unfolding
[1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:32.160]  three and a half months ago you predicted that the euro would go down first the dollar would go up
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:37.040]  when the carry trade reversed you explained that but then it would also start sucking the dollar
[1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:43.840]  down next that's now happening gold's going back up really fast uh... so look into your economic
[1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:50.640]  crystal ball of you can and try to give us an idea of where this is going well alex and
[1:35:51.440 --> 1:35:59.760]  i think the one check if there is a check on this uh... unaccountable government power
[1:35:59.760 --> 1:36:07.920]  that we are faced with it's trying to roll us up the one check on them is how long the dollar will
[1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:17.280]  last and if it doesn't last long enough that is it loses its acceptability as the world currency
[1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:26.240]  they won't be able to pay for their empire and so the whole thing could come to a screeching
[1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:34.160]  halt from dollar failure and it's also possible that some of the other countries in the world who
[1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:42.000]  are not willing pieces of the new world order who who do not
[1:36:43.280 --> 1:36:48.880]  participate in the construction of uh... of the u.s. empire china for example
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:57.200]  uh... they also holds tremendous amounts of treasury bonds and in a way this gives them a
[1:36:57.200 --> 1:37:05.280]  weapon over us so how far they can be pushed uh... at what point do they realize that uh...
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:14.880]  they're in the gun sites too and then take some sort of action on their own that would help to
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:23.760]  derail the unaccountable american government both here at home and abroad now what are the
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:32.560]  what's the american government doing as far as i can tell the plan is to uh... him in russia
[1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:40.560]  with anti-ballistic missile systems on its border to turn uh... former constituent parts of the
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:48.000]  russian empire into the american empire with american military bases and in this way try to
[1:37:48.720 --> 1:37:56.160]  negate russia's military potential their their nuclear deterrent and and
[1:37:57.040 --> 1:38:05.840]  shove them out of the way in this way and so that is one of the of washington's greatest goals
[1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:13.680]  the next is to build up the war against iran they want to attack iran it's the last
[1:38:13.680 --> 1:38:20.080]  remaining independent country in middle east and once they have complete control over the middle
[1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:29.680]  east uh... that's how they then deal with china exactly as in the 20th century the united states
[1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:39.920]  dealt with japan cut them off from oil so that is what the strategic plan in washington is and
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:47.520]  that's the plan whether or not president obama knows it or is even uh... a willing or knowing
[1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:55.040]  participants but that's the plan it's what they're after too all right let's let's walk through those
[1:38:55.040 --> 1:39:00.560]  uh... different pieces you just laid out uh... course back on eight eight eight you and others
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:06.480]  in 2008 were pointing out this was a provocation to start war with russia and now a white house
[1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:13.840]  insider in the raw story article uh... is upon uh... the tv screen right now uh... the book a
[1:39:13.840 --> 1:39:20.960]  little war that shook the world white house insider that shaney wanted to go ahead and go to war uh...
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:29.040]  with russia with that provocation having the georgian u.s. nato israeli back forces
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:36.080]  go in and sneak attack them in the shows a level of just brazen really insanity hit larry and type
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:41.440]  desire for power uh... that he was willing to go ahead with and now china is seeing that
[1:39:41.440 --> 1:39:46.320]  but it's continuing under obama and the pl a as you know said we want to start dumping treasury
[1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:53.440]  bonds kill the dollar and so china now is considering all of this is a threat is realizing it so it
[1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:58.720]  seems that things are really heating up with hillary threatening sanctions on china if they don't go
[1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:04.080]  along with quote crippling sanctions on iran so it does appear the pieces are being moved into place
[1:40:04.080 --> 1:40:10.160]  we have gates still at the uh... pentagon that it seems as if it's business as usual with left
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:17.040]  cover with obama and that they really are at least considering world war three i yes i think
[1:40:17.040 --> 1:40:25.920]  that's the intention uh... this is uh... insanely risky because it means uh... the use of nuclear
[1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:33.680]  weapons and course uh... we won't escape that uh... and uh... there's no missile defense against
[1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:40.880]  the russian i cbm's that became can uh... work completely in fact uh... what the russians will
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:46.960]  do they'll use cruise missiles to take out all those missile defenses and then launch
[1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:54.720]  so it's it it shows a form of insanity look for years the new conservatives have wanted to go
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:41:01.280]  to war with russia back years ago when i was on the committee for the present danger which was
[1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:07.840]  a group of uh... former high government officials who were concerned about the soviet union and
[1:41:07.840 --> 1:41:12.240]  they wanted to be sure that uh... it didn't uh... get an upper hand
[1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:18.560]  some members tried to bring neoconservatives on the committee and the rest of them black
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:24.160]  balled them and said no we don't want to go to war with russia we just don't want to become
[1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:32.880]  uh... vulnerable and during the reagan administration uh reagan had to say over and over uh no i don't
[1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:38.640]  want to win the cold war i want to end it and the neoconservatives would get matter and matter
[1:41:38.640 --> 1:41:45.360]  because they wanted to win it and so they've been dying for a nuclear war with russia if you read
[1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:53.520]  their their statements their their articles their programs uh they have no fear of a nuclear war and
[1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:59.120]  we you can remember that even the ones have not been in the government like billy crystal
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:04.880]  editor of the weekly standard i mean he says things like well what's the good of nuclear weapons if
[1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:13.440]  you can't use them and let's talk about that his father was the head air of trotsky and that's been
[1:42:13.440 --> 1:42:18.160]  in the washington post that this was a group of communists who always hated stalin because he
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:23.440]  kicked him out they came to mexico city and then infiltrated i mean this is truly a second
[1:42:23.440 --> 1:42:29.360]  beginning group leading conservatism and it's a big rebuke of them that ron paul won the c-pack
[1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:35.680]  poll that's the that that's a mysterious thing to me and i don't keep up with c-pack but i can
[1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:42.960]  remember years ago but and you tell me if i'm right but i think uh the c-pack people were in the
[1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:50.080]  neocons clutches one thing one day all four absolutely and and now all of a sense of what
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:57.760]  that seems to show is that uh some of the people have woken up have caught on and things look
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:04.800]  less hopeless if people wake up and catch on which is one of the reasons i so much admire
[1:43:04.800 --> 1:43:10.320]  you you do a better job of informing people than them than the mainstream media does
[1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:17.280]  and and so if people catch on it is that is another constraint and if and if the catching
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:22.720]  on is growing then the constraint on on the government grows that doesn't mean they won't try
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:31.360]  to roll over everybody but it may not be an easy thing to do it's a large country
[1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:36.880]  and what's happening because of the of the economy they're killing the economy in fact
[1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:43.360]  they've been killing it for 10 years you know look alex at the beginning of this century
[1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:52.560]  first years of this new decade in the 21st century senator schumer the new york democrat
[1:43:52.560 --> 1:44:00.160]  and i we opened the new year with an article in the new york times pointing out that all
[1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:06.560]  shoring was chilling the economy and it caused a sensation because here was a reaganite and a
[1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:14.800]  left-wing democrat challenging what everybody thought was free trade and and so immediately
[1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:21.680]  the brookings institution held a conference in washington and invited all the big shots
[1:44:21.680 --> 1:44:29.120]  and c span came and televised it and showed it over and over and where we made the case
[1:44:29.120 --> 1:44:35.680]  that all shoring would completely destroy the economy and the job prospects of americans and
[1:44:35.680 --> 1:44:40.560]  it wouldn't just be the blue collar workers it would be the university graduates it would be
[1:44:40.560 --> 1:44:49.680]  essentially everybody and in doing this conference i predicted that in 20 years the united states
[1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:56.800]  would be a third world country if this continued and it's continued and we are we now have
[1:44:56.800 --> 1:45:04.640]  increasing attributes of a third world country the only jobs available are domestic services
[1:45:04.640 --> 1:45:10.080]  and now that's contracting a lot of the economic numbers i see say that unemployment's really over
[1:45:10.080 --> 1:45:15.120]  20 percent from dr roberts looking at the numbers yourself is that accurate that we see out a lot
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:21.360]  of these uh big financial analyst groups they're saying 20 to 22 percent if if you measure the
[1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:29.280]  unemployment rate the way was measured 1980 is currently 22 percent yes and the the 10 figure
[1:45:29.280 --> 1:45:34.800]  is is a headline number the government itself knows it's no good and the government's real number
[1:45:34.800 --> 1:45:40.480]  is about 17 percent well let me give you an example i'm in austin texas rated as the best
[1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:46.480]  city in the country in this now endless recession and i try to go to restaurants i went to in the
[1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:51.520]  past closed many of the shopping malls and strip centers half the shops are closed or starting
[1:45:51.520 --> 1:45:58.000]  to close my audience has tripled the last two years more than tripled but the same amount of
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:03.360]  money's coming in from video book sales advertising that was coming in three years ago and i've
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:09.200]  talked to everybody else in radio tv everything it's the same the economy is well we've seen the
[1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:15.600]  numbers uh texas has the highest drop uh in sales taxes that it's ever had in its history
[1:46:15.600 --> 1:46:21.840]  the same for 41 states i saw a business journal article last week i mean every indicator is
[1:46:21.840 --> 1:46:29.200]  things are falling apart and the government's only passing more taxes and then meanwhile 800
[1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:33.520]  plus cities are sanctuary cities where illegal aliens are above the law and don't get arrested
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:41.520]  for dwi or assault and there's more illegals coming in bankrupting the the the welfare roles
[1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:46.560]  i mean this is in i don't think it's going to take another 10 years for us to be a third world
[1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:53.680]  country i'd say if this continues what three four years doctor well that's there's a lot of stored
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:47:00.880]  wealth it would last a while but you you're on to a good point let's talk for a minute about
[1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:10.320]  what a decline economy does to the people to marriage to uh the uh self-esteem of of
[1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:19.440]  unemployed men what it does to the social fabric now that unemployment rate 22 it masks a lot of
[1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:25.920]  things that are much worse for example the unemployment rate of white males say 24 to 35
[1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:35.600]  you know in the in the career forming years it's higher than 22 the the unemployment rate of
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:44.400]  inner-city blacks is horrendous it's more like you know 67 percent what you see is the
[1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:52.240]  is the not just the destruction of the economy but the destruction of the society of social
[1:47:52.240 --> 1:48:04.560]  cohesion and you're seeing the the destruction of the poorer classes of whites which is now
[1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:13.040]  they're they're now living the life like inner-city blacks and so what the whole country is coming
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:20.640]  apart at the seams let me ask you a question i've seen the number of 22 percent and you're
[1:48:20.640 --> 1:48:26.560]  confirming that unemployment and that if you add in the underemployed it's close to 40 percent total
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:32.080]  that are unemployed are underemployed meaning people can't make ends meet they're not lazy
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:37.040]  they're working two three jobs and then i get these wall street guys on like damon vickers and he
[1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:43.680]  just says well that's because a lot of people are just lazy no people aren't lazy that's exactly right
[1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:52.960]  there aren't any jobs there aren't any jobs and you see as i say in the book to recover you have to
[1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:58.640]  have an economy but we don't we gave it away for what they call the new economy which was a hoax
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:07.840]  there isn't any new economy and and and so nothing is done in washington to get the economy back
[1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:17.360]  and they're continuing to give it away and this is why i think they that they will not
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:25.200]  succeed in their world aims because the economy will collapse out from underem the dollar will
[1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:31.760]  collapse out from underem and i couldn't predict what the consequences of that type of disaster
[1:49:31.760 --> 1:49:39.600]  would be but it would be horrendous and so i don't believe that they can just march right ahead and
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:49.520]  achieve uh the aims that we've identified i think they'll run into uh the lack of resources well
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:55.920]  doctor let me throw a few wall cards in it's official microsoft time newsweek new york times
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:00.800]  they're all calling to censor the web make you have a web id to get on the pentagon is taking
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:06.320]  over all the internet grids uh they admit in the cyber security bill it is to take over the web
[1:50:06.320 --> 1:50:12.240]  it says the new job hiring the new bubble in internet will be government hiring high school
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:18.480]  and college kids to serve in this we're now being censored uh more and more so they're moving to block
[1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:23.600]  us talking about the raping that we're all going under right now and i also believe they're gonna
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:29.360]  play the stage terror card we we know that christmas underwear thing was staged can you comment well
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:34.480]  we're gonna go to break i want to come back and have you comment on that because i know that they've
[1:50:34.480 --> 1:50:38.480]  designed this and they believe whether they're right or not they're gonna get away without
[1:50:38.480 --> 1:50:45.680]  starting new wars uh staging terror attacks curtailing the internet so we'll talk about that

[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:39.120]  but he's going to show up and play the part of a victim now they say they're going to have a
[1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:44.240]  press conference they don't say when but it looks like it's going to be in the next two hours we need

[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:15.280]  when you were the head of policy at treasury i'd always read that if you had any tax trouble you
[1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:20.480]  couldn't even be employed as a clerk at the treasury involved with the irs and now geithner
[1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:27.520]  just you know says taxes i don't need to pay any stinking taxes right yeah this it's an amazing
[1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:35.120]  deterioration um and you know the united states has never been perfect at any stage but just looking
[1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:42.640]  at the decline in public character and integrity and in the very short time since ronald reagan to
[1:55:42.640 --> 1:55:50.080]  now it's frightening it's like a totally different country a totally different government there's no
[1:55:50.080 --> 1:55:58.400]  standards they let goldman sacks come in goldman sacks has run the treasury since clinton they run
[1:55:58.400 --> 1:56:05.920]  the fed this is an extraordinary thing nobody there's no accountability well i've got a bunch
[1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:11.120]  of quick questions for you on that subject i noticed that spain's investigating Reuters reported
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:17.760]  and now a goldman sacks minion is now taking over uh the default and the control of the uh
[1:56:18.640 --> 1:56:24.240]  of greece's economy and we know from big pieces that have been written in the us that goldman sacks
[1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:28.000]  bet against the housing market while telling people to invest in it and bragged about how it
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.720]  would knock off their competition that was in the clatchy newspapers we had the reporter on
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:38.160]  i mean these guys really are the villains here uh can you speak to what's happening with the pigs
[1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:45.200]  as they're called uh in europe right now well these are these are the most financially weak
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:52.720]  countries that were brought into the european union into the euro uh mainly through a you know a
[1:56:52.720 --> 1:56:59.520]  mad determination of the eu bureaucrats to expand the thing everywhere so they end up a lot of
[1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:08.880]  financially weak countries whose public indebtedness uh exceeds all the uh regulations that are
[1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:16.480]  supposed to govern their financial activities and since these countries now use the common currency
[1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:23.600]  that they cannot themselves print they can no longer print the money to pay off their bonds and so
[1:57:23.600 --> 1:57:32.160]  when their bonds get in trouble uh they they can't they can't protect themselves and they're relying
[1:57:32.160 --> 1:57:39.360]  on the richer countries in the u such as germany and same thing with iceland so every time the
[1:57:39.360 --> 1:57:44.560]  bankers finance the eu they're on record doing it it's a big setup to be able to vampirically
[1:57:44.560 --> 1:57:51.280]  feed on people that's right i i think that uh part of the trouble these weak financial
[1:57:52.400 --> 1:57:57.680]  countries are having was induced by the investment banks or the hedge funds
[1:57:57.680 --> 1:58:06.320]  who speculated against their bonds and helped to drive them into this type of a situation
[1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:15.280]  uh you could even say if you can spiritual minded that we united states set this up as
[1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:24.880]  an attack on the euro because it's a way that lengthens the life of the dollar as reserve currency
[1:58:25.440 --> 1:58:33.360]  by creating these internal problems within the euro monitoring system all right stay there doctor

[2:00:52.160 --> 2:00:57.760]  up with the attack on the euro but i think it's just the big banks attacking different sectors
[2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:02.400]  and playing them off so all don't sink at once so they can sit on top the rubble pile briefly
[2:01:02.400 --> 2:01:09.920]  and then america's now a police state why do you say that well because we now have both characteristics
[2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:17.120]  of a police state american citizens no longer have any civil liberties american citizens not just
[2:01:17.760 --> 2:01:27.040]  so-called enemy combatants non-citizens or terrorists but american citizens are now being held without
[2:01:27.040 --> 2:01:34.800]  habeas corpus rights without due process one of them is this fellow hashy that they they have
[2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:44.000]  in the united states in indefinite detention that they're going to put on trial for not for any
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:51.120]  act of terrorism or planning terrorism but for speeches he gave as a student activist at brooklyn
[2:01:51.120 --> 2:01:57.280]  college in which he virally denounced the united states in other words they're going to put him on
[2:01:57.280 --> 2:02:04.240]  trial for using his first amendment rights and in the meantime they've denied all his other rights
[2:02:04.240 --> 2:02:10.880]  and he is a citizen now that's one definition of a police state the next thing that has happened
[2:02:10.880 --> 2:02:16.240]  as you know and you probably covered it widely a dentist player the head of national intelligence
[2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:23.440]  is announced that the united states government now has a list of americans and it's going to
[2:02:23.440 --> 2:02:32.080]  murder a ball now here is the head of national intelligence saying we're going to kill american
[2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:39.680]  citizens we're not going to arrest them put them on trial get a conviction and if it's a conviction
[2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:49.040]  for a capital crime executed we're just going to shoot them down well this is uh this completes
[2:02:49.680 --> 2:02:56.640]  of the police state first you take away everybody's rights to defend themselves and then you make
[2:02:56.640 --> 2:03:02.400]  defense irrelevant because you just shoot them down and don't even bother arrest them put them on
[2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:09.760]  trial so what and a lot of americans said alex you you've heard this i'm sure oh it's not going to be
[2:03:09.760 --> 2:03:13.600]  me i'm not doing anything wrong it's not going to bother me well we know they're using the
[2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:18.320]  patriot act per state thousands of times a year for marijuana and expanding there's now confirmed
[2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:23.600]  cases with the sneak and peak where they go to librarians a 85 year old woman in one case and
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:28.960]  said you can't tell anyone about this this this this illegal fake search warrant she gave it to her
[2:03:28.960 --> 2:03:35.520]  76 year old assistant and they arrested them both and charged him as terrorist right look the people
[2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:41.200]  who say oh it won't happen to me i'm not doing anything wrong they should remember that the
[2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:49.840]  nazi concentration camps and starlings boulog were full of millions of people who hadn't done
[2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:57.120]  anything wrong that's the whole point if you have a police state no one ever knows whether you did
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:04:01.600]  anything wrong or not because there's never any evidence there's never any trial there's never
[2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:08.720]  any conviction there's just arbitrary unaccountable power to pick up people whoever it might happen
[2:04:08.720 --> 2:04:16.480]  to be and so that is what we are faced with we now have american citizens remember now when they
[2:04:16.480 --> 2:04:23.440]  brought in all of this patriot act and and definite detention it was only for muslim terrorists
[2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:30.160]  and now we have americans who aren't even being charged with terrorism being charged for extreme
[2:04:30.160 --> 2:04:36.960]  language and we have judges around the country caught on record taking innocent school children
[2:04:36.960 --> 2:04:42.800]  and putting them in prisons for secret kickbacks there's no doubt this is the gulag economy dr

[2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:55.840]  the press conference and ask polite questions of geithner like why previously the treasury
[2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:00.080]  wouldn't hire anybody that the model does tax problems why he doesn't pay his taxes
[2:09:00.080 --> 2:09:05.120]  why they're blocking the bloomberg suit for 27 trillion dollars where that money with them
[2:09:05.120 --> 2:09:10.400]  the suits for 23.7 that's a six five six month old number it's over 28 trillion now
[2:09:11.200 --> 2:09:16.480]  there's a lot of other questions uh that uh tim geithner can be asked like like i want to give
[2:09:16.480 --> 2:09:22.320]  the guys this article uh secret summit of top bankers and of course he won't really answer any
[2:09:22.320 --> 2:09:27.520]  of this it's for the media and and congress has asked you where the trillions went what gives the
[2:09:27.520 --> 2:09:32.480]  treasury authority to keep that secret uh and and and what do you think of the bill to audit the fed
[2:09:32.480 --> 2:09:38.160]  the secret summit of top bankers news of australia including us officials meeting secret say what
[2:09:38.160 --> 2:09:42.720]  happened in that meeting two weeks ago what are you doing meeting secretly okay rob do get down
[2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:48.880]  there by the mic for me real quick uh it just says 330 does it say where it is they said it's
[2:09:48.880 --> 2:09:52.640]  going to be at the crash site so it's somewhere around there i imagine we get there we'll just
[2:09:52.640 --> 2:09:57.680]  you know walk around and ask somebody so we're going to leave um in about 20 minutes we should
[2:09:57.680 --> 2:10:03.280]  be ready to go all good and and everybody else should go to his media okay and uh should you
[2:10:03.280 --> 2:10:07.440]  know be polite be nice but it's your first moment right you know we're on we pay a salary that's

[2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:24.400]  because yeah because if they try to stop any reporters talking to them we're probably have
[2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:27.920]  to sue them just like they got sued over not letting people protest out front the governor's
[2:10:27.920 --> 2:10:34.240]  mansion this is all right to do it um to go ask these questions of this person and of course
[2:10:34.240 --> 2:10:37.920]  he's notice i have an article today how the white house is now doing less press conferences than
[2:10:37.920 --> 2:10:43.200]  bush and geithner is nowhere he's going there to act like a victim of course and so it's important
[2:10:43.200 --> 2:10:49.280]  to go and ask these serious questions so uh you guys go ahead and saddle up and get out of here
[2:10:49.280 --> 2:10:54.880]  uh all right god bless you take care buddy um and anybody can find the address if they want

[2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:14.400]  um
[2:11:18.320 --> 2:11:26.000]  94 30 research boulevard 94 30 research boulevard which is 183 it's right off 183
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:32.720]  pretty close to mopak you cannot miss it and uh again all you citizens out there that have
[2:11:32.720 --> 2:11:38.480]  your own media platforms get out there ask them questions it'll be surely be a media circus but
[2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:44.080]  the more media we have there better chance we have of asking an important uh question of this
[2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:48.000]  creature every time he gets up before congress they say where's the money why won't you tell us
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:52.720]  it's illegal and we're moving quickly to audit the fed it's past the house very very exciting
[2:11:52.720 --> 2:12:02.320]  things happening on this front now i've got bill gates calls for population reduction i've got
[2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:09.760]  new polls on america's matter than they've ever been uh i've got uh a lot of other really really
[2:12:10.720 --> 2:12:13.200]  important stories here that we're going to be going over
[2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:22.320]  but right now i want to get into joe stack before i get into usa today interviewing um
[2:12:23.840 --> 2:12:26.960]  glenn beck glenn beck says he believes in global warming and thinks we should all
[2:12:26.960 --> 2:12:32.960]  all accept all the taxes because it's a good thing so again he's always putting out multiple
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:38.640]  different messages depending on the audience he's talking to the true mark of a politician not a
[2:12:38.640 --> 2:12:44.000]  patriot of old benedict excuse me uh glenn beck excuse me benedict beck i almost got it wrong
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:51.920]  there benedict arnold excuse me glenn beck okay uh let's go through these latest developments
[2:12:51.920 --> 2:13:04.080]  with the kamikaze attack in austin last thursday now five days ago you have joe stack this pilot
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:10.240]  software developer musician who rob do actually knew he'd filled in with some of their bands
[2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:16.960]  he played for joe ealing a lot of other big bands he reportedly burns down his house goes
[2:13:16.960 --> 2:13:23.040]  and gets in an airplane flies into the irs slash fbi building within three hours of it happening
[2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:28.240]  and i predicted this two hours before it happened to uh at 11 a.m. then about an hour and a half
[2:13:28.240 --> 2:13:32.400]  later the media said yes it's the tea parties they came out and said it's the tea party movement
[2:13:32.400 --> 2:13:36.720]  they did it and i said i don't know if this is an inside job could have been a disgruntled angry
[2:13:36.720 --> 2:13:42.160]  person i think a lot of people are wrongly hailing this violent act because this is not the row we
[2:13:42.160 --> 2:13:47.440]  want to go down uh you know just offensively randomly targeting government people you need
[2:13:47.440 --> 2:13:52.480]  to bring them to justice through the courts we demand justice we demand due process we're against
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:55.840]  john you and others saying the government could just kill whoever they want without a judge or
[2:13:55.840 --> 2:14:01.120]  jury because they think they're guilty it's the same thing with this irs auditor that got killed
[2:14:01.120 --> 2:14:09.680]  in the 13 people that got wounded um this is a very dangerous road to be going down armed revolution
[2:14:09.680 --> 2:14:17.200]  you think the country's in trouble now the globalists are set up and want this to happen it doesn't
[2:14:17.200 --> 2:14:21.760]  mean the police and military won't get chewed up in the process they've had in le09 all these
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:26.080]  femur drills with foreign troops they want to chew up our police and military then bring in
[2:14:26.080 --> 2:14:29.840]  the foreign assets and the public's being conditioned for that it's really happening
[2:14:29.840 --> 2:14:37.200]  they want to shut down the web during a crisis they want to bring this grid into place i don't
[2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:42.720]  know if this is an inside job and because the media at first didn't they hyped it the first day
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:46.960]  but the second day kind of shut down a lot of media coverage i said maybe it isn't staged because
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:51.360]  when it's staged they hype it with a big production like the underwear bomber that's now
[2:14:51.360 --> 2:14:55.280]  been proven to be completely staged fbi got him on protecting him that's now admitted they lied
[2:14:55.280 --> 2:15:01.600]  about it at first ordering let him play without id through the state department fbi cia did
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:08.720]  it but now the hype is building up and they've got all these articles in the london guardian
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:13.040]  and the statesman and newark daily news countless ones i mean i can't even keep track of them i
[2:15:13.040 --> 2:15:17.280]  don't even read articles that are about me anymore other than to see it says you know the t-part people
[2:15:17.280 --> 2:15:25.440]  love it alex jones likes it you know i mean just very deceptive stuff here uh clearly that is
[2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:32.160]  a defamation but they're even blaming scott brown in the news saying he likes it just totally made
[2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:37.680]  up with no evidence i mean this is actionable legal basis here but i'm not going to probably
[2:15:37.680 --> 2:15:41.600]  do anything about it because i'm too busy fighting the globalist a suit would take up all our time
[2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:47.040]  the point is we're going to counter him because the media is already discredited now joe stax
[2:15:47.040 --> 2:15:51.920]  family doubt suicide note was written by him the ap reported according to an article from the
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:56.640]  associated press the osa texas suicide pilots note was not written by him the note was suspiciously
[2:15:56.640 --> 2:16:02.320]  found on his website almost immediately after the attack does not match his character it sounds like
[2:16:02.320 --> 2:16:08.880]  it's from someone other person samantha don bell stacks daughter from his first marriage told the
[2:16:08.880 --> 2:16:13.280]  associated press an interview from her home in norway but but now she said if he did do it
[2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:22.960]  that he's a hero it's not him she went on to say the letter itself sounds like it's coming from a
[2:16:22.960 --> 2:16:28.800]  different person it didn't sound like it came from him she told the associated press this information
[2:16:28.800 --> 2:16:33.200]  makes the possibility of this being a false flag operation even more evident rob do from info wars
[2:16:33.200 --> 2:16:40.160]  dot com also commented that this act did not fit his character rob do knew him as this story develops
[2:16:40.160 --> 2:16:43.680]  and it's clear that even if it was a sincere act will be used to demonize the patriot and
[2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:51.040]  tea party movements this from revolution radio website breaking down the ap now here's kx an nbc
[2:16:51.040 --> 2:16:58.560]  stack was calm before suicide attack noting that the pilot joe stax final exchange with a controller
[2:16:58.560 --> 2:17:02.480]  tower in george jama municipal airport would have indicated anything was out of the ordinary on
[2:17:02.480 --> 2:17:06.960]  thursday morning according to recording stacks piper in 28 dakota we're going to play that coming up
[2:17:06.960 --> 2:17:11.600]  was cleared for takeoff at 9 45 am have a nice day where stacks final calm words
[2:17:15.280 --> 2:17:19.520]  minutes later stack allegedly slammed his plane into the echelon one building
[2:17:19.520 --> 2:17:23.280]  in northwest where the internal revenue service houses complaint resolution office
[2:17:23.280 --> 2:17:26.960]  two people died the bodies have yet to be identified although suspected that one is
[2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:31.760]  stacked on the other a missing worker and they have not confirmed that another kxan interviewed
[2:17:31.760 --> 2:17:36.160]  witnesses one we interviewed several as well here on air who said there were already emergency
[2:17:36.160 --> 2:17:40.640]  workers out there before the attack and that the fbi by the time they heard the explosion
[2:17:40.640 --> 2:17:46.320]  looked out and they were also out there within seconds with video cameras now that's now been
[2:17:46.320 --> 2:17:53.920]  confirmed but here's the media spin here's the austin american statesman the austin american
[2:17:53.920 --> 2:18:00.080]  statesman from sunday february 21st give me a document cam shot for prison planet dot tv viewers
[2:18:00.080 --> 2:18:10.080]  of this place lucky coincidence may have saved lives travis county fire crews were training near
[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:16.080]  plane crash site on thursday morning just minutes before a single engine plane would plunge into
[2:18:16.080 --> 2:18:20.480]  the echelon one building the travis county hazardous materials teams gathered the parking lot
[2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:25.840]  of david buskers at the intersection of 183 and mopec boulevard loop one it was the first time the
[2:18:25.840 --> 2:18:32.640]  team had up of firefighters from lake travis flugerville west lake oak hill and other fire
[2:18:32.640 --> 2:18:36.160]  departments had decided to hold its monthly training exercise there yeah they were having
[2:18:36.160 --> 2:18:43.040]  training exercises that whole week someone had heard that a big empty lot was available
[2:18:43.040 --> 2:18:46.960]  and it was central location for team members coming from four corners of travis county boy
[2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:51.680]  they were just all there the parking lot just happened to be across the highway from the echelon
[2:18:51.680 --> 2:18:57.200]  one building fire officials say the presence of the travis county crews particularly vital
[2:18:57.200 --> 2:19:01.520]  because several austin firefighters and engines in the area were already battling a blaze at the
[2:19:01.520 --> 2:19:06.320]  home of andrew joseph stack the third accused of being the pilot it was a huge coincidence
[2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:10.160]  and we're not saying the firefighters were involved but clearly they could pre deploy them
[2:19:10.160 --> 2:19:14.800]  just saying oh go have your drill out here it's like they had drills of an attack on seven seven
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:20.960]  drills of an attack on the exact buildings the exact time on nine eleven and one of the homeland
[2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:27.840]  secure uh well at the time it was fema subdirectors kennedy was on record on abc news saying we
[2:19:27.840 --> 2:19:33.360]  deployed on nine eleven the night before for a terror attack drill and then juliani admitted
[2:19:33.360 --> 2:19:36.960]  that in several interviews and then later backed off of it and later it was confirmed tripod too
[2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:42.400]  was being carried out equally luckily was the fact that travis county firefighters had brought
[2:19:42.400 --> 2:19:46.160]  their fire engine typically the team doesn't use fire engines but lake travis fire and rescue
[2:19:46.160 --> 2:19:51.440]  it just received some new trucks wanted to show them off the other department said lake travis
[2:19:51.440 --> 2:19:57.120]  lieutenant ben sanders by the grace of god we had this apparatus with us he said and then there's
[2:19:57.120 --> 2:20:04.480]  another coincidence we'll cover when we come back straight ahead was it a false flag money talks
[2:20:04.480 --> 2:20:11.520]  and it sounds just like jim kramer i'm kramer money talks and sometimes it shouts when the

[2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:07.680]  carney over at the business insider website city group is sending the following information to
[2:28:07.680 --> 2:28:14.000]  its consumers along with their bank statements effective april first 2010 we reserve the right
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:19.520]  to require seven days advanced notice before permitting a withdrawal from all checking accounts
[2:28:19.520 --> 2:28:24.880]  while we do not currently exercise this right and if not exercise in the past we are required by law
[2:28:24.880 --> 2:28:29.440]  to notify you of this change now some people try to claim it's an april fools it's not we have the
[2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:35.760]  city bank website link next we thought i thought to go actually get it and it's word for word the
[2:28:35.760 --> 2:28:41.600]  same but saying january first that's when they told their bank regulators this was the new policy
[2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:47.680]  took them a few months to get it in place and now they've put it out on their website and it's okay
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:53.760]  so here it is almost identical advisory to the one being sent out can be read on the page 22 of

[2:29:34.080 --> 2:29:38.480]  in the statement city group confirmed that they were had reserved the right to impose the new

[2:41:00.400 --> 2:41:06.640]  got Lyme disease and uh i'm battling it here in arizona i've been informed since i was 16 years
[2:41:06.640 --> 2:41:12.400]  old in fact i've worked for president or governor up governor reagan and president elect reagan
[2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:19.760]  at the republican national convention in detroit in 1980 and uh i have an incident i just wanted
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:25.680]  to share with some of your listeners because um it's something that happened to me and i remarked
[2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:30.480]  to people uh everywhere is that the famous incident where they came in and said we don't care if
[2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:34.400]  you're the guy that's going to get elected you won't be if you don't put george h w bush on
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:38.720]  the ticket because that was seen by hundreds of people and reported by the press absolutely i
[2:41:38.720 --> 2:41:44.560]  i was i was around that i was the individual that actually after the pressure was put on
[2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:51.040]  reagan if you remember uh and uh they had some clips here recently on on on television because
[2:41:51.040 --> 2:41:57.760]  cronkite had had died last year and that famous shot of cronkite uh with jerry ford up in the
[2:41:57.760 --> 2:42:02.960]  booth at the joe louis arena in detroit and i was standing underneath it at the time
[2:42:02.960 --> 2:42:10.720]  and all the rumors that uh were floating around of this phony reagan uh ford presidency
[2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:17.360]  we were true conservatives there and if you if you may recall the true conservatives were behind
[2:42:17.360 --> 2:42:22.800]  phil crane at the time they wanted uh reagan to pick phil crane from illinois it would have been
[2:42:22.800 --> 2:42:29.760]  a one-two punch for conservatism but the eastern establishment uh wanted to uh they were so and
[2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:36.480]  the press the eastern establishment the bankers um and the press were so upset that reagan was
[2:42:36.480 --> 2:42:42.160]  going to win that convention that they they put incredible pressure on him to pick george bush
[2:42:42.160 --> 2:42:48.720]  senior as his running mate by the way i was talking to dr paul card roberts off air because
[2:42:48.720 --> 2:42:54.400]  every time we we sent a team to interview him in florida too but talking about bush going after
[2:42:54.400 --> 2:43:02.160]  reagan once he was in office but uh real fast sean finish up yeah yeah uh i was the i was the
[2:43:02.160 --> 2:43:07.600]  person who they entrusted to the following day reagan made an announcement he broke with tradition
[2:43:07.600 --> 2:43:12.480]  he came out on the floor the convention on that wednesday night and said i have to dispel all these
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:18.160]  rumors uh i have asked george bush to be my vice president and he has accepted the next day which
[2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:23.280]  was thursday morning they sent me i went from the top of the renaissance center in detroit with a
[2:43:23.280 --> 2:43:30.160]  a top secret file basically pertaining to um a press release and i took it over to the bush camp
[2:43:30.160 --> 2:43:35.120]  to the bush boys w may have been there at the time i can't remember but there were the three boys
[2:43:35.680 --> 2:43:43.040]  up in the potcha train hotel hotel and listed bushes complete history uh with zephyr oil in
[2:43:43.040 --> 2:43:48.080]  texas and and so forth and i looked at it i wasn't supposed to but i looked at it because i
[2:43:48.080 --> 2:43:52.400]  was informed of the trilateral commission at the time and so forth i was only 19 yeah that
[2:43:52.400 --> 2:43:57.360]  actually came out in flat actually came out in florida papers that that reagan had been
[2:43:57.360 --> 2:44:03.680]  criticizing bush for being a new world order person well absolutely and we were all shocked but
[2:44:03.680 --> 2:44:09.520]  but i i just want to let people know that this thing is real uh you're a great patriot i listen

[2:44:56.160 --> 2:45:01.120]  people that are out there let's go back to our phone system here in austin joe in ohio you're on the
[2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:08.720]  year what's up info warriors alex thank you very much the verbal militia on justin dot tv loves you
[2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:14.640]  you want to ask you as this bank withholding it starts to spread i mean it looks like we could
[2:45:14.640 --> 2:45:21.440]  be on the verge of a run uh... if there is a run i have two questions number one what do you think
[2:45:21.440 --> 2:45:24.960]  it would look like in modern times we haven't seen a run in a long while and we've talked to all
[2:45:24.960 --> 2:45:31.840]  these financial go ahead number two what do we do what are things that people that have it
[2:45:31.840 --> 2:45:35.680]  that still hold money in banks what are things that they can do to prepare for something like that
[2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:39.200]  okay i appreciate your call let me try to respond to this
[2:45:40.640 --> 2:45:46.080]  for those that don't know is the top story on prisonplanet.com city group says fez ordered
[2:45:46.080 --> 2:45:52.960]  seven-day restriction on bank withdrawals it's confirmed from the city bank website no one
[2:45:52.960 --> 2:45:59.440]  thought to actually go get it we did we linked to it it's real it's real drudge reports got it
[2:45:59.440 --> 2:46:06.000]  linked up there right now now notice it's a seven day that's exactly what bob Chapman
[2:46:07.120 --> 2:46:10.080]  and ron paul and so many others that we trust if several happened
[2:46:11.280 --> 2:46:16.480]  they won't close the banks because they don't have the money to give you the federal reserve
[2:46:16.480 --> 2:46:22.080]  can print whatever it wants though there's about one percent now actual physical money
[2:46:22.720 --> 2:46:26.480]  for all the fiat money the banks have created for themselves they just created out of nothing
[2:46:26.480 --> 2:46:29.360]  it's it's it's digital and they loaned it to you at high interest
[2:46:33.360 --> 2:46:38.960]  the reason they under this federal regulation want a seven day and it's now in is what they do
[2:46:38.960 --> 2:46:46.320]  is they close the bank for a week say you can't get it out because there will be a run to get
[2:46:47.840 --> 2:46:54.160]  that money out before they come out and say okay we've got a new currency it'll still be dollars
[2:46:54.160 --> 2:46:59.840]  but new serial numbers that will have a lower value or they can devalue it across the board
[2:46:59.840 --> 2:47:03.840]  but generally they'll close the bank so there's not a big run in a freak out because then they
[2:47:03.840 --> 2:47:10.000]  will have trouble getting the physical money out and then you just write a check through the
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:15.920]  federal reserve and you get a you know money in six weeks that's happened before the issue is
[2:47:15.920 --> 2:47:20.880]  it's done while they devalue the currency and they're openly talking about devaluing the currency
[2:47:20.880 --> 2:47:25.440]  and they had this secret meeting two weeks ago in australia where they were setting all this up
[2:47:25.440 --> 2:47:30.320]  now we don't know if that's going to happen but that's what's going on there and and clearly
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:34.480]  they're announcing that they can take your pension funds and the government can nationalize them
[2:47:34.480 --> 2:47:41.760]  tax them and give you part of it back they're announcing that several months ago that now
[2:47:41.760 --> 2:47:45.600]  your money market isn't insured that they can just keep it that's bigger than this
[2:47:45.600 --> 2:47:51.600]  and they're now announcing everywhere seven days and some banks are now implementing it wells fargo
[2:47:51.600 --> 2:47:56.160]  is implementing it but somebody right here in my office sat in a counter for 12 years went in to
[2:47:56.160 --> 2:48:02.160]  put their paycheck in they wanted was a $600 the check out you know to pay for stuff and they said
[2:48:02.160 --> 2:48:07.200]  no you'll wait seven days but this isn't waiting seven days on your own check this is waiting
[2:48:07.200 --> 2:48:11.360]  seven days on money you've already got in and they're getting the embassies ready for all this
[2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:15.520]  does that mean it's going to happen i don't know but this is big news obviously city groups
[2:48:15.520 --> 2:48:20.400]  says feds ordered seven day restriction on bank withdrawals prisonplanet.com if you want to read
[2:48:20.400 --> 2:48:29.600]  the whole thing you're asking how to protect your money sir i have 18 employees and four contractors
[2:48:30.720 --> 2:48:37.680]  so we got 22 employees or is it 23 i guess counting myself and my wife it's 25 i'm an
[2:48:37.680 --> 2:48:42.640]  employee of my own corporation for liability issues and to keep everything straight the point is
[2:48:42.640 --> 2:48:54.480]  is of the 25 employees or 20 no no 18 night it's 20 employees and four contractors there you go
[2:48:54.480 --> 2:49:01.520]  or under the math here we have to keep quite a bit of money in the bank just constant bills
[2:49:01.520 --> 2:49:05.920]  i mean it's huge bills i have to continue to hustle just to get money and to pay all these massive
[2:49:05.920 --> 2:49:12.960]  bills to run the website the building the power the the taxes the paychecks the vendor checks
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:19.600]  buying the dvds the books you gotta buy them in bulk and so most of the money i have is just
[2:49:19.600 --> 2:49:24.080]  sitting in banks people say well you should get it out i don't have time to be running around with
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:28.800]  safety deposit boxes of cash and and getting money orders to mail them out for business we've got
[2:49:28.800 --> 2:49:33.840]  to be able to do this rapidly i do have some gold and silver scattered around here in there but not
[2:49:33.840 --> 2:49:40.960]  that much um we're going to be okay because even if we go into a depression we have a big enough
[2:49:40.960 --> 2:49:46.160]  audience to where have i ever had to come to you and say the irs has locked up our bank accounts
[2:49:46.160 --> 2:49:51.840]  or they've locked them all up as you know if it comes to that people better get me some wired money
[2:49:51.840 --> 2:49:56.720]  or some money orders or some gold and silver right now but i haven't done that because we don't need
[2:49:56.720 --> 2:50:02.160]  it and i've tried to be a good steward i've got six months of capital to run this office which is
[2:50:02.160 --> 2:50:07.120]  able to me it's a lot of money but it's really nothing if all the money stopped coming in i
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:11.120]  could operate for six months and that's better than most people that are fighting the new world
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:17.120]  order most people are by a shoe string but you know back when i was in a apartment one room
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:23.360]  apartment i was saving about half the money i had and just slowly building savings and then we
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:27.840]  reinvested in equipment cameras computers more personnel so i've always been a pretty good
[2:50:27.840 --> 2:50:33.040]  steward of what we do because it's a mission here uh but you know what should you do
[2:50:34.640 --> 2:50:41.120]  everybody should have water firearms gold and silver food uh good neighbors friends people
[2:50:41.120 --> 2:50:46.640]  that you can help each other pledge to help each other in times of need mutual you know pledge of
[2:50:46.640 --> 2:50:53.440]  support good friends and families better is worth more than all the gold in the hills okay lexie

[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:48.080]  with your phone calls lexie in washington you're on the air lexie welcome hi um thank you i had a
[2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:54.240]  question regarding a web page that i've been visiting and reading up about it's called planetary
[2:55:54.240 --> 2:56:03.120]  skin and it's a nasa and cisco project for global global sorry global surveillance
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:08.000]  and i've sort of been reading over the past few days and asking family members and people
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:13.120]  i know like what they think about it and i say the name again i've actually i've actually seen
[2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:18.880]  that yeah it's part of their total surveillance grid punch that up for folks yeah planetary skin
[2:56:18.880 --> 2:56:24.400]  and the first thing i saw was the video and on their website their video um is available on
[2:56:24.400 --> 2:56:33.840]  their resources tab and tell folks about it well they're uh it's kind of confusing because they
[2:56:33.840 --> 2:56:40.720]  have so many partners that there's lots of offshoots of this program yeah cisco lays down most of the
[2:56:40.720 --> 2:56:48.080]  actual grid that the internet's on right and then there's other aspects like their partners with
[2:56:48.080 --> 2:56:58.880]  um this thing called MIT well everybody knows MIT but uh it's it's like a basically MIT has
[2:56:58.880 --> 2:57:05.040]  aspects called like uh it's internet too home home connector and they have something called bus
[2:57:05.040 --> 2:57:11.280]  connector and there's videos on their website where it's very futuristic like these things
[2:57:11.280 --> 2:57:16.320]  haven't actually come to unfold but they're yeah you're you're you're a refrigerator
[2:57:16.320 --> 2:57:21.440]  your thermostat everything's remote controlled by the government right and there's a pretty part
[2:57:21.440 --> 2:57:25.520]  in one of their videos where they they at one point they're saying well these are just drones
[2:57:25.520 --> 2:57:30.320]  and they're going to measure your carbon output and then you're going to have a global tax related
[2:57:30.320 --> 2:57:35.600]  to this that's right they've already launched they've already launched the drones drone surveillance
[2:57:35.600 --> 2:57:42.480]  your thermostat watching drone seamless personal but then on parts of their videos they're showing
[2:57:42.480 --> 2:57:49.200]  some lady in her living room standing in front of like a teleprompter like and she's not touching it

[2:58:18.960 --> 2:58:24.480]  a barcode that's scannable and will be read by the cell towers this is on record 10 years ago
[2:58:24.480 --> 2:58:31.360]  where they can search real items in the real world and track where everything's at they can use the

[2:59:10.960 --> 2:59:16.960]  they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens

[3:00:25.680 --> 3:00:31.600]  going on all the products tracking everywhere you go what you do it's a global skin they actually
[3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:37.920]  call it a control grip and you know they spin it it's for the environment the dying earth we've
[3:00:37.920 --> 3:00:42.800]  got to cut your carbon footprint we can only let you have one child bill gates is now openly
[3:00:42.800 --> 3:00:49.760]  talking about it this is a short segment i want to play one of literally scores of videos on the
[3:00:50.640 --> 3:00:59.200]  smart skin global skin mit pentagon produced un's involved website we can't track and we can't
[3:01:00.080 --> 3:01:05.200]  you know save the planet if we can't survey let if we can't control it if we can't watch everything
[3:01:05.200 --> 3:01:10.080]  you're doing so the spy satellites are now to watch your farm your ranch everything is to control
[3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:14.960]  you everything you do is to be monitored you're going to have certain carbon credits for how much
[3:01:14.960 --> 3:01:22.080]  you can buy sell and trade so i'm going to play this video we're going to go out to break and then
[3:01:22.080 --> 3:01:25.760]  we'll come back and continue with your phone calls but since a caller brought this up it's why i love
[3:01:25.760 --> 3:01:30.000]  taking calls because it brings up all these wildcards and they propose this whole thing like
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:35.040]  it's a great thing i'm going to save you but it's all based on a fraud and all designed for eugenics
[3:01:35.040 --> 3:01:40.240]  here it is population reduction programming planetary skin institute
[3:01:42.800 --> 3:01:49.200]  sense predict act three simple steps to address complex global challenges pre crime
[3:01:50.640 --> 3:01:56.240]  the major challenges arising from climate change impact every aspect of our lives on our planet our
[3:01:56.240 --> 3:02:01.840]  societies economies and the environment are already bearing the impacts and there's more
[3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:08.800]  and more dramatic to come we'll see those impacts materializing at every level from local to global
[3:02:08.800 --> 3:02:15.360]  on land at sea and in developing and developed countries as they try to address multiple and
[3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:22.480]  intertwined problems such as water scarcity food security rainforest cover and biodiversity loss
[3:02:23.280 --> 3:02:28.240]  the ever-growing demand for energy and its conservation people around the world make billions
[3:02:28.240 --> 3:02:34.640]  of decisions large and small every day but whether they're in the public or private sector
[3:02:34.640 --> 3:02:39.840]  or simply making choices about their local community all these people share a common problem
[3:02:39.840 --> 3:02:45.600]  they're flying blind because they only have partial information it comes down to a simple
[3:02:45.600 --> 3:02:52.800]  observation we can't manage what we can't measure compounding this challenge is the vast
[3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:59.760]  amount of data that's continuously gathered but held in isolated silos the planetary skin r&d
[3:02:59.760 --> 3:03:06.000]  program offers a new unifying approach to addressing these major challenges planetary skin
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:11.520]  creates a distributed nervous system integrating information from network sensors on the ground
[3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:18.720]  at sea in the air and in space from machines and of course from people it pulls all that information
[3:03:18.720 --> 3:03:23.680]  into an open and shared decision space giving people the information they need how and when
[3:03:23.680 --> 3:03:29.760]  they need it researchers will be able to immerse themselves in the decision space here they can
[3:03:29.760 --> 3:03:35.120]  carry out all their day-to-day carbon monitoring tasks this will enable the risk scoring needed
[3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:42.160]  to unlock large-scale public and private finance planetary skins open collaborative platform
[3:03:42.160 --> 3:03:47.360]  dynamically distributes decisions throughout communities and this in turn streamlines the
[3:03:47.360 --> 3:03:53.200]  flow of decisions between stakeholders achieving trust and fully informed decision making requires
[3:03:53.200 --> 3:03:58.480]  pooling a wide range of assets and capabilities national and international collaboration across
[3:03:58.480 --> 3:04:04.160]  sectors and disciplines is the key to success the planetary skin institute answers that critical
[3:04:04.160 --> 3:04:09.680]  requirement it will research develop and prototype a close to real-time global monitoring of
[3:04:09.680 --> 3:04:15.040]  environmental conditions and changes to develop the required decision support capabilities to
[3:04:15.040 --> 3:04:22.480]  manage global resources and risks and enable the development of environmental markets PSI will
[3:04:22.480 --> 3:04:27.600]  provide a research and development platform for open collaboration between the public private
[3:04:27.600 --> 3:04:34.960]  academic and NGO sectors that will be governed as a global public good PSI is structured as a
[3:04:34.960 --> 3:04:40.000]  not-for-profit entity with a mantra of open innovation to engage and partner with the world's
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:47.680]  leading R&D institutions to co-develop required capabilities the PSI global network will be
[3:04:47.680 --> 3:04:53.760]  made up of seven peer regional networks interconnected in a seamless collaborative network underpinned

[3:08:19.280 --> 3:08:27.200]  all right ladies and gentlemen we just played a video an audio a planetary skin smart dust control
[3:08:27.200 --> 3:08:33.360]  grid at least 10 years ago i saw reports in australia england in the u.s as well as canada
[3:08:34.480 --> 3:08:43.680]  where they're installing wireless camera and microphone systems that are powered off of solar
[3:08:43.680 --> 3:08:49.360]  power in the most remote areas to surveil people this is why you go to rural four-way stops the
[3:08:49.360 --> 3:08:54.720]  middle of nowhere where there's an old shutdown gas station and a mule behind a fence and a dog
[3:08:54.720 --> 3:08:58.480]  running around i mean i've literally been out in the middle of nowhere in west texas east texas
[3:08:58.480 --> 3:09:03.840]  you name it and there's cameras at the four-way stops hooked into the pentagon and they admit
[3:09:03.840 --> 3:09:08.400]  this is their control grid but notice in this video when they're showing climate change they show
[3:09:08.400 --> 3:09:15.440]  a time lapse of a power plant and it looks like smoke is just coming off the whole thing well
[3:09:15.440 --> 3:09:20.640]  ladies and gentlemen you can look at an air conditioner anything when it's cold this morning
[3:09:20.640 --> 3:09:26.240]  it was like 45 degrees it it looked like smoke was pouring off all the buildings by my office
[3:09:26.240 --> 3:09:33.200]  it's heat it's water condensation it's as big a pollutant as when you exhale in cold weather
[3:09:33.200 --> 3:09:38.160]  and it looks like smoke it's not smoke now i know you know that but the public doesn't show that
[3:09:38.160 --> 3:09:42.400]  power plant again because that's a shot of just one from the air it actually shows a power plant
[3:09:42.400 --> 3:09:49.120]  from a distance there it is hit hit play on that that's a time lapse of a power plant no doubt
[3:09:49.120 --> 3:09:53.760]  near the arctic circle or norway or something because it's so cold that only happens when it's
[3:09:53.760 --> 3:09:59.120]  below zero i've seen footage from minnesota when it's below zero and everything i mean if a human
[3:09:59.120 --> 3:10:04.080]  gets on top of roof heat just pours off of them so notice that's not just heat coming out of smoke
[3:10:04.080 --> 3:10:10.320]  stacks that's water vapor but oh my gosh look at that pollution look at all that smoke i don't want
[3:10:10.320 --> 3:10:18.800]  my kids breathing that even the dirtiest factories and refineries down on the texas coast when it's
[3:10:18.800 --> 3:10:24.320]  warm weather you see no smoke no nothing if they're they are burning something off it's natural gas
[3:10:24.320 --> 3:10:31.040]  and you'll see a plume a fire very clean burning and it's what plants breathe is what it's putting
[3:10:31.040 --> 3:10:37.600]  off now i know you know that the public doesn't we have to expose this fraud uh now i i want to go

[3:12:06.880 --> 3:12:12.960]  a friend of mine sent me in game and while i was in korea teaching english and uh real quick i go to
[3:12:12.960 --> 3:12:18.640]  a seminary in northern indian and people here just so bought off on the new world order stuff uh
[3:12:19.200 --> 3:12:23.920]  you know i'm about the only person who really uh you know mentioned stuff that you that you know
[3:12:23.920 --> 3:12:29.600]  you and other people talk about um but anyway the quick question i had for you is uh i showed
[3:12:29.600 --> 3:12:35.840]  in game to a friend of mine this week who was very intrigued and uh you know he has he had a
[3:12:35.840 --> 3:12:42.960]  the one problem he had on it was where you get on a megaphone and you uh talk to the world uh
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:47.760]  you know the boulder birds and stuff like that and um you know i try to explain and you know this
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:52.080]  is a tactic that goes to the bible you know what the prophet's using it all the way through jesus
[3:12:52.080 --> 3:12:58.240]  using it you have to go before the evil king and call him out and some people like that some people
[3:12:58.240 --> 3:13:05.520]  don't the point is it's the information what are we going to do about it uh yeah so yeah i
[3:13:05.520 --> 3:13:10.320]  appreciate that but yeah anyway i just wanted to uh say you know thanks for putting out those videos
[3:13:10.320 --> 3:13:14.640]  i you know a lot of things i couldn't connect the dots with a few years ago and had the seminary
[3:13:14.640 --> 3:13:19.360]  go to i'm about the only one who is you know saying you know obama's not our hope when most
[3:13:19.360 --> 3:13:23.760]  people are saying oh he's our hope here i don't know what's up a seminary you're going to but i mean
[3:13:23.760 --> 3:13:28.240]  big government the world council of churches national council of churches started by the
[3:13:28.240 --> 3:13:32.720]  rocker fellers have come in and taken over all the big denominations including catholic
[3:13:32.720 --> 3:13:37.520]  and that's just what they pushed 24 7 is world government's good it's truly sickening but you
[3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:42.960]  know tell your friend it's the information what is the in game dot com that the website has a full
[3:13:42.960 --> 3:13:47.360]  bibliography of what's in that film he needs to address the issues and what is he going to do about
[3:13:47.360 --> 3:13:51.680]  it instead of saying i don't like him shouting on a megaphone i appreciate your call julie in

[3:14:16.080 --> 3:14:21.360]  mistake glenn beck does some good okay by widening the people that are aware of the stuff the problem
[3:14:21.360 --> 3:14:26.560]  is a key points he says global warming's real we need new taxes banker bailouts are good
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:31.200]  ron paul is bad syrup uh... you know uh... uh... never madina's bad
[3:14:31.760 --> 3:14:37.360]  he he he does enough good stuff to get your confidence it's like rat poisons 90 percent good food
[3:14:38.080 --> 3:14:42.640]  if i'm being deceived i want to know i consider myself open-minded and i just want to get to the
[3:14:42.640 --> 3:14:47.760]  truth but i have heard you made that several comments uh... things that he said that uh...
[3:14:47.760 --> 3:14:53.280]  glenn has said nine eleven truthers should be locked up they're capable of violence they might kill
[3:14:53.280 --> 3:14:59.440]  the president uh... we should pay our cap and trade taxes but then the sound bite you played
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:03.920]  uh... talked about him saying prayer politicians moved to the center
[3:15:04.480 --> 3:15:10.080]  i i just wanted to see if you could reference a date in a program that he made a statement so that
[3:15:10.080 --> 3:15:19.840]  i can uh... just ma'am ma'am number one uh... i'll i'll be talking about all the things glenn
[3:15:19.840 --> 3:15:28.640]  beck is done in general and then i will play a new clip uh... of something he's saying we don't
[3:15:28.640 --> 3:15:32.880]  want our politicians to move to the center of that false political paradigm both the liberals
[3:15:32.880 --> 3:15:37.760]  and conservatives are bringing in big government new world order we want to move out of that system
[3:15:37.760 --> 3:15:43.600]  but uh... i was just looking around for it sarah pale in this a global warming's real
[3:15:43.600 --> 3:15:51.600]  uh... senator mccain says it uh... glenn beck has said it repeatedly and normally i wouldn't
[3:15:51.600 --> 3:15:56.320]  have it in front of me even though i have a great memory it just so happens today
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:16:05.040]  i have u s a today from sunday in fact give me a document cam shot for folks it's don't judge
[3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:10.240]  beck by his cover and it says he believes in global warming and they interviewed him and he
[3:16:10.240 --> 3:16:14.080]  says you'd be an idiot not to notice the temperature change he says he also says
[3:16:15.280 --> 3:16:19.680]  and this article they gave me his part cut off i i i i had another print out of one where i could
[3:16:19.680 --> 3:16:24.400]  read where i could read the whole thing guys will you reprint me the glenn beck and and and
[3:16:24.400 --> 3:16:28.000]  give it to me in a printer friendly because this is cutting off a whole word at the end and i can't
[3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:36.480]  read it to her you know the point is ma'am is that uh... he did say that ron paul supporters want
[3:16:36.480 --> 3:16:41.600]  a money bomb which means blowing things up we need to have our troops uh... deal with these
[3:16:41.600 --> 3:16:46.480]  type of people they're dangerous and it was a talking point with scarborough and others saying
[3:16:46.480 --> 3:16:50.400]  we need to taste them and take them to prison and all these fox news people saying it i mean
[3:16:50.400 --> 3:16:55.120]  of i mean if i spent hours there's thousands of glenn beck clips i could go pull those up
[3:16:55.120 --> 3:16:59.120]  i could play clips of him saying the bank or bailouts good that we need all these new taxes
[3:16:59.120 --> 3:17:03.280]  are you saying you're a glenn beck listener and you've never heard any of that
[3:17:03.280 --> 3:17:05.680]  that
[3:17:05.680 --> 3:17:09.280]  hold on they didn't have faded back up and you gotta you gotta start over they didn't have you
[3:17:09.280 --> 3:17:14.960]  faded out go ahead if he really did make these comments i would like to know because i've never
[3:17:14.960 --> 3:17:20.960]  heard such a thing and i personally don't buy into the global warming camp well ma'am ma'am ma'am
[3:17:20.960 --> 3:17:27.040]  here's an issue i'll be here in a week saying by federal law all cell phones without warrants
[3:17:27.040 --> 3:17:30.880]  listen to you and track where you're at now i just so happened to have newsweek here today
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:35.360]  i won't have this in front of me next week i'll clean the desk off here's newsweek february 19th
[3:17:35.360 --> 3:17:38.560]  the snitch in your pocket law enforcement is tracking american cell phones in real time
[3:17:38.560 --> 3:17:43.440]  without the benefit of a warrant okay i'll be talking a month from now about the secret meeting
[3:17:43.440 --> 3:17:48.160]  of banks in australia two weeks ago i won't have this in front of me secret summit of top bankers
[3:17:48.160 --> 3:17:57.440]  meeting in secret everything i told you is true everything i just went over is in usa today um
[3:17:57.440 --> 3:18:03.360]  um he's i mean i don't even hardly pay attention to him and this is all i hear the problem is
[3:18:03.360 --> 3:18:07.920]  he'll start out with something good like saying the tea parties are good but the next he says
[3:18:07.920 --> 3:18:12.640]  you know we can't deal with these extremists over on the right and the left i mean i don't know
[3:18:12.640 --> 3:18:19.120]  what to say to you about you never hearing him call for new taxes that says don't judge back
[3:18:19.120 --> 3:18:26.320]  by his cover and uh it says uh zoom in on this for me here it is he believes in global warming
[3:18:26.320 --> 3:18:31.280]  you'd be an idiot this is a quote not to notice the temperature change he says he also says there's
[3:18:31.280 --> 3:18:38.080]  a legit case for global warming has at least in part been caused by mankind he has tried to do
[3:18:38.080 --> 3:18:42.880]  this part by buying a home with green design and using energy saving products quote i'm willing to
[3:18:42.880 --> 3:18:49.200]  do anything but use the cfls he says the compact fluorescent light bulbs i put one in once and
[3:18:49.200 --> 3:18:53.440]  couldn't stand the way it lit up the room i mean it's just it's every day it i mean it's it's
[3:18:53.440 --> 3:19:00.240]  it's you you don't know he was for the banker bailout i mean i mean you didn't seem to say that it
[3:19:00.240 --> 3:19:08.640]  isn't big enough no i i hear him saying that the government needs to stop spending i know i know i
[3:19:08.640 --> 3:19:16.000]  know i know and then at key points at key points he will then come back and double back on that
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:24.560]  look look do you have youtube ma'am yes youtube glenn beck neocon not libertarian and that's a small
[3:19:25.520 --> 3:19:30.080]  smattering of him demonizing ron paul a small smattering of him calling for
[3:19:31.360 --> 3:19:39.360]  all you know more taxes and uh the other issue of the banker bailout i i know that's my point
[3:19:39.360 --> 3:19:44.800]  he'll have ron paul on one day in the next day attacking and so it's going on but i'm glad you're
[3:19:44.800 --> 3:19:49.600]  out there searching but that's the problem to even get into glenn beck perhaps i should just do a whole
[3:19:49.600 --> 3:19:54.320]  show or a couple hours the next few weeks and get dozens of clips lined up and that'll just be my

[3:24:49.200 --> 3:24:55.600]  never heard glenn say that myself and i i'm just trying to determine it's his radio program radically
[3:24:55.600 --> 3:25:01.520]  different than what he presents on television it is it is it is a lot different uh ma'am have you
[3:25:01.520 --> 3:25:06.480]  seen us say today i mean i'm not making that up from yesterday no but i jotted that down and i
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:12.480]  intend to look that up yeah i don't listen to his radio program i watch the television program and i
[3:25:12.480 --> 3:25:18.720]  dvr it when i can't watch and i've just never heard him make these statements well i don't know

[3:25:41.120 --> 3:25:46.720]  government club uh he look he says a lot of the right things ma'am but then he doubles back at
[3:25:46.720 --> 3:25:53.200]  key points key political points that's my point let's go ahead and talk to michael in texas michael
[3:25:53.200 --> 3:25:58.480]  you're on the air go ahead thanks alex thanks for taking my call i've been listening to watch
[3:25:58.480 --> 3:26:04.720]  a new uh for almost 14 years back when you and mike were doing your little tv show down here
[3:26:04.720 --> 3:26:12.160]  in public access television uh you inspired me to uh stand up for myself in the face of abusive
[3:26:12.160 --> 3:26:18.560]  police authority uh it ended up getting me roughed up by the police but uh it also motivated me to
[3:26:18.560 --> 3:26:24.720]  get involved in this fight and uh i've been in it ever since i wanted to thank you uh for for the
[3:26:24.720 --> 3:26:32.960]  job that you and your staff do um i wanted to echo the sentiments of the importance of supporting
[3:26:32.960 --> 3:26:40.400]  a broadcast like this uh folks that may say back 10 percent for their church or some charity
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:48.000]  for some other country or something right now our country right now is a pivotal moment in history
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:53.920]  and there is nothing in my opinion that is more important than keeping this broadcast on the air
[3:26:53.920 --> 3:26:58.560]  and keeping this message getting out it has grown exponentially thanks to the hard work
[3:26:58.560 --> 3:27:02.960]  of patriot listeners and activists well sir it's not just people tithing with their money and i
[3:27:02.960 --> 3:27:07.760]  appreciate that it's tithing with your time tell your friends and family that have iphones

[3:27:30.080 --> 3:27:35.440]  somebody the full picture one time and their mind is unlocked and sure it doesn't work with everybody
[3:27:35.440 --> 3:27:41.600]  but we don't need the majority go ahead absolutely whether you can sacrifice your time or your money
[3:27:41.600 --> 3:27:47.440]  whatever your physically or financially capable of it is about sacrifice it is about giving up

[3:33:17.360 --> 3:33:21.920]  we can bring the country back but you have to do some discipline you have to free spending yep you
[3:33:21.920 --> 3:33:27.440]  have to have a national sales tax yep percent what did you think about that um i actually
[3:33:28.640 --> 3:33:33.520]  i made some notes excellent i actually agree with you except i believe it should be a vat tax
[3:33:33.520 --> 3:33:38.400]  two percent vat value added no more no more than two percent what's the difference between a sales
[3:33:38.400 --> 3:33:43.920]  tax and a value value add tax goes through our value added tax goes through absolutely everything
[3:33:43.920 --> 3:33:48.640]  so it hits two percent on every piece you make a car somebody's making the radio two percent
[3:33:48.640 --> 3:33:53.440]  somebody's making the so it hits the corporations it is all the way
[3:33:56.080 --> 3:34:01.440]  now they propose this like it's gonna get us out of debt to the banks and oh yeah we'll cut
[3:34:01.440 --> 3:34:06.160]  we'll cut spending notice and they don't even take it rid of the income tax they have a lot of

[3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:47.280]  one minute of color because i've got to get to this
[3:35:47.280 --> 3:35:55.520]  gordon brown situation uh let's go to let's go to herman in new york go ahead yes well
[3:35:55.520 --> 3:36:02.880]  how can you hear me yes sir yes um two quick questions an objection i always get from my
[3:36:02.880 --> 3:36:08.400]  friends and family is that they always look at everything not in the left right paradigm but
[3:36:08.400 --> 3:36:13.360]  more of the black and white paradigm so uh anytime i talk about the founding fathers
[3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:20.400]  how great they are how uh patriotic they were and uh troubling they were they always say well
[3:36:20.400 --> 3:36:28.400]  i don't listen to any white person i don't care i'm to obama he's black etc etc that's my first
[3:36:28.400 --> 3:36:33.520]  comment let me answer that quickly and and and simply the founders were in the time they were in
[3:36:33.520 --> 3:36:41.200]  230 240 years ago the real war going on 240 plus years ago they weren't perfect but the ideas
[3:36:41.200 --> 3:36:45.680]  that were put on paper led to all the freedom we've seen and slavery still going on in africa
[3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:52.640]  in many areas and in asia and we're now debt slaves to another system um certainly they
[3:36:52.640 --> 3:36:56.880]  weren't perfect and a lot of them fought with each other somewhere against slavery some were for it
[3:36:56.880 --> 3:37:02.880]  the point is it's those ideas of god given rights and our rights don't come from a government and
[3:37:04.240 --> 3:37:09.040]  then you understand obama took the restrictions off and doubled the funding for forced abortions
[3:37:09.040 --> 3:37:14.160]  in china and africa and infanticide and that more black babies are being aborted than are being born
[3:37:14.720 --> 3:37:19.520]  now they may put a sweet coding on that and obama may be six percent african six percent folks
[3:37:20.400 --> 3:37:25.520]  uh 44 percent arab half white it doesn't matter it's a stunt like sarah palin for president because
[3:37:25.520 --> 3:37:30.480]  she's a woman is a stunt give me a black guy give me a white guy give me a white woman a black woman
[3:37:30.480 --> 3:37:35.600]  a brown woman if they're a constitutionalist on forum you know deborah medina's got spanish
[3:37:35.600 --> 3:37:41.200]  spanish last name i i care less give me a green person if they give me freedom if they leave me
[3:37:41.200 --> 3:37:49.200]  alone now what's your second question uh... yes uh... do you know if the uh... economist john maynard
[3:37:49.200 --> 3:37:55.600]  tainz has any affiliation with the or Rothschild the rock of fellas he did economy that believes
[3:37:55.600 --> 3:38:00.800]  no government spending can get you out of it was funded by the british in the u.s total globalist
[3:38:00.800 --> 3:38:06.640]  wanted world government yes publicly okay and my our last comment is
[3:38:06.640 --> 3:38:11.920]  um i believe that we are making progress um i think that you know we are making movements but
[3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:17.760]  one thing that i i i'm a little bit um apprehensive about is that nobody's going to jail
[3:38:17.760 --> 3:38:23.120]  i mean even last week the rock child was on cnbc uh... you know the guy that was investigated
[3:38:23.120 --> 3:38:28.000]  but he's not going to jail he's not in handcuffs and i know i have to keep pointing that out
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:31.760]  look i'm out of time so we spent three minutes with that caller and it's great questions
[3:38:31.760 --> 3:38:35.760]  i want to try to get everybody else but before i do that i'm going to go ahead and cover
[3:38:36.960 --> 3:38:41.600]  gordon brown now okay because i said i do this today and i'm getting to where i'm trying to

[3:41:16.240 --> 3:41:22.720]  the point is that they had this secret meeting two weeks ago in australia where the leaders of
[3:41:22.720 --> 3:41:26.880]  the private 24 central banks and monetary authorities including us federal reserve and
[3:41:26.880 --> 3:41:31.680]  european central banks landed in city to meet tomorrow at a secret location so they make their
[3:41:31.680 --> 3:41:36.080]  decisions at these bilderberg group type meetings bilderberg's just one of the permanent meetings
[3:41:36.880 --> 3:41:41.440]  where obama met secretly in 2008 with hillary and that's now been admitted and that's in my film
[3:41:41.440 --> 3:41:48.880]  the obama deception and in this video clip listen to what he openly says about how they're creating
[3:41:48.880 --> 3:41:53.120]  a global constitution written by the banks see they don't care that they couldn't get people
[3:41:53.120 --> 3:41:59.040]  to sign the treaty at copenhagen to huge taxes on the third world first world it'll kill hundreds
[3:41:59.040 --> 3:42:03.760]  of millions of people every few years there's already 15 million kids starving to death each
[3:42:03.760 --> 3:42:07.440]  year another 20 million adults it'll at least double that each year you're talking about 100
[3:42:07.440 --> 3:42:14.320]  million in just four or five years extra that'll be dying this is so huge and they admit here's
[3:42:14.320 --> 3:42:18.080]  bill gates bill gates calls for population reduction in speech we have the video we played
[3:42:18.080 --> 3:42:23.440]  if we had time it's up on info wars dot com this they want a planetary regime as the head
[3:42:23.440 --> 3:42:30.400]  climatologist at nasa has said is bill gates has said as the white house science are john p
[3:42:30.400 --> 3:42:36.400]  holdren has said in eco science like where is that it's right over here they have pushed all this
[3:42:36.400 --> 3:42:41.920]  fact it's got a big stack of stuff on it get my lunch off of it but i'll just show you right now
[3:42:43.200 --> 3:42:47.200]  here it is eco science calling for all of this
[3:42:47.200 --> 3:42:54.160]  this is their real agenda when i tell you they want to give you jobs and energy they want to
[3:42:54.160 --> 3:42:59.760]  shut down your industry and they know every green job costs two jobs they know that they know that
[3:42:59.760 --> 3:43:05.680]  it but it brings control now here is gordon brown i'm going to be stopping it and commenting
[3:43:05.680 --> 3:43:09.600]  as he talks about this because they couldn't pass their greenhouse gas takeover and so they're
[3:43:09.600 --> 3:43:13.360]  saying we're going to have the bureaucracies through executive orders all over europe and the
[3:43:13.360 --> 3:43:18.080]  u.s and england and australian canada new zealand and we're going to tell the third world if you
[3:43:18.080 --> 3:43:22.560]  want your imf world bank money you've got to do this or we're going to shut off your food and water
[3:43:22.560 --> 3:43:26.640]  that the globalists now have gotten control of through debt and here he is saying we're just
[3:43:26.640 --> 3:43:32.080]  going to set up a global government a new world order of the banks here it is today i want us
[3:43:32.080 --> 3:43:38.560]  to imagine what people will see of us all a century from now people look back on the moments
[3:43:38.560 --> 3:43:47.120]  that are the turning points in world history 1789 1848 1945 1989 only in retrospect do people see
[3:43:47.120 --> 3:43:52.960]  the significance of the times that they are living through but in the last two years our world has
[3:43:52.960 --> 3:43:58.560]  been suffering not just an ordinary economic downturn but what will be remembered as the first
[3:43:58.560 --> 3:44:04.720]  crisis of globalization it's the first crisis of a world being totally transformed by the scale of
[3:44:04.720 --> 3:44:10.480]  global financial flows by the global sourcing of goods and by the speed of our scale and the
[3:44:11.200 --> 3:44:16.080]  so they promise you that nafta and gat and the world trade organization are going to create milk
[3:44:16.080 --> 3:44:20.720]  and honey their own internal documents 30 years ago said it was designed to deindustrialize
[3:44:20.720 --> 3:44:24.560]  and get us dependent that they would then tell us it was a service economy and then even take
[3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:29.600]  data away from us he then goes on as he just said that this crisis is going to bring in their new
[3:44:29.600 --> 3:44:34.240]  world order a crisis that goldman sacks and other internal documents that are in mainstream news
[3:44:34.240 --> 3:44:41.120]  document were done by design let's continue with gordon brown hope of globalization itself
[3:44:41.760 --> 3:44:47.040]  and it's a world of massive new opportunities that i want to talk about pause again they create the
[3:44:47.040 --> 3:44:54.560]  crisis they offer the solution their opportunities to make you become bankrupt so you beat yourself
[3:44:54.560 --> 3:44:58.800]  on the wreck of world government they don't care of it wrecks things that's the design they want
[3:44:58.800 --> 3:45:05.280]  feudalism continue but also as we found a world of massive new uncertainties and insecurities too
[3:45:06.240 --> 3:45:12.080]  what we have experienced is not just the usual inflation driven economic crisis such as we
[3:45:12.080 --> 3:45:18.400]  have seen in the past 50 years but a wholesale crisis the central banks in a coordinated fashion
[3:45:18.400 --> 3:45:25.040]  on record have caused the devaluation of global currencies in the west to stay at the same level
[3:45:25.040 --> 3:45:29.840]  so people don't notice it by one currency being worth more than another but here he is talking
[3:45:29.840 --> 3:45:35.360]  about instabilities they created by design this is the progenitor this is the spokesman for the
[3:45:35.360 --> 3:45:39.840]  people that engineered this and they brag that wall street and the big banks have gotten more power
[3:45:39.840 --> 3:45:44.320]  out of this continue that has gone right to the heart of the global financial system itself
[3:45:45.200 --> 3:45:51.600]  and so it is time for us as we reflect on these events to draw conclusions about the new framework
[3:45:51.600 --> 3:45:56.640]  and the new policies we do need problem-reaction solution to the stronger and fairer world economy
[3:45:56.640 --> 3:46:02.640]  that will need meet the needs of its citizens in this new global age quite simply without radical
[3:46:02.640 --> 3:46:08.320]  change we will not be able to emerge from the crisis into a stronger, fairer, more stable future
[3:46:09.280 --> 3:46:14.320]  so as they wreck things as they have shock therapy as they shut down economies by design as they wreck
[3:46:14.320 --> 3:46:19.840]  Greece and Spain and Portugal and the United States and Iceland by design and get fabulously
[3:46:19.840 --> 3:46:24.480]  wealthy and write articles about how they're screwing us and laugh at us he's got a new solution
[3:46:24.480 --> 3:46:32.320]  the bankers world covenant their world constitution where they run things as the Copenhagen treaty
[3:46:32.320 --> 3:46:38.240]  said you will pay your taxes to the private banks on everything you do with this planetary skin of
[3:46:38.240 --> 3:46:45.040]  surveillance here it is so here are my proposals for discussion today get ready i believe first
[3:46:45.040 --> 3:46:49.680]  of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system
[3:46:51.200 --> 3:46:55.920]  secondly i believe that each country needs national growth and jobs strategies
[3:46:55.920 --> 3:47:02.240]  that are founded on science innovation and skills for the future okay so a global government rule a
[3:47:02.240 --> 3:47:07.760]  constitution a treaty that you sign on to and wave your rights and then green jobs which aren't green
[3:47:07.760 --> 3:47:13.680]  which all the public largesse and money that you've paid in taxes is then given to al gore
[3:47:13.680 --> 3:47:18.240]  barack obama the Rothschilds the Rockefellers that openly own the carbon trading and the windmill
[3:47:18.240 --> 3:47:22.320]  companies and all the rest of it and then they do home inspections and make you use the company
[3:47:22.320 --> 3:47:26.880]  they want to quote fix your house you've got to buy the light bulbs they have a patent on and the
[3:47:26.880 --> 3:47:32.480]  toilet they have a patent on and the refrigerant they have a patent on and they get decide what
[3:47:32.480 --> 3:47:37.680]  factory stays open what gets shut down down to even what car dealerships allow to stay open continue
[3:47:37.680 --> 3:47:44.800]  it but also and this is my key point growth for each of us will be lower and therefore
[3:47:44.800 --> 3:47:51.120]  low growth will affect us all unless there is a strategy for global growth agree between the g20
[3:47:51.840 --> 3:47:58.880]  another line another line they don't want growth in the united nations biological diversity assessment
[3:47:58.880 --> 3:48:07.840]  96 in the 1973 state department random 200 in all their statements but see that's the big lie is
[3:48:07.840 --> 3:48:15.680]  that this will give you growth continue 20 countries and beyond thirdly i believe that as we developed
[3:48:15.680 --> 3:48:21.120]  the skill jobs that are going to be necessary for the future we should see social mobility as the
[3:48:21.120 --> 3:48:26.480]  modern route to social justice and we should do buys together the radical measures that will
[3:48:26.480 --> 3:48:32.720]  massively accelerate the rate of social mobility in our societies i did pause that means wealth
[3:48:32.720 --> 3:48:37.920]  redistribution robbing the middle class giving a tiny pittance to the poor after you've already
[3:48:37.920 --> 3:48:43.040]  taken their jobs and then transferring the lion's share of it to offshore banks who claim they're
[3:48:43.040 --> 3:48:46.800]  going to give it to the third world the third world actually saw the treaty they had to make
[3:48:46.800 --> 3:48:53.040]  right at double the cuts in carbon emissions that the first world did so more lies more deception
[3:48:53.040 --> 3:48:58.800]  oh it's liberal that's why we're no radical redistribution of wealth continue and fourth
[3:48:58.800 --> 3:49:04.160]  with global asia globalization we have a unique chance to recognize our global interdependence
[3:49:04.160 --> 3:49:10.160]  of citizens and work towards a truly global society and that is a world free from climate
[3:49:10.160 --> 3:49:15.680]  change catastrophe it's a world free from terrorism and a world where we tackle poverty disease
[3:49:15.680 --> 3:49:21.280]  illiteracy and inequality so we're a stage in terror where we've got a hoax about the polar
[3:49:21.280 --> 3:49:25.680]  bear is all dying and sea levels rising which they admit is a fraud and temperatures rising
[3:49:25.680 --> 3:49:31.280]  which is a fraud as if that's even bad and we're going to do this in global interdependence under
[3:49:31.280 --> 3:49:35.120]  this global constitution run by the banks and now he talks about a new world order go ahead
[3:49:35.840 --> 3:49:41.440]  together i think these proposals are the modern progressive way of achieving our historic goals
[3:49:41.440 --> 3:49:50.000]  of economic progress social justice environmental care there there must be a longer clip because
[3:49:50.000 --> 3:49:53.520]  or it must be at the first because he says new world order in the clip i sent you guys
[3:49:55.200 --> 3:49:59.840]  yeah yeah watch watch the front of it because i know you guys started it later in the clip
[3:49:59.840 --> 3:50:03.280]  i mean the name of the clip is gordon brown calls for new world order i mean there's countless
[3:50:03.280 --> 3:50:10.080]  clips that's the that's the part i really want to play but but but there he is there he is calling

[3:50:19.760 --> 3:50:23.440]  he says new world order several times in that speech if not pull up another youtube of him
[3:50:23.440 --> 3:50:27.280]  calling for new world order and saying we use this crisis for a new world order it's important to

[3:53:36.880 --> 3:53:42.640]  that point when we read her in the ap saying it doesn't sound like him and then separately she's
[3:53:42.640 --> 3:53:47.520]  saying if he did do it uh she thinks he's he's a hero so yes we covered that i appreciate
