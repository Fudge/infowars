[00:00.000 --> 00:13.880]  The massive national transformation towards energy independence that America finally achieved
[00:13.880 --> 00:19.560]  in 2020, which would have shifted America's first exceptionalism into overdrive, is being
[00:19.560 --> 00:20.560]  dismantled.
[00:20.560 --> 00:26.840]  Well, I was introduced as the former governor of Michigan, but actually I'm a scientist.
[00:26.840 --> 00:30.960]  You've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation.
[00:30.960 --> 00:37.280]  In fact, if you look just at the upper northern states in the west, they could do geothermal
[00:37.280 --> 00:42.040]  or you could look at Texas and say we could leave the nation in the solutions to smart
[00:42.040 --> 00:48.520]  grid in the Middle Eastern states, which have access to forests and to agricultural waste.
[00:48.520 --> 00:51.600]  They might say we're going to leave the nation in biofuels.
[00:51.600 --> 00:56.480]  At the Department of Energy, we have the solutions to tackle our climate emergency.
[00:56.480 --> 01:02.000]  This morning, the cyber attack on the nation's largest fuel pipeline now leading to gas shortages
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.160]  as multiple states face dwindling supply.
[01:05.160 --> 01:08.920]  So you still don't have the technical information you need to be able to be responsive and to
[01:08.920 --> 01:12.320]  provide support to critical infrastructure?
[01:12.320 --> 01:13.320]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:13.320 --> 01:17.920]  Yes, but that is not surprising given that it's, you know, they've only been working
[01:17.920 --> 01:23.400]  on the incident response since over the weekend, and it's fairly early.
[01:23.400 --> 01:28.040]  We have had historically good relationship with both Colonial as well as the cybersecurity
[01:28.040 --> 01:30.320]  firms that are working on their behalf.
[01:30.320 --> 01:36.720]  Up until 2020, the United States had imported more petroleum than it had exported.
[01:36.720 --> 01:38.920]  I've been in two gas lines already.
[01:38.920 --> 01:39.920]  This morning?
[01:39.920 --> 01:40.920]  This morning.
[01:40.920 --> 01:41.920]  How long did you wait for the first one?
[01:41.920 --> 01:47.240]  In both lines, over an hour, and I'm out of gas, dead out.
[01:47.240 --> 01:52.720]  Baby boomers and older generations remember the double whammy oil crisis of 1973 and
[01:52.720 --> 01:54.000]  1979.
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.960]  It was a wake-up call that America's dependence on foreign oil meant our national security
[01:58.960 --> 02:04.240]  wasn't all it was cracked up to be and that the bounty of American oil had to be tapped.
[02:04.240 --> 02:09.120]  America is now the largest, the world's largest oil and gas producer, which was unimaginable
[02:09.120 --> 02:10.720]  just a few short years ago.
[02:10.720 --> 02:15.120]  Now the power is being turned off under the installed and illegitimate New World Order
[02:15.120 --> 02:16.640]  stooge Joe Biden.
[02:16.640 --> 02:20.320]  I'm announcing my plan for clean energy revolution.
[02:20.320 --> 02:26.480]  As the AAA said, prices were heading towards their highest level since 2014 and emergencies
[02:26.480 --> 02:29.360]  are declared in at least 18 states.
[02:29.360 --> 02:35.000]  But this time, it isn't Saudi Arabia quadrupling the price of a barrel of oil due to support
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.800]  over the Yom Kippur War.
[02:36.800 --> 02:41.040]  This time, it's a combination of intentional, horrible leadership.
[02:41.040 --> 02:46.520]  Biden's decision to revoke a permit for Keystone XL will certainly be a topic of discussion.
[02:46.520 --> 02:51.120]  It marks the end of a saga spanning more than 12 years over the pipeline meant to carry
[02:51.120 --> 02:54.120]  Canadian crude to the United States.
[02:54.120 --> 02:55.120]  Cyber attacks.
[02:55.120 --> 03:01.160]  Russian cyber hackers are going to ruin our gasoline, our transportation and our electricity
[03:01.160 --> 03:02.160]  grid.
[03:02.160 --> 03:08.480]  This is a terrible position for Biden to be in and so far he and his folks have said
[03:08.480 --> 03:09.480]  nothing.
[03:09.480 --> 03:17.600]  Even with the turning on of the pipeline system, they still may feel a supply crunch.
[03:17.600 --> 03:22.040]  And the United Nations Agenda 2030 with a motive bigger than Dallas.
[03:22.040 --> 03:26.440]  It is the inventory and control plan.
[03:26.440 --> 03:33.480]  Inventory and control of all land, all water, all minerals, all plants, all animals, all
[03:33.480 --> 03:41.200]  construction, all means of production, all food, all energy, all information and all
[03:41.200 --> 03:43.200]  human beings in the world.
[03:43.200 --> 03:48.400]  Do you think that American public is going to say, we don't want to drilling off fuel
[03:48.400 --> 03:49.400]  anymore?
[03:49.400 --> 03:56.000]  If Americans say that, you are going to be accepting six to eight dollars per gallon
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.600]  at the gas pump as an alternate in the near future.
[04:01.600 --> 04:07.920]  And this is the move to nationalize the oil companies that we're now going to see from
[04:07.920 --> 04:14.640]  this and the head of the Department of Transportation two months ago saying we are officially anti-car
[04:14.640 --> 04:17.160]  and we're going to make you use buses and trains.
[04:17.160 --> 04:18.680]  So this is their dream.
[04:18.680 --> 04:24.480]  In the year 2015, the world agreed on the ambitious, inclusive and universal sustainable
[04:24.480 --> 04:28.920]  development goals, making a commitment to leave no one behind.
[04:28.920 --> 04:31.480]  It is so decided.
[04:31.480 --> 04:36.840]  As prices continue to skyrocket, the summer of 2021 is shaping up to potentially be a
[04:36.840 --> 04:39.320]  food, energy and right as hell on earth.
[04:39.320 --> 04:45.520]  John Bown reporting.
[04:45.520 --> 04:50.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, May 12th, the year is 2021.
[04:50.400 --> 04:52.520]  All hell is breaking loose.
[04:52.520 --> 04:53.920]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[04:53.920 --> 04:55.920]  We got some incredible gas coming up today.
[04:55.920 --> 05:00.360]  We'll tell you all about it when we launch the main transmission in 60 seconds.
[05:00.360 --> 05:03.040]  Alex Jones here with some really good news.
[05:03.040 --> 05:06.480]  Four of our best selling products are back in stock.
[05:06.480 --> 05:11.240]  Four of these bad boys that will enrich your life and of course, funding it forward.
[05:11.240 --> 05:16.520]  Bodies ultimate turmeric formula, alpha power for your stamina, libido energy, prostate
[05:16.520 --> 05:20.400]  guard with the soft palm metal and a bunch of key vitamins and minerals for your immune
[05:20.400 --> 05:21.400]  system.
[05:21.400 --> 05:25.960]  And of course, vaso beets, concentrated beef extract, create nitrous oxide in your blood
[05:25.960 --> 05:30.960]  that's essential for your heart and for your lungs and especially for your liver.
[05:30.960 --> 05:34.480]  And this is great because with all the shutdowns and the lockdowns, it's been hard to get these
[05:34.480 --> 05:38.040]  products and they're finally back in and they're critical to funding our operation, plus
[05:38.040 --> 05:39.040]  they're great products.
[05:39.040 --> 05:40.040]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[05:40.040 --> 05:45.200]  Go to infowarstore.com today and get your info wars live and products while you still
[05:45.200 --> 05:46.200]  can.
[05:46.200 --> 05:51.240]  Vaso beets, prostate guard, alpha power, and of course, bodies all back at stock now.
[05:51.240 --> 06:17.440]  Go to infowarstore.com from the front lines of the Information
[06:17.440 --> 06:38.000]  War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:38.000 --> 06:45.280]  All right, my friends, we're going to have quite the broadcast today.
[06:45.280 --> 06:54.840]  I don't just have all the anecdotal evidence that they're carrying out a depopulation operation
[06:54.840 --> 06:57.720]  against humanity.
[06:57.720 --> 07:00.000]  I have the documents.
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.520]  I have all the proof.
[07:01.520 --> 07:08.000]  And in fact, right as I was going live here, I was scrambling over here for a particular
[07:08.000 --> 07:16.400]  document that is an original, that is from the local hospital here in Austin, and I've
[07:16.400 --> 07:25.920]  been authorized to show you all of this, a 45-year-old man, a coach in great health,
[07:25.920 --> 07:43.760]  the vaccine, the Pfizer, and five days after he took it, he collapsed and had a stroke.
[07:43.760 --> 07:47.440]  And they say they don't know why that happened.
[07:47.440 --> 07:56.320]  So that is coming up on the transmission today.
[07:56.320 --> 08:01.400]  Guys, I actually had the copy of the Pfizer card here, and I don't know how in the ensuing
[08:01.400 --> 08:08.040]  craziness in here, before I went live, I lost it, but I did just find it again.
[08:08.040 --> 08:13.160]  And a large part of my problems are I am over-preparing for these shows for hours and hours and hours
[08:13.160 --> 08:17.200]  every day, and then I just get in here, and I'm totally exhausted after I've already read
[08:17.200 --> 08:18.200]  all this.
[08:18.200 --> 08:23.360]  I'm not complaining, I'm just getting to a point where I've got to have 10 minutes
[08:23.360 --> 08:29.600]  of meditation before I go on, because I'm frantically talking to people and doing things
[08:29.600 --> 08:36.080]  right up until the second I go live, and it's not the crew's fault, but I'm just psychoanalyzing
[08:36.080 --> 08:37.080]  here.
[08:37.080 --> 08:38.080]  It's got to stop.
[08:38.080 --> 08:43.760]  I'm going to go to rebroadcast for a while, then I'm going to come back, and I'm going
[08:43.760 --> 08:50.120]  to reset, I'm going to start the official show, because I just need that focus, like
[08:50.120 --> 08:55.680]  I had before the show started, where I'm really ready to cover this, because the magnitude
[08:55.680 --> 09:01.880]  of the information is just too incredible, it's too intense, and people have to really
[09:01.880 --> 09:03.480]  soak this in, understand it.
[09:03.480 --> 09:07.280]  If we have an overhead shot, please, let me just show listeners this.
[09:07.280 --> 09:17.160]  This is COVID-19 vaccination record card, and this is the coach that lives here in Austin,
[09:17.160 --> 09:26.800]  whose niece works here, she's a young lady, in her early 20s, and he took the shot, I
[09:26.800 --> 09:30.720]  got his medical records, and had a stroke.
[09:30.720 --> 09:35.360]  He just recently had a physical before this happened, it was an excellent bill of health,
[09:35.360 --> 09:47.320]  35 years old, and here's his medical records right here, so we're going to be showing you
[09:47.320 --> 09:53.240]  all of that coming up the start of the next hour, and you have to understand, I know other
[09:53.240 --> 09:57.520]  people in this office who've had family have strokes and heart attacks, but they don't
[09:57.520 --> 10:04.560]  want to come on air, and my grandmother got polio from the polio shot, they told her,
[10:04.560 --> 10:12.720]  and so that's why I get angry, that's why I get upset, and that's why I say things like
[10:12.720 --> 10:17.360]  I said yesterday that ended up all over the news, headline, Alex Jones calls for Bill
[10:17.360 --> 10:26.240]  Gates to be tried and put to death over the pandemic, well, that's what would have happened
[10:26.240 --> 10:32.000]  to Joseph Mingola doing illegal experimentation, I mean, just because he got Hitler to sign
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.200]  off on it didn't mean it was okay, and I've got a top lawyer that wrote the U.S. biological
[10:36.200 --> 10:43.080]  weapons law that has a death penalty in it, and who was a former top UN war crimes prosecutor
[10:43.080 --> 10:47.920]  against Slobodan Milozovic and others, joining us in the fourth hour I'll be hosting, Dr.
[10:47.920 --> 10:53.120]  Francis Boyle will give you his take on that, but I don't wish any violence against Bill
[10:53.120 --> 11:02.440]  Gates, hanging out in the Indian Springs, California right now, I don't wish any violence
[11:02.440 --> 11:11.000]  against Fauci, any of them, that would turn them into martyrs, I want criminal investigations,
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.640]  we have done all the investigating, we know the facts, and I want them brought to justice,
[11:16.640 --> 11:23.120]  I want them on trial, and if they're found not guilty, well, they can sue me for defamation
[11:23.120 --> 11:26.960]  then, and I'll be quite happy to face that, but that's not going to happen, we have their
[11:26.960 --> 11:32.160]  own project heads admitting that this was a weaponized virus that they made it, we have
[11:32.160 --> 11:35.360]  them admitting they want to depopulate the earth, we have them trying to block people
[11:35.360 --> 11:39.560]  getting therapeutics, we have big tech that controls censoring people, exposing what's
[11:39.560 --> 11:43.200]  happening, and you have Bill Gates saying he wants to depopulate the earth, and then
[11:43.200 --> 11:48.920]  you've got Fauci and Gates both invested in all the major vaccines that the US has produced,
[11:48.920 --> 11:54.440]  and you've got Fauci famously saying Trump will be challenged in his first term by a
[11:54.440 --> 12:00.320]  pandemic, I mean, my God, it's all hiding in plain view, and you've just got to call
[12:00.320 --> 12:07.400]  out the imper's new clothes, let's do this, let's say our Greg Reese's report that I
[12:07.400 --> 12:13.240]  read yesterday, it's so important, it should air again, evidence of shedding and death
[12:13.240 --> 12:18.440]  from the vaccines, we're going to air that here in just a moment, and then we are going
[12:18.440 --> 12:22.640]  to come back and I'm going to hit the main news, the pipeline, all the big guess we've
[12:22.640 --> 12:27.800]  got, everything that's happening today, it's all coming up straight ahead, but here is
[12:27.800 --> 12:56.120]  that Greg Reese report.
[12:56.120 --> 13:03.440]  Another bald faced big pharma fraud admitted to in their own fine print, they've gotten
[13:03.440 --> 13:11.040]  away with falsifying the numbers before, to fake a swine flu pandemic, and it influence
[13:11.040 --> 13:19.200]  a scare, both to sell billions of dollars worth of needless, dangerous vaccines to a
[13:19.200 --> 13:28.200]  dumbed down brainwashed public, is it about eugenics, yes, eugenics 101 is to kill off
[13:28.200 --> 13:35.360]  the sick and elderly, is it about money, of course, in the US alone, based on two shots
[13:35.360 --> 13:42.600]  per person, the vaccine manufacturers are making over $13 billion a year, paid for by
[13:42.600 --> 13:49.640]  taxpayer dollars, the manufacturers have no liability, they cannot be held accountable
[13:49.640 --> 13:55.960]  for any deaths or injury, they will only profit more by selling drugs to everyone that they've
[13:55.960 --> 14:04.240]  injured with their experimental vaccines, is it a big experiment, absolutely, and there
[14:04.240 --> 14:11.240]  is no shortage of suckers and fools, millions are willingly lining up for the mystery injection,
[14:11.240 --> 14:19.000]  proudly boasting their compliance and ignorance for all the world to see on social media,
[14:19.000 --> 14:25.320]  but is it all voluntary, in recent years, big pharma has been pushing for vaccines to
[14:25.320 --> 14:32.520]  self spread to non vaccinated individuals, they claim to already have this technology
[14:32.520 --> 14:38.520]  and have discussed using it on the public covertly, one application considered was an
[14:38.520 --> 14:46.640]  anti fertility vaccine that could be administered to human women without their knowledge, a
[14:46.640 --> 14:51.280]  recent Pfizer study describes the potential for their COVID vaccine to cause adverse
[14:51.280 --> 14:59.240]  effects in pregnant women who come into close contact with recently vaccinated individuals,
[14:59.240 --> 15:04.800]  and we have seen thousands of women reporting abnormal menstrual cycles, miscarriages and
[15:04.800 --> 15:13.760]  blood clots after coming into contact with the vaccinated, former chief science officer
[15:13.760 --> 15:21.360]  for Pfizer said that he thinks vaccines will be used for mass depopulation, if this is
[15:21.360 --> 15:28.120]  being done to us deliberately, obviously we wouldn't be told, Bill Gates doesn't think
[15:28.120 --> 15:32.400]  you deserve to know what's in the vaccine, there's been some speculation that the changing
[15:32.400 --> 15:39.760]  intellectual property rules and allowing these vaccines, as you say, the recipe for these
[15:39.760 --> 15:46.400]  vaccines to be shared would be helpful, and do you think that would be helpful, no, and
[15:46.400 --> 16:03.440]  the inserts are dubiously left blank on purpose, for info wars dot com, this is Greg Rees.
[16:03.440 --> 16:17.740]  And
[16:17.740 --> 16:23.700]  its police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media
[16:23.700 --> 16:29.260]  or industry. People are really, really away from the establishment. They don't want to
[16:29.260 --> 16:33.780]  go along with the globalists, but they're scared. They're looking for leadership. Well,
[16:33.780 --> 16:38.780]  that's where M4 comes in. You fund us. You support M4SWARE.com. You get rape policy
[16:38.780 --> 16:43.900]  at the same time. We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what
[16:43.900 --> 16:48.700]  the globalists is targeting for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take
[16:48.700 --> 16:54.860]  the heat. That's our job. So please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we
[16:54.860 --> 16:58.900]  can meet the shock groups and the information war. Fund us at M4SWARE.com.
[16:58.900 --> 17:03.740]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[17:03.740 --> 17:04.740]  Hello. Can you hear me?
[17:04.740 --> 17:05.740]  I'm sure cancer. Thank you.
[17:05.740 --> 17:11.380]  Hey, Alex. Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to
[17:11.380 --> 17:14.180]  be talking right now. Hey, man. Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[17:14.180 --> 17:19.500]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver, and two
[17:19.500 --> 17:25.060]  before us have changed the way I drive. Me and my brothers have drive. There's a couple
[17:25.060 --> 17:32.620]  of us. We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans. We used to be on Monster and Red Bull
[17:32.620 --> 17:36.860]  and Rolla, and I have lost weight because I started drinking all that sugar, and I just
[17:36.860 --> 17:37.860]  want to thank you for that, man.
[17:37.860 --> 17:42.660]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder
[17:42.660 --> 17:46.300]  there is, so this was designed on one of the top guys in the country. You didn't want
[17:46.300 --> 17:49.460]  his name on it because, obviously, the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for
[17:49.460 --> 17:53.340]  this formulation just for the design of it, and we believe it is the best, strongest, but
[17:53.340 --> 17:57.260]  healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means
[17:57.260 --> 18:02.980]  a lot to me. Thank you to all your truck drivers. We love you.
[18:02.980 --> 18:09.980]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:32.980 --> 18:50.180]  Well, it looks like something on a Star Wars or Battle Star Galactica, but it's the Israeli
[18:50.180 --> 18:56.300]  Iron Dome shooting down rockets coming in out of the Gaza Strip, and a lot of listeners
[18:56.300 --> 19:02.100]  ask me, why aren't you covering this more? Well, maybe a few dozen people have died.
[19:02.100 --> 19:08.500]  Some buildings have been blown up. Palestinians, Arabs and Jews killing each other has been
[19:08.500 --> 19:12.860]  going on for three, four thousand years before they were even Muslims. It's been going on
[19:12.860 --> 19:17.140]  about five thousand years total. You can read all about it in the Bible. You can read all
[19:17.140 --> 19:21.740]  about it in the Roman histories. You can read all about it in the New Testament, so to me,
[19:21.740 --> 19:26.820]  this is just an ongoing situation. You have billions of people being given experimental
[19:26.820 --> 19:32.180]  gene therapy shots, whether they're Palestinians or whether they're Germans or whether they're
[19:32.180 --> 19:37.940]  Jews or whether they're Americans. It's happening. The Chinese and the Indians aren't taking
[19:37.940 --> 19:43.060]  the mRNA. Oh no, they say it's not safe, but we're told to take it and we're told we're
[19:43.060 --> 19:50.620]  bad if we don't submit to it, and we're told we need to be bullied and shunned into submission.
[19:50.620 --> 19:54.900]  Then everyone I talked to has friends and family that have died or had strokes or heart
[19:54.900 --> 20:02.100]  attacks right after they took the shot, including 25-year-old women, 45-year-old men, and I can
[20:02.100 --> 20:06.740]  read about 15-year-old young men dying, totally healthy, ever taking the shot, a heart attack,
[20:06.740 --> 20:12.700]  and then I can read the literature that Fauci funded in 2012, University of Texas, level
[20:12.700 --> 20:22.900]  four bio weapons lab, where they said, do not give coronavirus vaccines, COVID vaccines,
[20:22.900 --> 20:28.500]  cause a COVID in that family because it will cause heart attacks, it will cause blood clots,
[20:28.500 --> 20:35.140]  it will cause holes to be eaten in the lungs and the arteries. You can go read that report,
[20:35.140 --> 20:39.620]  and so see people, oh, look the dome of the rock, there's a fire, oh look, the Israelis
[20:39.620 --> 20:46.340]  bombed a building, oh look, the Muslims shot 100 rockets, and it looks like a fireworks
[20:46.340 --> 20:51.580]  display, and there's some burning buildings, and it's some war, and I'm sad it's happening,
[20:51.580 --> 21:01.100]  but ancient tribal warfare is not even on the scale of the UN world government trying
[21:01.100 --> 21:07.140]  to forcibly inoculate us, and I have a local coach on in the second hour who just got this
[21:07.140 --> 21:15.980]  physical, 45-years-old, got the second Moderna, second Pfizer, and it almost killed him, had
[21:15.980 --> 21:20.820]  a stroke. This is a real person, I have medical records right here, and of course they say
[21:20.820 --> 21:26.140]  they don't know what caused it, so I'm going to rattle snake by shit, again, I don't know
[21:26.140 --> 21:29.420]  why my legs swole up and fell off, I don't know why, I mean, I don't know why a black
[21:29.420 --> 21:33.500]  widow bit me on the hand, and I got a big rattle in my hand, then you go to the doctor,
[21:33.500 --> 21:37.820]  we don't know if the black widow did that, they know it's the vaccine, but in many cases
[21:37.820 --> 21:43.180]  the doctors are now saying, yes, this person's organs liquefied, this 36-year-old mother
[21:43.180 --> 21:50.780]  that works in the hospital, two days after she took the Pfizer second round, and it's
[21:50.780 --> 21:56.500]  exactly what happened in the rat studies, and in the pig studies, and in the guinea pig
[21:56.500 --> 22:07.580]  studies, and in the pig studies, that's why they said, oh, we're not doing studies on
[22:07.580 --> 22:11.020]  animals, we're skipping right to humans, and I see this lie all over the news, all over
[22:11.020 --> 22:18.940]  Twitter, everywhere, it's, the FDA has approved these shots as safe and effective, it did
[22:18.940 --> 22:23.780]  no such thing, the inserts are blank, it says there's no information, they won't say what's
[22:23.780 --> 22:29.820]  in it, it's a secret, but they told us some of it, and it creates an autoimmune response
[22:29.820 --> 22:34.660]  to the spike protein that just so happens to be in your heart, and your lungs, and your
[22:34.660 --> 22:39.980]  brain, and your body attacks it, and you have a crippling heart attack or a stroke, or you
[22:39.980 --> 22:43.900]  can die, and then it's just this background noise of all the increased strokes and heart
[22:43.900 --> 22:49.860]  attacks now in young people, and we just muddle on through life and just get used to it, this
[22:49.860 --> 22:55.700]  person's paralyzed, this person has an autoimmune response, this woman has tumors all over her
[22:55.700 --> 23:01.100]  breast and all over her uterus, and they tell you, oh, the shots do create tumors, but doctors,
[23:01.100 --> 23:05.500]  if they just have the shot for six months, don't operate, don't call it cancer for six
[23:05.500 --> 23:11.740]  months, and then they're going and getting biopsies, and it's malignant, it's the type
[23:11.740 --> 23:19.100]  that kills you, it's not benign, and it's in the news, I mean, they're confirming, it causes
[23:19.100 --> 23:25.980]  tumors in your breast and in your uterus, and it's giving men tumors in their stomachs,
[23:25.980 --> 23:31.020]  and they admit it and say, well, that's just a side effect, but doctors, that was the headline
[23:31.020 --> 23:36.960]  CBS News a month ago, if you see the tumors, the CDC says, they're not a problem, just
[23:36.960 --> 23:42.860]  ignore them for six months after a shot, and then by then you're going to have the malignancy
[23:42.860 --> 23:47.420]  growing, and we don't know why the malignancy grew and spread to your lungs and spread to
[23:47.420 --> 23:59.460]  your bones and spread to your brain, I can walk through this building, and almost everyone
[23:59.460 --> 24:03.460]  that works here has family that works in a nursing home or family that's a firefighter
[24:03.460 --> 24:09.380]  or family that's got a mother or a father or a brother or an uncle who's either dead
[24:09.380 --> 24:15.700]  or had a heart attack or a stroke, but I've got one long lady here who's 45-year-old
[24:15.700 --> 24:20.500]  uncle is willing to come on the show.
[24:20.500 --> 24:26.900]  I can walk right into a room and bring you somebody in here whose child died from a vaccine,
[24:26.900 --> 24:30.380]  and they told him the vaccine killed him, and I can get on the phone and call one of
[24:30.380 --> 24:33.540]  the employees that's not here today and say to her, what happened to your two-year-old
[24:33.540 --> 24:36.420]  when you were in the Army, and they gave him that round of shots, and they said the vaccine
[24:36.420 --> 24:37.420]  killed him.
[24:37.420 --> 24:43.380]  I can go anywhere I want and find you the death and the disease and the pain, and we're
[24:43.380 --> 24:49.420]  just supposed to sit here and take it from Bill Gates and Fauci, who ran the lab, produced
[24:49.420 --> 24:55.700]  the operation, set it all up, covered it up, and then owned the big vaccine companies and
[24:55.700 --> 25:01.420]  they're making incredible profits, all of its conflicts of interest.
[25:01.420 --> 25:09.500]  We've got it all, ladies and gentlemen, we've got it all, and it goes on and on and on and
[25:09.500 --> 25:10.500]  on.
[25:10.500 --> 25:16.220]  I mean, I had a stack yesterday of people that died just recently.
[25:16.220 --> 25:21.820]  A nine-year-old boy dies of blood clots three days after a 62-year-old grandmother dies
[25:21.820 --> 25:22.820]  a week after.
[25:22.820 --> 25:28.740]  I mean, just every day you stack, stack, stack, stack, stack, stack, stack, stack, stack,
[25:28.740 --> 25:30.540]  and that's just the ones you hear about.
[25:30.540 --> 25:36.060]  Then we open the phones up and medical doctor calls and says, yeah, I serve as four nursing
[25:36.060 --> 25:40.540]  homes and they're losing about 10% of the people after they take the shot within two
[25:40.540 --> 25:44.300]  weeks and that's way more than normal would be dying of these nursing homes and it's all
[25:44.300 --> 25:45.300]  the same.
[25:45.300 --> 25:46.300]  They never get out of bed again.
[25:46.300 --> 25:51.380]  They have convulsions or they have heart attacks or strokes.
[25:51.380 --> 25:56.220]  And now they've approved it for 12-year-olds and next month they're going to start with
[25:56.220 --> 25:57.220]  babies.
[25:57.220 --> 26:01.500]  They've already done the trials with babies and a bunch of babies died, but they said
[26:01.500 --> 26:06.300]  that's not related that the baby died.
[26:06.300 --> 26:10.460]  That's not connected to this in any way, so said CNN.
[26:10.460 --> 26:17.260]  All right, look, I'm going to control myself because I got a lot of news here and we come
[26:17.260 --> 26:26.860]  back, I'm going to hit the pipeline shutdown and what's really behind it, and did you know,
[26:26.860 --> 26:37.500]  did everybody know that Biden shut down a third pipeline in the United States?
[26:37.500 --> 26:42.620]  I mean, he shut down Keystone with an order and we know he's obviously behind the colonial,
[26:42.620 --> 26:45.620]  told the stabilization program training you to have, the stabilization told you it was
[26:45.620 --> 26:49.420]  coming, power outages, pipelines out, told you a few months ago when they stole the electricity
[26:49.420 --> 26:53.380]  down, look for power outages and pipelines being off and this is a planet, they're all
[26:53.380 --> 26:54.380]  over the world.
[26:54.380 --> 26:55.380]  I'll explain to you when we come back.
[26:55.380 --> 26:56.380]  But they shut another one down in Michigan.
[26:56.380 --> 26:58.740]  I'll tell you about that when we come back.
[26:58.740 --> 27:01.220]  The world is awakening.
[27:01.220 --> 27:04.740]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[27:04.740 --> 27:10.100]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral
[27:10.100 --> 27:17.100]  commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome and so even though
[27:17.100 --> 27:21.700]  it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out of the
[27:21.700 --> 27:25.820]  open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[27:25.820 --> 27:28.940]  We have forced them out in the open.
[27:28.940 --> 27:33.780]  So as bad as these times are, a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity
[27:33.780 --> 27:34.780]  is winning.
[27:34.780 --> 27:39.940]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[27:39.940 --> 27:41.380]  That is invincible.
[27:41.380 --> 27:44.660]  That is ethereal, timeless and unstoppable.
[27:44.660 --> 27:49.580]  So don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action
[27:49.580 --> 27:53.500]  against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alan Jones and my crew
[27:53.500 --> 27:54.500]  to you.
[27:54.500 --> 27:59.720]  We will never back down from the globalists and we will never surrender.
[27:59.720 --> 28:08.220]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at
[28:08.220 --> 28:11.260]  surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil.
[28:11.260 --> 28:12.500]  We've got the best out there.
[28:12.500 --> 28:17.940]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[28:17.940 --> 28:20.940]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does and it costs us even more to
[28:20.940 --> 28:23.940]  put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[28:23.940 --> 28:25.540]  So this is also clean fish oil.
[28:25.540 --> 28:28.940]  It's been sold out for months but it's back in stock 50% off.
[28:28.940 --> 28:30.380]  Grill oil is set to sell out.
[28:30.380 --> 28:32.020]  It's amazing as well.
[28:32.020 --> 28:38.020]  It's at 25% off but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.
[28:38.020 --> 28:43.100]  Get your fish oil back in stock at infowarstore.com and when I forget to take it, I really feel
[28:43.100 --> 28:44.100]  it.

[28:46.660 --> 28:47.660]  amazing.
[28:47.660 --> 28:48.660]  The listeners thought I was joking.
[28:48.660 --> 28:50.780]  You've tried it out and most of you have been blown away.
[28:50.780 --> 28:56.300]  Get your fish oil today at infowarstore.com, ultimate fish oil, infowarstore.com, ultimate
[28:56.300 --> 28:59.620]  fish oil, infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com.
[28:59.620 --> 29:05.100]  I'm driving home at 7 o'clock at night on Monday night to see my family and I just remember
[29:05.100 --> 29:09.620]  there's only two days left for our wonderful listeners to get incredibly high quality,
[29:09.620 --> 29:14.500]  storeable food at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere at preparewithalix.com.
[29:14.500 --> 29:19.380]  These are 20, 20 prices for a limited time for our listeners and then the price isn't
[29:19.380 --> 29:21.980]  just going to go back to regular, it's going to have to go up.
[29:21.980 --> 29:25.940]  Everybody else has already raised prices way more than my Patreon.
[29:25.940 --> 29:31.580]  We have their entire spectrum and catalog at infowarstore.com, preparewithalix.com.
[29:31.580 --> 29:37.620]  We get an additional 10% off on three months, six months, your supplies and everything else
[29:37.620 --> 29:39.020]  on the site.
[29:39.020 --> 29:41.020]  Preparewithalix.com.
[29:41.020 --> 29:44.860]  I would take advantage of this with what's happening and food price increases around
[29:44.860 --> 29:45.860]  the world.
[29:45.860 --> 29:49.940]  I predict that by the fall you're going to see major shortages, you're going to see
[29:49.940 --> 29:51.580]  huge price increases.
[29:51.580 --> 29:55.540]  I think it's a smart bet right now to get high quality, storeable food at last year's
[29:55.540 --> 29:59.660]  prices while you still can at preparewithalix.com.
[29:59.660 --> 30:05.260]  Bio-remediation is a process used to treat contaminated water, soil and subsurface material
[30:05.260 --> 30:09.700]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[30:09.700 --> 30:11.660]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[30:11.660 --> 30:16.740]  For the first time, the bio-pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio-remediation
[30:16.740 --> 30:18.780]  products to the everyday consumer.
[30:18.780 --> 30:23.460]  Their first product they are launching is called Bioseptic Pro, a product specifically
[30:23.460 --> 30:26.460]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[30:26.460 --> 30:30.780]  Bioseptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[30:30.780 --> 30:32.700]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[30:32.700 --> 30:37.780]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective
[30:37.780 --> 30:42.580]  than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[30:42.580 --> 30:47.020]  Bioseptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[30:47.020 --> 30:51.060]  Visit thebio-pros.com today and protect your septic system.
[30:51.060 --> 30:53.020]  That's thebio-pros.com.
[30:53.020 --> 30:57.060]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[31:23.020 --> 31:47.540]  InfraWars, the most banned network in the world.
[31:47.540 --> 31:53.380]  Wednesday live, the free world is under globalist attack.
[31:53.380 --> 31:54.860]  World War III has begun.
[31:54.860 --> 32:08.300]  It's globalist forces against free humanity, against diverse markets, against a human future.
[32:08.300 --> 32:09.300]  Let me hit the news.
[32:09.300 --> 32:17.300]  Let me move as judicially as I can, judiciously through all of it, and also open the phones
[32:17.300 --> 32:26.300]  up later in the third hour, Dr. Francis Boyle joining us in the fourth hour, completely
[32:26.300 --> 32:33.820]  vindicated in triplicate, in spades, in royal flush, with his analysis of the Wuhan lab
[32:33.820 --> 32:40.460]  and the bio-weapon that was produced there and what has unfolded since then.
[32:40.460 --> 32:45.820]  The fact that that is the handiwork of Fauci, Bill Gates, and the Rockefeller Foundation
[32:45.820 --> 32:51.020]  for their great reset, which they all pre-planned and their own minions on video bragged about
[32:51.020 --> 32:52.020]  creating.
[32:52.020 --> 32:58.500]  And that really is the insanely important news and the 23-minute emergency report that
[32:58.500 --> 33:08.780]  is the featured video on Bandod video that is titled, Smoking Gun.
[33:08.780 --> 33:19.220]  Fauci, project manager, confesses to creating COVID-19, and he says we took the five viruses
[33:19.220 --> 33:24.580]  and put them together to make a vaccine, but you got to make the pathogen to then make
[33:24.580 --> 33:29.860]  the vaccine and there it is, and then our cover story is that it was for a vaccine.
[33:29.860 --> 33:36.100]  You see the timing of the release, the power grab, all of it, and that's really my frustration
[33:36.100 --> 33:43.100]  is, I don't say things to be shocking, reality is shocking, and I try to shock people out
[33:43.100 --> 33:50.940]  of their complacency with the truth.
[33:50.940 --> 33:58.460]  Bill Gates, Fauci, Klaus Schwab, the UN, the Chikoms, moved the gain of function, Chimera
[33:58.460 --> 34:06.420]  Coven Research from Chapel Hill, when it was exposed by our own academia as dangerous
[34:06.420 --> 34:07.420]  and evil.
[34:07.420 --> 34:12.340]  To Wuhan in 2015 they developed it, they prepared it, Fauci had already tested every level of
[34:12.340 --> 34:19.060]  it where they knew that the vaccine would be more deadly than the virus itself and would
[34:19.060 --> 34:26.380]  attack your cardiovascular system and cause an autoimmune response, which is now happening.
[34:26.380 --> 34:31.740]  And years later what Wolfgang Wudarg and Yedon, the head of the Pfizer program, who had just
[34:31.740 --> 34:36.860]  retired, went public and said this is going to cause heart attacks and strokes, and they
[34:36.860 --> 34:41.420]  pointed at the studies, and that was in December and now it's happening, but they know like
[34:41.420 --> 34:45.540]  a bunch of lemmings going over the edge of a cliff or stampeding buffalo, once you get
[34:45.540 --> 34:49.660]  them running over a cliff, they just keep doing it, and I'm watching everybody run over
[34:49.660 --> 34:54.740]  the side of a cliff and I'm watching them say on the news, oh, it doesn't even protect
[34:54.740 --> 35:00.860]  you, once you've taken the vaccine, and oh, most of the people in the hospital with COVID
[35:00.860 --> 35:09.020]  now had the vaccine, oh, don't worry, a booster's coming, it's all a trap, so of course I said
[35:09.020 --> 35:12.860]  I believe that these war crimes have been committed by Fauci and Gates, and they've
[35:12.860 --> 35:16.260]  talked about the popular in the earth, they've got long histories of corruption, Gates has
[35:16.260 --> 35:22.860]  been kicked out of 30 plus countries for giving people diseases, adding sterilants to tetanus
[35:22.860 --> 35:31.180]  shots, adding live polio to polio vaccines, that's even in Reuters, and India's banned
[35:31.180 --> 35:35.060]  the vaccines he's pushing, and China won't even take them, but they look at us and gas
[35:35.060 --> 35:39.260]  light us and tell us, you need to take it, it's wonderful, and then they isolate the
[35:39.260 --> 35:43.580]  stories, and maybe you hear about one out of a thousand that die, so we only see 50
[35:43.580 --> 35:47.220]  hundred stories a day of people dying, but it's hundreds and hundreds if not thousands
[35:47.220 --> 35:56.140]  of times that, everyone I know is at the park, or at church, or at the gym, and they hear
[35:56.140 --> 35:59.300]  people talking about, oh, my dad took it and died, we're not sure if that's what did it,
[35:59.300 --> 36:14.380]  yeah, my brother took it, he had a stroke, it's everywhere, like if you're out in the
[36:14.380 --> 36:20.340]  desert and you don't see the wildlife drinking out of a pond, and they're going out of there,
[36:20.340 --> 36:25.700]  and there's no tracks up to it, it's because it's poison, well, you see people dropping
[36:25.700 --> 36:28.500]  dead and getting sick, and where they take these shots, which they rush through, which
[36:28.500 --> 36:31.700]  they've been secretive, and people that want you to take them say they want you to die,
[36:31.700 --> 36:34.780]  they want world government, they want the population, my God, that's not even two plus
[36:34.780 --> 36:40.980]  two equals four, that's just, it is, but let me hit the big news, because it ties into
[36:40.980 --> 36:48.980]  all this, we sit here like useless carrion to the globals that they feed on when we don't
[36:48.980 --> 36:54.980]  research the facts, and we become useful idiots, as V.I.
[36:54.980 --> 37:04.460]  Lenin said, to his designs, we're mindless puppets, I didn't get up here over the weekend
[37:04.460 --> 37:12.140]  and say Joe Biden's the main suspect in the pipeline being shut down with ransomware,
[37:12.140 --> 37:17.700]  because I just wanted to blame Biden with something, and when I say Biden, I mean the
[37:17.700 --> 37:24.380]  globalist group that controls the White House.
[37:24.380 --> 37:33.780]  They shut down the main pipeline over 5,000 miles of it out of Canada and the Midwest
[37:33.780 --> 37:41.140]  and the Houston to refine the oil already in its first act at re-stealing the election.
[37:41.140 --> 37:47.180]  So the fact that then the pipeline that sends the refined gas out of Houston to the East
[37:47.180 --> 37:53.860]  Coast, it's logical that they're going to say that a cyber group did it, that hackers
[37:53.860 --> 37:59.580]  did it, and then that gives the globalist more cyber control, more power, more lockdowns
[37:59.580 --> 38:05.380]  and more excuses to create a post-industrial world and to normalize us not having power
[38:05.380 --> 38:09.980]  and not having resources on a normal basis because they're involved in economic warfare
[38:09.980 --> 38:15.160]  against the West and are training us with giant homeless camps and fentanyl everywhere
[38:15.160 --> 38:20.020]  and trash all over the streets and all the rest of it to now have rolling blackouts in
[38:20.020 --> 38:25.340]  the summer, rolling blackouts in the winter.
[38:25.340 --> 38:35.820]  That's the program, that's the operation.
[38:35.820 --> 38:42.420]  So this is a process of deindustrialization, like they've done in Venezuela, Cuba and other
[38:42.420 --> 38:47.380]  areas, it's feudalism, it's making you poor.
[38:47.380 --> 38:52.940]  So Biden says he's going to bankrupt fossil fuels, he's going to take it over, Biden says
[38:52.940 --> 38:56.380]  he's going to shut down the Keystone Pipeline and the coal plants and the coal mining and
[38:56.380 --> 38:57.660]  he is.
[38:57.660 --> 39:04.580]  And then there's another article on infowars.com, Dim's move to deindustrialize US by shutting
[39:04.580 --> 39:10.660]  down a third pipeline, that story's on infowars.com.
[39:10.660 --> 39:15.420]  Here it is with the London Guardian saying how great it is, Michigan orders closure of
[39:15.420 --> 39:23.460]  a pipeline in escalating dispute with Canada, the pipeline's been there for 67 years, it's
[39:23.460 --> 39:29.660]  been updated, it's been expanded, never had an accident.
[39:29.660 --> 39:34.060]  But they say the Governor Whitmer, who does whatever she's told by the globalist, Gretchen
[39:34.060 --> 39:44.460]  Whitmer, that she's ordered it shut down and it will cause the same gas shortages now in
[39:44.460 --> 39:46.340]  the Midwest.
[39:46.340 --> 39:50.140]  This is strategic and it's to see what you'll put up with.
[39:50.140 --> 39:55.900]  And it just says Whitmer's just scared, she just scared that it's going to bust a leak
[39:55.900 --> 40:02.060]  and hurt wildlife and she goes on and she says right here, after the hacking we've seen,
[40:02.060 --> 40:07.580]  she's afraid hackers will hit it and make it flood.
[40:07.580 --> 40:11.980]  Now think of the insane logic of that, it isn't meant to make sense, it's like Biden
[40:11.980 --> 40:19.100]  came out and said oh, the pipeline being shut down isn't causing shortages, it's people panic
[40:19.100 --> 40:20.100]  buying.
[40:20.100 --> 40:23.380]  Well what do people do when they hear there's not going to be enough gas?
[40:23.380 --> 40:25.340]  What do people do when they see a big line?
[40:25.340 --> 40:29.020]  No, there's not enough gas.
[40:29.020 --> 40:35.660]  So they're systematically shutting everything off and then we sit here when it's their policy,
[40:35.660 --> 40:39.180]  it's their deindustrialization plan, it's what they're doing and then we wonder why they're
[40:39.180 --> 40:45.420]  doing it, it's all to create a summer of rage and civil unrest with the inflation that's
[40:45.420 --> 40:50.460]  taking place to then blame the inflation and the collapse on race war, not on the globalist
[40:50.460 --> 40:52.460]  economic warfare, great reset takeover.
[40:52.460 --> 40:57.460]  We'll be right back, stay with us, we've got even more information for you.
[40:57.460 --> 41:03.180]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person but because of the globalists
[41:03.180 --> 41:07.900]  they're attacking humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and
[41:07.900 --> 41:11.900]  we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[41:11.900 --> 41:15.380]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day but just give me
[41:15.380 --> 41:19.620]  a break, the Satanism's out in the open, I've always been a Christian but now the fact
[41:19.620 --> 41:23.180]  that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear and I get it, a lot of you've been
[41:23.180 --> 41:28.180]  turned off by big churches, a lot of you've been turned off by the corrupt priest class
[41:28.180 --> 41:32.740]  system and I get it, me too, believe me I'm one of them but it's that relationship with
[41:32.740 --> 41:39.980]  God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential and God created the universe
[41:39.980 --> 41:43.740]  for us to have communion with God through and to have life and so that's what M-Full
[41:43.740 --> 41:47.380]  Wars is really all about so thank you all for your word of mouth, thank you for spreading
[41:47.380 --> 41:51.020]  the word about M-Full Wars and thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting
[41:51.020 --> 41:55.220]  M-FullWarsStore.com because without your daily and weekly and monthly purchases we'll be
[41:55.220 --> 42:02.220]  taking off the air so thank you for the support M-FullWarsStore.com.
[42:02.220 --> 42:06.700]  Hey Alex, welcome, would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and
[42:06.700 --> 42:10.500]  amongst all this stupidity, wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you
[42:10.500 --> 42:16.900]  for a year, okay, I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll
[42:16.900 --> 42:22.900]  never go away, living defense saved my life, they had me on antibiotics for two years that
[42:22.900 --> 42:28.260]  almost killed me, living defense brought me back, I wanted to just quote from the Bible
[42:28.260 --> 42:34.460]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now, this is Matthew 24 verse 9, then they shall
[42:34.460 --> 42:41.620]  deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for
[42:41.620 --> 42:47.700]  my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate
[42:47.700 --> 42:53.420]  one another and that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter
[42:53.420 --> 43:00.620]  what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[43:00.620 --> 43:05.820]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying where are
[43:05.820 --> 43:10.300]  most of the best selling products you have that we love and my answer is the supply chain
[43:10.300 --> 43:14.820]  has broken down, I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot
[43:14.820 --> 43:18.620]  of these and so that's why we don't have a lot of products in, that's why Info Wars
[43:18.620 --> 43:22.500]  is in financial trouble is because if we had the product you would be buying it we'd have
[43:22.500 --> 43:26.620]  the money but so many of them have been sold out just like you notice a lot of other items
[43:26.620 --> 43:32.020]  at the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded but finally
[43:32.020 --> 43:37.380]  X2 is back in stock the good halogen deep earth crystal iodine so essential in your
[43:37.380 --> 43:43.260]  body it's really the missing link it's 50% off we got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com
[43:43.260 --> 43:46.980]  now when it gets ready to sell out we'll have to go back to near full price take advantage
[43:46.980 --> 43:51.540]  of this now stock up and don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency to forget
[43:51.540 --> 43:56.380]  how great it is and not take it myself but when I do stamina libido energy weight loss
[43:56.380 --> 44:00.260]  it's incredible it's essential it's X2 at infowarstore.com
[44:00.260 --> 44:05.180]  14 months ago I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses the
[44:05.180 --> 44:11.020]  third world dies we have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that
[44:11.020 --> 44:16.460]  when you shut down the first world it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third
[44:16.460 --> 44:20.820]  world and really hurt the first world well now you're hearing about gas shortages all
[44:20.820 --> 44:25.060]  over the united states that's because the companies and the systems and the drivers
[44:25.060 --> 44:30.140]  that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down plus the keystone pipeline
[44:30.140 --> 44:34.900]  has been shut down on one of the other pipelines the left is now blowing up dams across the
[44:34.900 --> 44:40.260]  US we're being shut down our coal power plants are off as well ladies and gentlemen prepare
[44:40.260 --> 44:44.620]  to be a total slave the third world is imploding as well the borders have been removed until
[44:44.620 --> 44:49.860]  you wake up this is a globalist chai com takeover Gregory said you have no hope they're announcing
[44:49.860 --> 44:55.260]  that there will be less than two-thirds the gas needed this summer so they told you that
[44:55.260 --> 45:03.060]  you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family you're
[45:03.060 --> 45:10.060]  listening to the alex jones show
[45:33.060 --> 45:51.740]  welcome back to the alex jones show the most important thing we can do is remember that
[45:51.740 --> 45:57.380]  god is in control not the globalists not satan and not let ourselves get really angry at
[45:57.380 --> 46:02.580]  ourselves and our family is we're so angry at the globalists that that anger bleeds through
[46:02.580 --> 46:08.580]  and I'm talking to myself when I give that advice I have to really control myself and
[46:08.580 --> 46:13.020]  not get angry because I know who the new order is I know they're total predators I know they're
[46:13.020 --> 46:17.700]  orchestrating almost all of this bad stuff or making every crisis that happens as bad
[46:17.700 --> 46:22.900]  as they possibly can because they're the managers over it who consolidate control and power there
[46:22.900 --> 46:27.660]  have been major university white papers written on this there's been intelligence agency heads
[46:27.660 --> 46:31.580]  that have quit and gone public around the world from different European countries this
[46:31.580 --> 46:38.100]  is known that that that globalism is crisis management always creating crises always consolidating
[46:38.100 --> 46:42.660]  power always trying to collapse society just like the globalists have done in the third
[46:42.660 --> 46:48.260]  world what do you see in every James Bond movie there's some evil corporate head who's
[46:48.260 --> 46:56.620]  really a mastermind running criminal organizations who is manipulating to block water from getting
[46:56.620 --> 47:00.700]  to a major city so he can implode the city and then buy up the city for pennies on the
[47:00.700 --> 47:06.540]  dollar or who's releasing biologicals to kill the crops to be able to cause a civil war
[47:06.540 --> 47:14.940]  or who is because that's what they really do was a high level OSS MI6 officer that actually
[47:14.940 --> 47:22.180]  wrote the original James Bond books and he wrote moon raker back in the 50s where a crazy
[47:22.180 --> 47:26.340]  world government guy wants to release bio weapons and kill everyone on earth while they
[47:26.340 --> 47:33.060]  wait safe on a space station because he was around these megalomaniacs and the way they
[47:33.060 --> 47:39.900]  were 60 years ago is the way they are today and as soon as you start seeing Bill Gates
[47:39.900 --> 47:47.580]  as Goldfinger 2.0 as soon as you start seeing Klaus Schwab as Blofeld 2.0 and actually read
[47:47.580 --> 47:51.820]  their damn writings in fact in there in the conference room are three books by Klaus
[47:51.820 --> 47:56.020]  Schwab I meant to show them on air well somebody grab those for me thanks I just reread these
[47:56.020 --> 48:01.620]  things I'd stand over all three of them but I made myself the last week read these things
[48:01.620 --> 48:13.300]  again and it's a criminal confession and the argument of somebody like Schwab or Gates
[48:13.300 --> 48:19.660]  or Fauci is hey yeah we admit all this this is all out in the open and if the public can't
[48:19.660 --> 48:25.820]  figure this out then they deserve to have this basically happen to them and that's what's
[48:25.820 --> 48:33.380]  going on and so it's extremely extremely frustrating at so many levels just like this collar he's
[48:33.380 --> 48:39.180]  popping out on my shirt and drive me crazy you will just take my sports jacket off but
[48:39.180 --> 48:44.380]  that's where we are as a civilization as a society I mean I'm not here making up what
[48:44.380 --> 48:49.620]  I think is going to happen and then it just happens I'm watching them in slow motion tear
[48:49.620 --> 48:59.340]  humanity apart I've had them offer me to join them I've named names I've risked my life because
[48:59.340 --> 49:05.220]  I believe in humanity and I don't want to see this happen but I see all the paid trolls
[49:05.220 --> 49:10.940]  on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube out there spouting lies oh it's safe oh take it most
[49:10.940 --> 49:15.300]  of them are being paid a few thousand dollars to go out and do that it's on record they're
[49:15.300 --> 49:20.300]  paying hundreds of thousands of influencers around the world to tell everybody that you're
[49:20.300 --> 49:27.020]  evil and you're crazy if you don't take your vaccines and then we sit here and we see the
[49:27.020 --> 49:36.620]  general public hearing from Biden that Russian hackers got into the pipeline and turned it
[49:36.620 --> 49:49.100]  off and then oh even though now they paid the ransom they can't get the pipeline going again
[49:49.100 --> 49:56.060]  the globalists are testing how we'll respond it was in the Texas document five days before
[49:56.060 --> 50:02.900]  the power went off on that Saturday on that Valentine's Day in February I was here in
[50:02.900 --> 50:08.300]  Austin and in comes the storm in the north they estimated it's gonna hit they say we
[50:08.300 --> 50:12.660]  need to up power our coal plants and our natural gas plants and the Fed said you're not given
[50:12.660 --> 50:17.860]  authorization tonight they waited till the power grid started going down to then throw
[50:17.860 --> 50:24.660]  us a life raft why are the feds involved in controlling Texas power it's not an independent
[50:24.660 --> 50:30.620]  grid ERCOT was in control and it's on record that they didn't turn the power back on and
[50:30.620 --> 50:36.580]  what did I say I said I guarantee you like Enron they're gonna charge billions of dollars
[50:36.580 --> 50:41.540]  extra a day that'll turn out to be a fraud and then it came out exactly what I said
[50:41.540 --> 50:49.020]  because they run the same scams over and over and over again so they wouldn't let us turn
[50:49.020 --> 50:54.260]  our power up for the storm for more increased use let the power be off for almost two weeks
[50:54.260 --> 51:01.180]  total in some areas a week almost everywhere they shut up down the keystone pipeline they
[51:01.180 --> 51:07.340]  said they're gonna bankrupt the coal companies and mines they're doing it the prices explode
[51:07.340 --> 51:12.020]  the country falls apart no one wants to business here so China wins the trade war because America
[51:12.020 --> 51:18.780]  and the governors refuse to stay closed by just turn stem pipeline off to the south
[51:18.780 --> 51:28.820]  mainly and now that's not enough Gretchen Whitmer says I'm afraid hackers will hack the 67 year
[51:28.820 --> 51:33.380]  old pipeline that's never had a problem that comes out of Canada into Michigan supplying
[51:33.380 --> 51:38.900]  the Midwest and she ordered it turned off two days ago and the pipeline operator is
[51:38.900 --> 51:47.020]  refusing and so now she's gonna send the state police to sabotage it and the news is saying
[51:47.020 --> 51:56.740]  oh yes yes turn the pipeline off yes that's the world we live in of upside down world
[51:56.740 --> 52:01.900]  Michigan orders closure of pipeline in escalating dispute with Canada and they say because Whitmer
[52:01.900 --> 52:12.420]  scared never had a problem operation 67 years Whitmer scared they're gonna turn it off and
[52:12.420 --> 52:17.740]  she says you'll have the state police go in how about like Waco maybe you just blow it
[52:17.740 --> 52:25.700]  up huh that'll teach those dirty Americans they're turning your power off in your face
[52:25.700 --> 52:30.660]  they destroy every blue city and state on purpose they work for the chai comms America's
[52:30.660 --> 52:39.020]  not open for business we're being shut down it's all coming up we have a man who had a
[52:39.020 --> 52:46.100]  stroke is 45 he's a coach his niece works here she's 20 something I tried to get her
[52:46.100 --> 52:49.300]  on there she said how about you just talk to my uncle he's on a couple segments next
[52:49.300 --> 52:54.780]  hour so you can hear directly from somebody that took the Pfizer mRNA Frank and shot and
[52:54.780 --> 52:58.900]  what happened to him and we've got his physical everything he got earlier he was total great
[52:58.900 --> 53:03.500]  health those it doesn't he's gonna be around kids as a coach and you see what happens that's
[53:03.500 --> 53:08.460]  coming up separately I'm extremely excited when I say extremely excited I'm extremely
[53:08.460 --> 53:15.460]  excited about this next announcement when you're in a grocery store or you're at any
[53:15.460 --> 53:23.940]  major place that sells supplements you see the in caps that have magnesium and that's
[53:23.940 --> 53:28.540]  because magnesium is critical it's essential in the body it's all about your heart it's
[53:28.540 --> 53:31.220]  all about your cardiovascular it's all about your lungs but it's about every cell in the
[53:31.220 --> 53:34.980]  body has to have it and it's not something that makes you calm where you're tired it
[53:34.980 --> 53:40.580]  makes you relaxed and confident and when I forget to take magnesium I really feel it
[53:40.580 --> 53:44.860]  well guess what ladies and gentlemen I told the crew years ago I wanted this we finally
[53:44.860 --> 53:53.300]  have it I've worked with a top developer to do it and it is ionic fizzy magnesium formula
[53:53.300 --> 53:58.700]  fueled by the power of ionization we take two types of magnesium all the other competitors
[53:58.700 --> 54:04.500]  have one we have even better form of it and then it is basically electrified ionized
[54:04.500 --> 54:13.180]  for better absorption into the cells we are extremely proud of the fore's live fizzy
[54:13.180 --> 54:20.740]  magnesium orange natural flavored mix to great for adults great for children great for everybody
[54:20.740 --> 54:25.580]  you're going to be blown away by this an estimated 75% of Americans do not meet the recommended
[54:25.580 --> 54:34.340]  amount of magnesium in their blood or intake the decision many people do not take true ionic
[54:34.340 --> 54:43.780]  magnesium for optimal absorption and delivery into individual cells magnesium is documented
[54:43.780 --> 54:49.820]  to help smoothly regulate the nervous system repair RNA and DNA convert food into energy
[54:49.820 --> 54:55.820]  and so much more that's why we created the new ionized fizzy magnesium drink mix with
[54:55.820 --> 55:02.940]  true ionic magnesium available right now for introductory pricing of 1995 this is a really

[55:35.500 --> 55:42.580]  you buy an extra one it's 1495 not 1995 they'll read all the things it does help convert food
[55:42.580 --> 55:50.220]  to energy helps replace and repair RNA and DNA it goes on and on globalist puppet Joe
[55:50.220 --> 55:56.860]  biden wasted no time blaming Russia with no evidence for the shutdown of the east coast
[55:56.860 --> 56:01.340]  gasoline pipeline that goes from houston right up through new york city it supplies more
[56:01.340 --> 56:05.700]  than half of the gasoline to the east coast but who is it that actually shut down the
[56:05.700 --> 56:11.340]  main pipeline from canada through the midwest to houston to refine the oil that's then turned
[56:11.340 --> 56:16.900]  into gas instead of the east coast that's right Joe Biden shut down the keystone pipeline
[56:16.900 --> 56:22.420]  right after it was completed Joe Biden did that to america he has the history he has
[56:22.420 --> 56:26.660]  the background he's the one that promised to quote get us off of fossil fuels he's
[56:26.660 --> 56:32.180]  the one that's trying to extend the lockdowns of the country remember ladies and gentlemen
[56:32.180 --> 56:36.460]  that the new world order once opposed to industrial world and they want the united states europe
[56:36.460 --> 56:41.620]  and australia cripples of communist china can be dominant it's not russia that's the
[56:41.620 --> 56:46.620]  enemy it's communist china and their millions like joe biden in control of the white house
[56:46.620 --> 56:54.580]  that's the facts that's the information your brain your heart your bones your liver your
[56:54.580 --> 57:00.820]  eyes everything has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when you have high

[57:52.580 --> 58:22.340]  listening to the Alex Jones show. Peter Desick the British director of six projects at the
[58:22.340 --> 58:30.860]  Wuhan lab directly funded by Obama and Dr. Anthony Fauci has confessed on video to weaponizing
[58:30.860 --> 58:39.540]  five viruses in China and combining them into COVID-19 we're about to lay it out right now.
[58:39.540 --> 58:44.860]  For five years from 2014 to 2019 the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
[58:44.860 --> 58:48.940]  which Tony Fauci runs and has for decades pumped money to a group called the eco health
[58:48.940 --> 58:53.700]  alliance the eco health alliance is run by man whose name you may recognize Dr. Peter
[58:53.700 --> 58:59.340]  Desick. Desick contracted with Dr. Sheet it conducts gain of function experiments at the
[58:59.340 --> 59:05.980]  Wuhan lab. Desick bragged about how easy it is to manipulate coronaviruses in lab experiments.
[59:05.980 --> 59:10.820]  You can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily this is spike protein drives a lot
[59:10.820 --> 59:15.220]  of what happens with the coronavirus. The gain of function research that Peter Desick
[59:15.220 --> 59:19.100]  was bragging about in the video we just showed you had in fact been banned explicitly by
[59:19.100 --> 59:24.540]  the U.S. government. There was a federal moratorium on the funding of exactly the kind of gain
[59:24.540 --> 59:29.460]  of function experiments that went on in the Wuhan lab to disaster its effects. So why
[59:29.460 --> 59:37.300]  didn't the U.S. government halt its funding of the lab in Wuhan who signed off on this
[59:37.300 --> 59:42.260]  Tony Fauci possibly along with Francis Collins the director of the NIH invoked that special
[59:42.260 --> 59:48.660]  exemption or to keep funding the Wuhan lab and the deadly experiments that were going
[59:48.660 --> 59:54.980]  on there the experiments that clearly went so wrong. This wouldn't have happened if Tony
[59:54.980 --> 1:00:04.140]  Fauci didn't allow it to happen. That is clear. It's an amazing story. It is a shocking story.
[1:00:04.140 --> 1:00:08.300]  In a functional country there would be a criminal investigation currently underway into Tony
[1:00:08.300 --> 1:00:13.060]  Fauci's role in the covid pandemic that has killed millions and halted our country and
[1:00:13.060 --> 1:00:18.180]  changed it forever. So why isn't there a criminal investigation into Tony Fauci's role in this
[1:00:18.180 --> 1:00:29.100]  pandemic. This is undoubtedly the biggest news we've ever broken in my 27 year history
[1:00:29.100 --> 1:00:35.380]  on air. Now Tucker Carlson partially scooped us last night which I am totally happy to
[1:00:35.380 --> 1:00:41.220]  do. I was up here at like 6 30. I was exhausted last night and I told Rob do. Let's do this
[1:00:41.220 --> 1:00:45.820]  in the morning. This story is so important. Let's let's come in and shoot a special report
[1:00:45.820 --> 1:00:49.900]  and then add the documentation to this because it's so giant. And then I went home turned
[1:00:49.900 --> 1:00:54.660]  on Tucker Carlson and my family and watched him tell about 80 percent of the story that
[1:00:54.660 --> 1:01:01.300]  he pointed to a major report from a former top New York Times writer Nicholas Wade that
[1:01:01.300 --> 1:01:07.540]  is in TheWire.in because the New York Times obviously would not publish something this
[1:01:07.540 --> 1:01:11.580]  huge and what does he break down from all the admitted evidence that we're about to
[1:01:11.580 --> 1:01:17.900]  lay out. The Wuhan lab was a joint operation between the Obama administration and the communist
[1:01:17.900 --> 1:01:22.980]  Chinese with Dr. Fauci running the operation. And that's what all the documents and all
[1:01:22.980 --> 1:01:27.780]  the admissions are. And then when it began to come out last year they had the people
[1:01:27.780 --> 1:01:33.900]  that actually ran these projects at the lab write the Lancet study saying that there was
[1:01:33.900 --> 1:01:39.860]  no connection to the lab and putting out the fake information about the wet animal market.
[1:01:39.860 --> 1:01:43.580]  And so you've got them funding it. You've got them running it. You've got them then
[1:01:43.580 --> 1:01:48.740]  trying to cover it up. But here's what's even more insane. Tucker only got to part of the
[1:01:48.740 --> 1:01:54.740]  interview with the main corporate manager of six of the gain of function weaponization
[1:01:54.740 --> 1:02:06.020]  of SARS COVID viruses in the full interview he did in 2019. He actually admits that they
[1:02:06.020 --> 1:02:13.660]  were working on creating a super virus with all five viruses in it and how to infect humans
[1:02:13.660 --> 1:02:18.180]  so they could then create a vaccine for the threat. That's how bio weapon development
[1:02:18.180 --> 1:02:22.380]  works is you get around international treaties and national laws by saying oh no we're not
[1:02:22.380 --> 1:02:27.140]  creating a bio weapon. We're creating horrible things in a lab that someone else might make
[1:02:27.140 --> 1:02:32.620]  so we can counter it. But nature would have never combined five viruses together and CRISPR
[1:02:32.620 --> 1:02:39.140]  gene editing is dead on. The Indians own them. Europe owns them. The US, China, Australia
[1:02:39.140 --> 1:02:46.860]  and it was 14 15 months ago that major Indian Institute very respected scan the virus and
[1:02:46.860 --> 1:02:53.100]  said it's five viruses. It has a heavy delivery system. You see the peace shuttle gene insertions
[1:02:53.100 --> 1:02:59.900]  where they spliced the viruses together. I'm driving home at seven o'clock at night on
[1:02:59.900 --> 1:03:05.500]  Monday night to see my family and I just remembered there's only two days left for our wonderful
[1:03:05.500 --> 1:03:09.620]  listeners to get incredibly high quality, storeable food at the lowest price you're
[1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:15.820]  going to find anywhere at preparewithalex.com. These are 20 20 prices for a limited time
[1:03:15.820 --> 1:03:19.260]  for our listeners and the price isn't just going to go back to regular. So you have to
[1:03:19.260 --> 1:03:24.820]  go up. Everybody else has already raised prices way more than my Patreon. We have their entire
[1:03:24.820 --> 1:03:32.500]  spectrum and catalog at infoarstore.com, preparewithalex.com. You get an additional 10% off on three months,
[1:03:32.500 --> 1:03:39.380]  six months, your supplies and everything else on the site. Preparewithalex.com. I would
[1:03:39.380 --> 1:03:44.580]  take advantage of this. What's happening in food price increases around the world. I predict
[1:03:44.580 --> 1:03:48.860]  that by the fall you're going to see major shortages. You're going to see huge price
[1:03:48.860 --> 1:03:53.180]  increases. I think it's a smart bet right now to get high quality, storeable food at
[1:03:53.180 --> 1:04:15.300]  last year's prices while you still can and preparewithalex.com.
[1:04:15.300 --> 1:04:39.260]  Stop tyranny. Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[1:04:39.260 --> 1:04:47.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number two of this live May 12 Wednesday transmission.
[1:04:47.860 --> 1:04:52.460]  And we are seeing 21st century warfare. We're seeing global corporations and the UN that
[1:04:52.460 --> 1:04:58.900]  they set up setting up a powerful in your face world government. And they are coming
[1:04:58.900 --> 1:05:08.540]  after everybody's basic freedoms and are setting up a dictatorial world ID system. So let's
[1:05:08.540 --> 1:05:13.540]  go ahead and go over some of this news and we're going to a special guest. Michigan orders
[1:05:13.540 --> 1:05:19.860]  closure of pipeline in escalating dispute with Canada. Canada has a treaty. They've
[1:05:19.860 --> 1:05:26.060]  operated the pipeline safely for 67 years. It supplies much of the Midwest and Michigan
[1:05:26.060 --> 1:05:32.940]  and Wisconsin with oil that is turned into gas. And Whitmer just says environmentalist
[1:05:32.940 --> 1:05:39.020]  order it closed just like Keystone's been closed that supplies the raw crude that is refined
[1:05:39.020 --> 1:05:44.620]  and set up the colonial. So that's why I say Biden and the globalist of the main suspect
[1:05:44.620 --> 1:05:49.540]  they say they want to shut it down. They're shutting down pipelines everywhere. Constantly
[1:05:49.540 --> 1:05:55.540]  they're blocking all new pipeline construction in the US. Most areas of the country they
[1:05:55.540 --> 1:06:02.060]  blocked new oil drilling. And then he says, oh, it's some nebulous group in Russia. Yeah,
[1:06:02.060 --> 1:06:05.420]  sure. I've been hearing that for quite a while. New York Times and others had to retract
[1:06:05.420 --> 1:06:09.060]  two weeks ago that they said, Giuliani was working for the Russians. They just made
[1:06:09.060 --> 1:06:15.820]  it up. Of course they do. They're Chai Khan agents. Their job is to shut the US down.
[1:06:15.820 --> 1:06:20.300]  So everything moves to China. That's what the great reset was. That's what the COVID-19
[1:06:20.300 --> 1:06:26.260]  is. They admit it. Klaus Schwab has written all these books. But here they are right
[1:06:26.260 --> 1:06:34.260]  here. I'll grab them for you. Look at this. Stakeholder capitalism. Klaus Schwab, meaning
[1:06:34.260 --> 1:06:39.500]  only if you're a good little globalist do you get to do business. Shaping the fourth
[1:06:39.500 --> 1:06:43.500]  industrial revolution, Klaus Schwab, how they're going to have a post human world and
[1:06:43.500 --> 1:06:49.220]  face humans out. And then this book he published in the first month of the pandemic. They already
[1:06:49.220 --> 1:06:52.660]  had written and ready. He said all this years before how they'd use a virus to bring in
[1:06:52.660 --> 1:06:56.460]  world government and plantable microchips under your skin. They enter the family, a
[1:06:56.460 --> 1:07:03.100]  robot takeover, no more beef, and you're in a drink of sewage water. Although the EU just
[1:07:03.100 --> 1:07:09.460]  approved meal bugs as the main food for children in public school. Told you that was coming.
[1:07:09.460 --> 1:07:15.780]  So that's what they're doing. You might want to actually find out what they're up to. And
[1:07:15.780 --> 1:07:21.180]  that dovetails into fighting back and removing Liz Cheney from the Republican leadership.
[1:07:21.180 --> 1:07:26.100]  That is certainly a good thing. When we stand up for these monsters, all we have is victory.
[1:07:26.100 --> 1:07:31.780]  We lay down all we have is enslavement. And that leads us now to our next subject. Rand
[1:07:31.780 --> 1:07:38.900]  Paul confronts Fauci on funding gain of function research at Wuhan lab. Fauci spectacularly
[1:07:38.900 --> 1:07:46.780]  lies. We'll be playing much of that exchange in the fourth hour when Dr. Francis A. Boyle,
[1:07:46.780 --> 1:07:51.420]  author of the U.S. biological law, former top UN war crimes prosecutor and one of the
[1:07:51.420 --> 1:07:57.260]  main contributors to world law on biological chemical weapons, has talked about the Geneva
[1:07:57.260 --> 1:08:01.420]  Convention, the war crimes have been committed and how those involved in carrying out the
[1:08:01.420 --> 1:08:05.660]  release of this virus and then the deadly shots are guilty of violating the Nuremberg
[1:08:05.660 --> 1:08:11.100]  Code. And you know what the Nuremberg Code says. After convicted, the punishment is execution.
[1:08:11.100 --> 1:08:15.500]  And I said that yesterday. The media said I was death-threading Bill Gates. No, I wasn't.
[1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:19.220]  I said I want to, I think he's guilty of this. We've got the evidence. Nobody's doing anything
[1:08:19.220 --> 1:08:22.100]  to him. That's the last thing we want. That turns him into a victim. We want to get to
[1:08:22.100 --> 1:08:26.220]  the bottom of who's behind this. There's plenty of evidence to indict them now. That's coming
[1:08:26.220 --> 1:08:32.060]  up after our guest leaves us. But Rand Paul confronts Fauci. That's coming up. Smoking
[1:08:32.060 --> 1:08:37.180]  gun video. Fauci project manager confesses he created COVID-19. That's up on Band-Aut
[1:08:37.180 --> 1:08:42.860]  Video. Far right ceases on Wuhan lab concerns. We did that a year and three months ago. We
[1:08:42.860 --> 1:08:48.180]  did just seize on it. Far right ceases on Wuhan lab concerns is proof that Fauci masterminded
[1:08:48.180 --> 1:08:54.500]  the COVID-19 pandemic. And it goes on and on. We've got all the latest deaths. Kids
[1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:58.940]  being given the shots. Everything else. People on Reddit. It's talking about all the bad
[1:08:58.940 --> 1:09:04.460]  reactions they've had. How long until that gets censored. But I wanted to bring you an
[1:09:04.460 --> 1:09:09.140]  actual witness to all of this. You see it in the news. You talk to people that have heard
[1:09:09.140 --> 1:09:13.020]  about it. You hear the callers. But one of the great young ladies that works there. I
[1:09:13.020 --> 1:09:18.060]  won't say her names as she gets harassed. She works in social media. She's in her early
[1:09:18.060 --> 1:09:25.220]  twenties. Her uncle is 45 years old. And he's a coach. We don't get him harassed. We won't
[1:09:25.220 --> 1:09:28.780]  say where or what. And they want you to get vaccinated. We'll be around the kids. But
[1:09:28.780 --> 1:09:34.100]  it's not a vaccine. It's a gene therapy unapproved. Approved under emergency authorization. So
[1:09:34.100 --> 1:09:39.460]  he gave us his medical records. The party doesn't want seen or blacked out. In fact,
[1:09:39.460 --> 1:09:42.180]  we're not going to even say his name. He didn't black this out. We're going to black
[1:09:42.180 --> 1:09:47.300]  that out now. And we've got a nickname for him. Let me just do that. That's the best
[1:09:47.300 --> 1:09:51.860]  thing to do. They said I could show all this, but I'm going to black that out too. And here
[1:09:51.860 --> 1:09:58.300]  is his scan of his vaccine card, which is again his gene therapy card. And it says when
[1:09:58.300 --> 1:10:07.740]  he got it. You see you got the first one on 411. Got the next one on 5.2. And it was,
[1:10:07.740 --> 1:10:15.340]  as you can see, the Pfizer. And there are all the numbers, Travis County, and all the
[1:10:15.340 --> 1:10:22.500]  information right there. Headquarters, healthcare, professional, clinical site. And it's got
[1:10:22.500 --> 1:10:28.660]  the lot number and all the information right there. And then here, again, he doesn't mind
[1:10:28.660 --> 1:10:31.700]  me putting down his full name, but I'm just going to do this for him. Because the left
[1:10:31.700 --> 1:10:38.020]  will harass people. This is the actual, it's not a scan. This is his medical notes right
[1:10:38.020 --> 1:10:44.700]  here. That game does. Add a stroke, passed out. Everything happened to him. Adry had
[1:10:44.700 --> 1:10:50.860]  the second shot a few days after. He's here to lay it all out for you. We'll go by Coach
[1:10:50.860 --> 1:10:55.860]  Pete, is the uncle of an Info Wars employee, a father and a husband. Coach Pete is a non-political
[1:10:55.860 --> 1:11:00.860]  person that coaches joining us today to discuss his reaction to the vaccine, which may have
[1:11:00.860 --> 1:11:05.340]  been the cause of a possible stroke. And he's gotten out of the hospital. I asked, where's
[1:11:05.340 --> 1:11:09.860]  that crew member? We need her. Oh, her uncle's in the hospital. I said, let me guess the
[1:11:09.860 --> 1:11:14.940]  vaccine. They go, yeah, we're about to tell you that. So he joins us now. Coach Pete,
[1:11:14.940 --> 1:11:17.620]  we're glad you're still alive, brother. Thanks for joining us.
[1:11:17.620 --> 1:11:23.820]  Thank you so much for having me, Mr. Jones. Well, we got a few minutes to break, but just
[1:11:23.820 --> 1:11:28.540]  tell us about yourself and tell us what happened. We appreciate you sharing. Yeah, absolutely.
[1:11:28.540 --> 1:11:35.220]  So yes, like you said, I did go ahead and got my vaccine shot. This past Saturday, I
[1:11:35.220 --> 1:11:41.180]  would say around 1020. They said I fainted. You know, I was sitting on my couch watching
[1:11:41.180 --> 1:11:45.980]  the boxing match. And the next thing I remember, I'm in the ambulance. For a split second,
[1:11:45.980 --> 1:11:53.140]  I woke up. And then after that, shortly after that, I woke up inside a CT scan in the hospital.
[1:11:53.140 --> 1:11:57.500]  And then shortly after that, I'm being released. Now, I don't know the timeframe. I know it
[1:11:57.500 --> 1:12:01.980]  was between 10 and two, three in the morning. But I don't remember anything. They said I
[1:12:01.980 --> 1:12:09.060]  blanked out. I was classified as a faint. I never known a faint to last from 1020 to
[1:12:09.060 --> 1:12:16.300]  the next morning. So I'm sorry, I lost you. No, no, no, you're doing a good job. I mean,
[1:12:16.300 --> 1:12:20.220]  I'm here just listening to you and thinking about this. And that's what they say over
[1:12:20.220 --> 1:12:25.340]  and over again. When people even die, whether it was Hank Aaron or Marvis Marvin Hagler
[1:12:25.340 --> 1:12:29.260]  or something, you know, oh, we don't know that was the vaccine did it. But even though
[1:12:29.260 --> 1:12:33.500]  their family says, in many cases, they died a day or two after they take it.
[1:12:33.500 --> 1:12:38.540]  Correct, correct. And I heard the same stories and a real concern. And it's concerning to
[1:12:38.540 --> 1:12:42.580]  me that I was not, I didn't have any conscious anything that happened to me that night. I
[1:12:42.580 --> 1:12:49.860]  was in the hands of the people that were here in my house happened. I did not know anything
[1:12:49.860 --> 1:12:54.100]  was going on. I walked out of the hospital and I'm not even sure how I made it up the
[1:12:54.100 --> 1:13:00.340]  stairs to my bedroom. Wow. I have no recollection of it. So I mean, I've got the medical records
[1:13:00.340 --> 1:13:03.740]  here, but you took one shot one month to give the next month. And then what was it five,
[1:13:03.740 --> 1:13:06.540]  six days after you took the second shot that you collapsed?
[1:13:06.540 --> 1:13:11.820]  It's correct. That is correct. Saturday, this past Saturday.
[1:13:11.820 --> 1:13:14.020]  And how long were you in the hospital?
[1:13:14.020 --> 1:13:21.660]  Sure did. I was in the hospital, I would say anything between 1030 a.m. till about 2.30
[1:13:21.660 --> 1:13:27.540]  a.m. I was released. I walked out of my own two feet that I have no memory of. I have
[1:13:27.540 --> 1:13:32.620]  no memory of getting home and walking in to my own bedroom till the next morning.
[1:13:32.620 --> 1:13:37.580]  All right, brother, we're going to come back to you and show some shocking clips, the newest
[1:13:37.580 --> 1:13:42.620]  clips of people taking the vaccine and collapsing a few minutes later, and people having convulsions.
[1:13:42.620 --> 1:13:47.460]  And that's what the literature says that these vaccines will do. That's what they told Fauci,
[1:13:47.460 --> 1:13:52.980]  do not give it to humans as a vaccine University of Texas did in 2012. That's why I say it's
[1:13:52.980 --> 1:13:56.780]  a war criminal. This has all been premeditated.
[1:13:56.780 --> 1:14:02.100]  The biofros are the new non-GMO pollution solution using eco-friendly products to treat

[1:14:56.700 --> 1:15:00.980]  So what's the most important part? Let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist.
[1:15:00.980 --> 1:15:05.460]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front. It's all very important, but
[1:15:05.460 --> 1:15:09.340]  the fuel is paramount, and that's my allegor.
[1:15:09.340 --> 1:15:14.100]  TurboForce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different
[1:15:14.100 --> 1:15:18.540]  natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic
[1:15:18.540 --> 1:15:21.940]  system metabolism of a human. Some people get 15 hours out of it. Some people get about
[1:15:21.940 --> 1:15:25.460]  8 hours. But people take this, people take it in sports, people cannot believe it's the
[1:15:25.460 --> 1:15:32.260]  best they've ever had because it's not pipe. Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts,
[1:15:32.260 --> 1:15:36.260]  their post-workouts. You can call us whatever you want. It's a total solution all around
[1:15:36.260 --> 1:15:37.500]  the best you're going to find.
[1:15:37.500 --> 1:15:42.380]  TurboForce, without you, we don't roll. With you, we search forward together. It's like
[1:15:42.380 --> 1:15:46.060]  the bulldozer without the diesel fuel. If we don't have your financial support, we will
[1:15:46.060 --> 1:15:49.100]  be defeated. You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your
[1:15:49.100 --> 1:16:00.540]  body and your mind. It's a win-win, 360-together, infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[1:16:00.540 --> 1:16:15.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:16:15.900 --> 1:16:22.020]  We are in the middle of an incredible adventure, good versus evil. I'm extremely honored to
[1:16:22.020 --> 1:16:27.260]  be your host. We've got so much news. Your call is a bunch of big guests today. We're
[1:16:27.260 --> 1:16:34.940]  just kicking off this transmission. But it's really important that we have Coach Piedon
[1:16:34.940 --> 1:16:41.220]  because my grandmother was told she was given polio by the vaccine. I knew this when I was
[1:16:41.220 --> 1:16:46.460]  a kid. My mother knew it. She admitted it to me. And even before she died, I said, please,
[1:16:46.460 --> 1:16:50.220]  you'll never do an interview. She was, I don't want to be a nasty person and talk about
[1:16:50.220 --> 1:16:54.100]  it about my doctor. He didn't mean it. Well, the globalist meant it. Dr. Sack made jokes
[1:16:54.100 --> 1:16:59.220]  about it. And Bragg, there were too many people. And so what? I have the video. He was a eugenicist.
[1:16:59.220 --> 1:17:04.060]  It's a mad scientist club. And she's like, I'm not going to be part of that. Well, we
[1:17:04.060 --> 1:17:08.980]  better tell people what happens. We better talk about it. My mother was a triathlete
[1:17:08.980 --> 1:17:15.700]  on University of Texas Masters. She won silver and gold medals. She was competing in former
[1:17:15.700 --> 1:17:19.260]  Olympic athletes and winning. She didn't get into swimming because she was 30. They told
[1:17:19.260 --> 1:17:25.740]  them take a flu shot 30 years ago. My mother almost died and never competed again. So I
[1:17:25.740 --> 1:17:31.980]  know my uncle took a tetanus shot almost killed him. I know about this. And then I got the
[1:17:31.980 --> 1:17:36.860]  facts. This is not about vaccines about these mad scientists putting stuff in it. So here's
[1:17:36.860 --> 1:17:40.660]  a one minute clip that just came out yesterday. It's on Bandai Video. I hope you share it
[1:17:40.660 --> 1:17:45.100]  with people of a woman in Latin America standing there and then a woman behind it supposed
[1:17:45.100 --> 1:17:49.540]  to wait 15 minutes every take the shot. A lot of folks get sick and the woman just collapses
[1:17:49.540 --> 1:17:53.940]  in another video in Mexico of a man having convulsions. They said he'd been having him
[1:17:53.940 --> 1:17:58.860]  for over a day after he had the vaccine. That's a continual convulsion that kills you. Here
[1:17:58.860 --> 1:18:16.860]  it is.
[1:18:16.860 --> 1:18:41.260]  Wait, wait out. Violent auto, mid-response. What are they back saying? Yesterday. I can
[1:18:41.260 --> 1:18:54.740]  lower the stretcher. They all know what it is. Every time that happens they say oh it's
[1:18:54.740 --> 1:19:03.460]  covid not the vaccine. Video woman collapses and convulses man in hospital convulses after
[1:19:03.460 --> 1:19:09.780]  having covid vaccine which is not a vaccine. So it's important what Coach Pete has done
[1:19:09.780 --> 1:19:14.140]  like others. He's actually telling the testimony. People who've had children die from vaccines
[1:19:14.140 --> 1:19:18.300]  should tell the testimony to save their lives. And I'm not mad at those people but they work
[1:19:18.300 --> 1:19:23.580]  right here in this building. We have to tell these stories to save others. So Coach Pete
[1:19:23.580 --> 1:19:29.420]  now knowing this, would you take this experimental vaccine that did not go through approval now
[1:19:29.420 --> 1:19:33.220]  after clearly what happened to you after you took it?
[1:19:33.220 --> 1:19:38.500]  No I would not. I would not take it. I was actually a youngstakenit. My wife was adamant
[1:19:38.500 --> 1:19:43.100]  about taking it and having the kids take it and my kids have older children so they're
[1:19:43.100 --> 1:19:48.220]  able to take it and so we did. I said well my kids are taking it and my wife's taking
[1:19:48.220 --> 1:19:53.540]  it. I'm going to take it with them so we're all in it together even though I was literally
[1:19:53.540 --> 1:19:58.100]  100% against taking the vaccine.
[1:19:58.100 --> 1:20:01.580]  Well we just appreciate you stepping forward. I tried to get your niece to and she said look
[1:20:01.580 --> 1:20:05.980]  I don't want to be public. I totally get that. She said but my uncle probably talked
[1:20:05.980 --> 1:20:09.700]  and you were willing to come on. What makes you different than all the other people that
[1:20:09.700 --> 1:20:13.020]  this happens to but they won't testify?
[1:20:13.020 --> 1:20:17.740]  I'm not sure what makes you different but what I did turn into you guys was my medical
[1:20:17.740 --> 1:20:23.620]  records because I wanted to show that just in April 14th I didn't go to a specialist
[1:20:23.620 --> 1:20:30.020]  here to get a full labs, full setup, check the heart, check the veins, anything you can
[1:20:30.020 --> 1:20:36.140]  think of related to. I'm a heavier state guy so I went in guy from A to B, A to Z and
[1:20:36.140 --> 1:20:40.340]  I wanted to make sure all my labs were right and then I got my vaccine and we could go
[1:20:40.340 --> 1:20:48.860]  and then I fainted for the hospital. I fainted. I fainted that lasted 10 hours as I never
[1:20:48.860 --> 1:20:54.020]  heard of that so I have a door recollection, anything that happened. I have cameras at
[1:20:54.020 --> 1:20:58.260]  my house if it wasn't for that I wouldn't see myself being rolled out of the stretcher
[1:20:58.260 --> 1:21:02.980]  and being, I walked myself back in the home but it had not been for my cameras so I would
[1:21:02.980 --> 1:21:05.820]  have never, I have no recollection of it.
[1:21:05.820 --> 1:21:13.380]  Well that's right, it's right here in lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8 of their write up
[1:21:13.380 --> 1:21:20.620]  on you at the hospital that you have the second dose, they had full physical heart, check
[1:21:20.620 --> 1:21:26.980]  all 100% normal and pass stress test right there. So you were healthy, clean bill of
[1:21:26.980 --> 1:21:31.900]  health, 45 years old and this happened to you.
[1:21:31.900 --> 1:21:35.660]  That is correct, that is correct. I woke up at the ambulance for like seconds, I woke
[1:21:35.660 --> 1:21:40.740]  up inside a CT scan tube for a few seconds, there were cats scanning my brain, checking
[1:21:40.740 --> 1:21:45.420]  for, they thought maybe I possibly might have had a stroke but at the end of the day when
[1:21:45.420 --> 1:21:51.620]  I was discharged, they discharged that as a faint but I don't remember anything. I couldn't
[1:21:51.620 --> 1:21:54.940]  tell you what the room looked like with one nurse or doctor.
[1:21:54.940 --> 1:21:59.260]  Just expand on that, it's not like this only happened to you so maybe it's over and over
[1:21:59.260 --> 1:22:04.740]  again people are collapsing, they're having an autoimmune response in the brain, swelling
[1:22:04.740 --> 1:22:07.740]  and then when the swelling goes down you come back out of it, that's one of the things
[1:22:07.740 --> 1:22:14.180]  we see, I'm not a doctor, I love how they say doctors say possible cause B12 shots when
[1:22:14.180 --> 1:22:18.100]  there's no connection to B12 shots, I take B12 shots, they're amazing, they're totally
[1:22:18.100 --> 1:22:23.100]  natural just right in the fat, that is just, oh it's not the vaccine though, it's the
[1:22:23.100 --> 1:22:25.700]  evil B12.
[1:22:25.700 --> 1:22:31.500]  I have taken B12 shots probably the last four to five years even probably longer than that
[1:22:31.500 --> 1:22:37.380]  so I highly doubt that anything B12 related caused me to faint for that amount of time
[1:22:37.380 --> 1:22:41.940]  or and have no memory of it, you know, thank God I had family around me that was able to
[1:22:41.940 --> 1:22:46.900]  take care of me because I had no function and I would not be able to answer question
[1:22:46.900 --> 1:22:51.220]  one as myself.
[1:22:51.220 --> 1:22:54.820]  Well if you go to the Reddit forums there are thousands of people talking about what's
[1:22:54.820 --> 1:22:59.740]  happened and they admit there are young women, young people, young boys dying, did you know
[1:22:59.740 --> 1:23:04.540]  that the Pfizer shot you took is banned in China and banned in India?
[1:23:04.540 --> 1:23:09.420]  No I did not know that, you know I did some research but obviously I didn't do an intensive
[1:23:09.420 --> 1:23:12.060]  research on it and no I was not aware.
[1:23:12.060 --> 1:23:15.540]  Well it's not your fault, I mean Google, what did you use Google?
[1:23:15.540 --> 1:23:16.540]  I did use Google.
[1:23:16.540 --> 1:23:21.580]  Yeah Google the top hundred pages are just FORTS-fed BS from Big Pharma, they hide all
[1:23:21.580 --> 1:23:27.380]  the real studies, all the real news, I mean if you go to the European news or the Australian
[1:23:27.380 --> 1:23:33.180]  news or the Indian news, it's all over the news over there, it's crazy.
[1:23:33.180 --> 1:23:36.940]  Yeah I'm just so used to using the Google search engine and I use it like most people
[1:23:36.940 --> 1:23:42.620]  do and you know I found some information on it and we went ahead and took the vaccine
[1:23:42.620 --> 1:23:47.980]  you know it was just a week ago, I'm just blessed that I'm here today and talking to
[1:23:47.980 --> 1:23:51.020]  you and the rest of the people know what happened.
[1:23:51.020 --> 1:23:56.100]  Well I don't want to scare you my friend but in the animal studies it hits the heart
[1:23:56.100 --> 1:24:00.940]  and the brain and stuff later and so really you need to, I check in with a doctor, I look
[1:24:00.940 --> 1:24:06.020]  at what some of the medical doctors are saying about dealing with inflammation, I mean I don't
[1:24:06.020 --> 1:24:10.060]  know a medical doctor but I would take turmeric if I was you to deal with inflammation because
[1:24:10.060 --> 1:24:13.380]  you already are probably having some inflamed heart and in your arteries you are a big guy,
[1:24:13.380 --> 1:24:16.980]  if that happens to any big guy and then you get an insult like this vaccine that causes
[1:24:16.980 --> 1:24:20.300]  an immune response, it can be even worse than you, if you were old it might have killed
[1:24:20.300 --> 1:24:25.900]  you, so I'm just really glad that you're okay now and stay in contact with us, any updates?
[1:24:25.900 --> 1:24:28.180]  Call your niece, we'll get you right back on okay?
[1:24:28.180 --> 1:24:30.420]  Absolutely, thank you for having me on.
[1:24:30.420 --> 1:24:33.220]  Alright thank you, that's Coach Pete, he was willing to have his full name on there and
[1:24:33.220 --> 1:24:36.220]  I said brother we're not going to do that to you, the left will harass the living hell
[1:24:36.220 --> 1:24:38.980]  out of you, they'll find out who you are, but there are the medical records, that's
[1:24:38.980 --> 1:24:43.940]  just one more person that this happened to and it's in the literature this happened
[1:24:43.940 --> 1:24:47.380]  to the rats, it happened to the pigs, it happened to other things they tested on and
[1:24:47.380 --> 1:24:51.140]  they said don't give it to humans, that's in the UT study, alright we'll be right back
[1:24:51.140 --> 1:24:55.940]  with, I'll tell you what we'll be right back with when we come back.
[1:24:55.940 --> 1:25:00.100]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast, hell I've been
[1:25:00.100 --> 1:25:04.260]  on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that, but let me tell you the
[1:25:04.260 --> 1:25:08.540]  New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming
[1:25:08.540 --> 1:25:12.340]  after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down, so please pray to keep
[1:25:12.340 --> 1:25:16.540]  Info Wars on the air and please support the local station you're listening to as well,
[1:25:16.540 --> 1:25:22.620]  at the same time go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[1:25:22.620 --> 1:25:27.500]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[1:25:27.500 --> 1:25:28.980]  in the face of this thing.
[1:25:28.980 --> 1:25:33.860]  I need your help more than ever now, I want to keep fighting the globalists but I can't
[1:25:33.860 --> 1:25:35.420]  do it if you don't support us.
[1:25:35.420 --> 1:25:40.820]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast, however you can, and buy great
[1:25:40.820 --> 1:25:46.100]  products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com, whether
[1:25:46.100 --> 1:25:50.740]  it's high quality coffee, for supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[1:25:50.740 --> 1:25:56.780]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God, thank you so much.
[1:25:56.780 --> 1:26:00.420]  When listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and
[1:26:00.420 --> 1:26:05.340]  I say thank you for what you've done, thank you for keeping Info Wars on the air, thank
[1:26:05.340 --> 1:26:08.980]  you for praying for us, and thank you for spreading the word.
[1:26:08.980 --> 1:26:14.540]  If all of you will simply go to infowarstore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone
[1:26:14.540 --> 1:26:19.540]  or a droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you, it will
[1:26:19.540 --> 1:26:24.260]  remind you every day like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and
[1:26:24.260 --> 1:26:25.420]  what you do.
[1:26:25.420 --> 1:26:29.220]  Not because you've done something wrong but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the
[1:26:29.220 --> 1:26:32.860]  globalist are predatory and are evil, and in the surveillance state we need to more
[1:26:32.860 --> 1:26:37.340]  and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved
[1:26:37.340 --> 1:26:38.340]  in.
[1:26:38.340 --> 1:26:42.140]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings, they're available at infowarstore.com in four
[1:26:42.140 --> 1:26:45.180]  different colors, and they are only $19.95.
[1:26:45.180 --> 1:26:49.620]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere, they're available
[1:26:49.620 --> 1:26:52.620]  right now for $19.95 and they fund the Info War.
[1:26:52.620 --> 1:26:57.180]  Please take action today, protect your privacy and fund the Info War.
[1:26:57.180 --> 1:27:02.820]  Others have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are most
[1:27:02.820 --> 1:27:05.540]  of the best selling products you have that we love?
[1:27:05.540 --> 1:27:10.180]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down, I have to either reformulate or I have
[1:27:10.180 --> 1:27:13.700]  to lower the quality to get a lot of these, and so that's why we don't have a lot of
[1:27:13.700 --> 1:27:14.700]  products in.
[1:27:14.700 --> 1:27:18.020]  That's why Info Wars is in financial trouble is because if we had the products, you would
[1:27:18.020 --> 1:27:21.900]  be buying it, we'd have the money, but so many of them have been sold out, just like
[1:27:21.900 --> 1:27:26.020]  you noticed a lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being
[1:27:26.020 --> 1:27:27.420]  artificially imploded.
[1:27:27.420 --> 1:27:33.780]  But finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen, deep earth crystal iodine, so essential
[1:27:33.780 --> 1:27:38.300]  in your body, it's really the missing link, it's 50% off, we've got a big shipment of
[1:27:38.300 --> 1:27:39.300]  it at infowarstore.com.
[1:27:39.300 --> 1:27:43.540]  Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage
[1:27:43.540 --> 1:27:47.860]  of this now, stock up, and don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency to
[1:27:47.860 --> 1:27:52.900]  forget how great it is and not take it myself, but when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight
[1:27:52.900 --> 1:27:56.900]  loss, it's incredible, it's essential, it's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[1:27:56.900 --> 1:28:01.940]  We here at Info Wars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[1:28:01.940 --> 1:28:05.540]  is now available at infowarstore.com.
[1:28:05.540 --> 1:28:09.660]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though
[1:28:09.660 --> 1:28:14.300]  it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and
[1:28:14.300 --> 1:28:15.780]  euphoric effects.
[1:28:15.780 --> 1:28:21.580]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[1:28:21.580 --> 1:28:25.900]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:28:25.900 --> 1:28:30.580]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[1:28:30.580 --> 1:28:31.900]  loosen up a little.
[1:28:31.900 --> 1:28:36.700]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:42.700]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[1:28:42.700 --> 1:28:49.420]  herbs including but not limited to German Kama Mill, Organic Skullcap, and Valerian root.
[1:28:49.420 --> 1:28:56.420]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com.
[1:29:49.420 --> 1:30:07.420]  I believe in you, and I believe that when you hear the bad stuff that's going on, you're
[1:30:07.420 --> 1:30:11.420]  going to warn others we're going to do something about it, we're going to say no, and we've
[1:30:11.420 --> 1:30:17.660]  been doing that, and so with Bolsonaro and Trump and so many others, the globalist program
[1:30:17.660 --> 1:30:26.460]  was in trouble, so they just launched the operation that they had been planning to already
[1:30:26.460 --> 1:30:30.380]  launch down the road at us.
[1:30:30.380 --> 1:30:33.860]  I mean it's all laid out, they'd use a virus to take over, it's all laid out that they're
[1:30:33.860 --> 1:30:38.740]  going to cut off the power and the energy and claim that hackers did it, and that in
[1:30:38.740 --> 1:30:42.820]  the future everything's going to be unstable and there's going to be flash mobs and implantable
[1:30:42.820 --> 1:30:47.500]  microchips and you won't be able to be hired by a corporation unless you have a brain chip
[1:30:47.500 --> 1:30:52.700]  and that the hackers and the instability is actually going to help bring in the new world
[1:30:52.700 --> 1:30:59.500]  system, and then it's in all the different John Hopkins documents, and I've got a whole
[1:30:59.500 --> 1:31:04.860]  stack up on my desk I'll get during the break, I forgot to bring in here, and I'll cover
[1:31:04.860 --> 1:31:10.460]  that next segment, but that's what this is, and then there's Biden shutting down the Keystone
[1:31:10.460 --> 1:31:19.260]  Pipeline that supplies the Colonial Pipeline, 15 years of the making, they shut it off right
[1:31:19.260 --> 1:31:25.300]  when it's completed, and then now this is shut off by a nebulous hacker group with no
[1:31:25.300 --> 1:31:31.700]  evidence, and then Whitmer shuts down a giant pipeline, ordering it shut down out of Canada
[1:31:31.700 --> 1:31:38.860]  that's been there 67 years under treaty, she says I don't care what the treaty says, we're
[1:31:38.860 --> 1:31:47.660]  doing it, so this shows how delicate modern civilization is with just on time delivery,
[1:31:47.660 --> 1:31:51.900]  and it makes things so convenient, but for the technocrats they're able to manipulate
[1:31:51.900 --> 1:31:56.380]  that and get total power and control, and it's not like I just came up here this week
[1:31:56.380 --> 1:32:01.820]  and said Biden's behind this pipeline, any of you that listen on a regular basis know
[1:32:01.820 --> 1:32:09.460]  that on January 21st I went on air and since then probably 200 times, and it holds segments
[1:32:09.460 --> 1:32:14.340]  on they're going to implode the borders, they're going to shut off the power, they're
[1:32:14.340 --> 1:32:22.540]  going to claim hackers did it, and they are going to stage mass shootings, and they are
[1:32:22.540 --> 1:32:28.940]  going to manipulate and attack local infrastructures, and only the big mega banks and big mega
[1:32:28.940 --> 1:32:33.220]  box stores will be able to stay open, and as they flood all this free money, that will
[1:32:33.220 --> 1:32:37.260]  keep people from working while the rest of the infrastructure that could employ them
[1:32:37.260 --> 1:32:42.620]  in the future dies, and then all that is left is the globalist infrastructure, and then
[1:32:42.620 --> 1:32:47.140]  it takes over completely, and then can dictate how you live your life and what you do.
[1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:52.180]  An example, what have I said probably 5,000 times in 27 years, once they bring in a casual
[1:32:52.180 --> 1:32:57.940]  society and you have a guaranteed universal income, they will dictate socially how you
[1:32:57.940 --> 1:33:03.420]  behave and what you do to get that income up, you sterilize yourself, it goes up, you
[1:33:03.420 --> 1:33:13.220]  cut your son's testicles off, you get 20,000 credits put in there, how do I know all that?
[1:33:13.220 --> 1:33:18.660]  Because I read it in their blueprints and their different scenarios, it's their world,
[1:33:18.660 --> 1:33:24.420]  we're just living in it until we start admitting this to ourselves and doing something about
[1:33:24.420 --> 1:33:25.420]  it.
[1:33:25.420 --> 1:33:29.420]  So I'm constantly frustrated, and I'm not bitching.
[1:33:29.420 --> 1:33:37.260]  The crew is awesome, I'm like an old man to them, both good and bad, but I'm not pleased
[1:33:37.260 --> 1:33:42.100]  about this, I'm not pleased that I'm the main opposition to them, and I'm not pleased that
[1:33:42.100 --> 1:33:46.380]  I've got so much credibility now, and I'm not pleased that I've got to say the things
[1:33:46.380 --> 1:33:58.420]  nobody else will say, of course Fauci and Schwab and Prince Charles and Gates need to be up
[1:33:58.420 --> 1:34:00.260]  on war crimes charges.
[1:34:00.260 --> 1:34:04.380]  I mean, Prince Charles is quarterbacking this whole damn thing, I'm going to read in the
[1:34:04.380 --> 1:34:14.180]  Chronicle 10 years ago how he did a hologram to South by Southwest to tell people to stop
[1:34:14.180 --> 1:34:21.700]  commuting, and then the future will only commute by hologram.
[1:34:21.700 --> 1:34:26.380]  And now he's praising the great reset, and now it's going to make you all poor to control
[1:34:26.380 --> 1:34:27.380]  you.
[1:34:27.380 --> 1:34:31.660]  He's a feudalist, that's what he's done for over a thousand years to his subjects, his
[1:34:31.660 --> 1:34:35.140]  family's done that.
[1:34:35.140 --> 1:34:42.420]  Over a thousand years, he is the direct heir of the Anglo-Saxons, and you hear about Anglo
[1:34:42.420 --> 1:34:45.820]  Saxons, the media calls that anybody that's white from Europe.
[1:34:45.820 --> 1:34:56.140]  Anglo-Saxons were one tribe of Vikings that took over Europe.
[1:34:56.140 --> 1:35:01.380]  He's related to William the Conqueror, who's an Anglo-Saxon, and the Anglo-Saxons before
[1:35:01.380 --> 1:35:07.380]  him.
[1:35:07.380 --> 1:35:10.300]  God help us.
[1:35:10.300 --> 1:35:13.700]  God help us.
[1:35:13.700 --> 1:35:22.700]  These people are murderous as the day is long, and this is their plan.
[1:35:22.700 --> 1:35:25.740]  They tell you they're going to turn the power off, they tell you post industrial world,
[1:35:25.740 --> 1:35:32.940]  George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to that agreement in 1992 for agenda 21.
[1:35:32.940 --> 1:35:37.700]  Now we're under agenda 2030, and Obama signed us on to that.
[1:35:37.700 --> 1:35:43.780]  Trump tried to block it, they're raging forward, and yes, Trump went along with the vaccines.
[1:35:43.780 --> 1:35:51.060]  That's a terrible thing, but aren't you glad that Trump just routed out Lynn Cheney, Cheney's
[1:35:51.060 --> 1:35:55.140]  daughter, little warmonger that actually ran some of the war over there?
[1:35:55.140 --> 1:36:01.220]  Aren't, the State Department, aren't you glad that Trump's going to get pro-gun, pro-America
[1:36:01.220 --> 1:36:02.980]  people elected all over the country?
[1:36:02.980 --> 1:36:04.580]  I'm not defending his vaccine push.
[1:36:04.580 --> 1:36:09.380]  I'm just saying this Lynn Cheney thing is a very, very positive and good development,
[1:36:09.380 --> 1:36:13.260]  and there's other big positive developments I'm going to get to when we come back.
[1:36:13.260 --> 1:36:20.100]  When I lay out the latest on the infrastructure shutdown and how to stop it, and we look at
[1:36:20.100 --> 1:36:23.940]  Liz Cheney, and we look at the open borders, and we look at a lot more.
[1:36:23.940 --> 1:36:30.100]  Ahead of Pastor Artur Pulaski out of jail, arrested for preaching in Canada, we'll give
[1:36:30.100 --> 1:36:34.700]  us a brief update next hour, and then I'm going to open the phones up and take your phone
[1:36:34.700 --> 1:36:40.620]  calls, then I host the fourth hour with one of the most important hours we've ever done.
[1:36:40.620 --> 1:36:45.980]  With the former Chief Prosecutor from the United Nations that tried Slobomilosevic and others,
[1:36:45.980 --> 1:36:50.300]  the man that wrote the U.S. Biological Weapons Law, the guy that helped contribute to world
[1:36:50.300 --> 1:36:51.300]  law.
[1:36:51.300 --> 1:36:56.740]  I'll ask you if I went too far saying I believe Cheney, Oop, Freudian slip, he called for
[1:36:56.740 --> 1:37:02.300]  the use of race-specific bio-weapons in the PNAC April 2000 document, Rebuilding America's
[1:37:02.300 --> 1:37:03.300]  Defenses.
[1:37:03.300 --> 1:37:05.300]  So even when I get a name wrong, it's right.
[1:37:05.300 --> 1:37:09.940]  I'm going to talk about Obama, I'm going to talk about Biden, I say Obama, that's not
[1:37:09.940 --> 1:37:10.940]  on purpose.
[1:37:10.940 --> 1:37:14.580]  It just comes out because my brain is so trained to say the truth that even when they've got
[1:37:14.580 --> 1:37:18.260]  a lie, I'll just replace it with the truth, that's how my brain just automatically works
[1:37:18.260 --> 1:37:19.260]  now.
[1:37:19.260 --> 1:37:23.660]  Just totally turning it over to reality and truth and just approximation and analysis
[1:37:23.660 --> 1:37:26.060]  and understanding.
[1:37:26.060 --> 1:37:29.260]  And again, I digress.
[1:37:29.260 --> 1:37:35.700]  I don't call him Biden, I call him Obeyed or O'Harris because that's who is really running
[1:37:35.700 --> 1:37:36.700]  things.
[1:37:36.700 --> 1:37:40.500]  And they hate this country dearly, everything they've done is to ship the jobs out and shut
[1:37:40.500 --> 1:37:44.700]  us down and break up our families and ship in fentanyl and bring in giant, third world,
[1:37:44.700 --> 1:37:48.700]  dependent populations of women with children, is to weigh the country down its clowered in
[1:37:48.700 --> 1:37:49.700]  heaven.
[1:37:49.700 --> 1:37:52.900]  And you're seeing the plan, they're making a real run at us.
[1:37:52.900 --> 1:37:59.700]  There's more than 14 pipelines, Biden's already turned off in the U.S., not just this one.
[1:37:59.700 --> 1:38:01.940]  Of course he turned it off.
[1:38:01.940 --> 1:38:05.780]  We're under attack and they're getting you used to it because next time, it won't be
[1:38:05.780 --> 1:38:11.580]  a week you're out of power, it'll be two weeks, a month, they're bringing you to your knees
[1:38:11.580 --> 1:38:14.620]  so America's over.
[1:38:14.620 --> 1:38:19.540]  We're being conquered and that's why everybody better get prepared and get ready.
[1:38:19.540 --> 1:38:26.060]  Today's the last day to get 2,020 prices on swarble foods ready to ship to you from five
[1:38:26.060 --> 1:38:27.060]  distribution centers.
[1:38:27.060 --> 1:38:28.940]  You order today, it's shipped out tomorrow.
[1:38:28.940 --> 1:38:33.140]  Hundreds of specialty foods, six months, three months, your supplies, they've got water
[1:38:33.140 --> 1:38:37.340]  filtration, air filtration, everything, and prepare with Alex.com where you find the best
[1:38:37.340 --> 1:38:39.660]  food at the lowest prices with an additional 10% off.
[1:38:39.660 --> 1:38:43.340]  And here's the big news, they told us a week ago, they said, hey, you got to end this sale,
[1:38:43.340 --> 1:38:47.420]  you only run it for a week or so, but you know this, we got to go up, everybody else
[1:38:47.420 --> 1:38:49.100]  is already gone up, they're going to go up.
[1:38:49.100 --> 1:38:51.580]  So you're not just hitting last year's prices, it's going to go up.
[1:38:51.580 --> 1:38:56.100]  Get it now, don't wait, prepare with Alex.com, we'll be right back.
[1:38:56.100 --> 1:39:02.620]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia with no evidence for the shutdown
[1:39:02.620 --> 1:39:07.740]  of the East Coast gasoline pipeline that goes from Houston right up through New York City
[1:39:07.740 --> 1:39:10.580]  and supplies more than half of the gasoline at the East Coast.
[1:39:10.580 --> 1:39:15.460]  But who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline from Canada through the Midwest
[1:39:15.460 --> 1:39:20.620]  to Houston to refine the oil that's then turned into gas at some of the East Coast?
[1:39:20.620 --> 1:39:25.940]  That's right, Joe Biden shut down the keystone pipeline right after it was completed.
[1:39:25.940 --> 1:39:30.580]  Joe Biden did that to America, he has the history, he has the background, he's the one
[1:39:30.580 --> 1:39:35.020]  that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels, he's the one that's tried to extend
[1:39:35.020 --> 1:39:37.980]  the lockdowns of the country.
[1:39:37.980 --> 1:39:42.060]  Remember ladies and gentlemen, that the new world order wants a post industrial world,
[1:39:42.060 --> 1:39:46.540]  and they want the United States, Europe and Australia crippled so communist China can't
[1:39:46.540 --> 1:39:47.540]  be dominant.
[1:39:47.540 --> 1:39:52.100]  It's not Russia that's the enemy, it's communist China, and there are millions like Joe Biden
[1:39:52.100 --> 1:39:56.020]  in control of the White House, that's the facts, that's the information.
[1:39:56.020 --> 1:40:04.540]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at
[1:40:04.540 --> 1:40:07.820]  surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil, we've got the
[1:40:07.820 --> 1:40:08.820]  best out there.
[1:40:08.820 --> 1:40:14.260]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available, and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[1:40:14.260 --> 1:40:17.420]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does, and it costs us even more to put
[1:40:17.420 --> 1:40:21.360]  it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it, so this is also clean
[1:40:21.360 --> 1:40:22.360]  fish oil.
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:25.260]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock, 50% off.
[1:40:25.260 --> 1:40:30.100]  Grill oil is sent to sell out, it's amazing as well, it's at 25% off, but when you get
[1:40:30.100 --> 1:40:34.340]  them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.
[1:40:34.340 --> 1:40:39.420]  Get your fish oil back in stock at infoarstore.com, and when I forget to take it, I really feel
[1:40:39.420 --> 1:40:42.820]  it, but I take a couple of them before I go to sleep at night, it makes my dreams even
[1:40:42.820 --> 1:40:43.820]  more amazing.
[1:40:43.820 --> 1:40:47.460]  Unless you thought I was joking, you've tried it out and most of you have been blown away.

[1:40:52.620 --> 1:40:56.980]  fish oil, infoarstore.com, infoarstore.com, infoarstore.com.
[1:40:56.980 --> 1:41:02.100]  I'm driving home at 7 o'clock at night on Monday night to see my family, and I just
[1:41:02.100 --> 1:41:06.420]  remember there's only two days left for our wonderful listeners to get incredibly high
[1:41:06.420 --> 1:41:11.860]  quality, storeable food at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere at fairwithalix.com.
[1:41:11.860 --> 1:41:16.740]  These are 20, 20 prices for a limited time for our listeners, and then the price isn't
[1:41:16.740 --> 1:41:19.340]  just going to go back to regular, it's going to have to go up.
[1:41:19.340 --> 1:41:23.340]  Everybody else has already raised prices way more than my Patreon.
[1:41:23.340 --> 1:41:28.940]  We have their entire spectrum and catalog at infoarstore.com, fairwithalix.com.
[1:41:28.940 --> 1:41:34.260]  You get an additional 10% off on three months, six months, your supplies, and everything
[1:41:34.260 --> 1:41:36.340]  else on the site.
[1:41:36.340 --> 1:41:38.340]  Preparewithalix.com.
[1:41:38.340 --> 1:41:42.220]  I would take advantage of this, but what's happening in food prices increases around
[1:41:42.220 --> 1:41:43.220]  the world.
[1:41:43.220 --> 1:41:47.180]  I predict that by the fall you're going to see major shortages, and you're going to
[1:41:47.180 --> 1:41:48.940]  see huge price increases.
[1:41:48.940 --> 1:41:52.860]  I think it's a smart bet right now to get high quality, storeable food at last year's
[1:41:52.860 --> 1:41:57.580]  prices while you still can at preparewithalix.com.
[1:41:57.580 --> 1:42:02.860]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting
[1:42:02.860 --> 1:42:08.820]  patients, hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women, and children
[1:42:08.820 --> 1:42:15.100]  with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing
[1:42:15.100 --> 1:42:17.580]  many of the test subjects.
[1:42:17.580 --> 1:42:21.620]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made.
[1:42:21.620 --> 1:42:25.260]  Fourteen years ago we tracked and documented the Bilderberg Group's activities and their
[1:42:25.260 --> 1:42:28.620]  plan for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[1:42:28.620 --> 1:42:30.140]  The film now is more important than ever.
[1:42:30.140 --> 1:42:33.100]  When it's shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[1:42:33.100 --> 1:42:37.860]  We have it back in print, available now at infowarsstore.com, selling them as low as
[1:42:37.860 --> 1:42:42.180]  $3.95 a piece with a bottom and bulk, and there's a zero country code, so anywhere on
[1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:43.180]  the planet you can make copies.
[1:42:43.180 --> 1:42:45.060]  In fact, I want you to make copies.
[1:42:45.060 --> 1:42:50.940]  You are the Paul Revere's, 1776 worldwide, 1776 worldwide in-game blueprint for global
[1:42:50.940 --> 1:43:00.140]  enslavement, available now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:43:00.140 --> 1:43:16.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:43:16.700 --> 1:43:22.340]  Coming through the lies and disinformation, we now take you live to the Central Texas
[1:43:22.340 --> 1:43:44.700]  Command Center and the heart of the resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[1:43:44.700 --> 1:43:50.900]  When Obama did win via propaganda and brainwashing his first two terms, he did not win his third
[1:43:50.900 --> 1:43:56.860]  term that he's serving right now through his puppets, his placeholders that are Kamala
[1:43:56.860 --> 1:44:03.860]  Harris, a true moron, and of course, a corrupt lawyer who once was smart and very cunning,
[1:44:03.860 --> 1:44:06.940]  but now out of his mind, and that is, of course, Joe Biden.
[1:44:06.940 --> 1:44:11.700]  But make no mistake, I know people that are involved at the highest levels, Obama actually
[1:44:11.700 --> 1:44:13.580]  calls a lot of shots in the global system.
[1:44:13.580 --> 1:44:18.780]  He's not the final highest level of the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, and others, but he's actually
[1:44:18.780 --> 1:44:19.780]  in command.
[1:44:19.780 --> 1:44:25.940]  He's actually carrying on operations, and he is very smart and very evil.
[1:44:25.940 --> 1:44:30.540]  And he hates this country with a passion, and they always hate the Midwest.
[1:44:30.540 --> 1:44:31.620]  They always hate the South.
[1:44:31.620 --> 1:44:32.820]  They're turning your power off.
[1:44:32.820 --> 1:44:33.820]  They turned your power off.
[1:44:33.820 --> 1:44:38.820]  My God, you think they just turned Keystone off to play games?
[1:44:38.820 --> 1:44:39.820]  During the break, I was searching it.
[1:44:39.820 --> 1:44:41.220]  Actually, let me report on this.
[1:44:41.220 --> 1:44:43.860]  I'm sorry.
[1:44:43.860 --> 1:44:52.300]  I said 14, 15 pipelines have been shut down since he got it off as 115 days ago.
[1:44:52.300 --> 1:44:57.460]  Over 1,000 pipelines have been canceled in the U.S., excuse me.
[1:44:57.460 --> 1:44:58.980]  That's the latest number.
[1:44:58.980 --> 1:45:06.140]  That's mainstream news, 1,000, and that's because they canceled drilling permits all
[1:45:06.140 --> 1:45:12.900]  over the United States, 60% of drilling permits have just been canceled.
[1:45:12.900 --> 1:45:17.860]  Did you hear what I just said?
[1:45:17.860 --> 1:45:19.300]  And now they're talking about shutting the rest down.
[1:45:19.300 --> 1:45:25.980]  So when he said we're going to bankrupt fossil fuel, we're going to end fossil fuel, they're
[1:45:25.980 --> 1:45:30.260]  not playing games, ladies and gentlemen, and they're not going to let you replace it either.
[1:45:30.260 --> 1:45:33.740]  This is the collapse.
[1:45:33.740 --> 1:45:42.460]  So it's 14 big pipelines he shut down, and now there's the fourth largest pipeline system
[1:45:42.460 --> 1:45:44.980]  in the United States.
[1:45:44.980 --> 1:45:45.980]  Keystone was the biggest.
[1:45:45.980 --> 1:45:46.980]  It never opened.
[1:45:46.980 --> 1:45:52.420]  Colonial is what the third largest, but the one in Michigan, they argue, was the fourth
[1:45:52.420 --> 1:46:01.780]  or fifth biggest pipeline system, there's five of them, thousands of miles of it, and
[1:46:01.780 --> 1:46:07.820]  the choke point is the Michigan-Canadian border.
[1:46:07.820 --> 1:46:16.740]  And Whitmer's ordered it turned off, she doesn't even have the damn power, the Enbridge pipeline.
[1:46:16.740 --> 1:46:17.740]  Can't make that up, can you?
[1:46:17.740 --> 1:46:22.380]  That's war, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:46:22.380 --> 1:46:23.500]  And what are all these states doing?
[1:46:23.500 --> 1:46:35.220]  They're passing laws outlawing the sale of combustion engines in 2030, and it goes on
[1:46:35.220 --> 1:46:39.220]  and on and on and on.
[1:46:39.220 --> 1:46:43.100]  But China builds a new coal power plant every three days.
[1:46:43.100 --> 1:46:46.500]  Mexico builds one every couple of weeks.
[1:46:46.500 --> 1:46:48.860]  India builds them every week.
[1:46:48.860 --> 1:46:53.020]  They're all open for business, and they run dirty plants with no scrubbers.
[1:46:53.020 --> 1:46:57.420]  They're 100% clean, except carbon dioxide and water vapor, so they name carbon dioxide
[1:46:57.420 --> 1:46:58.820]  a toxic waste.
[1:46:58.820 --> 1:46:59.820]  This is war.
[1:46:59.820 --> 1:47:02.860]  You know, listeners used to freak out on me and say, why do you harp on them?
[1:47:02.860 --> 1:47:04.580]  Obama's shutting down all the coal plants.
[1:47:04.580 --> 1:47:05.580]  Who cares?
[1:47:05.580 --> 1:47:07.460]  I'm not working at a coal plant.
[1:47:07.460 --> 1:47:11.940]  That's how you get cheap energy, ding dong.
[1:47:11.940 --> 1:47:18.340]  And if you don't have cheap energy, we're not open for business, and then we're bye-bye.
[1:47:18.340 --> 1:47:22.340]  And yes, they've got all sorts of clean, unlimited energy they're suppressing, but they're not
[1:47:22.340 --> 1:47:24.740]  going to let us have that.
[1:47:24.740 --> 1:47:30.460]  We know about coal and oil and natural gas, so they're taking it away.
[1:47:30.460 --> 1:47:32.820]  Yeah, there's Wuhan in the afternoon.
[1:47:32.820 --> 1:47:41.140]  Yeah, I roll some footage of what it looks like in China, where they use more coal than
[1:47:41.140 --> 1:47:46.620]  169 other countries combined.
[1:47:46.620 --> 1:47:51.460]  They have more greenhouse gas emissions than any other country in the world, and they're
[1:47:51.460 --> 1:47:56.940]  not shutting it down, and they're not even putting a scrubber on it.
[1:47:56.940 --> 1:48:04.300]  For those that don't know, a coal power plant in the U.S. since the 90s is completely clean.
[1:48:04.300 --> 1:48:08.020]  They have scrubbers, all those tubes that look like a battleship hooked up to the side
[1:48:08.020 --> 1:48:09.020]  of it.
[1:48:09.020 --> 1:48:11.860]  You know, an old-fashioned coal plant, so a smokestack and a building with a water turbine
[1:48:11.860 --> 1:48:12.860]  that turns a turbine.
[1:48:12.860 --> 1:48:16.700]  It's just like hydroelectric, but the steam turns the turbine.
[1:48:16.700 --> 1:48:22.940]  Now, when you look at China, it's just that, like we used to have, but by the 70s they
[1:48:22.940 --> 1:48:24.820]  had scrubbers on it.
[1:48:24.820 --> 1:48:28.860]  By the 90s, they were completely clean, with sensors on the top of smokestacks.
[1:48:28.860 --> 1:48:31.220]  China doesn't do that, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:48:31.220 --> 1:48:35.940]  They burn dirty coal with mercury in it, and then it gets into the atmosphere and comes
[1:48:35.940 --> 1:48:38.580]  down over the United States.
[1:48:38.580 --> 1:48:42.540]  We're lined up on the same parallel with them.
[1:48:42.540 --> 1:48:48.020]  In fact, that's one reason I love Texas, but I think I might move out here at least part
[1:48:48.020 --> 1:48:51.900]  of the year, because this child of me used to have my four-year-old here.
[1:48:51.900 --> 1:48:57.020]  You know the jet stream that goes over southern China, where most of their plants are?
[1:48:57.020 --> 1:49:01.460]  Because 90% of the Chinese population is all on its coasts in the south, almost no one
[1:49:01.460 --> 1:49:02.460]  in the east.
[1:49:02.460 --> 1:49:05.740]  Those that are there are in slave camps for apple, death camps.
[1:49:05.740 --> 1:49:07.500]  Seriously, but it's liberal.
[1:49:07.500 --> 1:49:10.020]  So Tim Cook's case, it's kind of cool.
[1:49:10.020 --> 1:49:15.620]  And I'm kind of digressing here, I have a lot of other things to cover, but the jet
[1:49:15.620 --> 1:49:20.860]  stream dumps in over New Mexico and Louisiana, and the main place where it normally is dumping
[1:49:20.860 --> 1:49:27.660]  into about 2,000 feet, just normally at 35,000 feet jet stream, it dumps in because it goes
[1:49:27.660 --> 1:49:33.900]  all around the planet, but that band of the jet stream that goes over China and then comes
[1:49:33.900 --> 1:49:40.580]  right over the United States, dumps on Texas.
[1:49:40.580 --> 1:49:45.900]  People are like, I got really bad allergies, man, why is Texas got such bad allergies now?
[1:49:45.900 --> 1:49:54.140]  Those aren't allergies sweetheart, that's toxic waste, but it's Chinese, so it's not
[1:49:54.140 --> 1:49:55.140]  bad.
[1:49:55.140 --> 1:50:00.060]  Okay, if it was American, it would be bad, if it's Chinese, it's good.
[1:50:00.060 --> 1:50:04.100]  The globalists are all invested there, and they love it, and it's a great thing, and
[1:50:04.100 --> 1:50:07.180]  so everybody moving to Texas thinking, man, this is the best place on earth, I just look
[1:50:07.180 --> 1:50:08.180]  at them, I am.
[1:50:08.180 --> 1:50:12.300]  I was telling Joe Rogan at dinner like a month ago, I said, you know, the jet stream dumps
[1:50:12.300 --> 1:50:16.740]  over Texas, he was having a good time eating the steak, and I said, just never mind, never
[1:50:16.740 --> 1:50:20.060]  mind, just enjoy yourself.
[1:50:20.060 --> 1:50:29.060]  Just enjoy yourself, have yourself a merry little lung cancer, have yourself some Alzheimer's
[1:50:29.060 --> 1:50:36.300]  too, but our plants are all being shut down, they're totally clean, oh, but see, we only
[1:50:36.300 --> 1:50:40.540]  know about discrimination, we've got John Oliver Slam's white people over ignorance
[1:50:40.540 --> 1:50:44.580]  of black hairstyles, and he just makes up something that whites don't like blacks because
[1:50:44.580 --> 1:50:48.060]  they have curly hair, what the hell does that even mean?
[1:50:48.060 --> 1:50:51.940]  You know, we don't care about open borders and global disease and poisonous vaccines
[1:50:51.940 --> 1:50:56.980]  killing us and people dropping dead everywhere and world government and New World Order and
[1:50:56.980 --> 1:51:02.220]  all the rest of it, no, no, no, no, John Oliver has white people and black people fighting
[1:51:02.220 --> 1:51:10.620]  over hairstyles, it's like an alternate dimension when you watch it, and we have the pastor
[1:51:10.620 --> 1:51:14.660]  arrested now out of jail, popping in for a segment or two, and then I want to give the
[1:51:14.660 --> 1:51:15.660]  number out.

[1:51:23.700 --> 1:51:30.340]  the videos of the head of the project under Fauci saying they created a five virus, superbug,
[1:51:30.340 --> 1:51:34.820]  Fauci lying to Congress thing, they never funded Gain of Function, it was a huge controversy,
[1:51:34.820 --> 1:51:38.660]  it's all on record, they did it, on the NIH website, they said they funded Gain of Function,
[1:51:38.660 --> 1:51:48.900]  I have all those documents, coming up fourth hour with Dr. Boyle, the toll-free number to
[1:51:48.900 --> 1:51:58.340]  join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789, Alex, 877-789-2539, I think when we into the show, Monday when
[1:51:58.340 --> 1:52:02.300]  I took calls, there was three or four folks still on hold, so we want to call them back,
[1:52:02.300 --> 1:52:06.820]  put them up for the line, if they answer the phone, we'll go to them first, 877-789-2539,
[1:52:06.820 --> 1:52:11.340]  so here's the good news, people are waking up, here's the bad news, the globalists have
[1:52:11.340 --> 1:52:15.340]  launched their main assault, and it's going to be the slow control, collapse of civilization,
[1:52:15.340 --> 1:52:18.660]  they're going to claim third party hackers did it, I didn't just tell you this this week,
[1:52:18.660 --> 1:52:24.260]  I told you this years ago, they basically admit they're doing it, and when they don't
[1:52:24.260 --> 1:52:29.980]  have that, they'll just overtly order things shut down, wouldn't let Texas have its power
[1:52:29.980 --> 1:52:35.900]  turned up under federal regulations when the storm was coming, but over there they had
[1:52:35.900 --> 1:52:44.460]  Infra-Guard or News-Guard and all those other groups, see what News-Guard is, coming out
[1:52:44.460 --> 1:52:50.420]  and saying I'm a liar, like I said, India didn't ban the Pfizer shot, that's a lie,
[1:52:50.420 --> 1:52:54.900]  that's totally true, Bill Gates' organization said I'm a liar, oh wow Bill Gates, what a
[1:52:54.900 --> 1:53:00.900]  nice man, well every word comes out of his mouth when he's not hanging around with the
[1:53:00.900 --> 1:53:09.180]  old pedos, so that's all coming up in the next hour, there's also all these super models
[1:53:09.180 --> 1:53:15.060]  sending pictures of themselves and bikinis to Bill Gates, and I wanted to tell those
[1:53:15.060 --> 1:53:22.540]  women, I don't think you're young enough for him or Jeffrey Epstein sweetheart, but anyways
[1:53:22.540 --> 1:53:26.580]  I was interested to investigate that though, so we've got some, it was hard work but I

[1:55:50.140 --> 1:56:07.500]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:56:07.500 --> 1:56:12.620]  All right, we're going to get an update from Pastor Arthur Pulaski who got arrested over
[1:56:12.620 --> 1:56:15.180]  the weekend for holding an illegal church service in Canada.
[1:56:15.180 --> 1:56:19.260]  Now this isn't the onion, this is actually happening all over Canada.
[1:56:19.260 --> 1:56:21.420]  You'll learn more from him next segment.
[1:56:21.420 --> 1:56:34.260]  Then I'm opening the phones up at 877-789-2539-877-789-2539, and I'm really excited about hearing from
[1:56:34.260 --> 1:56:38.060]  him because I know it's making his church explode, and that's what really scares the
[1:56:38.060 --> 1:56:42.820]  globalist is more and more the stuff they're doing is simply backfiring.
[1:56:42.820 --> 1:56:47.380]  So as long as we fight back peacefully like he's doing, it's only going to get that much
[1:56:47.380 --> 1:56:48.380]  worse for them.
[1:56:48.380 --> 1:56:52.300]  I want to air a very important report before we talk to him though about the harassment
[1:56:52.300 --> 1:56:58.460]  of people in general using the hysteria of COVID to put us into a type of martial law.
[1:56:58.460 --> 1:57:00.260]  But first, talk about excitement.
[1:57:00.260 --> 1:57:02.460]  Our listeners are loving it.
[1:57:02.460 --> 1:57:06.900]  Infowarsphone.com, when the cell towers go down along with power failure, satellite phones
[1:57:06.900 --> 1:57:07.900]  will still work.
[1:57:07.900 --> 1:57:11.940]  Cell phones are always tracking and logging everything you go and everything you do.
[1:57:11.940 --> 1:57:13.740]  Satellite phones do not have this issue.
[1:57:13.740 --> 1:57:17.860]  Satellite phones work in any extreme remote location, you can see the sky that will work.

[1:57:47.620 --> 1:57:51.100]  out there and it supports our broadcast, they are an awesome sponsor.
[1:57:51.100 --> 1:57:54.340]  Here is the special report, we'll be back with Pastor Pulaski.
[1:57:54.340 --> 1:57:59.700]  We have made the deliberate decision to temporarily enhance police officers authority for the
[1:57:59.700 --> 1:58:02.500]  duration of the stay at home order.
[1:58:02.500 --> 1:58:07.780]  Moving forward, police will have the authority to require any individual who is not in a
[1:58:07.780 --> 1:58:13.980]  place of residence to first provide their purpose for not being at home and provide
[1:58:13.980 --> 1:58:16.060]  their home address.
[1:58:16.060 --> 1:58:20.820]  Police will also have the authority to stop a vehicle to inquire about an individual's
[1:58:20.820 --> 1:58:23.300]  reason for leaving their residence.
[1:58:23.300 --> 1:58:28.940]  Stay home, keep your distance or now pay the price.
[1:58:28.940 --> 1:58:34.180]  Police with axes and assault rifles raided this venue in Sao Paolo and found about 600
[1:58:34.180 --> 1:58:36.300]  party goers, most without masks.
[1:58:36.300 --> 1:58:40.820]  It was a case of asking people to go home and if they didn't arrest them.
[1:58:40.820 --> 1:58:45.140]  Nine police checkpoints have now been set up around the perimeter of Auckland as it's
[1:58:45.140 --> 1:58:49.100]  1.6 million residents returned to level 3 lockdown.
[1:58:49.100 --> 1:58:54.580]  This is the video that raised questions about how New York City is enforcing social distancing.
[1:58:54.580 --> 1:58:58.100]  The man was handcuffed in the stands for not wearing a mask.
[1:58:58.100 --> 1:59:02.180]  Disturbing video showing a violent clash between apparent social distancing violators
[1:59:02.180 --> 1:59:04.900]  and police in Brooklyn.
[1:59:04.900 --> 1:59:09.260]  And this cell phone video capturing the moment an officer waves a taser and repeatedly strikes
[1:59:09.260 --> 1:59:12.020]  a bystander during the social distancing bust.
[1:59:12.020 --> 1:59:24.380]  Get your hands off of me, you are kidnapping me, I have got nothing illegal.
[1:59:24.380 --> 1:59:29.460]  Canadians are being hit with penalties now as governments move to reinforce the shutdowns
[1:59:29.460 --> 1:59:30.460]  right across the country.
[1:59:30.460 --> 1:59:33.420]  And the city is also taking their mask mandate seriously.
[1:59:33.420 --> 1:59:37.420]  A fire rescue commissioner from the Tampa area was arrested on Duvall Street Wednesday
[1:59:37.420 --> 1:59:39.980]  night when he and others were spotted without masks.
[1:59:39.980 --> 1:59:44.260]  It's more than just a suggestion, it is a CDC recommendation that it's all become sort
[1:59:44.260 --> 1:59:48.060]  of like lock law that you can't really trifle with.
[1:59:48.060 --> 1:59:55.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, this gathering is unfortunately unlawful under the coronavirus regulations
[1:59:55.300 --> 1:59:56.500]  we have currently.
[1:59:56.500 --> 1:59:58.900]  The officer explains that she's being arrested.
[1:59:58.900 --> 2:00:05.020]  When she continues to resist, he uses his taser.
[2:00:05.020 --> 2:00:06.020]  Put your hands right here.
[2:00:06.020 --> 2:00:11.300]  Yes, you are, I will take you right now.
[2:00:11.300 --> 2:00:12.300]  What disturbance did I cause?
[2:00:12.300 --> 2:00:13.300]  What date?
[2:00:13.300 --> 2:00:14.300]  March 12th at Longos.
[2:00:14.300 --> 2:00:15.300]  March 12th at Longos.
[2:00:15.300 --> 2:00:17.300]  How did I cause a disturbance?
[2:00:17.300 --> 2:00:21.140]  I claimed a mask exemption and I did my shopping and I left.
[2:00:21.140 --> 2:00:23.260]  So you cannot arrest me, I'm not getting out of the car.
[2:00:23.260 --> 2:00:30.340]  They've locked off the entire f***ing street with pop cars, SUVs, pop cars, blocked streets,
[2:00:30.340 --> 2:00:55.340]  full stands.
[2:00:55.340 --> 2:01:01.020]  Sures have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are most
[2:01:01.020 --> 2:01:03.780]  of the best selling products you have that we love?
[2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:08.460]  My answer is the supply chain has broken down, I have to either reformulate or I have to
[2:01:08.460 --> 2:01:10.480]  lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[2:01:10.480 --> 2:01:12.480]  That's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[2:01:12.480 --> 2:01:16.320]  That's why MHRW is in financial trouble, is because if we had the product you would be
[2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:18.040]  buying it, we would have the money.
[2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:21.940]  But so many of them have been sold out, just like you know there are a lot of other items
[2:01:21.940 --> 2:01:25.220]  aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[2:01:25.220 --> 2:01:29.540]  But, finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen,
[2:01:29.540 --> 2:01:33.500]  Deep Earth Crystal iodide, so essential in your body, it's really the missing link.
[2:01:33.500 --> 2:01:37.980]  It's 50% off. We've got a big shipment of it at M4store.com.
[2:01:37.980 --> 2:01:40.860]  Now, when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price,
[2:01:40.860 --> 2:01:44.260]  take advantage of this now, stock up, and don't forget to take your X2,
[2:01:44.260 --> 2:01:48.100]  because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[2:01:48.100 --> 2:01:51.740]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[2:01:51.740 --> 2:01:54.580]  It's essential. It's X2 at M4store.com.
[2:02:21.740 --> 2:02:25.660]  The hundreds of police stations at them in riot gear,
[2:02:25.660 --> 2:02:30.300]  it costs millions and millions of Canadian dollars a month,
[2:02:30.300 --> 2:02:36.260]  putting up fences around them, and black tarts, you can't even see the devilish crosses.
[2:02:36.260 --> 2:02:39.940]  This is something, and if we told you this two years ago, you wouldn't believe it would be happening.
[2:02:39.940 --> 2:02:42.500]  It's happening from Australia to the UK to Spain.
[2:02:42.500 --> 2:02:49.580]  This is the system saying, we are in total control, we have absolute power.
[2:02:49.580 --> 2:02:52.940]  The social distancing, all of it is based on a fraud.
[2:02:52.940 --> 2:02:58.700]  This is the permanent medical martial law that we're being eased into being prepared for.
[2:02:58.700 --> 2:03:04.300]  And joining us is Artur Poloski, who got arrested during his weekend services.
[2:03:04.300 --> 2:03:06.820]  They waited until he drove down the road and grabbed him.
[2:03:06.820 --> 2:03:12.660]  He was able to call us from jail only because a family member was able to visit him
[2:03:12.660 --> 2:03:16.380]  and get him on the phone via their phone.
[2:03:16.380 --> 2:03:20.580]  And again, he was able to call his son, who then passed him through on his phone.
[2:03:20.580 --> 2:03:24.740]  And he joins us now to give us an update on what happened to him in just the state of Canada.
[2:03:24.740 --> 2:03:29.060]  As the rest of the world under pressure reopens, Canada is basically saying,
[2:03:29.060 --> 2:03:32.420]  as documents showed last year, that this is a permanent takeover.
[2:03:32.420 --> 2:03:35.660]  I guess, because big corporations are doubling and tripling products
[2:03:35.660 --> 2:03:38.020]  because everyone else is non-essential.
[2:03:38.020 --> 2:03:40.820]  A church is non-essential, a small business is non-essential,
[2:03:40.820 --> 2:03:44.260]  but mega banks and mega systems are essential.
[2:03:44.260 --> 2:03:47.700]  This is so obvious, Pastor.
[2:03:47.700 --> 2:03:50.660]  Yes, it is. It's a total global madness.
[2:03:50.660 --> 2:03:54.780]  The biggest takeover we have ever seen during our lifetime
[2:03:54.780 --> 2:03:57.660]  or in a history of mankind.
[2:03:57.660 --> 2:04:01.740]  Small businesses eliminated, medium-sized businesses eliminated,
[2:04:01.740 --> 2:04:05.300]  middle class completely wiped out, destroyed.
[2:04:05.300 --> 2:04:10.420]  You will only have extremely powerful and rich in total control of your life.
[2:04:10.420 --> 2:04:14.460]  They will say how to live and when and where to die.
[2:04:14.460 --> 2:04:20.300]  And then everybody else is a slave, just like in a country I grew up under in Poland,
[2:04:20.300 --> 2:04:26.540]  under the boots of the Soviets, 50,000 communists were ruling over 36 million homes.
[2:04:26.540 --> 2:04:28.340]  It's unbelievable what's happening.
[2:04:28.340 --> 2:04:30.700]  I have been warning people just like you, Alex.
[2:04:30.700 --> 2:04:36.500]  For 16 years, I have been warning Canadians and the Western civilizations about what's coming.
[2:04:36.500 --> 2:04:40.100]  And I was laughed at. I was called a conspiracy theorist.
[2:04:40.100 --> 2:04:43.460]  And this will never happen. And well, it's happening right now.
[2:04:43.460 --> 2:04:47.620]  And now the question is, what are we going to do about it?
[2:04:47.620 --> 2:04:51.580]  And people say it's over the top. It's authoritarian. It's meant to be, isn't it?
[2:04:51.580 --> 2:04:54.180]  They're just getting us ready for the next phase of control
[2:04:54.180 --> 2:04:57.340]  as those secret documents that leaked in Canada last year showed.
[2:04:57.340 --> 2:05:00.300]  This is permanent. People need to figure that out.
[2:05:00.300 --> 2:05:03.060]  Yes, it is permanent. It's a medical tyranny.
[2:05:03.060 --> 2:05:07.780]  They're using everything they have at their disposal to subdue the people.
[2:05:07.780 --> 2:05:11.060]  Right now, you will never believe what I'm about to tell you.
[2:05:11.060 --> 2:05:15.620]  The government declared that protests are illegal.
[2:05:15.620 --> 2:05:18.980]  If you are caught protesting the government,
[2:05:18.980 --> 2:05:24.700]  you will be immediately arrested and charged with a contempt of court order,
[2:05:24.700 --> 2:05:28.100]  which is six months jail time.
[2:05:28.100 --> 2:05:31.340]  Wow. So tell me about the arrest. Tell me what the judge has said.
[2:05:31.340 --> 2:05:35.780]  I know they're trying to pass a law where the government can censor anybody on the Internet for their speech.
[2:05:35.780 --> 2:05:38.780]  Any time they want, Canada is becoming the new North Korea,
[2:05:38.780 --> 2:05:42.740]  not just the north of the United States. This is very serious.
[2:05:42.740 --> 2:05:46.940]  So protesting the court's decisions is now contempt.
[2:05:46.940 --> 2:05:53.180]  That is the court claiming it has jurisdiction outside the court. That's just incredible.
[2:05:53.180 --> 2:05:56.980]  That's right. That's right. So what happened was I conducted a church service.
[2:05:56.980 --> 2:06:02.220]  So my crime was opening the door of the church and anyone who wished to come, it was free to come.
[2:06:02.220 --> 2:06:08.220]  I didn't force anyone to come and free people can worship God freely.
[2:06:08.220 --> 2:06:12.220]  You would think in a free and democratic society, however, that's not the case.
[2:06:12.220 --> 2:06:15.820]  SWAT team showed up again and I opened the door.
[2:06:15.820 --> 2:06:21.100]  They were welcome to come in. However, they dropped something on the ground and they left.
[2:06:21.100 --> 2:06:23.500]  I was, of course, in the middle of church service.
[2:06:23.500 --> 2:06:27.500]  I finished what I was already doing and I went to my car.
[2:06:27.500 --> 2:06:36.500]  People left and I sent a message to the lawyer that I need to talk to them about the visitation from the SWAT team again.
[2:06:36.500 --> 2:06:40.500]  And I was driving back home in the middle of a busy highway.
[2:06:40.500 --> 2:06:47.500]  Police stopped us. There was three of us, my friend Dave Hughes, my brother David Palosky and myself.
[2:06:47.500 --> 2:06:49.500]  And you see right now what happened.
[2:06:49.500 --> 2:06:56.500]  They informed us that we were under arrest because of a contempt of court order that we would never receive.
[2:06:56.500 --> 2:06:59.500]  We were never presented, was never read to us.
[2:06:59.500 --> 2:07:04.500]  I never talked to the police. Police didn't come to me and say, hey, listen, this is the court order.
[2:07:04.500 --> 2:07:07.500]  You're not allowed to do this service.
[2:07:07.500 --> 2:07:15.500]  I was already in the middle of church service and they just dropped it on the ground, some piece of paper which was folded.
[2:07:15.500 --> 2:07:18.500]  We couldn't tell what it was.
[2:07:18.500 --> 2:07:28.500]  Look at these Orwellian headlines from Fox News, the Herald and others. Calgary professor accused of organizing and promoting gatherings to appear in court.
[2:07:28.500 --> 2:07:31.500]  Oh my gosh, Christians gathering. Oh my gosh.
[2:07:31.500 --> 2:07:38.500]  Yeah, yeah, this has become unacceptable behavior if Christians gather together just like during communism.
[2:07:38.500 --> 2:07:43.500]  The communists and the Soviets were afraid of gatherings because during gatherings people exchange ideas.
[2:07:43.500 --> 2:07:47.500]  They talk about truth. They have facts. They exchange that information.
[2:07:47.500 --> 2:07:55.500]  Tell us how long you were in jail and then this big announcement that the judge is saying, anybody else protest, I'm arresting you all. Wow.
[2:07:55.500 --> 2:08:00.500]  That's right. I was with my brother 53 hours. We were denied access to the lawyer.
[2:08:00.500 --> 2:08:03.500]  The lawyer couldn't contact us for 24 hours.
[2:08:03.500 --> 2:08:15.500]  We were tortured. I mean, literally we were forced, I was forced on my back upside down, laying for an hour handcuffed, which was unbelievably painful.
[2:08:15.500 --> 2:08:23.500]  Then I was taken with my brother to different cells and we were forced to sleep on the ground on the concrete.
[2:08:23.500 --> 2:08:32.500]  No pillow, no mattress, no blanket with the light nonstop, so bright you couldn't you couldn't sleep, which is a form of torture.
[2:08:32.500 --> 2:08:42.500]  We were denied all kinds of rights. Then we were taken to another place and in that place we were we had to spend many, many hours in a filthy cell.
[2:08:42.500 --> 2:08:51.500]  You can imagine and of course we were arrested because of the health issues and we were taken to the place that if there were viruses over there, we all were.
[2:08:51.500 --> 2:08:54.500]  And we got limited time. We'll get you on for 30 minutes tomorrow the next day.
[2:08:54.500 --> 2:08:59.500]  But just tell us what they're charging you with what's happening.
[2:08:59.500 --> 2:09:04.500]  And then this latest announcement that you better not protest unless your black lives matter in Canada.
[2:09:04.500 --> 2:09:12.500]  That's right. They're charged us with contempt of court order that we never received and we never read and we are facing trial this Thursday.
[2:09:12.500 --> 2:09:25.500]  And right now I talked to the organizer of the rallies, the freedom rallies and he said they are going to arrest every single person and never organize it that there's to organize any protest against the government.
[2:09:25.500 --> 2:09:30.500]  We're all going to go by the way the German Chancellor is now calling for arresting Germans a year plus into this.
[2:09:30.500 --> 2:09:35.500]  They try to go outside and protest. This is hell the Soviets in the old Soviet Union let you go outside.
[2:09:35.500 --> 2:09:39.500]  They I mean, I mean, you just couldn't go over the Berlin Wall. This is incredible.
[2:09:39.500 --> 2:09:47.500]  Yes, we are repeating the history again in front of our eyes and I'm really surprised that the people still believe in all of this.
[2:09:47.500 --> 2:09:53.500]  This craziness, this big fat lie, this manipulation. I don't know what it's going to take.
[2:09:53.500 --> 2:10:02.500]  I'm asking Americans to do a protest outside of Canadian embassies. Maybe that will put some political pressure because they are here for the kill.
[2:10:02.500 --> 2:10:03.500]  They want us to.
[2:10:03.500 --> 2:10:10.500]  Oh, where's the international? They're like, oh, it's wrong. They're closing Chinese churches. They've done this here. These are leftist monsters.
[2:10:10.500 --> 2:10:16.500]  Well, so where is the court hearing Thursday? People need to stand against these tyrants. This is outrageous.
[2:10:16.500 --> 2:10:21.500]  Let them arrest a thousand people. Let that be the image. This is and it's all selectively enforced.
[2:10:21.500 --> 2:10:25.500]  Tell us the time and date again of the hearing.
[2:10:25.500 --> 2:10:33.500]  It's Thursday in a city of Calgary. If I tell you to come, I already reached the order. I cannot promote. I cannot ask.
[2:10:33.500 --> 2:10:40.500]  I cannot tell people to come and gather anywhere because that's also contempt of court orders. So I have to tell you, don't do it.
[2:10:40.500 --> 2:10:46.500]  Don't come. Don't protest because if I say anything contrary to the courts, I will be immediately arrested.
[2:10:46.500 --> 2:10:53.500]  Sure. I mean, this is an annihilation of your free speech that you have also chartered up there and that's already there that God gave us.
[2:10:53.500 --> 2:10:56.500]  And this is they're getting us ready for martial law and financial collapse.
[2:10:56.500 --> 2:11:04.500]  So they're turning the power plants off. They're turning the pipelines off. The borders are wide open and we are we are under globalist attack.
[2:11:04.500 --> 2:11:12.500]  Yes, we are. We are. We are. And if you are not seeing that, if the people that are watching this don't see this, then they're playing either stupid or completely blind.
[2:11:12.500 --> 2:11:17.500]  We are under attack. This is a fight for our lives and the fight for our future, the future of our children.
[2:11:17.500 --> 2:11:20.500]  What kind of legacy are we going to pass to the next generations?
[2:11:20.500 --> 2:11:26.500]  That's right. Again, a Soviet Union, Korea, China, all free and democratic society.
[2:11:26.500 --> 2:11:28.500]  That's right. Tyranny incoming. It's here.
[2:11:28.500 --> 2:11:30.500]  Pastor, give us the website for your church again.
[2:11:30.500 --> 2:11:42.500]  www.streetchurch.ca. Please, we need your help. If you can help, help. And let's let's push this.
[2:11:42.500 --> 2:11:46.500]  Please, let's set that up. Thank you. We'll be right back with your calls and a special guest. Thank you, sir.
[2:11:46.500 --> 2:11:51.500]  Wow. I mean, I'm telling you, folks, this isn't on a scale of one to 10 shutdown churches is 10.
[2:11:51.500 --> 2:11:54.500]  We are in so much trouble. It's coming here now. It's already in California.
[2:11:54.500 --> 2:12:00.500]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material
[2:12:00.500 --> 2:12:06.500]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[2:12:06.500 --> 2:12:13.500]  For the first time, the bio pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio remediation products to the everyday consumer.
[2:12:13.500 --> 2:12:21.500]  Their first product they are launching is called bioseptic pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[2:12:21.500 --> 2:12:26.500]  Bio septic pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[2:12:26.500 --> 2:12:35.500]  This stuff lives in your septic system. It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products
[2:12:35.500 --> 2:12:37.500]  due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[2:12:37.500 --> 2:12:42.500]  Bio septic pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[2:12:42.500 --> 2:12:48.500]  Visit thebio pros.com today and protect your septic system. That's thebio pros.com.
[2:12:48.500 --> 2:12:52.500]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[2:12:52.500 --> 2:13:18.500]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia with no evidence for the shutdown of the east coast gasoline pipeline that goes from Houston right up through New York City.
[2:13:18.500 --> 2:13:25.500]  And instead of the east coast, that's right, Joe Biden shut down the keystone pipeline right after it was completed.
[2:13:25.500 --> 2:13:29.500]  Joe Biden did that to America. He has the history. He has the background.
[2:13:29.500 --> 2:13:32.500]  He's the one that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels.
[2:13:32.500 --> 2:13:36.500]  He's the one that's tried to extend the lockdowns of the country.
[2:13:36.500 --> 2:13:46.500]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world and they want the United States, Europe and Australia crippled so communist China can be dominant.
[2:13:46.500 --> 2:13:52.500]  It's not Russia that's the enemy. It's communist China and their millions like Joe Biden in control of the White House.
[2:13:52.500 --> 2:13:57.500]  That's the facts. That's the information.
[2:13:57.500 --> 2:14:21.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:14:21.500 --> 2:14:33.500]  All right, I'm going to take calls for the next 40 minutes or so until we start the next hour.
[2:14:33.500 --> 2:14:42.500]  And then we've got the man that wrote the U.S. biological weapons treaty law on with us.
[2:14:42.500 --> 2:15:07.500]  Dr. Francis Boyle. So that is coming up. I cannot underestimate to you how big a deal it is before you go to these calls that it's come out that Fauci and Gates and their cohorts by name were funding gain a function with these viruses.
[2:15:07.500 --> 2:15:20.500]  That was already known, but they admit they got the five that the Australians, the Indians, the French and others scan the virus and said back last February.
[2:15:20.500 --> 2:15:27.500]  First it was the Indians in February and then by March and April it was the top French scientist with the CRISPR that discovered HIV.
[2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:32.500]  It was the Australian University. I mean, all of them.
[2:15:32.500 --> 2:15:41.500]  They said, look, this thing is ridiculously fake. I mean, it's five viruses holding together. You got the P Shuttle genes where they put them together.
[2:15:41.500 --> 2:15:50.500]  It's ridiculous. It's like asking, is an F-150 pickup truck man made? Yeah, it's man made compared to a cow. Is a cow man made?
[2:15:50.500 --> 2:16:01.500]  No, God made that. That's biological. That's not artificial. It's a 57 Chevy man made. Yeah, it's man made. It's a rocket ship man made.
[2:16:01.500 --> 2:16:07.500]  So the heads of these organizations all did this with Gates funding. Gates was obsessed with it.
[2:16:07.500 --> 2:16:12.500]  And I came out and I said there should be war crimes trials over this.
[2:16:12.500 --> 2:16:17.500]  We'll talk to a guy that used to prosecute war crimes and we'll cover the Geneva Convention with him.
[2:16:17.500 --> 2:16:22.500]  And the last thing I want is for anybody outside of law to hurt any of these people.
[2:16:22.500 --> 2:16:30.500]  They've been hurting us with their bio weapon with their tainted vaccines that are unauthorized drugs that they buffaloed the system to sign on to.
[2:16:30.500 --> 2:16:36.500]  But I mean, look, at one time government said blacks weren't humans. People disagreed with that. We overturned it.
[2:16:36.500 --> 2:16:42.500]  It doesn't matter if they got the feds to sign off on emergency authorization of these things. They knew that it was going to hurt people.
[2:16:42.500 --> 2:16:49.500]  They covered that up. So as bad as the virus was, it was nothing compared to the vaccine that's a gene therapy.
[2:16:49.500 --> 2:16:53.500]  So this is all coming home to roost and it's a big, big deal.
[2:16:53.500 --> 2:16:59.500]  But I do say that the penalty for violating the Nuremberg Code is life imprisonment and or execution.
[2:16:59.500 --> 2:17:02.500]  That's not for me to carry out. That's not for me to say.
[2:17:02.500 --> 2:17:07.500]  I'm simply saying that I even talked to lawyers last night about what I said. It was the right thing to say.
[2:17:07.500 --> 2:17:10.500]  They said, that's totally defensible. You're saying you believe they've committed war crimes.
[2:17:10.500 --> 2:17:15.500]  You believe they should be indicted. They should be tried for a biological weapons attack.
[2:17:15.500 --> 2:17:21.500]  You have the motive of why they did it to take over, bring in the casual society and power to then be able to genetically engineer the general public.
[2:17:21.500 --> 2:17:26.500]  I mean, it's all there. And then they all tell us there's too many people and they all tell us they're going to take over our bodies.
[2:17:26.500 --> 2:17:33.500]  I mean, Klaus Schwab and all of them admit it. And then we have the heads of the projects saying they work for Gates and Fauci and saying that they weaponize the damn virus.
[2:17:33.500 --> 2:17:39.500]  Then we have them covering it up in a fake Lancet report and emails saying take their name out of it so people don't know they're involved.
[2:17:39.500 --> 2:17:45.500]  And then you have the same people at the Wuhan lab running the fact checkers online to shut down people exposing them.
[2:17:45.500 --> 2:17:50.500]  My God, they did this because they thought they could get away with it.
[2:17:50.500 --> 2:17:58.500]  And the question is, are they going to get away with it? Because if they get away with it, they're just going to keep expanding their power graph.
[2:17:58.500 --> 2:18:04.500]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk about the callers we've got. We've got so many callers here, so many great people.
[2:18:04.500 --> 2:18:10.500]  We've got Darryl. We'll talk about privacy laws and COVID vaccines. We'll go to him first in a moment.
[2:18:10.500 --> 2:18:17.500]  Then we've got Forrest wants to talk about energy crisis. We've got John in Australia wants to talk about COVID madness and vaccines.
[2:18:17.500 --> 2:18:20.500]  We've got Carlos in Canada. We've got Whistleblower. We've got everybody.
[2:18:20.500 --> 2:18:26.500]  And I said I was going to go to Darryl first, but let's go to John in Australia because he might be on his dime.
[2:18:26.500 --> 2:18:32.500]  What is your view about these shenanigans, these fiascos, John? What's your view on all this? Thanks for calling.
[2:18:32.500 --> 2:18:38.500]  I'd like to say I've been trying to get a hold of you for a few weeks now and I'm glad I've finally got through it.
[2:18:38.500 --> 2:18:42.500]  Rather keep pushing the message because you're getting through it where we're having an effect.
[2:18:42.500 --> 2:18:49.500]  My view is we knew this from the start. These people, the biggest thing is they love to brag, right?
[2:18:49.500 --> 2:18:59.500]  And I'm getting pissed off bad because there's so many people that are just walking sheep that are just following the sheep in front of them
[2:18:59.500 --> 2:19:04.500]  and then nodding up and taking it. We've had two million people in this country already get their vaccine.
[2:19:04.500 --> 2:19:12.500]  And when the death waves start hitting, those 10 million people are bye-bye. I thoroughly agree with everything you said yesterday.
[2:19:12.500 --> 2:19:20.500]  Listen to your whole show start to finish multiple times. They need to be arrested, tried and hang the bathroom.
[2:19:20.500 --> 2:19:26.500]  And the only reason I said that is I think that's the truth. That's what they've done.
[2:19:26.500 --> 2:19:30.500]  If we could have gotten Joseph Mingler, the angel of death, that would have happened.
[2:19:30.500 --> 2:19:34.500]  It's not like I have a bloodlust. I don't want to take these people on, but they're attacking us.
[2:19:34.500 --> 2:19:39.500]  So we need to let them know that, hey, you're not above the law. You're not God. You're not a mad scientist.
[2:19:39.500 --> 2:19:42.500]  That's going to get away with this.
[2:19:42.500 --> 2:19:48.500]  No, they're not. And my willpower is the strongest ever, mate, and I'll be honest with you.
[2:19:48.500 --> 2:19:53.500]  I've never been a highly religious individual, but in the last year and a half, mate, I'm throwing that way more and more
[2:19:53.500 --> 2:19:56.500]  because I can understand where this is going to end up.
[2:19:56.500 --> 2:20:00.500]  People thought I was crazy before. They're not thinking I'm crazy anymore.
[2:20:00.500 --> 2:20:05.500]  Well, that's another important point. Half the public thought I was crazy five years ago.
[2:20:05.500 --> 2:20:10.500]  Now about 90% think I'm right because they see it in front of their face. What are you seeing in Australia?
[2:20:10.500 --> 2:20:16.500]  Look, we've still got too many people that are really on the fence that I'm certain.
[2:20:16.500 --> 2:20:21.500]  I talk to people all the time. I work in the security industry. I work from site to site to site.
[2:20:21.500 --> 2:20:26.500]  And I don't really give a damn anymore what they think of me or what they say. I'm just speaking the truth, man.
[2:20:26.500 --> 2:20:33.500]  And a lot of asking questions and passing out information daily, multiple times a day.
[2:20:33.500 --> 2:20:37.500]  I'm going to go home tonight when I finish work and order a whole bunch of your copies of the end game.
[2:20:37.500 --> 2:20:41.500]  And I bought a DVD burner and I'm starting handing those suckers out.
[2:20:41.500 --> 2:20:45.500]  But people got to get their head out of the sand and start paying attention.
[2:20:45.500 --> 2:20:52.500]  And that's the problem we got here. They don't care until it's too late and it's over for them.
[2:20:52.500 --> 2:20:57.500]  God bless you, sir. Yeah, they say ignorance is bliss, but you've got an authoritarian system, ignorance is death.
[2:20:57.500 --> 2:21:01.500]  And yes, you have until Sunday to get in game as low as $3.95 a piece.
[2:21:01.500 --> 2:21:04.500]  It costs us a dollar to make it. It costs a million bucks to make the film.
[2:21:04.500 --> 2:21:08.500]  But it costs a dollar to print each one. That would be like three bucks to fund ourselves.
[2:21:08.500 --> 2:21:11.500]  You can buy ten of them for $3.95 a piece by one for $15.
[2:21:11.500 --> 2:21:16.500]  And just make copies of it. Please get it out. There's a film predicts it all. Thank you so much.
[2:21:16.500 --> 2:21:23.500]  All right, let's go to Darrell in Texas. Thank you for being there. Thank you. Go ahead.
[2:21:23.500 --> 2:21:30.500]  Yes, sir. I've been working in healthcare for 20 years and two things.
[2:21:30.500 --> 2:21:35.500]  In my experience, companies will fire you for very quickly and that is workplace violence.
[2:21:35.500 --> 2:21:42.500]  And the second is a HIPAA violation. If you are looking at medical charts you shouldn't be looking at,
[2:21:42.500 --> 2:21:48.500]  or you are discussing or disclosing information you shouldn't, they will fire you really quick.
[2:21:48.500 --> 2:21:57.500]  And so what I'm wanting to bring people's attention to is the fact that vaccine choice and things like that are protected health information.
[2:21:57.500 --> 2:22:02.500]  And if someone is discussing your vaccine choices or your family's vaccine choices in the workplace,
[2:22:02.500 --> 2:22:09.500]  or they're bullying you and you don't give consent, you want to get their attention really fast,
[2:22:09.500 --> 2:22:14.500]  just file a HIPAA complaint against them and that's the kind of language they...
[2:22:14.500 --> 2:22:18.500]  Hold on. Don't hang up. I want to come back and give you a few minutes because what you said is so key.
[2:22:18.500 --> 2:22:23.500]  I've rambled this off many times. I've worked in healthcare a little bit. My family's worked a lot in healthcare.
[2:22:23.500 --> 2:22:28.500]  HIPAA is a federal law and we needed it because people kept sharing everybody's medical stuff,
[2:22:28.500 --> 2:22:32.500]  especially if you're a well-known person or your enemies would get it and use it against you.
[2:22:32.500 --> 2:22:36.500]  That's your private information. You pay a lot of money to these medical systems, they better keep it secret.
[2:22:36.500 --> 2:22:43.500]  How the hell they can have a world ID that Klaus Schwab calls for and a world pass with all your medical stuff on this thing
[2:22:43.500 --> 2:22:49.500]  for everybody to get. Exactly. And who are people asking if you're vaccinated to know your medical status
[2:22:49.500 --> 2:22:52.500]  to be able to go into a business or something? This is about getting rid of our privacy,
[2:22:52.500 --> 2:22:54.500]  getting rid of everything and it doesn't protect us.
[2:22:54.500 --> 2:22:58.500]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off.
[2:22:58.500 --> 2:23:04.500]  The success is simple versus that. If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[2:23:04.500 --> 2:23:14.500]  But I'll tell you this. The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[2:23:14.500 --> 2:23:21.500]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance. So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about
[2:23:21.500 --> 2:23:25.500]  has been proven accurate. Everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[2:23:25.500 --> 2:23:32.500]  So it's now that your credibility is way up. The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[2:23:32.500 --> 2:23:39.500]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us. We have the power.
[2:23:39.500 --> 2:23:43.500]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:23:43.500 --> 2:23:49.500]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[2:23:49.500 --> 2:23:54.500]  So be the polar bears you are.
[2:23:54.500 --> 2:24:05.500]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment
[2:24:05.500 --> 2:24:08.500]  when you have high-quality fish oil. We've got the best out there.
[2:24:08.500 --> 2:24:13.500]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:24:13.500 --> 2:24:15.500]  Everybody already knows what high-quality fish oil does.
[2:24:15.500 --> 2:24:19.500]  And it costs us even more to put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[2:24:19.500 --> 2:24:24.500]  So this is also clean fish oil. It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off.
[2:24:24.500 --> 2:24:28.500]  Grill Oil is set to sell out. It's amazing as well. It's at 25% off.
[2:24:28.500 --> 2:24:32.500]  But when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.

[2:24:42.500 --> 2:24:46.500]  The listeners thought I was joking. You've tried it out and most of you have been blown away.

[2:24:55.500 --> 2:24:59.500]  I'm driving home at 7 o'clock at night on Monday night to see my family.
[2:24:59.500 --> 2:25:03.500]  And I just remember there's only two days left for our wonderful listeners
[2:25:03.500 --> 2:25:09.500]  to get incredibly high-quality, storable food at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[2:25:09.500 --> 2:25:13.500]  These are 20, 20 prices for a limited time for our listeners.
[2:25:13.500 --> 2:25:17.500]  And then the price isn't just going to go back to regular, it's going to have to go up.
[2:25:17.500 --> 2:25:21.500]  Everybody else has already raised prices way more than my Patreon.
[2:25:21.500 --> 2:25:26.500]  We have their entire spectrum and catalog at infowarstore.com, PrepareWithAlex.com.
[2:25:26.500 --> 2:25:33.500]  You get an additional 10% off on three months, six months, your supplies, and everything else on the site.
[2:25:33.500 --> 2:25:36.500]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[2:25:36.500 --> 2:25:41.500]  I would take advantage of this with what's happening in food price increases around the world.
[2:25:41.500 --> 2:25:47.500]  I predict that by the fall, you're going to see major shortages and you're going to see huge price increases.
[2:25:47.500 --> 2:25:51.500]  I think it's a smart bet right now to get high-quality, storable food at last year's prices
[2:25:51.500 --> 2:25:55.500]  while you still can at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[2:25:55.500 --> 2:26:00.500]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been,
[2:26:00.500 --> 2:26:07.500]  Alex Jones was right, but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook,
[2:26:07.500 --> 2:26:10.500]  making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[2:26:10.500 --> 2:26:12.500]  Well, let me tell you, we are Tomorrow's News Today.
[2:26:12.500 --> 2:26:16.500]  And thanks to your support, we're still on air at infowarst.com and Bandai Video,
[2:26:16.500 --> 2:26:18.500]  radio stations and TV stations across the country.
[2:26:18.500 --> 2:26:23.500]  And our film Endgame, censored and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years ago,
[2:26:23.500 --> 2:26:25.500]  is now available again.
[2:26:25.500 --> 2:26:30.500]  We have repredited a high-quality DVD in HD. It has a zero country code, meaning anyone in the world
[2:26:30.500 --> 2:26:34.500]  is authorized to make copies of it. And I'm asking you to get the original, make copies,
[2:26:34.500 --> 2:26:38.500]  give it to everyone you know, air it on Local Access TV, give it to your pastors, your police chiefs,
[2:26:38.500 --> 2:26:41.500]  your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever you do, warn the world.
[2:26:41.500 --> 2:26:46.500]  This film uses their own documents and own statements 14 years ago to expose them.
[2:26:46.500 --> 2:26:49.500]  It's more important than ever, available at infowarst.com.
[2:26:49.500 --> 2:26:55.500]  That's infowarstore.com. Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[2:27:20.500 --> 2:27:22.500]  You can face it.
[2:27:25.500 --> 2:27:27.500]  You can hear it.
[2:27:27.500 --> 2:27:35.500]  If tyrants had a checklist for tyranny, it'd be partial law, churches locked down, gas shortages,
[2:27:35.500 --> 2:27:43.500]  long lines, corruption, surveillance, tyranny, intimidation, alliances with authoritarian states.
[2:27:43.500 --> 2:27:45.500]  That's where America is right now.
[2:27:45.500 --> 2:27:50.500]  And the last caller is making a great point about HIPAA. I wish he had held over, but I understand.
[2:27:50.500 --> 2:27:53.500]  He hung up, but he's absolutely right.
[2:27:53.500 --> 2:27:55.500]  Let's talk to a whistleblower in Texas.
[2:27:55.500 --> 2:28:00.500]  Let's talk about security hack, breach of pipeline gas shortages. Go ahead.
[2:28:00.500 --> 2:28:03.500]  Hi, Alex.
[2:28:03.500 --> 2:28:11.500]  I got some information yesterday that I thought was pretty important and kind of alarming
[2:28:11.500 --> 2:28:16.500]  concerning the security breach with the colonial pipeline.
[2:28:16.500 --> 2:28:17.500]  Yes.
[2:28:17.500 --> 2:28:27.500]  Actually, I got this information from my husband who is an engineer with an energy company here in Texas.
[2:28:27.500 --> 2:28:35.500]  I'm really not going to disclose what company for his purposes.
[2:28:35.500 --> 2:28:37.500]  Okay, I'm a little bit nervous.
[2:28:37.500 --> 2:28:39.500]  You're doing a great job. Go ahead.
[2:28:39.500 --> 2:28:54.500]  Okay, so my husband works with a young engineer and his father works for the company that supplies security for colonial.
[2:28:54.500 --> 2:29:01.500]  I don't know the name of the company, but this is a parent company that they contract with.
[2:29:01.500 --> 2:29:11.500]  And my husband was, couldn't believe the negligence.
[2:29:11.500 --> 2:29:19.500]  I would call it criminal negligence of this company that colonial is contracting with.
[2:29:19.500 --> 2:29:26.500]  So, according to this man that works at colonial and know that I'm not getting this firsthand.
[2:29:26.500 --> 2:29:37.500]  I don't know that. There was a low level worker who was granted almost carte blanche.
[2:29:37.500 --> 2:29:50.500]  I mean high level security access to the system and was working with the hackers and letting them in.
[2:29:50.500 --> 2:29:57.500]  That's the type of cover story they would put out from my analysis with the globalists wanting to shut our power off to collapse us.
[2:29:57.500 --> 2:29:59.500]  They would use a cover story like that.
[2:29:59.500 --> 2:30:06.500]  But exactly, if you have everything in the technocracy and everything's centralized, then one person can get in as an inside person and do this.
[2:30:06.500 --> 2:30:13.500]  That's why an AI worldwide system is so dangerous, not just that the globalists are programming all the AI and programming the systems,
[2:30:13.500 --> 2:30:18.500]  but then when everything's centralized, when something goes down, it's catastrophic. Does that make sense?
[2:30:18.500 --> 2:30:22.500]  Well, not really, but that's okay. It doesn't have to.
[2:30:22.500 --> 2:30:30.500]  But I guess I don't quite get why that's a cover story because I think...
[2:30:30.500 --> 2:30:37.500]  Ma'am, I'm not saying you're wrong. I mean, there may be one guy went in. He was paid by the hackers.
[2:30:37.500 --> 2:30:44.500]  He did it. Who approached the young man? Is it really the people he thinks approached him?
[2:30:44.500 --> 2:30:48.500]  You know, I wish I knew. I'm just saying this. I go off motive.
[2:30:48.500 --> 2:30:52.500]  And when I'm sure about something and I have all the facts, I'll say, this is what's going on.
[2:30:52.500 --> 2:30:59.500]  I know they cooked up the virus. I know they released it. It was all pre-programmed, all pre-scripted, and they had the cover-up planned, all of it.
[2:30:59.500 --> 2:31:06.500]  Other stuff, I'm not 100%. I'm just saying, if Biden's already shutting down thousands of pipelines around the U.S., small ones,
[2:31:06.500 --> 2:31:16.500]  is ordering through Whitmer the shutdown of a major system out of Canada into Michigan, I'm just saying it fits into the plan.
[2:31:16.500 --> 2:31:22.500]  Why would the EPA tell Texas you can't turn your power up during the storm? Remember that?
[2:31:22.500 --> 2:31:29.500]  I'm just saying it's part of their policy. Why would Biden say, flood us immediately? He said collapse the border.
[2:31:29.500 --> 2:31:35.500]  So it's all part of the same attack. So I am speculating there. I'm not saying your husband's wrong. What else did he say?
[2:31:35.500 --> 2:31:43.500]  That's all he said. He said he'd try to get more information. Just know that I'm a little bit nervous.
[2:31:43.500 --> 2:31:49.500]  Yeah, you're doing a great job. I have no doubt that they think this or they heard this. So are they going to arrest this guy?
[2:31:49.500 --> 2:31:56.500]  I don't know. I don't know. I guess the reason I said I didn't understand is because I'm just a little nervous.
[2:31:56.500 --> 2:32:08.500]  Well, I'm not for torture, but the few times they say it might be good. The classic case is you catch a guy with a bunch of school kids he's kidnapped with a 100-pound bomb
[2:32:08.500 --> 2:32:14.500]  and you can't diffuse it because it's too complex. Do you start torturing him to make him diffuse the bomb?
[2:32:14.500 --> 2:32:18.500]  Sure, little kids are there. You'd probably start torturing him. But that's a one in a million scenario.
[2:32:18.500 --> 2:32:26.500]  Somebody turns a pipeline off supplying 100 million people and what it's going to cause is society collapses.
[2:32:26.500 --> 2:32:31.500]  I'm not endorsing torture. I'm just saying I think about putting the screws to that guy.
[2:32:31.500 --> 2:32:39.500]  So again, it may be true if it comes out. I'm just saying we should also look at what group he thought he was working with.
[2:32:39.500 --> 2:32:45.500]  It was an anonymous hacker group. Just like Q was this group, but really it was globalist manipulating the patriots.
[2:32:45.500 --> 2:32:49.500]  That's what I'm saying is you've got to watch that. Have you ever seen the movie Arlington Road?
[2:32:49.500 --> 2:32:50.500]  No.
[2:32:50.500 --> 2:32:58.500]  You really should go see it and that's a great case point fictional account of how they would set somebody up. Does that make sense?
[2:32:58.500 --> 2:33:03.500]  I think so. I hear what you're saying. I just wish I had more information.
[2:33:03.500 --> 2:33:08.500]  No, you've got great info, whistleblower. Call us back. We love you. We appreciate you. Tell your husband to be safe.
[2:33:08.500 --> 2:33:17.500]  All right, let's take another call here. Let's go ahead and talk to Greg in Arizona. Greg, go ahead.
[2:33:17.500 --> 2:33:18.500]  Yeah, hello.
[2:33:18.500 --> 2:33:19.500]  Yes, go ahead.
[2:33:19.500 --> 2:33:33.500]  Yeah, hi, Alex. I just wanted to bring up what I think is one of the most important questions. It's not the most to ask really all of the US health agencies, the drug companies, obviously Fauci on the stand yesterday.
[2:33:33.500 --> 2:33:43.500]  That would have been a good one, but let's move past Fauci lying yesterday. We know he's lying. So we know that there's involvement between the US agencies and the Wuhan lab.
[2:33:43.500 --> 2:33:56.500]  So the question is, is, you know, when did the Wuhan lab start sharing info about what they were doing? And we want to know when was the info sharing, you know, kind of beginning and what was shared?
[2:33:56.500 --> 2:34:05.500]  Because we want to know, was that info that might have been shared built into the vaccine and shared with the drug companies that are in charge of the vaccine?
[2:34:05.500 --> 2:34:18.500]  If not, then why not? Then even the people who like the vaccine would need to argue they want to wait for another round so that the Wuhan info that is maybe hidden away to get built into the new vaccine.
[2:34:18.500 --> 2:34:19.500]  That makes sense.
[2:34:19.500 --> 2:34:37.500]  That is a great angle. I mean, just having Fauci lie when it was all confirmed they were doing data function, the NIH claims, they stopped it in China in 2017, and to have Fauci saying that was preposterous, that was lying to Congress right there bigger than Dallas.
[2:34:37.500 --> 2:34:49.500]  Yeah, you know, you just, I think people would want to say, hey, I don't want these vaccines where the drug companies were just guessing. If anything, I want a vaccine with all the data that the Wuhan lab knows about this virus.
[2:34:49.500 --> 2:34:52.500]  And do they already have an antidote? You know, we need to start asking those types of questions.
[2:34:52.500 --> 2:35:10.500]  Well, look, I mean, look, I'm no doctor, but I've interviewed a lot of scientists, and here's what we know, brother. It's the HIV delivery spike. And that protein is all over the body already. And so if you try to create an anti-AIDS vaccine, HIV vaccine, it's going to cause blood clots.
[2:35:10.500 --> 2:35:18.500]  That's why they had to suspend trials in Africa of HIV vaccines multiple times. They know this. They know the vaccine causes blood clots. They know it causes.
[2:35:18.500 --> 2:35:24.500]  And so, and so that's the bottom line is they've rolled out a drug they know causes heart attacks and strokes. Go ahead.
[2:35:24.500 --> 2:35:34.500]  I'm sorry. I agree. I don't think the vaccines are the way to go anyway. I think, you know, obviously the way is common sense ways, but there's people that aren't ready to go that far yet.
[2:35:34.500 --> 2:35:42.500]  So you just kind of meet them at their level, say, hey, well, if you like vaccines, you're not getting a good vaccine because it's done on guesswork.
[2:35:42.500 --> 2:35:45.500]  If anything you want, right, put them in that position.
[2:35:45.500 --> 2:35:51.500]  No, you're right. I mean, that's the thing about the flu shot every year. They admit in the fine print. They've never guessed the mutation a year later.
[2:35:51.500 --> 2:35:57.500]  And it's never even worked. It's just made up because they never guessed the right mutation. Great point. Thank you for the call.
[2:35:57.500 --> 2:36:07.500]  All right, I'm going to jam in a lot of calls when we come back. Forrest in Nebraska and we're going to talk to Carlos and we're going to talk to CD, Forrest, Nick and Henry.
[2:36:07.500 --> 2:36:16.500]  We'll get to all those callers and then we've got Francis Boyle coming on who was the first guy to lay it all out.
[2:36:16.500 --> 2:36:19.500]  Day one and he's been spot on.
[2:36:19.500 --> 2:36:22.500]  Except for one thing and that's his opinion. I respect it.
[2:36:22.500 --> 2:36:31.500]  He said it leaked accidentally. Did you see all the pre planning all the roll out of the fair mongering? The great reset operation lockstep. I mean, come on.
[2:36:31.500 --> 2:36:38.500]  I mean, that's like, it's like you show up at your house and there's party balloons and cakes and presents and everybody.
[2:36:38.500 --> 2:36:44.500]  Your wife shows up and goes, oh, I didn't know there was going to be a party because you just set it up. I mean, it was all the table was set, man.
[2:36:44.500 --> 2:36:50.500]  The ham was steaming on the table. This whole damn thing was a huge production. Cots are ass red handed.
[2:36:50.500 --> 2:36:53.500]  We're right back.
[2:36:53.500 --> 2:36:59.500]  The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now if you haven't tried turbo force, you need to try it.
[2:36:59.500 --> 2:37:06.500]  I've tried turbo force with everything. Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy week.
[2:37:06.500 --> 2:37:17.500]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, turbo force is my favorite and all the info wars products are down to take control of your life, take control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[2:37:17.500 --> 2:37:23.500]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[2:37:23.500 --> 2:37:28.500]  I'm going to wake up today. You know, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[2:37:28.500 --> 2:37:33.500]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me.
[2:37:33.500 --> 2:37:38.500]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[2:37:38.500 --> 2:37:43.500]  There's only one person who woke up in front of that, and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life.
[2:37:43.500 --> 2:37:48.500]  I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to infowars.com. Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[2:37:48.500 --> 2:37:54.500]  Don't buy into the group. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the turbo force. Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good.
[2:37:54.500 --> 2:38:02.500]  Pognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[2:38:02.500 --> 2:38:11.500]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com.
[2:38:11.500 --> 2:38:19.500]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels,
[2:38:19.500 --> 2:38:27.500]  decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[2:38:27.500 --> 2:38:38.500]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:38:38.500 --> 2:38:47.500]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[2:38:47.500 --> 2:38:54.500]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[2:39:18.500 --> 2:39:25.500]  But so many of them have been sold out, just like you noticed a lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[2:39:25.500 --> 2:39:32.500]  But finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen, deep-worth crystal iodide, so essential in your body.

[2:39:52.500 --> 2:40:21.500]  It's essential. It's X2 at infowarsstore.com.
[2:40:23.500 --> 2:40:25.500]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.

[2:40:57.500 --> 2:41:01.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:41:01.500 --> 2:41:13.500]  All right, taking your phone calls for two more segments.
[2:41:13.500 --> 2:41:22.500]  And then we're joined by Dr. Francis Boyle, the first guy to expose the whole Wuhan lab, exactly as it later came out with all the new developments, rainfall, and more.
[2:41:22.500 --> 2:41:25.500]  This is really coming unravel for them. They've been caught red-handed.
[2:41:25.500 --> 2:41:28.500]  And if we just push a little more, they're going to go down.
[2:41:28.500 --> 2:41:33.500]  This guy used to prosecute people for war crimes at the UN, so he'll be able to tell us about.
[2:41:33.500 --> 2:41:36.500]  Am I right, saying I think they should be indicted for war crimes?
[2:41:36.500 --> 2:41:45.500]  Before I go back to your calls, look, our supplements are popular because I find out whatever's the best-selling, whatever's the most popular, whatever has the best ratings, whatever helps people the most.
[2:41:45.500 --> 2:41:54.500]  And I go out, and most big companies will clone their best-selling product, so half of our products are clones of best-sellers, or I'll say make it even better.
[2:41:54.500 --> 2:42:00.500]  So everybody wants magnesium, and most of the types out there are one type of magnesium. They're not ionized.
[2:42:00.500 --> 2:42:10.500]  It doesn't go into the cells as well. Still works great for not tired calm, but normal calm, happy calm, great in the morning, great in the afternoon, great at night.
[2:42:10.500 --> 2:42:12.500]  So I've been wanting this for a couple of years.
[2:42:12.500 --> 2:42:17.500]  Well, we got a well-known chemist engineer that develops this stuff to come out with this.
[2:42:17.500 --> 2:42:26.500]  And we explain it on the website. I don't understand it all, but two different types of magnesium, and then it combines with the other ingredients to make this special type of magnesium.
[2:42:26.500 --> 2:42:28.500]  It's so good for the cells. It's so good for the whole body.
[2:42:28.500 --> 2:42:31.500]  Let me just tell you what's in the new product.
[2:42:31.500 --> 2:42:47.500]  Ionized Fizzy Magnesium Orange Flavor Drink at M4Store.com from M4's Life. It helps turn food into energy, helps replicate and repair RNA and DNA, helps with muscle contraction function.
[2:42:47.500 --> 2:42:49.500]  This is officially what you can even say about it. It's a lot more than that.
[2:42:49.500 --> 2:42:53.500]  Help regulate the nervous system, helps with protein building in muscle cells.
[2:42:53.500 --> 2:43:01.500]  True ionic magnesium for optimal absorption. That's why 75% of Americans do not meet the recommended amount of magnesium intake.
[2:43:01.500 --> 2:43:05.500]  Magnesium helps regulate the sodium potassium, pumps that create the signals for the nerve cells.
[2:43:05.500 --> 2:43:09.500]  Magnesium is the most important co-factor of the body regulating and controlling hundreds of pathways.
[2:43:09.500 --> 2:43:18.500]  You hear that? Magnesium is important in healthy muscle activity, preventing cramps and DNA production, helps support healthy heart, healthy muscles, healthy sleep and healthy mood.
[2:43:18.500 --> 2:43:26.500]  Magnesium is required for all the things I just mentioned earlier. And just since this came in a few weeks ago, just the samples of it, I've been taking in people like,
[2:43:26.500 --> 2:43:29.500]  Man, Jones, you look better. You've lost some weight with all the stress you've been under. What's going on?
[2:43:29.500 --> 2:43:35.500]  And a big part of it is the magnesium one little scoop, take it once or twice a day.
[2:43:35.500 --> 2:43:41.500]  And, man, you mix this with fish oil at night. This is the real deal. Look at that little mini scoop.
[2:43:41.500 --> 2:43:48.500]  And look how thick that is for your TV viewer. You can't even see through there because it is. It is just not that fillers. It is delicious.
[2:43:48.500 --> 2:43:52.500]  So I've been drinking these and it's been helping me not get angry. And it's amazing.
[2:43:52.500 --> 2:44:00.500]  Infowarstore.com are new, ionic, fizzy magnesium, and it'll give the very top products out there a run for their money.
[2:44:00.500 --> 2:44:05.500]  And we believe it is one of the best out there, if not the best. There's a lot of stuff in the end caps at grocery store.
[2:44:05.500 --> 2:44:12.500]  If people are buying it, I've used to take that stuff and it works fine. This blows it away because, again, it costs a little more money to ionize it
[2:44:12.500 --> 2:44:16.500]  and use the two types because one of the types of magnesium is a lot more expensive.
[2:44:16.500 --> 2:44:20.500]  So what? It cost me a few dollars more for cancer to have it done the best way.
[2:44:20.500 --> 2:44:27.500]  We found, we found like nobody else was doing it. It's just ridiculous. So here it is. Bon Appetit.
[2:44:27.500 --> 2:44:37.500]  Oh, man, that takes way better than Tang. I was always a Tang guy and an orange just got that. It's just, tastes like an orange Julian.
[2:44:37.500 --> 2:44:41.500]  Tastes like orange sherbet ice cream. Get it today, folks. Edit, funds the Infowar.
[2:44:41.500 --> 2:44:46.500]  Because I had to pay for our own satellites, our own infrastructure. We don't have billion dollar high tech we're plugging into.
[2:44:46.500 --> 2:44:50.500]  We had to do it all thanks to your support because that's why we have all these products.
[2:44:50.500 --> 2:44:53.500]  And you keep us on air to spot all the attacks. So you've really pissed the global assault.
[2:44:53.500 --> 2:44:58.500]  They have New York Times articles asking how we're still on air. It's you. So thank you for keeping us on air.
[2:44:58.500 --> 2:45:05.500]  All right. Try to take down America, period. The churches, the free speech, the pipelines, the farmers. It's crazy.
[2:45:05.500 --> 2:45:10.500]  Let's go ahead and go to Forest in Nebraska, a pipeline worker on the energy crisis. Welcome, sir.
[2:45:10.500 --> 2:45:12.500]  How are you doing, Alex?
[2:45:12.500 --> 2:45:14.500]  I'm good talking to you, brother. What do you think?
[2:45:14.500 --> 2:45:23.500]  Oh, it's awful. You're 100% right. I've spent 15 years working in the oil and gas industry and also an energy industry.
[2:45:23.500 --> 2:45:33.500]  I just finished working 10 months in California and I've seen what they're doing there and it's 100% manufactured collapse.
[2:45:33.500 --> 2:45:38.500]  The pipeline, I've actually surveyed part of that pipeline, the colonial pipeline before.
[2:45:38.500 --> 2:45:46.500]  Because they wanted this thing going, they would send guys out and open the valves up and get gas flowing tomorrow. They don't need the electrical instrumentation to do that.
[2:45:46.500 --> 2:45:51.500]  So this is 100% a manufactured crisis. They're trying to collapse the country.
[2:45:51.500 --> 2:45:59.500]  And we need to wake up and stand up to this because if we don't, we allow this to happen in Michigan and they continue shutting down pipeline.
[2:45:59.500 --> 2:46:04.500]  They're going to California the rest of the United States and that's their goal. I mean, I spent 10 months working out there.
[2:46:04.500 --> 2:46:12.500]  I've worked in 46 states. I'm a third party pipeline inspector and it's awful what's happened to this country.
[2:46:12.500 --> 2:46:16.500]  Well, sir, you're a really important caller. I have a lot of family here in Texas.
[2:46:16.500 --> 2:46:20.500]  It's worked at every level from petroleum geologists down to Roughnecks in the field.
[2:46:20.500 --> 2:46:28.500]  A lot of them from being Roughnecks in high school and a few years before college and going to college and then working in the refineries that is petroleum geologists.
[2:46:28.500 --> 2:46:34.500]  That's what they've all been saying for 20 years is there's a deliberate killing of our infrastructure and our energy. Look at China.
[2:46:34.500 --> 2:46:43.500]  They've been building it up. And for those that don't know, I was reading over a thousand small pipelines have either been not given authorization to be repaired or new pipelines have been killed.
[2:46:43.500 --> 2:46:48.500]  The smaller spurs, they've killed over 60% of oil and gas permits in the U.S.
[2:46:48.500 --> 2:46:51.500]  The first thing he did on day one was kill the Keystone pipeline.
[2:46:51.500 --> 2:47:00.500]  And now Governor Whitmer's trying to kill this 67 year old pipeline out of Canada for no reasons. Never even had a problem. I mean, this is completely obvious.
[2:47:00.500 --> 2:47:08.500]  Yeah, it's completely obvious. I mean, if you look with, like I said, I spent 10 months working in California and I've been in all those natural gas plants.
[2:47:08.500 --> 2:47:13.500]  I've been in all those different substations. I've been in all those different areas and they're all shut down.
[2:47:13.500 --> 2:47:17.500]  And the reason why is the government in California requires so much renewable.
[2:47:17.500 --> 2:47:24.500]  So they require so much renewable. And when they do that, they run all the water hydroelectric, they run all the water out of the rivers and lakes.
[2:47:24.500 --> 2:47:30.500]  And then they do no force management. And what happens, fires happens. They have no water to even fight the fires.
[2:47:30.500 --> 2:47:33.500]  So it's engineered collapse.
[2:47:33.500 --> 2:47:39.500]  And by the way, they're following the full U.N. Agenda 2030 model just like Spain or Australia. And it's collapsing.
[2:47:39.500 --> 2:47:47.500]  And people ask me that live out on Lake Travis. Alex, why even when it rains for a month straight and we had 10 inches of rain in a week?
[2:47:47.500 --> 2:47:56.500]  Why is Lake Travis still down to the river? Because they run the hydroelectric dam at full power because they shut down all the damn coal plants.
[2:47:56.500 --> 2:48:03.500]  Exactly. And that's what people don't understand. And people that don't work in my industry, specifically my background is corrosion.
[2:48:03.500 --> 2:48:13.500]  They don't understand the technology that's out there for these pipelines to operate safely. There is no other form of transportation for oil and gas that is safer than pipelines.
[2:48:13.500 --> 2:48:23.500]  It's an inarguable point. And majority of leaks that happen aren't corrosion leaks. They're leaks from, you know, outside sources, farmers hitting the pipelines and things like this.
[2:48:23.500 --> 2:48:30.500]  But they've educated, they've dumbed down the public enough to hate pipelines when they don't even understand why they hate them.
[2:48:30.500 --> 2:48:42.500]  Well, the director of the Department of Energy, she even had to come out and say pipelines are far and away the best way our infrastructure can't even operate without it.
[2:48:42.500 --> 2:48:50.500]  Exactly. But you try to, they're teaching everyone in school nowadays. I worked on the DAPO, okay? You know, we had all the process there.
[2:48:50.500 --> 2:48:56.500]  I was, I wouldn't have thought that we had guys getting shot at in their dozers. I mean, it was crazy.
[2:48:56.500 --> 2:49:03.500]  Yeah, they think you're a terrorist. Listen, don't hang up on having to get a finishing comment, but here's the head of the Department of Energy, Graham Holm.
[2:49:03.500 --> 2:49:15.500]  We'll talk about a better governor than the former one in Michigan. She's not even perfect, but at least she's a Democrat admitting that this is a nightmare situation with the pipelines. Here it is.
[2:49:15.500 --> 2:49:25.500]  Can you tell us what is the feasibility of using rail cars to transport fuel into the affected areas? I know that's been looked at.
[2:49:25.500 --> 2:49:39.500]  The DOT is looking at that, and so we'll have to wait till their analysis is done. These, these are not easy solutions because there may or may not be the right rail cars.
[2:49:39.500 --> 2:49:54.500]  There may not, or may not be the deep water ports available for the Jones Act to be able to respond. So this particular area of the country, there, this is why we have doubled down on ensuring that there's an ability to truck oil in.
[2:49:54.500 --> 2:50:08.500]  Gas in, but it's, it's the pipe is the best way to go. And so that's why hopefully this company colonial will, in fact, be able to restore operations by the end of the week, as they have said.
[2:50:08.500 --> 2:50:13.500]  So she's a liberal. She's a Democrat. I was joking saying, you know, she's a Republican compared to the current governor of Michigan.
[2:50:13.500 --> 2:50:23.500]  But I mean, what do you make of that, sir? I mean, there they are admitting it's the pipe. It's the safest. Why would you want gasoline and oil flying around in 18 wheelers all over the road when it could be in a big pipe going through the wilderness?
[2:50:23.500 --> 2:50:32.500]  Or buried under the ground? Exactly. And, and, you know, I worked in North Dakota when they first start drilling before they put the pipelines in the ground for the gathering systems.
[2:50:32.500 --> 2:50:41.500]  People don't realize, okay, that oil still has to go somewhere. So they're, they send out these truckers to go pick up all the oil and they haul, they haul it by the crude haulers.
[2:50:41.500 --> 2:50:46.500]  And I've driven those rugways up there when they didn't have the pipelines in the ground. People were dying every day crashing on the roads.
[2:50:46.500 --> 2:50:55.500]  And explain to people, it uses a lot less energy with the pipeline because once it's flowing, it's gravity. Having trucks drive crude oil around is stupid.
[2:50:55.500 --> 2:51:00.500]  It's ignorant. I mean, you're burning gas to haul gas when you could throw it in the pipeline.
[2:51:00.500 --> 2:51:09.500]  It's just like wind power that's 200 miles away, like in Texas from the nearest city, you lose half the power on the way. It's ridiculous.
[2:51:09.500 --> 2:51:16.500]  And wind and all that is, it's a joke. It's a scam. It doesn't work in the right situations.
[2:51:16.500 --> 2:51:20.500]  It bankrupted Spain. God bless you, brother. All right.
[2:51:20.500 --> 2:51:29.500]  Don't tell you, it's a post industrial world. They want to collapse the US. That is the goal. This is the attack.
[2:51:29.500 --> 2:51:35.500]  They're going right down the line and turning off all our biggest systems. And they're going to burn some patsy. You know that.
[2:51:35.500 --> 2:51:43.500]  But this has got New World Order written all over it. Hour number four, more calls and a special guest straight ahead.
[2:51:43.500 --> 2:51:49.500]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021. And I just want to say something.
[2:51:49.500 --> 2:51:54.500]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[2:51:54.500 --> 2:51:59.500]  It is truly an answer to prayer. And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[2:51:59.500 --> 2:52:05.500]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[2:52:05.500 --> 2:52:12.500]  You've got red blood. And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[2:52:12.500 --> 2:52:16.500]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[2:52:16.500 --> 2:52:20.500]  And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[2:52:20.500 --> 2:52:23.500]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[2:52:23.500 --> 2:52:29.500]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[2:52:29.500 --> 2:52:31.500]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[2:52:31.500 --> 2:52:35.500]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[2:52:35.500 --> 2:52:39.500]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[2:52:39.500 --> 2:52:44.500]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for the worse. God bless.
[2:52:44.500 --> 2:52:56.500]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil.
[2:52:56.500 --> 2:52:57.500]  We've got the best out there.

[2:53:02.500 --> 2:53:05.500]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does.
[2:53:05.500 --> 2:53:09.500]  And it costs us even more to put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[2:53:09.500 --> 2:53:11.500]  This is also clean fish oil.
[2:53:11.500 --> 2:53:14.500]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off.
[2:53:14.500 --> 2:53:17.500]  Grill oil is set to sell out. It's amazing as well.
[2:53:17.500 --> 2:53:23.500]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.

[2:54:13.500 --> 2:54:16.500]  Maybe next week, I'm gonna meet ya.
[2:54:16.500 --> 2:54:17.500]  I'm gonna meet ya.
[2:54:17.500 --> 2:54:21.500]  Trucks, and I'm all for trucks, delivers up around the country.
[2:54:21.500 --> 2:54:23.500]  But not oil, not gas.
[2:54:23.500 --> 2:54:26.500]  Not on long hauls.
[2:54:26.500 --> 2:54:33.500]  Trucks delivering oil and gas for long hauls compared to pipeline is like going out to a well
[2:54:33.500 --> 2:54:40.500]  and getting buckets of water to come into your house and take a bath instead of having a pipe to a reservoir.
[2:54:40.500 --> 2:54:42.500]  It's night and it's day.
[2:54:42.500 --> 2:54:46.500]  And this is the strategic shutdown of our country.
[2:54:46.500 --> 2:54:50.500]  It fits into the stated goal of the globalists and it's on purpose.
[2:54:50.500 --> 2:54:54.500]  And there's no doubt that the people that run by are the ones that are behind all this.
[2:54:54.500 --> 2:54:56.500]  We're gonna take some more of your calls.
[2:54:56.500 --> 2:55:01.500]  Let me have a huge guest joining us that can change the whole future of the world.
[2:55:01.500 --> 2:55:06.500]  I'm gonna explain this in a few minutes, but right now let's go back to your phone calls here.
[2:55:06.500 --> 2:55:11.500]  Carlos is always an interesting fellow. Real quick, Carlos, what's your take on all this?
[2:55:11.500 --> 2:55:12.500]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:55:12.500 --> 2:55:16.500]  Before I tell you the day what I would like to talk to you about today,
[2:55:16.500 --> 2:55:19.500]  I wanna tell you, you mentioned fission magnesium.
[2:55:19.500 --> 2:55:23.500]  That's a very interesting substance.
[2:55:23.500 --> 2:55:27.500]  You know, I'm a favorite of your iodine products,
[2:55:27.500 --> 2:55:33.500]  but I suspect that if you're listening, if you ever suffered from migraines,
[2:55:33.500 --> 2:55:40.500]  this fission magnesium with a tiny bit of calcium could be a very, very, very good solution for you.
[2:55:40.500 --> 2:55:45.500]  And if you do have benefit from it, call Infowars and let Alex know,
[2:55:45.500 --> 2:55:50.500]  because I have to tell you magnesium is as essential as iodine to yourselves.
[2:55:50.500 --> 2:55:54.500]  And if you take care of yourselves, the cells will take care of you.
[2:55:54.500 --> 2:55:58.500]  So just let me know, Alex, how your feedback on this fission magnesium is,
[2:55:58.500 --> 2:56:02.500]  because I really think with a little bit of calcium, it can really do marbles on migraine.
[2:56:02.500 --> 2:56:03.500]  Yes, sir.
[2:56:03.500 --> 2:56:05.500]  The other thing is for President Trump.
[2:56:05.500 --> 2:56:08.500]  Look, I support President Trump.
[2:56:08.500 --> 2:56:12.500]  I think he was a great human being, a great American, a great president,
[2:56:12.500 --> 2:56:14.500]  but not a very good politician.
[2:56:14.500 --> 2:56:16.500]  He didn't have the experience.
[2:56:16.500 --> 2:56:19.500]  He was taken in by people like Jeff Sessions.
[2:56:19.500 --> 2:56:25.500]  He should have fired this man immediately after he decided not to involve himself
[2:56:25.500 --> 2:56:28.500]  with the Russian allegation, knowing fully well he was garbage.
[2:56:28.500 --> 2:56:32.500]  And he kept him for two years out of loyalty.
[2:56:32.500 --> 2:56:34.500]  It was a senator that betrayed him.
[2:56:34.500 --> 2:56:35.500]  He wasn't the only one.
[2:56:35.500 --> 2:56:39.500]  He should have looked at Jared Kushner, and what Jared Kushner was advising him to do,
[2:56:39.500 --> 2:56:41.500]  and he wasn't wise enough to know even that.
[2:56:41.500 --> 2:56:46.500]  So, I mean, with all respect as a politician, I believe he really should go out there
[2:56:46.500 --> 2:56:51.500]  and promote the one thing that he can really make a contribution for the history of America,
[2:56:51.500 --> 2:56:54.500]  for his legacy, and that is to restore democracy,
[2:56:54.500 --> 2:56:59.500]  to make sure that you have electoral reform so that what happened to him,
[2:56:59.500 --> 2:57:03.500]  what was done to him, which was essentially removing him
[2:57:03.500 --> 2:57:06.500]  like they would have done President Kennedy so many years ago,
[2:57:06.500 --> 2:57:12.500]  except this time they used the overnight machinery they've been using to jig the elections.
[2:57:12.500 --> 2:57:18.500]  He could not have been removed without a coalition between the Republicans and the Democrats.
[2:57:18.500 --> 2:57:22.500]  The Democrats wanted to remove the president, so did the Republicans.
[2:57:22.500 --> 2:57:25.500]  The Republicans, all they wanted was to remain in power.
[2:57:25.500 --> 2:57:31.500]  So they made political sausage, and President Trump didn't know what was being done behind his back.
[2:57:31.500 --> 2:57:33.500]  He was dealt with politically.
[2:57:33.500 --> 2:57:35.500]  Now, the question is, restore your democracy.
[2:57:35.500 --> 2:57:38.500]  We thought that all the rest is blanks.
[2:57:38.500 --> 2:57:39.500]  Everything is shooting.
[2:57:39.500 --> 2:57:43.500]  Your republic is not a republic if you don't have democracy.
[2:57:43.500 --> 2:57:46.500]  One person, one vote.
[2:57:46.500 --> 2:57:49.500]  Have an informed vote.
[2:57:49.500 --> 2:57:56.500]  Google, and all the other agencies that are silencing you
[2:57:56.500 --> 2:58:02.500]  wanted to keep you uninformed so you don't make a decision, an informed decision,
[2:58:02.500 --> 2:58:04.500]  riley against them.
[2:58:04.500 --> 2:58:09.500]  And then, once that decision is taken, don't let the minority overrule the majority.
[2:58:09.500 --> 2:58:10.500]  That's not what democracy is.
[2:58:10.500 --> 2:58:13.500]  Democracy is only an instrument to make decisions.
[2:58:13.500 --> 2:58:17.500]  President Trump can make the greatest contribution to American future
[2:58:17.500 --> 2:58:22.500]  by simply making sure that with the following he has and the rallies he carries,
[2:58:22.500 --> 2:58:28.500]  he elects a group of people, 12, 13 experienced politicians that are going to make sure
[2:58:28.500 --> 2:58:32.500]  that the democracy that they're elected on represents the American people.
[2:58:32.500 --> 2:58:33.500]  Very well said.
[2:58:33.500 --> 2:58:34.500]  Thank you, Carlos.
[2:58:34.500 --> 2:58:36.500]  All right.
[2:58:36.500 --> 2:58:37.500]  Dr. Francis Boyle is going to join us.
[2:58:37.500 --> 2:58:38.500]  We're going to go to break in 15 seconds.
[2:58:38.500 --> 2:58:40.500]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[2:58:40.500 --> 2:58:44.500]  And the audience, you've already heard all that you're about to hear 20 times.
[2:58:44.500 --> 2:58:47.500]  Because we're a year and three months ahead of it.
[2:58:47.500 --> 2:58:50.500]  But now, what does it mean that it's coming out now?
[2:58:50.500 --> 2:58:53.500]  And what are the ramifications with Dr. Francis Boyle?
[2:58:53.500 --> 2:58:57.500]  I'm driving home at 7 o'clock at night on Monday night to see my family.
[2:58:57.500 --> 2:59:02.500]  And I just remember there's only two days left for our wonderful listeners to get incredibly
[2:59:02.500 --> 2:59:06.500]  high-quality, storable food at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere at
[2:59:06.500 --> 2:59:07.500]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[2:59:07.500 --> 2:59:12.500]  These are 20, 20 prices for a limited time for our listeners.
[2:59:12.500 --> 2:59:14.500]  The price isn't just going to go back to regular.
[2:59:14.500 --> 2:59:15.500]  It's going to have to go up.
[2:59:15.500 --> 2:59:19.500]  Everybody else has already raised prices way more than my Patreon.
[2:59:19.500 --> 2:59:24.500]  We have their entire spectrum and catalog at infowarstore.com, PrepareWithAlex.com.
[2:59:24.500 --> 2:59:30.500]  You get an additional 10% off on three months, six months, your supplies, and everything
[2:59:30.500 --> 2:59:32.500]  else on the site.
[2:59:32.500 --> 2:59:34.500]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[2:59:34.500 --> 2:59:36.500]  I would take advantage of this.
[2:59:36.500 --> 2:59:39.500]  But what's happening in food price increases around the world?
[2:59:39.500 --> 2:59:43.500]  I predict that by the fall you're going to see major shortages and you're going to see
[2:59:43.500 --> 2:59:44.500]  huge price increases.
[2:59:44.500 --> 2:59:49.500]  I think it's a smart bet right now to get high-quality, storable food at last year's
[2:59:49.500 --> 3:00:12.500]  price, while you still can at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[3:00:19.500 --> 3:00:37.500]  Well, my friends, a lot of explosive historic things are happening here.
[3:00:37.500 --> 3:00:41.500]  And Dr. Francis Boyle has been coming on the show for at least 20 years.
[3:00:41.500 --> 3:00:42.500]  He's an author, researcher.
[3:00:42.500 --> 3:00:45.500]  He got the special PhD at Harvard.
[3:00:45.500 --> 3:00:49.500]  Only one person a year gets under Henry Kissinger on globalism and how the new world
[3:00:49.500 --> 3:00:50.500]  order really operates.
[3:00:50.500 --> 3:00:54.500]  He also went to the Chicago Business School where they also do their training.
[3:00:54.500 --> 3:00:56.500]  And he's been exposing it for decades.
[3:00:56.500 --> 3:00:59.500]  He's been a top war crimes prosecutor at the UN.
[3:00:59.500 --> 3:01:00.500]  He wrote the U.S.
[3:01:00.500 --> 3:01:02.500]  Biological Weapons Law in the early 1990s.
[3:01:02.500 --> 3:01:05.500]  He contributed heavily to world law.
[3:01:05.500 --> 3:01:10.500]  And so he's probably the best guess you can get on because he's the leading expert on
[3:01:10.500 --> 3:01:13.500]  the law on chemical biological weapons.
[3:01:13.500 --> 3:01:16.500]  And he's got the hands down and also prosecuting people.
[3:01:16.500 --> 3:01:20.500]  So yesterday, I didn't do that for headlines and I figured it wouldn't get a lot of headlines
[3:01:20.500 --> 3:01:23.500]  it did for media matters and others because they know people talking about this.
[3:01:23.500 --> 3:01:29.500]  And I said, clearly now, everything Dr. Boyle said 14, 50 months ago here has been proven.
[3:01:29.500 --> 3:01:35.500]  You have, and I'll go over some of the names here and I'll look at it yesterday, you have
[3:01:35.500 --> 3:01:42.500]  Dr. Peter Dazek hiring Ralph S. Barrett from North Carolina in 2015 when there was media
[3:01:42.500 --> 3:01:44.500]  attention on the gain of function illegality.
[3:01:44.500 --> 3:01:49.500]  They moved it to Wuhan working with the Chinese military and others, but six programs funded
[3:01:49.500 --> 3:01:58.500]  by Fauci and by Gates directly to the tune of 3,748,000 plus on gain of function.
[3:01:58.500 --> 3:02:03.500]  We have the video of him saying we got five viruses to merge them to build a vaccine.
[3:02:03.500 --> 3:02:09.500]  Exactly what Boyle said on our show in February of last year and that they were going to develop
[3:02:09.500 --> 3:02:11.500]  the bio weapon to make the vaccine.
[3:02:11.500 --> 3:02:12.500]  He says it on the video.
[3:02:12.500 --> 3:02:19.500]  This is the director of the program who was directly got the waiver from Fauci and the
[3:02:19.500 --> 3:02:24.500]  federal agency that he headed up the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
[3:02:24.500 --> 3:02:29.500]  Then he writes the Lancet report and that's come out as colleagues leaked it, he confirms
[3:02:29.500 --> 3:02:33.500]  it's real that he wrote the report saying no connection to Wuhan and said don't put us
[3:02:33.500 --> 3:02:35.500]  in there, they'll know we're covering up.
[3:02:35.500 --> 3:02:37.500]  Smoking gun after smoking gun.
[3:02:37.500 --> 3:02:44.500]  So what is the penalty for building a biological weapon illegally and accidentally letting it
[3:02:44.500 --> 3:02:47.500]  out versus which is all been proven.
[3:02:47.500 --> 3:02:50.500]  Boyle said a year and three months ago has been all vetted and proven now.
[3:02:50.500 --> 3:02:53.500]  This is beyond Pulitzer prize stuff.
[3:02:53.500 --> 3:02:56.500]  He doesn't care about that, but that's the level of this.
[3:02:56.500 --> 3:03:04.500]  Then what does it mean with all the preparation, the power grab, the operation lockstep, the
[3:03:04.500 --> 3:03:08.500]  end game we're witnessing with Clough Schwab and the great reset how they've gotten all
[3:03:08.500 --> 3:03:11.500]  this power and these companies have all doubled, dribbled their wealth.
[3:03:11.500 --> 3:03:15.500]  I believe they released it on purpose to lock down the world and bring you in control.
[3:03:15.500 --> 3:03:19.500]  Boyle at least disagrees with me because it hasn't been proven yet, but that's where
[3:03:19.500 --> 3:03:20.500]  I see this going.
[3:03:20.500 --> 3:03:25.500]  We'll cover that maybe at the end of the interview, but I want to mention this, go to him now.
[3:03:25.500 --> 3:03:26.500]  It's all over the news.
[3:03:26.500 --> 3:03:27.500]  Rand Paul is bringing it up.
[3:03:27.500 --> 3:03:33.500]  Fauci lies when I have NIH websites saying they fund gain of function under Fauci's direction
[3:03:33.500 --> 3:03:36.500]  as late as 2017 in the U.S.
[3:03:36.500 --> 3:03:39.500]  So people are charged for lying to Congress.
[3:03:39.500 --> 3:03:43.500]  So there is a smorgasbord of importance here.
[3:03:43.500 --> 3:03:48.500]  And so I'm going to leave it up to Dr. Boyle to think where we should go first in this.
[3:03:48.500 --> 3:03:50.500]  But I know you don't care about vindication.
[3:03:50.500 --> 3:03:52.500]  You care about stopping this madness.
[3:03:52.500 --> 3:03:54.500]  You also point out that the Franken shots are illegal.
[3:03:54.500 --> 3:03:59.500]  Another violation of the Nuremberg code, which is punishable by death.
[3:03:59.500 --> 3:04:04.500]  And so give us your expert take on this full spectrum.
[3:04:04.500 --> 3:04:07.500]  What area should we tackle first, Professor?
[3:04:07.500 --> 3:04:12.500]  Well, thank you for having me on, Alex, my best year viewing audience.
[3:04:12.500 --> 3:04:19.500]  I think Senator Paul did a great job yesterday nailing Fauci's wall.
[3:04:19.500 --> 3:04:27.500]  And I would encourage that you put the entire interchange there on InfoWars so people can
[3:04:27.500 --> 3:04:31.500]  see it because the New York Times had almost nothing on it.
[3:04:31.500 --> 3:04:38.500]  Just a little blur basically making fun of Senator Paul as we both know he's an ophthalmologist,
[3:04:38.500 --> 3:04:46.500]  which is a high degree of specialty in medical training and obviously a very bright man.
[3:04:46.500 --> 3:04:51.500]  Well, as I've said before, we are fighting humanity.
[3:04:51.500 --> 3:04:53.500]  World War III here.
[3:04:53.500 --> 3:04:55.500]  It's a two-front war.
[3:04:55.500 --> 3:05:01.500]  First against COVID-19 and second against the Franken shots.
[3:05:01.500 --> 3:05:06.500]  And now, as you know, regretfully, it's just been reported.
[3:05:06.500 --> 3:05:10.500]  They are going to start giving the Franken shots to 12 to 15-year-olds.
[3:05:10.500 --> 3:05:13.500]  This is our future of humanity.
[3:05:13.500 --> 3:05:19.500]  And here in America, this is our children and our grandchildren, the next generation.
[3:05:19.500 --> 3:05:25.500]  These kids are going to be poisoned in their system from the get-go.
[3:05:25.500 --> 3:05:35.500]  We have no idea, not just the deaths here, but also the disabilities that are going to inflict them for the rest of their lives.
[3:05:35.500 --> 3:05:41.500]  This is Dr. Mengele and Auschwitz type stuff we are dealing with here.
[3:05:41.500 --> 3:05:53.500]  So I'm afraid we're just going to have to do a two-front war here like World War II that my dad fought in in Europe and the Pacific.
[3:05:53.500 --> 3:05:58.500]  We have COVID-19 and we have the Franken shots.
[3:05:58.500 --> 3:06:06.500]  We have to stop the Franken shots immediately and especially so they do not start giving them to our children.
[3:06:06.500 --> 3:06:10.500]  They're predicting they'll be ready to go soon.
[3:06:10.500 --> 3:06:13.500]  No later than the end of the summer.
[3:06:13.500 --> 3:06:18.500]  That has to be stopped dead in the water.
[3:06:18.500 --> 3:06:26.500]  There's no question at all about it for the next generation of humanity.
[3:06:26.500 --> 3:06:39.500]  Now that it's come out that COVID-19 is an offensive biological warfare weapon that has been DNA genetically engineered
[3:06:39.500 --> 3:06:41.500]  It has gain of function.
[3:06:41.500 --> 3:06:44.500]  It has synthetic biology.
[3:06:44.500 --> 3:06:50.500]  It also has nanotechnology on there so it can float in the air.
[3:06:50.500 --> 3:06:54.500]  Well, of course, these Franken shots aren't going to deal with it.
[3:06:54.500 --> 3:07:06.500]  That is why Barrick at UNC, when they did put this whole thing together with the Bat Queen from Wuhan BSL4
[3:07:06.500 --> 3:07:12.500]  and we have to understand that Wuhan BSL4 is China's 4D trick.
[3:07:12.500 --> 3:07:20.500]  They did not move into developing a vaccine because they knew a vaccine was hopeless.
[3:07:20.500 --> 3:07:27.500]  There was no way you could possibly have any type of safe and effective vaccine for offensive biological warfare.
[3:07:27.500 --> 3:07:30.500]  It's not about credit. It's about reality. People are listening to you now.
[3:07:30.500 --> 3:07:32.500]  You didn't just call that it was from the lab.
[3:07:32.500 --> 3:07:38.500]  You called that you can't have a vaccine for it, which the scientists said they still went ahead with one
[3:07:38.500 --> 3:07:43.500]  that instead attacks proteins in the body, which it turns out Fauci did studies at University of Texas,
[3:07:43.500 --> 3:07:48.500]  level four lab in 2012, and they told him, don't make vaccines, extreme caution.
[3:07:48.500 --> 3:07:51.500]  It causes blood plots in the rats.
[3:07:51.500 --> 3:07:53.500]  I mean, this is insane.
[3:07:53.500 --> 3:07:56.500]  I read that study. You're right.
[3:07:56.500 --> 3:07:58.500]  They were warned on this from the beginning.
[3:07:58.500 --> 3:08:01.500]  I'm sure Fauci do all about it.
[3:08:01.500 --> 3:08:06.500]  And again, not to toot my own horn, but on January 24, 2020,
[3:08:06.500 --> 3:08:15.500]  I also said that this undoubtedly involved a gain of function DNA genetic engineering, which it did.
[3:08:15.500 --> 3:08:17.500]  Yeah, you said it before the Indians even said it.
[3:08:17.500 --> 3:08:21.500]  And again, it's about people that are listening to you because you've been dead on, dead on.
[3:08:21.500 --> 3:08:25.500]  I respect you so much. Maybe you're right. It was an accident because I start and I'm like,
[3:08:25.500 --> 3:08:27.500]  I start asking, why would they do something so crazy?
[3:08:27.500 --> 3:08:33.500]  Why would they make a five-stage weapon virus and then release the damn thing?
[3:08:33.500 --> 3:08:42.500]  Well, Alex, look, I've been opposing DNA genetic engineering for biological warfare purposes
[3:08:42.500 --> 3:08:49.500]  since shortly after I joined the Council for Responsible Genetics in 1993,
[3:08:49.500 --> 3:08:54.500]  and they asked me to handle their biological warfare weapons work for them.
[3:08:54.500 --> 3:08:59.500]  Alex, this is all Nazi type science.
[3:08:59.500 --> 3:09:05.500]  The people who do this, the scientists who do this, they have a Nazi mentality.
[3:09:05.500 --> 3:09:08.500]  We must understand that.
[3:09:08.500 --> 3:09:12.500]  And it's been that way for as long as I've been fighting these people.
[3:09:12.500 --> 3:09:16.500]  They do not care. It's that simple.
[3:09:16.500 --> 3:09:28.500]  When I first publicly blew the whistle on this and a briefing on Capitol Hill,
[3:09:28.500 --> 3:09:34.500]  I guess it was 1985. I began working for CRG 1983.
[3:09:34.500 --> 3:09:36.500]  And I said we had to stop this.
[3:09:36.500 --> 3:09:39.500]  So let's talk about how we stop it.
[3:09:39.500 --> 3:09:43.500]  The laws are in place, national laws, local laws, international laws.
[3:09:43.500 --> 3:09:46.500]  The whole situation with the Nuremberg Code.
[3:09:46.500 --> 3:09:49.500]  With Dr. Francis Bowling, I'm Alex Jones. This could not be a more important subject.
[3:09:49.500 --> 3:09:51.500]  Everybody you know, tune in now.
[3:09:51.500 --> 3:09:55.500]  14 months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day
[3:09:55.500 --> 3:09:58.500]  when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[3:09:58.500 --> 3:10:02.500]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts
[3:10:02.500 --> 3:10:06.500]  that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction
[3:10:06.500 --> 3:10:10.500]  that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world.
[3:10:10.500 --> 3:10:13.500]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States.
[3:10:13.500 --> 3:10:16.500]  That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers
[3:10:16.500 --> 3:10:20.500]  that could barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down.
[3:10:20.500 --> 3:10:23.500]  Plus, the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down along with other pipelines.
[3:10:23.500 --> 3:10:27.500]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[3:10:27.500 --> 3:10:30.500]  We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well.
[3:10:30.500 --> 3:10:33.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[3:10:33.500 --> 3:10:36.500]  The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed.
[3:10:36.500 --> 3:10:38.500]  Until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-com takeover,
[3:10:38.500 --> 3:10:40.500]  a great reset, you have no hope.
[3:10:40.500 --> 3:10:45.500]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[3:10:45.500 --> 3:10:48.500]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another
[3:10:48.500 --> 3:10:51.500]  and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[3:10:51.500 --> 3:10:56.500]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia
[3:10:56.500 --> 3:11:01.500]  with no evidence for the shutdown of the East Coast Gasoline Pipeline
[3:11:01.500 --> 3:11:03.500]  that goes from Houston right up through New York City
[3:11:03.500 --> 3:11:06.500]  and supplies more than half of the gasoline to the East Coast.
[3:11:06.500 --> 3:11:09.500]  But who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline
[3:11:09.500 --> 3:11:13.500]  from Canada through the Midwest to Houston to refine the oil
[3:11:13.500 --> 3:11:16.500]  that's then turned into gas instead of the East Coast?
[3:11:16.500 --> 3:11:21.500]  That's right. Joe Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline right after it was completed.
[3:11:21.500 --> 3:11:26.500]  Joe Biden did that to America. He has the history. He has the background.
[3:11:26.500 --> 3:11:29.500]  He's the one that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels.
[3:11:29.500 --> 3:11:33.500]  He's the one that's trying to extend the lockdowns of the country.
[3:11:33.500 --> 3:11:38.500]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world
[3:11:38.500 --> 3:11:41.500]  and they want the United States, Europe and Australia crippled
[3:11:41.500 --> 3:11:43.500]  so Communist China can be dominant.
[3:11:43.500 --> 3:11:46.500]  It's not Russia that's the enemy. It's Communist China
[3:11:46.500 --> 3:11:49.500]  and there are millions like Joe Biden in control of the White House.
[3:11:49.500 --> 3:12:08.500]  That's the facts. That's the information.
[3:12:08.500 --> 3:12:10.500]  Welcome back, folks. Alex Jones here.
[3:12:10.500 --> 3:12:16.500]  On Monday night, Tucker Carlson went on in a 14-minute piece that took a lot of courage.
[3:12:16.500 --> 3:12:19.500]  His contract lets him do whatever he wants.
[3:12:19.500 --> 3:12:22.500]  He's the only person in the Fox that has a contract like that.
[3:12:22.500 --> 3:12:27.500]  And he will not be silenced and he knocks it out of the park.
[3:12:27.500 --> 3:12:31.500]  And I noticed that Fox always posts his full show on YouTube.
[3:12:31.500 --> 3:12:34.500]  They didn't post it that day and they still haven't as of this morning
[3:12:34.500 --> 3:12:37.500]  because they don't want you knowing about this because if this comes out,
[3:12:37.500 --> 3:12:43.500]  it's over for the out-of-control big farm, which is the heart of the global corporate UN system,
[3:12:43.500 --> 3:12:47.500]  which isn't the UN. The UN just represents these big mega corporations
[3:12:47.500 --> 3:12:51.500]  that are extremely authoritarian who have this attitude of,
[3:12:51.500 --> 3:12:54.500]  oh, the blood out of Arkansas has HIV in it.
[3:12:54.500 --> 3:12:57.500]  Let the hemophiliacs have it. They deserve to die.
[3:12:57.500 --> 3:13:00.500]  That came out in the Bayer situation.
[3:13:00.500 --> 3:13:03.500]  Just like Bayer and Monsanto and the Roundup.
[3:13:03.500 --> 3:13:06.500]  They knew that was killing people they didn't care.
[3:13:06.500 --> 3:13:10.500]  But it's beyond not caring. And you mentioned this, Dr. Boyle,
[3:13:10.500 --> 3:13:14.500]  we do have the full seven-minute exchange between Fauci and
[3:13:14.500 --> 3:13:17.500]  Senator Paul posted a Band-Aid video.
[3:13:17.500 --> 3:13:20.500]  And I've got a short clip I'll play next segment of it.
[3:13:20.500 --> 3:13:23.500]  But you talk about immunization with SARS, coronavirus vaccine,
[3:13:23.500 --> 3:13:26.500]  laser pulmonary, immunopathology, University of Texas,
[3:13:26.500 --> 3:13:32.500]  federally funded study that Fauci funded out of the same institute of allergy
[3:13:32.500 --> 3:13:35.500]  and infectious diseases that he was heading.
[3:13:35.500 --> 3:13:37.500]  And it's heavily studied.
[3:13:37.500 --> 3:13:41.500]  Wolfgang Wudarg, who was on a major advisory board to the EU,
[3:13:41.500 --> 3:13:44.500]  and Dr. Hedon, the former chief scientist at Pfizer,
[3:13:44.500 --> 3:13:48.500]  they signed a letter in December warning of this protein spike,
[3:13:48.500 --> 3:13:51.500]  having the body attack itself.
[3:13:51.500 --> 3:13:54.500]  And now we're seeing that record heart attacks, strokes,
[3:13:54.500 --> 3:13:58.500]  even in young people that are taking this mRNA shot,
[3:13:58.500 --> 3:14:00.500]  but also the others that do a similar thing.
[3:14:00.500 --> 3:14:02.500]  Why would they do that?
[3:14:02.500 --> 3:14:05.500]  And I know you're not supposed to ask why evil does what it does,
[3:14:05.500 --> 3:14:07.500]  it's crazy, it wants power.
[3:14:07.500 --> 3:14:08.500]  Why did Hitler do what he did?
[3:14:08.500 --> 3:14:10.500]  Why did Stalin do what he did?
[3:14:10.500 --> 3:14:13.500]  But I still, I don't ever see him getting away with this.
[3:14:13.500 --> 3:14:17.500]  I mean, Fauci's on record running those gain-of-function projects
[3:14:17.500 --> 3:14:19.500]  before all this came out.
[3:14:19.500 --> 3:14:22.500]  Now his own people are on video bragging about it?
[3:14:22.500 --> 3:14:25.500]  I mean, it's just, are they megalomaniacs?
[3:14:25.500 --> 3:14:27.500]  Do they think they're invincible?
[3:14:27.500 --> 3:14:28.500]  You've been around these people.
[3:14:28.500 --> 3:14:31.500]  What's wrong with them?
[3:14:31.500 --> 3:14:35.500]  Well, I ask, again, you point out,
[3:14:35.500 --> 3:14:39.500]  I've pointed out this Nazi mentality,
[3:14:39.500 --> 3:14:43.500]  certainly there at Harvard when I spent seven years there
[3:14:43.500 --> 3:14:46.500]  going through the exact same PhD program
[3:14:46.500 --> 3:14:52.500]  that produced Kissinger, Brzezinski, Huntington,
[3:14:52.500 --> 3:14:57.500]  McGeorge Bundy, the architect of the Vietnam War
[3:14:57.500 --> 3:15:01.500]  for Kennedy and Johnson, taught in the Harvard Government
[3:15:01.500 --> 3:15:03.500]  Department before I did.
[3:15:03.500 --> 3:15:08.500]  So this goes back at least that far to the Kennedy Administration,
[3:15:08.500 --> 3:15:12.500]  my direct personal experience.
[3:15:12.500 --> 3:15:16.500]  So they just like the power of life and death over people.
[3:15:16.500 --> 3:15:20.500]  Well, you really have to study the Nazis, Alex.
[3:15:20.500 --> 3:15:24.500]  As you said, why did Hitler set out to exterminate the Jews?
[3:15:24.500 --> 3:15:28.500]  It made no sense, even Hannah Arendt pointed this out
[3:15:28.500 --> 3:15:32.500]  in her classic work, Origins of Totalitarianism,
[3:15:32.500 --> 3:15:36.500]  that militarily it was totally insane for Hitler
[3:15:36.500 --> 3:15:41.500]  to be devoting all those resources to exterminating the Jews
[3:15:41.500 --> 3:15:44.500]  when he was losing World War II on both fronts.
[3:15:44.500 --> 3:15:48.500]  It appears to be insanity to most people,
[3:15:48.500 --> 3:15:53.500]  but if you have this Nazi mentality, it makes perfect sense.
[3:15:53.500 --> 3:15:59.500]  And you are correct that Klaus Schwab there of Davos
[3:15:59.500 --> 3:16:03.500]  said Kissinger was one of his mentors at Harvard.
[3:16:03.500 --> 3:16:05.500]  Kissinger is absolutely evil.
[3:16:05.500 --> 3:16:08.500]  I went through the exact same PhD program at Harvard.
[3:16:08.500 --> 3:16:11.500]  They gave me Kissinger's old office there
[3:16:11.500 --> 3:16:13.500]  at Harvard Center for International Affairs.
[3:16:13.500 --> 3:16:17.500]  Harvard trained me to be a Kissinger for my generation.
[3:16:17.500 --> 3:16:20.500]  Yes, this is what goes on.
[3:16:20.500 --> 3:16:26.500]  How do we stop this madness?
[3:16:26.500 --> 3:16:31.500]  Well, I think first of all, just looking at the agenda,
[3:16:31.500 --> 3:16:34.500]  we have to save our children from these franken shots.
[3:16:34.500 --> 3:16:35.500]  That's for sure.
[3:16:35.500 --> 3:16:40.500]  And we do have time between now and the end of the summer
[3:16:40.500 --> 3:16:46.500]  when they say that they're going to start a mass inoculation
[3:16:46.500 --> 3:16:49.500]  with franken shots of our 12 to 15-year-old children.
[3:16:49.500 --> 3:16:51.500]  That's the future.
[3:16:51.500 --> 3:16:56.500]  We're making, I think, progress on convincing adults
[3:16:56.500 --> 3:16:59.500]  not to take these franken shots.
[3:16:59.500 --> 3:17:02.500]  We have to keep doing that.
[3:17:02.500 --> 3:17:03.500]  There's no question about it.
[3:17:03.500 --> 3:17:05.500]  I'm going to have vaccine centers off property,
[3:17:05.500 --> 3:17:07.500]  but I'm going to get with huge PA systems.
[3:17:07.500 --> 3:17:10.500]  I'm going to read them the news articles about the trials
[3:17:10.500 --> 3:17:12.500]  where as young as two-year-olds are having heart attacks
[3:17:12.500 --> 3:17:14.500]  and dying after they take it.
[3:17:14.500 --> 3:17:16.500]  And Big Pharma just moves forward.
[3:17:16.500 --> 3:17:18.500]  Healthy two-year-olds have heart attacks and die.
[3:17:18.500 --> 3:17:21.500]  And 15-year-olds have heart attacks and die in the studies.
[3:17:21.500 --> 3:17:23.500]  And they just keep going forward.
[3:17:23.500 --> 3:17:24.500]  Right.
[3:17:24.500 --> 3:17:29.500]  Just go back also and read the Nazi doctor's medical case
[3:17:29.500 --> 3:17:33.500]  at Nuremberg to see what the Nazi doctors were doing.
[3:17:33.500 --> 3:17:36.500]  And several of them were convicted.
[3:17:36.500 --> 3:17:39.500]  And if you were executed, that was done by us.
[3:17:39.500 --> 3:17:44.500]  So I'm afraid, I know this is hard for people to accept,
[3:17:44.500 --> 3:17:47.500]  but the best precedent for what we're dealing with there
[3:17:47.500 --> 3:17:54.500]  were Hitler and the Nazis, at least in my recent experience.
[3:17:54.500 --> 3:17:58.500]  Second, Fort Dietrich has a manual
[3:17:58.500 --> 3:18:04.500]  on how to contain biological warfare agents
[3:18:04.500 --> 3:18:08.500]  and how to remediate biological warfare agents.
[3:18:08.500 --> 3:18:13.500]  You see these death scientists like Fauci,
[3:18:13.500 --> 3:18:17.500]  who's done 97% of this, going back to Reagan
[3:18:17.500 --> 3:18:23.500]  and his neocons, who wanted to get into using biological warfare
[3:18:23.500 --> 3:18:27.500]  with DNA genetic engineering.
[3:18:27.500 --> 3:18:29.500]  And let me give you a little bit of what Dick Cheney wrote
[3:18:29.500 --> 3:18:34.500]  in April's 2000 Rebuilding America's Defenses for PNAC,
[3:18:34.500 --> 3:18:37.500]  we need to work through the media to legitimize the use
[3:18:37.500 --> 3:18:41.500]  in the near future of race-specific bio weapons, close quote.
[3:18:41.500 --> 3:18:45.500]  Right, that's right in the PNAC report, Alex.
[3:18:45.500 --> 3:18:49.500]  I cite that in my book, Biowarfare and Terrorism,
[3:18:49.500 --> 3:18:53.500]  the neocons, and I think that might have been drafted
[3:18:53.500 --> 3:18:55.500]  by Bolton himself.
[3:18:55.500 --> 3:18:58.500]  The neocons fully supported biological warfare
[3:18:58.500 --> 3:19:03.500]  and race-specific biological warfare as well, sure.
[3:19:03.500 --> 3:19:06.500]  Outright genocide, there's no question for it.
[3:19:06.500 --> 3:19:09.500]  But Fort Dietrich has a manual.
[3:19:09.500 --> 3:19:17.500]  The problem, Alex, is all this communist dictatorship propaganda
[3:19:17.500 --> 3:19:23.500]  about the Wuhan wet market prevented us right from the get-go
[3:19:23.500 --> 3:19:27.500]  to come to grips with COVID-19.
[3:19:27.500 --> 3:19:31.500]  This is not natural or anything at all like that.
[3:19:31.500 --> 3:19:36.500]  As I said in my worldwide media alert, January 24th,
[3:19:36.500 --> 3:19:41.500]  it's an existentially dangerous offensive biological warfare
[3:19:41.500 --> 3:19:46.500]  weapon. Fauci knew that early on.
[3:19:46.500 --> 3:19:50.500]  Redfield, the former director of the CDC,
[3:19:50.500 --> 3:19:54.500]  in his interview on CNN said, yes, this, the leak happened
[3:19:54.500 --> 3:19:57.500]  over there at the end of September or early October.
[3:19:57.500 --> 3:19:58.500]  Sure, they knew about it.
[3:19:58.500 --> 3:20:01.500]  And that's what you said back in February last year.
[3:20:01.500 --> 3:20:02.500]  They knew about it.
[3:20:02.500 --> 3:20:04.500]  They knew about the leak.
[3:20:04.500 --> 3:20:09.500]  They knew all they had to do was call up the Barrick contract
[3:20:09.500 --> 3:20:15.500]  and article on the NIH and Nyei Fauci computer.
[3:20:15.500 --> 3:20:17.500]  They saw it right there.
[3:20:17.500 --> 3:20:21.500]  And instead of acting immediately and effectively to stop it,
[3:20:21.500 --> 3:20:24.500]  they just let it move on.
[3:20:24.500 --> 3:20:26.500]  Stay there.
[3:20:26.500 --> 3:20:27.500]  You're using technical jargon.
[3:20:27.500 --> 3:20:29.500]  We're going to explain what you mean when we come back.
[3:20:29.500 --> 3:20:30.500]  They were running the program.
[3:20:30.500 --> 3:20:33.500]  They knew exactly what was there and how deadly it was
[3:20:33.500 --> 3:20:34.500]  and what they were up to.
[3:20:34.500 --> 3:20:36.500]  We'll be right back with our special guest,
[3:20:36.500 --> 3:20:38.500]  Dr. Francis Boyle, to stay with us.
[3:20:38.500 --> 3:20:41.500]  This is history happening right now.
[3:20:41.500 --> 3:20:43.500]  And as he predicted, they were doing it to test
[3:20:43.500 --> 3:20:45.500]  for a future vaccine.
[3:20:45.500 --> 3:20:51.500]  So we'll talk about that when we come back.
[3:20:51.500 --> 3:20:54.500]  You know, listeners call into the cell when they thank me,
[3:20:54.500 --> 3:20:58.500]  and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there
[3:20:58.500 --> 3:21:01.500]  and I beg you for support constantly for prayer,
[3:21:01.500 --> 3:21:04.500]  for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[3:21:04.500 --> 3:21:06.500]  And we're all in this together.
[3:21:06.500 --> 3:21:08.500]  It gets old having a company and say,
[3:21:08.500 --> 3:21:10.500]  hey, I've got great products, please buy them
[3:21:10.500 --> 3:21:11.500]  or we won't be here on air.
[3:21:11.500 --> 3:21:12.500]  But it's true.
[3:21:12.500 --> 3:21:14.500]  We're the only media organization in the United States
[3:21:14.500 --> 3:21:16.500]  that promotes liberty at this level
[3:21:16.500 --> 3:21:18.500]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:21:18.500 --> 3:21:20.500]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:21:20.500 --> 3:21:22.500]  They crippled all the other groups.
[3:21:22.500 --> 3:21:23.500]  And we're still here.
[3:21:23.500 --> 3:21:26.500]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open,
[3:21:26.500 --> 3:21:27.500]  our credibility is showing up.
[3:21:27.500 --> 3:21:29.500]  That's why we've got to be taken off there.
[3:21:29.500 --> 3:21:30.500]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:21:30.500 --> 3:21:32.500]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved.
[3:21:32.500 --> 3:21:34.500]  And America is still quasi-free.
[3:21:34.500 --> 3:21:36.500]  You can't have info wars that's been proven right
[3:21:36.500 --> 3:21:39.500]  being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:21:39.500 --> 3:21:42.500]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:21:42.500 --> 3:21:43.500]  So thank you all.
[3:21:43.500 --> 3:21:44.500]  And get an infowarstore.com.
[3:21:44.500 --> 3:21:46.500]  Get some great 2020 election shirts.
[3:21:46.500 --> 3:21:48.500]  Supplement them so much more.
[3:21:48.500 --> 3:21:49.500]  They're a wonderful product.
[3:21:49.500 --> 3:21:50.500]  And they support the info.
[3:21:50.500 --> 3:21:51.500]  We're thanking you.
[3:21:51.500 --> 3:21:54.500]  When listeners call into the show and thank me for all I've done,
[3:21:54.500 --> 3:21:57.500]  I always stop them and I say, thank you for what you've done.
[3:21:57.500 --> 3:22:00.500]  Thank you for keeping info wars on the air.
[3:22:00.500 --> 3:22:01.500]  Thank you for praying for us.
[3:22:01.500 --> 3:22:03.500]  And thank you for spreading the word.
[3:22:03.500 --> 3:22:06.500]  If all of you will simply go to infowarstore.com
[3:22:06.500 --> 3:22:10.500]  and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or a droid,
[3:22:10.500 --> 3:22:14.500]  it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[3:22:14.500 --> 3:22:17.500]  It will remind you every day, like it does me and my family,
[3:22:17.500 --> 3:22:20.500]  and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[3:22:20.500 --> 3:22:21.500]  Not because you've done something wrong,
[3:22:21.500 --> 3:22:24.500]  but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalist
[3:22:24.500 --> 3:22:27.500]  are predatory and are evil, and in the surveillance state,
[3:22:27.500 --> 3:22:30.500]  we need to more and more start doing everything we can
[3:22:30.500 --> 3:22:32.500]  to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[3:22:32.500 --> 3:22:35.500]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.
[3:22:35.500 --> 3:22:38.500]  They're available at infowarstore.com in four different colors,
[3:22:38.500 --> 3:22:40.500]  and they are only $19.95.
[3:22:40.500 --> 3:22:44.500]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere.
[3:22:44.500 --> 3:22:47.500]  They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the info war.
[3:22:47.500 --> 3:22:48.500]  Please take action today.
[3:22:48.500 --> 3:22:51.500]  Protect your privacy and fund the info war.
[3:22:51.500 --> 3:22:54.500]  I'm driving home at 7 o'clock at night on Monday night
[3:22:54.500 --> 3:22:56.500]  to see my family.
[3:22:56.500 --> 3:22:58.500]  And I just remember there's only two days left
[3:22:58.500 --> 3:23:01.500]  for our wonderful listeners to get incredibly high quality,
[3:23:01.500 --> 3:23:04.500]  storeable food at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere
[3:23:04.500 --> 3:23:06.500]  at preparewithallux.com.
[3:23:06.500 --> 3:23:10.500]  These are 20, 20 prices for a limited time for our listeners.
[3:23:10.500 --> 3:23:12.500]  And then the price isn't just going to go back to regular,
[3:23:12.500 --> 3:23:13.500]  it should have to go up.
[3:23:13.500 --> 3:23:16.500]  Everybody else has already raised prices
[3:23:16.500 --> 3:23:17.500]  way more than my Patreon.
[3:23:17.500 --> 3:23:21.500]  We have their entire spectrum and catalog at infowarstore.com,
[3:23:21.500 --> 3:23:23.500]  preparewithallux.com.
[3:23:23.500 --> 3:23:26.500]  You get an additional 10% off on three months, six months,
[3:23:26.500 --> 3:23:30.500]  your supplies, and everything else on the site.
[3:23:30.500 --> 3:23:32.500]  Preparewithallux.com.
[3:23:32.500 --> 3:23:34.500]  I would take advantage of this with what's happening
[3:23:34.500 --> 3:23:37.500]  in food price increases around the world.
[3:23:37.500 --> 3:23:41.500]  I predict that by the fall you're going to see major shortages
[3:23:41.500 --> 3:23:43.500]  and you're going to see huge price increases.
[3:23:43.500 --> 3:23:46.500]  I think it's a smart bet right now to get high quality,
[3:23:46.500 --> 3:23:48.500]  storeable food at last year's prices
[3:23:48.500 --> 3:23:51.500]  while you still can at preparewithallux.com.
[3:23:51.500 --> 3:23:53.500]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[3:23:53.500 --> 3:23:55.500]  It's very bittersweet.
[3:23:55.500 --> 3:23:58.500]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[3:23:58.500 --> 3:24:00.500]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[3:24:00.500 --> 3:24:02.500]  I care about beating the new world order.
[3:24:02.500 --> 3:24:04.500]  And it's because we have so much credibility,
[3:24:04.500 --> 3:24:07.500]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[3:24:07.500 --> 3:24:10.500]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[3:24:10.500 --> 3:24:12.500]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[3:24:12.500 --> 3:24:15.500]  But let's just say this, we're going to see this through to the end.
[3:24:15.500 --> 3:24:18.500]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[3:24:18.500 --> 3:24:20.500]  So please pray for us and please buy the products.
[3:24:20.500 --> 3:24:22.500]  And then fullwarestore.com, they're great products.
[3:24:22.500 --> 3:24:24.500]  Plus they fund the operation.
[3:24:24.500 --> 3:24:27.500]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[3:24:27.500 --> 3:24:29.500]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[3:24:29.500 --> 3:24:33.500]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[3:24:33.500 --> 3:24:35.500]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[3:24:35.500 --> 3:24:37.500]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[3:24:37.500 --> 3:24:40.500]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[3:24:40.500 --> 3:24:44.500]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[3:24:44.500 --> 3:24:47.500]  Download everything we've done. You can find and save it.
[3:24:47.500 --> 3:24:49.500]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[3:24:49.500 --> 3:24:52.500]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[3:24:54.500 --> 3:24:57.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:24:57.500 --> 3:25:15.500]  I can tell you right now that the people that funded this
[3:25:15.500 --> 3:25:18.500]  to build gates is the Anthony Fauci's are not pleased.
[3:25:18.500 --> 3:25:22.500]  And I wanted to ask Dr. Francis Boyle to predict that all of this
[3:25:22.500 --> 3:25:26.500]  are accurately laid it all out and predict how deadly the vaccine would be
[3:25:26.500 --> 3:25:31.500]  and wouldn't help people to ask him more about how we defeat these people
[3:25:31.500 --> 3:25:33.500]  and how we educate the public.
[3:25:33.500 --> 3:25:35.500]  Because I'm always asking, why are they doing it?
[3:25:35.500 --> 3:25:37.500]  The public goes, well, there's no reason they do that.
[3:25:37.500 --> 3:25:39.500]  I mean, that's crazy. Well, because you're not crazy.
[3:25:39.500 --> 3:25:41.500]  So it is important to answer why they do it.
[3:25:41.500 --> 3:25:46.500]  Power, control, corporate domination, U.N. control, forced inoculation,
[3:25:46.500 --> 3:25:49.500]  medical tracking systems, a way to get around your medical records,
[3:25:49.500 --> 3:25:53.500]  the way to get big tech involved in your life, the social credit score.
[3:25:53.500 --> 3:25:56.500]  But I said this yesterday and I was very serious because I was wanting
[3:25:56.500 --> 3:25:57.500]  to get you on the show.
[3:25:57.500 --> 3:26:01.500]  This is just broken and you've talked about the Nuremberg Code
[3:26:01.500 --> 3:26:04.500]  and you've put this warning out.
[3:26:04.500 --> 3:26:07.500]  By authority of the Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation,
[3:26:07.500 --> 3:26:12.500]  I do hereby exercise my right to refuse to submit to or administer
[3:26:12.500 --> 3:26:13.500]  the COVID-19 vaccine.
[3:26:13.500 --> 3:26:16.500]  The United States government has prosecuted, convicted and executed
[3:26:16.500 --> 3:26:20.500]  medical doctors who have violated the Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation.
[3:26:20.500 --> 3:26:23.500]  And it goes, aiders and abetters of Nuremberg crimes are equally guilty
[3:26:23.500 --> 3:26:26.500]  and have also been prosecuted, convicted and executed.
[3:26:26.500 --> 3:26:28.500]  Well, here's media matters.
[3:26:28.500 --> 3:26:32.500]  I didn't say this to be a shock jock and I gave more of an expansion here.
[3:26:32.500 --> 3:26:35.500]  But I said, Bill Gates, Fauci from my evidence,
[3:26:35.500 --> 3:26:38.500]  are all funding this, all involved.
[3:26:38.500 --> 3:26:39.500]  And they should be charged.
[3:26:39.500 --> 3:26:42.500]  They should be investigated if they've been found guilty
[3:26:42.500 --> 3:26:45.500]  of producing an offensive biological weapon, whether they release it
[3:26:45.500 --> 3:26:47.500]  on purpose or whether it leaked, it's a crime.
[3:26:47.500 --> 3:26:50.500]  You wrote the U.S. law on biological warfare
[3:26:50.500 --> 3:26:53.500]  and put the death statue in there now law.
[3:26:53.500 --> 3:26:57.500]  As a lawyer, as a father, as an American,
[3:26:57.500 --> 3:26:59.500]  what do you think of my statement?
[3:26:59.500 --> 3:27:03.500]  Does it, because I'm not saying I want any violence against them.
[3:27:03.500 --> 3:27:04.500]  I don't want any vigilanteism.
[3:27:04.500 --> 3:27:06.500]  I'm saying what they're doing is war crime.
[3:27:06.500 --> 3:27:10.500]  What they're doing is experimental medicine, lying to us and saying it's safe,
[3:27:10.500 --> 3:27:12.500]  trying to force people on to it.
[3:27:12.500 --> 3:27:14.500]  And a lot of people are getting sick and dying.
[3:27:14.500 --> 3:27:17.500]  So what is the response to this?
[3:27:17.500 --> 3:27:20.500]  And what do you make of my statement?
[3:27:20.500 --> 3:27:22.500]  Yes.
[3:27:22.500 --> 3:27:28.500]  Everyone involved in the UNC BSL-3, all Americans,
[3:27:28.500 --> 3:27:35.500]  and also over at that Wuhan BSL-4, they all must be prosecuted
[3:27:35.500 --> 3:27:40.500]  under my biological weapons anti-terrorism act of 1989.
[3:27:40.500 --> 3:27:45.500]  One point I do disagree with you though there, Alex,
[3:27:45.500 --> 3:27:50.500]  the Department of Justice and the negotiations over my legislation,
[3:27:50.500 --> 3:27:55.500]  which by the way was passed exactly the way I wrote it, wanted,
[3:27:55.500 --> 3:27:58.500]  I originally put life imprisonment in there.
[3:27:58.500 --> 3:28:01.500]  The Department of Justice wanted the death penalty.
[3:28:01.500 --> 3:28:06.500]  I'm a lifelong abolitionist, I guess, going back to my mother.
[3:28:06.500 --> 3:28:09.500]  She told me I didn't get it from my father.
[3:28:09.500 --> 3:28:13.500]  So I resisted pressure to put the death penalty in there.
[3:28:13.500 --> 3:28:20.500]  So as of now, my legislation would only provide for life imprisonment.
[3:28:20.500 --> 3:28:21.500]  But you are correct.
[3:28:21.500 --> 3:28:26.500]  Fauci, everyone involved in COVID-19.
[3:28:26.500 --> 3:28:34.500]  And that would include, as we know from the Barrick article,
[3:28:34.500 --> 3:28:42.500]  we also have involved there, not only people at UNC,
[3:28:42.500 --> 3:28:45.500]  but also the Food and Drug Administration.
[3:28:45.500 --> 3:28:50.500]  And you'll note the Food and Drug Administration is the one
[3:28:50.500 --> 3:28:57.500]  that gave the emergency authorization use for the COVID-19 frankenshots, right?
[3:28:57.500 --> 3:29:03.500]  And the FDA now said, oh, well, now we're going to allow you to inject frankenshots into children.
[3:29:03.500 --> 3:29:08.500]  FDA is up to its eyeballs in COVID-19.
[3:29:08.500 --> 3:29:12.500]  And everyone involved in that, there's just one name here,
[3:29:12.500 --> 3:29:14.500]  but I'm sure more were involved.
[3:29:14.500 --> 3:29:16.500]  They should all be prosecuted.
[3:29:16.500 --> 3:29:21.500]  And FDA should be taken down for what they've done here.
[3:29:21.500 --> 3:29:30.500]  Likewise, Biden just pointed this Dr. Walensky from the Harvard Medical School.
[3:29:30.500 --> 3:29:33.500]  I don't know her personally.
[3:29:33.500 --> 3:29:37.500]  Harvard and the Harvard Medical School are up to their eyeballs in COVID-19.
[3:29:37.500 --> 3:29:43.500]  It says that right there on the Barrick article,
[3:29:43.500 --> 3:29:47.500]  the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School,
[3:29:47.500 --> 3:29:53.500]  you can't trust anything with Walensky or the CDC is telling us.
[3:29:53.500 --> 3:29:55.500]  And let me just correct myself.
[3:29:55.500 --> 3:29:56.500]  I was one for memory.
[3:29:56.500 --> 3:30:00.500]  I thought your legislation had a death penalty and I must have misunderstood,
[3:30:00.500 --> 3:30:02.500]  but I was just asking under the Nuremberg Code,
[3:30:02.500 --> 3:30:08.500]  what is the punishment for producing a biological weapon that you're intending to infect the public with?
[3:30:08.500 --> 3:30:12.500]  Well, of course, let me correct it that you are right.
[3:30:12.500 --> 3:30:17.500]  There is another federal statute that I do address in my book,
[3:30:17.500 --> 3:30:22.500]  Biowarfare and Terrorism, on the use of weapons of mass destruction
[3:30:22.500 --> 3:30:28.500]  that does provide for the death penalty if people die as a result of it.
[3:30:28.500 --> 3:30:34.500]  Right now, I'm not saying anyone deliberately used COVID-19.
[3:30:34.500 --> 3:30:37.500]  You and I can respectfully disagree,
[3:30:37.500 --> 3:30:41.500]  but so far I'm still going along with the leak,
[3:30:41.500 --> 3:30:43.500]  but it was a knowing leak.
[3:30:43.500 --> 3:30:46.500]  All these BSL-3s and BSL-4s leak.
[3:30:46.500 --> 3:30:55.500]  So the Nuremberg Code, per se, has not been put into United States criminal law.
[3:30:55.500 --> 3:30:57.500]  It is a requirement.
[3:30:57.500 --> 3:31:03.500]  It is an article of customary international criminal law,
[3:31:03.500 --> 3:31:08.500]  but the Supreme Court, and this is before Roberts and all the rest of them,
[3:31:08.500 --> 3:31:11.500]  has said as a requirement of due process of law,
[3:31:11.500 --> 3:31:18.500]  you really need to codify these types of requirements.
[3:31:18.500 --> 3:31:22.500]  Sure, but there is hope because you got them with suits and attention
[3:31:22.500 --> 3:31:24.500]  to stop the experimental anthrax shots.
[3:31:24.500 --> 3:31:27.500]  You were at the tip of the spear there that killed tens of thousands of U.S. troops.
[3:31:27.500 --> 3:31:28.500]  That's been confirmed.
[3:31:28.500 --> 3:31:31.500]  Even the Defense Department now admits those were killing people.
[3:31:31.500 --> 3:31:35.500]  So experimental drugs, experimental vaccines aren't even legal in the military,
[3:31:35.500 --> 3:31:38.500]  much less the citizens, and I see this live over the news.
[3:31:38.500 --> 3:31:41.500]  Like I saw it on Twitter, Alex Jones is a liar.
[3:31:41.500 --> 3:31:43.500]  The FDA has approved all these shots and says they're safe.
[3:31:43.500 --> 3:31:44.500]  None of that's true.
[3:31:44.500 --> 3:31:49.500]  In fact, the inserts on these drugs are blank.
[3:31:49.500 --> 3:31:50.500]  That's correct.
[3:31:50.500 --> 3:31:58.500]  And your viewing audience has to understand the FDA is up to its eyeballs
[3:31:58.500 --> 3:32:06.500]  in an offensive, biological warfare weapon, COVID-19, that is existentially dangerous.
[3:32:06.500 --> 3:32:09.500]  Their approval of anything is totally worthless.
[3:32:09.500 --> 3:32:13.500]  You cannot believe one word the FDA is telling you.
[3:32:13.500 --> 3:32:15.500]  And the same for the CDC.
[3:32:15.500 --> 3:32:18.500]  And that was true before Willensky.
[3:32:18.500 --> 3:32:25.500]  We know full well that the CDC was involved in biological warfare weapons work,
[3:32:25.500 --> 3:32:29.500]  at least going back to the Reagan administration.
[3:32:29.500 --> 3:32:34.500]  I have official government documents on that in my office.
[3:32:34.500 --> 3:32:35.500]  I'm hunkered down at home here.
[3:32:35.500 --> 3:32:39.500]  So you can't believe anything the CDC is telling you.
[3:32:39.500 --> 3:32:43.500]  They're just lying and covering it up, as is Fauci.
[3:32:43.500 --> 3:32:51.500]  Certainly Fauci, Basak, Barrick, and the rest of them must be prosecuted under my
[3:32:51.500 --> 3:32:57.500]  biological weapons anti-terrorism act and face life imprisonment for what they have done here
[3:32:57.500 --> 3:33:02.500]  and all the death and destruction and disability that they have inflicted.
[3:33:02.500 --> 3:33:03.500]  Yes.
[3:33:03.500 --> 3:33:11.500]  As for Gates, he's been very careful to stand behind the scenes and fund all this.
[3:33:11.500 --> 3:33:15.500]  So we need to find out what Gates knew.
[3:33:15.500 --> 3:33:24.500]  We need the FBI to go over there with search warrants from judges and get into Gates' home,
[3:33:24.500 --> 3:33:28.500]  his office, and most importantly, the Gates Foundation,
[3:33:28.500 --> 3:33:34.500]  and find out exactly what Gates knew, when did he know it, when did he know it,
[3:33:34.500 --> 3:33:38.500]  and what was he funding, what did he know about it.
[3:33:38.500 --> 3:33:44.500]  Because we also have, in addition to my biological weapons anti-terrorism act,
[3:33:44.500 --> 3:33:50.500]  we have the general federal statutes on conspiracy and aiding and abetting.
[3:33:50.500 --> 3:33:53.500]  And that would apply, I believe, to people like Gates.
[3:33:53.500 --> 3:34:01.500]  But we have to get more definite information on precisely what Gates himself was doing.
[3:34:01.500 --> 3:34:05.500]  Here I'm just speaking as a prosecutor trying to nail someone.
[3:34:05.500 --> 3:34:10.500]  As for the rest of them, we already have them in the, like Fauci and the rest of them,
[3:34:10.500 --> 3:34:15.500]  Basak, we already have them in the documents that were produced.
[3:34:15.500 --> 3:34:20.500]  Francis Collins, Fauci was lying yesterday.
[3:34:20.500 --> 3:34:23.500]  They were paused.
[3:34:23.500 --> 3:34:25.500]  I want to come back and play a few minutes of Rand Paul, get your final comment on that,
[3:34:25.500 --> 3:34:28.500]  and the fact that as a former top world prosecutor, and for the UN,
[3:34:28.500 --> 3:34:31.500]  with some of the logic that you're making more, you're saying that it's cut and dry.
[3:34:31.500 --> 3:34:33.500]  That's what I see. I see them.
[3:34:33.500 --> 3:34:37.500]  I see the head of the program admitting that they were combining five viruses.
[3:34:37.500 --> 3:34:38.500]  I'm getting chills.
[3:34:38.500 --> 3:34:40.500]  Well, they're right back in the final segment, and then the war room,
[3:34:40.500 --> 3:34:42.500]  Owen Schreuer is coming up.
[3:34:42.500 --> 3:34:44.500]  And Francis A. Boyle is our guest.
[3:34:44.500 --> 3:34:51.500]  We're going to be talking about Mr. Gazzick when we return and the smoking done.
[3:34:51.500 --> 3:34:54.500]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like

[3:36:17.500 --> 3:36:20.500]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off.
[3:36:20.500 --> 3:36:23.500]  Grill Oil is set to sell out. It's amazing as well.

[3:36:51.500 --> 3:36:56.500]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[3:36:56.500 --> 3:36:59.500]  from beta testing to operational.
[3:36:59.500 --> 3:37:03.500]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover,
[3:37:03.500 --> 3:37:04.500]  their robot takeover.
[3:37:04.500 --> 3:37:07.500]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working,
[3:37:07.500 --> 3:37:11.500]  and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this,
[3:37:11.500 --> 3:37:12.500]  to be able to find it off.
[3:37:12.500 --> 3:37:14.500]  Humanity is strong. We're incredible.
[3:37:14.500 --> 3:37:18.500]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[3:37:18.500 --> 3:37:21.500]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[3:37:21.500 --> 3:37:23.500]  So prayer is essential. Research is essential.
[3:37:23.500 --> 3:37:27.500]  Getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[3:37:27.500 --> 3:37:32.500]  And at the same time, supporting Infowars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air
[3:37:32.500 --> 3:37:35.500]  is essential because they're great products for you and your family,
[3:37:35.500 --> 3:37:37.500]  and they're also funding our operation.
[3:37:37.500 --> 3:37:42.500]  InfowarsStore.com. InfowarsStore.com is incredible.
[3:37:42.500 --> 3:37:45.500]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns
[3:37:45.500 --> 3:37:47.500]  are back in like bodies, vasobites, and others.

[3:37:49.500 --> 3:37:52.500]  and I thank you for being part of The Resistance.
[3:37:52.500 --> 3:37:56.500]  It is a big idea. A New World Order.
[3:37:58.500 --> 3:38:03.500]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:38:03.500 --> 3:38:06.500]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[3:38:06.500 --> 3:38:09.500]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:38:09.500 --> 3:38:12.500]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[3:38:12.500 --> 3:38:15.500]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[3:38:15.500 --> 3:38:20.500]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:38:20.500 --> 3:38:23.500]  The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago.
[3:38:23.500 --> 3:38:25.500]  It is the blueprint for their plan to take over the world.
[3:38:25.500 --> 3:38:27.500]  It is the blueprint for the great reset.
[3:38:27.500 --> 3:38:29.500]  It is in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:38:29.500 --> 3:38:33.500]  Available right now at InfowarsStore.com with a zero country code meaning
[3:38:33.500 --> 3:38:35.500]  you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[3:38:35.500 --> 3:38:39.500]  I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:38:39.500 --> 3:38:41.500]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it,
[3:38:41.500 --> 3:38:45.500]  and if you take that action, I demand you tell others you've given a copy too
[3:38:45.500 --> 3:38:47.500]  that they make copies and share it as well.
[3:38:47.500 --> 3:38:52.500]  That will trigger distribution by proxy meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[3:38:55.500 --> 3:38:59.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:38:59.500 --> 3:39:01.500]  You
[3:39:15.500 --> 3:39:20.500]  We don't know whether the pandemic started in a lab in Wuhan or evolved naturally,
[3:39:20.500 --> 3:39:25.500]  but we should want to know instead government authorities self-interested
[3:39:25.500 --> 3:39:30.500]  in continuing gain of function research say there's nothing to see here.
[3:39:30.500 --> 3:39:32.500]  Gain of function research, as you know,
[3:39:32.500 --> 3:39:37.500]  is juicing up naturally occurring animal viruses to infect humans.
[3:39:37.500 --> 3:39:41.500]  For years, Dr. Ralph Barrick, a virologist in the U.S.,
[3:39:41.500 --> 3:39:47.500]  has been collaborating with Dr. Xi Zengli of the Wuhan Virology Institute
[3:39:47.500 --> 3:39:50.500]  sharing his discoveries about how to create superviruses.
[3:39:50.500 --> 3:39:57.500]  Dr. Fauci, do you still support funding of the NIH funding of the lab in Wuhan?
[3:39:57.500 --> 3:40:04.500]  Senator Paul, with all due respect, you are entirely and completely incorrect
[3:40:04.500 --> 3:40:12.500]  that the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain of function research
[3:40:12.500 --> 3:40:14.500]  in the Wuhan Institute.
[3:40:14.500 --> 3:40:16.500]  Do they fund Dr. Barrick?
[3:40:16.500 --> 3:40:18.500]  We do not fund.
[3:40:18.500 --> 3:40:20.500]  Dr. Barrick's gain of function research?
[3:40:20.500 --> 3:40:23.500]  Dr. Barrick does not do gain of function research.
[3:40:23.500 --> 3:40:25.500]  All right.
[3:40:25.500 --> 3:40:27.500]  I'm going to play it and get Dr. Boyle's take.
[3:40:27.500 --> 3:40:30.500]  For radiologists, you're missing the TV side of this.
[3:40:30.500 --> 3:40:38.500]  We have the NIH website and Fauci's name is on the programs.
[3:40:38.500 --> 3:40:43.500]  And it says that they lifted the pause that started in 2015 and started back in 2017.
[3:40:43.500 --> 3:40:47.500]  This is a major controversy starting in 2014,
[3:40:47.500 --> 3:40:51.500]  running until whatever happened at the lab last year, intentional or leak.
[3:40:51.500 --> 3:40:53.500]  So I'm no scientist.
[3:40:53.500 --> 3:40:54.500]  I don't know how to read the damn newspaper.
[3:40:54.500 --> 3:40:56.500]  This has been a big controversy.
[3:40:56.500 --> 3:41:05.500]  He's like lying about, I don't know, something really obvious like Barack Obama was the 44th president.
[3:41:05.500 --> 3:41:07.500]  Barack Obama was the 44th president.
[3:41:07.500 --> 3:41:08.500]  No, he wasn't.
[3:41:08.500 --> 3:41:10.500]  Senator, he was not the 44th president.
[3:41:10.500 --> 3:41:13.500]  I mean, he sounds like a Bugs Bunny character or something.
[3:41:13.500 --> 3:41:15.500]  And he's up there gaslighting us.
[3:41:15.500 --> 3:41:18.500]  Let's play the club and get Dr. Boyle's take on it.
[3:41:18.500 --> 3:41:19.500]  Here it is.
[3:41:19.500 --> 3:41:21.500]  Do they fund Dr. Barrick?
[3:41:21.500 --> 3:41:23.500]  We do not fund.
[3:41:23.500 --> 3:41:26.500]  Do you fund Dr. Barrick's gain of function research?
[3:41:26.500 --> 3:41:29.500]  Dr. Barrick does not doing gain of function research.
[3:41:29.500 --> 3:41:36.500]  And if it is, it's according to the guidelines and it is being conducted in North Carolina.
[3:41:36.500 --> 3:41:42.500]  At least 200 scientists have signed a statement from the Cambridge Working Group saying that it is gain of function.
[3:41:42.500 --> 3:41:46.500]  Well, it is not, despite the fact that people tweet that.
[3:41:46.500 --> 3:41:50.500]  So they do not support sending money to the Wuhan Virology Institute.
[3:41:50.500 --> 3:41:54.500]  We do not send money now to do Wuhan Virology Institute.
[3:41:54.500 --> 3:41:55.500]  We support sending money.
[3:41:55.500 --> 3:41:56.500]  We did under your tutelage.
[3:41:56.500 --> 3:41:58.500]  We were sending it through EcoHealth.
[3:41:58.500 --> 3:42:00.500]  It was a sub-agency and a sub-grant.
[3:42:00.500 --> 3:42:01.500]  Let's stop there.
[3:42:01.500 --> 3:42:05.500]  I'm going to play the clips through my smoking gun video at Bandai Video.
[3:42:05.500 --> 3:42:11.500]  And once we post this as an archive today, I want to add that clip in there of the individual that ran the program from the EcoHealth.
[3:42:11.500 --> 3:42:15.500]  Peter Dazek saying they were getting funding, mentioning the funding.
[3:42:15.500 --> 3:42:21.500]  We have the documents and then we have him admitting they were combining five viruses together into one.
[3:42:21.500 --> 3:42:24.500]  Everything you said 16 months ago or 15 months ago.
[3:42:24.500 --> 3:42:27.500]  What do you make of this level of lying?
[3:42:27.500 --> 3:42:30.500]  What the hell is going on there, doctor?
[3:42:30.500 --> 3:42:38.500]  Well, I think Senator Paul should refer Fauci officially to the Department of Justice for perjury.
[3:42:38.500 --> 3:42:43.500]  That's lying under oath to a material matter that's five years.
[3:42:43.500 --> 3:42:47.500]  And I think Senator Paul should make that public.
[3:42:47.500 --> 3:42:56.500]  Indeed, I would hope that the members of his committee, at least maybe some of them, maybe Republicans and Democrats alike,
[3:42:56.500 --> 3:43:02.500]  could sign on to that letter and refer Fauci to the Department of Justice for prosecution for perjury.
[3:43:02.500 --> 3:43:04.500]  Clearly, he perjured himself.
[3:43:04.500 --> 3:43:06.500]  There's no question all about it.
[3:43:06.500 --> 3:43:15.500]  But, you know, we've had officials of the United States government get up in front of congressional committees.
[3:43:15.500 --> 3:43:20.500]  And no one ever said the NSA has never spied on one American.
[3:43:20.500 --> 3:43:24.500]  Right, there's a long history of this, Alex, and they get away with it.
[3:43:24.500 --> 3:43:26.500]  That's the problem.
[3:43:26.500 --> 3:43:32.500]  But here, we now have three million people who died all over the world as a result of this.
[3:43:32.500 --> 3:43:44.500]  So I would encourage Senator Paul to line up some of his colleagues on that committee and refer Fauci to the Department of Justice for perjury prosecution
[3:43:44.500 --> 3:43:49.500]  and release the letter to the Department of Justice to the Attorney General.
[3:43:49.500 --> 3:43:51.500]  Yes, definitely.
[3:43:51.500 --> 3:43:57.500]  I'll say this, I've been watching Fauci's body language for years, even before all this, and he does not look happy now.
[3:43:57.500 --> 3:43:59.500]  He finally looks scared.
[3:43:59.500 --> 3:44:01.500]  He's not looking too arrogant now, is he, doctor?
[3:44:01.500 --> 3:44:05.500]  No, I think Senator Paul did a pretty good job of nailing him.
[3:44:05.500 --> 3:44:20.500]  But he obviously has to tough it out here as he sees it because he knows he's violated my biological weapons anti-terrorism act and faces life imprisonment if all this collapses around him.
[3:44:20.500 --> 3:44:31.500]  Yes, that's sure, he knows what's happening indeed in the first meeting of the COVID-19 involves synthetic biology.
[3:44:31.500 --> 3:44:47.500]  That's what the Bat Queen brought from China's Fort Dietrich to University of North Carolina, synthetic biology, SARS, to then soup it up, as Senator Paul correctly pointed out.
[3:44:47.500 --> 3:45:04.500]  Well, in my biological weapons anti-terrorism act, I anticipated synthetic biology and I made it clear that synthetic cells or using synthetic cells, likewise, it means a felony, you face life imprisonment.
[3:45:04.500 --> 3:45:21.500]  That is why at the first meeting of the so-called synthetic biologists, one of their first recommendations was to repeal my biological weapons anti-terrorism act because they knew they were going to get involved in biological warfare.
[3:45:21.500 --> 3:45:41.500]  Indeed, I will say here openly, Alex, it's well known that the entire field of synthetic biology was envisioned and financed and started by the Pentagon's DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Projects.
[3:45:41.500 --> 3:45:57.500]  Well, that's right, so they're all of their eyeballs and that's why they're protecting each other and now we've got a disaster of historic proportion. That is correct, Alex, that all these officials that the American people have been relying upon, they're lying.
[3:45:57.500 --> 3:46:12.500]  And they're up to their eyeballs in this and three million people have died already. We have at least 900,000 American deaths. That has now come out because they've been deliberately underestimating it.
[3:46:12.500 --> 3:46:35.500]  I don't think Biden's going to bring this under control. His chief of staff, Ron Klain, is really running things. He was behind me at Harvard Law School. Klain was the architect of the cover-up of the fact that the black West African Ebola pandemic came out of that
[3:46:35.500 --> 3:46:47.500]  BSL-4 at Kenema, Sierra Leone, that was set up by the USAID that works closely with the CIA, Fort Dietrich, the Harvard Blood.
[3:46:47.500 --> 3:46:58.500]  It's literally Tuskegee experiment on steroids. Doctor, thanks for coming on a short notice. I've indicated again this is the big global story. It's got the system very, very scared. Thank you for coming on.
[3:46:58.500 --> 3:47:03.500]  Alex, thanks for having me on and let's stay in touch as developments occur.
[3:47:03.500 --> 3:47:10.500]  Absolutely. Thank you so much. All right, that's it for this broadcast. Starting to get to all the callers. If you want to give your name and number, we'll call you back tomorrow. I'll go right to you first.
[3:47:10.500 --> 3:47:17.500]  Nick, Forrest, I apologize to all you guys. C.D. and Laura, please give us your name and number. We'll call you back as we go on tomorrow.
[3:47:17.500 --> 3:47:25.500]  Laura, I'm just a few minutes away separately. I'm really excited about this. This is something that we've been developing for years and years. I didn't develop it. I tried to give it a little development.
[3:47:25.500 --> 3:47:39.500]  I have friends and folks that work as engineers for big oil companies and they developed and have the patents for the stuff that eats oil spills, the natural non-GMO, but especially bread bacteria.
[3:47:39.500 --> 3:47:47.500]  And I said, man, why is that available for septic tanks and everything else? And they just said all the big oil companies and people that have the patent that they're not interested.
[3:47:47.500 --> 3:47:57.500]  Well, I got the guy that has part of the patent and the delivery system patent to come out with it. I convinced them to put a factory in Texas on the side of their other factory.
[3:47:57.500 --> 3:48:06.500]  I convinced them. It took me years. And so now it is available for the first time ever. TheBioProse.com.
[3:48:06.500 --> 3:48:11.500]  This is a year supply here in one bag. Put a little bit in each toilet in your house and put it right in the septic tank.
[3:48:11.500 --> 3:48:18.500]  And it's not like enzymes that take a lot of time and take a lot to take care of stuff. This is bacteria that breed in there.
[3:48:18.500 --> 3:48:23.500]  So we say it lasts a year, probably lasts a lot longer. But the point is it's bacteria. It might last for 50 years.
[3:48:23.500 --> 3:48:43.500]  Septic tank costs $10,000 to repair. This is beyond anything you're seeing out there. And I think it's huge. I've been using it for years trying to get it approved and made and produced.
[3:48:43.500 --> 3:48:53.500]  TheBioProse.com. And there's informational videos. I've a Band-Aught video about it. I'm going to see if they'll post my video about it.
[3:48:53.500 --> 3:48:56.500]  They're probably going to have their engineer shoot some video about it. Again, it's not my company. It's just that I got them to do this.
[3:48:56.500 --> 3:49:01.500]  I started talking about it five years ago. I've been really cracking the whip for two years. I threw a fit six months ago.
[3:49:01.500 --> 3:49:06.500]  And I said, I think this is going to be gigantic. Pig farmers use it. Everybody uses it.
[3:49:06.500 --> 3:49:14.500]  There's a couple of different packages, different sizes, different directions for toilets on boats, toilets on RVs and for your drains and everything else.
[3:49:14.500 --> 3:49:21.500]  It works for everything. It's just amazing. But right now it's for septic and anaerobic septic, not the new weird type that didn't work very well.
[3:49:21.500 --> 3:49:28.500]  But this is for 90 plus percent of septic tanks out there. Find out all the tales at TheBioProse.com.
[3:49:28.500 --> 3:49:34.500]  And it funds the M4 war, the only independent media tellment like it is, and calling it for Fauci to be trying for war crimes, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:49:34.500 --> 3:49:38.500]  Thank you for your support. The war is coming up. Last day to get 10 percent of all the horrible food, prepare with Alex.com.
[3:49:38.500 --> 3:50:07.500]  Take advantage of that as well. Thank you all.
