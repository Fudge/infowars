[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:33.080]  Texas Alex Jones here we are ladies and gentlemen December 1st 2008 already in
[00:33.080 --> 00:39.480]  the last month of big 08 going into 09 with our new leader our new savior
[00:39.480 --> 00:46.600]  Barack H Obama Paul Watson will join us for an update on what was really behind
[00:46.600 --> 00:53.320]  the three-day attacks that took more than 300 lives in Mumbai India Paul Watson
[00:53.320 --> 00:57.960]  joining us in 30 minutes he'll also be discussing the Washington Post today
[00:57.960 --> 01:02.840]  needed a big detailed report on it at prisonplanet.com announcing hey
[01:02.840 --> 01:08.000]  guess what it won't just be one brigade it'll be 20,000 army troops alone
[01:08.000 --> 01:16.320]  stationed in America working with your local police so we will break that down
[01:16.320 --> 01:20.120]  people are going my gosh Alex how did you know this we thought you were crazy
[01:20.120 --> 01:24.880]  I was only going off all the official Pentagon documents I was only going to
[01:24.880 --> 01:29.200]  the urban warfare drills and they are training to take your guns let's be
[01:29.200 --> 01:32.520]  clear about that once they've conditioned the public to accept troops on the
[01:32.520 --> 01:36.260]  streets like they've been having them now for a decade at sporting events high
[01:36.260 --> 01:43.880]  school college NFL the Kentucky Derby the Academy Awards once your condition to
[01:43.880 --> 01:49.160]  see troops in the streets then they can start the gun confiscation that's what
[01:49.160 --> 01:52.760]  our troops are being trained to do and if you're patriotic according to the
[01:52.760 --> 01:56.640]  government you just turn your guns into them what you're not against the troops
[01:56.640 --> 02:02.520]  in America are you what are you some kind of communists turn your guns in
[02:02.520 --> 02:07.720]  it's disgusting so we'll go over that today and do some background history on
[02:07.720 --> 02:12.320]  it with Paul Watson then we have Lindsay Williams joining us had him on two
[02:12.320 --> 02:18.200]  weeks ago oil has dipped below $50 a barrel as he predicted from from his
[02:18.200 --> 02:23.200]  Atlantic Richfield executive source and then we've got to a major general
[02:23.200 --> 02:27.400]  stubblebine and Rima LeBeau at a Rima LeBeau popping in talk about Codex
[02:27.400 --> 02:30.640]  Alimentarius they covered in Europe and some of the other things that are
[02:30.640 --> 02:36.040]  developing he's the former head of Army intelligence the former head of
[02:36.040 --> 02:42.080]  special forces always very interesting to talk to major general stubblebine
[02:42.080 --> 02:48.040]  so that is set to be coming up in the last hour today and we will also have
[02:48.040 --> 02:51.040]  open phones later in the broadcast in fact I'm gonna have open phones for
[02:51.040 --> 02:55.600]  Lindsay Williams so you can address questions to him when he is on the
[02:55.600 --> 03:02.160]  show today that said I want to talk more about a culture of jellyfish a
[03:02.160 --> 03:08.440]  culture of spineless self-centered lazy people now the majority of the United
[03:08.440 --> 03:14.880]  States is not like this but I'd say 35 40% is they are completely dumb down
[03:14.880 --> 03:19.960]  they are completely one-dimensional and mindless and they will do whatever the
[03:19.960 --> 03:24.080]  government says and they can care less about themselves their neighbors anyone
[03:24.080 --> 03:30.240]  and this dovetails into people being stabbed killed shot run over all over
[03:30.240 --> 03:35.680]  the nation and people not stopping to render aid not even calling 911 and not
[03:35.680 --> 03:38.680]  even caring when their neighbors being mugged not even caring when their
[03:38.680 --> 03:43.480]  neighbors being robbed just just saying hey doesn't affect me it's this
[03:43.480 --> 03:47.560]  attitude and and that's what brings you to the point of a bunch of people
[03:47.560 --> 03:51.880]  stampeding a guy in New York to death last Friday and fights at Walmart's and
[03:51.880 --> 03:57.160]  targets all over the country and people shooting each other over goods just
[03:57.160 --> 04:04.540]  just it goes to a nation that's lost its soul it goes to a nation that has no
[04:04.540 --> 04:09.680]  bearing that is set and ripe to be toppled and overtaken and totally
[04:09.680 --> 04:15.160]  enslaved and the government will use the zombies will use the a little
[04:15.160 --> 04:20.800]  materialistic zombies against the middle class you see they use false class
[04:20.800 --> 04:27.040]  warfare the the the zombie creatures then they really are androids I mean
[04:27.040 --> 04:31.120]  they're biomechanical androids they are human but they've lost their mind they've
[04:31.120 --> 04:35.760]  lost their soul they've lost their psyche they are just basically programmed
[04:35.760 --> 04:40.960]  bumbling creatures and they're being programmed and pointed directly at us the
[04:40.960 --> 04:45.200]  people running over the guy at Walmart and then refusing to stop shopping after
[04:45.200 --> 04:48.960]  they told they killed him they are the ones that are going to have the submachine
[04:48.960 --> 04:54.000]  guns on the street corners waddling mindless scum with submachine guns
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.200]  ramming the New World Order down your throat stay with us
[04:59.200 --> 05:03.920]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[05:03.920 --> 05:07.200]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[05:07.200 --> 05:10.760]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[05:10.760 --> 05:14.040]  bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[05:14.040 --> 05:17.880]  dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[05:17.880 --> 05:21.400]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[05:21.400 --> 05:25.200]  for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off
[05:25.200 --> 05:29.720]  the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out
[05:29.720 --> 05:33.360]  of thin air this money now owns the american and european banks the
[05:33.360 --> 05:37.120]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[05:37.120 --> 05:41.200]  nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many
[05:41.200 --> 05:45.400]  americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of
[05:45.400 --> 05:49.680]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food
[05:49.680 --> 05:53.400]  prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[05:53.400 --> 05:57.120]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[05:57.120 --> 06:00.720]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[06:00.720 --> 06:04.880]  but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to
[06:04.880 --> 06:08.920]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans
[06:08.920 --> 06:12.600]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[06:12.600 --> 06:16.760]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody
[06:16.760 --> 06:19.680]  out there listening it's very important for you understand that by having a
[06:19.680 --> 06:23.280]  supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control
[06:23.280 --> 06:27.480]  over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[06:27.480 --> 06:30.640]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[06:30.640 --> 06:34.640]  you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from
[06:34.640 --> 06:38.760]  E. coli salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost

[07:04.640 --> 07:10.160]  today the first step is getting storable food ease the T-rex of political talk
[07:10.160 --> 07:18.520]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[07:18.520 --> 07:24.720]  off and on for the next few years as the crime rate explodes I'm gonna be putting out
[07:24.720 --> 07:27.800]  public service announcements here on air just warning everybody to watch your
[07:27.800 --> 07:36.000]  back lock your houses your cars we had a little cheat barbecue pit behind the
[07:36.000 --> 07:42.080]  office somebody stole that crime is exploding everywhere and the media will
[07:42.080 --> 07:46.560]  not tell you this in the past they would publicize crime statistics the crime
[07:46.560 --> 07:50.600]  statistics are available from the Justice Department states and cities but
[07:50.600 --> 07:55.080]  they're not advertising the fact that crime is just exploding exponentially
[07:55.080 --> 08:00.000]  everywhere what they will publicize is a point a caller made last night to my
[08:00.000 --> 08:05.160]  Sunday radio show we do every Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m. central time and that was
[08:05.160 --> 08:08.520]  the Houston Chronicles saying oh we've got to go after the gun shows we've got
[08:08.520 --> 08:12.720]  to go after the gun shops they're selling guns that are then fenced to drug
[08:12.720 --> 08:18.320]  gangs in Mexico and that's why there's 2,000 dead on the Texas-Mexico border
[08:18.320 --> 08:22.720]  it's the evil second amendment you go to a country like Mexico where the
[08:22.720 --> 08:27.680]  citizens are disarmed and you have hundreds of murders every single day
[08:27.680 --> 08:35.720]  yes hundreds of murders over 100 murders every day in Mexico because once a
[08:35.720 --> 08:40.200]  society becomes that corrupt everything breaks down no one follows the law
[08:40.200 --> 08:44.960]  anymore so you've got all the peasants disarmed with huge roving gangs different
[08:44.960 --> 08:49.280]  gangs inside the government every major government official dealing heroin
[08:49.280 --> 08:54.600]  cocaine constantly being caught just in a huge war with each other the lesser
[08:54.600 --> 08:59.240]  cartels hundreds of little crime syndicates battling the big chase
[08:59.240 --> 09:04.840]  Manhattan City Bank crime syndicate based in Mexico City in New York and so
[09:04.840 --> 09:09.800]  rather than the Houston Chronicles say wait a minute hundreds of thousands a
[09:09.800 --> 09:13.320]  year in Houston alone and this is actually been in their paper before
[09:13.320 --> 09:18.960]  hundreds of thousands yes you can pull those numbers up hundreds of thousands
[09:18.960 --> 09:25.080]  of violent criminals of felons being released just from their metro jails
[09:25.080 --> 09:29.080]  they arrest them the police arrest them with guns arrest them driving drunk
[09:29.080 --> 09:33.320]  recklessly they're just released because the judges on record say there's
[09:33.320 --> 09:35.920]  nothing we can do about it the feds won't come pick them up they won't take
[09:35.920 --> 09:40.640]  them they release them so understand that the even the police want to do their
[09:40.640 --> 09:45.440]  jobs they are just released but then the American people have to be harassed and
[09:45.440 --> 09:52.280]  treated like complete and total surf slaves but crime of every type is is
[09:52.280 --> 09:56.640]  exponentially expanding I mean it's on Austin news every day about a car
[09:56.640 --> 10:01.560]  jacking or another dead body they fish out of the river of a dead woman who was
[10:01.560 --> 10:05.480]  you know kidnapped and raped I mean every every day we hear about home
[10:05.480 --> 10:11.600]  invasions and old ladies being beaten half to death by criminals and ladies and
[10:11.600 --> 10:15.840]  gentlemen about half the time here in Austin it is an illegal alien doing it
[10:15.840 --> 10:19.600]  and I'm not saying that Mexico is nothing but criminals though they're
[10:19.600 --> 10:23.480]  having national marches of millions of people talking about how it's becoming
[10:23.480 --> 10:27.800]  completely criminal state and and the citizens are just begging for it to end
[10:27.800 --> 10:33.480]  to the very government that's engineering but the criminals of Mexico know
[10:33.480 --> 10:39.520]  that California Nevada Arizona New Mexico Texas and now into Mississippi
[10:39.520 --> 10:45.000]  Louisiana up into Indiana everywhere is the happy hunting ground this is a place
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.840]  where you can rape steal kill use any identity you want the Mexican consulate
[10:49.840 --> 10:55.400]  will give somebody 50 60 70 hundred different consulate matriculas for $22
[10:55.400 --> 10:59.640]  apiece and with those fake IDs they can then get social security they can get
[10:59.640 --> 11:04.240]  jobs they can get fake IDs they can suck off the welfare system bankrupt the
[11:04.240 --> 11:10.240]  states this is happening total breakdown of society is taking place on the
[11:10.240 --> 11:14.160]  border and hundreds of miles over the border and what's the border patrol doing
[11:14.160 --> 11:17.560]  either a hundred miles deep in the country pulling citizens over at
[11:17.560 --> 11:23.680]  checkpoints because we are the milk cows we are the fat slobs we are the dumb
[11:23.680 --> 11:27.680]  down people with this image of a free country in our minds and it can't happen
[11:27.680 --> 11:31.720]  here and the public was taught that tyranny is a good thing that tyranny is
[11:31.720 --> 11:36.720]  freedom they believe that tyranny is freedom that war is peace but slavery is
[11:36.720 --> 11:43.160]  empowerment they believe that lies are truth and so they are being enslaved we
[11:43.160 --> 11:51.280]  are all being enslaved right now it is truly a sad day truly a sad day as every
[11:51.280 --> 11:57.240]  single day I see articles about Texas Sheriff's caught dealing cocaine every
[11:57.240 --> 12:02.080]  day I see reports of police chiefs caught dealing cocaine or their daughters
[12:02.080 --> 12:07.000]  dealing cocaine or their wives dealing cocaine or their police captains dealing
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.120]  cocaine heroin ecstasy it is a completely bankrupted corrupt society and it
[12:14.120 --> 12:18.960]  was done by design exactly the way the British introduced opium to China and
[12:18.960 --> 12:23.320]  over several decades used the fact that it was illegal to make massive black
[12:23.320 --> 12:28.240]  market products profits to corrupt the police and local constabulary and then
[12:28.240 --> 12:33.880]  bring down the nation and divided into 10 separate parts this is the type of real
[12:33.880 --> 12:37.840]  issues that we're dealing with here the globalist are strip mining us are
[12:37.840 --> 12:45.600]  subdividing us are completely blowing us out and ruining us by design so they
[12:45.600 --> 12:52.440]  can then suck up all of the spoils in the second hour today I'm going to spend
[12:52.440 --> 12:55.560]  30 minutes on this and I'm going to detail it and I'm going to play some
[12:55.560 --> 13:01.680]  audio clips from the past where my shelf and others were warning the public
[13:01.680 --> 13:05.560]  about exactly what was going to happen with the military to be used for
[13:05.560 --> 13:12.040]  martial law on the streets of the United States here is the Washington post
[13:12.040 --> 13:20.760]  today Pentagon to detail troops Pentagon to detail troops to bolster domestic
[13:20.760 --> 13:27.600]  security and it dovetails with the CBS news and AP articles of last week also
[13:27.600 --> 13:32.760]  the Air Force Times headline Gates Air Force active reserves must integrate
[13:32.760 --> 13:38.520]  they're getting rid of the National Guard just huge things that are happening
[13:38.520 --> 13:45.880]  right in front of us and that is coming up in the next hour and it's being
[13:45.880 --> 13:51.240]  proposed to the public like oh we just now had this idea because the terrorists
[13:51.240 --> 13:57.280]  are about to strike any minute we just now had this idea and North com just now
[13:57.280 --> 14:02.320]  in 2008 is deciding to deploy regular army troops to the streets of America
[14:02.320 --> 14:06.800]  for natural disasters and to fight al-qaeda but when you actually read
[14:06.800 --> 14:11.760]  the directives put out by Gates that we covered last Friday here on the year
[14:11.760 --> 14:15.840]  when you actually read what North com has been saying they're going to do since
[14:15.840 --> 14:21.320]  1993 but North com was really set up no it wasn't set up in 2002 boys and girls
[14:21.320 --> 14:26.120]  neither was homeland security set up a 93 by Bill Clinton can pull that up watch
[14:26.120 --> 14:30.360]  the speeches of him talking about it they just are now unveiling it to the
[14:30.360 --> 14:39.280]  slaves in a big way the entire setup is stated to remove Congress and remove
[14:39.280 --> 14:45.440]  governors remove the the the elected representatives in the legislative at the
[14:45.440 --> 14:50.840]  state and federal level under the John Warner defense authorization act and
[14:50.840 --> 14:57.640]  under PDD 51 and then any US citizen can be secretly stripped of citizenship by
[14:57.640 --> 15:02.160]  any military officer or homeland security officer secretly arrested
[15:02.160 --> 15:06.800]  secretly taken to offshore facilities secretly tortured and secretly
[15:06.800 --> 15:14.720]  executed and it's all right there in the military commissions act go read it
[15:14.720 --> 15:18.560]  go read the article we wrote about it in detail showing you the subsections
[15:18.560 --> 15:25.080]  linking to it and people are marveling right now that everything I talked about
[15:25.080 --> 15:30.480]  is coming true well don't marvel here's the parallel of the parable or the
[15:30.480 --> 15:39.920]  analogy the parallel it'd be like if I told my wife on a Sunday morning hey the
[15:39.920 --> 15:44.960]  NFL's gonna have games all day starting at three o'clock and then she went in and
[15:44.960 --> 15:52.000]  turned on the TV at three o'clock and there was you know the Jets playing the
[15:52.000 --> 15:59.080]  Giants and she oh my gosh how did you know how did you understand it how did
[15:59.080 --> 16:09.280]  you well I read the TV guide honey or if my wife said to me hey um survivors
[16:09.280 --> 16:13.880]  coming on tonight at eight o'clock and then survivor came on and and I said
[16:13.880 --> 16:17.960]  how does you know you're your psychic here you had it she'd say no I I read the
[16:17.960 --> 16:23.200]  TV guide still though even as it's all being announced there are people all
[16:23.200 --> 16:27.200]  over the news all over the message boards everywhere running around saying
[16:27.200 --> 16:32.640]  I'm lying this isn't happening those are definitely paid for shells folks and when
[16:32.640 --> 16:37.040]  they attack me the messenger it's always about Alex Jones never about what I'm
[16:37.040 --> 16:41.360]  saying or what I'm doing it's he's a fed or he's getting rich off this or he's
[16:41.360 --> 16:47.200]  everything that's in the Coventel probe manuals to attack somebody who's trying
[16:47.200 --> 16:52.400]  to fight the New World Order so just recognize when you see that it's about
[16:52.400 --> 16:58.560]  debating about Alex Jones because I'm the most effective at getting this out
[16:58.560 --> 17:02.280]  thanks to you the list for spreading the word it's a symbiotic team effort here
[17:02.280 --> 17:10.960]  they are desperate desperate to try to divert you now I'm gonna tell you again
[17:10.960 --> 17:15.240]  it's not just in all the documents that this is a criminal organization that
[17:15.240 --> 17:20.960]  this is a foreign corporate move using the military not our military not the
[17:20.960 --> 17:25.160]  US military now the globalist military under United Nations and International
[17:25.160 --> 17:32.400]  Corporate Control to carry out a rearguard action in the United States to
[17:32.400 --> 17:37.400]  militarize the police to federalize the police to have the police work with the

[17:43.560 --> 17:48.000]  American people and in surveillance of the government the legitimate government
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.840]  and that's in all the announcements they're making that they're spying on
[17:51.840 --> 17:56.600]  peace scripts they're spying on state legislators they're spying on prominent
[17:56.600 --> 18:04.480]  business leaders military intelligence army Navy Marines Air Force are on the
[18:04.480 --> 18:11.360]  ground you see you see the public face of this out of the city fair or function
[18:11.360 --> 18:15.320]  you'll have the National Guard or regular Army MPs or regular Air Force MPs
[18:15.320 --> 18:18.800]  they're just there to acclimate you and acclimate the natives to their
[18:18.800 --> 18:23.480]  presence and acclimate the troops and the police but when you read what they're
[18:23.480 --> 18:27.840]  now announcing publicly it's what was in all the previous classified and
[18:27.840 --> 18:36.640]  semi-classified and redacted documents it was all there and it is regular
[18:36.640 --> 18:41.400]  military involved in your everyday life in the schools brainwashing and

[18:56.800 --> 19:01.160]  involved in your everyday life they're there as the rearguard as the US is
[19:01.160 --> 19:06.520]  imploded and broken up into pieces this is being done by design we'll be right

[19:22.000 --> 19:26.280]  have to look to Osama bin Laden tabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a
[19:26.280 --> 19:30.280]  close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United
[19:30.280 --> 19:34.440]  States some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much
[19:34.440 --> 19:40.360]  engaged in spying in and on the US I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have
[19:40.360 --> 19:45.040]  been detained and laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI

[20:10.320 --> 20:14.320]  Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[20:14.320 --> 20:18.040]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[20:18.040 --> 20:21.000]  place limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[20:21.000 --> 20:24.720]  accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[20:24.720 --> 20:28.760]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket
[20:28.760 --> 20:32.640]  through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run
[20:32.640 --> 20:36.360]  followed by a depressed economy a current effort is underway by the Fed
[20:36.360 --> 20:39.800]  along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors
[20:39.800 --> 20:43.640]  however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity
[20:43.640 --> 20:48.000]  can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability I recommend a
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.440]  conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and
[20:52.440 --> 20:57.120]  silver while paper investments currently have been driven by debt gold on its own

[24:08.960 --> 24:12.240]  branch went and arrested him and the leader of the conservative party the
[24:12.240 --> 24:19.160]  second strongest party came out and said this is a police state Stalin ask the
[24:19.160 --> 24:25.160]  rogue government the private military government controlled by the private

[24:31.360 --> 24:36.520]  Congress here in the United States this is what they do it's criminal and to
[24:36.520 --> 24:40.240]  have the military in Europe and here in the United States just announced oh by
[24:40.240 --> 24:43.440]  the way the legislatures of the elected governments you don't run anything
[24:43.440 --> 24:49.880]  we're the military we're spying on you we work up for these private banks you
[24:49.880 --> 24:52.600]  know we work for the president we work for the prime minister we work for the
[24:52.600 --> 24:56.760]  chancellor and then they're always controlled by private boards basically
[24:56.760 --> 25:00.680]  they got them elected and that's how it works and so they mass all the power in
[25:00.680 --> 25:04.040]  the national security state the name of keeping you safe from terrorism they
[25:04.040 --> 25:08.080]  menace you with terrorism and then when you go look at the official north com
[25:08.080 --> 25:14.040]  system they set up and it's the same in Europe it is designed around riots and
[25:14.040 --> 25:21.600]  suppression and mass arrest and roundups they openly say it is for the people and
[25:21.600 --> 25:26.040]  crowd control and microwave guns and sound cannons and FEMA camps and
[25:26.040 --> 25:31.560]  emergency relocation centers and interrogation centers it's for you it's
[25:31.560 --> 25:36.680]  for me and it's so the powerful elite can steal and take and put toll roads on

[25:40.640 --> 25:45.960]  total control why because they are usurpers they are conquerors they are
[25:45.960 --> 25:52.120]  dark they are powerful it's what they do it's their nature it's history and they've
[25:52.120 --> 25:57.080]  been slowly twisting and bending and brainwashing the military and the police
[25:57.080 --> 26:02.560]  into this culture to accept it as a good thing these men and women on these
[26:02.560 --> 26:06.880]  power trips having no idea what they're part of now more and more is being

[26:43.800 --> 26:47.960]  and others are reporting India is threatening nuclear tension and war
[26:47.960 --> 26:54.480]  Indian president has said that they are quote at a war security level and are
[26:54.480 --> 26:58.880]  preparing for war with Pakistan here is your international crisis but what did
[26:58.880 --> 27:04.080]  I tell you a month ago for what five six weeks ago when Biden and Colin Powell
[27:04.080 --> 27:11.440]  and everybody else and and Merkel and Barroso and Sarkozy and Brown all these
[27:11.440 --> 27:15.760]  world leaders came out and said Obama will be tested on the 21st or 22nd of
[27:15.760 --> 27:19.480]  January there will be an international crisis people said where will it be and
[27:19.480 --> 27:25.120]  I said Pakistan and India none of them were saying that how do we know because
[27:25.120 --> 27:30.960]  Obama look they talk to the public like their children and so they say all this
[27:30.960 --> 27:35.840]  right out in the open like people are fools I put two and two together where
[27:35.840 --> 27:41.120]  is Obama saying he wants to move more forces where is he saying Afghanistan and
[27:41.120 --> 27:48.240]  Pakistan Pakistan's gotten out of the globalist control you've got the ISI
[27:48.240 --> 27:56.960]  terror faction controlled by Mossad MI6 CIA openly openly set up by them and

[28:07.680 --> 28:12.080]  and now the Pakistani president the former head of ISI and others are
[28:12.080 --> 28:17.880]  coming out and saying this is staged to blame this on Pakistan and yes we know
[28:17.880 --> 28:22.320]  that Western intelligence has infiltrated the ISI you understand that
[28:22.320 --> 28:29.400]  the government is divided against itself the very same people who every week on
[28:29.400 --> 28:34.120]  average have been bombing the new government in Pakistan the kicked out

[32:25.160 --> 32:33.200]  region previously part of Pakistan the two nations have been at war 2002 it
[32:33.200 --> 32:40.120]  almost went nuclear now why did the United States England and Israel help
[32:40.120 --> 32:44.680]  give nuclear weapons to both nations because they want to play them off
[32:44.680 --> 32:50.560]  against each other the strategy of tension or divide and conquer the geopolitical
[32:50.560 --> 32:54.440]  system the great game as British intelligence calls it
[32:54.440 --> 33:05.200]  Kresma Shariff back in 2000 installed as the dictator finally removed by legitimate citizens demonstrating then the police machine gun them
[33:05.200 --> 33:09.800]  remember a year and a half ago so they rioted the police turned to their side
[33:09.800 --> 33:15.720]  the public is fully aware that al Qaeda the Taliban is CIA that's all over
[33:15.720 --> 33:20.400]  Pakistani newspapers every day they want them out the public hates the Muslim
[33:20.400 --> 33:26.480]  extremist who will then be given power by the CIA if they're allowed to get into
[33:26.480 --> 33:32.000]  control so that's why they're fighting and now they have attacked India again
[33:32.000 --> 33:35.600]  the Pakistani government is saying look we didn't do this we want to be at
[33:35.600 --> 33:39.320]  peace you know we don't want to have a war we want to be friends this is being
[33:39.320 --> 33:45.000]  done to destabilize us we are government is infiltrated they are bombing us
[33:45.000 --> 33:49.800]  remember a few weeks ago they met at a hotel what about a month ago government
[33:49.800 --> 33:53.640]  officials about how to go after al Qaeda and then the hotel got blown up and it
[33:53.640 --> 33:58.280]  was in mainstream news that US Marines were running around bringing boxes into
[33:58.280 --> 34:07.840]  the building right before it blew up on and on and on and so this is the
[34:07.840 --> 34:13.080]  international crisis that Barack Obama is discussing and they're gonna use this
[34:13.080 --> 34:17.160]  crisis coming up the next three months while they devalue the dollar and have a
[34:17.160 --> 34:20.240]  world currency reduction so you so it won't look like it's being devalued
[34:20.240 --> 34:23.520]  because all currencies are going to be devalued simultaneously that's been
[34:23.520 --> 34:27.320]  openly announced this is global government by the bankers what they set up
[34:27.320 --> 34:32.760]  two weekends ago in Virginia openly saying in hundreds of newspapers a new
[34:32.760 --> 34:39.560]  world order they will use that as a smoke screen the new military action while
[34:39.560 --> 34:44.280]  the economy is further consolidated their masters at diversion I know the
[34:44.280 --> 34:48.360]  public's very simple-minded here's a quick example all the debates on radio
[34:48.360 --> 34:53.640]  TV newspaper I mean 95% of them are about should we bail out 25 billion or
[34:53.640 --> 35:00.080]  40 billion Ford and GM and Chrysler will it cause a depression of this happens so
[35:00.080 --> 35:03.840]  they're making the depression that's coming all about it's the talking point
[35:03.840 --> 35:07.680]  the automakers they're causing a depression now first it was subprime
[35:07.680 --> 35:11.760]  mortgages had nothing to do with that this has been done by design it was the
[35:11.760 --> 35:16.840]  derivatives and the banks cutting off liquidity to Main Street and there's
[35:16.840 --> 35:23.160]  another diversion we're only having a debate about the bailout of 25 or 40
[35:23.160 --> 35:31.280]  billion dollars of Ford and GM and Chrysler instead of the almost eight
[35:31.280 --> 35:34.320]  trillion dollars as of last week I'm sure it's over eight trillion now it's
[35:34.320 --> 35:42.960]  what 300 billion a day seven point eight trillion dollars stolen by the
[35:42.960 --> 35:46.720]  bankers with a bait and switch terrorizing the public any question of
[35:46.720 --> 35:50.120]  the terrorist are the head of the Federal Reserve the private bank the head of
[35:50.120 --> 35:53.520]  the Treasury all of them up there saying we will have depression it will be death
[35:53.520 --> 35:56.800]  and destruction it will be martial law the whole country will collapse if you
[35:56.800 --> 36:01.760]  don't do this we have to have the money right now they get it and say next day
[36:01.760 --> 36:05.320]  we're not using it for that we're keeping it and having bonuses and letting
[36:05.320 --> 36:08.320]  our banks buy up other banks and insurance companies and infrastructure
[36:08.320 --> 36:11.120]  and the bankers all laugh and say we're doing great this is wonderful
[36:11.120 --> 36:15.800]  publicly throwing it in your face and saying hey we're gonna use the army in
[36:15.800 --> 36:24.680]  America a month ago they say it's 2,000 troops 3,000 troops that's 20,000 troops
[36:24.680 --> 36:30.480]  Sunday by the middle of next year you're gonna hear them talking about 200,000
[36:30.480 --> 36:33.880]  US troops deployed here oh yeah they're gonna get pulled out of Iraq and brought
[36:33.880 --> 36:36.640]  back here they're gonna have contractors here and the rest of them are gonna go
[36:36.640 --> 36:41.800]  to Afghanistan and Pakistan unless we get the word out I mean this is so
[36:41.800 --> 36:46.760]  historical so diabolical so huge and it's happening right out in front of
[36:46.760 --> 36:51.960]  everybody and the Cointel prooperatives are all over the internet message boards
[36:51.960 --> 36:55.880]  YouTube everywhere going Alex Jones is lying none of this is happening he's a
[36:55.880 --> 37:00.920]  fed he's of this regardless of what I am and judge a tree by its fruits obviously
[37:00.920 --> 37:05.240]  I'm a salt of the earth and you know it's why you listen you've got discernment
[37:05.240 --> 37:09.680]  but the dumb down public doesn't have discernment and so the Cointel pro isn't
[37:09.680 --> 37:14.600]  targeting you they know they've lost you they're targeting the dumb down people
[37:14.600 --> 37:18.360]  who are kind of looking up from their head in the sand pulling their head out
[37:18.360 --> 37:21.760]  momentarily to say something going on they go no no everything's fine don't
[37:21.760 --> 37:29.200]  listen to him he's the government people say well we need a solution to all of
[37:29.200 --> 37:34.080]  this the solution is warning the public and saying no to troops on the streets
[37:34.080 --> 37:40.440]  no to martial law no to the executive branch with with with private contractors
[37:40.440 --> 37:44.200]  taking over the whole government that's the solution the solution is look in the
[37:44.200 --> 37:48.600]  mirror all I can do is tell you this is happening and try to get people to be
[37:48.600 --> 37:53.840]  concerned about it I want to go to Paul Watson for the balance of the sour Paul
[37:53.840 --> 38:02.480]  Watson you said that last Wednesday when this all started last Tuesday actually
[38:02.480 --> 38:08.200]  Tuesday night when this all kicked off you wrote an article saying that the
[38:08.200 --> 38:13.680]  move by situation would be blamed on Pakistan and then you pointed out that
[38:13.680 --> 38:21.240]  ISI is CIA and Mossad and MI6 controlled that this would be used to
[38:21.240 --> 38:24.600]  destabilize the country that the very groups they were claiming are attacking
[38:24.600 --> 38:31.920]  India are attacking the Pakistani government openly globalist back and
[38:31.920 --> 38:35.920]  sure enough days later what you said unfolded and happened and now it's in
[38:35.920 --> 38:41.720]  the Pakistan times it's on Russian TV all over the place laying out that this
[38:41.720 --> 38:45.960]  is a destabilization move of Pakistan and India and the public is so
[38:45.960 --> 38:50.000]  unsophisticated I'm reading their comments on these stories and reading
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.560]  the comments on the videos online they don't even understand it much less
[38:53.560 --> 39:01.120]  finding Pakistan or Kashmir or India on a map Paul Watson a breakdown the
[39:01.120 --> 39:07.640]  latest information we have hello Alex yeah the latest thing that we have is
[39:07.640 --> 39:13.760]  regarding this warning this foreknowledge that the Indians had and it
[39:13.760 --> 39:18.280]  was a specific warning of both the method in which the attack would be
[39:18.280 --> 39:23.560]  carried out the arrival by which the terrorists would take and the target
[39:23.560 --> 39:31.080]  which was mainly the Taj Mahal hotel and this was the CIA station chief in
[39:31.080 --> 39:36.440]  Delhi who told Indian intelligence in September that the terrorists were
[39:36.440 --> 39:42.040]  planning to arrive by sea and attack the Taj Mahal hotel with small arms and or
[39:42.040 --> 39:47.920]  bombs so they took initially they took that warning seriously and beefed the
[39:47.920 --> 39:54.440]  security measures at the Taj Mahal hotel but then strangely enough as we
[39:54.440 --> 40:00.640]  routinely see happen in these major terrorist attacks the security was then
[40:00.640 --> 40:06.560]  softened just a week before the attack so you've got specific warnings about the
[40:06.560 --> 40:12.040]  method and location of the attacks and the hotel relaxes the security measures
[40:12.040 --> 40:17.560]  right before it now there are also I witness reports from people on the
[40:17.560 --> 40:23.280]  ground of police who as these armed terrorists were running through the
[40:23.280 --> 40:27.760]  subways and the restaurants and the streets shooting at people the police
[40:27.760 --> 40:33.880]  refused to shoot back and that's why now you have these videos emerging of
[40:33.880 --> 40:40.000]  citizens who are forced to gang up and go hand-to-hand in combat with these
[40:40.000 --> 40:46.040]  terrorists because the police are nowhere to be seen so I mean the question is if
[40:46.040 --> 40:49.520]  these security measures were softened and if the police were not firing back at
[40:49.520 --> 40:55.360]  the terrorists and why did the attack drag on for two or three days the
[40:55.360 --> 41:00.840]  question has to be asked was there some kind of stand-down order because the way
[41:00.840 --> 41:07.120]  in which India has exploited the attacks which as you mentioned I predicted it
[41:07.120 --> 41:10.840]  wasn't hard to predict because they always blame Pakistan for everything but
[41:10.840 --> 41:16.360]  the level to which they've pushed it in this situation goes above and beyond
[41:16.360 --> 41:22.680]  anything and they're obviously trying to blame Pakistan to deflect from the fact
[41:22.680 --> 41:27.360]  that they were given this specific warning and they failed not only they
[41:27.360 --> 41:31.080]  failed to prevent it but you know they let the whole thing drag out for days
[41:31.080 --> 41:36.040]  and the sentiment has now started to turn you've had a resignation of top
[41:36.040 --> 41:40.200]  official in the Indian government you've got more on the way and people are
[41:40.200 --> 41:45.000]  starting to ask serious questions about how they failed to prevent the attack
[41:45.000 --> 41:52.640]  and why they let it drag on for so much time so then they've killed nine of
[41:52.640 --> 41:56.880]  the 10 terrorists they were supposedly 10 terrorist other people say they were
[41:56.880 --> 42:04.120]  15 or more they've got one they always catch one there's only always one left
[42:04.120 --> 42:08.840]  this is following all the classic patterns they look they always got one
[42:08.840 --> 42:14.400]  pat see who you know things from the same him sheet and he's the star he's the
[42:14.400 --> 42:19.080]  one that paraded around in front of cameras exactly that's all the star again
[42:19.080 --> 42:25.400]  as I'm Amir Kassab who is a fluent English speaker and as soon as they
[42:25.400 --> 42:31.840]  got him he started implicating Pakistan the media took it as gospel of course
[42:31.840 --> 42:35.760]  they'd never let's say you know he's a real terrorist he's no kind of
[42:35.760 --> 42:41.040]  provocateur the media took it as gospel even after his interrogation they're
[42:41.040 --> 42:45.480]  also rolling out not one but two witnesses who just so happen to be
[42:45.480 --> 42:50.920]  fluent English-speaking movie stars TV stars who play the part
[42:50.920 --> 42:57.960]  terrorist or people fighting terrorist exactly so that it's strangely
[42:57.960 --> 43:02.760]  scripted and so now he's blaming he's saying his handlers with this lash
[43:02.760 --> 43:10.800]  car e-toyba group which is ISI Pakistani affiliated the problem being that
[43:10.800 --> 43:14.600]  lash car e-toyba always claim responsibility for their attacks they
[43:14.600 --> 43:18.200]  always have done in the past but in this case they vehemently denied
[43:18.200 --> 43:22.400]  involvement yet he's saying that they were his handlers and that it's a
[43:22.400 --> 43:28.840]  Pakistani operation so again we we ask the question well how this really works
[43:28.840 --> 43:32.760]  is they send in commandos and we're not sure who sent them in they kill a bunch
[43:32.760 --> 43:37.440]  of people then they take their outfits on put on their police uniforms or other
[43:37.440 --> 43:42.080]  uniforms they slip back into the crowd cover their faces and they bring
[43:42.080 --> 43:47.760]  forward the actor who years later will be quietly released and over and over
[43:47.760 --> 43:50.120]  again they say oh well we released the bomber because he was really
[43:50.120 --> 43:54.120]  intelligence operative for the CIA or Mossad or Indian intelligence or
[43:54.120 --> 43:57.920]  British intelligence and this happened over and over again folks it's just in
[43:57.920 --> 44:02.880]  the back of the paper we arrested him to protect him and to protect his
[44:02.880 --> 44:09.400]  cover then they get plastic surgery and that's the end of it exactly so as we
[44:09.400 --> 44:16.120]  outlined in on Friday the likely perpetrators are these gangs who are
[44:16.120 --> 44:21.640]  engaged in tribal warfare and have been for decades basically there's bombings
[44:21.640 --> 44:26.160]  in India every month there was one last month of the embassy there was obviously
[44:26.160 --> 44:32.320]  the parliament bombing a few years ago and yeah the potential exists that
[44:32.320 --> 44:36.440]  there were provocateurs in there and now with the propaganda and the way they're
[44:36.440 --> 44:40.080]  scripting it it seems that that could have been the case but we asked the
[44:40.080 --> 44:44.960]  question you know if this is packed sponsored by Pakistan they were being
[44:44.960 --> 44:49.880]  making strenuous and peace overtures towards India recently
[44:49.880 --> 44:56.200]  unprecedented then what would they possibly have to gain from sponsoring a
[44:56.200 --> 45:00.040]  brutal attack against innocent civilians which was played out on
[45:00.040 --> 45:04.200]  international television for everyone to see well what did herotica the Jerusalem
[45:04.200 --> 45:08.840]  post report five years ago that's in some of my documentaries that they
[45:08.840 --> 45:15.960]  reported that Mossad and Shin back the external and internal intelligence arms
[45:15.960 --> 45:23.440]  of Israel created fake al-Qaeda groups with real Arabs and in some cases the
[45:23.440 --> 45:28.440]  Arabs didn't even know they were being handled they were just being paid and
[45:28.440 --> 45:33.040]  they were being paid by Arab or Arab looking and speaking Israelis to go
[45:33.040 --> 45:37.720]  stage bombings of buses and nightclubs every time there was about to be a peace
[45:37.720 --> 45:43.120]  deal because the military and the private corporations that make their huge
[45:43.120 --> 45:50.080]  profits out of it all the whole military state in Israel they want the
[45:50.080 --> 45:54.600]  wars to continue they want the tension to continue they don't want peace go
[45:54.600 --> 46:01.760]  ahead yeah so that's always the case in Britain the US or Canada where you get
[46:01.760 --> 46:08.920]  these radical groups in some cases it's just gangs it's just street gangs who
[46:08.920 --> 46:16.200]  were provocative into talking about or writing crude plans about how they want
[46:16.200 --> 46:22.880]  to carry out terror attacks and in every single case such as the Chicago 7 in
[46:22.880 --> 46:28.480]  America who were who were basically near retarded they never had any
[46:28.480 --> 46:33.760]  capability of doing anything they just wanted to pay off from the FBI agent
[46:33.760 --> 46:38.800]  saying in Canada with the so-called beheading plot same with every single
[46:38.800 --> 46:43.760]  case in England of these where they both these terror cells it always turns out
[46:43.760 --> 46:50.120]  that there's a provocateur behind them but in this case just behind him he's
[46:50.120 --> 46:57.400]  always the leader he's the founder that the FBI MI5 MI6 Mossad Shin Bet
[46:57.400 --> 47:03.240]  French intelligence German intelligence they're always lead it's not like an
[47:03.240 --> 47:06.000]  infiltrator got into the group they can say well we've got to watch them they
[47:06.000 --> 47:12.440]  always found it they always find the unstable schizophrenics they normally
[47:12.440 --> 47:16.480]  go off of city welfare files because when you get on welfare they make a lot of
[47:16.480 --> 47:20.720]  these young men go through psychological testing they have files on them and they'll
[47:20.720 --> 47:24.760]  offer them a hundred grand a piece just a videotape a federal building in Miami
[47:24.760 --> 47:31.000]  right again last Monday Reuters der Spiegel German intelligence caught
[47:31.000 --> 47:37.320]  attacking a NATO base trying to blame it on the Serbs now in this case you've
[47:37.320 --> 47:41.960]  got obvious obvious tribal warfare in that region there are real terror attacks
[47:41.960 --> 47:47.040]  every month in fact there's one today in Pakistan a car bombing just completely
[47:47.040 --> 47:52.040]  ignored by the media they happen all the time so there are real terrorist groups
[47:52.040 --> 47:57.600]  in that region because there's real tribal warfare going on but the the claim
[47:57.600 --> 48:03.200]  that it's all being directed by Pakistan in the case of the Mumbai attack again
[48:03.200 --> 48:06.520]  what I mean what would they have to benefit from the full might of the US
[48:06.520 --> 48:13.560]  military targeting them there's reports now that as soon as the attack began to
[48:13.560 --> 48:18.920]  unfold in Mumbai despite you know widespread confusion about who its
[48:18.920 --> 48:25.480]  perpetrators were and what the mouth it was the US aircraft carriers some of
[48:25.480 --> 48:29.960]  which were already in the region but additional ones were moving towards the
[48:29.960 --> 48:36.400]  Pakistani border and now you have the Pakistani troops moving from the Afghan
[48:36.400 --> 48:41.360]  border to the Indian border so in the very first couple of hours that it was
[48:41.360 --> 48:46.880]  unfolding these aircraft carriers start to move towards Pakistan here's an
[48:46.880 --> 48:52.680]  example in fact John try to pull this up I don't think it was the last time it
[48:52.680 --> 49:00.000]  was the before the last time about a month ago I was on was actually the day
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.240]  after the election or was it two days after I was on press TV international
[49:04.240 --> 49:11.440]  Iranian television and I went on there and I said they're going to attack
[49:11.440 --> 49:17.960]  Pakistan they're going to stage an event to escalate a war between India and
[49:17.960 --> 49:25.360]  Pakistan or at least at a near war that's going to be what Obama does and
[49:25.360 --> 49:33.560]  there was one of Obama's advisors on the show big Democrat and he said yeah
[49:33.560 --> 49:38.160]  yeah that's you know but he just took what I said and spun it and said yes
[49:38.160 --> 49:43.120]  you'll have to deal with Pakistan I mean we're on record Paul calling it I mean
[49:43.120 --> 49:47.040]  that's another reason we know it staged not just all the other evidence there's
[49:47.040 --> 49:50.360]  hundreds of other points around even making here I mean I'm not trying to
[49:50.360 --> 49:55.600]  sound arrogant I'm just giving you a fact here that you know our minds move a
[49:55.600 --> 49:58.400]  million miles an hour on this stuff when you eat drink and sleep it and trying to
[49:58.400 --> 50:02.160]  explain all the subtle nuances I mean you know what you're seeing when you've
[50:02.160 --> 50:05.680]  seen it over and over again you see the scripting you see the setups you see the
[50:05.680 --> 50:11.440]  same manuals a day unlike any other in the long course of American history a
[50:11.440 --> 50:16.040]  terrorist act of war against this country the enemy struck America on
[50:16.040 --> 50:21.440]  September 11th but who is the enemy been locked in this is his ammo we have to
[50:21.440 --> 50:24.600]  look to the Middle East we have to look to the sum of been locked in fabled
[50:24.600 --> 50:28.480]  enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[50:28.480 --> 50:32.840]  intelligence networks inside the United States some US investigators believe
[50:32.840 --> 50:38.360]  that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US I'm
[50:38.360 --> 50:43.080]  aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained in Laden's connections to
[50:43.080 --> 50:47.840]  the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI the Saudi Arabian connection the Israeli
[50:47.840 --> 50:51.400]  intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow government and much
[50:51.400 --> 50:56.800]  much more fabled enemies get the DVD at info wars dot com or see it in super

[54:04.680 --> 54:08.640]  Texas it's the police doing it it's in mainstream news the military regular
[54:08.640 --> 54:12.760]  army will be working with your local police high treason the destruction of
[54:12.760 --> 54:18.200]  the republic in your face but the public can't even find the u.s. on a map so how
[54:18.200 --> 54:23.800]  are they going to be able to know then that that's tyranny somehow we've got
[54:23.800 --> 54:27.680]  to stop this I mean this is just so bold when I cover the next hour great
[54:27.680 --> 54:31.560]  article by Paul Watson up on prisonplanet.com Paul you posted some
[54:31.560 --> 54:36.440]  videos from police state 2000 of troops coming up and telling cameraman to turn
[54:36.440 --> 54:40.680]  their cameras off of practicing taking over the police stations and city halls
[54:40.680 --> 54:47.720]  and things will you add the video them confiscating guns yeah and then people
[54:47.720 --> 54:51.400]  don't believe it once you add the article from like three months ago where
[54:51.400 --> 54:54.040]  the governor of Illinois announced they're gonna use army to confiscate
[54:54.040 --> 55:00.400]  guns but they're just here to help Alex yeah well I mean but it doesn't matter
[55:00.400 --> 55:07.000]  if it's on national TV still doesn't exist so it I mean when we reported that
[55:07.000 --> 55:14.000]  the preachers and the pastors were being trained to were pacify their
[55:14.000 --> 55:19.640]  congregation to not resist when martial laws implemented you know they all came
[55:19.640 --> 55:24.520]  out and said we were making it up and then all the local TV news stations
[55:24.520 --> 55:28.720]  reported it and then they said well it might be true but there's nothing to
[55:28.720 --> 55:34.280]  worry about and still to this day to what is it two years after the all the
[55:34.280 --> 55:41.960]  local TV stations reported it on it it's still listed on museumofhoaxers.com
[55:41.960 --> 55:47.760]  one of these urban myth websites as a likely hoax and now they're gonna have
[55:47.760 --> 55:52.280]  mythbusters do a two-hour special on 9-11 truth they're having the national
[55:52.280 --> 55:56.000]  geographic channel and they'll just get up there and lie just like museum of
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.920]  hoaxes says we're lying I mean imagine what it's like to get secret FEMA
[55:59.920 --> 56:04.000]  documents and then to make calls to local preachers I know and to say how do
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.720]  you know about this yes they came to me but I refused I know a local pastor of a
[56:07.720 --> 56:12.040]  large Baptist church and to then talk to a deacon of another church and I was
[56:12.040 --> 56:16.720]  sent all this and then I had the the pastor on the show and then FEMA came
[56:16.720 --> 56:22.680]  and threatened him somehow tracked back I mean these were FEMA documents with
[56:22.680 --> 56:26.640]  names and phone numbers folks I have to sleep at night with this stuff and the
[56:26.640 --> 56:31.760]  and the debunkers just lie and say we're making it up Paul I mean this
[56:31.760 --> 56:35.800]  website that quote telling me the article doesn't provide any very very
[56:35.800 --> 56:38.920]  viable source for it collect for its claims even though that the whole
[56:38.920 --> 56:45.240]  document was linked in the article and then all the comments below it there's
[56:45.240 --> 56:49.880]  the source and then here it is on local TV news and it's just they don't change
[56:49.880 --> 56:54.680]  any of this they don't care hey don't you little hired punks know something
[56:54.680 --> 56:58.760]  don't you understand that tyranny isn't cute you're not gonna be part of the

[57:03.920 --> 57:08.640]  obviously what this has been sold on the pretext of is that the troops are just
[57:08.640 --> 57:12.760]  here to help and you know times of emergency if there's a disaster they
[57:12.760 --> 57:16.400]  said in the army times that's gonna be used for riot control and suppressing
[57:16.400 --> 57:21.240]  the people and helping it car wrecks well what's wrong with the army they
[57:21.240 --> 57:25.720]  just life-flighted little girl you bastard look at what happened in

[59:04.600 --> 59:17.480]  radio network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want
[59:17.480 --> 59:24.720]  answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now
[59:24.720 --> 59:35.880]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones six weeks ago the army in North Carolina
[59:35.880 --> 59:41.480]  they're going to deploy a brigade combat groups warfare against the
[59:41.480 --> 59:45.640]  American people it states it clearly that was 3000 trips now they're announcing
[59:45.640 --> 59:51.240]  20,000 for starters I've been studying this it looks like it's going to be at
[59:51.240 --> 59:57.920]  least 50,000 regularly station trips and then according to Obama 1 million kind
[59:57.920 --> 1:00:02.160]  of like glorified security cops or community police like they have in
[1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:05.880]  England where they come up and ask you questions train you to be asked questions
[1:00:05.880 --> 1:00:10.880]  every day harassed train you to interact with the police constantly to be asked
[1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:14.640]  questions they now do this all over England if you're in a park just sitting
[1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:19.360]  there they walk up and ask if you're a terrorist and ask your pedophile it's
[1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:22.960]  just all social conditioning and it's all being announced Paul Watson in
[1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:27.680]  closing here we'll have more reports out on prisonplanet.com about what really
[1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:33.120]  happened in India in Mumbai it's got all the airmarks of a staged event
[1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:37.840]  classical stage event this is Obama's crises we said it would be in Pakistan
[1:00:37.840 --> 1:00:42.120]  and India here it is but just on the subject of this article you wrote it's
[1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:46.480]  from the Washington Post Washington post 20,000 more trips to be deployed for
[1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:52.480]  domestic security now now how this works is they announced one brigade six
[1:00:52.480 --> 1:00:55.920]  weeks ago five weeks ago and then in the article it really listed three
[1:00:55.920 --> 1:01:02.760]  brigades and a bunch of other units or around 15,000 trips now they're
[1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:07.920]  announcing 20,000 you watch it'll be 50,000 within a year and then you will
[1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:11.840]  see them they're gonna be everywhere again just standing around doing nothing
[1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:15.280]  with machine guns and they'll come up with police ask you questions it'll be on
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:19.240]  the news people being questioned I mean I'm going back six seven years ago at
[1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:22.960]  sporting events high school games they'll just have the army there searching
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:28.120]  people in Tennessee and in Alabama in the middle of nowhere in Montana it's
[1:01:28.120 --> 1:01:32.480]  just trying you to be a slave line-up slave show me your papers little kids
[1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:35.320]  with their parents having their bags searched training them to be a slave
[1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:39.000]  the public schools are training them how to be prisoners Paul Watson closing
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  comments on this well that's right Alex I mean look at what they did in
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:47.960]  Katrina they weren't helping anyone they were shooting alleged looters they
[1:01:47.960 --> 1:01:51.880]  would shove in people around sports stadiums you know making pointless
[1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:56.720]  patrols on deserted streets and in fact the local politicians were using them
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:02:00.960]  to as an armed escort to go back to their houses which were even badly
[1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:05.600]  flooded to rescue their possessions well cops stood down and let their family
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:10.040]  members mothers and people in nursing homes die over five days yeah that's
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:14.760]  what they were useful I mean they deliberately botched the relief efforts
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:19.080]  for Katrina then waited a week to provide the pretext for troops to come in I
[1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:23.600]  mean FEMA were preventing the trucks full of food medicine and water get from
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:26.680]  getting through and that you know as we reported the time they cut the
[1:02:26.680 --> 1:02:32.480]  communication lines so they need to have arms and arms standoffs with FEMA
[1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:37.640]  paramilitary police climbing fences in the dead of night this is after the
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:41.600]  hurricane hit but before things even broke down cutting all the lines that's
[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:45.860]  why the police all walked off the job FEMA hit them and hit them hard with
[1:02:45.860 --> 1:02:50.600]  military precision so it created the pretext to say we need the troops are
[1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:54.320]  even though the the local authorities could have dealt with it if they hadn't
[1:02:54.320 --> 1:02:59.760]  been stabbed again FEMA secretly at over 50 locations cutting power to police
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:04.200]  departments and fire departments and local emergency and with fire axes
[1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:09.920]  hacking down the police communication towers right and this new deployment
[1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:15.360]  that's been in the Washington Post today as we report it's all codified under
[1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:20.080]  the John Warner Defense Authorization Act which was repealed but then Bush
[1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:24.400]  attached a signing statement to it saying you know he didn't feel bound by
[1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:29.880]  the repeal so the question is Obama has said he would it will reverse all these
[1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:34.040]  Bush signing statements will the John Warner defense authorization act be
[1:03:34.040 --> 1:03:39.640]  one of them with with his actions on you know Gates and Hillary Clinton it seems
[1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:45.360]  doubtful yeah we should do a story about all of his wicked appointments now I
[1:03:45.360 --> 1:03:49.080]  can't wait to ask Tarvely about his savior Hillary being appointed Secretary
[1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:55.160]  of State we're moving to have her confirmed we should do a story explaining
[1:03:55.160 --> 1:03:59.760]  the fact that he isn't going to reverse anything real Paul Watson I really
[1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:02.920]  appreciate your great work everybody should go get your story at prison
[1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:07.440]  planet.com right now thanks for joining us thanks Alex there he goes
[1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:11.680]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:14.960]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:18.520]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:21.800]  breadline if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the Super
[1:04:21.800 --> 1:04:25.640]  Dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:28.640]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:32.520]  bailout for special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:36.000]  turned off the telephones and email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.960]  billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the American and
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:44.160]  European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:48.120]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food
[1:04:48.120 --> 1:04:52.800]  beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a
[1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:56.840]  loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:01.040]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:04.880]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[1:05:04.880 --> 1:05:08.480]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[1:05:08.480 --> 1:05:12.680]  but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[1:05:12.680 --> 1:05:16.200]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one-third of
[1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:18.920]  Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other
[1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:23.480]  necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get
[1:05:23.480 --> 1:05:26.320]  food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to
[1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:29.480]  understand that by having a supply of storable food the government the new
[1:05:29.480 --> 1:05:33.480]  old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of
[1:05:33.480 --> 1:05:37.200]  self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is gonna take care of your family in
[1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:41.000]  the final equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship

[1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:37.760]  Washington post 20,000 more US troops to be deployed for domestic security to work
[1:06:37.760 --> 1:06:42.600]  with local police and crowd control and law enforcement activities as well as
[1:06:42.600 --> 1:06:48.200]  disaster and anti-terrorism this whole thing is designed and built and set up
[1:06:48.200 --> 1:06:53.480]  to not just suppress the American people but also to take over governorships to
[1:06:53.480 --> 1:06:59.400]  take over states and the congressional legislature the Congress and remember
[1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:04.480]  six weeks ago now almost eight trillion dollars stolen by the offshore private
[1:07:04.480 --> 1:07:10.920]  banks of the banker takeover bill they threatened martial law the Congress was
[1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:15.960]  threatened with martial law by Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson and
[1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:20.160]  senator in-hop is now on record that that's who made the threats we had other
[1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:24.240]  congressmen on who were told the threat but were told under House rules and
[1:07:24.240 --> 1:07:29.040]  Senate rules that they could not speak about it because it was in a closed
[1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:34.400]  meetings that's right Congress closes up the doors and went in there and Paulson
[1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:41.120]  told them with Bernanke sitting right to his left so that's how they operate
[1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:44.360]  ladies and gentlemen there's no way to get around this there's no way to twist
[1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:48.160]  this in your minds there's no way to distract yourself from what's happening
[1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:53.360]  let's just look at Katrina alone it's on record it was in hundreds of
[1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:58.600]  newspapers we interviewed some of the heads of the parishes all over
[1:07:58.600 --> 1:08:05.040]  Louisiana after the hurricane went over remember it took about 12 hours for it
[1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:08.600]  to flood and for the levees to break
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  FEMA went in and cut the generator power sabotage the generators owned by the
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:20.800]  parish the parishes by the counties parishes in Louisiana the counties same
[1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:26.080]  thing people always email me what I'm talking about here in Texas we live
[1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:29.920]  next to Louisiana so we know a little bit more about the state and some I just
[1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:33.760]  forget how ignorant the public is on average I mean I meet people from New
[1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:36.680]  York all the time who are really smart competent people but they really believe
[1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:40.600]  we ride horses to work in Texas and that we live in live in log cabins but but
[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:49.600]  side issue the point here is that FEMA went in and sabotaged and cut lines and
[1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:56.960]  then police you know in the main Paris at New Orleans is based in the county went
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:01.080]  in then this has been on national television went in and fixed it and
[1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:06.280]  FEMA showed up with guns and said we are cutting the power we are cutting the
[1:09:06.280 --> 1:09:14.320]  power to police and fire and emergency management radios and the police in win
[1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:20.160]  one parish actually had to point their rifles at FEMA and say no you're not
[1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:25.120]  under orders of the sheriff and under orders of the head emergency manager in
[1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:34.600]  the parish on record go go pull it up now why would FEMA go in right before the
[1:09:34.600 --> 1:09:39.040]  levees broke and cut communication well I believe the hundreds of witnesses that
[1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:43.240]  said they saw a giant explosion and saw army troops in the area right before it
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:48.880]  happened with the levees got blown 80 plus years before it's on record that the
[1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:55.600]  federal government blew the levees to flood the lower wards and to save the
[1:09:55.600 --> 1:09:59.640]  more wealthy areas of town that's why that there's that story going around
[1:09:59.640 --> 1:10:06.000]  originally because it's on record but we don't know they blew the levees we
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:12.680]  know they blew it and the last big flood there that killed thousands from
[1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:21.680]  another hurricane but we know and it's not like the whole government's evil you
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:26.560]  know I had family you know they're in in helicopters in the week after is saving
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:29.560]  people off rooftops most the army was out there trying to a job it's
[1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:35.080]  compartmentalization they didn't know that FEMA cut the police communication
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:40.480]  lines to make local government look inept and to say oh look FEMA needs
[1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:46.280]  unlimited power and control through north com you see my quotes screwing up
[1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:49.800]  they can then say see we need even more power more funding when they already had
[1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:57.520]  basically omnipotent power and unlimited funding so the police were then you know
[1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:01.160]  later were criticizing all that you know two-thirds of the New Orleans police
[1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:05.600]  walked off the jobs well they're used to being micromanaged they're not trained
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:08.920]  to go on their own initiative they're not trained that if communications are
[1:11:08.920 --> 1:11:16.520]  cut off what to do they're told everything including how to wipe their
[1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:22.160]  behinds they are micromanaged they are controlled and so suddenly their
[1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:25.640]  communications don't work and after about six hours of that yes two-thirds
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:29.560]  of them walked off and went home to their families take care of their families
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:33.600]  they said oh look at these inept locals they don't know what they're doing
[1:11:33.600 --> 1:11:41.480]  meanwhile FEMA would go in with fire axes and hack the communication lines
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:46.080]  rip them out rip them down and then the police would come in and jury rig it and
[1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:50.120]  fix it with the county engineers the parish engineers and FEMA would come
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:58.320]  back with guns pointing guns at them now those FEMA guys are the bad guys but
[1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:05.720]  FEMA itself is highly compartmentalized I mean you think about how
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:13.080]  diabolical it is for FEMA we learned almost three years ago now to go around
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:18.480]  the country and hire 13,000 preachers and they doubled those in 2007 to 26,000 and
[1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:23.280]  to secretly train them we have their training manuals to submit to Romans
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:27.880]  13 do what the government says go to FEMA camps turn your guns in take an
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:31.600]  oculations let them take your children and then we even had all the videos
[1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:36.400]  suddenly the TV preachers were seeing exactly that on television flocks were
[1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:42.520]  being taught that at their churches and people didn't believe us even though we
[1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:46.240]  had the secret FEMA documents even though we had several the preachers on
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:50.360]  even though I independently verified this is going on in Austin, Texas and then
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:55.240]  it came out I mean how diabolical is it that we have this huge black op
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:13:03.360]  government doing drills in the majority of US cities and towns thousands of
[1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:10.440]  drills going back 20 years where the army comes in the Marines come in
[1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:15.240]  generally the two groups other farm services have been involved in smaller
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:20.440]  operations sometimes assisting and they just show up they covertly give the
[1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:25.160]  town you know a half million dollars even in small towns they give cash in
[1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:29.880]  on the side the police chief sheriff's emergency managers I've got police chief
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:33.160]  San Antonio on video saying they tried to bribe him that they did bribe other
[1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:37.040]  city officials that I talked to Austin police who they approached and Travis
[1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:43.080]  County Sheriff's Department people you mean a name one would send it back the
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:47.560]  head of the Travis County SWAT team they approached him I had talked to him six
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:53.600]  months before and he laughed at me I ran into him at the courthouse he called me
[1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:56.720]  up and said come to my office please how did you know about this again who are
[1:13:56.720 --> 1:14:00.120]  you who are you working for how did you know Delta Force would come here and do
[1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:05.000]  this and I said sir they're going to every county in Texas that's why I said
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:12.280]  have they been to you yet and the guy at the Marine Corps Vietnam vet head of
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:16.320]  the SWAT team laughed at me but you know what he was a real American he wasn't
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:21.520]  laughing after he found out it was all true then they fired him by the way and
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:26.440]  the next time I showed up at the SWAT team office guess what videos I saw they
[1:14:26.440 --> 1:14:29.840]  weren't put out for me to see him when I was walking in the door in one of the
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:35.520]  little office areas I saw Oklahoma bombing cover-up police state 2000 I
[1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:39.520]  saw my film and other films they had decided they better look into what I
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:44.200]  was saying and you know what those men went down the rabbit hole the new
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:48.000]  commander seemed friendly enough but he was looking at me like he was on a
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:53.160]  rabbit hunt though you can see it in the eyes when I was in Lubies one day
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:56.560]  eating by myself about it I guess two years ago I came up sat down the table
[1:14:56.560 --> 1:15:02.440]  by me was trying to assess me assess me I'm a defender of the Republic I learned
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:05.880]  that private corporations have taken over our military and have a long term
[1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:10.080]  almost 30 year plan to overthrow the United States and as a defender of the
[1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:21.480]  Republic I'm here trying to warn people that's who I am you want to assess me go
[1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:33.440]  ahead you want to assess me that's who I am it's what I stand for and I'm not
[1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:37.760]  going to be conned especially when it's all in black and white in my face when I
[1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:41.760]  go witness Marines all over the country training to take our guns and
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:47.840]  admitting it's for the United States I know treason when I see it when the
[1:15:47.840 --> 1:15:52.480]  North American Union is openly being set up and judicial watch sews and gets the
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:56.240]  secret documents and they start off by saying we've got to keep this secret
[1:15:56.240 --> 1:15:59.640]  from the public we're going to set up carbon taxes put troops on the streets
[1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:06.800]  of America bring in world government I know treason when I see it you know
[1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:10.000]  this government claims it's our government wraps itself in the flag and
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  everything's about how it's for the troops now they care about the troops
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:18.200]  and all of this propaganda the people running this country are anti-american
[1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:21.560]  they're globalist they want to destroy our sovereignty they want to capture the
[1:16:21.560 --> 1:16:24.640]  United States and you know what they have captured it and now they're trying
[1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:28.320]  to consolidate that power and crack down the public because they're about to
[1:16:28.320 --> 1:16:31.880]  suck your bank accounts dry and you're about to all lose your jobs and crime's
[1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:36.880]  going to explode in the streets they know their social engineers their behavioral
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:40.680]  psychologist the people that study civilization they know exactly what's
[1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:44.360]  going to happen now people are saying well Alex you know we do need the army
[1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:49.080]  on the streets there's about to be a depression and crimes up and so the
[1:16:49.080 --> 1:16:54.320]  public you know is going to need this as if it all just now got set up as if it

[1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:08.120]  years we know of preparation for all of this public information since 1984 all
[1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:12.600]  set up beforehand and then they come out in the Washington Post today and the
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:17.560]  first line in the article is about how old they're just now setting this up
[1:17:17.560 --> 1:17:36.000]  it's happening it's happening now and by the way do you know what else we saw at

[1:31:32.640 --> 1:31:36.920]  the government a black and white in a post 9-11 world security hire we're a
[1:31:36.920 --> 1:31:41.000]  country at war not an ideal situation for anyone but there are some that say if
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:44.320]  we have another terrorist attack on American soil the u.s. will be under
[1:31:44.320 --> 1:31:48.960]  martial law on the phone we have us with us the man you just saw in the video
[1:31:48.960 --> 1:31:52.880]  that is Alex Jones a man who has set forth to expose these supposed indiscretions
[1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:56.480]  by the government we also have with us terrorism law expert Jeff Atticott with
[1:31:56.480 --> 1:31:59.960]  us thank you both for joining me this morning thanks for having me I appreciate
[1:31:59.960 --> 1:32:03.280]  it let's first talk with you Alex by phone Alex you feel America is going to
[1:32:03.280 --> 1:32:06.760]  be under some martial law pressure as soon as we get attacked again is that
[1:32:06.760 --> 1:32:10.880]  correct well back at 99 I met with your police chief and we threw Delta Force
[1:32:10.880 --> 1:32:14.360]  out they brought in large bags of cash and tried to buy them off then I talked
[1:32:14.360 --> 1:32:18.200]  to emergency managers around the country when I was fighting this then and found
[1:32:18.200 --> 1:32:22.840]  out there was a covert plan to take over all of our major cities now that's been
[1:32:22.840 --> 1:32:27.360]  in the Associated Press the Homeland Security Committee in Congress with the
[1:32:27.360 --> 1:32:33.120]  highest level security clearances are not allowed to see the details of PDD
[1:32:33.120 --> 1:32:39.040]  51 signed May 9th of this year that literally makes the president a
[1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:44.520]  dictator and last year the president funded the John Warner Defense
[1:32:44.520 --> 1:32:48.680]  Authorization Act for domestic oppression of the American people it
[1:32:48.680 --> 1:32:54.080]  actually says that it is for domestic insurrection and rebellion this has
[1:32:54.080 --> 1:32:58.640]  nothing to do with terror the military industrial complex waging war on the
[1:32:58.640 --> 1:33:01.840]  people but let's talk about that presidential directive number 51 that
[1:33:01.840 --> 1:33:04.880]  you're talking about Mr. Atticott he's talking about the one that basically
[1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:09.960]  gives the president some power to go in in case of an emergency and establish
[1:33:09.960 --> 1:33:15.080]  some sort of order right is it as bad as he is mr. Jones calls it I don't think
[1:33:15.080 --> 1:33:21.040]  so lawyer for the people that were there in 99 presidential directives are not
[1:33:21.040 --> 1:33:25.000]  nothing new I mean the Clinton administration had a continuity PDD
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:29.960]  itself and this president has simply replaced that one with this one it's
[1:33:29.960 --> 1:33:33.880]  interesting because a lot of the annexes to the document are classified so I
[1:33:33.880 --> 1:33:36.920]  don't know how this gentleman has had access to those where he can tell us
[1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:42.760]  about what it says basically it if you read section 9 paragraph 9 it indicates
[1:33:42.760 --> 1:33:47.440]  that the executive branch has a responsibility for continuity and the
[1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:50.560]  judicial branch has a responsibility and also the legislative branch so it's
[1:33:50.560 --> 1:33:54.280]  it's really not the boogeyman this is nothing new nothing to get upset about
[1:33:54.280 --> 1:33:59.880]  it's actually the government to do this we mr. judge you're just alluding to
[1:33:59.880 --> 1:34:02.560]  the cameras and I think we heard a little bit at the top of the show about
[1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:06.320]  you talking about the blimps overhead do you really think we're gonna get to that
[1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:09.920]  point I have not seen any blimps in my neighborhood I don't really fear my
[1:34:09.920 --> 1:34:16.320]  police here let me break this down that is a Pentagon announcement of 2004 and
[1:34:16.320 --> 1:34:22.040]  they do now have them over DC LA and other areas and yes they are mounting
[1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:26.280]  high-altitude blimps these are so high you can't even see them without a
[1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:30.000]  telescope or a night you can see them because of the atmosphere in the sun
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:34.400]  but I already have Google who can I can actually Google my own home you know
[1:34:34.400 --> 1:34:39.920]  listen listen you know mr. Atticott's not stupid I looked into him okay and and
[1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:45.160]  he knows what he's doing we have the memos written by John you and the
[1:34:45.160 --> 1:34:49.960]  Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez saying they can torture children with pliers
[1:34:49.960 --> 1:34:54.920]  that the president is it says that with pliers it says the president is above
[1:34:54.920 --> 1:35:01.360]  the law and that all law flows from him and in PDD 51 he is saying he is in
[1:35:01.360 --> 1:35:06.480]  command of continuity of government and then Congress is in command that's
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:11.160]  what the executive commander and all the other agencies are under the executive
[1:35:11.160 --> 1:35:14.920]  branch all administrative agencies are under the executive branch so why would
[1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:18.840]  that be surprising that he is issuing policy memos to agencies within his
[1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:22.640]  control we will expect him to do that he will he will command the entire
[1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:26.360]  infrastructure that's not what it says but he's a president on his way out as
[1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:29.800]  well there's going to be a change in presidency up here com or that was a
[1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:34.640]  planet dot com or info wars dot com you can see the body or the body of evidence
[1:35:34.640 --> 1:35:38.440]  or go to Google and type in martial law 9-11 rise the police state or terror
[1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:42.040]  storms you can watch my films for free I have a better idea you could go to
[1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:46.600]  Google and pull up PDD 51 and read it for yourself and read paragraph 9 which
[1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:50.880]  talks about the responsibility of each branch of government and not executive
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:54.600]  takeover why don't you remember the four members of the homeland security
[1:35:54.600 --> 1:35:58.840]  committee and Congress who have been able to see part of it and then want to
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:02.120]  see the classified areas because they're saying that it looks like it's a
[1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:05.920]  martial law plan that's members of Congress and at a time you're counting
[1:36:05.920 --> 1:36:10.280]  on folks not going and seeing with the AP and the Oregonians and others had to
[1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:14.600]  say mr. Jones does the mentality or what mr. Jones is pushing here does it
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:19.320]  incite maybe us is it a fear mongering thing or does he have some
[1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:23.720]  validity to his points well obviously in time of conflict and we are definitely
[1:36:23.720 --> 1:36:27.240]  in a conflict with al-qaeda I mean they want to kill tens of thousands of
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:30.920]  Americans if they can that's a fact and our government has a responsibility to
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:34.520]  protect its citizens but I think mr. Jones is correct and that has to be
[1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:37.160]  balanced against civil liberties and where you draw that line is something
[1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:41.000]  that we need debated I think voices like his are important but we need to put
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:44.480]  them in context I mean you need to you need to look at the facts take a deep
[1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:49.320]  breath and make up your own mind but certainly you know this is America you
[1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:53.720]  have the right to say what you want to say you have a right to to your own
[1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:56.320]  opinion but you don't have a right to your own facts and I think that's the
[1:36:56.320 --> 1:37:00.760]  case you see here you know what I can prove my facts we have members of
[1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:04.640]  Congress who are concerned about this we have Republican and Democratic
[1:37:04.640 --> 1:37:09.000]  liberal and conservative top lawyers across the country saying this country
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:14.040]  is going into martial law Bob Woodward last year was in San Antonio and said
[1:37:14.040 --> 1:37:17.240]  he thinks we're going into a dictatorship that was in the front of the
[1:37:17.240 --> 1:37:21.000]  newspaper I'm not the only one that's worried about this by the way the
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:25.040]  borders are still wide open but the American people are being harassed and
[1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:29.480]  controlled we have the federal documents and by the way I had a call if you want
[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:33.080]  to come to baby for an hour I'll be on the radio on KLBJ today for two hours
[1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:37.040]  what are you doing we are talking with Alex Jones from info wars.com about the
[1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:40.640]  changes here in America and he believes we're changing into a police state and
[1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:44.720]  also joining me is Dr. Jeff Attica he is our expert on terrorism law and we thank
[1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:47.880]  you both for joining us we're kind of continue our conversation Alex you've
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:50.840]  got some films out there you go to protest and you complain we're gearing
[1:37:50.840 --> 1:37:54.160]  up for this police state because you say cops are swarming the streets with guns
[1:37:54.160 --> 1:37:57.400]  these are huge protests like the one we just saw you in New York during the
[1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:01.280]  Republican National Convention of course there's some increased police presence
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:04.960]  in New York after it being attacked but do you honestly think that we're getting
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:08.880]  to a place in time where nobody's gonna have any freedom to do what they
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:12.280]  actually want to do? Yes people are being arrested coast to coast for
[1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:16.880]  peacefully protesting or demonstrating New York has banned independent news
[1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:21.080]  cameras on the streets some of my cameramen have now been arrested and
[1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:26.720]  told that they're terrorists for having video cameras all over the place we have
[1:38:26.720 --> 1:38:32.120]  neocons a top neocon in the Philadelphia news said we need another 9-11 so they
[1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:36.320]  can get their bigger police state out that's been a big national controversy
[1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:40.240]  the last few days. Alex let's talk about that because and Jeff maybe you can
[1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:45.400]  add some to this we haven't had another 9-11 and is it perhaps because of the
[1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:49.160]  fact that we've taken some of the precautions that Mr. Jones is talking
[1:38:49.160 --> 1:38:52.280]  about that he does not like? Well you got to look at it from the the
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:55.200]  representative democracy all three branches of our government have become
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:38:58.080]  very involved in this war on terror Congress has taken a number of
[1:38:58.080 --> 1:39:01.800]  significant steps the military commission act it's just the latest
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:04.560]  probably one of the latest and the largest steps that they've taken the
[1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:07.360]  president clearly believes that we're in the state of war the Constitution gives
[1:39:07.360 --> 1:39:10.920]  him that authority as a commander-in-chief our Supreme Court generally has
[1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:14.360]  upheld the policies of the administration and of the Congress so it's
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:17.840]  not you know it's not one branch that is engaged in a conspiracy it's all three
[1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:21.320]  branches of the government believe that we're in a state of conflict they have
[1:39:21.320 --> 1:39:25.280]  them they have the obligation to protect the military and they're moving forward in
[1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:28.040]  a judicious manner have there been missed responses I'm sure there has
[1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:33.720]  whatever about the fact that Congress has asked to see BDD51 and the classified
[1:39:33.720 --> 1:39:37.560]  sections and has been told no well that's your word and I don't have enough
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:41.280]  information to say whether you're able to see it or not I don't really know you
[1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:45.480]  and I haven't got you know I don't know Mr. Jones I have to admit that I don't
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:48.040]  like the fact that they look through my liquids when I'm getting on a plane for
[1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:51.640]  the worst space shuttle Discovery astronauts are just hours away from
[1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:56.320]  returning to earth and some folks in Wisconsin are afloat over this big
[1:39:56.320 --> 1:40:01.840]  bubbly beverage new 7 out 11 is next
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:11.120]  covering your home town from newsrooms across the region this is news 7 and 11
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:16.000]  the scenario was a fake but the pepper spray and Billy clubs used to break up
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:21.240]  this riot were definitely real good evening I'm Miranda Stevens whether
[1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:26.080]  it's terrorism riots or any major disaster local agencies will be the
[1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:31.160]  first to respond that's why Roanoke City wants its disaster training to be as
[1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:39.880]  real as possible Jeremy Butterfield has more it's supposed to look like a riot
[1:40:39.880 --> 1:40:44.840]  in the scene at William Fleming High School had all the elements one of the
[1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:48.760]  rioters that the guard and the police force had to take down an arrest and
[1:40:48.760 --> 1:40:54.840]  did very successfully in this scenario everyone has a role to play the
[1:40:54.840 --> 1:40:59.160]  rioters were ready to fight back as Roanoke police Roanoke fire local
[1:40:59.160 --> 1:41:03.080]  National Guard troops and members of the Virginia Defense Force secured
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:10.560]  perimeters and moved in to make the arrest prior to 9-11 these organizations
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:14.400]  couldn't communicate and did not work together they worked to support each
[1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:19.520]  other but not together and with the recent events of the last three to five
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:24.640]  years we've become very good at working together which is very important of
[1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:29.040]  course these weren't real rioters the rebels in t-shirts were all members of
[1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:33.680]  one of the participating agencies but you can tell that during the exercise if
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:38.240]  you weren't protected by an orange vest signifying you as an observer you were
[1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:43.000]  in danger of being hit by eggs bottles Billy clubs or even the occasional
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:48.520]  well-placed round from a sniper we try to make this very real give a real feel
[1:41:48.520 --> 1:41:52.720]  to it we had some the fire department fight at some some live burning out
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:57.200]  here so we had smoke flames objects being thrown a lot of chaos there's gonna
[1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:00.160]  be a lot of chaos and a civil disturbance situation and that's what we
[1:42:00.160 --> 1:42:04.440]  want to try to incorporate as much as possible teamwork plays a major role
[1:42:04.440 --> 1:42:08.600]  mountain police had to coordinate with the fire department while national guard
[1:42:08.600 --> 1:42:13.400]  troops marched in formation toward the rioters without cooperation throughout
[1:42:13.400 --> 1:42:18.640]  all the agencies the rioters would have quickly taken control I think everybody
[1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:22.320]  learned a little bit mistakes are made but we'd rather make those mistakes here
[1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:26.960]  than in a real situation this was the fourth year the agencies have
[1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:31.280]  participated in this drill and organizers say the old adage practice
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:36.200]  makes perfect certainly holds true in the face of disaster Jeremy Butterfield
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:40.720]  new seven Roanoke well I guess you can never be too prepared something we
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:45.240]  should all keep in mind this week as we prepare for more rain isn't that right
[1:42:45.240 --> 1:42:49.040]  that's right our preparation is gonna be take the umbrella as you head out
[1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:53.240]  tomorrow morning in fact a lot of folks are gonna need it tonight we're finding
[1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:57.520]  some showers across the region some are a little bit heavy at times and we'll
[1:42:57.520 --> 1:43:01.640]  take that includes New Orleans where today authorities stepped up their
[1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:05.600]  efforts to empty the city Bob Woodruff is there again tonight with an
[1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:11.000]  extraordinary human drama unfolding Bob that's true Elizabeth and good evening
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:14.840]  from New Orleans here the police and the National Guard find themselves in a
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:18.640]  very difficult position tonight to try to carry out an order to force people
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:23.520]  from the city without actually using force
[1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:31.800]  today in New Orleans they got a lot tougher on the holdouts not only the
[1:43:31.800 --> 1:43:39.080]  flooded areas but New Orleans driest and wealthiest neighborhoods too the
[1:43:39.080 --> 1:43:44.800]  police and National Guard going street-by-street house-to-house
[1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:49.360]  we need to make sure too that we knock the doors people usually need to make
[1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:54.640]  note call it yet they say there are no orders to use force just strong
[1:43:54.640 --> 1:44:00.560]  persuasion sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn instructions to
[1:44:00.560 --> 1:44:05.960]  disarm anyone inside we said guns will be taken no one will be able to be on
[1:44:05.960 --> 1:44:10.360]  we'll take all weapons that happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:15.440]  homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions residents were
[1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:19.440]  handcuffed on the ground in the end police took their weapons but let them
[1:44:19.440 --> 1:44:22.800]  stay in their homes they were a little bit threatened because our weapons were
[1:44:22.800 --> 1:44:27.440]  bigger than their weapons for many of the police and guard troops it is an
[1:44:27.440 --> 1:44:33.040]  uncomfortable job to do this in an American city this guard unit occupied
[1:44:33.040 --> 1:44:36.760]  a church using it as a base camp they had to leave a note because they could
[1:44:36.760 --> 1:44:41.560]  not get hold of the pastor to get permission it is surreal you just
[1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:46.280]  never you never expect to do this in your own country Chris Montgomery says
[1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:50.480]  he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American neighborhoods walking up and
[1:44:50.480 --> 1:44:53.960]  down these streets you don't you don't want to think about the stuff that you
[1:44:53.960 --> 1:44:59.640]  have to do somebody pops around the corner let me shoot in America and no
[1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:04.560]  one will be able to be armed we'll take all weapons it was a human drama with
[1:45:04.560 --> 1:45:09.840]  emotions and tensions running high Patty Connie is still trying to recover
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:14.600]  physically and emotionally they really did a number on me from the day police
[1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:20.920]  forced her from home it was traumatic all of a sudden they were banging on the
[1:45:20.920 --> 1:45:27.640]  front door the side door and the back door they said let us in Patty tried to
[1:45:27.640 --> 1:45:32.440]  explain she was on dry land she had plenty of food and water and didn't
[1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:38.640]  want to abandon her dogs but it didn't matter if you see six or eight police
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:45.840]  that look like linebackers pushing me in a corner you're you're in shock I'd say
[1:45:45.840 --> 1:45:51.440]  look at all my food I got plenty of food they kept pushing me back pushing me
[1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:58.320]  back and ended up like this then Patty showed them a small revolver she was
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:03.480]  carefully holding in the palm of her hand a camera crew was there to capture
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:12.920]  what unfolded next I said it's not even loaded and I dropped it on the floor
[1:46:12.920 --> 1:46:20.880]  while they punched me in the face look at my black and blue marks looking look
[1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:26.240]  at what they did to me they dragged me out of here I really thought they were
[1:46:26.240 --> 1:46:32.360]  going to kill me I really did we were coming back across the lake is when
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:37.160]  we got stopped by a Coast Guard and St. Tammany Sheriff's Department in the
[1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:42.240]  National Guard by gunpoint we had identification we were coming back from
[1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:46.160]  my house that we were taking the weapons out of so criminals wouldn't break in
[1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:51.440]  and steal them and we've had policemen tell us that that's what they wanted us
[1:46:51.440 --> 1:46:56.400]  to do but not the sheriff in St. Tammany they just wanted to confiscate
[1:46:56.400 --> 1:47:01.560]  them from us we felt like criminals at the time when they come up to us with M
[1:47:01.560 --> 1:47:06.720]  16s or AR 15s whatever it was but there were four of them with rifles and
[1:47:06.720 --> 1:47:11.240]  holding on us with a hands in the air until they got in our boat so they got
[1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:15.320]  on the boat and they asked us do you have any loaded weapons yes we do they're
[1:47:15.320 --> 1:47:21.960]  into that compartments we went to show them where the gun was and he screams
[1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:27.160]  don't touch it don't even move I'll get it I thought felt like it was on
[1:47:27.160 --> 1:47:32.840]  American and then we had been violated when they took like that we were
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:36.720]  shells out we were sitting around looking at each other and said we just got
[1:47:36.720 --> 1:47:41.840]  our guns taken away from they took them and they didn't have a right to take
[1:47:41.840 --> 1:47:45.120]  them they didn't have a reason to take them that was the thing we did nothing
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:50.320]  wrong but they took them anyway he said be thankful we're taking your guns
[1:47:50.320 --> 1:47:56.880]  here why should I be thankful well if they catch you with them on land they're
[1:47:56.880 --> 1:48:02.480]  going to take you straight to jail we live and prove but all I have to do is
[1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:07.120]  say look this is the law you had that feeling that you were violated you did
[1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:11.320]  they took something from you they stole something from you that's the only way
[1:48:11.320 --> 1:48:17.040]  to put it they took something that they didn't have a right to take what you
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:21.200]  come and get my gun for I'm a good citizen Marika Lattice a Baptist

[1:52:47.080 --> 1:52:54.400]  front while they search the vehicle I had a 22 long rifle my tenants girlfriend
[1:52:54.400 --> 1:53:00.240]  had a 22 Pearl Handle revolver given to her by her grandmother grandfather but
[1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:05.280]  Robert couldn't believe what he watched police do next to his rifle and his
[1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:11.360]  friends Pearl Handle revolver I saw them smash her gun given to her by
[1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:14.760]  grandmother grandfather just against the curb the other things that they busted
[1:53:14.760 --> 1:53:20.000]  up the 22 rifle they busted up these were police officers that went too far we
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  didn't have any rights I mean they treated us like criminals they treated
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:26.680]  us like if we were in a third world country I was scared because these guys
[1:53:26.680 --> 1:53:30.480]  weren't doing it by the book there was mayhem
[1:53:30.480 --> 1:53:35.400]  New Orleans police did not have control of the city anymore so the only what plan
[1:53:35.400 --> 1:53:38.440]  they thought I guess was to take the guns away from the people feed the
[1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:42.960]  warning of what this was you know this is Lake Australia all of a sudden boom
[1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:48.040]  they got our rights all right ladies and gentlemen I'm playing those clips for
[1:53:48.040 --> 1:53:51.240]  you I had to run over my parents house here out of town for a few days the
[1:53:51.240 --> 1:53:58.200]  Austin Police Department showed up within two minutes of the back door
[1:53:58.200 --> 1:54:03.720]  getting forced open it was locked looked like somebody forced it open and the
[1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:07.640]  houses up on a hill and whoever it was obviously saw the police and left so
[1:54:07.640 --> 1:54:14.160]  that was a good thing alarms are a good thing but if you have alarms you need
[1:54:14.160 --> 1:54:20.640]  to have a wireless system so if they cut the outside line it still goes off so
[1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:23.680]  good job the Austin Police Department next time I have the police chief in
[1:54:23.680 --> 1:54:29.680]  studio Art Acevedo a lot of thinking for the good response time on that but they
[1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:33.960]  can't always respond ladies and gentlemen that's why we have the Second
[1:54:33.960 --> 1:54:40.240]  Amendment and right before this happened about 45 minutes ago I was
[1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:43.920]  talking to Trey what was the it was the five after break in this hour he goes
[1:54:43.920 --> 1:54:46.760]  look at this email they're having a whole bunch of cars getting broken into over
[1:54:46.760 --> 1:54:51.200]  KLBJ well there's six radio stations in one building over in Emma's and he said
[1:54:51.200 --> 1:54:54.000]  yeah the cars are getting broken into every day over there and that's what
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:59.520]  I'm hearing from everybody just home invasion stealing it's on the news every
[1:54:59.520 --> 1:55:07.320]  day I mean the criminals are getting bold and the state is becoming lawless but
[1:55:07.320 --> 1:55:13.040]  the whole country as crime rates are just exploding and see that's the thing I
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:16.960]  want to commend police I mean I want them to do their job and be allowed to do
[1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:22.000]  their job which is responding to home invasions and break-ins and things like
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:26.600]  that instead of I mean 30 40 years ago somebody stole a car that was a big
[1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:32.680]  investigation I've had my car stolen twice in Dallas up there visiting and
[1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:37.320]  really high crime rate up there inside the city itself not the suburbs where
[1:55:37.320 --> 1:55:40.240]  folks are armed and then the thieves go after cars because they don't get their
[1:55:40.240 --> 1:55:44.240]  butt shot off going after those and the police wouldn't even come out they just
[1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:48.200]  say we don't do investigations on that anymore your car will be picked up so
[1:55:48.200 --> 1:55:52.440]  see it's a capitulation to crime meanwhile the prisons are filled with
[1:55:52.440 --> 1:55:57.680]  potheds instead of the criminals that need to be filled full of now keep going
[1:55:57.680 --> 1:56:00.200]  back to this illegal alien situation because there's 30 million illegal
[1:56:00.200 --> 1:56:04.320]  aliens in this country a couple million of them for sure criminals most of them
[1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:11.560]  running from Mexico and they've been imported here you know it's it's it's
[1:56:11.560 --> 1:56:15.040]  like in the 80s you look we're not saying Cubans are all criminals or even
[1:56:15.040 --> 1:56:18.920]  more predisposed to be criminals it's that that's who Castro sit into Miami
[1:56:18.920 --> 1:56:24.680]  hundreds of thousands of criminals that's the same thing with Mexico and all
[1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:31.320]  over the world the criminal element is coming to the United States and it is
[1:56:31.320 --> 1:56:36.120]  not pretty and of course we have our own domestic criminals but I see the crime
[1:56:36.120 --> 1:56:42.480]  statistics I see the numbers in it I mean take LA County 77% of their prison
[1:56:42.480 --> 1:56:47.920]  populations illegal aliens the feds won't deport them just in California alone
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:53.400]  there's 35,000 Chinese criminals there there are criminals who China won't take
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:55.360]  back

[1:57:24.240 --> 1:57:28.040]  take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the
[1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:31.880]  United States some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[1:57:31.880 --> 1:57:37.800]  very much engaged in spying in and on the US I'm aware that some Israeli
[1:57:37.800 --> 1:57:42.320]  citizens have been detained in Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers

[1:58:15.640 --> 1:58:27.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:58:27.400 --> 1:58:34.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:58:34.920 --> 1:58:52.680]  Alex Jones
[1:58:52.680 --> 1:58:59.280]  we are live we are in to the third hour already major general stubble bind we'll
[1:58:59.280 --> 1:59:04.520]  be joining us coming up in the next hour with his wife dr. LaBeau we have
[1:59:04.520 --> 1:59:08.240]  Lindsay Williams joining us in the next segment we're gonna have open phones for
[1:59:08.240 --> 1:59:13.400]  Lindsay Williams for the next hour so you can ask questions of the pastor who
[1:59:13.400 --> 1:59:18.280]  was for three years in the board meetings of Atlantic Richfield and then
[1:59:18.280 --> 1:59:21.920]  invited into other board meetings when he was on the North Slope in Alaska he
[1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:26.440]  detailed how they had more oil there than in Saudi Arabia how it was not allowed
[1:59:26.440 --> 1:59:30.000]  to go to the American people they use the phony environmental front to stop it
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:32.680]  from flowing but it's really about business and creating artificial
[1:59:32.680 --> 1:59:38.200]  scarcity through the oil cartel just like diamonds are much less valuable than
[1:59:38.200 --> 1:59:42.280]  they were then then they're sold for because the diamond cartel hordes them
[1:59:42.280 --> 1:59:47.720]  stockpiles them and buys them up around the world to make sure that the price
[1:59:47.720 --> 1:59:57.840]  stays high and of course he talked to a well one of his big sources I guess it
[1:59:57.840 --> 2:00:05.880]  was three four months ago when oil was $145 a barrel crude oil was and he said
[2:00:05.880 --> 2:00:10.000]  that the next two or three months that oil was gonna drop to below $50 a
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:14.320]  barrel or to $50 a barrel and that's exactly what it has done nobody could
[2:00:14.320 --> 2:00:18.440]  have imagined that the person basically told him the United States was gonna
[2:00:18.440 --> 2:00:24.800]  collapse so he was on with us two weeks ago a lot of interest obviously and so
[2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:29.520]  we're gonna have the listeners have a chance to talk to Lindsay Williams coming
[2:00:29.520 --> 2:00:41.320]  up at 1-800-25-99-231 now a lot of times well I mean almost all the time
[2:00:41.320 --> 2:00:45.880]  listeners can call in and talk about it well whatever they want you want to
[2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:49.680]  volunteer they disagree go to the headline because that always makes for
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:53.880]  interesting and informative radio the debate that ensues but when I do have
[2:00:53.880 --> 2:00:58.560]  guests on specific subjects people seem to never want to call in about the
[2:00:58.560 --> 2:01:02.760]  subject they're discussing so don't call during this next hour please unless you
[2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:06.760]  want to talk about oil prices energy the New World Order martial law and the
[2:01:06.760 --> 2:01:09.880]  police state being set up how the bankers are engineering the collapse the
[2:01:09.880 --> 2:01:15.640]  economy all those subjects together dealing with the controlled managed
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:19.680]  economy that the New World Order has set up on a planetary scale well that's a
[2:01:19.680 --> 2:01:26.080]  wide area to discuss but I really don't want to open the phones up for our guest
[2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:30.000]  and then have it be all over the map or on other subjects that's a wide area to
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:33.320]  discuss the economy to discuss the managed economy to discuss the bank or
[2:01:33.320 --> 2:01:38.760]  takeover the bailout because all of that ties in to the monetary and economic
[2:01:38.760 --> 2:01:43.240]  plan the global crime syndicate the New World Order architects are carrying out
[2:01:43.240 --> 2:01:47.480]  right now so Lindsay Williams coming up in the next segment and if you want to
[2:01:47.480 --> 2:01:51.960]  talk directly to him you know that's a wide field to be able to discuss but if

[2:02:13.240 --> 2:02:19.280]  of other important news obviously here in front of me as well today and I'll be
[2:02:19.280 --> 2:02:23.640]  going over some of that and then we'll talk about Codex Allentarius and the
[2:02:23.640 --> 2:02:27.520]  ways the United Nations controlled by big corporations want to shut down being
[2:02:27.520 --> 2:02:34.520]  able to buy vitamin C vitamin E herbs me alternative medicines they want to make
[2:02:34.520 --> 2:02:39.520]  that prescription and gouge you for it they don't want you to be able to get
[2:02:39.520 --> 2:02:42.880]  raw organic vitamins that actually come from the original source not these
[2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:49.040]  chemicalized synthetic vitamins that are so toxic on the body and we'll also
[2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:52.160]  stubblebine can also get into the martial law depopulation plan he was the
[2:02:52.160 --> 2:02:55.280]  former head of army intelligence the former head of special forces command
[2:02:55.280 --> 2:02:59.240]  and then involved in some of the most top-secret operations but he won't talk
[2:02:59.240 --> 2:03:05.920]  about most of those ever he is a what a three-star general so general stubblebine
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:15.360]  is coming up with his wife dr. LaBeau in the next hour stay with us
[2:03:15.360 --> 2:03:19.560]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[2:03:19.560 --> 2:03:22.840]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:26.400]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:29.680]  red line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:33.520]  dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:37.040]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:40.680]  for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned
[2:03:40.680 --> 2:03:44.960]  off the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:49.000]  out of thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:52.800]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[2:03:52.800 --> 2:03:56.840]  nothing and blast the cost of the sessions particularly food beyond many
[2:03:56.840 --> 2:04:01.040]  Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of
[2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:05.320]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food
[2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:09.040]  prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[2:04:09.040 --> 2:04:12.760]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:16.360]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[2:04:16.360 --> 2:04:20.520]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[2:04:20.520 --> 2:04:24.040]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of
[2:04:24.040 --> 2:04:27.840]  Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my
[2:04:27.840 --> 2:04:32.040]  friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for
[2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:35.000]  everybody out there listening it's very important for you understand that by
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:38.200]  having a supply of storeable food the government the new old order has a lot
[2:04:38.200 --> 2:04:41.760]  less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[2:04:41.760 --> 2:04:45.480]  and preparedness no one is gonna take care of your family in the final
[2:04:45.480 --> 2:04:48.880]  equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship

[2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:31.680]  radio network
[2:05:40.360 --> 2:05:45.680]  for the next hour Lindsay Williams, Pastor Lindsay Williams, author Dr. Colmaker
[2:05:45.680 --> 2:05:53.360]  he doesn't really need an introduction but just briefly he worked and was in on
[2:05:53.360 --> 2:05:56.520]  the board meetings for three years of Atlantic Richfield and then on other
[2:05:56.520 --> 2:06:00.520]  major board meetings with the large oil companies as they found one of the
[2:06:00.520 --> 2:06:05.760]  largest deposits of oil in the world with as much oil or more discoverable
[2:06:05.760 --> 2:06:10.280]  and and retrievable very easily just on the north slope of Alaska as there is in
[2:06:10.280 --> 2:06:15.920]  Saudi Arabia and decades after he broke all this news it's now admitted that the
[2:06:15.920 --> 2:06:20.720]  oil's up there and they only allow about 20% of what is brought out a small
[2:06:20.720 --> 2:06:27.760]  portion of the oil that's brought out to go to the United States West Coast most
[2:06:27.760 --> 2:06:32.280]  of it goes to China and of course Japan but that's not the main reason he's
[2:06:32.280 --> 2:06:36.200]  joining us right now about four months ago three and a half months ago he told
[2:06:36.200 --> 2:06:45.280]  Dr. Stan Monteev that one of the former CEOs called him when his video one of
[2:06:45.280 --> 2:06:49.680]  his videos been number one on Google video for months off and on in the top
[2:06:49.680 --> 2:06:54.320]  five or so but routinely in the number one slot hundreds of thousands of views
[2:06:54.320 --> 2:07:03.400]  a day and it became a big issue that the oil companies were suppressing the oil
[2:07:03.400 --> 2:07:09.120]  output out of the United States of course just a year and a half ago Bush
[2:07:09.120 --> 2:07:12.340]  gave thousands of square miles people get mad at Jimmy Carter giving away the
[2:07:12.340 --> 2:07:16.640]  Panama Canal and then Clinton finalizing that in 2000 and it is treason
[2:07:16.640 --> 2:07:24.600]  well it's all part of the policy China was given large part of the US oil
[2:07:24.600 --> 2:07:29.320]  shelf in our territorial waters you look that up if you want to explore it for
[2:07:29.320 --> 2:07:33.960]  Cuba so just unbelievably outrageous and the first thing Bush did when he got
[2:07:33.960 --> 2:07:37.920]  novice was give thousands of other square miles of the US territorial waters
[2:07:37.920 --> 2:07:44.760]  to Mexico to drill for Pemex it's a cartel they control and manipulate the
[2:07:44.760 --> 2:07:51.040]  world oil supply but this executive told him basically you're not going to be

[2:07:59.520 --> 2:08:03.440]  reserves how it's all rigged just like the diamond market is rigged for
[2:08:03.440 --> 2:08:07.040]  artificial scarcity he said well what can I talk about he said well I think
[2:08:07.040 --> 2:08:10.880]  you ought to get out of the country you ought to leave and that's a good idea

[2:10:07.360 --> 2:10:12.920]  to stay there our first prediction crude oil is going to stay below fifty
[2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:16.680]  dollars a barrel it may fluctuate slightly and you said that here a week
[2:10:16.680 --> 2:10:20.360]  and a half ago by the way I'm sure you know OPEC in Reuters yesterday said
[2:10:20.360 --> 2:10:24.360]  that oil will stay at fifty dollars a barrel at least for most of next year
[2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:28.280]  go ahead that's exactly right and it's going to stay a dollar and fifty cents
[2:10:28.280 --> 2:10:34.080]  a gallon to gas pump enjoy it enjoy every minute of it go to take that long

[2:10:47.680 --> 2:10:52.720]  months maximum one year from now you are going to look back on what you're
[2:10:52.720 --> 2:10:56.000]  hearing today on the Alex Jones show and all the other things that you hear
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:01.120]  Alex say folks there positively is a group of people on the face of the earth
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:05.000]  who control the world and one of these individuals who knows everything that
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:09.600]  goes on behind closed doors told me what's going to take place okay here we
[2:11:09.600 --> 2:11:16.480]  go first of all Saudi Arabia Arab world what's happening they were accustomed
[2:11:16.480 --> 2:11:25.280]  to $150 a barrel crude oil now it has gone down to $48.78 last week what's
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:29.880]  this going to do to them they've lost two-thirds of their value of what they're
[2:11:29.880 --> 2:11:35.120]  getting Saudi Arabia now according to the Dow Jones News wires says 90% of their
[2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:42.040]  expert stem from oil is salt and they must maintain the price at $80 per
[2:11:42.040 --> 2:11:45.960]  barrel they said the kingdom has obligate terms of more than $400 billion
[2:11:45.960 --> 2:11:51.680]  dollars in defense energy security and infrastructure now that they are in
[2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:56.880]  drastic trouble I know you laughed at me six months ago whenever I said for the
[2:11:56.880 --> 2:12:01.160]  first time on Alex Jones show I believe it was back in July 28th I had the
[2:12:01.160 --> 2:12:05.440]  privilege of being on the show for the first time $140 a barrel at that time
[2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:10.040]  people laughed at me when they said it was going to $50 a barrel and I said
[2:12:10.040 --> 2:12:14.200]  it's not me saying this it's this individual who called me and said this
[2:12:14.200 --> 2:12:19.880]  is what's going to happen now as a result of these oil producing countries of the
[2:12:19.880 --> 2:12:24.920]  world not being able to even support their own economies Saudi Arabia must
[2:12:24.920 --> 2:12:29.840]  have $80 a barrel even to support what they have in the way of projects going
[2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:32.920]  on right now and this comes at a time when the Arabs have been tricked to
[2:12:32.920 --> 2:12:36.640]  invest in all these derivatives and the stock markets and the stock market down
[2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:41.920]  by more than half at a time when they're in a cash crunch as well so what's
[2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:46.720]  going to happen they can't okay America has a $12 trillion national debt now
[2:12:46.720 --> 2:12:51.440]  that's what they admit to $12 trillion national debt someone must buy the
[2:12:51.440 --> 2:12:56.080]  interest on that debt in order to be able to even maintain the currency of
[2:12:56.080 --> 2:13:01.840]  the United States of America these oil producing countries cannot now buy our
[2:13:01.840 --> 2:13:07.200]  treasury issues our t-bills our Federal Reserve notes and issues that they
[2:13:07.200 --> 2:13:11.960]  issue from time to time which pays the interest on the national debt now you
[2:13:11.960 --> 2:13:15.080]  have a good time right now with the dollar and fifty cents a gallon back on
[2:13:15.080 --> 2:13:20.080]  the east coast enjoy it every second of it because this was planned you say oh
[2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:24.920]  hallelujah this is wonderful we've got gasoline down to a dollar and fifty
[2:13:24.920 --> 2:13:28.960]  cents a barrel the thing is you don't know the rest of the story why did they
[2:13:28.960 --> 2:13:34.240]  do this they did it for the purpose all right here are these all producing
[2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:40.480]  countries they they no longer have the money to be able to buy our treasury
[2:13:40.480 --> 2:13:44.600]  notes all federal reserve issues that paid the interest on the national debt
[2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:49.760]  and watch it six month this is a prediction now six months nine months
[2:13:49.760 --> 2:13:54.360]  maximum one year from now the American dollar is going to be all but
[2:13:54.360 --> 2:13:59.760]  worthless you are going to pay for you say well dollar fifty cents a gallon the
[2:13:59.760 --> 2:14:05.040]  economy is going to pick up well it hasn't so far stock markets down 400
[2:14:05.040 --> 2:14:09.720]  points this morning plus and you say well what's going to happen isn't it
[2:14:09.720 --> 2:14:14.320]  going to get better well for six nine twelve months from now when the interest
[2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:18.160]  on the national debt is not paid to the point that the countries of the world
[2:14:18.160 --> 2:14:21.600]  say the American dollar is no longer the reserve currency we're going to cash
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:27.360]  in throw it to the wind get rid of it every way we can watch it and in six
[2:14:27.360 --> 2:14:31.800]  months nine months twelve months you are going to see a total collapse of the
[2:14:31.800 --> 2:14:36.560]  financial system in America and this individual who called me the middle of
[2:14:36.560 --> 2:14:41.440]  June said I'm going to quote word for word what he said he said America will
[2:14:41.440 --> 2:14:47.040]  see a financial collapse that will be so great that it will take years to come
[2:14:47.040 --> 2:14:50.640]  out of it now may I tell you what's going to happen yeah I mean I actually
[2:14:50.640 --> 2:14:56.720]  literally this time on your show Alex I want to tell your audience what is going
[2:14:56.720 --> 2:15:01.280]  to take place because these oil producing countries do not purchase the
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:05.520]  interest on our national debt and the chickens that come home to roost you
[2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:10.520]  will pay the piper six months nine months twelve months from now and here's
[2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:14.480]  what's going to happen I'm going to give it to you just an obstinacy to here it
[2:15:14.480 --> 2:15:20.600]  is three months ago the country of Iceland declared bankruptcy here it is
[2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:25.000]  right now this is what happened to them after three months America is headed
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:30.240]  right toward that I say identical same scenario of bankruptcy and you're going
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:33.880]  to see the same thing happen in America well let me get a caveat and then you
[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:39.000]  can continue and we appreciate you land the south Lindsay Williams Iceland two
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:42.800]  and a half three months ago had a financial crisis and then Gordon Brown
[2:15:42.800 --> 2:15:47.720]  using anti-terror laws and if you don't know folks just Google that anti-terror
[2:15:47.720 --> 2:15:51.920]  laws Gordon Brown Iceland it's all over the British newspapers and Icelandic
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:58.040]  papers said under terrorism clauses we're not going to let Icelanders have
[2:15:58.040 --> 2:16:04.120]  their money out of British banks that dominate Iceland so they wouldn't give
[2:16:04.120 --> 2:16:09.080]  the people their money back and and it's the same thing by imploding the oil
[2:16:09.080 --> 2:16:15.480]  market as you said then foreigners can't buy the debt that will accelerate the
[2:16:15.480 --> 2:16:20.480]  collapse so they can then set up this new global banking order that they are
[2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:24.200]  calling in hundreds of newspapers a world government of and by the banks

[2:22:03.960 --> 2:22:08.280]  totally agree with what you're saying and how this is unfolding i mean even
[2:22:08.280 --> 2:22:13.280]  before you went public i saw in their own plans that they want to create a
[2:22:13.280 --> 2:22:22.680]  depression in the real economy and then bring hyperinflation after that and
[2:22:22.680 --> 2:22:25.640]  that's certainly what we see happening now so this is all planned out they've
[2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:28.680]  done this in hundreds of third world countries and now first world countries
[2:22:28.680 --> 2:22:35.560]  but the breakdown again what this former CEO of a major oil company who you
[2:22:35.560 --> 2:22:41.720]  worked with for many years told you and then how this is going to unfold you're
[2:22:41.720 --> 2:22:47.480]  saying within the next 12 months that the dollar will be devalued hyperinflation
[2:22:47.480 --> 2:22:53.200]  will be publicly you know viewable at the same time we'll have a depression in
[2:22:53.200 --> 2:22:59.960]  the real economy the double whammy we right now have deflation to go to any
[2:22:59.960 --> 2:23:02.960]  store you'd like to at this christmas time and you're going to find prices of
[2:23:02.960 --> 2:23:07.280]  down down down down a dollar and fifty cents a gallon of the gas pump enjoy
[2:23:07.280 --> 2:23:11.840]  every second of it it's going to stay that way did you hear me i said it's
[2:23:11.840 --> 2:23:16.640]  going to stay a dollar and fifty cents a gallon of the gas pump fifty dollars a
[2:23:16.640 --> 2:23:22.400]  barrel for crude oil then you are going to see the results of this it's going to
[2:23:22.400 --> 2:23:26.880]  take six nine months maybe a year for it to take place this individual said to me
[2:23:26.880 --> 2:23:31.120]  America will see a financial collapse that will be so great that it will take
[2:23:31.120 --> 2:23:35.000]  years for it to come out of it but if someone said to me the other day how
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:40.920]  could we possibly have a chaotic problem in america whenever the price of crude
[2:23:40.920 --> 2:23:44.560]  oil which is a foundation and base of everything to standard currency the
[2:23:44.560 --> 2:23:49.600]  world is crude oil how could we possibly see things deteriorate any further when
[2:23:49.600 --> 2:23:53.120]  the price of gasoline has gone down to a dollar and fifty cents a gallon what the
[2:23:53.120 --> 2:23:57.520]  purpose for taking it to fifty dollars a barrel is what the average american
[2:23:57.520 --> 2:24:02.160]  doesn't know if they don't see what's behind the scenes remember people i
[2:24:02.160 --> 2:24:06.400]  lived with the elite of the world for three years by the product of some
[2:24:06.400 --> 2:24:11.360]  god when i had executive status as chaplain on the trends Alaska oil
[2:24:11.360 --> 2:24:16.160]  pipeline sat in that board meetings heard what they had to say believe me the
[2:24:16.160 --> 2:24:21.640]  price was not taken to fifty dollars a barrel out of a favor to you a dollar
[2:24:21.640 --> 2:24:25.960]  and fifty cents a gallon of gasoline was not done for that's an assault on the
[2:24:25.960 --> 2:24:29.400]  real that's an assault on the real economy just like the banks have plenty
[2:24:29.400 --> 2:24:32.920]  of liquidity they created the bubble they shut off the blood supply of the
[2:24:32.920 --> 2:24:37.000]  economy to implode it so they can buy it up that much cheaper this is all done
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:40.880]  with precision every bit of it they knew exactly what they were doing it is not
[2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:45.520]  a conspiracy it is an agenda on the part of all these people that Alex has been
[2:24:45.520 --> 2:24:50.160]  telling you about for years folks listen to every word Alex Jones says he's
[2:24:50.160 --> 2:24:55.480]  trying to tell you the truth it's just that as i often times remark i would have
[2:24:55.480 --> 2:24:59.840]  a difficult time believing my own story five not live that are exactly we are
[2:24:59.840 --> 2:25:04.320]  beginning to see the crack nineteen and twenty nine was a crash of the stock
[2:25:04.320 --> 2:25:08.600]  market it was nineteen and thirty three before there were soup lines on the
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:14.040]  streets in new york city we're right now are in that grace period where they
[2:25:14.040 --> 2:25:18.000]  were then listen to it here's a casualty count yeah this is the collapse and i
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  want you to go there but the key here it was prasada nong rada you would never
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:26.280]  be invited back on financial TV shows we use the depression word but six weeks
[2:25:26.280 --> 2:25:31.040]  ago the president paulson bernack he all of them started using that word knowing
[2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:36.000]  it would destroy confidence and now on every show fox business cnbc all of it
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:39.880]  that's all they talk about his depression while at the same time putting out
[2:25:39.880 --> 2:25:44.200]  other propaganda saying go out buy buy shop get in more debt so they are trying
[2:25:44.200 --> 2:25:48.720]  to create a depression go ahead yes they exactly are and and by all those things
[2:25:48.720 --> 2:25:53.120]  right now while they're cheap and you say well oh my goodness i'll have plenty
[2:25:53.120 --> 2:25:57.720]  of money six months nine months twelve months from now to be able to buy that
[2:25:57.720 --> 2:26:02.120]  gasoline at a dollar fifty cents a gallon with yeah you will you may have the
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:06.480]  money but what's the purchasing power of that money going to be whenever the
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:11.080]  dollar collapses and it takes a wheelbarrow loaded of dollars to go to the
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:15.120]  grocery store to buy a loaf of bread now the crack has just begun listen to this
[2:26:15.120 --> 2:26:19.720]  the securities and exchange commission must be notified whenever stores are

[2:34:02.240 --> 2:34:06.160]  kind of tired today folks I was up real late last night working
[2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:10.960]  and I spent so many hours studying all the martial law documents in the 400
[2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:14.400]  page battle plan put out by the Pentagon and the 50
[2:34:14.400 --> 2:34:18.560]  page directive by secretary Gates and I spent
[2:34:18.560 --> 2:34:21.520]  hours last night writing all these notes and having all these things I wanted
[2:34:21.520 --> 2:34:24.720]  to talk about and then I get on air and it's like how do I even get into all
[2:34:24.720 --> 2:34:30.560]  this it's so horrible too I don't even want to say I'm depressed I'm more
[2:34:30.560 --> 2:34:34.160]  I just feel smashed I don't even know how to describe it
[2:34:34.160 --> 2:34:37.280]  by the way I'm on coast to coast AM this evening so no rest
[2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:40.800]  for us going back to Lindsay Williams and Lindsay we've got to get to the calls

[2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:57.600]  and I normally am as well but I can't really describe the place I'm in it
[2:34:57.600 --> 2:35:02.160]  it's more of a sadness because I live here in this country my heritage is here
[2:35:02.160 --> 2:35:06.480]  for I mean I had family on the Mayflower and family in the
[2:35:06.480 --> 2:35:10.160]  civil war the revolutionary war the you know the
[2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:14.400]  Texas independence and I just love America and to see us turn into a
[2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:18.320]  wicked nation of 50 million dead babies and all the corruption and the evil and
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:22.640]  to know what's coming I just think about my children and it shakes me in my very
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:28.640]  core Lindsay can you can you comment uh to to to how to make it through this
[2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:33.360]  yes Alex for 50 years time I have been a minister to the gospel I'm not a young

[2:35:45.520 --> 2:35:50.480]  uh because if you take action right now and do something about it
[2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:55.040]  you can spare your dinner table let me assure you it positively can happen
[2:35:55.040 --> 2:35:59.360]  and I honestly believe Alex and let this be encouragement to you
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:03.520]  I honestly believe it was the providence of God that sent this gentleman to call
[2:36:03.520 --> 2:36:07.440]  me to threaten me you know threats oftentimes become blessings
[2:36:07.440 --> 2:36:11.200]  and when he called me the middle of june and threatened me I agreed to what he
[2:36:11.200 --> 2:36:15.040]  said and then I don't think he intended to do it at all
[2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:19.200]  but because of his respect for me as a chaplain on the transfer oil pipeline
[2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:23.200]  he was going to tell me all of these things and I think he told him to me
[2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:27.120]  because it was God's providence that I'd be able to get out here and kill it to
[2:36:27.120 --> 2:36:31.360]  the entire world and I feel so honored today to be on the
[2:36:31.360 --> 2:36:36.880]  Alex Jones show to let you know there is hope for you if you will take action
[2:36:36.880 --> 2:36:40.720]  right now decide what kind of lifestyle you're willing to live
[2:36:40.720 --> 2:36:44.240]  whenever these people do what they're going to do with our economy
[2:36:44.240 --> 2:36:48.000]  in a few months from now and if you will take advantage
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:51.840]  of what you have before you right now in the way of a dollar fifty cents a gallon
[2:36:51.840 --> 2:36:55.040]  gasoline and the way of deflation at christmas time
[2:36:55.040 --> 2:36:59.920]  and if you'll take advantage of knowing these facts and the truth
[2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:07.840]  you can do something about it so Alan Alex be encouraged
[2:37:07.840 --> 2:37:11.840]  yeah I know it looks discouraging for the future for our children
[2:37:11.840 --> 2:37:16.000]  but I want you to be encouraged right now in knowing you know the issues
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:20.480]  and as the bible says ye shall know the truth and the truth will set you free
[2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:26.080]  and the scriptures are always right set that spiritual house in order right now
[2:37:26.080 --> 2:37:30.000]  make sure that you on the solid rock of christ Jesus
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:36.320]  know positively that your household is on a solid rock and not on sinking sand
[2:37:36.320 --> 2:37:41.360]  and with these things in mind you will be able to stand regardless of what comes
[2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:43.360]  out well you're right pastor I mean I do take
[2:37:43.360 --> 2:37:47.920]  heart that we are here warning people but I also get frustrated wishing we could
[2:37:47.920 --> 2:37:51.600]  reach more people and no matter how many things we talk about that come true no
[2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:55.440]  matter how many times were right still the majority of people
[2:37:55.440 --> 2:37:59.280]  are inactive or laugh at us and I I don't even hate them
[2:37:59.280 --> 2:38:02.640]  and I don't take pleasure in them being stupid I'm upset
[2:38:02.640 --> 2:38:06.400]  I want to I mean I'm we're only telling the truth I only want to help people I
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:10.080]  know you want to help people and I just don't know how this country got so
[2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:14.800]  evil pastor well yes but people are waking up Alex
[2:38:14.800 --> 2:38:19.200]  they're waking up in mass and I have never had so many people tell me
[2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:22.880]  people that didn't even know the issues six months a year ago when they saw
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:26.720]  crude oil go to $50 a barrel and when you
[2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:30.480]  allow me on your show to tell the fact it was going to happen that way and they
[2:38:30.480 --> 2:38:34.160]  saw it happen now they're beginning to listen to the rest of our message also
[2:38:34.160 --> 2:38:38.320]  well you know I know some folks two separate successful businessman
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:42.640]  who trusted you trusted me and uh you know trusted that you were given this
[2:38:42.640 --> 2:38:47.920]  information and that and that sold short on on oil
[2:38:47.920 --> 2:38:51.760]  one of them made 200 and I think he said $80,000 and the other made about a
[2:38:51.760 --> 2:38:54.880]  hundred thousand dollars just on moderate you know
[2:38:54.880 --> 2:39:00.800]  very small uh investment selling short and and and I mean I didn't do that
[2:39:00.800 --> 2:39:03.200]  because I don't I'm not involved in the stock market don't have time to mess
[2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:06.400]  with it uh but this is this is powerful info
[2:39:06.400 --> 2:39:09.920]  Lindsay I want to get to the phone calls then before you leave us we'll finish
[2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:13.360]  up with where you think or where your source said all this was going and then
[2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:15.680]  I have another question for you but let's go ahead and get to the calls
[2:39:15.680 --> 2:39:19.600]  right now is that okay yes please do okay John in Illinois thanks for
[2:39:19.600 --> 2:39:21.920]  holding her on the air with Lindsay Williams
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:26.160]  yes it's an honor to speak with you uh pastor Williams um
[2:39:26.160 --> 2:39:30.880]  I listen regularly to financial sense online with Jim Poplava and your name
[2:39:30.880 --> 2:39:36.080]  occasionally comes up with uh callers calling in questions about uh
[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:40.720]  your work that showed that there really is an energy non-crisis
[2:39:40.720 --> 2:39:44.960]  and uh the other and uh the other days a caller brought up the fact that you
[2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:51.280]  had made the prediction of $50 oil and Jim Poplava who has poo pooed your
[2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:57.520]  your work in the past had to tip his hat to you and said you made a great call
[2:39:57.520 --> 2:40:02.240]  you ever heard of it Poplava yes I know what you're talking about you see we
[2:40:02.240 --> 2:40:06.480]  have all been predicting $200 a barrel oil I'll admit to you
[2:40:06.480 --> 2:40:09.440]  nine months ago I was seeing on radio shows
[2:40:09.440 --> 2:40:15.680]  $200 a barrel oil until I had a phone call from a man that knows everything
[2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:19.920]  that goes on behind closed doors and I'll have to admit to you this was not
[2:40:19.920 --> 2:40:23.440]  the knowledge of Lindsay Williams it came directly
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:27.600]  from a man who knows everything that goes on and he said
[2:40:27.600 --> 2:40:32.960]  it's going to $50 a barrel Alex dared to let me stick my neck out on his show
[2:40:32.960 --> 2:40:37.040]  and give the prediction as that man gave it I can't take credit for it so
[2:40:37.040 --> 2:40:41.600]  all I'll say is everything else this man said is also coming to pass just like
[2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:47.200]  he said $50 a barrel okay what other thing Alex yes sir
[2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:51.200]  okay do not get discouraged as we see in Iceland
[2:40:51.200 --> 2:40:56.240]  once everybody's oxen are gored that will motivate them
[2:40:56.240 --> 2:41:00.160]  now we're having another end of fed march in April
[2:41:00.160 --> 2:41:03.600]  and as a matter of fact we're going to be having one I believe every couple of
[2:41:03.600 --> 2:41:07.680]  months and I predict as the economy worsens
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:12.320]  our numbers are going to grow and grow and grow
[2:41:12.320 --> 2:41:16.640]  absolutely we got a lot of media attention and there were 38 locations
[2:41:16.640 --> 2:41:20.800]  250 or so in Dallas 250 or so in
[2:41:20.800 --> 2:41:24.160]  Illinois most other places had 200 150 in
[2:41:24.160 --> 2:41:27.280]  oh kansas city had about 300 I've seen a video
[2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:30.880]  and I mean overall that's about 6 000 if you added up about
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:36.880]  conservatively 6 000 people that demonstrated in 38 locations and then
[2:41:36.880 --> 2:41:40.320]  they put it on youtube and google the point is 10 years ago you wouldn't
[2:41:40.320 --> 2:41:44.720]  have one person out of every fed location so we're identifying the enemy
[2:41:44.720 --> 2:41:48.320]  we're identifying the culprits we're identifying the international bankers
[2:41:48.320 --> 2:41:51.040]  that are engineering all this and I agree it's just going to get bigger and
[2:41:51.040 --> 2:41:54.800]  bigger and god bless you john uh... james and mass you're on the air with
[2:41:54.800 --> 2:41:56.960]  pastor lindsay williams welcome
[2:41:56.960 --> 2:42:01.440]  uh... yeah greetings from the people's socialist republic here ilex uh...

[2:42:09.120 --> 2:42:11.920]  uh... make a couple points and get off uh...
[2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:15.280]  i uh... get around the topics boards uh... now and then uh...
[2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:18.720]  i try to raise a little awareness about what's going on and uh...
[2:42:18.720 --> 2:42:22.000]  i find a lot of denial a lot of denial
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:26.960]  and uh... i find it as frustrating as you do but i keep trying
[2:42:26.960 --> 2:42:30.560]  uh... well i mean i said for over a decade that they were gonna
[2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:34.080]  set up a federal security force get rid of the national guard put troops on the
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:38.240]  streets of every u.s city and guess what it's all happening
[2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:41.760]  and it's not because i'm smart i mean i think lindsay smart
[2:42:41.760 --> 2:42:46.000]  and i'm not stupid but you know lindsay was told this by the former ceo of one
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.960]  of the biggest oil companies that he worked with so lindsay knew he could
[2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:52.800]  bank on it i mean i'm going off pentagon battle plans
[2:42:52.800 --> 2:42:56.800]  and i'm only telling people what is publicly admitted
[2:42:56.800 --> 2:43:00.720]  and giving them the sources and yes i know
[2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:03.680]  uh... but listen a lot of those people aren't in denial their government
[2:43:03.680 --> 2:43:08.240]  operatives they put in billions of dollars a year in the u.s just
[2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:13.920]  to fake bloggers on the web sir yeah i i understand that i uh... i welcome
[2:43:13.920 --> 2:43:18.080]  crossroads that i suspect but uh... well i mean you'll see the same guys

[2:43:21.120 --> 2:43:25.120]  hundreds of pages a day the same message they're doing cut and paste cut and
[2:43:25.120 --> 2:43:28.080]  paste and you know what i just feel sorry for them to
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:30.560]  i mean they're literally shooting themselves in the feet i mean they have
[2:43:30.560 --> 2:43:34.560]  no idea who they're working for or what they're doing go ahead
[2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:37.680]  uh... that is pretty much it uh... i want to thank uh...
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:42.160]  uh... reverend williams there for uh... for his work uh... i i really really
[2:43:42.160 --> 2:43:45.600]  appreciate uh... what you've been doing i've been watching the price of crude
[2:43:45.600 --> 2:43:48.960]  comes spiraling down and i said oh my god he's right
[2:43:48.960 --> 2:43:52.640]  uh... and that that that's about uh... the extent of my uh... my call thank you
[2:43:52.640 --> 2:43:56.240]  god bless you both thank you god bless you i saw i want to go back to what he
[2:43:56.240 --> 2:43:59.200]  just said about crude oil please believe me
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:02.400]  this was not something that i knew because of lindsay williams
[2:44:02.400 --> 2:44:05.200]  this was uh... i could put on my bridge is just like you do every morning i'm
[2:44:05.200 --> 2:44:09.280]  just ordinary everyday person it's just that by the grace of god
[2:44:09.280 --> 2:44:12.720]  i had the privilege of knowing a few of these people every now and then they
[2:44:12.720 --> 2:44:16.080]  tell me something it is going to stay at fifty dollars a barrel
[2:44:16.080 --> 2:44:19.280]  a dollar and fifty cents a gallon of gas bought the rest of the things are going
[2:44:19.280 --> 2:44:23.280]  to take place too and so let's take advantage of what you're seeing right
[2:44:23.280 --> 2:44:26.640]  now while you can and do well as he told you fifty
[2:44:26.640 --> 2:44:32.480]  um... i need to google it but i think it was a f p yesterday had the headline
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:36.880]  twenty dollar a barrel oil well i know it's going to stay below fifty
[2:44:36.880 --> 2:44:40.400]  at that i had positively have his word that it's going to stay there
[2:44:40.400 --> 2:44:43.520]  they may go down a little bit they may come back up they're going to prove to
[2:44:43.520 --> 2:44:46.480]  the arabs the fact that opaque positively
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:50.240]  does not control the arc oil market and they'll leave it there
[2:44:50.240 --> 2:44:54.640]  until they rub their nose in the sand i had a phone i i i i shouldn't even say
[2:44:54.640 --> 2:44:58.240]  this but i'll do it anyway i had a contact last week from saudi arabia
[2:44:58.240 --> 2:45:01.440]  i wrote him a very personal letter back it's going to be interesting to see
[2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:05.040]  what kind of reply i get if i live i think they're listening to your show
[2:45:05.040 --> 2:45:08.080]  alex but uh... honestly they're beginning to get
[2:45:08.080 --> 2:45:10.960]  the message that they don't have any control over the price of food or
[2:45:10.960 --> 2:45:14.000]  whatsoever this won't stay down here long enough to bankrupt them
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:18.640]  and i think they're scared to death you're absolutely right
[2:45:18.640 --> 2:45:24.160]  um... it's all engineered to i mean they admit it's engineered
[2:45:24.160 --> 2:45:28.240]  and the public of this is according to a plan
[2:45:28.240 --> 2:45:32.880]  it's according to an agenda please let me stress this over and over again
[2:45:32.880 --> 2:45:36.640]  this is not a conspiracy it is an agenda
[2:45:36.640 --> 2:45:40.800]  they knew you and plan this month in advance i was told six months before
[2:45:40.800 --> 2:45:44.960]  it happened it was going to take place by a man who knew it was going to happen
[2:45:44.960 --> 2:45:48.480]  alex i feel just like you do we're sitting here
[2:45:48.480 --> 2:45:52.160]  giving things you know it's such an honor to be able to tell america in advance
[2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:57.360]  what's going to happen because it's going to spare so many people
[2:45:57.360 --> 2:46:02.000]  well i mean i would tell folks i only buy what you need
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:07.120]  and and and and you know get ready and understand the crime rate has all is
[2:46:07.120 --> 2:46:10.800]  just exploded be careful it's only going to get worse

[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  broken that is going to be one of the biggest
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:19.520]  security blankets this country has because the criminals know they've got
[2:46:19.520 --> 2:46:23.040]  a good chance at dying in most areas of this country
[2:46:23.040 --> 2:46:27.040]  uh... if they uh... thieve and robin steel and it's not that i care about the
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:30.480]  junk in my house tv sets or computers it's my children

[2:46:47.920 --> 2:46:50.720]  exponentially you can be taken
[2:46:50.720 --> 2:46:54.880]  for people are beginning to wake up as a call us at a moment ago
[2:46:54.880 --> 2:46:58.880]  the harder times get the rougher prices get more closer stores that close

[2:47:04.480 --> 2:47:08.960]  to buy something i needed and
[2:47:08.960 --> 2:47:12.960]  i probably ran into fifteen people and i'd have to say
[2:47:12.960 --> 2:47:17.600]  seven of them so half of them roughly were quote fans of my radio show this
[2:47:17.600 --> 2:47:19.200]  is what happened

[2:58:05.360 --> 2:58:09.520]  good afternoon gentlemen it seems as though uh we're watching uh
[2:58:09.520 --> 2:58:12.240]  a runaway train coming at us in slow motion
[2:58:12.240 --> 2:58:17.280]  i'd like to to to pose three uh quick questions uh in regards to a statement
[2:58:17.280 --> 2:58:20.480]  you made uh last time uh you were on the show
[2:58:20.480 --> 2:58:24.400]  uh you made a statement that they were doing this to bankrupt
[2:58:24.400 --> 2:58:28.400]  the Arabs uh i would like you to elaborate on
[2:58:28.400 --> 2:58:35.360]  who they are and uh possibly speak to why wouldn't the opec
[2:58:35.360 --> 2:58:40.000]  nations band together and control the supply of oil
[2:58:40.000 --> 2:58:45.600]  to raise the price of it or to prevent because they can't it's a cartel because
[2:58:45.600 --> 2:58:50.000]  we have plenty of oil here because they've got it all capped off basically
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:53.280]  because they're not the only controllers of the oil lindsay
[2:58:53.280 --> 2:58:56.400]  well peck has nothing to do with the price of a barrel of oil
[2:58:56.400 --> 2:59:00.480]  uh they just think they do it's in the city of london every day
[2:59:00.480 --> 2:59:03.600]  yeah the elite bring them into line every now and then and slap their hands to
[2:59:03.600 --> 2:59:06.320]  let them know that they have no control over it whatsoever
[2:59:06.320 --> 2:59:10.800]  now i know the your first question and i appreciate it i would love to answer it
[2:59:10.800 --> 2:59:13.200]  the very first thing that people want to know
[2:59:13.200 --> 2:59:16.640]  and expect me to say whenever they ask who are the elite
[2:59:16.640 --> 2:59:20.080]  they want me to get ethnic i'm not going to do that and i'll tell you why
[2:59:20.080 --> 2:59:23.840]  i'll live with these people for three years i know who they are and what ethnic
[2:59:23.840 --> 2:59:27.440]  groups they may be a part of they are not of any one protect
[2:59:27.440 --> 2:59:31.760]  particular ethnic group and at this point i must say
[2:59:31.760 --> 2:59:35.920]  these people if you want to know who they are go to the heads of the world bank
[2:59:35.920 --> 2:59:39.360]  and the imf and you basically will know who most of these people are
[2:59:39.360 --> 2:59:43.120]  along with dad bush and a few others who are at the very top of the list
[2:59:43.120 --> 2:59:46.640]  and you start out with about a dozen people and you wind up with hundreds
[2:59:46.640 --> 2:59:49.600]  and the council of foreign relations and the trial hour commission
[2:59:49.600 --> 2:59:52.720]  each one knowing less than the person down the line
[2:59:52.720 --> 2:59:57.360]  uh new at the very top and that basically is who these people are
[2:59:57.360 --> 3:00:00.960]  now you'd be surprised even high up people are compartmentalized and don't
[3:00:00.960 --> 3:00:04.720]  even know what we know because we're generalists who study the enemy
[3:00:04.720 --> 3:00:08.800]  operations read all their white papers you know uh talk to experts from
[3:00:08.800 --> 3:00:12.880]  different factions the enemy operates off of compartmentalization
[3:00:12.880 --> 3:00:17.280]  that's why there's symbols the pyramid the the ultimate symbol of compartmentalization
[3:00:17.280 --> 3:00:21.440]  correct pastor yes that's correct
[3:00:22.560 --> 3:00:28.560]  anything else sir uh i uh i would like you to speak to the people and i hope
[3:00:28.560 --> 3:00:31.680]  you don't take personal offense to the sir the people that would say
[3:00:31.680 --> 3:00:36.160]  uh this guy's just trying to sell dvds or uh trying to get people to subscribe
[3:00:36.160 --> 3:00:40.480]  to his list uh well listen we're out of time i gotta let you go because the
[3:00:40.480 --> 3:00:44.000]  show's over with lindsay williams right here but i'm gonna say this
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:46.560]  you know i said that they would announce that we're gonna have trips on the
[3:00:46.560 --> 3:00:49.760]  streets of america and it's happening now but instead it's all about well why
[3:00:49.760 --> 3:00:54.880]  does alex don't say that i'm right deal with the issue and of course we
[3:00:54.880 --> 3:00:59.200]  got to sell dvds of course he's saying make copies of them
[3:00:59.200 --> 3:01:01.920]  but of course we've got to be able to operate how do you think we pay for
[3:01:01.920 --> 3:01:04.720]  equipment how do you think lindsay is able to do this
[3:01:04.720 --> 3:01:07.680]  okay but frankly he's retired doesn't even need it that's why he says get it
[3:01:07.680 --> 3:01:11.440]  and make copies it's a red herring we're not the ones doing this to the
[3:01:11.440 --> 3:01:13.920]  economy lindsay williams and alex jones aren't the
[3:01:13.920 --> 3:01:18.160]  new world order we're here warning you but you've been trained and conditioned
[3:01:18.160 --> 3:01:22.560]  since being a child to never be able to focus in on real issues to always kill
[3:01:22.560 --> 3:01:27.360]  the messenger or divert off with a psychological distraction and its mass
[3:01:27.360 --> 3:01:30.880]  mental illness and i wanted to get the more calls but we are just flat out of
[3:01:30.880 --> 3:01:34.400]  time but i will get to a gene and jeff and john and others with major stubble
[3:01:34.400 --> 3:01:36.640]  bind because he'll be able to speak to these issues
[3:01:36.640 --> 3:01:41.600]  uh major general stubble bind coming up uh but i want to thank you for coming on
[3:01:41.600 --> 3:01:45.040]  the show with us today lindsay williams
[3:01:45.040 --> 3:01:49.920]  alex thank you for the privilege folks you listen to every word alex jones says
[3:01:49.920 --> 3:01:54.240]  don't you miss one day things are taking place so rapidly they've accelerated
[3:01:54.240 --> 3:01:58.000]  that program so much yeah if you miss 24 offers you're in
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:00.960]  trouble listen to alex every day absolutely word of it
[3:02:00.960 --> 3:02:04.480]  plus you judge a tree by its fruits lindsay williams has always been right
[3:02:04.480 --> 3:02:08.000]  right about how they've got all that oil captive in alaska
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:11.360]  right about how oil was going to go down by a hundred dollars a barrel
[3:02:11.360 --> 3:02:14.720]  right about everything judge a tree by its fruits
[3:02:14.720 --> 3:02:18.880]  good lord i can't excuse me lindsay williams thank you for joining us
[3:02:18.880 --> 3:02:23.760]  thanks alex have a great day you too
[3:02:23.840 --> 3:02:27.520]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[3:02:27.520 --> 3:02:30.320]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:33.920]  we need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to
[3:02:33.920 --> 3:02:37.200]  stand in the bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to
[3:02:37.200 --> 3:02:40.080]  the super dome and beg for femur to take care of your family
[3:02:40.080 --> 3:02:44.000]  in any emergency if you simply prepare our elective representatives wanted a
[3:02:44.000 --> 3:02:46.160]  good old boy bailout for the special interest
[3:02:46.160 --> 3:02:50.080]  so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email
[3:02:50.080 --> 3:02:53.200]  they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least
[3:02:53.200 --> 3:02:56.880]  out of thin air this money now owns the american and european banks
[3:02:56.880 --> 3:03:00.320]  the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life
[3:03:00.320 --> 3:03:04.160]  savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food
[3:03:04.160 --> 3:03:08.080]  beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:11.920]  the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four
[3:03:11.920 --> 3:03:14.880]  billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so
[3:03:14.880 --> 3:03:17.520]  fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight
[3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:20.880]  the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:23.200]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves
[3:03:23.200 --> 3:03:26.480]  the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business
[3:03:26.480 --> 3:03:29.840]  whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready
[3:03:29.840 --> 3:03:33.440]  everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose between
[3:03:33.440 --> 3:03:36.880]  buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it
[3:03:36.880 --> 3:03:39.840]  takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food
[3:03:39.840 --> 3:03:42.720]  for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand
[3:03:42.720 --> 3:03:46.000]  that by having a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:49.280]  lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of
[3:03:49.280 --> 3:03:52.960]  self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family
[3:03:52.960 --> 3:03:56.640]  in the final equation but you you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to
[3:03:56.640 --> 3:03:59.920]  ship storable food that's safe from ecoli salmonella genetic
[3:03:59.920 --> 3:04:03.200]  alteration or chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:07.440]  of last year's grocery prices call 1-800-409-5633

[3:04:29.600 --> 3:04:35.600]  getting storable food he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[3:04:35.600 --> 3:04:40.640]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[3:04:40.640 --> 3:04:44.880]  yeah we had a scheduling issue this happens
[3:04:44.880 --> 3:04:48.800]  so major general stubble by will not be on with us today
[3:04:48.800 --> 3:04:53.200]  we just went live by the way at prisonplanet.tv so we're rescheduling
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:59.120]  he and his accomplished wife dr lebo to
[3:04:59.120 --> 3:05:02.720]  wednesday for a full hour with us because so much is happening
[3:05:02.720 --> 3:05:06.960]  with codex alimentarius but i also wanted to do half the interview about codex
[3:05:06.960 --> 3:05:10.320]  alimentarius that they've been to europe repeatedly to cover the takeover of the
[3:05:10.320 --> 3:05:14.720]  vitamins and minerals and nutrients by this international cartel
[3:05:14.720 --> 3:05:18.480]  creating this monopoly to make you get a prescription for any basic vitamins
[3:05:18.480 --> 3:05:21.520]  but i also want to talk about the population reduction agenda
[3:05:21.520 --> 3:05:26.240]  and get major generals take on that because
[3:05:26.240 --> 3:05:29.200]  you know both of these people together make an incredible interview but we're
[3:05:29.200 --> 3:05:31.360]  honored right now i'm just gonna have wrong for one segment
[3:05:31.360 --> 3:05:35.360]  because we're gonna have them both on with us on wednesday
[3:05:35.360 --> 3:05:45.120]  in the fourth hour dr rima e lebo md just an amazing lady
[3:05:45.120 --> 3:05:49.840]  and rima e lebo md is the medical director of the natural solutions foundation
[3:05:49.840 --> 3:05:52.560]  she's a graduate of albert einstein college of medicine
[3:05:52.560 --> 3:05:56.080]  1970 believes passionately in the right of every american to choose
[3:05:56.080 --> 3:05:59.840]  a personal health path that is free of government and corporate interference
[3:05:59.840 --> 3:06:03.600]  and if i went through the rest of her bio 35 years
[3:06:03.600 --> 3:06:07.120]  standing up to corruption and tyranny that would take the rest of the time we
[3:06:07.120 --> 3:06:10.560]  have here today but again coming up
[3:06:10.560 --> 3:06:15.120]  wednesday we will have her and major general stubble by her husband
[3:06:15.120 --> 3:06:22.160]  on with us for a full hour okay just giving us a teaser of what's currently
[3:06:22.160 --> 3:06:26.800]  happening you got back in the last month but you've been all over the world as
[3:06:26.800 --> 3:06:31.360]  of late from europe literally battling against codex
[3:06:31.360 --> 3:06:33.840]  alimentarius for those that don't know what it is
[3:06:33.840 --> 3:06:37.840]  describe what it is and then break down what we're facing and why it's so
[3:06:37.840 --> 3:06:43.120]  important you bet um codex alimentarius is
[3:06:43.120 --> 3:06:46.560]  not an intestinal parasite although it sounds like it is
[3:06:46.560 --> 3:06:50.640]  it's a un agency and that should already
[3:06:50.640 --> 3:06:56.000]  get your red flags up it's a un agency designed to control the international
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:06:59.680]  trade of food what that means is setting
[3:06:59.680 --> 3:07:03.920]  guidelines and standards and allowing the
[3:07:03.920 --> 3:07:08.400]  international industrializers of the food supply
[3:07:08.400 --> 3:07:11.920]  including the genetic engineering folks monsanto and
[3:07:11.920 --> 3:07:18.320]  bayer and the others to set the rule as to what food needs to be and what it
[3:07:18.320 --> 3:07:22.960]  can't be and under codex what it can't be is wholesome
[3:07:22.960 --> 3:07:28.480]  clean unadulterated and health producing because codex is actually the
[3:07:28.480 --> 3:07:33.680]  creature of the pharmaceutical industry which wants you to have
[3:07:33.680 --> 3:07:40.560]  damaged degraded and non-nutritive food filled with toxins so that you become
[3:07:40.560 --> 3:07:44.880]  ill then codex and the fda it's handmaiden
[3:07:44.880 --> 3:07:48.160]  will make it impossible for you to get
[3:07:48.160 --> 3:07:52.480]  hypotency nutrients so that you can protect or
[3:07:52.480 --> 3:07:56.240]  repair protect yourself from a repair the damage
[3:07:56.240 --> 3:07:59.440]  that that food does to you so what we're talking about
[3:07:59.440 --> 3:08:04.320]  is a food system designed to make everybody on the planet and i do mean
[3:08:04.320 --> 3:08:08.560]  everybody on the planet except of course the controllers
[3:08:08.560 --> 3:08:14.880]  as ill as possible with the highly economically productive diseases that
[3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:19.440]  the pharmaceutical industry makes its amazing profits from cancer
[3:08:19.440 --> 3:08:22.800]  cardiovascular disease stroke diabetics
[3:08:22.800 --> 3:08:26.960]  obesity those are the diseases that the world health organization
[3:08:26.960 --> 3:08:33.760]  defines as the chronic diseases of under nutrition take away the nutrition
[3:08:33.760 --> 3:08:38.480]  get people sick take away natural medicine make profits
[3:08:38.480 --> 3:08:42.640]  then they die and you have depopulated the world of the quote
[3:08:42.640 --> 3:08:48.560]  useless eaters that's codex in a nutshell
[3:08:48.560 --> 3:08:53.120]  uh doctor during the break we may uh well we're going to end it at the end of
[3:08:53.120 --> 3:08:56.240]  this break your phone's got a lot of static on it so we may try to
[3:08:56.240 --> 3:08:59.680]  reconnect but but bottom line when we say that the globalists the
[3:08:59.680 --> 3:09:03.040]  internationalists have weaponized the food supply
[3:09:03.040 --> 3:09:05.760]  we're not joking around about that you're a medical doctor you've been
[3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:09.120]  researching this i know that doing your your own separate
[3:09:09.120 --> 3:09:12.400]  research from mine or others that you and general stubble bind have found
[3:09:12.400 --> 3:09:15.840]  that indeed it is a population reduction plan
[3:09:15.840 --> 3:09:19.280]  and it's all done through compartmentalization and that they are indeed
[3:09:19.280 --> 3:09:22.400]  cornering the world food supply buying up the heirloom siege
[3:09:22.400 --> 3:09:26.320]  while building these doomsday vaults uh that they know they're bringing on an
[3:09:26.320 --> 3:09:30.320]  environmental holocaust uh while in the name of global warming
[3:09:30.320 --> 3:09:33.680]  uh they're bringing in all this regulation and control over the general
[3:09:33.680 --> 3:09:36.960]  public can can you speak to that
[3:09:36.960 --> 3:09:41.520]  well let's talk about just genetically engineered food now most of your listeners
[3:09:41.520 --> 3:09:45.200]  are probably in the united states right now by the way that's not
[3:09:45.200 --> 3:09:48.880]  static that's torrential rain because i'm in panama
[3:09:48.880 --> 3:09:56.320]  setting up a food system education program to teach farmers and non farmers
[3:09:56.320 --> 3:10:00.320]  how to grow clean non genetically modified
[3:10:00.320 --> 3:10:06.800]  wholesome food in as little as a four foot square area if you're not a farmer
[3:10:06.800 --> 3:10:11.280]  or on your farm if you are that's why you hear that tremendous rain
[3:10:11.280 --> 3:10:17.360]  food let's take genetically modified food um 80 to 85 percent of everything
[3:10:17.360 --> 3:10:22.560]  that americans typically eat contains genetically modified food components
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:27.040]  the government of austria uh last week reduced the studies showing that
[3:10:27.040 --> 3:10:33.520]  genetically modified corn the basis of most of our prepared food
[3:10:33.520 --> 3:10:40.640]  causes sterility in laboratory rats now do you really think that's an accident
[3:10:40.640 --> 3:10:46.400]  do you really think that controlling the world food supply as mom santo says
[3:10:46.400 --> 3:10:52.560]  that it will do by 2010 and introducing ubiquitous
[3:10:52.560 --> 3:10:57.600]  foods that cause sterility cancer remember that's profitable
[3:10:57.600 --> 3:11:01.040]  and autoimmune disease again profitable
[3:11:01.040 --> 3:11:05.760]  infertility and death do you really think that's an accident
[3:11:05.760 --> 3:11:11.200]  i don't do you really think the fact that the united states fda
[3:11:11.200 --> 3:11:16.960]  refuses to allow scientific studies and automatically
[3:11:16.960 --> 3:11:21.200]  approved any patent to applicable any any patented
[3:11:21.200 --> 3:11:24.800]  genetically modified food to enter the food chain
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:28.720]  is an accident you really think it's an accident that out of over 200 different
[3:11:28.720 --> 3:11:33.920]  types of plastics 55 60 years ago they chose the only plastic
[3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:37.520]  that leeches estrogen mimicking hormones that also
[3:11:37.520 --> 3:11:41.200]  uh is linked to sterility and and lowered sperm counts
[3:11:41.200 --> 3:11:44.960]  and everywhere in the world where it's used not only are the mammals becoming
[3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:48.720]  sterile but where that water uh you know excreted through
[3:11:48.720 --> 3:11:52.560]  service systems is getting into the water most the frogs and
[3:11:52.560 --> 3:11:57.040]  alligators are being uh born hemaphrodites so again
[3:11:57.040 --> 3:12:01.920]  everything they do targeting reproduction because they're eugenicist
[3:12:01.920 --> 3:12:05.920]  that is correct they are eugenicists they are not food agricultural
[3:12:05.920 --> 3:12:10.560]  uh industrialists they are not uh uh medical
[3:12:10.560 --> 3:12:14.240]  health or illness care system industrialists they are
[3:12:14.240 --> 3:12:18.560]  eugenicists five years ago that would get you branded
[3:12:18.560 --> 3:12:22.560]  as a lunatic today more and more people are realizing
[3:12:22.560 --> 3:12:28.560]  that they are being targeted for eugenics low eugenics or fast eugenics
[3:12:28.560 --> 3:12:33.040]  the royal health organization in 1985 announced
[3:12:33.040 --> 3:12:36.560]  in writing and i have a copy of this document
[3:12:36.560 --> 3:12:40.400]  that the purpose of the supposed smallpox
[3:12:40.400 --> 3:12:44.320]  eradication program that they were carrying out at that point
[3:12:44.320 --> 3:12:48.800]  was to induce sterility without notification
[3:12:48.800 --> 3:12:52.640]  in a in a vast number of african women
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:56.400]  to quote and this is the part that is in black and white
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:13:03.600]  quote eliminate 150 million excess sub-saharan
[3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:08.240]  african well i don't believe any of us as excess
[3:13:08.240 --> 3:13:12.080]  and you must remember the world health organization which is one of the
[3:13:12.080 --> 3:13:15.920]  organizations that runs codex for the united nations
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:21.120]  has just been convicted in the philippines high court that's their supreme court
[3:13:21.120 --> 3:13:28.080]  of involuntarily sterilizing three million or more
[3:13:28.080 --> 3:13:35.280]  filipino women through the use of a uh it's supposed tetanus vaccine
[3:13:35.280 --> 3:13:41.440]  which actually induces sterility what we're talking about is a multi pronged
[3:13:41.440 --> 3:13:46.160]  evil approach to getting rid of us so that they
[3:13:46.160 --> 3:13:50.720]  whoever they are and i know that you've talked a lot about who they are alec
[3:13:50.720 --> 3:13:58.000]  so that they can control the uh non-renewable resources of the planet
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:01.920]  and i have this in fact from the very mouth
[3:14:01.920 --> 3:14:06.000]  of a patient whom i treated because as a physician i treated some interesting
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:10.480]  people this woman is a head of state who told me that she'd been raised to
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:15.120]  believe that it was the way of the world to
[3:14:15.120 --> 3:14:19.760]  eliminate the youth procedures because they were consuming
[3:14:19.760 --> 3:14:24.560]  their natural non-renewable natural resources
[3:14:24.560 --> 3:14:30.240]  their resources resources meaning the resources of the master class and i
[3:14:30.240 --> 3:14:35.360]  said to her did it ever occur to you that perhaps those
[3:14:35.360 --> 3:14:39.200]  non-renewable resources actually belong to the people

[3:16:36.160 --> 3:16:39.600]  that we wanted both of you on but that always makes for a really interesting
[3:16:39.600 --> 3:16:43.440]  interview uh but uh but let's have uh i mean i love how
[3:16:43.440 --> 3:16:46.320]  general stubblebine you'll talk for 10 minutes they'll just chime in with kind
[3:16:46.320 --> 3:16:50.160]  of a synopsis and people always enjoy that combination but i do want to in the
[3:16:50.160 --> 3:16:54.160]  future have you on more often and i'm gonna be making a documentary
[3:16:54.160 --> 3:16:56.880]  like an in-game two or something along those lines
[3:16:56.880 --> 3:17:02.400]  probably uh under a different title uh when are you in the united states because
[3:17:02.400 --> 3:17:08.640]  time is so short we're not you i will i will meet your film crew
[3:17:08.640 --> 3:17:11.920]  in lots of places but the united states is not one of them
[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:15.680]  so you're not want to be in the united states so you're staying out of the
[3:17:15.680 --> 3:17:19.200]  united states now yep we are still fighting the
[3:17:19.200 --> 3:17:23.360]  battles in the united states and one of our trustees ralph to citola
[3:17:23.360 --> 3:17:27.600]  is in the united states but i do not feel safe because at any moment
[3:17:27.600 --> 3:17:30.800]  they could lower the compulsory vaccine boom
[3:17:30.800 --> 3:17:34.720]  and you know what that means well i mean the washington post announces
[3:17:34.720 --> 3:17:38.800]  they're putting regular army in every town in city they are it is for the
[3:17:38.800 --> 3:17:42.080]  american people they admit it they're going for broke
[3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:46.160]  and uh... i agree now i i i feel like i i i mean it's reckless that i'm still
[3:17:46.160 --> 3:17:49.520]  even here uh... but i can't leave you there alex you
[3:17:49.520 --> 3:17:54.000]  could do all your broadcast from here and have food
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:57.440]  and protect yourself i know but i've but i've committed to go down with the
[3:17:57.440 --> 3:18:00.960]  ship here uh... so i'm gonna go down with it i may get my family out though i
[3:18:00.960 --> 3:18:03.760]  i've told people that publicly uh... because i don't think the public
[3:18:03.760 --> 3:18:06.240]  realizes just how psychopathic the elite are
[3:18:06.240 --> 3:18:10.960]  and i mean you're there on air telling them that high courts
[3:18:10.960 --> 3:18:14.800]  indian government philippine government uh... i mean all these governments
[3:18:14.800 --> 3:18:17.120]  admit it's happening we have the documents where the
[3:18:17.120 --> 3:18:19.840]  i mean we have the documents where these people are doing all this
[3:18:19.840 --> 3:18:23.920]  and and and i don't think they understand just how serious this is i mean
[3:18:23.920 --> 3:18:27.280]  they are soft killing us they're just turning up the ambient
[3:18:27.280 --> 3:18:31.440]  background uh... of uh... the soft kill systems
[3:18:31.440 --> 3:18:35.920]  incrementally so the public doesn't notice it i mean there are children
[3:18:35.920 --> 3:18:40.240]  all over austin uh... who are literally you know dying of cancer
[3:18:40.240 --> 3:18:43.200]  and i mean and i've talked to so many medical doctors who talk about when
[3:18:43.200 --> 3:18:45.120]  they were going to school i think you've said this
[3:18:45.120 --> 3:18:49.360]  that just thirty years ago uh... when we come back tell folks that story and
[3:18:49.360 --> 3:18:52.480]  then we'll plug that you're going to be on from one thirty central
[3:18:52.480 --> 3:18:56.320]  to three p.m. central uh... on wednesday
[3:18:56.320 --> 3:18:59.840]  you bet and i'd love to come on regularly alex
[3:18:59.840 --> 3:19:01.520]  you know what uh...
[3:19:01.520 --> 3:19:04.320]  i tell you we're both having these crazy scheduling problems
[3:19:04.320 --> 3:19:08.720]  i'm setting this up on air i am going to not be doing the third hour
[3:19:08.720 --> 3:19:12.640]  on fourth hour on thursday because i'm on international press tv

[3:19:30.960 --> 3:19:37.440]  uh... thursday is actually a really good day for me

[3:20:41.920 --> 3:20:47.600]  uh... can't believe what they've done in this country
[3:20:47.600 --> 3:20:51.680]  you know they know we have a blind spot to not be able to imagine such evil
[3:20:51.680 --> 3:20:56.000]  not to be able to deal with such such wickedness without a schedule change
[3:20:56.000 --> 3:21:01.760]  uh... on my end and i apologize for the confusion it's all my fault here
[3:21:01.760 --> 3:21:06.480]  um... i'm going to be on press tv in that fourth hour on wednesday so we're
[3:21:06.480 --> 3:21:10.080]  going to give you two hours of the doctor and the major general stubble
[3:21:10.080 --> 3:21:14.240]  mind appreciate them giving us uh... those two hours on thursday
[3:21:14.240 --> 3:21:18.560]  it's set in stone one to three central uh... that's uh...
[3:21:18.560 --> 3:21:23.040]  two to four panama time be sure and check out their website
[3:21:23.040 --> 3:21:28.000]  healthfreedomusa.org just life-saving information there and we'll do two
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:31.040]  hours on thursday in the five minutes we've got left
[3:21:31.040 --> 3:21:34.160]  you told the story many other medical doctors i've had on the show told the
[3:21:34.160 --> 3:21:38.640]  story you know twenty thirty forty fifty years ago like dr monteef you know he's
[3:21:38.640 --> 3:21:42.000]  been a doctor for fifty years
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:45.680]  about a child with cancer when he was going to medical school
[3:21:45.680 --> 3:21:49.600]  you know forty five fifty years ago was likes finding a leprechaun or or or
[3:21:49.600 --> 3:21:53.520]  unicorn i mean it was like finding it it didn't exist
[3:21:53.520 --> 3:21:58.960]  and now just dead kids kids with brain tumors left right all around us
[3:21:58.960 --> 3:22:03.120]  everything that the cell phones the plastics all by design
[3:22:03.120 --> 3:22:08.080]  and of course you've told the similar story explain to people what's happening
[3:22:08.080 --> 3:22:12.800]  briefly what's happening is that the life expectancy of
[3:22:12.800 --> 3:22:17.200]  children born in the year two thousand and thereafter is
[3:22:17.200 --> 3:22:22.080]  dropping so that for the first time in human history
[3:22:22.080 --> 3:22:25.360]  we can expect that a child born in two thousand
[3:22:25.360 --> 3:22:32.000]  or thereafter will die before its parents on average
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:36.160]  because the food is contaminated because children are given cell phones
[3:22:36.160 --> 3:22:40.880]  because cell towers are blasting us and we've allowed that to happen
[3:22:40.880 --> 3:22:45.280]  because our food contains genetically modified organisms unless we grow our
[3:22:45.280 --> 3:22:49.840]  own or eat totally organic or biodynamic food
[3:22:49.840 --> 3:22:53.600]  because the plastics that we feed children
[3:22:53.600 --> 3:23:01.040]  water and milk and juice from and god help us coca-cola from contain
[3:23:01.040 --> 3:23:07.120]  substances that dysregulate the entire endocrine system well that's the next
[3:23:07.120 --> 3:23:10.960]  issue i mean they just come out now and say that melamine is now not bad for
[3:23:10.960 --> 3:23:14.960]  you and it's at ninety percent of the baby formula associated press and they
[3:23:14.960 --> 3:23:19.760]  admit yeah coca-cola's got pesticide in it but the pesticide's good for you
[3:23:19.760 --> 3:23:26.560]  pesticide and on mainstream tv we see a clip that says that mercury may
[3:23:26.560 --> 3:23:31.520]  actually promote behavioral uh... confidence and
[3:23:31.520 --> 3:23:36.400]  increase the iq this is one of the craziest things i've ever seen in my life
[3:23:36.400 --> 3:23:41.280]  so lies are the order of the day we live in the orwellian world
[3:23:41.280 --> 3:23:46.880]  of truth disguised as lies and lies disguised as truth and if it weren't for
[3:23:46.880 --> 3:23:51.040]  people like you alex and i hope for people like us
[3:23:51.040 --> 3:23:57.200]  the the reality would simply not be available to us on one day
[3:23:57.200 --> 3:24:01.120]  the fda said that melamine has no safe level
[3:24:01.120 --> 3:24:04.240]  it is not possible to have a safe level of melamine
[3:24:04.240 --> 3:24:09.680]  the next day melamine has been said at one park per million with no science no
[3:24:09.680 --> 3:24:14.160]  testing no safety assurance but hey just like fluoride just like
[3:24:14.160 --> 3:24:17.360]  florida and to cover it up like to do with fluoride
[3:24:17.360 --> 3:24:21.360]  uh... leakage killing people all over tennessee is how it all started they may
[3:24:21.360 --> 3:24:24.560]  just start adding it saying it's a nutrient we've got to have
[3:24:24.560 --> 3:24:28.240]  on national news they're recommending adding statins
[3:24:28.240 --> 3:24:32.080]  forcibly to all the water did you see that doctor
[3:24:32.080 --> 3:24:36.560]  i missed that one but i'll tell you what giving statins to children quote
[3:24:36.560 --> 3:24:41.680]  protectively is beyond anything the germans did
[3:24:41.680 --> 3:24:46.960]  beyond anything these people did even during the days of their acti on
[3:24:46.960 --> 3:24:50.240]  for program where they were killing german children
[3:24:50.240 --> 3:24:54.240]  starting at zero and going to seventeen and then adding
[3:24:54.240 --> 3:24:58.160]  adding in the rest of the population because they wanted to purify the
[3:24:58.160 --> 3:25:02.640]  german race when they had defective germans what we're doing now
[3:25:02.640 --> 3:25:06.720]  is worse than anything that they're not it's hellraiser
[3:25:06.720 --> 3:25:11.760]  hellraiser is going on all around you or like something out of event horizon
[3:25:11.760 --> 3:25:14.800]  that literally a mind like that is running things
[3:25:14.800 --> 3:25:18.800]  and it's all systematically ambient background tyranny
[3:25:18.800 --> 3:25:21.920]  is just been slowly turned up like the frog in the pot
[3:25:21.920 --> 3:25:26.160]  and now they're just savagely pounding us just bam bam
[3:25:26.160 --> 3:25:30.400]  unbelievable that is absolutely correct i wish i could disagree with you and
[3:25:30.400 --> 3:25:32.800]  say that you're an alarmist alec or that you're
[3:25:32.800 --> 3:25:36.960]  misinterpreting information or that you're exaggerating unfortunately
[3:25:36.960 --> 3:25:41.200]  i believe that you are saying things exactly as they are
[3:25:41.200 --> 3:25:45.840]  and that's what we at the natural solutions foundation do now i know
[3:25:45.840 --> 3:25:49.840]  that you are probably attacked as an alarmist and so on and so on
[3:25:49.840 --> 3:25:55.920]  and so are we uh recently uh two of the folks who ought to be saying
[3:25:55.920 --> 3:26:00.960]  uh who ought to be truth telling went on the radio to say absolutely
[3:26:00.960 --> 3:26:04.720]  extraordinarily horrific lies about us but you know what
[3:26:04.720 --> 3:26:09.200]  that is how the system hold on one moment hold on one moment
[3:26:09.200 --> 3:26:13.040]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[3:26:13.040 --> 3:26:17.920]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[3:29:19.120 --> 3:29:24.320]  we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques
[3:29:24.320 --> 3:29:31.600]  which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually
[3:29:31.600 --> 3:29:35.920]  to love their servitude people can be made
[3:29:35.920 --> 3:29:40.160]  to enjoy a state of affairs which by any
[3:29:40.160 --> 3:29:44.960]  decent standard they ought not to enjoy perhaps you would better starve from the
[3:29:44.960 --> 3:29:58.480]  beginning

[3:30:12.480 --> 3:30:16.240]  harm kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics
[3:30:16.240 --> 3:30:19.680]  these new studies suggest that the opposite that the preservatives may
[3:30:19.680 --> 3:30:22.080]  actually be associated with improved behavior
[3:30:22.080 --> 3:30:26.160]  and mental performance fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay
[3:30:26.160 --> 3:30:30.320]  but could it also cause cancer oh yeah the government had the right
[3:30:30.320 --> 3:30:34.240]  under u.s. law to conduct secret testing on the american public under
[3:30:34.240 --> 3:30:36.720]  specific conditions we have to work the dark side
[3:30:36.720 --> 3:30:42.400]  while spending time in the shadows any attempt to achieve world order must be
[3:30:42.400 --> 3:30:46.720]  the work of the devil well join me i'm glad to sit here with the right hand
[3:30:46.720 --> 3:30:50.720]  to see there's a need for new world order
[3:30:50.720 --> 3:31:06.800]  someday in the next few years a solution will emerge
[3:31:06.800 --> 3:31:20.400]  i know there's a lot of people out there that try to deny
[3:31:20.400 --> 3:31:27.280]  the issues we cover there out of fear because there are real monsters
[3:31:27.280 --> 3:31:30.720]  in this world and they control the heights
[3:31:30.720 --> 3:31:34.480]  above us they introduce the poisons
[3:31:34.480 --> 3:31:40.000]  into the food supply the water we drink the air we breathe
[3:31:40.000 --> 3:31:44.720]  they are releasing plagues upon the earth
[3:31:44.720 --> 3:31:50.320]  they are drunk on the blood of billions they have sold us that
[3:31:50.320 --> 3:31:53.520]  hundreds of millions of aborted children is a beautiful thing that
[3:31:53.520 --> 3:31:57.600]  euthanized elderly is a wonderful right
[3:31:57.600 --> 3:32:03.120]  with sodium fluoride and gmo foods and small children with cell phones
[3:32:03.120 --> 3:32:09.040]  microwaving their brains is good and rather than reject their lie
[3:32:09.040 --> 3:32:13.040]  we're so afraid we say i'll just rationalize to myself
[3:32:13.040 --> 3:32:16.560]  and say that everything's okay in the new world order loves me
[3:32:16.560 --> 3:32:19.600]  gene in texas john and virginia and others that are holding
[3:32:19.600 --> 3:32:22.160]  we're going to take your calls for the balance of the show you know i had a
[3:32:22.160 --> 3:32:28.240]  lot of notes that i wrote up last night
[3:32:28.240 --> 3:32:34.480]  one of my daughter's doodles on the back but
[3:32:34.480 --> 3:32:37.840]  three pages of handwritten and type notes
[3:32:37.840 --> 3:32:40.960]  that i meant to go over and it's all just too important to do it at the end of
[3:32:40.960 --> 3:32:45.760]  the show because i'm exhausted right now for some reason
[3:32:45.760 --> 3:32:50.400]  it doesn't even bother me when people attack me
[3:32:50.400 --> 3:32:57.280]  for my own self i don't even care the facing all of this like blast your ego
[3:32:57.280 --> 3:33:01.280]  away i mean i'd love to be able to enjoy my
[3:33:01.280 --> 3:33:04.880]  little status and people knowing who i am i'd love to be able to
[3:33:04.880 --> 3:33:08.880]  you know you'll be a guy out doing good work but you're still enjoying it and
[3:33:08.880 --> 3:33:15.120]  and and you know enjoying the fight i don't enjoy any of it
[3:33:15.120 --> 3:33:19.840]  i take heart in the children we save from cps
[3:33:19.840 --> 3:33:24.000]  by educating parents about the traps or get people that get
[3:33:24.000 --> 3:33:27.360]  off of gmo foods or at least reduce it or people that don't vaccinate their
[3:33:27.360 --> 3:33:31.520]  children or people that find out
[3:33:31.520 --> 3:33:34.960]  but it's like i'm so busy trying to warn other people that don't know
[3:33:34.960 --> 3:33:40.320]  that you know as we save people for every person we save we lose a thousand
[3:33:40.320 --> 3:33:43.920]  and so i'm just so focused on all the carnage and destruction i see and
[3:33:43.920 --> 3:33:48.880]  all the horrible things i see happening to humanity that
[3:33:48.880 --> 3:33:54.960]  i mean i can't i can't go eat fajitas and enjoy myself without feeling guilty
[3:33:54.960 --> 3:33:57.760]  for even enjoying myself i don't know how to explain it
[3:33:57.760 --> 3:34:01.760]  i can't even take off and go see a movie now
[3:34:01.760 --> 3:34:04.720]  because i all i'm thinking about is the new world war and all the stuff they're
[3:34:04.720 --> 3:34:09.520]  doing and how my going to a movie normalizes all of this you know
[3:34:09.520 --> 3:34:12.800]  we should be in the streets freaking out pulling our hair out
[3:34:12.800 --> 3:34:17.120]  but they just incrementally turn the tyranny up
[3:34:17.120 --> 3:34:20.400]  to where you know even i am acting insane
[3:34:20.400 --> 3:34:24.160]  this is an insanely calm response to what they're doing
[3:34:24.160 --> 3:34:27.600]  i mean it's not bad that they're putting fluoride in the water and they
[3:34:27.600 --> 3:34:31.520]  knew it gave people cancer and attack their glands and reduce their IQ by
[3:34:31.520 --> 3:34:37.280]  20 points on average i mean that right there is mind blowing
[3:34:37.280 --> 3:34:40.480]  and and and now they're saying yeah melamine's good for you mercury's good
[3:34:40.480 --> 3:34:42.800]  for you well we used to say it was poison but now it's
[3:34:42.800 --> 3:34:46.640]  good oh you're dying good dying is good
[3:34:46.640 --> 3:34:50.880]  it's psych warfare they're just they're just throwing everything in our
[3:34:50.880 --> 3:34:54.240]  and you know i can go read all the behavioral psychologists and psychiatrists
[3:34:54.240 --> 3:34:56.800]  and study it and everything from Freud to
[3:34:56.800 --> 3:35:00.240]  Jung to Bernays to right through the modern stuff
[3:35:00.240 --> 3:35:06.640]  and they are practicing just savage it's an art form combinations of all these
[3:35:06.640 --> 3:35:11.840]  different psychological schools and brainwashing techniques and tv and
[3:35:11.840 --> 3:35:16.960]  neuro-linguistic programming and just subliminals just targeting just
[3:35:16.960 --> 3:35:20.000]  blasting people
[3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:26.400]  to where we all just as they ambient you know background noise like crickets
[3:35:26.400 --> 3:35:30.320]  is an ambient sound and then they get louder and louder and louder and louder
[3:35:30.320 --> 3:35:32.720]  until just shatters your eardrums you know that's the analogy
[3:35:32.720 --> 3:35:37.120]  they're just slowly turning the sound up slowly
[3:35:37.120 --> 3:35:42.960]  but now it's already now they're starting to crank it even faster
[3:35:42.960 --> 3:35:46.880]  and it's not ambient anymore it's blaring all around us to tyrannies
[3:35:46.880 --> 3:35:49.760]  everywhere and people are kind of waking up but
[3:35:49.760 --> 3:35:54.960]  they still have no idea how deep it is
[3:35:57.760 --> 3:36:03.920]  and it's so sick when you read Prince Philip or Ted Turner or all these un
[3:36:03.920 --> 3:36:09.360]  chiefs or Jacques Cousteau or Eric Pianca or a Peter
[3:36:09.360 --> 3:36:13.520]  singer there's thousands of them all writing books and papers about how
[3:36:13.520 --> 3:36:17.360]  90 percent of us need to be killed that's one school the government policies
[3:36:17.360 --> 3:36:21.520]  80 percent of us need to be killed and then now they're losing ground
[3:36:21.520 --> 3:36:24.480]  to the suicidal nihilist that's really what it's all about and these top
[3:36:24.480 --> 3:36:29.120]  scientists will like be writing public papers
[3:36:29.120 --> 3:36:34.880]  and then they'll just say I just love death I just want to kill
[3:36:34.880 --> 3:36:40.160]  I mean that's like Pianca he's sitting there and he's going oh I love Lucifer
[3:36:40.160 --> 3:36:43.600]  on the UT website it's all about how they got to kill us and get rid of us and
[3:36:43.600 --> 3:36:48.240]  then he's dressed up in a druid outfit knowing I love Lucifer
[3:36:48.240 --> 3:36:52.080]  on the UT website I mean it's it's craziness this guy's running around
[3:36:52.080 --> 3:36:56.320]  getting standing ovation saying kill everybody
[3:36:56.320 --> 3:36:59.760]  and then his students send me threatening emails
[3:36:59.760 --> 3:37:03.200]  and send me their white papers send me their phd papers
[3:37:03.200 --> 3:37:07.680]  and then I google their name and it's them in lab coats at bio weapons labs
[3:37:07.680 --> 3:37:13.840]  and the and the white papers his graduate students send me
[3:37:13.840 --> 3:37:18.080]  you know I wrote this five years ago you piece of filth and I he's actually a
[3:37:18.080 --> 3:37:24.400]  moderate I believe in total human extinction we are a parasite
[3:37:24.400 --> 3:37:27.920]  they're everywhere they run it all it's this base
[3:37:27.920 --> 3:37:31.120]  power tripping you talk to these people at the end of the day they're not even
[3:37:31.120 --> 3:37:35.120]  that smart they are just wicked they they just they just like
[3:37:35.120 --> 3:37:38.800]  oh we will kill everyone oh yes it's it's a
[3:37:38.800 --> 3:37:43.680]  you don't understand I mean that you know that's the you don't understand
[3:37:43.680 --> 3:37:49.920]  it's like I just want to you know that's the response to
[3:37:49.920 --> 3:37:53.600]  these people is just clean them out
[3:37:53.600 --> 3:37:57.040]  they declare war on us we declare war on them
[3:37:57.040 --> 3:38:00.560]  listen to game people
[3:38:08.080 --> 3:38:10.720]  so I do everything I can to break people out of their triumph people say oh don't
[3:38:10.720 --> 3:38:13.520]  get so excited don't get upset you're only allowed to get excited about the
[3:38:13.520 --> 3:38:16.480]  football game that's when you're supposed to paint yourself up in war
[3:38:16.480 --> 3:38:20.240]  paint simulated warfare and it kind of tickles
[3:38:20.240 --> 3:38:24.000]  your mind and feels satisfying while you're there because that's an instinct
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:27.440]  to war to defend yourself from oppression and enslavement
[3:38:27.440 --> 3:38:31.120]  and they just make it into some little prosthesis some little some little toy
[3:38:31.120 --> 3:38:34.960]  you know I use the analogy it's like a blow-up doll
[3:38:34.960 --> 3:38:38.240]  it's like a man who doesn't go out and actually find a mate and build a family
[3:38:38.240 --> 3:38:45.760]  no he has a blow-up doll and and and and blow-up dolls are what sports are
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:38:51.600]  to men's instincts to resist and fight you understand
[3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:55.360]  sports is like a man going out instead of getting a woman it's like a man going
[3:38:55.360 --> 3:38:59.680]  out and and and taking his his blow-up doll to dinner
[3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:03.280]  and and buying his blow-up doll diamond rings
[3:39:03.280 --> 3:39:07.520]  and and and buying his blow-up doll insurance
[3:39:08.080 --> 3:39:13.680]  that's what sports is it's a facsimile of warfare a facsimile of human
[3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:16.960]  aggression you have those instincts for a reason
[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:20.480]  but they tell you oh be nice in politics be nice in culture
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:23.440]  shut up lay down but the government didn't nice with all their militarized
[3:39:23.440 --> 3:39:27.200]  police and the troops and all the rest of it
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:31.120]  see only the government's allowed to be violent with you and aggressive
[3:39:31.120 --> 3:39:35.040]  and then the only place a human being a slave
[3:39:35.040 --> 3:39:46.880]  is allowed to be speaking out publicly
[3:39:46.880 --> 3:39:49.600]  it's crazy in here what's going on with guests today
[3:39:49.600 --> 3:39:52.720]  i've got a i am here saying mike adam from the health ranger let me know if
[3:39:52.720 --> 3:39:57.440]  you want him on he just dropped off somebody set him up today what's going
[3:39:57.440 --> 3:40:01.040]  on with all these guests no no he just called into the show
[3:40:01.040 --> 3:40:06.080]  oh he wanted to comment okay i didn't know that well
[3:40:06.080 --> 3:40:09.440]  call him back and make sure he knows that i wasn't ignoring his call but i've
[3:40:09.440 --> 3:40:13.600]  been wanting to get him on the show okay that was strange then
[3:40:13.600 --> 3:40:16.160]  you know folks i'm gonna tell you something all this eugenics and
[3:40:16.160 --> 3:40:20.080]  extermination and evil is going on and it's targeting you and your family and
[3:40:20.080 --> 3:40:23.120]  i know that's heavy and i know that's hard to deal with
[3:40:23.120 --> 3:40:28.960]  but we've got to get out of this mind-numbed thing we're in
[3:40:28.960 --> 3:40:32.400]  we have got to get out of this mind-numbed position where we've just been
[3:40:32.400 --> 3:40:35.840]  taught to accept this and then all the props all the
[3:40:35.840 --> 3:40:38.880]  facades of liberty and freedom that they had up while they were building
[3:40:38.880 --> 3:40:43.280]  this technological murder system this technological enslavement
[3:40:43.280 --> 3:40:47.680]  extermination grid they're now pulling out all the facades and all the
[3:40:47.680 --> 3:41:00.320]  all the props and all that's left is the tyranny
[3:41:00.320 --> 3:41:04.720]  oh god let me plug some sponsors and then we'll go to your calls here at the
[3:41:04.720 --> 3:41:07.280]  end of the show
[3:41:07.840 --> 3:41:09.760]  um
[3:41:13.120 --> 3:41:16.560]  you know these sponsors all make the show possible and they're
[3:41:16.560 --> 3:41:19.760]  people i endorse and i think you ought to check them out one of them is e-foods

[3:41:28.960 --> 3:41:32.800]  piece of the puzzle away from the enemy they can't control you if you've got
[3:41:32.800 --> 3:41:35.520]  arms and you got food you're willing to defend it
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:38.880]  that's how they do it they cut the power in the water and the food off and make
[3:41:38.880 --> 3:41:42.800]  you come groveling to them so give e-foods direct a call get one of

[3:47:16.960 --> 3:47:23.760]  stay with us okay uh... john used to talk to the internet
[3:47:23.760 --> 3:47:26.880]  audience appreciate you're holding uh... john in virginia you're all john
[3:47:26.880 --> 3:47:33.280]  just hung up zack in hawaii thanks for holding her on the air
[3:47:33.280 --> 3:47:38.320]  is that go ahead hello yes that you're on the air
[3:47:38.320 --> 3:47:41.440]  um... yes i wanted to talk about
[3:47:41.440 --> 3:47:46.560]  the peace and the the fact that there's a lot of people going towards the
[3:47:46.560 --> 3:47:49.600]  movement that you're talking about and uh...
[3:47:49.600 --> 3:47:52.400]  and i'm not i don't just mean that you're talking about i mean i i come to
[3:47:52.400 --> 3:47:55.280]  these conclusions from just looking at history and whatnot
[3:47:55.280 --> 3:48:00.400]  and uh... if we don't if we don't maintain peace which has always been a
[3:48:00.400 --> 3:48:02.880]  good thing in the in the civil rights movement
[3:48:02.880 --> 3:48:07.920]  um... it's going it'll it'll change everything because
[3:48:07.920 --> 3:48:13.920]  there their amount of recruits they have that are brainwashed as a huge amount
[3:48:13.920 --> 3:48:18.480]  of the the problem and and in the amount that are
[3:48:18.480 --> 3:48:22.960]  so brainwashed that they're beyond repair or or you know they're they're just
[3:48:22.960 --> 3:48:26.960]  never going to turn they already know they already are for world
[3:48:26.960 --> 3:48:29.520]  government and what well there's a lot of people too
[3:48:29.520 --> 3:48:33.360]  who've been busy saying we're liars and government's only good and sweet and
[3:48:33.360 --> 3:48:35.760]  doesn't do anything bad and there's no global
[3:48:35.760 --> 3:48:38.480]  combine of banks and there's none of this happening
[3:48:38.480 --> 3:48:42.640]  now that it's all being announced they still have to say it's not happening
[3:48:42.640 --> 3:48:45.840]  because for them it's about an argument like a football game
[3:48:45.840 --> 3:48:50.720]  of who's right and who's wrong so they're committed to lying
[3:48:50.720 --> 3:48:53.760]  and going along with the corruption because deep down they're scared to
[3:48:53.760 --> 3:48:57.440]  death so they they can't admit it's real
[3:48:57.440 --> 3:49:01.520]  yes exactly so getting them to turn change their minds
[3:49:01.520 --> 3:49:06.160]  before going into some kind of conflict on a on a domestic level
[3:49:06.160 --> 3:49:10.720]  or anything like that is a must because and then and and then you pretty much
[3:49:10.720 --> 3:49:17.120]  can transform using propaganda on on on using truth and propaganda instead of
[3:49:17.120 --> 3:49:21.440]  just bullshit oh i mean i appreciate your call sir
[3:49:21.440 --> 3:49:28.880]  um let's go ahead now and take another call
[3:49:28.880 --> 3:49:32.960]  let's go ahead and speak with well we're gonna be coming out of break here in a
[3:49:32.960 --> 3:49:36.800]  moment so i'll just wait to go to the full audience
[3:49:36.800 --> 3:49:40.560]  to see that's another form of false rebellion with that guy just did he did
[3:49:40.560 --> 3:49:45.280]  that on purpose whatever man you're on the internet
[3:49:45.440 --> 3:49:49.120]  thinking that that's a totem of power doing that that's a that's a form of
[3:49:49.120 --> 3:49:51.840]  rebellion and it's not really i mean you know i'm not
[3:49:51.840 --> 3:49:54.480]  against tattoos and earrings and all this stuff i don't care i'm not even
[3:49:54.480 --> 3:49:58.320]  criticizing them i understand people like them people are into them fetishes
[3:49:58.320 --> 3:50:01.360]  you know for things like that whatever i'm not saying you're bad
[3:50:01.360 --> 3:50:05.440]  i'm saying that for some people that's about who they are
[3:50:05.440 --> 3:50:08.640]  instead of their ideas and i want people
[3:50:08.640 --> 3:50:13.280]  to rebel against the tyranny and rebel against the right things
[3:50:13.280 --> 3:50:16.240]  um
[3:50:16.240 --> 3:50:44.560]  that's all i'm trying to say here here we go
[3:50:44.560 --> 3:50:50.880]  oh yeah sometimes satan comes a man apiece
[3:50:50.880 --> 3:50:56.560]  maroc obama this whole cabinet a bunch of warm mongering killers

[3:51:26.960 --> 3:51:30.720]  and uh i'm very glad that i got through i just wanted to say
[3:51:30.720 --> 3:51:36.800]  earlier uh and make a comment uh when the guy was talking uh when i had brought
[3:51:36.800 --> 3:51:41.440]  up something about um i think when you had the minister
[3:51:41.440 --> 3:51:44.800]  on and he said brought up something about how you know about

[3:51:48.480 --> 3:51:52.080]  your books and stuff i wanted to make a comment to
[3:51:52.080 --> 3:51:57.120]  i guess if he's still listening everything that you have talked about
[3:51:57.120 --> 3:52:00.720]  at other people similar to you in your field
[3:52:00.720 --> 3:52:04.400]  and on the subject of this one world order and all this the other things that
[3:52:04.400 --> 3:52:08.880]  are going on this planet have already happened
[3:52:08.880 --> 3:52:12.320]  and they've been happening for the longest and right now it's
[3:52:12.320 --> 3:52:19.760]  accentuating but i can tell him this i have suffered first hand
[3:52:19.760 --> 3:52:23.360]  from everything what you've talked about very similar and i'm not of any
[3:52:23.360 --> 3:52:28.400]  political affiliation or any type top of person but i lost my own child was
[3:52:28.400 --> 3:52:32.080]  viciously murdered in texas and it was a big cover-up behind
[3:52:32.080 --> 3:52:35.760]  a very big one now i'm sorry to hear that involving
[3:52:35.760 --> 3:52:41.680]  even the feds an undercover agent even came to one of my relatives my aunt
[3:52:41.680 --> 3:52:45.760]  and told her that it would jeopardize lives and positions if the truth came
[3:52:45.760 --> 3:52:48.320]  out that they were doing investigations throughout all those
[3:52:48.320 --> 3:52:51.520]  measures that were going on in texas but especially in the dallas
[3:52:51.520 --> 3:52:57.040]  fort warfare area of those kids especially during that in the 90s
[3:52:57.040 --> 3:53:03.520]  and right to this day we're fighting for some land that was
[3:53:03.520 --> 3:53:07.920]  illegally taken from one of my ancestors in the early 1900s
[3:53:07.920 --> 3:53:14.880]  but up to this day over 16 000 acres of prime oil and gas with cold and
[3:53:14.880 --> 3:53:19.360]  lignite and yet these all companies have went in there

[3:53:24.000 --> 3:53:27.600]  now i got the proof on that 16 000 point
[3:53:27.600 --> 3:53:31.680]  six hundred eighty eight point zero eight acres and i can show you proof
[3:53:31.680 --> 3:53:34.960]  it's three other people that i have the truth and they had it hidden

[3:53:49.600 --> 3:53:53.520]  anything but yet we i have i have it and two other people have
[3:53:53.520 --> 3:53:59.600]  proof where they had committed fraud in that county in oh i know
