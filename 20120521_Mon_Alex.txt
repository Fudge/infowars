[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:31.280]  we are going to have another jam packed broadcast for you on this Monday the 21st
[00:31.280 --> 00:38.880]  today of May 2012 but I'm gonna open the phones up in the first 45 minutes of
[00:38.880 --> 00:44.000]  this hour today ahead of guest and masses of news because I want to get
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.560]  your take on Bilderberg 2012 I wanted to cover some of this yesterday and there's
[00:48.560 --> 00:54.440]  since been more news reported on it Washington Post Politico you name it
[00:54.440 --> 00:58.200]  they're admitting hey there is a group of global elitist that meet in secret
[00:58.200 --> 01:05.120]  and yes Alex Jones found out the location of it but he's still a bad man
[01:05.120 --> 01:11.680]  and it's a conspiracy theory not to like him and here is Politico Rubio and the
[01:11.680 --> 01:18.440]  Bilderberg conspiracy are you planning to be there Bilderberg 2012 Chantilly
[01:18.440 --> 01:23.540]  Virginia yes it's really there yes I'm gonna be there covering it and yes
[01:23.540 --> 01:27.600]  we're hearing from people all over the US and all over the world we're gonna be
[01:27.600 --> 01:31.640]  there not just protesting the minions of these people at NATO in a big police
[01:31.640 --> 01:35.840]  state rollout in Chicago where they're charging people with terrorism for having
[01:35.840 --> 01:41.160]  beer making equipment now they don't want attention on this concept but they
[01:41.160 --> 01:44.680]  now know because of protests coming they've got to go ahead and admit it
[01:44.680 --> 01:47.560]  exists and millions of people are going wait a minute I thought that didn't
[01:47.560 --> 01:52.080]  exist the ADL and Southern Primary Law Center said it didn't exist then it was
[01:52.080 --> 01:55.680]  part of fantasies how like the government doesn't stage terror attacks
[01:55.680 --> 02:02.840]  doesn't ship guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment so we're gonna be
[02:02.840 --> 02:05.760]  breaking that down also I tried to get into this some yesterday whenever I
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.200]  really had time properly I want to get into learned helplessness cognitive
[02:10.200 --> 02:15.080]  dissonance now it ties into the Overton window the normalcy bias and the
[02:15.080 --> 02:18.720]  Stockholm syndrome I will spend some time on that today probably the last
[02:18.720 --> 02:23.160]  30 minutes the show Lenin LaRouche wants to pop in and give us an update on
[02:23.160 --> 02:28.000]  what's happening with the impeachment moves against Obama and the word that
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.400]  we're getting from Corsi and a lot of other people is that Obama may be going
[02:31.400 --> 02:36.360]  out the door like that Corsi and Tarpley on they were agreeing with that
[02:36.360 --> 02:43.840]  yesterday wow also Derek Bros is gonna be joining us they have successfully
[02:43.840 --> 02:47.080]  gotten the city council to say okay we know it's illegal we won't have the
[02:47.080 --> 02:52.480]  TSA out doing random searches on highways and roads and bus stations in
[02:52.480 --> 02:55.720]  Houston well I don't believe that for a minute they just want the opposition to
[02:55.720 --> 02:59.160]  go away they'll be back but it shows that when we stand up we have an effect
[02:59.160 --> 03:03.200]  it's patently illegal and then Fred Springmeyer is gonna be joining us talk
[03:03.200 --> 03:06.440]  about a host of issues people really been requesting that he be back on the
[03:06.440 --> 03:14.720]  show so he'll be with us in the second hour but today I want to give people
[03:14.720 --> 03:21.080]  first-time callers that is a chance to call in on any of the news Obama's
[03:21.080 --> 03:26.840]  agent for 16 years nine months saying he was born in Kenya you do get your the
[03:26.840 --> 03:31.080]  agents get the info from the author the author provides that to him and this is
[03:31.080 --> 03:36.040]  open and shut what's your take on that what's your take on every few days
[03:36.040 --> 03:39.800]  they're busting people with huge containers full of dead babies being
[03:39.800 --> 03:44.360]  sent to Satanist to be eaten but your normalcy bias can't handle that so I
[03:44.360 --> 03:47.560]  understand some of you new listeners think I'm joking London independent
[03:47.560 --> 03:52.560]  Britain arrested in Thailand after being found with roasted babies and of course
[03:52.560 --> 03:57.800]  that dovetails the article last week about the powdered babies 16 17,000
[03:57.800 --> 04:03.720]  pills with the dead babies in them so that's all coming up big news on the

[04:32.160 --> 04:35.800]  doing that domestically but they're gonna get rid of that and that's in the
[04:35.800 --> 04:39.360]  bill that's moving forward towards passage to have the army involved in
[04:39.360 --> 04:42.760]  lying to you of course it's already going on what do they do the troops all

[09:03.760 --> 09:10.600]  about world events and the fact that CPS the elites the abortuaries as he's
[09:10.600 --> 09:15.440]  written in his books for more than 15 years are supplying baby parts for
[09:15.440 --> 09:20.960]  satanic rituals I have multiple mainstream articles about that today
[09:20.960 --> 09:27.440]  including Britain arrested in Thailand after being found with six roasted babies
[09:27.440 --> 09:33.160]  and he was advertising in on a black magic website all the power you'd get
[09:33.160 --> 09:40.160]  when you got the babies roasted wrapped in gold leaf hey the crew went out and
[09:40.160 --> 09:47.040]  got breakfast tacos this morning wrapped in aluminum foil and salsa and the
[09:47.040 --> 09:51.600]  funny thing is I've never wanted to eat baby or have it wrapped in gold leaf like
[09:51.600 --> 09:57.200]  I'm a very important person imagine wanting to feel powerful with a dead baby
[09:57.200 --> 10:01.680]  that died a horrible death roasted wrapped in gold leaf because you're a
[10:01.680 --> 10:07.280]  rich globalist and feeling powerful over the life that was ruined and then and
[10:07.280 --> 10:11.080]  then eating it so you get power you think you're getting power I mean how
[10:11.080 --> 10:19.240]  pathetic but Nero marrying well Nero burned down Rome to expand his palace
[10:19.240 --> 10:23.600]  and would murder children for fine dressed up as a werewolf that's on record
[10:23.600 --> 10:26.840]  you can look that up in the mainline histories last time I did that John
[10:26.840 --> 10:31.040]  bound looked it up and found like Daily Mail and Reuters articles about it he
[10:31.040 --> 10:34.200]  would dress up as a werewolf and rip children's throats out at public dinners
[10:34.200 --> 10:39.360]  Caligula would marry his horse but but see I just never get sick of a potato
[10:39.360 --> 10:45.720]  egg and cheese breakfast taco with the excellent salsa this little place we go
[10:45.720 --> 10:50.560]  to has I mean I just never get tired of it I just never get tired of my wife I

[10:55.600 --> 10:59.640]  fun with friends I'm not a globalist I'm not a trendy hold on this isn't a baby
[10:59.640 --> 11:08.920]  wrapped in gold leaf because see I'm an extremist mmm mmm that's even better
[11:08.920 --> 11:17.720]  whole raw milk whatever you do don't hit the red alert sound oh yeah it's now
[11:17.720 --> 11:24.280]  criminal they're now arresting people going door-to-door in multiple states for
[11:24.280 --> 11:31.960]  drinking raw milk see raw milk and breakfast tacos are evil because they're
[11:31.960 --> 11:41.360]  wholesome now baby's wrapped in red foil I mean in gold foil that is trendy and
[11:41.360 --> 11:45.840]  cool well and powerful

[12:15.160 --> 12:19.120]  little children that the government likes to grab and then we've got Lenin
[12:19.120 --> 12:22.080]  LaRouche popping in for 30 minutes and then I'm gonna get back into the normal
[12:22.080 --> 12:27.960]  seeing bias Stockholm syndrome learned helplessness cognitive dissonance
[12:27.960 --> 12:33.440]  curse that this society is under right now in the last 30 minutes of the
[12:33.440 --> 12:38.840]  broadcast today national media is now admitting Bilderberg our globalist that
[12:38.840 --> 12:42.040]  want world government but those of us that were right about that are still
[12:42.040 --> 12:46.800]  bad because we don't want to eat babies roasted wrapped in gold foil we're just
[12:46.800 --> 12:52.320]  we just don't get power we're not we're not trendy and we've got Hawaii response
[12:52.320 --> 12:59.320]  to Obama's birth records request and we've also got a report up at info wars
[12:59.320 --> 13:04.120]  calm with the amazing video and audio it's like a ten minute video of the
[13:04.120 --> 13:08.080]  teacher and all this cussing going on telling the students you're not allowed
[13:08.080 --> 13:15.120]  to criticize the president or you'll be arrested and the young eloquent student
[13:15.120 --> 13:20.760]  is saying no no I have a right of free speech and the teacher starts screaming
[13:20.760 --> 13:28.880]  shut up shut up shut up you're gonna get in trouble you're gonna get arrested we
[13:28.880 --> 13:32.680]  would air it right now but there's so many cuss words in it that it's gonna
[13:32.680 --> 13:36.880]  take quite an editing job so we might have that ready towards the middle or
[13:36.880 --> 13:44.720]  end of the broadcast today so that is all coming up I mean it is an absolute
[13:44.720 --> 13:50.040]  information overload after I take some calls congressman seeks to lift
[13:50.040 --> 13:55.540]  propaganda ban as if they are following the ban propaganda that supposed to
[13:55.540 --> 14:00.440]  target foreigners could now be aimed at Americans really all these pro join the
[14:00.440 --> 14:06.560]  military movies everywhere all the anti-liberty messages in TV oh you don't
[14:06.560 --> 14:11.840]  think they're not operating I mean Anderson Cooper is admitted CIA and he
[14:11.840 --> 14:20.720]  admits he CIA reversing a long-standing policy well it's it's a law
[14:22.760 --> 14:29.400]  disconcerting and dangerous says experts constitutional experts and it goes on
[14:29.400 --> 14:37.880]  to say they strike the ban on domestic dissemination of propaganda designed to
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.840]  mislead foreign governments and populations show black propaganda is
[14:42.840 --> 14:47.120]  what's that is basically called yeah I'd call it black propaganda blowing up
[14:47.120 --> 14:51.000]  those world trade centers and saying their CIA asset bin Laden had done it
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.840]  to overthrow our republic and bring in a police state so see they're just making
[14:56.840 --> 15:03.840]  formal what is already being done I mean they admit the CIA is working in every
[15:03.840 --> 15:08.480]  major local police department it's totally illegal and the cops get all
[15:08.480 --> 15:12.320]  starry-eyed on the news and go we're working with the CIA at our threat
[15:12.320 --> 15:16.400]  fusion center like like they found a unicorn or something like when you're
[15:16.400 --> 15:22.080]  CIA you're like this magic person who's so incredible and really most of our
[15:22.080 --> 15:25.960]  bunch of dirtbag criminals involved in every form of crime from child trafficking
[15:25.960 --> 15:31.680]  narcotics trafficking on record I mean it's like it's so pathetic and the CIA
[15:31.680 --> 15:36.240]  openly along with 15 other agencies works and hundreds of private contractor
[15:36.240 --> 15:42.300]  groups for foreign banks I mean it's the banker occupation army saying we're
[15:42.300 --> 15:46.480]  gonna arrest you we're gonna set up checkpoints we're gonna disappear you and
[15:46.480 --> 15:50.880]  we're gonna use propaganda against you lying about people in the media well
[15:50.880 --> 15:55.600]  good discredit yourselves fully that's good it's kind of like Google came out
[15:55.600 --> 15:59.400]  in the feds rule two weeks ago yeah Google's ties to the NSA can remain
[15:59.400 --> 16:05.000]  secret gee their real headquarters are at NASA and NSA bases and they have a
[16:05.000 --> 16:10.880]  fleet of government aircraft I mean do you think I need to have the Congress
[16:10.880 --> 16:15.920]  tell me it's the NSA to know that I reverse engineered the setup of it it's
[16:15.920 --> 16:22.120]  not even a secret it was set up in 1998 by the National Security Agency and the
[16:22.120 --> 16:28.200]  CIA they've they're about to have sentencing in the case of this guy that
[16:28.200 --> 16:34.080]  set up a surveillance cam in his dorm to watch his roommate have gay sex and the
[16:34.080 --> 16:37.760]  guy committed suicide over it so they're about to put the guy in jail for
[16:37.760 --> 16:42.520]  decades and I'm just like okay put him in jail for decades for violating
[16:42.520 --> 16:48.440]  somebody's privacy but the issue here is the criminal government does this out
[16:48.440 --> 16:51.360]  in the open and says it's to fight al-Qaeda oh yeah we're breaking the law
[16:51.360 --> 16:57.480]  to fight al-Qaeda the al-Qaeda you fund openly and give Libya and Syria and we've
[16:57.480 --> 17:01.440]  had the NSA whistleblowers risking their lives coming on like C. Bell Edmonds
[17:01.440 --> 17:06.520]  where the government is openly the so-called government on record she's
[17:06.520 --> 17:11.840]  reading the the the NSA communicates where the CIA is commanding bin Laden on

[17:58.080 --> 18:02.320]  carrier the captain all of them together and said you can tell me I'm he took his
[18:02.320 --> 18:05.560]  hat off and he said I'm just like you know you can tell me what happened he
[18:05.560 --> 18:09.160]  put his hat back on he said you're not just gonna go to prison if you tell

[18:45.080 --> 18:50.120]  Hiroshio hornblower or something or
[18:51.800 --> 18:58.320]  Patrick O'Brien novel point is is that they call them all in and I mean I've
[18:58.320 --> 19:03.560]  had the judge advocate general on who saw the secret testimony all of it how
[19:03.560 --> 19:07.480]  they knew the ship was being attacked to be sunk to be blamed on Egypt to start a
[19:07.480 --> 19:11.320]  big war as a false flag and the jets had launched and the admirals were ordered
[19:11.320 --> 19:15.440]  you turn them back we want that ship going the bottom and LBJ got on the
[19:15.440 --> 19:20.400]  radio because the admirals on the on the ships was a whole group of aircraft
[19:20.400 --> 19:24.440]  carriers and ships out there said we're not going to follow that order they
[19:24.440 --> 19:29.480]  told McNamara no so McNamara put the president on the line you know the
[19:29.480 --> 19:34.160]  telephone hooked into the radio and said listen I want that ship going to the
[19:34.160 --> 19:39.880]  GD bottom and I've had the officers on who heard that and those planes turned
[19:39.880 --> 19:44.280]  around and landed and they but by God's good graces the most decorated ship in

[25:55.200 --> 25:59.960]  you run into them now and again they're paranoid about things that aren't a

[26:46.640 --> 26:51.360]  three listeners and then they want to pick apart you who woke me up to the
[26:51.360 --> 26:56.400]  idea of synthetic terror false flag so you know all the haters out there and

[27:12.120 --> 27:18.320]  killed if they speak up about what they saw in Oklahoma City 9 11 USS Liberty or
[27:18.320 --> 27:22.840]  whatever you want to talk about no I've interviewed the eyewitnesses that saw
[27:22.840 --> 27:29.480]  the feds by name planting the bombs I've interviewed the admirals and people
[27:29.480 --> 27:33.600]  that yes the government of Israel tried to sink the USS Liberty and was working
[27:33.600 --> 27:38.440]  with Lennon Mains Johnson as a pretext to launch a larger war I've interviewed
[27:38.440 --> 27:41.400]  the witnesses the police officers that heard the countdown to blow up building
[27:41.400 --> 27:45.360]  7 and I have the newscast where they said get back they're gonna blow it up and I
[27:45.360 --> 27:48.680]  heard them say they blew it up on the news and I have the videos of that I
[27:48.680 --> 27:53.880]  mean it's it's there they we have a criminal group running things and the
[27:53.880 --> 27:59.680]  only reason I'm not dead is because of your prayers and because of the fact
[27:59.680 --> 28:03.800]  that I'm a public figure but they still may do something to me but you know
[28:03.800 --> 28:08.600]  that's just the way it is but look I appreciate your call I don't have time
[28:08.600 --> 28:17.280]  to even read the entire article that was in Politico that quotes yours truly
[28:17.280 --> 28:22.360]  multiple times and plugs our website I mean I didn't even I read the first two
[28:22.360 --> 28:27.800]  quotes and then quit reading so if I'm not gonna read I'll be honest with you
[28:27.800 --> 28:32.040]  I barely even tune in when I'm on things like Nightline I'm told I'm in Rolling
[28:32.040 --> 28:37.040]  Stone magazine again I haven't even gone out and bought a copy so I'm so busy I
[28:37.040 --> 28:42.040]  guess with target Narcosis they call it that's where somebody's flying in
[28:42.040 --> 28:46.000]  World War two a fighter jet a fighter plane not fighter jet I guess the
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.400]  Germans that have jets but we didn't flying in over a train or something
[28:50.400 --> 28:55.640]  strafing it and you get so focused on the target you fly into it I mean I am so
[28:55.640 --> 29:00.800]  focused going straightforward against the New World Order that I don't pay
[29:00.800 --> 29:05.920]  attention to trolls I don't pay attention to so-called networks because I
[29:05.920 --> 29:08.840]  know there are some things that do audio screams out there you know with a
[29:08.840 --> 29:13.360]  couple hundred listeners I wish it was more whose whole world is talking trash
[29:13.360 --> 29:17.480]  about me because occasionally I've accidentally run into it and other than
[29:17.480 --> 29:22.400]  entertainment value it's painful and sad not that I'm attacked or that
[29:22.400 --> 29:26.840]  everybody spends their time doing that but that they're probably not government
[29:26.840 --> 29:32.200]  agents it's purely out of jealousy and envy of what that I work so hard that I
[29:32.200 --> 29:36.240]  was working last night and I'll be working tonight at 10 o'clock and that
[29:36.240 --> 29:40.520]  I'm so dedicated and then I have courage to go to Bilderberg I have courage
[29:40.520 --> 29:44.080]  because I know there's no future we're fighting for the future here we don't

[34:21.440 --> 34:27.000]  how stage terror would be used as a pretext to take over society how they
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.600]  would have surveillance equipment and all the light post I said that police
[34:30.600 --> 34:37.000]  state 2019 99 because we had the globalist plans now it's all happening
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.040]  there are a lot of people waking up but just because a lot of sheeple want to go
[34:41.040 --> 34:48.560]  along with it look you've 99% of people wanted to make the other 1% slaves
[34:48.560 --> 34:53.420]  they couldn't do it in a republic in a pure democracy they could that's two
[34:53.420 --> 34:56.360]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner what do you think's going to be
[34:56.360 --> 35:00.920]  on the dinner menu and I know that these are basic truths everybody knows but
[35:00.920 --> 35:04.920]  we've got to rediscover them and then get them out to other people but it's
[35:04.920 --> 35:09.240]  over 30% are very upset and now know about the New World Order conservatively
[35:09.240 --> 35:13.720]  most of those people are hardcore now we've got much bigger numbers than our
[35:13.720 --> 35:18.680]  founders had so so quit thinking that just because everybody is in a wake or
[35:18.680 --> 35:23.000]  a lot of people don't care that we've got to go along with this the globalists
[35:23.000 --> 35:28.600]  are scared and they have overreached okay let's go back to your calls Daniel in
[35:28.600 --> 35:33.360]  Michigan Daniel you're on the air yeah well calling old Jones hello this is
[35:33.360 --> 35:37.080]  Daniel um yeah I was wondering you know I'm not the person to show up at like a
[35:37.080 --> 35:42.560]  cheat build a cheese sandwich group whatever cuz I mean I'm sorry I don't
[35:42.560 --> 35:47.160]  understand you bro I don't speak German I know a few German words and I just
[35:47.160 --> 35:51.680]  don't understand you sorry I appreciate your call I just don't understand you we
[35:51.680 --> 35:55.200]  don't we don't screen calls but I'm not gonna play games with people I'm sorry
[35:55.200 --> 36:02.520]  Jesse and Louisiana you're on the air go ahead hey Alex how's it going good I
[36:02.520 --> 36:07.560]  I just want to call out to all the military on ex-military and with all
[36:07.560 --> 36:11.400]  the things that have been coming out with the internment camp documents and
[36:11.400 --> 36:16.160]  all of their plans and blueprints that you've very clearly laid out for us to
[36:16.160 --> 36:21.680]  see anybody who's been deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq has already seen
[36:21.680 --> 36:27.160]  these things happen and if they just looked at it from an objective standpoint
[36:27.160 --> 36:33.040]  and not from the tunnel vision that they were programmed to see it in they
[36:33.040 --> 36:37.440]  would see it and one of the things that really has me scared the most right now
[36:37.440 --> 36:42.320]  is the fact that when we went into Afghanistan and Iraq the first thing that
[36:42.320 --> 36:46.800]  happened was the banks were shut down for those countries there was no
[36:46.800 --> 36:52.880]  incremental weaning off there was no recession or inflation they just shut
[36:52.880 --> 36:57.600]  down and all of the people suffered because of it and the news is yet to
[36:57.600 --> 37:04.960]  cover anything regarding that well the people controlling our society will
[37:04.960 --> 37:10.840]  knowingly take two-year-olds that cry for mommy and put them on seven hard
[37:10.840 --> 37:16.160]  core psychotropics in many cases killing them they will take troops and put them
[37:16.160 --> 37:20.840]  in chambers US military and nerve gas you to death so of course this guy's the
[37:20.840 --> 37:24.920]  limit and everything would police the military business it's peer pressure
[37:24.920 --> 37:29.160]  they get you in they say we're patriotic we're the good guys it's all about
[37:29.160 --> 37:33.240]  conforming it's all about doing what you're told to go up the ladder well if
[37:33.240 --> 37:39.440]  that ladder leads into a woodchipper you don't want to conform you don't want to
[37:39.440 --> 37:45.200]  be trusting and we do not have our government anymore we have a spider
[37:45.200 --> 37:53.200]  hole and at the bottom of it is a human wrecking system and I totally agree with
[37:53.200 --> 37:58.240]  you now they've got MSNBC and CNBC saying oh Europe might collapse and have
[37:58.240 --> 38:01.960]  bank runs and they're already beginning in other areas this is all by design I
[38:01.960 --> 38:06.560]  said the euro will implode Europe they will gobble the countries up in this
[38:06.560 --> 38:10.760]  order always claiming more bailouts more money to the banks to fix the next
[38:10.760 --> 38:14.240]  country that's falling and then it will move to the United States this is a
[38:14.240 --> 38:22.520]  programmed plan and the only way it's going to stop because they could turn
[38:22.520 --> 38:26.640]  the economy on right now people have desire they have ingenuity people want
[38:26.640 --> 38:30.680]  to work hard the social engineers the Rockefellers and others brag their
[38:30.680 --> 38:35.320]  problem is there's too much prosperity they want to quote shut down the economy
[38:35.320 --> 38:38.560]  or the economy is overheating you always hear that they want to keep you in
[38:38.560 --> 38:43.760]  debt so anytime the system wanted to they could turn things back on but they
[38:43.760 --> 38:47.480]  don't want to because they want to consolidate to have full control it's
[38:47.480 --> 38:53.040]  about control and the only way to turn this around is to identify the globalist
[38:53.040 --> 38:57.680]  because if they know they're gonna get the blame and not sarcose you're not
[38:57.680 --> 39:02.320]  Merkel or not Obama not the puppets they will be forced to back off that's why
[39:02.320 --> 39:07.600]  I'm going to protest the actual rulers of the globe at Bilderberg and everybody
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.000]  needs to be there why do you think they lock down cities and have martial law
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.680]  even the London Guardian calls it martial law in Chicago for just some
[39:17.680 --> 39:20.920]  NATO people meeting when there's no reason to lock down half the city they
[39:20.920 --> 39:24.920]  could just lock down a few blocks it's an exercise of power why don't they do
[39:24.920 --> 39:28.800]  that for Bilderberg why are the police so nice in every Bilderberg event I've
[39:28.800 --> 39:33.440]  been to once you get past flying into the country because they don't want an
[39:33.440 --> 39:37.240]  incident this year is going to be different though my friend because
[39:37.240 --> 39:42.200]  there's so much attention are the alternative media is powerful enough now
[39:42.200 --> 39:45.640]  they're having to admit it exists because they're going to probably have the big
[39:45.640 --> 39:50.520]  numbers of police out there which is fine because this is going to end up
[39:50.520 --> 39:56.840]  generating massive attention go ahead absolutely and I actually work for the
[39:56.840 --> 40:05.080]  company that's hosting the palm tree conference and shantilly I think it was
[40:05.080 --> 40:09.160]  Lockheed Martin I think it was Lockheed Martin last time that she uses the front
[40:09.160 --> 40:16.200]  is it Lockheed Martin no I mean I'm with the hotel chain oh you're with the
[40:16.200 --> 40:23.280]  hotel chain yes and I mean I know that that place is completely booked despite
[40:23.280 --> 40:28.400]  what they told you on the phone the first time anyway I mean there's nothing
[40:28.400 --> 40:32.760]  getting into that place even as an associate of the hotel oh yeah but I
[40:32.760 --> 40:37.120]  mean listen that was that was the person who was just ignorant when they put me
[40:37.120 --> 40:41.440]  into booking they said oh there's rooms available oh I'm sorry it's all blocked
[40:41.440 --> 40:46.480]  off because it's all shut down but then the individual person with the code word
[40:46.480 --> 40:52.080]  has to file themselves in which has now been done no it is there it is there so
[40:52.080 --> 40:58.040]  so tell us is somebody that works for Marriott what's your info is well I mean
[40:58.040 --> 41:06.360]  I I can tell you that the company very much pressures its staff on discretion
[41:06.360 --> 41:11.360]  and not you know revealing personal information or anything going on never
[41:11.360 --> 41:18.920]  talking into anybody on the outside I mean there's a lot of there is huge
[41:18.920 --> 41:24.240]  credit card fraud targets so they have to you know abide by all these very strict
[41:24.240 --> 41:28.880]  guidelines but it seems like it seems that I was just going through a course
[41:28.880 --> 41:33.960]  that talked about you know monitoring people and reporting people that spend
[41:33.960 --> 41:39.080]  more than $10,000 or even $1,000 in a certain respect and how they didn't
[41:39.080 --> 41:44.520]  even have to tell the customer that they were being basically reported on now
[41:44.520 --> 41:49.520]  when you go to get a hotel room or you go to get a rent car it's like entering
[41:49.520 --> 41:55.680]  East Germany in 1972 they they are interrogating you they're asking you
[41:55.680 --> 42:00.680]  questions and this is the new society listen I went to Academy last night
[42:00.680 --> 42:05.760]  even shot video of it and I went to get a kayak with my son because he wants a
[42:05.760 --> 42:10.880]  kayak so we can put it in the back of the truck and go places and they
[42:10.880 --> 42:15.880]  bring out this giant form of who I am and numbers and driver's license and name

[42:36.400 --> 42:40.880]  said go get your manager and I said I can return this right now and they said
[42:40.880 --> 42:45.160]  well the police just want to know and we have to register it's nice a little

[44:55.960 --> 45:00.760]  sure they clearly understood you you have to come to me for anything you're
[45:00.760 --> 45:06.800]  gonna inject in my son's body and they looked at me like I was crazy even though
[45:06.800 --> 45:10.600]  on record they do it at the schools and the hospitals without asking you
[45:10.600 --> 45:14.880]  criminally well and they looked at me like I'm crazy because I didn't want
[45:14.880 --> 45:19.840]  them to arbitrarily inject my children with hepatitis no they just act like
[45:19.840 --> 45:23.680]  that though I mean the point is at the hospital they acted crazy every time
[45:23.680 --> 45:27.080]  then later the nurses go oh none of us do it and about half the people are
[45:27.080 --> 45:31.800]  saying no we're just told to act like that they it's all psych warfare it's
[45:31.800 --> 45:36.520]  all black ops man I mean you understand and we all just play along with the role

[45:58.040 --> 46:02.800]  joke man and I love America but we got to admit what pathetic losers we are I
[46:02.800 --> 46:07.840]  mean land of the freedom of the brave what a joke I saw so many cop cars
[46:07.840 --> 46:11.640]  driving in this morning I mean this country is gone okay I appreciate your
[46:11.640 --> 46:17.760]  call you know you ought to feel good seeing police oh like when I'm in Mexico
[46:17.760 --> 46:23.200]  or Guatemala no you don't feel good you know and again the average police officer
[46:23.200 --> 46:27.160]  may not be bad but they're directed I mean you know a cop pulls you over and
[46:27.160 --> 46:32.480]  the question start or anywhere you see them they're looking at you they're
[46:32.480 --> 46:36.200]  assessing it it's like man you think you're smart because you're with the
[46:36.200 --> 46:40.200]  government they're like little kids playing that they're superheroes or
[46:40.200 --> 46:45.280]  something and it's just like don't you get it I happen to be behind the curtain
[46:45.280 --> 46:50.240]  I've seen it all I've taken the red pill and I can't play patty cake with you
[46:50.240 --> 46:56.800]  anymore I was talking to Dave Mustaine's wife about the last time they flew out
[46:56.800 --> 47:00.080]  and now they groped their 14 year old daughter and all this and when they
[47:00.080 --> 47:08.240]  opted out they they stuck them over in an area and made them wait you know 10
[47:08.240 --> 47:11.680]  15 minutes it came over and sort of laughing at him going still opting out
[47:11.680 --> 47:16.680]  still opting out as I was driving them to the airport this weekend and I was
[47:16.680 --> 47:21.700]  telling the story of my crew when they flew out when the looks like the
[47:21.700 --> 47:24.480]  military was involved murdered that guy because he has chickens in his backyard
[47:24.480 --> 47:30.120]  up in Georgia the chicken man and I was telling a story about yeah my guys
[47:30.120 --> 47:34.800]  opted out of the naked body scanner so they let them there for like 35 minutes
[47:34.800 --> 47:37.800]  kept coming over and saying oh you hopped out you hopped out and Pam was
[47:37.800 --> 47:41.320]  halfway listening she went oh I told you that story yeah that's what they did I
[47:41.320 --> 47:45.480]  went oh no they did that to you she hadn't so the standard thing is a little
[47:45.480 --> 47:49.720]  Psyop joke with a citizen that doesn't want to go on a illegal naked body
[47:49.720 --> 47:53.120]  scanner that isn't even certified on record gives you cancer and they save
[47:53.120 --> 47:57.600]  your naked image and they grope you on top of it that was always the plan it's
[47:57.600 --> 48:02.240]  about getting in your space and they sit there and come over and laugh at my crew
[48:02.240 --> 48:07.000]  and go you still opting out might miss your flight you still just making them
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.720]  sit there for a total of 40 minutes they almost missed their flight I mean
[48:10.720 --> 48:18.480]  this is scum imagine the scum that they've hired who are running this
[48:18.480 --> 48:22.600]  administrative chairing and all over the country now when you hopped out they
[48:22.600 --> 48:26.080]  try to make you miss your flight so get there an hour early and you take up their
[48:26.080 --> 48:29.840]  time and you just sit there and speak out about that you should bring like
[48:29.840 --> 48:34.440]  New York Times Associated Press all the major scientific firms John Hopkins you
[48:34.440 --> 48:38.720]  name it because they tell those idiots that worked there that oh John Hopkins
[48:38.720 --> 48:43.880]  says John Hopkins says the radiation safe so what you do is you go really and
[48:43.880 --> 48:47.800]  you just pull out of your back pocket I have the Associated Press that it
[48:47.800 --> 48:51.960]  actually massive cancer increases cancer clusters at Boston Logan where they
[48:51.960 --> 48:56.720]  first put the scanners in eight years ago and and just make and believe me it
[48:56.720 --> 49:01.480]  you run your reverse Psyop but with the truth they got lies intimidation you just
[49:01.480 --> 49:06.000]  take off the cloak and reveal the light and they'll just like absolutely fall
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.240]  to their knees and just believe me you'll suddenly be right through real fast
[49:09.240 --> 49:14.040]  oh whoa let's get you right through here you're not gonna let us just win and
[49:14.040 --> 49:20.040]  sit on you and dominate you and run you through a breaking process you know I
[49:20.040 --> 49:24.160]  was watching a Steve McQueen movie this weekend running on the treadmill called
[49:24.160 --> 49:27.960]  Papillon and it's a composite based on a lot of true things that happened on
[49:27.960 --> 49:32.320]  Devil's Island where for they said you stole over bread you know 30 years hard
[49:32.320 --> 49:36.760]  labor and swamps with malaria and you know they talk about we're here to break
[49:36.760 --> 49:40.120]  you and everything that's going on in that based on what really went on at
[49:40.120 --> 49:44.600]  Devil's Island is breaking people that's what this is there's conscious

[54:21.080 --> 54:25.760]  update from Derrick Bros it made national news a few weeks ago when the
[54:25.760 --> 54:30.640]  TSA as they do in many other cities began running checkpoints and searching
[54:30.640 --> 54:35.520]  people on the streets and at bus stations and bus stops searching bags
[54:35.520 --> 54:39.160]  violating the Fourth Amendment and the cops were like well the feds are here
[54:39.160 --> 54:43.000]  so they wave a magic wand there's no rights we're keeping you safe from al-
[54:43.000 --> 54:48.960]  qaeda the people that publicly work for TSA and the globalist so we're going to
[54:48.960 --> 54:53.720]  be going over that and Derrick Bros is founding member of Houston Free Thinkers
[54:53.720 --> 54:58.280]  and partner we are change Houston we really appreciate him coming on the
[54:58.280 --> 55:01.960]  show popping in with a quick update because I've seen the videos online from
[55:01.960 --> 55:06.040]  city council and what's happening they're now backtracking and it's been
[55:06.040 --> 55:09.000]  pointed out that what they did is illegal but I think some of the victims
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.680]  need to sue the city to make sure this doesn't happen anymore because the
[55:12.680 --> 55:18.000]  creeping death of the bankers that poses the federal government is marching on
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.800]  so break down what happened in Houston and now the aftermath of the feds
[55:22.800 --> 55:29.840]  groping people hey Alex yeah so back in April we had a member of the group
[55:29.840 --> 55:33.960]  Philip Levine he happened to be at the right bus stop at the right time and he
[55:33.960 --> 55:38.160]  witnessed a press conference being held by Sheila Jackson Lee a representative
[55:38.160 --> 55:43.280]  from out here representatives from the TSA Harris County Police Houston Police
[55:43.280 --> 55:49.120]  Department Metro Police and of course the DHS holding a press conference
[55:49.120 --> 55:53.360]  announcing the beginning of a national pilot program called bus safe which is a
[55:53.360 --> 55:57.120]  counter-terror program and Houston was the first city they were going to do it
[55:57.120 --> 56:02.320]  on and it included TSA getting on buses asking people where they're going
[56:02.320 --> 56:06.520]  checking their IDs and the original press release said that there was going to be
[56:06.520 --> 56:13.600]  random bag searches dogs on the buses as well as undercover officers riding the
[56:13.600 --> 56:17.400]  buses we got pictures of this as well we have pictures of TSA inspectors
[56:17.400 --> 56:22.080]  questioning people and after after it happened we put out an article put the
[56:22.080 --> 56:26.680]  information out and almost immediately lawyers from this from Houston also
[56:26.680 --> 56:30.920]  jumped on the case and in Metro said they made a mistake and that there were no
[56:30.920 --> 56:34.840]  random bag searches that that was a mistake and a press release although we
[56:34.840 --> 56:38.640]  do believe that to be false oh no yeah it's all silent I mean no they can burn
[56:38.640 --> 56:41.560]  down a church at wake up and say they're not assaulting it because you're the
[56:41.560 --> 56:45.320]  enemy it's all about deception against their enemy by way of deception the
[56:45.320 --> 56:50.800]  new world order dominates this country but continuing again they lie and always
[56:50.800 --> 56:54.240]  say you're the first city they've been doing it in Boston New York Dallas San
[56:54.240 --> 57:00.400]  Francisco they're preparing a nationwide rollout yeah definitely in this and
[57:00.400 --> 57:04.280]  that's why we wanted to stand up against this and try to put it put a stop to it
[57:04.280 --> 57:08.160]  as it as they rolled it out so we put that article out mark Bennett a local
[57:08.160 --> 57:13.320]  lawyer out here he started attacking Metro police chief through his blog and
[57:13.320 --> 57:18.000]  calling him out for for the lies and so everybody planned to go to the Metro
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.960]  board meeting and we did that members of the Houston free thinkers we are
[57:20.960 --> 57:24.760]  changed the Harris County criminal lawyers Association we pretty much took
[57:24.760 --> 57:28.560]  over that board meeting during the public speaking time and at the beginning
[57:28.560 --> 57:31.360]  of the meeting one of the board members said basically he had no idea this is
[57:31.360 --> 57:35.320]  going on so the people that are the head of Metro out here don't even know what's
[57:35.320 --> 57:39.160]  happening in their own company no it's the bureaucracy and again an inspector
[57:39.160 --> 57:43.440]  in intake the New York system is like one of the highest levels of police
[57:43.440 --> 57:49.040]  officer and is actually over police in many cases controlling them as kind of
[57:49.040 --> 57:53.200]  an internal affairs to call these TSA people inspectors when they're not
[57:53.200 --> 57:58.600]  even peace officers it's all a giant criminal fraud it's a federalization
[57:58.600 --> 58:03.400]  takeover under the guise of the terror they staged yes definitely that's that's
[58:03.400 --> 58:07.120]  what we were there to tell them I chose to speak as well as other members of the
[58:07.120 --> 58:10.360]  group and we told them that this they're creating an atmosphere of fear that
[58:10.360 --> 58:13.880]  this is all about paranoia getting everybody to be suspecting of terrorists
[58:13.880 --> 58:19.240]  and this and that so we took over the meeting that day and they said because
[58:19.240 --> 58:21.760]  of that they would set up a special committee meeting where we could talk
[58:21.760 --> 58:26.760]  specifically just about the TSA issue and the local news covered the story we
[58:26.760 --> 58:30.520]  got some more coverage because of that and that was a few weeks back and just
[58:30.520 --> 58:34.360]  stay there come back because now they're saying they're gonna back off but at
[58:34.360 --> 58:40.000]  least for now what you've done is the model for the rest of the country

[59:57.800 --> 01:00:09.920]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:18.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.840]  Jones
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.720]  all right Derek Rose is our guest and he'll give you his website before he
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.320]  leaves us in about five minutes you can go there and see some of the videos of
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:37.640]  these metro meetings they're fighting the TSA takeover you think you're just
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.320]  not going to fly they're coming to your town your area they say they're going to
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:46.720]  end up being in rural areas soon and they're the local political officers and
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.320]  they admit their new mission is libertarians and conservatives you are
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.320]  terrorists meanwhile the federal government publicly funds and runs Al
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:59.120]  Qaeda now not even hidden that's how dumb they think you are so Derek where are we
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.760]  now with this because from what I was reading there they claim they're going
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:07.400]  to back off on this but from my experience they'll do that till resistance
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:11.960]  dissipates or they'll stage a little firecracker bomb or something to sell
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:15.560]  everybody that you've got to have TSA on the streets of Houston grabbing your
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.000]  genitals yeah so that's that's kind of what we're worried about Alex but
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.120]  definitely we're not going to give up the resistance to it the last action that
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.600]  happened was the special committee meeting this past week dealing
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.160]  specifically with the TSA and Metro so again we went up there more the lawyers
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:35.720]  showed up to ask questions we were allowed to speak directly to the chief of
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:40.120]  Metro police and to the board that was there and asked questions and a lot of
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:44.960]  interesting things came up for one the press release was updated and it said
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.040]  that although they said there was back searches none of them were done that the
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.840]  chief of police decided not to go forth with it so one of the questions we had
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:57.120]  for them was who was leading this if they approach TSA or if the TSA and DHS
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.800]  approached them and they also seem to believe that they can work with the TSA
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.920]  and the TSA will listen to them they promise that there would be no Metro
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.080]  back searches and we told them but that doesn't mean the TSA won't do it because
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.680]  obviously the TSA does whatever it wants it doesn't listen to Congress they
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:15.000]  don't listen to the Department for now there are a bunch of crooks on power
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.040]  trips that want to molest our children and who work for people that stage the
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:22.200]  9-11 attacks they're terrorist they are the terrorist takeover army and again
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:27.120]  America bag searches at bus terminals and a little bus stops on the side of the
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.760]  road and highway checkpoints TSA is running that's a lie when Sheila Jackson
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.120]  Lee said it was the first city to be done and it's being done everywhere but a
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:40.480]  lying pig yeah we're not very fond of her she's definitely behind pushing the
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.080]  TSA and their agenda another interesting thing that came up is they said that
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:49.440]  Metro was asking people for their IDs and for their bus cards to check to see
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.520]  if they were sharing cards which I didn't know was illegal and the cards
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.600]  don't even have your name on it so that was a lie as well no see that's
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:01.040]  terrorism right there the terrorism is sucking money out of us they're the
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.840]  ones terrorizing us I'm sorry go ahead no that's 100% true and they said that
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.680]  TSA was not asking anybody questions or but we have pictures that prove otherwise
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.000]  that those are all available on Houston free thinkers calm our article about it
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.760]  people can check that out and we asked the chief though why what would make
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.280]  make one of the officers choose to ask somebody questions what would make them
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:25.240]  suspicious and when the chief was listing off suspicious behavior one of
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:28.840]  the things he said was that if somebody was throwing away trash that looks
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:33.120]  suspicious the officer might come ask them questions and so now throwing away
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:39.040]  trash is suspicious behavior according to the Metro once you put up with this
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.720]  it's going to be checkpoints and body scanners they already put body
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:47.080]  scanners in and bus terminals and areas of Florida it's a takeover it's check
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:51.840]  points on the highways they're buying armored pill boxes and and hundreds of
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.880]  millions of hollow point ammo they're coming after us the bankers are coming
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.160]  after us this is a foreign army this is a foreign army this is their beachhead
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.720]  yeah with the with the final action of it Alex was after the discussing this
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.840]  with them for a while the lawyers that were there also told them that if they
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.000]  chose to go forward to this they would be facing lawsuits that the lawyers were
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.440]  confident they could win based on them violating people's constitutional rights
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:18.200]  so there was a lot of talk of the Constitution and we were able to get a
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.840]  statement from the Metro Police Department and from Metro themselves
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.840]  that they would not invite the TSA back they did say that the TSA would be
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.920]  wouldn't be back unless there was a nationally significant event like the
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.240]  Super Bowl or something or maybe a false flag and another interesting part of
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.400]  that is you know the same day we were having this meeting on another bus in
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:43.360]  the city somebody held another bus passenger hostage with the gun and HPD
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.080]  had to shoot them on the bus so who knows if that'll be used for justification
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.760]  to bring the TSA probably stage listen God bless you we're going to a full

[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:18.680]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:23.040]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:26.800]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.920]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.880]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:47.400]  intel on what's happening with Obama and the whole birth certificate situation
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:52.480]  and his publicist for 16 plus years saying he was born in Kenyon because
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:57.720]  Obama had given her that info that's where your publicist gets that and all
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.440]  the different police state measures that are being brought forward with one of
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:05.240]  the rules coming up to 30 minutes in an update from the NATO summit the police
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:10.800]  state slave training summit that's going on up in the mafia kingdom of Chicago
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:16.760]  that is coming up also in the next hour you know I saw this article yesterday
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:21.880]  London independent Britain arrested in Thailand after being found with six
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:27.360]  roasted human fetuses a British man in Bangkok has been arrested after Thai
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:32.680]  police found six roasted human fetuses packed in his luggage
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:39.800]  Chow Hong Koon who's 28 of the Taiwanese origin was held by police after the
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.640]  grizzly discovery was made in the Bangkok Chinatown district yesterday
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.920]  reports say that six fetuses have been covered in gold leaf after being
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:53.520]  roasted as part of a black magic ritual it's not clear where the bodies came
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:58.640]  from but Chow Hong Koon is believed to have attempted to smuggle them into
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:05.360]  Taiwan the bodies were reportedly found in different hotel from the one he was
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.840]  staying at but were in his luggage and it goes on to say it was being advertised
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:15.800]  on a black magic website now here's another one thousands of pills filled
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.800]  with powdered human baby flesh discovered by customs officials in South
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.080]  Korea and of course you know last year it came out and then again this year in
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:30.960]  federal court shareholders wanted to block PepsiCo from using fetus cells as
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.600]  flavoring and I heard this like a year ago that this can't be true and then
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:39.960]  sure enough it was and the Obama different federal departments that were
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:44.200]  involved went and argued to the courts no the company doesn't have to do what
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:50.280]  shareholders say so you should understand that and there's a reason they're
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:55.720]  wanting to put baby parts in the food it's not that I believe in this that the
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:00.280]  the Illuminati believes they're corrupting you when they do this and
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:04.720]  they believe that if they can get you to take part in something bad even unknowingly
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:08.520]  that it gives them power and that's why they want to kill babies and roast them
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:14.360]  that's actually if you you can buy copies of 500 year old black magic books
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.800]  we've actually purchased them and to research them in my research of the
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.640]  occult and it describes how you burn the child and supposed to really burn them
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.640]  down to ashes but I guess people like to eat them partially roasted and and all
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:32.560]  the other things they do and this is all done in a quest for power and people are
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:37.000]  like oh well big deal you know let the major cosmetic makers have baby parts in
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.960]  them and let collagen for women's lips a lot of it come from melted down babies
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.760]  and let people eat mainly women because they think it makes them pretty baby
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.640]  it's like mirror mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all it's the
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:56.600]  old thing of one of Lodian paler's progeny she would bathe in blood of
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.360]  children they chopped their head off and then have the blood shoot in while she
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.920]  was in a bath of water she thought it made her skin pretty and that's pretty
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:07.760]  much the norm the druids the Aztecs every culture likes to roast and kill
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.040]  kids that's why in the Bible it says give not your children the fires of
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:17.680]  Moloch all those surrounding areas entire in the Middle East they would they
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.280]  would they would bring the babies up and throw them on to an oven kind of like
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:28.120]  a you know big oven top that you would cook eggs on a restaurant a big brass or
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:35.520]  metal flat top that would be on top arms of a deity it would be holding the the
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.560]  stove top in its hands and then you would just grill the babies on there
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:44.280]  and people would bring them up most cultures said firstborn must be roasted
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:50.600]  roasting of babies is a human pastime it's every culture likes to roast babies
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:56.160]  that is every culture that gets this this psychopath guild in control it's
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.400]  like a tropism like the way a seed gets water on it and heat from the sun it
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:04.640]  germinates it opens it comes to the surface it turns towards the light
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:10.680]  every society every culture ends up manifesting an elite that want to cut
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:16.160]  the hearts out of children or burn them and that's where you get bonfires
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:20.880]  bonfire comes from bonfire that's in the main line in psychopedia and all over
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.680]  Europe they dig up huge areas just with all these bones of children for the
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:30.680]  public roasting but it's also a delicious meat and again all this is going on
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:34.880]  this is the people that run things and in fact guys will you bring me a copy of
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:39.840]  bloodlines the Illuminati I forgot and don't it's back in print we're the folks
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.680]  that have it at info wars.com and your purchase also supports the show but
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.920]  that's why I wanted to get Fritz Springer on about other issues he wanted to
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:50.760]  cover about how they're turning the medical system into a tyranny but
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.160]  because of all this coming up in the news I thought we'd bring that up but
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:58.480]  bloodlines the Illuminati goes over this it was the first book I read more than
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:06.760]  15 years ago around 15 years ago that said Prince Charles is direct descendant
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.880]  of Vlad the Impaler and thinks he's a vampire and goes around doing all this
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:14.040]  and then now it's all over the news Prince Charles loves Vlad says he's a
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.600]  direct bloodline owns of Castle in Transylvania and spends a lot of his time
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.040]  running around the woods at night because he thinks he's Vlad the Impaler and
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.600]  then it turns out they are not even a German bloodline but a Transylvanian
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:29.520]  bloodline and then that itself goes back into antiquity but here it is bloodlines
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.360]  the Illuminati Fritz Springer it was out of print we had it reprinted for Fritz
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:40.200]  and it's available at info wars.com I should add and it's just full of stuff
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:44.040]  that's over the top I read this 15 years ago and didn't believe a lot of it and
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:49.080]  then over the time I would kept running into pieces of the book in mainstream
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:54.240]  news just a last year of the Daily Mail reported on the Royals eating body
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.880]  parts and they still got groom of the stool and all this so see they're
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:03.240]  predators they see you as an animal you're their favorite dish the more
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.480]  pain to children the better and they've turned the murder of children into a
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:10.480]  procedure they grab your two-year-old the two-year-old cries they give it
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:15.120]  drugs prozac riddle and other things until the child goes into convulsions
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.840]  then they put them on anti-psychotics then the child dies that's a good kill
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:23.880]  that's a good kill so that counts and I remember Fritz talking about these
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:29.240]  abortuaries are really doing sacrifices a decade ago and then now it came out in
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:33.440]  the news people are getting arrested for saving the babies eating them doing
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:37.320]  rituals with them they'll keep the cat alive in a partial birth put it to the
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:41.360]  side and sacrifice it a few days later you know they'll take care of it just to
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.400]  I mean it's a big business because they think they're getting power they really
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.720]  just like to hurt innocent children you want to take care of them and love them
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:51.960]  and build them up they want to torture them something fierce while they scream
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:55.440]  and cry but that better than a newborn baby the screw up crying is it enough
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:58.600]  they like a three-year-old or a four-year-old who can really beg for
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.400]  mommy just like the police torturing Kelly Thomas to death begging for daddy
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.280]  that's their song that tears your heart out that to a Satanist is like
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:13.000]  ambrosia that is the ether in which they swim the pain of the innocence okay
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.080]  and again people can't handle this because of their normalcy bias their
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:24.600]  cognitive dissidents the mass Stockholm syndrome that were under the learned
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:28.160]  helplessness but I'm here to break that Fritz Springmeyer thank you for coming
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:33.440]  on shifting gears here with you today again tell us about why the elite love
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:38.520]  to hurt children so much and why you from your research every culture who
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:42.520]  gets these elites in power starts mass public murder of children what is it
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:46.200]  about murdering children ordering the first born to be killed as ancient
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:52.400]  cultures all basically did what is it about this the child is innocent so
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:57.280]  that makes the sacrifice even more powerful you're you're taking what's
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:05.760]  pure and sacrificing it it's the supreme sacrifice and also it's just the
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:12.600]  concept of taking something beautiful and dirtying it some people you know if
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:16.720]  they're walking along the beach and they see a sandcastle they have the
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:23.680]  irresistible urge to go over and kick your Skype cut off for a minute
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:28.120]  your Skype cut out they have an irresistible urge to do what your
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:33.440]  resistible urge to dirty what's beautiful you know if someone's some
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:38.200]  times you you may have noticed somebody walking along the beach and there's a
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:46.120]  sandcastle there and they can't resist walking over and kicking it it's the
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:53.360]  concept of taking something pure and innocent and spoiling it and we see this
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:18:00.280]  around us we we see so much on this beautiful planet that's being spoiled
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:08.920]  and it's all part of the same mindset well that's why now even HBO has five
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:15.160]  and four-year-old girls doing sexual acts on TV with giant objects but they
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:21.080]  say that's okay and that we're just square because we don't like it yeah it's
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:27.440]  it's to to pervert it's to destroy it's it's to run and what's nice and clean
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:38.000]  and pure I remember on the microcosm meeting a man who he had met a nun and
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:45.920]  because this nun was pure and clean he had this irresistible urge to spoil her
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:51.920]  and and he only seduced her just so that he could spoil her and and then once he
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:58.040]  had earned her why he threw her away this is the type of mindset we're
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:02.860]  dealing on the macrocosm the irresistible urge like turning the light on at
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:08.280]  midnight finding a big cockroach on the floor to bash these people's brains up
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:16.680]  and and the extension of this is is if they will do it to innocent little

[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:18.320]  the front lines of the info war I was talking to one of our nightly news
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:23.720]  reporters and anchors Darren McBreen by the way folks we've gone through the
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:28.800]  600 700 videos that came in for the reporter contest I'm trying to watch
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:32.880]  him when I'm on the road driving to Bilderberg I'm gonna try to watch hundreds
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:37.680]  of them and get it down to the top 10 or so and then we're gonna put the top 10
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:41.280]  out and let you guys vote on them that won't be binding but just to give us an
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:46.200]  idea of what you think for the reporter contest but McBreen was talking about
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:49.440]  having to go to Walmart to get something that wasn't anywhere else and he went
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:53.800]  through the children's aisles you know going someplace in there and it was all
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:59.280]  little dolls with tiny mini skirts and dressed like hookers and they've had
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.520]  Nickelodeon brass a few years ago come out and say we're now gonna target the
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:10.680]  pre-teen with sexual stuff and again it's meant to wreck your children my
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:14.440]  children are so innocent compared to other children their age but they know
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.880]  about science and literature and mathematics and the things that are
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:23.880]  good in the world but they don't know about you know demon conjuring video
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:28.560]  games and stuff and so people that actually at a young age learn about the
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.360]  world it actually stunts them and that's what the system's looking for is
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:37.560]  basically ruining people before they develop discernment comments on that
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:45.600]  Fritz Bringmeyer you're 100% correct you're you're very eloquent today and
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:52.720]  describing all of this and I've noticed it too what you're saying how how we
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:26:01.920]  have this targeting of the children in sex and violence and with
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:06.880]  Prozac and everything else I mean but but what about the dungeon keeper stuff
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.320]  where they admit the CPS grabs children and then drugs them till they
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:21.360]  basically die yeah and a whole generation is being given Ritalin and
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:28.440]  things like this so that they're you know I've met people that became drug
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:33.040]  addicts because they were given Ritalin in school oh they admit that yeah that's
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:42.000]  the plan yeah and it's it's over the top now now you wanted to get into medical
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:50.760]  stuff why do they want to adulterate our bodies well one thing it's a it's how
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:57.920]  you control people as long as people are sick and having problems thinking
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:04.120]  straight why they're easier to control and also besides being able to control
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:13.040]  them by making sure that we're all constantly getting sick we become
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:18.800]  dependent upon their medical system their medical system extracts large
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:26.880]  amounts of money from us and you'll notice that surgery and drugs are their
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:33.960]  medical methodologies of choice because that's what they make money off of
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:38.760]  something that they can't make money off of and make us dependent on them like
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:46.360]  these alternative medical methods that would actually heal us and be inexpensive
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:55.720]  and something that we could use and control ourselves they suppress so so
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:00.640]  you we see that the American Medical Association and some of these other
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:05.280]  organizations that the general population think are there to protect them
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:15.000]  are actually working more as a mafia you know to you know like like the FDA and
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  you had Dr. Whittaker on your show before and a lot of these people that
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.720]  are coming up with good alternatives things that that will actually help us
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:32.920]  are being ran out of town they're they're being put in jail they're they're
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:37.520]  having their careers run well Fred's notice that when we made the American
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.160]  Medical Association and it fluoride shouldn't be used in children six or
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:45.000]  younger because it causes fluorosis not to mention cancer suddenly it was all
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.680]  over the shelves in more toothpaste and bottled water fluoride for kids but it's
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:55.280]  just like all the sugar gum now all of it at the store I mean there could be a
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:00.400]  hundred brands has aspartame in it and I see these little kids buying it knowing
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:04.640]  it's an excitotoxin and very deadly basically wood alcohol and the kids all
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:07.720]  look unhealthy they're getting it by the way and I've just I've gotten where I
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.480]  just say hey you know that's got aspartame in it that's gonna hurt your
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:14.360]  child and sometimes the parents get mad at me but I don't care I'm just gonna
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:18.440]  make scenes everywhere Fritz I'm done that's what everybody needs to do make
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:23.560]  scenes everywhere break the silence break the normalcy bias warn people stay
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:26.320]  there I want to come back and look at this because it's more than just that
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.960]  they're obsessed with defiling our temple they believe that if they can do
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:35.440]  that they can control us and their control freaks they love the fact that
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:40.000]  they know that they're poisoning us through the food the water the air it's
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.860]  a big joke to them I want to ask you where is it all leading Fritz spring

[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:28.640]  no meaning I am a human being words mr. Wordsworth that have no substance and
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:34.800]  no dimension like air like a wind I don't care I tell you I don't care I'm a
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:41.800]  human being I exist if I speak one for a loud that thought lives even after I'm
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:34:00.800]  shoveled into my great delusions mr. Wordsworth delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all you have nothing but spindly limbs of a dream and the state has no use for your crime
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:21.800]  resistance to tyrants his obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:25.440]  we're back live ladies and gentlemen about to go back to Fritz Springmeyer and
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:30.120]  just take some of your phone calls by the way I'm really into books that are out
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:34.960]  of print they're seminal and bloodlines the Luminati was out of print and so we

[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:46.360]  reprint I found out the one lone little publisher and he's got well not gonna
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:50.600]  get into the personal stuff this book is basically going out of print could be
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:54.080]  going out of print it's very hard to get it's very expensive it sells for as much
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:59.760]  as $200 on some of the websites out there where we're selling it for right
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:03.160]  above what we bought it for so we're selling it at a price to get these out
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:07.520]  to everybody unabridged tragedy and hope a history of the world in our time
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:12.960]  Carol Quigley and it goes on a definitive work of the world's power
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:17.360]  structure this book only a few thousand got printed the elite had the plates
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:21.000]  destroyed we've got news clips of Quigley complaining the book got out it was only
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.200]  meant for the elite to understand the minds that are shaping the world read
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.600]  the book that shapes their minds and it's got Bill Clinton quoted here here's
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:31.440]  Carol Quigley the powers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching plan
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:35.880]  nothing less than create a world system of financial control in private hands
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:41.160]  able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:45.400]  world as a whole Carol Quigley and I have articles here where they can't even
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:51.080]  come out with the movie Red Dawn the remake because it had communist Chinese
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:57.080]  invading America with Latin Americans so they had to spend something like a
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:03.600]  million dollars I was reading to re-edit it as North Koreans and still it may
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:08.040]  not come out because China's putting pressure and I have USA today with the
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:11.640]  Chinese government saying we want to influence the American people we've just
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:17.360]  bought the biggest theater chain in the United States and we want to buy up the
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:20.960]  media to influence the people they don't even but I mean so what let the
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:23.800]  communist Chinese run the media it's already foreign banks that run our
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:29.160]  media I mean this is so off the charts but tragedy and hope a history of the
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:33.400]  world in our time Carol Quigley is available at info wars.com your
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:38.080]  purchase also supports the broadcast you get a free citizen rulebook with it and
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:43.400]  bumper stickers but look I mean they're a nice plastic when you get it shrink
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:50.040]  wrapped heavy-duty shrink wrap I mean this is a nice nice nice book and it
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:56.840]  is I've been going for memory saying a thousand pages it's 1300 pages long it's
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:06.520]  got maps in it and stuff it's over 1300 pages 13148 pages and I don't expect you
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:10.800]  to read the whole thing but it's important to have this because this was
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:14.120]  given the State Department and CIA people who couldn't understand we're
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:20.480]  funding communist and fascist how does this work well it works by full-spectrum
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:24.440]  dominance the bankers fund all the major sides as long as they call for big
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:28.720]  government that's like Mitt Romney Barack Obama tragedy and hope available
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:32.240]  bloodlines the limonade these two books together if I got a combo I'm gonna go
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:34.960]  tell them to combo them and discount them both even more if you get both
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:41.080]  together at info wars.com okay I've been ranting here at Fritz continuing why do
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:45.480]  they want to adulterate the body what are ways they're doing this and in the
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.720]  news today what are some of the main things you're looking at and again
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:57.320]  where does the Illuminati want to take us okay as you were saying earlier
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:01.760]  before we took our break that you're gonna ask where some of this was
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:07.800]  leading and I would call people's attention to the fact that the United
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:14.360]  States is the world's reserve currency and China would like to dethrone the
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:19.560]  United States as the world's reserve currency if it was just China I might
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:26.440]  not be so concerned but I know that the Illuminati the top financiers in the
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:34.120]  world the powers that be financially want to destroy the US dollar and so
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:40.720]  they want to dethrone the United United States's dollar from being the world's
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:46.040]  reserve currency what does that mean for us what it means is is throughout our
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:52.600]  lifetime we've had all of these people saying that the US economy is out of
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:57.880]  control you know our government's overspending and and that this house of
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:03.240]  cards is gonna collapse but it never collapses and we haven't become a third
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:08.520]  world country like Brazil or Argentina or you know our economy hasn't collapsed
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:13.800]  like Argentina why not because other countries come to our rescue and buy our
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:20.120]  debt because we're the world's reserve currency but there's a move now to take
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:26.120]  that away from us once we're dethroned as the world's reserve currency then
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:32.720]  there's nothing to to really stabilize the dollar from hyperinflation once
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:39.120]  we're into hyperinflation we're into serious problems and this is where
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:48.200]  having poor health comes into play because people that do not get adequate
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:56.600]  nutrition are now ripe for something like an epidemic influenza or or or some
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:03.880]  other epidemic and you can historically go back and see when when there were
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:10.000]  famines the elite would follow that famine with an epidemic and and then
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.480]  you would have major population decreases and by the way we have ignorant
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:18.640]  people listening it might be new listeners even the Huns and others would
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:22.800]  catapult rotten plague bodies over walls they were sieging and they knew
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:27.600]  about plague thousands of years ago and how to use it it's in British Army
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:33.560]  manuals from 300 years ago you know how to lance pox boils and put it on blankets
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:40.200]  and give it to Indians you want to kill so you're absolutely right about that so
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:48.280]  you know the bottom line is is population control and genocide the
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:58.600]  useless eaters as as certain people view them will be decreased in numbers on the
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:05.000]  flip side those of us who believe in it and a wonderful creator he said that
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.520]  according in his word he said according as his divine power has given unto us
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:16.480]  all things that pertain into life and godliness so what I'm calling people
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:22.720]  attention to is everything we need for godliness everything need for health and
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:30.000]  life has been provided we need to identify those things and see how those
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.600]  things are being taken away from us for instance they started to eradicate
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:42.000]  irradiating the meat and taking away essential amino acids and spraying
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.320]  viruses on the meat now they spray special viruses on the meat folks I'm
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:57.240]  not joking right and and then you've got your genetic modification of things
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:03.040]  this all works together because you have beef and grain monopolies you have
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:09.400]  these bloodlines having food cartels these cartels have gone way back for you
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:16.600]  know families like Cargill, Bundy, Bunch, McMillian, Andre, Agnelli, Nestle,
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:22.640]  Riconti these these families go way back hundreds of years and so the food
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:29.680]  supply being controlled plays a role in the next stage which is the medical
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:35.560]  system being controlled all working together well think how cold-blooded it
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:39.760]  is they know there's a backlash against fluoridation so now it's everywhere
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.680]  fluoride your kids I was in CVS yesterday and they had loudspeakers going
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:48.880]  saying get your church or your work discounts with the flu shot flu ads
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:52.880]  everywhere fluoride for babies everywhere they know devastates their brain
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:58.240]  aspartame gum I mean this is so cold-blooded they just want to hurt
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:09.760]  people yes and if if you don't follow the program then they have ways to come
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:17.200]  and monitor that and for instance when I was teaching school when I was Amish
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:26.000]  the county discovered the this Procure school and the this lady County
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.440]  official came in and she said I want you to provide me the names of all the
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:38.480]  parents who are not getting all of the shots for their children well I had some
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:45.080]  parents that due to their conscience would not allow their children to have
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:51.000]  all of these shots and and so I couldn't in good conscience provide her I was not
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:56.720]  going to be the the enforcer for the system and I did not give her the names
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:04.200]  of those families listen I went to buy a kayak yesterday and they have an
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:08.320]  academy and they want you to fill out all this stuff about you and and your
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:13.480]  and and your all this data and I've said no and they said well the police like
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:18.400]  to have it I mean this country you can't even buy a little boat now because you
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:22.640]  might be a terrorist I mean it's so ridiculous fritz but then it's admitted
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:27.640]  that al-qaeda works for the US government in the news I mean it's just all
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:32.320]  hiding in plain view how much crazier what do you expect from your research is
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:35.720]  about to happen with all the world meltdowns and world government being
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:39.480]  announced and the media admitting Bilderberg runs things and and with all
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:46.080]  this craziness what's gonna happen next well the the biggest thing that's
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:53.400]  facing us here in in America is the destruction of our money and when a win
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:45:00.120]  when our dollar is worthless that's going to have so many wide-ranging
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:06.800]  ramifications including a riots that's why you see a lot of things being done
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:16.360]  to prepare for riots and our whole lives are going to be turned upside down
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:22.840]  and and because of that people need to start listening to the kind of things
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:32.120]  that you're telling them you know they need to start taking they need to be
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:37.680]  responsible for their own health don't depend upon the medical system which is
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:44.320]  really not there to help you anyway it's there to make money for the the people
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:51.880]  that control it they need to need to start identifying those things out
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:56.800]  there the products out there that will give them health there's been a lot of
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:06.320]  research you know clear back in the 70s when I visited Mexico in Tijuana there
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:13.000]  was there was like 15 different cures being practiced in in Tijuana to help
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:20.280]  people with cancer well I know there are treatments that that work better
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:24.640]  statistically than than the chemotherapy and and burning things and one man's
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:27.480]  care is another man's disease but there's certainly a lot of suppressed
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:33.960]  healthcare things I mean look at this out of Orlando look at this article right
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:38.920]  here deputies man says he shot deer from roadway to feed family and that happened
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:42.500]  during the Great Depression I mean there's deer like roaches in Florida
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:46.800]  Texas all over I just let him get run over let him starve to death a Collier
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:50.320]  County man accused of shooting two deer says he needed to feed his family
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:57.600]  jail record show 41 year old Wilford Castillo was arrested Friday on charges
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:02.000]  of unlawful taking a doe deer discharging a firearm from a public
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:07.240]  roadway and felony trespassing by projectile his court date is June 11th
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:10.320]  and again I'm not saying it's good that he was shooting deer off a roadway but
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:14.560]  meanwhile all these mass crimes are being committed co-designed stealing
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:18.760]  billions Obama's giving billions to energy companies knowing it's a fraud all
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:22.880]  that's fine though I mean we're entering this phase that tyrants like to set up
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:28.400]  where they just get everybody to go okay they're tyrants but that's just you
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:33.160]  they're the boss and everybody's like a spectator I mean is there a way to break
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:43.840]  people out of this malaise Fritz I believe so just you know it like like
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:48.720]  the scripture says the truth shall make you free and you shall be free indeed
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:57.000]  you know the first step is is realizing what's happening the truth and that
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.440]  truth will set you free Christ is about liberty it says in the scriptures that
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:12.680]  were in all these things were more than conquerors so people need to take a an
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:19.760]  attitude of faith that they can rise up and they can take responsibility and
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:25.040]  they can do positive things you're not sitting back and whining you're getting
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:28.640]  up you're standing up and you're doing so exactly I'm here to give you realize
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:32.360]  the power they have but the big problem is the churches as you know through the
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:35.320]  world council of churches have been taken over they tell them lay down a
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:39.040]  tyranny of course that's totally unbiblical and I think that's our biggest
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:42.560]  problem talk about the infiltration of the church is by the Illuminati from your
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:49.240]  research for its Wow and earlier book that I came out with be wise as
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:54.800]  serpents went denomination by denomination and showed how the
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:59.840]  leaders how the churches have been denominations had been created and how
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:05.200]  they were being controlled by the system and you know you look at Rockefeller
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:11.280]  foundations being used to finance a lot of these churches so these churches
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:18.120]  they're not going to bite the hand that feeds them and then you also have the
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:23.920]  government coming in and in in certain ways regulating these churches that
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:33.400]  become businesses yeah the across the board we just see an apostasy where
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:41.960]  people have have turned their back on the truth and are just going for a warm
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:54.880]  fuzzy entertainment the the people can it's such a vast subject that I can't
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:59.400]  even get into it but they're they're welcome to look at some of my other
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:06.320]  material that I've written and get the details because it can be documented how
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:10.920]  Christendom is just being controlled like you say the World Council of
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:17.040]  Churches you look at who who has been the heads of the World Council of
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:20.960]  Churches and who's promoted it yeah the war on the war on Christmas of
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:24.760]  Christianity is happening from within just Christians notice the stuff that's
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:28.680]  overt taken down crosses from without but if the churches had leaders they would
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:36.440]  be standing up and defeating this they replace Easter with an egg they replace
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:40.880]  Christ of Christmas with a demonic super dwarf running around the Jack Daniels
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:44.280]  bottle named Santa Claus which was actually 200 years ago in England they
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:48.720]  would rape and rob and burn the city look it up folks Christmas was banned in

[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:15.880]  California you're on the air with Fritz Springmeyer go ahead I have a question
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:20.520]  about all these disappearances with people lately yeah I miss part of what
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:24.000]  you said it's our phone system or whatever your phone but you have a
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:31.040]  question go ahead I would like your take on all these disappearances of kids
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:35.880]  and people lately well I mean most of them are getting kidnapped by big
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:40.940]  corporations and flying them overseas to Saudi Arabia Thailand Israel other
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:45.120]  areas they got black sites all over the place these rich people pay high dollar
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:49.880]  to kill kids and eat them it's a big part of their religion a Fritz Springmeyer
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:58.920]  what do they do with the kids they grab well yeah a lot of them are used for
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:07.520]  sacrifices that's one of the uses sometimes we we have parents that are
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:12.400]  in a divorce that take a child so there's also that factor coming into the
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:20.520]  statistics we also have runaways children that have just decided to be
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:25.560]  independent so you have a lot of you you have different things happening as far
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:30.040]  as this the total statistics oh yeah a lot of people they grab the runaways
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:35.960]  though end up getting grabbed by the bigger spiders late and some of some of
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:41.520]  these young teenagers they don't know what they're getting into they run away
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:46.480]  from home and they're grabbed by people and shipped over to some place like
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:56.040]  Saudi Arabia and turned into sexual slaves there is white slavery so a lot
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:57:08.600]  of really sad things happening not a pretty picture and yeah I spoke with
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:15.880]  one man who actually stopped there were some children that had been kidnapped
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:22.480]  the day before Halloween and he happened upon a human sacrificed by a
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:28.960]  satanic coven he called the police and the police told him you're deputized
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:34.120]  you're gonna go up there and help us stop this and they ended up having to
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:40.560]  with as they as they approach the coven the coven leader tried to go ahead and
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:48.320]  sacrifice these two little children both of them blonde haired blue-eyed and the
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:53.480]  police actually had to shoot the two coven leaders to prevent the sacrifice
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:56.720]  of each other and that happens all the time and the police are told let's come
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:00.600]  out in the news but I've been told they're told call it a drug rage and the
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:04.640]  person was gonna hurt children every time they catch them or catch the media
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:10.080]  does not want it known there's devil worship why is that yeah well who owns
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:17.320]  the media we get you know these these medias are just one vast monopoly and
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:24.000]  from the top down they they kill those stories yeah I've talked to people
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:30.200]  repeatedly like one man he photographed from a distance a satanic ritual
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:35.080]  happening and he gave it to the Kansas well he gave it to the state police

[02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:15.200]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:18.760]  Alex Jones
[02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:37.240]  final segment with Fritz Springmeyer you know the Fritz that's a whole nother
[02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:42.320]  subject I should get my research team to pull up the hundreds of mainstream media
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:45.920]  admitted cases where Satanists are sacrificing children and then it's
[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:49.400]  never even a big news story you'd think that'd be a big news story that's
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:54.320]  sensational but they keep it quiet or when they find a castle full of women
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:58.520]  tortured to death in France that happens all the time it's a minor footnote or
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:03.320]  Tony Blair is going to Satanic rituals or Francois Mineron was admitted
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:09.120]  Luciferian I mean we're run by devil worshipers and then it all makes sense
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:15.880]  you're like wow no wonder this is so bad no wonder this is so crazy I mean I
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:20.600]  mean I'm sure you've seen the cases now where they're busting abortuaries where
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:24.040]  it turns out they're doing stuff with the kids bodies to well me no kidding who
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:29.160]  wants to who wants to take that job and who wants to do partial birth abortions
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:33.760]  folks who wants to kill nine month old babies I mean you got to be a sicko a
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:43.280]  sicko Fritz Springmeyer comments on that yeah I'm just listening and tracking
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:48.120]  what you're saying and agreeing to finish my thought I was talking about a
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:53.880]  man who using telephoto lens had photographed one of these sacrificial
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:02:00.160]  rituals and you know a ritual is a murder it's a crime so he turned these
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:04.960]  over to the local police and the next thing that happened was it was the
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:09.040]  Kansas Bureau of Investigation came down snatched up all the photographs and
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:19.240]  they disappeared another man had was monitoring from a distance a ritual and
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:25.480]  guess who was doing the patrolling and the protection and the guarding of the
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:31.000]  ritual it was the county sheriff department so the you know the wolf is
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:37.120]  guarding the chicken coop and and and then they tell us that these things
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:42.640]  don't happen and yet like you say that they're happening all around us and and
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:51.600]  yet we're we're not being allowed to realize the intensity of it all all I
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:54.880]  know is I see people out in some field getting ready to butcher a little kid
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:03:00.000]  it's gonna be 50 cowl or lapua time I guess I'm a criminal though I would
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.320]  shoot Satan Wars for trying to kill a child see in the new America we're the
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:10.160]  bad guys yeah I mean it's our religion to grab a kid off the street or out of a
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:14.160]  house and kill them I mean we're we're bad people threats that that we would
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:20.640]  not want to do that yeah things have been right is wrong and wrong is right
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:28.960]  things have been stood on their head but that shouldn't shouldn't keep us
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:37.920]  from doing what's right and and we one should continue to to to think on good
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:47.360]  things and and focus on on good examples and be the type of person that that God
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:53.120]  would want us to be first bring my I agree with you completely and we don't
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:55.840]  have time to get to other callers but I will get to the other calls coming up
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:04:00.120]  but I want to get you back on again to specifically get into the Satanism angle
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:05.400]  because all of this is a sacrifice it's it even if they're not consciously into
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:09.840]  the occult these CPS people dragging on little kids till they die they enjoy it
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:15.640]  they laugh about it it's all about scum having power and and that's what evil is
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:20.280]  it's big groups of weak people getting together to oppress the strong and the
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:25.080]  weak individually and it's just people that never get sick oppressing on the
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:28.840]  nerve of power it's just all about the raw exercise of power and there's never
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:32.880]  enough never enough and I'm sick of them waging war against innocence
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:37.160]  creativity and everything that's good and I pledge and swear on the altar of
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:41.760]  God eternal resistance against every form of tyranny over the mind of humankind
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:46.040]  and everyone that attacks innocence because my only desire is to see them
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:51.200]  strung up by their necks until dead bloodlines the limonade available in
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:55.360]  infowars.com get it find out how deep the rabbit hole goes

[02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:23.160]  Lenin Lerouz joins us for the next 30 minutes we're gonna have Luke Radowski
[02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:29.320]  join us from Chicago where the international media and even the US
[02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:35.280]  media calls it a police state welcome NATO to Chicago's police state and they
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:39.520]  are locking the city down taking people to jail for beer making equipment they
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:45.080]  bought at the grocery store it is just a very frightening manifestation the new
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:49.240]  defense authorization act reaffirms secret arrest and disappearance the
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:56.240]  American people and will repeal if it finally passes a 1948 law the foreign
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:03.040]  relations authorization act updated in 87 that it's illegal for Psyops to be
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:07.920]  conducted in the US with government misinformation campaigns oh they lie
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:12.440]  professionally so now they're just gonna make legal it's already been going on
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:18.240]  642 billion dollars for indefinite attention and Psyop operations against
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:22.720]  us the people that pay their salaries and again no one's more brainwashed the
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:26.080]  average troops themselves they're not bad people in fact they're starting to
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:31.720]  wake up but we're not in Kansas anymore now Lenin Lerouz joins us to talk about
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:39.120]  a host of issues we have Medvedev the you rotated from president to prime
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:44.680]  minister over in Russia saying they may have to have nuclear war with the US the
[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:49.000]  Chinese president said that three months ago prepare for war we've got the West
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:54.440]  shifting now saying Al Qaeda is our friend attacking Syria and Libya the
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:58.760]  new terrorist threat is the American people and the new military threat is
[02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:05.360]  China and then we have Obama's literary agent for 16 years saying he was born in
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:10.360]  Kenya obviously Obama is being blackmailed that info Lenin Lerouz who has
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:13.720]  an incredible private intelligence network it doesn't need any introduction
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:21.640]  here from my show we'll give you his websites as well Lenin Lerouz here on
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:26.800]  the show with us Lenin so much is happening in the world right now the
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:31.000]  impeachment starting to move forward out of that spectrum of issues I threw out
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.480]  at you what would you like to tackle first well the point is we're in an
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:42.480]  interim period probably I don't know how many days or weeks a transition after
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:46.600]  which I would expect a decision be made on whether the president and the current
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:51.280]  president is going to continue to be president we're in a crisis I wouldn't
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:56.880]  be surprised you have a new president being listed to the roster in type of
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:01.480]  the failures of this but we're in the greatest crisis that of our nation has
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:06.720]  ever existed even since the Revolutionary War and the question is whether
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:11.720]  we'll survive I am of course committed to doing what is necessary to make this
[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:18.160]  nation survive and successfully but we're in a for the next weeks we are in a
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:24.160]  very dangerous situation in which no one can certainly tell you what's going to
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:28.320]  happen it make me people could tell you what they should should happen but they're
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:32.640]  not capable to tell you not even me you were on a month or so ago and you said
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:36.440]  the crisis was going to get worse it has we've got the financial meltdowns
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:42.280]  taking place the zombie banks why is the world accelerating towards conflict and
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:47.760]  crisis what has put us on this path well at first of all we put on this path by
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:52.200]  a bunch of presidents we had as a sequence of presidents so far including
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:58.440]  this one and the only likelihood that we'll get avoid the very worst effect of
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:03.120]  some kind or another if we don't get this president out of office very soon
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:10.960]  look you've got a Republican candidate who doesn't wash and you've got a present
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:15.880]  president who also is a failure I think we're going to come to a point of
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:21.000]  decision and it's going to come over the issue of the relationship of Russia to
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:26.400]  the United States that's where the issue lies if Obama gets out now the thing we
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:30.880]  have to understand is the Joint Chiefs of Staff and related military concern
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:35.720]  people have prevented this from becoming a really a thermonuclear war so far
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:41.280]  there but as long as we have Obama as president as long as he remains in the
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:47.160]  office of president we cannot be secure we may get into a thermonuclear war a
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:52.480]  full-scale thermonuclear war it will be started by the United States if Obama is
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:58.480]  president so getting Obama out of the presidency now is not an also ran it is
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:02.320]  something that must happen if we're going to have a United States I'm
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:07.440]  optimistic that if there are things I won't say now because that little bit
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:13.120]  improper inappropriate but I think that if Obama is removed from office which
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:19.280]  he's right to do soon we will get a completely new shuffle and I think out
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:25.600]  of a new shuffle we have a chance of coming out of this ahead now Carol
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:30.360]  Quigley's book that came out in the late 60s as an insider which they wanted to
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:33.400]  then remove off the shelves tragedy and hope that I should ads available in
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:37.600]  full wars.com it basically validates everything you've said about this being
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:44.480]  a Britannic-centered conspiracy at least the British system of divide and
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:50.040]  conquer divide and rule now we learn that I mean there's just evidence upon
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:53.800]  evidence that Obama really is born in Kenya that would have made him a British
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:58.440]  subject a British citizen I've been trying to really track who he is all
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:02.320]  these fake names from your research I know you've been saying this is that
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:06.360]  why you've been saying Obama is a British agent I know he's a British
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:09.160]  agent because he's an agent of British interests I don't care where he was
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:14.680]  born he's a British agent he's following orders from London the British Empire
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:20.600]  and that's the issue he also is unfit to be president mentally morally otherwise
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:25.560]  so therefore he should be impeached or thrown out of office whatever we'd get
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:30.000]  him out of office within a few weeks from now at least well you've been saying
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:34.080]  that for a while and I kind of saw it as wishful thinking but I had Jerome
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:39.160]  coursing on he said the word is Obama's in trouble I had even one of your old
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:42.200]  colleagues Webster Tarpleon saying something similar we've seen all these
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:45.600]  Washington Post articles about Obama should step down there should be a new
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:49.600]  nominee do you think they'll really try something like that well I think the
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:54.800]  only way is gonna happen as if the somebody in the United States look go
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:15:02.880]  back to the time that the what happened in Libya and things like that this that
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:08.560]  this thing was supposed to go to a full-scale war sometime late last the
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:16.440]  last months and it didn't happen it didn't happen because of certain
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:22.880]  influences but more mostly it didn't happen because our military leadership
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:27.320]  and people associated with that leadership have acted to prevent the
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:32.760]  United States from being engaged in a thermonuclear war with Russia Russia
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:36.560]  doesn't want it Russia is willing to cooperate with the United States on
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:42.480]  exactly the terms the United States wants that not Obama so we can avoid this
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:46.520]  war and if we get rid of Obama we're going to have to take a new president we
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:50.400]  don't have one running that maybe Hillary Clinton would come forward and
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:55.080]  volunteer again or something what is getting rid of Obama do send a signal of
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:16:01.560]  a change no if it actually frees the American people from a dictatorship
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:08.120]  people out there are scared there is an increasing hatred of Obama there's
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:13.800]  opposition to Obama increasing but people are frightened if they see him
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:19.720]  going they are going to suddenly become encouraged and I think we'll get a
[02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:24.720]  presidency that we want if that happens why are they announcing and admitting
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:29.080]  that they do have reeducation camps for political dissidents yourself a former
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:33.280]  political president of the system why are they announcing that yeah they're
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:37.160]  listening to us it looks like they're trying to intimidate us well look at
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:43.520]  Cassinstein and he's the associate specialist in dictatorship inside the
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:49.360]  Obama administration and if Obama goes he goes the program goes the American
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:54.160]  people are fed up with this thing but they're frightened they're becoming a
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:57.480]  little less frightened because they're becoming more angry than they are
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:01.920]  frightened but I think we're going to reach a point or either we actually go
[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:07.000]  to a thermonuclear war and that's something we will not survive no one
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.400]  could survive and by the way you were saying that here six months ago now the
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:14.520]  Chinese president the Russian president and Prime Minister are all saying
[02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:19.840]  thermonuclear conflagration using your exact quote is now on the table why are
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:24.800]  they saying things like that because it's true we have we have the negotiations
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:30.520]  going on for example Russia has a whole panoply of these negotiations the joint
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:35.160]  chiefs of staff have laid out the policy for the United States in terms of a
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:41.320]  non a non-war these are the important things we have people in the United
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:46.240]  States especially in our professional military and some other people that time
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:51.800]  who have ever been opposing Obama all the way through but as long as Obama has
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:58.120]  the title of president of the United States their hands are tied if Obama
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:02.640]  really tries to pull something off and he's got the British behind him so
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:09.600]  therefore we're holding off hoping that Obama does not get the chance to
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:16.160]  declare thermonuclear war globally and he's getting ready to do so and the
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:20.280]  whole Anglo-American arm they think they're going to be able to fix things
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:26.440]  by having a nuclear war with Russia no they're insane they're these are these
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:30.640]  forces are absolutely insane so I'll take it you you're not celebrating the
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:37.080]  Queen's Jubilee you know I'm not doing that I'm what I'm trying to do is do my
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:42.400]  part and I have some you know from background some some capabilities do my
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:48.640]  part to encourage those who think as I do in our country including our some of
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:54.440]  our top military and other people like that to do what we can to get this guy
[02:18:54.440 --> 02:19:00.440]  out of office before it gets us into a thermonuclear war and to on that basis the
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:04.840]  minute that guy is going out of office I can guarantee you there'll be some
[02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:10.400]  shocking things occurring for the good and they'll happen soon and to them I'm
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:16.600]  just fighting on on that basis now that's my job is part of this this job if
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:22.120]  you could be at Bilderberg coming up in Virginia in two weeks what when we come
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:27.160]  back a little aroush is our guests are loose pack.com is one of the main

[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:51.960]  are moving in ships in on China with this other double game of having China
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:58.240]  take over our media it's bizarre. I've seen the Ungevity products work for many
[02:19:58.240 --> 02:20:01.560]  others and so I bought a bunch of them started using them had a little bit of
[02:20:01.560 --> 02:20:06.080]  results but I wasn't following the regimen every day but Aaron Dykes in my
[02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:11.320]  office did and lost more than 60 pounds when I saw those results I said I better
[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:15.120]  follow my own advice I started taking the Ungevity products and it's been
[02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:21.400]  incredible 37 pounds in two months our bodies are amazing and God gave us an
[02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:25.480]  incredible gift but if our body doesn't have the tools it needs all of the
[02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:29.920]  vitamins all of the minerals and the other key essential trace elements

[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:06.880]  proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:19.060]  I was thinking during the break now a long time ago a little Rouge wrote his
[02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:24.280]  outfit put out dope ink exposing British royalty and their control of
[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:27.720]  much the narcotics trade and now that's out in the open that's why they're gonna
[02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:33.240]  keep British troops through 2014 in Afghanistan I was thinking about how
[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:36.800]  they now show our troops growing the opium on the news and say it's good
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:42.720]  this whole facade now is see-through but the system still operates like we
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:47.920]  don't know and just counts on apathy but if you could talk to some of the most
[02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:52.120]  powerful people in the world I know you advise CIA directors and others what
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:54.840]  would you say to Bilderberg because I know they pay attention to this show
[02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:58.680]  they pay attention to what you do as well mr. LaRouche what would you say to
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:03.840]  them with their meeting coming up a champ telly say drop dead because there is no
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:08.600]  future for humanity under a Bilderberg tribe and it is a Bilderberg type of
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:14.240]  program that's the word is not understood adequately but that policy that
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:19.320]  was laid down by those two monarchs at that all monikies at that time was a
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:25.440]  scheme for destroying civilization and now this scheme has to be destroyed see
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:29.880]  as usual you're so historically informed explain to people 1954 Dutch
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:34.840]  British royalty set it up to carry out a eugenics world government well the
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:40.920]  X for the the two monarchies the Dutch and the British are products of a system
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:45.960]  that was was created as the new Venetian party that's why the two monarchies are
[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:50.600]  there the British were conquered by the by the Dutch by the invasion of
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:55.360]  England on this case so the point is we get rid of that thing and go back to the
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:26:00.480]  American system which is what the rest of the world would really like I don't
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:05.000]  get Russia China so forth they would like the American system and therefore our
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:09.600]  job is to get the American system restored and get this British Empire
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:15.000]  system out and we can do that if we get enough angry people deciding like our
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:20.840]  joint chiefs of staff types who are doing their job for example and do the do
[02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:26.520]  our job and we can read we can rebuild this economy immediately we can proceed
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:32.040]  we can get reforms in place and we can get large programs which are ready to
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:38.560]  go and we can recreate the United States as it once was and better that's right
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:42.760]  these people spend all their time and admit it suppressing the growth the
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:45.720]  oligarchs don't want growth they're always acting like they want to make
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:50.640]  things grow but their real policies are post-industrial yes we can we can go
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:55.600]  with Nuwapa which is ready to go that is ready to go as a design process this
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:01.000]  will create four million jobs of high-technology jobs a gently with two
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:04.560]  million others coming in for places like the old auto industry and other things
[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:10.360]  we can create on short notice under the correct kind of program like a
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:15.320]  Roosevelt program we can create six million high-tech jobs or basically
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:19.780]  high-tech jobs in the United States. Let me ask you this Len LaRouche why would
[02:27:19.780 --> 02:27:26.160]  $20 billion of our bailout money be used to move general motors Cadillac and
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:30.880]  vault plants to China because on one side the West is trying to start a war
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:35.000]  with China but the other side kin pecking the United States and getting
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:39.160]  rid of our industry I guess it's that oligarch mind of just attack everybody
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:43.520]  I mean what is that they're out to produce the world's population as the
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:48.360]  British have stated from the present level of seven billion people estimated
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:54.640]  on this planet to one at a rapid rate the intent you look for it when the US
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:59.560]  industries went over from the United States into China they didn't do much in
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:04.000]  production they took the production capability of the United States and they
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:07.920]  tried to destroy it they are destroying our food supplies we're gonna have mass
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:13.280]  death on this on this nation come summertime under the present conditions
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:19.320]  and we do we that say those conditions exist in other parts of the world we now
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:25.400]  have a lost chance to get rid of this president we have put him some place in
[02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:29.280]  an insane asylum where it can be protected no dad damage come to him and
[02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:36.120]  we could we can now act to restore our economy and we must do that we can do it
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:42.440]  and we must do it but we've got to get this present policy and of the last two
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:49.440]  presidents we've had here are been bad jokes we've got to get our policy back
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:53.800]  in function I'll say this the fact that for 16 years his literary agent said he
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:57.120]  was born in Kenya that's really hurting him but I don't I don't see how we get
[02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:00.120]  rid of him we've got the impeachment bill you and Ron Paul and others are

[02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:40.920]  about two in the morning last night doing research and I just cannot quit
[02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:44.760]  working too hard because then what happens is I'm burned out once I get on
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:50.200]  air and it's actually been a powerful show today it's just I just feel like
[02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:54.120]  it hasn't been you know what I mean but I want to do more I want to impart to
[02:33:54.120 --> 02:34:00.000]  people how serious this is I don't hate the police in Chicago I'm sad for them
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:06.000]  because I know they're hired put into peer pressure taught to do what they're
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:11.640]  told ignore some crime while prosecuting other setting up I've gone down the
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:15.480]  research these four guys they've charged with terrorism now beer making
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:18.880]  equipment one of them as a criminal record getting drunk on tequila and
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:22.920]  going swimming in the school swimming pool and they're charging them a
[02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:27.520]  terrorism 12 cars pulled up around Luke Radowski aimed guns at him cussed at
[02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:31.520]  him you know I mean there's a famous video of the police saying we're gonna
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:35.200]  say you're a terrorist if you don't quit protesting Larry Silverstein in
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:38.840]  building seven and he goes but I'm not a terrorist they go we know you're not
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:45.800]  we're gonna say you are I can hate those police but in the final equation man
[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:51.320]  they are really dishonorable sad wicked people they're enemies enemies of
[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:56.920]  freedom enemies of everything good but most of them really think it's okay to
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:01.000]  set up protesters and to dress up like protesters and commit crimes they do it
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:05.160]  all over the world and I just wonder because so many police I meet in person
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:09.800]  are good people and I know police do good things so how do they get away with
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:16.920]  this in cities like Chicago and in like Seattle and Denver where they've been
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:20.960]  caught dressing up like protesters beating people up so they can then
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:26.400]  attack the peaceful protesters you see what I'm saying here how are you so
[02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:30.400]  dishonorable and why do you do it well I know why if you do those type of
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:34.920]  corrupt things you get promoted up the chain and I wanted to get an update from
[02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:38.520]  Luke Radowski of we are change they reached in and cut off their live
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:42.760]  streams and by the way when I go to Bilderberg we're going to have multiple
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:47.320]  live streams the entire time if they try to set us up and don't let that
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:52.080]  intimidate you I mean when you just it's kind of exciting you know if cop walks
[02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:55.880]  up shoots shoots me in the head I fought tyranny I died a good person I
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:36:01.200]  died someone for humanity I died for those children in CPS dungeons being
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:04.920]  raped by big fat pedophiles right now and they drug them out of their minds so
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:08.640]  they can't report on them you know what I mean you got to get to the point of
[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:12.680]  we're gonna peacefully resist these people and I don't care what you do to
[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:17.200]  me and I'm not saying that's even gonna happen the point is is you got to stop
[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:21.720]  caring about what happens to you it's that cowardly attitude that has
[02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:28.160]  gotten us to this point and it totally creeps me out to see police all over the
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:32.760]  world I saw G 20 a few years ago in England a guy delivered newspapers
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:38.000]  every day to this little you know shop that sold cigarettes and newspapers you
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:42.000]  know a little corner convenience store and and the police wouldn't release the
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:45.280]  tape but later it got released to court the guy turns around nicely his little
[02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:48.920]  thing is I'm delivering newspapers a little cart he said I have the proper
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:52.680]  badge and they just beat him to death and have fun killing him and then later
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:57.320]  said he'd done something you know it's like wow they're hiring such cowards
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:01.000]  because you know I don't say I'm the toughest guy in the world but I'm not
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:04.520]  looking for a fight either I mean I know how dangerous it is I'm not looking
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:08.800]  to get my nose broken and stuff but if somebody starts a fight with me once I
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:13.480]  start you know I'm I certainly get into it because they've done something to me
[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:18.080]  but I'm not like the type who wants to I've always seen people who'll see like
[02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:23.640]  a little guy and they'll want to go beat them up I remember one time in high
[02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:28.000]  school my girlfriend's brother was like a runt and I saw like four or five guys
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:32.280]  slamming his head into a locker and I went over and you know beat him up so
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:35.920]  it wasn't hard they were bullies they were punks my dad got sued because I
[02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:39.560]  punched one of them the whole is the guy's whole nose came off it was wild
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:43.120]  so I could just a black hole in his face with blood shooting out but that's a
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:49.640]  side issue I couldn't imagine why four guys would want to be picking on a
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:54.440]  runt you know a runt there was obviously something wrong with him he was a
[02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:58.160]  lot smaller he was little his sister wasn't like that he was a run like a
[02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:01.440]  run of the litter and and and and to me it was I came over said why don't you
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:04.960]  pick on somebody so when I'm punched me in I went bam tore that guy's nose off
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:08.960]  I'm not bragging about how I'm a tough guy I've been hurt bad as well the point
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:14.680]  is I would never want to attack somebody who didn't have it coming and the
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:19.360]  cowardliness of wanting to in all these police videos I've seen okay here's an
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:24.760]  example that's why my head spins we're going to look two years ago I sin Rob do
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:28.840]  Jason Burmish and what was it Aaron Dyches or Rob Jacobs and I forget who
[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:34.080]  all I sent but I sent three guys up there I know it was a do was there and so
[02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:38.440]  was Burmese this do got arrested oh yeah Aaron was there too Douglas Douglas was
[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:44.720]  there and they all get up there and the police are beating up old ladies and
[02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:48.760]  releasing police dogs because no one was resisting them show and this is in
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:52.000]  Pittsburgh so there's famous footage of those two old women come out with
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:56.200]  grocery bags in their hands out of a shop and they release a police dog on them
[02:38:56.200 --> 02:39:00.400]  and the old women turn and say we're going so we're going to our cars this is
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:05.800]  just in Pittsburgh and the police just released the dogs on them again total
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:13.160]  mental illness going on there and the police were beating up innocent women
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:17.760]  and people who've done nothing and I said I want you to go talk to the
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:21.040]  military why are they there this is illegal so they go to the military they

[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:46.960]  like to you know go interview your public information officer we were told

[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:58.240]  rooms ordering some you know room service working all day cop calls and I
[02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:01.800]  even called on here and talked to the cop and he admitted it all they said

[02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:10.080]  military and if they wouldn't if we wouldn't have had a radio audience and
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:14.400]  been able to call the Pittsburgh police and all this they were sending police
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:18.440]  they'd gone to the rental car place they found out where they were they were
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:22.120]  coming until I found out and called them and had a bunch of listeners calling
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:26.400]  it an emergency broadcast internet only and they backed off but they were
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:29.720]  coming and saying you're terrorist you're going to prison he said you're
[02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:34.560]  terrorist you're going to prison and we're coming right now and I called the

[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:54.520]  an animal to them I don't exist you don't exist and I want to tell the cops
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:58.880]  when you act like that we have no future what do you think the bankers are
[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:02.480]  going to do if you're going to enforce a tyranny like this and by the way
[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:06.880]  there's going to be a civil war and you're gonna get chewed up in it which
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:13.060]  is no enjoyment to me all right I'm gonna shut up Luke amazing video well we
[02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:16.040]  can't play it because the cops are cussing so much but it's up at info
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:19.800]  wars comm it's also on the we are change YouTube site we've had it up
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:25.160]  obviously since it happened yesterday but tell folks what else you've been
[02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:31.000]  witnessing there at NATO what the London Guardian calls a police state welcome
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.520]  NATO to Chicago's police state but it's no matter where NATO goes that we were
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:39.560]  the big narcotics traffickers I should add everywhere they are the globalist
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:44.000]  go they lock things down this is global they're in command the guardians acting
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:48.160]  like NATO didn't do this Luke Radowski of we are change founder of we are
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:52.480]  change what do you make of this Alex there's so much to get into especially
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:56.720]  our coverage here tonight we got pulled over earlier in the day we're at the
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:01.120]  bail hearings for the NATO 3 the NATO 3 that are facing terrorist charges we
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:05.400]  were there we're the first ones to do a live report outside the courtroom how
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:10.280]  this was a pure entrapment the defense clearly stated that undercover agents
[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:15.240]  applied the explosive devices and instigated the call for violence we
[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:19.400]  were there reporting on that a very weird situation occurred when we were
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:23.520]  live-streaming later on in that day and we I have a feeling that we were almost
[02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:28.320]  about to be set up we were staying with somebody because we really can't afford
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:32.680]  a hotel with one of my friends who is Lucy associated with the occupy
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:39.880]  Chicago group here and my friend Lucy knew her and we were staying at our
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:43.600]  house we got a phone call that the place we were staying at was being raided
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:48.160]  that there was police officers inside the person couldn't get inside we
[02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:52.320]  broadcasted that message out to everybody on our Twitter on our view
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:56.960]  stream told everybody this was happening later the same person called us told us
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:02.440]  not to tell anybody not to contact the NOG not to go there I sent people there
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:06.600]  anyway the place we were staying at the door was open the alarm was going off
[02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:11.280]  our stuff was still there the person then went missing wasn't in her apartment
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:16.560]  and we and as we were talking about how weird the situation was that our place
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:20.600]  was surrounded by police officers after we were done live-streaming we were we
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:24.160]  just contacted the National Lawyer to get some information
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:27.480]  they were probably getting ready to have you on the news as the terrorist
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:31.680]  instead they set up these other guys for the beer equipment which the media went
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:34.880]  and saw the big I mean it is a beer equipment but doesn't matter you're
[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:38.360]  probably gonna prison for it go ahead person we were staying with new the
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:43.440]  people who were entrapped with that beer quick see there you go absolutely okay
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:47.120]  yeah they're planning to set you up yeah I really I really have that feeling we
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:51.320]  have no solid evidence but everything points to that right now and as we were
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:55.000]  talking about in the car going to that place how this may be a set of how we
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:01.440]  need to live-stream everything 12 police car vehicles the one with DHS a DHS
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:06.960]  stand also was there undercover cops were there three white shirts police
[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:11.960]  officers were there and lieutenant they pulled us over guns were drawn at us we
[02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:16.120]  were screened at told to put our hands up the window I took my cell phone out
[02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:20.040]  the window and I was live-streaming the whole yeah I saw that we're gonna be
[02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:24.000]  doing that at Bilderberg and see you there I was I was very lucky I didn't get
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:28.960]  shot from police officers then deleted my footage deleted that footage of them
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:33.680]  running up to us with guns deleted it off my phone made for a didn't save your
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:40.080]  stream can't even get the broadcast back up right now and we were handcuffed we
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:46.240]  were questioned and the weird thing is that the DHS band was there they
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:51.280]  started banging our car drives our batteries the police officer that I was
[02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:54.920]  talking to I was looking me straight in the eyes and then when I asked him why
[02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:58.560]  we're getting pulled over he said our vehicle master description that they
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:02.480]  were looking for and as he said that you look down and started laughing he started
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:05.800]  laughing because our car that we're driving it right now has new Mexico
[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:09.960]  plates I don't think there's many cars here in Chicago right now I'd have new
[02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:15.200]  look obviously it's a giant narcotics trafficking mafia command base I've seen
[02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:18.800]  the footage of these police they look something right out of a good fellows
[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:23.720]  episode this country is so pathetic go ahead this is also important to know we
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:27.440]  are changing Milwaukee who I don't even know I'm looking up we are changing an
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:32.600]  idea other people brass idea and start chapters I met we are changing walk you
[02:45:32.600 --> 02:45:37.640]  for the first time on the March that day or right after they met me a CPV
[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:42.740]  Chicago Police Department stopped them they put them arrested them and took them
[02:45:42.740 --> 02:45:46.920]  down to a Homeland Security Fusion Center and then we are changing Milwaukee
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:50.160]  when they were inside the Fusion Center they were questioned how do you know
[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:54.040]  look right now see what is he wearing who is he with where is he staying they're
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:58.560]  trying to find out details I want to set you up maybe these are criminals yes
[02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:04.320]  the Fusion Center was asking by me by name and then later we found out we are
[02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:08.720]  changing the photo was also pulled over the same style guns drawn pulled over by
[02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:15.640]  the CPV so this is extremely extremely weird later what we decided to do we
[02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:20.680]  had the live broadcast we went back to the apartment we expected all of our
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:24.760]  stuff first we expected our vehicle made sure nothing was planted in the car we
[02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:29.680]  live streamed when we went back to the apartment and we checked all of our
[02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:32.560]  possessions went through every little thing make sure it made for nothing was
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:37.000]  planted on us and then we left looking for another place to stay and this was
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:40.600]  late at night and then my friends who are listening on the police radio said
[02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:44.240]  that the police were looking for us and to find out where our final death well
[02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:49.600]  Chicago cops Chicago cops will kill you for fun that they can put soft kill
[02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:53.360]  chemicals and things like in the food in the refrigerator that'll kill you six
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:56.360]  months later they do it all the time it's just because it makes them feel
[02:46:56.360 --> 02:47:01.480]  manly to kill some innocent Americans I mean you don't think in America you're
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:05.640]  just allowed to have cameras and go cover NATO meeting what do you think you're
[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:10.760]  in a free country pal we have the best independent journalist with us we have
[02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:14.480]  been cast to Rafa the best independent journalist here who are covering
[02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:19.560]  everything this is a pure form of intimidation of harassment we decided
[02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:23.920]  to stand tall not be intimidated not be afraid and we came out there tomorrow
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:29.480]  who came out there yesterday and we still continue our work here some of our
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:32.680]  members wanted to go home some of our members were freaked out we are changing
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:36.320]  Milwaukee as soon as they released they they got out of this town you know the
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:40.080]  point yeah but if you run today you'll keep running forever these are all
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:43.800]  martial law drills to intimidate everybody not to protest that's why all
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:47.640]  over the country they'll come out to peaceful anti-war rallies and pepper
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:52.920]  spray babies and laugh on video remember that happened it's also very important
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:57.040]  that days before the NATO summit we were here in Chicago we were at a press
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:48:01.720]  conference with the top cop though the police chief of Chicago and we asked
[02:48:01.720 --> 02:48:06.600]  them will you use agent provocateurs to instigate violence will you dress up
[02:48:06.600 --> 02:48:11.720]  your police officers to instigate violence and the police chief his
[02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:16.000]  answer is on our YouTube channel right now his answer was what I never heard
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:19.600]  that and he canceled the interview right after I asked that cancel the press
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:23.000]  conference that at me yeah he was doing a press conference the videos on our
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:28.240]  YouTube channel and then we went to the NATO 3 terrorism charges hearings at the
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:33.080]  court here we were at the press conference of the prosecution of the
[02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:38.000]  police chief of top Chicago prosecute prosecutors and they wouldn't answer any
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:42.800]  questions about the undercover agent who entrapped these three young kids who
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:45.840]  instigated the calls for violence at least that's what the defense is saying
[02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:48.840]  right now sir let me just stop you let me just stop you for a minute look I
[02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:52.920]  mean you obviously understand how dangerous and criminal these people are
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:58.680]  in Illinois they've sent state prosecutors down to to try to help the
[02:48:58.680 --> 02:49:03.680]  the counties put people in prison for life for filming and taping police in
[02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:08.720]  public so these they would love to put you in a solitary confinement for life
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:12.760]  they think you should be killed for the First Amendment these people are
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:17.000]  basically like Stalin supporters I mean they would have done great in Stalin's
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:20.840]  system and they want to kill America they're so close to getting rid of the
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:24.680]  Bill of Rights and you keep exercising it and they can't stand it but they've
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:28.880]  really got to feel good about themselves because they are they are the modern
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:33.360]  scum of the earth this is really incredible I mean I'm shocked at
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:37.640]  everything that's going on but I won't be deterred I'm not afraid I'm still here
[02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:41.480]  in Chicago I'm still going to continue my reporting I hope people I mean the
[02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:45.320]  only thing keeping me keeping me safe right now is people watching people
[02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:48.840]  watching on the youth team people on Twitter following up everything that's

[02:50:55.680 --> 02:51:01.160]  little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:04.880]  pretty good sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:08.920]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:12.400]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:51:12.400 --> 02:51:17.040]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:35.520]  the photograph hell from ministry just let us know that he liked my rendition of
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:42.480]  lies the other day little impromptu you know there are so many good people out
[02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:50.360]  there that are awake I'm sad about this I mean I know where this is gonna go and
[02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:53.560]  it makes me so sad to see this country being run into the ground I mean I
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:59.000]  really love America there's so many good people this is such a great country but
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:03.800]  we have to realize just how pathetic we are I mean for over 10 years I stopped
[02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:09.120]  working out ate like a pig gain like 70 pounds I've only lost 40 something I had
[02:55:09.120 --> 02:55:13.640]  to realize that I was pathetic and I still haven't gone all the way I should
[02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:17.840]  and I'm still pathetic to really be able to reverse things you've got to humble
[02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:24.680]  yourself and I know under peer pressure these police do a lot of bad things but
[02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:34.280]  man it is bad on your soul on your life to set up innocent people now I don't
[02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:36.560]  think that's gonna be happening at Bilderberg because they don't want to
[02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:41.120]  give it attention all these G20 NATO meetings it's always about getting a
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:44.680]  local police force under federal control to do horrible things it's a
[02:55:44.680 --> 02:55:48.720]  psychological test we've confirmed this I'm probably the leading expert on it
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:53.000]  because I've been obsessed with the police state for 17 years and I've
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:57.800]  watched it unfold and why would you release dogs on old ladies coming out
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:02.080]  of a store and then go we got to find somebody who's out on the daytime
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:06.120]  nighttime curfew let's go to the university five six miles away and
[02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:11.680]  attack them why I mean as a man you want to chase a girl on a bike and hit her
[02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:14.640]  in the head with a billy club and split her head open because that's what men do
[02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:22.320]  that's that's a manly that's tough I mean what do you expect we've had 50
[02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:27.200]  million abortions in this country 50-plus million I mean look at this
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:30.440]  article Paul Watson did there's a lot of big breaking news and info wars com
[02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:35.840]  right now AMC buyout part of Chinese takeover of media and the Chinese
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:41.640]  government says in USA today that we quote this is part of the soft power
[02:56:41.640 --> 02:56:46.120]  cultural influence it's not about the Chinese people it's about the biggest
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:50.200]  communist state in the world that kills political dissidents and sells their
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:55.000]  organs and the red dawn movie got pulled because it criticized China they
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:59.560]  can't even release a movie now where it shows the communist Chinese invading
[02:56:59.560 --> 02:57:06.080]  because they have invaded through the media and our big companies big NSA
[02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:10.640]  companies like Google and others and Yahoo Microsoft they're all helping
[02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:19.760]  build the control system over there it's just it's such treason it's this is an
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:24.480]  important article this needs to get out to you know Michael Savage and Drudge
[02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:28.080]  and Rush Limbaugh and people because nobody's talking about this I mean it's
[02:57:28.080 --> 02:57:33.040]  not kosher now to criticize China in any way people are like well wait I thought
[02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:35.960]  you said the West wants to have a war with them it's a bunch of weird special
[02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:39.360]  interest our government's bad the Chinese government's bad too it's not
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:42.760]  like hey let's not attack Iran so I'm sitting the Iranian government's good
[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:47.120]  our government's bad shows their government it's not well you know if
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:56.160]  Hugo Chavez is bad I must be saying the West is good no he's bad to people it's
[02:57:56.160 --> 02:58:00.320]  more sophisticated than the mainstream media puts it out Natalie knows it's
[02:58:00.320 --> 02:58:04.360]  gonna be powerful tonight jam-packed there's a lot of news I didn't get to
[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:08.120]  but I covered most of it here in the shower I didn't get into this properly
[02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:16.360]  and this should probably be our top story tomorrow it is so big that members of
[02:58:16.360 --> 02:58:20.160]  Congress are trying to battle it but they haven't been able to defeat it and
[02:58:20.160 --> 02:58:25.280]  Smith and Amish amendment rejected indefinite detention still the law
[02:58:25.280 --> 02:58:29.720]  that's new American and they're announcing the CIA's engaging in
[02:58:29.720 --> 02:58:47.000]  psyops domestically it's illegal but so what it's all about lawlessness
