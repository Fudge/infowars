[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.640]  It's Saturday, November 5th, 2022. This is an emergency Saturday transmission on Alex Jones.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.920]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.040]  Coming up, he's about to be in studio with us. We're gonna do an in-depth two-hour interview
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.000]  commercial three with Dr. Peter McCullough, completely vindicated, predicting the lab origins
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.640]  of the deadly virus and the even more deadly shot. Uncensored, unfiltered, what the enemy
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.120]  fears above all else is real information. It's coming up in mere minutes on this special Saturday
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.800]  transmission. Whether you're watching this at InfoWars.com, the streams, whether you're listening
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.880]  to it on the radio stations, go to Band.Video and take this archive once the show has streamed out
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.720]  and share it. Band.Video. All right, ladies and gentlemen. Wow, so much to talk about,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.960]  so many big developments. You know, I said earlier in the week that I was gonna come in here on
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.440]  Saturday because I had so many Elon Musk questions. I had so many Kanye, Ye West questions. Are they
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.480]  good? Are they bad? I said I'll spend some time on that, but they're a bigger fish to fry.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.440]  I just know this. The power structure is coming after Kanye West. Yay. They're coming after Elon
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:42.000]  Musk. I'm not saying Elon Musk is a great guy. I just know the ADL, George Soros, they're
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.800]  boycotting, they're censoring, they're attacking. Twitter had to fire 50% of its employees.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.680]  We then get news like this that Ye, in a conversation last night, told me,
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.080]  and no one broke this but InfoWars.com, that he has been suspended for seven days on Twitter.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.960]  And the question is, did Elon Musk do this? No, Elon Musk is not even in control of the company
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.720]  yet. Now, down the road, if he doesn't restore him, we know there's censorship going on,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.800]  and that's wrong, but that's the big exclusive news on that front. But
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:25.600]  we've got the midterms now in just three days. The polls open in 64 hours, and we know there's
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.560]  the biggest red wave in history, a total political realignment, but just like we just saw in Brazil,
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.160]  they are going to try to steal it like Lula has done from Bolsonaro. But Bolsonaro is not backing
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:46.480]  down, and that country is in full revolution. So this is do-or-die time. And I'll obviously be back
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.800]  tomorrow night, 4 to 6 p.m. myself. I want Troyer 6 to 8 p.m. with Sunday Live. I'll be back weekday
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.360]  mornings. We're after Harrison Smith and American Journal at 8 a.m. We're live at 11 a.m. And Tuesday,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.240]  we're going to have live coverage right through into the wee hours of this historic election,
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:12.240]  which in key battleground states, Fetterman and Obama, 2.0, Biden have all told us
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.960]  are going to be held up because they got to have time to get all those special ballots they've got
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:28.160]  ready stuffed into the situation. So that's all coming up today and tonight on the special
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.320]  emergency broadcast. But I wanted to talk about the big picture of the COVID tyranny and how the
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.320]  globalists are begging for mercy and saying they want to come at Amnesty while they still try to
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.360]  inject our children with poison shots. They know we're a massing group of people worldwide,
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.360]  including a lot of top scientists and doctors that know what's really happening.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.120]  And they know they're beginning to lose. So now they want to claim they're not going to
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.560]  attack us with bioweapons anymore. But we know that's not the case. They're going to come back
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.840]  with them over and over and over again. And so now more than ever, we cannot give amnesty
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.600]  to these monsters. We'll be talking about it with Dr. Peter McCullough coming up.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.280]  But I wanted to play a clip clip to from Russell Brand, who I've known for 15 years. He's been on
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.160]  the show many times. I've met with him before her in Austin. For some reason, I'm out of contact
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.240]  with him for five years. Can't get on a show. Can't get him on, even though he said nice things about
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:27.280]  me on Joe Rogan. But he did great analysis of the new so-called U.K. prime minister and the
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.000]  mega digital bank cashless society they're pushing. Here's a clip of Russell Brand.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.440]  The bank digital currencies, CBDCs, central bank digital currencies could be a digital version of
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.480]  money, a bit like a digital banknote. I like it's that we've got a broad concept.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.600]  What if this person's an idiot, which we think that they are? It's like a digital
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.680]  penny for your digital money box, for your digital shithole that you live in.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.440]  You will owe nothing. You will be happy. That could be used alongside physical notes and coins.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.600]  For now, till we phase them out, if you start any little trucker protests.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.320]  Oh, where's my money gone? The digital piggy bank is broken, I'm afraid.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.360]  Start being a bit more cooperative. Unlike most of the digital money people use daily today,
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.080]  it would be issued directly by a central bank like the Bank of England in the U.K.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.760]  That's good. A central bank. Nothing wrong with centralised authority,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.760]  centralised power, globalist decrees coming down from on high,
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.720]  avoiding democracy. That's exactly what we want. Keep talking.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.640]  And governments and central banks across the world are working together.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.600]  Oh, really? They're working together? Well, that's just such great news. The IMF,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:44.720]  the World Bank. Why don't we involve the WEF and the WHO? What we need are unelected global bodies
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.800]  that have been able to co-opt political power, respond to financial power,
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.960]  and ignore and oppress ordinary people, whether it's the recent medical emergency
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.880]  or the cost of living crisis. We're seeing the benefits all around us.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.960]  I can't wait for your next policy. You're going to take our money now. This is great.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.120]  Looking into what having a digital currency might mean in practice.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.680]  I think I know what it means in practice. More power for you, no power for us.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.640]  This includes issues that people care about, such as ensuring users' money would be safe and secure,
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.320]  that it could work with other ways to pay, would be energy efficient.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.880]  I was going to say, is it energy efficient? Is it energy efficient? I've got to make sure.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.160]  Oh, a few other questions. You wouldn't use this ever, would you, to implement control
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.040]  or to advance social credit type systems or to shut down the bank accounts of people you
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.440]  disagree with or to surveil people and have a surveillance network that you've developed
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.320]  in conjunction with big tech and now a financial arm that you're developing so that you can
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.280]  lock step together and gridlock us in a digital prison of surveillance tyranny.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.200]  And of course, the new public prime minister says IMF World Bank. But no, Russell Brown says,
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.520]  oh, are we going to have the WEF involved? No, WEF and Bill Gates have given the money to it to
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.880]  create the new digital world ID. It's not coming. It's here. Here's a very powerful report just
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:17.120]  premiered at Bandot video. Bolsonaro election fraud in the big red wave from Greg Reese.
[00:07:17.284 --> 00:07:32.164]  Before his first election, the radical opposition attempted to assassinate Jair Bolsonaro.
[00:07:32.164 --> 00:07:37.364]  Jair Bolsonaro has been left in a serious but stable condition in hospital. This after
[00:07:37.364 --> 00:07:42.884]  being stabbed while drumming up support ahead of next month's vote. Hospital officials say
[00:07:42.884 --> 00:07:49.364]  it could take two months for him to recover. They failed and President Bolsonaro went on to become
[00:07:49.364 --> 00:07:56.004]  today's leading model of what a world leader should be, a man of the people. He spoke out
[00:07:56.004 --> 00:08:01.844]  against the COVID pandemic hoax from the very beginning. Brazil's right wing President Jair
[00:08:01.844 --> 00:08:07.844]  Bolsonaro said he will not take a coronavirus vaccine, calling it his quote right. He made
[00:08:07.844 --> 00:08:12.964]  statements live on social media Thursday, adding that Congress was not likely to require
[00:08:12.964 --> 00:08:18.004]  Brazilians to take a vaccine. He thanked the farmers of Brazil for not shutting down.
[00:08:18.004 --> 00:08:29.604]  And
[00:08:29.604 --> 00:08:46.644]  declared every single Brazilian as being essential.
[00:08:46.644 --> 00:08:52.244]  And now the world is realizing that Bolsonaro was right. No matter how much the media tries
[00:08:52.244 --> 00:09:15.044]  to smear him, the people of Brazil love him.
[00:09:15.044 --> 00:09:20.884]  The awakening masses in Brazil, like everywhere else in the world today, were expecting election
[00:09:20.884 --> 00:09:21.884]  fraud.
[00:09:21.884 --> 00:09:27.124]  Polls show Bolsonaro still trailing behind left wing former leader Luiz Inácio Lula da
[00:09:27.124 --> 00:09:28.124]  Silva.
[00:09:28.124 --> 00:09:34.924]  Polls are lying. If Lula is really the frontrunner, where is he? Where are his crowds? We are
[00:09:34.924 --> 00:09:39.483]  here to show that Bolsonaro represents the majority. He will only lose the election if
[00:09:39.483 --> 00:09:43.684]  there is fraud and the people will take to the streets to stop that from happening.
[00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:48.844]  And they have taken to the streets. All over Brazil, the people are not willing to go
[00:09:48.844 --> 00:09:55.204]  the way of Joe Bama, the way of the World Economic Forum. What will it take for the
[00:09:55.204 --> 00:10:02.924]  people to be represented? And what will America do if the anticipated red wave is stolen?
[00:10:02.924 --> 00:10:08.004]  The president's office may have conceded defeat, but many of Jair Bolsonaro's millions of supporters
[00:10:09.004 --> 00:10:16.164]  have not. They took to the streets of Sao Paulo in their thousands. The national flag
[00:10:16.164 --> 00:10:21.244]  waved above the crowds as they gathered outside the headquarters of the military's southeastern
[00:10:21.244 --> 00:10:30.723]  command. They're calling for an intervention. Put simply, they want a military coup. They
[00:10:30.723 --> 00:10:35.604]  despise the leftist policies of Lula da Silva and they want him out by any means.
[00:10:38.124 --> 00:10:42.924]  I think the red wave that's coming is going to be like the elevator doors opening up in the
[00:10:42.924 --> 00:11:00.324]  shining. Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Reese. We are now only 63 hours out from the
[00:11:00.324 --> 00:11:07.124]  midterms. We'll be here covering it all live. Ladies and gentlemen, globalists are a complete
[00:11:07.284 --> 00:11:12.084]  satanic joke. All right, we're gonna go to break. We're gonna come back. Dr. Peter McCall is ready
[00:11:12.084 --> 00:11:16.244]  to get in here and be in studio for two hours. They do not want you to hear this. This man is
[00:11:16.244 --> 00:11:20.004]  vindicated. They're trying to strip his medical licenses. He's exposed the crimes against humanity
[00:11:20.004 --> 00:11:24.644]  and he told me the gloves are off. He's gonna tell you everything he knows. So that's coming
[00:11:24.644 --> 00:11:31.204]  up here in just a moment. Please don't forget we've launched the biggest sell of the year.
[00:11:31.204 --> 00:11:36.483]  Things build in October into November. They always peak in November with our Black Friday
[00:11:36.483 --> 00:11:40.324]  comes early and then you'll have all these sales through December but a lot of stuff will sell out.
[00:11:40.324 --> 00:11:44.483]  So the products are basically all in. Most of them are still there. X3 is about to sell out
[00:11:45.044 --> 00:11:50.723]  and you'll be able to get up to 60% off the promo code 1776 until the stuff sells out. We need the

[00:12:11.844 --> 00:12:21.364]  you need. InfoWarStore.com or 888-253-3139. So we're going to go to Dr. Peter McCullough
[00:12:21.364 --> 00:12:25.284]  that I'm going to come back with an Alan Watt interview. A listener pointed this out on Friday
[00:12:27.044 --> 00:12:31.284]  to this interview 12 years ago. Did a group of interviews for a film that never got made. He died
[00:12:31.284 --> 00:12:37.284]  a few years ago. But talk about a Gen 21, Gen 20, 30, the whole new world order. This guy was as
[00:12:37.284 --> 00:12:44.404]  smart as myself or David Iker, anybody, maybe smarter. So the full two plus hour interview
[00:12:44.404 --> 00:12:48.564]  is on Bandai video right now. We had it reposted on the Saturday, Alan Watt,
[00:12:48.564 --> 00:12:52.564]  Think Outside Your Program. But 30 minute excerpt of that is coming up at the end today.
[00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:54.564]  So please stay with us. We'll be right back.
[00:12:54.564 --> 00:13:03.044]  I'm pointing my finger at you. And I'm also pointing it right back at myself.

[00:14:18.164 --> 00:14:26.963]  It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. A tale of two cities.
[00:14:27.524 --> 00:14:32.243]  Dr. Peter McCullough is totally, absolutely vindicated in his work in the last two and a
[00:14:32.243 --> 00:14:37.284]  half plus years questioning where the virus came from and then pointing out the dangers of the so
[00:14:37.284 --> 00:14:44.644]  called experimental vaccines because he's been probably arguably the most effective, accurate,
[00:14:44.644 --> 00:14:50.164]  truthful person all over Fox News, all over international media, all over talk radio,
[00:14:50.164 --> 00:14:56.084]  topping the charts on some of the biggest podcasts in history with Joe Rogan. He is being targeted
[00:14:56.804 --> 00:15:01.284]  to have his medical credential stripped and they even had to change the rules to try to do this.
[00:15:01.284 --> 00:15:05.924]  This is outrageous. At the same time, we have the deep state through their mouthpiece,
[00:15:05.924 --> 00:15:13.124]  the Atlantic coming on a Monday saying, let's declare a pandemic amnesty and saying we made
[00:15:13.124 --> 00:15:17.924]  mistakes, we're sorry, we're wrong. No, basically they lied at every front. In fact, there was an
[00:15:17.924 --> 00:15:26.644]  article came out on Friday that the DHS already had a whole plan for a pandemic and lockdowns and
[00:15:26.644 --> 00:15:32.404]  the entire operation years before Trump even got into office and it was developed by John Hopkins,
[00:15:32.404 --> 00:15:37.044]  by Bill and Melinda Gates and by the UN. So this is all a strategic operation. They're
[00:15:37.044 --> 00:15:42.804]  preparing to try to roll it out again. We also had the big news break last week in The Intercept
[00:15:42.804 --> 00:15:48.963]  that under Obama and then under Trump, but it was kept from him, and then under Biden,
[00:15:49.924 --> 00:15:57.364]  DHS coordinating with Democrat party think tanks and private groups with government orders,
[00:15:57.364 --> 00:16:04.244]  illegally telling big tech what to censor and paramount was people like Dr. Peter McCullough
[00:16:04.244 --> 00:16:10.724]  and others, not just election fraud, not just open borders, but lockdowns and forced injections
[00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:15.764]  and the Afghan withdrawal. So this is the government directly colluding with big tech
[00:16:15.764 --> 00:16:19.843]  and private think tanks to censor the American people. And Dr. Peter McCullough is taking the
[00:16:19.843 --> 00:16:23.924]  gloves off now. He knows exactly what he's being targeted with. He's going to roll through it all
[00:16:23.924 --> 00:16:28.724]  with us in this extended commercial free transmission with him in studio with us.
[00:16:28.724 --> 00:16:32.484]  Doctor, thank you so much for being here. Alex, thanks for having me. The gloves are off.
[00:16:32.681 --> 00:16:40.401]  And I can tell you, America should be outraged with the developments we've seen over the
[00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:45.841]  last few weeks, certainly over the last few months. It's a mind-blowing reality that
[00:16:45.841 --> 00:16:52.981]  the U.S. government, multiple agencies working internationally with global agencies are conducting
[00:16:52.981 --> 00:16:59.321]  operations against their own people. It's astonishing. And we have a situation now where
[00:16:59.481 --> 00:17:06.161]  it's all in the open. Authors have captured this. Peter Bragan, COVID-19 and the Global
[00:17:06.161 --> 00:17:10.761]  Predators, he had captured this. Scott Atlas in his book about the White House captured
[00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:19.281]  part of it. Pam Popper, John Leake and myself encouraged to face COVID-19. There is a biopharmaceutical
[00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:27.281]  complex, which is a complex syndicate that is working together in order to conduct an
[00:17:27.281 --> 00:17:33.881]  operation worldwide on people. And what's central to it, Alex, is mass vaccination.
[00:17:33.881 --> 00:17:37.921]  We talked a lot before we began taping this special Saturday broadcast. So just please
[00:17:37.921 --> 00:17:41.261]  repeat what you were telling me and start at the beginning and walk through wherever
[00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:47.041]  you'd like to begin the attack on you, the so-called a request to clear an amnesty and
[00:17:47.041 --> 00:17:49.881]  what they're planning next.
[00:17:49.881 --> 00:17:56.801]  Dr. Emily Oster from Brown University in the Atlantic put out an essay and the title of
[00:17:56.801 --> 00:18:02.321]  it is Let's Declare a Pandemic Amnesty. Not let's consider it, let's declare it. So let's
[00:18:02.321 --> 00:18:07.981]  get the words right here. When there is wrongdoing by those in positions of authority, that's
[00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:16.561]  called malfeasance, and the wrongdoing that we can point clear examples that have occurred,
[00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:25.961]  obvious examples, irrefutable examples led to lockdowns, loss of business, people losing
[00:18:26.001 --> 00:18:34.881]  their jobs, careers being ended, isolation, schools being disrupted, educational development
[00:18:34.881 --> 00:18:46.001]  of children permanently impaired, hospitalization and death that was avoidable. These are collectively
[00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:54.521]  crimes against humanity. And when there is such massive wrongdoing, the steps would be
[00:18:54.521 --> 00:19:01.121]  actually repenting, having regret for what's being done, some admission for what's being
[00:19:01.121 --> 00:19:08.441]  done, and then seeking forgiveness and then ultimately amnesty. Because the crimes are
[00:19:08.441 --> 00:19:16.921]  so great and the injuries are so vast, there must be investigation, there must be justice
[00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:23.281]  that is served. And then at the very end of the day, considerations for amnesty. We had
[00:19:23.281 --> 00:19:29.001]  some great monologues this week on this. One is by Laura Ingram on the Ingram Angle Fox
[00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:33.441]  News. And so let's go ahead and play a few minutes of that 18 minute report. You can
[00:19:33.441 --> 00:19:38.321]  find it on Rumble on Dr. Peter McCullough's account. Watch the whole thing. Here's a few
[00:19:38.321 --> 00:19:44.601]  minutes of what she said about this so-called amnesty. No amnesty. That's the focus of tonight's
[00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:52.001]  angle. All right, how convenient. Now that we see just how wrong the COVID experts were
[00:19:52.041 --> 00:19:57.601]  on everything from school shutdowns to Vax mandates, those same experts are telling us
[00:19:57.601 --> 00:19:59.681]  that it's just time to move on.
[00:19:59.681 --> 00:20:09.481]  Move on. Nothing to see here. Please disperse. Nothing to see here. Please.
[00:20:09.481 --> 00:20:14.801]  Right in the Atlantic, Brown University economist Emily Oster argues that we need to let bygones
[00:20:14.801 --> 00:20:20.481]  be bygones on the COVID debate and not relitigate the past. We have to put these fights aside
[00:20:20.481 --> 00:20:25.801]  and declare a pandemic amnesty for giving the hard calls that people had no choice but
[00:20:25.801 --> 00:20:31.241]  to make with imperfect knowledge. L.A. County closed its beaches in the summer of 2020.
[00:20:31.241 --> 00:20:37.041]  Now, ex post facto, this makes no sense. But we need to learn from our mistakes and then
[00:20:37.041 --> 00:20:44.321]  let them go. Nice try, but no way. First off, there is little sign that those responsible
[00:20:44.321 --> 00:20:50.281]  for the disastrous decisions actually learned much, if anything at all. Where were the mayor
[00:20:50.281 --> 00:20:56.301]  culpas from the shutdown fanatics like Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx? First, they gave horrendous
[00:20:56.301 --> 00:21:01.641]  advice to Donald Trump that led to his decision to shut down the entire country. This never
[00:21:01.641 --> 00:21:07.161]  should have happened. It did enormous damage to our children, our economy, our constitutional
[00:21:07.161 --> 00:21:12.161]  rights and the American psyche that we're still seeing play out today. Almost everything
[00:21:12.161 --> 00:21:16.801]  they advocated, other than maybe washing your hands and covering your face when you sneeze,
[00:21:16.801 --> 00:21:19.341]  was wrong. Like this.
[00:21:19.341 --> 00:21:25.221]  If you're never more than if you're never within six feet of any single individual,
[00:21:25.221 --> 00:21:31.221]  then you've controlled the virus. We're asking the young people to help us with this mitigation
[00:21:31.221 --> 00:21:36.621]  strategy by staying out of the bars, staying out of the restaurants, really trying to distance
[00:21:36.621 --> 00:21:44.101]  yourself. Don't get the attitude, well, I'm young, I'm invulnerable. Do you realize that
[00:21:44.421 --> 00:21:51.421]  social distancing was never grounded in science? Never. It was all made up.
[00:21:51.421 --> 00:21:55.941]  The single costliest recommendation that CDC made that you had to maintain six feet of
[00:21:55.941 --> 00:22:01.221]  distance that wasn't based on good judgment and good science.
[00:22:01.221 --> 00:22:05.901]  They were wrong about the vaccine stopping transmission, too.
[00:22:05.901 --> 00:22:12.901]  Our data from the CDC today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus,
[00:22:12.901 --> 00:22:15.141]  don't get sick.
[00:22:15.141 --> 00:22:20.341]  Whoops, false. Most Americans thought the vaccine would stop you from getting COVID
[00:22:20.341 --> 00:22:25.781]  altogether. Well, of course, we know that was wrong. You also could transmit the virus
[00:22:25.781 --> 00:22:31.981]  if you had the vaccine. The CDC Director Walensky has been vaxxed and boosted, I think a total
[00:22:31.981 --> 00:22:39.341]  of what, five times? And she has COVID again. They were wrong to dismiss natural immunity
[00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:45.661]  as well. It turns out acquired immunity through previous infection does in fact provide durable
[00:22:45.661 --> 00:22:52.301]  immunity from future infection, and it certainly lessens your symptoms if you get it again.
[00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:56.701]  And do you remember what CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta and the rest of the medical cartel had
[00:22:56.701 --> 00:22:58.701]  Americans doing?
[00:22:58.701 --> 00:23:03.181]  We do know the virus can live on surfaces, for example, steel and plastic for up to three
[00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:06.861]  days. I've used a little glitter here for my kids to show you what the virus might be
[00:23:06.861 --> 00:23:11.821]  like. I'm just going to clean all the virus off here. I don't need to do too much. It's
[00:23:11.821 --> 00:23:17.101]  a pretty sensitive virus. You don't need to use any kind of specific wipe either. Any
[00:23:17.101 --> 00:23:19.101]  household cleaner will do.
[00:23:19.101 --> 00:23:26.381]  Okay, I forgot that one. A few weeks later, CNN had to explain that no, you don't actually
[00:23:26.381 --> 00:23:32.301]  need to wipe down your box of spaghetti or leave your Amazon packages in the garage.
[00:23:32.701 --> 00:23:37.581]  That's embarrassing. But these people were drunk on their own power. Anthony Fauci even
[00:23:37.581 --> 00:23:40.661]  wanted to control your holiday plans.
[00:23:40.661 --> 00:23:47.741]  If you get vaccinated and your family's vaccinated, you can feel good about enjoying a typical
[00:23:47.741 --> 00:23:52.221]  Thanksgiving Christmas with your family and close friends.
[00:23:52.221 --> 00:23:57.261]  You've got to be careful when you go into large public indoor spaces where there are
[00:23:57.261 --> 00:24:01.341]  a lot of people there, and that's the reason why you should be wearing a mask under those
[00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:06.781]  circumstances. I mean, obviously, the N95 is the best, but a regular surgical mask,
[00:24:06.781 --> 00:24:10.301]  as well as a cloth mask, is fine.
[00:24:10.301 --> 00:24:14.861]  Wait a second. It's fine? Is he talking about those filthy masks hanging on everyone's rear
[00:24:14.861 --> 00:24:20.701]  view mirrors, the masks that they grabbed before they dashed into a store?
[00:24:20.701 --> 00:24:26.301]  Perhaps the worst part of all of this was the vicious campaign to smear and deplatform
[00:24:26.301 --> 00:24:31.181]  anyone who questioned their pronouncements, including world-renowned doctors and researchers.
[00:24:31.181 --> 00:24:36.381]  Remember the Great Barrington Declaration? From our top academic institutions, they even
[00:24:36.381 --> 00:24:42.101]  blacklisted people. These people have been threatened and excommunicated by medical associations
[00:24:42.101 --> 00:24:44.901]  and of course, social media platforms.
[00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:50.501]  And despite how wrong the so-called experts were on a myriad issues, the retribution against
[00:24:50.501 --> 00:24:55.821]  dissident doctors continues to this day in the name of protecting public health and combating
[00:24:55.821 --> 00:24:59.261]  the spread of dangerous disinformation.
[00:24:59.261 --> 00:25:04.061]  How ironic, since they're the worst purveyors of it all.
[00:25:04.061 --> 00:25:08.381]  Famed cardiologist and member of my medicine cabinet, Peter McCullough, could even lose
[00:25:08.381 --> 00:25:14.221]  his board certification for what he said over the last two plus years.
[00:25:14.221 --> 00:25:19.101]  He told MedPage that he's appealing the recommendation by the American Board of Internal Medicine
[00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:25.141]  and he's persecuted for stating the truth that the government was playing with math
[00:25:25.381 --> 00:25:29.261]  on the virus's true lethality. That was another issue of his.
[00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:35.381]  Well, now we see that he and others who spoke about the lethality of the virus were right.
[00:25:35.381 --> 00:25:40.821]  A new analysis of COVID deaths shows that early on, before vaccines were available,
[00:25:40.821 --> 00:25:48.061]  the infection fatality rate for people younger than the age of 70 was below 1%.
[00:25:48.061 --> 00:25:56.541]  And for those under the age of 19, it was 0.0003%.
[00:25:56.541 --> 00:26:02.661]  Now given the analysis we just read, it's less lethal than the flu to a majority of
[00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:06.621]  the population. That is stunning.
[00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:08.701]  So-called public health officials duped America.
[00:26:08.701 --> 00:26:11.901]  All right, Doc, so you wanted to play that. I'm glad we played that.
[00:26:11.901 --> 00:26:15.501]  And quite frankly, Lauren does a great job. It's a lot of courage.
[00:26:15.821 --> 00:26:20.621]  The example she used are nothing compared to sending people sick with COVID into nursing
[00:26:20.621 --> 00:26:26.141]  homes and putting them on ventilators, but then not letting families go see their loved ones.
[00:26:26.141 --> 00:26:30.701]  And just all the other lies that we were told, it's just staggering.
[00:26:30.701 --> 00:26:33.341]  Or if you have the shot, you can't spread COVID.
[00:26:35.181 --> 00:26:40.221]  But then everything you said has been proven right. So that's why you're being targeted.
[00:26:40.221 --> 00:26:43.901]  So it's like they gave Obama, who launched all these wars, a peace prize.
[00:26:44.541 --> 00:26:47.501]  So it turns the Nobel peace prize into a joke.
[00:26:47.501 --> 00:26:51.101]  So instead of getting a peace prize now, when these guys come after you,
[00:26:51.101 --> 00:26:55.261]  that's like winning the Oscar because that shows that you're the good guy.
[00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:58.541]  I mean, this is a joke. I know it's hard to have them saying you're bad,
[00:26:58.541 --> 00:26:59.981]  coming after you, trying to take your license.
[00:26:59.981 --> 00:27:04.701]  But they want amnesty for all their lies and corruption and debt they've caused.
[00:27:04.701 --> 00:27:08.221]  But then they're still trying to target people that forced the truth out.
[00:27:08.221 --> 00:27:10.621]  You won. We won. People now know.
[00:27:10.621 --> 00:27:12.701]  Almost no one's taking these dangerous shots.
[00:27:12.701 --> 00:27:16.301]  And so now they want to retroactively come back and quietly punish doctors
[00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:19.741]  so other doctors in the future, when they try it again, don't speak up.
[00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:23.661]  Well, let's pick a couple examples, Alex, even before the vaccines.
[00:27:23.661 --> 00:27:28.141]  First one, Remdesivir, the intravenous polymerase inhibitor.
[00:27:29.181 --> 00:27:36.301]  By November of 2020, the World Health Organization declares do not use Remdesivir
[00:27:36.301 --> 00:27:41.021]  in hospitalized COVID-19 patients because it doesn't reduce mortality
[00:27:41.101 --> 00:27:44.860]  and it causes complications like kidney damage and liver damage.
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.701]  This is an obvious example.
[00:27:46.701 --> 00:27:49.581]  So when our Department of Health and Human Services
[00:27:49.581 --> 00:27:53.261]  and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services gives enhanced reimbursement
[00:27:53.261 --> 00:27:56.860]  to American hospitals to encourage the use of Remdesivir,
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.621]  when it shouldn't be used is a clear example.
[00:28:00.621 --> 00:28:07.101]  The World Health Organization followed up with an analysis in May of 2022 in the Lancet
[00:28:07.101 --> 00:28:09.501]  and confirmed they were right back in November of 2020.
[00:28:10.061 --> 00:28:12.221]  Remdesivir should have never been used.
[00:28:12.221 --> 00:28:14.621]  That is a clear cut example.
[00:28:14.621 --> 00:28:15.501]  I'll give you another one.
[00:28:16.221 --> 00:28:19.661]  October 4th, 2020, as Laura Ingram points out,
[00:28:19.661 --> 00:28:24.701]  the Great Barrington Declaration is published by Jay Bhattacharya from Stanford,
[00:28:24.701 --> 00:28:28.381]  Martin Koldorf from Harvard, Sunita Gupta from Oxford.
[00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:33.741]  It's signed by nearly a million scientists and people in my circles saying
[00:28:33.741 --> 00:28:36.141]  that we should only take special protective measures
[00:28:36.141 --> 00:28:38.461]  for our seniors and high-risk individuals.
[00:28:38.541 --> 00:28:41.421]  The rest of society go on normally.
[00:28:41.421 --> 00:28:44.541]  No lockdowns, no changes with schools, no changes-
[00:28:44.541 --> 00:28:45.581]  And that's staggering.
[00:28:45.581 --> 00:28:49.821]  So a million doctors and scientists and health care providers go and do this.
[00:28:49.821 --> 00:28:51.181]  It's totally ignored.
[00:28:51.181 --> 00:28:53.101]  And then now they're trying to take your license
[00:28:53.101 --> 00:28:55.021]  for joining a million people with the truth.
[00:28:55.021 --> 00:28:57.501]  In fact, not only was it ignored,
[00:28:57.501 --> 00:29:03.101]  but later on NIAID Director Anthony Fauci directly attacks Jay Bhattacharya,
[00:29:03.101 --> 00:29:05.901]  who's a frequent contributor on Fox News as I am,
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.501]  for crafting the Great Barrington Declaration.
[00:29:09.501 --> 00:29:10.141]  And you're right.
[00:29:10.141 --> 00:29:13.741]  Now there's the hunting of doctors who have come out
[00:29:13.741 --> 00:29:16.541]  and tried to help their patients directly in their practices
[00:29:16.541 --> 00:29:20.141]  by treating patients and also bringing America the truth.
[00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:23.981]  What happened for me was the American Board of Internal Medicine,
[00:29:24.621 --> 00:29:33.741]  which its only role is to certify and accredit my residency and fellowship training.
[00:29:33.741 --> 00:29:36.461]  So I completed residency for three years in medicine
[00:29:36.461 --> 00:29:38.781]  and three years cardiology fellowship.
[00:29:38.781 --> 00:29:43.741]  They are a standard by which they indicate that I've completed the criteria
[00:29:44.301 --> 00:29:47.741]  and that I have passed examinations for internal medicine.
[00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:52.781]  I've passed four life and career determining internal medicine examinations-
[00:29:52.781 --> 00:29:57.021]  So how do they then punish you by going back decades to pull tests you passed?
[00:29:57.021 --> 00:29:59.181]  That's like saying we're going to pull your college degree.
[00:29:59.181 --> 00:30:03.581]  Listen, I met all the clinical criteria for internal medicine
[00:30:03.661 --> 00:30:07.261]  four sets of exams through four decades now of practice
[00:30:07.261 --> 00:30:09.821]  and cardiology three sets of exams.
[00:30:09.821 --> 00:30:11.661]  So my clinical track record is perfect.
[00:30:11.661 --> 00:30:12.860]  The ABIM-
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.621]  That's like taking somebody's driver's license
[00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:15.821]  when they have a perfect driving record.
[00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:16.621]  Right, so anyhow.
[00:30:16.621 --> 00:30:23.981]  So I have the complete clinical dossier as a highly qualified doctor.
[00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:25.421]  It's untouchable.
[00:30:25.421 --> 00:30:29.901]  What the ABIM does, Alex, in September of 2021,
[00:30:30.381 --> 00:30:36.141]  they declare that they are going to have a COVID misinformation campaign that they announced.
[00:30:36.141 --> 00:30:38.701]  They never define what information or misinformation is.
[00:30:38.701 --> 00:30:40.221]  They don't offer any teaching modules-
[00:30:40.221 --> 00:30:44.541]  And that's run by the secret DHS Disinformation Governance Board
[00:30:44.541 --> 00:30:47.421]  that it says specifically intercept this week
[00:30:47.421 --> 00:30:50.621]  targets doctors that question the official narrative.
[00:30:50.621 --> 00:30:52.061]  Right here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:52.061 --> 00:30:55.501]  Almost certainly these government agencies directly started to work
[00:30:55.501 --> 00:30:57.821]  with the Federation of State Medical Boards,
[00:30:57.901 --> 00:31:01.901]  the various accrediting bodies like the American Board of Internal Medicine.
[00:31:01.901 --> 00:31:03.021]  But listen to this, Alex.
[00:31:03.021 --> 00:31:06.221]  And so in September, they declare this campaign
[00:31:06.221 --> 00:31:09.741]  without giving doctors any type of guidance of what they can do or can't do.
[00:31:10.381 --> 00:31:16.301]  Then for me, they go back in time ex post facto to March of 2021
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.901]  in my Senate testimony in the Texas Senate
[00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:25.101]  where under oath, I'm giving my best estimates of what is going on in the pandemic.
[00:31:25.101 --> 00:31:27.501]  I'm using standard CDC equations.
[00:31:27.501 --> 00:31:31.261]  I'm answering questions for the Committee on Health and Human Services.
[00:31:31.901 --> 00:31:35.181]  And they take statements that I've made in the Texas Senate
[00:31:35.181 --> 00:31:37.581]  and they declare them misinformation.
[00:31:37.581 --> 00:31:41.501]  They put a letter out to me in May of 2022 saying
[00:31:42.061 --> 00:31:45.581]  this among other things we have declared as misinformation.
[00:31:45.581 --> 00:31:47.021]  They give me a chance to respond.
[00:31:47.021 --> 00:31:51.981]  I generate a tremendous response document as Americans have grown to know me.
[00:31:51.981 --> 00:31:54.301]  I cite every single piece of information.
[00:31:54.301 --> 00:31:56.860]  I do not free will or guess on anything.
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.941]  Everything is completely factual.
[00:31:58.941 --> 00:32:01.901]  I give this response letter back to the American Board of Internal Medicine.
[00:32:01.901 --> 00:32:05.821]  I just received a letter October 19th, 2022, stating
[00:32:07.021 --> 00:32:11.181]  we don't think anything you said, Dr. McCullough, is compelling.
[00:32:11.181 --> 00:32:13.901]  So therefore, we've convicted you of misinformation.
[00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:18.221]  We are recommending that your entire residency and fellowship are stripped.
[00:32:18.221 --> 00:32:21.101]  Your board certifications are stripped from you.
[00:32:21.101 --> 00:32:24.381]  Basically, essentially taking six years of my life away.
[00:32:24.781 --> 00:32:28.301]  By the way, California is trying to pass a law under Newsom
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.981]  that if their government board says something disinfo,
[00:32:31.981 --> 00:32:35.901]  like vitamin D3 protects you a lot from viruses, you will be stripped as well.
[00:32:35.901 --> 00:32:37.821]  So it doesn't matter what your real medical training says.
[00:32:37.821 --> 00:32:41.741]  If you don't follow the corporate announcement as a doctor, we're going to strip you.
[00:32:41.741 --> 00:32:46.381]  California AB 2098 has actually been signed into law by Gavin Newsom.
[00:32:46.381 --> 00:32:49.981]  It's not in effect yet until January of 2023.
[00:32:50.621 --> 00:32:56.701]  There, the California Medical Board, again, declaring misinformation and information,
[00:32:56.701 --> 00:32:58.781]  but without giving any guidance of what it is.
[00:32:58.781 --> 00:33:00.541]  No teaching modules, no guidance.
[00:33:00.541 --> 00:33:02.860]  No, no, it's a magic wand.
[00:33:03.501 --> 00:33:04.621]  It's just whatever we say.
[00:33:05.501 --> 00:33:08.221]  But again, you're being punished for being accurate.
[00:33:08.221 --> 00:33:09.661]  I know you don't want to do a victory lap,
[00:33:09.661 --> 00:33:14.141]  but look at your record of what you wrote and what you said as a well-known doctor
[00:33:14.141 --> 00:33:17.581]  and also guy that did a lot of clinical trials and run government research programs,
[00:33:18.381 --> 00:33:20.141]  where you were right.
[00:33:20.141 --> 00:33:23.501]  If anything, I think you underestimated how bad the experimental shots were.
[00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:26.621]  If you were wrong in any way, it was underestimating how bad it was.
[00:33:26.621 --> 00:33:31.661]  Yeah, I held myself out as being a reasonable doctor in the exam room with patients.
[00:33:32.941 --> 00:33:37.101]  The same way I carry myself with patients in my practice
[00:33:37.101 --> 00:33:39.821]  is the way I carried myself before the public
[00:33:39.821 --> 00:33:43.021]  through two sets of extensive US Senate testimony,
[00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:46.941]  two sets of Texas Senate testimony, multiple other states,
[00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:49.661]  innumerable high-level media interviews.
[00:33:50.701 --> 00:33:58.541]  And when I was wrong or learned new details about the pandemic,
[00:33:58.541 --> 00:34:04.461]  I quickly acknowledged it and updated the information database.
[00:34:04.461 --> 00:34:05.261]  I'll give you an example.
[00:34:05.261 --> 00:34:06.781]  That's how science works, it's a process.
[00:34:06.781 --> 00:34:07.661]  Yes, I'll give you an example.
[00:34:07.661 --> 00:34:11.661]  I went to Joe Rogan's studio in December of 2022,
[00:34:11.661 --> 00:34:14.621]  and this is before the Omicron outbreak, and I was convinced that naturally-
[00:34:14.621 --> 00:34:15.501]  2021.
[00:34:16.301 --> 00:34:20.541]  Right, thank you, that the natural immunity was holding out.
[00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:22.861]  And it was like two days later the news broke
[00:34:22.861 --> 00:34:25.741]  that actually Omicron broke through the natural immunity.
[00:34:25.741 --> 00:34:27.901]  I went on national TV that night and I said,
[00:34:27.901 --> 00:34:29.261]  listen, this is an update.
[00:34:29.261 --> 00:34:31.661]  Watch out, you really can get COVID multiple times.
[00:34:31.661 --> 00:34:33.181]  Omicron broke through.
[00:34:33.181 --> 00:34:36.781]  And quickly, the Joe Rogan audience were messaging me.
[00:34:36.781 --> 00:34:38.381]  They quickly said, okay, we understand.
[00:34:38.381 --> 00:34:41.181]  Dr. McCullough is fair and reasonable.
[00:34:41.181 --> 00:34:43.581]  And that's how people have characterized me.
[00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:49.980]  But this relentless pursuit of me as a public figure now,
[00:34:50.781 --> 00:34:54.941]  who has basically, as a doctor and doctors in my circle,
[00:34:55.581 --> 00:34:57.901]  worked to save as many lives as possible,
[00:34:58.461 --> 00:35:02.941]  worked globally to bring truthful information forward on the pandemic.
[00:35:03.661 --> 00:35:07.901]  This is part of the overall government operation.
[00:35:08.941 --> 00:35:13.020]  And we talked before we went on air about you've done the deep dive.
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.020]  It's on record.
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.781]  DARPA is pushing the mRNA.
[00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:17.741]  It's not a vaccine.
[00:35:18.461 --> 00:35:20.541]  They're using Pfizer and Moderna as front groups.
[00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:21.980]  Even Gates is a front group.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.221]  I want to start getting into some of the mechanics of that
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.461]  and where you see all this going,
[00:35:26.461 --> 00:35:29.901]  because we can see them warming up for a new virus, a new push.
[00:35:29.901 --> 00:35:33.741]  And as you said, this is a military weapon being used against the people.
[00:35:34.861 --> 00:35:37.261]  To set the understanding here,
[00:35:37.261 --> 00:35:41.581]  so the National Institutes of Health has had a longstanding interest
[00:35:41.581 --> 00:35:44.541]  in biological threats to populations.
[00:35:44.541 --> 00:35:46.781]  And the division dealing with this is called BARDA.
[00:35:46.781 --> 00:35:50.621]  I've chaired Data Safety Monitoring Board in the past for BARDA on a program,
[00:35:50.621 --> 00:35:51.901]  so I'm very familiar with it.
[00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:56.541]  On the military side, the research organization is DARPA.
[00:35:57.901 --> 00:36:02.781]  And these two work in concert to identify and work on biological threats
[00:36:02.781 --> 00:36:07.821]  and work on answers like vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, drugs,
[00:36:07.821 --> 00:36:09.581]  other things that can be done,
[00:36:09.581 --> 00:36:11.661]  largely to protect the military,
[00:36:11.661 --> 00:36:13.980]  but there has been an interest in the public in large.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:19.821]  Now, on the DARPA website is a program called the ADEPT-P3 program.
[00:36:19.821 --> 00:36:21.181]  The ADEPT-P3?
[00:36:21.181 --> 00:36:25.821]  P3, A-D-E-P-T-P3 program on their website.
[00:36:26.461 --> 00:36:30.701]  And in that program, for many years now,
[00:36:30.701 --> 00:36:35.020]  they have described that DARPA is working with messenger RNA.
[00:36:35.661 --> 00:36:37.980]  And in one of their prospectuses,
[00:36:38.701 --> 00:36:41.980]  for the U.S. government, they have a figure
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:48.061]  where they declare that they can use messenger RNA technology
[00:36:48.061 --> 00:36:50.221]  to end a pandemic within 60 days.
[00:36:50.781 --> 00:36:56.621]  And this was sold to American military government leaders
[00:36:56.621 --> 00:37:01.020]  that messenger RNA was going to be the future approach for many years.
[00:37:01.581 --> 00:37:05.020]  So this was long before we heard about Pfizer and BioNTech
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.461]  and Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca.
[00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:13.020]  The messenger RNA was actually part of government interests
[00:37:13.581 --> 00:37:15.980]  from a military biological research perspective.
[00:37:17.581 --> 00:37:20.861]  And I remember videos from 2017 with Fauci and others on C-SPAN.
[00:37:20.861 --> 00:37:23.020]  They were saying, we've got all this mRNA,
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.301]  it's going to cure everything,
[00:37:24.301 --> 00:37:27.020]  but we've got to blow up the old approval system
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.861]  that takes five, 10 years first
[00:37:28.861 --> 00:37:31.581]  and maybe a virus out of China will allow us to do that.
[00:37:31.581 --> 00:37:33.020]  That's a chilling video.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.781]  You picked up an important point.
[00:37:35.261 --> 00:37:39.901]  The key here was to have a global and national emergencies.
[00:37:41.501 --> 00:37:44.061]  And note that our current president Biden
[00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:47.980]  has extended this recently again, the never ending emergency.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.901]  As long as an emergency is declared,
[00:37:49.901 --> 00:37:52.061]  emergency use authorization
[00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:55.261]  and emergency countermeasures are enabled.
[00:37:55.261 --> 00:37:56.861]  This is very important.
[00:37:56.861 --> 00:37:59.181]  Under emergency use authorization,
[00:37:59.741 --> 00:38:03.421]  it's actually debatable whether or not FDA approval is even needed.
[00:38:03.421 --> 00:38:08.861]  In many ways, the FDA in their pronouncements on the vaccines
[00:38:08.861 --> 00:38:11.581]  are theater, this largely theater.
[00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:13.261]  Well, that was the report I saw Friday,
[00:38:13.261 --> 00:38:16.221]  which guys I put in the conference room
[00:38:16.221 --> 00:38:18.221]  and I forgot to get out of the big stack from Friday.
[00:38:18.221 --> 00:38:19.980]  I didn't cover it, but I remember the headline.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.421]  It was like linked to the Daily Mail.
[00:38:21.421 --> 00:38:23.901]  The headline was National Security Council
[00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:27.821]  had already developed a secret plan implemented for COVID
[00:38:28.781 --> 00:38:31.101]  and was in full control under national emergency.
[00:38:31.101 --> 00:38:32.861]  The point is, we already know that.
[00:38:32.861 --> 00:38:35.741]  It's just what you're saying is this was all pre-programmed and ready.
[00:38:35.741 --> 00:38:37.020]  It was pre-programmed and ready.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.621]  And when the vaccines rolled out,
[00:38:38.621 --> 00:38:41.980]  the very initial document that was presented to a public
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.741]  was signed by Alex Azar,
[00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:46.701]  the Secretary of Health and Human Services
[00:38:46.701 --> 00:38:50.701]  and the Department of Defense, HHS and DOD.
[00:38:50.701 --> 00:38:54.701]  So we really just need the Secretary of the Health and Human Services
[00:38:54.701 --> 00:38:55.821]  to sign off on this.
[00:38:55.821 --> 00:38:57.421]  This is a necessary measure.
[00:38:57.421 --> 00:39:00.541]  And then the military to go ahead and carry this out.
[00:39:00.541 --> 00:39:03.581]  On my podcast this weekend, playing today and tomorrow,
[00:39:04.221 --> 00:39:07.020]  I interview Sasha Ladipova,
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.861]  who is a vaccine and pharmaceutical expert.
[00:39:10.861 --> 00:39:13.101]  She's an investigative journalist now.
[00:39:13.101 --> 00:39:15.501]  And we do a deep dive into this, Alex.
[00:39:16.061 --> 00:39:20.301]  The vaccines are largely produced by military contractors
[00:39:20.301 --> 00:39:22.781]  that Pfizer and Moderna and the other companies,
[00:39:22.781 --> 00:39:24.381]  they're basically shields.
[00:39:24.381 --> 00:39:26.621]  They're some type of like a figurehead,
[00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:27.901]  if you will, of what's going on.
[00:39:27.901 --> 00:39:30.701]  But importantly, the final fill and finish
[00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:33.581]  that is pouring the vials of the vaccine,
[00:39:34.141 --> 00:39:36.541]  that's done by defense contractors.
[00:39:36.541 --> 00:39:40.621]  Under EUA, Alex, there's no inspection for safety, purity,
[00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:43.821]  or for quality.
[00:39:43.821 --> 00:39:47.101]  And now they're targeting six-month-olds and up,
[00:39:47.101 --> 00:39:48.701]  only country in the world doing it.
[00:39:48.701 --> 00:39:50.381]  Give us 35,000-foot view,
[00:39:50.381 --> 00:39:52.141]  then I want to get back into this amnesty.
[00:39:52.141 --> 00:39:54.381]  We have another clip from Del Big Tree,
[00:39:54.381 --> 00:39:55.581]  which is very important to get to.
[00:39:56.301 --> 00:39:58.461]  You don't speculate, you've just stuck to the facts.
[00:39:58.461 --> 00:40:00.221]  But privately, we've talked about this
[00:40:00.221 --> 00:40:01.821]  going back a year ago and now,
[00:40:01.821 --> 00:40:03.901]  before it went on air today.
[00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:06.141]  I mean, big picture, this is very cold-blooded.
[00:40:06.141 --> 00:40:08.141]  They know these shots are hurting people.
[00:40:08.141 --> 00:40:09.501]  They're trying to cover it up,
[00:40:09.501 --> 00:40:11.341]  and they're still trying to make our troops take it.
[00:40:12.141 --> 00:40:13.741]  Obviously, the average person in the military
[00:40:13.741 --> 00:40:14.381]  is a great person.
[00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:16.301]  But when we talk about defense contractors,
[00:40:16.301 --> 00:40:19.020]  this is just the biggest budget we have,
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.701]  and it's a lot of special interests
[00:40:20.701 --> 00:40:23.181]  that are in control of the Defense Department
[00:40:23.181 --> 00:40:23.901]  that are doing this.
[00:40:24.141 --> 00:40:25.581]  Obviously, they know what they're doing,
[00:40:25.581 --> 00:40:27.901]  hitting us with what I would call as a weapon.
[00:40:27.901 --> 00:40:31.181]  And then after we get back into the morning amnesty,
[00:40:32.141 --> 00:40:33.261]  we got to play that club.
[00:40:33.261 --> 00:40:35.901]  I want to talk about the motives
[00:40:35.901 --> 00:40:37.821]  for rolling something out that hurts and kills
[00:40:37.821 --> 00:40:38.941]  this many people.
[00:40:38.941 --> 00:40:40.541]  How do they think they're getting away with it?
[00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:43.261]  How could governments conduct operations
[00:40:43.261 --> 00:40:45.980]  against their own people worldwide?
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:48.061]  And you can see this fraction of response
[00:40:48.061 --> 00:40:49.980]  country by country.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.061]  Americans know something is wrong.
[00:40:52.061 --> 00:40:53.501]  Americans know something is wrong.
[00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:56.381]  Let me give you some important data points.
[00:40:56.381 --> 00:40:59.821]  The Zogby Survey Company, a reliable survey company,
[00:40:59.821 --> 00:41:01.421]  did a survey of Americans,
[00:41:01.421 --> 00:41:04.221]  found that two-thirds had taken a COVID vaccine.
[00:41:04.221 --> 00:41:09.020]  Of those, 15 percent have some new medical problem
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.301]  that they're seeing a doctor for.
[00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:12.301]  Eighty-five percent are fine.
[00:41:12.301 --> 00:41:15.421]  Sashi Latapova, on my podcast this weekend,
[00:41:15.421 --> 00:41:18.461]  on McCullough Report, indicates that those who are fine
[00:41:18.461 --> 00:41:21.341]  probably have gotten relatively inert shots
[00:41:21.341 --> 00:41:23.020]  of degraded messenger RNA
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.701]  or low-concentration messenger RNA.
[00:41:24.701 --> 00:41:27.421]  Those who are injured are getting what's called hot lots.
[00:41:27.421 --> 00:41:30.861]  We know that 35 percent of the deaths with—
[00:41:31.661 --> 00:41:33.581]  I'm sorry, 80 percent of the deaths with Pfizer
[00:41:33.581 --> 00:41:34.941]  and 35 percent of the lots,
[00:41:34.941 --> 00:41:37.181]  80 percent of the deaths with Moderna
[00:41:37.181 --> 00:41:39.581]  are within 20 percent of the lots.
[00:41:40.141 --> 00:41:44.461]  And Americans know from that perspective
[00:41:44.461 --> 00:41:45.821]  that people are talking to other people.
[00:41:45.821 --> 00:41:49.261]  A survey from Michigan State, Ditmore and colleagues,
[00:41:49.261 --> 00:41:51.341]  22 percent of Americans know somebody
[00:41:51.341 --> 00:41:54.461]  who's been injured or died after a vaccine.
[00:41:54.461 --> 00:41:56.061]  So we don't need social media, Alex.
[00:41:56.061 --> 00:42:00.461]  We don't need major media to broadcast as much.
[00:42:00.461 --> 00:42:01.821]  People are talking to one another.
[00:42:01.821 --> 00:42:03.901]  If the camera will get on my screen right now,
[00:42:03.901 --> 00:42:07.501]  I am on the CDC website, the COVID data tracker,
[00:42:07.501 --> 00:42:11.581]  and notice on the right corner here, vaccinations.
[00:42:11.581 --> 00:42:14.861]  This is the percent of individuals over age five
[00:42:14.861 --> 00:42:17.501]  with an updated booster dose.
[00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:20.061]  Answer, 8.4 percent.
[00:42:20.061 --> 00:42:22.141]  These boosters, the bivalent boosters,
[00:42:22.141 --> 00:42:25.261]  which are still 50 percent of the original legacy vaccine,
[00:42:25.261 --> 00:42:26.701]  which is obsolete,
[00:42:26.701 --> 00:42:31.181]  and 50 percent of the Omicron BA4, BA5 subvariant,
[00:42:31.181 --> 00:42:35.901]  the homologous epitope of those,
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.980]  that that vaccine had no human data.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.581]  There were no clinical trials.
[00:42:43.581 --> 00:42:46.061]  It was tested in a small number of mice.
[00:42:46.061 --> 00:42:47.901]  It failed in stopping the infection,
[00:42:47.901 --> 00:42:50.301]  and there was a false rise in the antibodies,
[00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:52.781]  a false surrogate, if you will.
[00:42:52.781 --> 00:42:56.621]  And so importantly, that is, I think, prima facie evidence
[00:42:56.621 --> 00:42:59.341]  that the FDA actually doesn't need to approve these.
[00:42:59.341 --> 00:43:01.181]  They don't need to apply any standards.
[00:43:01.181 --> 00:43:05.741]  It's also evidence that the FDA has no power
[00:43:05.741 --> 00:43:07.581]  to pull these off the market
[00:43:07.581 --> 00:43:09.980]  or tell any of the companies through the DOD
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.861]  and the manufacturers to pull these off this market.
[00:43:12.861 --> 00:43:15.901]  Essentially, this is a freight train moving forward
[00:43:15.901 --> 00:43:16.861]  on the American people.
[00:43:16.861 --> 00:43:21.421]  The only thing that will stop this is people rejecting it.
[00:43:21.421 --> 00:43:24.861]  And right now, we're at 92 percent of Americans
[00:43:24.861 --> 00:43:27.261]  are rejecting any more vaccination.
[00:43:29.741 --> 00:43:31.581]  Let's talk about, there's so much to hit here,
[00:43:31.581 --> 00:43:32.621]  but let's talk about real numbers.
[00:43:32.621 --> 00:43:34.701]  We hear about insurance actuaries.
[00:43:34.701 --> 00:43:36.781]  We see a lot of other prominent doctors coming out
[00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:39.101]  and saying we're seeing a lot of extra deaths,
[00:43:39.101 --> 00:43:42.701]  these weird blood clots, all sorts of autoimmune problems,
[00:43:43.501 --> 00:43:44.461]  microcarditis, heart attacks.
[00:43:44.461 --> 00:43:47.741]  I mean, there's record level deaths happening,
[00:43:47.741 --> 00:43:51.501]  but the numbers you've seen with the sudden death syndrome
[00:43:51.501 --> 00:43:53.980]  they're talking about, how do we quantify that?
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.341]  What's the real numbers there?
[00:43:56.381 --> 00:44:00.541]  Let's go to the openvares.com data overlay.
[00:44:00.541 --> 00:44:02.221]  That's on my screen right now.
[00:44:02.221 --> 00:44:03.181]  Oh, you got it up.
[00:44:03.181 --> 00:44:06.941]  This is not disputed.
[00:44:06.941 --> 00:44:09.261]  This is a weekly update of code
[00:44:09.821 --> 00:44:14.061]  written against and it queries the CDC database.
[00:44:14.621 --> 00:44:18.301]  Now, VAERS includes domestic U.S.
[00:44:18.301 --> 00:44:21.101]  and then some ex-U.S. sources that get reported in
[00:44:21.101 --> 00:44:22.541]  through pharma and then go in here,
[00:44:22.541 --> 00:44:23.661]  including Japan and Germany.
[00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:28.861]  So the overall numbers, 31,696 astronomical number of deaths,
[00:44:28.861 --> 00:44:30.461]  but let's zero in on American.
[00:44:30.461 --> 00:44:33.020]  So we toggle this button here at the top,
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.861]  toggle over, now there's American numbers.
[00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:41.101]  14,920 as of October 21st.
[00:44:41.101 --> 00:44:41.980]  These are deaths.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.901]  Now let's look at where they occur.
[00:44:46.461 --> 00:44:50.061]  If we take 96 hours or at four days,
[00:44:50.621 --> 00:44:53.661]  the vast majority of the deaths occur
[00:44:53.661 --> 00:44:55.821]  within four days of people taking the shot.
[00:44:55.821 --> 00:44:58.141]  We know from an analysis by McLaughlin and colleagues
[00:44:58.141 --> 00:45:00.221]  who's dying are seniors.
[00:45:00.221 --> 00:45:04.861]  Our senior citizens are dying at an astronomical rate
[00:45:04.861 --> 00:45:07.020]  after taking the vaccines and it's relatively silent.
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.701]  It's happening in our nursing homes,
[00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:09.980]  happening in independent living.
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.020]  It's not just statistics.
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:11.980]  We see it in the news.
[00:45:12.541 --> 00:45:13.901]  My mom took it, my dad took it,
[00:45:13.901 --> 00:45:15.821]  my daughter took it, my husband took it,
[00:45:15.821 --> 00:45:18.701]  my wife and then they're dead in three, four days.
[00:45:18.701 --> 00:45:21.341]  Absolutely, and look at here.
[00:45:21.341 --> 00:45:26.701]  Look at the number, 70,633 Americans hospitalized,
[00:45:27.341 --> 00:45:30.701]  105,040 urgent care visits.
[00:45:30.701 --> 00:45:34.381]  We know from the ICANN data that,
[00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:36.301]  from the vSafe data,
[00:45:36.301 --> 00:45:37.980]  you can pull this up if you can find it
[00:45:38.621 --> 00:45:41.421]  on the ICANN website,
[00:45:41.421 --> 00:45:44.061]  that's an NGO through legal action,
[00:45:44.061 --> 00:45:48.381]  lead attorney Aaron Seery prosecuted the CDC
[00:45:48.381 --> 00:45:50.381]  and said we must see the vSafe data.
[00:45:50.381 --> 00:45:53.020]  vSafe is what people can report on their cell phones
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.341]  after they take the vaccine and what happens to them.
[00:45:55.341 --> 00:45:58.461]  The CDC wanted to block release
[00:45:58.461 --> 00:46:02.221]  of this important source of data to Americans.
[00:46:02.221 --> 00:46:05.421]  Finally, Seery and ICANN get it and it's a bombshell.
[00:46:06.461 --> 00:46:09.181]  Actually, Aaron Seery went on Fox News
[00:46:09.181 --> 00:46:12.061]  that night when it broke a few weeks ago.
[00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:13.901]  This is what we've learned, Alex.
[00:46:13.901 --> 00:46:16.781]  25% of people who take the vaccine
[00:46:16.781 --> 00:46:18.781]  are incapacitated the next day.
[00:46:18.781 --> 00:46:20.701]  They can't go to work or school.
[00:46:20.701 --> 00:46:22.701]  Seven to 8% of them are so sick
[00:46:22.701 --> 00:46:25.980]  they end up in the hospital or worse.
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.381]  And I've seen, whether it's in the UK or here,
[00:46:28.381 --> 00:46:30.381]  when they die of it, they call it a COVID.
[00:46:31.341 --> 00:46:34.701]  Well, the attribution of death to the vaccine
[00:46:34.701 --> 00:46:36.061]  has been a consistent problem.
[00:46:36.061 --> 00:46:37.421]  Let's talk about it.
[00:46:37.421 --> 00:46:41.741]  Jessica Rose, a very, very well-respected epidemiologist,
[00:46:41.741 --> 00:46:45.261]  estimates for death that the underreporting factor
[00:46:45.261 --> 00:46:46.941]  is about 31.
[00:46:46.941 --> 00:46:49.501]  We know from a prior Harvard study in 2018
[00:46:49.501 --> 00:46:50.861]  from VAERS before COVID,
[00:46:50.861 --> 00:46:54.221]  it could be as much as 100-fold underreported.
[00:46:54.221 --> 00:46:55.821]  So think about 100-fold.
[00:46:55.821 --> 00:46:58.461]  That's 1.4 million people.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.821]  31-fold underreported would be somewhere around
[00:47:04.381 --> 00:47:06.701]  500,000 to 600,000 individuals.
[00:47:07.261 --> 00:47:08.381]  Just in the US?
[00:47:08.381 --> 00:47:09.661]  Just in the US.
[00:47:09.661 --> 00:47:11.581]  Now, the World Council for Health,
[00:47:14.141 --> 00:47:15.901]  an international organization,
[00:47:15.901 --> 00:47:18.381]  an umbrella organization for about 70
[00:47:19.661 --> 00:47:21.501]  individual organizations,
[00:47:21.501 --> 00:47:23.980]  June 11th of 2022,
[00:47:25.421 --> 00:47:27.020]  issues a pharmacovigilance report,
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.541]  not only just on VAERS,
[00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:30.461]  but on the UK yellow card,
[00:47:30.461 --> 00:47:32.701]  the EU Eudris system,
[00:47:32.701 --> 00:47:35.181]  and the WHO VigiSafe system.
[00:47:35.181 --> 00:47:39.341]  And they declare vaccines are unfit for human use,
[00:47:39.341 --> 00:47:40.461]  pull them off the market.
[00:47:40.461 --> 00:47:41.980]  They had stern warnings.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.061]  I give credit to a French lab, actually,
[00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:45.261]  in March of 2021.
[00:47:45.261 --> 00:47:46.381]  They were the first ones to say,
[00:47:46.381 --> 00:47:48.701]  listen, in March, pull these off the market.
[00:47:48.701 --> 00:47:52.541]  I was on a paper with Bruno and colleagues,
[00:47:53.421 --> 00:47:57.741]  May of 2021, 57 authors, 17 countries,
[00:47:58.461 --> 00:47:59.581]  where we declared,
[00:47:59.581 --> 00:48:01.581]  we put it to every single government in the world,
[00:48:01.581 --> 00:48:03.421]  and we said, we have serious safety concerns.
[00:48:03.421 --> 00:48:05.181]  If this can't be rectified immediately,
[00:48:05.181 --> 00:48:06.461]  pull them off the market.
[00:48:06.461 --> 00:48:07.581]  So I can tell you, Alex,
[00:48:07.581 --> 00:48:09.261]  we were, within a few months,
[00:48:09.261 --> 00:48:10.061]  as you pointed out,
[00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:12.301]  we were all neutral to the vaccines,
[00:48:12.301 --> 00:48:13.980]  which we should be at first.
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:16.061]  But once things started to turn bad,
[00:48:16.061 --> 00:48:17.581]  looking backwards,
[00:48:17.581 --> 00:48:20.861]  knowing that Pfizer knew about 1,223 deaths
[00:48:20.861 --> 00:48:23.341]  within 90 days of release of their vaccine,
[00:48:23.341 --> 00:48:24.381]  looking backwards,
[00:48:25.101 --> 00:48:27.421]  a responsible FDA and Pfizer
[00:48:27.421 --> 00:48:29.661]  should have pulled Pfizer off the market
[00:48:29.661 --> 00:48:32.301]  before February 1st of 2021.
[00:48:32.301 --> 00:48:34.221]  And Moderna and Johnson & Johnson
[00:48:34.221 --> 00:48:35.020]  never should have come out.
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.421]  And now they've got a tiger by the tail.
[00:48:37.421 --> 00:48:39.421]  So they're paradoxically trying to persecute you
[00:48:39.421 --> 00:48:41.181]  and others, Sherry, Tim Pinney, and others,
[00:48:41.181 --> 00:48:42.861]  who've been vindicated
[00:48:42.861 --> 00:48:44.541]  and don't want to be superstars,
[00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:46.301]  but, you know, are people realizing
[00:48:46.301 --> 00:48:47.261]  you were so down on,
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:49.980]  separately going, give us amnesty.
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:51.181]  We're sorry we lied to you.
[00:48:51.181 --> 00:48:52.221]  We're sorry everything was fake.
[00:48:52.221 --> 00:48:54.301]  We're sorry the CDC's own document,
[00:48:54.301 --> 00:48:56.381]  October 2000, predicted all this.
[00:48:56.381 --> 00:48:57.181]  It's another question.
[00:48:57.181 --> 00:48:58.461]  How did they know that?
[00:48:58.461 --> 00:48:59.341]  The first people to do it
[00:48:59.341 --> 00:49:00.701]  was the government warning on it.
[00:49:00.701 --> 00:49:02.461]  I guess it was whistleblowers inside, maybe.
[00:49:03.661 --> 00:49:06.461]  So what do you make of this paradox
[00:49:06.461 --> 00:49:07.980]  where you're being persecuted,
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:09.261]  even though you're vindicated,
[00:49:09.261 --> 00:49:11.661]  the system's been caught lying at every level.
[00:49:12.301 --> 00:49:13.581]  What does that quantify?
[00:49:13.581 --> 00:49:14.941]  What do you think they're going to do next?
[00:49:14.941 --> 00:49:16.381]  Because I think it's fair to say,
[00:49:16.381 --> 00:49:17.181]  maybe you disagree,
[00:49:17.821 --> 00:49:20.621]  this has blown up in their face spectacularly
[00:49:21.421 --> 00:49:23.661]  and it has woken up more people
[00:49:23.661 --> 00:49:25.661]  across the political spectrum worldwide
[00:49:25.661 --> 00:49:26.541]  than any issue ever.
[00:49:26.541 --> 00:49:27.901]  And it's not going away.
[00:49:27.901 --> 00:49:32.461]  And as we see continued shockwaves
[00:49:32.461 --> 00:49:34.541]  from the shots and what's happening,
[00:49:35.341 --> 00:49:36.941]  they've got a tiger by the tail.
[00:49:36.941 --> 00:49:37.501]  Absolutely.
[00:49:37.501 --> 00:49:38.541]  I mean, look at the evidence
[00:49:38.541 --> 00:49:40.381]  that I've shared with you
[00:49:40.381 --> 00:49:44.381]  despite a massive two-year campaign
[00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:46.061]  of incessant ads,
[00:49:47.421 --> 00:49:48.701]  public health messaging,
[00:49:48.701 --> 00:49:52.221]  complete censorship and distortion of social media
[00:49:52.221 --> 00:49:53.581]  through Twitter and Facebook,
[00:49:55.181 --> 00:49:58.461]  press briefings, corporate mandates,
[00:49:58.461 --> 00:50:01.020]  school mandates, military mandates.
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.541]  Look at the data on my screen.
[00:50:03.101 --> 00:50:06.781]  92% of Americans are saying no more.
[00:50:06.781 --> 00:50:08.301]  I mean, this is astonishing.
[00:50:08.301 --> 00:50:09.341]  It's blown up in their face.
[00:50:09.421 --> 00:50:10.621]  You know what's really happened too
[00:50:11.581 --> 00:50:14.621]  is that the bandaid has been ripped off
[00:50:14.621 --> 00:50:17.421]  the entire vaccine agenda, Alex.
[00:50:17.421 --> 00:50:19.020]  And this is now doctors like myself
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.821]  are re-examining the whole rationale
[00:50:21.821 --> 00:50:23.661]  for when I was born,
[00:50:23.661 --> 00:50:25.821]  there were three vaccines, three.
[00:50:26.461 --> 00:50:30.861]  A child today now faces something like 72 injections.
[00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:33.101]  Do you know that children at the day they're born
[00:50:33.101 --> 00:50:35.661]  are given hepatitis B antigen vaccine,
[00:50:35.661 --> 00:50:38.141]  that one-year-olds are given influenza vaccine?
[00:50:38.701 --> 00:50:40.301]  People are starting to question
[00:50:41.421 --> 00:50:45.261]  this aggressive vaccination schedule,
[00:50:45.261 --> 00:50:47.661]  actually vaccinating for easily treatable illnesses
[00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:48.861]  like bacterial infections,
[00:50:48.861 --> 00:50:50.781]  like diphtheria and pertussis.
[00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:52.621]  People are starting to question the whole thing.
[00:50:52.621 --> 00:50:54.221]  I'm talking to more and more parents that say,
[00:50:54.221 --> 00:50:56.541]  you know what, we've lost our trust in vaccines overall.
[00:50:57.421 --> 00:51:01.021]  Well, remember back in late 2019,
[00:51:01.021 --> 00:51:03.021]  they had an emergency meeting
[00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:05.981]  of the UN regulators in Switzerland.
[00:51:06.941 --> 00:51:09.421]  And it was like a two-day meeting.
[00:51:09.421 --> 00:51:10.941]  It was 16 hours.
[00:51:10.941 --> 00:51:12.141]  We watched it here.
[00:51:12.141 --> 00:51:14.221]  We ended up playing about two hours of it on air.
[00:51:14.221 --> 00:51:15.981]  And they went down the whole row of scientists,
[00:51:15.981 --> 00:51:17.901]  including the chief vaccine advisor.
[00:51:17.901 --> 00:51:19.501]  They said, look, even our own scientists
[00:51:19.501 --> 00:51:21.181]  and frontline daughters don't wanna give it anymore.
[00:51:21.181 --> 00:51:22.381]  We're giving too many.
[00:51:22.381 --> 00:51:23.501]  We don't do any testing.
[00:51:23.501 --> 00:51:24.541]  These are quotes.
[00:51:24.541 --> 00:51:27.501]  We're given what big pharma tells us.
[00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:30.461]  And that's being made by the Defense Department in the US.
[00:51:30.461 --> 00:51:31.341]  They even said that.
[00:51:31.341 --> 00:51:33.341]  And we just give it to people.
[00:51:33.341 --> 00:51:35.341]  And then it hurts a bunch of people.
[00:51:35.421 --> 00:51:37.421]  And the villagers don't trust us.
[00:51:38.221 --> 00:51:40.541]  The rural populations, these urban populations,
[00:51:40.541 --> 00:51:43.101]  the educated populations, we've got a crisis.
[00:51:43.101 --> 00:51:43.901]  And they went on to say,
[00:51:45.261 --> 00:51:46.941]  we're about to see total confidence loss
[00:51:46.941 --> 00:51:48.061]  in the vaccine program,
[00:51:48.061 --> 00:51:49.421]  which we believe done properly
[00:51:49.421 --> 00:51:51.341]  and executed correctly for real threats
[00:51:51.341 --> 00:51:52.461]  is a real science.
[00:51:52.461 --> 00:51:53.261]  They said, we've got us.
[00:51:53.261 --> 00:51:54.861]  And then boom, COVID comes in.
[00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:55.901]  I'm sure you've seen those clips,
[00:51:55.901 --> 00:51:58.861]  but even the UN's own head regulatory board
[00:51:58.861 --> 00:52:00.461]  is hitting the panic button going.
[00:52:00.461 --> 00:52:02.141]  And then boom, COVID comes in.
[00:52:02.141 --> 00:52:03.101]  That's true.
[00:52:03.101 --> 00:52:04.701]  Confidence was eroding.
[00:52:04.941 --> 00:52:06.861]  A landmark year was 1986
[00:52:06.861 --> 00:52:10.781]  when the vaccine injury indemnification program
[00:52:10.781 --> 00:52:12.141]  came through for the manufacturers.
[00:52:12.141 --> 00:52:15.181]  People were already starting to get concerns
[00:52:15.181 --> 00:52:18.781]  that this whole vaccine agenda was getting out of control.
[00:52:18.781 --> 00:52:21.181]  And there are rare side effects,
[00:52:21.181 --> 00:52:23.821]  but there was a trend, a growing trend at that time
[00:52:23.821 --> 00:52:27.261]  to understand that some neuropsychiatric syndromes
[00:52:27.261 --> 00:52:30.941]  such as Asperger's disease and others
[00:52:30.941 --> 00:52:34.221]  could be related as an idiosyncratic reaction to vaccines.
[00:52:34.221 --> 00:52:36.701]  You remember famed Dr. Andrew Wakefield
[00:52:36.701 --> 00:52:39.341]  who came forward and brought this concern.
[00:52:39.341 --> 00:52:40.941]  With any product,
[00:52:40.941 --> 00:52:44.141]  it's fair and reasonable to be concerned.
[00:52:44.141 --> 00:52:47.181]  Doctors who come forward should not be crushed.
[00:52:47.181 --> 00:52:48.301]  And what's happened over time,
[00:52:48.301 --> 00:52:50.061]  this is before COVID.
[00:52:50.061 --> 00:52:51.501]  The science is about questions.
[00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:52.701]  Yeah, we're asking questions,
[00:52:52.701 --> 00:52:55.261]  but listen, this is about vaccines
[00:52:55.261 --> 00:52:58.141]  and the history of vaccines not being questioned
[00:52:58.141 --> 00:53:01.181]  and not being allowed to have any discourse.
[00:53:01.181 --> 00:53:02.301]  This is before COVID.
[00:53:02.301 --> 00:53:07.821]  Dr. Paul Thomas in Oregon starts to feel uncomfortable
[00:53:07.821 --> 00:53:10.221]  with how this whole vaccine agenda is rolling out
[00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:12.621]  over the decades.
[00:53:12.621 --> 00:53:14.861]  And he declares in his pediatric practice
[00:53:14.861 --> 00:53:17.981]  that the parents can decide what vaccines the children get
[00:53:17.981 --> 00:53:21.901]  as opposed to following this authoritative schedule.
[00:53:22.941 --> 00:53:25.821]  And the Oregon Medical Board gets wind of this.
[00:53:25.821 --> 00:53:27.341]  They pull his license.
[00:53:27.341 --> 00:53:28.541]  They said, you can't practice.
[00:53:28.541 --> 00:53:30.461]  He goes, listen, I'm giving people freedom of choice.
[00:53:30.461 --> 00:53:31.821]  You know what Paul did in the time
[00:53:31.821 --> 00:53:33.581]  where he was basically out of medicine?
[00:53:33.581 --> 00:53:36.141]  He commissioned a study of his patients,
[00:53:36.141 --> 00:53:37.661]  half of whom took all the vaccines,
[00:53:37.661 --> 00:53:38.621]  half of them didn't.
[00:53:39.181 --> 00:53:41.181]  And the ones who didn't take the vaccines,
[00:53:41.181 --> 00:53:43.021]  the children, they were healthier.
[00:53:43.021 --> 00:53:46.941]  They had lower rates of all types of disorders,
[00:53:47.581 --> 00:53:51.021]  asthma, urticaria, various forms of hay fever,
[00:53:51.581 --> 00:53:53.661]  Asperger's and other neuropsychiatry.
[00:53:53.661 --> 00:53:56.461]  It's definitely linked to allergies increasing.
[00:53:57.181 --> 00:53:59.901]  The Thomas data I think are very compelling.
[00:53:59.901 --> 00:54:04.861]  It's one of the few controlled data sets that we can look at.
[00:54:04.861 --> 00:54:06.621]  The vaccines have rolled out,
[00:54:06.621 --> 00:54:09.181]  and this has been a big issue with the ICANN group
[00:54:09.181 --> 00:54:11.341]  led by Del Bigtree and others,
[00:54:11.341 --> 00:54:13.821]  is that vaccines have come out unquestioned
[00:54:13.821 --> 00:54:17.261]  without adequate randomized placebo controlled trials.
[00:54:17.261 --> 00:54:18.781]  And there's just been an assumption
[00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:19.901]  that they're safe and effective.
[00:54:19.901 --> 00:54:22.861]  So as a lay person, what I see is this,
[00:54:22.861 --> 00:54:24.781]  you've got the military industrial complex,
[00:54:24.781 --> 00:54:26.861]  people getting rich off of it, big pharma,
[00:54:26.861 --> 00:54:29.181]  the politicians, people that want a magic bullet,
[00:54:29.181 --> 00:54:30.541]  the general public, you know,
[00:54:30.541 --> 00:54:33.021]  take any drug that they put on the market.
[00:54:33.581 --> 00:54:35.501]  And we've seen the carnages caused by that.
[00:54:36.541 --> 00:54:38.781]  And now as opposition mounted,
[00:54:38.781 --> 00:54:41.261]  they said, let's give them the miracle mRNA
[00:54:41.261 --> 00:54:42.781]  and let's show them how magic it is.
[00:54:42.781 --> 00:54:45.581]  And let's forget all the attacks
[00:54:45.581 --> 00:54:47.981]  that we did previously with this great miracle
[00:54:47.981 --> 00:54:49.101]  that'll make everybody love us.
[00:54:49.101 --> 00:54:50.701]  And then it's 10 times worse.
[00:54:50.701 --> 00:54:56.061]  That I think is the schmuckish view
[00:54:56.061 --> 00:54:57.981]  because I get the average person
[00:54:57.981 --> 00:54:59.181]  that works in the medical system,
[00:54:59.181 --> 00:55:01.101]  cares and loves people so they can't believe
[00:55:01.101 --> 00:55:02.621]  there's other evil people above them.
[00:55:02.621 --> 00:55:05.181]  But if we know in so many of the 20 years,
[00:55:05.181 --> 00:55:07.101]  the trials they've done with mRNA,
[00:55:07.101 --> 00:55:08.221]  that it works a lot of the time,
[00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:10.381]  but part of the time kills you or maims you
[00:55:10.381 --> 00:55:11.501]  or liquefies your liver,
[00:55:12.061 --> 00:55:14.141]  then they obviously weren't stupid
[00:55:14.141 --> 00:55:15.981]  and done my studies and others
[00:55:15.981 --> 00:55:18.941]  and knew this was gonna have some big, big problems.
[00:55:18.941 --> 00:55:21.021]  And so you're smart, I'm smart.
[00:55:21.021 --> 00:55:23.581]  Obviously the folks that run things aren't stupid.
[00:55:23.581 --> 00:55:26.141]  Doctor, do you think they were just mistaken
[00:55:26.141 --> 00:55:27.581]  or at a higher level?
[00:55:27.661 --> 00:55:29.181]  Is there some organized evil here?
[00:55:29.181 --> 00:55:33.021]  There is a continued love affair
[00:55:33.021 --> 00:55:35.181]  and pursuit of messenger RNA.
[00:55:35.181 --> 00:55:36.301]  Now messenger RNA, remember,
[00:55:36.301 --> 00:55:41.341]  is the genetic code for part of a virus or an organism.
[00:55:41.341 --> 00:55:43.581]  It has nucleoside analog caps
[00:55:43.581 --> 00:55:44.941]  at the three prime and five prime.
[00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:46.461]  And means are indestructible.
[00:55:46.461 --> 00:55:49.261]  We, paper from Stanford by Rolkan and colleagues
[00:55:49.261 --> 00:55:50.381]  has proven-
[00:55:50.381 --> 00:55:51.421]  You can spray them on people.
[00:55:52.061 --> 00:55:52.781]  It's indestructible.
[00:55:52.781 --> 00:55:54.861]  Remember the Pentagon report they wanted to do in China?
[00:55:54.861 --> 00:55:56.781]  They wanted to spray the caves with it.
[00:55:56.941 --> 00:55:58.781]  The body doesn't break this stuff down.
[00:55:58.781 --> 00:56:00.061]  This stuff is indestructible.
[00:56:00.061 --> 00:56:02.381]  So every shot is permanent in human body now.
[00:56:02.381 --> 00:56:03.741]  We have very good understanding-
[00:56:03.741 --> 00:56:05.181]  But it can't be aerosolized too?
[00:56:05.181 --> 00:56:06.941]  But there are attempts to do this.
[00:56:06.941 --> 00:56:09.181]  I'm not an expert in all the routes of administration,
[00:56:09.181 --> 00:56:11.901]  but a review paper that's summarized
[00:56:11.901 --> 00:56:13.181]  in my Substack this morning
[00:56:14.381 --> 00:56:17.421]  has indicated that the history of this is not good.
[00:56:17.421 --> 00:56:20.461]  Messenger RNA vaccine for HIV completely failed,
[00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:24.141]  caused way too much inflammation and side effects.
[00:56:24.141 --> 00:56:25.901]  Now we had COVID-19 vaccines
[00:56:25.901 --> 00:56:27.421]  have just been a disaster.
[00:56:27.421 --> 00:56:28.701]  And guess what's coming?
[00:56:29.661 --> 00:56:34.541]  MNRA vaccines for influenza and both-
[00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:35.661]  And cancer.
[00:56:35.661 --> 00:56:38.141]  And Pfizer, Moderna have announced these
[00:56:38.141 --> 00:56:40.461]  and it's going to be combined
[00:56:40.461 --> 00:56:42.621]  with the bivalent COVID booster.
[00:56:43.421 --> 00:56:44.221]  NTD News-
[00:56:44.861 --> 00:56:46.141]  Let's hear a record skip was interrupted.
[00:56:46.141 --> 00:56:46.941]  You start over.
[00:56:46.941 --> 00:56:48.141]  I just saw it two days ago.
[00:56:48.141 --> 00:56:50.781]  They've gone, hey, since there's no approval anymore,
[00:56:50.781 --> 00:56:52.381]  we've got a new thing we're rolling out.
[00:56:52.381 --> 00:56:54.381]  So it's like the door's blown open.
[00:56:54.381 --> 00:56:55.821]  Pandora's box is open.
[00:56:55.821 --> 00:56:58.861]  And they just go, so you'll have a higher uptake.
[00:56:58.861 --> 00:57:01.901]  We're going to mix the new manipulation of mRNA
[00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:03.581]  for COVID with the influenza.
[00:57:03.581 --> 00:57:04.301]  So tell us what that means.
[00:57:04.301 --> 00:57:05.101]  Yeah, you got that.
[00:57:05.101 --> 00:57:09.501]  So as long as the COVID is under emergency use authorization
[00:57:10.061 --> 00:57:14.541]  and now there's a congener of the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine
[00:57:14.541 --> 00:57:17.341]  and a messenger RNA influenza vaccine,
[00:57:17.341 --> 00:57:20.061]  I imagine that Pfizer, Moderna are going to attempt
[00:57:20.061 --> 00:57:22.221]  to get this in under the EUA umbrella.
[00:57:22.221 --> 00:57:25.181]  So it's a loophole for their influenza,
[00:57:25.181 --> 00:57:27.821]  their cancer, their anything.
[00:57:27.821 --> 00:57:29.341]  As long as they add COVID,
[00:57:29.341 --> 00:57:30.781]  oh, we have emergency authorization.
[00:57:32.461 --> 00:57:34.541]  Alex, for a new genetic product,
[00:57:34.541 --> 00:57:38.301]  it needs five years of development observation.
[00:57:38.301 --> 00:57:38.941]  Five years.
[00:57:38.941 --> 00:57:40.941]  They're talking about trying to put these together
[00:57:40.941 --> 00:57:41.901]  in a few months.
[00:57:41.901 --> 00:57:44.781]  NTD News had Professor David Wiseman
[00:57:44.781 --> 00:57:48.621]  on former J&J scientist, actually won many awards there.
[00:57:49.341 --> 00:57:52.781]  He made it clear this is going to be a complete disaster
[00:57:52.781 --> 00:57:54.861]  because side effects are going to be amplified.
[00:57:54.861 --> 00:57:57.261]  Now we're installing the genetic code
[00:57:57.261 --> 00:58:01.181]  not only for the COVID-19 lethal spike protein,
[00:58:01.181 --> 00:58:04.541]  but also dangerous parts of the influenza antigens
[00:58:04.541 --> 00:58:06.781]  and people are going to get very sick,
[00:58:06.781 --> 00:58:09.581]  produce many abnormal proteins in the human body
[00:58:09.581 --> 00:58:12.301]  with no control over the duration or quantity.
[00:58:12.301 --> 00:58:14.781]  And are proteins, abnormal proteins associated
[00:58:14.781 --> 00:58:18.221]  with spongiform and cephalopathy type diseases?
[00:58:18.221 --> 00:58:18.941]  Well, absolutely.
[00:58:18.941 --> 00:58:22.061]  We know that abnormal proteins can fold
[00:58:22.061 --> 00:58:26.621]  so they can become a prion-like and cause mad cow,
[00:58:26.621 --> 00:58:30.461]  various forms of spongiform and cephalopathies in theory.
[00:58:30.461 --> 00:58:33.181]  We also know that the amyloigenic, the spike protein,
[00:58:33.181 --> 00:58:35.661]  recent paper I've published with Stephanie Seneff
[00:58:35.661 --> 00:58:37.981]  has clearly shown this, that they're amyloigenic,
[00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:39.741]  meaning they're rubbery.
[00:58:39.741 --> 00:58:41.741]  Alex, amyloid, think about amyloid
[00:58:41.741 --> 00:58:44.061]  as a rubbery biologic substance.
[00:58:44.701 --> 00:58:48.141]  No surprise now, the spike protein has been found
[00:58:48.141 --> 00:58:51.261]  within blood clots of people who have taken the vaccine
[00:58:51.901 --> 00:58:54.621]  and the morticians have been reporting this
[00:58:54.621 --> 00:58:56.701]  for a long time now.
[00:58:56.701 --> 00:58:59.021]  When someone dies, the blood is liquefied,
[00:58:59.021 --> 00:59:00.301]  it's called undergolysis,
[00:59:00.301 --> 00:59:03.901]  and the morticians actually drain the blood out of the body.
[00:59:03.901 --> 00:59:06.461]  And now they can, there's just all these giant-
[00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:08.301]  Right, so that's the problem, they actually-
[00:59:08.301 --> 00:59:09.661]  It's like noodles are being pulled out.
[00:59:09.661 --> 00:59:11.741]  Right, so they're used to draining the body
[00:59:11.741 --> 00:59:13.901]  and then infusing the preservative
[00:59:13.901 --> 00:59:15.901]  in order to preserve the body.
[00:59:15.901 --> 00:59:17.261]  But now the blood doesn't drain
[00:59:17.261 --> 00:59:18.781]  and so they had to dissect the vessels
[00:59:18.781 --> 00:59:23.181]  and they're pulling out ginormous, rubbery, long-
[00:59:23.181 --> 00:59:24.541]  And again, it's only countries
[00:59:24.541 --> 00:59:26.141]  that have given these experimental shots,
[00:59:26.141 --> 00:59:27.661]  whether it's Germany, whether it's France,
[00:59:27.661 --> 00:59:29.021]  the UK, Canada, the US,
[00:59:29.021 --> 00:59:31.181]  they're seeing the exact same things.
[00:59:31.181 --> 00:59:33.741]  I've had personal conversations with US-
[00:59:33.741 --> 00:59:36.461]  So doctor, I know you did, tell us, but what is that?
[00:59:37.181 --> 00:59:40.781]  That is a cast of a blood vessel.
[00:59:40.781 --> 00:59:42.781]  They normally try to access the carotid artery,
[00:59:42.781 --> 00:59:44.461]  so that is probably the carotid artery.
[00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:47.581]  And they access the blood vessels
[00:59:48.141 --> 00:59:49.261]  and it's easier to actually-
[00:59:49.261 --> 00:59:50.941]  Yeah, he just pulled that out of a blood vessel.
[00:59:50.941 --> 00:59:53.261]  Right, and there's ones, Alex, you can see them-
[00:59:53.261 --> 00:59:54.061]  They're a foot long.
[00:59:54.061 --> 00:59:55.661]  Oh yeah, so-
[00:59:55.661 --> 00:59:57.421]  This is tame, what they put up.
[00:59:57.421 --> 00:59:58.541]  What the hell is that?
[00:59:58.541 --> 01:00:00.141]  This is like a science fiction movie.
[01:00:00.141 --> 01:00:01.421]  It's like a science fiction movie,
[01:00:01.421 --> 01:00:02.701]  but let me tell you in practice,
[01:00:02.701 --> 01:00:05.821]  I have patients who have developed blood clots
[01:00:05.821 --> 01:00:08.061]  and they're alive and there are large ones
[01:00:08.061 --> 01:00:10.061]  in their legs and extremities.
[01:00:10.061 --> 01:00:12.221]  And one patient in my practice,
[01:00:12.221 --> 01:00:14.701]  we've actually had to remove the first rib
[01:00:14.701 --> 01:00:16.621]  and actually physically pull it out
[01:00:16.621 --> 01:00:17.901]  of a blood vessel in the arm.
[01:00:17.901 --> 01:00:18.461]  Good God.
[01:00:18.461 --> 01:00:22.301]  Another one has, it's still in her leg now,
[01:00:22.301 --> 01:00:24.861]  it's over a year and it's not dissolving
[01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:26.541]  as I'm administering blood thinners.
[01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:27.581]  As a normal blood thinner.
[01:00:27.581 --> 01:00:27.741]  Right.
[01:00:27.741 --> 01:00:29.181]  So what do we know what they're made of?
[01:00:29.741 --> 01:00:32.621]  They are made of blood clotting elements
[01:00:32.621 --> 01:00:35.661]  loaded with the Wuhan spike protein,
[01:00:35.661 --> 01:00:40.381]  which causes folding, what's called amylogenic changes.
[01:00:40.381 --> 01:00:42.221]  So your cells are producing spike proteins
[01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:44.541]  that then mix with the platelets
[01:00:44.541 --> 01:00:49.021]  and then it's creating these quasi synthetic clots.
[01:00:49.021 --> 01:00:49.581]  That's correct.
[01:00:50.141 --> 01:00:50.381]  Wow.
[01:00:51.261 --> 01:00:52.061]  I interrupted you though.
[01:00:52.621 --> 01:00:54.301]  I'm bad at that, but so many points.
[01:00:54.301 --> 01:00:56.301]  You were saying you're talking to the coroners.
[01:00:57.021 --> 01:00:59.421]  I have personal conversations with coroners
[01:00:59.421 --> 01:01:02.221]  on this to learn the process and is it objective?
[01:01:03.021 --> 01:01:05.421]  John O'Looney in the UK has just gone out.
[01:01:05.421 --> 01:01:07.021]  He's gone viral and he said, listen,
[01:01:07.021 --> 01:01:09.421]  this is going on and he's describing
[01:01:09.421 --> 01:01:10.141]  what he's seeing.
[01:01:10.141 --> 01:01:14.061]  Ryan Cole, pathologist in Idaho, examining these.
[01:01:14.701 --> 01:01:16.781]  I've recently published in the journal
[01:01:16.781 --> 01:01:19.341]  Neurologic Disorders with Stephanie Senoff
[01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:22.141]  and Tony Karagocos from Greece and Greg Nye.
[01:01:23.341 --> 01:01:26.141]  Clearly the rationale for why this is happening,
[01:01:27.021 --> 01:01:29.101]  this explains why simultaneously
[01:01:29.101 --> 01:01:30.781]  there's neurodegenerative disease
[01:01:31.341 --> 01:01:33.821]  that there is a blood clotting going on.
[01:01:33.821 --> 01:01:35.981]  In my practice in the last week, Alex,
[01:01:35.981 --> 01:01:38.621]  I saw two cases of blood clots
[01:01:38.621 --> 01:01:41.581]  forming 18 months after the last shot.
[01:01:42.141 --> 01:01:42.461]  Wow.
[01:01:43.021 --> 01:01:44.781]  18 months after the last shot.
[01:01:44.781 --> 01:01:47.981]  And what's going on is there's some intervening COVID.
[01:01:47.981 --> 01:01:49.981]  So getting the respiratory illness
[01:01:49.981 --> 01:01:53.501]  even further juices the system for more blood clotting.
[01:01:54.061 --> 01:01:56.541]  So in theory, the best would be get COVID,
[01:01:56.541 --> 01:01:59.021]  get early treatment, get little systemic exposure,
[01:01:59.021 --> 01:02:02.061]  never take a vaccine and limit the blood clotting risk.
[01:02:02.061 --> 01:02:04.141]  I just saw a big study at some of the stack here
[01:02:04.141 --> 01:02:05.421]  where they looked at all the different countries
[01:02:05.501 --> 01:02:08.221]  and the ones that didn't take the shots
[01:02:08.221 --> 01:02:10.381]  and didn't have lockdowns, they got over it very quickly.
[01:02:10.381 --> 01:02:11.981]  Those that didn't are still having problems.
[01:02:11.981 --> 01:02:13.501]  Yeah, you'd wanna be in Haiti
[01:02:13.501 --> 01:02:15.581]  or you'd wanna be in Central Africa.
[01:02:15.581 --> 01:02:17.661]  Those countries simply just didn't have the resources
[01:02:18.141 --> 01:02:20.221]  in their treasures to buy these vaccines.
[01:02:20.221 --> 01:02:20.941]  And they did great.
[01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:23.661]  Think about the living conditions in Haiti
[01:02:23.661 --> 01:02:26.781]  and they've had virtually no COVID deaths
[01:02:26.781 --> 01:02:28.381]  and they certainly have zero vaccine deaths
[01:02:28.381 --> 01:02:29.741]  because they haven't given any vaccines.
[01:02:29.741 --> 01:02:34.781]  So bottom line, this is a, almost like a,
[01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:40.701]  what's the term, something that goes into a solution
[01:02:40.701 --> 01:02:42.141]  and causes a chain reaction
[01:02:42.701 --> 01:02:46.541]  and then somehow the spike protein interfaces
[01:02:46.541 --> 01:02:48.861]  with the blood and gels it.
[01:02:48.861 --> 01:02:50.221]  In a sense, like a catalyst,
[01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:53.341]  what we know is if the spike protein is physically
[01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:55.741]  in the clots, there was some studies actually
[01:02:55.741 --> 01:02:58.461]  before the vaccines showing spike protein alone
[01:02:58.461 --> 01:03:00.701]  could induce clotting in the absence of platelets,
[01:03:00.701 --> 01:03:02.301]  which is very interesting,
[01:03:02.301 --> 01:03:04.701]  meaning that fibrin and the other elements
[01:03:04.701 --> 01:03:05.581]  really seem to interact.
[01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:07.101]  Doesn't even need your platelets to do it.
[01:03:07.101 --> 01:03:08.781]  Right, and so the platelets do add on
[01:03:08.781 --> 01:03:12.781]  and obviously in human being, the platelets add onto this,
[01:03:12.781 --> 01:03:15.181]  but this is a very unique blood clot.
[01:03:15.181 --> 01:03:19.341]  It's very unique and the blood clotting that happens,
[01:03:19.341 --> 01:03:21.741]  it happens in areas where there's sluggish flow
[01:03:21.741 --> 01:03:25.181]  like the venous adrenous system in the brain,
[01:03:26.061 --> 01:03:28.941]  the portal vein in the abdomen,
[01:03:28.941 --> 01:03:32.701]  but a remarkable paper by Berhild and colleagues in JAMA
[01:03:33.581 --> 01:03:34.941]  from three Nordic countries.
[01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:37.901]  This is stunning, absolutely stunning.
[01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:40.381]  They described within 28 days of the vaccines
[01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:42.541]  and they have Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca
[01:03:42.541 --> 01:03:44.461]  and they rule out any COVID,
[01:03:44.461 --> 01:03:46.061]  but in three small countries, Alex,
[01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:53.261]  7,750 devastating neurologic strokes and blood clots.
[01:03:54.221 --> 01:03:56.781]  It's absolutely astonishing what these vaccines
[01:03:56.781 --> 01:03:58.061]  are doing on a population level.
[01:03:59.261 --> 01:04:01.741]  I want to go ahead and not just air three minutes
[01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:03.021]  like you wanted to, it's so good
[01:04:03.661 --> 01:04:05.501]  and Dale's good for us to air it.
[01:04:05.501 --> 01:04:07.501]  I want to just take a break and air,
[01:04:07.501 --> 01:04:11.581]  it's a 70 minute clip that's on your Rumble account.
[01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:15.741]  It's also over Dale Big Tree's Highwire, it's excellent.
[01:04:15.741 --> 01:04:18.701]  But I want to air most of this clip
[01:04:19.261 --> 01:04:20.781]  where they're calling for amnesty,
[01:04:20.781 --> 01:04:22.381]  but they're not giving us amnesty.
[01:04:22.381 --> 01:04:23.821]  They're not paid for what they've done
[01:04:23.821 --> 01:04:25.661]  and they're still targeting school children
[01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:27.101]  with this federal authorization
[01:04:27.101 --> 01:04:29.021]  trying to make it mandatory in schools.
[01:04:29.021 --> 01:04:31.181]  So we'll talk about that with Dr. Peter McCullough
[01:04:31.181 --> 01:04:31.821]  on the other side.
[01:04:31.821 --> 01:04:33.741]  And we have a very important announcement
[01:04:33.741 --> 01:04:37.821]  as well on how people can get prepared to deal with this.
[01:04:37.821 --> 01:04:39.341]  We'll also get your latest analysis
[01:04:39.981 --> 01:04:43.341]  on how we can naturally try to bolster our defenses.
[01:04:43.341 --> 01:04:44.141]  That's all coming up.
[01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:46.621]  Please stay with us on the special Saturday transmission
[01:04:46.621 --> 01:04:49.901]  and please share the live feed of this
[01:04:49.901 --> 01:04:52.221]  and we're streaming it out and share the archive.
[01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:54.381]  Like our lives depend on it
[01:04:54.381 --> 01:04:57.021]  because we can have Dr. Peter McCullough with his courage
[01:04:57.021 --> 01:05:00.061]  and him being attacked and all these other great people
[01:05:00.061 --> 01:05:01.901]  and we can have this operation, this great crew.
[01:05:01.901 --> 01:05:05.581]  But if you who are awesome don't share it,
[01:05:05.581 --> 01:05:06.941]  it's like a tree falls in the forest,
[01:05:06.941 --> 01:05:09.341]  nobody heard it, so didn't make a sound, okay?
[01:05:09.981 --> 01:05:12.061]  I mean, I cannot stress enough that people are like,
[01:05:12.061 --> 01:05:13.341]  oh, Dr. McCullough, you're so great
[01:05:13.341 --> 01:05:15.901]  or Alex, you're so good or, you know, no, no.
[01:05:16.541 --> 01:05:18.781]  Literally, it'd be like if I had a box of matches
[01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:20.941]  and trying to build a fire in the freezing cold,
[01:05:20.941 --> 01:05:23.181]  I don't have kindling or wood to do it,
[01:05:23.181 --> 01:05:24.461]  we don't get the fire.
[01:05:24.461 --> 01:05:26.621]  Yes, this broadcast is the match.
[01:05:26.621 --> 01:05:28.621]  We have the evidence, got the match right over here,
[01:05:29.421 --> 01:05:30.861]  but we've got to have the kindling,
[01:05:30.861 --> 01:05:33.261]  we got to have the logs to set this brush fire
[01:05:33.261 --> 01:05:34.061]  in the minds of people.
[01:05:34.061 --> 01:05:36.541]  So literally, I don't want to just strike matches here
[01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:37.821]  in a 100 mile an hour wind.
[01:05:37.821 --> 01:05:40.941]  We get like 500,000 people tune in, you know, live
[01:05:40.941 --> 01:05:42.221]  when we stream this.
[01:05:42.221 --> 01:05:44.941]  If all of you simply share the video from man dot video,
[01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.541]  we'll get five, 10 million views.
[01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:49.341]  That'll be cut up, chain reaction, 100 million views
[01:05:49.421 --> 01:05:51.821]  and we'll go break some more of the globalist ribs, okay?
[01:05:51.821 --> 01:05:54.061]  Cause I'm not doing this to lose, I'm doing it to win.
[01:05:54.781 --> 01:05:57.181]  So we've got the truth, we're going to stop them.
[01:05:57.181 --> 01:05:59.181]  They're coming back with a new attack soon.
[01:05:59.181 --> 01:06:00.541]  We're not going to give them amnesty
[01:06:00.541 --> 01:06:02.061]  until they've had a Nuremberg trial
[01:06:02.061 --> 01:06:04.861]  and we'll pray for them when they're getting hauled up there
[01:06:04.861 --> 01:06:07.101]  after a jury, after they've been found guilty
[01:06:07.101 --> 01:06:09.901]  before we hang their asses for crimes against humanity.
[01:06:09.901 --> 01:06:11.181]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:13.741]  Check out this headline.
[01:06:13.741 --> 01:06:15.821]  You probably saw this in the Atlantic.
[01:06:15.821 --> 01:06:19.021]  Let's declare a pandemic amnesty.
[01:06:19.341 --> 01:06:21.981]  We need to forgive one another for what we did
[01:06:21.981 --> 01:06:24.461]  and said we were in the dark about COVID.
[01:06:24.461 --> 01:06:27.581]  See, this is that insanity plea I'm talking about.
[01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:30.301]  Let's read some of this article cause it's fascinating.
[01:06:30.301 --> 01:06:31.821]  We have to put these fights aside
[01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.661]  and declare a pandemic amnesty.
[01:06:33.661 --> 01:06:35.741]  We can leave out the willful purveyors
[01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:38.301]  of actual misinformation, really?
[01:06:38.301 --> 01:06:39.901]  So we're going to leave out Tony Fauci
[01:06:39.901 --> 01:06:42.301]  and, you know, and the NIH and the CDC
[01:06:42.301 --> 01:06:43.821]  and the FDA that all lied to us
[01:06:43.821 --> 01:06:46.701]  while forgiving the hard calls that people had no choice
[01:06:46.701 --> 01:06:48.381]  but to make with imperfect knowledge.
[01:06:48.381 --> 01:06:49.661]  Oh, so there it is.
[01:06:49.661 --> 01:06:50.781]  Now let's forgive them.
[01:06:50.781 --> 01:06:51.821]  They were making hard calls.
[01:06:51.821 --> 01:06:53.501]  They didn't have the information.
[01:06:53.501 --> 01:06:55.341]  Los Angeles County closed its beaches
[01:06:55.341 --> 01:06:57.821]  in summer 2020 ex post facto.
[01:06:57.821 --> 01:06:59.341]  This means it makes no more sense
[01:06:59.341 --> 01:07:01.421]  than my family's mass hiking trips.
[01:07:01.421 --> 01:07:03.421]  But we need to learn from our mistakes
[01:07:03.421 --> 01:07:04.301]  and then let them go.
[01:07:04.301 --> 01:07:06.301]  We need to forgive the attacks too.
[01:07:06.301 --> 01:07:08.061]  Okay, well, let's think about it.
[01:07:08.061 --> 01:07:08.701]  Let's go on.
[01:07:08.701 --> 01:07:11.261]  All of this gloating and defensiveness continues
[01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:13.261]  to gobble up a lot of social energy
[01:07:13.261 --> 01:07:14.781]  and to drive the culture wars,
[01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:16.221]  especially on the internet.
[01:07:16.221 --> 01:07:18.221]  These discussions are heated, unpleasant,
[01:07:18.221 --> 01:07:19.821]  and ultimately unproductive
[01:07:19.821 --> 01:07:22.381]  in the face of so much uncertainty.
[01:07:22.381 --> 01:07:26.221]  Getting something right had a hefty element of luck.
[01:07:26.221 --> 01:07:28.461]  Oh, so it's luck that the high wire was right
[01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:31.581]  like 99.9999% of the time.
[01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:34.141]  And similarly, getting something wrong
[01:07:34.141 --> 01:07:35.661]  wasn't a moral failing.
[01:07:35.661 --> 01:07:36.781]  Oh, wasn't it?
[01:07:36.781 --> 01:07:39.261]  The standard saying is that those who forget history
[01:07:39.261 --> 01:07:40.221]  are doomed to repeat it.
[01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:41.261]  I agree with that.
[01:07:41.261 --> 01:07:43.581]  But dwelling on the mistakes of history
[01:07:43.581 --> 01:07:46.461]  can lead to repetitive doom loop as well.
[01:07:46.461 --> 01:07:49.021]  Let's acknowledge that we made complicated choices
[01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:51.101]  in the face of deep uncertainty
[01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:53.341]  and then try to work together to build back
[01:07:53.341 --> 01:07:54.141]  and move forward.
[01:07:54.861 --> 01:07:57.421]  Well, look, there's some of that sentiment
[01:07:57.421 --> 01:07:58.301]  that I agree with.
[01:07:58.301 --> 01:07:59.261]  I've told you on this show,
[01:07:59.261 --> 01:08:00.221]  we've got to learn to forgive.
[01:08:00.221 --> 01:08:01.741]  We've got to start having these conversations
[01:08:01.741 --> 01:08:02.941]  with our families again.
[01:08:02.941 --> 01:08:04.701]  Thanksgiving's right around the corner.
[01:08:04.701 --> 01:08:06.061]  Here comes Christmas.
[01:08:06.061 --> 01:08:07.661]  You know, even though we were all banned
[01:08:07.661 --> 01:08:10.461]  from the Thanksgiving table and Christmas table
[01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:13.661]  last year, like we had leprosy or something,
[01:08:13.661 --> 01:08:16.461]  let's be the ones that forgive so we can go back.
[01:08:16.461 --> 01:08:17.741]  But do we forget?
[01:08:17.741 --> 01:08:18.941]  Where are we at?
[01:08:18.941 --> 01:08:20.621]  So I want to discuss this for a moment
[01:08:20.621 --> 01:08:22.861]  because the concept of amnesty,
[01:08:22.861 --> 01:08:24.380]  which is like let's just drop hands
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:26.141]  and forget it ever happened,
[01:08:26.141 --> 01:08:27.661]  really is on the back of a concept
[01:08:27.661 --> 01:08:28.941]  I would say called forgiveness.
[01:08:28.941 --> 01:08:32.300]  So I think in some ways what's being asked of us
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.380]  is to forgive, to forgive our families
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.541]  that banned us from the tables and were mean to us
[01:08:36.541 --> 01:08:37.901]  and said they never wanted to see us
[01:08:37.901 --> 01:08:39.341]  or our children again.
[01:08:39.421 --> 01:08:41.421]  And I think forgiveness is a good thing.
[01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:42.941]  But in order to forgive,
[01:08:42.941 --> 01:08:44.300]  there's something that has to happen.
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:47.021]  First of all, I would really like to take this moment
[01:08:47.021 --> 01:08:49.181]  for everyone out there that thought they were opposed
[01:08:49.181 --> 01:08:50.141]  to the things that I was saying
[01:08:50.141 --> 01:08:52.380]  and were really down with censoring the high wire
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:53.661]  and all those other things.
[01:08:53.661 --> 01:08:56.300]  You know, could you please articulate for me
[01:08:57.021 --> 01:09:01.341]  exactly what it is that we are supposed to forgive?
[01:09:01.341 --> 01:09:02.380]  You see, because I don't know.
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:04.541]  I don't know what you know and what you don't know
[01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:06.300]  and what you don't know that you don't know.
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:07.901]  And I think that that's important
[01:09:07.901 --> 01:09:10.061]  in this place of forgiveness.
[01:09:10.061 --> 01:09:12.221]  So what are we supposed to forgive?
[01:09:12.221 --> 01:09:15.421]  Are we supposed to forgive the fact that, you know,
[01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:18.701]  you locked down and took away our jobs,
[01:09:18.701 --> 01:09:21.341]  our dreams of having a future
[01:09:21.341 --> 01:09:24.380]  that in that process you destroyed our economy,
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.861]  not just in America, but around the world?
[01:09:26.861 --> 01:09:29.261]  Are we supposed to forgive that move?
[01:09:29.261 --> 01:09:31.581]  We're supposed to forgive all the sanitizing
[01:09:31.581 --> 01:09:34.300]  and the spraying and the invasive, you know,
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.380]  destruction of our nasal passages
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.701]  as you tested us with a product
[01:09:38.701 --> 01:09:41.341]  that in itself couldn't even test properly.
[01:09:41.341 --> 01:09:43.581]  And how about all those that died
[01:09:43.581 --> 01:09:45.101]  and weren't treated right in hospitals
[01:09:45.101 --> 01:09:47.741]  and we couldn't even get to them to say goodbye,
[01:09:47.741 --> 01:09:49.661]  our loved ones, our elderly, our aunts,
[01:09:49.661 --> 01:09:51.981]  our uncles, our mothers, our fathers.
[01:09:51.981 --> 01:09:54.701]  Instead, we were left outside and they were left alone.
[01:09:54.701 --> 01:09:56.541]  We couldn't go to a funeral.
[01:09:56.541 --> 01:09:59.261]  And how about all the suicides that took place
[01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:02.221]  and the child abuse and domestic abuse and drug abuse
[01:10:02.221 --> 01:10:05.181]  or turning our children into hypochondriacs?
[01:10:05.181 --> 01:10:06.861]  Are they going to forgive us for that,
[01:10:06.861 --> 01:10:08.300]  for destroying their education
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.781]  and putting them behind in reading and math?
[01:10:10.781 --> 01:10:13.261]  Are we forgiving for all of these reasons
[01:10:13.261 --> 01:10:14.781]  or will our children forgive us?
[01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:17.181]  And how about denying people transplants
[01:10:17.181 --> 01:10:19.341]  because they didn't want an experimental vaccine
[01:10:19.341 --> 01:10:20.781]  that might cause the very problem
[01:10:20.781 --> 01:10:22.141]  they needed a transplant for?
[01:10:22.141 --> 01:10:24.380]  And then the police brutality,
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:27.101]  attacking those people that were standing in their truth,
[01:10:27.101 --> 01:10:29.581]  that wanted to watch their child play in a sports event
[01:10:29.581 --> 01:10:31.741]  without wearing a mask because they knew,
[01:10:31.741 --> 01:10:33.581]  as we now know, masks don't work.
[01:10:33.581 --> 01:10:35.901]  Should we forgive the president who promised us
[01:10:35.901 --> 01:10:38.061]  that he wouldn't force a vaccine upon us,
[01:10:38.061 --> 01:10:40.141]  then took away jobs from the military,
[01:10:40.141 --> 01:10:42.861]  from police officers, from frontline doctors
[01:10:42.861 --> 01:10:45.421]  and firefighters, leaving them with nowhere to go?
[01:10:45.421 --> 01:10:46.861]  And then the injuries,
[01:10:46.861 --> 01:10:49.021]  people suffering from all sorts of seizures
[01:10:49.021 --> 01:10:51.821]  that are unexplained, being left in hospitals
[01:10:51.821 --> 01:10:54.300]  and the lies that were done by the pharmaceutical industry
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.541]  saying that these things never happened.
[01:10:56.541 --> 01:10:58.781]  And then those problematic vaccines,
[01:10:58.781 --> 01:10:59.901]  not only are they hurting people,
[01:10:59.901 --> 01:11:02.061]  but they're still being mandated on our children.
[01:11:02.141 --> 01:11:04.861]  Do we forgive while we continue to give this product
[01:11:04.861 --> 01:11:07.101]  to our innocent children that aren't at risk?
[01:11:07.101 --> 01:11:09.181]  And how many headlines of athletes
[01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:12.701]  crashing into the floor, unable to ever play again,
[01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:14.781]  maybe dead or all of the people,
[01:11:14.781 --> 01:11:15.981]  the performers and the singers
[01:11:15.981 --> 01:11:17.341]  that can't get through a concert,
[01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:19.501]  can't do a concert any longer.
[01:11:19.501 --> 01:11:21.021]  This brand new normal,
[01:11:21.581 --> 01:11:24.300]  is this what we're supposed to forgive and forget
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:28.221]  and have amnesty for while it's happening right now?
[01:11:28.221 --> 01:11:29.661]  And most importantly,
[01:11:29.661 --> 01:11:32.221]  as you talk about the luck factor, I guess,
[01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:34.461]  well, if you got this right, you were lucky.
[01:11:34.461 --> 01:11:36.141]  Now I have to be very clear.
[01:11:36.141 --> 01:11:38.861]  We've said many times and shown you proof
[01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:41.661]  that we told you that they did not test
[01:11:41.661 --> 01:11:44.621]  whether or not the vaccine could stop transmission.
[01:11:45.181 --> 01:11:48.141]  During the trials, this is now known to everybody,
[01:11:48.141 --> 01:11:50.541]  but we knew it because it was written
[01:11:50.541 --> 01:11:52.461]  in our own emergency use authorization
[01:11:52.461 --> 01:11:53.741]  in the very beginning.
[01:11:53.741 --> 01:11:55.181]  We didn't get lucky.
[01:11:55.181 --> 01:11:58.141]  We were reading the science when you were quoting experts
[01:11:58.141 --> 01:12:00.221]  that ended up being liars.
[01:12:00.221 --> 01:12:02.621]  But how about those doctors that weren't liars?
[01:12:02.621 --> 01:12:05.501]  How about the inventor of the mRNA technology?
[01:12:05.501 --> 01:12:06.781]  Did he get lucky?
[01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:08.621]  Did Robert Malone get lucky
[01:12:08.621 --> 01:12:11.661]  when he warned the world I invented this technology
[01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:13.261]  and it's not being used correctly
[01:12:13.261 --> 01:12:14.781]  and it's gonna cause serious harm?
[01:12:14.781 --> 01:12:17.021]  Really, the inventor got lucky?
[01:12:17.581 --> 01:12:19.341]  No, what he got was censored.
[01:12:19.341 --> 01:12:21.661]  He got shut down by the very people
[01:12:21.661 --> 01:12:24.221]  that we're being asked now to give amnesty to.
[01:12:24.221 --> 01:12:25.661]  Oh, how convenient.
[01:12:26.221 --> 01:12:27.501]  Or what about the doctors
[01:12:27.501 --> 01:12:29.981]  that still have their licenses under attack
[01:12:29.981 --> 01:12:32.781]  by laws that just got passed in California
[01:12:32.781 --> 01:12:34.221]  and are being written in other states,
[01:12:34.221 --> 01:12:36.621]  California law to set regulate dissemination
[01:12:36.621 --> 01:12:38.861]  of misinformation related to COVID-19.
[01:12:38.861 --> 01:12:41.101]  Meaning if you said any of the things
[01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:42.781]  that now proved to be true,
[01:12:42.781 --> 01:12:44.621]  like the vaccine doesn't work
[01:12:44.621 --> 01:12:46.781]  or this virus has a very low death rate,
[01:12:46.781 --> 01:12:48.461]  or maybe you should try ivermectin
[01:12:48.461 --> 01:12:50.061]  or hydroxychloroquine,
[01:12:50.061 --> 01:12:51.821]  you could lose your license.
[01:12:51.821 --> 01:12:55.181]  Or in the case of the most world renowned heart doctor
[01:12:55.261 --> 01:12:57.821]  in the world, Dr. Peter McCullough,
[01:12:57.821 --> 01:13:00.141]  he now has his board certifications
[01:13:00.141 --> 01:13:03.101]  that make him a cardiologist being taken away.
[01:13:03.101 --> 01:13:03.901]  Why?
[01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:05.741]  Because he's been quoting the science
[01:13:05.741 --> 01:13:08.221]  from around the world on blood clots,
[01:13:08.221 --> 01:13:09.981]  on thrombocytopenia,
[01:13:09.981 --> 01:13:12.221]  on myocarditis, the swelling of the heart,
[01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:15.341]  which is something he knows better than anyone else about.
[01:13:15.341 --> 01:13:17.101]  But still no, in the moment
[01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.941]  where his license is being removed
[01:13:18.941 --> 01:13:20.300]  and he is under attack
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.701]  and where his certifications are being taken away,
[01:13:22.701 --> 01:13:24.701]  we're supposed to give amnesty right now?
[01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:27.341]  You see, this is the problem.
[01:13:28.061 --> 01:13:30.941]  We are not even through this situation
[01:13:30.941 --> 01:13:32.781]  and I have not heard you articulate.
[01:13:32.781 --> 01:13:33.981]  I'm still listening.
[01:13:33.981 --> 01:13:36.221]  I'm still listening for exactly what it is
[01:13:36.221 --> 01:13:39.261]  you understand I'm supposed to forgive you for.
[01:13:40.141 --> 01:13:43.101]  Because there's a word that goes along with forgiveness
[01:13:43.101 --> 01:13:44.861]  if we're gonna look at sort of the biblical
[01:13:44.861 --> 01:13:46.461]  or spiritual nature of this.
[01:13:47.181 --> 01:13:49.341]  And that word is repent.
[01:13:49.901 --> 01:13:51.981]  You see, in order to deserve to be forgiven,
[01:13:52.541 --> 01:13:55.661]  you must articulate what you're being forgiven for.
[01:13:55.661 --> 01:13:57.261]  That's called repenting.
[01:13:58.221 --> 01:13:59.661]  Or how about, you know,
[01:13:59.661 --> 01:14:01.261]  when we think of a court case,
[01:14:01.261 --> 01:14:02.701]  where's your remorse?
[01:14:02.701 --> 01:14:04.221]  What are you remorseful for?
[01:14:04.221 --> 01:14:07.101]  Please explain to me what you think you did wrong here.
[01:14:07.821 --> 01:14:09.901]  Because in the Nuremberg trials,
[01:14:09.901 --> 01:14:11.661]  which is what may be about to happen
[01:14:11.661 --> 01:14:13.421]  should we get a new Senate in Congress
[01:14:13.421 --> 01:14:15.421]  here in the United States of America,
[01:14:15.421 --> 01:14:17.501]  the doctors did not repent.
[01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:19.501]  They did not say we made a mistake.
[01:14:19.501 --> 01:14:20.781]  What they said was,
[01:14:20.861 --> 01:14:21.821]  we didn't know better.
[01:14:21.821 --> 01:14:23.261]  There was no way for us to know.
[01:14:23.261 --> 01:14:24.541]  We were following orders.
[01:14:24.541 --> 01:14:27.181]  We were just doing what we were told.
[01:14:27.181 --> 01:14:28.541]  There was no way to know better.
[01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:30.300]  The science changed on us.
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.501]  As it turns out now,
[01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:33.181]  obviously sitting in this courtroom,
[01:14:33.181 --> 01:14:36.141]  it wasn't okay to test on innocent children products
[01:14:36.141 --> 01:14:38.061]  that hadn't been properly safety tested.
[01:14:38.061 --> 01:14:41.981]  It wasn't okay to avoid the proof of myocarditis
[01:14:41.981 --> 01:14:44.621]  and blood clotting and thrombocytopenia
[01:14:44.621 --> 01:14:46.380]  and anaphylaxis and all the things
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:47.501]  that we were seeing with the products.
[01:14:47.501 --> 01:14:50.380]  Okay, yes, benefit of hindsight now.
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:51.501]  Maybe you could say that,
[01:14:52.061 --> 01:14:53.981]  but we didn't know it then.
[01:14:53.981 --> 01:14:55.821]  Therefore, we must be forgiven.
[01:14:56.621 --> 01:14:58.781]  Well, I'm all about forgiveness,
[01:14:59.501 --> 01:15:02.300]  but I'm not even ready for that conversation
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:05.181]  until I hear those that made this mistake,
[01:15:05.181 --> 01:15:06.941]  those that continue to censor,
[01:15:06.941 --> 01:15:08.781]  those that continue to attack
[01:15:08.781 --> 01:15:10.861]  and those that will not admit
[01:15:10.861 --> 01:15:14.861]  that these are not sudden adult dead syndrome deaths.
[01:15:14.861 --> 01:15:17.341]  We are not randomly seeing the rise of death
[01:15:17.341 --> 01:15:19.581]  and excess mortality around the world
[01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:22.461]  because maybe we locked down for the wrong reasons.
[01:15:22.461 --> 01:15:24.941]  No, when you stop being mystified
[01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:28.141]  by this rise in death and get to the reality
[01:15:28.141 --> 01:15:29.901]  that you gave an unproven,
[01:15:29.901 --> 01:15:31.901]  untested pharmaceutical product
[01:15:31.901 --> 01:15:34.221]  that was killing every animal in the animal trials
[01:15:34.221 --> 01:15:36.061]  prior to giving it to human beings,
[01:15:36.061 --> 01:15:38.461]  when you admit that just maybe
[01:15:38.461 --> 01:15:42.221]  it's the vaccine that is now killing all of us
[01:15:42.221 --> 01:15:43.661]  around the world that are dying
[01:15:43.661 --> 01:15:46.061]  and collapsing on fields and collapsing on stages,
[01:15:46.941 --> 01:15:49.181]  it seems to me we're a long ways away from that.
[01:15:49.581 --> 01:15:52.221]  When I think about where Jimmy Kimmel stood
[01:15:52.221 --> 01:15:53.021]  in the middle of this,
[01:15:53.021 --> 01:15:55.421]  shall we forgive him for saying things like this?
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:59.341]  Dr. Fauci said that if hospitals get any more overcrowded,
[01:15:59.341 --> 01:16:01.581]  they're going to have to make some very tough choices
[01:16:01.581 --> 01:16:03.581]  about who gets an ICU bed.
[01:16:03.581 --> 01:16:05.501]  That choice doesn't seem so tough to me.
[01:16:05.501 --> 01:16:07.261]  Vaccinated person having a heart attack?
[01:16:07.261 --> 01:16:08.221]  Yes, come right on in.
[01:16:08.221 --> 01:16:09.261]  We'll take care of you.
[01:16:09.261 --> 01:16:12.300]  Unvaccinated guy who gobbled horse goo?
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:13.421]  Rest in peace, Wheezy.
[01:16:13.421 --> 01:16:21.501]  I mean, we still got a lot of pan dimwits out there.
[01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:24.461]  I guess it's ironic that he said,
[01:16:24.461 --> 01:16:26.941]  you know, vaccinated guy needing,
[01:16:26.941 --> 01:16:28.300]  you know, having a heart attack,
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:30.300]  which is exactly what appears to be happening
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:32.461]  to the vaccinated people around the world.
[01:16:32.461 --> 01:16:33.901]  But if you're unvaccinated,
[01:16:33.901 --> 01:16:35.421]  have any need for the hospital,
[01:16:35.421 --> 01:16:37.421]  screw you, I want you to die.
[01:16:37.421 --> 01:16:38.701]  You know, they're harsh words.
[01:16:38.701 --> 01:16:40.380]  It doesn't mean that just harsh words
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:41.821]  that we shouldn't forgive them.
[01:16:41.821 --> 01:16:43.181]  And I suppose that there's those
[01:16:43.181 --> 01:16:44.380]  that went through the Holocaust
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.821]  that have to deal with themselves
[01:16:45.821 --> 01:16:47.021]  and ask themselves,
[01:16:47.021 --> 01:16:49.261]  should I forgive the doctors that were ended up,
[01:16:49.261 --> 01:16:52.141]  you know, being hung after the Nuremberg trials,
[01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:54.701]  after the courts decided it wasn't okay
[01:16:54.701 --> 01:16:56.861]  just because that's what you were told to do,
[01:16:56.861 --> 01:16:59.261]  just because you thought you were doing what was right.
[01:16:59.821 --> 01:17:02.861]  In the end, it was wrong and you should have known better.
[01:17:02.861 --> 01:17:04.380]  How do we know you know better?
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:06.941]  When you tell us what you did wrong
[01:17:06.941 --> 01:17:08.541]  and that you actually know better.
[01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:09.821]  It's time to repent.
[01:17:09.821 --> 01:17:12.300]  When you're ready to repent, I'm ready to forgive.
[01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:15.581]  And in that moment, and then and only then,
[01:17:15.581 --> 01:17:17.581]  will we consider amnesty.

[01:18:13.821 --> 01:18:15.341]  If you don't boost your immune system,
[01:18:15.341 --> 01:18:17.421]  plus it keeps us on air, a win-win.
[01:18:33.661 --> 01:18:36.461]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[01:18:39.501 --> 01:18:41.421]  All right, we're about to talk about something
[01:18:41.421 --> 01:18:43.901]  central to winning the war against tyranny,
[01:18:43.901 --> 01:18:46.621]  and that's realizing why they target people like myself,
[01:18:47.341 --> 01:18:49.341]  why they target people like Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:18:49.981 --> 01:18:51.981]  It's not about stopping us at the end of the day.
[01:18:51.981 --> 01:18:53.501]  It's about intimidating others.
[01:18:54.061 --> 01:18:55.741]  Because I was just asking him during that tape
[01:18:55.741 --> 01:18:57.501]  we just played of Del Bigtree,
[01:18:58.461 --> 01:18:59.901]  how are you doing through all this?
[01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:01.101]  What do you think their end game is?
[01:19:01.101 --> 01:19:03.261]  And he basically said what I just said on air,
[01:19:03.261 --> 01:19:05.581]  because he's been through the same stuff we have.
[01:19:05.581 --> 01:19:06.461]  He understands it.
[01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:08.861]  But for you to understand this is critical.
[01:19:08.861 --> 01:19:11.581]  And for other doctors and scientists and researchers,
[01:19:11.581 --> 01:19:14.221]  but also mothers and fathers and daughters and sons
[01:19:14.221 --> 01:19:17.021]  and people speaking out about what they witnessed
[01:19:17.021 --> 01:19:18.461]  having your voice heard,
[01:19:18.461 --> 01:19:22.861]  this corruption, this evil can't take place
[01:19:22.861 --> 01:19:24.221]  unless they can silence us.
[01:19:24.221 --> 01:19:26.461]  So talk about what you've been through personally
[01:19:26.461 --> 01:19:30.300]  in this saga and your advice to others about where we are.
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:32.221]  Because clearly we're winning the fight
[01:19:32.221 --> 01:19:33.661]  for hearts and minds right now.
[01:19:33.661 --> 01:19:36.300]  The folks that launched this attack are in deep trouble.
[01:19:36.461 --> 01:19:38.861]  I think that's very fair to say,
[01:19:38.861 --> 01:19:41.741]  but understanding how they're striking back
[01:19:41.741 --> 01:19:43.661]  is key to our eventual total victory.
[01:19:44.221 --> 01:19:45.421]  I agree.
[01:19:45.421 --> 01:19:47.821]  As a practicing internist and cardiologist
[01:19:47.821 --> 01:19:50.221]  trained in epidemiology at University of Michigan,
[01:19:50.941 --> 01:19:53.021]  I'm the most published person in my field
[01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:54.061]  in the world in history
[01:19:54.061 --> 01:19:55.981]  in terms of heart-kidney interactions.
[01:19:55.981 --> 01:20:00.061]  I now have 60 peer-reviewed publications in COVID-19.
[01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:03.261]  I've made myself a COVID-19 expert.
[01:20:03.261 --> 01:20:06.221]  I essentially now have three years of on the job
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:08.300]  training, scholarship, fellowship.
[01:20:08.941 --> 01:20:11.581]  And I've published the seminal approaches
[01:20:11.581 --> 01:20:12.861]  to how to treat the illness,
[01:20:12.861 --> 01:20:15.101]  collaborated with doctors all over the world.
[01:20:15.981 --> 01:20:17.741]  My commentary and my analysis,
[01:20:17.741 --> 01:20:20.141]  my testimony has been beyond reproach
[01:20:20.141 --> 01:20:22.061]  in terms of precision and citation.
[01:20:22.701 --> 01:20:26.380]  And what has occurred to me is not about me.
[01:20:27.101 --> 01:20:30.300]  It's actually about trying to silence others,
[01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:33.661]  to hold me out as an example.
[01:20:33.661 --> 01:20:35.901]  So I've now lost two jobs.
[01:20:35.981 --> 01:20:39.181]  Alex, on Friday, I was terminated
[01:20:39.181 --> 01:20:43.981]  from my practice job in Dallas without due process,
[01:20:43.981 --> 01:20:45.741]  without any clear reason.
[01:20:48.061 --> 01:20:50.141]  The uncomfortableness in the room
[01:20:50.141 --> 01:20:52.781]  is that neither the people doing the termination
[01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:54.221]  nor me wanted the termination.
[01:20:54.221 --> 01:20:57.421]  It was pretty obvious that something is going on.
[01:20:58.061 --> 01:21:00.461]  I've been stripped of two editorships
[01:21:00.461 --> 01:21:02.141]  where the impact factor was rising.
[01:21:02.141 --> 01:21:04.861]  My track record as an editor at two major journals,
[01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:06.300]  Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:09.741]  and Cardiorenal Medicine was again beyond reproach
[01:21:10.621 --> 01:21:14.221]  by certified letter or email with no explanation.
[01:21:14.221 --> 01:21:16.061]  I've been stripped of two professorships
[01:21:16.061 --> 01:21:17.341]  here in the state of Texas,
[01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:19.181]  one with a follow-up letter that said,
[01:21:19.741 --> 01:21:22.141]  if we see our name next to yours,
[01:21:22.861 --> 01:21:23.661]  we're gonna sue you.
[01:21:23.661 --> 01:21:25.901]  So a preemptive lawsuit letter.
[01:21:25.901 --> 01:21:28.300]  I have a crushing lawsuit against me
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.461]  by the biggest health system in Texas
[01:21:31.021 --> 01:21:33.341]  with motions are not heard by the judge.
[01:21:33.341 --> 01:21:36.061]  I paid for mediation, a mediation office.
[01:21:36.061 --> 01:21:37.821]  Mediation doesn't solve it in a day.
[01:21:37.821 --> 01:21:39.581]  It is endless in the lawsuit.
[01:21:39.581 --> 01:21:41.101]  They keep adding additional things
[01:21:41.101 --> 01:21:43.581]  into some type of settlement agreement.
[01:21:44.141 --> 01:21:48.061]  I have had an entire society.
[01:21:48.061 --> 01:21:49.981]  I was the president of the society,
[01:21:49.981 --> 01:21:51.821]  the Cardiorenal Society of America, Alex.
[01:21:52.541 --> 01:21:54.221]  It was dissolved.
[01:21:54.221 --> 01:21:55.741]  My society was dissolved.
[01:21:55.741 --> 01:21:58.141]  600 members without any,
[01:21:58.701 --> 01:22:01.501]  none of these events occurred without any due process.
[01:22:01.501 --> 01:22:03.181]  There was no courtesy phone call.
[01:22:03.181 --> 01:22:05.101]  There was no board meeting, nothing.
[01:22:05.101 --> 01:22:06.781]  So when a police officer writes you a ticket
[01:22:06.781 --> 01:22:08.541]  for driving 10 miles over the speed limit,
[01:22:08.541 --> 01:22:11.101]  you have a day in court and they tell you what you did.
[01:22:11.101 --> 01:22:12.461]  It's very Kafkaesque.
[01:22:12.461 --> 01:22:14.861]  They won't even tell you what you've supposedly done.
[01:22:14.861 --> 01:22:17.661]  No, these are one or two sentence letters.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:21.421]  Professor of Medicine status is a status
[01:22:21.421 --> 01:22:24.141]  that's hard earned after decades of scholarship
[01:22:24.141 --> 01:22:25.181]  and work clinical care.
[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:29.181]  When there is a problem, there is a due process.
[01:22:29.181 --> 01:22:32.621]  There's faculty senate and there is a discussion
[01:22:32.621 --> 01:22:35.421]  of what was said and who agrees and who disagrees.
[01:22:35.421 --> 01:22:36.861]  When there's a journal,
[01:22:37.421 --> 01:22:39.261]  there's an editorial board meeting
[01:22:39.261 --> 01:22:41.101]  and there's a discussion if there's an outgoing editor.
[01:22:41.101 --> 01:22:42.061]  Well, we know who's behind it.
[01:22:42.061 --> 01:22:44.861]  It's DHS and the Disinformation Governance Board.
[01:22:44.861 --> 01:22:47.661]  That broke a week ago, confirmed documents
[01:22:47.661 --> 01:22:49.821]  that they are targeting and harassing scientists
[01:22:49.821 --> 01:22:53.901]  and doctors that challenge the official story
[01:22:53.901 --> 01:22:55.741]  because the official story is a lie.
[01:22:55.741 --> 01:22:57.021]  It's reasonable to assume
[01:22:57.581 --> 01:22:59.661]  that powerful government agencies
[01:22:59.661 --> 01:23:01.421]  or working through intermediaries,
[01:23:01.421 --> 01:23:04.380]  consultants actually try mechanisms to cover.
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:05.021]  Well, that's what it says.
[01:23:05.021 --> 01:23:08.300]  They use the boards and think tanks and NGOs to carry it out.
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:10.380]  Right, they probably are working through intermediaries
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:12.461]  and there's likely money is being transferred
[01:23:12.461 --> 01:23:15.101]  as emergency countermeasure funding.
[01:23:15.101 --> 01:23:17.021]  I can't verify any of this,
[01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:19.981]  but I am telling you this has the look and feel
[01:23:19.981 --> 01:23:22.701]  of a government operation against its own people,
[01:23:22.701 --> 01:23:25.261]  targeting people of very high profile
[01:23:25.261 --> 01:23:27.501]  like yourself and myself.
[01:23:28.221 --> 01:23:31.421]  And again, the message is actually not for us.
[01:23:31.421 --> 01:23:33.341]  We actually get stronger and louder.
[01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:34.380]  We're perfectly fine.
[01:23:35.341 --> 01:23:37.661]  In fact, this is very similar to that Star Wars scene
[01:23:37.661 --> 01:23:40.941]  where Darth Vader is gonna strike down OB-1 Kenobi
[01:23:40.941 --> 01:23:42.621]  and he says, Darth, if you strike me down,
[01:23:42.621 --> 01:23:44.781]  I'll come back even more powerful.
[01:23:44.781 --> 01:23:45.741]  And it's true.
[01:23:45.741 --> 01:23:47.341]  It's not about us, Alex.
[01:23:47.341 --> 01:23:49.101]  It's about silencing everybody else.
[01:23:49.901 --> 01:23:50.941]  And that is the key.
[01:23:50.941 --> 01:23:55.261]  So let's talk about building our new own economies.
[01:23:55.261 --> 01:23:57.581]  Let's talk about a great law that Trump passed
[01:23:58.461 --> 01:24:02.300]  that allowed doctors with licensure
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:04.541]  to operate all over the United States.
[01:24:04.541 --> 01:24:07.261]  I know Tucker Carlson covered this a week ago.
[01:24:07.901 --> 01:24:10.701]  Foster Coulson headed up by you.
[01:24:10.701 --> 01:24:12.701]  There are a lot of great telephonic medicine,
[01:24:12.701 --> 01:24:13.901]  a lot of great online medicine,
[01:24:13.901 --> 01:24:16.941]  but you guys have launched the wellness company,
[01:24:16.941 --> 01:24:18.861]  which I am so proud to be promoting,
[01:24:18.861 --> 01:24:20.461]  which is gonna be a big part of the show now
[01:24:20.461 --> 01:24:21.981]  because there's a lot of other great groups out there.
[01:24:21.981 --> 01:24:23.741]  But I know you're the best.
[01:24:23.741 --> 01:24:27.261]  I know that Foster Coulson is a great manager
[01:24:27.261 --> 01:24:29.181]  and had really done great companies before.
[01:24:29.181 --> 01:24:31.741]  You guys are putting the very best groups together.
[01:24:32.621 --> 01:24:35.261]  People can find out about it at onlinehealthnow.
[01:24:35.261 --> 01:24:38.141]  One word, onlinehealthnow.com
[01:24:38.141 --> 01:24:40.141]  and we'll put that URL up on screen
[01:24:40.941 --> 01:24:42.300]  there in your name key.
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:45.021]  But tell us about this because this is exciting.
[01:24:45.021 --> 01:24:47.821]  When big pharma and medicine is being bought off,
[01:24:47.821 --> 01:24:49.821]  we still have free market rights
[01:24:49.821 --> 01:24:52.701]  to go out and choose the market where we see fit
[01:24:52.701 --> 01:24:54.540]  and basically displace the steering.
[01:24:55.501 --> 01:24:57.901]  What's occurred over the last three years
[01:24:57.901 --> 01:25:02.141]  has taught Americans that trust is everything
[01:25:02.141 --> 01:25:06.620]  in their healthcare providers, doctors, nurses,
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:08.781]  nurse practitioners, physician assistants,
[01:25:08.781 --> 01:25:10.941]  other allied health professionals.
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:15.181]  Among our team was started to be fracturing
[01:25:15.181 --> 01:25:17.181]  where people walked off the job
[01:25:17.181 --> 01:25:20.460]  because they didn't like what they were seeing was going on.
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:22.460]  Many felt the oppression of the vaccines.
[01:25:23.501 --> 01:25:24.861]  And we've said for a while
[01:25:25.501 --> 01:25:27.981]  that there must be an alternative.
[01:25:27.981 --> 01:25:29.421]  There must be something else
[01:25:29.981 --> 01:25:36.540]  than this authoritarian, totalitarian takeover of medicine.
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:41.261]  And e-commerce juggernaut Foster Coulson out of Canada
[01:25:41.821 --> 01:25:43.901]  has really, really stepped up
[01:25:43.901 --> 01:25:46.380]  and he's been working feverishly for months.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:47.581]  He reached out to myself
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:52.941]  and we formed actually a what's called Chief Medical Board.
[01:25:52.941 --> 01:25:55.581]  I'm the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[01:25:55.581 --> 01:25:57.261]  I've taken a board position.
[01:25:57.261 --> 01:26:00.460]  Richard Amerling, formerly Dean of the School of Medicine,
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:02.701]  a very, very renowned nephrologist
[01:26:02.701 --> 01:26:06.460]  is heading up the medical affairs.
[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:10.141]  Heather Gessling, a family physician from Missouri,
[01:26:10.141 --> 01:26:12.141]  leading up the clinical details.
[01:26:12.781 --> 01:26:15.661]  And then we have Harvey Risch who's recently retired
[01:26:15.661 --> 01:26:17.341]  from Yale University in Epidemiology.
[01:26:17.341 --> 01:26:19.181]  He is our Chief Epidemiologist.
[01:26:19.181 --> 01:26:20.540]  He's not a practicing doctor,
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.701]  but he's been a frequent contributor with me
[01:26:22.701 --> 01:26:25.021]  on Fox News now for several years.
[01:26:25.021 --> 01:26:27.501]  So quantify how big this is.
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:30.300]  You have a license, they have license,
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.901]  the system's trying to stop it.
[01:26:31.901 --> 01:26:34.861]  What happens when real doctors and scientists get together
[01:26:34.861 --> 01:26:37.021]  and create their own systems?
[01:26:37.021 --> 01:26:39.661]  That is the absolute libertarian way to counter this.
[01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:44.941]  Because we have the power of not only creating websites and apps,
[01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:47.021]  but creating what's called verticals.
[01:26:47.741 --> 01:26:49.981]  There is an entire vertical of healthcare
[01:26:49.981 --> 01:26:51.661]  of telemedicine doctors.
[01:26:51.661 --> 01:26:55.581]  Many of them, the groups are working in coalescing
[01:26:55.581 --> 01:26:59.741]  to provide 24 by seven healthcare through your phone.
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:03.101]  So bottom line, there's a massive attack on doctors,
[01:27:03.101 --> 01:27:07.501]  nurse practitioners, nurses, scientists, researchers.
[01:27:07.501 --> 01:27:08.781]  They're all looking for a home.
[01:27:08.781 --> 01:27:11.741]  We get top names with top funding
[01:27:11.741 --> 01:27:13.741]  to then create the new future.
[01:27:13.741 --> 01:27:15.181]  That's exactly right.
[01:27:15.821 --> 01:27:17.741]  So the doctors are coming on board.
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:21.661]  Issues like malpractice and electronic records
[01:27:21.661 --> 01:27:24.300]  and all of that now is doctors are being relieved
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:25.741]  of that through this new system.
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:27.661]  That's something great Trump did.
[01:27:27.661 --> 01:27:28.701]  Let's go back to the beginning.
[01:27:28.701 --> 01:27:30.941]  Trump passed this law of getting this done.
[01:27:30.941 --> 01:27:32.061]  I give him a lot of credit.
[01:27:32.061 --> 01:27:35.821]  He moved quickly on many aspects of the pandemic,
[01:27:35.821 --> 01:27:37.021]  but this one was big.
[01:27:37.021 --> 01:27:38.861]  This was part of some of the relief measures
[01:27:38.861 --> 01:27:41.661]  where doctors then had so much more freedom
[01:27:41.661 --> 01:27:44.061]  in terms of their practice using telemedicine.
[01:27:44.061 --> 01:27:46.061]  And the television technology got better,
[01:27:46.061 --> 01:27:49.261]  but it's the practice of medicine, Alex,
[01:27:49.261 --> 01:27:52.460]  that can actually be integrated with labs taken in the home.
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:53.741]  So someone comes out to the home,
[01:27:53.741 --> 01:27:54.781]  can get a blood sample.
[01:27:55.421 --> 01:27:58.141]  We now have integration with diagnostics
[01:27:58.141 --> 01:28:01.261]  so people can get x-rays, ultrasounds, et cetera.
[01:28:01.261 --> 01:28:03.341]  Sure, we can use the technocracy's new economy
[01:28:03.341 --> 01:28:04.941]  against them that everything's integrated.
[01:28:04.941 --> 01:28:07.341]  Right, and so the integration part is key.
[01:28:07.341 --> 01:28:09.421]  Another key part is pharmacies.
[01:28:09.421 --> 01:28:12.540]  Do you know we have the big brand name pharmacies
[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:14.460]  that worked against patients and doctors,
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:16.300]  that's CVS, Walgreens, and others,
[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:19.181]  but the community pharmacies, they were the heroes.
[01:28:19.181 --> 01:28:21.581]  Now the community pharmacies are aligned
[01:28:21.581 --> 01:28:23.981]  in this type of approach as a vertical.
[01:28:23.981 --> 01:28:27.501]  So that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
[01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:29.261]  The hell of the last three years, though,
[01:28:29.901 --> 01:28:32.941]  with resistance is producing the future of our health.
[01:28:32.941 --> 01:28:39.741]  That's right, and with absolutely no impediment
[01:28:39.741 --> 01:28:41.581]  to receiving high quality care,
[01:28:41.581 --> 01:28:43.581]  receiving the medicines that people need,
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.061]  and getting it in a timely fashion,
[01:28:46.061 --> 01:28:48.380]  there's verticals for health coaches
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:51.341]  and other allied health personnel,
[01:28:51.901 --> 01:28:53.501]  nutraceuticals and supplements.
[01:28:53.501 --> 01:28:55.341]  So there's an online store.
[01:28:55.341 --> 01:28:57.181]  Foster Coulson got into this
[01:28:57.181 --> 01:29:00.061]  actually helping the Zelenco Foundation,
[01:29:00.061 --> 01:29:03.741]  Zev Zelenco and his innovation with the ZStack.
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:07.501]  And now the wellness company has been born.
[01:29:07.501 --> 01:29:12.221]  It literally, the doors, it just hit its opening,
[01:29:12.221 --> 01:29:13.901]  if you will, just a few weeks ago.
[01:29:13.901 --> 01:29:15.501]  Foster Coulson came down.
[01:29:15.501 --> 01:29:17.261]  He was in the Tucker Carlson studio,
[01:29:17.261 --> 01:29:21.821]  did an hour long program with Tucker, very, very dynamic.
[01:29:21.821 --> 01:29:24.061]  And onlinehealthnow.com,
[01:29:24.061 --> 01:29:27.021]  and there've been other great groups trying this.
[01:29:27.021 --> 01:29:28.781]  They saved so many lives with therapeutics.
[01:29:29.501 --> 01:29:31.741]  We saw so many of the big pharmacies gouging people,
[01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:33.981]  not giving them ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine,
[01:29:33.981 --> 01:29:36.300]  not giving them the steroid aerosolizers,
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:38.781]  but it was the online folks that got around it
[01:29:38.781 --> 01:29:40.701]  and really saved millions of lives.
[01:29:40.701 --> 01:29:42.941]  And now you guys with the top people
[01:29:42.941 --> 01:29:45.341]  and real funding are now launching this
[01:29:45.341 --> 01:29:46.941]  to really be the future of medicine
[01:29:46.941 --> 01:29:48.781]  and a counter to the free market
[01:29:49.421 --> 01:29:53.021]  to big pharma's takeover of much of our medical system.
[01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:54.701]  That's completely correct.
[01:29:54.701 --> 01:29:56.701]  And let's give credit to these groups
[01:29:56.701 --> 01:29:58.141]  that really got things going.
[01:29:58.141 --> 01:30:01.101]  So we had Ben Marble and MyFreeDoctor.com,
[01:30:01.101 --> 01:30:02.540]  basically a charity service.
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:05.261]  Ben's delivery carry under testimony in the US Senate.
[01:30:05.261 --> 01:30:07.421]  Ben indicated he has treated with his group
[01:30:07.421 --> 01:30:09.341]  300,000 Americans with COVID.
[01:30:09.341 --> 01:30:11.501]  I mean, this is a stunning accomplishment.
[01:30:11.501 --> 01:30:12.781]  Frontline Critical Care Network-
[01:30:12.781 --> 01:30:13.581]  And almost no deaths.
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:15.901]  Just a handful of deaths.
[01:30:15.901 --> 01:30:17.181]  Frontline Critical Care Network,
[01:30:18.141 --> 01:30:20.701]  Paul Merrick and Pierre Corey,
[01:30:20.701 --> 01:30:22.460]  FLCC is a delivery mechanism,
[01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:24.540]  American Frontline Doctors, Simone Gold.
[01:30:25.181 --> 01:30:28.781]  Give credit to these, Speak with an MD was another one.
[01:30:28.781 --> 01:30:30.380]  These organizations, many-
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:33.421]  I can tell you, look, I got COVID
[01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:35.421]  and I've had flu, I've had other stuff,
[01:30:35.421 --> 01:30:36.540]  and I'm a pretty healthy guy.
[01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:38.141]  I think it's every three or four years.
[01:30:38.141 --> 01:30:40.141]  I felt like a gorilla was on my chest,
[01:30:40.141 --> 01:30:41.341]  almost killed my dad and my mom.
[01:30:41.341 --> 01:30:43.821]  My wife is like an athlete and she was like,
[01:30:43.821 --> 01:30:45.261]  I need to go to the hospital, I can't breathe.
[01:30:45.261 --> 01:30:47.341]  And then I got involved with one of the telephonic doctors
[01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:49.101]  we had on the show and they got me.
[01:30:49.101 --> 01:30:51.741]  And within hours, I felt a lot better within a day,
[01:30:51.741 --> 01:30:52.861]  almost completely better.
[01:30:52.861 --> 01:30:54.141]  It was like night and day.
[01:30:54.141 --> 01:30:55.741]  And if I had gone to a mainline doctor,
[01:30:55.741 --> 01:30:57.741]  I'd have been in the hospital on a ventilator, dead.
[01:30:57.741 --> 01:30:58.620]  Absolutely.
[01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.941]  And you know, the US government and the agencies
[01:31:00.941 --> 01:31:03.901]  and all the countermeasure money didn't give a penny
[01:31:03.901 --> 01:31:05.421]  to these telemedicine services.
[01:31:05.421 --> 01:31:08.781]  They gave 50,000 plus bucks to put some on a ventilator.
[01:31:08.781 --> 01:31:09.341]  That's true.
[01:31:09.341 --> 01:31:11.501]  It was just, it was all counterproductive.
[01:31:11.501 --> 01:31:14.380]  These telemedicine companies were heroes.
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:17.101]  Many of them, I think will probably be very attractive
[01:31:17.101 --> 01:31:21.981]  to fold in with the wellness company and be well-supported.
[01:31:21.981 --> 01:31:23.741]  I'm really proud of the effort.
[01:31:23.741 --> 01:31:26.540]  I know my practice will be migrating onto the platform.
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:28.380]  I'm gonna be much more flexible.
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:31.341]  I'll have the alacrity to do what I need to do
[01:31:31.901 --> 01:31:35.821]  because patients nowadays, they expect to get a doctor
[01:31:35.821 --> 01:31:38.701]  by their cell phone and have a communication
[01:31:38.701 --> 01:31:41.901]  and be able to head off some disaster before it happens.
[01:31:41.901 --> 01:31:43.181]  The only way we can do it is to-
[01:31:43.181 --> 01:31:46.941]  So this is educated doctors and researchers and pharmacists
[01:31:46.941 --> 01:31:47.901]  that are ready to deliver.
[01:31:47.901 --> 01:31:49.421]  And again, we'll put that back on screen,
[01:31:49.421 --> 01:31:50.540]  the official website.
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:53.181]  But when you go to onlinehealthnow.com,
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:55.901]  I'm working to get them, but I'm doing it right now
[01:31:55.901 --> 01:31:57.581]  to support it as a sponsor
[01:31:57.581 --> 01:31:59.821]  because I totally trust Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:31:59.821 --> 01:32:02.300]  I know how great the funding is of this.
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:03.901]  All the folks are getting involved in.
[01:32:03.901 --> 01:32:07.261]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:32:07.261 --> 01:32:10.221]  It is so important that you have access to real doctors,
[01:32:10.221 --> 01:32:13.261]  real pharmacists, real folks that can send you
[01:32:13.261 --> 01:32:15.501]  to other trusted doctors in your area,
[01:32:15.501 --> 01:32:17.181]  nurse practitioners in your area,
[01:32:17.181 --> 01:32:21.021]  testing facilities that are really trying to help you,
[01:32:21.021 --> 01:32:22.540]  onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:24.141]  Because again, this isn't just online.
[01:32:24.141 --> 01:32:26.300]  This is creating a network of the future.
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:27.421]  It's true.
[01:32:27.421 --> 01:32:29.581]  Initially it has to start out online,
[01:32:29.581 --> 01:32:32.300]  but I may be able to in Dallas actually have
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:34.380]  the first kind of physical installation
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:36.781]  of the company and MBO.
[01:32:36.781 --> 01:32:38.941]  You're telling me you're feverishly working on that.
[01:32:38.941 --> 01:32:40.380]  We're working on this very hard.
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:43.581]  It needs to happen because Americans right now
[01:32:43.581 --> 01:32:44.620]  have lost their trust.
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:45.981]  I have so many patients that say,
[01:32:45.981 --> 01:32:49.901]  listen, my doctor has actually forced this vaccine on me
[01:32:49.901 --> 01:32:51.501]  and I'm not gonna take it.
[01:32:51.501 --> 01:32:54.300]  Other patients, Alex, have been discharged.
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:56.300]  They've been thrown out of their doctor's office
[01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:57.341]  because they won't take advantage.
[01:32:57.341 --> 01:32:59.581]  Oh, I know people in Austin that have children
[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:04.061]  and their pediatricians are firing their patient
[01:33:04.061 --> 01:33:06.221]  because they won't give their seven-year-old a shot.
[01:33:06.221 --> 01:33:07.901]  I mean, that is, can you speak to that?
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:11.101]  You know, I can tell you that is an abrogation
[01:33:11.101 --> 01:33:12.460]  of the Hippocratic Oath.
[01:33:13.181 --> 01:33:15.341]  It's an abrogation of the Declaration of Helsinki
[01:33:15.341 --> 01:33:17.821]  in terms of full informed consent.
[01:33:17.821 --> 01:33:22.061]  These COVID-19 vaccines are still fully experimental.
[01:33:22.061 --> 01:33:24.380]  No one can receive any pressure, coercion
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:25.821]  or threat of reprisal.
[01:33:25.821 --> 01:33:27.421]  According to the Nuremberg Code,
[01:33:27.421 --> 01:33:31.021]  these doctors have trampled all over the code of ethics.
[01:33:31.021 --> 01:33:32.141]  They've lost their minds.
[01:33:33.501 --> 01:33:34.701]  We were talking during the break
[01:33:34.701 --> 01:33:36.781]  when we were airing that Dell Big Tree piece
[01:33:36.781 --> 01:33:38.141]  about who runs and we know the devil
[01:33:38.141 --> 01:33:39.021]  scripts the mouthpiece,
[01:33:39.021 --> 01:33:41.661]  but why would the people that did this
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:43.261]  run something out like this?
[01:33:43.261 --> 01:33:44.941]  They had to know it was gonna cause these problems.
[01:33:44.941 --> 01:33:46.061]  They weren't stupid.
[01:33:46.141 --> 01:33:48.141]  I guess depopulation, it's so reckless.
[01:33:48.781 --> 01:33:51.501]  Destroy faith in the system, cause a societal collapse.
[01:33:51.501 --> 01:33:53.821]  We know they want a post-industrial world, it's in 2030.
[01:33:54.861 --> 01:33:57.501]  In our book, Courage to Face COVID-19,
[01:33:57.501 --> 01:34:00.620]  investigative true crime author John Leake
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:03.021]  spends some time on the World Economic Forum
[01:34:03.661 --> 01:34:05.421]  led by Klaus Schwab.
[01:34:06.061 --> 01:34:09.981]  And within a few months of the COVID-19 crisis emerging,
[01:34:09.981 --> 01:34:13.261]  he publishes a book, COVID-19 and the Great Reset.
[01:34:13.261 --> 01:34:15.821]  What John Leake says is, take it seriously.
[01:34:15.821 --> 01:34:18.460]  He wrote the book, take the book seriously.
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:21.901]  He says, this is a very narrow window of time
[01:34:23.101 --> 01:34:27.341]  that is available to achieve a new world order.
[01:34:27.341 --> 01:34:30.300]  He's been writing about the fourth industrial revolution.
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:33.581]  The fourth industrial revolution is not changing industry.
[01:34:33.581 --> 01:34:35.981]  It's about changing human beings
[01:34:35.981 --> 01:34:38.620]  and changing the nature of populations, Alex.
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:41.821]  This is a diabolical scheme and it's in the open.
[01:34:42.701 --> 01:34:45.901]  And that's why they have the SCGs and all this UN control
[01:34:45.901 --> 01:34:47.661]  once they get these digital currencies in,
[01:34:47.661 --> 01:34:49.421]  deciding where you can spend money.
[01:34:49.421 --> 01:34:50.861]  That's why it's a revolutionary act,
[01:34:50.861 --> 01:34:52.781]  not just to get independent medicine,
[01:34:52.781 --> 01:34:55.821]  independent prescriptions and real diagnoses.
[01:34:55.821 --> 01:34:57.581]  We have to build the new systems.
[01:34:57.581 --> 01:35:00.701]  That's why onlinehealthnow.com, the wellness company,
[01:35:00.701 --> 01:35:03.101]  is so critical is when we got some
[01:35:03.101 --> 01:35:05.581]  of the Clinton Foundation documents six, seven years ago
[01:35:05.581 --> 01:35:09.741]  when WorldNet Daily sued and got them,
[01:35:09.741 --> 01:35:11.341]  the Clintons when they first got elected
[01:35:11.341 --> 01:35:13.821]  were obsessed with shutting down populist,
[01:35:13.821 --> 01:35:16.221]  conservative and nationalist infrastructure.
[01:35:16.221 --> 01:35:17.741]  They didn't want an online newspaper.
[01:35:17.741 --> 01:35:19.101]  They didn't want filmmaking.
[01:35:19.101 --> 01:35:21.341]  They didn't want doctors that were conservative
[01:35:21.341 --> 01:35:23.741]  because then people are gonna gravitate towards that.
[01:35:23.741 --> 01:35:26.540]  This is how we build the new world is the new economy.
[01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:27.101]  It's true.
[01:35:27.101 --> 01:35:33.021]  It's a situation with the institutions are so corrupt.
[01:35:33.021 --> 01:35:34.701]  They've been so distorted.
[01:35:35.501 --> 01:35:40.141]  The thinking of the mind, Alex, is so far gone.
[01:35:40.141 --> 01:35:41.261]  Let me give an example.
[01:35:41.821 --> 01:35:44.701]  I was at a live program yesterday
[01:35:44.701 --> 01:35:46.460]  at the University of Texas in Dallas.
[01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:47.901]  I was about to say, I'm gonna stop right now
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:51.101]  and I'm gonna give you the floor for the next 20 minutes
[01:35:51.101 --> 01:35:52.701]  because you really get my brain firing.
[01:35:52.701 --> 01:35:54.380]  We've covered so many wild topics.
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:55.981]  We've hit at every different, so many different angles,
[01:35:55.981 --> 01:35:56.941]  but I'm gonna shut up now.
[01:35:56.941 --> 01:35:58.781]  You're gonna host a show for 20 minutes here
[01:35:58.781 --> 01:36:00.941]  and just start over with everything you haven't hit
[01:36:00.941 --> 01:36:02.620]  because they're trying to suppress what you're saying.
[01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:04.941]  They're more scared of you than anybody in medicine.
[01:36:04.941 --> 01:36:07.261]  So we need to hear Unfiltered, Dr. Peter McCullough right now.
[01:36:08.221 --> 01:36:10.380]  I wanted to get started out with an example
[01:36:10.941 --> 01:36:13.661]  of how the human mind is being distorted.
[01:36:13.661 --> 01:36:16.861]  We've covered COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, the virus,
[01:36:16.861 --> 01:36:18.861]  the COVID-19, the illness,
[01:36:18.861 --> 01:36:22.540]  and this distortion of human thought that has occurred.
[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:25.741]  And it's been described as mass formation
[01:36:25.741 --> 01:36:29.741]  or a fear-driven trance that people are in,
[01:36:29.741 --> 01:36:33.181]  but the human mind is changing rapidly.
[01:36:33.181 --> 01:36:35.181]  Thought patterns are contagious,
[01:36:35.181 --> 01:36:37.581]  spreading from one person to another,
[01:36:37.581 --> 01:36:40.300]  and it's not just regarding COVID-19.
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:41.341]  I'll give an example.
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:47.901]  There is a relative sudden confusion regarding gender,
[01:36:47.901 --> 01:36:48.941]  man or woman.
[01:36:49.581 --> 01:36:52.781]  And in 2021, the American Medical Association
[01:36:52.781 --> 01:36:57.341]  launched a campaign stating that doctors should no longer
[01:36:57.341 --> 01:36:59.821]  put the gender assignment on a birth certificate.
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:04.221]  So for the millennia of understanding gender,
[01:37:04.221 --> 01:37:08.380]  man versus woman, suddenly that was all out the window.
[01:37:08.941 --> 01:37:13.181]  The entire industry of knowing the gender before birth
[01:37:13.181 --> 01:37:17.981]  and having a nursery be pink or blue, out the window.
[01:37:17.981 --> 01:37:19.741]  This is in 2021.
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:24.380]  I was at a live program last night in Richardson, Texas,
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:26.141]  at the University of Texas at Dallas,
[01:37:26.701 --> 01:37:30.861]  with Senator Bob Hall.
[01:37:30.861 --> 01:37:34.141]  And we had many prominent doctors there.
[01:37:34.141 --> 01:37:36.460]  We were honoring him and we gave speeches.
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:39.741]  But right next door to us was an event.
[01:37:39.741 --> 01:37:43.581]  It was actually a retirement party in the Alumni Center there.
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:48.380]  But the person leading the event was a large man,
[01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:50.061]  clearly over six feet tall.
[01:37:50.861 --> 01:37:53.021]  But he was fully dressed as a woman.
[01:37:53.981 --> 01:37:59.101]  And there appeared to be with makeup and a dress
[01:37:59.101 --> 01:38:01.421]  and all the accompaniments there.
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:05.581]  And there were alumni there, conservatively dressed,
[01:38:05.581 --> 01:38:09.021]  nodding their heads and listening to what he had to say.
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:14.941]  And it was just a snapshot in my mind that I'm probably
[01:38:14.941 --> 01:38:19.501]  not going to forget, but of how universities have changed
[01:38:19.501 --> 01:38:22.620]  as an institution, how things have changed.
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:26.941]  There's been a clear promotion of gender ambiguity,
[01:38:26.941 --> 01:38:29.501]  gender change, transsexualism.
[01:38:29.501 --> 01:38:30.540]  There is a promotion.
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:31.981]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:38:31.981 --> 01:38:34.221]  Everyone's aware of the Vanderbilt University
[01:38:34.221 --> 01:38:37.341]  now Center for Gender Change Surgery.
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:41.981]  As a doctor, I can tell you that the vast majority
[01:38:41.981 --> 01:38:46.861]  of individuals are either XX, that they're women,
[01:38:46.861 --> 01:38:47.981]  or they're XY and they're men.
[01:38:47.981 --> 01:38:50.141]  There's a few hermaphrodites in between,
[01:38:50.861 --> 01:38:52.781]  but it's extremely rare.
[01:38:53.501 --> 01:38:56.540]  This large shift towards gender confusion
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:39:00.781]  or in fact not assigning gender and then having a child
[01:39:00.781 --> 01:39:03.101]  try to decide their gender before puberty
[01:39:03.101 --> 01:39:05.421]  and undergo surgery and hormonal manipulation.
[01:39:06.781 --> 01:39:10.540]  In my conservative interpretation as a doctor,
[01:39:12.221 --> 01:39:15.501]  that is distorting the human body,
[01:39:15.501 --> 01:39:19.181]  the God-given gift that we all have.
[01:39:19.181 --> 01:39:21.421]  There's a distortion of that through this
[01:39:22.861 --> 01:39:25.421]  relatively sudden gender confusion
[01:39:25.421 --> 01:39:27.981]  that's fallen down on human beings.
[01:39:28.701 --> 01:39:32.141]  So through a series of destabilizing events
[01:39:33.581 --> 01:39:36.861]  and what has occurred now with disrupted
[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:42.061]  presidential administrations, contested elections,
[01:39:43.261 --> 01:39:47.661]  this injection of gender confusion, COVID-19 pandemic,
[01:39:47.661 --> 01:39:50.781]  we're under an emergency from COVID-19 now
[01:39:50.781 --> 01:39:53.661]  yet people don't see any emergency around them.
[01:39:53.661 --> 01:39:56.941]  We're actually under an emergency for a monkeypox emergency.
[01:39:56.941 --> 01:39:59.901]  President Biden declared a national monkeypox emergency.
[01:39:59.901 --> 01:40:01.661]  The World Health Organization declared
[01:40:01.661 --> 01:40:03.581]  a national monkeypox emergency.
[01:40:04.221 --> 01:40:07.181]  When we look around ourselves, we don't see any emergency.
[01:40:07.181 --> 01:40:10.781]  There's no perception that there's a calamity
[01:40:10.781 --> 01:40:11.901]  occurring anywhere.
[01:40:13.981 --> 01:40:18.540]  What we see is a series of intentional events.
[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:20.620]  These are intentional events.
[01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:21.661]  They're global.
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:25.981]  They appear to be coordinated and in our book,
[01:40:25.981 --> 01:40:27.821]  Courage to Face COVID-19,
[01:40:29.661 --> 01:40:33.181]  the website is couragetofacecovid.com.
[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:37.821]  We outline there is a biopharmaceutical complex
[01:40:37.821 --> 01:40:41.581]  and at the top, we believe it's the World Health Organization,
[01:40:41.581 --> 01:40:44.781]  the World Economic Forum, the Gates Foundation,
[01:40:45.661 --> 01:40:48.781]  the Rockefeller Foundation, the Wellcome Trust,
[01:40:48.781 --> 01:40:51.341]  the entity they formed called CEPI,
[01:40:51.341 --> 01:40:54.540]  the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation.
[01:40:55.341 --> 01:40:58.941]  CEPI funded as a vaccine incubator
[01:40:59.581 --> 01:41:03.741]  that the only response to a pandemic would be mass vaccination
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:08.861]  and then a coordination with all the major health authorities,
[01:41:08.861 --> 01:41:12.141]  CDC, NIH, and FDA in the United States,
[01:41:12.141 --> 01:41:18.620]  the MHRA in the UK, TGA in Australia, EMA in Europe.
[01:41:19.581 --> 01:41:22.300]  With the major pharmaceutical industry,
[01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:24.941]  and I think Americans have gotten this confused.
[01:41:24.941 --> 01:41:28.141]  Americans have pointed out that big pharma is the villain,
[01:41:28.141 --> 01:41:31.741]  that really Pfizer or Moderna is the villain.
[01:41:31.741 --> 01:41:33.741]  Well, as we understand it in our book,
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:37.261]  Pfizer and Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca,
[01:41:37.261 --> 01:41:38.141]  outside the United States,
[01:41:38.141 --> 01:41:39.821]  now Novavax inside the United States,
[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:42.861]  they are suppliers and in a sense,
[01:41:42.861 --> 01:41:45.501]  they're almost figurehead suppliers.
[01:41:45.501 --> 01:41:47.821]  Under the EUA products, and I can tell you,
[01:41:47.981 --> 01:41:53.661]  this is for sure with anthrax through smallpox, monkeypox,
[01:41:53.661 --> 01:41:55.261]  and with SARS-CoV-2.
[01:41:55.261 --> 01:41:59.901]  For sure, these are military products, military products.
[01:41:59.901 --> 01:42:03.181]  And on my website now on America Out Loud talk,
[01:42:03.181 --> 01:42:04.701]  Radio McCullough Report,
[01:42:04.701 --> 01:42:08.701]  you can find the most recent podcast,
[01:42:08.701 --> 01:42:10.861]  it's going viral right now that I conducted
[01:42:10.861 --> 01:42:13.981]  with Alexandria Sasha Ledypova.
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:20.300]  And we outline here a clear fact pattern
[01:42:20.941 --> 01:42:23.101]  that the COVID-19 vaccines
[01:42:23.741 --> 01:42:26.941]  and the other related products are military products,
[01:42:26.941 --> 01:42:29.821]  that this is a military operation,
[01:42:29.821 --> 01:42:33.661]  that DARPA, the military research unit,
[01:42:33.661 --> 01:42:36.061]  and then BARDA, the NIH unit, they work in concert.
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:40.781]  They had a plan to use messenger RNA technology
[01:42:40.781 --> 01:42:42.380]  stated many years in advance
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:44.540]  that they were gonna use this technology.
[01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:46.141]  Here's the graphic right here.
[01:42:46.141 --> 01:42:49.021]  This is the ADEPT-P3 program.
[01:42:49.021 --> 01:42:53.341]  Look at this, 60 days to stop a pandemic.
[01:42:53.901 --> 01:42:55.981]  60 days to stop a pandemic.
[01:42:55.981 --> 01:42:57.821]  It even has an email.
[01:42:57.821 --> 01:43:00.300]  This was up in 2017.
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:02.380]  Look at the date, 2017.
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:04.540]  The program starts years before that.
[01:43:05.581 --> 01:43:09.181]  Another piece to the puzzle is the movement of billionaires.
[01:43:09.181 --> 01:43:12.300]  So people are very familiar with Bill Gates.
[01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:17.741]  And how through antitrust and the browser controversy
[01:43:17.741 --> 01:43:22.221]  that he quits being a software juggernaut
[01:43:22.221 --> 01:43:24.221]  and becomes a philanthropist.
[01:43:24.221 --> 01:43:27.021]  Well, all of his same tendencies
[01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:32.460]  in terms of antitrust, in terms of collusion,
[01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:34.620]  are transferred into the Gates Foundation,
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:36.861]  which becomes very predatory,
[01:43:36.861 --> 01:43:40.141]  pushing mass vaccination all over the world.
[01:43:40.141 --> 01:43:43.421]  Another billionaire is Stefan Beinzel,
[01:43:43.981 --> 01:43:47.021]  who was leading Bio Meru.
[01:43:47.021 --> 01:43:49.341]  And Bio Meru under Jacques Chirac
[01:43:49.341 --> 01:43:51.101]  commissions the construction
[01:43:51.741 --> 01:43:54.540]  of the Wuhan Institute of Virology
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:58.141]  biosecurity lab level four, the BSL level four.
[01:43:58.141 --> 01:44:03.101]  That's Stefan Beinzel, a billionaire working for Bio Meru.
[01:44:03.661 --> 01:44:05.901]  What happens in 2011
[01:44:05.901 --> 01:44:09.101]  after he finishes construction of the lab in Wuhan, China,
[01:44:09.101 --> 01:44:12.701]  2011, he leaves his giant company
[01:44:12.701 --> 01:44:14.540]  and joins a one-person company
[01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:16.941]  in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Moderna.
[01:44:17.501 --> 01:44:20.221]  And then he starts working with the NIH
[01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:24.460]  on crafting the patent for the Moderna vaccine.
[01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:28.460]  This starts in 2011 and the vaccine comes forward.
[01:44:29.021 --> 01:44:32.620]  What I'm telling you is the COVID-19 vaccines
[01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:36.221]  are product of incredible collaboration,
[01:44:36.221 --> 01:44:37.661]  collusion, if you will,
[01:44:37.661 --> 01:44:39.901]  between a syndicate that is formed.
[01:44:39.901 --> 01:44:42.221]  This occurred long before President Trump.
[01:44:42.861 --> 01:44:44.781]  These vaccines were not developed
[01:44:44.781 --> 01:44:46.221]  under Operation Warp Speed.
[01:44:46.221 --> 01:44:49.741]  Operation Warp Speed became a moniker
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:52.861]  for getting these quickly
[01:44:52.861 --> 01:44:55.821]  through any type of regulatory hurdles.
[01:44:55.821 --> 01:44:58.221]  But the concept of messenger RNA
[01:44:58.221 --> 01:45:00.781]  was born a long time ago.
[01:45:01.581 --> 01:45:03.101]  And we have a situation
[01:45:03.101 --> 01:45:04.941]  where the biopharmaceutical complex
[01:45:05.021 --> 01:45:06.620]  now is so powerful
[01:45:07.661 --> 01:45:09.661]  that nothing can stop it,
[01:45:09.661 --> 01:45:12.380]  that it has full cooperation
[01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:14.380]  from the intelligence community,
[01:45:14.380 --> 01:45:16.221]  has full cooperation
[01:45:16.221 --> 01:45:18.141]  through all the public health agencies.
[01:45:18.701 --> 01:45:21.421]  And as we peel back the onion here,
[01:45:22.221 --> 01:45:24.300]  and every time it's either
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:26.380]  through a court action and discovery
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:28.061]  or through the FOIA mechanism,
[01:45:28.061 --> 01:45:30.781]  the Freedom of Information Act mechanism,
[01:45:31.501 --> 01:45:33.181]  we get evidence of this.
[01:45:33.181 --> 01:45:34.061]  So, for instance,
[01:45:34.061 --> 01:45:36.221]  American First Legal through FOIA
[01:45:36.941 --> 01:45:39.261]  has the fact pattern and the evidence
[01:45:39.901 --> 01:45:42.141]  that the CDC and government agencies
[01:45:42.141 --> 01:45:44.061]  were regularly meeting with Twitter
[01:45:44.701 --> 01:45:46.141]  and with Facebook
[01:45:46.141 --> 01:45:48.941]  to craft the government false narrative.
[01:45:48.941 --> 01:45:50.540]  How were they crafting the narrative?
[01:45:51.181 --> 01:45:53.741]  They were suppressing certain users
[01:45:53.741 --> 01:45:55.501]  who were bringing information forward
[01:45:55.501 --> 01:45:58.141]  on the early treatment of COVID-19.
[01:45:59.421 --> 01:46:01.581]  They were deleting certain accounts
[01:46:01.581 --> 01:46:03.981]  or banning accounts to kind of tailor
[01:46:03.981 --> 01:46:07.101]  how the messaging would be heard globally
[01:46:07.101 --> 01:46:07.821]  on the platform.
[01:46:07.821 --> 01:46:09.341]  And then they were promoting
[01:46:09.341 --> 01:46:11.501]  pro-vaccine messaging
[01:46:11.501 --> 01:46:14.540]  throughout the social media network.
[01:46:15.101 --> 01:46:18.460]  A whole variety of units arose
[01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:20.061]  that were fact checking units
[01:46:20.061 --> 01:46:21.661]  that had funding that was trackable
[01:46:21.661 --> 01:46:23.901]  back to the biopharmaceutical complex.
[01:46:23.901 --> 01:46:26.620]  These fact checkers were mainly anonymous
[01:46:27.501 --> 01:46:29.661]  and they put out false counterclaims.
[01:46:29.661 --> 01:46:32.300]  So, if I made a particular statement
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:33.661]  and I cited the evidence,
[01:46:33.661 --> 01:46:36.061]  a fact checker would come out anonymous
[01:46:36.061 --> 01:46:37.981]  and say, Dr. McCullough is wrong.
[01:46:38.861 --> 01:46:39.901]  Well, based on what?
[01:46:39.901 --> 01:46:42.141]  There was no justification
[01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:46.540]  nor any authority for this fact checker
[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:49.021]  to put out a false counterclaim.
[01:46:49.901 --> 01:46:52.540]  These almost invariably trace back
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:55.821]  to the biopharmaceutical complex.
[01:46:56.701 --> 01:46:57.901]  And that's the reason why this show
[01:46:57.901 --> 01:47:00.460]  is so aptly named Infowars.
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:03.661]  It is a war of information out there.
[01:47:03.661 --> 01:47:05.501]  Then there's disruptive forces.
[01:47:05.501 --> 01:47:07.501]  So, I'll give you one disruptive force.
[01:47:07.501 --> 01:47:09.901]  He's right here in Austin, Texas, Joe Rogan.
[01:47:09.901 --> 01:47:12.701]  Joe Rogan starts to bring people on
[01:47:12.701 --> 01:47:14.300]  and with his large audience,
[01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:16.781]  far larger than mainstream TV,
[01:47:16.781 --> 01:47:18.061]  starts to initially brought on
[01:47:18.061 --> 01:47:19.821]  Brett Weinstein and Pierre Quarry
[01:47:19.821 --> 01:47:23.181]  talking about the virus and ivermectin
[01:47:23.181 --> 01:47:24.221]  because Joe had received it.
[01:47:24.221 --> 01:47:26.300]  Then he brings me on in December.
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:29.341]  I give a full outline of the virus,
[01:47:29.341 --> 01:47:31.821]  early treatment and the vaccines.
[01:47:31.821 --> 01:47:33.581]  Then he brings on Dr. Robert Malone
[01:47:33.581 --> 01:47:34.861]  and not a clinician,
[01:47:34.861 --> 01:47:37.181]  but someone who's been a vaccine consultant.
[01:47:37.181 --> 01:47:38.221]  Malone builds us out
[01:47:38.221 --> 01:47:40.061]  and the jaw dropping Rogan interview
[01:47:40.061 --> 01:47:42.540]  occurs in January of 2022
[01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:45.421]  when he brings on Majid Nawaz from the UK.
[01:47:46.141 --> 01:47:48.460]  And when he brings out Majid Nawaz,
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:50.781]  Rogan's jaw is dropped on the table
[01:47:50.781 --> 01:47:52.141]  because Majid says, yes,
[01:47:52.141 --> 01:47:54.300]  this is part of a bigger plan.
[01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:56.540]  This is about digital currency.
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:48:01.821]  It's about these global digital passports,
[01:48:01.821 --> 01:48:03.021]  social credit scores,
[01:48:03.581 --> 01:48:07.421]  a global method of human control
[01:48:08.701 --> 01:48:10.141]  that tracks all the way up
[01:48:10.141 --> 01:48:11.501]  to the World Economic Forum
[01:48:11.501 --> 01:48:13.501]  and what Klaus Schwab has put out
[01:48:13.501 --> 01:48:15.581]  as the fourth industrial revolution.
[01:48:16.141 --> 01:48:19.661]  It's clear this is all falling into place.
[01:48:19.661 --> 01:48:22.141]  It's a mind blowing reality.
[01:48:22.141 --> 01:48:24.300]  And when I went on with Steve Bannon recently,
[01:48:25.181 --> 01:48:26.781]  who is a terrific individual,
[01:48:26.781 --> 01:48:27.981]  I've got a chance to know him.
[01:48:27.981 --> 01:48:29.421]  I have tremendous respect for him
[01:48:29.421 --> 01:48:31.661]  and I'm not a hardcore right wing person at all.
[01:48:31.661 --> 01:48:32.861]  I'm very much a political moderate.
[01:48:32.861 --> 01:48:33.661]  I've told Steve that.
[01:48:34.221 --> 01:48:35.421]  But what Steve said is,
[01:48:35.421 --> 01:48:37.261]  thank God you guys wrote the book.
[01:48:37.261 --> 01:48:40.460]  Alex Jones has got a terrific new book reset
[01:48:41.101 --> 01:48:42.460]  that thank God you wrote the books
[01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:43.981]  because you can hang on to them.
[01:48:43.981 --> 01:48:45.341]  They have citations
[01:48:45.341 --> 01:48:46.861]  and they're not going to be corrupted.
[01:48:46.861 --> 01:48:49.021]  What Bannon says is you can already see it
[01:48:49.581 --> 01:48:52.221]  that the corruption of the electronics is happening.
[01:48:52.781 --> 01:48:55.181]  And the disruptive forces are people like myself,
[01:48:55.181 --> 01:48:56.540]  Alex Jones, I'll tell you, Joe Rogan.
[01:48:56.540 --> 01:48:58.460]  I'll tell you another one, Elon Musk.
[01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:01.661]  Elon Musk buying Twitter is disruptive
[01:49:01.661 --> 01:49:04.861]  because now this entire global censorship
[01:49:04.861 --> 01:49:06.221]  and false narrative plan
[01:49:06.221 --> 01:49:09.021]  has now gotten a ripple in the matrix.
[01:49:09.021 --> 01:49:11.181]  This is almost like a dark force
[01:49:11.181 --> 01:49:15.421]  where now there's a disruption that's occurred.
[01:49:15.981 --> 01:49:18.781]  Hero doctors all over the world have come forward
[01:49:18.781 --> 01:49:21.901]  and we've seen medical censorship for the first time.
[01:49:21.901 --> 01:49:24.460]  What you've heard today as a prominent doctor
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:27.181]  with a spotless clinical and research track record,
[01:49:28.141 --> 01:49:30.941]  I could be the first doctor in history
[01:49:30.941 --> 01:49:32.701]  stripped of my residency and fellowship
[01:49:32.701 --> 01:49:36.380]  and my credentials for purely political reasons
[01:49:37.021 --> 01:49:40.540]  by operatives that almost certainly are government operatives
[01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:42.941]  that are trying to advance a false narrative.
[01:49:43.661 --> 01:49:45.501]  But I don't see that as a sign of their strength.
[01:49:45.501 --> 01:49:46.620]  I see it as a sign of their weakness.
[01:49:47.501 --> 01:49:50.221]  It's entirely possible.
[01:49:50.221 --> 01:49:53.821]  What we're seeing is we're seeing signs of cracking.
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:55.901]  Cracking, I'll give you an example.
[01:49:55.901 --> 01:49:58.540]  Just having Ron DeSantis have a narrow win
[01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:01.021]  with Ron bringing in Joe Lodappo.
[01:50:01.021 --> 01:50:01.901]  Joe and I published-
[01:50:01.901 --> 01:50:03.181]  Oh, and he's devastating him.
[01:50:03.181 --> 01:50:03.821]  And he has been-
[01:50:03.821 --> 01:50:05.421]  He's the Secretary General of Florida.
[01:50:05.421 --> 01:50:05.901]  Of Florida.
[01:50:05.901 --> 01:50:07.101]  He's been absolutely devastating.
[01:50:07.101 --> 01:50:09.101]  I'll tell you another one, disruptive force.
[01:50:09.101 --> 01:50:11.421]  She spoke at CPAC just after me.
[01:50:11.421 --> 01:50:14.620]  Carrie Lake running for governor of Arizona.
[01:50:15.181 --> 01:50:17.901]  Trump and Steve Bannon were very gracious to Carrie.
[01:50:17.901 --> 01:50:18.221]  Carrie-
[01:50:18.221 --> 01:50:19.261]  Well, that's the good news.
[01:50:19.261 --> 01:50:20.781]  As negative as their attacks are,
[01:50:20.781 --> 01:50:22.781]  it's only triggered the world to wake up.
[01:50:22.781 --> 01:50:23.421]  Absolutely.
[01:50:23.421 --> 01:50:25.901]  We have governor races.
[01:50:25.901 --> 01:50:27.661]  I've mentioned Lake in Arizona,
[01:50:27.661 --> 01:50:31.101]  but also Scott Jensen, a physician in Minnesota,
[01:50:31.101 --> 01:50:32.941]  Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania.
[01:50:32.941 --> 01:50:34.861]  I've had a chance to meet all of them.
[01:50:35.501 --> 01:50:37.581]  Senator Ron Johnson's up for reelection.
[01:50:37.581 --> 01:50:39.181]  He's been our strongest U.S. Senator,
[01:50:39.181 --> 01:50:40.941]  by far national hero.
[01:50:40.941 --> 01:50:44.221]  And you know, there are 47 congressmen, Alex,
[01:50:44.221 --> 01:50:48.701]  that wrote a letter to Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Defense.
[01:50:48.701 --> 01:50:51.021]  These 47 congressmen are heroes.
[01:50:51.021 --> 01:50:52.540]  They told Lloyd Austin,
[01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:54.701]  drop the mandates, drop the vaccines.
[01:50:54.701 --> 01:50:55.421]  They're not safe.
[01:50:55.421 --> 01:50:56.460]  They're not effective.
[01:50:56.460 --> 01:50:58.380]  Call back our soldiers who are dismissed
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:50:59.261]  and give them back pay.
[01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:00.781]  Wow.
[01:51:00.781 --> 01:51:03.821]  Well, we've been going over an hour and a half here with you.
[01:51:03.821 --> 01:51:06.620]  And again, you go on Fox two, three minutes here and there,
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:08.141]  make great little points.
[01:51:08.141 --> 01:51:11.101]  People don't get to hear the full analysis you're engaged in.
[01:51:11.821 --> 01:51:16.941]  In closing, other key points you think viewers should be aware of.
[01:51:17.501 --> 01:51:20.380]  I think people at this point in time,
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:24.141]  and I said it in my new Substack Courageous discourse today,
[01:51:24.141 --> 01:51:25.021]  my issue at the end,
[01:51:25.021 --> 01:51:26.460]  I always give patients something to do,
[01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:27.821]  the public something to do.
[01:51:27.821 --> 01:51:29.581]  The next time you're approached with a vaccine,
[01:51:29.581 --> 01:51:31.101]  and I'm not anti-vaccine,
[01:51:31.101 --> 01:51:34.460]  I've taken every single vaccine up to the COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:35.741]  I didn't skip a one.
[01:51:35.741 --> 01:51:37.341]  My mom had me take them.
[01:51:37.341 --> 01:51:38.141]  My kids took them.
[01:51:38.141 --> 01:51:40.540]  I am not an anti-vaccine doctor.
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:41.901]  But let me tell you this,
[01:51:41.901 --> 01:51:43.341]  on Courageous discourse,
[01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:46.141]  at the bottom of that Substack,
[01:51:46.141 --> 01:51:47.101]  I tell you, listen,
[01:51:47.101 --> 01:51:48.620]  you're going to go into the doctor.
[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:50.380]  If you're going to take another vaccine,
[01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:53.341]  you better ask if messenger RNA is in it,
[01:51:53.341 --> 01:51:56.221]  because it's clear they've already signaled
[01:51:56.221 --> 01:51:59.021]  that they are going to try to have messenger RNA
[01:51:59.021 --> 01:52:00.941]  become a product line
[01:52:00.941 --> 01:52:02.221]  that's going to get into our body.
[01:52:02.221 --> 01:52:02.861]  Without approval.
[01:52:04.221 --> 01:52:08.221]  Without any type of proper oversight development or approval.
[01:52:08.221 --> 01:52:10.620]  And this is permanent.
[01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:13.341]  Everything we can tell, this is permanent.
[01:52:13.341 --> 01:52:15.261]  This permanently changes the human body.
[01:52:15.261 --> 01:52:15.661]  The message-
[01:52:15.661 --> 01:52:17.421]  This is a revolution over our bodies.
[01:52:17.421 --> 01:52:19.261]  A revolution over choice.
[01:52:19.261 --> 01:52:21.421]  It's just what Klaus Schwab talked about,
[01:52:21.421 --> 01:52:21.821]  changing-
[01:52:21.821 --> 01:52:23.181]  We must take over the bodies.
[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:27.021]  Yeah, he, you know, in our Substack,
[01:52:27.021 --> 01:52:28.781]  John Leake wrote a really fun piece,
[01:52:28.781 --> 01:52:30.941]  and I did one on Laura Ingraham too,
[01:52:30.941 --> 01:52:37.021]  that Klaus Schwab reminds us of Ernst Stavros Blofeld,
[01:52:37.661 --> 01:52:40.221]  the head of Spectre in the Bond movie.
[01:52:40.221 --> 01:52:43.421]  If you can get a picture of Blofeld,
[01:52:43.421 --> 01:52:44.941]  the head of Spectre in Bond,
[01:52:44.941 --> 01:52:47.341]  that's who Schwab reminds us of.
[01:52:47.341 --> 01:52:48.380]  And Schwab doesn't-
[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:49.821]  Well, they usually don't ever show Blofeld.
[01:52:49.821 --> 01:52:51.021]  They show the cat.
[01:52:51.021 --> 01:52:53.181]  Yeah, but you know, they show Blofeld.
[01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:55.501]  There he is.
[01:52:55.501 --> 01:52:57.101]  Schwab doesn't conceal it.
[01:52:58.141 --> 01:53:01.661]  There's some footage of him wearing almost like a Darth Vader,
[01:53:01.661 --> 01:53:04.141]  a black shield type-
[01:53:04.141 --> 01:53:05.341]  Sling on outfits.
[01:53:05.341 --> 01:53:08.380]  Yeah, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:10.620]  He's talking about changing the human body.
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:11.981]  He's had a love affair.
[01:53:11.981 --> 01:53:13.261]  He says it's a revolution.
[01:53:13.261 --> 01:53:14.941]  They're taking our bodies over.
[01:53:14.941 --> 01:53:18.380]  And so is his high priest, Noah Yuval Harari.
[01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:19.741]  Well, yeah, I tell you,
[01:53:19.741 --> 01:53:21.501]  most people can't watch Harari.
[01:53:21.501 --> 01:53:22.300]  And I can tell you,
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:26.701]  my Christian friends and relatives in close circles
[01:53:26.701 --> 01:53:29.901]  say they can't look at him because he is-
[01:53:29.901 --> 01:53:30.781]  A demon.
[01:53:30.781 --> 01:53:33.021]  Yeah, he is a representation of evil.
[01:53:33.021 --> 01:53:35.581]  They are definitely making a run in humanity right now.
[01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:38.620]  With the pedophilia and the open borders
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:40.380]  and the currency evaluation,
[01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:42.620]  we just have to mobilize and say no to it.
[01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:44.061]  But I'm gonna say this again.
[01:53:44.061 --> 01:53:45.981]  If you go to onlinehealthnow,
[01:53:45.981 --> 01:53:48.941]  that's one word, onlinehealthnow.com,
[01:53:49.821 --> 01:53:51.821]  there are so many great telephonic medicine
[01:53:51.821 --> 01:53:52.781]  and so many groups out there,
[01:53:52.781 --> 01:53:54.300]  but you're with heavy hitters.
[01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:55.981]  You are the platinum standard of this.
[01:53:55.981 --> 01:53:58.941]  And I'm so excited it's launched for people to call in,
[01:53:58.941 --> 01:54:01.901]  get real medical help, real prescriptions,
[01:54:01.901 --> 01:54:05.581]  real diagnoses, onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:54:05.581 --> 01:54:06.620]  Speak a little bit more about that.
[01:54:07.181 --> 01:54:10.061]  Well, I'm very proud to be the chief scientific officer
[01:54:10.061 --> 01:54:11.181]  for the wellness company.
[01:54:11.181 --> 01:54:13.101]  I took that board position
[01:54:13.101 --> 01:54:16.540]  led by e-commerce juggernaut from Canada, Foster Colson.
[01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:20.221]  Just had a exclusive interview on Tucker Carlson,
[01:54:20.221 --> 01:54:23.901]  very dynamic young man who's really making it happen.
[01:54:23.901 --> 01:54:26.221]  Open for business now and growing,
[01:54:26.221 --> 01:54:29.341]  taking on doctors, other healthcare providers on the platform.
[01:54:29.341 --> 01:54:30.300]  But very importantly,
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:33.581]  people sign up for a very low monthly fee
[01:54:33.581 --> 01:54:34.861]  and they get the access,
[01:54:34.861 --> 01:54:37.021]  they get the on demand that they want.
[01:54:37.021 --> 01:54:39.181]  We will never have another ivermectin
[01:54:39.181 --> 01:54:41.661]  or hydroxychloroquine prescription blocked ever.
[01:54:41.661 --> 01:54:43.261]  And again, credit goes to Trump.
[01:54:44.061 --> 01:54:45.821]  He greenlit all this medical stuff.
[01:54:45.821 --> 01:54:47.341]  Some was good, some was bad.
[01:54:47.341 --> 01:54:49.101]  The Regeneron was good.
[01:54:49.101 --> 01:54:51.181]  He promoted vitamin D, vitamin C,
[01:54:51.181 --> 01:54:53.421]  hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin.
[01:54:53.421 --> 01:54:54.221]  I mean, he was just saying,
[01:54:54.221 --> 01:54:55.821]  hey, I trust the doctors, do it.
[01:54:55.821 --> 01:54:59.101]  But trusting Doctors of America getting that law passed
[01:54:59.101 --> 01:55:01.021]  before you guys couldn't do this.
[01:55:01.021 --> 01:55:01.421]  It's true.
[01:55:01.421 --> 01:55:04.540]  So he enabled that the enablement of telemedicine
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:06.221]  and to give Trump credit,
[01:55:06.781 --> 01:55:09.261]  I think Trump has always had an eye for therapeutics.
[01:55:09.261 --> 01:55:14.141]  He was incredibly undermined by the White House Task Force,
[01:55:14.141 --> 01:55:18.141]  the head of the National Immunology Allergy Division,
[01:55:19.021 --> 01:55:20.701]  Dr. Anthony Fauci.
[01:55:20.701 --> 01:55:23.341]  There were so many in the deep state, Alex,
[01:55:23.341 --> 01:55:27.021]  who are responsible for this catastrophe that happened.
[01:55:27.021 --> 01:55:29.661]  I estimate now that, of course,
[01:55:29.661 --> 01:55:31.421]  there was a learning curve in how we did this,
[01:55:31.981 --> 01:55:36.061]  that two thirds of 10 million hospitalizations
[01:55:36.061 --> 01:55:38.300]  and two thirds of a million lives lost
[01:55:38.861 --> 01:55:40.380]  could have been spared
[01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:43.181]  if we would have had the doctors
[01:55:43.181 --> 01:55:45.821]  be able to step into action and save America.
[01:55:45.821 --> 01:55:47.501]  And now it's happening with online health,
[01:55:47.501 --> 01:55:48.701]  now the wellness company.
[01:55:50.380 --> 01:55:52.221]  You seem more empowered than ever.
[01:55:52.221 --> 01:55:53.581]  Their attacks haven't worked on you.
[01:55:53.581 --> 01:55:55.501]  Don't let attacks on Dr. Peter McCullough
[01:55:55.501 --> 01:55:58.141]  make you as a doctor or a scientist shut up.
[01:55:58.141 --> 01:55:59.101]  We're winning.
[01:55:59.101 --> 01:56:00.061]  We've been vindicated.
[01:56:00.061 --> 01:56:01.261]  And I don't see in closing
[01:56:01.981 --> 01:56:03.981]  how the power structure recovers from this.
[01:56:03.981 --> 01:56:06.540]  I know Trudeau in Canada is talking about new lockdowns.
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:07.821]  We don't take shots.
[01:56:07.821 --> 01:56:10.061]  I know they're talking about new lockdowns in Australia.
[01:56:10.061 --> 01:56:11.581]  I know that China is the model.
[01:56:11.581 --> 01:56:13.181]  They're still in their lockdowns.
[01:56:13.181 --> 01:56:14.701]  This is their new governance model,
[01:56:15.341 --> 01:56:17.021]  which is how they bring in the QR codes,
[01:56:17.021 --> 01:56:18.141]  universal basic income,
[01:56:19.181 --> 01:56:21.821]  the social credit score, the carbon tax.
[01:56:21.821 --> 01:56:23.181]  This is their big assault.
[01:56:23.181 --> 01:56:24.380]  This is the big issue.
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:27.341]  And COVID is just the shoehorn
[01:56:27.341 --> 01:56:32.380]  or the foot in the door to the beachhead.
[01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:33.501]  It appears to be the case.
[01:56:33.501 --> 01:56:35.981]  And the world is looking at America
[01:56:35.981 --> 01:56:38.781]  as really the battleground for this,
[01:56:38.781 --> 01:56:42.221]  the battleground between totalitarianism and freedom.
[01:56:42.221 --> 01:56:43.901]  And if there's one thing Americans
[01:56:43.901 --> 01:56:45.421]  can galvanize around is freedom,
[01:56:45.421 --> 01:56:46.701]  I think there's elections coming up.
[01:56:46.701 --> 01:56:49.981]  Alex and Tuesday are gonna be absolutely pivotal
[01:56:49.981 --> 01:56:51.261]  in terms of a shift.
[01:56:51.261 --> 01:56:53.341]  Every candidate ought to come out
[01:56:53.341 --> 01:56:55.821]  and tell Americans where they stand on health freedom,
[01:56:55.821 --> 01:56:57.261]  where they stand on freedom of choice,
[01:56:57.261 --> 01:57:00.061]  where they stand on these vaccines, lockdowns,
[01:57:00.061 --> 01:57:01.421]  masking, and other things.
[01:57:01.421 --> 01:57:03.021]  That's, I think, the issue on the table.
[01:57:03.021 --> 01:57:04.861]  I agree, but what you just said is so huge.
[01:57:04.861 --> 01:57:07.981]  We have the most draconian pushes for mandatory shots
[01:57:07.981 --> 01:57:09.741]  and targeting six-month-olds and up
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:12.620]  and trying to make school kids take them
[01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:15.581]  and just ridiculous mandates,
[01:57:15.581 --> 01:57:17.501]  but we have the biggest awakening against it as well.
[01:57:18.061 --> 01:57:18.941]  It is so true.
[01:57:18.941 --> 01:57:21.181]  And so many times, this is what it takes,
[01:57:21.341 --> 01:57:24.221]  a time of crisis where great people rise forward.
[01:57:24.221 --> 01:57:26.061]  I mentioned many of them.
[01:57:26.061 --> 01:57:28.061]  The reason why this is so important
[01:57:28.061 --> 01:57:30.540]  is because the rest of the world's looking at America.
[01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:34.460]  There are countries so far down the road on this,
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:37.741]  and Australia comes to mind, Canada, New Zealand.
[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:38.861]  Italy.
[01:57:39.501 --> 01:57:40.141]  Italy.
[01:57:40.141 --> 01:57:43.661]  This is extraordinary that we have an opportunity
[01:57:43.661 --> 01:57:47.261]  to turn the tables before things get worse.
[01:57:47.261 --> 01:57:49.341]  A lot of instability in Brazil right now
[01:57:49.341 --> 01:57:50.620]  with Bolsonaro.
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:51.581]  They definitely stole that.
[01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:53.101]  I mean, that's it.
[01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:57.021]  If they can't set the precedent now with this,
[01:57:57.021 --> 01:57:57.821]  they're going to lose.
[01:57:57.821 --> 01:57:58.861]  This is their full assault.
[01:57:59.501 --> 01:57:59.981]  It's true.
[01:57:59.981 --> 01:58:02.701]  And people ask, who are these people?
[01:58:02.701 --> 01:58:04.540]  What is in their mindset?
[01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:05.821]  And we mentioned what we think
[01:58:05.821 --> 01:58:08.540]  the biopharmaceutical complex, people at the top,
[01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:11.981]  but how could the human mind become so distorted?
[01:58:11.981 --> 01:58:14.141]  Not everybody's getting kickbacks on this.
[01:58:14.141 --> 01:58:17.261]  Not everybody's getting their pockets filled,
[01:58:17.261 --> 01:58:20.300]  but the human mind is not thinking correctly.
[01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:21.661]  It's mob psychology.
[01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:23.181]  Yeah, and it's basically,
[01:58:23.181 --> 01:58:26.221]  I think there is some truth to mass formation.
[01:58:26.221 --> 01:58:30.061]  There's a lot of discussion, is it a psy-op?
[01:58:30.061 --> 01:58:31.741]  And I think the answer is yes, it is a psy-op.
[01:58:31.741 --> 01:58:33.421]  I have a stack of articles I didn't even get to
[01:58:33.421 --> 01:58:36.221]  where military groups admit they engage in psy-ops.
[01:58:36.221 --> 01:58:39.501]  It is a psy-op, a psychological operation on the people,
[01:58:39.501 --> 01:58:42.300]  but the psychopathology that's happening
[01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:44.941]  from person to person is mass formation.
[01:58:45.821 --> 01:58:47.421]  It's a mix of all of them, absolutely.
[01:58:48.141 --> 01:58:52.300]  So again, onlinehealthnow.com, onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:53.421]  Check it out, folks.
[01:58:53.421 --> 01:58:55.901]  And move away from the power structure, the corrupt system.
[01:58:55.901 --> 01:58:58.141]  Go with Dr. Peter McCullough, who we should champion
[01:58:58.141 --> 01:59:01.261]  and support and lift up as the example,
[01:59:01.261 --> 01:59:04.061]  like the Elon Musk of medicine to build our new system,
[01:59:04.061 --> 01:59:06.380]  our new world, our new Atlantis.
[01:59:06.941 --> 01:59:08.061]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:59:08.701 --> 01:59:09.101]  Thank you.
[01:59:09.101 --> 01:59:10.861]  Incredible that you came to town.
[01:59:10.861 --> 01:59:12.141]  We really appreciate you.
[01:59:12.141 --> 01:59:13.661]  And God bless you, Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:59:13.661 --> 01:59:14.161]  Thank you.
[01:59:14.941 --> 01:59:15.261]  All right, folks.
[01:59:15.261 --> 01:59:17.021]  I'm going to come back with some final news stories
[01:59:17.021 --> 01:59:18.061]  and close this out.
[01:59:18.061 --> 01:59:20.540]  And an excerpt of that bombshell interview
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:23.341]  from now 12 years ago of Alan Watt,
[01:59:23.341 --> 01:59:25.021]  where he predicted the whole Great Reset
[01:59:25.021 --> 01:59:25.661]  and the New World Order.
[01:59:25.661 --> 01:59:28.620]  He died a few years ago, but there's a multi-hour interview
[01:59:28.620 --> 01:59:29.741]  we did with him years ago.
[01:59:29.741 --> 01:59:31.421]  It's now resurfaced, going viral.
[01:59:31.421 --> 01:59:34.300]  It's also posted at infowars.com for free.
[01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:35.821]  We're going to air an excerpt of it coming back.
[01:59:35.821 --> 01:59:36.300]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:36.861]  Stay with us.
[01:59:39.261 --> 01:59:41.501]  I'm pointing my finger at you.
[01:59:42.061 --> 01:59:44.221]  And I'm also pointing right back at myself.
[01:59:44.221 --> 01:59:46.221]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[01:59:46.221 --> 01:59:48.221]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[01:59:48.221 --> 01:59:49.981]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[01:59:49.981 --> 01:59:52.380]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:53.821]  You forget to take DX3.
[01:59:53.821 --> 01:59:55.261]  And you know it makes your life better.
[01:59:55.261 --> 01:59:56.781]  And you know it makes you healthier.
[01:59:56.781 --> 01:59:58.061]  And you constantly forget.
[01:59:58.061 --> 02:00:00.540]  And when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[02:00:00.540 --> 02:00:02.141]  This stuff will blow you away.
[02:00:02.141 --> 02:00:03.661]  Plus, it funds our operation.
[02:00:03.661 --> 02:00:05.661]  We have the biggest settle of the year going right now

[02:00:37.581 --> 02:00:40.460]  This is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:42.620]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers
[02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:44.620]  and sisters in the occupied zone.
[02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:46.300]  The chair is against the wall.
[02:00:46.861 --> 02:00:48.540]  John has a long mustache.
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:51.821]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:00:51.821 --> 02:00:53.181]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans.
[02:00:53.181 --> 02:00:54.861]  Another day closer to victory.
[02:00:54.861 --> 02:00:57.661]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines,
[02:00:57.661 --> 02:00:58.941]  this is your song.
[02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:17.901]  What a transmission this evening.
[02:01:17.901 --> 02:01:19.741]  I just hope everybody shares the live link.
[02:01:19.741 --> 02:01:20.861]  And I hope you share the archive
[02:01:20.861 --> 02:01:23.581]  that will be posted soon at band.vedia.
[02:01:24.701 --> 02:01:25.741]  Dr. Peter McCullough.
[02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:29.501]  All the information we've covered is simply amazing.
[02:01:30.221 --> 02:01:31.981]  But I wanted to go back to a guy
[02:01:31.981 --> 02:01:35.341]  that was just so well-researched and so amazing.
[02:01:35.341 --> 02:01:36.620]  Who's gone on to be with the Lord.
[02:01:37.181 --> 02:01:39.101]  That's Alan Watt here in just a moment.
[02:01:39.101 --> 02:01:42.781]  And then we're gonna restream this until 4 p.m. tomorrow.
[02:01:42.781 --> 02:01:44.540]  I do the live Sunday show.
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:46.380]  But I hope you'll join us for it.
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:48.620]  I hope that you will share.
[02:01:49.501 --> 02:01:51.901]  But separately, I knew that Dr. Peter McCullough
[02:01:51.901 --> 02:01:53.261]  was doing this a few months ago.
[02:01:54.701 --> 02:01:57.421]  So I've been approached by a lot of telephonic medicine groups.
[02:01:57.981 --> 02:01:59.661]  And I was waiting till they actually launched it.
[02:02:00.221 --> 02:02:02.380]  He didn't want to talk about it today when he was on.
[02:02:02.380 --> 02:02:03.581]  But this is revolution.
[02:02:03.581 --> 02:02:05.981]  Funding independent healthcare, funding patriots,
[02:02:05.981 --> 02:02:08.380]  funding groups that'll actually give you therapeutic care
[02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:09.581]  during an emergency.
[02:02:09.581 --> 02:02:14.380]  Go to one group that will actually give you the care you need.
[02:02:14.380 --> 02:02:16.781]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[02:02:16.781 --> 02:02:18.460]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:21.341]  Become a subscriber and get all the free information
[02:02:21.341 --> 02:02:23.421]  after your subscriber that's just posted constantly.
[02:02:23.421 --> 02:02:29.421]  And then all the products and medical advice you need to get.
[02:02:29.421 --> 02:02:31.261]  Just everything right there in one spot.
[02:02:32.061 --> 02:02:34.061]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[02:02:35.261 --> 02:02:36.141]  All right.
[02:02:36.141 --> 02:02:37.501]  I'm gonna end this transmission.
[02:02:37.501 --> 02:02:38.620]  A lot of news I didn't get to.
[02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:41.901]  A lot I will get to tomorrow night, 4 p.m. Central.
[02:02:41.901 --> 02:02:43.981]  I want to thank the crew for the great job they've done.
[02:02:43.981 --> 02:02:47.181]  Here's an excerpt of the two-plus-hour breakdown
[02:02:47.181 --> 02:02:48.781]  that's on Banned Out Video right now
[02:02:48.781 --> 02:02:51.021]  with the great, late Alan Watts.
[02:02:54.221 --> 02:02:55.581]  I'm Alan Watts.
[02:02:55.581 --> 02:03:00.460]  And I'm an author and researcher into geopolitics, really, and history.
[02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:02.380]  I follow where the world has been.
[02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:05.261]  The techniques were used to bring them to those stages.
[02:03:05.261 --> 02:03:07.261]  And I apply them to where we are today.
[02:03:07.821 --> 02:03:09.581]  And how the future is planned.
[02:03:10.221 --> 02:03:12.861]  I've researched so many books.
[02:03:12.861 --> 02:03:13.981]  I've got a library of my own.
[02:03:14.861 --> 02:03:17.581]  I like paperback books, or at least hardback books,
[02:03:17.581 --> 02:03:20.941]  because they're permanent records of the past.
[02:03:20.941 --> 02:03:22.380]  If you can't understand the past,
[02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:24.061]  you understand the present or the future.
[02:03:24.861 --> 02:03:28.540]  I've also been in the music business, heavily involved for years.
[02:03:29.501 --> 02:03:34.540]  And I saw how culture creation worked from the top.
[02:03:35.261 --> 02:03:40.460]  And how generations were swayed into new fashions, new ideas.
[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:43.101]  I've been following the histories of what's now called
[02:03:43.101 --> 02:03:45.581]  the New World Order for many, many years.
[02:03:47.181 --> 02:03:51.741]  And I try to go into the books written by the big players,
[02:03:51.741 --> 02:03:55.821]  the technocrats themselves, those famous people,
[02:03:55.821 --> 02:03:58.861]  like the Kissingers, the Brzezinski and so on,
[02:03:58.861 --> 02:04:01.581]  the Huxleys, the Lord Bertrand Russells,
[02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:04.861]  who all worked for the same organizations.
[02:04:06.221 --> 02:04:07.581]  And I came to the conclusion, really,
[02:04:07.581 --> 02:04:11.341]  there was only one big organization with many subcategories.
[02:04:13.341 --> 02:04:17.661]  These boys tend to publish the world that they saw coming into view.
[02:04:19.421 --> 02:04:21.261]  And they wrote it in their own hand, basically.
[02:04:21.261 --> 02:04:23.021]  They told us where they were taking the world.
[02:04:24.221 --> 02:04:27.501]  And when you start studying these things about the age of 14, 15,
[02:04:27.501 --> 02:04:29.821]  or even younger, and reading their books,
[02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:31.661]  and you live long enough,
[02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:36.300]  you will see that the world has turned out exactly as they planned.
[02:04:37.421 --> 02:04:38.781]  This can't be coincidence.
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:44.701]  And who can really write up a wish list and make it happen globally?
[02:04:45.501 --> 02:04:49.021]  Unless there is an organization very, very powerful,
[02:04:49.021 --> 02:04:52.380]  probably the only organization really on the planet.
[02:04:53.101 --> 02:04:57.261]  An organization that can fund all sides, all oppositions,
[02:04:58.141 --> 02:05:01.421]  and using the synthesis of conflicting parties,
[02:05:02.221 --> 02:05:06.061]  they can literally make the world come into view as they planned.
[02:05:07.101 --> 02:05:08.540]  The plan in centuries,
[02:05:09.421 --> 02:05:13.741]  and the astonishing thing is when you go into the United Nations,
[02:05:13.741 --> 02:05:15.981]  which was loosely based on the Soviet system,
[02:05:17.181 --> 02:05:20.861]  they plan certain parts of their agenda in 50-year plans,
[02:05:21.501 --> 02:05:23.021]  some in 100-year plans,
[02:05:23.741 --> 02:05:27.821]  and some even in 150-year plans for different aspects of it.
[02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:30.300]  The Russells, the Huxleys, and so on,
[02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:35.341]  Brzezinski's also use the same terminology with their long-term plans.
[02:05:35.341 --> 02:05:36.941]  And you've got to understand, too,
[02:05:36.941 --> 02:05:40.460]  that nothing in culture comes out from the grassroots.
[02:05:41.341 --> 02:05:44.221]  Even Plato talked about that thousands of years ago.
[02:05:45.261 --> 02:05:50.221]  He said that if it's a grassroots movement really coming from the people,
[02:05:50.781 --> 02:05:54.061]  then those in charge, the dominant minority, would lose control.
[02:05:54.861 --> 02:05:58.941]  Therefore, every change in culture, right down to fashion and music,
[02:05:59.501 --> 02:06:01.741]  and this was written 2,300 years ago,
[02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:05.741]  had to be authorized from the top and promoted from the top
[02:06:05.741 --> 02:06:10.061]  if it fitted with the continuance of control over the public.
[02:06:10.781 --> 02:06:14.141]  And these are sciences which were taught down through the ages,
[02:06:14.141 --> 02:06:16.941]  are still taught today to the big players,
[02:06:17.741 --> 02:06:20.861]  and they've used it to the full in the 20th century,
[02:06:20.861 --> 02:06:23.901]  now into the 21st century with the use of television,
[02:06:23.901 --> 02:06:26.141]  mass communications, radio, etc.
[02:06:26.141 --> 02:06:27.981]  Everything has been given to us
[02:06:28.701 --> 02:06:31.981]  for the appropriate time and stage in the actual planning.
[02:06:32.941 --> 02:06:36.941]  And for those who are coming into this kind of study,
[02:06:37.901 --> 02:06:42.061]  it's best to go into the books, as I say, written by the big players themselves.
[02:06:42.061 --> 02:06:42.941]  They love to boast.
[02:06:43.901 --> 02:06:46.540]  Kissinger's got lots of books out there, so has Brzezinski.
[02:06:47.341 --> 02:06:51.181]  These are probably two of the master players in geopolitics.
[02:06:51.181 --> 02:06:53.501]  Try to stay away from all the conspiracy books.
[02:06:54.701 --> 02:06:57.981]  They're also put out there on purpose, very fascinating books.
[02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:02.540]  But the Legion circles forever without giving you the overall picture
[02:07:03.421 --> 02:07:09.181]  to the fact that every generation has a purpose up until this present time.
[02:07:09.981 --> 02:07:13.341]  And in a post-industrial era, these big boys have decided,
[02:07:13.341 --> 02:07:17.101]  and their masters too, that we are simply superfluous,
[02:07:18.221 --> 02:07:19.341]  and they no longer need us.
[02:07:19.981 --> 02:07:23.501]  Hence, we have big foundations coming forward
[02:07:24.061 --> 02:07:26.701]  and organizations like the Optimum Population Trust
[02:07:27.901 --> 02:07:30.781]  who have decided to come out openly
[02:07:30.781 --> 02:07:34.861]  and demand that governments start radically reducing the populations.
[02:07:34.861 --> 02:07:39.901]  We are now the useless eaters, as Lord Bertrand Russell called us.
[02:07:39.901 --> 02:07:44.300]  Our ideas, our opinions on everything, our world view,
[02:07:44.941 --> 02:07:49.501]  even to do with population and the fake view that we're overpopulated
[02:07:49.501 --> 02:07:53.181]  is all projected to us by the mainstream media
[02:07:53.181 --> 02:07:55.501]  working in concert for their masters.
[02:07:56.141 --> 02:07:59.021]  And we begin to parrot what we hear through repetition.
[02:07:59.661 --> 02:08:00.701]  And that's so important.
[02:08:00.701 --> 02:08:05.501]  It's repetition with slogans and catchphrases.
[02:08:05.501 --> 02:08:08.540]  And once you hear it happening in your own local group here in Melieu,
[02:08:09.101 --> 02:08:11.261]  then you know it's working.
[02:08:11.261 --> 02:08:14.620]  And the camera can make anything appear to be true.
[02:08:15.181 --> 02:08:16.701]  You'll see that in India, for instance,
[02:08:17.421 --> 02:08:20.861]  they always use the same streets of Bombay
[02:08:20.861 --> 02:08:23.341]  to make you think that you're massively overcrowded.
[02:08:23.341 --> 02:08:27.101]  And that's the impression people think of the entire Indian continent.
[02:08:27.101 --> 02:08:29.101]  The Indian continent is huge,
[02:08:29.101 --> 02:08:33.501]  with thousands and thousands of miles of forest where no one lives.
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:35.981]  And it's the same in Africa too.
[02:08:36.941 --> 02:08:40.141]  China, being the model state for the world, for instance,
[02:08:41.101 --> 02:08:45.661]  put into effect the United Nations policy to the extreme
[02:08:45.661 --> 02:08:47.421]  with this population reduction
[02:08:47.421 --> 02:08:51.021]  and the movements of people off of the rural areas into cities.
[02:08:51.021 --> 02:08:52.300]  They said that years ago.
[02:08:53.261 --> 02:08:56.781]  Right now they're in the process of moving 200 million more people off
[02:08:57.341 --> 02:09:00.141]  into the major cities, and that's the major newspapers.
[02:09:00.141 --> 02:09:01.901]  The cities appear to be crowded
[02:09:03.101 --> 02:09:05.101]  because everyone's being moved into them.
[02:09:05.741 --> 02:09:08.701]  In the Western world since the 1950s,
[02:09:08.701 --> 02:09:14.701]  again under the term of urban sprawl and stopping urban sprawl,
[02:09:14.701 --> 02:09:17.581]  the Western countries also signed agreements
[02:09:17.581 --> 02:09:22.380]  to do no more building in the outskirts of the major cities.
[02:09:23.181 --> 02:09:26.540]  All existing buildings have to be used
[02:09:26.540 --> 02:09:29.581]  or else not done, replaced with even higher ones.
[02:09:29.581 --> 02:09:31.341]  But regardless, with the immigration
[02:09:31.901 --> 02:09:34.781]  and the free flow of people now from third world countries,
[02:09:35.181 --> 02:09:38.781]  the Western countries appear to be overcrowded.
[02:09:38.781 --> 02:09:41.261]  And yet the UN's own statistics show
[02:09:42.061 --> 02:09:43.581]  and sort of the national census show
[02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:46.380]  that the Europeans, for instance,
[02:09:46.380 --> 02:09:48.861]  Canadians and Americans who have been here
[02:09:48.861 --> 02:09:51.661]  for a couple of hundred years are actually in decline.
[02:09:52.620 --> 02:09:57.581]  So the overpopulation problem is simply an image projected by the media
[02:09:58.221 --> 02:10:01.261]  as more and more people are crammed into the same cities
[02:10:01.261 --> 02:10:03.421]  and they bring more immigrants in to fill them.
[02:10:03.421 --> 02:10:05.661]  But I also realized the system of schooling
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:09.181]  when I was going to school was bogus.
[02:10:09.181 --> 02:10:10.460]  The histories were bogus.
[02:10:11.261 --> 02:10:16.460]  And I was very, very lucky to have access to very old libraries,
[02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:18.380]  very old libraries, town libraries.
[02:10:19.741 --> 02:10:23.181]  Some of them had reference books going back into the 1700s
[02:10:23.821 --> 02:10:24.620]  written at the time.
[02:10:25.181 --> 02:10:27.581]  When you compared the histories I was being taught in school
[02:10:28.941 --> 02:10:30.701]  to the histories that were written at the time,
[02:10:30.701 --> 02:10:31.821]  they were completely different.
[02:10:32.781 --> 02:10:37.981]  You had a deeper understanding of how geopolitics had been used in the past
[02:10:39.181 --> 02:10:41.101]  to even populate the country of Canada.
[02:10:42.941 --> 02:10:45.821]  London couldn't get immigrants to go off into the new colonies.
[02:10:47.021 --> 02:10:50.540]  What they did for Australia was to create so many laws
[02:10:51.341 --> 02:10:54.061]  that you couldn't help but break them and poverty
[02:10:54.061 --> 02:10:56.781]  and therefore stealing a loaf of bread to feed you or your family
[02:10:56.781 --> 02:10:59.261]  would get you deported to Australia with your family.
[02:11:00.221 --> 02:11:02.380]  That's how they populated Australia, crime.
[02:11:03.261 --> 02:11:05.021]  They created the laws for crime.
[02:11:05.021 --> 02:11:06.941]  With Scotland, they had a rebellion
[02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:10.460]  which could have been rigged and often think it was
[02:11:11.021 --> 02:11:12.620]  and the whole of Scotland was punished
[02:11:13.741 --> 02:11:16.861]  and they deported millions of the Scots off to the Americas
[02:11:17.421 --> 02:11:18.620]  to populate the Americas.
[02:11:19.261 --> 02:11:21.261]  This is geopolitics in action.
[02:11:21.261 --> 02:11:22.380]  That's how it works.
[02:11:23.181 --> 02:11:25.981]  And whole peoples are often moved from their land
[02:11:26.861 --> 02:11:30.540]  because the elite masters want them elsewhere
[02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:33.821]  to be productive for them themselves, the masters.
[02:11:35.661 --> 02:11:37.981]  When you look at the strategy for the US and Canada,
[02:11:38.781 --> 02:11:41.341]  again, long-term strategy, long-term planning,
[02:11:43.101 --> 02:11:47.261]  you'll find that the big corporations of their day,
[02:11:47.261 --> 02:11:50.061]  the Hudson's Bay companies, the Fraser companies
[02:11:50.620 --> 02:11:53.421]  were given charters to own the land
[02:11:53.421 --> 02:11:57.501]  before Canada was Canada or US was the US.
[02:11:57.501 --> 02:11:58.941]  They were simply called the Americas.
[02:11:59.981 --> 02:12:02.300]  These are private international corporations
[02:12:03.261 --> 02:12:05.501]  that the power of life and death
[02:12:05.501 --> 02:12:07.501]  over everyone who lived within their areas.
[02:12:09.181 --> 02:12:11.821]  The queen or the king had a consulate in every country,
[02:12:12.861 --> 02:12:15.581]  lieutenant general or a governor general, they call them.
[02:12:15.581 --> 02:12:19.101]  We still have one in Canada today who represents the queen.
[02:12:19.101 --> 02:12:22.061]  They have all the powers over life and death of subjects
[02:12:22.781 --> 02:12:24.620]  under that governor.
[02:12:27.021 --> 02:12:28.861]  How they stopped rebellion in the past
[02:12:28.861 --> 02:12:31.501]  was to give us an idea of what they called democracy.
[02:12:32.380 --> 02:12:35.261]  They knew from the Chartist movement in Britain,
[02:12:35.261 --> 02:12:37.501]  for instance, and elsewhere, other countries,
[02:12:37.501 --> 02:12:39.421]  people were demanding rights for the first time.
[02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:42.620]  And so once again, they gave us champions
[02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:43.661]  to speak on our behalf,
[02:12:44.781 --> 02:12:46.061]  which calmed the people down,
[02:12:46.061 --> 02:12:47.901]  thinking for the first time in history,
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:51.181]  the people were involved in their own destiny creation.
[02:12:52.061 --> 02:12:53.661]  And nothing was further from the truth
[02:12:54.540 --> 02:12:55.661]  because the planners knew
[02:12:56.380 --> 02:12:58.861]  that once you bring people into a country or a continent,
[02:12:59.421 --> 02:13:02.061]  create real wealth for them and get businesses going,
[02:13:02.781 --> 02:13:06.380]  clear the land, drain the swamps and so on,
[02:13:06.380 --> 02:13:08.300]  they can take it all away from you through laws
[02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:09.661]  200 years down the road.
[02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:11.661]  And that's what's happening now.
[02:13:13.341 --> 02:13:15.341]  Long-term geopolitics once more.
[02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:17.901]  And if you think I'm kidding about this,
[02:13:17.901 --> 02:13:20.300]  go into the history books written at the time,
[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:22.141]  they're still there in some of the libraries.
[02:13:22.141 --> 02:13:24.781]  And you can also go into the art of geopolitics.
[02:13:25.501 --> 02:13:27.821]  There's even videos on YouTube on Brzezinski
[02:13:28.781 --> 02:13:33.101]  boasting about how he set up the Taliban in Afghanistan.
[02:13:33.981 --> 02:13:35.581]  You'll see him encourage them
[02:13:35.581 --> 02:13:38.221]  to fight the Soviets at that time in the 1970s.
[02:13:39.261 --> 02:13:41.341]  And he actually says yours is a holy war.
[02:13:43.501 --> 02:13:46.061]  This man who obviously believes in nothing but himself
[02:13:46.061 --> 02:13:47.421]  and his own peer group
[02:13:47.421 --> 02:13:51.661]  is encouraging other people to go and fight a holy war, a jihad.
[02:13:51.661 --> 02:13:54.701]  And he uses these terms against the Soviets.
[02:13:54.701 --> 02:13:56.620]  Knowing full well once it was set up
[02:13:56.620 --> 02:13:58.141]  and was backed by the CIA,
[02:13:58.861 --> 02:14:01.421]  that 10, 15 years down the road,
[02:14:01.421 --> 02:14:02.300]  they'd be a problem.
[02:14:03.101 --> 02:14:04.460]  And then they'd have to go to war
[02:14:04.460 --> 02:14:07.901]  with the very group they'd created to fight the Soviets.
[02:14:07.901 --> 02:14:09.181]  That's what's happening today.
[02:14:09.901 --> 02:14:11.341]  Long-term strategies.
[02:14:11.341 --> 02:14:13.821]  Well, that's how history has always been run.
[02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:15.661]  If you can go into the books
[02:14:15.661 --> 02:14:19.661]  where you find the British Home Office, as mentioned,
[02:14:19.661 --> 02:14:22.141]  study the history of the diplomatic corps
[02:14:23.181 --> 02:14:26.861]  because the diplomats were spies.
[02:14:26.861 --> 02:14:29.181]  They would go into territories, set up embassies,
[02:14:29.181 --> 02:14:32.141]  collect intelligence data for future invasions.
[02:14:32.141 --> 02:14:35.501]  Their job was also to try and grab the rights of minerals,
[02:14:35.501 --> 02:14:37.741]  gold, silver, et cetera, across the planet.
[02:14:38.861 --> 02:14:40.061]  All natural resources.
[02:14:40.861 --> 02:14:42.861]  And find ways long-term strategy
[02:14:43.021 --> 02:14:46.221]  to either bribe it off the present rulers of those countries
[02:14:47.021 --> 02:14:50.380]  or else create an ultimate war with them
[02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:53.421]  and simply steal it under the guise of occupation.
[02:14:55.421 --> 02:14:57.661]  We're living through a stage today, as I say,
[02:14:57.661 --> 02:14:59.661]  where this is all coming to a culmination.
[02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:02.221]  This is the post-industrial era.
[02:15:02.221 --> 02:15:07.181]  We're post-technical, almost, in the West.
[02:15:07.181 --> 02:15:09.421]  It's all done in other countries, all the technical stuff.
[02:15:09.421 --> 02:15:13.021]  And Brzezinski himself talks about the technocratic era
[02:15:14.620 --> 02:15:17.581]  where the future will be for an elite
[02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:20.620]  with a highly trained bureaucracy underneath them
[02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:23.901]  and scientific elite who will not need the human labour
[02:15:23.901 --> 02:15:25.181]  that they've needed in the past.
[02:15:26.701 --> 02:15:30.300]  Human labour that is excessive and is unemployed
[02:15:30.300 --> 02:15:33.821]  and is hungry is now a threat to that established elite.
[02:15:34.861 --> 02:15:36.540]  So now they're doing something
[02:15:36.701 --> 02:15:39.261]  which they can only do to the human species.
[02:15:39.261 --> 02:15:40.861]  They don't need to do this with animals.
[02:15:41.901 --> 02:15:43.821]  With animals, they just go out and hunt them and kill them.
[02:15:45.021 --> 02:15:47.421]  We are the only species that has to be convinced
[02:15:48.701 --> 02:15:53.341]  to allow ourselves for the good of all to be sterilised
[02:15:53.341 --> 02:15:56.540]  and bring down the population through abortion on one end
[02:15:56.540 --> 02:16:00.620]  and euthanasia on the other under the guise to save the planet.
[02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:03.661]  And unfortunately, with the massive propaganda campaigns
[02:16:03.981 --> 02:16:07.981]  that are all over media and every country at the same time,
[02:16:07.981 --> 02:16:11.981]  with all the big foundations backing them with unlimited financing...
[02:16:11.981 --> 02:16:14.701]  Remember, the two, the foundations, are owned
[02:16:15.501 --> 02:16:17.981]  by the international bankers themselves.
[02:16:19.981 --> 02:16:21.741]  Then they can pull all of this off
[02:16:21.741 --> 02:16:23.421]  and unfortunately, it really is working.
[02:16:24.701 --> 02:16:27.421]  In kindergarten now, you walk into a kindergarten
[02:16:27.421 --> 02:16:29.421]  anywhere in Europe or the Americas
[02:16:29.421 --> 02:16:31.901]  and you'll see the rates of births and deaths
[02:16:32.861 --> 02:16:36.781]  and you'll see the rainbow inside every single one of them.
[02:16:36.781 --> 02:16:38.461]  You'll see all the terms about the world.
[02:16:38.461 --> 02:16:40.061]  Here's the globe, we're all global.
[02:16:40.781 --> 02:16:43.981]  And you'll see the greeting messages everywhere, everywhere.
[02:16:43.981 --> 02:16:46.141]  And how sacrifice will have to be made
[02:16:46.701 --> 02:16:48.381]  to save the world and the planet
[02:16:49.261 --> 02:16:51.581]  and future generations of society.
[02:16:52.141 --> 02:16:52.861]  Sacrifice.
[02:16:54.381 --> 02:16:56.541]  You tie that together with the institutions
[02:16:57.821 --> 02:17:01.741]  that were comprised of the Fabian society
[02:17:01.741 --> 02:17:04.541]  was a member of the Royal Institute for International Affairs
[02:17:04.541 --> 02:17:05.741]  as one society.
[02:17:06.861 --> 02:17:09.581]  The Council on Foreign Relations is also the same thing
[02:17:09.581 --> 02:17:11.421]  as the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
[02:17:12.861 --> 02:17:16.861]  They are what Thatcher and Professor Carl Quigley called
[02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:18.221]  the parallel government.
[02:17:18.221 --> 02:17:20.461]  They have told us where the future is going to be.
[02:17:21.821 --> 02:17:23.501]  Some of their members have even written books
[02:17:23.501 --> 02:17:27.181]  about the need to cull off massive amounts of the population
[02:17:27.181 --> 02:17:28.301]  by any means possible.
[02:17:28.941 --> 02:17:31.661]  And so we see this final stage being pushed
[02:17:31.661 --> 02:17:33.661]  as they convince us that we are the problem.
[02:17:34.461 --> 02:17:37.341]  The Club of Rome that also belongs to the same group.
[02:17:37.341 --> 02:17:43.421]  In the 1990s, the two founders said that back in the 1970s
[02:17:43.421 --> 02:17:46.061]  at the Club of Rome, they were given the task
[02:17:46.061 --> 02:17:49.421]  as a premier think tank for the globe, this global society.
[02:17:50.301 --> 02:17:55.341]  The task to find ways of reducing the population
[02:17:55.341 --> 02:17:58.381]  and controlling the people to go along with this,
[02:17:58.381 --> 02:18:00.381]  convincing the public how to go along with it.
[02:18:01.181 --> 02:18:04.541]  And they said they looked at all possible means of doing so.
[02:18:04.541 --> 02:18:08.221]  What had worked before, again, geopolitics, strategy.
[02:18:09.261 --> 02:18:13.501]  Under warfare conditions, the public will give up freedom.
[02:18:13.501 --> 02:18:15.901]  The public will be directed by governments,
[02:18:15.901 --> 02:18:19.981]  bureaucracies, and police, military, et cetera.
[02:18:20.941 --> 02:18:23.341]  Under warfare, the public sacrifice,
[02:18:23.341 --> 02:18:25.341]  they'll have less food, they'll ration stuff.
[02:18:25.901 --> 02:18:28.061]  They go along with it to save themselves.
[02:18:28.061 --> 02:18:31.021]  Therefore, they'd have to find a warfare strategy,
[02:18:31.021 --> 02:18:32.381]  a reason for war.
[02:18:32.381 --> 02:18:36.621]  And what they came up with was that man
[02:18:36.621 --> 02:18:38.461]  was the enemy of the planet.
[02:18:39.181 --> 02:18:43.501]  They said that the idea that global warming could be created
[02:18:44.061 --> 02:18:47.661]  and blamed upon mankind would fit the bill.
[02:18:48.221 --> 02:18:49.501]  These are the words they used.
[02:18:49.981 --> 02:18:51.181]  That would fit the bill.
[02:18:51.181 --> 02:18:56.381]  Written in the 1970s, and decided at the think tanks then,
[02:18:56.381 --> 02:18:58.461]  and published by the guys involved
[02:18:59.661 --> 02:19:01.661]  in a book called The First Global Revolution.
[02:19:01.661 --> 02:19:02.701]  Well worth reading.
[02:19:02.701 --> 02:19:05.421]  When they hit upon an idea from a premier think tank,
[02:19:06.061 --> 02:19:08.381]  they will never change that agenda.
[02:19:08.941 --> 02:19:10.381]  I've said before, it wouldn't matter
[02:19:10.381 --> 02:19:13.421]  if we're up to our eyes in snow all year round,
[02:19:14.221 --> 02:19:16.701]  but it will still stick to global warming.
[02:19:16.701 --> 02:19:17.581]  That's the agenda.
[02:19:17.581 --> 02:19:20.701]  Now, of course, they've changed it slightly to climate change,
[02:19:20.701 --> 02:19:22.461]  which simply means changes in the weather.
[02:19:23.421 --> 02:19:26.381]  And they're in the process now of convincing the general public
[02:19:26.941 --> 02:19:29.421]  to be afraid of summer, for instance.
[02:19:30.861 --> 02:19:33.501]  It's all done through the alteration
[02:19:33.501 --> 02:19:35.181]  and distortion of perceptions.
[02:19:36.221 --> 02:19:39.341]  Massive psychology is used on all of this.
[02:19:40.621 --> 02:19:42.781]  And they certainly understand mass psychology.
[02:19:42.781 --> 02:19:43.981]  Of the general public.
[02:19:44.621 --> 02:19:48.781]  These boys don't simply announce things or make up a wish list
[02:19:48.781 --> 02:19:52.301]  of the future and send up the chimney to Santa Claus.
[02:19:52.301 --> 02:19:55.181]  When they come up with an idea, they implement it.
[02:19:57.821 --> 02:20:01.181]  I followed the United Nations Department of Statistics
[02:20:01.901 --> 02:20:05.901]  as they announce every single year the sperm count
[02:20:05.901 --> 02:20:10.301]  of the Western male, which is a very, very, very, very,
[02:20:10.381 --> 02:20:11.741]  the sperm count of the Western male,
[02:20:12.381 --> 02:20:15.021]  which has been falling drastically since 1950s.
[02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:19.821]  They say that it's down by about 75, 85%.
[02:20:21.821 --> 02:20:24.861]  Now, when something like that's happened across the whole of Europe
[02:20:24.861 --> 02:20:27.581]  and the Americas in 50 years,
[02:20:28.461 --> 02:20:32.301]  and they suddenly started noticing it 50 years ago at sudden onset,
[02:20:34.141 --> 02:20:35.821]  and there's no crisis made about it.
[02:20:35.821 --> 02:20:41.181]  There's no, there's no comeback after announcing the statistics.
[02:20:41.181 --> 02:20:43.261]  They just tell you the cold hard statistics
[02:20:43.261 --> 02:20:45.981]  and go off to the next statistic on some other topic.
[02:20:45.981 --> 02:20:47.501]  That means it's part of the agenda.
[02:20:47.501 --> 02:20:49.181]  Otherwise it would be a crisis.
[02:20:49.181 --> 02:20:51.741]  If this wasn't planned and part of the agenda,
[02:20:51.741 --> 02:20:54.781]  believe you me, it would be a crisis if they didn't authorize it.
[02:20:54.781 --> 02:20:57.981]  And now they tell us that the average American
[02:20:58.861 --> 02:21:04.381]  has less than 20% sperm and only about 15% is motile.
[02:21:04.381 --> 02:21:05.501]  That's not a coincidence.
[02:21:05.501 --> 02:21:09.581]  What happened in the 1950s just started out this ball rolling.
[02:21:09.581 --> 02:21:14.861]  In the 1950s, they suddenly put all the known female
[02:21:16.381 --> 02:21:21.261]  synthetic estrogens into food supply.
[02:21:21.261 --> 02:21:22.621]  They put it in baby foods.
[02:21:23.501 --> 02:21:26.701]  Procter and Gamble were the first one to admit after investigation
[02:21:27.421 --> 02:21:30.941]  40 years later that they were using a rinse
[02:21:30.941 --> 02:21:32.941]  to supposedly sterilize the baby bottles.
[02:21:32.941 --> 02:21:36.861]  And it contained bisphenol A.
[02:21:39.181 --> 02:21:42.461]  An odd thing to rinse baby bottles with
[02:21:42.461 --> 02:21:45.981]  when bisphenol A is the very thing that attacks
[02:21:46.541 --> 02:21:48.941]  young male children at that age
[02:21:48.941 --> 02:21:51.261]  and stops the testes from developing properly.
[02:21:52.301 --> 02:21:54.621]  You go back even further into more detail
[02:21:55.181 --> 02:21:57.421]  and you find out that the cosmetic industry
[02:21:57.421 --> 02:21:59.341]  were using insufflatants.
[02:22:00.061 --> 02:22:02.701]  Insufflation is a technique where certain carriers
[02:22:03.261 --> 02:22:05.021]  are put into the creams themselves
[02:22:05.821 --> 02:22:08.941]  and these creams then absorb into the skin
[02:22:08.941 --> 02:22:11.661]  carrying other chemicals with them.
[02:22:11.661 --> 02:22:14.221]  They're almost like they carry the payloads
[02:22:14.221 --> 02:22:15.741]  into the target in the bloodstream.
[02:22:16.621 --> 02:22:19.981]  We find that the women were highly toxic
[02:22:19.981 --> 02:22:23.741]  with the artificial bisphenol A and other ingredients.
[02:22:24.461 --> 02:22:28.381]  And therefore, within the first eight to 12 weeks of pregnancy
[02:22:28.381 --> 02:22:31.101]  with a male child, there's a very good chance
[02:22:31.101 --> 02:22:34.941]  that male grew up to be either almost completely sterile
[02:22:35.661 --> 02:22:38.861]  or to say maybe have some motile sperm.
[02:22:38.861 --> 02:22:41.261]  This was all understood 50 years ago.
[02:22:41.261 --> 02:22:44.541]  Bisphenol A, for instance, was discovered in the 1890s
[02:22:45.181 --> 02:22:47.581]  and the properties it had against humans
[02:22:47.581 --> 02:22:49.261]  especially males was known then too.
[02:22:50.621 --> 02:22:52.381]  Now it's in all the beer cans.
[02:22:53.261 --> 02:22:54.461]  Great target males again.
[02:22:55.261 --> 02:22:56.701]  They line the cans with it.
[02:22:57.821 --> 02:23:00.861]  There's been many exposés on it now.
[02:23:01.181 --> 02:23:03.821]  The CBC in Canada, which is a government-owned
[02:23:04.381 --> 02:23:07.421]  television station, it's the BBC basically of Canada,
[02:23:08.301 --> 02:23:12.061]  did a documentary series called The Disappearing Male
[02:23:13.181 --> 02:23:16.781]  and it goes through all of that in that particular talk
[02:23:17.421 --> 02:23:18.301]  with proof.
[02:23:19.021 --> 02:23:22.381]  Also, when you go back to the writings of Lord Bertrand Russell
[02:23:22.941 --> 02:23:25.181]  and Julian Huxley and Aldous Huxley,
[02:23:26.861 --> 02:23:28.781]  who were also related to the Darwin's, by the way,
[02:23:29.661 --> 02:23:33.981]  you'll find that they talked about ways to sterilise
[02:23:33.981 --> 02:23:37.821]  the populations in the 30s, 40s and 50s.
[02:23:39.581 --> 02:23:42.061]  But of course, they even said they would use the needle
[02:23:42.701 --> 02:23:45.981]  to create a compliance, pliable population
[02:23:46.861 --> 02:23:48.301]  meaning to dumb down the people
[02:23:49.661 --> 02:23:53.661]  and also to bring down the fertility rates.
[02:23:54.461 --> 02:23:57.181]  In the 1950s, across Europe and the Americas,
[02:23:57.821 --> 02:23:58.701]  what came out?
[02:23:58.701 --> 02:24:00.541]  Under vast promotion, what came out?
[02:24:02.061 --> 02:24:03.581]  The polio vaccine came out.
[02:24:05.101 --> 02:24:07.261]  That was the first one ever to come out
[02:24:07.261 --> 02:24:11.181]  through a mass fear campaign, a massive fear campaign.
[02:24:13.021 --> 02:24:16.061]  Polio was very, very rare.
[02:24:17.021 --> 02:24:18.941]  Yet, if you go back to the old path,
[02:24:18.941 --> 02:24:22.221]  black and white newsreels that they showed all over the world
[02:24:22.221 --> 02:24:25.981]  at the time, they showed you the same one boy
[02:24:25.981 --> 02:24:29.581]  and the iron lung and that terrified the whole world.
[02:24:30.861 --> 02:24:33.421]  How many polio cases was actually there?
[02:24:33.421 --> 02:24:34.541]  Was it really polio?
[02:24:35.421 --> 02:24:38.941]  We do know from those first shots, those injections,
[02:24:40.541 --> 02:24:42.061]  the generation that got them all
[02:24:42.781 --> 02:24:45.741]  end up with carrying a hundred simian viruses,
[02:24:47.181 --> 02:24:49.181]  live simian viruses in the shot
[02:24:50.061 --> 02:24:53.501]  and simian 40 only had one function
[02:24:53.581 --> 02:24:57.501]  according to the maker, the discoverer of the vaccine
[02:24:58.381 --> 02:24:59.741]  and that was to cause cancer.
[02:25:00.781 --> 02:25:05.421]  And I also have a copy of the discussion
[02:25:05.421 --> 02:25:10.221]  with this particular man and his staff admitting that
[02:25:10.221 --> 02:25:11.341]  they knew that at the time.
[02:25:12.541 --> 02:25:15.261]  What they said was they thought the risks outweighed
[02:25:15.261 --> 02:25:17.741]  the bad benefits that might come along down the road.
[02:25:18.621 --> 02:25:19.501]  That was their excuse.
[02:25:19.741 --> 02:25:23.101]  Since then, we've been trained to accept more and more
[02:25:23.101 --> 02:25:26.381]  inoculations until babies now get something like 30
[02:25:26.381 --> 02:25:28.221]  inoculations before they're at the hospital.
[02:25:29.021 --> 02:25:32.621]  When you look into the big manufacturers of inoculations,
[02:25:32.621 --> 02:25:37.181]  like the Baxter Laboratories that were in the news recently
[02:25:37.181 --> 02:25:42.621]  because they sent out live flu virus along with the bird flu
[02:25:42.621 --> 02:25:47.021]  virus mixed together and were caught when our country
[02:25:47.501 --> 02:25:51.181]  who tested it on ferrets and the ferrets all died.
[02:25:51.741 --> 02:25:53.661]  They had done the very thing that they say
[02:25:53.661 --> 02:25:55.661]  that they're worried about happening in nature
[02:25:55.661 --> 02:25:58.861]  where the common flu is mixed with a killer flu
[02:25:58.861 --> 02:26:00.141]  and becomes highly contagious.
[02:26:00.141 --> 02:26:02.621]  They actually did it by mistake, we're told,
[02:26:02.621 --> 02:26:05.181]  but go back into Baxter Laboratories even further
[02:26:05.821 --> 02:26:08.781]  and you find Baxter Laboratories was part
[02:26:08.781 --> 02:26:11.101]  of IG Farben group in World War II.
[02:26:12.861 --> 02:26:15.021]  They were responsible for creating chemicals
[02:26:15.661 --> 02:26:19.101]  and so on that were used as gas and they were also
[02:26:19.101 --> 02:26:21.341]  used in other medical experiments on prisoners.
[02:26:22.381 --> 02:26:25.901]  That's in the records of the choir
[02:26:25.901 --> 02:26:27.661]  that went on into IG Farben.
[02:26:27.661 --> 02:26:30.941]  A good book to read is The Crimes and Punishment of IG Farben.
[02:26:31.501 --> 02:26:34.381]  What does it mean when you read that a vitamin
[02:26:34.381 --> 02:26:36.941]  or a mineral is essential?
[02:26:36.941 --> 02:26:39.181]  Well, it means that without it, you die.
[02:26:39.741 --> 02:26:42.381]  Without water, you die on average in about five days.
[02:26:42.381 --> 02:26:44.701]  Without food, you die on average in about a month.
[02:26:45.341 --> 02:26:46.781]  But what's in the food?
[02:26:46.781 --> 02:26:49.421]  The vitamins and the minerals in the trace elements
[02:26:49.421 --> 02:26:51.741]  and the energy that your body needs
[02:26:51.741 --> 02:26:54.061]  to not just survive, but thrive.
[02:26:54.061 --> 02:26:56.221]  And in this insane environment today,
[02:26:56.221 --> 02:26:58.301]  it is now more important than ever
[02:26:58.301 --> 02:27:01.101]  to boost your body's natural defenses.

[02:27:57.581 --> 02:27:59.341]  you've seen their attempts to shut us down.
[02:27:59.341 --> 02:28:01.741]  They're obsessed with this because Infowars
