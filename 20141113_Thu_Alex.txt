[00:00.000 --> 00:21.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he it's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[00:31.000 --> 00:40.000]  A new bill introduced into the Texas legislature just two days ago would allow cops to take your money on the spot.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  What are the implications of that?
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  The bill was introduced by Representative Allen Fletcher.
[00:44.000 --> 00:45.000]  He's a former cop.
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.000]  He's the vice chair of the Homeland Security Committee and he's on the Transportation Committee.
[00:50.000 --> 01:04.000]  This bill would require cops to inform defendants of the possibility of making an immediate payment of the fine and related court costs by use of a credit or debit card and the cop would be the one accepting payment.
[01:04.000 --> 01:07.000]  Now of course the argument for this is that it would expedite collection.
[01:07.000 --> 01:12.000]  It would make everything just run so much more smoothly and securely for the police.
[01:12.000 --> 01:15.000]  But is it something that would increase your security?
[01:15.000 --> 01:22.000]  The police officer as Adon points out is going to have all of your personal information now your credit card information as well.
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.000]  Do we have to worry about a cop committing fraud or identity theft?
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.000]  But by pulling you over and taking your money right there on the spot it might help people to understand what this is really about.
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  It's not about safety.
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  It's about highway robbery.
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  Literally.
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  About 150 years ago before we had cars and speeding tickets, Lysander Spooner asked the rhetorical question,
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.000]  what's the difference between government and a highway robber?
[01:49.000 --> 01:57.000]  Well he pointed out the highway robber doesn't pretend he has any rightful claim to your money or that he intends to use it for your own benefit.
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  And having taken your money he says he leaves you as you would like for him to do.
[02:03.000 --> 02:10.000]  But unlike the government, the highway robber doesn't keep protecting you by commanding that you bow down and serve him
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  by requiring you to do this and forbidding you to do that.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  Of course this is all about the vanishing due process.
[02:16.000 --> 02:24.000]  Vanishing trial by jurors and of course the idea and the understanding of jury nullification has long since left us.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  But this is heading in another direction as well.
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  This is moving towards the computer driven government controlled driverless cars.
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.000]  Of course an essential part of computer driven cars is going to be vehicle to vehicle communication.
[02:38.000 --> 02:46.000]  If you don't think the government will be listening and working with insurance companies to make driving prohibitively expensive, you're not paying attention.
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  They won't need cops for that either.
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.000]  These speeding tickets could be issued automatically.
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  That's how they're going to force you out of controlling your car.
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  That's how they're going to control every single aspect of your movement.
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  But let's look at the effect on the due process and what's happened just this last election in North Carolina.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  North Carolina was the last holdout on requiring jury trials for felonies.
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  It was in the Constitution, but that was just overturned in this last election.
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  North Carolina became the 50th state.
[03:17.000 --> 03:18.000]  That's right.
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.000]  Every one of the states allows a felony defendant to wave a jury trial.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  So what's wrong with being able to wave a jury trial if you really want to?
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  Well, we know how this works in practice.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  Trials by jury have essentially disappeared from this country for a couple of reasons.
[03:35.000 --> 03:46.000]  Number one, there's the plea bargaining aspect where they pressure the defendant with a lot of trumped up charges to plea to one of those charges so they can get that without a trial.
[03:46.000 --> 03:55.000]  The other part of the problem is that since jurors see themselves now as a rubber stamp of the court, you don't have juries really acting independently.
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  And they certainly don't understand the concept of jury nullification.
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  That is, they're not there just to judge the facts of the case.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  They're there to judge how the law is being applied.
[04:06.000 --> 04:16.000]  I would suggest that if you really want to stand up for individual freedom, instead of wasting your time in elections, demand a jury trial for a minor traffic offense.
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  If you lose, you'll have to pay the fine that you would have paid anyway.
[04:19.000 --> 04:25.000]  You're not going to go to jail for decades like you would in a more serious crime.
[04:25.000 --> 04:39.000]  But it gives you a chance to look the jurors in the eye, explain to them what the circumstances are, and tell them that they can cut their chains, the tyranny that is exercised over them if just one of them will cut your chains.
[04:39.000 --> 05:00.000]  For Infowars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[05:09.000 --> 05:38.000]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo at the same time they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.

[06:19.000 --> 06:22.000]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[06:22.000 --> 06:27.000]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.

[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now, counting the weight, staying in shape.

[08:18.000 --> 08:32.000]  Undoubtedly, today is one of the most heavy, crazy news days I've ever seen. Going over the hundreds of articles I have in front of me in video clips, my head is spinning.
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.000]  Extreme weather warning as polar vortex descends on U.S., all hell to break loose.
[08:38.000 --> 08:45.000]  As they prepare for major power outages as ice begins to form on power lines across most of the country,
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.000]  Obama's secret treaty would be the most important step towards a one-world economic system.
[08:51.000 --> 09:01.000]  Barack Obama is secretly negotiating the largest international trade agreement in history, selling out U.S. sovereignty big time.
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  Study cell phone use triples brain tumor rates.
[09:06.000 --> 09:15.000]  Another article. iPhones are for amateurs. With 22 days ago, the Black Friday line has started. Unbelievable.
[09:15.000 --> 09:23.000]  Under Texas bill, cops to collect traffic fines on the spot via credit or debit card. No judge or jury needed.
[09:23.000 --> 09:32.000]  Proposed federal water rule could put property rights of every American entirely at the mercy of the EPA, says Congress.
[09:32.000 --> 09:39.000]  Source Obama to announce 10-point immigration plan via executive action as early as next week.
[09:39.000 --> 09:45.000]  Fox News, Krauthammer-Slam's constitutionally odious immigration proposal.
[09:45.000 --> 09:52.000]  Report, immigrants make up to 42% of Obamacare Medicaid expansion. Did you hear that?
[09:52.000 --> 10:00.000]  Boom! Health and Human Services Chief Obamacare should be available to dreamers. It already is.
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  Only the illegals get everything free to incentivize them to come in.
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.000]  Once they're here, they'll of course be taxed to the Hilt. So that's just some of what's coming up.
[10:10.000 --> 10:19.000]  A nauseating statement by George W. Bush. George Bush, when Jeb beats Hillary, and I hate Hillary so much,
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.000]  that when I see the name Jeb beside Hillary, I like Jeb. That is the manipulation they're involved in.
[10:24.000 --> 10:32.000]  Even my mind detests Hillary Clinton so much that it's like a, you know what sandwich that's got two pounds of you know what in it,
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  versus a you know what sandwich that has one pound of you know what in it.
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  I don't want to eat either sandwich, but the force feeding is being prepared.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  Sorry about the gross analogy, just there's no other analogy that fits.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  And when it fits, wear it, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:47.000 --> 10:54.000]  We're going to be breaking down what to expect from the name. Congress, the Democrats in free fall and so much more.
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  GOP's anti Obamacare push gains new momentum in wake of Gruber video.
[11:00.000 --> 11:07.000]  Back on Monday when we first started playing this clip, and we've now found two other clips of him saying we lie to people,
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  they're stupid, dumb voters, increase the prices, look at the Washington Post.
[11:13.000 --> 11:23.000]  If you guys can punch up on screen for TV viewers, radio listeners can go see the smirk that I've seen in the eyes and on the face of these people
[11:23.000 --> 11:31.000]  that poses academics and poses reasonable people and talk like that when they're preying on the population.
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  And then they want to brag about how they're preying on the population.
[11:35.000 --> 11:43.000]  Headline GOP's anti Obamacare push gains new momentum in wake of Gruber video.
[11:43.000 --> 11:50.000]  The Republican Party's ardent campaign against President Obama's healthcare law gained new momentum Wednesday as lawmakers reacted
[11:50.000 --> 11:57.000]  angrily to assertions by an architect of the policy that it was crafted in a deliberately deceptive way in order to pass Congress.
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  Well, of course it was. And the media, the accomplices went along with it.
[12:02.000 --> 12:10.000]  On both sides of the Capitol, leading conservatives said they will may call Jonathan Gruber to testify about his remarks,
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  which were made last year and surfaced this week in a video on social media.
[12:15.000 --> 12:21.000]  In the video, Gruber suggests that the administration signature healthcare legislation passed in part because of the quote,
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  stupidity of the American voter and a lack of transparency over its funding mechanisms.
[12:26.000 --> 12:35.000]  And he got paid four hundred delicious smackers, four hundred thousand dollars of taxpayer money and just one of his payments
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  to then go out and help fix the numbers in his words, get it all prepared to deceive Congress.
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.000]  Of course, Congress helped write the stinking thing with the big foreign banks and insurance companies.
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.000]  The Republicans went along with it. The Republican leadership, they know what's in it.
[12:51.000 --> 12:58.000]  Just like they're going along with Obama on the trade deal that signs over our sovereignty or shutting off a lot of the power plants,
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  just like they went along with a lot of gun control bills in the past.
[13:01.000 --> 13:10.000]  But they don't want it known they're doing this. So now they have to, oh my gosh, get upset because this type of arrogance,
[13:10.000 --> 13:16.000]  this type of disgusting arrogance is what will bring them down. It's like Al Gore is now officially a billionaire,
[13:16.000 --> 13:26.000]  officially a billionaire. And Al Gore is running around saying you shouldn't live in a nice house.
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  Obama is saying you can't have an air conditioner or a car in Africa while they just live with the carbon footprint.
[13:33.000 --> 13:39.000]  The president has a carbon footprint of thousands of people, conservatively.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  I've never seen someone consume as much as Al Gore.
[13:42.000 --> 13:49.000]  Last time I saw an article about it, he owns like 15 houses. Some of them are 14,000 square feet.
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.000]  He owns villas on the ocean in California that are like, you know, 10,000 feet.
[13:54.000 --> 14:01.000]  Just one of the houses has multiple homes at that property that he said would be underwater by now in 2008.
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.000]  By 2013, he said it would be underwater. He said the polar ice caps would entirely melt by 2013.
[14:07.000 --> 14:17.000]  It was all fraud. It was all lies. And they sit there and they laugh at us and say the giant polar vortex.
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.000]  In fact, let's get that British astrophysicist, top meteorologist on that we get on a few times a year.
[14:22.000 --> 14:28.000]  He predicted when he was on earlier this year, super cold temperatures and even bigger arctic vortex.
[14:28.000 --> 14:36.000]  Of course, he said it about 10 years ago, too, following sun cycles that we would be going into a mini ice age, basically.
[14:36.000 --> 14:46.000]  And that's what all the real scientists are saying. We should thank our lucky stars for the last 12,000 years coming out of the last ice age.
[14:46.000 --> 14:54.000]  That's why we've been able to colonize much of the planet. It's why we've been able to have the North Crossings in the North Atlantic.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  It's why we've been able to have the crops we've had.
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  That's why we've been able to sustain seven and a half billion people, roughly.
[15:06.000 --> 15:13.000]  And if we have a mini ice age or we have a few mini ones before you enter a big one, like birthing pains.
[15:13.000 --> 15:22.000]  If we get a big one, they'll be permafrost in the Panhandle of Texas year round.
[15:22.000 --> 15:32.000]  Minnesota and Illinois and places like that will be unlivable. Canada will be unlivable in most areas.
[15:32.000 --> 15:41.000]  How do you like that? You have five, six winters, like some of the ones we've been having, and it will devastate the North.
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  Billions and billions a year on infrastructure damaged from the cold.
[15:46.000 --> 15:55.000]  The ice age is what you should be worried about, and it has nothing to do with CO2 coming out of your car or coming out of your mouth that plants breathe.
[15:55.000 --> 16:04.000]  Do you ever think about that? You know we exhale what the EPA has listed as the number one toxic waste.
[16:04.000 --> 16:12.000]  You know the carbon cycle is sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. You've got to have those four things for life on terra firma.
[16:12.000 --> 16:19.000]  And they know you know sunshine's good. They know you know oxygen's not bad. They know you know water's not bad.
[16:19.000 --> 16:29.000]  Carbon dioxide sounds scary, like monoxide. That's why we can go out in Austin and get nine out of ten people at the University of Texas or on the Hakenbach trail.
[16:29.000 --> 16:36.000]  People with degrees to sign our petition to ban the hydrogen monoxide that's water and to ban carbon dioxide.
[16:36.000 --> 16:42.000]  We did one two years ago. I want to go back out and have people call for banning carbon dioxide.
[16:42.000 --> 16:51.000]  If you understand that if they ban carbon dioxide, the earth will die. You understand that plants live off of it, and they put off oxygen. That's the carbon cycle.
[16:51.000 --> 16:59.000]  I know you know that, but they want to tax the individual if you read the UN documents. They want to tax humans for breathing.
[16:59.000 --> 17:07.000]  And I said that a decade ago, a few years ago it was in the New York Times, a tax on air, a tax on breathing. You can pull those headlines up.
[17:07.000 --> 17:17.000]  They really mean to do it. And that's what Obama is going ahead with with China, saying he'll executively put all this in place even if Congress, and I'm not lionizing the Republicans,
[17:17.000 --> 17:23.000]  but they're the ones four years ago that voted down the carbon tax and voted down shutting our power plants off.
[17:23.000 --> 17:34.000]  And guess what Obama did? He went ahead with the EPA and the Supreme Court said, you know what, the EPA can act outside of Congress and basically make law.
[17:34.000 --> 17:39.000]  But they said Congress can cut off the funding to the EPA.
[17:39.000 --> 17:49.000]  So see, I tried to go through the articles. I went through about 12, 14 before I hit one and stopped. But we have new Jonathan Grubber videos.
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  And it will be their arrogance that undoes them.
[17:53.000 --> 18:04.000]  As the President lands with about six support jumbo jets, he lands with Air Force One, red carpet, guards everywhere, helicopters, troops, 300 secret service agents just in his detail,
[18:04.000 --> 18:18.000]  hundreds more in whatever city he's in, just a phalanx of hundreds of aids, thousands of bureaucrats behind him in infrastructure, and he says you shouldn't be able to have air conditioning.
[18:18.000 --> 18:28.000]  Because it puts off CO2. We ought to have incentives for CO2. Did you know that the CO2, you can look at it in the last thousand years and it goes up and down a little bit.
[18:28.000 --> 18:37.000]  But if you look back into the mudflats and the ice caps, you go back 100,000, 200,000, 300,000 a million years, it's the lowest it's ever been the last thousand years.
[18:37.000 --> 18:49.000]  So scientists, real scientists, climatologists, planetologists, I would call them, to use a Herbert word, are totally freaking out. It appears we're losing our atmosphere right now, like Mars did.
[18:49.000 --> 19:00.000]  Mars used to have water all over it, boys and girls. We're losing our atmosphere and it's like these demons that run things who detonated hundreds of hydras and bombs in the upper atmosphere,
[19:00.000 --> 19:09.000]  admittedly trying to blow holes in it. That's on the History Channel, Discovery Channel as a show, Trinity and beyond, narrated by Shatner.
[19:09.000 --> 19:18.000]  And they just report they were trying to blow holes in the atmosphere. So the government detonates hydrogen bombs in the atmosphere.
[19:18.000 --> 19:29.000]  But you can't have your car. You understand that? They plant GMO everywhere that kills the honeybees and rats and insects that eat it.
[19:29.000 --> 19:41.000]  But you are supposed to eat it. When we come back, I'm going to control myself. I've only gotten about 14 articles. I'm going to hit, I'm going to go crazy.
[19:41.000 --> 19:50.000]  I'm going to hit 100 articles or somebody's going to come in here and hit me upside down with a shovel. That's a figure of speech. I'm not being serious.
[19:50.000 --> 20:00.000]  PresentPlanet.tv, infowars.com, also on Twitter, Real College Jones. If you're listening or watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[20:20.000 --> 20:39.000]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical. Civil unrest, riots, looting, it's happening now right here in the United States and your rights are at risk.

[26:48.000 --> 26:59.000]  Arctic Vortex, leading physics professor, Michikou, how do you pronounce that? I hear his name on the news all the time, but A-K-A-K-U,
[26:59.000 --> 27:11.000]  Michikou, yeah, we always try to get him on, of the University of New York has signaled a warning concerning the polar vortex now bringing extreme cold weather to the majority of states in the U.S.
[27:11.000 --> 27:19.000]  Superstorm, nerdy, packs more energy than hurricane sanding, is headed our way, and we are in the bull's eye.
[27:19.000 --> 27:35.000]  This weekend it's going to plow into Alaska, creating 50-foot waves, then by mid-week all hell breaks loose. It's going to combine with jet stream pushing Arctic air, perhaps as low as Florida, he writes for CBS News.
[27:35.000 --> 27:51.000]  In a worst case scenario, it could mean a deep freeze, it means airlines cancelling flights left and right, it means transportation being disrupted, we're talking disruption that will peak between November 13th and November 15th, starting right now.
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  But we'll ripple throughout the rest of November, A-K-A-K-U added.
[27:56.000 --> 28:08.000]  Telling viewers to get used to polar vortexes because the Earth is changing, and we're going to see more violent swings. Well, yeah, you've got all this secret geoengineering going on with the Department of Energy and other governments,
[28:08.000 --> 28:19.000]  and you've got this guy that pushes global warming, and see now they're like, oh, pay carbon taxes because these things are getting violent, there's always been giant blue northers coming in.
[28:19.000 --> 28:30.000]  They just call them now mega vortexes. There's always been 10 feet of snow, sometimes 6 feet of snow. There's always been avalanches.
[28:30.000 --> 28:39.000]  What do you think explorers did that went across the United States, like Lewis and Clark? What do you think explorers went up to Alaska did, going over those mountains?
[28:39.000 --> 28:52.000]  I mean, what do you think we live in here? But like we've never discovered anything. Oh my gosh, sometimes it gets really cold and that proves global warming.
[28:52.000 --> 29:05.000]  No. The sun, that's why the UN five years ago had a vote and said, we vote that the sun is not a fat climate. We'd be absolute zero without the sun in a matter of hours.
[29:05.000 --> 29:17.000]  If the sun wasn't shining within a day or so, physicists estimate that it would be absolute zero, except in deeper volcanic fissures.
[29:17.000 --> 29:30.000]  It is the sun. And I know people think that's a conspiracy because that's because there's been so brainwashed that they don't know the sun actually gives the earth life, the plants, photosynthesis, everything.
[29:30.000 --> 29:40.000]  I know Al Gore says it doesn't. But it's why the polar ice caps on Mars were getting smaller. Now the sun's cooled down, they're getting bigger again.
[29:40.000 --> 29:49.000]  Because that's what happens. The sun. In the summer, it's hot. In the winter, it's cold because the sun. We're not tilted towards it.
[29:49.000 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the march. The Empire. I know that's radical. I know what you're talking about. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:38.000 --> 33:48.000]  We are GO! Ignite Engines. Earth-based Delta. Resistance operations are live.
[33:48.000 --> 34:06.000]  It's an emergency worldwide transmission to all people that wish the human species be able to continue on and not be irrevocably butchered and destroyed and mutilated by the globalist in their mad dash to play God and take over the planet.
[34:06.000 --> 34:15.000]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday transmission. It is the 13th of November 2014.
[34:15.000 --> 34:20.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones. I want to open the phones.
[34:20.000 --> 34:27.000]  Dr. Group will be in studio with us in the next hour to get into a host of news. He's got a big list of things he wants to get into.
[34:27.000 --> 34:34.000]  But maybe I'll even get him to tell us about some of the secret Army special operations inside North Korea.
[34:34.000 --> 34:40.000]  He'll sort of tell us a little bit about that the other day, but wouldn't tell us too much. Maybe he'll get into some of that interesting stories.
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.000]  But Dr. Edward Group is going to be in studio. We'll have open phones for him as well.
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.000]  And, member of the secret sauce, the last six months I've been taking every day on air.
[34:50.000 --> 34:58.000]  Well, we're going to announce what the secret sauce is today at the start of the second segment.
[34:58.000 --> 35:07.000]  That is coming up today. It has taken us a long time to get it developed, to get it certified, to get it all double tested.
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  And we have been able to do it.
[35:11.000 --> 35:17.000]  And from the research we've done, it is unique and the best out there.
[35:17.000 --> 35:26.000]  And it will be a game changer. That's why infowarslife.com and the revolutionary supplement nutraceuticals that are there are big game changers
[35:26.000 --> 35:32.000]  and are turning a lot of heads in the entire supplement and nutraceutical community.
[35:32.000 --> 35:39.000]  So that's coming up. Speaking of that, we had sold out for about a week of the oxy powder that we have discounted with promo code now.
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  We already had the lowest price on it, but you can promo code now.
[35:43.000 --> 35:48.000]  We're keeping that for another week and then it is going to end next week.
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.000]  Next Thursday, that special will end across the board of infowarslife.com.
[35:54.000 --> 35:59.000]  NOW gets you 5% off even if something's already discounted as much as 25%.
[35:59.000 --> 36:08.000]  The only special you don't get it on is the X2 nation iodine with the lung cleanse 10% off when you get both of them together across the board.
[36:08.000 --> 36:18.000]  That special is going to end as well next week because we're going to have to end it because we're going to be backordered on Survival Shield X2.
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  We do have the original Survival Shield. It's also excellent.
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  I don't know how long we're going to be backordered. Maybe a week, maybe three weeks, maybe four weeks.
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  It's kind of like DNA force. We thought 12 weeks, it was 16 weeks.
[36:27.000 --> 36:33.000]  We're going to shell out soon of DNA force as well. Infowarslife.com.
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  It's not just revolutionary products. It also supports the broadcast.
[36:37.000 --> 36:43.000]  So it's a win-win-win across the board. Infowarslife.com.
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  We have the great Wake of America coffee.
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.000]  That's my favorite blend of coffee from southern Mexico and the high mountains.
[36:49.000 --> 36:54.000]  Organically grown volcanic soil by the Chiapas Rebels basically.
[36:54.000 --> 37:02.000]  And I've just been drinking it for 14 years and found a distributor of the stuff down there that I think is even as good as the stuff or better that I get in Austin.
[37:02.000 --> 37:08.000]  And so it's high quality and it's available at infowarslife.com.
[37:08.000 --> 37:15.000]  The big umbrella site is infowarsstore.com where you can find all the Made in America t-shirts and ball caps and belt buckles.
[37:15.000 --> 37:22.000]  And the bottle breacher is made by the Navy Seals that we popularized and now got picked up by Shark Tank.
[37:22.000 --> 37:30.000]  That show up there with the owner of the sports team up there, Mark Cuban.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  It's just funny. Like we call them, go, oh, you won Shark Tank. We want to have you on to talk about it.
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  They go, oh, the investors say we have to wait and get permission.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  So that's happened. Let's not exaggerate.
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.000]  Thousands of times where we break something big and promote it, which I don't care.
[37:45.000 --> 37:54.000]  And then folks are too cool for school to then come back on the show when our show is bigger than something like Shark Tank.
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  And I know nothing against Shark Tank. I know Mark Cuban.
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  Talk to him. He's in the New York Times. What happened?
[38:01.000 --> 38:08.000]  I'm not going to tell that story again, but they called him up and they said, we're going to arrest you if you work with Alex Jones.
[38:08.000 --> 38:16.000]  We're going to set you up. And he backed out of the deal to put our film and over a thousand movie theaters.
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  And they still indicted him for insider trading.
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  And when you're worth like $4 billion like he is, a couple hundred thousand dollars was not insider trading.
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  It's called selling stock. We think it's going to go down, but that's that's how things work.
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.000]  So maybe they just don't want to show us that maybe he doesn't want to be indicted again.
[38:32.000 --> 38:42.000]  I don't know. I just continually go through this, this intimidation business that goes on out there because they know if this information ever gets popularized,
[38:42.000 --> 38:50.000]  my particular bird's eye view of the world, which is very, very accurate compared to most based on history, based on documents, based on research,
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  based on interviewing thousands of experts, it's game over.
[38:54.000 --> 39:00.000]  Well, let me give the establishment a little news here before I get back into the news and take your phone calls.
[39:00.000 --> 39:06.000]  And I guess we'll punch up my phone system in here. I'd X'd out of it.
[39:06.000 --> 39:14.000]  The toll free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231-800-25992.
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.000]  Well, that's the network number I forgot today. That's not the number you call.
[39:19.000 --> 39:26.000]  In fact, we just won't take calls this hour. That'll make it that much easier because I'm already running low on time here before the guest judge.
[39:26.000 --> 39:32.000]  I'll open it up on our phone system in the next hour with Dr. Group at 877-789-2539.
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  I forgot we're entirely producing the show right now.
[39:35.000 --> 39:45.000]  Well, Ted Anderson, John Harmon, and others from GCN are down here visiting the parent network that we syndicate through doing a lot of important work down here.
[39:45.000 --> 39:53.000]  So today, John's usually up there helping run the show, but Scott's up there doing a great job today, so that's why we're taking the phone calls out of our system.
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.000]  Back to the really important point that I was getting into.
[39:58.000 --> 40:08.000]  When you listen now to Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Fox News, and MSNBC, the White House Media Matters, they've all said this.
[40:08.000 --> 40:19.000]  That's true. They say the talking points start on Alex Jones, and then they go out to the rest of the conservative media, and it's horrible because he's radicalizing them.
[40:19.000 --> 40:28.000]  And they also throw Matt Drudging, as a lot of it starts with Drudge. They'll say, starts with Alex Jones, starts with Matt Drudge at DrudgeReport.com, and it's just absolutely horrible.
[40:28.000 --> 40:37.000]  And we've traced back scores of bills that have even passed and investigations to infowars.com and this horrible deranged demon.
[40:37.000 --> 40:43.000]  They've even used those words, deranged extremist, horrible person, on and on and on.
[40:43.000 --> 40:51.000]  Don't you understand that I'm not the one radicalizing? You radicalize people by your radical takeover.
[40:51.000 --> 41:03.000]  We just look radical because we're old fashioned Americans that want basic freedom, basic rights to self-defense, basic private property, basic right to worship as we see fit or not to worship.
[41:03.000 --> 41:13.000]  We don't want big banks and corporations lobbying for higher taxes because they get the money in banker bailouts or lobbying for Obamacare that's a direct tax to corporations.
[41:13.000 --> 41:25.000]  And then you sit around on TV and call us dumb effers like Zuckerberg or call us stupid and how lack of transparency helped get it passed.
[41:25.000 --> 41:35.000]  You guys have jumped the shark and every poll shows you've lost the people. 93% don't like Congress.
[41:35.000 --> 41:42.000]  The Republican Congress though in polls is now more popular than Obama. That is extremely rare to have Congress up at 40%.
[41:42.000 --> 41:49.000]  Only Republicans though. And that's only because they're being given a shot to not drive the bus over the cliff.
[41:49.000 --> 42:00.000]  And if they don't respond, no amount of false flags, no amount of nuclear false flags, no amount of biological false flags, no amount of blowing up a federal building and blaming it on talk radio,
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.000]  no amount of you guys pulling dirty tricks is going to put your Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[42:05.000 --> 42:11.000]  So I'm going to tell you, I know you're a mad mob of crooks and there isn't really a central brain to it. There's more of an evil spirit.
[42:11.000 --> 42:22.000]  But you need to back off now. You need to stop being reckless now. Notice I talked to them like a FBI negotiator would talk to a psychopath holding six kids hostage.
[42:22.000 --> 42:30.000]  That's basically what my job is, is explain reality. You're not going to win. You're surrounded. You'll only be able to carry out these criminal operations.
[42:30.000 --> 42:40.000]  We weren't aware of you. We know who you are. You're not getting out. Right now you're just facing a long prison sentence. Don't hurt the kids.
[42:40.000 --> 42:46.000]  Everything will be all right. Put your hands up and just come out.
[42:46.000 --> 42:53.000]  Everything's going to be okay. Those are little kids. Here's their names. Their mommies and their daddies love them. Here, talk to their mommies and daddies.
[42:53.000 --> 43:01.000]  Because that's what you do. If people aren't pure psychopaths or pure sociopaths, you talk to them and they go, here's Jenny's puppy.
[43:01.000 --> 43:06.000]  Maybe you don't have emotions for humans, but maybe for a dog. You know, Hitler did for Blondie.
[43:06.000 --> 43:14.000]  Her little puppy Snoopy's. Snoopy's or Snoopette or Spotty or Blackie or whatever the dog's name is.
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.000]  Snowball. Whatever the dog's name is.
[43:17.000 --> 43:23.000]  Stinker.
[43:23.000 --> 43:32.000]  Wants to see her friend. Stinker sleeps in the bed with Jenny every night and cuddles up next to her. Why don't you let her come back to her doggie?
[43:32.000 --> 43:40.000]  See, that's how we have to talk to them. Do you understand psychopaths? Do you understand people like Gruber that when you're up dancing around on TV,
[43:40.000 --> 43:47.000]  how about how dumb we are and how you're ripping us off and how it's a giant scam to rip off innocent, healthy people to take over?
[43:47.000 --> 43:54.000]  Do you understand that we see you now and you're surrounded?
[43:54.000 --> 44:06.000]  It doesn't matter if you compromise the FBI and the CIA and all their agencies. It doesn't matter. You're now nakedly running around committing all these crimes and people are aware of it.
[44:06.000 --> 44:14.000]  Obamacare is a crime in my educated view and according to other educated views and anybody can look at the screw job.
[44:14.000 --> 44:21.000]  It is a manifest premeditated screw job and Gruber said he only said it once and it was a misspeak.
[44:21.000 --> 44:29.000]  Now there's two other videos of him saying the exact same thing. In fact, we'll play those in the next segment.
[44:29.000 --> 44:37.000]  But it's the nature of these people and I'm not even saying Gruber is a psychopath.
[44:37.000 --> 44:47.000]  Maybe he doesn't know that it's racketeering in the books to organize a fraud and to sneak it through and to lie to the public
[44:47.000 --> 44:52.000]  when you know it's a giant screw job and benefits foreign banks just because you got $400,000.
[44:52.000 --> 44:59.000]  And I guess you've rationalized it by projecting it onto the public that they deserve it because they're dumb.
[44:59.000 --> 45:09.000]  A five-year-old doesn't deserve to be grabbed out of the back of their yard and taken and put in snuff films because they're, quote, dumb and got in the van.
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.000]  And Gruber would say, well, I'm not doing that. No, I'm not saying you're doing that, Gruber, but that's the criminal continuum.
[45:13.000 --> 45:21.000]  You know, you got you kind of here in the middle saying, oh, you know what, death panels, you're screwing people over, massively increasing taxes to foreign banks, lying to folks.
[45:21.000 --> 45:28.000]  Well, yeah, we kept it secret, hit it, lack of transparency and the public being dumb, those two factors helped get us past.
[45:28.000 --> 45:34.000]  They deserve it, you know, they're dumb. You got that kind of here in the middle of the continuum.
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  And then over here you got grabbing kids on the extreme end out of the back of their yard.
[45:38.000 --> 45:45.000]  And you know what, they always deserve it, huh? Stupid little kid, she had not gotten the van.
[45:45.000 --> 45:52.000]  See, and we have to sit here and watch you parade back and forth, up and down in front of us all arrogantly.
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  And we're not supposed to get angry. They always say, don't get angry.
[45:55.000 --> 46:00.000]  That, that, that, that, don't get angry like Alex Jones, that will discredit you.
[46:00.000 --> 46:06.000]  But in every case in history, our founders sure got angry.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  Imagine how domesticated America's cotton, I've used this example many times.
[46:10.000 --> 46:21.000]  When I go on BBC in studio live and they can't shut me off or CNN live or Fox live or anything, I will make a scene.
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  Because if somebody's in a drug induced coma, how do you try to wake them up?
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.000]  You start yelling and screaming, you throw cold water on them.
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.000]  You don't just business as usual, let them control the debate.
[46:32.000 --> 46:37.000]  You have to overshoot the whole deal and boomerang back in on them to where they can't even respond
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.000]  because there's such overwhelming veritas that they're being hit with.
[46:41.000 --> 46:48.000]  And that's what people wake up to. That's what people are then aware of.
[46:48.000 --> 46:54.000]  That's what can get through to people. That's how we wake people up is getting out of this trance, getting out of this comfort zone,
[46:54.000 --> 47:01.000]  getting angry, getting upset like Howard Beale says in the 1970s movie Network, the newscaster.
[47:01.000 --> 47:05.000]  I don't know what to do about the inflation and the Russians and the crime and the streets.
[47:05.000 --> 47:11.000]  All I know is first you've got to get mad. You got to say I'm a human being. My life has value.
[47:11.000 --> 47:17.000]  What do you see out of Al Gore and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and all these people, they say you don't have value.
[47:17.000 --> 47:23.000]  Humans are ugly. Humans are bad. You have to do what we say. We'll perfect you. We'll make it a utopia.
[47:23.000 --> 47:29.000]  We'll tell you what's cool. We'll tell you what's trendy. We'll tell you the way to live and then you'll be successful.
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  And then you go and you comply with them and you get degrees that don't matter.
[47:33.000 --> 47:38.000]  You get brain tumors from the cell phones, stomach tumors in your guts from the GMO.
[47:38.000 --> 47:45.000]  You get mentally retarded and autistic children. You get all the curses of the glitz and the glamour of this system
[47:45.000 --> 47:53.000]  because this system is as alien as a deep space planetoid from a trillion light years away
[47:53.000 --> 47:59.000]  that began its journey here at the beginning of civilization. This is fiction, but it's an allegory.
[47:59.000 --> 48:07.000]  Coming here with an army of scientific robots to take over covertly and set up a plan
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  to incrementally enslave and then destroy humanity.
[48:11.000 --> 48:19.000]  But first, horribly defacing us, horribly torturing us, tearing us apart, tearing our psyches apart, torturing us,
[48:19.000 --> 48:29.000]  rendering us down, sucking our souls and our spirit and our greatness out first, having a victory over our goodness,
[48:29.000 --> 48:39.000]  a victory over our love, a victory over our beauty, a victory over our honor, a victory over our strength.
[48:39.000 --> 48:49.000]  It is a demonic spirit out of the dimensions of hell, a vent horizon.
[48:49.000 --> 48:58.000]  And even if the spirit isn't a real entity, we as a group collective are manifesting it any way you slice it.
[48:58.000 --> 49:07.000]  The group collective is manifesting a great evil and anyone who is not part of it can feel it rising.
[49:07.000 --> 49:13.000]  That's what I talked about yesterday, to have the knowledge of good and evil.
[49:13.000 --> 49:19.000]  See, at the time of the garden, whether you believe it or not, or it's an allegory, there is innocence.
[49:19.000 --> 49:25.000]  They have knowledge of man and woman being together, mating.
[49:25.000 --> 49:32.000]  They have knowledge of that there is a tree and they've been told not to eat of it, but it gives them the knowledge of evil.
[49:32.000 --> 49:44.000]  They already had the knowledge of good, then they got the knowledge of evil, of twisted science, of fraud, of scams, of manipulations, of not straight shooting.
[49:44.000 --> 49:53.000]  And someone who is into the knowledge of evil looks at me and I'm as alien to them as they're alien to me, except I have the knowledge of good and evil as well.
[49:53.000 --> 50:05.000]  So even though I'm not inherently evil, I have the mind in a dual system, I have the knowledge of good and evil from the time of Adam and Eve.
[50:05.000 --> 50:11.000]  I wish I only had the knowledge of good, pre-full.
[50:11.000 --> 50:18.000]  But the modern man, this is the great truth that I've said it before, once you are baptized into the New World Order,
[50:18.000 --> 50:25.000]  once you spiritually are immersed in it from birth and your soul is able to be snuffed out, it's still there but it's twisted.
[50:25.000 --> 50:37.000]  It's a dark shade of what it was and it only resonates in the fraud and so it invents evil and it creates fallen evil systems.
[50:37.000 --> 50:44.000]  That's why anything that comes out of the New World Order, cell phones, GMOs, chemtrails, everything they do may have it look good on the surface.
[50:44.000 --> 50:50.000]  It's poison because it's evil, it can't help it, it's what it does.
[50:50.000 --> 51:17.000]  That's why things are so bad is because this evil is rising but also trying to anesthetize us to the pain while it does it.

[54:30.000 --> 54:45.600]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind.
[54:45.600 --> 54:53.160]  There is a number one music video right now with Mickey Minaj is one of the biggest hip
[54:53.160 --> 55:02.360]  hop people in the world that has Nazi and police state imagery and is clearly meant
[55:02.360 --> 55:05.200]  to show that it's bad.
[55:05.200 --> 55:07.640]  But a lot of people are calling for it to be taken down.
[55:07.640 --> 55:15.880]  That's kind of like feminist demand censorship of Princess Leia cat calling parody video.
[55:15.880 --> 55:21.280]  Well we have the director working on getting them on right now they say they want to come
[55:21.280 --> 55:27.520]  on today to explain what's really going on with the film.
[55:27.520 --> 55:31.720]  So go ahead and set that up and Nico if you need to do it even while Dr. Gribson with us
[55:31.720 --> 55:36.000]  I know Clive and Bundy is coming on as well today just whatever time slot you need because
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.760]  it's important and we need to discuss that.
[55:40.760 --> 55:45.680]  Video got launched yesterday as 4 million views it won't get like 100 million views.
[55:45.680 --> 55:50.760]  And again we can have our police dress like Nazis we can have Nazi policies.
[55:50.760 --> 55:57.680]  We can have Nazi surveillance Nazi secret testing.
[55:57.680 --> 56:11.040]  But whatever you do don't ever show people.
[56:11.040 --> 56:17.240]  Dressed up as Nazis and of course it's obvious why they want it down.
[56:17.240 --> 56:27.440]  It looks like they've got Obama dressed up like the Pope and that's just a big no no.
[56:27.440 --> 56:32.440]  And again even if you don't agree with this and don't get what the music video is about
[56:32.440 --> 56:37.080]  the reason they're trying to slap them down right now is they don't want hip hop getting
[56:37.080 --> 56:41.920]  political just like we talked about with Rick Ross yesterday on there.
[56:41.920 --> 56:50.840]  They do not want hip hop getting political because the minute it gets really political
[56:50.840 --> 56:56.160]  and isn't just race baiting and gang banging stuff then it's become a worldwide force the
[56:56.160 --> 56:59.440]  globalists basically push to take over other cultures.
[56:59.440 --> 57:03.440]  It was a weapon designed to destroy blacks it's been so successful that they've moved
[57:03.440 --> 57:08.040]  it on to the rest of the world and that's that's now American export culture is thug
[57:08.040 --> 57:14.600]  gangsterism through hip hop and we had we have a special report that we shot last night
[57:14.600 --> 57:19.360]  that was one of the most powerful things we've ever shot with Rick Ross but I mean one of
[57:19.360 --> 57:25.160]  the most powerful things we've ever done period where he calls out the fake Rick Ross and
[57:25.160 --> 57:30.480]  says stop using this as a weapon stop hurting the youth stop pushing drug culture.
[57:30.480 --> 57:36.320]  See you put a song out against mind control the Illuminati and Nazis which is what the
[57:36.320 --> 57:42.880]  video does then they want it taken down because Mickey Minaj and the director they need to
[57:42.880 --> 57:49.720]  be taught that you get off the script you're done you get up there and you torque your
[57:49.720 --> 57:54.920]  rear end and you get up there you talk about gang banging and you get up there you talk
[57:54.920 --> 58:00.680]  about mac and the G's and slinging the rock and everything's going to be alright throw
[58:00.680 --> 58:09.120]  it in the gutter go buy another then everything is a okay because you see me and my homies
[58:09.120 --> 58:15.920]  would like to play this game but the minute that happens the government's going to come
[58:15.920 --> 58:19.880]  in on you but what's going to happen if it ever catches fire it'll be super popular so
[58:19.880 --> 58:24.240]  folks want to do this because this is what's popular and look at this show how popular
[58:24.240 --> 58:29.200]  it is if it ever catches fire we take over quick it could happen quick we get hip hop
[58:29.200 --> 58:34.280]  on our side I'm telling you it's a major blow to the new world order it's the kind of thing
[58:34.280 --> 58:41.000]  that could take them down or a woman torturing herself on the Capitol lawn thank you for

[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:43.000]  us in one hour exclusive Nicki Minaj's only director says neither I nor the video or anti
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:56.400]  Semitic I mean give me a break folks the video is exposing fascism and is exposing the Illuminati

[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:08.320]  play it on commercial radio here SEC radio but he's come out and said sorry I'm not sorry
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.840]  I had an opportunity in an outlet which I knew would reach millions of people I wanted to
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:17.040]  make a statement the term New World Order isn't just an edgy pop culture reference it's a
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:22.360]  very real and was a term used by President George HW Bush ironically 10 years to the
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:30.920]  day before 9-11 that's right guess who he's a listener MK ultra the school of the Americas
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:38.320]  Bush family owned the fact that in every recent war the opposition leader has worked with
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:50.400]  the CIA that's what's in the song so they're just like oh it shows Nazis ban it yeah it's
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.480]  like when Charlie Chaplin dressed up as a Nazi did they call for them to ban it no he
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:58.760]  was making fun of Hitler I've had it with these people how stupid do they think you
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:04.600]  are how dumb do they think I am in fact get me Charlie Chaplin's dictator of the world
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:08.920]  I forget the name of the film the whole things of yeah yeah I think it's the greatest speech
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:15.000]  was also dick it's where he's bouncing the the beach ball the world on his butt hey was
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.040]  Charlie Chaplin a credible comedian who was a Jew is he anti-semitic I'm tired of this
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:27.560]  I'm tired of it I tell you what when George Soros gets arrested as a Nazi war criminal
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:33.240]  which he is a Nazi collaborator then I'll start taking you guys have any credibility
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:38.880]  how's that sound when the ADL comes out against Schwarzenegger saying he admires Hitler then
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.480]  I'll have a little bit of respect for you you know what I don't you use this to demonize
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:55.600]  people that are exposing fascism that's what you do and another quote is look up from your
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:01.120]  smartphone and smell the bleep and roses I'm trying to help you people vilify artists for
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.960]  using this type of imagery in their work as if they're part of the one percent club believe
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:13.200]  me any artist who has a brain cells knows they're not in that club that's right in my opinion
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:17.640]  it's not glorification it's a subliminal warning because you can't openly say these kinds of
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:23.840]  things me I don't give a bleep I have no corporate interest PR team or image to maintain that's

[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:32.440]  the people will return to the people and so long as men die liberty will never perish
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:40.240]  the answer to nineteen eighty four is seventeen seventy six you're listening to the alex jones
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:09:01.440]  show that was from nineteen forty the end of the film the great dictator
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:06.440]  dr ebra group is in studio with us the reason we played that intro liner that we've only
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:10.960]  played a few of the times is that it clicked when I saw this on television this morning
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:17.640]  and saw it in the news headlines you know is niki manage racist is she any somatic
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:24.280]  is the director jeff osborne a bad person well we ended up reaching out to osborne it turns
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:29.280]  out he's aware of us and a listener and is going to be coming on at the start of the
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:39.120]  next hour is a popular music video director and film director and he said obviously this
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:44.720]  is to show that fascism is rising mind control police state that's why the people are in
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:49.840]  fascist style uniforms that aren't even not see uniforms there is not see as charlie chaplin
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:55.080]  but even actor plays a not see it doesn't mean they're not see if harrison ford plays
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:00.760]  a bad guy in a movie it doesn't mean he's really a bad guy in life this is political
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:10.200]  correctness by design trying to censor things there's a video out that's a parody piece
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.360]  on the feminist group that did the cat call video where the woman walks around new york
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:21.440]  and gets whistled at by guys and so they had princess leia do it and the feminist are calling
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:27.840]  the store on info wars dot com for that to be banned and taken down so they're just making
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:35.800]  normal human activity men you know hitting on women and if you talk if you talk to a
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:41.040]  woman that's fine i think i think it's very gentlemanly to whistle at them but if they
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:46.560]  then ignore you and you keep pushing it then it starts to become harassment but i've had
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:52.080]  women back when i was about 30 pounds louder than i am now whistle at me i mean from the
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:57.680]  time i was about 14 the time i was about 25 and did i get mad no and and by the way i'll
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:01.200]  be honest with you back in college and stuff i whistled at plenty of women i got plenty
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:07.520]  of hot dates from doing it so there's a reason people do it a lot of women like it and and
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.400]  this is just human activity i mean of a badger a male badger runs up and scratches the dirt
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:18.800]  and and and makes an excited noise to a female badger is it harassment should he be locked
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:27.920]  up is he some kind of you know evil racist or something or is he a sexist this is just
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:34.800]  trying to create more class warfare this is simply trying to create more divisions more
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:41.400]  manipulation while the globalist are attacking the very species itself so i played the charlie
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:46.920]  chaplain piece and we'll show some of the famous film footage of that for tv viewers
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:51.480]  radio lizards can just go to info wars dot com or about to post the video of the great dictator
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:57.800]  with charlie chaplain playing the part of hitler in a nazi uniform now charlie chaplain was jewish
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:05.400]  and he was acting like he was pro nazi to illustrate how absurd it is as satyr as a satirist
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:10.840]  as satire i don't even do a lot of satire anymore because the public is so dumb down on average not
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:15.560]  our audience but folks that i would reach out to on youtube that when i dress up as the devil or
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:22.120]  the joker people really freak out and think that because i'm a good actor when i need to be playing
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:27.960]  the part of an evil person or you know whatever that i must be inherently bad so we're going to
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:35.720]  ask the question is charlie chaplain anti-semitic is headline you know nicky menage her director
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.200]  and charlie chaplain anti-semitic and say that's right according now to the people online in the
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:49.320]  news articles wanting it pulled down to show that we're going into a fascist society is anti-semitic
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:58.520]  and they've so overused this anti-semitism racism line your racist if you don't like obama care
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.680]  that it doesn't even have an effect anymore when you're dealing with real anti-semitics
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:10.200]  are real racist and it's very upsetting so we got the director coming on at uh the you know the
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:14.680]  six seven after uh next hour for the balance of the time they'll also be on the nightly news
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:21.080]  tonight with some other breaking news is dr edward group anthony gucciardi went up last weekend to
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:28.200]  investigate uh in dalis at a medical center with medical doctors and nurses and he hung out with
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.040]  them all weekend we're friends with them they also do work down here in austin i'll just leave it at
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.800]  that and they said yes they are taking people out of the hospitals that appear to have bola it's it's
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:42.520]  still ongoing uh you had the forbes writers say he was at the big press conference and the media
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:46.920]  all agreed to cover up Ebola cases that was in the news a week and a half ago drudge picked it up
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:51.960]  i mean this is in forbes now we've had a medical doctor on dr lorenzi i want to get him on tomorrow
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:56.600]  or sunday i'm going to be live that's where we plan to really break this but i said and anthony said
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:00.840]  yeah but they declared no Ebola cases people just basically won't believe us but i'm like it doesn't
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:05.240]  matter if medical doctors on record and off record and you're going in meeting and they're
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.960]  saying yes there appears to be Ebola and they're disappearing people the story is the disappearing
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:15.720]  people and then you have forbes saying yeah we were in on a meeting told to cover it up and the cops
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:20.120]  have called and it's been in the news and said we've been told to cover it up i'm not saying it's
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.120]  the end of the world i don't think we're gonna have an epidemic or pandemic or something but it
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:29.960]  sets the precedent of such control that they could do other things and cover up a disappearing talk
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:36.680]  show host so they announced a few days ago the country is Ebola free as it exponentially ravages
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:41.160]  africa the cases go from the tens of thousands of the hundreds of thousands up towards the millions
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.400]  by december they're estimating they're going to leave the flights coming in they keep issuing the
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.560]  visas and they're just saying there's no problem kind of like the open border was going on for a
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.560]  good six months before we finally documented it that they're busting the illegals in not just letting
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:59.240]  them in so the moral of the story is we're flying blind it's like driving a car eight miles an hour
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:05.560]  with our eyes closed and we saw some semis coming down the other lane we're blinded now we don't
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:10.040]  know but i hear cars around me and so i don't know how many cars there i don't know how much
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.040]  Ebola there is but we need to get pulled over immediately we need to take our foot off the
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:19.560]  gas we need to find out what's going on that's my allegory now we're going to talk about a big
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.880]  announcement first then get into a bunch of medical news the doctor group wants to get into but for
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:33.320]  more than two years but two years with us doctor group has been trying to come out with the most
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:46.680]  powerful form for infowarslife.com of bioavailable fusion of b-12 and this is the type one part
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:52.920]  of it half of it that people inject but you don't inject it no needles needed other groups just put
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:59.400]  out pun intended synthetic or the other forms we're going to break down those other forms this is
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:05.800]  true b-12 the two different types of true one of the type you inject the other is another type
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:10.280]  they fuse together for what we believe is a various person to person is the highest
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:14.520]  absorption rate out there sublingually or lingually under the tongue around the tongue
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:19.240]  you you're not i mean others maybe maybe nine percent ten percent absorption with synthetics
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:23.960]  and you can't even use it with this we believe and he's going to do this as high as 70 percent
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:29.560]  but the point is is that this is as close to injectable as you're going to get i mean is that
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:34.840]  accurate in layman's terms a doctor edward group who joined us one of the top supplement
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:38.440]  formulators and pseudocal formulators in the country who were so honored to have developing
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:43.000]  our line and infowarslife.com with other doctors and pharmacists and people that we also consult with
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.560]  and chemist why is secret 12 so special i've been on it for months since we finally got the
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:55.000]  the final formula prepared and again it is just all part of my regimen where i mixed the super
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.720]  male vitality the secret 12 and other things together and take it it is simply amazing when i
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:08.760]  don't take it three times a day i really feel it. First of all i'm a vegan so there's a lot of
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:14.040]  information out there saying vegetarians vegans are deficient in b12 so it kind of put me on a
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:21.400]  research task or study about two years ago really getting into what's going on with b12 is that
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:26.360]  something that only vegetarians are deficient in or is that something that everybody's deficient in
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:31.880]  and one thing led to another you know i'm not the type of guy who likes to have or prescribe
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:37.880]  people 30 or 40 different supplements out there but as my research continued on b12 i
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:43.240]  started under uncovering things and uncovering more things and uncovering more things and and it
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:50.120]  led to kind of like the iodine conspiracy where i believe that everybody's is deficient in b12
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:55.880]  most people think you get b12 from meat but you don't get b12 from meat b12 it actually comes from
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:03.560]  probiotics in the soil and in order for b12 to be produced you need cobalt in the soil well because
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:09.160]  of all the pesticides and everything else that's been sprayed on the soil 60 of the world's soil
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:16.200]  is now deficient in cobalt so looking at that and then looking at all the different things that can
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:21.560]  affect b12 absorption in the body is what i did i said okay so if there's something really going
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:27.480]  on with b12 what could it be how do how does gmo's affect b12 absorption in the body sure enough
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:32.120]  gmo's the bt toxin burned through the parietal cells in the stomach just saw a study last week
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.520]  that glyphosates block it glyphosates block it that's one of the other things so then i started
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:41.240]  going down the list fluoride all of the things that they know what they're doing they're targeting
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:46.040]  us they know what they're doing it's a chemical war i mean it is amazing that how all these things
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:52.120]  affect really how what happens is b12 comes into the mouth and it mixes in with your saliva you
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:58.600]  have enzymes in your mouth that actually bond and hold on to it so it's protected through the gastric
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:04.360]  hydrochloric acid levels in your stomach and your parietal cells in your stomach secrete what's
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:10.600]  called intrinsic factor intrinsic factors i'm going to skip this one break go intrinsic factor
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:16.920]  then when it goes into the duodenum or the small intestine bonds to the b12 so if you look at it
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:24.200]  what i did was put all the pieces together and found out that any damage to the parietal cells
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:30.840]  in the stomach is going to reduce or stop the amount of intrinsic factor being released which
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:36.680]  ultimately means no b12 absorption what affects the parietal cells exactly what we're talking about
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:43.320]  high fructose corn syrup heavy metals gmo's gluten all the people that eat weed out there that
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:47.880]  affects your parietal cells in your stomach so as i was continually doing this research i was saying
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:56.040]  to myself oh my gosh i mean this is a serious condition symptoms of b12 deficiency are fatigue
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:03.240]  neurological problems shrinkage of the brain b12 is required for your proper blood cell development
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:08.840]  which means lack of oxygen carrying capacity in the body which means lack of oxygen in the body
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:15.240]  lack of oxygen in the muscles muscle twitching uh vibratory senses i don't know if the camera
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:23.880]  can pick up how beautiful this is but i have seen the medical grade uh non-synthetic high quality b12
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:27.000]  because i have some friends that prescriptions for it quite frankly i was thinking about going to
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.200]  the doctor and getting a prescription because people tell me it's had such a big effect on them
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:35.480]  taking it especially in the winter but this is the same color it looks the same and then water
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:41.320]  does the same thing as the injectable because it is molecule for molecule the same thing i mean look
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:47.800]  at that just a few drops and it's that beautiful uh purple pink just like the iodine what is it
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:54.760]  about stuff that's so good for you has a purple pink color i don't know the standard type of b12
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:21:01.000]  that's available is cyanocobalamin and it's actually cobalamin that's why you get cobalt in
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:08.520]  the soil cobalamin bonded to a cyanide molecule cyanide is poison so cyanocobalamin is what's
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:13.560]  in the majority of the dietary supplements out there and it's in the majority of the injections
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:18.440]  that they give you in the hospital they give you injections because they know most people
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:23.640]  that are b12 deficient are not going to get it through the mouth they can't process the intrinsic
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:29.640]  factor properly they can't absorb it properly b12 is absorbed into your body in the terminal
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:33.960]  ilium right there where your small intestine meets the large intestine right there where your appendix
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:41.800]  is an interesting story that came out years ago by the hypocrite's institute dr bryan clement who
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:48.040]  went to harvard medical library and went to new york medical library and pulled up pictures of
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:55.960]  intestinal linings that were drawn dating back to the 17th century showed a little pocket almost
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:03.240]  looked like a boot right there where the appendix was and years and years and years ago they stated
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:09.240]  that that's where the vitamin b was stored it was like a little organic organ and now they're
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:13.880]  saying that that pocket has shrunk and shrunk and shrunk and it's turned into the appendix
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:20.600]  it's an interesting theory there there's no proof behind that but in order for you to get the proper
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:26.760]  absorbable kind of b12 you're going to need methylcobalamin which is actually a coenzyme of b12
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:31.080]  let's explain why this has two different types in it yes there's two different coenzymes that
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:37.240]  are usable in the body which is methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin also known as dibencoside
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:43.480]  those are the two coenzyme factors methylcobalamin actually breaks down into adenosylcobalamin
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:49.560]  okay well i mean here's the deal i've been on road trips and gone ahead and done like a energy
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:55.560]  drink or those little energy shots it gives you a high you feel horrible four hours later
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:00.920]  there's a hangover i take this when it first came in actually about six months ago one of
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:05.400]  the earlier formulations in four months ago the final one and you sent us about a hundred bottles
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:11.560]  and everybody just started fighting over them because people immediately felt this now this is
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:16.120]  more important than my coffee in the morning why is this so good compared to other vitamin b12 i've
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:22.600]  taken i think 99 of the population is deficient in b12 i think everybody needs b12 even children
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:27.480]  need b12 you don't need a lot it's only micrograms but the reason why that's so effective is because
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:33.800]  it's the coenzyme usable forms in the body it's in a vegetable glycerin base so you can hold it in
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:40.280]  your mouth it goes sublingually directly into your not synthetic it's not synthetic it's vegan
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:46.680]  safe actually too because it's cultured from bacterial cells and it goes straight into your
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:51.720]  body and it's in the two usable forms i mean methylcobalamin is expensive in itself but to
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:58.360]  put the adenosylcobalamin in there that's $14,000 a kilogram so what we're trying to do is get
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:03.720]  everybody the usable amount of b12 the point is this is a Rolls Royce neutral medical level
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.480]  there's only a few other brands that are similar they're like a hundred dollars
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:11.240]  i mean explain to people why this is different do you go to the store and buy synthetic b12
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:14.840]  you know for $10 for a big bottle of it and from what i've read what you see it just does
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:19.400]  nothing basically right no it doesn't it doesn't do anything b12 is stored in your liver and so
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:24.040]  what we want to do is put together it's a processing technique too that we have that nobody else has
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:29.880]  it's a cold processing technique because most of the b12 is manufactured out there goes through
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:35.720]  a heating process i don't understand why because b12 is denatured that's why every time you cook
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:43.560]  your food meat or whatever 89 percent of the b12 is deactivated in your system microwaving food
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:50.040]  completely almost 100 wipes out the b12 that's why i say everybody is deficient in b12 this
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:55.640]  is a particular cold processing technique that we use where we mix the two forms of b12 together
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:02.200]  it almost the vegetable glycerin almost creates a capsule around it so it bonds with the that is
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:06.280]  the most beautiful color what do you call that color i don't know the camera can pick that up
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:11.640]  it's kind of like a fuchsia or something like a pinkish red fuchsia color are they both that
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.080]  color when you mix them or are they different they are they are that color and the adenosyl
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:19.640]  cobalamin is almost the crystalline structure like the iodine is we'll have to get some video
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:26.040]  footage of that for you too so we can show all the viewers but it's an amazingly pure substance the
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:31.080]  crystals and the methylcobalamin all the care is taking to make sure that it's not heated
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:36.600]  we put it into the bottle by the way the reason i work with you dr group is you are so obsessed
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:43.240]  with the absolute highest quality double triple tested just neurotic level which i love because
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:46.920]  the other companies and i'm not just saying this is i've gotten deep into this a lot of them out
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:51.640]  there just don't care and just throw crud out that's why i mean i work with young jeffrey because
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:58.200]  they have such high quality but you just go to such a level that that's why half the time we
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:02.520]  don't even have product is because you're trying to source it and just go sorry i can't get a totally
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:08.600]  organic 100 california certified super grade you know super totally undetectable so we just
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:12.040]  either take the ingredient out or you're not you know we're not going to do it and and i mean
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:17.560]  or or i've got to get the you know dea approval for this deep crystal source wait you know it took
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:25.080]  you years to get that i mean you are just a trailblazer that's right i when i do a product i want to
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:29.320]  make sure it's the best in the world and i take a lot of time to do it took two years to do the
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:35.400]  research on the b12 and to find the proper ratio and the way to put it together properly that's
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.400]  you know i sense you samples you were taking it on the air that was the secret red liquid you
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:45.960]  were that everybody was saying what are you taking uh finally today it's launched after all that
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:52.760]  research and all that time period uh it took to put that together one of the things uh that people
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:57.480]  need to understand is that if you're diabetic if you have heart disease if you have medications
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:03.960]  i did this i was looking at the what blocks the absorption of b12 and most medications
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:10.760]  block the absorption of b12 if you're on birth control pills you're going to have a b12 deficiency
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:16.920]  it's amazing of all of the chemicals out there and food products that block b12 that's why they spray
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:22.840]  b12 on cereals and the reason why they say eat meat products and dairy that's a big myth about
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:29.480]  the vegetarians or deficient in b12 because what do you think the animals have high levels of b12
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:34.360]  because they eat grass and they get it from the soil that's why they have high it's the cobalt
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:40.920]  well it's the cobalt in the soil so what this is is a bioavailable form a cobalt molecule derivative
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:50.440]  yes this is as a matter of fact whenever they first found b12 it was a probiotic but they
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:54.680]  hadn't even classified probiotics back then so they didn't know what to do with this chemical
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.920]  compound so they said let's stick it it was kind of close to b vitamin so they said let's stick it
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:03.160]  in the b vitamin that's right always hear about how deer have really high b12 and they're not eating
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:07.800]  meat they're eating grass they eat grass that's why the animals and chickens and they're grass fed
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:12.360]  i mean if you're going to eat meat and i'm not out there telling everybody to be a vegan or a
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:17.000]  vegetarian i mean that's you know your own yeah knock it off you need to take care here i'm just
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:23.880]  joking i'm joking but uh but it might help for a little while anyway it just make sure you're
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:28.920]  eating organic range-fed wild game stuff like that where they're out there eating the soil
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:34.920]  and the grass and you know they get dirt in into their body too and that's how they get high b12
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:40.360]  levels and that's how you get it but the thing is what i found in the last two years of research
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:45.000]  is you might think you're getting b12 from the animal products but you're really not and the
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.520]  reason why is it's not that it's not there the reason is you're also eating gluten and you're
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:56.680]  also eating by the way alcohol too causes damage to the parietal cells and so does coffee excessive
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:02.760]  coffee use so how many people out there do you know that drink uh coffee energy drinks caffeine and
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:07.240]  then meanwhile it's depleting you meanwhile the soils are depleted of all this other stuff
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:12.600]  that's why they have this rda that's so low well obviously you need way more of it because it's
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:18.120]  being depleted but i want to congratulate you as best you can tell this proprietary formulation
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:22.680]  uh and i see all your tufts university studies found 39 percent of all people are
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:27.480]  deficient in b12 you think it's 90 percent i mean i want to congratulate you on the fact
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:31.720]  that you've really created something original here thanks i appreciate it i mean i it's just one
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:36.120]  other thing that we could give to people to help them become healthier and healthier and healthier
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:41.640]  well folks it's available and it's very affordable at info wars lives dot com and it will sell out

[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:30.040]  it's alex jones all right we're gonna get out of the plugging of secret 12 here in a moment but
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:35.480]  i wanted dr group to specifically talk about this proprietary product you develop for info wars life
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:41.800]  dot com uh we are trying to produce more right now we've actually had some in for a few weeks
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:49.560]  but i was trying to build uh some up so that we wouldn't just immediately sell out of it
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:55.080]  uh because it is frustrating you know his his laboratory is pretty big but it's producing a
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:34:00.040]  lot of stuff and you know it's it's it's he will sell no wine until it's time as
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:08.120]  orson wells once said but if you want to get the secret 12 i'd love to hear your take on it
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:15.000]  it's 29 dollars which for this super expensive proprietary uh ingredients that go into it to
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.600]  give you an example we could buy it from big manufacturers that are well known supposedly
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:23.560]  organic and it would be a bottle of like 50 for two dollars and then we would sell it for 20
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:29.320]  dollars that's what the industry does instead you know we put 10 dollars into a bottle basically
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:33.320]  and then sell it make 20 to fund the operation because they're still markup they're big time
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:38.440]  but the average markup in the industry seven times we do it once or twice or 150 percent
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:45.640]  and again uh you're not going to find anything like secret 12 out there period uh i mean there
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:49.240]  may be some nutraceuticals i don't know about why is this so different explain that to people
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:54.760]  i don't want to shift gears into other health news well it's so special because everybody
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:35:00.600]  needs it i mean if anyone's if anyone has fatigue if anyone has mood swings if anyone has
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:06.920]  neurological conditions the problem with b12 is it's never looked at by doctors it's a vitamin
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:10.760]  deficiency so of course doctors are never going to well just like if you have scurvy they don't
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:14.840]  diagnose scurvy they don't know scurvy's all over the place with people that eat fast food diets
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:22.040]  right right i mean tea's falling out sores all over you zits all over you you got the scurvy
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:27.800]  they won't tell you an orange with carrot anxiety and depression you know how big anxiety and
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:33.000]  depression is anxiety and depression are specifically linked to b12 deficiency you can link it to
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:41.560]  autism add adhd you can look cold hands and feet tingling nerve sensations uh you know brain
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:45.480]  on this development it can be linked to all kinds of things just take the oxygen carrying
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:51.000]  capacity out of the blood and that's going to cause all kinds of problems in itself but what
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:57.640]  makes this so special is the fact that from start to finish the product is not irradiated
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:02.600]  which most manufacturing facilities out there irradiate their their products it's pretty
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:08.520]  much handmade it's all done in borosilicate glass mixing vessels all the other manufacturing
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:14.280]  facilities out there they all use stainless steel aluminum based mixing vessels the difference
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:19.480]  between using glass lined vessels or all glass lined vessels is tremendous i mean we've had to
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:25.080]  actually get some of our vessels custom made just so we can do this to where these compounds are
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:30.920]  never in contact with any metal a lot of times metal will deactivate the energy signatures or
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:37.480]  um you know the metal can heat up in certain cases it's just not good to touch nutritional supplements
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:43.480]  against metal as much as you can it to prevent it that's the best way to do it so we looked
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:49.720]  all over the globe and tried to find the highest quality purist source of methylcobalamin you can
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:37:03.000]  buy 90 90 percent methylcobalamin 96 99 99.6 99.7 99.8 99.9 percent we always get the 99 percent
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:09.800]  there might be a difference for the 99.6 percent might be 6000 a kilogram 99.9 percent might be
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:18.280]  double that 12 it's hard to get those extra tiny percentages it's like 0.999 silver and 0.999 silver
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:23.960]  so we get the the top quality ingredients come in and spec them and then it goes basically a
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:29.880]  handmade process through our specific cold processing technique to where the methylcobalamin
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:34.040]  gets mixed in with the glycerin then the adenosylcobalamin gets mixed in with the glycerin it's
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:39.000]  all done in like then it gets sent to third party lab testing it does get sent to third party lab
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.360]  testing and then it goes into bottling and then it comes straight to here for the consumer's use so
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:53.400]  I'm just amazed at what I've uncovered with the fact that you know looking at all the way back
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:58.680]  into the soil content and seeing how deficient we are as a nation in b12 and it's just like iodine
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:03.240]  the same thing those are the things that I search for what are the things that we really need in
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:07.720]  the body that all the cells need in the body and what are the things that we're deficient in and
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:12.040]  then try to trace it back to why are we deficient well everybody can see the difference now that I'm
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:16.520]  on this line of supplements you develop for us I mean I still don't look you're super healthy
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:21.160]  and skinny and like you know like you do mr commando but but I mean you see me every to every
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:24.760]  few weeks you go man you're looking better and it's had more energy and I'm still not totally
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:30.520]  taking care of myself barely get sleep sometimes but it's just a world changer the super mill
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:38.840]  vitality the colloidal silver you know all the line of products the oxy powder what it's done
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:44.600]  did you hear about rob do was already in pretty good shape in six seven days he lost 12 pounds of
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:51.000]  scrapping his intestines taking the oxy tablets he took about a third of the bottle and lost 12
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.800]  pounds we have people that call in and say yeah I lost 20 pounds in three days but
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:00.120]  that just goes to show you how much compassion people have in their small intestine in their
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:05.400]  large intestine I wonder you get cancer there's just rotting diverticulitis you know every single
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:10.040]  thing starts in the gut the immune system's in the gut everything's in the gut and what are
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:15.240]  we putting in our body everything that destroys the gut so if you can keep your into somebody
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:19.720]  asked me yesterday what's the one thing somebody can do if they wanted one product or something
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:24.600]  like that I said the best thing you can do is support your gut I mean a lot of times if you
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:30.440]  have a good probiotic balance in your gut those probiotics produce a beef vitamins they produce
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:35.320]  nutrients that you need so it's all about taking care of yourself eating healthy drinking lots
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:41.640]  of water avoiding all the chemicals that are coming into your system and taking responsibility
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:45.720]  for your own health so you can reactivate your body's own self-healing mechanism and that's what
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:50.440]  we're all about and that's what we try to do on a daily basis and what you're doing with everybody
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:54.440]  is trying to really get the word out and provide them with the highest quality supplements in the
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:40:00.200]  world so they can change their health I just read a testimonial that came in on someone sent in a
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:06.200]  few minutes ago back in the other room here where somebody's cat that they were in love with was
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:11.480]  sent home by the veterinarian to die it was a Siamese cat apparently worth tons of money
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:16.440]  and the guy had some x2 some iodine and he said well let me just try this and he put three drops
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:21.720]  in the cat's mouth and within two days the cat was up walking around he wrote thank you Alex thank
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:26.600]  you thank you thank you you saved my my cat and the cat's he's been putting iodine in the cat's
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:32.760]  water and the cat's fine and well I want to be clear about something I've known there's a war on
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:38.680]  our food and war on supplements but I got kind of subconsciously not depressed but resigned
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:42.360]  where I'll just do whatever I want I'll eat whatever I want I'll drink whatever I want
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:48.280]  they're going to get me anyways and I went from working out when I was like 25 almost every day
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:53.240]  and being in great shape to being job of the hut and the first few years is like great I'd eat and
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.760]  drink whatever I want I still look great and all sudden I turned into job of the hut so it's been
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:00.840]  a long process of getting out of that but it's super charged with you the last two and a half
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:04.440]  three years you were advising me even before you know we started launching this together but
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:10.600]  we have to fund ourselves with t-shirts and books and videos that are always about spreading
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:15.720]  the word anything I do has to have a win-win for freedom high quality good-looking shirt you know
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:24.520]  made in America well-priced funding the operation given americans jobs trying to get vets jobs
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:30.440]  because I'm not some goody two shoes I understand the universal law that what I do to people comes
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:35.880]  back on me and people call that God fearing of your christian whatever I feat when I even think
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:41.640]  bad thoughts that aren't even my thoughts it's my brain looking at things from the enemy perspective
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:45.880]  I still feel guilty it's what I call that knowledge of evil that I know how evil works
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:49.960]  that is shameful I mean you see what I'm talking about and so when I get up here and I say
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:55.640]  this is the best product this is the most expensive we could get at the lowest price to you
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:02.120]  I'm shocked to know that 70 percent or so is a is a conservative number of the
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:05.880]  nutraceutical companies out there I'm not knocking competition this is such a growing
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:11.240]  market I don't need to I'm shocked they will go all marketing all packaging all glitz
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:18.440]  all everything and then it's now that I know all about this each crud in the bottle and it makes me
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:25.800]  so angry because as an industry we should be going for the best so people get incredible results
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:31.160]  help people get good karma mojo reput you so whatever you want to call it but it will grow
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:37.000]  the market faster because it'll be so dynamite the results doing the right thing is the right
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.640]  thing to do I just don't understand why people don't get that and it's why it's so good to work
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:47.000]  with you but when I get up here and I say this super b12 secret 12 has you know that's my name
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.640]  for result secret you know what the how you how you make it the proprietary stuff plus I had to
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:55.080]  keep it secret for months but we thought we'd have it four months ago I'm having to keep it
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:58.520]  secret well I've been in here taking it every day when I take the other stuff in front of people
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:03.400]  and you know they're trying to hide what it said on the you know on the handprint and bottle
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:09.160]  so it's just it feels so good to have fair price stuff that funds liberty and freedom to promote
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:14.600]  second amendment property rights sovereignty you know basic dignity and to be able to fund the
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:20.520]  operation and help people and then I can't believe I'm saying this but we don't screen the calls
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:24.200]  callers have heard it and almost gets annoying how many callers off topic or you know thank you
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:30.120]  for the products but I understand we appreciate them but we're on other subjects it just blows me
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:39.400]  away that we haven't had any complaints other than in the bottling once we think it was 20 bottles
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:44.680]  only about 10 of them came back where the the the machine didn't fully fill the bottle
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:49.880]  and we didn't catch it on inspection I mean we've had stuff like that or my bottle got broken inside
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:54.360]  the bubble wrap oh here boom you know here's an extra bottle or here's a free book or something
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:57.480]  because we're all about customer service used to I didn't know how to run customer service
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:02.120]  you know 10 years ago it was terrible we have a first rate group now and it is people really
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:07.640]  take that personal when you're not you don't got your you know what together show I know I'm ranting
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:12.200]  here and we're gonna some other medical news and get off b12 it's just that simple deficiencies
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:17.960]  vitamin c you gotta have true vitamin c you gotta have true b12 you gotta have true nascent iodine
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:21.560]  and then it blew us away when we couldn't even get enough for your iodine we went out to other
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:25.080]  parties and said if they want it we'll get anything alcohol based and we went and looked at it it
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:30.760]  wasn't really even nascent iodine so just sticking sticking iodine in with alcohol regular iodine
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:36.440]  and again that'll help you not be totally sick but we want to just for the same price give you
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:42.520]  something that is just like heads above it I mean it's I had dramatic effects when I started
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:45.880]  taking iodine four years ago that's what helped me start getting all this and when I went into
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:51.240]  your iodine it was just night and day to that that's all I'm saying if you can't afford x2 folks
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:55.800]  go get the sea salts that they have the iodine in them there'll still be some other contaminants
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:59.080]  and things in it but it's better than being deficient you'll die without it you know I mean
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:04.440]  it's real simple this is not rocket science I can't believe it's us telling people you've gotta
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:09.960]  have b12 you've gotta have nascent iodine you've got you've gotta have it what happens if you
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:14.840]  don't have vitamin b12 you die just like iodine and many people have died and many people have been
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:22.920]  misdiagnosed one of the most common misdiagnosis of vitamin b12 deficiency is ms you can have
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:28.440]  Alzheimer's dementia you will literally die waste away and die if you don't have b12 in your system
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:32.680]  Ted Anderson's dad he allows me to tell the story and it's such a horrible story he says I don't care
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:38.440]  tell it they gotta get Ted Anderson in here the Beyond Tanging Tangerine from 4WarsHealth.com
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:42.520]  in Jebedy that's got this central 90 you know they say only need like 60 but really it's 90
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:46.920]  trace elements minerals it's excellent product and they have the 2.0 that's purely organic very
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:51.960]  hard to get that many ingredients and not all organic as you know but his dad has Alzheimer's
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:55.320]  I met his dad for a nice guy they let you go fishing hunting up in Minnesota
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.400]  he went on that for a few months and suddenly knew who he was short-term remember he was back
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:06.280]  they were fishing his dad was back the swords all over his arms scurvy healed they went and
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:09.640]  tested his blood at the doctor and they have him on I guess cumin and never had a stroke or heart
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:14.440]  attack but blood thinner I guess the thing he said and the doctor said whoa you got vitamin k here
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:19.080]  are you eating a lot of spinach what are you doing no I take this Beyond Tanging Tangerine oh my
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:24.360]  gosh you got to go off this and Ted's mom said and his dad went within a month of going off of it
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:28.360]  didn't know who he was again sores came back and he said final honor my parents you just go ahead
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:33.320]  and don't do it but the doctor said you don't take that and you don't eat these leafy vegetables
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:38.040]  because it'll block the cumin in so okay you're not gonna have a heart attack you don't know who you
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:44.280]  are I mean it's just it's crazy that you can't have the vitamins you can't have the minerals
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:49.240]  and it's just simple it's not rocket science it's not I mean you know our water inside of
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:54.680]  our system is just like seawater it's full of minerals and nutrients and if we're not getting
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:59.160]  them in the soil the problem is they're killing off the soil they're poisoning the water they're
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:04.680]  poisoning the air all the things that we need to survive but the good news is there's a solution
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:10.120]  and it's not that hard all you need to take is a good organic multivitamin and mineral formula
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:14.920]  take the nutrients that you're not going to get in your normal diet so beyond taking Tangerine
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:22.120]  secret 12 iodine and any type of herbal formula to assist anything else that you that you need
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:26.280]  help with what about folks that are really poor even though our stuff is fairly priced and very
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.160]  effectively priced reasonably priced you know to be competitive and in high quality
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:36.040]  what can a poor person do to get their essentials obviously eat the orange peel
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:42.680]  um the thing with the thing you know people ask me that question all the time and I always ask
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:47.560]  them you know how many how many pairs of shoes do you buy how many new shirts do you buy what do
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:53.880]  you spend your money on the thing is you can if you change your life how much does being sick
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:48:00.600]  cost you being sick cost people a lot of money it costs their family time suffering depression
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:06.040]  anxiety they go back and forth to the doctor which costs them gas you know if you look at the the
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:12.200]  pricing and the cost of sick care it's a lot more than the pricing and cost of health so what's the
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:16.920]  real I mean there's a lot of game now sold in stores so I guess you can get real game I'll have
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:21.800]  vitamin b12 in it I guess you can get you know from an orange peel or whatever mega dosages or
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:29.080]  rose hips are like super cheap I guess you could get you can go to your local farmers market every
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:33.400]  single town has one or find a farmer that's growing organically what's the best salt to get
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:38.360]  eyed out if you can't afford this Himalayan crystal salt Himalayan crystal salt is what I use it has
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:44.520]  84 minerals and certain nutrients in it and so the poor man's beyond tangy tangerine is Himalayan
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:50.040]  salt yes yes the poor man's tangy tangerine is Himalayan I'll tell you another really really
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:54.120]  good nutrient source that I use and this is all that we're just trying to help people that yeah
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:57.800]  no exactly you can get this for four dollars and pretty much get all the nutrients you need
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:02.440]  is organic raw organic apple cider vinegar go to this oh yeah you got me on that and that's
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:06.840]  what I've been forgetting to take I need to take put a tablespoon or a teaspoon however much you
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:11.160]  could handle in some distilled water that's the best probiotic water and you're going to get all
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:17.400]  kinds of nutrients minerals probiotics in there enzymes in there another big problem is we don't
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:24.120]  secrete enough enzymes in our body to help us digest foods so your food well chew your food
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:27.720]  well that's really important which I tell people all the time chew their food until it's a liquid
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:32.200]  before they swallow it but that always said that chew your food chew your food right exactly I still
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:37.400]  don't like like a wolf well usually people in the military wolf their food down because you only
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:40.920]  have a certain amount of time to eat well I never eat my eating habits when I was in the military
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:45.240]  because they were like you have 10 minutes to eat this and we would be like well it's about to say
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:51.000]  I used to be pretty well behaved my mom was always about be a gentleman have good manners I could go
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.040]  you know eat at the rich people's houses they'd all be impressed now I eat like a barbarian I'm
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:59.480]  trying to train myself again because I got kids so they're not like little pigs you know like the
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:05.160]  pig family I mean that cute way but yeah having to eat like during a couple three minute breaks
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:10.920]  has that's what really screwed my gut up too because I wasn't digesting well I did a report on
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:17.560]  how people eat now nowadays and found out that the majority of people eat in the sympathetic state
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:21.880]  and you have a parasympathetic nervous system and a sympathetic nervous system the sympathetic is
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:26.840]  your fight or flight response when you're in the sympathetic state and that means eating while you're
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:31.400]  driving eating while you're talking on the phone eating while you're watching tv eating while you're
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:36.600]  on the computer at work I have a whole list of all that's why the bible it says I forget the passage
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:41.880]  is you're supposed to sit down pray be calm and take a long time to eat as a family and so what
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:48.200]  happens is your digestion comes to a halt when you're in the sympathetic state and the way we
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:53.240]  eat dinner it was almost like meditation was a big ritual right that ritual is gone they've destroyed
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:51:19.000]  it said you're in front of the television oh my gosh it's such a conspiracy we'll be right back

[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:35.800]  Dallas to investigate Ebola another declared Ebola free we're just gonna have a medical
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:41.880]  doctor on it first with a whistle tomorrow about the intel he's getting from up in Missouri
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:46.280]  and then he's gonna but and then he will write a report tonight or tomorrow that will accompany
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:52.600]  that about what we found in Dallas but they are disappearing people who appear to have Ebola
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:56.920]  Forbes separate from us said yeah the media has agreed that cases that look like it
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:00.840]  are being disappeared we don't talk about it you don't talk about people being disappeared
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:07.240]  this is confirmed by a doctor on record at least two other doctors off record with us who we know
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:15.560]  I mean one of them is big runs a bunch of stuff big hospitals this is freaking me out because
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:21.720]  it's like a Twilight Zone episode the doctor starting to the families are starting to come
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:25.240]  that's what we were meeting with they're freaking out yeah they say yeah my husband's out of Ebola
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:29.800]  people dying on planes vomiting with blood coming out and they go when it lands it wasn't
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:34.440]  Ebola obviously they're covering it up they told the police don't talk about it they don't know
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:38.680]  what's going on they just say if it looks like it shut up but that's illegal to disappear people
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:43.720]  and not be honest about it so see this was hurting Obama he wants to leave the borders open so now
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:49.000]  they're just gonna deny it's out there I'm surprised that it didn't spread a little bit more they
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:54.760]  didn't do something to create a little bit more panic I think when when the panic got when they
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:57.720]  were getting the blame they thought they would just have Ebola here no one would go otherwise the
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:02.760]  border open when we made it political they had to back off mm-hmm when drudged it because remember
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:05.800]  they had all their pundits attacked drudged stop saying it's going to spread and it started
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:10.680]  spreading oh really well now it's not spreading well there's definitely a reason behind it you
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:15.480]  know that's yet to be determined but if you look at all the research that we've been talking about
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:20.920]  on past shows and everything you've been uncovering about the CDC owning the patent I mean there's no
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:26.520]  reason why if you link everything together with them owning the patent with them you know verifying
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:33.400]  Arabies Ebola vaccine back in the night in the 90s all the hermetically sealed coffins that they
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:38.280]  have stored away all the FEMA camps that have been put together that have been verified I think
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:42.520]  it's what Obama said it's a test run all the underground facilities that are pretty much
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:47.880]  complete right now so I mean it yeah exactly he came on said it was a test run they put everything
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:53.320]  out there and they're test running to see if they can control the media when there's an
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:57.640]  outbreak and cover it up that is creepy because to me it's not even a bully issue I'm going to
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:02.440]  say it again we have doctors naming themselves we have Forbes confirming what we said they're in
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:07.240]  the meeting the media is agreeing to not talk about it and cover it up boom it's done I mean
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:12.040]  there's something going on here the thing is if for some people that actually massive children
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:16.760]  to the alternative media they know I mean we've been you've been covering all this for a long
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:21.320]  period of time so they they should know what to do and they shouldn't be prepared and have everything
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:27.560]  that they need just in case or when it does happen because they obviously wanted to test
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:32.280]  everybody out and see how everybody reacted to this and they did create a lot of fear I know my
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:36.040]  phones were ringing off the hook saying what can we take what you know how can we protect ourselves
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:41.320]  so I think that they accomplish what they wanted to accomplish and found out how the world would
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:46.840]  react now it's just a matter of time I think that you know we know for a fact that we they have
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:52.040]  stored up biological weapons that could be used at any any time they can be mixed in with the
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:58.360]  chemtrails and sprayed on us so now it's just a matter of time before something like that happens
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:02.680]  but we're already being hit by the soft kill garbage so we don't know what got us
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:08.440]  it's just a cocktail of testing and manipulation well we're going to continue to follow this we've
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:12.680]  got a bunch of big guests on tomorrow we've got Clive and Bundy they've been getting harassed
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:18.200]  put on terrorist lists and stuff but you know Harry Reid the repudiation of him I think is
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:23.240]  going to the real terrorists the constitution is that's coming up we have the director of the new
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:28.360]  Nicki Minaj video they're trying to censor coming on as well talk about first amendment issues but

[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:57.480]  news or the morning shows on cbs abc and machine almost all of that is an infomercial
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:01.240]  product placement when they're reviewing a movie or reviewing a product or
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:06.920]  reviewing a book it's an imprint of news corps when we're openly selling something to you we just

[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:22.840]  infowarsstore.com and i'm not going to belabor this anymore but secret 12 really is do you believe
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:27.160]  from your research putting this out this is the best vitamin b12 supplement out there no doubt
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:31.080]  i don't put out anything that's not the best and that's that's just the way we are what should
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:36.200]  the headline on this interview be then when we put it on youtube uh you know you will die without
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:43.560]  b12 well that's true you will i mean i don't know whatever the best headline would be something about
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:48.760]  not knowing this good body needs b12 whether you think so or your doctor doesn't even know you need
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:54.600]  b12 but how about the b12 conspiracy the b12 conspiracy there's definitely a lot that goes
[02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:59.080]  on as a matter of fact make that you know they just the the supplier of potatoes that supplies
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:06.760]  mcdonald's for their french fries uh they the the usda and the fda just approved the new gmo
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:11.640]  potato for the supplier so pretty soon all of the mcdonald's french fries are going to be with the
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:15.560]  new and by the way they had top scientists come out and say that potato is dangerous that potato
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:20.360]  is seriously dangerous and they also just approved in a form of alfalfa too a gmo form of alfalfa so
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:29.480]  you know but the good thing is at least people are stepping up i mean right now um again monsanto
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:35.000]  they wrote an article about me the other day about how much i was a quack and uh the organ vote that's
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:40.600]  going on right now monsanto run article about you yeah they did on one of their farm uh blogs
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:47.320]  yeah just the other day yeah well that's like uh satan you know saying that uh the the apostle
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:53.400]  paul's a bad guy i mean monsanto's got about the lowest rating out there yeah i know it's uh i mean
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:57.960]  you are a good monsanto's like the devil i mean dating back to age and orange and now that you know
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:03.720]  all the dioxins dioxins that are killing the soil it really all goes back to the soil somebody asked
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:10.200]  me well how come there's some uh areas like the hunza people and some people that live in
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:15.640]  the mountains that aren't deficient of everything and they're still exposed to toxic air and water
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:20.040]  i said because everything comes back to the soil what they do is they take care of their soil they
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:25.960]  use their own urine to fertilize the soil there's some cultures in ciberia that soak the seeds in
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:31.080]  their mouth and the seeds literally read what their body is deficient of and they plant them
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:36.760]  that's verified it's in in ciberia they these cultures they're really tight knit they use
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:42.040]  all their feces everything goes back into the soil to build the soil and this as long as the
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:48.920]  soil is healthy and the soil is mineralized the plants will grow what you need to survive see
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:54.440]  that's the problem we've gone from community growing and and and everybody working together
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:04:00.120]  and using the recycling everything whether it's your urine or your feces or whatever recycling
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:07.160]  it into the soil to spraying chemicals the agricultural uh society is just as bad as the

[02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:37.880]  want to call it in the world nicky manage even i know who she is and i don't really follow pop
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:42.920]  culture very much as you know when it comes to entertainment though i should because that's
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:49.720]  where the real cultural battle is going on yes info wars dot com and the nightly news and the
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:55.400]  syndicated radio show has a much larger audience now than cnn does it's being dumped from different
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:09:01.960]  cable networks and satellite networks here in the us and worldwide but we're not winning the war
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:07.880]  overall when it comes to hollywood when it comes to music when it comes to the general culture
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:13.480]  that's where the real news and the real programming is going on but we are starting to see more and
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:17.800]  more positive messages come out of hollywood and i've talked to some of the directors and people
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:24.120]  like mark cuban who understand that we have a tyranny on our hands in fact mark cuban just
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:30.040]  came out the articles on info wars dot com mark cuban says feds will f up the internet
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:35.560]  i'm more concerned the government will f it up he says and then he goes on to break down
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:43.480]  that it's basically obama care like ted cruz said uh for the internet but i'm shifting years now
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:51.960]  now to that culture war in this interview uh nicky menage uh put out a hit video a song
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:56.920]  yesterday music video the last time i checked it said like five million views to probably get
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:02.520]  a hundred million views at the current rate just as one video has billboard and others
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:09.400]  have this headline exclusive nicky menage's only director says neither i nor the video
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:15.720]  are anti-semitic and we have the director joining us to talk about this but earlier when i got into
[02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:20.360]  this i was very offended that there are people calling for the video to be taken down groups
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:24.760]  calling for it to be censored because even if i disagreed with it i would still say it has the
[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:30.120]  right to be out there even if it was a nazi video it's obviously the opposite when you listen to
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:35.400]  the words and the rest of it showing this is the culture we've become just like charlie chaplin
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:42.520]  back in 1940 with the great dictator dressed up like hitler to make fun of him it wasn't a pro hitler
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:49.800]  film but people knew that back then people understood that he wasn't being pro hitler when
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:54.600]  he dressed up like hitler and pretended to be him he was making fun of him and drawing attention to
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:11:02.520]  it so if you're going to say that nicky menage or her director jeff osborne who's a award-winning
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:07.160]  director cinematographer and editor working with top names across the board very excited to have
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:14.120]  him on his website is jeffrey m osborne dot com and he is a listener and we appreciate him coming
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:20.680]  on the broadcast congratulations it's a powerful music video and so i'm not surprised that folks
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:25.240]  are calling for it to be censored i guess you're supposed to you know only stay in a very narrow
[02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:32.440]  confine when it comes to pop music and not try to get outside those lines absolutely i mean
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:38.120]  it was it was pretty interesting to me because i actually left the country a couple days before
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:43.320]  the video released so this sort of all came to me through the internet and i wasn't expecting
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:50.120]  this type of reaction because this type of imagery is all over the place um but you know i you know
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:54.200]  i don't know what it specifically was whether it was just too straightforward or something like that
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:12:00.440]  but um you know i was getting hate mail tweets and this and that and you know just because someone
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:04.120]  does that i'm not i'm not going to back down to what you know what i believe in and and also
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:08.920]  i'm not anti-semitic so well i like your quote you said sorry i'm not going to say i'm sorry
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:16.920]  absolutely um i mean i you know the point of the video is actually quite the opposite to show how
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:22.920]  totalitarian is very much alive today um and exists i mean right in front of our eyes even
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:27.880]  though a lot of people can't see that but um i think a lot of people are just missing the point
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:32.440]  and then plus the way the media interprets it and then takes certain parts of my quotes
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:37.720]  and highlights them half of them didn't even spell my name right um so you can just tell that
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:43.320]  the media is sort of just it's just become very fast lax integrity and it's just really jumping
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:51.080]  on something to cause a stir uh rather than tell the truth i guess that's right it's a total knee
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:58.840]  jerk reaction absolutely now i've seen several names of the video uh what's its true title
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:06.360]  only only and folks can find that on youtube nicky minaj only we have it on screen for tv
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:10.200]  viewers but radio listeners now there is some parental uh you know advice here there is some
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:15.400]  profanity in it uh but but it's the imagery let's walk through the imagery for radio listeners
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:23.960]  who can't see us right now of what shook people up so much describe for people uh you know how you
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:30.760]  came up with this uh the animation absolutely um well i i designed the four characters sort as
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:36.520]  sort of as uh the main pieces of the puzzle in order to create totalitarianism which is
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:44.680]  you know a dictator uh religious themes economic themes political themes all tied together
[02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:50.200]  to sort of control your mind into believing one thing um which is something that the nazis did
[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:55.080]  very well and is very much alive today so that's why i was trying to draw those two parallels between
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:14:03.960]  past and future but i think people missed that connection well jeff watching it i mean the imagery
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:11.560]  is very scary it is powerful but i think it struck a nerve because people realize this is
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:20.520]  the type of culture that we are devolving into militaristic uh regimented highly controlled
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:26.280]  i'm just shocked that there were so many calls to censor the video and take it down that pretty
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:33.080]  much proves the point of the fascism absolutely and and you know i at the same time you know it
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:37.560]  on one level it hurts to see people from the holocaust and this and that reaching out but
[02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:44.360]  at the same time i can't be sorry for a misinterpretation um you know i have the utmost respect for
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:49.720]  people that that fought in the war i have the utmost respect for people that were in and lived
[02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:56.200]  through the holocaust i visited the holocaust museum in dc as a child i know very i'm very much
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:01.160]  aware of what that was like so it has nothing to do with being ignorant to the past or anything
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:06.360]  like that but i made the video as a statement because it should be scary because i'm also
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:14.360]  that scared of of what our future holds um based on the way people react to media like this and
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:21.080]  other things well and i wouldn't call it just purely nazi or fascist it has some soviet style
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:28.360]  iconography some occultic i mean i think you're just saying we have an evil overarching program
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:34.920]  and and we need to talk about it and discuss it and i think because you point that out to people
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:40.920]  uh they want to take it down because it scares them absolutely i mean art art is made to to have
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:46.920]  discussions i mean if there's no if there isn't any passion or any discussion involved after a
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:52.360]  piece of art then why is it really there in my opinion what what are the artists i mean obviously
[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:57.320]  you work some with nikki minaj on coming up with this uh what's their view on the controversy
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:02.600]  um to to be honest i really don't know because we we never really sat in the same room it's just
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:08.120]  we we passed the video onwards and and they gave me what they needed and you know i i applied what
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:12.920]  they needed and then i added my own artistic voice to that so to be honest i can't really
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:18.440]  speak on their behalf because i don't know but they obviously liked it because they green lighted it
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:23.240]  absolutely i mean i you know again i can't speak for them but i think chances are they at least
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:28.040]  maybe they didn't see the full message of of what i was trying to get across but i think they at least
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:34.680]  i think they at least saw past the fact of it representing them as nazis i mean obviously
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:41.560]  that's why they released it so well i see a quote here um i think from you in billboard it says
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:46.440]  the uh young money team came to me where they set a parameters in which they exactly stated
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:54.040]  something black and white dark ominous with hints of imagery like sin city or metropolis exactly
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:17:00.920]  or metropolis i mean that's exactly what you did uh is a high tech nazi germany style system
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:06.520]  but when you look at it it looks like our military uniforms it looks like our tanks it mixes in a
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:11.560]  cultic iconography and i think people don't like the fact that's happening absolutely chris browns
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:16.520]  uniform is actually designed directly off of us general uh the building in the middle is the
[02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:24.360]  lincoln memorial um you know the planes are f-22s uh security cameras didn't exist at least in that
[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:30.040]  form in the 1930s so i've drawn a variety of different time periods i mean at the end of the
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:37.640]  day i'm representing them as a generic totalitarian regime uh which takes different facets of every
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:42.920]  country in time period into one um and i and i'm presenting it that way so i think that
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:49.320]  sure i think people you know just misunderstood and got bent out of shape as a result well you're
[02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:55.000]  right i mean it's crystal clear now they're wanting to censor feminist groups the princess lia cat
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:00.040]  calling parody video and even if you don't agree with cat calling people have a right to do it and
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:05.720]  people have a right to make videos about it and just this this culture of shut it down turn it off
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:12.200]  don't let them say that is really very anti-american i think and and he's actually you know i keep
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:17.720]  saying it it proves the fascism that you're warning about absolutely and i mean and i
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:22.040]  think the media is also part of that problem because they just take they take something and
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:28.440]  they try to spin it to to to cause you know backlash and basically separate people and
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:33.160]  cause misunderstanding i mean that you can just see from all the articles how certain ones would
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:40.040]  only pick certain parts of my quote for the shock value um not to try to clarify or really help
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:44.600]  people understand maybe they didn't understand or whatever i can't speak for everyone but sure um i
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:52.200]  think just the the media plays a very detrimental role i think uh especially today well it's it's
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:57.560]  divide and conquer instead of dealing with real racism real classism big mega banks getting trillions
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:02.840]  and mega bailouts and and and being taxed exempt they want us thinking everything's racist or
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:07.560]  everything's bad so we just sit down and shut up so we don't get accused of something while they
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:12.280]  steal all of our freedoms collectively and then anybody could look at your video and see that
[02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:19.000]  you're saying america is turning into nazi germany meets metropolis and before i even talked to your
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:24.520]  senior quotes that was self-evident and i just don't see how people can then say this is what
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:31.400]  you're doing uh it it's an agenda to shut up artists as long as you were on air pushing
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:37.320]  gangster rap shoot up the cops you know race war garbage why you'd be just fine if you were you know
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:44.200]  making a video about slinging crack they don't want hip-hop to get hardcore political like carus one
[02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:49.560]  professor griff paris and so many others have done because hip-hop dominates the world now
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:55.800]  and if it ever gets really awake that's it for the new world order and their big weapon may backfire
[02:19:55.800 --> 02:20:01.400]  director stay right there i want to hear more from you straight ahead this is sharon hunt before

[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:27.480]  I agree with most of what he has to say he's a great guy he shouldn't be slapped down when he
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:34.920]  criticizes the government or when he promotes the second amendment so you can say whatever
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:40.600]  you want just don't try to take my right to speak away Jeffrey Osborne award-winning director
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:48.440]  cinematographer editor JeffreyMOsborne.com he's been criticized all over tv all over billboard
[02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:55.080]  all over hundreds of publications to try to intimidate artists everywhere to not point out
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:25:01.080]  that our country in many respects has surpassed many other totalitarian regimes throughout history
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:07.080]  whether it's the NSA spying or the amount of people in prison or the phony drug war
[02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:13.160]  or tasering deaths or homeless getting shot and killed and the paramilitarization of police
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:18.440]  everybody knows this country's converting to a serious tyranny and so he puts a video out
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:25.160]  without nazi symbols or anything but just fascist iconography kind of soviet too and they freak
[02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:29.960]  out he joins us now i want to get him back on next week in the aftermath of all this i think
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:34.440]  their attempted censorship will just backfire what do you think mr osborne and what are other
[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:41.080]  points you'd like to make i think the video is still up so i think it's there to stay um you
[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:45.400]  know i who knows whether it'll be taken down in the future or not but it's here to stay and i think
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:51.320]  that if everything has led to this and me being on the show then i think i've succeeded well brother
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:54.920]  coming on here is not that big a deal we just appreciate what you're doing you were telling
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:59.960]  the crew that you are a listener yes i am i actually think it's pretty surreal that i'm on
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:06.360]  this show right now speaking to you because uh man it's you are my hero seriously well you're
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:11.000]  awesome brother but the grass is always greener on the other side you are my hero i mean you're
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:16.040]  going out there and and and trying to wake people up some people aren't going to understand it some
[02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:20.600]  people are going to get mad at you maybe because they don't like uh you know the artist you work
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:25.640]  for or something but but i mean it's clear that your heart was pure in this and it just shows how
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:31.240]  screwed up we've gotten that they're trying to censor it i mean it's really creepy yeah absolutely
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:37.800]  i mean i i knew that i had an outlet that would reach millions of people um and may or may not
[02:26:37.800 --> 02:26:44.200]  you know cause a stir or at least cause a conversation um and you know it it did just that
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:49.880]  um you know i don't i don't want to say that i'm happy people are outraged but it's at least
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:54.360]  raised bigger discussions because i've i've even seen on threads and this and that that these
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:59.720]  conversations have to sort of expanded into what i've said is about our first amendment rights and
[02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:04.840]  censorship and big brother and all this so some people get it and it's starting those bigger
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:11.960]  conversations which is exactly what my intention was well that's right and look i've done like
[02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:16.760]  pierce Morgan interviews and bbc interviews a lot of others where i genuinely get mad and
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:21.320]  yell at them and just kind of break the silence don't play along and at first everybody says oh
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:25.800]  you're in a lot of trouble you're discredited but then six months later they love you two years later
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:29.880]  it's just the best thing they ever saw in their life and alex jones destroyed pears morgan it was
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:34.600]  the end of his career you know are the headlines so it's the fact that you got that response
[02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:38.840]  shows that you're waking people out of their trance and that's why they're upset
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:44.920]  is because deep down they know you're right so great job well thank you and i hope so i hope so so
[02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:51.240]  any other points you'd like to add um absolutely i mean you know just a side note i'm
[02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:55.240]  actually in Panama right now i know i'd say that i was out of the country but uh right now i'm working
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:59.400]  on a project about the illegal invasion of Panama and everything that went with it and i've been
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:04.840]  getting interviews uh from all different types of people down here and it's a very exciting story
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:09.960]  and i'm excited to make it into a film well i'm sure you've seen the Panama deception then
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:14.200]  oh i absolutely have i actually had to buy the dvd directly from barba trend because it's not for
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:20.680]  sale uh in stores it was kind of shelved after she won the academy award so that's right wow we
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:24.840]  ought to have you i'd love to get her on with you when your film comes out because for folks that
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:30.680]  don't know that was a total false flag there were no kidnapped students it was all made up and they
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:35.800]  just mass murdered a bunch of people i mean i'm sorry that was a criminal attack absolutely i mean
[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:41.640]  they lied about the number of dead um even the un i mean voted i believe it was 72 to 20 that it was
[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:47.640]  a flagrant uh violation of international law but of course the us can just come in and veto it so
[02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:51.880]  and again it's not that Manuel noriega is a saint kind of like ricky ross though he was their drug
[02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:57.240]  dealer in the whole aran contra deal he threatened to go public and they said no you won't and instead
[02:28:57.240 --> 02:29:04.200]  of the mafia doing a hit the u.s army was the hit exactly um i think that you know once he was tired
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:10.440]  of being you know used and this and that you know he he really wanted to do what was best for his
[02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:16.600]  country and as soon as he had a conscious we saw what happened so wow do we know the name of the
[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:23.240]  new film yet uh there is no name yet it's still in development uh but it's it's developing rapidly
[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:27.640]  well you're an interesting fellow and congratulations on all your work we'd love to get you back on

[02:33:34.440 --> 02:33:41.480]  well you remember a few months ago back during the whole clive and bundy situation in nevada
[02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:46.600]  harry reid came out and said that these people aren't patriots they're domestic terrorists
[02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:51.080]  you got the feds aiming guns at people saying nowhere in the county basically
[02:33:52.360 --> 02:33:55.800]  without permission could they hold a sign up they said you have a free speech down
[02:33:55.800 --> 02:34:00.680]  in the middle of a desert one little pin there's no media and then they beat up folks and had
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:07.480]  attack dogs go after them and so thousands showed up and a few people aimed guns at the cops because
[02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:13.400]  they were aiming guns at them the feds and i wouldn't have aimed guns at the cops at the feds
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:18.120]  i think that escalates things but only a few people out of 2000 did that and they might have
[02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:22.440]  been plants probably were the feds were aiming guns the whole time first though saying if you
[02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:30.040]  cross that line we will shoot you and david night and josh owens deserve medals they marched to get
[02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:35.960]  the historic video feds back down at bundy ranch that video's got about a million views you can go
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:42.040]  watching it should have 50 million views and they said we will shoot you and men in military
[02:34:42.040 --> 02:34:48.440]  uniforms aiming m16s or m4 variants at them and our guys walked across and they had to back down
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:53.640]  and of course they were holding the bundy's cattle at their barn and basically killing them
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:59.560]  so that's what happened look smart folks are walking towards the the armored
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:05.320]  paramilitary feds i don't want to call them cops uh with their hands up because uh very dangerous
[02:35:05.320 --> 02:35:10.920]  situation and i don't want anybody to get hurt on either side but is there no federal order that
[02:35:10.920 --> 02:35:15.000]  can't be followed because obama is saying he's going to open the borders he's going to take the
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:18.920]  guns and are you in treaty he's going to shut down the power plants he's going to bring in the carbon
[02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:22.840]  taxes with the chinese government whether you like it or not whether congress likes it or not
[02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:27.720]  remember nixon said it's not illegal when the president does it well we proved that wrong
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:33.240]  i mean was hitler god because they they misinterpret roman's 13 to say do whatever government says
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:39.480]  if it's godly government if it's in the right if it's the people's government not if it's
[02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:45.160]  mousy tongue or stalin or fiddle castro and i mean we know what this looks like i i'm sure those
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:52.280]  federal paramilitary blm swat guys are probably you know not bad guys but why does the blm have
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:58.760]  big swat teams in fact i think they put military guys in they didn't look like regular folks they
[02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:05.640]  look like real military and not just your standard army people but vets so they probably sheep dipped in
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:12.920]  fbi hostage rescue team people or who knows what but it's a serious situation now one of clavin's
[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:16.520]  family tried to fly and was pulled out and then pulled out again and said oh you're on the you
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:21.720]  know terrorist list basically this is what this computerized system is all about this is why they
[02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:26.040]  want to control our lives it's not that we have something to hide is that the globalist want to
[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:30.360]  control us and cannot be given these unconstitutional powers we're going to talk to clavin money for
[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:37.640]  an update here in just a moment first off secret 12 is two years in the making it is the most powerful
[02:36:37.640 --> 02:36:44.680]  form of fused vitamin b12 out there half of the component is the exact pharmacological type
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:52.840]  that you inject and the other type is another bioavailable form that that group thinks
[02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:59.560]  synergistically works with it all i know is i said half it's it's it's 80 percent of the
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:04.040]  type that you inject and it's 20 percent of the other type i guess an earlier version had
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:11.080]  half and half the point is point is is that it is amazing and i put it in water personally and
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:14.600]  then drink it you can just put it in your mouth tastes great and there's nothing in there but
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:19.800]  out of a b12 and nobody else has put something else out like this the pills don't absorb and
[02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:25.080]  are synthetic most of the time okay this is the best lingual or sublingual out there secret 12

[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:12.040]  you heard that award-winning cinematographer filmmaker saying he's super influenced by the show
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:16.760]  he's down there basically making a Panama deception part two i would guess from what he said like
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:21.160]  reaching out to the original maker who won the academy award and then it was never sold in stores
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:29.640]  because i mean that that that film was incredible he's down there making a basically an updated one
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:34.440]  and that's how this show and others have influenced the culture we're all in this together
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:38.360]  some folks may not like my delivery i don't like it a lot of the time but i got all these
[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:42.840]  great reporters and researchers maybe you like their delivery or maybe you like that director's
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:47.880]  delivery maybe you like his style we want freedom we want to share it with each other we love each
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:52.120]  other we have goodwill towards humanity that's what it's all about and now there's been big
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:57.080]  developments on the bunny ranch too they're now saying that it's not just an environmental area
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:03.400]  but it's this critical area which under un rules means people can't even enter it they got caught
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:08.520]  with the maps saying it would be the set aside for the chinese solar farm that is they're allowed
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:13.880]  to build on one area then this is the environmental easement and they go charities aren't building on
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:18.680]  that land we go no we know it's a set aside the city does that yeah you got four acres you can
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:24.280]  build condos on half of it the other area has to be green belt set aside it's the same deal
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:29.000]  but they prey on your ignorance that you don't know development rules so there's been new
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:35.000]  developments on that front and we're joined by cliven bundy seven generations there with open
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:39.240]  surface rights folks don't know what that means they go make that guy get off government land the
[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:44.920]  government came later after he had surface rights and told him he didn't and yeah they had a federal
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:49.320]  court say that yeah yes basically get off well you know they got federal court saying obama can
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:53.560]  take your guns without a law in congress you got federal court saying he can open the borders up
[02:39:53.560 --> 02:39:59.400]  without congress you got them saying he can raise taxes without congress that's a load of bull folks
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:04.440]  it's called tyranny you got to decide what side you're on cliven thanks for coming on that's quite
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:10.200]  an introduction i know but you can jump in wherever you like well thank you appreciate it and i want
[02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:16.040]  to say hello to america it's nice to be able to visit with you one more time uh here on bundy
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:22.520]  ranch you know we have been enjoying some freedom since that standoff as a fed and you know we the
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:28.200]  people did drive those feds out of this part of the county and off bundy ranch and we have really
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:34.920]  enjoyed some freedom and liberties and we've been able to ranch and you know picnic have
[02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:43.960]  off-road enjoyment and enjoy this land and so we in that sense we have accomplished a lot
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:50.120]  and we're feeling good about it and we need to get our state to stand up for statehood and our
[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:54.920]  county sheriff to stand up to protect their life livered in property but hey we're progressing
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:41:02.760]  we're doing good in america well you're right and uh the feds were tasering people in the middle
[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:07.720]  of nowhere that held up signs attack dogs they were creeping around everywhere uh harry reeds you
[02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:12.600]  can come out and say you're basically a terrorist that's back five there's been a major political
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:17.880]  realignment i want to talk about the political realignment and what happened to your son but
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:26.680]  first off clavin let's talk about uh the current state out there are are they shooting kids bicycling
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:31.960]  in the back are they still pointing guns at ranchers uh are they still harassing everybody or
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:36.280]  what's going on well they're not doing that on bundy ranch and they're not doing that in this
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:41.240]  part of clark county but they are doing it all over the west for united states they're they've
[02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:48.120]  increased their power off this area and they are abusing the citizens and the citizens of property
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:53.080]  rights and you know you don't you wouldn't want to think that they're going to shoot some kid in
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:58.840]  the back but hey they've been doing that and we haven't got that far stop you know the people
[02:41:58.840 --> 02:42:05.160]  at bundy's standoff made a mandate of the sheriff he said take those arms away from those federal
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:10.840]  agencies those federal bureaucracy if he took those arms away they wouldn't be shooting people in
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:14.840]  the back and they don't have no jurisdiction authority to do it now but they are doing it
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:21.640]  and we got to have sheriffs across this the united states that are constitutional the sheriffs
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:26.120]  with a proper jurisdiction authority and they're the one that's supposed to shoot somebody in the
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:33.240]  back if he's if he's about a criminal not these federal officers well since when does a free country
[02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:37.720]  have hundreds of agents he's running around dressed up in army outfits they should go join the marine
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:43.640]  corps well sure they want to play army but you know this is where harry reed comes in harry reed
[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:48.920]  is uh developed armies and not only harry reed it's our federal government but let's blame it on
[02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:55.080]  harry for a minute harry reed has backed up all these different bureaucracy of agencies and that's
[02:42:55.080 --> 02:43:01.080]  not only blm and forest service and park service but you know it's the school and and uh homeland
[02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:06.440]  security and on and on he's armed these people you know our federal government has armed these
[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:12.920]  people with uh military weapons now these people are not armed to protect us against foreign nations
[02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:20.840]  and foreign people invasion invasion they're they're armed to kill american people and that's
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:27.160]  what the proof of bunty standoff was proof that's what they come for i can't believe they threatened
[02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:33.000]  to shoot people if you cross the line uh but america stood up to that intimidation but reed is just
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:37.080]  looking for a way to come after you let's play that terrorist clip to remind folks what he's been
[02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:41.800]  saying and then we'll get your take on it who to come in with me
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:50.280]  but you know they're also dead by improve themselves out to be patriots or not there's
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:56.200]  nothing more than domestic terrorists and i think that we are a country that people should follow the
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:44:02.520]  law and what went up in mesquite is not very good i repeat what went up there is domestic tourism
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:09.080]  okay domestic terrorism not tourism that's right that clip took a minute to play but
[02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:15.480]  you've got the floor uh clive and talk about it well you know uh what happens here is what they
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:22.040]  uh earmark you as a domestic terror that the domestic terrorist and when they he actually
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:28.360]  said later that was invited domestic terrorists he puts that earmark up on me and my family and
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:33.240]  all of those who stood with us now what the current event was is you don't have a son that was going
[02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:39.240]  to uh try to fly from beating sarazon of the salt lake city well when he it goes to get a clearance
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:46.360]  there what is it he's earmarked domestic terrorist and so they won't let him on the plane they take
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:51.960]  him to the research research he would carry on for an hour and a half he has him and his daughter
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:57.160]  and he missed their plane flight and so when he leaves that airport he says oh i'm earmarked as a
[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:06.440]  domestic terrorist i'm going to go down to the local gun store and see if i can buy a gun see if
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:12.920]  i'm listed there and sure enough they would not sell him a gun he was in he was he's been earmarked
[02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:20.760]  in that list on that blacklist and so if they did that to one of my sons evidently they could have
[02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:28.840]  been doing that to all of us and all of us that stood against them for sure continue going down
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:32.440]  the line then what do you think of this major political realignment do you think that's a
[02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:36.840]  repudiation of these type of activities by harry reese one of the most unpopular people out there
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:44.120]  well political realignment don't mean anything to me you know what means something to me is what our
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:50.840]  uh united states congressman uh realized and our president united states and our supreme
[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:56.360]  court realized that they only have limited power over certain things here in america
[02:45:56.360 --> 02:46:00.920]  now when they get back there and take care of their business back in washington dc and they
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:06.120]  they make legislation over those things that they're in charge of that's just fine but when
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:10.760]  they come out here in these sovereign states in america and start telling us what we're going to
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:15.720]  do and and how we're going to do it and if we don't do it they're going to bring an army against us
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:20.760]  we're not going to put up with that not us people here in america and those people have a place but
[02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:25.480]  it's not here in these sovereign states they have very little to do with these sovereign states
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:30.680]  i'm not saying they don't have nothing but their courts and their bureaucracies have nothing very
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:39.640]  little to do in in in these sovereign states of america elaborate on that well for example
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:46.600]  this is a current event they're coming back with that reality to retaliation uh against
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:51.640]  uh bunny rights right now and the people of southern nevada what are they doing they're
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:57.880]  putting more environmental uh uh restrictions on the land it's called areas of critical
[02:46:57.880 --> 02:47:06.280]  environmental concern with ac ec they're basically making all of the southern nevada ac ec and
[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:13.720]  basically what's happened in the past on these environmental issues and then this public so
[02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:20.120]  called public land they've said we're going to give you and and what we're going to do is we're
[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:25.640]  going to give you you can go down the sidewalk but you can't get off on the grass and if you get
[02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:31.800]  off on the grass to find a four or five hundred dollars you know that ruins the picnic but this
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:40.040]  new uh this new regulation they're putting up over the land is taking away the sidewalks so no
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:44.200]  in other words don't go down the sidewalk you can't go down the sidewalks without getting
[02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:49.000]  a five hundred dollar fine so that's a new restriction they're putting over bundy's
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:56.520]  ranch and also all over the southern park county night county and lincoln county partishes with
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:02.440]  them well sure well sure for those that don't know restriction retaliation against we the people
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:09.400]  to stand them up against the feds well for those that don't know cliven congress had maps put together
[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:16.360]  off the u n coordinates of areas that would be completely off human use and guess what you live
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:21.800]  in an area that they basically have completely out of human use but then only the globalist
[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:27.240]  are allowed to operate in those areas this is how they make their land more valuable they make all
[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:33.640]  the other land unusable except the land they own that's how they create artificial scarcity and this
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:40.440]  is an agenda 21 u n scam up one side and down the other now they're coming in with epa rules trying
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:46.360]  to ban people's children carrying the trash out or working on the farm proposed water rule could
[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:51.320]  put property rights of every american entirely at the mercy of the epa the proposed rule has
[02:48:51.320 --> 02:48:57.400]  ignited a firestorm and protest so they are coming out on every front obama says that china doesn't
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:01.400]  have to cut their carbon we're going to cut ours and double the price that means double the price
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:07.000]  of our energy i mean this is a strategy to shut us down you said there were 30 plus families that
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:11.800]  came in on those wagon trains in the 1870s into your county uh you know when your great great
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:18.600]  great great granddaddy was there uh you're one of the last families aren't you the last i i am the
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:26.440]  last of the cattle ranger that actually uses this uh uh uh land now you're a bad person listen listen
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:32.680]  if you weren't listen listen if you weighed 600 pounds and wore 6x underwear you could get on a bus
[02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:37.880]  come to the us to load you on a bus take you and you put you on welfare you can sit there and watch
[02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:44.200]  daytime soap operas and and and get up to a thousand pounds but the fact that you the fact
[02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:49.160]  that you produce food and are hardworking aren't a criminal that's why you got to be hunted down clavin
[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:54.120]  yep i guess but you know what i want to talk to you about stuff when this happened uh you know
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:59.560]  there's a line drew drew and drew uh let's look at it as like a white line down the highway and
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:05.240]  i want don't you audience to shut their eyes and say okay i see a black the road here with a white
[02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:11.160]  line you know we in america now have drawn a line and you either are going to be on the
[02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:17.720]  constitutional where we believe in the constitution of the united states the supreme law of the land
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:24.520]  are and i'll add more to that the inspired constitution the supreme law of the land and
[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:29.240]  we're going to we're going to believe in sovereign states and state law and county governments and
[02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:35.720]  county sheriff having the uh a jurisdiction authority of preaching power and arresting power
[02:50:35.720 --> 02:50:41.560]  and his job we pay him to do that job and his job is to protect our life liberty and property
[02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:46.680]  and also those little further you know we elect our judges at the county level i hear you stay
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:51.400]  there we need to make them stand up and do their job not become federal minions and the feds themselves
[02:50:51.400 --> 02:50:55.400]  have been captured by the globalists that's how you conquer america i want to talk about your son

[02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:32.280]  you're right there's a line you're either going to stand up for the constitution due process and
[02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:37.640]  prosperity or you're going to join with the globalist gang people like harry reed that get up on
[02:54:37.640 --> 02:54:42.360]  television and say that you know that that that you're a terrorist for not letting them completely
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:49.960]  run everybody off the land who've been there since 1877 now let's talk about your son and what
[02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:54.360]  they've been doing to him this is an example for everybody and if we get into this intimidation
[02:54:55.160 --> 02:54:59.160]  they'll end up taking over even more oh you better not criticize the government they won't let you
[02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:04.600]  fly that's the whole reason we shouldn't have internal checkpoints it isn't for terrorism
[02:55:04.600 --> 02:55:10.680]  it's for us just like the patriot act they now admits for the american people it was always meant
[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:17.560]  for that clavin bundy yes now let me uh go back here i want to wake your people up here you know
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:22.840]  they got their eyes shut looking down that white line on that black road uh they better wake up
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:28.200]  and decide which side of that line they're on and you know i didn't finish you know i said that the
[02:55:28.200 --> 02:55:34.200]  sheriff has the the constitutional jurisdiction and the party and we the people elect that sheriff
[02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:40.120]  and we the people pay that sheriff you know one of the problems we have in america is we get with
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:45.720]  the federal government is paying our sheriff no that's not their duty to pray the the sheriff we
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:51.720]  the people of the county the elected that man is the one that pays him and then he has some respect
[02:55:51.720 --> 02:55:57.320]  and honor back to protect our lives liberty and property but if the feds is paying his wages
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:04.600]  and his expenses and his operation who who does he respect that's a problem that's not only a problem
[02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:09.960]  with the sheriff that's a problem with our school districts and our county governments and our state
[02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:15.560]  governments and our health and welfare programs we need to start paying the bill ourselves not the
[02:56:15.560 --> 02:56:22.440]  federal government but but i want to show you want to look on the other side of this line this other
[02:56:22.440 --> 02:56:28.440]  line you express it pretty good that is where we have a social government where we have communist
[02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:33.240]  type government where we have all these big bureaucracies and we have all of this as function
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:41.160]  of unlimited power through their precinct power and where where where those people that have contracts
[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:46.120]  with the federal government are on that side of the line also they're not on the constitutional
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:51.160]  side they're on the the big government side the central government side we have got a clean
[02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:56.920]  asparagus and each one individual is going to decide which kind of life do we want to have this free
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:02.600]  life with liberty and justice for all or this other communist social i agree with you we're

[02:57:15.720 --> 02:57:21.560]  he refused to sell him a gun and then of course what's happening is the federal government running

[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:44.200]  state government's better wake up because we the people are not going to put up with them until
[03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:49.720]  they start realizing that they are sovereign states and we do have a constitution and we the people
[03:02:49.720 --> 03:02:57.400]  are the juries of this nation well you're certainly right clavin monday uh so that's
[03:02:57.400 --> 03:03:03.720]  great news that your son got put on the terrorist list and couldn't buy a gun and couldn't fly no
[03:03:03.720 --> 03:03:09.160]  judge no jury harry reid just you know says we're making moves against him but it's good that they've
[03:03:09.160 --> 03:03:13.560]  had to back down what other dirty tricks are you expecting them to try to pull well let me tell you
[03:03:13.560 --> 03:03:18.760]  about the uh the gun thing just a little more so you're listening to understand and he went to
[03:03:18.760 --> 03:03:28.920]  camara comparel's or camaro's uh cabellas that's a big uh a retail cabellas sports store and they
[03:03:28.920 --> 03:03:35.560]  said he can't buy a gun and you know within uh eight hours during the weekend after the media
[03:03:35.560 --> 03:03:43.880]  hits on a computer uh it was an eight hours fbi called him and said hey tell amon bundy he can
[03:03:43.880 --> 03:03:49.960]  buy a gun so that's what all that's what social media can do that changed the federal government's
[03:03:49.960 --> 03:03:55.000]  attitude over during the weekend where they were not even supposed to be at work well that's because
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:59.880]  they know you guys are good people and you're good poster child's you know like like rosa parks for a
[03:03:59.880 --> 03:04:04.280]  movement so they don't want to mess with you anymore they want to just deny people their right to buy
[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:09.960]  guns off record and not have it on the radar also there's a lot of democrats operating inside
[03:04:09.960 --> 03:04:14.360]  the nicks system and there are a lot of better people in the fbi and others that's who's over the
[03:04:14.360 --> 03:04:18.760]  nicks who are who are need to know when this happens because a lot of people get thrown on
[03:04:18.760 --> 03:04:24.120]  these unconstitutional lists not even officially they just go in and put your name in there so
[03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:30.440]  that's why you gotta squeal uh and and you know get upset and make a big noise then they're forced
