[00:00.000 --> 00:17.440]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:17.440 --> 00:32.480]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones. We are live. It is November 15th.
[00:32.480 --> 00:38.560]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson. I'll be filling in for Alex in this first hour. Ton of news coming up.
[00:38.560 --> 00:45.520]  Chief amongst it. The top story right now on Infowars.com. And we need to talk about creepy
[00:45.520 --> 00:52.160]  uncle Joe. Once again, headline X secret service agent claims Biden engaged in wine
[00:52.160 --> 00:58.320]  steam level groping. This is coming out of big league politics. This is their exclusive that
[00:58.320 --> 01:03.520]  came out last night. And it coincides with something else I saw a couple of days ago,
[01:03.520 --> 01:09.920]  which is still going viral on Twitter, which is this thread created by an activist called Richard
[01:09.920 --> 01:19.040]  Mills. And it's a compilation of all the unseemly unsavory incidents involving Joe Biden and
[01:19.040 --> 01:24.160]  children. Now, let's be clear. There's no evidence of illegal activity here, but we have to talk
[01:24.160 --> 01:28.960]  about this because it's going viral once again on Twitter. We've got an article and we're starting
[01:28.960 --> 01:35.520]  to play some examples. This is just one of them of Joe Biden appearing to touch children, appearing
[01:35.520 --> 01:39.200]  to sniff their hair. I'm going to go through the list of what he actually does. Most people don't
[01:39.200 --> 01:46.480]  know the sheer volume of shady shenanigans that's going on in these videos. You thought it was just
[01:46.480 --> 01:52.800]  a couple of videos. No, there's literally like 15 in this one thread, all of which are embedded in
[01:52.800 --> 02:01.200]  the article on Infowars.com of Joe Biden posing with children and behaving. I mean, let's let's
[02:01.200 --> 02:06.000]  be fair to him. He really likes children. Let's just say that he obviously really likes children
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.720]  and enjoys being in their company. That's all we're going to say right now. The article, and you
[02:10.720 --> 02:15.840]  can see some of those videos in it right now. By the way, save all those videos because God knows
[02:15.840 --> 02:21.280]  if Twitter is going to delete this thread. This is the thing. They've got New York Times writers
[02:21.280 --> 02:25.760]  quoting this thread on Twitter that you see we're scrolling through right now for TV viewers,
[02:26.560 --> 02:32.000]  saying, how is Twitter going to handle this? In fact, there was a woman called Nicole Perlroth,
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.480]  a New York Times writer who tweeted, quote, in the past 24 hours, a new alt-right fake news
[02:38.480 --> 02:46.720]  meme has emerged of Joe Biden as a predator. How will Twitter handle it? So she's directly calling
[02:46.720 --> 02:52.720]  on Twitter to quote, handle it. What do you think that means? It's an obvious not so subtle call
[02:52.720 --> 02:58.960]  for censorship. And no, this is not an alt-right fake news meme. This has been out for years. It's
[02:58.960 --> 03:04.320]  merely getting new attention in light of all these sexual abuse revelations. Now, people have come
[03:04.320 --> 03:10.560]  back and responded to that tweet by a New York Times writer, one of whom was Noah Getel, who is
[03:10.560 --> 03:17.040]  actually a leftist. He writes for the BBC Atlantic. And even he acknowledged that this is going to
[03:17.040 --> 03:23.120]  be an issue if Joe Biden runs for president in 2020, which by all indications is going to happen.
[03:23.120 --> 03:30.000]  He tweeted, quote, RTing retweeting one more time for two reasons. One, it's creepy. He's
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.640]  talking about the list of videos we just showed you. Anyone who has ever experienced witness
[03:34.640 --> 03:41.040]  the sexual abuse of children knows this is over the line. These are his words. He's a leftist
[03:41.040 --> 03:47.840]  journalist, not mine. Two, Dems be strategic. If Biden is going to run for president in 2020,
[03:47.840 --> 03:55.120]  this creepiness is going to be a big story from the right. So there you have a left-wing columnist
[03:55.120 --> 04:01.280]  admitting, in response to Nicole Perleroth, whose tweet you see there on screen, she wants it
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.960]  censored, but he's admitting that this is going to be a big narrative for the right if Joe Biden
[04:06.960 --> 04:14.240]  runs for president in 2020. And then again, it's not an alt-right meme. This is important in light
[04:14.240 --> 04:17.600]  of the revelations that we see coming out of Congress and we're going to get onto that in a
[04:17.600 --> 04:23.200]  second. But again, this was around before the alt-right was even a term. Some of these clips
[04:23.200 --> 04:27.120]  are years old. Some of them are more recent and we're going to go through some of them.
[04:27.120 --> 04:31.440]  But it dovetails with this story, which is coming out of big league politics last night.
[04:32.400 --> 04:39.120]  The next secret service agent is claiming that Joe Biden engaged in Weinstein-level sexual assault
[04:39.120 --> 04:45.280]  and that he would walk around the VP residence late at night, completely naked. These are revelations
[04:45.280 --> 04:49.040]  we've heard from other people before you tie that in with all these creepy videos.
[04:49.760 --> 04:53.840]  We're going to have to talk about this. This is extremely chilling. We'll be back,
[04:53.840 --> 05:09.760]  it's the Alex Jones Show Live, infowars.com. Don't go away.
[05:24.160 --> 05:28.160]  We also have been sold out for three months on biome defense, super high quality,
[05:28.160 --> 05:34.880]  probiotic. It's 25% off out of the gates, back in stock, but for a very limited time.
[05:34.880 --> 05:37.920]  So you get the highest quality, the very cleanest stuff out there. We're really,
[05:37.920 --> 05:43.600]  really proud of it. DNA force and biome defense, probiotic. Now back in stock, infowarslife.com.
[05:43.600 --> 05:47.920]  And when you buy products from globalists, it's an act of trading with the enemy. It is an act of
[05:47.920 --> 05:52.960]  war. It is an act of standing up when you spread the links, the articles and buy products from us.
[05:52.960 --> 05:56.000]  And then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[06:05.920 --> 06:12.480]  Clashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[06:12.480 --> 06:20.480]  front lines of the info war. Alex Jones Show, we're talking about
[06:20.480 --> 06:27.360]  pre Pete uncle Joe Biden, because top New York Times writers and other verified liberals on
[06:27.360 --> 06:34.320]  Twitter have come out over the past 24 hours and claimed that this story is an alt-right fake news
[06:34.320 --> 06:40.160]  meme. Well, I don't know how videos stretching back years can be a meme. I mean, it's flottage,
[06:40.160 --> 06:44.320]  it's clear, it's in your face, but others have responded and said, no, this is going to be
[06:44.320 --> 06:50.480]  a big issue for the left for the Democrats if Joe Biden runs in 2020. Now let's not forget,
[06:50.480 --> 06:57.840]  in 2015, February, we had a Washington Post article entitled, what are we going to do
[06:57.840 --> 07:03.680]  about creepy uncle Joe Biden? And they went through the list, not necessarily these videos,
[07:03.680 --> 07:08.800]  a couple of them they included with the children, but they also went through a list of women,
[07:08.800 --> 07:14.800]  grown women who've been obviously made to feel uncomfortable by Joe Biden touching them in
[07:14.800 --> 07:19.680]  public, like grabbing their shoulders, you can see them physically react and trying to get away
[07:19.680 --> 07:26.640]  from him in some instances. So there's a Washington Post talking about this nearly three years ago.
[07:26.640 --> 07:32.720]  What are we going to do about creepy uncle Joe Biden? So no, you can't claim this is an alt-right
[07:32.720 --> 07:38.960]  meme when there were articles about it in the mainstream media years ago. He's becoming notorious
[07:38.960 --> 07:44.080]  for this. And on top of that, we have this huge story last night, which broke last night,
[07:44.640 --> 07:49.920]  of big league politics. And according to Cassandra Fairbanks, who got the source on this,
[07:49.920 --> 07:55.200]  a secret service agent who spoke on condition of anonymity revealed that Joe Biden would,
[07:55.200 --> 08:01.200]  quote, mess with every single woman or teen during these events in the VP's residence,
[08:01.200 --> 08:06.800]  and that a Christmas get together at the VP's house had to be canceled because Biden was,
[08:06.800 --> 08:11.600]  and this is a quote, this is his words, because Biden will grow all of our wives and girlfriends
[08:12.320 --> 08:18.240]  behind. That's his direct quote. He also said the service often had to protect female agents
[08:19.280 --> 08:25.280]  from Biden and that Biden was prone to parading around the VP residence late at night with no
[08:25.280 --> 08:32.640]  clothes on. I mean, stock naked Weinstein level stuff said the agent, again, that's his quote.
[08:34.080 --> 08:38.960]  During one alleged incident in 2009, Biden cupped the breast of a secret service agent's
[08:38.960 --> 08:44.320]  girlfriend during a photo, prompting the agent to shove Biden, and then they almost got into
[08:44.320 --> 08:50.400]  a physical confrontation. He almost hit him. That agent was subsequently suspended for a week,
[08:50.400 --> 08:55.840]  according to the source. The article goes on to say men would often stand in front of female
[08:55.840 --> 09:02.560]  agents and Navy women or create false pretenses to have them leave the room just so they can get
[09:02.560 --> 09:08.560]  away from Biden, according to the agent. Now, these revelations about Biden apparently liking
[09:08.560 --> 09:13.680]  to stroll around naked in the middle of the night were also backed up by bestselling author Ronald
[09:13.680 --> 09:20.400]  Kessler, who wrote that Biden was fond of swimming naked and that secret service agents found that
[09:20.400 --> 09:26.960]  offensive. So we've got the backstory. We've got the new revelations from this secret service agent,
[09:26.960 --> 09:34.000]  which broke last night, which by the way, Donald Trump Jr. retweeted that thread where you see
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.320]  all these videos of Joe Biden groping on little children. Let's be honest, that's what it shows.
[09:40.320 --> 09:44.560]  So this is going to be a big issue. Donald Trump Jr. is picking up on this. It's starting to become
[09:44.560 --> 09:49.760]  a narrative. You see the left starting to react by trying to dismiss it as an alt-right meme.
[09:49.760 --> 09:54.560]  It's not an alt-right meme. Let's go through this article. Here you see one of the videos. Let's go
[09:54.560 --> 10:00.720]  right to the top of the Infowars.com article. X secret service agent claims Biden engaged in
[10:00.720 --> 10:04.800]  Weinstein level groping. If you go to that article, then you go down to the first video.
[10:04.800 --> 10:11.280]  You can see, as Richard Mill states, and he's the one with the big viral thread on Twitter,
[10:11.280 --> 10:16.960]  in this clip, former Vice President Biden uses a candid moment to fondle the chest area of a
[10:16.960 --> 10:23.840]  little girl in front of her entire family. Her visible discomfort is extremely obvious. And you
[10:23.840 --> 10:30.160]  see it in the video. She jerks away from him. There you see it. There's a close-up here in a
[10:30.160 --> 10:36.400]  second. You'll see it. You like, reaches down. There you see the close-up for TV viewers. She
[10:36.400 --> 10:42.720]  jerks away. Automatically, natural reaction to it. Go on to the next video that's embedded in that
[10:42.720 --> 10:48.640]  article. Now, this is the one that most of you have probably seen. He's leaning down to this
[10:48.640 --> 10:53.520]  13-year-old girl. By the way, he's obsessed with asking all these children how old they are. That's
[10:53.520 --> 10:58.240]  one of his things he likes to do. He's whispering something in her ear. Now, the senator that you
[10:58.240 --> 11:04.400]  see there later came out on CNN when people started asking questions about this a couple of years ago
[11:04.400 --> 11:09.200]  when the video first came out. And he said, oh, no, my daughter didn't find it creepy at all.
[11:09.200 --> 11:14.240]  And it's like, well, are you saying that or is your daughter saying that? I actually found this girl
[11:14.880 --> 11:21.840]  on Instagram, who's probably around 15, 16, by this point, contacted her, asked her if she found
[11:21.840 --> 11:27.680]  it creepy. No response so far. Make of that what you will. Her father, the senator, said it wasn't
[11:27.680 --> 11:33.360]  creepy. So I guess we got to believe him. You can go down into the third video in this article,
[11:33.360 --> 11:41.120]  which is on infowars.com, to see Joe Biden's habit of smelling the hair of women and particularly
[11:41.120 --> 11:46.800]  little girls. Remember, a lot of these children, he's literally just met them second before. It's
[11:46.800 --> 11:51.280]  not like they're long-term family friends or whatever. Some of them are, in some cases,
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.040]  but some aren't. Is this the kind of behavior you would be comfortable in seeing if your child
[11:57.040 --> 12:03.760]  was around somebody for the very first time? This really hands-on approach, this stroking of the hair,
[12:03.760 --> 12:09.120]  this sniffing of the hair that he seems to do all the time. And bearing in mind, that's just
[12:09.120 --> 12:14.320]  three videos out of this entire article. The whole thread literally has probably about 15
[12:14.320 --> 12:20.640]  different videos just from what we've picked up so far. And this is concerning. This is extremely
[12:20.640 --> 12:26.560]  concerning in light of the revelations that we see, not only out of Hollywood, but also out of
[12:26.560 --> 12:31.040]  Congress now. And I mean, I'm going to summarize this because we don't have time to play all the
[12:31.040 --> 12:36.720]  videos. But again, some of these kids he's meeting literally seconds into meeting them,
[12:36.720 --> 12:43.760]  he starts like touching on them, smelling their hair, stroking their face in a couple of cases,
[12:43.760 --> 12:50.240]  whispering in their ears. He always asks their age immediately, how old are you? And in a couple of
[12:50.240 --> 12:56.560]  cases, he asked the child how old they are, usually a little girl. And in one case, before he asked
[12:56.560 --> 13:03.360]  this little girl her age, she was six, by the way, Biden answered for her before she responded,
[13:03.360 --> 13:10.240]  he said, how old are you, 70? And it's a six year old girl. Is that not a little bit bizarre now?
[13:10.240 --> 13:15.120]  I'm sure it's completely normal. So obviously, you've seen you have been kissing the children,
[13:15.120 --> 13:20.720]  stroking their hair, touching them at length. We're talking about for in some cases, 20, 30,
[13:20.720 --> 13:27.040]  40 seconds on end, even when the child and in some cases, the parent is clearly uncomfortable
[13:27.040 --> 13:34.560]  with what he's doing. In other instances, repeatedly, Biden tells teen girls from the age of not just
[13:34.560 --> 13:41.680]  teens from the age of six up to about 19, to not date men until they're 30. This is something he
[13:41.680 --> 13:47.120]  says over and over again, every time he meets them almost, don't date any men until you're 30.
[13:47.680 --> 13:52.000]  What's going on with that? Obviously, they're going to date men before they're 30. That's a
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.760]  little bit weird. He repeatedly asked children to stand next to him in all these video clips.
[13:57.760 --> 14:05.040]  He also tells the brothers of these little girls, quote, keep the and he tells the parents, quote,
[14:05.040 --> 14:11.040]  keep the boys away from their sisters. What in God's name is he talking about there?
[14:11.040 --> 14:16.560]  I'm talking about six, seven, eight year old boys with six, seven, eight year old sisters
[14:16.560 --> 14:22.480]  as they line up for the photo op and Biden is telling the parents, keep the boys away from
[14:22.480 --> 14:29.440]  their sisters. What? What on earth is going through his head to be talking like that about children?
[14:30.880 --> 14:37.520]  That is, that is bizarre. Come on. And we've seen it in other cases with women. There you see another
[14:37.520 --> 14:42.320]  one. He's grabbing him by the shoulders clearly uncomfortable with that it goes on for like 30
[14:42.320 --> 14:48.240]  seconds. This is not his wife. Why are you touching on women grabbing on their shoulders?
[14:49.840 --> 14:54.560]  Now, again, there's no evidence whatsoever that Joe Biden engaged in any illegal activity
[14:54.560 --> 15:01.360]  whatsoever. But in this climate, it's no surprise that people are asking questions about this once
[15:01.360 --> 15:07.840]  again. And to dismiss it as an alt right meme clearly shows that they're a little bit panicked
[15:07.840 --> 15:12.720]  over what could come of this. Because Biden's doing the talk show circuit right now. He's got
[15:12.720 --> 15:19.200]  a new book out, I think he was on Colbert last night or a couple of nights ago, trashing Trump,
[15:19.760 --> 15:24.640]  positioning himself as the moral guardian of America by saying that Trump basically
[15:24.640 --> 15:29.840]  ripping apart the civic spirit, the morality of America. So it clearly looks as if they're
[15:29.840 --> 15:36.560]  positioning Biden who may even have beaten Trump if he had run instead of Hillary last year to run
[15:36.560 --> 15:43.440]  in 2020. So this is going to be an issue. This is going to be a key issue in the left. The Democrats
[15:43.440 --> 15:49.920]  are starting to panic about it, but we need to treat it seriously. We need to ask serious questions
[15:49.920 --> 15:55.360]  about creepy uncle Joe Biden. We'll be back on the Alex Jones show live breaking news at info wars

[23:05.760 --> 23:12.240]  and they basically had a derangement fit over it they had a mass meltdown because it was oh my

[24:15.200 --> 24:24.080]  at infostore.com now we got more sexual abuse allegations emerging this time out of vice
[24:24.080 --> 24:28.880]  well isn't that interesting vice the same publication that lectures men endlessly about
[24:28.880 --> 24:35.680]  toxic masculinity it now emerges employees detail a culture of sexual harassment at vice this is
[24:35.680 --> 24:41.200]  out of axios.com more than a dozen current and former employees at vice news recounted a culture
[24:41.200 --> 24:46.480]  of sexism and sexual harassment plus a human resources department that was unresponsive
[24:46.480 --> 24:52.400]  to employee complaints to the daily beast quote we have immediately begun reviewing this matter
[24:52.400 --> 24:58.400]  vice told the daily beast by a statement so they've got a huge sexual harassment problem in the
[24:58.400 --> 25:04.720]  officers of vice yet they're the ones who on a daily basis come out and of course boost third
[25:04.720 --> 25:13.040]  way feminism and isn't it sweetly ironic every single time the biggest virtue signals the biggest
[25:13.040 --> 25:19.840]  male feminists have turned out to also be sexual abusers of women and now that is ensnaring the
[25:19.840 --> 25:28.560]  officers of vice media such such a sweet irony we've also got this story spire us house paid
[25:28.560 --> 25:34.800]  15 million dollars to its secret sexual harassment victims let's go to this clip first and then we'll
[25:34.800 --> 25:39.760]  get into the article this is a clip about this story about the secret payments that are going
[25:39.760 --> 25:59.760]  from congress to sexual harassment victims here's the clip yeah we've got problems with audio with
[25:59.760 --> 26:05.360]  that so i'm just going to read the article out of bright but representative jackie spire who is a
[26:05.360 --> 26:10.320]  democrat of california told msnbc's chuck todd on meet the press daily on tuesday that the us
[26:10.320 --> 26:16.640]  house of representatives has paid 15 million dollars to alleged victims of sexual harassment
[26:16.640 --> 26:21.760]  by its own members in recent years she said quote we do know that there is about 15 million dollars
[26:21.760 --> 26:27.360]  that has been paid out by the house on behalf of harassers in the last 10 to 15 years this has been
[26:27.360 --> 26:34.720]  kept completely secret 15 million dollars has been paid out of sexual harassment claims so obviously
[26:34.720 --> 26:39.280]  she said more than one member of congress that's actually chuck todd's response
[26:39.280 --> 26:44.320]  though even he's entertaining it now press for details spire said she did not know how many
[26:44.320 --> 26:48.880]  members of congress were involved she also explained that victims had signed non-disclosure
[26:48.880 --> 26:54.000]  agreements now this was after she testified earlier in the day at the committee on house
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.840]  administration that there were two current members of congress one republican and one democrat
[26:59.840 --> 27:06.480]  who were guilty of sexual harassment she did not divulge names cnn report Tuesday harassment was
[27:06.480 --> 27:11.840]  widespread on capitol hill and in the surrounding office buildings now the problem is the nature
[27:11.840 --> 27:16.800]  of that harassment obviously we have a huge problem with this it's the very nature of politics and the
[27:16.800 --> 27:22.720]  entertainment industry that a lot of men who get into positions of power think that they can abuse
[27:22.720 --> 27:28.640]  their power by just basically having any woman they desire on the flip side there are some women
[27:28.640 --> 27:35.120]  again not all some men who abuse their power some women that abuse their looks to manipulate men into
[27:35.120 --> 27:40.160]  you know getting favors from them by flirting with them by using their chance by throwing
[27:40.160 --> 27:45.840]  themselves at men it happens it's a fact so let's fall on both sides obviously the majority of
[27:45.840 --> 27:51.680]  sexual harassment is coming from men but again feminists as i've described in my recent video
[27:51.680 --> 27:57.200]  have hijacked that used it as a narrative to demonize all men but of course we've got a big
[27:57.200 --> 28:03.680]  problem here and now we've got this democratic representative saying there are two i presume
[28:03.680 --> 28:10.400]  prominent members of congress on capitol hill who are by the sounds of it serial sexual harassers
[28:10.400 --> 28:17.040]  of women we've got 15 million dollars in secret payments going to the victims of this they're
[28:17.040 --> 28:23.280]  having to sign non-disclosure agreements so they don't talk about it this has only just begun to
[28:23.280 --> 28:29.840]  explode this entire sexual abuse scandal it's percolated down from hollywood now it's getting
[28:29.840 --> 28:35.520]  political we've had the whole pest minster scandal over in london and the fall out from that now
[28:35.520 --> 28:40.960]  there are two members of congress who are deeply involved in it their identities are for the time
[28:40.960 --> 28:46.400]  being being kept secret we'll be back on the other side it's the alex jones show frankie news info

[33:53.040 --> 33:58.960]  celebrates new chariel or barbie doll gets destroyed on twitter and yet again we're seeing
[33:58.960 --> 34:05.520]  dominant cultural institutions on the left fetishize the hijab the muslim veil tried to make
[34:05.520 --> 34:10.880]  it out as a symbol of feminism it's not how many times i have to tell you how many videos i have
[34:10.880 --> 34:17.200]  to make about this describing explaining the history of it explaining how women and young
[34:17.200 --> 34:23.760]  girls in the middle east are bruplized or oppressed because they don't wear the hijab it's not a
[34:23.760 --> 34:30.080]  symbol of feminism it's a symbol of actual patriarchal oppression staunch feminist whose
[34:30.080 --> 34:34.720]  family takes millions of dollars from middle eastern countries that execute lgbt people
[34:34.720 --> 34:39.600]  but staunch feminist chelsea clinton took to her twitter account to celebrate the new sharia
[34:39.600 --> 34:44.320]  compliant hijab wearing barbie doll millions of women are abused and oppressed under sharia
[34:44.320 --> 34:50.320]  lauren chelsea clinton thinks it's great she tweeted out a people article you see it there
[34:50.320 --> 34:56.080]  celebrating the first ever barbie to wear a hijab in the brand's 58 year history barbie's
[34:56.080 --> 35:01.600]  breaking barriers it hash muhammad was the first ever us olympic athletes compete wearing a hijab
[35:01.600 --> 35:07.440]  at the 2016 re olympic games and she has a very on barbie the first to ever wear a hijab in the
[35:07.440 --> 35:13.200]  brand's 58 year history now as we explained yesterday on yesterday's show this whole idea
[35:13.200 --> 35:18.160]  didn't originate because of this athlete it originated from feminists going years back who've
[35:18.160 --> 35:25.520]  been calling for this for years so chelsea clinton tweeter loved this barbie made their first hijab
[35:25.520 --> 35:33.360]  wearing shiro doll in honor of american fencing star ibb hash muhammad he tweeted a picture of
[35:33.360 --> 35:39.920]  the doll then miley cyrus came out who's known for breaking down and wailing uncontrollably in
[35:39.920 --> 35:45.520]  videos because she loves hillar or clinton so much miley cyrus came out with a tweet and people
[35:45.520 --> 35:51.200]  like why do you care it's only miley cyrus okay she has millions of impressionable young followers
[35:51.200 --> 35:57.680]  she said and you can see the tweet there yay barbie one step closer to equality we have to
[35:57.680 --> 36:04.080]  normalize diversity well now you're not normalizing diversity i'll tell you what you're normalizing
[36:04.080 --> 36:10.640]  in fact rather than me telling you again let's read the words of the head of the muslim reform
[36:10.640 --> 36:17.040]  movement when she writes about the hijab and how it enforces a purity culture that brutalizes
[36:17.040 --> 36:23.840]  and oppressors women that's what you're normalizing do you get it yet did you do any cursory research
[36:23.840 --> 36:31.440]  before tweeting out this utter crap miley cyrus no asra q nomani founder of the muslim reform
[36:31.440 --> 36:37.440]  movement she pointed out and this was in my video questions for burqa areas which are made a few
[36:37.440 --> 36:42.640]  months back she pointed out the difference just the recent examples of young girls and women
[36:42.640 --> 36:48.400]  being brutalized sometimes killed for not wearing the hijab for letting it slip let's not forget by
[36:48.400 --> 36:56.160]  the way they literally have burqa and hijab police in indonesia in iran in these other countries
[36:56.160 --> 37:01.920]  that go around looking for women who have let their hijab slip a little bit they get punished
[37:01.920 --> 37:07.840]  in iran they get put in prison for not wearing the hijab you have entire protest movements
[37:08.720 --> 37:16.080]  solely based around these women taking off the hijab in iran that's real feminism okay why would
[37:16.080 --> 37:22.160]  you want to normalize a system that brutalizes and puts women in cages if they don't follow
[37:22.160 --> 37:28.320]  this insane stringent purity culture why would you want to normalize that miley cyrus you complete
[37:28.320 --> 37:36.080]  idiot asra q nomani founder of the muslim reform movement said recently in barreilly india a father
[37:36.080 --> 37:41.040]  killed his daughter four years old smashing her head against the floor when her scarf slipped from
[37:41.040 --> 37:46.800]  her head during dinner do we want to normalize that in ontario a few years ago a man strangled
[37:46.800 --> 37:53.200]  his 16 year old sister when she defied their father including by refusing to cover her hair do we
[37:53.200 --> 37:58.480]  want to normalize that in november last year a former university of missouri instructed dragged
[37:58.480 --> 38:03.760]  a female relative 14 years old out of school by the hair when he discovered she hadn't covered her
[38:03.760 --> 38:10.640]  hair do we want to normalize that today in iran friends of the journalist mesi al inajad dodge
[38:10.640 --> 38:16.640]  batons as they shoot photos of themselves hair bear in a campaign al inajad started
[38:16.640 --> 38:24.240]  hashtag my stealthy freedom to protest iran's mandatory mandatory headscarf law okay do you
[38:24.240 --> 38:30.880]  want to normalize beating up women because they protest on the street by removing their hijab
[38:31.600 --> 38:37.680]  do we want to normalize that miley brigging cyrus you complete idiot chelsea clinton
[38:37.680 --> 38:43.280]  whose family has took what 200 million dollars from gulf states alone over the past few years
[38:43.280 --> 38:51.200]  the same gulf states that still execute homosexuals absolutely incredible the the way they just
[38:51.200 --> 38:57.040]  tweet this out on a whim as a virtue singling device to millions and millions of impressionable
[38:57.040 --> 39:02.800]  young people when they know absolutely nothing about it nothing about how the hijab is used as
[39:02.800 --> 39:11.200]  an actual tool of brutality and oppression by an actual toxic masculinity movement called islam
[39:11.200 --> 39:17.600]  by the patriarchy in the middle east absolutely incredible we have to deal with this propaganda
[39:17.600 --> 39:22.960]  over and over again i mean that's part of the frustration isn't it having to repeat the same
[39:22.960 --> 39:29.120]  talking points over and over again the left is adept at that they're completely skilled in doing
[39:29.120 --> 39:34.160]  that the right isn't because we tend to be a little bit more curious about different things
[39:34.160 --> 39:38.400]  we get bored of talking about the same subject over and over again but we have to do it
[39:38.400 --> 39:45.600]  it because this disinformation pours forth out of these twitter accounts these millions of followers
[39:45.600 --> 39:51.840]  on a daily basis and it comes up again and again with the hijab no it's not a symbol of feminism
[39:51.840 --> 39:57.360]  it's a symbol of oppression talk to actual muslim reformists go and read the history of the first
[39:57.360 --> 40:03.600]  arab feminist muslim movement nearly a hundred years ago the egyptian feminist union who protested
[40:03.600 --> 40:08.880]  by removing their hijabs you dummies you don't know anything about history
[40:10.640 --> 40:17.520]  incredible moving on information liberation reports problematic makeup removing app make
[40:17.520 --> 40:24.240]  app causes mass triggering so they're not offended about the hijab being a tool of oppression they're
[40:24.240 --> 40:30.800]  offended about an app that was developed which takes pictures of women removes their makeup
[40:30.800 --> 40:35.440]  and produces the result you see right there who's that i think that's anacaspian out of
[40:35.440 --> 40:41.680]  the young turks is it a little bit cheeky maybe a little bit mean maybe oh but the triggering
[40:41.680 --> 40:46.880]  the triggering was so immense that business insider actually wrote an article they see
[40:46.880 --> 40:54.160]  rachel maddow not looking so great shock horror women don't look as good without any makeup oh my
[40:54.160 --> 41:00.400]  god like we didn't know that somebody's just presenting it as a funny app absolute meltdown
[41:00.400 --> 41:04.720]  of course because we have to be offended about something new every single frigging day and
[41:04.720 --> 41:11.360]  they were so triggered by it they named the developer of this app a guy called ashok gabry
[41:11.360 --> 41:18.640]  larnoff they accused him of being a kremlin agent and he said he came back on twitter and said he's
[41:18.640 --> 41:25.280]  going to sue the business insider for lying about him then one liberal writer at slate tried to stick
[41:25.280 --> 41:30.640]  it to grab gabry larnoff by running him through the app which is what they did if you scroll to
[41:30.640 --> 41:34.960]  the very bottom of that article they thought they would get him back well i'm going to get him back
[41:34.960 --> 41:40.080]  that evil misogynist by running him through the app so he looks exactly the same because of course
[41:40.080 --> 41:46.640]  you know men don't wear makeup kind of gives it away there but again this is what they're
[41:46.640 --> 41:52.320]  outraged about they're not outraged about women and young girls being strangled to death because
[41:52.320 --> 41:57.360]  the hijab slips to the floor they're not outraged about honor killings they're not outraged about
[41:57.360 --> 42:03.840]  female genital mutilation they're not outraged about absolute actual brutality against women
[42:03.840 --> 42:09.120]  they see the trump family looks a little bit better than anna kasparian they're not outraged about that
[42:09.120 --> 42:15.920]  they're outraged about some stupid app that removes makeup from women like that's the most
[42:15.920 --> 42:21.120]  evil misogynistic thing you could ever do meanwhile women are being stoned to death in the middle east
[42:21.120 --> 42:24.960]  because someone said they had an affair with someone no we don't care about that don't care
[42:24.960 --> 42:30.320]  about women in iran being persecuted and thrown in cages because they want to remove their hijabs
[42:30.320 --> 42:35.440]  we don't care about that we care about this guy who created a stupid app that removes makeup from
[42:35.440 --> 42:40.880]  women and we're so triggered we're going to accuse him of being a russian agent because everybody
[42:40.880 --> 42:47.200]  who we don't like is a russian agent incredible we'll be back on the other side it's the alex

[49:12.640 --> 49:17.680]  exalted by the left as their new hero let's talk about this story out of bright bar dot com
[49:17.680 --> 49:23.280]  council cracks down on islamophobia after parents withdraw children from school mosque trips
[49:24.560 --> 49:29.920]  now they're putting a black mark against parents and against students if they withdraw them from
[49:29.920 --> 49:36.000]  visiting mos we saw this back in 2013 with a different headline out of the bbc head teacher
[49:36.000 --> 49:41.760]  apologizes of a racial discrimination letter they were putting racial discrimination notes
[49:41.760 --> 49:47.840]  against a child's educational record if they didn't go on a quote religious trip and it was of
[49:47.840 --> 49:52.800]  course always a trip to a mosque well now a council in britain is taking action to crack down on
[49:52.800 --> 49:58.160]  islamophobia which is not a real thing it doesn't exist in response to some parents refusing to
[49:58.160 --> 50:03.680]  send their children on mosque visits arranged by schools now there's been a lot of backlash
[50:03.680 --> 50:08.000]  over this we've seen pictures out the netherlands other countries where they're made to kneel down
[50:08.000 --> 50:14.080]  in some cases made to recite the conversion prayer to islam oh it's just a school trip don't
[50:14.080 --> 50:18.800]  worry about it but now it's emerged that some pupils were being prevented from going on school
[50:18.800 --> 50:24.720]  trips to mos by their parents and the local council reacted by producing a document claiming
[50:24.720 --> 50:31.120]  mosque visits are vital in preparing children for life in diverse britain again this is another
[50:31.120 --> 50:37.040]  part of the capitulation not multiculturalism it's you capitulate to that culture the stronger
[50:37.040 --> 50:41.360]  culture coming in while families have the right to remove their children from school trips the
[50:41.360 --> 50:46.480]  council said it was a serious matter that pupils have been withdrawn from mos visits some parents
[50:46.480 --> 50:51.040]  have cited concerns over cost and safety while others deployed a political agenda behind the
[50:51.040 --> 50:56.000]  activities to counter this they're issuing schools with guidance on how to counter the
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.480]  trend which includes a template letter to parents claiming that mos visits play an important role
[51:00.480 --> 51:07.840]  in helping to equip pupils for today's diverse britain and then they're threatening quote this
[51:07.840 --> 51:12.480]  is what the education body is telling the schools quote while objections are raised about visits
[51:12.480 --> 51:17.040]  to a number of places of worship they are most frequently about visits to mosques which raises
[51:17.040 --> 51:23.280]  the bigger issue of islamophobia and how this can be addressed so they're basically saying if you
[51:23.280 --> 51:28.400]  stop your child going on a school trip to a mosque you're an islamophobic maybe you need to be
[51:28.400 --> 51:33.760]  investigative for your thought crimes of course if modeling parents withdrew their kids from
[51:34.320 --> 51:40.960]  visits to christian churches or christian assemblies would that be characterizes christianophobic no it
[51:40.960 --> 51:46.240]  wouldn't it would be completely allowed there would be no consequences whatsoever but no you
[51:46.240 --> 51:52.640]  have to bathe your child in this new tolerance and diversity you don't get a say the state controls
[51:52.640 --> 51:57.600]  your activity and if you kick up a fuss well maybe you need to be investigated for your hate crimes
[51:57.600 --> 52:03.680]  absolutely insidious chilling modern britain that we're living in right now well we have like 3000
[52:03.680 --> 52:08.480]  islamic terrorists running around please don't do anything about it but if you send an islamophobic
[52:08.480 --> 52:13.680]  tweet they're banging on your door that's the country we're living right now now maxine waters
[52:13.680 --> 52:20.640]  has come out this is out of american mirror maxine waters impeach 45 chance sends glamour awards
[52:20.640 --> 52:26.560]  into frenzy california congresswoman maxine waters continued her crusade against president
[52:26.560 --> 52:31.200]  trump this week by leading women at the glamour women of the year awards in an impeach 45 chan at
[52:31.200 --> 52:45.040]  brooklyn's king theater and we have the clip here it is it to say impeach him
[52:45.040 --> 52:54.640]  impeach him impeach him
[52:59.520 --> 53:10.400]  impeach 45 impeach 45 i didn't hear you impeach 45 thank you
[53:10.400 --> 53:18.400]  there you have it mad vaccine once again now notice how we're seeing with this
[53:18.400 --> 53:23.440]  trump derangement syndrome which is still virulent the magazine and fashion industries
[53:23.440 --> 53:30.720]  giving awards to people purely due to their trump derangement syndrome being the loudest
[53:30.720 --> 53:35.840]  the ones who screech the loudest about impeachment about how evil hitler like
[53:35.840 --> 53:41.520]  natsy like fascist like trump is they get the award because it's a massive circle jerk it's
[53:41.520 --> 53:47.840]  not about achievements gq magazine just gave calling kapanic man of the year his careers
[53:47.840 --> 53:52.720]  completely fallen off the cliff he's a total failure why did they give him the award because
[53:52.720 --> 53:57.760]  he's screeched the loudest with his trump derangement syndrome that's what they have to do
[53:57.760 --> 54:03.040]  despite the fact by the way we saw with the kondane ast and gq magazine their subscribers
[54:03.040 --> 54:07.840]  are plummeting just like calling kapanic's career we've seen in hollywood all the virtue
[54:07.840 --> 54:13.840]  signaling in hollywood hollywood is collapsing revenues are way down a massive reduction in
[54:13.840 --> 54:20.560]  people buying tickets to movies we've seen it in television ratings they see kapanic man of the year
[54:20.560 --> 54:26.240]  even though he's a complete failure we've seen television netflix theories that get into this
[54:26.240 --> 54:32.240]  whole trump derangement syndrome insert politics into everything their ratings are collapsing
[54:32.240 --> 54:37.840]  we've seen the nfl and we had the big poll where people said they were not watching the nfl anymore
[54:37.840 --> 54:43.280]  because it was getting too political when people sit back and want to be entertained and watch a
[54:43.280 --> 54:49.680]  movie or watch a football game they don't want to hear about the damn politics but no they're so
[54:49.680 --> 54:54.800]  hysterical they have to inject it into everything because they lost the argument politically in
[54:54.800 --> 55:02.080]  2016 so they have to intensify it even more culturally like andrew breitbart said politics is
[55:02.080 --> 55:07.040]  downstream from culture they're losing the debate they're losing the argument politically so they
[55:07.040 --> 55:13.760]  have to ramp up the hysteria by inserting it into culture to energize their base to get out and vote
[55:13.760 --> 55:19.040]  for democrats which we saw with the recent elections it's working to some extent but to another
[55:19.040 --> 55:25.600]  extent it's not they're losing ratings they're losing income and to have maxine waters being
[55:25.600 --> 55:32.480]  given an award this is the same woman who basically called for trump's impeachment the day after he
[55:32.480 --> 55:36.960]  was in office i mean it was straight from the off right this is the same woman who said that the
[55:36.960 --> 55:43.680]  evidence of russian collusion with trump was that putin vladimir putin invented the phrases
[55:43.680 --> 55:50.000]  lock her up and crooked hillary she got up on msnbc and claimed that with no evidence whatsoever
[55:50.000 --> 55:55.200]  but that was her bombshell evidence for russian collusion with trump because a few weeks ago she
[55:55.200 --> 56:03.280]  came out at another event and called said she would basically quote take out trump dangerous
[56:03.280 --> 56:09.040]  radical rhetoric especially in light of all these anti-trump domestic terrorists that have come to
[56:09.040 --> 56:14.960]  light over the past few weeks we had another one of those yesterday now this is a woman maxine waters
[56:14.960 --> 56:20.800]  of course who came out and said that russian bots were responsible for hanging physical banners
[56:20.800 --> 56:26.960]  outside of her political events russian bots hanging physical banners this is the the sanity

[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:17.680]  you're back on the alex jones show alex will be coming up in the next segment to cover the
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.640]  lightest news but for the moment in this final few minutes let's hit a few more news stories that
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:28.000]  i've found of interest now we're talking about taylor swiss she's been absolutely slammed
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.640]  for not being political during the 2016 election for not throwing her way in with hillard clinton
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:40.480]  or coming out against trump in the aftermath of his inauguration because god forbid an entertainer
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:45.600]  would just want to concentrate on i don't know entertaining people know if she's not part of
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:51.120]  your trump derangement syndrome hysteria she's basically trash now they're coming after taylor
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:57.760]  swift we have john stewart they see the marie claire tweet marie claire tweet we're still waiting
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.920]  for an explanation of taylor swiss decision to remain apolitical during 2016 election
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:08.480]  hashtag reputation but they only got 163 retweets and if you look in the comments of that tweet
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:14.480]  the marie claire tweet they got absolutely slaughtered so they're going after taylor swift
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.920]  because she wants to remain apolitical which jives with what people are saying when you poll
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.800]  them about the nfl or about hollywood when they watch a movie or a football game they just want
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:30.720]  to be entertained they don't want to be confronted with politics and hysteria all the frigging time
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:36.480]  can you just give it a rest for five minutes no they have to destroy everybody because it's
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:43.920]  part of the hashtag resistance which is the hysteria that is built up out of hillary clinton
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.840]  losing and that's the sole reason they're still bought her about it over a year later john stewart
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:55.760]  has come out this is news busters john stewart to anyone who wants even-handed comedy tough
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:01.360]  s h i t liberal comedian john stewart on tuesday ran to anyone who isn't happy with the politicized
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:08.800]  tone of late night comedy and boy is it politicized telling the new york times tough s h i t of course
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:14.320]  he also slimed conservatives as bigots for objecting to the angry liberalism of jimmy kimmel
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:20.080]  or seth meyers john stewart said quote the people that say this culture isn't for me living in
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:25.760]  nostalgic world those are the people who are the first to tell minorities suck it up so john
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:33.600]  stewart's basically saying no everybody has to be hyper parties and even in comedy now we were
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.800]  amazed a few days ago when saturday night life came out and did a skit that made the democrats
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:45.920]  look a little bit goofy because it's so rare now they've signed over everything to this hashtag
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:52.640]  resistance hysteria that being funny has gone out of the window okay most of this is drab it's
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:59.280]  pathetic it's not even funny anymore they've got like teams of 2030 writers on this you put on jimmy
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:05.280]  kimmel and it's him ranting about gun control for 20 minutes what happened to the comedy what happened
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:11.280]  to john stewart and steven colbert back when they were actually funny on the daily show like 15 years
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:19.120]  ago almost bashing both republicans and democrats that was actually funny now it's this unhinged
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:25.840]  hysterical urge to have trump impeached simply through hysteria alone i mean there was a thing
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:31.200]  today where he put out a tweet which was obviously a drafted tweet that had been saved on his phone
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:38.400]  from before he went abroad about the sylvan springs church church shooting he comes back from asia
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:44.720]  it gets tweeted out it's oh my god absolute meltdown trump made a mistake in a tweet that was drafted
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:50.320]  and sent out from his phone oh my god surely an impeachable offense right this is the level of
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:56.400]  hysteria you saw it with feeding the fish they see the headline it was a tweet that was saved in
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:02.320]  his phone obviously a draft from before he left the country it was sent out absolute meltdown
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:08.800]  you saw the hysteria about the fish oh my god the fish he dumped the fish food how
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:14.000]  boorish this is a diplomatic incident some of them even suggested of course it was completely
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.440]  fake news but this is the level we've reached right now where even at the expense of their own
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:26.560]  industries with box office income plummeting with nfl audiences turning off with espn's audience
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:34.320]  their viewership collapsing they still insist on injecting trump derangement hysteria into
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:41.200]  everything they're quite prepared to cut off the noses by their face it's absolute intense overload
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:47.200]  hysteria and now john stewart signed onto it and taylor swift will be destroyed because she

[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:31.440]  watch them on extremely powerful information and analysis and we've got more uh with paul in a
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:38.240]  tape report he did the new sexual puritans uh showing how the left is equating normal sexual
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:45.120]  activity and normal courting between men and women as sexual assault uh but then basically
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.680]  trying to cover up for what hollywood and other organizations are doing when it comes down to
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:55.360]  trying to even mainline pedophilia so that's all coming up a little bit later in the hour more
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:01.280]  with paul joseph watchen now we've got some really serious news i wanted to just mention
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:06.960]  before i get into the big news that's up on info wars dot com from paul joseph watchen
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:15.680]  x secret service agent claims biden engaged in winestein level groping he would mess with
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:23.680]  every single woman or teen it was horrible well i i don't need to hear that from a secret service
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:29.200]  agent to know it's true we have put out over the last four or five years it's gotta be more than
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:36.240]  15 reports some of which are an hour long and paul watchen has a bunch of examples of these in his
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:43.280]  article of three year olds five year olds eight year olds 10 year olds 12 year olds 13 14 i mean
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:48.480]  he comes over grabs him by the arm is clearly rubbing on him rubbing on their buttocks is
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:55.440]  it is the creepiest thing i've seen since that drag queen festival they had last week in austin
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:02.240]  where men are shaking their butts in small children's faces and dresses women and then little girls
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:07.920]  and boys are giving them money and then men are totally naked except for glitter on their genitals
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:13.840]  so it just goes on and on creepy joe biden has been known for this for decades but
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:20.640]  he does it on c span he did it when he was in the white house as the vp uh and so i think it's
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:25.040]  critical coming up later in the broadcast there maybe with owens shroyer at three o'clock on the
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:32.640]  war room maybe we should just air during a three hour show maybe an hour of groping because you've
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:37.040]  got to see it to believe it i know we're mainly a radio show but we can give you commentary on
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:43.920]  it you got to go see it for yourself now here's the deal the democrats are defending biden they've
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:50.240]  been defending bill clinton for decades when we first heard that roi moore was being accused by
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:56.720]  people connected to hillary's previous campaign who'd work for her and who'd work for the candidate
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:02.560]  who he's running against mr jones in alabama i thought this looks suspicious because we saw
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:07.280]  false charges against trump that turned out to be totally made up by jane does that didn't exist
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:13.280]  and i said wow the news is he told girls they were pretty because that's what i first read
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.480]  but then by the time moore came out that same day last week what was it wednesday thursday by the
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:25.360]  time moore came out on moore it was like well i did date teens when i was 35 but i did ask their
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:32.720]  mama's permission and that's the creep zone okay it's it's weird and then the trolling around the mall
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:39.360]  is trying to pick up teenage women okay uh that's not illegal but it's creepy and it's par for the
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:45.760]  course for these politicians so now steven bannon has turned on him uh drugs report uh has the
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:52.400]  headline bannon turns on judge whore now i'll say this there's been no allegations of this past he
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:58.080]  was you know past the time he got married and i don't think what he did was probably illegal but
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:04.400]  we don't know the issue here is the headlines are being run that revolutionary republicans
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:10.560]  trump supporting republicans libertarian republicans uh freedom caucus republicans are are stumbling
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:17.840]  are crippled are in deep trouble are are having huge problems dealing uh with the fact that all
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.640]  of this is unfolding and it hurts their brand alabama senate nightmare leaves republican
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:33.040]  revolutionaries spiraling wait hollywood has hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:38.800]  that have been caught engaged in pedophilia you name it you've got raping of children and none of
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:42.720]  them are even getting in trouble where are the indictments where the criminal arrest so again
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:48.240]  you have these two different yardsticks where conservatives find some bad apples or potentially
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:53.280]  bad apples and it's the end of the world and we all take on the guilt and it's our fault
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.680]  no it's not my fault judge roi moore may have been involved in some creepy behavior
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:05.920]  and all i'm saying is if you're going to have national news about the sexualization of teenage
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:14.160]  women 16 17 18 years old as low as maybe 14 which i think starts getting into the pedophilia zone
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:19.200]  you know serious serious serious issue not just statutory rape then we've got to look
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.880]  at the drag queen festival they had in Austin all these others where full grown men come up
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.920]  and shake their butts and little boys and little girls faces and then pose naked with only glitter
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:35.760]  on their genitals with little boys dressed up like girls and then kiss on them i mean i don't
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.280]  even want to show the photos again we showed that they posted on their own facebook of men with nothing
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:49.680]  on with little kids i mean if you're going to sit there and and notice none of the media picked
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:54.400]  that up mainly we were in Gavin Wentz's powerful report because they did it fairly they did it
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:59.920]  straight on they they were invited in it was there they said sure videotape it the group posted it
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.720]  to their own facebook and twitter there's hundreds of youtube videos the groups shot they were live
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.880]  streaming they were completely proud of men on stripper polls hanging down with three-year-old
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:17.280]  little white kids and black kids and little girls and boys walking over confused giving five dollar
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:28.640]  bills to obese men wearing thongs and garter belts and the media is like look jones is bashing
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:35.760]  uh drag queens because they're fat well yeah playboy was full of five hundred pound women
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.840]  you'd say what's wrong with playboy i mean that's the added thing is there's like a celebration of
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:45.760]  big fat men with wigs on with little kids giving them money when they're on stripper polls and the
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:51.360]  men are beyond twerking shaking their big butts and little kids faces man this is like something
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:13:01.840]  out of a pcp hallucination it's crazy it's absolutely insane that no media covered it
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:08.800]  except media matters run by george soros and david rock and they didn't say what i was talking about
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.440]  in their article they just had a little snip of me saying why are so many of these drag queens
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:19.280]  super fat i mean what is the issue so i was showing a transsexual libertarian lady uh
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:23.520]  what blare white that got beat up for wearing a make american redigan hat and i said where
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.400]  where are the ones that look like this this lady i'm just saying why is she a libertarian and then
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:34.560]  the liberal drag queens or transsexuals are super ugly i mean i have a right to say that
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.800]  the what is up with a bunch of ugly men dressed like women shaking their butts and little kids
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:44.800]  faces and i have a right to sit here and say then okay uh judge roi moore trolled them all
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:54.720]  and he admits that he dated teenagers i think that's creepy i think that's weird i don't think
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.360]  it's illegal but if some of the stuff's true and it's been put into question because they're
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:04.560]  democratic operatives and other things i i've got some serious serious questions and again
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:11.040]  it's not like i am the the ultimate puritan on the planet okay uh it's just that it shows a
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:17.200]  rested development in a man when he's 35 if he's going after 16 year old girls and then asking their
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:23.600]  parents if he can date them it just sounds like some type of weird netflix series about a creepy
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:29.200]  weird town or something i'm sorry now again hollywood's 10 times 20 times 100 times more creepy with
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:34.800]  devil worship and pedophilia and sexualization of children and targeting the family and targeting
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:41.680]  america and going after everybody so i am way more mad at them and then i'm even madder that the
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:47.600]  whole media is covering judge roi moore and some of his what appears to be creepy behavior versus the
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:53.440]  giant mountains of stuff they're involved in and joe biden groping little girls hundreds of times
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:58.320]  on television grabbing them taking control fathers reaching over and pushing him aside
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:05.760]  uh little little girls up there in the senate and here comes biden trying to grab on her
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:12.320]  and senator sessions slaps his hand that was only two years ago we've got the footage of that i mean
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:21.200]  this is crazy this is out of control this is the reality of what's going on and we have to face it
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:27.520]  and it freaks me out to go judge moore too i mean good god how many of these people are there
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:33.760]  what happened to them i mean i just had no idea there were so many people into children or into
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:39.120]  underage people and it makes me want to throw up and it wants me to find out why this is happening
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:45.440]  and it makes me want to stop it but is the republican libertarian revolution derailed if this is true
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:50.400]  that one guy was on the weird spectrum but not even in the pedophile spectrum so we're now all

[01:19:52.240 --> 01:20:01.920]  was so much coming up today you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:19.600]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:26.400]  part of the radio show today is live with me at studio at the watson as well from london
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:32.320]  the part of it is also taped while i take care of business in and around town but i will be back
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:37.840]  in studio here coming up in just a little while well you talk about hypocrisy and i want to be
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:44.400]  clear before the media spends this the fake news media the corporate media judge roymor involved
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:52.960]  himself in creepy behavior in his own admissions uh courting girls that were 14 15 16 17 years old
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:57.440]  i don't care if it was 35 years ago it was weird is it pedophilia
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:06.000]  no but it does border on very very serious creepiness and if he forced himself on some of
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.920]  these young women it would be statutory rape but they're not saying he raped them they're saying
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:15.280]  he tried to force himself on them so that would be sexual assault that said we have hours of footage
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:21.120]  of joe biden roping little girls and women on television on c span and at the white house on
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.160]  national television there's hours of it paul watson has an article out today where a secret service
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:33.840]  agent has come out uh and said that it was white steam level of women and teens well i don't need
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:38.640]  to know that from the secret service agent or others he does it on television how we got senator
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:44.320]  sessions swatting his hand away from a five-year-old girl on video i mean it's well known he's like
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:49.120]  white steam these people are completely entitled out of control we've got countless videos of
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:53.280]  fathers pushing his hand off their daughters i mean he grabs by the arm he pulls them into him
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:59.680]  he says you're gorgeous you're beautiful whispers in their ear more aggressively than i did to women
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:05.440]  in college that i wanted to pick up you know at a bar or wherever i mean i you know come over
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:09.680]  tell them they're gorgeous let's dance let's go have fun hey let's go see a movie let's you know
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:14.320]  what do you like to do for fun and only they looked interested when i started petting them on the arm
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:19.760]  it's like a 20-year-old woman not grabbing them by the arm i mean women with both of you did that so
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:28.560]  there's a super creepiness to this all i'm saying is if the republican party if the republican party
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:37.200]  is going to sit there and decry roy more and flip out about all this and act like it's in the world
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:43.280]  why are they so silent on bill clinton and on joe biden and on even wine steam we hardly hear from
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:47.040]  and the truth is because they're going to mainstream media and they know the mainstream
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:51.760]  media is aware of their scandals and a bunch of them have mistresses or gay or have been
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:59.520]  dating underage women or boys uh young men and or pedophilia member barney frank said everybody
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:04.480]  better stop investigating my three-story townhouse that they were running an underage brothel out of
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:10.000]  i mean 12 13-year-olds that was confirmed that was the low end most of them are like 16 17 it's
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.680]  criminal and he said i he said half the people in here are involved so you shut it down you shut
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:22.880]  it down now that's on c span and you know a lot of congressmen and folks have exposed it they end
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:29.200]  up dead so this is the secret society system they use to control people and all i'm saying is when
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:33.600]  we first heard he was telling people their daughters were pretty and all this they were 16 17 i thought
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:38.480]  a little creepy but now we're hearing all this other stuff it's bad news and the republicans
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:43.840]  are calling him judge roi whore and that's the headline on drugs you know is you know judge whore
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:49.840]  banning turning on judge whore and now the media is branding it like conservatives are to blame
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:53.840]  and that conservatives are now discredited and the whole libertarian moob is discredited because we
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:24:00.000]  got one guy trying to ask out girls that are underage you got biden telling them they're sexy
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.440]  and they're pretty when they're eight years old on video and and patin on their butts and feeling
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:10.720]  all over them and some of the parents come over go whoa dude and then like push him off we've shown
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:16.240]  the footage we've covered it but the media never picks it up but paul watson has a bunch of examples
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:22.720]  posted in his article x secret service agent claims biden engaged in winestein level
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.880]  groping how far are we into this live feed we are four minutes fantastic because i'm gonna go another
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.640]  four or five minutes to finish up for this segment that i'm gonna continue on for everybody watching
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:35.760]  live and we will air this on the radio later as well because what i do is when i got families to
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.000]  take care of or whatever i'll tend to come in and take part of the show early or have guest
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.480]  tests on but there's so much breaking news i'm going to be popping in and out today live and
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:50.880]  live feeds i'm going to do that will also end up being taped up here on the radio so here it is
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:56.240]  x secret service agent claims biden engaged in winestein level groping of women and teens
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:01.440]  quote it was horrible well that's that's part of the course here so all i'm saying is if we're
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:07.040]  going to have a national conniption fit over judge roi moore that we don't have video doing any of
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:12.560]  this and a lot of it's been proven to be untrue and political operatives but more admits he was
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:19.280]  pursuing 16 year olds i got 35 i mean i'm sorry i think that's creepy but it's kind of an old
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:23.120]  timey thing it's going to muslims do where well before your daughter gets runs off with the wrong
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:28.720]  guy you know let me know see if the if the young prosecutor you know wants to end up marrying your
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:33.760]  daughter when they're 18 that is an old southern thing people used to get married they were 13
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.640]  on the wagon trails uh you know founding fathers some of them had 16 year old wives
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:45.280]  the point is is that back then development wasn't arrested you were doing chores when you were
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:50.000]  five years old shooting guns when you were five years old and as soon as you went into puberty
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.120]  a few years uh families would try to get you with an up and coming successful man
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:00.960]  show that you would be well placed the muslims do it to the extreme and i don't like all that
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:07.360]  orthodox stuff so that's where i stand as a father of three daughters man and there's some 35 year
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:11.840]  old man came around and wanted to date my daughter when she's 16 i got a 14 and a nine year old
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.480]  daughter and i've got a six month old daughter i say listen man that's creepy get the hell out of
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:22.320]  here the argument is okay well your 16 year old daughter probably date gangbangers and you know
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.200]  and end up getting you know i mean i understand the whole mindset of you know what your daughter
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:32.320]  brings home a white supremacist maybe or a or a thug or a prisoner a prison guy or a gangbanger
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:39.440]  or a drug dealer that's where this comes from this fear of rural conservatives uh that if
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:46.240]  you could introduce your you know young daughter to the 25 year old guy whose daddy owns a lumber
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:52.400]  yard well she's going to be well placed that's where this comes from i'm not defending it i'm
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:58.160]  not supporting it what i'm saying is we have bill clinton we have joe bight we have a winesteen
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:03.120]  not indicted yet we have all this off the radar now but the hundreds of convicted pedophiles
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:09.040]  still working in hollywood and all of it and the only thing on the radar is judge roy more
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:14.800]  meanwhile al frankin joins the house intelligence committee hearing we had last week this is the
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:20.800]  senate calling for all conservative media to be banned off social media twitter facebook google
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:27.600]  youtube all of it because we're russians they call ram paul a russian they've called everybody a
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:31.680]  russian they've called me a russian agent they've called trump that they've called matt rouges that
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:36.400]  they've called uh tugger curls and that i mean this is the globalist socialist that wants to
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:43.120]  recreate soviet russia here in america that article is on drugsreport dot com dr rim coursey
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:48.480]  very important to read meanwhile other big serious news black death plague ravaging

[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:12.320]  we're now witnessing the birth pangs of a sexual reformation before out from the sex abuse scandals
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:16.960]  that have plagued the entertainment industry politics and are now spreading throughout society
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:22.640]  as a whole is being hijacked by the far left cultural marxists feminists and social justice
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:28.560]  warriors to whip up more miss andry and create more gender division third wave feminism has been
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:35.760]  largely discredited over the past five years just 18 percent of women in the us now identify as
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:42.720]  feminists even less in the uk and it's obvious why now that rights which actual feminists fought for
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:48.320]  a hundred years ago have been achieved they're left with what making sourdough bread out of their
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:55.680]  vaginal yeast yeah really while it's sorely needed in the islamic world the west needs feminism like
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:00.400]  a fish needs a bicycle which is why third wave feminists and social justice warriors need to
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:07.680]  constantly invent or hijack new outrages to push their primary narrative hating men which is why
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:13.200]  they're now hijacking the moral panic surrounding the sex abuse scandal in a desperate effort to
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:19.920]  resurrect the failed ideology of third wave feminism as part of a catastrophically damaging plan
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:27.120]  to impose a new onerous form of sexual puritanism the preeminence of innocent until proven guilty
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:33.680]  is being jettisoned now mere accusation alone is enough to ruin someone's career do you understand
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:38.720]  how dangerous that is roymor has vehemently denied the allegations against him but to the
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:44.560]  baying mob allegations are all that's required to pass judgment now don't get me wrong if sexual
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:50.240]  abuse is admitted or proven these people should be punished to the full extent of the law and as
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:55.120]  my regular viewers will know i've been the most vehement out of anyone calling for hollywood
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:01.920]  and political pedo rings to be exposed but trial by social media mob outrage isn't justice and it
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:07.440]  sets a horrific precedent everything is being conflated to the point where making a passer a
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:13.040]  woman is placed in the same context as actual sexual assault as laura prender gas writes in
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:18.480]  the spectator women are jumping on the hashtag me too bandwagon so they can smother themselves in
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:25.440]  attention seeking victimhood not because they're actual victims but in one case because a man looked
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:30.560]  at them another storm was whipped up over adam sandler touching a woman's knee on a talk show
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:39.920]  took so i took my parents just like in another instance an mp was outed after he called a woman
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:45.840]  attractive intelligent and charming another case involved michael fallon trying to kiss a woman no
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:50.880]  there's a world of difference between looking at someone complimenting them trying to kiss them
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:56.880]  trying to touch them on the knee and raping them big difference as a result of the comparatively
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:03.680]  innocuous allegations against him call sergeant committed suicide was found dead yesterday just
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:08.880]  a few days after he was dismissed from his post as cabinet secretary for communities and children
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:13.680]  the family wish to disclose the fact that carl maintained his innocence and he categorically
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:19.200]  denied any wrongdoing the distress of not being able to defend himself properly against these
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:25.760]  unspecified allegations meant he was not afforded common courtesy decency or natural justice you
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:32.400]  can't make the cost of sexual interest not being reciprocated the complete ruination of a man's
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:38.960]  career his reputation and even his life you can't brand someone who sent a risque text or made a
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:45.920]  clumsy advance a pervert or a molester there has to be a clear distinction between that and actual
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:51.920]  sexual assault there has to be an understanding that accusation alone isn't proof we have to put
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:58.400]  a check on this cult of instantly believing the accuser without any regard for evidence any woman
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:06.160]  who reports an assault should be heard and believed the new feminist crusade is about
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:12.320]  indoctrinating women to advocate victimhood rather than equality the hysteria of widespread
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:18.320]  sexual assault is moving us back to a chaperone culture a modesty culture from proposals to
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:24.400]  segregate trains to banning scantily clad women in advertisements to modesty wear on catwalks the
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:30.400]  irony is that we're moving closer to how islamic societies treat women we're mimicking the most
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:35.840]  misogynistic places on earth and what pisses me off the most is that these same feminists now
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:42.720]  hijacking this scandal to legitimize their crusade against straight white men have for years now
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:48.560]  ignored the fact that we're importing a real rape culture in the form of mass islamic immigration
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:54.480]  a policy that has resulted in women being molested on mass on numerous different occasions cologne
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:59.600]  germany where large crowds of what police describe as arab men began sexually assaulting
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:04.800]  terrified young women dozens of men surrounded her and her female friends touching them everywhere
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:10.000]  sex attacks by migrants against women in multiple european countries are skyrocketing what did
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.200]  feminists have to say about that nothing in cologne feminists responded to the mass molestation of
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:22.080]  women by migrants on new years eve 2015 by visiting the local migrant center and handing out roses
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:27.840]  something sinister is happening whereas the rules and dogma of sexual morality were once
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:34.160]  enforced by religious groups they're now being enforced by feminists this is a sexual counter
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:40.320]  revolution and sex-negative feminists are the new puritans young men in the west have already had
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:46.640]  their confidence decimated by years of being hectic about toxic masculinity years of lies and
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:51.680]  smears about a college rape culture that was completely exaggerated many young men are now
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:57.280]  growing up terrified of even approaching women for fear of being seen as predatory this actually
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:03.200]  serves to fuel the online hookup culture where mindless sex is understood as the common outcome
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:09.600]  but it's ultimately disastrous for stable strong long-lasting relationships men are being lectured
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.880]  like little boys born with original sin about what behaviors are acceptable case in point this
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:20.640]  article 20 things men can do right the fuck now to support women beyond just literally
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:26.160]  ceasing to sexually harass us this feminist just brazenly exploits the whole me too hashtag
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:32.240]  outpouring to demand all men become deranged social justice warriors to make up for it support
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:38.960]  abortion shut up stop watching non-ethical porn support black lives matter don't use pejorative
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:44.240]  terms like sjw and feminazi this is what i'm talking about you don't want to be like all those evil
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:50.080]  sexual abusers do you oh well you better sign on to all my guide to helping men it's a manifesto
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:56.080]  for torturing them feminist lindy west was given a platform by the new york times to make the same
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:02.720]  twisted argument men are evil and sexist and they need to repent by embracing all my political
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:08.800]  viewpoints men 1963 to 2016 why are feminists such man haters men 2017 oh you see what they're trying
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:13.520]  to do right men are being brow beaten into accepting blame for the entirety of the sexual
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:19.040]  abuse scandal just because they happen to have the same genitals as the abusers the question is not
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:26.480]  are we sexist it is do we know that we are sexist we are all complicit in this as men no all men
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:32.320]  are not complicit you collect to this piece of i'm not complicit in louis e k masturbating in
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:37.040]  front of women i'm not complicit in harvey weinstein groping women i'm not complicit in kevin
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:42.960]  spacey sexually molesting boys and neither are all men the vast majority of men have never done
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:48.560]  anything like that and never will why are all men being blamed when the real blame should lie at the
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:53.920]  feet of those within these industries who covered up and turned a blind eye to what they knew was
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:59.920]  going on for decades and isn't it interesting how we're being told to hyper focus on certain people
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:08.640]  and not others look when you castigate an entire gender for the actions of a relative few you
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:14.640]  don't create more respect for women you create resentment and more division between the sexes
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:21.200]  you create hypocritical virtue signaling soyboy male feminists who invariably turn out to be abusers
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:27.280]  of women having lectured us for years about how misogynistic we are this whole hysteria is being
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:33.520]  exploited by postmodernists to resurrect the idea that men the patriarchy and ultimately the capitalist
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:38.960]  system itself is a perverse architecture of oppression that needs to be torn down let's not
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:45.120]  be naive sexual abuse is abhorrent but if you're gonna claim that some women don't sleep their way
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:51.600]  to the top you're a liar sorry if that offends you but it's true and it doesn't mean that all women
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:58.240]  are slugs it's also true that some men abuse their power to bully women into sex but that doesn't
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:04.160]  mean that all men are would-be rapists fact is power is an aphrodisiac and a lot of women throw
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:10.480]  themselves at powerful men this leads powerful men to believe that they can just have any woman
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:17.440]  and that's when they run into trouble men don't be don't shout at women in the streets don't invade
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:24.080]  their personal space don't treat them like idiots respect wow but equally don't self cast rate just
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:29.680]  because you've been told to feel guilty by some fat control freak femis about something Harvey
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:35.680]  Weinstein did that's got nothing to do with you don't adopt far left political views as some twisted
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:42.560]  form of reparations just to satisfy some artistically screeching social justice warrior don't feel ashamed

[01:45:51.760 --> 01:46:00.480]  with so much coming up today america is an information-based civil war that's why now more
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:05.840]  than ever we've got to hit the streets of america and let these globalists scum know we're not backing
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:11.840]  down from their bullying we're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:18.640]  dictatorship being a conservative a nationalist a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:26.400]  is truly the counterculture the real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro america pro capitalism
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:32.560]  and pro freedom who at the same time is tolerant modern liberalism is a counterfeit of thomas
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:39.120]  geverson's classical liberalism they are the anti-liberal to defend free speech meet like-minded

[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:51.040]  t-shirts for men and women as well as more patriot feral at info war store dot com be part of the
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:47:14.960]  second american revolution at info war store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:25.520]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones i'm asking the listeners
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:33.040]  and viewers of this transmission to do something that i myself forget to do often and that's to
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:42.480]  really sit back and look at the world and think of where we were just five years ago versus where
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:49.600]  we are today if you talked about world government or the eu army they would say you were insane it
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:54.000]  didn't exist if you talked about the private federal reserve they would either say the
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.320]  federal reserve doesn't exist or that it's public now everyone knows it's private and running the
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:09.840]  government and now anyone who is halfway informed knows that president trump is taking control away
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:15.840]  from these multinational groups and has killed the tpp and brought sovereignty back but trump is
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:24.640]  only one manifestation of this global awakening you are the heart the blood the guts the bones the
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:33.600]  sweat the tears the eyes the legs the feet the arms but most importantly the soul of humanity
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:39.360]  you are humanity and hollywood and the globalists have done everything they can to try to poison
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:45.200]  humanity and to try to turn us against each other but more and more people are coming out of their
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:50.800]  trance and they're seeing through it when i say humanity is that a critical
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:59.920]  determinative crossroads all of you instinctively already know what to be true i'm only saying
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:07.040]  things that you already know at your gut level at a spiritual level at an economic level
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:14.320]  at an intellectual level and so we know what's happening we understand what's going on
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:19.760]  and the globalists have now gone from denying their global program to now having to admit
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:31.360]  their program which is a very austere anti-human neo feudalistic artificial dark age meant to
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:40.720]  suppress technological development and economic development for aspiring humans it is the ultimate
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:47.760]  class system assaulting language assaulting families assaulting fathers assaulting mothers it is
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:59.200]  clearly and admittedly a cold-blooded scientific takeover system meant to destabilize humanity
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:06.880]  poison humanity dumb humanity down and then phase us out through slow motion soft kill
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:14.160]  population reduction and that's really the overriding message here that this is a fight
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:21.680]  for our lives this is a life and death struggle against the globalist and we all need to just
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:28.240]  continually reassess the fact that we have a purpose driven life and the purpose driven life
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:32.880]  is to be strong to stand up for what's right to build a better future for our children and a better
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:38.480]  world for all our children to live together in and if that's the case then we have to focus on the
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:45.280]  technocracy and what their goal is and we have to face the true horrors of the program if we're
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:51.440]  ever going to have a chance to beat it but the good news is despite the fact that this program
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:56.080]  is so incredibly evil and people had trouble believing it was real now that it's been forced
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:03.440]  out in the open humanity is assessing the crisis and assessing the obstacles and very very quickly
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:09.920]  developing systems and mass movements based on individual action that will bring this technocracy
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:16.240]  down the social engineers of the new world order want you to live in a haze they want you to sleep
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:20.400]  they want to be able to engineer your life and use you as a human resource cog
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:28.400]  and as humanity awakens they are intensifying their propaganda they're intensifying their cultural
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:34.320]  war they're intensifying their sabotage with electromagnetic radiation and toxins in the
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:42.320]  food and water in an attempt to bully you back into submission so i ask you now to reflect on
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:53.040]  the fact of how important you are and how incredibly central it is that you redouble your efforts
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:52:00.080]  to spread the word and to speak out and to take action and to expose the globalist but to also
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:08.400]  then offer a better system which is the classic americana judaeo christian ethos that has made
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:13.520]  us so successful but if we're going to preserve our republic and preserve our planet and have a
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:21.120]  way forward into all the incredible things that we're already discovering we're going to have
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:26.560]  to admit to ourselves that the globalists are here that they don't intend in cohabitating with us
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:34.000]  and that they want to reduce world population forcibly so that they can inherit the earth
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.120]  and all the spoils for themselves and that doesn't mean that we aren't overpopulated in some areas it
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:45.840]  doesn't mean that humanity isn't fallen and quite frankly disgusting in many ways it's simply
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:51.600]  realizing that the very worst of us are the ones that realize this and are taking advantage
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:56.800]  of the weakness to get full control when those are the very types of people that have already
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:03.120]  engineered the system to make the public servile wicked corrupt stupid and lazy
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:10.880]  the very worst of us are opportunistically making the crises as bad as they can and getting powerful
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:16.720]  and wealthy off of it at the expense of all of humanity and all the life on the planet and us
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:23.200]  individually that's why we must oppose hollywood we must oppose the big central banks we must
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:29.280]  oppose the communist systems in china we must oppose the new world order we must empower humanity
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:35.200]  again we must promote systems that make families strong again we must rediscover what makes us
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:45.520]  strong god liberty justice freedom hard work focus truth and together we can survive and thrive and
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:50.640]  go to the stars together but the globalists want you to believe in dystopia that's why every movie
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:56.640]  every show every system they put out is about a dystopia so you accept a nightmare future instead
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:54:04.960]  of taking the undripped of amazing future that we can all have together if we are simply strong now
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:10.320]  and stand up for what's right and by the way the globalists sell the idea that being involved in
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:16.960]  being passionate is tiring and disempowering it's the opposite the animating contest of liberty
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:23.920]  is what will fulfill you the journey towards a better world in a better universe is the destination
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:34.480]  our imperfection is our perfection the great arc of human development is the vision in god's mind
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:40.560]  but his creatures have free will and must decide to dance to the music he's playing
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:45.520]  must decide to accept the world he's offered that we build
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:56.960]  we are god's nano tech we could build anything we can do anything we're made in his image
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:05.600]  the globalists know that they want to hoard that knowledge for themselves and go into the future
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:12.640]  alone without us so you should know those decisions are being made without you and they use terms
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:17.600]  like conspiracy theory so that you won't look into it so you'll be lazy whether it's human
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:22.320]  animal chimeras or human brains and rats we told you about 20 years ago or fluoride lowering
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:28.160]  IQs and babies everything we told you is now being admitted because they can't hide it anymore
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:32.480]  because enough people have actually gone out and researched we've already reached critical mass to a
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:39.680]  great extent and all the pushback we see is the desperate death rows of the globalist so again
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:43.440]  thank you all for being part of m4 wars and thank you all for standing strong for justice and thank
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:49.600]  you all for supporting what we do here because without you ladies and gentlemen without your
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:58.080]  action without your will without your spiritual love of god without your prayers without your
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:05.840]  connection and all of us coming together we don't have a prayer but if we do come together
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:12.480]  nothing on earth can stop us because god will work through us i'm alex jones for news wars.com
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:18.320]  prisonplanet.com and m4 wars.com it is an act of rebellion against the globalist it is an act of
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:25.200]  absolute military resistance against their global government operation when you spread
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:29.600]  the articles in the videos and when you pray for us and when you tell your friends family and
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:33.440]  neighbors about the different ways they can tune in and when you financially support us
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:40.960]  everything i do is a non-zero sum game everything i stand for is a total win-win everything i am

[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:56.640]  do unto others as you have do unto you is simply common sense to have a civilization
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:00.960]  and there have been people that have been using the fact that we're good against us
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:05.840]  and now they've tried to bully us into submission through political correctness to tell us that
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:12.880]  we're actually the bad people the new world order is already fallen it knows it's fallen
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:18.800]  it believes that it can take you down and sit on a mountain of your skulls that it will become god
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.840]  when all they ever had to do was reach out and they would touch god the moment they open the door
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:32.480]  but they can't open the door because they're of their father the devil and all those that hate

[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:14.000]  like a mind control we asked why they're so dumb why they're so weird why they act so mentally ill
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:19.760]  why they're such bad soldiers these are really autistic victims from what we found you were
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:25.600]  actually on your own saying this this is the army of mordor and it makes you feel sad almost for
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:30.960]  them that we actually care about their future and they hate us can you speak to that we were saying
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:36.000]  yeah basically you know what i see is i see a lot of uneducated younger generation that
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:41.200]  they don't have a leader they don't have somebody to follow maybe they don't have a
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:44.960]  father figure in the house or something like that so what they're doing is they're looking to
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:51.520]  you know this this alternative and they're being they're not being educated they're not
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:56.480]  taking a look at what a mars uh you know these these other generations have done you know before
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:02.080]  them we're we're talking about you know back in 1917 and so on and so forth you know during uh
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:07.600]  just before the war and what's happening is history's repeating itself and it's going straight
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:13.520]  back to where it was back then where you have a generation of people that are uneducated
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:17.920]  and i'm and i don't mean you know they're they're not learning in school or they're not smart they
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:21.680]  can do electronics they're not historically they're not street smart right they're not and
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:25.920]  they're not they're not looking they're not looking up you know what the history is all about
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:32.400]  and actually learning what happened in history and we are destined to repeat the same thing
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:35.840]  and when you when you approach them and you say hey do you know what a march this movement is do
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:39.920]  you know what this is do you know what that is they don't even know they're in it they don't and
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:44.880]  that's the biggest thing they're shock troops bolshevik revolution 100 years later like you said
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:48.880]  and they don't even know they don't they don't and they're being pushed into this because
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:54.720]  they don't want to look for the information themselves read about it understand it so they're
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:59.600]  being put into this because one you know maybe talk about mind control they're soldiers for
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:05.760]  george soros and the globalist and communist and don't even know it and tifa how can you say
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:10.320]  you're anti-fascist when you're doing the fascist things it doesn't it doesn't make sense you know
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:15.760]  i just not letting people into the inauguration beating up women and and they're doing it every day
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:20.560]  and they're accusing us of doing it but yet they do it every day it doesn't make any sense
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:25.280]  so when you look at a person like that you have to say there's there's some sort of mental instability
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:30.560]  there for you to even do what you're doing and and take the position that you take so
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:36.320]  i don't know um obviously we're still winning this fight but uh i agree we're winning intellectually
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:40.160]  what do you think's coming over for it they say they're going to kill cops burn things blow stuff
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:45.520]  up i think it's going to be a dud hopefully i think it's going to be a dud and the reason
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:49.440]  they may stand out there and they may say this they may say that but at the end of the day they're
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:53.600]  going to cover their face they're going to bring a couple little sticks with them and uh the first
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:58.640]  time that they throw a punch and everybody else goes after them they're going to run off that's
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:02.480]  all they're going to pull that mask off their face pull the mask off their face but then they'll
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:06.480]  get some mental patient they wound up to run somebody over the car well that whole thing in
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:12.800]  virginia was government run absolutely that that that made no sense he just that whole thing was
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:18.560]  well the goodness is to stir things up that's all it is alex it's that which doesn't kill us only

[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:18.880]  was it difficult not not at all not at all it maybe as a child you don't you don't see the
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:26.480]  connection it created no no problem at all no feeling of guilt no well actually funny way
[02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:33.920]  it's just like in markets that if i weren't there somebody else would would would be taking it away
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:38.640]  anyhow and it was the whether i was there or not the property was being taken away
[02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:46.320]  so i had no sense of guilt defending the republic from enemies orn and domestic
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:58.000]  it's alex jones
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:05.680]  so
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:16.800]  get me roger stone oh wait i can't get a hold of roger stone because he's been suspended from
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:24.400]  twitter i'm getting no signal from it sir and sjw trolls have been bragging and fighting over who
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:31.120]  gets to take credit over roger stone being suspended from twitter now let's take a look at these
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:39.520]  controversial tweets that roger stone tweeted that landed him in twitter jail at dawn lemon
[02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:47.120]  stop lying about the clinton's and uranium you ignorant lying cough sucker you fake news you
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:53.600]  dumb piece of s*** i picture roger stone sitting there flipping through his television coming across
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:08:01.440]  cnn fake news and hearing dawn lemon spew more bs and lies and i think he just really kind of lost
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:08.640]  it and just had to give it to him on twitter when atn t acquires time warner the house cleaning at
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:19.040]  cnn of human excrement like dawn lemon jake tapper and dumb s*** annadavaro will be swift but wait
[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:25.600]  it's not like any of these tweets even violate twitter's rules so let's see what these sjw's
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:30.640]  are bragging about and claiming how they got roger stone's twitter account suspended in the
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:39.600]  first place the first tweet claiming to have taken the great roger stone down is by david a wood
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:49.360]  a snarky passionate advocate for acceptance inclusion and humanitarianism i'm sorry but
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:55.040]  your description offends me itself so maybe i should just flag your account right now i have
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:09:01.440]  reported this tweet which appears to encourage harm be brought to someone so apparently encouraging
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:09.440]  harm to be brought on someone is calling them a pile of human excrement or a dumb or a dumb lying
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:16.160]  piece of s*** so calling somebody names you don't like is somehow inciting violence it's not like
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:21.840]  other people aren't calling for donald trump's death on a daily basis i don't see twitter
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:27.840]  suspending their accounts these sjw's are out of control because after all remember words are
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:32.720]  violence you know i don't know about you but i would rather somebody call me names than
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:39.920]  punch me in the face then we have an sjw claiming that this troll used to be nominated for a nobel
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:46.320]  peace prize due to the selfless sacrifice you've made here tonight this is what happens when every
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:52.000]  kid gets a trophy in school you should get trophies now for being trolls on the internet not for
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  actually you know discovering the cure for cancer creating world peace no being a troll on the internet
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:03.360]  getting roger stone kicked off nobel peace prize for you so of course we have other sjw's claiming
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:12.480]  i have done the same i did too me too ditto i'm reporting to this well it's full of harassment
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:20.320]  towards mr levin and i do find it kind of fitting that don levin's last name is a lemon someone sold
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:34.000]  us 11 but wait a minute isn't calling him a douchebag a sexist misogynist term that she gets you
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  violated from twitter yourself hmm you did the right thing david might have saved a life
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:49.200]  i'm sorry save the life aren't we getting a little bit dramatic
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:08.320]  i'm sorry but how the heck is netflix promoting roger stone by doing a hit piece propaganda film
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:15.840]  about him but wait we have another person letting the original troll know he reported mr
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:25.760]  stone first i reported it before i saw your tweet now this one really takes the cake this
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:32.160]  again is from the original troll that decided to take credit for getting roger stone suspended
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:40.880]  from twitter he later tweets notice self don't gloat it isn't pretty yes he has been bombarded
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:48.720]  with trolls and we're talking sjw trolls saying no i did it first i get the nobel peace prize
[02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:55.680]  i get the trophy hypocrite much double standard much or just liberal logic
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:12:04.800]  all right for the rest of the hour tim county my good buddy green beret patria ufc fighter
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:09.600]  talk show host host of an investigator on hunting hitler is with us and i was trying
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:13.600]  to get him on a month ago about hunting hitlers the third season was coming out he said uh i you
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:19.760]  know i gotta wait but then this weekend i'm on his twitter and i'm on my feet and i see okay i
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:22.800]  didn't read these new documents out of the jfk stuff but sure enough i went to the national
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:29.280]  archives there it was hitler and 55 photographed in argentina like everybody always said they found
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:36.560]  the witnesses the old submarine german mansions built in the middle of mountains uh i mean wow
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:41.760]  now you can't tell us the new stuff this is a short segment coming up you're telling me tim
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:46.880]  kennedy this is dead on yeah well we've we've known it for a long time people suspected it but
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:52.960]  we have real real evidence like you cannot deny the proof that we found we you can't deny the
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:58.160]  documents that are being released so so third season is the total money shot of a hit show
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:04.320]  we found things that people have been looking for for 75 years and we found actual you found
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:09.280]  the submarine is all that stuff i mean yeah i mean a real u-boat with the capabilities of
[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:13.360]  transporting high but there's germans everywhere i mean they admit a lot of them did go over there
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:20.160]  we had the operation paper club here yeah we the fascists the the enemy of our friend or
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:26.080]  the what how does it go or are the enemy our friend's enemy is our friend yes yes yes it's
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:31.200]  it's the enemy of my enemies my friend yeah there we go we hate socialism we hate communism i still
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:37.200]  do uh and in the south we we found that fascism was an opportunity to fight communism growing in
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:44.080]  venezuela and argentina so these fascist dictators we we maybe even helped and uh we we found real
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:49.600]  evidence of what they're doing and how they're doing it it's frightening incredible but i mean
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:55.040]  how is it hunting hitler comes out a few years ago it's a top show on history channel and then
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:00.320]  now right as it's about to come out cia files as he tried to block hitler it was alive down there
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:06.320]  do you have any idea how old he was when he died or where he may be buried well first of all
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:11.680]  well first of all thanks for the cia for releasing that 30 days before the tv show comes out that's
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:17.680]  fantastic work i had all the totals to do with that no um you know whether he died in that bunker
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:23.200]  where he didn't we we took a different approach for this season we did the exact same thing that
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:27.680]  everybody's done in the past 10 years searching for terrorists we the way that we caught bin
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:34.640]  laudan the way that we caught zarkawi we looked at their network we we followed the information
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:39.520]  the trails and the evidence um of the people that were facilitating these high-level nazis
[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:47.200]  guys like uh scorsensky guys like um joseph mangley um lost barbie yeah claus bore perfect example
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:52.240]  we we we trailed those guys from where they left germany how they came into argentina
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:57.360]  where they lived who was in charge and by that we brought in this girl nadia she was
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:03.200]  crucial she was one of the most important cia targeters that worked in finding bin laudan
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:08.720]  and findings zarkawi that brought down the al qaeda network in 2006 we brought her in specifically
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:16.080]  to do targeting for these nazis in the 40s and the 50s and even into the 60s and 70s in south america
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:22.560]  and we you know what that makes sense now that i think about it look for other nazis and then
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:27.120]  track back where they came from that's going to find where hitler at least landed they can try to
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:32.640]  track where he went yeah the you can't just look for the man that the man disappeared south america
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:38.480]  is a massive beautiful country and uh when you got uruguay perigway chili brazil all of them
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:43.840]  friendly to fascism to nazis on the run it's like trying to find a needle in the whole continent
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:47.760]  yeah but we just took the whole entire haystack we burnt that to the ground and then we just picked
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:52.720]  up that nice little piece of metal and said got you wow we'll be right back with tem kennedy

[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:41.360]  now here on air tim kennedy tim kennedy mmma.com twitter tim kennedy mmma facebook tim kennedy
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:45.760]  mmma doing so much more as you said mmma is just one part of the great work you do
[02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:49.680]  in the military i know it's been in the news you've re-enlisted i know that's all
[02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:53.360]  classifieds we can't get into it but now you're doing a lot of important work
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:57.760]  probably better you just leave the conversations but don't get anything secret you're doing
[02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:01.920]  but it's right in the middle of it you're the main investigator of many other great ones on
[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:08.880]  hunting hitler right as the cia files get declassified partly on friday fully on saturday
[02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:14.480]  saying okay hitler's alive 95 here's the photos here's where he's at here's what's going on what
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:20.400]  do we do nothing happens you were telling me during the break why nothing happened it's a
[02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:25.600]  bummer part you know when you look at hitler he's a horrible disgusting evil human that killed
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:32.240]  millions and millions of people you know 10 20 million people and the acts that he committed we
[02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:37.440]  can't overlook and can never be forgiven you know fascism should never exist in any capacity
[02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:42.800]  but at the same time at the end of the war in 1945 there's no question what the next
[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:49.840]  worry was the next enemy is going to be communism and when you have mal killing you know 45 million
[02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:55.440]  people and then stalling at the last conservative yeah yeah the lowest estimates for for mal in
[02:21:55.440 --> 02:22:00.000]  the 45 millions up to 100 million if you look at stalling the lowest estimate the 20 million up to
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:06.400]  65 million so while yes hitler's a horrible thing we have the founder that's a monster that's already
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:11.600]  defeated yeah hitler's gone he's dead fascism is not going to be rising again and we know that but
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:18.240]  we know the great threat is now the red threat the communist threat that is trying to infiltrate into
[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:23.920]  asia it's trying to make it its way into south america already had hollywood it completely by
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:30.160]  by the balls it is indian in in north using soviet sex operatives yeah and we had to fight
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:36.800]  with the most vicious fire that we could get our hands on and that was fascism so and that's why you
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:41.920]  have the rat line and paperclip but then hitler obviously the really bad ones we know they actually
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:45.360]  set the south america they were kind of on their own that's what everybody always knew they made
[02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:50.400]  movies about it but to see the rumors true and then you're the guy that has the big tv show
[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:56.800]  investigating it yeah you know unless i have hitler's body i can't say here's the smoking gun
[02:22:56.800 --> 02:23:02.000]  this is what happened eight off hitler what i know is the high ranking nazis made it out of south
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:07.120]  america or they made it out of germany into south america and in south america while they're there
[02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:12.240]  they were being used for a multitude of reasons to include fighting communism communism and socialism
[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:18.640]  and we you know why wasn't the jfk files you know that's that's why is anything about hitler in the
[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:23.520]  jfk files well the jfk files are fighting communism that's what they're about if you look at what was
[02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:29.200]  happening in cuba and and you know even maybe the potential assassin who he was working for
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:33.520]  who he was talking to where he was going to be defecting to it all comes down to communism
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:40.240]  and hitler is in those files because he and the rest of the nazi party were a great tool in the
[02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:46.080]  fight of communism post-war war two fascism's gone we defeated the germany and we know deals were
[02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:50.080]  almost made at the very end of world war two to actually merge with the germans and take on the
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:58.080]  soviets then patin wanted to do that one reason he was assassin then yeah there's 1945 was the
[02:23:58.080 --> 02:24:02.240]  beginning of our next biggest greatest war which we're still fighting now which is the war against
[02:24:02.240 --> 02:24:06.480]  communism the war war against socialism and macArthur wanted to end it a few years later in
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:13.840]  1953 they removed him when he was about to beat the the chinese in korea we've never truly defeated
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:20.000]  the communist ideals and i don't know for what reason we have had multiple opportunities where
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:27.360]  we could have crushed them but we just kind of let them exist and uh or it perpetuates i don't
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:32.320]  know the war and now antifa is literally they don't deserve that name by the way because they're
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:37.600]  not antifascists no they're not america was yeah america is yeah yeah just just say america like
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:40.960]  if you want to fight fascism if you want to fight socialism if you want to fight communism just say
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:45.120]  you're american because that's that's what we are we don't burn flags we don't take a knee when that
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:49.520]  when the beautiful national you don't ban people's free speech we don't wear black uniforms that's
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:55.200]  communism fascism so again i mean so so obviously they they're communists they know they're communist
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:59.200]  a lot of them don't even know who they are they claim they're going to cause civil war this weekend i
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:04.480]  think it's going to be a dud guy i mean it's going to be a dud because they're they're incapable and
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:09.360]  that they're impenitent little children that they have no idea even what they're fighting for
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:13.360]  or how to fight so the fact that they think that they're going to show up and be able to overthrow
[02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:17.920]  a government that there's men like me and there's thousands tens of thousands of men like me that
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:22.000]  love america that are better barrel trusted freedom fighters that we think that that we're just going
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:26.560]  to allow you to come on it on some arbitrary day on november 4th and be like all right we're going
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:30.160]  to get rid of this pence and trump group not going to happen and that's my next point you made a
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:36.240]  great point in your own words about this Mueller indictment or indictments yeah it's uh you want
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:40.400]  to talk about during the swamp everybody's talking about Mueller and like oh this special
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:46.160]  investigator he's really pulling the lid off now no everything that he is showing he is exposing
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:51.600]  the true corruption and the fact that trump was able to fire this man months after he hired him
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:56.400]  realizing that he did not fit in with the values and the ethics and the the things that he wants
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:26:02.800]  to perpetuate into what is now this beautiful administration um Mueller is really showing
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:09.200]  that podesta and the collusion with the russians had nothing to do with trump and the fact that he's
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:15.360]  making these arrests and these indictments even more supporting what we already know that yeah
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:20.080]  it's not filing tax forms and then they call that money laundering when he was running whole
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:24.320]  campaigns in europe that were pro america and then he was the guy that was the pay master
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:27.840]  and they're claiming those transactions were fraudulent because they didn't follow tax forms
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:34.560]  in the u.s when they were firing tax forms no these are any interaction that or collusion that
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:40.320]  happened was way before trump and now the fact that trump got rid of him before anything ever
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:45.200]  happened with him is is just another indication that um there's nothing more that this is going to
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:50.800]  be exactly this is their big shot this is muller hit us with everything he's got and all he's hoping
[02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:56.080]  is manifold and and rich and others get scared and then say okay i'll say whatever you want
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:27:03.200]  yeah with with what's being revealed about with gps and hillard clinton and what manifold is coming
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:09.840]  revealing that there was multiple opportunities for collusion but none of it had to do with trump
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:15.920]  all it's doing is exposing all of the other evil things that our politicians were doing so this is
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:20.560]  just a great i don't know if it's strategic but it might be a flawless execution on trump and his
[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:28.800]  administration to really show how uh dirty and evil and corrupt hillary and the rest of those
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:32.720]  administrations and politics were you were saying to me during the break they're kind of draining
[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:37.440]  themselves yeah and inadvertently they're like oh look what we just found we got a great indictment
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:42.320]  i was like you realize you're blowing the lid off yourself and you're exposing that one truck and
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:46.480]  that's the thing i don't just put a positive spin on things to feel good everything's starting to go
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:51.520]  our way they act like such buffoons they're involved in such corruption but i wonder what's the next
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:57.040]  level of their temper tantrum i don't want to be too confident no uh that's a really scary thing
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:04.480]  when when about hitler and antifa gun control anytime you want to get an idea about if the
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:10.480]  government's lying to you um or if a group anyone is lying to you look at what their narrative is
[02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:15.200]  look at what their agenda is look at what they would need to happen for propaganda purposes
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:22.240]  and then see how that occurred in the news and i know governments lie to us like we've known it
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:26.720]  forever we know that Benghazi didn't happen because some guy at hollywood made a video you know well
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:34.320]  we know that um JFK that communism was involved in this assassination even though it had been
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:39.680]  denied for decades we know that now so we need to look and say okay if there's a reason that they're
[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:43.600]  saying this they're trying to draw our attention over here whether it's a shooting in las vegas
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:50.320]  whether it's um rias in the street on november 4th it's gonna be for a reason we have to be ready

[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.960]  anti philoga yeah it does so it's going to really trigger them yeah i love triggering it triggering
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:43.040]  them so that's only one month info wars store dot com thank you all for your support take advantage
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:48.400]  of those specials tim i asked you during the break third season of hunting hitler you can't give me
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:54.480]  any secrets you were down there for months shooting this and jungles you name it just the other seasons
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:35:00.160]  finding the u-boats and finding these big german mansions in the middle of these gorgeous mountains
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:05.440]  and people saying yes hitlers here in underground bunkers and we know a bunch of nazis ran there we
[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:11.280]  know 36 000 came to us via the rat line most out of argentina they've got hollywood movies about
[02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:16.480]  the boys from brazil with gregory peck where they're down there making hitler clones makes me ask you
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:22.560]  know what's going to come through uh next here uh just incredible job but you gave me the inside
[02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:28.080]  scoop not violating your nda but you were telling me you're on the fence it was pretty sophisticated
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:33.200]  what you said once you said it all clicked what do you really think i think that the plan was in
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:39.600]  place for adolf Hitler to get out i think that they had made um every you know if if if he's number
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:45.520]  one command his number two three four five and six they would have put in place um how to expel him
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:50.880]  out of germany and they had a forward group that were sent ahead of time to start preparing for
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:56.400]  his arrival in south america and we know those guys we know the barbies this um scorsenskis the
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:36:00.640]  adolf eichmanns and some of them were caught some of them weren't the ones that were caught that was
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:06.320]  by design and those were in deals with um the israelis for example and the idf caught eichmann but
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:13.760]  it was always for a reason and at the end of the war in april 1945 what happened to adolf hitler
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:19.920]  what was his demise i don't know but i know that the the process of how he was going to get out
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:24.880]  was perfectly executed and that's what we dug into for season three incredible you guys have found
[02:36:24.880 --> 02:36:30.800]  the nazi escape base in argentina without a doubt we we found the files joseph manglei i have in my
[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:37.200]  hands his hand signature on the ship that he boarded the roster of congratulations by the way
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:41.840]  this is the stuff i grew up as a kid wondering about and my grandfather he was in the military
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:47.040]  bitching about nazis in texas my mom going he's a little eccentric like this is all lore and now
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:51.280]  it's being proven there there's no doubt there's no question this is proof this is fact this i mean
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:57.200]  his own signature in multiple different forms his own visa how he came into argentina and where he
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:01.840]  went his marriage certificate like we found everything and there's no well exactly why was
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:08.160]  the angel of death protected and then you'd have some guard at a death camp fine send him to prison
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:14.400]  but but why is the guard sent to prison and then manglei could run around so i i believe that joseph
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:21.520]  manglei was in charge of regions of south america that he was kind of um in the the pragmatic
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:27.680]  organization the sailor organization organization uh he was in charge of regions of south america
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:32.320]  for the fascists fighting the communists you know so those that don't know joseph manglei the angel
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:36.880]  of death one of the most disgusting humans ever to medical experiments on thousands uh injecting
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:42.000]  blue into little kids eyes to see freezing him to death taking twins and torturing one to see
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:47.360]  i mean just like you can't even process and this man escaped and lived into old age and died of
[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:53.040]  old age in south america and he a lot of it was the from my research they had trillions of days
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:58.720]  money hidden and so they parlayed that into deep state groups so a few nazis got busted here and
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:03.920]  there when they weren't coughing up the goods yeah but not anybody crucial not anybody important
[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:09.040]  not anybody the ones that got caught um they had either either served their purpose um and they
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:15.200]  had kind of expired their usefulness um or they were such an asset that they were able to be traded
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:20.400]  and exposed and hand it off like i'd have i'd have ate off ikeman when he was given to israelis
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:26.640]  it was for a reason and um and a reason to create a a better stronger partnership with the israeli
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:32.560]  intelligence agency when we handed him to them so this we know we we discovered the route lines
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:38.240]  we found who was facilitating who was involved who was there um you know and that that communism
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:44.720]  imagine that was at the root of a lot of it and um there's no question what these guys did after that
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:51.440]  wow and i gotta say this has been going on like three years or how long has honey Hitler been
[02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:56.640]  going on yeah with the investigation has been going on for three and a half years now two hit
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:01.040]  seasons which the first was amazing historic in europe the second i thought was incredible
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:05.760]  the third you're telling me really delivers well the others already did how it's crazy to have this
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:11.760]  come out the jfk files 30 days before your show's about to hit wow congratulations yeah i mean history
[02:39:11.760 --> 02:39:15.200]  channel called up you know the director of the cia and said hey could you please release these
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:20.880]  fours no i mean is it secret is here serendipity yeah i don't know it was it was fate let's just
[02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:24.560]  bring them in briefly as we with this next segment because and with us uh doctors around
[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:29.120]  coursey best-selling author worked for the state department a lot of their important work uh fighting
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:34.560]  the globalist i know you're an expert on the nazis as well one area of the jfk files i know you
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:40.640]  knew jfk yourself personally what what do you make of trump really delivered my view these files are
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:44.800]  basically unredacted no wonder they didn't want these to come out these are incredible
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:53.200]  by the way congratulations on the series you know i also wrote a book called hunting hitler
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:59.280]  which did very well preceded your series of same name hunting hitler i didn't even know that we
[02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:04.960]  got these done everywhere i love it and we agree i mean i i came to the same conclusion and of course
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:10.000]  i didn't have all the documents you had but i have enough of the documents to know that um
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:15.680]  the fbi was hunting hitler in argentina by the way this is serendipity synchronicity i didn't
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:21.280]  even i've known coursey 20 years i didn't even know he he'd written this i'm now in the twilight
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:28.240]  zone sorry go ahead well and i've admired the uh the work you've done on the uh hunting hitler
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:33.600]  hbo series i think it's spectacular i wish i had the the research budget to go down and do what you
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:40.880]  guys have done but you've really broken the wide open and now that we have these caches of documents
[02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:47.600]  coming out of the uh fbi on on what really happened to hitler i think it's indisputable i was about
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:51.440]  to say though i mean i mean i knew you were an expert on hitler and so i've forgotten remember
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:54.960]  years ago you'd actually written that book you've mentioned it you've done so much it's just crazy
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:59.440]  that info was reporter dr coursey honored to have him here but how crazy is it without even knowing
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:03.520]  i just hope you ought to have you on the day when when tim kennedy's here and then it's just all
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:07.440]  but but separately what do you make of trump because we'll get into the whole
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:13.840]  yeah indictments with with tim and you the next segment what why why why why is trump doing this
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:18.080]  this is so hardcore because the media's spending it that he didn't do anything well the other president's
[02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:24.800]  blocked it he didn't well i mean first of all i think don trump fully appreciates that he's facing
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:30.800]  a deep state threat himself and this gets clear today and i've been writing about this all day
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:34.960]  all morning about the manifold he's been saying for six months they're gonna indict manifold then
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:40.800]  next they're gonna go over trump that's right and and you know trump's gotta watch it because uh the
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:47.520]  Mueller and the fbi they they're crooked prosecutors uh and trump is gonna release the files and i
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:52.320]  think he's not gonna be satisfied here there's also thousands of pages that have been released
[02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:57.520]  before that are are still redacted and uh we're gonna encourage trump to go back over the whole
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:02.880]  file and release everything unredacted and it might not hurt to send this into the cia look
[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:07.520]  around and ask a few questions i mean i'm sure that there are yet documents that are hidden and
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:12.800]  squirreled away that we might never get at but this treasure trove we're getting is making it
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:21.520]  absolutely clear that when the assassination occurred the fbi the cia and johnson we're all
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:28.320]  in a rush of judgment to declare that lee harvey oswald was the sure even cbs has the headline that
[02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:33.600]  hoover told folks we're gonna say it's a lone gunman get that out tim kennedy's our guest
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:38.480]  popping in his daughter's rum coursey who i had no idea i'd forgotten he's written so many best

[02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:12.320]  walking down the street none of those things would be happening in any of the places that i go and
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:18.640]  work her genitals would be cut off it's complete mutilation so every instance of whether it's
[02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:25.120]  london bridge um or it's france uh during the patriot patriot parade um these have been radical
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:30.320]  extremists hopping in vehicles and running over people um i'll tell you what if you're scared
[02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:34.880]  in in your your hispanic latino and you're walking down the street and you're worried about somebody

[02:50:59.360 --> 02:51:04.640]  americans that those are the ones that i would i've put my life on the line multiple times well
[02:51:04.640 --> 02:51:08.480]  this just shows how desperate they are right now it's incredible you were pointing out that you
[02:51:08.480 --> 02:51:12.480]  think this will drain the swamp they've bitten off more they can chew it looks horrible they're
[02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:17.520]  totally available corruption doctor's room coursey your story is top linked on drugreport.com dealing
[02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:23.520]  with the fact that to fbi reliance on discredited fusion gps russia dossier threatens manifold
[02:51:23.520 --> 02:51:28.720]  prosecution the next five minutes give us the data boil down the inside scoop we broke yesterday
[02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:34.560]  who would be indicted today about what's really happening here yeah and also i i meant to say
[02:51:34.560 --> 02:51:39.920]  the uh history channel for your special and sure i've taped all the i've taped the shows
[02:51:39.920 --> 02:51:45.040]  and watched it multiple times we're in complete agreement you're doing a job uh let me let me
[02:51:45.040 --> 02:51:55.280]  break this down what is what has happened is that the fbi went and used this fusion gps rca which
[02:51:55.280 --> 02:52:03.840]  they paid for uh to the faiza court as the basis to get a wiretap electronic surveillance
[02:52:03.840 --> 02:52:10.640]  on manifold for well over a year uh and they didn't tell the faiza court that the fbi had paid for
[02:52:10.640 --> 02:52:18.560]  this or that the democrats had paid for hillary's campaign uh perkins coy the dnc running it through
[02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:24.720]  perkins coy so the hillary would have deniability and the dnc would have deniability this file
[02:52:24.720 --> 02:52:32.240]  all these comments it violates campaign law yeah yeah it violates campaign laws and from the fbi's
[02:52:32.240 --> 02:52:38.640]  point of view if they obtained a fraudulent uh faiza court warrant and they then proceeded
[02:52:38.640 --> 02:52:45.680]  to do electronic surveillance on Mueller and by the way leaked it to cnn which again is another
[02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:49.920]  crime i mean they're at least coming at missy the new york times let me ask you this did they
[02:52:49.920 --> 02:52:55.120]  speed it up because all the news came out did they speed it up because the because all the
[02:52:55.120 --> 02:53:01.040]  uranium one came out last week did they speed this up to cover yeah i see the my point is
[02:53:01.040 --> 02:53:05.680]  all this faiza court will be thrown out in other words this is a very serious impediment for
[02:53:05.680 --> 02:53:12.640]  muller so your point is this is this is unadmissible this is based on a fraud it's exactly and so
[02:53:12.640 --> 02:53:18.160]  now the whole thing is muller was i think uh rushed by the hillary people saying we've got to
[02:53:18.160 --> 02:53:23.120]  change the news cycle so you better indict somebody you better do it now i don't think they were
[02:53:23.120 --> 02:53:29.840]  ready to indict um uh man i'm sure tim kennedy the the the swamp has now really stuck its arm in
[02:53:29.840 --> 02:53:35.840]  the wood shiver yes absolutely and they're now reacting from a scared and frightened position
[02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:39.520]  because they know that they don't change the news cycle now the other thing that happened this
[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:46.240]  afternoon was really important is that podesta tony podesta uh stepped down from his firm and remember
[02:53:46.240 --> 02:53:52.480]  we were the first to report that tony podesta was working for the same group in ukraine that uh
[02:53:52.480 --> 02:53:57.840]  the bafford was working for and right after we wrote that report last week or a week before
[02:53:57.840 --> 02:54:04.240]  uh muller announced suddenly he was investigating podesta that's right now again the podesta
[02:54:04.240 --> 02:54:10.880]  brother has pulled out and he's a front for john podesta this is a big deal yeah it's a huge deal
[02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:17.040]  and it shows the ultimate corruption of the fbi the determination to go on this witch hunt because
[02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:24.320]  basically there's no tie between these so-called you know problems that maybe uh muller had with
[02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:30.240]  taking money and wire transfers and how he handled it although i i suspect manifold had very good
[02:54:30.240 --> 02:54:35.120]  legal counsel when he did all of that and i mean i mean i've read the documents i'm no foreign
[02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:40.160]  elections lawyer but he's operating in the good gracious u.s government he's paying for the whole
[02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:44.720]  campaign operation he sets up companies there and does it he'd be at least it looks like what
[02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:51.200]  everybody else does it's it's obviously knows he's under scrutiny well and i you know he is so far
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:55.840]  this being presented by the mainstream media you know like the uh they found the hatchet that
[02:54:55.840 --> 02:55:01.040]  committed the murderer and in the bed with them with the killer and it's got blood all over it
[02:55:01.040 --> 02:55:05.680]  well that's that's what we have trials because so far you're just hearing the government's version
[02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:10.080]  well i mean number one criminals wouldn't be transferring money in public ledgers that were
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:16.080]  already given to congress as they admit they swat teamed them just for the aesthetics for the jury
[02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:21.520]  to say oh look by the way what team right and by the way we don't have nearly as clear records
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:26.000]  for all the money laundering that the clintons were doing and i also pointed this out that the
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:32.320]  russians were money laundering the clinton estah through this uh company that was in the netherlands
[02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:37.760]  and it shows up in the Panama papers and through this metcom bank but let's interview her oh i'm
[02:55:37.760 --> 02:55:42.960]  sorry she her car blip right and a half ago what does that signify uh some of the witnesses being
[02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:49.520]  murdered uh it's been non-stop it like i i jokingly right with a tv show that's coming out i'm
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:54.000]  going to be doing some really dangerous jobs um and i joke that like maybe i should just go work
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:58.320]  for the clintons because nobody dies more than them in fact you do apply you didn't want to talk
[02:55:58.320 --> 02:56:02.400]  about it but tell us about your new show you're not just coasting on history get your own show
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:05.760]  coming out tell folks yeah i'm gonna go i'm gonna go do the most dangerous jobs in the world and i
[02:56:05.760 --> 02:56:10.160]  can see if i can survive doing them but it's the bread and butter of being american but i think the
[02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:13.600]  most that would be working with the clintons that would be because not the bread and butter of being
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:19.040]  americans if you're not working with the clintons you're not mine they kill everybody i cannot i cannot
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:23.920]  count on hands feet your hands my feet on any of these papers the number of people they've had
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:28.240]  they've had executed every time there has been a leak or an opportunity for somebody to reveal
[02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:31.680]  something about the clintons they die and let me ask you both this question because i mean this
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:36.800]  she calls me dark heart evil all this stuff why am i still alive because we're in the light or
[02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:42.160]  or yeah man is it is you're you're actually a hard guy to reach you're a hard guy to um
[02:56:42.960 --> 02:56:49.120]  to you said so much um it's not the threat of doing it you're already doing it and if if you
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:53.920]  died if if they came and killed you if your car blew up um it would be a pretty difficult thing to
[02:56:54.480 --> 02:56:59.040]  not tie that back to the people that want to that's what i've been told is it highlights everything
[02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:05.680]  i've done to yeah yeah so i said i just want to assassinate our names yeah the um character attacks

[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:25.680]  investigation but let me just ask you briefly when we come back how is it going for them because i
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:31.040]  don't want to be too positive but it seems even in mainstream news even you know you even got

[03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:35.120]  was going on colin capernick and we were all told that it was because president trump is a racist
[03:03:35.120 --> 03:03:39.120]  and that he hates black athletes and that all these terrible things about him when he didn't
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:43.920]  say it about black athletes i don't make it that clear he never said that he said athletes who

[03:06:12.560 --> 03:06:18.880]  jack here filling in for the big fourth hour breaking down some of the news as we await president
[03:06:18.880 --> 03:06:23.520]  trump's announcement big announcement he's promised now he's been on the road for two weeks
[03:06:23.520 --> 03:06:29.600]  he's been on the road over in asia making deals in china working on the north korea
[03:06:29.600 --> 03:06:35.920]  problem set hopefully we'll have some announcement on that that would be my guess as to what the
[03:06:35.920 --> 03:06:39.440]  announcement may have to do with north korea but we will see we don't have any indications
[03:06:39.440 --> 03:06:43.200]  we're waiting for out 30 minutes for that to come but i'd like to break down at first here
[03:06:43.200 --> 03:06:51.760]  here is the current spet of the this roy more situation in alabama and and first things first
[03:06:51.760 --> 03:06:58.480]  we need to investigate every single one of these allegations we need to have a call for a full
[03:06:58.480 --> 03:07:05.680]  investigation into every single one of these people what they're saying make sure that it's on the
[03:07:05.680 --> 03:07:11.840]  level find out if there is any truth to what they have said it's simple now see a lot of people in
[03:07:11.840 --> 03:07:15.680]  the media came to us and they said well we know that you guys are going to say that you don't care
[03:07:15.680 --> 03:07:20.400]  because he's a republican that's not true at all i said on the very first day that the accusations
[03:07:20.400 --> 03:07:27.120]  came out that i hope that there is a full inquiry and investigation into what exactly was going on
[03:07:27.840 --> 03:07:32.080]  and we want the truth because that is what the other side doesn't understand is that we stand
[03:07:32.080 --> 03:07:36.480]  for truth we stand for the investigation of truth and we want anything to come out if there's
[03:07:36.480 --> 03:07:44.000]  accusations great let's look into those uh accusations obviously not great that uh that
[03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:49.120]  it happened but if that is the situation we need to look into it the same way that we would look
[03:07:49.120 --> 03:07:54.240]  into anything else there's no knee jerkism from our side there's no knee jerkism from jack posobic
[03:07:54.240 --> 03:07:59.760]  if i want uh to get to the bottom of something i'm going to say laser focused on that until i get to
[03:07:59.760 --> 03:08:05.600]  the bottom of what exactly was going on and so i really applaud the work a lot of the local
[03:08:05.600 --> 03:08:12.560]  investigators down in alabama a lot of the local news that that's been come that has come up and
[03:08:12.560 --> 03:08:17.440]  talked about some of these uh some of these allegations looking into they've got so there was
[03:08:17.440 --> 03:08:21.600]  there was the yearbook they brought out different copies of the yearbook looked at those checked
[03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:26.240]  them based on the ones that his accuser had brought up that very uh very emotional press
[03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:29.840]  conference that was held Beverly Nelson with gloria all right there in new york city but
[03:08:29.840 --> 03:08:39.200]  but one thing that i'd like to focus on is why exactly is the media so hell bent on prosecuting
[03:08:39.200 --> 03:08:45.680]  ruin more for all of this when they've covered up they've covered up for harvey Weinstein
[03:08:45.680 --> 03:08:51.600]  they've covered up for kevin spacey and they covered up of course most infamously for bill
[03:08:51.600 --> 03:08:56.640]  clinton for so many years for so many years we were told that it doesn't matter what bill clinton
[03:08:56.640 --> 03:09:01.360]  did that those women were all liars Juanita Broderick shouldn't be believed that she was wrong don't
[03:09:01.360 --> 03:09:07.040]  worry about her that whatever bill clinton did with Monica Lewinsky when she was just 19
[03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:10.000]  and he was president of the united states well that all this also doesn't matter because that
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:14.160]  was consensual and what he does in his private life doesn't matter what happens in the in the
[03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:21.120]  oval office in fact even jake tapper of all people first made his name working for a a free
[03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:28.800]  newspaper in washington he dated Monica Lewinsky and then wrote about it objectifying her and
[03:09:28.800 --> 03:09:34.720]  that was really how he broke into mainstream politics it's how he got his name out so the
[03:09:34.720 --> 03:09:40.240]  fact that he was dating her and then wrote a revealing piece in the washington city paper
[03:09:40.240 --> 03:09:46.480]  this is the level that these people will stoop to to get their promotion of themselves out there
[03:09:46.480 --> 03:09:53.680]  they took he took her out on dates took her out on dates and he said it's the tawdriest of
[03:09:53.680 --> 03:09:59.600]  headlines i dated Monica Lewinsky jake tapper tells on this is like national inquire i don't
[03:09:59.600 --> 03:10:05.280]  mean to smear the national inquire but this is like tabloid journalism at its finest it's attacking
[03:10:05.280 --> 03:10:11.440]  someone who under many people's opinions was a victim herself a lowly intern for the president
[03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:18.240]  of the united states taking someone like that abusing her trust clearly abusing her trust
[03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:22.880]  writing up about it and then i believe he called he actually calls her chubby in the piece so he
[03:10:22.880 --> 03:10:28.240]  went it went ahead and called her chubby this is the same jake tapper who runs around mealy
[03:10:28.240 --> 03:10:34.880]  mouthed and pontificating about how honorable and how just and upright and how moral he is
[03:10:34.880 --> 03:10:38.880]  well jake if we're going to talk about moral character let's talk about your moral character
[03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:44.000]  the fact that you took a woman out on dates and then wrote it up to further your own political
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:49.200]  career your own journalistic career i should say landing eventually a job at cnn where i can
[03:10:49.200 --> 03:10:56.160]  understand why cnn would want to hire someone who was willing to stoop to such sleazy and
[03:10:56.160 --> 03:11:00.960]  quite quite frankly disgusting levels to promote himself and get his name out there taking a woman
[03:11:00.960 --> 03:11:06.000]  out and then dating her and then writing it up just so he could pile on on the media storm and
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:12.080]  circus that was going on around monica lewinsky now again none of this me is to take anything away
[03:11:12.080 --> 03:11:16.640]  from the marroy more accusations i absolutely think they should be investigated but i also
[03:11:16.640 --> 03:11:22.480]  think that we should take a step back and look at all of these situation look at the situation
[03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:27.200]  holistically look at the situation we talked about alex uh earlier was playing lots of the great
[03:11:28.160 --> 03:11:32.480]  footage that is available and i shouldn't i say great but as of disturbing disturbing footage
[03:11:32.480 --> 03:11:38.240]  that's available of joe biden not 40 years ago 40 minutes ago 40 days ago two years ago
[03:11:38.800 --> 03:11:45.680]  him touching uh young girls inappropriately in my estimation touching women getting very
[03:11:45.680 --> 03:11:50.880]  handy with them uh getting very close to the young girls as they pull themselves away republicans
[03:11:50.880 --> 03:11:57.040]  and democrats slapping jeff session jeff session slapping his hand away as as he went for um
[03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:03.760]  um for his granddaughter and so these this situation it it it frustrates a lot of people
[03:12:03.760 --> 03:12:10.880]  who have looked at this and seen these videos of biden hours and hours of videos and who have
[03:12:10.880 --> 03:12:15.920]  known about the accusation about bill clinton they want to talk to us about oh wow let's just
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:21.440]  see this headline 52 times more coverage to republican scandal than democrat scandal bob
[03:12:21.440 --> 03:12:28.560]  scandal bob menendez of course who's a sitting us senator an actual us senator who is on trial
[03:12:28.560 --> 03:12:36.320]  right now this moment for corruption including charges of hiring underage girls as prostitutes
[03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:42.560]  in the dominican republic okay no coverage of this scandal sitting us senator no coverage of
[03:12:42.560 --> 03:12:49.760]  this scandal uh 52 or 52 times more to ruin more than to bob menendez they've got all the senators
[03:12:49.760 --> 03:12:55.600]  on on air immediately got all their responses on roi moore well why hasn't the media done that for
[03:12:56.160 --> 03:12:59.840]  bob menendez if this is the standard if this is the standard we're going to take then why aren't
[03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:04.720]  we setting the same standard for everyone else why is it that they only attack republicans and
[03:13:04.720 --> 03:13:09.760]  they run interference and cover up for democrats to include harvey winestein and kevin spacey
[03:13:10.480 --> 03:13:15.600]  harvey winestein of course was a democrat mega donor and i want to point that out too because
[03:13:15.600 --> 03:13:19.200]  so many people say well harvey winestein that was just hollywood that was just hollywood no no no
[03:13:19.200 --> 03:13:24.720]  harvey winestein was donating to hillary clinton to barack obama to so many liberal causes harvey
[03:13:24.720 --> 03:13:31.680]  winestein was an absolute tie-in to the democrat inner circle highest levels of politics and the
[03:13:31.680 --> 03:13:38.480]  media couldn't figure it out cnn even had this guy at one point allen as a guest host at cnn so
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:42.800]  what i'm saying is i'd like to put the conduct as we do every day pretty much around here
[03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:49.680]  i'd like to put the conduct of the media on trial to say what are your journalistic standards
[03:13:50.480 --> 03:13:56.960]  why were you shielding this predator this disgusting predator from so many of our of our
[03:13:56.960 --> 03:14:03.280]  nation's you know favorite stars for so many years why were you protecting him why are you
[03:14:03.280 --> 03:14:07.520]  covering it up nobody came out everyone said well we all knew we all knew we all knew okay then why
[03:14:07.520 --> 03:14:12.400]  didn't you say anything you're the host of cnn jake tapper why didn't you break the story new york
[03:14:12.400 --> 03:14:18.960]  times what why didn't you get it out there for 30 years why did it take all of that time for it to
[03:14:18.960 --> 03:14:26.000]  come public and now jackie spear democrat jackie spear has broken the story that mitch mcconnell
[03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:33.680]  and paul ryan knew about 15 million dollars that was given to the alleged victims of sexual
[03:14:33.680 --> 03:14:42.240]  harassment in the us congress people who actually knew and paid for off the victims and had them
[03:14:42.240 --> 03:14:49.040]  sign nda's for secret sexual harassment victims who are these victims and more importantly i
[03:14:49.040 --> 03:14:55.760]  should say who are the people that were conducting this sexual harassment of them why is this being
[03:14:55.760 --> 03:15:01.760]  covered up are these people still serving in congress are they staffers are they congressmen
[03:15:01.760 --> 03:15:06.560]  and congresswomen themselves why are we not talking about this about the sexual harassment
[03:15:06.560 --> 03:15:11.760]  that's going on in washington dc well i've been talking to my sources about it we're hearing that
[03:15:11.760 --> 03:15:17.200]  there's a list that's that's floating around the hill called the creep list i'm working on getting
[03:15:17.200 --> 03:15:22.480]  my hands on a copy of that or a partial copy of that because i want to know what's going on with
[03:15:22.480 --> 03:15:26.880]  my elected officials and i want america to know what's going on with its elected officials and i
[03:15:26.880 --> 03:15:32.960]  would hope that if roymor does win uh his race and if these allegations prove to be false that he
[03:15:32.960 --> 03:15:37.760]  would call for investigations into the house call for investigations into hollywood at the same time
[03:15:37.760 --> 03:15:43.920]  because it's time to expose the truth it's time to hold these people's feet to their fire and the

[03:21:04.480 --> 03:21:08.720]  that were going on now we told you guys that these weren't going to last and they they have been
[03:21:08.720 --> 03:21:16.160]  been stopped so the the super super male vitality was 50 off that's ended 50 off all apparel that was
[03:21:16.160 --> 03:21:23.040]  done to celebrate the one year anniversary of the president's victory that sale has ended however
[03:21:23.040 --> 03:21:29.600]  because there were so many sales during that time there were so many actual purchases free
[03:21:29.600 --> 03:21:35.760]  shipping has been extended to alex has decided to extend the free shipping which is so great
[03:21:35.760 --> 03:21:41.840]  so for anybody that's going for this boom free shipping extended and they're moving the 50% off
[03:21:41.840 --> 03:21:47.760]  for selected items onto different items throughout the info wars store so the super male was earlier
[03:21:47.760 --> 03:21:51.360]  now they're switching it over and probably one of the ones that i really want to show you guys and
[03:21:51.360 --> 03:21:59.440]  point out to is the caveman true paleo formula it's back 50 off caveman you can experience why

[03:22:18.800 --> 03:22:23.760]  one of these things it's got the super nutrients it's got the feet the the bee pollen it's got the
[03:22:23.760 --> 03:22:29.600]  bone broth turmeric root the chagol mushroom you guys you know the list by now right so what i like
[03:22:29.600 --> 03:22:36.560]  to do is when i'm doing my my my workouts when i'm doing heavy weights i'll go and make a strong
[03:22:36.560 --> 03:22:42.560]  protein shake and that is when i'll drop in probably about 20 minutes 30 minutes after my
[03:22:42.560 --> 03:22:46.800]  workout i'll go for the protein i'll make a shake out of it now what i like to do is make one
[03:22:46.800 --> 03:22:50.960]  beforehand get it ready keep it in the fridge get home from the gym and then i have it right
[03:22:50.960 --> 03:22:56.400]  afterwards it's it's so perfect uh for right after that if you guys are looking for that paleo
[03:22:56.400 --> 03:23:03.440]  nutrition and uh and the protein this is exactly what you're going to get from caveman it's wonderful
[03:23:03.440 --> 03:23:06.800]  now there's some of the other specials you guys they were just showing on the screen there it's

[03:23:48.160 --> 03:23:52.800]  checking out uh the white house they've got a live feed on the white house to make sure that we
[03:23:52.800 --> 03:23:57.360]  haven't missed any of the president's announcement uh i want to break down some of the other news
[03:23:57.360 --> 03:24:04.320]  that we're focusing on now another big story yesterday was this jeff sessions testimony before
[03:24:04.320 --> 03:24:11.280]  the house and jeff sessions gave his testimony essentially was uh an update he was grilled a
[03:24:11.280 --> 03:24:15.920]  lot on ongoing investigations obviously he can't talk about ongoing investigation they try to give
[03:24:15.920 --> 03:24:21.520]  him a record anyway they asked him a lot about these new revelations that have come forward of
[03:24:21.520 --> 03:24:27.120]  george apopodopoulos and carter page people who were loosely affiliated with the trump campaign
[03:24:27.120 --> 03:24:31.520]  they were volunteers they were never on staff they didn't have trump campaign emails but they have
[03:24:31.520 --> 03:24:40.640]  made have potentially made uh some outreaches to the russian state two people that were involved
[03:24:40.640 --> 03:24:45.920]  with the russian government um sessions specifically mentioned that when he heard
[03:24:45.920 --> 03:24:50.960]  apopodopoulos do this he tried to shut him down and said do not do that do not represent the
[03:24:50.960 --> 03:24:55.920]  campaign you don't represent the campaign and do not reach out to anyone on our behalf however he
[03:24:55.920 --> 03:25:00.480]  apparently did so anyway and then lied to investigators about it uh thereby striking
[03:25:00.480 --> 03:25:06.560]  essentially a plea deal with Mueller as many people have surmised on that fact so a lot of
[03:25:06.560 --> 03:25:13.040]  people wonder when is jeff sessions or could jeff sessions to call for a special prosecutor on
[03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:20.720]  the uranium one sale to um to russia a special prosecutor to look into this situation and the
[03:25:20.720 --> 03:25:26.880]  fact that the fbi apparently knew about the situation so jeff sessions has directed staff at
[03:25:26.880 --> 03:25:31.440]  the department of justice this just broke a few days ago right before on the eve of his testimony
[03:25:31.440 --> 03:25:35.040]  and of course they didn't ask him very much about it at the testimony of the hearing itself
[03:25:35.040 --> 03:25:42.560]  he directed employees directed staff at the department of justice to look into what exactly
[03:25:42.560 --> 03:25:47.520]  was going on at the fbi and the doj during the iranium one sale why are there is any
[03:25:47.520 --> 03:25:56.080]  culpability louis golmert a house representative himself also brought forward a a signed document
[03:25:56.080 --> 03:26:04.960]  indicating that rod rozenstein had actually filed a essentially filed a document a blanket
[03:26:04.960 --> 03:26:10.640]  document sealing all the records of the iranium one investigation so rozenstein this is back in
[03:26:10.640 --> 03:26:15.600]  2014 and gomer whole held this up on fox news yesterday breaking huge story he had the actual
[03:26:15.600 --> 03:26:21.120]  document of rozenstein signing off to seal essentially all records pertaining to the
[03:26:21.120 --> 03:26:26.000]  iranium one investigation now rozenstein is currently the deputy ag how does this tie
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:32.000]  back into the news cycle what's actually very interesting because mitch mcconnell right now
[03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:37.600]  who is very much leading the political charge to tell roymore to step out of the race has publicly
[03:26:37.600 --> 03:26:46.080]  floated the idea of having jeff sessions name be written in by alabama voters on the ballots
[03:26:46.080 --> 03:26:50.960]  come december 12th for the special election so he's publicly floating the idea of jeff
[03:26:50.960 --> 03:26:59.040]  sessions running himself to replace jeff sessions as an alternative to roymore now this of course
[03:26:59.040 --> 03:27:04.800]  would also mean that that that essentially if he won the election and decided to take the seat
[03:27:04.800 --> 03:27:09.920]  now is fairly certain jeff sessions is not running to replace himself he's actually the one who
[03:27:09.920 --> 03:27:15.920]  vacated the seat in the first place which set up the entire special election so round and round
[03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:21.600]  we go in this and this is a typical swamp move they're trying to get rid of sessions as attorney
[03:27:21.600 --> 03:27:26.880]  general and they've basically neutered him at this point because he's clearly compromised
[03:27:26.880 --> 03:27:32.160]  he's recused himself from any investigation of merit at the attorney general's post and now
[03:27:32.160 --> 03:27:38.640]  they're trying to say okay jeff you go back to your seat well think about that if jeff sessions
[03:27:38.640 --> 03:27:44.880]  goes back to his seat then what happens to the attorney general well if jeff sessions went back
[03:27:44.880 --> 03:27:50.240]  to his seat then the attorney general would go to the deputy attorney general would become the
[03:27:50.240 --> 03:27:55.680]  acting attorney general like we have with the saliate situation only in this case it would be
[03:27:55.680 --> 03:28:02.560]  rod rozenstein who's the current deputy ag so if sessions vacates until they can get
[03:28:02.560 --> 03:28:07.600]  someone as appointed all the way through the senate confirmation process which is of course again
[03:28:07.600 --> 03:28:13.200]  controlled by mitch mcconnell their own man rod rozenstein himself tied to the iranian one
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:19.280]  investigation would be for all intents and purposes the acting attorney general and that is why many
[03:28:19.280 --> 03:28:23.280]  have called to say how do we get out of this situation how does trump get out of it they said
[03:28:23.280 --> 03:28:29.680]  you know what have sessions resign fire rozenstein fire andrew mccabe at the fbi get all of these
[03:28:29.680 --> 03:28:35.120]  guys out of there and go for a clean sweep approach no one will have to recuse and they can
[03:28:35.120 --> 03:28:40.480]  actually have investigations of merit into the politicization of the doj and the fbi
[03:28:40.480 --> 03:28:46.320]  during the election and possibly prior to the cover-up of uranium one that is what the president
[03:28:46.320 --> 03:28:54.160]  should do in order to break through this logjam stay tuned president trump coming up next hello

[03:33:15.360 --> 03:33:25.440]  who am i to disagree i travel the world showed very well our country is further evidence that
[03:33:25.440 --> 03:33:32.080]  america's renewed confidence and standing in the world has never been stronger than it is right now
[03:33:32.960 --> 03:33:40.000]  when we are confident in ourselves our strength our flag our history our values other nations
[03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:46.560]  are confident in us and when we treat our citizens with the respect they deserve other
[03:33:46.560 --> 03:33:54.960]  countries treat america with the respect that our country so richly deserves during our travels
[03:33:54.960 --> 03:34:05.280]  this is exactly what the world saw a strong proud and confident america today i want to update the
[03:34:05.280 --> 03:34:11.440]  american people on the tremendous success of this trip and the progress we've made to advance american
[03:34:11.440 --> 03:34:18.480]  security and prosperity throughout the year when i came into office our country was faced with a
[03:34:18.480 --> 03:34:27.680]  series of growing dangers these threats included rogue regimes pursuing deadly weapons foreign powers
[03:34:27.680 --> 03:34:34.960]  challenging america's influence the spread of the murderous terror group isis and years of unfair
[03:34:34.960 --> 03:34:42.000]  trade practices that had dangerously depleted our manufacturing base and wiped out millions and
[03:34:42.000 --> 03:34:50.160]  millions of middle-class jobs the challenges were inherited and these products really showed what
[03:34:50.160 --> 03:34:56.720]  previous mistakes were made over many years and even decades by other administrations
[03:34:56.720 --> 03:35:03.520]  some of these mistakes were born of indifference and neglect others from naive thinking and
[03:35:03.520 --> 03:35:11.040]  misguided judgment in some cases the negative influence of partisan politics and special
[03:35:11.040 --> 03:35:19.120]  interests was to blame but the one common thread behind all of these problems was a failure to
[03:35:19.120 --> 03:35:28.080]  protect and promote the interests of the american people and american workers upon my inauguration
[03:35:28.080 --> 03:35:34.400]  i pledged that we would rebuild america restore its economic strength and defend its national
[03:35:34.400 --> 03:35:40.880]  security with this goal in mind i vowed that we would reaffirm old alliances and form new
[03:35:40.880 --> 03:35:49.520]  friendships in pursuit of shared goals above all i swore that in every decision with every action
[03:35:49.520 --> 03:35:56.480]  i would put the best interest of the american people first over the past 10 months traveling
[03:35:56.480 --> 03:36:04.560]  across the globe and meeting with world leaders that is exactly what i have done earlier this year
[03:36:04.560 --> 03:36:11.840]  in saudi arabia i spoke to the leaders of more than 50 arab and muslim nations about our strategy
[03:36:11.840 --> 03:36:19.600]  to defeat terrorists by stripping them a financing territory and ideological support and i urge the
[03:36:19.600 --> 03:36:27.600]  leaders to drive out the terrorists and extremists from their societies since that time we have dealt
[03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:36.640]  ices one crushing defeat after another in israel i reaffirmed the unbreakable bond between america
[03:36:36.640 --> 03:36:43.440]  and the jewish state and i met with leaders of the palestinian authority and initiated an effort
[03:36:43.440 --> 03:36:50.720]  to facilitate lasting peace between the israelis and the palestinians in brussels i urged our
[03:36:50.720 --> 03:36:57.840]  nato allies to do more to strengthen our crucial alliance and set the stage for significant increases
[03:36:57.840 --> 03:37:06.640]  in member contributions billions and billions of dollars are pouring in because of that initiative
[03:37:07.200 --> 03:37:15.680]  nato believe me is very happy with donald trump and what i did in war saw i declared to the world
[03:37:15.680 --> 03:37:24.560]  america's resolve to preserve and protect western civilization and the values we hold so dear in roam
[03:37:24.560 --> 03:37:30.480]  sicily humberg and paris i strengthened our friendships with key allies to promote our
[03:37:30.480 --> 03:37:36.720]  shared interests of security and prosperity so i just want to say compare this with how obama
[03:37:36.720 --> 03:37:42.400]  acted when he went around the world president trump they are telling us about all of the great
[03:37:42.400 --> 03:37:48.960]  accomplishments he's made around the world all of the wonderful praise and celebration
[03:37:48.960 --> 03:37:53.520]  that he's been receiving from so many of these countries from so many of these foreign leaders
[03:37:53.520 --> 03:37:58.000]  and i'd love to contrast that you don't you get you everyone remembers the apology tour that
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:01.760]  obama took when he first became president that's what president trump is doing here
[03:38:02.400 --> 03:38:11.520]  he's telling people that this is what was done during during the last presidency and now the
[03:38:11.520 --> 03:38:15.760]  difference that's being done during this presidency now our producers are still gonna listen if there
[03:38:15.760 --> 03:38:20.320]  is a a bigger announcement we're gonna cut back to the president but i want to focus on that for
[03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:24.240]  people so that you can really put up the contrast and he's not saying it because he doesn't have to
[03:38:24.240 --> 03:38:29.760]  right the president trump doesn't have to say that he's not president obama because you know
[03:38:29.760 --> 03:38:34.320]  because you can see the difference everyone can see the difference and the respect the amount of
[03:38:34.320 --> 03:38:38.720]  respect that he receives when he goes over to china and becomes one of the first presidents
[03:38:38.720 --> 03:38:43.920]  of the united states to be allowed to dine in the forbidden city when obama went there they
[03:38:43.920 --> 03:38:47.600]  didn't even roll out the red carpet for him they made him come out to let from like those small
[03:38:47.600 --> 03:38:51.920]  part of the airplane and go down the steps on the back because they didn't even give him the full
[03:38:51.920 --> 03:38:55.600]  the full size that now speaking to someone who lived in china for two years who speaks
[03:38:55.600 --> 03:39:01.040]  at fluent mandarin i can tell you the chinese at when with china you're standing it all comes
[03:39:01.040 --> 03:39:07.760]  down to your etiquette it all comes down to how you're received the way that they received obama
[03:39:07.760 --> 03:39:13.360]  was shameful it was a joke they were making fun of him they were making light of him when president
[03:39:13.360 --> 03:39:18.480]  trump went there they not only rolled out the red carpet they brought him to dine inside the forbidden
[03:39:18.480 --> 03:39:24.880]  city forbidden city in beijing just adjacent to tiananmen square behind the tianan tianan gate
[03:39:24.880 --> 03:39:31.760]  that it was originally i mean it was forbidden that was only the area for the princes the kings
[03:39:31.760 --> 03:39:38.720]  the rulers the elite they brought president trump into that area and fed him and and let him eat
[03:39:38.720 --> 03:39:45.040]  there with malania the only thing the only thing the one little point that i personally had wished
[03:39:45.040 --> 03:39:49.920]  would happen the only thing that i wish would have happened on that china trip and it was a great
[03:39:49.920 --> 03:39:55.440]  trip why didn't president trump go to the wall why didn't he go to the great wall of china you
[03:39:55.440 --> 03:40:00.640]  think that would have been one of you know like a no-brainer kind of thing and i'd like to hear
[03:40:00.640 --> 03:40:07.280]  what the the thought process was on that but come on so he he was going down to uh uh to asian he
[03:40:07.280 --> 03:40:12.160]  continued on his trip to vietnam and the philippines and malania actually went and toward the wall
[03:40:12.160 --> 03:40:17.520]  herself but man how amazing would it have been to see right then we would have memes for days on
[03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:21.920]  that if president trump was going and traveling the great wall of china you know basically looking
[03:40:21.920 --> 03:40:29.120]  there and saying yes i can get some ideas now but what what an amazing and maybe it was just a schedule
[03:40:29.120 --> 03:40:34.160]  thing i'm not sure but what an amazing response that he got from vietnam uh what he got from the
[03:40:34.160 --> 03:40:38.800]  philippines in vietnam and the video this is so hard to find because the mainstream media barely
[03:40:38.800 --> 03:40:45.280]  showed it uh they thronged the streets as he came into hanoi there the capital of vietnam
[03:40:45.280 --> 03:40:51.520]  there were people cheering there were people lining the streets thousands and thousands of them
[03:40:51.520 --> 03:40:56.640]  to meet the president and they're now a key read on this a very very key read on this
[03:40:56.640 --> 03:41:02.560]  is to understand one very specific thing because one of what is the biggest challenge that the
[03:41:02.560 --> 03:41:07.840]  president is taking on in asia pacific region right now the biggest challenge he's taking on
[03:41:07.840 --> 03:41:14.560]  is north korea he's clearly made that one of the major focuses of his presidency and certainly in
[03:41:14.560 --> 03:41:19.200]  his diplomacy he's letting the military focus on isis our military is focusing on isis but he
[03:41:19.200 --> 03:41:24.800]  is personally focused so much on kim jong un we all saw that that tweet uh the short and fat
[03:41:24.800 --> 03:41:31.360]  tweet or never never call him short and fat right so how does it make kim jong un feel because you
[03:41:31.360 --> 03:41:35.840]  know he's watching this speech you know he's watching this trip he's watching the reception how
[03:41:35.840 --> 03:41:45.280]  does it make him feel when all the leaders of asia from putin to she to moon in south korea to the
[03:41:45.280 --> 03:41:51.360]  leaders of vietnam to leaders of the philippines the leaders of japan they all are showing so much
[03:41:51.360 --> 03:41:59.120]  respect and so much praise to president trump so i'll guess what kim all of your neighbors
[03:41:59.120 --> 03:42:05.520]  are on our side so if every single person around you who's normally your biggest patrons and your
[03:42:05.520 --> 03:42:10.240]  biggest supporters the people that are your lifeblood out to the rest of the world because you live
[03:42:10.240 --> 03:42:14.400]  in this hermit kingdom where you're building nukes and trying to launch them around and hit us with
[03:42:14.400 --> 03:42:19.360]  your td to your taepodong two missiles well how does it make you feel when every single one in
[03:42:19.360 --> 03:42:24.640]  your neighborhood right that normally helps you out and protects you is now showing respect to
[03:42:24.640 --> 03:42:31.840]  president trump that my friends is how you do diplomacy that is how you show respect and how
[03:42:31.840 --> 03:42:36.960]  you use that leverage against kim jong un we're gonna come back we're gonna go to a quick break

[03:47:44.960 --> 03:47:49.920]  policy following the disaster of barack obama he's now giving that statement right now explaining
[03:47:49.920 --> 03:47:56.400]  that america is back the united states of america has retained its position in the united states
[03:47:56.400 --> 03:48:02.320]  it's standing in the united states he's there giving an excellent speech today letting everyone know
[03:48:03.840 --> 03:48:08.720]  the amazing work that he's doing now somebody sent me a text message during the break they said jack
[03:48:08.720 --> 03:48:13.200]  how many how much you want to bet that the first question the media asks him after you know he's
[03:48:13.200 --> 03:48:17.520]  talking about all of the all the the accomplishments that he's made and talking about all of the things
[03:48:17.520 --> 03:48:20.960]  that he's doing on behalf of the of the country around the world and how much do you want to
[03:48:20.960 --> 03:48:24.880]  bet the first question any reporter asks is going to be about roi moore and i wrote back
[03:48:24.880 --> 03:48:28.160]  i wrote back we should drink every time that they that they say roi moore because you know
[03:48:28.160 --> 03:48:33.440]  that's that's what the media is right president trump didn't endorse roi moore president trump
[03:48:33.440 --> 03:48:38.000]  didn't campaign for roi moore uh he actually campaigned for the other guy i went to the rally
[03:48:38.000 --> 03:48:42.800]  myself personally campaigned for laura or the what's the guy's name larry larry larry strange
[03:48:42.800 --> 03:48:48.080]  aren't strange larry strange larry strange yeah and uh couldn't even remember the guy's name i
[03:48:48.080 --> 03:48:53.760]  remember he was strange big guy big guy big oh luther no luther luther strange there was luther
[03:48:53.760 --> 03:48:58.800]  strange right big luther right big luther so he came to remember the guy it's forgetful but
[03:48:58.800 --> 03:49:05.040]  forgettable but uh what i also want to point out though is that the president arrives back
[03:49:05.040 --> 03:49:11.040]  to the united states back to washington dc and he's under attack he's under attack by robert
[03:49:11.040 --> 03:49:16.400]  mueller and we it's now been revealed and this is actually breaking news today it's
[03:49:16.400 --> 03:49:23.840]  actually completely exposed now as nothing but a partisan witch hunt because david brock as we
[03:49:23.840 --> 03:49:29.760]  all know who is essentially an agent of george soros here in this country is going to be starting
[03:49:29.760 --> 03:49:38.160]  a new super PAC project to support mueller now think about that for a second mueller is supposed
[03:49:38.160 --> 03:49:44.240]  to be objectively investigating any issue of collusion with russia right this is supposed to
[03:49:44.240 --> 03:49:49.360]  be a non-partisan oh goodness look at that picture of david brock just just just just look at that
[03:49:49.360 --> 03:49:53.040]  i don't even i guys i can't even look at you got to take it away you got to take it away i can't
[03:49:53.040 --> 03:49:59.920]  i can't look at it i can't look at it so so david brock he's he's paying this or using the super
[03:49:59.920 --> 03:50:06.400]  PAC money to now promote uh the mueller investigation to promote mueller's efforts like
[03:50:06.400 --> 03:50:12.480]  it's some kind of political campaign so can super PAC money be used that they're talking about running
[03:50:12.480 --> 03:50:18.560]  social media ads they're talking about organizing grassroots volunteers for i don't even know what
[03:50:18.560 --> 03:50:24.160]  to support mueller as if mueller is running for president or running for something well essentially
[03:50:24.160 --> 03:50:30.400]  what they're going to be doing is completely perverting the judicial process completely perverting
[03:50:30.400 --> 03:50:37.600]  the investigation as david brock is now using his super PAC uh american bridge 21st century to
[03:50:37.600 --> 03:50:41.840]  as he calls it defend the investigation against Trump so they're talking about how they're going
[03:50:41.840 --> 03:50:47.680]  to be using social media they're going to be using grassroots advocacy for for mueller so why would
[03:50:47.680 --> 03:50:54.960]  you take someone who's one of the most partisan right uh political operatives in the entire country
[03:50:54.960 --> 03:51:01.760]  david brock who has trouble paying his taxes and put him tie him with robert mueller this shows
[03:51:01.760 --> 03:51:07.120]  quite clearly that robert mueller's investigation is nothing than what the president stated himself
[03:51:07.120 --> 03:51:12.560]  other than a partisan witch hunt designed to take him out this is a really really bad move
[03:51:12.560 --> 03:51:17.760]  by the democrats uh at this up until this point mueller uh we know that there had been some talk
[03:51:17.760 --> 03:51:24.960]  of him investigating tony podesta also going after um paul manifold filing charges a few weeks ago
[03:51:24.960 --> 03:51:30.640]  my sources have told me that tony podesta who had committed the same far uh infraction as
[03:51:31.520 --> 03:51:36.960]  as manifold however podesta my sources are telling me is working as a cooperating witness
[03:51:36.960 --> 03:51:43.040]  possibly to avoid prosecution himself but is working uh working at a deal and has stepped
[03:51:43.040 --> 03:51:49.040]  down as CEO of the podesta group as well as his um one of his uh top staffers there is also stepping
[03:51:49.040 --> 03:51:55.680]  down so it remains to be seen whether he pleads guilty uh in the similar way as george papadopoulos
[03:51:55.680 --> 03:51:59.920]  but it has now been completely exposed that it is nothing other than a partisan witch hunt which
[03:51:59.920 --> 03:52:06.720]  is what president told us told us from the start why would this far left alt left you would even say
[03:52:06.720 --> 03:52:12.480]  a media group and this political group be supporting the investigation so it's clearly
[03:52:12.480 --> 03:52:18.400]  shown that mueller is nothing but an arm of the resistance trying to stop our president
[03:52:18.400 --> 03:52:25.920]  i'd really also like to look up the fec regulations on super PAC spending uh to see whether or not
[03:52:25.920 --> 03:52:32.720]  this can be even done legally in terms of supporting an investigation getting involved in the
[03:52:32.720 --> 03:52:38.480]  investigative process in terms of advertising certainly sounds like it's being done to poison
[03:52:38.480 --> 03:52:42.720]  the well of public opinion so talking about poisoning the well of public opinion i want to
[03:52:42.720 --> 03:52:47.360]  talk about uh right before we end the show today or in this hour i should say before war room comes
[03:52:47.360 --> 03:52:53.520]  up right after you with with the great owens shawyer is the poland independence day march which
[03:52:53.520 --> 03:53:00.800]  was held last week november 11th now poland was not a country 99 years ago poland did not get
[03:53:00.800 --> 03:53:06.720]  its independence until after world war one poland was essentially taken over and occupied
[03:53:07.680 --> 03:53:12.400]  then again poland was occupied by both the nazis and the communists during world war two in the
[03:53:12.400 --> 03:53:18.960]  month of 1939 or excuse me the year of 1939 so poland rightfully so wants to hold a huge
[03:53:18.960 --> 03:53:24.800]  independence day parade because they still remember what it was like to not have a country within
[03:53:24.800 --> 03:53:30.720]  living memory so of those 99 years they celebrated on november 11th really only about 50 of them
[03:53:30.720 --> 03:53:36.720]  were as a free republic most of it was done under occupation of some sort either the nazis
[03:53:36.720 --> 03:53:41.840]  or the communists the communists of course only really coming out of power after the 1990s early
[03:53:41.840 --> 03:53:49.600]  90s but the media decided to go ahead and call the entire march a nazi march they said that people
[03:53:49.600 --> 03:53:57.200]  marching in poland were were doing it as nazis 60 000 people who took part in this and so you
[03:53:57.200 --> 03:54:03.680]  look at this parade and you can actually look at the video and these are just regular polish people
[03:54:03.680 --> 03:54:08.640]  i was just there in war saw back in july going there and celebrating their country celebrating
[03:54:08.640 --> 03:54:14.800]  their national day the same way the united states we have independence day parades there is the
[03:54:14.800 --> 03:54:21.040]  president of poland is marching with polish soldiers on doing a review for independence day
[03:54:21.040 --> 03:54:27.360]  obviously it's very cold so they have they've got some fires lit for warmth again independence day
[03:54:27.360 --> 03:54:37.120]  parade right not anything to do with far extremism whatsoever simply standing up for themselves
[03:54:37.120 --> 03:54:43.840]  standing up for their country in terms of the independence day but whatever but the mainstream
[03:54:43.840 --> 03:54:49.760]  media decided that because well there was this one group that showed up and this one group had a
[03:54:49.760 --> 03:54:55.200]  couple signs that were held up that said uh you know and they even admitted that this group didn't
[03:54:55.200 --> 03:55:00.240]  even come from poland that they came from places like germany that they came in and were holding
[03:55:00.240 --> 03:55:06.960]  up neo-nazi type signs that the entire parade itself was a nazi parade and then they said that
[03:55:06.960 --> 03:55:13.120]  they were holding up signs that said they were called pray for an islamic holocaust well i went
[03:55:13.120 --> 03:55:16.400]  through myself and looked at all the footage and i couldn't find anyone holding up a sign that said
[03:55:16.400 --> 03:55:21.360]  pray for islamic holocaust but the washington post said right in its headline that that's
[03:55:21.360 --> 03:55:24.960]  what the people of the parade were marching behind that banner so i went around and around
[03:55:24.960 --> 03:55:29.120]  i was looking for it and then one of my sources in poland reached out to me i was there in july
[03:55:29.120 --> 03:55:35.840]  i met a lot of people going back there uh planning to go back there soon and someone said uh well jack
[03:55:35.840 --> 03:55:42.320]  that's because it wasn't there it was there in 2015 some people hung it over the side of a bridge
[03:55:42.320 --> 03:55:49.200]  and it had nothing to do with the 2017 parade uh and and but apparently that was good enough for
[03:55:49.200 --> 03:55:56.960]  the washington post so the washington post used the 2015 islamic holocaust banner to smear the
[03:55:56.960 --> 03:56:03.920]  2017 independence day parade this is actual fake news and right there pray for an islamic holocaust
[03:56:03.920 --> 03:56:08.480]  and you can see the headline from the washington post but if they if our producer scrolled down
[03:56:08.480 --> 03:56:13.600]  just a little bit you can see the sign wasn't actually at the independence day parade at all
[03:56:13.600 --> 03:56:20.720]  there it is on the side of a building and you look at the date just above it 11 17 2015 the washington
[03:56:20.720 --> 03:56:27.520]  post actually manufacturing and printing fake news the same fake news was then repeated by
[03:56:27.520 --> 03:56:35.280]  newsweek and this guy uh jesse larick who's a former hillary clinton uh staffer so again they
[03:56:35.280 --> 03:56:42.640]  will spoop to any level they will put up fake pictures they will lie they will slander they
[03:56:42.640 --> 03:56:47.920]  will use libel they have no rules they have no boundaries anymore so people are saying well
[03:56:47.920 --> 03:56:52.560]  why don't why doesn't the mainstream media have credibility because we keep catch them lying we
[03:56:52.560 --> 03:56:58.800]  keep catch them spreading fake news and conspiracies and that is what we are going to do here each
[03:56:58.800 --> 03:57:03.440]  and every day that is what i'm going to do when i'm when i'm on the show that is what war rooms
[03:57:03.440 --> 03:57:08.960]  going to do when they come up we are going to show you we're the reporting on the media itself
[03:57:08.960 --> 03:57:13.760]  we're going to call out their lives we're going to call out their conspiracies and we were going
[03:57:13.760 --> 03:57:19.440]  to say that anytime the mainstream media is is presenting you with a headline that you should
[03:57:19.440 --> 03:57:24.560]  be skeptical of it the same way you should be skeptical of anything without doing your own
[03:57:24.560 --> 03:57:30.560]  research and getting the facts before you rush to judgment jack posovic happily married uh
