[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  3, 2, 1, go!
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live on this Friday,
[00:53.000 --> 01:07.000]  February 25th, 2022 broadcast, and you are seeing the biggest unfolding war on the continent of Europe
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  since World War II, 75 years ago.
[01:11.000 --> 01:20.000]  Full-scale invasion, full-scale takeover of a country with 40 million people on it,
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  one of the largest countries geographically in Europe.
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  All hell has broken loose.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  Now, a lot of people have asked, how did I know in October, November, and December this was coming?
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  And I told you how I knew that.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  The ice melts at the end of February, and the tanks would bog down,
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.000]  so if Russia was going to invade, they'd do it by the end of February,
[01:44.000 --> 01:52.000]  and major financial individuals I talked to, the highest levels, said get ready for war in February.
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  Not just Russia, but also China, and I told you that so you could get ready.
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  And a lot of people just marvel and say, how does he do it? He must be a secret agent,
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  or Jones must just make a lot of predictions and this one's stuck.
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  You know, I said for the last four months, five months, that it would come at the end of February.
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  That's what I said.
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  And the reason I point that out is, now I'm going to tell you what is also in the cards.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  And I think you already know it's in the cards if you're informed and educated,
[02:25.000 --> 02:27.000]  but for leftists and others out there that don't seem to get it,
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  or for the Rolling Stone, or CNN attacking us, because they're jealous,
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  because they have to lie and we get to tell the truth.
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  But they don't have the skills to actually predict the future,
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  because they're so disconnected from reality, putting out lies,
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  that they're basically smoking their own dope.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  The reason I point out that we've been so accurate on all these different issues,
[02:48.000 --> 02:56.000]  is so people will listen to me on what I'm about to say today.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  Now, right before we went live, I dictated the headline for the show.
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  It's not up yet, but it basically goes like this.
[03:05.000 --> 03:14.000]  World War III Alert, or Nuclear War Alert, is technically the Communist Chinese,
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  and the Russians, and the CIA, and all these groups call this World War IV.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  World War III already happened in the last Cold War.
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.000]  It was called World War III.
[03:22.000 --> 03:23.000]  This is World War IV.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  This is a different type of war.
[03:25.000 --> 03:31.000]  It has the aspects of sanctions, it has the aspects of cyber attacks,
[03:31.000 --> 03:38.000]  it has the aspects of intensive propaganda, and soft-kill bioweapon releases.
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  And generally, the historians and the futurists, and myself and others,
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  have projected that it would be opened up with a soft-kill weapon
[03:49.000 --> 03:56.000]  to bog down civilization and society, because it's not just two nations
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  fighting with each other, or two superpowers fighting with each other,
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  or two power blocks fighting with each other.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  It is the larger, globalist system of transhumanists
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  that have their in-game goal of collapsing society,
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  and they're playing all sides off against each other.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  And the minute we realize that, the minute we can turn this around,
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.000]  so we're going to break some stations, join us then.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  For some stations, the next segment is the start of the show.
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.000]  Some stations carry the first five.
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  And I'm going to drill directly into what we're facing.
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  It's very, very simple.
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  Wars almost always tend to escalate when you've got real powers fighting with each other.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  Proxy wars tend to turn into theater wars.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  Theater wars tend to turn into continental wars.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  Continental wars tend to turn into world wars, or larger planetary wars
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  with multiple theaters wars taking place.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  And we're going to be laying it all out here today
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  of how fast this could escalate, stay with us with cyber attacks and sanctions.
[05:00.000 --> 05:03.000]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  And long before I started selling high-quality vitamin D3 eight years ago,
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.000]  I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.000]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day,
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  whether you're black or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  It's just like you need oxygen, you die in four minutes without oxygen.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  You die in five or six days without water, you die in a month without food.
[05:31.000 --> 05:37.000]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need.
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.000]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's defenses
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.000]  available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.000]  Everybody, old, young, black, white, you need vitamin D3.
[05:56.000 --> 06:08.000]  This is the best quality out there and it funds the infowar 50% off.
[06:26.000 --> 06:35.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the infowar.
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  There were no controlling who comes through the door.
[06:59.000 --> 07:05.000]  A culture made of cover-ups will ever see touch their flesh.
[07:05.000 --> 07:12.000]  For back room meetings and rendezvous, the vultures have come up to nest.
[07:12.000 --> 07:27.000]  The clock runs out. The weakest link. A deadly strike. The threat is real.
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  The threat is real. You know, when I helped write that song with Dave Mustaine,
[07:32.000 --> 07:35.000]  it's got to be 10 years ago now or eight years ago.
[07:35.000 --> 07:40.000]  We were trying to envision what could start a new world war.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  And we talked about Russia, China, the Middle East, and that's the song.
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.000]  The threat is real. What a crazy world, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:50.000 --> 07:59.000]  Here we are on this Friday, February 25th, 2022, transmission.
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  I'm going to open the phones up again today around the end of this hour
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.000]  and try to go to as many of them as I can so I can get your take on the situation in the world.
[08:07.000 --> 08:11.000]  But let me just pull back right now and put the full show headline up on screen
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.000]  for TV viewers and I'll read it for radio listeners.
[08:14.000 --> 08:20.000]  Because there's really not words strong enough to describe how much danger
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  every man, woman, and child on this planet is in.
[08:24.000 --> 08:33.000]  We are in a maximum alert, the threat of worldwide nuclear war, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:33.000 --> 08:40.000]  And let me explain why. Most big wars that get going start when two major powers
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.000]  or three major powers are using a proxy zone for their war.
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  World War I started that way, World War II.
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  And you get different powers that start pushing their borders and annexing areas
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  and you get this creeping testing of the other powers.
[08:59.000 --> 09:05.000]  And then all of a sudden the major move happens and the other side escalates back
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  and the other sides escalate and then it gets into a full war.
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  So let's talk about what Sleepy Joe and the Globalists are up to,
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  what Vladimir Putin is up to, what Zelensky and Ukraine is up to,
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000]  what Xi Jinping and Communist China is up to,
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  because all of this is interconnected.
[09:28.000 --> 09:36.000]  We have the usual suspects, Republican and Democratic senators,
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  calling for more military aid to Ukraine.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  That's what got this going in the first place is all the weapons being shipped in
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  to the Russian border.
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  How about poking the bear? It's like climbing in a grizzly bear.
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  Den at the zoo and wondering why it eats you.
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  Are these crazy people that climb in with Bengal tigers or gorillas
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  and wonder why they get their head ripped off?
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  That's what happened here. Doesn't mean I back what Putin's doing.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  Doesn't mean I like it. It's terrible.
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  And whatever happens now, it's on Putin.
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.000]  This is historic. Make no mistake.
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  But back into a corner, you see what Russia did.
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.000]  And the last straw was Biden pulling out of Afghanistan in such a shoddy, horrible, evil way.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  That was blood in the water.
[10:21.000 --> 10:26.000]  And now China, obviously, is moving more troops and more of its equipment
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  into those areas that they've built, the artificial islands they've constructed
[10:30.000 --> 10:36.000]  in and around Taiwan and the entire South China Sea.
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  So here is the big escalation, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  Here's the big escalation.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  We've got all the talking heads saying that there's any type of cyber attack
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  anywhere outside of Ukraine in a NATO member
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  and that if so much as a stoplight goes out
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  and can be blamed on the Russians,
[10:57.000 --> 11:03.000]  Senator Warner and others actually said that,
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  that if they can blame a stoplight going out
[11:08.000 --> 11:11.000]  and that US troops have a car wreck,
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  that we have to invoke Article 5 and go to war with Russia
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.000]  and basically in the world as we know it.
[11:17.000 --> 11:18.000]  So there's that issue.
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  Now, even if the US government doesn't launch a cyber attack
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  against Poland or against Hungary or against the Czech Republic
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.000]  or against Germany, any NATO member,
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.000]  you know hacker groups and you know different globalist groups
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  are going to try to stir this up and accelerate this.
[11:38.000 --> 11:39.000]  They're that crazy.
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.000]  And there's private hacker groups that are totally insane as well.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  Agents of chaos.
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.000]  And so having the Ukrainian leader and the German leader
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  and the British leader, the UK leader, the Canadian leader,
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  all say, and Biden has said,
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  if there's any cyber attacks against the US or anybody else,
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  that's an act of war.
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.000]  And we're going to go to war with you.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  Remember what Hillary said back when she was running for president
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  five years ago, six years ago.
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  She said if there's a cyber attack,
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  I will attack Russia with nuclear weapons.
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  I've played the clips.
[12:17.000 --> 12:18.000]  You can type it in.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  Hillary Clinton threatens nuclear war with Russia
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  if there's a cyber attack.
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.000]  If you think it's easy to stage a false flag,
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.000]  and I do think for once the State Department
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  and others are being accurate.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  I mean, car bombs going off right as the Russians invade
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  as the pretext.
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  I mean, that's what militaries do when they invade.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  You don't think the US military doesn't do that?
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  You're not living in the real world, OK?
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  That's in military classified manuals.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  Usually you don't want to kill people if you're the good guys.
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.000]  You'll blow up a few tanks or blow up an embassy building
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  or a barracks, and that's your pretext.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  So it does look like some of those things did indeed happen.
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  And see, it's OK to talk about false flags.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  It's OK to question false flags.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  It's OK to know that's something real throughout history
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  and something that happens currently,
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  governments, corporations, universities, and individuals do.
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  Hell, I've seen at least 10 examples in the last couple of weeks
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  of black people carrying out attacks against themselves
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  to get attention and blame white people.
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.000]  And there's been cases of white women, you know,
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  bloody themselves up and saying black men raped them.
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  I mean, there are attention seekers all over the place
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.000]  at Bullcrap like that.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  And if it's going on down at the low level,
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  the individual level, you know it's going on
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  at the grand scale even more.
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  So how did Putin respond to the announcements
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  that if one cyber attack happens,
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  if somebody hacks into a red light and makes people have a wreck,
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  we are going to invoke Article 5,
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  which means we have to then have NATO go to war with Russia and Ukraine,
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  or for whatever country is attacked.
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  To have that as the talking point for weeks,
[14:01.000 --> 14:06.000]  that Russia is now going to launch a cyber attack against the West
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  is preposterous, because that would then bring in Russia's enemies
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  and have what Russia doesn't want to have,
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  a war where it gets defeated with the West, a nuclear war.
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  This is being done to look strong, to go in and to disarm Ukraine
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  because Russia for 20 years has let the West expand NATO five times.
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.000]  That's very clear.
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  And Putin said two weeks ago and a week ago, he said,
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.000]  I'm not going to invade, just say you're not going to invoke Article 5
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  and that you're not going to bring Ukraine into NATO.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  And they said, nope.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  The State Department tweeted images of large U.S. transport aircraft
[14:47.000 --> 14:55.000]  delivering pallets of very destructive anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons.
[14:55.000 --> 15:00.000]  So the West went to start a fight.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  It's got one now.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  But you've got to pull back and ask, who are the real forces here
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  that are going to consolidate power and get more control?
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  And it is the globalist.
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  I've been making this point for months, but zero heads on another excellent article.
[15:13.000 --> 15:20.000]  I was picked up from one of the other great sites out there, Alt Market,
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.000]  where they explained the globalists come out the winners in this crisis.
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  And so I'm not on Russia's side.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  I'm not, quote, on Ukraine's side.
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.000]  I'm on America's side, common sense's side and full spectrum analysis,
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  understanding who the main players are.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  So when we come back, Putin up the ante when they said,
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  OK, any cyber attacks are going to attack you.
[15:43.000 --> 15:49.000]  Putin tells Biden in posing sanctions will be seen as an act of war.
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  So Putin says that any sanctions are an act of war.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  That's coming up on the other side.
[15:55.000 --> 16:20.000]  Two, life changing, life empowering products are now back in stock after being sold out for months at infowarstore.com.
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.000]  We have a lot very, very quickly because everybody needs this old, young, black, white.
[16:25.000 --> 16:26.000]  It doesn't matter.
[16:26.000 --> 16:27.000]  You need what's in winter sun.
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  And then we have brain force ultra super fast acting, amazing, clean,
[16:33.000 --> 16:38.000]  new tropic system that is a compliment to brain force plus.
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.000]  And of course, turbo force all three of these are different formulas,
[16:41.000 --> 16:47.000]  but all three of them take your mind and take your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  That is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time.
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[16:53.000 --> 17:18.000]  If you haven't tried these products, you really need to because they are amazing infowarstore.com.
[17:23.000 --> 17:28.000]  Coming public and whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart
[17:28.000 --> 17:34.000]  because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.000]  Like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency in Marshall Law in Ontario
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.000]  and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  So pray for these folks big time.
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  It's a very serious situation.
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  Stay tuned to infowarstore.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.000]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research.
[18:05.000 --> 18:10.000]  Now, if you read the actual 2014 legislation, the U.S. government gain of function,
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.000]  deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  involving influenza, MERS and ZARS viruses.
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.000]  There's nothing about ZARS like viruses and it's a research funding pause.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  It's not a stop. It's not a prohibition.
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  It's when you come to a four-way intersection, there's the stop sign.
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  You stop. You look both ways and then you proceed.
[18:29.000 --> 18:34.000]  And so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected gain of function.
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.000]  But they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research.
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.000]  So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right.
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  They don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function.
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself.
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  That's why he hasn't been arrested.
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function.
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  They're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[18:57.000 --> 19:17.000]  Thank you, Mike. We love you.
[19:27.000 --> 19:49.000]  Thank you.
[19:49.000 --> 19:59.000]  Thank you.
[20:19.000 --> 20:34.000]  All right, folks. Thank you for joining us on the Alex Jones show on the Friday edition.
[20:34.000 --> 20:40.000]  I'm going to cover the developments in Russia for this segment and the next.
[20:40.000 --> 20:48.000]  But then in the last segment of this hour, I really dropped the ball yesterday and did not cover the COVID news.
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  And this isn't just about this news. It's just unbelievable.
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.000]  And we already knew this and had almost all the pieces of it.
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.000]  But now we have the last ones that Moderna created COVID-19.
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.000]  And then they just reverse engineered it in the lab to have a cover story.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  And they released it.
[21:05.000 --> 21:12.000]  Of course, Moderna was created by Bill Gates and others just for this event.
[21:12.000 --> 21:22.000]  But they're using this war and they're using the inflation and all the other problems to tell us, oh, the COVID restrictions are over.
[21:22.000 --> 21:31.000]  And then we just forget about how we've just been soft killed for all the numbers and governments from Europe to the UK to the US to Canada all announced last week.
[21:31.000 --> 21:37.000]  Oh, we're going to make secret all the COVID numbers now because people are misusing it.
[21:37.000 --> 21:46.000]  Yeah, it shows the mass of death, just like Moderna and Pfizer and others went to courts and said, don't ever release any of our secret studies on this.
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  And now they were for surely some and it's mass death.
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.000]  But they know the public has a short attention span.
[21:55.000 --> 22:01.000]  And so they want everyone to just now move on to Russia and what's happening there.
[22:01.000 --> 22:13.000]  That's coming up last segment of this hour. I mean, it's a huge stack, but COVID spike protein contained DNA sequences patented by Moderna three years before pandemic began.
[22:13.000 --> 22:20.000]  Scientists discovered and it hit quite a bit of newspapers last two days, but got almost no coverage.
[22:20.000 --> 22:32.000]  Fresh lab leak fears a study finds genetic code and COVID spike protein linked to Moderna patent. And of course Bill Gates and Fauci and the rest of them.
[22:32.000 --> 22:44.000]  Major German insurance company finds with US insurance companies found at least a 40% increase in death in the vaccinated.
[22:44.000 --> 22:50.000]  Unbelievable information.
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  Coming up today and of course the Indians.
[22:54.000 --> 23:01.000]  25 months ago, major Indian University that has a gene scanner, $2 billion machine.
[23:01.000 --> 23:09.000]  They scan the damn thing and they said, this is 100% manmade piece shuttle gene attached HIV spike protein put on it.
[23:09.000 --> 23:15.000]  We can see that this is synthetically made. They didn't just splice viruses. They fricking made it.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  It's nano tech.
[23:18.000 --> 23:24.000]  And we have the head of Moderna bragging about it. We have the head of Pfizer bragging just a few weeks ago.
[23:24.000 --> 23:25.000]  We play the clip.
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  Oh, it is quite good.
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  It's so wonderful.
[23:29.000 --> 23:33.000]  We actually made whole thing in lab. We not need to gain a function.
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  We have machine make whole thing.
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  We made COVID-19 to reach you.
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  Is this so happen to match the one in the wild?
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.000]  These dudes all have like weird Transylvania accents. I mean, please save us.
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  My God.
[23:51.000 --> 24:02.000]  You see, I said I'd get to it last second of this hour and now I started getting to it. It's just, it's just ridiculous.
[24:02.000 --> 24:09.000]  So let me just calm down. Let me just start over.
[24:09.000 --> 24:15.000]  We can now put the full show headline on screen, but I sure hope everybody shares.
[24:15.000 --> 24:25.000]  And that's red alert planet Earth on verge of massive nuclear war.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  Watch live.
[24:27.000 --> 24:39.000]  And you know, maybe we should just add to that headline. Putin says any sanctions will be treated as an act of war and will be responded to with force.
[24:39.000 --> 24:42.000]  And you ask, why would Putin do such a thing?
[24:42.000 --> 24:55.000]  Because all the major Western leaders came out and said, if a red light, that's a quote of a US Senator, if a red light goes out and we think it's Putin, we're going to war.
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  Sounds like a good plan.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  That sounds really restrained. That sounds really smart.
[25:01.000 --> 25:08.000]  These crazy ass lawyers that run our country like Senator Mark Warner need to be put in rubber rooms.
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.000]  You're the people that ship billions of dollars of weapons into Ukraine.
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.000]  You're the ones that kept poking Russia in the nose.
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  And now look what you've done.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  Finally found somebody you couldn't push around.
[25:23.000 --> 25:30.000]  Just like Napoleon and just like Hitler, you dumb asses.
[25:30.000 --> 25:42.000]  And then you, Trump had a plan with the military and with private contractors for a fraction of the price, less than 10% of the trillion dollar cost every few years, over $150 billion a year.
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.000]  He had plans for $10 billion a year to stabilize Afghanistan and pull out of there.
[25:47.000 --> 25:54.000]  And instead, they just evacuated the military first on purpose, folks, to fiasco all that.
[25:54.000 --> 26:02.000]  Because globalist up top wanted to then lure China and lure Russia into these military actions.
[26:02.000 --> 26:09.000]  Instead of you play 20 moves ahead, you can see where all this is going.
[26:09.000 --> 26:16.000]  Yeah, I mean, you've got the US sending 180 tons of weapons to Ukraine and more on the way.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  And now you've seen the response of that.
[26:18.000 --> 26:26.000]  I mean, can you imagine if the United States had Russian troops on its border?
[26:26.000 --> 26:34.000]  And if the Russians were giving the Mexicans $5 billion in anti-aircraft missiles and anti-tank missiles, what do you think the US would do?
[26:34.000 --> 26:45.000]  The US would, back when we had real presidents, within a week of it being discovered, the US would be hitting it with airstrikes and attacking, just like in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[26:45.000 --> 26:54.000]  And of course, the Russians wouldn't dare do something like that because they know that would start a nuclear war.
[26:54.000 --> 27:03.000]  But the United States does because they've got a bunch of lawyers like Mark Warner running things that are anti-free speech, anti-God, and anti-family,
[27:03.000 --> 27:11.000]  and who think because they stole America and all of our incredible intelligence and science that they are incredible and they are exceptional.
[27:11.000 --> 27:19.000]  And what they are is exceptionally evil and stupid and living in their own damn bubbles and they're going to get everybody killed, Warner.
[27:19.000 --> 27:30.000]  Then there won't be the young pages to pull your seat out for you and kiss your ass all day while you run around starting fights with everybody.
[27:30.000 --> 27:40.000]  All these men showing off to each other how tough they are because they're willing to start a war with our young men and women.
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  And you better believe there's US troops all over Ukraine right now.
[27:45.000 --> 27:51.000]  And I've talked to a lot of smart people. They think this will be over in the next day or two and that Ukraine will capitulate.
[27:51.000 --> 27:58.000]  If they don't, then it becomes a real fiasco.
[27:58.000 --> 28:06.000]  But the tit for tat is now accelerating. Putin tells Biden imposing sanctions will be seen as an act of war as Biden prepares sanctions.
[28:06.000 --> 28:13.000]  And I love the quote by Obama today, warning Biden that sanctions will cause a lot of pain and problems.
[28:13.000 --> 28:20.000]  But it's worth it even though it's going to cost the average American thousands of dollars in energy price increases.
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000]  Says Obama who has a hundred million dollar Netflix deal last time I checked.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  Says Obama that got a, what was it, a 10 million, 20 million dollar book deal?
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.000]  I mean the guy's worth hundreds of millions of dollars. He didn't earn any of it.
[28:33.000 --> 28:42.000]  He's just given it because he's a former president. He's got a giant mansion in Martha's Vineyard, a giant mansion in Hawaii on the beach.
[28:42.000 --> 28:48.000]  But you can handle a couple thousand dollars extra. Oh, no, you can't. Oh, sorry.
[28:48.000 --> 28:52.000]  Well, you'll just live on the side of the street. See how easy that is?
[28:52.000 --> 28:59.000]  These damn people are out of control and they are menaces. Well, they're right back.
[28:59.000 --> 29:07.000]  I've been on air more than 25 years. And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago,
[29:07.000 --> 29:13.000]  I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[29:13.000 --> 29:18.000]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[29:18.000 --> 29:23.000]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[29:23.000 --> 29:26.000]  It's just like you need oxygen. You die in four minutes without oxygen.
[29:26.000 --> 29:30.000]  You die in five or six days without water. You die in a month without food.
[29:30.000 --> 29:36.000]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need.
[29:36.000 --> 29:41.000]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[29:41.000 --> 29:51.000]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's defenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[29:51.000 --> 29:59.000]  Everybody, old, young, black, white, you need vitamin D3. This is the best quality out there and it funds the info war 50% off.
[29:59.000 --> 30:09.000]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  And when it comes to information, boy is that true.
[30:12.000 --> 30:25.000]  Today we see the entire global corrupt, anti-human depopulation, great reset combine, trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision.
[30:25.000 --> 30:41.000]  Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[30:41.000 --> 30:48.000]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[30:48.000 --> 30:52.000]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[30:52.000 --> 30:56.000]  And that's why it's hard to share info wars links and band up video links.
[30:56.000 --> 31:12.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[31:26.000 --> 31:35.000]  X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at infowarshot.com.
[31:35.000 --> 31:43.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to get it on average, you really need to experience X3.
[31:43.000 --> 31:46.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[31:46.000 --> 31:56.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body, it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the info war, a true 360 win.
[31:56.000 --> 32:07.000]  So again, X3, back at stock, 50% off at limited time.
[32:07.000 --> 32:18.000]  From the words of Chuck Paulinique's Fight Club, dear globalist leaders of the great reset, the people you're trying to step on, we're everyone you depend on.
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.000]  We're the people who do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner.
[32:22.000 --> 32:33.000]  We make your bed, we guard you while you're asleep, we drive the ambulances, we direct your call, we are cooks and we are taxi drivers and we know everything about you.
[32:33.000 --> 32:37.000]  We process your insurance claims and credit card charges.
[32:37.000 --> 32:39.000]  We control every part of your life.
[32:39.000 --> 32:46.000]  We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars.
[32:46.000 --> 32:50.000]  But we won't, and we're just learning this fact.
[32:50.000 --> 32:53.000]  So don't fuck with us.
[32:53.000 --> 33:00.000]  Support independent media at infowarstore.com.
[33:00.000 --> 33:10.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:10.000 --> 33:31.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.000 --> 33:44.000]  I knew, when I got on air, 28 years ago, that if we exposed the globalist plan decades before, that when they actually launched their operation, we would have a very good chance of beating them.
[33:44.000 --> 33:52.000]  Because enough people would be aware of the plan, but also others would marvel at the fact that so many others had known what was coming.
[33:52.000 --> 33:58.000]  Everything I foresaw has taken place, except one thing.
[33:58.000 --> 34:04.000]  I never imagined that it would be me as one of the main leaders in the fight.
[34:04.000 --> 34:09.000]  I believe that there were going to be smarter men, better men, that people cared.
[34:09.000 --> 34:14.000]  And that all these bankers and politicians and lawyers just didn't know most of them.
[34:14.000 --> 34:23.000]  And that if I did the right thing and spoke up and raised the alarm, better men than I would come to my aid and that we could defeat them.
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  And I guess that did happen. It just took a long time.
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.000]  And now you see a lot of amazing people standing up and fighting back and speaking out.
[34:31.000 --> 34:34.000]  But it's been the audience of this broadcast.
[34:34.000 --> 34:44.000]  I know you don't want the credit. You want freedom. You want a future. You want a relationship with God. I understand.
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.000]  But you need to let it sink in.
[34:47.000 --> 34:57.000]  Those of you that have been listening 26, 27 years, 20 years, 10 years, 5 years, 6 months or even a day, you get all the credit.
[34:57.000 --> 35:04.000]  Because if it wasn't for you believing in Info Wars and supporting us and caring enough to tune in and then tell others about the broadcast,
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  the world would be in a much, much worse position right now.
[35:09.000 --> 35:17.000]  They were going to continue on with the COVID tyranny, unabated, until you got informed and educated others and triggered the chain reaction of others,
[35:17.000 --> 35:21.000]  waking up others, who wake up others, that wake up others, that wake up others, who wake up others.
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  It's so important not to just tell somebody about this show or share a video with them or an article from somebody else that's informative.
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.000]  You got to explain, then you got to share it and tell them to share it and then tell them to share it.
[35:31.000 --> 35:40.000]  And it's that paying it forward that is power.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  And that's how we turn this around.
[35:42.000 --> 35:48.000]  So yeah, we're in a world of hurt and things aren't going to be smooth here for a long time.
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.000]  But we can see the promised land off of the distance, ladies and gentlemen. It's not a mirage.
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  And we got to get there.
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  It's like your boat sinks and you're two miles from land and you're not a very good swimmer.
[35:59.000 --> 36:04.000]  Well, you better swim or you're going to die.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  And on your way there, jellyfish stings you.
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.000]  Well, you better just ignore the pain and keep going or you're going to gulp water and go to the bottom and die.
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  So yeah, we're two miles offshore in waves and jellyfish.
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.000]  And guess what? You just better point your ass at the shore and start going for the shore.
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  Because on our backs are our children and future generations.
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.000]  So stop being a bunch of wimps and stop caring what people think about you on the other side
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.000]  and just execute the information out there and don't stop.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  And we will win.
[36:32.000 --> 36:38.000]  We do not have a choice.
[36:38.000 --> 36:50.000]  Now, the globalists never stop. They never give up.
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  And they're really pissed at Russia for not being fully under their control.
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.000]  And so they are pushing Russia into a fight.
[36:57.000 --> 37:03.000]  And I understand that Russia was surrounded, weapons were on its border.
[37:03.000 --> 37:09.000]  And that the globalist system was setting Russia up for war and defeat.
[37:09.000 --> 37:14.000]  But I think Putin made a major mistake going into Ukraine.
[37:14.000 --> 37:22.000]  And long term, the globalists are going to try to trigger a larger war.
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  And I understand that it was one of the choices out of a list of bad choices.
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  And maybe Putin will be born out to have stabilized things with this.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  And that remains to be seen.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  But I'm here to tell you, as I said a couple of days ago when this was really kicking off,
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.000]  I said, the West has put all these sanctions on Russia.
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.000]  Russia is putting sanctions on fertilizer and potash.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  That's only going to hurt poor people.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  And it's going to hurt Russians that sell it.
[37:49.000 --> 37:56.000]  And I think Putin should not put sanctions on the West when the West put sanctions on them.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  Because that's going to hurt Russians just as much as it hurts the outside.
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  And the globalists don't care because they print all the money.
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.000]  And the average person having sanctions put on them won't know that it was even tet for tat.
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.000]  And so I think Putin's made his point going into Ukraine.
[38:13.000 --> 38:18.000]  If Russia continues to match the West now with what the West does to Russia,
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  we're going to get into a full-scale war here.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  And maybe that's what we deserve.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  Maybe we deserve to all die because we've killed so many unborn children,
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  and we've got devil worship all over TV.
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  But you know what? I'm a selfish person, and I like my children,
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  and I just don't want a nuclear war right now.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  And everybody better get this through their head.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  We've lived in relative peace in this country,
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  where all the West of the world has been a hellhole in most areas,
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  in war, in starvation, in famine.
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  For so long, we just think we're insulated.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  Americans are in a bubble.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  Most Americans don't even have a passport, never left the country.
[38:51.000 --> 38:56.000]  A third of the public's ever left their state, on average.
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.000]  And the people in D.C. are an even worse bubble of delusional BS.
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  I mean, these people are arrogant scum.
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  They were picked and brought in there because they're arrogant scum.
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  And they've gotten defeat and war and death written all over them.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  These people are losers.
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  We have cancer in our government.
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  And we don't have any business going around war with Russia
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  with this kind of crap going on.
[39:24.000 --> 39:29.000]  But Biden says, oh my gosh, we're going to put sanctions on everything,
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.000]  on your energy, everything else.
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  And now Putin says, well, that's an act of war.
[39:35.000 --> 39:42.000]  And then the U.K. bans a Russian airline.
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.000]  So now Moscow bans U.K. aircraft period from Russian airspace
[39:47.000 --> 39:54.000]  and retaliation for aero-flot sanctions.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  And that's how it starts.
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  Fertilizer one day, flights the next.
[39:59.000 --> 40:00.000]  And isn't it funny?
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  What did COVID do?
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  The excuse of COVID, the lockdowns, it cut off the growing of food.
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  It cut off the infrastructure.
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.000]  It cut back the energy.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  It annihilated the fertilizer.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  It caused 40 plus million people to die.
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.000]  Bigger than any war since World War II.
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  And that's just a blip.
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  That's not even discussed by the liberals and their mask
[40:21.000 --> 40:27.000]  and their lecturing and all of their controls.
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  The enemy is the globalist.
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.000]  The enemy is Hollywood.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  The enemy is the left.
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.000]  The enemy is the disease of their grandstanding.
[40:34.000 --> 40:40.000]  And they're moralizing when they're the worst people this planet has ever seen.
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  And are envious and hyper-competitive to the point,
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  not in a dominant alpha way,
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  but where they're competitive, where they just burn your house down
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  because they're jealous of it instead of realizing that nice house
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.000]  makes your house that isn't as nice better in value.
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  Because there's good competition that's about science and technology
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  and working together and having real competition,
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  which the left wants to get rid of that type of competition
[41:03.000 --> 41:06.000]  and then have group competition because you're gay or you're straight
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  or you're this or you're that.
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.000]  And now you've got to invade or destroy something or vandalize it
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  because you're envious of it because it's too beautiful.
[41:15.000 --> 41:16.000]  It's too powerful.
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  It's too amazing.
[41:17.000 --> 41:23.000]  Instead of adopting things that are better and making yourself better,
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  the left are at war with themselves and have such self-loathing
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  and such deep disgust for themselves.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  They don't love themselves.
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  They don't know themselves that they project that onto all of us.
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  See, I really like myself.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  I've got problems. I don't like those.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  But I really like myself. I really like my family.
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  I really like my family history.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  I really like the stars and the trees.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  And I really like people that have happy families.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  And I don't envy people that have a gorgeous wife
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  or dudes that are more handsome than me or any of that
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  because I understand that's all part of our shared wealth together.
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  But you get around the average leftist.
[41:56.000 --> 42:02.000]  They are hateful, demonic sacks of filth
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  that will never stop pushing and never stop attacking
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  until they get control of absolutely everything
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  and run it into the damn ground.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  And there are going to be people around the world
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  that ain't going to put up with it.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  And you're seeing that right now with Russia.
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  The left has successfully feminized America, broken our back,
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  done all this crap, didn't happen in Russia.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  Even after 85 years of New World Order leftist rulership.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  And now we see the response of it and it's a bad thing.
[42:32.000 --> 42:37.000]  And so we're hurtling towards a new war, an expanding crisis.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  I'm going to cover it more in the second hour.
[42:39.000 --> 42:40.000]  We got so much breaking.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  But I want to get into this huge cover news
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  and I mentioned earlier when we come back because it is.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  It is just absolute.
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  Bioweapon confirmed treason against America and the world.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  It is just open and shut case.
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.000]  All these executives should be immediately arrested
[42:55.000 --> 43:00.000]  along with Bill Gates right now.
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  You need what's in Winter Sun.
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  And then we have Brain Force Ultra.
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  Super fast acting, amazing, clean,
[43:33.000 --> 43:38.000]  Neutropic system that is a compliment to Brain Force Plus
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  and of course Turbo Force.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  All three of these are different formulas,
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  but all three of them take your mind
[43:44.000 --> 43:47.000]  and take your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.
[43:47.000 --> 43:52.000]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time.
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.000]  All these products you really need to because they are amazing.
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.000]  infowarstore.com
[44:00.000 --> 44:04.000]  There is very little contemporary study in the world
[44:04.000 --> 44:07.000]  of the planet's ruling class.
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  Not in Communist China, not in Mexico,
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.000]  not in the United States, not anywhere.
[44:13.000 --> 44:16.000]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  And that's done by design.
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  The large central banks that basically control the planet
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.000]  penalize and target any academics that look into,
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  say, the Anglo-American establishment
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  the founder of the Bilderberg Group,
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  the Trilateral Commission of the United Nations,
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  Until ten years ago the media said
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  the control corporate media of the Bilderberg Group didn't exist.
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  Well now the Bilderberg Group is public,
[44:41.000 --> 44:44.000]  it's former head still on the steering committee,
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.000]  it's called Schwab and he has set up the great reset
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  in global government.
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  If as a liberty movement worldwide,
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  we don't address the globalist head on,
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  about the second to your worldwide
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  authoritarian corporate takeover,
[44:57.000 --> 44:58.000]  we don't have a shot.
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  If you expose them, we can beat them easily.
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.000]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart,
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  deep in my soul I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet.
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.000]  I've had a lot of loss like everybody else has.
[45:11.000 --> 45:18.000]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom
[45:18.000 --> 45:23.000]  that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.000]  And now we're just thrown it all away.
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  And I see the general public in a medically induced,
[45:30.000 --> 45:36.000]  scientifically induced, behavioral psychologically controlled tranty.
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.000]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist beaker under
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  and it's so incredibly sad.
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.000]  But this is the process of birth and then growth
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.000]  and then coming back to life again.
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.000]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.000]  and control this process of decadence and collapse
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  to actually end the species as we know it.
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.000]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability,
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.000]  anything that's really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.000]  is going to be hard to attain.
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.000]  And when it comes to information, boy is that true today.
[46:13.000 --> 46:18.000]  We see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation,
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  great reset combine,
[46:20.000 --> 46:23.000]  trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes,
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  their transhumanist nightmare vision,
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  suppressing the voices of good people all around the world
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.000]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID-19 area,
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  their world's going to end in 2030,
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  And none of it can succeed.
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  None of it can actually be carried out
[46:46.000 --> 46:49.000]  unless everybody is silenced and gaslit.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  And that's why truth comes with hard work
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  and with research and with diligence.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  And that's why it's hard to share in Full Wars links
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  and band up video links.
[46:58.000 --> 47:22.000]  Share them now more than ever.
[47:22.000 --> 47:31.000]  Oh, beautiful, far heroes proved
[47:31.000 --> 47:40.000]  in liberating strife
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.000]  whom more than self
[47:43.000 --> 47:48.000]  fell country loved
[47:48.000 --> 47:53.000]  and immersed in more than life.
[47:53.000 --> 48:00.000]  Welcome back, folks.
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.000]  I'm going to be taking your phone calls next hour
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  and the end of the third hour as well.
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  And so let's go ahead and give the number out now
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  so people can call in first-time callers,
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  long-time callers, you agree, you disagree.
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.000]  A toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[48:24.000 --> 48:29.000]  877-789-Alex.
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  And if you can get through from Europe
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  anywhere in the battle theater,
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  we'll put you to the head of the line
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  877-789-2539.
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  Notice as soon as the world woke up to COVID-19
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  being made in the lab and that the vaccines
[48:47.000 --> 48:50.000]  aren't vaccines and don't protect you and make you sick.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  And as soon as there was demonstrations all over the world,
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  suddenly they announced an end to all the restrictions
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  would be coming in a few months.
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  But in most areas, they're actually not getting
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  rid of the restrictions.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  They're just telling you they're going away.
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.000]  So you think you won the fight.
[49:09.000 --> 49:15.000]  When you turn your back, they stick the knife in.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  And that's why even I have dropped the ball.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  How could you not drop the ball with this huge
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  historical war taking place that's so sad
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  and didn't cover the last two days of COVID news?
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  It is, again, I don't just say this to say,
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  oh, today's the biggest news.
[49:29.000 --> 49:32.000]  It just keeps more and more coming out.
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  It's like you're reading an action-adventure novel
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  and you're getting down to the last chapters
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  and it just gets more intense and all the threads come together.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  Well, this isn't a novel.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  This isn't a science fiction dystopic novel.
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  This is the real world.
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.000]  And I got it right here.
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  I mean, really, we should, like, have emergency
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  broadcast for 24 hours over this.
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.000]  I should be running around the streets, waving it around.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  But instead it's just, oh, it's just something else on the show.
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  So when everybody really have that burn into your brains,
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  including Alex Jones, to point at myself,
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.000]  you need to make a bigger deal out of this, Jones.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  You need to point this out.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  What is your problem?
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.000]  Because this is a lot more dead people that have died in Ukraine
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  or potentially could even die.
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  This is biological war carried out by global corporations
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  and the UN to bring in a biomedical, worldwide tyranny
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  so they can collapse the world economy
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  and have a digital noose around all our necks
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.000]  and control us for the rest of our miserable lives.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  So a lot of you tuned in are going to say,
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  I've already read these articles. I've already heard this.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  I've already seen this because the Indians,
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.000]  they get the credit, majored their top university of biogenetics,
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  got the virus, scanned six different samples of it.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  And so this is completely man-made.
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  All the parts of it were made in a lab.
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  They're all cut together. They're synthetic.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  And they explained how it was synthetic.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  It was no debate.
[50:57.000 --> 51:01.000]  They're saying it's one out of three billion chances
[51:01.000 --> 51:06.000]  that just one part of COVID-19 could not be made in a lab.
[51:06.000 --> 51:12.000]  When you put all the pieces together, it's basically impossible.
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  And that's why they're on TV suddenly going,
[51:17.000 --> 51:21.000]  oh, yeah, I'm the CEO of Pfizer. I'm the CEO of Moderna.
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.000]  We just want to come on Bloomberg or come on CNBC
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.000]  and just tell you that we didn't ever need to gain a function
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  in that lab in China. We made it in the lab.
[51:31.000 --> 51:35.000]  And they didn't just make it later to test it.
[51:35.000 --> 51:42.000]  They did it in 2016 bigger than my hometown Dallas.
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  That ought to piss you off. I had friends die.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  My dad almost died.
[51:47.000 --> 51:50.000]  My mother says the sickest she's ever been
[51:50.000 --> 51:57.000]  after a flu shot almost killed her 30 years ago.
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  Watch Mom taking flu shots because she was on the UT master swim team
[52:00.000 --> 52:03.000]  and they told him to.
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.000]  They almost killed her.
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.000]  She retired her out of competitive sports.
[52:08.000 --> 52:14.000]  So that's the world we live in here, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  These people have killed my friends.
[52:17.000 --> 52:24.000]  They almost killed Rob Do. I'm pissed.
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.000]  You know, I don't particularly like Vladimir Putin invading Ukraine
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  even though it's in their interest because that brings me closer
[52:29.000 --> 52:33.000]  to nuclear war and my family dying.
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.000]  But if I'm mad at Vladimir Putin,
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.000]  I'm a thousand times more pissed at Fauci and Bill Gates
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  because they on purpose started this, cooked it up,
[52:43.000 --> 52:46.000]  released it, and it came out a year and a half ago
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  in the documents, in the emails. Remember?
[52:49.000 --> 52:54.000]  That in November and December of 2019, months before they announced
[52:54.000 --> 52:58.000]  the viruses out there, they go, OK, here's the sequences
[52:58.000 --> 53:03.000]  that we've isolated here of this virus that's COVID-19.
[53:03.000 --> 53:07.000]  Get the vaccine makers ready and they sent back to the vaccine makers
[53:07.000 --> 53:13.000]  what they wanted them to make in their labs artificially
[53:13.000 --> 53:18.000]  with the code and then they can print out the viruses.
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  And they did it. And so the Indians get the virus a few months later,
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  go, this is man-made. What the hell's this?
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  And we have the documents where Dazik approached the Pentagon in 2017
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.000]  and said, we got a simulant of the spike protein virus.
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.000]  It's a COVID SARS virus that we can spray in the air in China.
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  And the Pentagon said, we're going to start a war with China.
[53:37.000 --> 53:40.000]  You lunatic. Oh, no, no, it's to test it on bats.
[53:40.000 --> 53:44.000]  It probably won't get any humans sick.
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  So they can then frame and leverage the Pentagon.
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  It's all about getting our governments to sign on to stuff,
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  getting Trump to sign on, getting the military to sign on.
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  So once it's out there, now Big Pharma can truly hold the government hostage.
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  And you notice they didn't get that part of the plan done,
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.000]  but they did get over 100 governments, Brazil refused,
[54:03.000 --> 54:07.000]  the reason we have the documents, where they signed secret agreements
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  with FEMA and other emergency groups in other countries
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.000]  to sign over the national parks and military bases to Pfizer
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  if there was ever a problem from the experimental shot,
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  which they knew would have a problem.
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.000]  And now as this all comes out over the next few years,
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  and the country goes bankrupt from it,
[54:24.000 --> 54:28.000]  when Pfizer gets in trouble, they get the land and the military bases.
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  I mean, think of the megalomania.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  We're not going to follow those agreements.
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.000]  You're all going to go to prison.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  You're all going to get punished.
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  Or we can let them continue to kill us and do all this
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  and run us through the ringer.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  So here's the articles.
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.000]  COVID spike protein contains DNA sequences patented by Moderna
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.000]  three years before pandemic began, over three years.
[54:52.000 --> 54:57.000]  Scientists discover the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains a DNA sequence
[54:57.000 --> 55:01.000]  identical to a genetic code patented by pharmaceutical company Moderna
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  three years before the COVID pandemic emerged, according to researchers.
[55:05.000 --> 55:10.000]  A study published in Frontiers of Aurology by prestigious scientists,
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  we'll click on that for folks from the short to the TV viewers,
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  on Monday by an international team of researchers
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.000]  found that SARS-CoV-2 fervent cleavage,
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  we reported on this two years ago,
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.000]  site FCS contains a tiny bit of genetic code
[55:25.000 --> 55:30.000]  identical to a part of gene patented by Moderna in 2016.
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  Did you hear what we just said?
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  It's not just man-made.
[55:35.000 --> 55:39.000]  We have the fricking patent.
[55:39.000 --> 55:44.000]  And it's impossible for that to occur naturally.
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  And we have every angle of it.
[55:47.000 --> 55:54.000]  February 4th, 2016.
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.000]  And I'm sorry, I said billion from memory, I apologize.
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.000]  The researchers claim that since there is a one in three trillion chance
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  of Moderna's patented sequence randomly appearing through natural
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  evolutions that the China virus might have mutated during experiments
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  on human cells in a lab.
[56:12.000 --> 56:18.000]  Gee, think so.
[56:18.000 --> 56:21.000]  And then we already have them months before it's announced it's out saying,
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  okay, here's what we tell the vaccine makers.
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  This is what they make.
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.000]  This spike protein, this thing they own the patent to,
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  they get money from that then grows in your body as a prion crystal.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  So even though you don't have the whole virus, you now have the prion crystal
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  from the vaccine or from the natural occurring,
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  and then it just keeps coming back forever.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  Unless you do mitigating things that can get rid of it, we know.
[56:45.000 --> 56:51.000]  Like glutathione, like lots of zinc, like lots of vitamin D3, ivermectin.
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  Not just when you're sick, but after.
[56:54.000 --> 56:59.000]  I mean, let me tell you, after I had Delta, I ain't ever been the same.
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  My dad was like Frankenstein for three months.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  Like he had Alzheimer's, he's back now.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  But this isn't a fricking game, people.
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  And it's grows in your body, and they hit us with one hell of a bio weapon.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  And that's just one article out of the stack here.
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  I got a whole stack of insurance companies admitting their, I mean,
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  admitting everybody's dying.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  They basically killed us.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  Now, more insurance companies are confirming highest death rate
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  since they recorded people taking the shot.
[57:26.000 --> 57:27.000]  I mean, they murdered us.
[57:27.000 --> 57:28.000]  They did it.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  They hit us with a bio weapon.
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  And if you think they're stopped, if you think you're safe, you're not.
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.000]  Until they all go to prison and this all comes out, nobody on earth is safe.
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  But instead, we're all talking about Putin and the Ukraine all day long.
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  They'll be back with hour number two. Stay with us.
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.000]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.000]  And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago,
[57:57.000 --> 58:02.000]  I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[58:02.000 --> 58:05.000]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day,
[58:05.000 --> 58:08.000]  whether you're black or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.000]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  It's just like you need oxygen.
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  You die in four minutes without oxygen.
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  You die in five or six days without water.
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  You die in a month without food.
[58:20.000 --> 58:26.000]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need.
[58:26.000 --> 58:31.000]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[58:31.000 --> 58:36.000]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's defenses
[58:36.000 --> 58:41.000]  available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[58:41.000 --> 58:45.000]  Everybody, old, young, black, white, you need vitamin D3.
[58:45.000 --> 58:49.000]  This is the best quality out there and it funds the info war 50% off.
[58:49.000 --> 58:56.000]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  and the world at large.
[58:58.000 --> 59:02.000]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of,
[59:02.000 --> 59:06.000]  our new sleep support formula down and out is just the thing.
[59:06.000 --> 59:13.000]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[59:13.000 --> 59:20.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product knockout with down and out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside
[59:20.000 --> 59:23.000]  are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[59:23.000 --> 59:28.000]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower,
[59:32.000 --> 59:39.000]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[59:39.000 --> 59:45.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[59:45.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  Sell it out now at infowarstore.com.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two and we got loaded phone lines.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  I'm going to start phone calls.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  Next segment.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  We've got so much to hit, but I'm going to air this now, the full compilation.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  It's six, seven minutes long. It's up on band.video right now.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  The video clip that's 27 seconds long has got millions of views on the Internet right now all over the place.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  There's this clips everywhere.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  Million here, 600,000 there, 300,000 there, hundreds of copies.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  It's everywhere.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  It's incredible where I came out and said look for war by early 2022 by the end of February.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  And I'm saying is that my prediction is incredible.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  It's incredible how viral this is going.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  So I figured why don't I just go ahead and play a little bit more of this in context.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  This is what the archive is found just with a couple hours looking around in the last five months. Here it is.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  I think a big war is about to start something big is about to go down.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  I even have Biden stand down and receive a first strike to our military bases from China. My guts never been wrong.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  And I keep having very intense nightmares the last month that the United States is going to be hit by nuclear weapons by China and is going to stand down and are going to receive the attack.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  And I've looked at all the evidence too. They're preparing us with staying your homes.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  They're just getting us ready for the disaster. They're not going to hit the main cities. They're going to hit the military bases.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  Very good chance that they're going to either blow the entire power grid with the MPs, which they've been conditioning us to get ready for, or they're going to hit us with a first strike.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  And you're like, oh, that's crazy. No, this is war, folks. America's over. It's gone.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  Trump was removed. Of course, he won in a giant landslide. They weren't going to allow that to happen.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  And that's why when you look at the press secretary and all Biden's people, they are scared.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  And if I was them, I'd be scared too, because they're going to be removed as soon as the Chinese take over.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  So I just I got to be honest with you, folks. It's all over. OK, it's all over.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  We're about to be hit with nuclear weapons. The military stood down. Everything's going.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  I'm sorry, it's over. It's all over. First is biological, bacteriological virus. Next is the cyber, which they tell us are the next nuclear.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Lay that out. Yes, the cyber warfare basically is already taking place with all these hackers that are working constantly.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  And then, of course, we have the nuclear. Now, the nuclear is already starting to be announced. China has.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  Here it is. They threatened China threatened to nuke Taiwan yesterday. Here's the headline.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  Fox News. Go ahead. Keep going. Official Chinese Daily. They said we will nuke Japan.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  So as you can see, gradually these free phases of this period that we unfortunately going to be leaving and that will, of course, diminish the population of the F.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  The smart money is on a war with China. And I don't want a war. But we're looking at a giant war in February right now.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  Currently, that's the projections with the top people on the earth who claim they're not with the new order combine is war in February.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  And this is the type of time like right before World War One, right before World War Two, when everything kicks off.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  And I hope that doesn't happen. But currently, that is the trajectory we're on. And there is a consensus on that.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  And a large consensus. I don't mean a consensus with people that just live here in Austin, the new main power hub of the country.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  I'm talking about all over the world. We have contacts and General Flynn thinks war with China is imminent.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  He was raised the alarm 10 years ago on that. And that's why they got mad at him.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  And then we go on to also talk about all the smart people I talked to Russia and China. And of course, when Russia moves against Ukraine.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  Two life changing, life empowering products are now back in stock after being sold out for months and infowarstore.com.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  Winter Sun is the highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue. It also has vitamin K, critical fear immune system and so much more.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  It's 50% off despite the fact it's going to sell out very, very quickly because everybody needs this old, young, black, white.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  It doesn't matter. You need what's in Winter Sun. And then we have brain force ultra super fast acting, amazing, clean,
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  Neutropic system that is a compliment to brain force plus, and of course, turbo force. All three of these are different formulas.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  But all three of them take your mind and take your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time. Thank you all for your support. If you haven't tried these products, you really need to because they are amazing.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  All right, we're going to go to your phone calls right now. Carlos and Ivan and Chase and Steve and Armand and Mark and bone crusher Jack Alain,
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  Mankind and others here in just a moment.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  I don't know how I in the last hour just hope don't come back to the same thing again in case new people join us, which I know they did.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  Confirmed mainstream news, major university research facilities and major viral publications, medical publications,
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  scientific publications, that COVID-19 was made in a lab and that the pieces of it were patented in 2016 by Moderna,
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  which was set up and prepared and ready for several years ahead of it with the one mission to deliver the deadly injection masquerading as a vaccine.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  Smoking gun of smoking guns and I only got to a few of the big articles in and around that after I take a bunch of calls.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  I'm going to get into some more of the meat of that situation.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  I want to go to your phone calls. I want to just recap some points about the situation unfolding in Ukraine and explain something.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  I know the audience already knows this, but my sources, the information I saw and everything going on said by February, late February,
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  China starts moving and Russia starts moving.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  That's not a hard call because if they're going to move, they're going to move together.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  And now China is making more and more of those type of statements, but they've also said that they'd like Putin to obviously meet
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  with the Ukrainian president and talk about an armistice and a demilitarization of the area, but it got leaked a few days ago that the Chinese talking points
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  to the media of censorship and control saying we're with Russia and we're with Russia's invasion, but we want to act like we're neutral
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  so that we can move against our targets is basically what they said.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  That was in yesterday's stack. Will you guys reprint me that? The headline was Chinese government documents directing censorship to the media,
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Chinese government talking points to the media, directing Ukraine coverage leaked, something like that.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  And it was a fascinating article. We could spend a whole hour just reading that. It was amazing. And the Chinese admit that's a real document.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  So that is just such a huge deal as well. But the big takeaway here is the West is saying, which is lobelous run,
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  that we're going to put massive sanctions on you. And if you cyber attack us in any way, which is easy to frame Russia for that,
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  that came out the CIA documents involved seven years ago, that we will then take that as an act of war and a violation of Article 5 in NATO.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  If any NATO state has as much as a red light get hacked, we take that as an act of war. That is such a big deal.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  That is such a huge deal. And then Putin responded back saying, well, any sanctions against us are an act of war.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it very clear to U.S. President Joe Biden that imposing sanctions will be countered and considered an act of war.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  It comes as President Joe Biden and his Ukrainian counterpart will speak by phone today, I mean growing fears of Russian military buildup.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  And that came out weeks ago and that's another one of his statements now, reissuing those statements.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  So it's a very, very serious situation. I want to play you a couple clips here. Then we'll go to your phone calls.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  This is Biden, if you'll remember, once he first got in office, had a cyber drill with the usual suspects,
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  some people that brought us COVID-19, and Russia was in on the cyber drill.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  And Biden gave them 18 entities that if they're attacked, we will go to war with Russia.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  Well, it's very easy to frame someone as being a hacker.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  It's very easy to take over somebody's computer and then send messages from it and then claim that that's where the attack came from.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  Spoofing is as old as telephones.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  And Captain Crunch, all the things he did.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  I'm not talking about the serial folks, I don't know what Captain Crunch is, we've had him on the show.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  He could whistle into phones and control them as they operate off tones.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  They could call the White House and get Nixon on the phone or all sorts of crazy stuff.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  And that was in the 70s, but I'm digressing, this is just incredible. Here is Biden.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  Another area we spent a great deal of time on was cyber and cybersecurity.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  I talked about the proposition that certain critical infrastructure should be off limits to attack, period.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  By cyber or any other means, I gave them a list.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  If I'm not mistaken, I don't have in front of me 16 specific entities.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  16 defined as critical infrastructure under U.S. policy from the energy sector to our water systems.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  Of course, the principle is one thing. It has to be backed up by practice.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  You know what's funny about everything Biden says?
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  Who's destroying dams across the U.S.?
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  Who's shut off over 2,000 pipelines around the United States, including the Keystone Pipeline?
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  Biden, who is going after gas-powered cars?
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  Who shut down two-thirds of the oil leases in this country and won't allow any new leases in more than half the nation?
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  And has shut down drilling in the Gulf of Mexico?
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  When it's just that another country comes and does it, if we're not doing it, or another company, it's not the Russians.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  It's not the Russians cutting off our pipelines, folks.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  And then I'm sure they'll have a Rolling Stone article or a CNN report.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  Look at Jones' shill for Putin.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  No, this isn't about Putin.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  This is about the globalist cutting off our damn power, and it makes me mad.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  And so that's where we are.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  So they're the ones shutting off our infrastructure.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  They're the ones brainwashing our kids.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  They're the ones destroying our culture.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  Here is Senator Mark Warner on television talking about how we could get into a nuclear war via Article 5 if the Russians do so much as turn off a stoplight.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  Which, again, how the hell do you prove who does it?
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  Any bad actor, any criminal group, or any globalist group, or any government can and will launch attacks in blame, Russia.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  You know, false flags, the thing you're not supposed to talk about.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  Here it is.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  Is it Russia unleashes its full cyber power against Ukraine?
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  Once you put malware into the wild, in a sense, it knows no geographic boundaries.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  So if the Russians decide they're going to try to turn off the power, turn off all the electricity all across Ukraine,
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  very likely that may turn off the power in eastern Poland and eastern Romania.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  That could affect our troops.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  If suddenly hospitals are shut down, if those NATO troops, American troops, somehow have a car accident because the stoplights don't work.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  We are suddenly in an area, hypothetically, on Article 5, where one NATO country is attacked.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  We all have to come to each other's aid.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  So Werner is certainly right. That hypothetical that he outlined could happen.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  Any cyber attack on Ukraine could well affect the infrastructure of their Eastern European countries.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  That would be bad.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  It would be a crime.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  The civilized world would deplore it.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  But Article 5 is not a mechanical mechanism.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  Human beings have to decide to invoke it.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  And the question is, is what the senator just described something that is worth risking a nuclear conflict over?
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  And that is something we should pause very deeply to think about in the most sober possible way.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  That's good.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  We hope that our leaders are.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  Yeah.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  But not all of them.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  And that's what we're dealing with here, ladies and gentlemen, is that if you look at all the pre-programming and all the brainwashing and all the rest of it,
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  we've been told the lights are about to go out and there's about to be cyber attacks.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  And right-wing groups are going to do it.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  And Putin's going to do it.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  But it fits into the great reset.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  The Globalist Program, Klaus Schwab, says they're going to get their great reset now with a cyber attack that will save the Earth.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  But he's not going to launch it.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  They just launched a COVID attack, but they're not going to launch this attack.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  They just put the troops in Ukraine triggering this attack.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  They're triggering all of it to bring down civilization.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  They are a crazy eugenics transhumanist death cult, masquerading as an environmentalist death cult,
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  when in truth they think they're God and are overriding everything and think that they're supposed to bring in some great cataclysm that springboards them into Godhood.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  Sounds pretty damn satanic.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  It's just like you need oxygen.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  You die in four minutes without oxygen.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  You die in five or six days without water.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  You die in a month without food.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's offenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  Everybody, old, young, black, white, you need vitamin D3.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  This is the best quality out there and it funds the info war 50% off.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  So I did it.
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarstore.com.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  You know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  And the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis.
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  I have bad joints.
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  Thanks mom.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  And Sorilis can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  So X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.

[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  Info wars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  This info wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the info wars store.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  The hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  Next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  Well, there's a cartoon that's up on infowars.com that really says it all.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  They say a picture tells a thousand words and this one certainly does.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  It's the image of the ocean and a great white shark is blasting up out of it and on its belly it's called Russia
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  and it's just eaten the person and destroyed the inner tube they were floating in,
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  but that's the country of Ukraine.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  That's what's written on the smashed, punctured inner tube eaten by the great white shark, Russia.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  Well, there's Taiwan watching floating around the water in their own little rubber inner tube
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  and right beneath the water is China getting ready to make their move.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  I know that can be a little annoying for TV viewers, you can see it, but remember we're on over 300 radio stations
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  and so we are first and foremost a radio show on TV, so I have to narrate this,
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  even though I don't do the best job sometimes, believe me, I know that.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  So continuing, and we're going to go right to your calls, I'm going to hit this after we take a bunch of calls,
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  very telling, amid Ukraine-Russia conflict, China's accidentally exposing its own plans for a Taiwan invasion.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  And I want to be clear, my sources said Russia and China by late February and I obsessed on China
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  because I think of them as more powerful and more dangerous and they've infiltrated our government.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  I kind of left Russia over on the sidelines and saw that as a side issue because I really found it hard to believe
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  they were really going to do this, but it's happened, it's on, full scale war.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  There is now footage of ships being sunk and on fire in the Black Sea because they're not stopping when they're hailed by the Russian Navy.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  So Russia is carrying out the cutoff of all material and energy into Ukraine until they surrender.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  And so the people inside those major cities should say we're going to kill the Russians, we're going to fight back,
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  we're never going to surrender. Remember the majority of the population is at least part Russian or fully Russian.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  The Russians are just going to turn off the supplies, including the power, until they capitulate.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  And so what's the lesson here? There's several huge lessons here, but I saw a video on CNN that was actually quite helpful
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  that I'll also get to later in the hour, where the former president is in Kiev, the capital there.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  And he's saying, well, there's thousands of us are ready to fight right here in this group,
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  but we only have a few hundred Kalashnikovs and a couple machine guns and a few missiles.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  But we're going to fight. Well, why don't you have all that stuff? Because you don't have a Second Amendment.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  And because your military had been looted by the oligarchs working for the West and not actually spending the money to have a defense
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  because you are a vassal state. And so that's what's going on here. We don't want to be like that.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  We want to have our own food, our own water and our guns and know how to use them, not because we're looking for trouble.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  But why did Admiral Yamamoto, the supreme commander of the Japanese military say when he got ordered by the emperor to attack Pearl Harbor?
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  He took the order, didn't question, but went back and told his high command, they put it down, wrote it down on rice paper,
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  that he said, I fear we have awakened a sleeping giant.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  He said, from our intelligence, there is a rifle behind every blade of grass because they finally had a plan to invade.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  He knew that wasn't going to work, but they had a plan, talk about politicians giving orders to the military, the military can't fulfill.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  Now, the full quote is, I fear all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  He went on to say, you cannot invade the mainland America, there will be a rifle behind every blade of grass.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  Because it was another Admiral said it, I conflated the two.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, and that's the debris between a free society and societies that aren't free.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  And when governments, whether it's an outside power like Russia or whether it's the corrupt Australian or New Zealand governments,
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  when the public is disarmed, they are castrated.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  Going back to medieval times, whether you were in Japan or ancient France or ancient England or ancient Ukraine,
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  only noblemen could have a sword or a knife past a certain length.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  Commoners weren't allowed to have longswords.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  Commoners weren't allowed to have armor.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  Commoners weren't allowed to have chain mail.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  Commoners weren't allowed to have axes that had certain size blades that were for battle.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  Dogs, if you own dogs in medieval Europe, they would cut off several of the digits of the foot
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  so that your dog couldn't chase the nobles, rabbits and deer.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  You had to feed the dog with whatever meager amount of food you had.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  Now, noble dogs, they didn't have part of their feet cut off.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  I'm going to go to your calls right now. I appreciate you holding Elaine in Maine.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  What is your take and view on all of this?
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  Thank you.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  My take on it is, actually, I agree so much with you.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  Everything just bought on.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  I don't think I could have said any of it better than you.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  I believe you're right on everything.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  I think the Ukraine invasion was a theater.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  I think it was planned.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  I mean, Putin basically walked through Ukraine and took it.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  There was no opposition to speak of.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  The UN didn't have overhead planes bombing them.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  The US didn't go after them.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  I mean, the UN sent more planes over to the peaceful convoy,
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  freedom convoy in Canada,
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  along with the UN soldiers.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  They sent more over there than they did with Ukraine.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  Well, that's right. Let's talk about what's happened in Ukraine.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  Clearly, the military leadership was bought off before the invasion.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  And so ragtag pilots, ragtag tank groups, ragtag militias are fighting
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  and dying valiantly in the face of the Russians
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  and actually holding them off in some areas.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  And the border guards, they didn't get the memo to surrender,
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  so they got killed on Snake Island.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  And it can only make you admire these hard-fighting good people
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  who are upset about being invaded by their historic genetic brethren.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  But still, you don't want your cousin coming and taking your house over,
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  even though they're your cousin. It doesn't matter if they're blood.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  So, I mean, Russia's got its issues, but the leadership stood down.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  And that's why Zelensky's hanging out with the fraud of frauds,
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  the Hollywood people, and all the rest of it,
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  because behind the scenes for my sources, Zelensky's actually a double agent working for Putin.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  Oh, I wouldn't doubt it. I think the fact that Zelensky was giving an interview
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  with Sean Penn during the invasion, I think that tells a lot.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  Well, it sure does. And the name I was looking for is Sean Penn.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  I know Sean Penn, and when he plays the character of the Stoned Idiot
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, that's who he is.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  He probably has a 70 IQ.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  Thank you for the call, Elaine. We really appreciate you.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  More calls. Here's a few minutes away. I'm going to write your calls. Bang, bang, bang straight ahead.

[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  Good, bro.
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting,
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  moralization, and absurdity. It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the phone of the product.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the infowar.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air. Thanks for holding it. Go ahead.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  Honored talk to you.
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  Awesome.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:45.000]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products, alpha power, even at 29.
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  She asked my better half. She loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  Well, it definitely works. It's not a joke.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:33:16.000]  Absolutely.
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  Another time. In the age of wonder. Another world. Another time.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  Slap the screen and look into the crystal.
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  We will reconstruct Atlantis. We have reconstructed Atlantis.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  And now the war for the future is here.
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  The power of our source.
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  And when you write your calls after this very short little compilation of Klaus Schwab explaining the next phase of their takeover
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  is the cyber attack so that his disciples know he's in command with the globalist
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  so that they're read into how to respond when the cyber attack comes
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  that's then blamed on foreign enemies to trigger wider war
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  and accelerated collapse of civilization where they completely take over
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  and then carry out the forced depopulation. Here it is.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  The young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau, half of this government, are actually young nobilities of the world.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  It's that we penetrate the cabinets.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  The change is not just happening. The change can be shaped by us.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  We have to prepare for a more angry world, how to prepare to take the necessary action to create the fair world.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  I see the need for a great reset.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  So people assume we are just going back to the good old world which we had and everything will be normal again.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  This is, let's say, fiction. It will not happen.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  There is only one way this pandemic is going to go.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  Pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  Our society as a whole.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  to a major cyber attack.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  They're getting you ready, ladies and gentlemen. They're getting us all ready.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  And if we don't put enough heat on them legally and lawfully, they're going to pull the next phase.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  And I know you want to go watch a movie. You want to go play pool. You want to go eat some enchiladas or a steak.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  You want to go for a hike. You want to swim around in the local pool. You're like me.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  You're just a normal person once you have a life.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  You're not Klaus Schwab. He wants to kill you.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  He sees you as scum. He sees you living on his land.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  They stole the world through fraud and they want us dead.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  And if we let them kill us, we deserve it in his view.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  And I think I kind of agree with him. It's survival of the fittest.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  I don't think he's the fittest. I don't think our species should act like this.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  I think he's the disease, not us. What do you think?
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  You want us to die, buddy boy?
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  Well, in the words of Emperor Palpatine, no, no, no, no, you will die.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  But I don't mean that in an evil way like Palpatine. I mean, politically, we're going to defeat and kill your ideas.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  But not harm a little hair on that head.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  Wouldn't want that to happen. You sack of murdering filth.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  All right, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  I really appreciate everybody holding so patiently here, putting up with me.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  I'm going to move quick here so we get to everybody. Okay.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  Let's go to Ivan in Illinois. You're on the air, sir.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  Hey, Alex, how's it going? It's an honor to speak to you again.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  Honored to talk to you.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  All right. So I just have a, you know, two part question and commentary.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  You know, you've been so spot on with your predictions and everything.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  I mean, I remember back in like October and November, you were talking about this attack that was coming in Ukraine.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  And lo and behold, it happened, you know.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  So my thing is the United States, you know, didn't get involved into World War One until 1917,
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  and they didn't get involved into World War Two until 1941.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  Do you think that this has the potential to escalate into a third world war?
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  What's your guess?
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  I mean, I don't think it has the potential. I think it has a 50-50 chance of doing just that.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  I mean, I'm literally not a scaredy cat person when I look at my children, especially my four-year-old daughter.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  I just shake with concern that we've got to stop these people.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  Yes, we're on a path.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  The best prediction of future behavior is past behavior.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  What have we done in the past?
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  You've acted like a bunch of idiots, and it's happening again.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  Right, right, right.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  So I mean, that's what my concern is.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  I mean, all the indicators are kind of there, and it looks like it's pointing to there.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  I mean, you even got Putin, you know, threatening, you know, to launch nuclear strikes against the U.S.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  And then you got Biden on the other side saying that, you know, if any of the NATO allies are threatened, then they're going to respond, you know.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  So that's what we're just trying to figure out.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  That's right, and Putin's doctrine is the West way out numbers him.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  So he's going to use nuclear weapons immediately, tactical nuclear weapons at U.S. military bases in Europe, and the U.S. will start nuking Russia.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  And then literally in 45 minutes, most of us are dead.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  Exactly.
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  Or you're going to be wishing you're dead.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  I mean, people like the shows, like Walking Dead, where they're zombies.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  After 10 days, the general public behaves like zombies.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  When there's no power, no water, no food, God help you.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  You better be in the woods, away from everybody, with like 30 people you know with heavy weapons.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  And by heavy weapons, I mean, you know, heavy for civilian weapons.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  I mean, because you're going to have literally like the road with Viggo Mortensen, hordes of people running around in a month, like Road Warrior, raping, robbing and killing and eating people.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  That's what all the Pentagon projections show.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  Within 30 days, Road Warrior cannibalism.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  Exactly.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  So, and then the last thing I just wanted to mention, man, you know, this past, this past November and in October, my in-laws and I, we got, we got COVID, you know, the virus.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  And, you know, unfortunately, my father-in-law, his name is Augustine, he passed away from it.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  And none of us are vaccinated because of course we know what's all, what's in it and what it does to us.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  And the virus got him instead.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  And the symptoms I got, they're not like anything I've felt from any other sickness I've ever had.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  So, let me ask you, knowing they did this to you, it's all completely confirmed, major prestigious scientific papers.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  What we already knew two years ago, that Moderna made the damn thing with Fauci and Gates.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  They made COVID-19, they had it in 2016.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  I mean, wow.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  And of course, nothing's going to be done to them.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  Exactly.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  And it's like, no, there's no accountability and all, and it's like, we're just supposed to sit back and take this and not do a damn thing about it.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  And that angers me.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  Well, we need to expose Fauci and all of them because it's a cult of killers.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  And so somebody did something to Fauci, turn him into a victim or Gates.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  We don't, we want to destroy their name, let everybody know they're murdering killers and expose their whole project and bring it down.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  And then after that, they go to prison or, you know, they get sentenced to death by a jury.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  That's just gravy.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  We want to stop the project, stop the next release.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  That's our goal.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  I understand we get focused on wanting to see him hanging, but that can't come until after all the evidence is brought out.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  You understand that, right?
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  Exactly.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  Because someone needs to be held accountable for his death because he did not need to die at 70 years old.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  You know, he was.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  Yeah, no, he lived another 20 years of happiness and they murdered him.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  They murdered your family.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  I understand they murdered my family, too.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  And I'm pissed.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  So thank you.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  I bless you.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  Appreciate it, sir.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  God bless you.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  All right, let's try to jam another one in.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Well, I don't want to give the caller a minute and a half.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  So we're going to come back and go to Jake and Bonecrusher and everybody that's been holding the longest.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  We'll go right back to you just briefly.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  This is a long, hard fight.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  It can end in a nuclear war next month or a bio weapon release next year.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  I don't know, but I'm going to keep fighting to the end.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  That means I got to sell products because we fund ourselves.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  90% of our funding is funded by you.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  We have some other great sponsors, but they only cover 10% of what we're doing here.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  infowarstore.com.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  We haven't taken the sale down yet, but it will end there tomorrow.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  We've extended it.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  We don't need to because we don't get more for a long time.
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  I need to sell out the rest of X3 at full price or only discount of 25%.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  But X3 is amazing.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  It is still 50% off.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  Winter sun is 50% off.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  That's going to keep going for a couple more weeks while supplies last.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  Rainforest ultra has been sold out for a long time.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  It's 40% off.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  Good clean, hard hitting, new tropic.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  It's 40% off.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  Ultimate crow oil is back in stock.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  Ultimate fish oil is back in stock.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  Living defense is back in stock.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  And Turbo Force is about to sell out, but I got to get the money of selling out of it to reorder it.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  So we're selling Turbo Force with a flash sale.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  Incredible 10 hour clean energy right now for a massive discount.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  It was a 50% off.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  That's got to end this weekend.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  It's a flash sale.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  So infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  Books, films, shortwave radios,
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  water filters, air filters, a lot of survival gear.
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  Coming public and whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  Like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency in Marshall Law in Ontario
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  So pray for these folks big time.
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  It's a very serious situation.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  Stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  Live feeds, both the regular shows and special reports and share them with everyone you know.

[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  But there is only two things to do.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  both at home and the world at large.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of,
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  It's our new faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with Down and Out,
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passion Flower,
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees,
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep,
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  because you will be Down and Out.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  Selling out now at infoorstore.com.
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  It's so easy to blow up your problems
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  It's so easy to play up your breakdown
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  It's so easy to blow up your problems
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  and the order they were received
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  Let's go to Jack in Chicago, the Bone Crusher.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  Jack, welcome.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  So to kind of parlay on what Leo Kagami has said last year,
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  there's a really great article on Unlimited Hangout.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  It's called, From Event 201 to Cyber Polygon,
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  the WF Stimulation of the Coming Cyber Pandemic.
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  And essentially, the World Economic Forum
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  was developed with Russia for the last three years
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  to do their cyber attack.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  By the way, let me just back you up.
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  I've actually got the article right here.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  I was going to get to that.
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  Please keep going.
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  I want listeners to know you're not making this up.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  So, but my theory is that the MSN is Blockstep
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  Defending Ukraine, I think it's all theater.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  And I agree with what Leo Kagami said.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  He was talking about Cyber Satan and all of that.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  Everybody gives me credit for knowing tomorrow's news today.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  Leo Kagami is way underrated.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  That dude is the real deal.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  I'll leave it at that.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  But he was actually in the real Illuminati,
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  the real Italian one.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  I mean, when I was with Rome with him,
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  he took me into the Vatican.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  He took me into the castles.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  He took me into the secret societies.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  And I got tired by 3 a.m. with my wife and Rob Dill.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  He said, hey, we don't want to go into these buildings anymore.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  But he was like, had the keys to everything.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  Keep going. Sorry.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  So, I mean, this article is really,
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  I mean, it gets into the details of it.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  It talks about, you know, Russia's cybernac and by zone
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  and the global cyber attack simulation.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  You know, the fact that the World Economic Forum
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  has done this operation with Russia for the last three years,
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  my opinion is I think perhaps Putin might have kind of
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  deal with them.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  And what we're seeing.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  I totally agree with you.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  I think behind the scenes like Stalin did a deal with Hitler
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  during World War II until they broke the agreement
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  with splitting up Poland, that's what the smart money is on
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  is that Putin's made some secret deal with certain arms
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  of the globalist.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  I totally agree with you.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  By the way, let's catch the gami on.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  I'm writing a book tomorrow on the Great Reset
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  and I was not going to do a show tomorrow.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  But you know what?
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  We'll do a one-hour emergency special with Leo Zagami
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  that we'll tape it noon if we can then maybe air it at 3.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  We'll do one hour with Zagami, guys.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  Because the crew's already coming in.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  We're all going to be up here tomorrow working,
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  but we're going to work on the book.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  But if we can do it, see if we can get Zagami for tomorrow
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  at noon to tape.
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  If we can't do it, fine.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  But I want him on Sunday then.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  You know what?
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  I got to write the book.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  I got to work on the book.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  That's a secret project I just announced.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  We'll have Zagami on Sunday night because I'm doing a special.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  I'm doing like six hours Sunday nights.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  We'll do it then.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  I'm sorry to interrupt you, Jack.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  Please continue.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  You're just bringing up so much gold here.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  Really spurring my mind.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  So, yes.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  So think about it.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  Like you were saying, you know, and another great article is
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  from our friend Lou Rockwell, and he talks about how the title
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  of it is called the West desperate effort to switch the enemy
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  from COVID from COVID to Putin.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  And the funny thing about that is this is this is the perfect
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  dialectic that the US needs another boogeyman to make us
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  forget about COVID.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  And, you know, how I rebut all of this is just, you know, my
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  neighbor was talking about, oh, Russia this and Russia that.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  And I said, well, do you support support the 2014 coup with
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  Soros, Victoria, Newland and Obama, where they put Nazis in
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  charge in Ukraine?
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  And so people don't think of it in terms like that because
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  they've already forgot the history of eight years ago.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  There's one other really good article I want to put out there.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  I don't know if you've seen this before.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  It's from the Idaho observer.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  It's called deathbed confessions.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  Confessions photo support claims that George H.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  Scherf, Jr. is actually Bush 41.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  And in this article, there are pictures of George Bush 41 with
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  Gorman, which was Hitler's second in command, but also with
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  Joseph Mingo.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  Well, I know he was high level CIA and his father was the
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  head banker for the Nazis in the US and was part of the
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  rat line, actually ran it.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  And I know people that knew the Bushes in Houston, I'm going
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  to leave it at that, who would go to a Nazi church with them.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  A secret Nazi church was baby blue with a white swastika.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  And so, yes, the Bushes are Nazis.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  There's no doubt about that.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  And I was told if I talk about it, they're going to kill me.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  But since you're bringing it up, I might as well just go ahead
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  and get that out.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  So I don't know if he's secretly somebody else, but I know this.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  He was the youngest CIA director ever.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  He was the first US ambassador to China under the communist.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  George W. Bush's father was the super grand daddy pimp.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  You know, when it came to this, he ran the operation to kill
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  Kennedy and Dallas, everything.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  I appreciate your call.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  You just cannot make this stuff up.
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  And so, yes, there is a inordinate amount of grandchildren
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  and children of Nazis running things.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  But again, it's not a Nazi conspiracy.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  The Nazis were a offshoot, a covert group used to attack,
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  like the Club of Rome, like the Bilderberg group,
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  like the Nabos group.
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  It's all the same people.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  It's like Hydraheads.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  And so, you cut the Nazi head off, you know, five more sprout.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  And it's just, it's pure evil, folks.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  Absolute pure evil.
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  George Soros worked for it from the time he was 14.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  He's an agent of it.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  So is Henry Kissinger.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  To survive the Nazis, they joined with them.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  And they'll tell you that.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  I did it to survive.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  At what?
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  And then you continued on doing it?
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  It'd be bad enough if he sold out to survive,
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  but then you turn against it and say, you were sorry.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  No, he says, I'm not, I'm proud of what I did.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  And he'll sue anybody, including funding lawsuits against us
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  for exposing him.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  I mean, what am I supposed to do?
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  Kiss your ass?
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  Become you?
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  Survive by getting on my knees?
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  No, I don't think so, brother.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  I'm going to fight you hard to the end.
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bone Crusher in FEMA Region 10.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  That's out there on the West Coast.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  Go ahead, sir.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  Alex, how's it going?
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  I mean, it just gets crazier and crazier every day I'm on air.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  I'm just blessed to still be above ground, brother.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  Well, let me just give a quick shout out to you and the crew for being on air.
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  And you guys are putting out almost like 60 hours of content every week.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  And it's just, it's amazing.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  And that kind of brings me into talking about this.
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  I hear you earlier talking about, you know, people wanting to get the info out.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  And I can feel that and people need to start doing stuff where they're going
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  and taking that link of you predicting the war and stuff like that that's going on
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  and sending stuff like that out to people and then people are calling in
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  and they're talking about, oh, well, info wars needs to do this.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  You guys can do this to get the work.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  No, people need to start stepping up and start going and getting the word out themselves.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  Making banners, like I see you guys got that promo going between the commercials
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  where people are talking about making banners and that's awesome.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  But the thing about that is don't put stuff like arrest gates, arrest Fauci,
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  because liberals are just going to look at that and they're going to dismiss it.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  Put stuff like quotes from the WES, like you'll own nothing and be happy,
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  like stuff like that or put, stop the WES.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  So they got to go look up what the WES is and then they're going to look into it
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  themselves and realize that this is a globalist takeover.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  No, I agree.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  I've seen some great manner things about listeners lately.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  I guess it was my idea to say arrest gates or arrest Fauci.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  You're right.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  And the listeners followed my lead.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  It's probably better just to say find the secret truth, infowars.com
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  or, you know, something like, you know, you are ruled by the World Economic Forum
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  and then a website.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  I mean, because people need to know and you're right.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  Liberals, when they're exposed to this, actually wake up and they realize there's
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  a private corporate group that's running things.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  It's just, it's crazy.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  It's insane.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  I can't believe that we're at this point right now.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  And that kind of brings me to the whole Russia-Ukraine thing.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  What do you think?
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  Because obviously you predicted this.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  You saw what was going to happen.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  You weren't sure.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  You didn't say Russia.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  Well, no, I mean, I know people that know a lot of people and I mean,
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  hell, I'll just be honest, Joe didn't say it was off record.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  Joe Rogan at dinner in early October said, man, a lot of my big sources say,
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  oh, hell's going to break loose in January and February in major war.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  What do you think?
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  And I said, yeah.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  And I said, what are your sources?
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  And he was like, well, you know, and then I made some calls to some big people
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  I know in industry.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  They said, yeah, we're told that things are going to be really crashing in late February.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  And then I called some military people I know and they said, damn right.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  Don't you know that the tundra unfreezes in late February?
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  So the Russians are going to launch.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  They got a launch by the end of February.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  And then the Chinese were saying we're getting ready to invade.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't hard to see this.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  You know what I mean?
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  Well, so do you think that Russia is going to actually occupy Ukraine or you think they're
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  just trying to destabilize it to keep NATO in the UN out?
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  Because they've been warning NATO in the UN forever.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  Well, it's both.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  They are now completing the occupation.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  And then they'll put in a puppet government or government that agrees and then they'll
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  have a security force that is around that puppet to make sure they follow that.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  And then they'll phase out that puppet once NATO has been backed off and then continue
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  on from there.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  But that's basically the Russian model.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  And so both.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  I mean, I mean, if they don't get a full capitulation, they're going to put those cities under siege
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  and every day that continues, Putin's going to look worse and it's going to start losing.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  So Putin took one hell of a big bald gamble here.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  I'm surprised that this is what happened.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  I didn't think that this.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  Yeah.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  I mean, is he hauling those things around in a wheelbarrow?
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  I mean, it's it's ballsy, brother.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  But like Tony Montana says, only one thing in this world that gives orders.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  Great points.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  Bonecrusher.
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  All right, we're going to come back.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  We have a special guest pop in about 20, 30 minutes, but I'm going right back to your
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  calls.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  Got a lot of cool name board like Owl killer and Carlos and everybody else.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  But we're taking calls the order they received our number three straight ahead.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  Stay with us.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:50.600]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[1:57:50.600 --> 1:57:55.800]  And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D three eight years ago, I've been
[1:57:55.800 --> 1:58:00.600]  promoting people taking vitamin D three because it is essential.
[1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:05.600]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic,
[1:58:05.600 --> 1:58:06.600]  it doesn't matter.
[1:58:06.600 --> 1:58:11.360]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats are out there.
[1:58:11.360 --> 1:58:12.920]  It's just like you need oxygen.
[1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:14.640]  You died four minutes without oxygen.
[1:58:14.640 --> 1:58:17.140]  You die in five or six days without water.
[1:58:17.140 --> 1:58:18.600]  You died a month without food.
[1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:23.800]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that
[1:58:23.800 --> 1:58:24.800]  you need.
[1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:28.600]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D
[1:58:28.600 --> 1:58:29.600]  three.
[1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:35.120]  The highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's offenses available
[1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:40.400]  right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:40.400 --> 1:58:42.400]  Everybody old, young, black, white.
[1:58:42.400 --> 1:58:43.400]  You need vitamin D three.
[1:58:43.400 --> 1:58:47.880]  This is the best quality out there and it funds the info war 50% off.
[1:58:47.880 --> 1:58:49.680]  So I did it.
[1:58:49.680 --> 1:58:51.840]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:56.480]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[1:58:56.480 --> 1:58:58.480]  and thank goodness for infowarstore.com.
[1:58:58.480 --> 1:59:04.600]  Before I start out on a run, I throw down some TurboForce to give me that energy I need
[1:59:04.600 --> 1:59:05.600]  to get going.
[1:59:05.600 --> 1:59:10.440]  You know, besides the energy TurboForce, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin
[1:59:10.440 --> 1:59:16.080]  C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[1:59:16.080 --> 1:59:18.880]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[1:59:18.880 --> 1:59:22.520]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones Sorilis.
[1:59:22.520 --> 1:59:24.120]  I have bad joints.
[1:59:24.120 --> 1:59:25.120]  Thanks mom.
[1:59:25.120 --> 1:59:29.480]  And this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation
[1:59:29.480 --> 1:59:31.880]  support and extra flexibility.
[1:59:31.880 --> 1:59:36.440]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[1:59:36.440 --> 1:59:41.160]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news TurboForce that can
[1:59:41.160 --> 1:59:45.240]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and Sorilis can keep you
[1:59:45.240 --> 1:59:47.240]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[1:59:47.240 --> 1:59:55.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:59:55.840 --> 2:00:08.000]  All right, this is megamassivenaturalnews.com story, just broken, it's at infoawards.com.
[2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:10.240]  I suggest you share it.
[2:00:10.240 --> 2:00:11.240]  Woo!
[2:00:11.240 --> 2:00:14.840]  And this is another piece of the puzzle.
[2:00:14.840 --> 2:00:15.840]  We know what's going on.
[2:00:15.840 --> 2:00:18.960]  We know Omicron was made in a lab by White Hats.
[2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:20.680]  The scan's complete.
[2:00:20.680 --> 2:00:27.640]  It's got more than 50 changes, but 20 plus in one area, 30 plus in another to kill the
[2:00:27.640 --> 2:00:35.760]  spike protein and make it weak and then give you immunity to the spike protein itself.
[2:00:35.760 --> 2:00:41.800]  Very sophisticated genetic engineering, way beyond Moderna and Gates creating it in 2016,
[2:00:41.800 --> 2:00:44.560]  which has now come out.
[2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:48.680]  And so that's what's pissing, it still gets you sick, but nothing like the other variants.
[2:00:48.680 --> 2:00:52.000]  And so Gates has announced his next battle plan, which we told you about a long time
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:53.560]  ago.
[2:00:53.560 --> 2:00:54.840]  What do you think COVID-19 is?
[2:00:54.840 --> 2:00:58.640]  They didn't just give it to people through humans or through the shots, it's sprayed
[2:00:58.640 --> 2:00:59.640]  in the air.
[2:00:59.640 --> 2:01:02.880]  He approached the Pentagon about that in 2017, that's all come out.
[2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:03.880]  They said no.
[2:01:03.880 --> 2:01:08.200]  Bill Gates developing needleless vaccine that spreads like a virus in the unvaccinated.
[2:01:08.200 --> 2:01:10.200]  It is a virus.
[2:01:10.200 --> 2:01:13.480]  We're going to lay all that out coming up.
[2:01:13.480 --> 2:01:19.400]  But right now, let's go to your calls here, who has been holding the longest?
[2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:23.880]  That would be Mark in the great state of Texas, sir, go ahead.
[2:01:23.880 --> 2:01:24.880]  Oh, great.
[2:01:24.880 --> 2:01:31.400]  It's a, it's a big honor, Alex, I'm a Seatown 1776 point holder.
[2:01:31.400 --> 2:01:40.520]  And what I really wanted to talk about was I'm running a part 15 broadcaster and it's
[2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:45.040]  a great way of getting all of your podcasts out to all my neighbors.
[2:01:45.040 --> 2:01:48.880]  And I hope that, uh, that other folks will pick up on that and for folks who don't know
[2:01:48.880 --> 2:01:49.880]  about that.
[2:01:49.880 --> 2:01:52.480]  So it's your low power TV station.
[2:01:52.480 --> 2:01:53.480]  It's a radio.
[2:01:53.480 --> 2:01:54.480]  It's radio.
[2:01:54.480 --> 2:01:56.800]  And, uh, and it's, uh, it's more power.
[2:01:56.800 --> 2:02:01.960]  You can give, you can run more power legally than you might think.
[2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:03.680]  I love it, brother.
[2:02:03.680 --> 2:02:04.680]  That's fantastic.
[2:02:04.680 --> 2:02:08.040]  What's, what's on your mind about the military docs, Russia and Ukraine?
[2:02:08.040 --> 2:02:09.040]  Yeah.
[2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:13.800]  Well, I was looking at some, well, some of the news that I was seeing last night about
[2:02:13.800 --> 2:02:19.880]  Ukraine keeping, uh, all the men between 18 and 60 in the border, not letting them leave
[2:02:19.880 --> 2:02:26.560]  got me to thinking, and I pulled up the military manuals about a friend of so ratios and, uh,
[2:02:26.560 --> 2:02:31.480]  to delay an invading force, it's one to six and defend it's one to three.
[2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:37.480]  So if you keep all of the men between 18 and 60 engaged in militarily, uh, with a one to
[2:02:37.480 --> 2:02:44.600]  three to a one to six ratio, Ukraine actually has a stronger force than Russia.
[2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:49.600]  Well, Putin has not really exaggerated his military.
[2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:53.160]  And again, cause I'm not in love with Vladimir Putin on his cover facts.
[2:02:53.160 --> 2:02:56.320]  He's admitted that their military is not that strong other than nuclear.
[2:02:56.320 --> 2:03:00.720]  They've got really hypersonic missiles that the U S by the way does have, but they've
[2:03:00.720 --> 2:03:03.240]  really produced some amazing aerospace products.
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:11.280]  Uh, and, uh, I just look at Russia as one big delicious juicy, uh, place full of resources
[2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:14.480]  and full of smart people and just where we should be developing.
[2:03:14.480 --> 2:03:19.520]  I would love them to be a big open free society and, you know, fly over there and own farms
[2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:20.520]  over there.
[2:03:20.520 --> 2:03:24.360]  And I mean, if the place is untapped, I mean, it's, it's the biggest country in the world.
[2:03:24.360 --> 2:03:26.040]  It's full of everything.
[2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:31.480]  And the globalists are always fighting over it instead of just having free market.
[2:03:31.480 --> 2:03:35.920]  So let them have their Nord Stream too and let us have our, uh, pipelines and let's just
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:39.520]  stop all this war and get down to business.
[2:03:39.520 --> 2:03:40.520]  Absolutely.
[2:03:40.520 --> 2:03:45.160]  And I think that's another reason that the COVID has been unleashed is to, uh, is to soften
[2:03:45.160 --> 2:03:50.600]  us up before the civil war or Russia, China invasion, or if they don't get it softened
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:55.960]  up enough, then maybe they'll have to resort to nukes, but, uh, I think it's all orchestrated.
[2:03:55.960 --> 2:03:59.520]  It's all, it's all going according to absolutely, I agree.
[2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:00.520]  I agree.
[2:04:00.520 --> 2:04:01.840]  And it's not going to come at us with blue helmets.
[2:04:01.840 --> 2:04:06.480]  They're going to come to the medical core, the lockdowns, the liberals, black lives matter.
[2:04:06.480 --> 2:04:08.480]  That is the UN globalist shock force.
[2:04:08.480 --> 2:04:10.120]  And sir, thank you for getting three of the coins.
[2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:11.880]  Again, people are like, well, why is it an investment?
[2:04:11.880 --> 2:04:13.000]  It's way marked up.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:17.200]  You're buying a piece of keeping us on air, a piece of history, a limited edition event,
[2:04:17.200 --> 2:04:20.400]  and those coins are already going for four times what people bought them.
[2:04:20.400 --> 2:04:26.040]  So thank you so much, Mark, for your support in all you do, brother.
[2:04:26.040 --> 2:04:27.040]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:04:27.040 --> 2:04:28.040]  Thank you for all you did.
[2:04:28.040 --> 2:04:29.040]  Thank you.
[2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:33.800]  Somebody putting up a low powered TV station or radio station that doesn't interfere with
[2:04:33.800 --> 2:04:38.200]  other stations and telling your neighbors, hey, I got some forbidden info up, goes out
[2:04:38.200 --> 2:04:42.800]  a mile or whatever, put up a few signs, people tune in, and if you reach a hundred people
[2:04:42.800 --> 2:04:45.720]  that start tuning in, you've changed the world.
[2:04:45.720 --> 2:04:47.600]  And so what he's doing is so amazing.
[2:04:47.600 --> 2:04:50.080]  Little things together do huge things.
[2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:51.080]  Many hands make light work.
[2:04:51.080 --> 2:05:17.560]  We'll be right back with more of your calls in 60 seconds.

[2:05:21.580 --> 2:05:24.080]  needs this old, young, black, white.
[2:05:24.080 --> 2:05:25.080]  It doesn't matter.

[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  amazing, clean, new tropic system that is a compliment to brain force plus, and of course,

[2:05:39.160 --> 2:05:43.440]  All three of these are different formulas, but all three of them take your mind and take
[2:05:43.440 --> 2:05:46.560]  your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.

[2:06:01.240 --> 2:06:03.840]  Waging war on corruption.

[2:06:10.040 --> 2:06:15.040]  We're all going to have color coding.
[2:06:15.040 --> 2:06:18.640]  The people that have got green are going to be so proud of it.
[2:06:18.640 --> 2:06:21.640]  I don't have that credit.
[2:06:21.640 --> 2:06:23.640]  I've got green rating.
[2:06:23.640 --> 2:06:29.280]  They just walk right through with the hotels and at the airports and train stations.
[2:06:29.280 --> 2:06:33.960]  My RFID, they scan the chip and the Y's as I just passed that.
[2:06:33.960 --> 2:06:35.120]  I've got easy pass.
[2:06:35.120 --> 2:06:36.680]  I've got everything.
[2:06:36.680 --> 2:06:38.360]  I've got everything.
[2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:41.040]  I'm first class and you're not.
[2:06:41.040 --> 2:06:47.360]  Honey, I just got a letter, I just got an email, I'm yellow rating, you didn't pay
[2:06:47.360 --> 2:06:48.840]  that ball on time.
[2:06:48.840 --> 2:06:49.840]  It's all right, honey.
[2:06:49.840 --> 2:06:52.200]  We'll go in and talk to the men.
[2:06:52.200 --> 2:06:53.520]  They're in ski mask machine guns.
[2:06:53.520 --> 2:06:55.160]  You want to go in to see a director?
[2:06:55.160 --> 2:06:57.640]  Please, I'm with the neighborhood command.
[2:06:57.640 --> 2:06:58.640]  I deserve it.
[2:06:58.640 --> 2:06:59.640]  All right, go on in.
[2:06:59.640 --> 2:07:02.320]  Well, we can get that back to green rating.
[2:07:02.320 --> 2:07:04.280]  I want 20,000 creds.
[2:07:04.280 --> 2:07:09.600]  Oh, you've got green rating again.
[2:07:09.600 --> 2:07:12.960]  All right, we're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:17.360]  Long after I'm dead, it could be a year, it could be 10 years, it could be 20 years.
[2:07:17.360 --> 2:07:21.160]  You're going to be living this and I want you to remember it.
[2:07:21.160 --> 2:07:25.040]  Do you hear me, scum?
[2:07:25.040 --> 2:07:30.280]  I'm talking to the Yuppies right now.
[2:07:30.280 --> 2:07:31.680]  Do you hear me?
[2:07:31.680 --> 2:07:33.320]  I defended this republic.
[2:07:33.320 --> 2:07:35.440]  I did everything I could.
[2:07:35.440 --> 2:07:40.560]  I fought as hard as I could.
[2:07:40.560 --> 2:07:45.960]  Well, that's from 2005, vintage Alex Jones.
[2:07:45.960 --> 2:07:51.400]  You got Bitcoin mining going on, you've got Alex Jones' old clip mining.
[2:07:51.400 --> 2:07:54.160]  These clips are getting millions of views, so the people that grab them, it's all free
[2:07:54.160 --> 2:07:55.160]  to air.
[2:07:55.160 --> 2:07:57.800]  A lot of them are running and they're making advertising, tens of thousands of dollars
[2:07:57.800 --> 2:08:02.880]  mining Alex Jones' clips.
[2:08:02.880 --> 2:08:04.880]  But I'm not dead yet.
[2:08:04.880 --> 2:08:05.880]  I'm still here.
[2:08:05.880 --> 2:08:09.880]  Wow, what a world, what a time, what insanity.
[2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:14.040]  Imagine what 20 years, 22 years from now will be like if we're still alive, we haven't
[2:08:14.040 --> 2:08:15.880]  vaporized the planet.
[2:08:15.880 --> 2:08:19.400]  Carlos in Canada, thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:20.400]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:21.400]  We're still here.
[2:08:21.400 --> 2:08:30.520]  Just a quick, I don't think President Putin had a choice to do what he did.
[2:08:30.520 --> 2:08:37.480]  President Zelensky a few weeks back threatened to reactivate the nuclear capabilities that
[2:08:37.480 --> 2:08:42.480]  were left in Ukraine from the Soviet Union days.
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:48.960]  I thought the nooks, I saw the threat to rearm, but weren't the nooks all moved out?
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:51.360]  Well, we don't know.
[2:08:51.360 --> 2:08:54.640]  What we do know is that that still sealed the deal.
[2:08:54.640 --> 2:08:58.560]  And also, at the same time, there's another dimension which is not mentioned here too
[2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:07.280]  much, and that is that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline was something that had been prevented.
[2:09:07.280 --> 2:09:11.440]  Many American Israelis have been opposed to it from day one.
[2:09:11.440 --> 2:09:13.440]  Yeah, because they wanted their pipeline.
[2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:14.440]  Exactly.
[2:09:14.440 --> 2:09:21.040]  The moment that you sealed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, then you have to rely on the central
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:26.720]  pipeline that goes from the east to the west of Ukraine to Germany.
[2:09:26.720 --> 2:09:27.720]  That meant...
[2:09:27.720 --> 2:09:30.160]  But why has Biden killed the Israeli pipeline too?
[2:09:30.160 --> 2:09:31.560]  It's just insane.
[2:09:31.560 --> 2:09:35.640]  And then when he did that, at that point, and they put, actually, they put bombs in
[2:09:35.640 --> 2:09:43.360]  the eastern side of near the Lugansk area of the central pipeline, at that point, Putin
[2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:47.440]  realized that obviously, he had no choice, he had to protect the pipeline to Germany.
[2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:52.000]  This is not a bad thing for Germany, by the way, because if they would have cut that line
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:54.040]  as well, going through Ukraine...
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:09:55.040]  No, you're right.
[2:09:55.040 --> 2:09:58.240]  They didn't blow up some of the lines, and people said it was a false flag.
[2:09:58.240 --> 2:10:02.320]  All I know is the globalists are cutting our pipelines off, the Israeli pipeline, the
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:03.320]  Russian pipeline.
[2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:05.320]  I say the more pipelines, the merrier.
[2:10:05.320 --> 2:10:09.880]  If the Chai comms want pipelines, even though I don't like communists, people need more
[2:10:09.880 --> 2:10:10.880]  energy.
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:11.880]  Don't you agree?
[2:10:11.880 --> 2:10:18.040]  It's an act of war against poor people to artificially restrict energy being lowered.
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:19.040]  Don't you agree with that?
[2:10:19.040 --> 2:10:20.040]  I agree.
[2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:22.600]  What we have here is you and I talked about this in the past.
[2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:29.960]  If this is the octopus playing Russia against the United States, and the moment that Victoria
[2:10:29.960 --> 2:10:34.120]  Newland came back to the White House, I began to take notes.
[2:10:34.120 --> 2:10:37.760]  And for those that don't know, she's the one that helped run the coup eight years ago with
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:41.040]  Soros on record, and the one that was caught, the Russians released the Intercepts, where
[2:10:41.040 --> 2:10:46.000]  she says, after the Europeans and after Russia and after Ukrainians, they're literally in
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:47.880]  there just robbing the place.
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:10:48.880]  Exactly.
[2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:52.960]  I think in the next time we talk longer, because I'd like to clear the lines, but I want to
[2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:55.280]  tell you, Alex, you're doing a great job.
[2:10:55.280 --> 2:10:57.720]  Please, everybody, supporting for wars.
[2:10:57.720 --> 2:10:59.440]  Do whatever you have to do.
[2:10:59.440 --> 2:11:02.520]  I don't have any more money to buy iodine.
[2:11:02.520 --> 2:11:05.360]  This is a fantastic product, as it says.
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:06.360]  I hear you, brother.
[2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:08.080]  We're under massive Democrat party attack.
[2:11:08.080 --> 2:11:10.400]  Remington went bankrupt and rolled over to them.
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:14.040]  We haven't even fighting them for years, and they've just spent hundreds of millions trying
[2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:15.040]  to destroy us.
[2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:17.320]  They got CNN specials out to try to annihilate us.
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:21.840]  They got CIA spy ops grips, but we're still because of you on air.
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:25.840]  So we need your prayer, your word of mouth, and your financial support at infowarstore.com.
[2:11:25.840 --> 2:11:29.360]  And I'm just going to keep marching and attacking until no matter what happens, until we run
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:30.600]  out of gas or whatever happens.
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:34.040]  And I just know as long as I go 110%, God's not going to be mad at me.
[2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:37.320]  I'm just going to keep going, keep going until they arrest me, kill me, put me in prison,
[2:11:37.320 --> 2:11:38.320]  or we win.
[2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:39.320]  I'm just going to keep going and going.
[2:11:39.320 --> 2:11:40.560]  Thanks for the call.
[2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:41.920]  All right.
[2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:48.000]  What's up next here is, that would be Armand in California.
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  Welcome Armand.
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  Hello.
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  Can you hear me?
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  Yes, I do.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  Go ahead.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  Glad to be on.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:56.200]  I just want to talk a little bit.
[2:11:56.200 --> 2:12:01.880]  I have concerns about the pace of the Russian assault on Ukraine.
[2:12:01.880 --> 2:12:07.080]  It's always hard to understand what Putin's motives are in any theater of conflict, but
[2:12:07.080 --> 2:12:13.480]  the Russian military has the capacity to essentially destroy the degraded Ukrainian army, which
[2:12:13.480 --> 2:12:14.960]  has been at war for eight years.
[2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:20.400]  They have the capacity to essentially destroy all the hardware in the first 48 hours of
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:21.400]  conflict.
[2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:22.560]  Yeah, but he's about to seize all that hardware.
[2:12:22.560 --> 2:12:23.680]  He's about to run the country.
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:27.360]  So he wants them to get, he wants to do them as much pressure as needed to get them to
[2:12:27.360 --> 2:12:28.360]  give up.
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:30.480]  It's like spanking one of your children.
[2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:31.560]  You don't break their arm.
[2:12:31.560 --> 2:12:33.960]  You just do enough for them to stop going out in the street.
[2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:34.960]  Does that make sense?
[2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:35.960]  Yeah.
[2:12:35.960 --> 2:12:40.600]  And I'm just concerned of a really, really bloody ground because he seems like he's digging
[2:12:40.600 --> 2:12:42.360]  his heels in for the long haul.
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:46.480]  You know, I mean, he could have occupied Kiev by now if he really wanted to with an
[2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:47.480]  air assault.
[2:12:47.480 --> 2:12:50.520]  The fact that they haven't, it's deliberate and thoughtful.
[2:12:50.520 --> 2:12:51.960]  Well, tell me your theory.
[2:12:51.960 --> 2:12:57.040]  I was just throwing out that they're mainly only targeting military targets.
[2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:00.680]  They're trying to get them to just give up and stop becoming a vassal state.
[2:13:00.680 --> 2:13:04.120]  Look, Russia is very jealous of Ukraine.
[2:13:04.120 --> 2:13:06.240]  Ukraine has always been the big, sexy Hollywood.
[2:13:06.240 --> 2:13:07.680]  It's where Russia came from.
[2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:11.960]  It's always been richer and more powerful per capita than Russia, whereas Russia's been
[2:13:11.960 --> 2:13:18.360]  bigger and stronger and won the wars and saved Ukraine 900 years ago.
[2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:24.120]  So or yeah, 900, no, no, no, 700 years ago.
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:27.240]  So they've been through this over and over and over again.
[2:13:27.240 --> 2:13:31.480]  And so they see their big juicy being their milk cow.
[2:13:31.480 --> 2:13:35.000]  I mean, it's true that that's where they get like half their food stuff being taken away
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  and they're jealous.
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:39.200]  It's like watching your wife go off with somebody else and leave.
[2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:44.720]  And so what do they plus not just like the wife left them, then the wife moves, moves
[2:13:44.720 --> 2:13:48.160]  you know, the boyfriend onto Russia's porch with a shotgun.
[2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:50.160]  Does that make sense?
[2:13:50.160 --> 2:13:51.160]  Yeah.
[2:13:51.160 --> 2:13:52.160]  Yeah.
[2:13:52.160 --> 2:13:53.160]  Right now, I don't know.
[2:13:53.160 --> 2:13:56.880]  It seems like Putin's just trying to sort of destabilize Ukraine, you know, as opposed
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:13:59.280]  to just a wide, full occupation.
[2:13:59.280 --> 2:14:03.240]  Right now he's just trying to empty out the cities and scare everyone out, essentially.
[2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:04.240]  That's what it seems like.
[2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:05.240]  He's throwing in a lot of conscripts.
[2:14:05.240 --> 2:14:07.880]  So I've been in the military for only a couple of months.
[2:14:07.880 --> 2:14:13.360]  He's throwing in a cannon fodder from DPR and Luhansk, who are wearing brand new crisp
[2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:14.360]  uniforms.
[2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:15.360]  No, I mean, you're right.
[2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:17.280]  I mean, I mean, look at this Reuters article that's out right now.
[2:14:17.280 --> 2:14:18.280]  All right.
[2:14:18.280 --> 2:14:19.280]  Is that Bloomberg?
[2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:22.680]  Putin calls on Ukrainian military to cease power to better negotiate with Russia because
[2:14:22.680 --> 2:14:26.920]  he knows it's a bunch of globalist factions in there and a bunch of former presidents jockeying
[2:14:26.920 --> 2:14:27.920]  for control.
[2:14:27.920 --> 2:14:31.160]  I'll negotiate with the military, which is a very smart move.
[2:14:31.160 --> 2:14:33.280]  I would expect this to be over in 48 hours.
[2:14:33.280 --> 2:14:36.040]  What do you think?
[2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:41.400]  Right now it's very strange because the civilians are being mobilized in Ukraine.
[2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:46.720]  There's so many variables that that's because they don't know the military already has turned
[2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:48.480]  tail and run.
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:51.720]  There are no real military units fighting the Russians.
[2:14:51.720 --> 2:14:54.240]  Those are just people that think it's their job to defend their country.
[2:14:54.240 --> 2:14:56.280]  They don't know the deals already been made.
[2:14:56.280 --> 2:14:58.040]  Yeah, I could believe that.
[2:14:58.040 --> 2:15:00.600]  I could believe that there is Western operator.
[2:15:00.600 --> 2:15:02.960]  Most wars are one before they start, brother.
[2:15:02.960 --> 2:15:03.960]  I appreciate your call.
[2:15:03.960 --> 2:15:13.280]  Look, listen, I'll go back to World War II and with Poland and with France.
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:15.880]  In both cases, deals were already made.
[2:15:15.880 --> 2:15:17.600]  And so a fraction of the polls fought back.
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:18.800]  They didn't know they'd been sold out.
[2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:20.800]  I mean, the polls aren't wimps.
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:22.200]  They would have hold out a lot of years.
[2:15:22.200 --> 2:15:23.200]  Okay.
[2:15:23.200 --> 2:15:24.200]  They actually had real leaders.
[2:15:24.200 --> 2:15:28.320]  The French only held out a few weeks because most of their high command had already sold
[2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:30.440]  out who were then put in as dictators.
[2:15:30.440 --> 2:15:34.320]  So Putin is taking a page from Hitler and saying, Hey, you want to be Vici French?
[2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:36.200]  You want to be in charge military?
[2:15:36.200 --> 2:15:40.600]  Hey, it's better than having NATO military run.
[2:15:40.600 --> 2:15:44.400]  And he says, okay, Ukrainian military want to be in charge?
[2:15:44.400 --> 2:15:45.880]  And that's basically what's going down here.
[2:15:45.880 --> 2:15:47.800]  And this means I'm endorsing any of this.
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:49.480]  This is the real world folks.
[2:15:49.480 --> 2:15:55.200]  We've got a very special guest joining us with a huge amount of information and more
[2:15:55.200 --> 2:15:56.200]  straight ahead.
[2:15:56.200 --> 2:15:58.200]  You don't want to miss this guest.
[2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:03.200]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying,
[2:16:03.200 --> 2:16:07.160]  empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[2:16:07.160 --> 2:16:11.560]  And when it comes to information, boy, is that true today.
[2:16:11.560 --> 2:16:18.680]  We see the entire global corrupt, anti-human depopulation, great reset combine, trying to
[2:16:18.680 --> 2:16:25.200]  collapse our society to build on tashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[2:16:25.200 --> 2:16:31.760]  the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[2:16:31.760 --> 2:16:37.800]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030,
[2:16:37.800 --> 2:16:40.480]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:42.040]  And none of it can succeed.
[2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:47.240]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[2:16:47.240 --> 2:16:51.440]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[2:16:51.440 --> 2:16:55.160]  And that's why it's hard to share in Fall Wars links and Band-up video links.
[2:16:55.160 --> 2:16:57.640]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[2:16:57.640 --> 2:17:02.360]  Get our great bag of it here.
[2:17:02.360 --> 2:17:06.600]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[2:17:06.600 --> 2:17:11.800]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[2:17:11.800 --> 2:17:14.360]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[2:17:14.360 --> 2:17:17.800]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:19.120]  but really they're just a commune.
[2:17:19.120 --> 2:17:22.160]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[2:17:22.160 --> 2:17:24.360]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[2:17:24.360 --> 2:17:27.560]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[2:17:27.560 --> 2:17:28.760]  and the price has never gone up.
[2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:33.120]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[2:17:33.120 --> 2:17:35.600]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[2:17:35.600 --> 2:17:39.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:42.760]  In fact, I'm going to tell you a little story.
[2:17:42.760 --> 2:17:51.760]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:58.240]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to steer, that's fine.
[2:17:58.240 --> 2:18:01.080]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:05.560]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[2:18:05.560 --> 2:18:11.360]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:15.080]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[2:18:15.080 --> 2:18:20.040]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:24.240]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[2:18:24.240 --> 2:18:28.440]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[2:18:28.440 --> 2:18:31.120]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[2:18:57.720 --> 2:19:03.320]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here all over the world from Australia to
[2:19:03.320 --> 2:19:05.720]  the United States from Canada to Germany.
[2:19:05.720 --> 2:19:09.200]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your
[2:19:09.200 --> 2:19:14.880]  house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[2:19:14.880 --> 2:19:15.880]  facilities.
[2:19:15.880 --> 2:19:20.680]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take
[2:19:20.680 --> 2:19:24.640]  quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:26.440]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:30.680]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many
[2:19:30.680 --> 2:19:34.960]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military

[2:19:59.600 --> 2:20:16.320]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:16.320 --> 2:20:18.120]  What have I been saying for days?
[2:20:18.120 --> 2:20:21.880]  It's not hard to say it, 101.
[2:20:21.880 --> 2:20:27.780]  In real wars you invade and then you buy off military leadership to give up either before
[2:20:27.780 --> 2:20:30.200]  you invade or once you invade.
[2:20:30.200 --> 2:20:31.200]  And that's what Putin's doing.
[2:20:31.200 --> 2:20:35.560]  I've been saying behind the scenes, most of the military's already stood down.
[2:20:35.560 --> 2:20:39.920]  They don't want to be known as traitors, they make deals behind the scenes.
[2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:47.320]  So Putin gives them the offer that Hitler did when he invaded France back in 1940.
[2:20:47.320 --> 2:20:52.040]  He said give up and I'll put the military in charge.
[2:20:52.040 --> 2:20:55.240]  Now I know why Putin did this and I'm not against the Russians, but I don't like these
[2:20:55.240 --> 2:20:56.240]  wars.
[2:20:56.240 --> 2:20:59.920]  I know NATO was bringing in troops and weapons and they had no choice, but I still don't
[2:20:59.920 --> 2:21:01.760]  like any of this.
[2:21:01.760 --> 2:21:03.160]  This is dangerous as hell.
[2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:06.400]  And now they're getting ready to blame cyber attacks on Russia and escalate things out
[2:21:06.400 --> 2:21:07.400]  of control.
[2:21:07.400 --> 2:21:11.400]  They got all the talking heads saying they do one cyber attack, they invoke Article 5
[2:21:11.400 --> 2:21:12.840]  and we go to war with Russia.
[2:21:12.840 --> 2:21:19.280]  And if you think the globalist won't do it and their bunkers depopulate us, you're stupid.
[2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:24.120]  Putin calls on Ukrainian military to cease power to better negotiate Reuters, AP, Bloomberg.
[2:21:24.120 --> 2:21:28.840]  It's all being reported, reportedly gave a press conference, we're getting the video.
[2:21:28.840 --> 2:21:31.320]  So that's what you do and that's what I think is going on.
[2:21:31.320 --> 2:21:35.480]  This is a real invasion, but they got most of the military to stand down, but you better
[2:21:35.480 --> 2:21:37.560]  do when you invade somebody.
[2:21:37.560 --> 2:21:41.600]  Royce White joins us for two segments, I really appreciate him coming on.
[2:21:41.600 --> 2:21:46.200]  He just announced a few days ago that he's running for Congress and he's a super smart
[2:21:46.200 --> 2:21:47.200]  guy.
[2:21:47.200 --> 2:21:51.360]  I'm not supporting him in his run against Ilhan Omar because he's a famous NBA player
[2:21:51.360 --> 2:21:58.880]  and MA guy or all that, but because he stood up for everybody and against tyranny and against
[2:21:58.880 --> 2:22:03.360]  the Democratic Party and against the corrupt Republicans and against the Chinese Communists
[2:22:03.360 --> 2:22:05.720]  and the Uyghur persecution.
[2:22:05.720 --> 2:22:12.000]  And his website is RoyceWhite.us to find his congressional run or RoyceWhite.substack.com.
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  He's written a great new article and open letter to Democrats, we'll get to that next
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  segment.
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:19.440]  But Royce, obviously people want to know they should vote for you for Congress.
[2:22:19.440 --> 2:22:25.840]  Maybe better than Ilhan Omar, but my goodness, an amazingly smart Christian patriot, great
[2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:26.840]  looking.
[2:22:26.840 --> 2:22:30.000]  I mean, you got everything we need, brother, and to unify the people.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:32.200]  I couldn't think of a better type of candidate.
[2:22:32.200 --> 2:22:37.160]  You could be the new model instead of these people like Ilhan Omar and this idiot woman
[2:22:37.160 --> 2:22:38.160]  AOC.
[2:22:38.160 --> 2:22:43.520]  I don't care if women get elected, that's great, but my God, these Communist idiot people
[2:22:43.520 --> 2:22:44.520]  is really a problem.
[2:22:44.520 --> 2:22:49.240]  But with all going on, I'm sure you want to respond to Russia and to all the news coming
[2:22:49.240 --> 2:22:50.240]  out.
[2:22:50.240 --> 2:22:52.560]  Well, thanks for having me back, Alex.
[2:22:52.560 --> 2:22:53.960]  You know, it's an honor, man.
[2:22:53.960 --> 2:22:54.960]  I'm a big fan.
[2:22:54.960 --> 2:22:59.960]  I've been watching the show for some time, and I'm thankful to be able to share my story
[2:22:59.960 --> 2:23:04.440]  and who I am with your audience.
[2:23:04.440 --> 2:23:05.600]  We're in a crisis, right?
[2:23:05.600 --> 2:23:06.760]  This country is in trouble.
[2:23:06.760 --> 2:23:11.600]  I think the free people of the world are in trouble, but this country is in trouble.
[2:23:11.600 --> 2:23:16.760]  And there's a lot of crisis across the board, but I really believe the front line of crisis
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:26.440]  is citizenship, and ultimately, we are in a battle where there are a lot of people in
[2:23:26.440 --> 2:23:32.880]  this country that just believe America is dead, and there are a lot of people in power
[2:23:32.880 --> 2:23:38.560]  who believe that we're in this sort of managed decline.
[2:23:38.560 --> 2:23:42.080]  And I'm not willing to give up the American dream.
[2:23:42.080 --> 2:23:43.640]  I'm not willing to give up on America.
[2:23:43.640 --> 2:23:45.960]  I'm not willing to give up my stake in America.
[2:23:45.960 --> 2:23:51.000]  I think that people like Ilhan Omar, AOC, think that they're getting some type of a
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:56.200]  quid pro quo deal where, when the authoritarians take over, when tyranny really comes down
[2:23:56.200 --> 2:24:01.640]  to bear that it'll miss them, and I see past that, and I'm trying to urge this sort of
[2:24:01.640 --> 2:24:06.320]  free people of America, this populist movement, to press down on the gas and fighting back
[2:24:06.320 --> 2:24:11.120]  against tyranny, against authoritarianism, against this technocracy, against new world
[2:24:11.120 --> 2:24:12.120]  order, globalism.
[2:24:12.120 --> 2:24:13.120]  I love that.
[2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:15.480]  Recognize we're under attack by globalists and press on the gas.
[2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:16.960]  How do we do that?
[2:24:16.960 --> 2:24:22.880]  Well, I think it's too tiered, right?
[2:24:22.880 --> 2:24:27.200]  The grandiosity of the federal government is undermining the meaning of community, and
[2:24:27.200 --> 2:24:31.440]  the arrogance of globalism is undermining the value of country, right?
[2:24:31.440 --> 2:24:37.520]  And so we have to understand that our citizenship, American citizenship, is the front line of
[2:24:37.520 --> 2:24:42.520]  defense against tyranny around the world, and we have to take up that mantle, and we
[2:24:42.520 --> 2:24:43.960]  have to hold that responsibility.
[2:24:43.960 --> 2:24:47.560]  We have to hold the line here in America for our citizenship and the value that it holds
[2:24:47.560 --> 2:24:53.480]  and the rights that it holds in order to slow down the momentum of tyranny from here, all
[2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:55.800]  the way to the South Pacific.
[2:24:55.800 --> 2:24:59.560]  Man, I just want to get you in Congress.
[2:24:59.560 --> 2:25:00.560]  Wow.
[2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:02.480]  You'd make, I mean, you're absolutely right.
[2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:03.480]  You're dead on.
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:07.520]  You got a great way of just authoritatively laying it out so simply, whereas I tend to
[2:25:07.520 --> 2:25:09.280]  extrapolate forever.
[2:25:09.280 --> 2:25:10.280]  Keep going here.
[2:25:10.280 --> 2:25:11.280]  Yeah.
[2:25:11.280 --> 2:25:17.640]  Well, I mean, look, again, I said the crisis, and let's take a step back.
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:20.240]  The crisis is really spiritual, right?
[2:25:20.240 --> 2:25:24.560]  But we do have to delineate between the spiritual and the political.
[2:25:24.560 --> 2:25:27.840]  And when I first came onto the public scene, I was a mental health advocate.
[2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:32.360]  I battled the MBA and the sort of global corporatocracy about mental health policy.
[2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:36.560]  That was 10 years ago when only people like you and a few select others were talking about
[2:25:36.560 --> 2:25:42.520]  globalism, a global corporate community and the economics-only conservatism and this sort
[2:25:42.520 --> 2:25:47.400]  of business-first money by any means model and method.
[2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:52.800]  But when I was doing that, I sort of saw the psychological and mental health as divorced
[2:25:52.800 --> 2:25:53.960]  from the political.
[2:25:53.960 --> 2:25:57.000]  I thought that the political was beneath me, right?
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:02.840]  I thought that mental health and the psychological was so much deeper that I could ignore the
[2:26:02.840 --> 2:26:04.480]  politics.
[2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:10.000]  But in reality, I was mistaken, I was greatly mistaken, because when the political is potent,
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  it has a profound impact on the psychological.
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:14.520]  And I think that's what we're seeing in this country.
[2:26:14.520 --> 2:26:19.880]  And I think that's how globalists have been able to sort of mobilize this liberal American
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:20.880]  movement.
[2:26:20.880 --> 2:26:21.880]  That's right.
[2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:22.880]  They take our pride.
[2:26:22.880 --> 2:26:27.160]  They tell us pride in America is bad and dirty, but who are we, we're not Americans.
[2:26:27.160 --> 2:26:31.120]  They get us to not take on our birthright to then be alone and hate ourselves so they
[2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:36.160]  can give us the new download, which isn't some new pride or better system, but is that
[2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:39.920]  we're all at each other's throats and we're all scum and everything's over, and then
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:44.000]  we believe that and die.
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:46.920]  And the biggest lies hide behind the greatest truth, right?
[2:26:46.920 --> 2:26:52.000]  And I think America's original sin was slavery, and I'm a black man, obviously.
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:53.200]  But I believe in America.
[2:26:53.200 --> 2:26:57.960]  And I think actually a lot of Republicans, and we talked about this before, a lot of
[2:26:57.960 --> 2:27:03.000]  Republicans and people on the right, conservatives, miss when they say racism is no longer an
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  issue in this country.
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  No, it's an issue.
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:06.640]  It's a profound issue.
[2:27:06.640 --> 2:27:11.440]  The issue is that neoliberal racism is more profound than any racism we've ever experienced
[2:27:11.440 --> 2:27:12.440]  in this country.
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:18.360]  And it's able to mask itself behind the caricature that they put on the right and on the Republicans.
[2:27:18.360 --> 2:27:22.840]  And the prime example of that, as a black man sitting here with you today in front of
[2:27:22.840 --> 2:27:27.920]  your audience, there is no greater sign of racism in this country than for a bunch of
[2:27:27.920 --> 2:27:36.880]  affluent, metropolitan, neoliberal whites to want to make this unilateral decision that
[2:27:36.880 --> 2:27:40.120]  America is dead, American citizenship isn't worth it.
[2:27:40.120 --> 2:27:44.040]  And although black people may have not been fairly compensated in the first iteration
[2:27:44.040 --> 2:27:47.800]  of the American dream, we should give ours up for their new global dream.
[2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:49.960]  I mean, that's racist.
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:58.400]  That's paternalistic, low expectation, low worth bigotry in its most pure form.
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:27:59.400]  Exactly.
[2:27:59.400 --> 2:28:02.320]  Instead of taking on the birthright that you fought for this year is right at the moment
[2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:03.760]  we were actually getting it.
[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:07.200]  Now you hate it and say it's not yours like you're, you throw it off a cliff and then
[2:28:07.200 --> 2:28:13.080]  join Klaus Schwab, the most greedy murderous scumbag we've ever seen.
[2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:21.240]  And Ilhan Omar and AOC and many other puppets who fit the criteria to build this sort of
[2:28:21.240 --> 2:28:26.920]  front or use black people as this front for intersectionality, which is the church of
[2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:30.760]  LGBTQ and the brotherhood of globalism.
[2:28:30.760 --> 2:28:35.640]  These are the people who they strategically place and use their identity as a calling
[2:28:35.640 --> 2:28:44.240]  card to the sheep and the people who are, let's say, headline reading tacitly, a Democrat,
[2:28:44.240 --> 2:28:45.240]  Democratic participants.
[2:28:45.240 --> 2:28:50.280]  We got a real leader joining us Roy Swight, find him at Roy Swight.us, he's running for
[2:28:50.280 --> 2:28:51.280]  Congress.
[2:28:51.280 --> 2:28:53.920]  If you don't back in for Congress, you're part of the problem.
[2:28:53.920 --> 2:28:54.920]  We'll be right back.

[2:29:45.320 --> 2:29:50.280]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time.

[2:30:41.280 --> 2:30:47.320]  be millionaires and movie stars, but we won't and we're just learning this fact.
[2:30:47.320 --> 2:30:51.440]  So don't fuck with us.
[2:30:51.440 --> 2:30:57.920]  Support independent media at infowarstore.com.
[2:30:57.920 --> 2:31:05.360]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[2:31:05.360 --> 2:31:08.560]  until the populations rebelled.
[2:31:08.560 --> 2:31:14.080]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[2:31:14.080 --> 2:31:19.640]  anybody that speaks out against their lives, but because of so many scientists and engineers
[2:31:19.640 --> 2:31:25.320]  and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers, now their whole project is
[2:31:25.320 --> 2:31:32.320]  falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover
[2:31:32.320 --> 2:31:35.760]  and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[2:31:35.760 --> 2:31:40.160]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[2:31:40.160 --> 2:31:46.520]  Like Canada where they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario and other
[2:31:46.520 --> 2:31:50.720]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia, so pray for these folks big time.
[2:31:50.720 --> 2:31:56.120]  This is a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely
[2:31:56.120 --> 2:31:57.120]  paramount.
[2:31:57.120 --> 2:31:59.240]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:31:59.240 --> 2:32:01.160]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[2:32:01.160 --> 2:32:02.160]  Welcome.
[2:32:02.160 --> 2:32:03.160]  Hello Alex.
[2:32:03.160 --> 2:32:04.160]  Yes Malcolm.
[2:32:04.160 --> 2:32:05.160]  All right.
[2:32:05.160 --> 2:32:07.160]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[2:32:07.160 --> 2:32:12.160]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer, SuperMail
[2:32:12.160 --> 2:32:14.920]  Vitality and Brainforce Plus.
[2:32:14.920 --> 2:32:15.920]  Mix those two together.
[2:32:15.920 --> 2:32:17.560]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[2:32:17.560 --> 2:32:19.520]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[2:32:19.520 --> 2:32:25.680]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has
[2:32:25.680 --> 2:32:30.840]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well but just aren't as
[2:32:30.840 --> 2:32:31.840]  strong.
[2:32:31.840 --> 2:32:32.840]  This is like a very fine wine.
[2:32:32.840 --> 2:32:35.400]  In fact, each batch is different.
[2:32:35.400 --> 2:32:37.400]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[2:32:37.400 --> 2:32:40.520]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[2:32:40.520 --> 2:32:41.520]  strong?
[2:32:41.520 --> 2:32:42.520]  That's just how it is.
[2:32:42.520 --> 2:32:43.520]  It's how it works.
[2:32:43.520 --> 2:32:45.040]  So it's always good.
[2:32:45.040 --> 2:32:49.200]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong but yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a
[2:32:49.200 --> 2:32:58.880]  decent price then this is it.
[2:32:58.880 --> 2:33:15.040]  Adding a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:15.040 --> 2:33:32.920]  You keep saying you've got something for me, something you call love but confess, you've
[2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:40.320]  been a messin' where you shouldn't have been a messin' and now someone else is gettin'
[2:33:40.320 --> 2:33:49.200]  on your best, these boots are made for walkin' and that's just what they'll do.
[2:33:49.200 --> 2:33:54.240]  One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you.
[2:33:54.240 --> 2:33:59.960]  Napoleon started a war with Russia and got defeated, so did Hitler and now Russia is
[2:33:59.960 --> 2:34:01.960]  fighting again.
[2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:06.200]  Probably not gonna go too well.
[2:34:06.200 --> 2:34:16.320]  Joining us is somebody that's already been a really successful fight for human rights
[2:34:16.320 --> 2:34:20.440]  and was a trailblazer in the NBA, not pushing a bunch of division and George Sorrell's crap
[2:34:20.440 --> 2:34:24.840]  but mental health and stand up for the Uyghurs and you name it, now he's an MMA fighter.
[2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:28.760]  I really like Royce White, I've known who he was for years but once I got him on, really
[2:34:28.760 --> 2:34:29.760]  impressed.
[2:34:29.760 --> 2:34:30.760]  I know leadership when I see it.
[2:34:30.760 --> 2:34:35.560]  I know not a diamond in the rough but diamond right there, that's what we need and you
[2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:36.560]  know, women are great.
[2:34:36.560 --> 2:34:39.760]  I hope we get a bunch of women in Congress but at the end of the day we need men to be
[2:34:39.760 --> 2:34:40.760]  men again.
[2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:48.240]  If you imagine Congress full of men like Royce White at RoyceWhite.us, you imagine black,
[2:34:48.240 --> 2:34:51.640]  white, Hispanic, old, young, I don't give a damn but men again.
[2:34:51.640 --> 2:34:56.920]  We need men to stand up and realize it's their responsibility to be leaders.
[2:34:56.920 --> 2:35:02.280]  It's a genetic fact, the whole enemy attack is about denying the office of men and women
[2:35:02.280 --> 2:35:05.440]  have their office and women can do anything they want.
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:07.360]  But women want men to lead.
[2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:12.680]  They don't on average want a bunch of power to be running stuff and any system that sells
[2:35:12.680 --> 2:35:16.920]  women being in charge, it doesn't really want women in charge, it wants people they can
[2:35:16.920 --> 2:35:18.600]  push around in charge.
[2:35:18.600 --> 2:35:21.280]  So in the time we've got left in this segment Royce, and I'm going to get you back for a
[2:35:21.280 --> 2:35:24.480]  full podcast, cover any topics you want for an hour or two hours.
[2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:27.680]  I'm going to start doing more and more of the Joe Rogan style long, you know, long form
[2:35:27.680 --> 2:35:32.640]  interviews I did 20 years ago and stopped a few years ago but Royce White, what else
[2:35:32.640 --> 2:35:37.520]  do you want to impart in the eight minutes we have left for the Lester's?
[2:35:37.520 --> 2:35:42.960]  Yeah, I think that I want to stress again, like I did in one of our previous episodes
[2:35:42.960 --> 2:35:45.120]  about this righteous and divine war.
[2:35:45.120 --> 2:35:51.520]  The central reason why I'm very drawn to getting involved in jumping into the political
[2:35:51.520 --> 2:35:54.840]  arena is one we're in a crisis of citizenship.
[2:35:54.840 --> 2:36:00.680]  But it's just very concerning to me as an average everyday American who come from a blue
[2:36:00.680 --> 2:36:07.240]  color family and a Christian and a Catholic that our mainstream political establishment
[2:36:07.240 --> 2:36:16.400]  has basically tried to create, promote and sustain a culture, a social culture that suggests
[2:36:16.400 --> 2:36:26.880]  Jesus Christ and Christianity are anti-Semitic, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic and racist.
[2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:32.240]  I mean, and some people whether or not you believe in God or Christianity may not understand
[2:36:32.240 --> 2:36:38.440]  that the attack on Christianity and the Bible is a bigger global agenda, number one.
[2:36:38.440 --> 2:36:42.360]  But it's an attack right at the heart of the United States Constitution because if you
[2:36:42.360 --> 2:36:45.840]  get rid of the Bible, then the Constitution is out.
[2:36:45.840 --> 2:36:49.440]  So you know, these are the real dynamics and culture wars that are going on.
[2:36:49.440 --> 2:36:54.840]  And I said that there's a crisis of citizenship and a spiritual crisis, but there's also
[2:36:54.840 --> 2:37:02.280]  a culture war that's full, full go and the attack on Christianity is the best symbol
[2:37:02.280 --> 2:37:03.280]  of it.
[2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:09.000]  And the crisis of femininity I think has been pulled out of this sort of attack and demonization
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:12.400]  of Christianity.
[2:37:12.400 --> 2:37:15.040]  Keep laying it on us then.
[2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:23.880]  I mean, I think the central liberal ethos you could say is an unholy alliance where
[2:37:23.880 --> 2:37:33.200]  you got your technocratic, scientism overlords and beta males who see the best way to sort
[2:37:33.200 --> 2:37:42.800]  of insulate themselves with an unexpected populace was to go after this intersectionality
[2:37:42.800 --> 2:37:45.160]  propaganda.
[2:37:45.160 --> 2:37:50.280]  And the best people to use or partner with was the liberal white woman.
[2:37:50.280 --> 2:37:58.800]  And then by way of attached to the LGBTQ movement and then ultimately used black people as the
[2:37:58.800 --> 2:38:04.200]  calling card because of a history of a true and genuine history of oppression.
[2:38:04.200 --> 2:38:05.200]  Absolutely.
[2:38:05.200 --> 2:38:09.440]  They steal the crimes that have been done to black folks and their families and literally
[2:38:09.440 --> 2:38:13.280]  put blackface on their corporate world government neoliberal takeover.
[2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:17.440]  Is that fair to say the left puts on blackface for all their corporations and systems to
[2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:21.040]  like hide who they really are?
[2:38:21.040 --> 2:38:22.040]  Absolutely.
[2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:27.480]  And the worst part about it is it's very, very obvious.
[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:32.280]  And the way you can tell what makes it so obvious is any black person for all of their
[2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:38.880]  pandering and propaganda and promotion of an idea like Black Lives Matter, let's say,
[2:38:38.880 --> 2:38:45.920]  any black person who deviates from the political agenda, who thinks for themselves, who loves
[2:38:45.920 --> 2:38:51.040]  this country, who wants to be a Christian, an unapologetic Christian is automatically
[2:38:51.040 --> 2:38:53.320]  ostracized and attacked.
[2:38:53.320 --> 2:38:54.320]  And they are the party.
[2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:59.080]  They are the cultural movement that says we can't attack shame or bully, but they do
[2:38:59.080 --> 2:39:00.080]  it.
[2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:07.040]  And so, you know, what we have to understand is that the problem in America, it really
[2:39:07.040 --> 2:39:09.360]  is not between the two parties.
[2:39:09.360 --> 2:39:14.360]  The problem is the ever expanding middle and the liberals have been able to hijack the
[2:39:14.360 --> 2:39:19.840]  ever expanding middle through the media industrial complex and by grabbing a hold of the Legacy
[2:39:19.840 --> 2:39:20.840]  Institute.
[2:39:20.840 --> 2:39:21.840]  Well, that's right.
[2:39:21.840 --> 2:39:23.600]  Well, we're all losing our incomes in our future.
[2:39:23.600 --> 2:39:25.360]  They've got us fighting with each other.
[2:39:25.360 --> 2:39:34.240]  Well, they've been able to create a, they've been able to create a makeshift generic template
[2:39:34.240 --> 2:39:38.280]  for your average American voter who just doesn't know any better, right?
[2:39:38.280 --> 2:39:39.280]  No, no.
[2:39:39.280 --> 2:39:40.280]  Hey, you don't want to be racist?
[2:39:40.280 --> 2:39:42.120]  Well, vote for Democrats then.
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:47.200]  Let me raise this, because you're a big tough guy, MMA, NBA player, you know, you're an
[2:39:47.200 --> 2:39:48.360]  alpha male.
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:52.960]  I'm an alpha male as well, and then I believe I've got a job to do, and I'm confident the
[2:39:52.960 --> 2:39:53.960]  rest of it.
[2:39:53.960 --> 2:39:56.720]  Growing up and being around a bunch of other big alpha males that were tougher than me
[2:39:56.720 --> 2:40:02.680]  made me feel big and strong, but I noticed beta liberals, they get threatened by it and
[2:40:02.680 --> 2:40:03.680]  want to extinct it.
[2:40:03.680 --> 2:40:07.760]  So what's the difference between males that feel strong around other strong males and
[2:40:07.760 --> 2:40:11.320]  it makes you feel stronger, makes you want to be stronger, versus the left that's so
[2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:15.040]  threatened by a male vigor that we need to get to the next level?
[2:40:15.040 --> 2:40:19.440]  Or real femininity, they're at war with women, saying a big fat drag queen is a woman.
[2:40:19.440 --> 2:40:20.440]  No, that's not a woman.
[2:40:20.440 --> 2:40:21.440]  That's not a goddess.
[2:40:21.440 --> 2:40:26.080]  And this is a, these women are like God's little G, you know, like they say in the,
[2:40:26.080 --> 2:40:29.600]  in the, in the, in the vegan emergency movie, the road, it's like this child, this ugly
[2:40:29.600 --> 2:40:31.040]  world is a God.
[2:40:31.040 --> 2:40:35.480]  It's got the potential to all this power, and it's like men have incredible power, women
[2:40:35.480 --> 2:40:39.320]  have incredible power, by recognizing that we become more powerful together, and then
[2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:41.960]  they're pissed at powerful women and powerful men.
[2:40:41.960 --> 2:40:46.440]  Why do I feel good around powerful men and make me feel more powerful, but the left then
[2:40:46.440 --> 2:40:48.680]  always hates, hates it.
[2:40:48.680 --> 2:40:54.560]  Why can't they embrace the power and become more powerful themselves?
[2:40:54.560 --> 2:40:57.760]  It's just an, it's an anti competitive ethos, right?
[2:40:57.760 --> 2:41:03.640]  That there's a, there's a genuine, deep, profound, anti competitive spirit and it's part and
[2:41:03.640 --> 2:41:05.840]  parcel of, of a heresy.
[2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:10.720]  And the best example I can, this, this whole dynamic is the traditional Loki versus Thor
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:17.200]  motif, where, you know, and the feminists have aligned themselves with Loki.
[2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:21.720]  And in one of my open letters, I, I, I stress to women, you have to understand the reason
[2:41:21.720 --> 2:41:26.480]  why Loki is so interested in, in, in attacking Thor.
[2:41:26.480 --> 2:41:28.160]  It's not just out of jealousy.
[2:41:28.160 --> 2:41:29.920]  There's a practicality to it.
[2:41:29.920 --> 2:41:37.360]  If I can get Thor occupied, if I can get him incapacitated, if I can kill Thor, then, then
[2:41:37.360 --> 2:41:42.000]  my sort of wickedness will be able to run rough shot over all of the women that are left.
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:47.800]  And that's the, and that's the true spirit and, and, and sort of motivation of that Loki
[2:41:47.800 --> 2:41:49.520]  beta male type character.
[2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:55.400]  They want the alpha males to be imprisoned, to be handcuffed by under the table or back,
[2:41:55.400 --> 2:42:01.360]  room, sell out agreements, or they want us dead and they're not, and that, that seems
[2:42:01.360 --> 2:42:02.360]  obvious to me.
[2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:03.360]  No, you're right.
[2:42:03.360 --> 2:42:05.480]  And you've got a great way of putting things.
[2:42:05.480 --> 2:42:08.520]  Join us again soon for a full hour, my friend.
[2:42:08.520 --> 2:42:09.840]  We're so glad you're running for Congress.
[2:42:09.840 --> 2:42:12.800]  We're so glad you're in the arena like this and you're right.
[2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:17.560]  The Thor versus Loki ethos is really the greatest way to describe it.
[2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:22.080]  Scams and fraud versus strength and honor, Royce White, Royce White.us.
[2:42:22.080 --> 2:42:23.080]  People should go there.
[2:42:23.080 --> 2:42:24.080]  They should support you.
[2:42:24.080 --> 2:42:25.320]  They should, in fact, stay there.
[2:42:25.320 --> 2:42:26.320]  They've got callers.
[2:42:26.320 --> 2:42:27.320]  They've got to get to them.
[2:42:27.320 --> 2:42:28.320]  I'll go on the next hour.
[2:42:28.320 --> 2:42:29.320]  Callers will be right back with us.
[2:42:29.320 --> 2:42:30.320]  I'm going to talk about how do people volunteer?
[2:42:30.320 --> 2:42:31.320]  How do they get involved?
[2:42:31.320 --> 2:42:33.560]  How do we get excited and get you elected?
[2:42:33.560 --> 2:42:38.600]  Royce White, Royce White.us, find us great writing at RoyceWhite.substack.com.
[2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:40.720]  We need this guy in Congress.
[2:42:40.720 --> 2:42:44.880]  And you imagine, whoa, I love it.
[2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:46.360]  Humanity has awakened.
[2:42:46.360 --> 2:42:48.400]  We are rising from the sleep.
[2:42:48.400 --> 2:42:52.920]  This is an incredible time to be alive and we're going to discover just who's on our
[2:42:52.920 --> 2:42:58.080]  side and who isn't.
[2:42:58.080 --> 2:43:01.000]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:06.720]  And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting
[2:43:06.720 --> 2:43:11.160]  people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[2:43:11.160 --> 2:43:16.040]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic,
[2:43:16.040 --> 2:43:17.280]  it doesn't matter.
[2:43:17.280 --> 2:43:21.740]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[2:43:21.740 --> 2:43:23.320]  It's just like you need oxygen.
[2:43:23.320 --> 2:43:25.040]  You die in four minutes without oxygen.
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:27.520]  You die in five or six days without water.
[2:43:27.520 --> 2:43:29.080]  You die in a month without food.
[2:43:29.080 --> 2:43:34.160]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that
[2:43:34.160 --> 2:43:35.240]  you need.
[2:43:35.240 --> 2:43:39.160]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[2:43:39.160 --> 2:43:44.360]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's
[2:43:44.360 --> 2:43:50.800]  defenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[2:43:50.800 --> 2:43:53.760]  The old young black white, you need vitamin D3.
[2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:58.560]  This is the best quality out there and it funds the infowar 50% off.
[2:43:58.560 --> 2:44:07.640]  What are champions made of here's a man who can show you
[2:44:07.640 --> 2:44:13.000]  Triple eight, two, five, three, thirteen, one, three, nine, triple eight, two, five, three,
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:15.240]  three, one, three, nine, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine is the
[2:44:15.240 --> 2:44:16.240]  infowarstore hotline.
[2:44:16.240 --> 2:44:17.720]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, triple eight, two, five, three,
[2:44:47.720 --> 2:45:01.080]  With the world awakening, I think it's important that we rise to prevent them right now, take
[2:45:01.080 --> 2:45:04.960]  advantage of this moment, and I have always an idea that something everybody can do, that
[2:45:04.960 --> 2:45:10.160]  every listener can do, I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to hang banners over highways
[2:45:10.160 --> 2:45:15.280]  and managing a champagne or a cup of alea, it says Alex Jones is right, info wars.com,
[2:45:15.280 --> 2:45:18.360]  we stand with the truckers, arrest out or whatever it's effective for.
[2:45:18.360 --> 2:45:22.480]  Brother, I'm so glad you called, elaborate on this, yes, now is the time in your small
[2:45:22.480 --> 2:45:26.640]  town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on
[2:45:26.640 --> 2:45:32.600]  your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction, what do you recommend
[2:45:32.600 --> 2:45:34.000]  people say on these banner hangs?
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:39.600]  I have a few ideas, first of all, Alex Jones is going to form, arrest out, arrest out, swap,
[2:45:39.600 --> 2:45:43.280]  the vaccine is poison, there's tons of things, I said keep it short, keep it concise.
[2:45:43.280 --> 2:45:48.040]  No, I agree, arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates, the COVID-vaxx is poison, beautiful.
[2:45:48.040 --> 2:45:51.680]  Yeah, there's ways that we can all be involved, that we can all be effective, so that's what
[2:45:51.680 --> 2:45:52.680]  I'm calling about.
[2:45:52.680 --> 2:45:56.800]  God bless you Chris, in Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today, thank
[2:45:56.800 --> 2:45:57.800]  you so much.

[2:47:12.040 --> 2:47:17.840]  Welcome back folks, final segment of the show, we're about to go right to your phone calls,
[2:47:17.840 --> 2:47:21.920]  but you know, if folks wouldn't have believed in me, we wouldn't be here today, and all
[2:47:21.920 --> 2:47:27.000]  we've been through together, you did it listeners and viewers, and I got to tell you, I support
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:30.160]  a lot of congressional candidates and quite a few of them, like Senator Paul, we got
[2:47:30.160 --> 2:47:33.120]  elected and others, and Trump.
[2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:37.240]  But if we ever give up, they win, and so I come to you constantly and say you should
[2:47:37.240 --> 2:47:42.400]  support people, but I got a really good feeling about Royce White, my spider sense just loves
[2:47:42.400 --> 2:47:48.080]  this guy, and just senses victory all around him, we need to get him in Congress, and even
[2:47:48.080 --> 2:47:51.800]  if it doesn't win this round or the next round, doesn't matter, this is who we need to get
[2:47:51.800 --> 2:47:57.800]  in, people like this man, and it could help bring people together and short circuit all
[2:47:57.800 --> 2:48:02.040]  their lives, this is the type of guy we need, I think he could beat Ilhan Omar, despite
[2:48:02.040 --> 2:48:06.640]  all the gangster money she's got, and establishment funding, if you get excited.
[2:48:06.640 --> 2:48:11.240]  So Royce White, I'm glad you threw your hat in the ring here, RoyceWhite.us, how do people
[2:48:11.240 --> 2:48:15.360]  in two minutes get behind you and go against Ilhan Omar?
[2:48:15.360 --> 2:48:19.680]  Yeah, and thank you for having me, Alex, I really appreciate it in your audience and
[2:48:19.680 --> 2:48:20.880]  all the work you've done.
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:26.240]  I would say we have to stay active, we have to understand that the way the liberal agenda,
[2:48:26.240 --> 2:48:32.920]  the globalist agenda has taken a hold of the masses is by controlling them through fear,
[2:48:32.920 --> 2:48:37.320]  the fear of this ever expansive in different middle, all of the people of this country
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:41.560]  or the great majority of the people in this country do not believe in these authoritarian
[2:48:41.560 --> 2:48:47.440]  elitist pipe dreams, they are afraid of isolation, and when they see a person like me step up
[2:48:47.440 --> 2:48:51.800]  and speak out about freedom and ideas that have been deemed radical by the establishment
[2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:57.040]  and Alex Jones as well, they feel afraid to be able to support us and to be able to open
[2:48:57.040 --> 2:49:01.880]  up and say that they believe in these ideas, so we have to hit social media and everything
[2:49:01.880 --> 2:49:07.800]  that has tried to bring tyranny down on us, and we have to fight and be loud and be loud
[2:49:07.800 --> 2:49:14.880]  as the left that has tried to hijack people through fear, that we have to become the new
[2:49:14.880 --> 2:49:19.160]  energy of this country and we have to be committed to that fight.
[2:49:19.160 --> 2:49:20.160]  That's beautiful.
[2:49:20.160 --> 2:49:22.280]  So how do people get behind your campaign right now?
[2:49:22.280 --> 2:49:26.920]  Because you've been a great activist for the Uighurs and great activist for mentally handicapped
[2:49:26.920 --> 2:49:29.960]  folks in the US, you've been fighting over a decade.
[2:49:29.960 --> 2:49:35.480]  How do people right now not play games, help get your campaign going and get behind you
[2:49:35.480 --> 2:49:37.360]  right now?
[2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:43.480]  If you're able, if you believe in freedom, if you believe in the resistance against tyranny,
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:48.240]  voicewhite.us, you can go to our page, you can sign up to volunteer, join our newsletter
[2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:50.960]  and email list, and obviously donate if you're able.
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:54.880]  That's right, it takes money to win a war, and our listeners are the best, that's why
[2:49:54.880 --> 2:49:57.960]  I come to you and people who've felt led by the spirit to do it.
[2:49:57.960 --> 2:50:01.080]  We need to get this guy in Congress, spend a minute on this.
[2:50:01.080 --> 2:50:05.240]  What are you going to do, even when you get into Congress and take, I mean, just unseating
[2:50:05.240 --> 2:50:11.040]  Ilhan Omar is like the most, I mean, when we had a crappy candidate, we should back
[2:50:11.040 --> 2:50:12.040]  him.
[2:50:12.040 --> 2:50:14.680]  It's like a dream candidate, brother.
[2:50:14.680 --> 2:50:15.680]  I appreciate that.
[2:50:15.680 --> 2:50:19.600]  Well, the first thing I think that we have to do is decouple ourselves from the CCP.
[2:50:19.600 --> 2:50:24.320]  Okay, we can't be a country that says we're based on the values of freedom, on the values
[2:50:24.320 --> 2:50:31.520]  of justice, on the values of democracy or constitutional republic, and be dependent on a country that
[2:50:31.520 --> 2:50:35.200]  is explicitly opposite, right, and corrupt is a day as long.
[2:50:35.200 --> 2:50:40.200]  We have to decouple ourselves, we have to bring our manufacturing and jobs back to America,
[2:50:40.200 --> 2:50:44.320]  and when we do that, we can start to build a new culture and identity about labor, about
[2:50:44.320 --> 2:50:47.120]  work, and restore national honor.
[2:50:47.120 --> 2:50:48.120]  I totally agree.
[2:50:48.120 --> 2:50:52.800]  All right, Roy Swight, RoySwight.us, thank you so much.
[2:50:52.800 --> 2:50:53.800]  Very exciting.
[2:50:53.800 --> 2:50:54.800]  Imagine him in Congress.
[2:50:54.800 --> 2:50:57.480]  He was right in the middle of nowhere, I'd support him.
[2:50:57.480 --> 2:51:00.280]  He's going to be against Ilhan Omar, folks.
[2:51:00.280 --> 2:51:02.520]  All right, let's jam your calls in.
[2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:08.200]  I want to get to Mankind, James, Anonymous, Greg, Alkiller, Tom, and Charles.
[2:51:08.200 --> 2:51:09.200]  Thank you so much for holding.
[2:51:09.200 --> 2:51:12.720]  We're going to go to the order that received Mankind in Arizona.
[2:51:12.720 --> 2:51:13.720]  Your first up.
[2:51:13.720 --> 2:51:14.720]  Thank you for holding.
[2:51:14.720 --> 2:51:15.720]  Go ahead.
[2:51:15.720 --> 2:51:17.960]  Alex, what's going on, man?
[2:51:17.960 --> 2:51:19.600]  Great broadcast today.
[2:51:19.600 --> 2:51:25.880]  Roy Swight, man, wow, he's just incredible.
[2:51:25.880 --> 2:51:27.400]  I'm so glad you had him on.
[2:51:27.400 --> 2:51:32.920]  Oh, I go and watch his podcast, and I'm busy, I barely watch Joe, so I love Joe Rogan.
[2:51:32.920 --> 2:51:33.920]  I watch his podcast.
[2:51:33.920 --> 2:51:34.920]  That guy's smart.
[2:51:34.920 --> 2:51:35.920]  You know what I'm saying?
[2:51:35.920 --> 2:51:38.680]  When he goes over like an hour, he, you know, I learn stuff from that guy.
[2:51:38.680 --> 2:51:39.680]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:51:39.680 --> 2:51:45.200]  And especially when he was talking about the part of him having steak here in America as
[2:51:45.200 --> 2:51:49.680]  a black man, you know, that's something I definitely resonate with as well.
[2:51:49.680 --> 2:51:52.600]  You know, black men are out here building for America.
[2:51:52.600 --> 2:51:57.320]  Well, this is your country, and they're telling you that you don't have any part of it.
[2:51:57.320 --> 2:51:59.120]  He has steak here in America.
[2:51:59.120 --> 2:52:01.160]  Ilhan Omar does not.
[2:52:01.160 --> 2:52:02.680]  She is not from here.
[2:52:02.680 --> 2:52:03.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:52:03.680 --> 2:52:07.880]  She could come here and embrace it, and then she would, but she decides to piss on that
[2:52:07.880 --> 2:52:08.880]  steak.
[2:52:08.880 --> 2:52:09.880]  Exactly.
[2:52:09.880 --> 2:52:10.880]  Exactly.
[2:52:10.880 --> 2:52:15.160]  And it just, it's just, man, I'm really moved in the spirit today because every single phone
[2:52:15.160 --> 2:52:20.560]  call of, and I'll try to make this quick, I just kind of had two, two questions.
[2:52:20.560 --> 2:52:25.880]  Just number one, you know, our culture is our infrastructure.
[2:52:25.880 --> 2:52:31.160]  And you know, real men are out here building while we're going through all of this and
[2:52:31.160 --> 2:52:33.960]  we're listening to you and you're doing what you're doing.
[2:52:33.960 --> 2:52:40.200]  But you know, the other caller that called earlier too was solutions to these problems
[2:52:40.200 --> 2:52:44.680]  that we know are coming, as far as for the guy who was saying that he was getting that
[2:52:44.680 --> 2:52:48.520]  low broadcast TV show or something like that.
[2:52:48.520 --> 2:52:53.840]  Yeah, micro FM, micro AM, yeah, the transmitters everywhere, they're cheap, they're easy.
[2:52:53.840 --> 2:52:56.200]  You plug them into the internet, you tell your neighbors about it, they can pick it up
[2:52:56.200 --> 2:53:00.800]  on AM, FM, UHF, VHF, and you just pick a channel that's open, it's beautiful.
[2:53:00.800 --> 2:53:01.800]  People love it.
[2:53:01.800 --> 2:53:02.800]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:53:02.800 --> 2:53:05.920]  And again, that was kind of one of my questions.
[2:53:05.920 --> 2:53:08.040]  It's kind of like micro brew beer.
[2:53:08.040 --> 2:53:10.720]  Like 30 years ago, nobody knew what it was, 20 years.
[2:53:10.720 --> 2:53:12.760]  Now nobody wants regular beer, they want micro brew.
[2:53:12.760 --> 2:53:16.720]  It's kind of like, imagine putting your own little station in, sorry, go ahead.
[2:53:16.720 --> 2:53:17.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:53:17.720 --> 2:53:22.560]  Everybody loves the micro brew now because they see how effective it is.
[2:53:22.560 --> 2:53:25.200]  And again, that's actually what we're doing as a culture.
[2:53:25.200 --> 2:53:28.600]  And so, you know, we're out here building infrastructure.
[2:53:28.600 --> 2:53:34.720]  I've built my infrastructure with a website that I put up, because again, if that's...
[2:53:34.720 --> 2:53:38.120]  Beautiful, tell us, tell us the name of the website.
[2:53:38.120 --> 2:53:48.880]  It is Prosphetic.net, that's P-R-O-P-H-E, P is in Tango, C is in Charlie.net.
[2:53:48.880 --> 2:53:54.560]  I've been putting out content, I've been helping redistribute broadcast and taking things
[2:53:54.560 --> 2:53:55.560]  on my own.
[2:53:55.560 --> 2:53:57.480]  It's beautiful what you're doing, sir.
[2:53:57.480 --> 2:53:58.480]  We love you.
[2:53:58.480 --> 2:53:59.560]  You're a person who won't get everybody.
[2:53:59.560 --> 2:54:00.560]  Thank you so much.
[2:54:00.560 --> 2:54:01.560]  Have a great weekend.
[2:54:01.560 --> 2:54:04.280]  Let's talk to James in Oklahoma.
[2:54:04.280 --> 2:54:05.440]  Welcome, James!
[2:54:05.440 --> 2:54:07.740]  Yeah, I just want to talk about...
[2:54:07.740 --> 2:54:12.980]  Give thanks to God and Jesus Christ, to give Him all the praise for opening up our eyes
[2:54:12.980 --> 2:54:16.640]  to what is going on in this world, and the deceit to the devil.
[2:54:16.640 --> 2:54:17.640]  And I just...
[2:54:17.640 --> 2:54:20.720]  And let's be clear, people that are devil worshipers don't get it.
[2:54:20.720 --> 2:54:22.880]  They think God needs, quote, worship.
[2:54:22.880 --> 2:54:25.800]  No, us recognizing God opens the channel.
[2:54:25.800 --> 2:54:28.460]  And, oh, Jesus, we love you, God.
[2:54:28.460 --> 2:54:33.940]  Thank you. That opens the channel. Our recognition makes the connection. God doesn't need to
[2:54:33.940 --> 2:54:37.900]  be worshiped. Worship means once you're in the presence, you're like, oh my gosh, this
[2:54:37.900 --> 2:54:42.460]  is incredible. I totally agree with this. I am in Congress with this. We have to open
[2:54:42.460 --> 2:54:47.780]  up the channel and say, I love you, Jesus. I love you, Holy Spirit. Help me. God is a
[2:54:47.780 --> 2:54:51.500]  free will God. I like the devil. The devil rapes you. Christ is not going to rape you.
[2:54:51.500 --> 2:54:53.580]  You have to open up. Does that make sense?
[2:54:53.580 --> 2:54:58.140]  That's perfect. That's perfect. That's right. And you know, we do that by prayer and fasting.
[2:54:58.140 --> 2:55:02.820]  Fasting is a big thing and I just encourage everybody to be able to do that even this
[2:55:02.820 --> 2:55:07.220]  weekend and just seek God and what He wants you to do, who He wants you to give money
[2:55:07.220 --> 2:55:13.220]  to, who He wants you to talk to, and how He wants you to prepare for what is coming ahead
[2:55:13.220 --> 2:55:16.180]  because we're going to go through these trying times.
[2:55:16.180 --> 2:55:20.780]  I agree. What do you think is about to happen with Russia and everything else, sir?
[2:55:20.780 --> 2:55:27.340]  You know, I see it at de-escalating possibly, but if China invades Taiwan, then it's on.
[2:55:27.340 --> 2:55:30.260]  It's just we're going all the way. We're going all the way.
[2:55:30.260 --> 2:55:34.460]  I agree. If they attack Taiwan, the U.S. is going to go over with China.
[2:55:34.460 --> 2:55:40.700]  So, I mean, hopefully it doesn't get to that point. So those that are waked up to it can
[2:55:40.700 --> 2:55:45.340]  prepare even more. But the time is short.
[2:55:45.340 --> 2:55:50.980]  James, the time is short. Thank you so much. Beautiful points. Let's talk down to Tom
[2:55:50.980 --> 2:55:52.620]  in Canada. Tom, welcome.
[2:55:52.620 --> 2:55:59.980]  Well, I think Putin's going to look at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
[2:55:59.980 --> 2:56:04.380]  What do you say? Back off your phone a little bit.
[2:56:04.380 --> 2:56:10.220]  Yeah, I think Putin's going to take a look at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
[2:56:10.220 --> 2:56:16.540]  It's like the Russian version of the Kennedy Space Center. And you might make a play to
[2:56:16.540 --> 2:56:20.820]  connect that with the rest of Russia.
[2:56:20.820 --> 2:56:27.340]  We talked about Kazakhstan and their main NASA base, the Russian space bases there.
[2:56:27.340 --> 2:56:32.620]  Yes. But your phone's a little distorted. What do you say you think Putin's going to
[2:56:32.620 --> 2:56:33.620]  do?
[2:56:33.620 --> 2:56:41.900]  He might look at connecting the Baikonur Cosmodrome with the rest of Russia because right now
[2:56:41.900 --> 2:56:47.540]  it's in Kazakhstan's territory.
[2:56:47.540 --> 2:56:52.420]  Very interesting things you're saying. I'm not going to be dishonest. I'm not understanding
[2:56:52.420 --> 2:56:57.340]  what you're saying. What are you getting at? What is he going to link up? He's got a couple
[2:56:57.340 --> 2:56:59.300]  of space bases. What's going on?
[2:56:59.300 --> 2:57:08.340]  Yeah, he wants to ensure Russian control of the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
[2:57:08.340 --> 2:57:13.260]  Oh, yeah, there's no doubt. Absolutely. Great points. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you,
[2:57:13.260 --> 2:57:16.820]  Tom. That was a great point. Your phone was just overdriven. I had trouble understanding
[2:57:16.820 --> 2:57:21.020]  you. Amazing. Yeah, the globalists are obsessed with space, and they don't want us to know
[2:57:21.020 --> 2:57:25.100]  what's going on out there. There's a lot of stuff going on out there. All right, we're
[2:57:25.100 --> 2:57:31.100]  going to take more phone calls straight ahead in hour number four on this Friday broadcast.
[2:57:31.100 --> 2:57:36.940]  Then Saturday, look for emergency reports, then FullWars.com. Every day we're on air

[2:59:50.260 --> 3:00:00.780]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:00.780 --> 3:00:05.220]  I want to write to your phone calls here in the fourth hour today ahead of Kate Daly taking
[3:00:05.220 --> 3:00:09.220]  over in 15 minutes. Let's go ahead and talk to the caller who's holding the longest,
[3:00:09.220 --> 3:00:15.020]  Owl Killer, calling in for over a decade from Virginia, once it's another Owl Killer. Owl
[3:00:15.020 --> 3:00:16.020]  Killer, welcome.
[3:00:16.020 --> 3:00:21.780]  No, Alex, this is still the same Owl Killer. Hey, I just want to say to everybody listening.
[3:00:21.780 --> 3:00:26.820]  I donate $30 a month on top of all the supplements that I purchased from you. At least the way
[3:00:26.820 --> 3:00:31.100]  I figure it is, a dollar a day for all the information you're putting out, and any time
[3:00:31.100 --> 3:00:34.140]  I can, I'm buying supplements to try to get you out of there.
[3:00:34.140 --> 3:00:38.620]  Well, if you weren't supporting us, we wouldn't be here, brother, so thank you.
[3:00:38.620 --> 3:00:43.300]  I'll give you an example of information that he was putting out. I remember in 2014, when
[3:00:43.300 --> 3:00:50.780]  I was stationed in Bahrain at the time, when Russia, there was a vote in Crimea where the
[3:00:50.780 --> 3:00:56.340]  people had voted to join the Russian Federation and Russia annexed Crimea. You said if NATO
[3:00:56.340 --> 3:01:02.100]  pushes, that Vladimir Putin will take all the way up to Kiev, and that's where we are
[3:01:02.100 --> 3:01:10.540]  today. Again, I don't like to see any type of loss of life at all. War is a reaction
[3:01:10.540 --> 3:01:18.060]  and peace is a thinker, thinker's man game. But if you listened to Vladimir Putin's speech
[3:01:18.060 --> 3:01:22.660]  that he gave earlier in the week, and you know, a lot of people apologize for the communists
[3:01:22.660 --> 3:01:26.540]  and said communism's evil, and we want you to be your sovereign country, but you can't
[3:01:26.540 --> 3:01:31.420]  be a vassal of the West to attack us, it was powerful. It was true.
[3:01:31.420 --> 3:01:37.500]  Absolutely. And now the other thing that people don't pay attention to was he also brought
[3:01:37.500 --> 3:01:46.020]  up Bosnia and Kosovo, and his reaction to it in how he saw NATO basically just killing
[3:01:46.020 --> 3:01:47.380]  people and destroying them.
[3:01:47.380 --> 3:01:52.420]  Oh yeah, NATO dropping thousands of tons of DU on the people.
[3:01:52.420 --> 3:01:59.940]  But another reaction that he had, I remember when Mo Mar Gaddafi was overthrown in Libya
[3:01:59.940 --> 3:02:04.820]  and how he, the outcry that he had, he was like how he was murdered in the street like
[3:02:04.820 --> 3:02:07.900]  that. Gaddafi, not a great guy. It's just a reality, a situation.
[3:02:07.900 --> 3:02:13.020]  Gaddafi, though, came into the West, invested billions in Europe, was set up and wanted
[3:02:13.020 --> 3:02:17.340]  to love Obama, and believed Obama was really a Muslim and wanted to work with him, and
[3:02:17.340 --> 3:02:21.100]  they set him up and killed him. So I'm not going to even say Gaddafi was a bad guy. I
[3:02:21.100 --> 3:02:24.820]  think Gaddafi really meant well, actually. He wasn't perfect. He was born into that,
[3:02:24.820 --> 3:02:31.180]  and he did that coup and everything, but they set him up and raped him to death with a Kalishnikov
[3:02:31.180 --> 3:02:32.180]  bayonet.
[3:02:32.180 --> 3:02:40.500]  Yep, and it was Putin's reaction to that. That was a NATO operation, so that is the
[3:02:40.500 --> 3:02:47.780]  fear he has of NATO on his borders. That's why he is so disturbed by the encroaching
[3:02:47.780 --> 3:02:52.860]  military bases and the weapons being put that are being sent to Ukraine. But at the end
[3:02:52.860 --> 3:02:59.620]  of the day, this whole great reset, you talk about why does Ram Paul or Ron Paul talk about
[3:02:59.620 --> 3:03:03.740]  this? Because at the end of the day, Ron Paul was right. It's the bankers. You talk about
[3:03:03.740 --> 3:03:09.060]  the Black Rock, how they're buying everything up with money that they have, they're buying
[3:03:09.060 --> 3:03:13.380]  up all the tangible assets before the dollar is basically worthless. And at the end of
[3:03:13.380 --> 3:03:17.060]  the day, they are the ones that are pushing these wars.
[3:03:17.060 --> 3:03:23.700]  Lee Stranahan was on your show last week, and he brought up the Miguel Kortokovsky issue
[3:03:23.700 --> 3:03:30.460]  with Russia when Putin had, when he had nationalized Yukos oil. The shares went to Jacob Rothschild.
[3:03:30.460 --> 3:03:31.460]  You cannot make this up.
[3:03:31.460 --> 3:03:36.220]  Oh, and Rothschilds have been involved in everything evil forever. I mean, it's like
[3:03:36.220 --> 3:03:41.820]  cancer. I mean, it's just, they funded Napoleon, they funded Hitler, and then Hitler killed
[3:03:41.820 --> 3:03:45.260]  Rothschilds, but they don't care. Wherever the power is at, they're going to be funding
[3:03:45.260 --> 3:03:48.700]  all sides of it. They just can't help it. They own the economists. It's just all out
[3:03:48.700 --> 3:03:49.700]  of control.
[3:03:49.700 --> 3:03:53.660]  I appreciate you, brother. I appreciate your call. All right, we're going to go to break
[3:03:53.660 --> 3:03:58.140]  in one minute. Because again, while we're still on air, because we have 300 radio affiliates
[3:03:58.140 --> 3:04:03.500]  and radio has 15 minutes of ads an hour. That's the standard deal. We do it. Everybody's
[3:04:03.500 --> 3:04:07.300]  spoiled the podcast. So am I. It pisses me off. But that's how it is. We love our stations.
[3:04:07.300 --> 3:04:10.500]  We support them. So we're going to go to a one minute break, join stations and go to
[3:04:10.500 --> 3:04:15.140]  anonymous in Maryland, Greg in Florida and Charles in Utah. And then Kate Daly's about
[3:04:15.140 --> 3:04:21.060]  to take over here. And then the great Owen Troyer, who does such a good job. He was great
[3:04:21.060 --> 3:04:25.100]  when I hired him six years ago. He's even better now. He is amazing. So is the morning
[3:04:25.100 --> 3:04:29.780]  show with Harrison Smith, 8am. And of course, they've had Matt filling in doing a great
[3:04:29.780 --> 3:04:37.980]  job while he's been off 8aminfowars.com, American Journal, 3pm central, the war room with the
[3:04:37.980 --> 3:04:44.180]  great Owen, the cup destroyer, Troyer. That is what it's all about. Your word of mouth,
[3:04:44.180 --> 3:04:49.660]  we win. You don't spread the word. We fail. And so do you. But you're not failing. You've
[3:04:49.660 --> 3:04:54.020]  been promoting everything we're doing. And I salute you.
[3:04:54.020 --> 3:05:01.740]  Mike in California. Thanks for calling. I think we're barking up the wrong tree, calling
[3:05:01.740 --> 3:05:07.820]  this gain of function research. Now, if you read the actual 2014 legislation, the US government
[3:05:07.820 --> 3:05:13.300]  gain of function, deliberative process and research funding, pause on selected gain of
[3:05:13.300 --> 3:05:18.100]  function research involving influenza, MERS and SARS virus does nothing about SARS like
[3:05:18.100 --> 3:05:23.100]  viruses. And it's a research funding pause. It's not a stop. It's not a prohibition.
[3:05:23.100 --> 3:05:26.580]  It's when you come to a four way intersection, there's the stop sign, you stop, you look
[3:05:26.580 --> 3:05:31.260]  both ways and then you proceed. And so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function,
[3:05:31.260 --> 3:05:35.660]  just selected gain of function. But they'll argue that this is actually characterization
[3:05:35.660 --> 3:05:40.020]  and qualification research. So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was
[3:05:40.020 --> 3:05:43.380]  right. They don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function.
[3:05:43.380 --> 3:05:46.460]  You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself. That's why he hasn't been arrested.
[3:05:46.460 --> 3:05:50.660]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do.
[3:05:50.660 --> 3:05:54.660]  But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function. They're making something deadly
[3:05:54.660 --> 3:05:57.460]  that spreads more easily to hurt people. Thank you, Mike. We love you.
[3:05:57.460 --> 3:06:10.900]  If you are receiving this transmission, if you are receiving this transmission, you are
[3:06:10.900 --> 3:06:17.780]  the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones, the echoes of the past become the dreams of
[3:06:17.780 --> 3:06:46.180]  the future. Crucified for no sin. Which one passed the old graveyard? Let's talk to anonymous
[3:06:46.180 --> 3:06:51.700]  Greg and Charles for we hand the baton to the next amazing guest. Okay, Daly, take it
[3:06:51.700 --> 3:06:58.700]  over. Greg in Florida. Thank you for joining us on this incredible Friday edition. What's
[3:06:58.700 --> 3:07:03.740]  your view on what's happening? Hey, Alex, how are you? I mean, it's getting close to
[3:07:03.740 --> 3:07:09.700]  the next level here. I am definitely concerned. Hey, brother, Godspeed and all the force be
[3:07:09.700 --> 3:07:14.980]  with you. Last time I spoke with you a couple of months ago, we I brought up the pandemic
[3:07:14.980 --> 3:07:20.580]  bonds. And I wanted to go over a couple of things with you real quick. I just about an
[3:07:20.580 --> 3:07:24.740]  hour, about an hour and a half ago, I just spoke with a friend of mine who's outside
[3:07:24.740 --> 3:07:32.180]  the country. He's a former special ops special force guy for the US. His wife is from the
[3:07:32.180 --> 3:07:40.100]  Ukraine. And last week, he got they got most of her family out except for her parents.
[3:07:40.100 --> 3:07:47.380]  I don't know why they stay behind. They're outside a Kiev right now. And they said it's
[3:07:47.380 --> 3:07:57.020]  not really that it's not bad yet. But of course, standard military op is, you know, for them
[3:07:57.020 --> 3:08:01.340]  to close down the roads and everything, you know, getting into Poland. That's where the
[3:08:01.340 --> 3:08:09.380]  rest of the family went last week. The next thing I want to touch base with you. And this
[3:08:09.380 --> 3:08:15.780]  you remember back in the Obama administration, all of the bonds that were written China was
[3:08:15.780 --> 3:08:23.740]  basically giving giving the US a lot of money. And we're basically turning over these bonds
[3:08:23.740 --> 3:08:27.820]  to them. Yeah, China was buying the majority of our sovereign debt.
[3:08:27.820 --> 3:08:34.220]  Absolutely. And then China still during the Obama administration before he left office.
[3:08:34.220 --> 3:08:40.380]  The there was no other country in the world that would buy even at a huge discount, the
[3:08:40.380 --> 3:08:47.620]  paper because China knew they weren't going to get paid back. Okay. When this was happening,
[3:08:47.620 --> 3:08:51.980]  you know, you start I started hearing stories. I, you know, I do a lot of inter I do international
[3:08:51.980 --> 3:08:58.980]  trade for last 30 years. You're hearing about more and more Chinese people, what they're
[3:08:58.980 --> 3:09:05.340]  doing here, et cetera, et cetera. Then, you know, the last 10 years, they've been the
[3:09:05.340 --> 3:09:17.860]  largest VC, you know, venture capital investors here in the US, even more than the US institutions.
[3:09:17.860 --> 3:09:21.620]  And you know, that's one, that's one thing. And another thing I will tell you this, you
[3:09:21.620 --> 3:09:31.100]  beat some comments about a half hour ago about wars being won or decided before they're ever
[3:09:31.100 --> 3:09:37.260]  fought. And that's so true. I had a company, a laser called laser take international. It
[3:09:37.260 --> 3:09:42.940]  was my chief scientist. This is back in the early 2000s. My chief scientist, his name
[3:09:42.940 --> 3:09:49.580]  was Alan Hill. Okay, Alan fact, it was even his name was I saw one time even on the history
[3:09:49.580 --> 3:09:56.540]  channel, Alan Hill, developed and directed Star Wars under the Reagan administration.
[3:09:56.540 --> 3:10:03.220]  This is basically what Reagan, when he told the guy with the birthmark, what's his name?
[3:10:03.220 --> 3:10:10.540]  Yeah, told Gorbachev, you know, there's nothing you could do to us. Okay. And that's basically
[3:10:10.540 --> 3:10:17.580]  you saying you were the director of laser tech? No, no, I own laser tech. You own laser
[3:10:17.580 --> 3:10:22.380]  tech. Yes, yes. No, no, actually, I know some about that. So let me put you on hold
[3:10:22.380 --> 3:10:26.020]  your name and number. Would you like to will prove who you are? I believe you recognize
[3:10:26.020 --> 3:10:29.380]  your voice actually from somewhere. And when you come on the show and talk about this,
[3:10:29.380 --> 3:10:34.140]  this is big news. Absolutely. All right, guys, put his name and number, guys get his name
[3:10:34.140 --> 3:10:38.520]  number. I want him on as a guest like Sunday or Monday. Thank you so much, sir. Wow, incredible
[3:10:38.520 --> 3:10:43.820]  people call in. That is just amazing stuff. So don't let him go away. Please see the name
[3:10:43.820 --> 3:10:48.260]  and number. Okay, let's go to anonymous in Maryland. Anonymous, you're on the air. We'll
[3:10:48.260 --> 3:10:54.540]  go to Charles and we'll wrap it up. Go ahead. Anonymous. Yeah, decade long listener, first
[3:10:54.540 --> 3:11:00.140]  time callers. Thank you. I just want to respond to just everything on a universal level that
[3:11:00.140 --> 3:11:04.380]  you're talking about today. And I just want to say a quote here to start it out. Whenever
[3:11:04.380 --> 3:11:10.980]  any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, life, liberty and the pursuit
[3:11:10.980 --> 3:11:18.340]  of happiness, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and institute a
[3:11:18.340 --> 3:11:24.380]  new government. And time and time again, people ask you what to do. No, you're right. Declaration
[3:11:24.380 --> 3:11:30.660]  of Independence is there. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and they ask what, what, what to do?
[3:11:30.660 --> 3:11:35.660]  We have three vessels. We have the body, the mind and the spirit, right? They can't break
[3:11:35.660 --> 3:11:45.340]  our spirit. Our wills live through our courage. Buy reset corn. Buy the storeable food. Up
[3:11:45.340 --> 3:11:50.980]  your, you know, for your body to be prepared, you have to feed it the right things for your
[3:11:50.980 --> 3:11:56.220]  mind to be prepared. You have to feed it the right things for your spirit to be prepared.
[3:11:56.220 --> 3:12:01.820]  You have to feed it the right things. Your products work and they elevate you in a way
[3:12:01.820 --> 3:12:07.820]  that's unexplainable. I suffer from RA. You don't know what RA is. It's rheumatoid arthritis.
[3:12:07.820 --> 3:12:13.820]  Until I had bodies in my life, I was a miserable person and I put on a fake smile for a long
[3:12:13.820 --> 3:12:19.820]  time. It's a lot easier to absorb information, to want to get on and have the time to listen,
[3:12:19.820 --> 3:12:27.100]  to connect and meditate not only with the universe, but with yourself. We're, we're, we're building,
[3:12:27.100 --> 3:12:31.340]  right? We're building these three things, the body, the mind and the spirit. We're backing
[3:12:31.340 --> 3:12:36.220]  those things up with good things and the good stuff that's out there.
[3:12:36.220 --> 3:12:39.660]  No, you're absolutely right. Like I know all this health stuff and I try to follow it,
[3:12:39.660 --> 3:12:43.100]  but I wouldn't even be alive. I didn't take the supplements with all the stress I'm under,
[3:12:43.100 --> 3:12:48.540]  the things I do to my body, but beautifully said. I want to thank you so much. Anonymous from
[3:12:48.540 --> 3:12:53.580]  Maryland. What's your final view on Russia? What do you think's about to happen?
[3:12:55.180 --> 3:13:00.860]  I mean, I think that we're going to be at war. I think that they already have this in our minds
[3:13:00.860 --> 3:13:06.300]  in their minds, not in our minds. Sorry, correct myself there and that we need to be prepared.
[3:13:06.300 --> 3:13:10.380]  You know, the next step that we can take is spreading word of mouth when we, when we keep
[3:13:10.380 --> 3:13:15.980]  this information and knowledge to ourselves, we gain nothing. No, I agree. It's cancerous. You've
[3:13:15.980 --> 3:13:21.740]  got to take the evil you know about and expose it or it kills you. Thank you so much for your call.
[3:13:21.740 --> 3:13:26.220]  Charles in Utah, I had a Kate Dally about to take over. Go ahead and thank you so much for
[3:13:26.220 --> 3:13:31.820]  holding. Truckers are going to DC and we have Homeland Security announcing they're watching them.
[3:13:31.820 --> 3:13:37.980]  Ooh, Americans are peacefully driving their trucks and, and, and, and Socky says we're watching you.
[3:13:37.980 --> 3:13:41.580]  She's totally punched drunk and doesn't realize what she's doing.
[3:13:43.900 --> 3:13:50.780]  Hey, Charles, I was just going to say I wish the convoy well, but I think the best thing we could
[3:13:50.780 --> 3:13:57.260]  do is get a Canadian lawyer and perhaps that lady lawyer California that's representing the convoy
[3:13:58.300 --> 3:14:03.900]  and if we get all the truckers independent and company drivers, which all of them could participate
[3:14:03.900 --> 3:14:09.580]  in what I'm talking about, all of us take the company, the country's advice and go home for 10
[3:14:09.580 --> 3:14:15.660]  days. The major cities will start ripping themselves apart in about three from lack of food.
[3:14:15.660 --> 3:14:23.180]  You'll be out in about five days and then we get a list of demands of whatever we want and
[3:14:23.180 --> 3:14:28.380]  kind of make the government pay for their dues. Well, that's right. People say, oh, don't do a
[3:14:28.380 --> 3:14:32.540]  siege. That's what the globalist did. But they did it saying take a digital ID to make us more
[3:14:32.540 --> 3:14:38.460]  slaved. If we have lockdowns done by the people to say no to Claus Schwab, no to the new world
[3:14:38.460 --> 3:14:45.420]  order, no to Bill Gates, we break their will. Absolutely, brother. Yep. And it'd be peaceful
[3:14:45.420 --> 3:14:49.980]  on the trucker's part because all we have to do is sit at home. All these liberals in these big
[3:14:49.980 --> 3:14:55.020]  cities, they've started to end their local government's apartment come down on DC up there and watch
[3:14:55.980 --> 3:15:00.780]  because they won't say it. I agree with you. And before they put the robots in charge of everything
[3:15:01.660 --> 3:15:05.980]  and the self driving cars, the rest of it, we've got to get our information in place
[3:15:05.980 --> 3:15:10.780]  so that we can exercise our power before we lose it. Thank you so much. That's the call, sir.
[3:15:10.780 --> 3:15:15.420]  That's why they're so scared of what's happening in Canada and around the world, because
[3:15:15.420 --> 3:15:19.820]  they want to teach us we have no power to stay in your house, starve to death, give us your
[3:15:19.820 --> 3:15:25.660]  children, but we're not going to do it. All right, folks, I'm about to hand the baton to the next
[3:15:25.660 --> 3:15:31.100]  great guest house, Kate Daly, Kate Daly show.com. She's about to take over. Please don't forget
[3:15:32.380 --> 3:15:37.100]  Sunday. I'm doing like a special six hour live show. And so much more. I want shoulders come up
[3:15:37.100 --> 3:15:42.940]  at 45 minutes info wars.com forward slash show. And the way we are beating the sensors
[3:15:43.980 --> 3:15:48.620]  and beating the globalist is your word of mouth. So don't call in thinking me.
[3:15:49.980 --> 3:15:53.420]  I want to thank you. You are everything. Stay with us.
[3:15:56.700 --> 3:16:02.140]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had
[3:16:02.140 --> 3:16:07.260]  brain fog. Like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job. And I heard Dr. Group on
[3:16:07.260 --> 3:16:11.660]  your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[3:16:11.660 --> 3:16:15.740]  And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that, you know,
[3:16:15.740 --> 3:16:20.140]  with a deeper source, you know, and I got really excited about that. So I took it. And man, in two
[3:16:20.140 --> 3:16:26.220]  weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could
[3:16:26.220 --> 3:16:31.340]  think again, I could connect with people again. And over the course of the next couple of years,
[3:16:31.340 --> 3:16:35.820]  I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all
[3:16:35.820 --> 3:16:40.300]  absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is knockout. It literally like if you
[3:16:40.300 --> 3:16:44.620]  want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway, so the point is, we have to get
[3:16:44.620 --> 3:16:48.860]  ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system. And the only way to do that
[3:16:48.860 --> 3:16:53.580]  is to take our own health into our own hands. Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much
[3:16:53.580 --> 3:17:00.700]  for your call at Godspeed. Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's
[3:17:00.700 --> 3:17:07.660]  really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain. And when it comes
[3:17:07.660 --> 3:17:15.260]  information, boys, that's true today. We see the entire global corrupt, anti-human depopulation,
[3:17:15.260 --> 3:17:21.740]  great reset combine, trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist
[3:17:21.740 --> 3:17:28.460]  nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and
[3:17:28.460 --> 3:17:34.700]  scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's
[3:17:34.700 --> 3:17:40.860]  going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it. And none of it can succeed. None
[3:17:40.860 --> 3:17:48.060]  of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit. That's why truth comes
[3:17:48.060 --> 3:17:51.900]  with hard work and with research and with diligence. And that's why it's hard to share
[3:17:51.900 --> 3:17:56.220]  in Full Wars links and band up video links. That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[3:17:56.220 --> 3:17:59.580]  Experience the next level in high-powered energy

[3:18:34.460 --> 3:18:40.700]  delivers an essential nutrient, Koli and Ginkoli, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant
[3:18:40.700 --> 3:18:45.260]  content. This product is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well,

[3:18:57.260 --> 3:19:03.500]  The powerful combination of both Vitamin C and Zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier
[3:19:03.500 --> 3:19:08.140]  life. InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a
[3:19:08.140 --> 3:19:14.140]  supplement that contains both. This InfoWars Life offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips
[3:19:14.140 --> 3:19:18.940]  should be your next purchase from the InfoWars Store. The Rose Hips contained within are a part
[3:19:18.940 --> 3:19:25.020]  of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds. Natural chemicals
[3:19:25.020 --> 3:19:29.900]  found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those
[3:19:29.900 --> 3:19:35.820]  with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown. As for Vitamin C and
[3:19:35.820 --> 3:19:40.860]  Zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune
[3:19:40.860 --> 3:19:45.820]  defense and the maintenance of your everyday health. It has been reported that intake of both
[3:19:45.820 --> 3:19:51.340]  is often inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit,
[3:19:51.340 --> 3:19:56.380]  be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise our Rose Hips don't lie.
[3:19:57.260 --> 3:20:03.260]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:03.260 --> 3:20:18.460]  Thank you, Alex. Alex is a good guy. I'm Kate Dally, your guest host and you can go to
[3:20:18.460 --> 3:20:22.220]  KateDallyRadio.com to stream my live show right after this, right after this hour.
[3:20:22.780 --> 3:20:27.500]  I'm happy to have you there. Before we get to our amazing guest, just a side note about
[3:20:27.500 --> 3:20:33.740]  a Ukraine-Russia situation. Everybody's talking about it, me too. I don't think it's World War
[3:20:33.740 --> 3:20:39.980]  III, as many are saying, and I don't think that will happen until our economy is flattened and
[3:20:39.980 --> 3:20:47.020]  until we are unarmed, quite frankly. And I also, obviously it's going to involve us, but I will
[3:20:47.020 --> 3:20:52.380]  be talking to Jill Scousen next week about this right here, and we'll have a great conversation
[3:20:52.380 --> 3:20:58.300]  about that in this hour. I actually think it'll end pretty quick, too. In this hour, I have an
[3:20:58.300 --> 3:21:03.180]  amazing guest. Her information blew me away so much that I had to have her here with me
[3:21:03.180 --> 3:21:08.380]  to speak to you, and I really want you to hear her. She's going to be talking about the shots,
[3:21:08.380 --> 3:21:12.700]  reproductive, what she's finding in the reproductive systems, what she's finding with
[3:21:12.700 --> 3:21:17.660]  possible sterilization, all of these types of things, and then also the massive cover-up on
[3:21:17.660 --> 3:21:23.100]  ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. She's got some mind-blowing information, and welcome to the show.
[3:21:23.100 --> 3:21:30.380]  Dr. Jansy Lindsay, how are you? Thank you so much, Kate. I'm great. Thanks. I'm glad to have you.
[3:21:30.380 --> 3:21:35.100]  She is a director of toxicology, molecular biology for toxicology. She holds a doctorate,
[3:21:35.100 --> 3:21:41.500]  a PhD in biochemistry, and molecular biology, Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. She has
[3:21:41.500 --> 3:21:48.860]  extensive experience in analyzing the molecular profile of pharmacologic responses as they pertain
[3:21:48.860 --> 3:21:54.140]  to the dose and response relationship. Her expertise centers on evaluating the complex
[3:21:54.140 --> 3:22:00.300]  dynamics of toxicity. You name it. She knows it. Very, very smart, smart lady. Dr. Lindsay,
[3:22:00.300 --> 3:22:05.660]  you blew me away on the information that you had. Will you please tell everyone what you've been
[3:22:05.660 --> 3:22:12.860]  finding on, and it's scary, on the reproductive nature of the people that will be taking these
[3:22:12.860 --> 3:22:19.340]  shots and getting these shots right now? Yeah, absolutely. First of all, just a little relevant
[3:22:19.340 --> 3:22:25.100]  background. Back in the 1990s, I participated in the development of a contraceptive vaccine. I was
[3:22:25.100 --> 3:22:29.820]  working as a research technician at Baylor College of Medicine, and I worked on the Zona
[3:22:29.820 --> 3:22:37.260]  Pollucida Immunocontraceptive Vaccine. So I'm well aware of the technology. I have worked on vaccine
[3:22:37.260 --> 3:22:45.100]  development myself, and I've since worked in a lot of animal models over the years to study
[3:22:45.100 --> 3:22:50.140]  various diseases and looked at different endpoints, including reproductive and pulmonary endpoints.
[3:22:51.180 --> 3:22:57.420]  So I have a bit to say about what's going on reproductively. I can tell you that a lot of
[3:22:57.420 --> 3:23:03.740]  it's being hidden. There is no way that pregnant women should be getting these shots at all.
[3:23:04.380 --> 3:23:09.100]  There's no way that anybody of reproductive age or future reproductive age should be getting these
[3:23:09.100 --> 3:23:19.180]  shots at all. I believe that the spike protein immunogen is going to act as a syncytin analog,
[3:23:19.820 --> 3:23:25.900]  and syncytins are proteins that are important in our reproductive systems. They regulate a lot of
[3:23:25.900 --> 3:23:31.180]  things. Syncytin 2 regulates immune tolerance to the fetus, so the mother doesn't attack the fetus.
[3:23:31.900 --> 3:23:37.500]  Syncytin 1 is important in placental development and trophoblast invasion. They're both important
[3:23:37.500 --> 3:23:44.540]  in the maintenance of pregnancy. The syncytins are important in fertilization, sperm to egg.
[3:23:44.540 --> 3:23:51.660]  They're fusion proteins, and they have similar conformation and amino acid sequence to the
[3:23:51.660 --> 3:23:58.300]  spike protein that they've chosen as the gene therapy immunogen. Immunocontroceptives don't
[3:23:58.300 --> 3:24:05.020]  always work right away. In fact, many of them take several boosts in order to induce sterility.
[3:24:05.020 --> 3:24:10.780]  So papers coming out now in the beginning saying that if you had one dose or two doses,
[3:24:10.780 --> 3:24:16.220]  and they don't really see much of a reproductive endpoint in some of these studies they've done,
[3:24:16.220 --> 3:24:23.100]  does not guarantee that they are not acting in an additive fashion over time, that they won't
[3:24:23.100 --> 3:24:28.540]  induce sterility, or that there isn't a difference between younger people and older people. In fact,
[3:24:28.540 --> 3:24:32.620]  we've seen with different immunocontroceptive vaccines that if you immunize someone before
[3:24:32.620 --> 3:24:40.060]  they've reached fertility, that can sterilize them while if somebody's already reached ovulation age,
[3:24:40.060 --> 3:24:48.460]  it takes a few boosts to sterilize them. So we just need to keep that in mind, that the game
[3:24:48.460 --> 3:24:56.460]  is not over here in terms of assessing their effect on reproduction. And I don't know if you
[3:24:56.460 --> 3:25:05.900]  want me to go through the numbers, Kate, as we are now. Sure, because I think it's, we all know
[3:25:05.900 --> 3:25:11.820]  that these are eugenics. We all know that we all know their game plan. And I think this needs to
[3:25:11.820 --> 3:25:16.940]  sink in for the American people is that we may have a lot of people trying to get pregnant that
[3:25:16.940 --> 3:25:22.300]  won't be able to. You're starting to see very, very scary things in the lab and have shared those
[3:25:22.300 --> 3:25:26.140]  things because you're trying to go around and speak and talk about all these things to people
[3:25:26.140 --> 3:25:31.980]  and saying, stop doing this to your kids and stop doing these to the young adults. In the FDA
[3:25:31.980 --> 3:25:37.580]  document, which we were talking about a year ago, I'm saying the FDA.gov document on Pfizer,
[3:25:37.580 --> 3:25:42.460]  it said if you want to plan a family, if you want to start a family, do not take this shot.
[3:25:42.460 --> 3:25:47.500]  No one reads the pamphlet when they're getting that shot, I guarantee you. They don't read through
[3:25:47.500 --> 3:25:53.580]  the fine print. Yes, let's have the numbers, Dr. Lindsey. Yeah, so I think some really important
[3:25:53.580 --> 3:25:58.620]  numbers come from the DMED database. This is the Defense Medical Epidemiology database,
[3:25:58.620 --> 3:26:03.020]  and it is extremely reliable, despite the fact that they said they got their numbers wrong for
[3:26:03.020 --> 3:26:10.220]  five years before the latest numbers came out. They have seen a 437 percent increase in ovarian
[3:26:10.220 --> 3:26:17.660]  dysfunction since the shots came out, a 393 percent increase in infertility diagnoses in males,
[3:26:17.660 --> 3:26:26.620]  a 577 percent increase in infertility diagnosis in females, 174 percent increase in congenital
[3:26:26.620 --> 3:26:34.780]  malformations birth defects, 352 percent increase in abnormal menses, and an 85 percent increase
[3:26:34.780 --> 3:26:48.140]  in spontaneous abortion. In the VAERS database, we have now 23,958 reports of menstrual disorders.
[3:26:48.140 --> 3:26:58.940]  We have 4,080 miscarriage, 8,936 vaginal and uterine hemorrhage, 470 cesarean preterm labor
[3:26:58.940 --> 3:27:05.260]  birth difficulties, 115 still births, and we have to remember that the VAERS database is only
[3:27:05.260 --> 3:27:09.820]  estimated to hold less than 1 percent of all adverse effects and deaths, and we have an
[3:27:09.820 --> 3:27:16.700]  additional 11 databases that are being reported into, at this time, that hold vaccine adverse
[3:27:16.700 --> 3:27:24.380]  reactions in deaths so we expect it to be much smaller as well. This is devastating. I don't
[3:27:24.380 --> 3:27:31.580]  know how to get closer people. Right, because this is 1 percent, so everybody needs to calculate
[3:27:31.580 --> 3:27:37.180]  that, and I know everyone in this audience knows that. VAERS is 1 percent, and they shut down the
[3:27:37.180 --> 3:27:43.580]  swine flu shot over 50 deaths. Look at all of the things that are happening. I know everybody here
[3:27:43.580 --> 3:27:48.060]  is aware that the military came out with all of their numbers and increased cancer. You're talking
[3:27:48.060 --> 3:27:53.580]  about all the numbers with miscarriages and all kinds of things that are going on. You can't
[3:27:53.580 --> 3:28:00.700]  ignore this. Even with the VAERS numbers at 1 percent, you cannot ignore this. It blows my mind
[3:28:00.700 --> 3:28:06.940]  that their sidestepping this media robots won't talk about it, won't say a word about it. That
[3:28:06.940 --> 3:28:11.900]  doesn't shock me because they've sold out a long time ago, but I love that you're telling people
[3:28:11.900 --> 3:28:19.660]  this because people need to be very aware. We don't have a pandemic. A pandemic is when
[3:28:19.660 --> 3:28:24.780]  people die all around you. We have people dying in ICUs. That is not a pandemic,
[3:28:24.780 --> 3:28:31.020]  and people are going in for this shot even though the rate of having a sniffle is 99.8 percent.
[3:28:31.020 --> 3:28:34.780]  They're running in for these shots, and they don't realize they might be sterilizing their
[3:28:34.780 --> 3:28:40.940]  children for life. We'll be right back with Dr. Jancey Lindsay. She's got some more amazing
[3:28:40.940 --> 3:28:45.260]  information you need to hear about what they were finding with women that donate eggs,
[3:28:45.260 --> 3:28:49.660]  all kinds of things. I want to talk to you about and the massive cover-up with Ivor Mekton, so we'll
[3:28:49.660 --> 3:29:02.700]  be right back. The globalist social insiders always intended to push their COVID biomedical
[3:29:02.700 --> 3:29:10.220]  tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for
[3:29:10.220 --> 3:29:16.540]  permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[3:29:16.540 --> 3:29:21.660]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[3:29:21.660 --> 3:29:27.420]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[3:29:27.420 --> 3:29:33.900]  that it is a world government corporate takeover, and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[3:29:33.900 --> 3:29:39.180]  than ever. The problem is some globalist-controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover,
[3:29:39.180 --> 3:29:45.180]  like Canada where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario
[3:29:45.180 --> 3:29:50.060]  and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia. So pray for these folks big time.
[3:29:50.060 --> 3:29:55.500]  It's a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely bare
[3:29:55.500 --> 3:30:02.860]  amount. The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a

[3:30:30.540 --> 3:30:36.060]  arthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown. As for vitamin C and zinc
[3:30:36.060 --> 3:30:41.420]  themselves you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition immune defense
[3:30:41.420 --> 3:30:46.220]  and the maintenance of your everyday health. It has been reported that intake of both is often
[3:30:46.220 --> 3:30:51.660]  inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit be sure to

[3:33:16.380 --> 3:33:20.620]  you tuning in right now because this is such important information I really am we need to share
[3:33:20.620 --> 3:33:26.700]  this you people need to know what they're messing with in the reproductive side of things I have
[3:33:26.700 --> 3:33:32.940]  Dr. Jancy Lindsay on with me yeah Dr. Lindsay what what were people finding or what were you finding
[3:33:32.940 --> 3:33:37.660]  when you were realizing women were trying to go and donate eggs as they had in the past what was
[3:33:37.660 --> 3:33:47.100]  happening after they received their series of of crap shots. Hi Kate you're referring to a
[3:33:47.100 --> 3:33:51.980]  whistleblower at an IVF clinic came forward after I spoke to the CDC about my concerns
[3:33:51.980 --> 3:33:58.140]  she told me early on that they were seeing very different results and in her IVF lab
[3:33:59.020 --> 3:34:05.500]  with some of the embryos are resting in development at about day five these were
[3:34:05.500 --> 3:34:13.500]  these were from donors they were previously healthy matched donors and they had had successful
[3:34:13.500 --> 3:34:20.860]  successful embryogenesis before with these donors and they for some reason after they
[3:34:20.860 --> 3:34:27.180]  received their vaccines the embryos were resting early on and this was something that she was very
[3:34:27.180 --> 3:34:35.180]  alarmed with yeah wow. Kate when somebody takes one shot versus all of the boosters I feel the
[3:34:35.180 --> 3:34:39.660]  booster is a drip system I want to know how you feel about that and is it making it worse and
[3:34:39.660 --> 3:34:45.980]  worse and worse I remember the the doctor that studied animals and said he came up with a sterilization
[3:34:45.980 --> 3:34:50.380]  shot not just a contraception shot but a sterilization shot but it was done in a series of
[3:34:50.380 --> 3:34:54.620]  shots they had to have a series of shots that had a certain amount of time between them in order
[3:34:54.620 --> 3:34:59.900]  to sterilize the animals he died mysteriously in the summer of 2019 right before 2020 hit
[3:35:00.780 --> 3:35:07.020]  murdered I think but but I would like to get your take on that as far as all of the shots versus
[3:35:07.020 --> 3:35:10.700]  one shot let's say somebody got one shot and they went oh I'm not taking anything else
[3:35:10.700 --> 3:35:18.140]  do you have any information on that? Yeah so so as I said I worked on the zonopolucid vaccine which
[3:35:18.140 --> 3:35:23.980]  was the probably the the vaccine that you're speaking of at Baylor College of Medicine
[3:35:23.980 --> 3:35:30.940]  it's an immunocontraceptive vaccine and for several species it takes several shots to induce
[3:35:30.940 --> 3:35:35.980]  sterility in the animals it's an additive effect we see the same thing with the HCG
[3:35:35.980 --> 3:35:43.260]  immunocontraceptive vaccine you need several boosters in Africa when HCG was mixed into the
[3:35:43.260 --> 3:35:49.340]  tetanus shots in order to sterilize that population or do an experiment in the population I'm not
[3:35:49.340 --> 3:35:56.380]  sure what they were doing it was just there intentionally clearly it took several boosters
[3:35:56.380 --> 3:36:04.780]  to induce sterility in that population so we don't expect it to be all at once but it but it
[3:36:04.780 --> 3:36:10.140]  might be for kids because you get a differential response in kids with a zonopolucid vaccine
[3:36:10.140 --> 3:36:15.260]  when we saw in animal models is that you get a complete ovarian destruction following we were
[3:36:15.260 --> 3:36:20.460]  developing it to be a temporary immune contraceptive and it would have been really attractive is that
[3:36:20.460 --> 3:36:27.020]  because it would have prevented fertilization rather than preventing implantation like like a
[3:36:27.020 --> 3:36:34.540]  lot of contraceptives do. So it stops early on it stops it early on before the fertilization
[3:36:34.540 --> 3:36:39.740]  and that's what's a little different here? Yeah so we may be talking about the same
[3:36:39.740 --> 3:36:44.940]  vaccine if he was working on the porcelain zonopolucid vaccine which is used now that's
[3:36:44.940 --> 3:36:53.340]  interesting I feel like I've come first full circle after all these years it's so true quite
[3:36:53.340 --> 3:36:59.420]  interesting. You know women were coming in and having more problems donating eggs and things
[3:36:59.420 --> 3:37:05.900]  like this the spike protein we know settles in a few various organs right um you have myocarditis
[3:37:05.900 --> 3:37:13.740]  you have ovarian things going on and so mainly I think people don't realize is the spike protein
[3:37:13.740 --> 3:37:18.860]  is not natural and the spike protein I think can be transferred because Pfizer admits it called
[3:37:18.860 --> 3:37:24.620]  occupational transference section 8.3 in the documents that they had to release they wanted
[3:37:24.620 --> 3:37:30.700]  75 years but they had to release them and so what you're saying is is this is this is congregating
[3:37:30.700 --> 3:37:37.820]  in uh the reproductive areas and nobody's really talking about this I haven't heard I've heard you
[3:37:37.820 --> 3:37:41.820]  and I've heard a couple of doctors talking about this and you're blowing the whistle on it which
[3:37:41.820 --> 3:37:48.300]  I so appreciate from you what a smart woman you are in doing this because we have a severe severe
[3:37:48.300 --> 3:37:54.460]  eugenics issue going on underneath the myocarditis underneath the stroke underneath all of the death
[3:37:54.460 --> 3:38:00.060]  I mean if that wasn't bad enough we really truly are proving the case for eugenics right now I mean
[3:38:00.060 --> 3:38:04.700]  if this is the case if we're going to see uh kids 10 years from now trying to get pregnant
[3:38:04.700 --> 3:38:11.420]  in their in their 20s or 30s and can't it just blows my mind that's my fear yeah that's my real
[3:38:11.420 --> 3:38:18.700]  fear Kate and parents are going into this just really uh blind and they're also being told by
[3:38:18.700 --> 3:38:23.580]  people that frankly you should know better they do not have the data on pregnancy and long-term
[3:38:23.580 --> 3:38:30.780]  outcome come they do not have the data on teratogenicity and carcinogenicity and shame on these doctors
[3:38:30.780 --> 3:38:37.500]  these physicians these health boards for telling people that they do because they don't um I I
[3:38:37.500 --> 3:38:42.540]  don't know what else to tell parents besides please don't give your kids these shots they don't need
[3:38:42.540 --> 3:38:47.820]  them they're an exceeding they have more of a chance of suffocating or drowning than they do
[3:38:47.820 --> 3:38:54.620]  dying from this virus there is absolutely zero reason to give your kids this vaccine uh myocarditis
[3:38:54.620 --> 3:39:01.100]  cases are exploding in children and in just four months 69 we've had a 69 percent increase in cases
[3:39:01.100 --> 3:39:08.860]  we've gone from 10 000 something in october to 32 000 something uh as of february 11 and we know
[3:39:08.860 --> 3:39:15.260]  that the main target population for myocarditis is our young kids teenagers and young adults
[3:39:15.260 --> 3:39:21.100]  12 to 20 is the prime group of course we don't know in the five to 11 year olds because we don't
[3:39:21.980 --> 3:39:27.180]  have reporting on those cases yet and we absolutely know as you've heard that the cdc is
[3:39:27.180 --> 3:39:32.540]  withholding cases so there it is it's impossible for us to know the real numbers and if they're
[3:39:32.540 --> 3:39:38.220]  withholding cases folks if the fda and the cdc is messing around and they're corrupted and we
[3:39:38.220 --> 3:39:43.340]  can't trust their data do not trust your child or yourself with this vaccine it is not a vaccine
[3:39:43.340 --> 3:39:50.780]  it's a gene therapy and it will hurt you don't do it absolutely and when they keep saying safe
[3:39:50.780 --> 3:39:56.140]  and effective i want to i want to cram safe and effective down their throats um because everything
[3:39:56.140 --> 3:40:00.060]  is safe and effective how can you say that when it's been on the market for a nanosecond and
[3:40:00.060 --> 3:40:05.340]  everyone knows it it's amazing to me that they could get away with that uh i'm sure i'm sure
[3:40:05.340 --> 3:40:09.500]  just shocks you every day when a doctor stands there like a robot and says it's safe and effective
[3:40:09.500 --> 3:40:15.820]  it's safe and effective bizarre right yeah those are talking points the data shows us that it's not
[3:40:15.820 --> 3:40:24.060]  safe and it's not effective um i i think i said rotavirus vaccine was pulled after 10 cases
[3:40:24.060 --> 3:40:31.020]  in 1999 by sophia ventis the cdc looked into it after 10 cases of bowel obstruction uh they were
[3:40:31.020 --> 3:40:37.180]  doing all kinds of studies and by 15 cases kate they had pulled that vaccine and were no longer
[3:40:37.180 --> 3:40:42.780]  recommending it on the childhood schedule now we have hundreds of deaths and kids and nobody's doing
[3:40:42.780 --> 3:40:48.620]  anything uh athletes healthy athletes are dropping dead and nobody's doing anything it's just another
[3:40:48.620 --> 3:40:54.780]  walk in the park oh kids have heart attacks too kids have strokes too come on folks uh be smarter
[3:40:54.780 --> 3:41:04.140]  than that uh i know it blows my i saw an ad that said uh i saw an ad that said if you uh chew gum
[3:41:04.140 --> 3:41:10.140]  with gmo uh you can get rid of of covid i'm not joking it's getting to the point where it's just a
[3:41:10.140 --> 3:41:14.860]  comic strip every day and i hope people are seeing through it i think a lot of people are waking up
[3:41:14.860 --> 3:41:20.380]  in your industry for what you do for a living because you're on top of all of this i i i hope
[3:41:20.380 --> 3:41:25.740]  you guys took in her bio because man she knows what she's talking about um pushback because i know
[3:41:25.740 --> 3:41:31.180]  that the i know that most doctors are kind of told you follow the you follow the line we give you
[3:41:31.180 --> 3:41:37.020]  you're getting a lot of pushback dr lindsay so i have a little bit of a different practice i
[3:41:37.020 --> 3:41:44.540]  make consulting toxicologist and litigation i do chemical exposure cases um some medical mouths
[3:41:44.540 --> 3:41:53.900]  some um mist pill overdose cases uh toxicity of different chemicals uh toxicity of different
[3:41:53.900 --> 3:41:59.980]  formulas and uh whether or not certain chemicals in certain formulas cause cancer or not in
[3:41:59.980 --> 3:42:06.060]  reproductive organs and other organs so i deal primarily in the litigation industry and in the
[3:42:06.060 --> 3:42:13.100]  insurance industry and i have had a couple clients that have uh said that quote my political views
[3:42:14.220 --> 3:42:18.860]  were not something that they wanted to be expressed which i found extremely interesting
[3:42:18.860 --> 3:42:30.940]  since my toxicological views have nothing to do with my political views uh amen i voted both parties
[3:42:30.940 --> 3:42:35.580]  talk about iver mekton when we come when we come right back uh but there's just so much to say on

[3:47:12.140 --> 3:47:17.580]  hi we're back i'm kate dally your guest host go to kate dally radio dot com to stream my show live
[3:47:17.580 --> 3:47:23.420]  for three hours right after this i'm on the dial all over the nation and i also my guests that you
[3:47:23.420 --> 3:47:28.940]  know right now is dr jancy lindsay and she's amazing very very smart woman her information
[3:47:28.940 --> 3:47:34.460]  blew me away on fertility what they're finding after people are taking these shots and the problems
[3:47:34.460 --> 3:47:40.140]  that they're having with fertility and so i had a guest a dr lindsay whose husband died of a heart
[3:47:40.140 --> 3:47:47.100]  attack four days after the shot uh the third shot he got the third shot and uh the hospital said it
[3:47:47.100 --> 3:47:52.700]  was a normal heart attack well she had an independent autopsy done and the pathologist said that he had
[3:47:52.700 --> 3:47:59.180]  never seen that kind of heart damage before in his 25 year career and that he was seeing this
[3:47:59.180 --> 3:48:06.140]  only since these shots and so i don't think we realized to the degree of the kind of damage
[3:48:06.140 --> 3:48:11.420]  it looks very very different than even what people would think would a normal heart attack versus a
[3:48:11.420 --> 3:48:16.380]  heart attack after these shots and what it's doing to our system i'm sure we just don't realize
[3:48:16.380 --> 3:48:24.700]  uh no we don't but if you go back to the early coronavirus research that was done in the 40s
[3:48:25.260 --> 3:48:32.060]  in the 60s even it was found early on interestingly this is a fun tidbit coronavirus the coronavirus
[3:48:32.060 --> 3:48:38.060]  most closely related to coronavirus now was found as a contaminant of trepanema pallidum
[3:48:38.060 --> 3:48:43.980]  which is the causative agent of syphilis in the john hopkins nickel strain of syphilis
[3:48:43.980 --> 3:48:49.420]  that was being shipped around the world to study the disease it was only found in the john hopkins
[3:48:49.420 --> 3:48:54.780]  strains and john hopkins had been manipulating coronaviruses for some time they had investigated
[3:48:54.780 --> 3:49:00.220]  the murion encephalitis coronavirus they had investigated the feline uh peritoneal
[3:49:01.420 --> 3:49:10.380]  coronavirus and i i find it interesting that it was only in their strain of syphilis that this
[3:49:10.380 --> 3:49:17.660]  coronavirus that's causative of heart damage and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis was found in fact
[3:49:17.660 --> 3:49:23.420]  ralph barrick at the university of north carolina picked up this propensity for coronavirus this
[3:49:23.420 --> 3:49:31.100]  particular coronavirus to cause heart damage and proposed to use it to infect animals purposefully
[3:49:31.100 --> 3:49:37.260]  in order to study cardiomyopathy and myocarditis and he published a paper on that in 1992 anybody
[3:49:37.260 --> 3:49:44.140]  can look it up so it's no surprise that these shots cause heart damage uh and cardiomyopathy
[3:49:44.140 --> 3:49:51.260]  because they've been known to do so uh since at least the 60s so um people should know that uh
[3:49:52.380 --> 3:50:01.900]  go ahead wash i i'm just shocked uh let's talk uh i i i what what are we doing to our society and
[3:50:01.900 --> 3:50:05.420]  what are we going to see in about another year to two years you know the insurance companies
[3:50:05.420 --> 3:50:11.020]  are buying reinsurance policies because they're expecting a windfall of death over the next year
[3:50:11.020 --> 3:50:16.060]  year to two years cancers are going through the roof i'm sure you're seeing this and i am i was
[3:50:16.060 --> 3:50:21.980]  just blown away they're expecting something of a 40 jump in deaths uh which is huge they maybe
[3:50:21.980 --> 3:50:28.620]  at every one in 200 year occurrence so it's getting it's getting crazy yeah we just have to stop these
[3:50:28.620 --> 3:50:32.700]  shots i mean that's that's the thing we don't need them and we get bound up and all this the
[3:50:32.700 --> 3:50:38.940]  efficacy the safety of the shots we don't need them we've never needed them ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
[3:50:38.940 --> 3:50:45.100]  work wonderfully which is a good kind of segue um into what i had talked to you about uh with
[3:50:45.100 --> 3:50:51.900]  regards to the mississippi state health officer dr thomas dobbs covering up the efficacy of ivermectin
[3:50:51.900 --> 3:50:58.620]  and hydroxychloroquine in his state uh when doctors brought it to him and were very excited about
[3:50:58.620 --> 3:51:05.260]  their trials in a 1500 patient cohort where they had zero deaths and only six percent hospitalization
[3:51:05.260 --> 3:51:11.100]  which was fantastic compared to the rates that everybody else was having very excited they go
[3:51:11.100 --> 3:51:16.300]  to him they say oh we need to publish this we need to write a paper and get a peer reviewed
[3:51:16.860 --> 3:51:24.140]  and he absolutely quashes it he wants to bury it he says don't call hdq ivermectin by the way
[3:51:24.140 --> 3:51:31.500]  all this was found out through a foyer request that was undertaken by dr carole hill in objen
[3:51:31.500 --> 3:51:38.860]  who's now retired but she uh through asked for emails that had anything to do with hydroxychloroquine
[3:51:38.860 --> 3:51:45.340]  ivermectin and dr thomas dobbs the mississippi state health officer and uh she got a collection
[3:51:45.340 --> 3:51:53.900]  of emails back which indicate that in uh in july of 2020 he seemed to be partially okay with
[3:51:53.900 --> 3:52:00.300]  with hearing some information on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine ivermectin but by september
[3:52:00.300 --> 3:52:06.700]  of 2021 he was actively trying to bury the wonderful results that a group of doctors in
[3:52:06.700 --> 3:52:11.500]  his states had that were trying to publish in a journal and get this out to doctors so that
[3:52:11.500 --> 3:52:17.980]  they could treat patients in my mind this is just as good as killing patients when you cover up
[3:52:17.980 --> 3:52:24.060]  up good results and you try to bury it he said don't call hdq ivermectin antivirals
[3:52:26.300 --> 3:52:27.500]  acknowledged to say that
[3:52:31.020 --> 3:52:37.340]  trials now at this point there were already over 65 trials that showed that ivermectin
[3:52:37.340 --> 3:52:44.380]  was useful including peter quarry's large study he said acknowledge that it's impossible to discern
[3:52:44.380 --> 3:52:51.180]  the impact of any drug given the multiple drugs used again not true they were extremely successful
[3:52:51.180 --> 3:52:56.780]  using hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in this population some of the poorest populations in
[3:52:56.780 --> 3:53:02.380]  mississippi who historically hadn't had great compliance with medications were doing wonderfully
[3:53:02.380 --> 3:53:09.180]  in an outpatient environment uh getting these prescriptions and he said state that the observational
[3:53:09.180 --> 3:53:15.020]  trials are biased and rcts would be needed to validate any findings and then he says just a
[3:53:15.020 --> 3:53:21.580]  beginning uh you know i i really feel badly for these doctors among them the past president of
[3:53:21.580 --> 3:53:26.300]  the mississippi state medical association dr michael mansour who tried to bring this to dr
[3:53:26.300 --> 3:53:32.380]  dobbs and get this published so that they could help patients in their state uh it's it's pretty
[3:53:32.380 --> 3:53:39.980]  alarming to me absolutely i can't believe they can say hydroxychloroquine isn't antiviral and
[3:53:39.980 --> 3:53:45.180]  also we know that ivermectin kills even cancer cells i mean this is this information has been out
[3:53:45.180 --> 3:53:52.620]  by by the nih they've they've done their own studies for pete sakes so why the why why how
[3:53:52.620 --> 3:53:58.940]  are they doing this how are they doing this major lockout of ivermectin with all of the world
[3:53:58.940 --> 3:54:03.660]  studies i mean obviously about we everybody knows the you know novel peace prize all of these things
[3:54:03.660 --> 3:54:09.820]  how are they doing this how can you go after them they obviously have talking points and they're
[3:54:09.820 --> 3:54:15.020]  obviously making a lot of money we also had a discussion with chief medical officer of the
[3:54:15.020 --> 3:54:23.020]  singing uh mississippi singing river health system dr michael roth uh trying to convince him uh
[3:54:23.020 --> 3:54:33.900]  dr michella uh dr amerlin um dr brett barker and i um uh c uh c rna from their hospital reached out
[3:54:33.900 --> 3:54:39.740]  to me after seeing some posts on linkedin that i had post uh asking me to speak to his department
[3:54:39.740 --> 3:54:44.780]  they were having alarming numbers of deaths in the hospital system nothing was working and he said
[3:54:44.780 --> 3:54:51.580]  please talk to the cmo and please talk to these pulmonologists in my department and tell them that
[3:54:51.580 --> 3:54:57.580]  ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are working with with your doctors and see if we can adopt a protocol
[3:54:57.580 --> 3:55:04.540]  and and other medicines there there are also many medicines um that are permitted on the um on the
[3:55:04.540 --> 3:55:11.980]  macula protocol uh so we did uh he seemed very receptive to making that change and initiating
[3:55:11.980 --> 3:55:20.060]  some new treatments unfortunately nothing happened after that um i wonder if people
[3:55:20.060 --> 3:55:26.940]  sue i wonder if people can sue for them just ignoring the information suppressing the information
[3:55:26.940 --> 3:55:34.700]  i mean this is a cover-up this is a massive cover-up yeah it is and it's killing patients this isn't
[3:55:34.700 --> 3:55:39.820]  an abstract oh they just decided not to use it it's actively killing patients when you know when
[3:55:39.820 --> 3:55:45.580]  you have doctors telling you i've treated thousands of patients and i haven't lost a single patient
[3:55:45.580 --> 3:55:51.820]  by using this protocol none of my patients have ended up in the icu and you choose to do something
[3:55:51.820 --> 3:55:57.100]  where you know the patients on that other protocols such as remdesivir or these other medications
[3:55:57.100 --> 3:56:03.260]  are dying at alarming percentages you know 20 some percent in the hospital if you go on remdesivir
[3:56:03.260 --> 3:56:08.460]  and you choose to give your patients that protocol instead of the one that you know is working
[3:56:08.460 --> 3:56:13.980]  you're you're killing patients who are actively participating in killing patients and that is not
[3:56:13.980 --> 3:56:21.820]  the job of a physician amen amen i i was blown away because there's there's emails there's
[3:56:21.820 --> 3:56:26.620]  there's information on this with all of these doctors going and they take in the information
[3:56:26.620 --> 3:56:32.460]  and do nothing and uh still pimp out their remdesivir remdesivir uh failed the trials has
[3:56:32.460 --> 3:56:36.700]  been on the market for about a blip but it's safe and effective but this one that's been around for
[3:56:36.700 --> 3:56:42.300]  30 years worldwide is not safe and effective absolutely a cover-up and i really do hope
[3:56:42.300 --> 3:56:51.100]  people start suing don't you absolutely ivermectin has over 24 different mechanisms of action
[3:56:51.100 --> 3:56:57.260]  as an antiviral and so for someone to say that it is not an antiviral furthermore it was noted by
[3:56:57.260 --> 3:57:05.180]  eco health alliance as was hydroxychloroquine and inf gamma in the NIH is being effective
[3:57:05.180 --> 3:57:13.500]  towards the SARS family of viruses so this this false narrative that it that it doesn't work
[3:57:13.500 --> 3:57:19.740]  um it's only out there to kill people i i i don't know how to say it any different than that
[3:57:21.740 --> 3:57:26.780]  well i so appreciate you dr jancey lindsay thank you for joining me i great information i
[3:57:26.780 --> 3:57:31.500]  really do hope people share this share it widely you've been speaking out and i really appreciate
