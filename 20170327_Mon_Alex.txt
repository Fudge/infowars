[00:00.000 --> 00:18.160]  The world is a dangerous place not because of evil, but because of those who look on
[00:18.160 --> 00:20.440]  and do nothing.
[00:20.440 --> 00:24.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:24.800 --> 00:30.840]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.840 --> 00:39.560]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight on this Monday, 27th of March, 2017.
[00:39.560 --> 00:47.040]  So a lot of news today about what is happening within the cities and a developing civil
[00:47.040 --> 00:48.040]  war.
[00:48.040 --> 00:52.000]  And as I've been talking about Uber a little bit yesterday and the revelations that we
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.640]  got over the weekend, it wasn't just simply that one accident in Tempe, Arizona, what
[00:55.640 --> 01:01.240]  we learned was that these Uber cars cannot drive more than a mile.
[01:01.240 --> 01:06.960]  It's less like 0.8 miles, okay, three quarters of a mile before a human has to intervene.
[01:06.960 --> 01:11.120]  So when they talk about the car not really being at fault, you know, you have the whole
[01:11.120 --> 01:16.640]  issue of defensive driving and that sort of thing, but there's a much larger issue beyond
[01:16.640 --> 01:18.960]  just the fact of whether or not these cars can work.
[01:18.960 --> 01:22.640]  And of course, they'll get the bugs ironed out of them eventually.
[01:22.640 --> 01:25.200]  What my concern is, is that they're not really going to work, especially if they want to
[01:25.200 --> 01:26.400]  talk about autopilot.
[01:26.400 --> 01:30.880]  That is never going to work unless they get all the human drivers off of the road, because
[01:30.880 --> 01:36.480]  only if these things are working in a little control grid where the central computer controls
[01:36.480 --> 01:38.160]  everything, will it work.
[01:38.160 --> 01:43.520]  And that's the problem, the centralization of control of our transportation.
[01:43.520 --> 01:47.120]  So we look at this story that's on the Dredge Report today, thousands of Americans are
[01:47.120 --> 01:48.520]  fleeing the big cities.
[01:48.520 --> 01:53.520]  And the bigger context of this whole self-driving issue is Agenda 21.
[01:53.520 --> 01:57.760]  And all the motivation of people wanting to get out, of course, it's always a better lifestyle
[01:57.760 --> 01:58.760]  there.
[01:58.760 --> 02:00.840]  This has always been something people have strived for.
[02:00.840 --> 02:05.400]  We've had Thomas Jefferson talk about how big cities in his time were a threat to the
[02:05.400 --> 02:08.040]  health, the wealth, and the liberty of mankind.
[02:08.040 --> 02:09.360]  And of course, it's no different now.
[02:09.360 --> 02:11.040]  It does threaten your health and your money.
[02:11.040 --> 02:12.920]  It's expensive to live there.
[02:12.920 --> 02:16.440]  And it takes away your liberty to live there as well, to be packed like sardines.
[02:16.440 --> 02:18.640]  But they want us packed like sardines.
[02:18.640 --> 02:22.960]  So we look at these self-driving car companies, these robo-taxi companies, whether it's Uber,
[02:22.960 --> 02:28.680]  whether it's Lyft, the Lyft CEO, that a very long blog post where he was talking about
[02:28.680 --> 02:29.680]  where this is all headed.
[02:29.680 --> 02:32.320]  And of course, the guy was an urban planner.
[02:32.320 --> 02:36.480]  Urban planners don't like cars, because cars can take you out of their domain.
[02:36.480 --> 02:39.920]  They want to keep you confined in their cities.
[02:39.920 --> 02:43.960]  And that's why the government picks those kinds of people to plan our cities.
[02:43.960 --> 02:46.400]  They want to confine you into the cities.
[02:46.400 --> 02:48.600]  That's the UN Agenda Agenda 21.
[02:48.600 --> 02:53.480]  They've renamed it, expanded it, given it a more specific date, and called it the UN
[02:53.480 --> 02:55.800]  2030 Agenda for Sustainability.
[02:55.800 --> 02:58.960]  That's now what UN Agenda 21 is operating under.
[02:58.960 --> 03:02.600]  So now they're now pushing, they've got a more certain date that they're pushing for.
[03:02.600 --> 03:06.680]  This has always been kind of fuzzy, 2020, 2025, 2030.
[03:06.680 --> 03:09.440]  Now they're saying, 2030, we're going to have it there.
[03:09.440 --> 03:10.440]  So we see that happening.
[03:10.440 --> 03:14.040]  And at the same time, we have this other article at Infowars.com.
[03:14.040 --> 03:18.560]  British Special Forces are now going to be deploying to the streets of London permanently.
[03:18.560 --> 03:19.560]  Permanently.
[03:19.560 --> 03:21.960]  They're not going to get off of there, okay?
[03:21.960 --> 03:26.720]  And as they put on the subtitle here on our site, the police state continues to expand
[03:26.720 --> 03:29.280]  through a problem reaction solution.
[03:29.280 --> 03:32.000]  See, they created the problem.
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.360]  They created the problem of mass migration, creating a civil war within our borders.
[03:37.360 --> 03:41.000]  And of course, that's the rest of the stories that we're looking at.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.400]  That's the whole ball of whack.
[03:42.400 --> 03:50.400]  So we look at the globalism from the top, and we see TPP, we see the transatlantic partnership
[03:50.400 --> 03:51.920]  as well as the trans-pacific partnership.
[03:51.920 --> 03:54.760]  We understand that, I think, now because of Donald Trump.
[03:54.760 --> 03:55.960]  He made that very clear to people.
[03:55.960 --> 03:56.960]  He shut that down.
[03:56.960 --> 04:01.680]  But there's another struggle that is going on within our country that is a political
[04:01.680 --> 04:03.440]  struggle for power.
[04:03.440 --> 04:07.480]  And it is a struggle of demographics that they have created.
[04:07.480 --> 04:10.920]  And so when you look at what's happening here in London, this is a demographic problem
[04:10.920 --> 04:11.920]  that they created.
[04:11.920 --> 04:16.680]  And numbers that could not be assimilated, a massive number of people who did not want
[04:16.680 --> 04:17.680]  to be assimilated.
[04:17.680 --> 04:19.400]  They wanted to remain separate.
[04:19.400 --> 04:21.720]  They self-ghettoized under these areas.
[04:21.720 --> 04:25.320]  And it's going to be the second generation that is going to be more dangerous because
[04:25.320 --> 04:29.240]  they're going to be very resentful of the fact that they see their living in a different
[04:29.240 --> 04:31.840]  standard of living than the rest of the people around them.
[04:31.840 --> 04:33.440]  They don't remember where this came from.
[04:33.440 --> 04:34.920]  Yeah, there's going to be a civil war.
[04:34.920 --> 04:37.800]  We're going to break down these articles, but that's really kind of the nexus of what's
[04:37.800 --> 04:38.800]  going on.
[04:38.800 --> 04:43.480]  We're going to talk about the failure to repeal Obamacare.
[04:43.480 --> 04:44.480]  What does that mean?
[04:44.480 --> 04:45.480]  Where did that come from?
[04:45.480 --> 04:46.480]  And where do we go next?
[04:46.480 --> 04:47.480]  We'll also take your calls.
[04:47.480 --> 04:48.480]  I want to get your opinions on it.
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.520]  But in the next segment, we're going to have, sorry, at the bottom of the hour, Alex Jones
[04:52.520 --> 04:54.200]  is going to be joining us with a report.
[04:54.200 --> 04:55.200]  Stay with us.
[04:55.200 --> 05:25.040]  We'll see you in the next segment.
[05:25.040 --> 05:51.440]  We'll see you in the next segment.
[05:51.440 --> 06:21.320]  We'll see you in the next segment.
[06:21.320 --> 06:51.160]  We'll see you in the next segment.
[06:51.160 --> 07:16.560]  We'll see you in the next segment.
[07:16.560 --> 07:46.520]  We'll see you in the next segment.
[07:46.520 --> 08:16.320]  We'll see you in the next segment.
[08:16.320 --> 08:24.920]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:24.920 --> 08:28.040]  I'm David Knight on this Monday, March 27th, 2017.
[08:28.040 --> 08:33.720]  One of the stories that info war today is David Daniel Greenfield says the civil war
[08:33.720 --> 08:34.720]  is here.
[08:34.720 --> 08:39.440]  Now, he's talking about a political civil war, but when I look at the news today, this
[08:39.440 --> 08:40.440]  is what we're truly seeing.
[08:40.440 --> 08:42.520]  Of course, it's not just a political civil war.
[08:42.520 --> 08:47.040]  Yes, things have heated up more than we've seen in our lifetime.
[08:47.040 --> 08:53.960]  But there is a civil war that is being engineered by the open borders and the mass migration.
[08:53.960 --> 08:55.320]  We can see this in the other articles.
[08:55.320 --> 08:58.160]  One of them is on Drudge Report right now from infowars.com.
[08:58.160 --> 09:04.800]  Thousands of Americans are fleeing the big cities as a massive exodus out of the cities.
[09:04.800 --> 09:08.280]  Remember when everyone left the rural farms in the early 20th century and then went to
[09:08.280 --> 09:13.760]  the cities to find work as we needed fewer people to operate the farms and, of course,
[09:13.760 --> 09:17.560]  there were other issues that happened with agriculture, with the dust bowl and the depression,
[09:17.560 --> 09:18.560]  that sort of thing.
[09:18.560 --> 09:19.560]  But they moved to the cities.
[09:19.560 --> 09:21.520]  Now, they're starting to move away.
[09:21.520 --> 09:22.520]  Why?
[09:22.520 --> 09:24.920]  Well, I think they understand what is coming.
[09:24.920 --> 09:29.680]  It's not just the fact that it's expensive, it's dirty, it's crowded.
[09:29.680 --> 09:30.680]  It takes away your freedom.
[09:30.680 --> 09:34.680]  No, they're moving away because they're concerned about what is coming.
[09:34.680 --> 09:37.080]  I think people intuitively understand this.
[09:37.080 --> 09:42.720]  And we've talked multiple times, I have, about the fourth turning by Strauss and Howe.
[09:42.720 --> 09:47.040]  These are a couple of historians, demographers, they invented the term millennials.
[09:47.040 --> 09:54.960]  They saw a cycle going back about 500 years going through American and English history.
[09:54.960 --> 10:01.160]  They saw a cycle about every 80 years and they broke the 80-year cycle into four generations.
[10:01.160 --> 10:04.400]  And they see us at that fourth turning right now.
[10:04.400 --> 10:10.120]  A point in time, about every 80 years, like we had with the Revolutionary War, the Civil
[10:10.120 --> 10:12.160]  War, the New Deal.
[10:12.160 --> 10:14.680]  And now we see another major change coming.
[10:14.680 --> 10:21.040]  That's one of the reasons why Bannon, advisor to Donald Trump, said we need to deconstruct
[10:21.040 --> 10:22.480]  this regulatory state.
[10:22.480 --> 10:29.200]  And I was very surprised at the tactic that the Trump administration took by joining on
[10:29.200 --> 10:33.400]  with Paul Ryan, who does not want to deconstruct the regulatory state when it comes to Obamacare.
[10:33.400 --> 10:39.040]  When we look at that, they were going to leave it in place and essentially rearrange the
[10:39.040 --> 10:42.640]  deck chairs on this, what we ought to call, Titanic care.
[10:42.640 --> 10:47.480]  Look, this whole government-run health care is headed for an iceberg.
[10:47.480 --> 10:49.800]  And Donald Trump pointed that out after the thing failed.
[10:49.800 --> 10:53.240]  He said, yeah, this is going to crash, it's going to be bad.
[10:53.240 --> 10:58.800]  But the plan that was created by Paul Ryan was simply going to slow it down so that maybe
[10:58.800 --> 11:03.880]  that would happen on somebody else's watch rather than this current administration.
[11:03.880 --> 11:07.840]  And meanwhile, they would rearrange the deck chairs, play musical chairs to see who's going
[11:07.840 --> 11:09.360]  to be in charge of this.
[11:09.360 --> 11:12.400]  It needs to be shut down, it needs to be stopped, they need to reverse course.
[11:12.400 --> 11:17.000]  It's not something that's easily done, there's a lot of momentum in government.
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.000]  But when we look at the different phases that they were talking about, understand that there
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.400]  was phase one, which is going to get rid of some of the things with the central health
[11:26.400 --> 11:27.800]  benefits and some of these other things.
[11:27.800 --> 11:31.080]  But then we're still going to say, we're still going to define what essential health benefits
[11:31.080 --> 11:32.560]  are for you in Washington.
[11:32.560 --> 11:35.160]  We're still going to have to find your health care for you.
[11:35.160 --> 11:41.440]  Then they say, but in phase two, the Health and Human Services Secretary, HHS Secretary
[11:41.440 --> 11:45.720]  Tom Price is going to have some capability to make changes.
[11:45.720 --> 11:49.720]  He's got a lot of things that he can do because he's got this regulatory power.
[11:49.720 --> 11:51.320]  Why does he have that?
[11:51.320 --> 11:52.440]  He shouldn't have that.
[11:52.440 --> 11:54.640]  We shouldn't have a health czar.
[11:54.640 --> 11:59.080]  Because if Tom Price can fix some of this stuff with the wave of his hand and his pen
[11:59.080 --> 12:01.800]  and his phone, then guess what?
[12:01.800 --> 12:04.920]  We're going to have another dictator who's going to come along with a different administration
[12:04.920 --> 12:08.520]  or even a different HHS guy within the Trump administration.
[12:08.520 --> 12:09.520]  Who knows?
[12:09.520 --> 12:14.360]  When you set up somebody with dictatorial powers like this, and this is a problem throughout
[12:14.360 --> 12:15.360]  the government.
[12:15.360 --> 12:20.120]  When we have this committee that's going to look, Jared Kushner is going to now look
[12:20.120 --> 12:22.520]  at how to change Washington.
[12:22.520 --> 12:28.840]  One of the things they need to look at is how do we get rid of this regulatory state
[12:28.840 --> 12:31.720]  that is running our country in Washington?
[12:31.720 --> 12:33.320]  Congress isn't running the state.
[12:33.320 --> 12:37.840]  That's why both Nancy Pelosi and Paul Ryan can say, well, we have to pass this bill and
[12:37.840 --> 12:39.360]  then we'll find out what's in it.
[12:39.360 --> 12:41.080]  They weren't being cynical.
[12:41.080 --> 12:42.080]  They weren't being stupid.
[12:42.080 --> 12:47.240]  They were telling you, and Americans weren't listening, that they don't write the rules.
[12:47.240 --> 12:49.480]  The regulatory agencies write the rules.
[12:49.480 --> 12:52.080]  You can see that with the Dodd-Frank bill.
[12:52.080 --> 12:56.320]  They created the Dodd-Frank bill, and they created this massive bureaucracy regulatory
[12:56.320 --> 12:59.680]  agency, and then they're waiting for this thing to crank out the rules.
[12:59.680 --> 13:03.800]  And yeah, tens of thousands of regulations, tens of thousands of pages of regulations,
[13:03.800 --> 13:07.320]  these guys are going to be cranking out to control everything financially.
[13:07.320 --> 13:10.200]  Well, they want to control everything with your health care as well.
[13:10.200 --> 13:11.840]  And you wonder where that's headed?
[13:11.840 --> 13:16.560]  That's headed the same place that we have health care and food and everything else in
[13:16.560 --> 13:17.560]  Venezuela.
[13:17.560 --> 13:19.520]  So you want some Venezuelan health care?
[13:19.520 --> 13:21.840]  You want to czar in charge of your health care?
[13:21.840 --> 13:25.880]  Then keep this structure and just rearrange the deck chairs on it.
[13:25.880 --> 13:27.800]  That's not good enough.
[13:27.800 --> 13:29.000]  That's not good enough.
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.880]  So we see signs from within the Trump administration, with Bannon and with Jared Kushner, that they
[13:33.880 --> 13:37.520]  want to make some major structural changes, the key structural change that you have to
[13:37.520 --> 13:38.520]  make.
[13:38.520 --> 13:44.560]  Just to say that we're not going to allow the permanent, entrenched, unaccountable regulatory
[13:44.560 --> 13:48.240]  agencies to run our lives.
[13:48.240 --> 13:53.480]  You see, once we turn this over to them and it becomes regulatory law, then an agency
[13:53.480 --> 13:58.960]  like the EPA can come in and say, well, we're going to say that if you haven't gotten a
[13:58.960 --> 14:02.480]  permit from us, even though you got a permit from the state and the local government, and
[14:02.480 --> 14:08.080]  you got an eight acre ranch like this individual in Montana did, and he got permits from the
[14:08.080 --> 14:12.600]  state and local government, he built a pond on his property.
[14:12.600 --> 14:14.680]  And they came in and said, well, we didn't approve it.
[14:14.680 --> 14:15.680]  We don't like what you did.
[14:15.680 --> 14:20.680]  So we're going to assess fines against you of $37,000 a day.
[14:20.680 --> 14:24.960]  And he says, well, first person would say, well, first of all, don't I get a trial?
[14:24.960 --> 14:28.000]  No, you don't because it's regulatory law.
[14:28.000 --> 14:34.960]  With regulatory law, they say the prohibitions against having, making sure that the government
[14:34.960 --> 14:40.280]  gives you a trial, lets you defend yourself in court, gives you the presumption of innocence
[14:40.280 --> 14:41.280]  until proven guilty.
[14:41.280 --> 14:43.320]  None of that stuff applies with regulatory law.
[14:43.320 --> 14:49.640]  So the EPA, the IRS, the Obamacare, HHS, all these people can come after you and do whatever
[14:49.640 --> 14:55.640]  they wish, and then you have to sue them in court once they steal your money.
[14:55.640 --> 14:58.000]  And you don't have any prohibition against excessive fines.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.680]  Look at the FAA when they said, we're going to register drones.
[15:00.680 --> 15:04.800]  And by the way, if you don't register your drone, and we find out about it, we're going
[15:04.800 --> 15:06.640]  to assess a $25,000 fine against you.
[15:06.640 --> 15:07.640]  Do you think that's excessive?
[15:07.640 --> 15:12.360]  I do, but they say it's a civil violation, not a criminal violation.
[15:12.360 --> 15:14.520]  So the Bill of Rights doesn't apply.
[15:14.520 --> 15:15.520]  See how they play that fiction?
[15:15.520 --> 15:20.440]  It's the same principle that's involved in civil asset forfeiture, where they can imply
[15:20.440 --> 15:27.000]  that they think that your car or your house or your property had something to do with
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  drugs at some point in time.
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.480]  Or maybe they have a dog that smells cocaine on your cash because virtually all cash, as
[15:34.480 --> 15:38.800]  we know from studies, virtually all cash has a smell of cocaine on it for whatever reason.
[15:38.800 --> 15:42.240]  Maybe we should ask the CIA why that's so.
[15:42.240 --> 15:43.400]  They would know.
[15:43.400 --> 15:48.280]  But if they smell coke on your cash, they just take your cash.
[15:48.280 --> 15:50.240]  They charge your cash with a crime and they take it.
[15:50.240 --> 15:53.680]  And then you have to go to court and sue them or they take your airplane or they take your
[15:53.680 --> 15:56.920]  business or your home or your car.
[15:56.920 --> 16:02.480]  And they say that property is guilty, we think, in some way.
[16:02.480 --> 16:03.640]  And you have to prove that it isn't.
[16:03.640 --> 16:05.720]  So you have to prove the negative.
[16:05.720 --> 16:08.760]  You have to go without that property.
[16:08.760 --> 16:13.560]  And then if you've got enough assets left to sue them in court, it's a very long drawn
[16:13.560 --> 16:14.560]  out process.
[16:14.560 --> 16:21.520]  But they can just keep that without even charging you with a crime and call it civil asset forfeiture.
[16:21.520 --> 16:28.000]  So when we look at Obamacare, the greatest failure in my mind is the failure to understand
[16:28.000 --> 16:34.600]  that we have a dictatorial socialist system involved here that is going to tell us it's
[16:34.600 --> 16:38.840]  going to run our lives out of Washington, it's going to determine what's good and what's
[16:38.840 --> 16:39.840]  bad.
[16:39.840 --> 16:43.360]  And of course, you might agree with most of the stuff that Donald Trump's administration
[16:43.360 --> 16:48.200]  says is good, but you're not going to agree when the next Democrat comes in.
[16:48.200 --> 16:50.200]  And of course, the Democrats don't like what Donald Trump is going to do.
[16:50.200 --> 16:55.800]  We got to get back to a system where we have choices, where we have a marketplace.
[16:55.800 --> 17:00.880]  The only way that we're going to drive costs down in healthcare is if we get the government
[17:00.880 --> 17:02.120]  out of mandating it.
[17:02.120 --> 17:05.160]  The government cannot impose wage and price controls, didn't we learn that with Richard
[17:05.160 --> 17:06.160]  Nixon?
[17:06.160 --> 17:09.040]  He was a Republican, he was foolish enough to do that, it was wrong.
[17:09.040 --> 17:12.920]  But when the government tries to centrally plan the economy, it fails.
[17:12.920 --> 17:19.040]  Look at the Soviet Union, look at Venezuela, look at Washington DC.
[17:19.040 --> 17:22.600]  We have to stop trying to centrally plan the economy.
[17:22.600 --> 17:25.080]  That's why it should have been repealed completely.
[17:25.080 --> 17:31.520]  We don't want to depend, phase two was all about the HHS czar using his dictatorial powers
[17:31.520 --> 17:32.720]  out of Washington to fix it.
[17:32.720 --> 17:34.720]  Do you see the problem?
[17:34.720 --> 17:40.240]  If he was able to quote unquote fix it, then it would become fixed in place, it would become
[17:40.240 --> 17:42.040]  a fixture in Washington.
[17:42.040 --> 17:44.520]  That's what we saw with the Department of Education.
[17:44.520 --> 17:48.840]  Ronald Reagan was going to get rid of the Department of Education, he failed to do that.
[17:48.840 --> 17:53.120]  He made it bigger, it became fixed in place, it became a fixture.
[17:53.120 --> 17:56.800]  Are we better served when it comes to education today?
[17:56.800 --> 17:58.120]  No, we're not.
[17:58.120 --> 17:59.680]  We pay more, we get less.
[17:59.680 --> 18:04.920]  We get things like common core, we get things like manipulation of tranny bathrooms now
[18:04.920 --> 18:07.160]  from Washington.
[18:07.160 --> 18:09.800]  Why are we allowing this to happen?
[18:09.800 --> 18:14.080]  And why are we going to war with the only people who really understood that we've got
[18:14.080 --> 18:18.560]  to repeal this entire dictatorial infrastructure, and that's the House Freedom Caucus.
[18:18.560 --> 18:20.440]  They stood strong and against that.
[18:20.440 --> 18:22.000]  They're not the problem.
[18:22.000 --> 18:23.960]  The Democrats are not the solution.
[18:23.960 --> 18:30.160]  According to the Democrats for tax reform, I don't even know what to say about that.
[18:30.160 --> 18:31.320]  That is so off the wall.
[18:31.320 --> 18:36.040]  I don't know how in the world we're going to get tax reform from Democrats.
[18:36.040 --> 18:37.760]  Taxes are their raison d'etre.
[18:37.760 --> 18:44.360]  That's how they fund their expansive government, is with taxes.
[18:44.360 --> 18:47.120]  We are not going to get tax reform from the Democrats.
[18:47.120 --> 18:53.680]  So I want you to weigh in and tell me what you think about this failure of the, and again,
[18:53.680 --> 18:58.560]  as I say, it wasn't so much a political failure as it was a failure to recognize what the
[18:58.560 --> 19:00.680]  root of the problem is.
[19:00.680 --> 19:04.800]  The root of the problem is the fact that we're going to leave essential health benefits
[19:04.800 --> 19:06.200]  in and just tweak them.
[19:06.200 --> 19:11.080]  They were going to leave the power of the HHS Secretary, and we're going to say that
[19:11.080 --> 19:12.680]  that's even going to be a way to fix it.
[19:12.680 --> 19:14.080]  No, it's not.
[19:14.080 --> 19:17.440]  Paul Ryan never wanted to get rid of Obamacare.
[19:17.440 --> 19:22.040]  Paul Ryan was there as a backup plan with Mitt Romney in case Barack Obama didn't win.
[19:22.040 --> 19:23.600]  They were going to put in Romneycare.
[19:23.600 --> 19:27.040]  They had already done Obamacare in Massachusetts with Ted Kennedy.
[19:27.040 --> 19:29.240]  They wanted the government to run our healthcare.
[19:29.240 --> 19:33.040]  They wanted the government to take over a fifth of the economy or whatever the, it's
[19:33.040 --> 19:36.160]  a large ratio, but they wanted that to happen.
[19:36.160 --> 19:40.360]  Paul Ryan has opposed every reform, and he's been very clever about it.
[19:40.360 --> 19:45.600]  This is just his most recent way of opposing it, and we have to get to the bottom of what
[19:45.600 --> 19:46.600]  the problem is.
[19:46.600 --> 19:48.760]  The problem is not how much it costs.
[19:48.760 --> 19:53.600]  We had a revolutionary war over a 3% tax on T because it didn't like the structure.
[19:53.600 --> 19:55.920]  We got rid of the TPP because we didn't like the structure.
[19:55.920 --> 19:59.400]  Say what this will be right back.
[19:59.400 --> 20:04.760]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance.
[20:04.760 --> 20:08.840]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's
[20:08.840 --> 20:10.600]  medical expenses.

[20:15.560 --> 20:19.760]  This is from three health sharing programs, holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing,
[20:19.760 --> 20:24.000]  see guidelines, discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.

[21:03.160 --> 21:07.760]  to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia,
[21:07.760 --> 21:12.200]  chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[21:12.200 --> 21:16.800]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[22:04.680 --> 22:06.160]  money and lawyers.
[22:06.160 --> 22:08.080]  But they don't know Harry's.
[22:08.080 --> 22:09.520]  How's Harry's done it?
[22:09.520 --> 22:10.520]  Simple.

[23:55.320 --> 24:10.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[24:10.360 --> 24:14.360]  I'm David Knight on this Monday, March 27th, 2017.
[24:14.360 --> 24:16.280]  Today we see the stock market's plunging.
[24:16.280 --> 24:21.000]  We heard John McCain crowing over the weekend in Brussels about how much he loves the New
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.840]  World Order and the European Union and we need to have closer, tighter ties between the US
[24:25.840 --> 24:28.360]  and the European Union for the New World Order.
[24:28.360 --> 24:33.840]  They're feeling very good because of what happened with healthcare, the failure to repeal.
[24:33.840 --> 24:37.160]  And I think we need to not feed this by panicking about that.
[24:37.160 --> 24:40.800]  And I would even say the same thing to the Republicans in Washington.
[24:40.800 --> 24:44.600]  Look, Donald Trump didn't win every primary, right?
[24:44.600 --> 24:47.520]  He didn't win every state in the election.
[24:47.520 --> 24:51.080]  But you can still win overall and we've got a lot of things coming up.
[24:51.080 --> 24:52.080]  We can still regroup.
[24:52.080 --> 24:55.440]  We can still, if they want to, repeal Obamacare.
[24:55.440 --> 24:56.800]  And the sooner they do that, the better.
[24:56.800 --> 24:59.920]  But Alex Jones is going to be talking about what's going on with the stock market.
[24:59.920 --> 25:03.680]  Of course, we've been telling you a long time this is a sucker rally.
[25:03.680 --> 25:08.520]  It was looking for a pin so that they could pop it and take advantage of everybody who
[25:08.520 --> 25:11.120]  is suckered in in terms of optimism.
[25:11.120 --> 25:15.200]  Everybody understood that Donald Trump was going to be better for business than any Democrat
[25:15.200 --> 25:16.200]  would have been.
[25:16.200 --> 25:18.080]  So there was a lot of optimism.
[25:18.080 --> 25:23.080]  They manipulated that optimism into another stock market bubble.
[25:23.080 --> 25:28.720]  And now the first time something happens that they can say, look, it's not going to happen.
[25:28.720 --> 25:31.920]  Then they use that pin to burst the bubble and take their profits.
[25:31.920 --> 25:32.920]  That's what's really going on.
[25:32.920 --> 25:34.880]  So don't lose heart.
[25:34.880 --> 25:36.800]  We haven't lost the war.
[25:36.800 --> 25:40.120]  We simply lost a primary or battle or whatever you want to call it.
[25:40.120 --> 25:44.120]  Now, before we go back to the news, I want to read one of the reviews that we've got
[25:44.120 --> 25:45.120]  at infowarslife.com.
[25:45.120 --> 25:46.720]  We have a lot of reviews there.
[25:46.720 --> 25:49.960]  If you want to know about our products, take a look at the reviews.
[25:49.960 --> 25:55.920]  We've got thousands of reviews on these products, what people talk about, what they do for them,
[25:55.920 --> 25:57.560]  and the experiences that they've had with it.
[25:57.560 --> 25:58.560]  And here's one.
[25:58.560 --> 26:00.080]  This is our review of the day here.
[26:00.080 --> 26:01.920]  Survival Shield X2.
[26:01.920 --> 26:02.920]  This is from Darren.
[26:02.920 --> 26:08.280]  So the most alive I've felt in 20 years began using X2 back in January 2015.
[26:08.280 --> 26:10.000]  The first week was a detox.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.120]  Had a few headaches, some cleansing issues.
[26:12.120 --> 26:15.400]  And since then, I've never missed a day without a dropper's worth.
[26:15.400 --> 26:19.560]  The clarity, alertness, overall healthier feeling has been critical in my interactions
[26:19.560 --> 26:20.560]  with others.
[26:20.560 --> 26:24.560]  I've awakened many people in the past three years, and I credit it to the fire, the spark
[26:24.560 --> 26:31.240]  I exude, largely in part 2, X2, mineral fusion, secret 12, and most recently caveman.
[26:31.240 --> 26:33.440]  I feel the best I've felt in 20 years.
[26:33.440 --> 26:34.560]  Thanks, Alex, Dr. Group.
[26:34.560 --> 26:36.240]  God bless you all.
[26:36.240 --> 26:40.400]  And if you want to take advantage of some of the specials that we've got, we have 30-40%
[26:40.400 --> 26:41.400]  off.
[26:41.400 --> 26:42.880]  We've extended it.
[26:42.880 --> 26:44.120]  Now, one final day.
[26:44.120 --> 26:45.120]  This is going to end.
[26:45.120 --> 26:46.120]  30-40% off.
[26:46.120 --> 26:50.120]  Infowars, select storeable food at infowarsstore.com.
[26:50.120 --> 26:54.200]  This is the last day to get that discount.
[26:54.200 --> 26:59.280]  And as we look at storeable food, you know, it's interesting to see how things come and
[26:59.280 --> 27:00.280]  go.
[27:00.280 --> 27:01.280]  We saw this massive optimism.
[27:01.280 --> 27:02.880]  It pumped into the stock market.
[27:02.880 --> 27:05.120]  Everybody started buying stocks on Wall Street.
[27:05.120 --> 27:07.520]  They stopped stocking up on food.
[27:07.520 --> 27:10.720]  They stopped stocking up on guns because they said, oh, great.
[27:10.720 --> 27:12.200]  We've got somebody who supports the Second Amendment.
[27:12.200 --> 27:15.120]  We don't have to worry about that anymore.
[27:15.120 --> 27:20.520]  It's kind of interesting because we have this article at infowars.com from Michael Schneider.
[27:20.520 --> 27:22.120]  Thousands of Americans are fleeing the big cities.
[27:22.120 --> 27:23.280]  It's on the Drudge Report.
[27:23.280 --> 27:27.440]  Subtitle, why are so many people suddenly moving away from major U.S. cities?
[27:27.440 --> 27:31.120]  So recently, I wrote about the exodus happening out of the state of California.
[27:31.120 --> 27:36.760]  They said, many experts are completely mystified by this seismic demographic shifts that we're
[27:36.760 --> 27:37.760]  now witnessing.
[27:37.760 --> 27:40.960]  Now, here's some examples from data points here.
[27:40.960 --> 27:46.640]  He says, counties containing Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore were the biggest population losers
[27:46.640 --> 27:51.000]  in the U.S. from 2015 to 2016, according to the Census Bureau.
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.640]  Cook County, Illinois, where Chicago is the county seat, had the largest population loss
[27:55.640 --> 27:59.520]  of any county in the country from 2015 and 2016.
[27:59.520 --> 28:07.640]  Cook County alone had a quote unquote domestic immigration loss of more than 66,000 people.
[28:07.640 --> 28:09.680]  I should say migration, not immigration.
[28:09.680 --> 28:12.920]  But 66,000 people left Cook County, Chicago.
[28:12.920 --> 28:17.360]  Now, as I pointed out before, I said, Jefferson said, big cities are a threat to the health,
[28:17.360 --> 28:18.480]  the wealth, and liberty of man.
[28:18.480 --> 28:20.680]  So people have always looked for a way to get out of cities.
[28:20.680 --> 28:25.120]  That's why cars are so important to us because they give us a chance to, if we have to work
[28:25.120 --> 28:30.880]  in the city, to live outside of the city, to escape that, to get into the suburbs.
[28:30.880 --> 28:32.360]  We don't want to be in the herbs, okay?
[28:32.360 --> 28:36.280]  We don't want to be in the urban areas, but the urban planners want to keep us there.
[28:36.280 --> 28:41.840]  That's why they're coming up with a complete control lockdown grid of our transportation
[28:41.840 --> 28:45.760]  system and turning you into someone who doesn't even own a car.
[28:45.760 --> 28:49.600]  They want you to rent everything from a couple of companies, and they want to track everything
[28:49.600 --> 28:50.600]  that you do.
[28:50.600 --> 28:52.960]  They want to control everywhere that you go.
[28:52.960 --> 28:56.040]  But he's also pointing out what else is behind this, and this is what we've been talking
[28:56.040 --> 28:57.560]  about here at InfoWars for quite some time.
[28:57.560 --> 29:01.520]  He said others, however, are moving away from large cities because they're deeply concerned
[29:01.520 --> 29:04.840]  about where things are ultimately headed in this country.
[29:04.840 --> 29:09.320]  Like Doug Casey, who we've interviewed on InfoWars multiple times, he has crisis investing.
[29:09.320 --> 29:14.840]  He believes that we could soon see a civil war set off by a financial collapse.
[29:14.840 --> 29:18.360]  Casey sees a coming crisis equal or worse than a civil war.
[29:18.360 --> 29:22.080]  He says, in the U.S. right now, there seems to be so much antagonism.
[29:22.080 --> 29:24.560]  It's almost like pre-civil war.
[29:24.560 --> 29:26.880]  He thinks that a financial collapse will be the trigger.
[29:26.880 --> 29:28.280]  It's going to come down eventually.
[29:28.280 --> 29:31.680]  I'm worried about that, but we're in a situation where the country seems like it's just before
[29:31.680 --> 29:33.480]  a civil war.
[29:33.480 --> 29:38.320]  And then we see story after story of the political civil war that is beginning.
[29:38.320 --> 29:41.360]  That's why I said, we understand where this is headed.
[29:41.360 --> 29:43.960]  We are at a juncture, folks, and we better pay attention.
[29:43.960 --> 29:44.960]  Stay with us.
[29:44.960 --> 29:45.960]  Alex Jones is going to be right back.
[29:45.960 --> 29:50.000]  He's going to talk about the drop in the stock market.
[29:50.000 --> 29:59.720]  The empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:59.720 --> 30:03.760]  More fallout from the London ISIS terror attack as it is being reported on again that ISIS
[30:03.760 --> 30:08.080]  is using YouTube as a platform to put out violent recruitment videos as propaganda to
[30:08.080 --> 30:09.840]  further their religious caliphate.
[30:09.840 --> 30:13.520]  It is said that the London terrorist thug was using WhatsApp to send his final messages,
[30:13.520 --> 30:17.360]  but Scotland Yard and other investigative authorities cannot access these messages because
[30:17.360 --> 30:19.720]  WhatsApp itself says it cannot retrieve them.
[30:19.720 --> 30:23.760]  This again creates the battle between media platforms, consumers protected privacy, and
[30:23.760 --> 30:26.040]  governments access into such databases.
[30:26.040 --> 30:30.640]  But what really needs to be asked, how does YouTube allow ISIS to operate on its platform
[30:30.640 --> 30:34.040]  when some info wars videos have been removed for content?
[30:34.040 --> 30:38.760]  You're telling me, no one from the FBI or nothing from the CIA Vault 7 technologies
[30:38.760 --> 30:43.080]  can be used to track down whoever is posting these terrorist recruitment videos?
[30:43.080 --> 30:47.620]  It seems to me that we not only have a terrorist problem, we have a priority problem enabling
[30:47.620 --> 30:52.680]  these terrorists to operate online where conservative media is targeted before Islamic
[30:52.680 --> 30:54.000]  terrorist hate speech.
[30:54.000 --> 30:58.560]  This is Owens Royer for the more scrutinized by YouTube than ISIS, infowars.com.
[31:24.000 --> 31:27.960]  Remember, it discounts on the amazing products and free shipping when you sign up for auto

[31:50.160 --> 31:53.840]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how young Jebedy and the products
[31:53.840 --> 31:56.520]  at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[31:56.520 --> 31:59.680]  Check it out for yourself today.
[31:59.680 --> 32:04.600]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[32:04.600 --> 32:07.960]  before it became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk.
[32:07.960 --> 32:11.080]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com.
[32:11.080 --> 32:16.440]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom and
[32:16.440 --> 32:21.720]  seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula, Caveman.
[32:21.720 --> 32:25.720]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[32:25.720 --> 32:29.680]  superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[32:29.680 --> 32:33.720]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you used the meat for sustenance,
[32:33.720 --> 32:39.040]  the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength, from the outside structure full
[32:39.040 --> 32:42.960]  of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[32:42.960 --> 32:45.480]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[32:45.480 --> 32:49.800]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[32:49.800 --> 32:53.440]  to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[32:53.440 --> 32:57.880]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself in infowarslife.com
[32:57.880 --> 33:06.880]  today.
[33:06.880 --> 33:15.480]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance.
[33:15.480 --> 33:22.080]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[33:22.080 --> 33:30.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:30.360 --> 33:41.600]  I'm Alex Jones and this is an emergency transmission from the central Texas news center in Austin.
[33:41.600 --> 33:50.640]  It's Monday, March 27th, 2017 I'm Alex Jones with a breaking report for our viewers and
[33:50.640 --> 33:54.920]  listeners that affects every man woman and child on the planet.
[33:54.920 --> 34:00.560]  The globalists have been admitting for the last three years they were planning in 2017-2018
[34:00.560 --> 34:06.440]  to have a global downturn designed to bring in a world corporate government using the
[34:06.440 --> 34:10.240]  crisis to push a planetary Marshall plan.
[34:10.240 --> 34:14.280]  We've been hearing this for at least I said three years about four or five years from
[34:14.280 --> 34:20.040]  Davos pushing that hundred trillion dollar plan every decade based on carbon taxes to
[34:20.040 --> 34:26.160]  quote restart the global economy and also taxes on electronics and machines and quote
[34:26.160 --> 34:27.520]  robots.
[34:27.520 --> 34:29.600]  That's all being pitched as pro-human.
[34:29.600 --> 34:30.600]  It's the opposite.
[34:30.600 --> 34:35.320]  And I've been pointing out that nationalism all over the world and good movements inside
[34:35.320 --> 34:41.520]  our intelligence agencies have been pushing to try to actually have a prosperous growing
[34:41.520 --> 34:47.040]  economy not a post industrial economy as the United Nations has called for in the real
[34:47.040 --> 34:52.280]  edition arrow compact of 1992 called of course agenda 21.
[34:52.280 --> 34:56.760]  Now we have agenda 2030 that they've put out that's even more draconian.
[34:56.760 --> 34:57.760]  Here comes Trump.
[34:57.760 --> 35:01.040]  Here comes all the other movements saying no we're going to have a world built for people
[35:01.040 --> 35:05.480]  built on prosperity built on growth if you want to work hard.
[35:05.480 --> 35:09.760]  They have been in Bloomberg and in other financial papers for months we've shown you this trying
[35:09.760 --> 35:14.640]  to destroy the Trump rally doing everything they can to say he's a loser he's not going
[35:14.640 --> 35:19.200]  to deliver nationalism is going to fail they've had hundreds of articles the Financial Times
[35:19.200 --> 35:26.200]  of London BBC Wall Street Journal New York Times saying that if they fail to block Trump
[35:26.200 --> 35:31.840]  and his prosperity that people will then get into prosperity and free market and not collectivism
[35:31.840 --> 35:35.440]  not globalism and they're dead you've seen those headlines everywhere global governments
[35:35.440 --> 35:40.960]  in trouble it's collapsing and they say prosperity is the enemy and I've pointed out how arrogant
[35:40.960 --> 35:46.240]  is that to try something like that and then to think that they'll get away with it but
[35:46.240 --> 35:53.600]  again they have the MSM openly trying to plunge the economy while they sit there and tell
[35:53.600 --> 35:56.880]  you that the economy goes down is Trump's fault it's incredible it's kind of like saying
[35:56.880 --> 36:01.520]  that Obamacare is now the fault of Trump he's been in 60 something days and they're on the
[36:01.520 --> 36:05.960]  news saying this he didn't get repealed in just the first month he was trying that he's
[36:05.960 --> 36:10.080]  a failure it took him three years to pass Obamacare took him five six years even start
[36:10.080 --> 36:16.520]  implementing all of it so here we are ladies and gentlemen in the middle of this and quite
[36:16.520 --> 36:20.320]  frankly I don't think Trump should have supported the Paul Ryan bill it was better than Obamacare
[36:20.320 --> 36:25.080]  it killed the death spiral it does not make you get healthcare that's a big plus but quite
[36:25.080 --> 36:28.320]  frankly that's the first big strike against Trump I didn't like what he did neither did
[36:28.320 --> 36:32.320]  Matt Rush neither did our own David Knight I mean anybody that knew the legislation knew
[36:32.320 --> 36:36.280]  it was not a good idea it's better than the other absolutely true could have gotten changed
[36:36.280 --> 36:40.120]  in the Senate could have gotten made better I see what the president's doing trying to
[36:40.120 --> 36:44.920]  get stuff done that's better at least about 80% better the problem is they're now driving
[36:44.920 --> 36:49.560]  out as a failure and saying he's dead duck he's lame duck never before as a president
[36:49.560 --> 36:54.360]  done what he's done in just the first 50 days do I have to list all the numbers in the stock
[36:54.360 --> 36:58.720]  market three trillion three hundred billion an ounce of small job incentives the best
[36:58.720 --> 37:03.120]  small job numbers since the peak of the 1984 Reagan recovery should I keep listing everything
[37:03.120 --> 37:08.960]  else defeating political correctness so starting to secure our borders everything the global
[37:08.960 --> 37:14.120]  state that's why they're so angry but now the Trump stock market rally is under siege
[37:14.120 --> 37:20.960]  CNN that's the big headline the stock market's plunging today and they're saying it's Trump's
[37:20.960 --> 37:25.880]  fault and openly trying to kill confidence under Obama we had a horrible economy everything
[37:25.880 --> 37:31.560]  he did was pure gold though he was the reason the sun was shining that birds were singing
[37:31.560 --> 37:37.000]  but then Trump over delivers his first 60-something days and they are piling on that it's all over
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.680]  trying to kill confidence in the economy that's been coming from small business startups and
[37:41.680 --> 37:46.920]  people buying going out shopping and things like that to get the economy moving so if
[37:46.920 --> 37:49.840]  they're able to kill this recovery they're trying to kill it in Europe what did they
[37:49.840 --> 37:54.360]  tell Bringson they told Nigel Farage and others you try to leave the unelected to you you
[37:54.360 --> 37:59.640]  don't let us make all your laws and run you will economically devastate you and they've
[37:59.640 --> 38:02.840]  been trying to but that only made the British matter because they're saying you're trying
[38:02.840 --> 38:07.400]  to hurt our economy because of our vote here they're not even as honest they admit they
[38:07.400 --> 38:11.840]  want to plunge the economy but don't openly threaten it so remember who's doing this
[38:11.840 --> 38:16.320]  Obama did Obama care the globalists are the ones trying to plunge the economy and they're
[38:16.320 --> 38:21.600]  starting to have some success right now here it is ladies and gentlemen the stock market
[38:21.600 --> 38:26.440]  rally is under siege ladies and gentlemen and it goes through the whole thing Wall Street
[38:26.440 --> 38:32.120]  no longer believes President Trump's agenda is a slam dunk boom you see man that's treacherous
[38:32.120 --> 38:37.220]  man that's crazy the Dow slumped more than 125 points Monday morning as Trump stunning
[38:37.220 --> 38:44.160]  failure stunning failure to repeal and replace Obamacare has spooked investors stunning defeat
[38:44.160 --> 38:49.720]  when they can just keep trying and men are gonna succeed if the losses hold and the
[38:49.720 --> 38:55.960]  down ends down it could be an eight straight down day that hasn't happened since 2011
[38:55.960 --> 39:01.080]  the market retreat is a reflection of rising fears on Wall Street let me go back over here
[39:01.080 --> 39:06.440]  and break this down for you ladies and gentlemen they're saying he didn't travel the country
[39:06.440 --> 39:11.080]  and promote his repeal he didn't blah blah blah Obama pushed a bunch of lies how it was
[39:11.080 --> 39:14.600]  free and that was a great deal and travel the country for almost three years to pass
[39:14.600 --> 39:19.240]  it but that didn't mean it was a good bill the republic has tried to block him from
[39:19.240 --> 39:23.000]  actually repealing it because they wanted to just bitch the last seven years but not
[39:23.000 --> 39:29.120]  actually block it and so he actually is rampaging forward to do exactly what we ask and they
[39:29.120 --> 39:34.560]  call that failure he's like a football team that just put 70 something points on the board
[39:34.560 --> 39:41.240]  the other team zero they get a field goal and we're hearing how the team at 70 plus
[39:41.240 --> 39:46.400]  points ahead are losers that's the level of the mind control just like they said Trump
[39:46.400 --> 39:50.880]  was under surveillance then they said he never was and Trump was crazy again they're acting
[39:50.880 --> 39:56.640]  like you have no memory let's continue so look at this Wall Street no longer believes
[39:56.640 --> 40:01.160]  Trump agenda is a slam dunk and so there they are trying to demonize your economy boom what
[40:01.160 --> 40:07.480]  I mentioned earlier a new article out today EU observer McCain world cries out for us
[40:07.480 --> 40:13.400]  and EU leadership he means the corporate elites that have dominated and taken control of our
[40:13.400 --> 40:17.560]  governments and our picking winners and losers he goes on to say the world cries out for
[40:17.560 --> 40:22.880]  America European leadership throughout the EU and NATO USC and Senator John McCain said
[40:22.880 --> 40:27.400]  in a new world order that's a quote thought that didn't exist world government in a new
[40:27.400 --> 40:34.760]  world order under an enormous strain and in a titanic struggle with forces of radicalism
[40:34.760 --> 40:43.280]  he helped fund Al Qaeda we stand by and lament what we've got to be involved said McCain
[40:43.280 --> 40:47.320]  a Republican presidential candidate America is involved it's just not selling us out to
[40:47.320 --> 40:53.200]  the IMF the World Bank the TPP you name it he goes on to say he trusts the EU and they've
[40:53.200 --> 40:58.080]  got to weigh in and help get America back online just like the communist president was
[40:58.080 --> 41:03.040]  at Davos two months ago and said he helped get Trump in America in line absolutely outrageous
[41:03.040 --> 41:07.760]  Bill Gates versus the robots that's out of the Wall Street Journal it's it's Bill Gates
[41:07.760 --> 41:15.640]  pushing robots and automation but his answer is a global compact to tax robots to pay it
[41:15.640 --> 41:20.760]  into government so I love that governments will be funded and the elites will be funded
[41:20.760 --> 41:25.080]  as the socialist France and the communist China everybody else converts to it so the
[41:25.080 --> 41:30.840]  elites will make money off the robots they're taking our jobs isn't that just special and
[41:30.840 --> 41:35.320]  then there'll be a government total obsession with having more and more robotics because
[41:35.320 --> 41:39.960]  they get funding from it that's all then sold as an anti-robotics agenda I'm not against
[41:39.960 --> 41:43.800]  robotics I'm against how it's all being set up to displace humans by design in their own
[41:43.800 --> 41:51.040]  words Gowdy Nunez breached president on matters unrelated to Russian probe let's talk about
[41:51.040 --> 41:57.000]  that congressman Nunez I called a hero last week for simply telling the truth that of
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.520]  course their surveillance of the incoming president under law there is when they talk
[42:01.520 --> 42:06.480]  to foreign leaders that's on the books but the media claimed that hoax that no one had
[42:06.480 --> 42:10.680]  ever spied on Trump but he was insane so Nunez will now be punished because he said the
[42:10.680 --> 42:16.680]  sky was blue and now they're acting like oh can he be trusted in the Russian probe because
[42:16.680 --> 42:21.720]  you know he's a Trump supporter and met with the president so now it's dirty for the house
[42:21.720 --> 42:26.640]  intelligence committee chairman to meet with the president something that's totally normal
[42:26.640 --> 42:32.080]  but they think you're politically illiterate they believe you have the political education
[42:32.080 --> 42:36.520]  of a two-year-old they believe you have the attention span of a goldfish member Gruber
[42:36.520 --> 42:43.200]  said thank god you're so dumb thank god you have no attention span and they just rain
[42:43.200 --> 42:49.800]  down these lies and these frauds trying to kill an americana restoration people ask wives
[42:49.800 --> 42:54.720]  cheerleader for Trump he's not perfect but he really wants to restore the country he really
[42:54.720 --> 42:58.920]  is america first he really is trying to rebuild our nation have a sovereign country he really
[42:58.920 --> 43:03.440]  does want prosperity and he's got the entire corrupt elite and the republican party and
[43:03.440 --> 43:08.960]  the foreign governments all against him and anybody who sits their sides with MSM and
[43:08.960 --> 43:13.080]  the big banks and runs down our president are the biggest idiots in the world because
[43:13.080 --> 43:17.240]  you're not part of the power structure 99% of the people that make snide remarks and
[43:17.240 --> 43:21.640]  make fun of me on reddit oh I'm crazy I believe in world government I'm crazy I think your
[43:21.640 --> 43:26.560]  TV is watching you oh I'm crazy I think Trump's gonna win oh I'm crazy the polls are fake
[43:26.560 --> 43:31.520]  oh I'm crazy there's cancer viruses in the vaccines oh I'm crazy oh I'm crazy oh I'm
[43:31.520 --> 43:37.120]  not crazy I'm actually informed and then people misrepresent what I say and what I promote
[43:37.120 --> 43:43.280]  but I'm telling the truth and when I'm wrong I admit it like when I said 15 years ago that
[43:43.280 --> 43:48.320]  people were crazy you know that like David Horowitz that said the left was gonna merge
[43:48.320 --> 43:53.200]  with Islam and flood the west and enforce sharia law and make us give up our rights
[43:53.200 --> 43:57.720]  to be compatible with them it's all official now so I'm wrong I'll tell you but let me
[43:57.720 --> 44:05.000]  tell you it's it's it's pretty damn rare continuing report British special forces deploying to
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.080]  London streets permanently after terror attack that's out of the sun and enforce.com oh so
[44:10.080 --> 44:14.320]  the government lets in millions of Islamists most of military aged men they start attacking
[44:14.320 --> 44:18.560]  turns out this guy didn't get his orders from ISIS running people with a car stabbing them
[44:18.560 --> 44:22.000]  but that's okay it's not related to Islam but let's put trims on the street and have
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.640]  a police state so leave your border open leave the tunnel open let folks flood in but then
[44:27.640 --> 44:32.240]  take everybody else's rights video Syrian refugees in Germany start street battle Shan
[44:32.240 --> 44:39.080]  Allah Akbar Paul Joseph Watson info wars.com this is just today look at this arrogant
[44:39.080 --> 44:46.200]  but totally entitled person just just incredible Sweden feminist leader that means anti-human
[44:46.200 --> 44:53.880]  says foreign rapists should not be deported because white Swedes are not deported as well
[44:53.880 --> 44:58.160]  that's universal global citizenship where the globalist collapse the third world bring
[44:58.160 --> 45:03.080]  in incompatible groups and then say you have no right to have them adopt anything in your
[45:03.080 --> 45:08.080]  culture and then what is it something like 70% of the Islamist invaders into Europe last
[45:08.080 --> 45:13.800]  decade are on welfare and never get a job it's higher in Germany it's above 80% search
[45:13.800 --> 45:20.200]  engine it for yourself and the UN admits it's to end Western culture now you think about
[45:20.200 --> 45:25.120]  that ladies and gentlemen this is the left pushing a global racist cosmology knowing
[45:25.120 --> 45:29.600]  the world's only 7% white probably even a lower percent a lot of people that identify
[45:29.600 --> 45:35.200]  as white who you'd argue aren't whatever I don't I want everybody to be into liberty
[45:35.200 --> 45:39.480]  and freedom and ideas regardless of what color that's what unifies us but the left doesn't
[45:39.480 --> 45:43.200]  want that the social engineers don't want that the big cold blooded corporations can
[45:43.200 --> 45:47.400]  look at populations they want to control and dumb down and lower their wages and they just
[45:47.400 --> 45:51.740]  play us off via race and religion because that's an easy way to control us and the public's
[45:51.740 --> 45:57.200]  diamond goes along with it it really is incredible how a lot of people don't want real freedom
[45:57.200 --> 46:01.000]  or real prosperity they just want to feel like they're in a group and feel like they're
[46:01.000 --> 46:06.560]  successful instead of actually standing for what's real but here's the bottom line they're
[46:06.560 --> 46:11.800]  plunging the stock market today as they promise to do to defeat our nationalist movement because
[46:11.800 --> 46:16.520]  if they could discredit nationalism and free market as the real engine of prosperity they
[46:16.520 --> 46:23.280]  can sell collectivism and the nightmare that is command and control absolutely right and
[46:23.280 --> 46:27.440]  that's Alex Jones talking about command and control when we look at that nothing says
[46:27.440 --> 46:34.440]  that more clearly than the command and control is being established with our transportation
[46:34.440 --> 46:38.480]  understand that's the first thing that a military force does is make sure they've got lines
[46:38.480 --> 46:44.840]  of communication lines of transportation that they have supply lines set up that's one of
[46:44.840 --> 46:49.040]  the reasons why Adolf Hitler created the interstate systems one of the reasons why Eisenhower
[46:49.040 --> 46:55.040]  created the interstate system he had before the war written a piece on how difficult
[46:55.040 --> 47:01.680]  it was to take a a bunch of military a convoy military convoy up the east coast it says nearly
[47:01.680 --> 47:04.600]  impossible when they saw what the Germans had done they built the interstate system
[47:04.600 --> 47:09.000]  while they're building a different system now this system is not designed that they're
[47:09.000 --> 47:15.520]  building now is not designed to make things expedient for you is designed to make things
[47:15.520 --> 47:22.760]  expedient for the government in terms of tracking you in terms of taxing you and for the corporations
[47:22.760 --> 47:28.080]  that are going to work with them because this is a fascist plan they're going to have the
[47:28.080 --> 47:33.000]  corporations make a lot of money for cooperating with these people who want to shut down our
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.560]  ability to move to track everything that we do and of course they're going to give them
[47:36.560 --> 47:40.880]  monopolies we can see that happening we'll talk about that in a moment again this story
[47:40.880 --> 47:44.320]  that's up on info wars today and on dredge report thousands of Americans are fleeing
[47:44.320 --> 47:48.800]  the big cities another greenfield says the civil war is here the civil war is very different
[47:48.800 --> 47:54.000]  he says from this last one there are no cannons no cavalry charges well not yet anyway the
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.640]  left doesn't want to secede it wants to rule well here's the deal and this reflects back
[47:58.640 --> 48:07.480]  to why we want to see Obamacare repealed the very structures of an HHS czar repealed not
[48:07.480 --> 48:14.200]  tweaked not moderately modified repeal that structure you can't have a market based system
[48:14.200 --> 48:18.240]  if you've got somebody in HHS that is going to be able to dictate these things to you
[48:18.240 --> 48:23.160]  with the regulatory environment and that's only one part of the regulatory rule that
[48:23.160 --> 48:27.360]  we have out of Washington that's what needs to be fundamentally changed but we look at
[48:27.360 --> 48:32.880]  the civil war remember that we had the American Revolution right when they declared independence
[48:32.880 --> 48:37.880]  they said that government is there to protect our life and our liberty well if we want our
[48:37.880 --> 48:41.200]  life and liberty protected we need to get rid of this health czar we need to get rid
[48:41.200 --> 48:46.720]  of Obamacare the structures of Obamacare the assumptions of Obamacare the mandates the
[48:46.720 --> 48:52.600]  taxes of Obamacare as I said before you replace the coercion with choice you replace the mandates
[48:52.600 --> 48:59.160]  with markets we can do this if we have information and power as consumers it's not anything to
[48:59.160 --> 49:05.560]  brag about that we've added 20 some odd million people to Obamacare insurance that's nothing
[49:05.560 --> 49:09.600]  to brag about when you look at what has happened to the cost of people who are actually footing
[49:09.600 --> 49:13.680]  the bill to the people who are paying for their insurance who wanted insurance who were
[49:13.680 --> 49:20.120]  able to choose a level of insurance that they could afford now that's change now now everybody's
[49:20.120 --> 49:24.560]  got insurance that they can't afford that's being shoved down their throat because we
[49:24.560 --> 49:29.360]  have this command and control structure coming out of Washington that is what has to change
[49:29.360 --> 49:34.600]  it isn't the details it isn't going to fix things to say all right now we're not going
[49:34.600 --> 49:41.080]  to mandate that single man get maternity care and have to pay for mammograms and so forth
[49:41.080 --> 49:45.760]  that isn't going to fix it what has to be changed is the fact that they have assumed
[49:45.760 --> 49:50.840]  unconstitutionally regardless of what justice Roberts did they have assumed unconstitutionally
[49:50.840 --> 49:57.280]  that they can force you to buy the product of a private company and that they can dictate
[49:57.280 --> 50:04.360]  the terms of things from a HSS HHS czar in Washington that has to change so when we look
[50:04.360 --> 50:08.560]  at this when we say you know government is created to protect life and liberty and they
[50:08.560 --> 50:12.280]  said in the Declaration of Independence that when it destroys your life and liberty like
[50:12.280 --> 50:18.520]  Obamacare it is the right and the duty of the people to alter or abolish Obamacare or
[50:18.520 --> 50:23.080]  the government if they won't do that because that's what we thought a revolution over it
[50:23.080 --> 50:28.280]  was over a 3% tax on T not because the tax on T was such a high level that it was too
[50:28.280 --> 50:34.600]  onerous but because we didn't have any say so and how it was imposed that's why we fought
[50:34.600 --> 50:42.120]  1776 that's why Obamacare needs to be repealed because it threatens our life and our liberty
[50:42.120 --> 50:46.880]  and we will not allow that to stand and so the civil war that is coming is going to be
[50:46.880 --> 50:52.240]  economically based it is going to be demographically based and it is starting now politically
[50:52.240 --> 51:02.440]  stay with us we'll be right back hi this is Ron Paul I am a former congressman physician
[51:02.440 --> 51:08.120]  and presidential candidate the world is in turmoil things like Ebola earthquakes wars

[51:13.640 --> 51:18.360]  in parts of the world just having enough food is a huge problem for some of us there is
[51:18.360 --> 51:23.200]  the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good so we keep some food on hand

[53:57.080 --> 54:18.000]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this monday march 27th 2017 i was
[54:18.000 --> 54:23.040]  just talking about the session the article that we have an info wars i cons civil war
[54:23.040 --> 54:26.360]  is here and they talk a lot about the session about california's the session that sort of
[54:26.360 --> 54:34.080]  saying look Nigel frage is working with people in california i think secession is not war
[54:34.080 --> 54:39.680]  we've been taught that in our schools because we've been given a distorted version of history
[54:39.680 --> 54:44.440]  secession does not have to equal war we've had situations in scandinavian countries
[54:44.440 --> 54:48.680]  where norway and sweden went peacefully their way they went their separate ways they joined
[54:48.680 --> 54:52.200]  they went apart same thing with copenhagen part of that then went their separate ways
[54:52.200 --> 54:58.400]  peacefully you can split up peacefully we had the check of sevacca split into the check
[54:58.400 --> 55:03.000]  republic and sevacca peacefully they didn't have a war you don't have to have a war is
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.680]  only if you get caught up in flags and empires that you have to have a war to maintain your
[55:06.680 --> 55:15.080]  pride of possession so secession can be a pressure relief valve and quite frankly there
[55:15.080 --> 55:18.680]  is such a difference now between california and the rest of the country i would like to
[55:18.680 --> 55:23.840]  see california parts of california secede and go their own way maybe they can join mexico
[55:23.840 --> 55:28.040]  or canada or whatever just be their own independent country and other parts if they choose to remain
[55:28.040 --> 55:32.760]  with the united states allow them to remain that was the situation at the time of the
[55:32.760 --> 55:37.320]  civil war when virginia seceded west virginia said no we want to stay that was what really
[55:37.320 --> 55:43.160]  has been going on with Crimea when ukraine said we want to go our separate way and Crimea
[55:43.160 --> 55:47.360]  said well we don't want to go with Crimea we want to stay in russia and now they got
[55:47.360 --> 55:51.400]  a war it doesn't have to be that way it can be a pressure relief valve and now we got
[55:51.400 --> 55:56.400]  this story that Daniels gave me he's going to comment on this as well from the atlantic
[55:56.400 --> 56:00.960]  rewriting the rules of presidential secession they keep putting this out there that americans
[56:00.960 --> 56:05.640]  now have to face at least a possibility a tangible one that the election itself was subverted
[56:05.640 --> 56:10.000]  by a hostile foreign power league with winning presidential campaign with implications all
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.560]  the way down the ballot what do we do if this proves to be the case i've been asked this
[56:13.560 --> 56:18.520]  question a lot he says what so we've been working on this continuity of government commission
[56:18.520 --> 56:24.960]  with tom man and his name is norm ornstein he's been working with tom man working on
[56:24.960 --> 56:29.720]  presidential secession see that's what is really dangerous the fact that these people
[56:29.720 --> 56:32.400]  going to try to subvert our government just let them go their own way do their own thing
[56:32.400 --> 56:36.360]  they have a completely different way of looking at things when we look at what happened over
[56:36.360 --> 56:41.920]  the weekend with ryan's previous he goes on with chris wallace on fox news chris wallace
[56:41.920 --> 56:47.400]  is selling the russians did it stuff subtly now he says uh previous holds up the article
[56:47.400 --> 56:51.400]  the new york times article that says look the trump team was wiretapped and i thought
[56:51.400 --> 56:56.320]  it was absolutely amazing that chris wallace would push back and defend this whole russians
[56:56.320 --> 57:00.000]  did it narrative and say but but but it's it's it's it's about it didn't say anything
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.560]  about trump tower and he said well of course there's there's nothing it doesn't have to
[57:03.560 --> 57:07.480]  say anything about trump tower they're looking at them everywhere they're looking at the trump
[57:07.480 --> 57:11.720]  transition team it says whether they were inadvertently swept up or where the names
[57:11.720 --> 57:15.800]  were unmasked chris you don't know the full answer that question i don't either said previous
[57:15.800 --> 57:20.720]  but if people in the trump transition were unknowingly surveilled illegally unmasked
[57:20.720 --> 57:25.200]  on documents which is what is being alleged out there not it's not even really being
[57:25.200 --> 57:28.840]  alleged we know that's the case i think it's a big problem i think ultimately president
[57:28.840 --> 57:34.360]  trump is going to be proven correct this wasn't right and so you've got him going on fighting
[57:34.360 --> 57:41.280]  with chris wallace over the reality see facts don't matter and i thought it was very interesting
[57:41.280 --> 57:46.920]  that this this back and forth between ted koppel and shon hennedy and shon hennedy is
[57:46.920 --> 57:50.680]  saying to ted koppel is a 45 minute interview they chopped this thing up into a two minute
[57:50.680 --> 57:55.080]  thing to do a hatchet job on shon hennedy which is why alex jones refuses to do with
[57:55.080 --> 57:58.920]  these interviews because he says they're going to chop the stuff up which they did and shon
[57:58.920 --> 58:01.560]  hennedy would say hey we gotta get some credit to the american people they can distinguish
[58:01.560 --> 58:06.760]  between an opinion show and a news show so we're gonna play that clip for you in the
[58:06.760 --> 58:11.240]  next segment before we do real quickly i just want to point out the specials that we

[59:52.040 --> 59:59.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:26.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show as i was just talking about in the last segment this
[1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:31.480]  weekend we had rince previs to go on fox news with chris wallis and he holds up the headline
[1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:36.960]  from the new york times the paper of record the people for whom we need to bow down and
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:41.240]  worship their authority because everything they say is true and they hold up a you know
[1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:44.560]  he holds up the paper that we have shown over and over again we've added on the back wall
[1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:52.360]  here over and over again new york times january 20th 2017 at the top wiretapped data use an
[1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:57.880]  inquiry of trump aids but we're not supposed to believe that that really happened that's
[1:00:57.880 --> 1:01:02.640]  a conspiracy theory see trump learned about that not from the new york times not from
[1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:07.200]  the paper of record he learned about that from the crazy alt-right media well you know
[1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:10.520]  the simple fact the matter is they're listening to everybody about everything but when they
[1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:16.640]  admit it when their own papers admit it when they own their own mockingbird press admits
[1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:20.920]  it we're not allowed to talk about that and we even have fox news anchors pushing back
[1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:23.880]  on that but but but it didn't say anything about trump towers it's like what are you
[1:01:23.880 --> 1:01:27.960]  talking about if they're gonna listen to you if they're gonna wiretap your data okay we
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:32.760]  live in a wireless world so it doesn't matter where your physical location is they're gonna
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:38.320]  get that information we live in a warrantless world and when we had watergate did they put
[1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:42.800]  out that they get a search warrant to go into the democrat campaign committee no they didn't
[1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:48.080]  do that did they cover it up yeah they did they did has anything changed no it hasn't
[1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:52.320]  matter of fact we knew back in the 70s we knew with the church and pike committee hearings
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:56.640]  they pull that up and they said hey the CIA is spying on americans that's not part of
[1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:01.360]  their brief the NSA is spying on americans oh by the way where is your charter you were
[1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:08.040]  created by executive order by president Truman where's your executive oh we're not gonna show
[1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:11.880]  that to you congressman you're not allowed to see that you don't have clearance to see
[1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:18.120]  that and that's the dark state that's the CIA NSA surveillance state along with a bureaucracy
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:21.680]  which is going to tell you everything that you have to do in your life and is going
[1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:25.320]  to say that whenever they come after you whether it's a fines or penalties you don't have a
[1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:30.320]  presumption of innocence you don't have a trial and whatever they give you there's no protection
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:34.680]  against excessive fines either because the constitution doesn't apply this is a an elected
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:38.240]  bureaucracy so the constitution would only apply if we were doing this legally and since
[1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:42.760]  we don't really have a constitutional government anymore the bureaucracy can do whatever they
[1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:49.200]  wish because constitution doesn't apply we're in regulatory land now and so an extension
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:55.440]  to this I want to get a video I want to play you this hatchet job that ABC or actually CBS
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:03:02.400]  Ted Koppel retired like 10 12 years ago Ted Koppel gets Sean Hannity on and they're arguing
[1:03:02.400 --> 1:03:05.880]  about the nature of news today and Sean Hannity says well I think we've got to give credit
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:11.000]  to the American people they are intelligent enough to know the difference between an opinion
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  show and a news show I think you're capable enough we we give you the basic facts of what's
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:21.560]  happened the events that have happened today and we analyze it and that's what Sean Hannity
[1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:26.040]  and many people do in the media that's what Rush Limbaugh does it's what a lot of people
[1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:31.720]  do that but now they say oh we don't want you to analyze this what they don't want is
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:35.480]  for you to understand what's going on and they don't want certain things covered just
[1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:39.640]  like they didn't want to cover the entire 45 minutes that Sean Hannity had with Ted
[1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:44.960]  Koppel here's what Ted Koppel said he said you have attracted people who are determined
[1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:50.880]  that ideology is more important than facts what Ted Koppel is trying to sell people
[1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:54.560]  is the same lie that the mainstream media has been telling us for a very long time that
[1:03:54.560 --> 1:03:59.400]  they are disinterested that they are neutral that they are objective they have no dog in
[1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:03.760]  this fight do you believe that anymore do you believe that do you believe that there
[1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:08.720]  is any such thing as objective news there isn't any such thing as objective news look
[1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:13.840]  even when you just simply report the bare bone event facts of this without any comment
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:20.640]  without any analysis you just put the basic facts down there what you choose to report
[1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:26.920]  shows your bias so the mainstream media for longest time would not even report or go near
[1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:31.000]  certain topics you can see that whenever we have the presidential elections does anybody
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:36.160]  ever talk about the federal reserve of course not that is off limits you can't talk about
[1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:40.720]  the federal reserve you can't talk about that kind of stuff no that's not a topic so even
[1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:45.280]  when they limit themselves just talking about the events the events that they choose show
[1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:49.880]  their bias but they go beyond that and we'll talk about that still didn't get that clip
[1:04:49.880 --> 1:04:54.720]  we're going to play that clip but when we come back we've got a clip for you from the
[1:04:54.720 --> 1:04:59.440]  guy who used to do the sex pistols and we've also got a report that Watson did predicting
[1:04:59.440 --> 1:05:04.240]  the battle of the tech elites as Elon musk and Demis Hassibis and others clash over artificial
[1:05:04.240 --> 1:05:09.200]  intelligence musk has been public about his concerns for AI for years in 2014 stating
[1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:12.960]  with artificial intelligence we are summoning a demon then sarcastically mocked the thought
[1:05:12.960 --> 1:05:17.440]  that man could be in control of such a demon now musk together with Sam Altman has started
[1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:21.760]  a billion dollar nonprofit called open AI to work for safer AI in the future it's no
[1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:26.920]  surprise that Hassibis and Ray Kurzweil would disagree both are working on Google AI projects
[1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:31.800]  Hassibis project is called deep mind and Kurzweil is collaborating on a project called Google
[1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:36.080]  brain but musk is taking a different approach with open AI wanting the technology to be
[1:05:36.080 --> 1:05:40.160]  shared with the world rather than the algorithms be in the hands of a few elites in government
[1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:44.200]  and the tech industry musk has also said he wants to be able to get to Mars in case AI
[1:05:44.200 --> 1:05:48.400]  destroys earth meanwhile Mark Zuckerberg is having tea with his artificial intelligence
[1:05:48.400 --> 1:05:52.640]  butler the real fact of the matter is that AI is already here the question is will it
[1:05:52.640 --> 1:05:57.520]  ever attain self-realization and what would that mean for humans for info wars dot com

[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:56.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and we've got a couple of reports. I want to play back to back.
[1:08:56.080 --> 1:08:59.360]  First, we've got a comment. Of course, you can see the article on the Drudge Report.
[1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:06.240]  Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, the punk rock scene, is now talking about his political views.
[1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:10.800]  And this is something that Paul Joseph Watson did a report on about a month and a half ago,
[1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:16.640]  anticipating where this is going. You know, the Sex Pistols and punk rock is never my cup of tea.
[1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:21.520]  But it's an interesting cultural perspective that we've got going on here. So we're going to play
[1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:25.600]  this report. We're going to have Johnny Rotten here. And then we're going to play Paul Watson's
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:30.320]  report from a month and a half ago, where he was talking about exactly where this is going. Here are
[1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:36.800]  those two reports. And where do I stand on Brexit? Well, here he goes. The working class have spoke.
[1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:42.480]  And I'm one of them and I'm with them. And when you hear someone like Alistair Campbell
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:47.520]  spelling out what he thinks could be the real downside. I gave up listening to him a long time ago.
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:51.440]  But you're a US citizen now, aren't you? See, you are Trump as your leader.
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:10:00.560]  The Donald. Well, there's a complicated fella. And as one journalist once said to me,
[1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:07.920]  is he the political sex pistol? But in a way. In a way. But what I dislike is the left-wing media
[1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:13.680]  in America are trying to smear the bloke as a racist. And that's completely not true. There's many,
[1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:19.760]  many problems with him as a human being, but he's not that. And there just might be a chance that
[1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:25.840]  something good will come out of that situation because he terrifies politicians. And this is
[1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:30.080]  joy to behold. Right. I mean, that very much is the sex pistol thing, anti-establishment.
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:36.320]  He is the absolutely archetypal anti-establishment character. So dare I say, a possible friend.
[1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:41.760]  Having lost the political argument, leftists are desperately clinging to this idea
[1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:48.000]  that they have the monopoly on cool and that no countercultural movement could ever be created
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:54.320]  by the right. In fact, I've never seen so many members of the lefty Twitter arty so triggered
[1:10:54.320 --> 1:11:04.000]  as when I tweeted, conservatism is the new counterculture. So I tweeted it again and again
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:09.600]  and again and again and seriously, I know the word triggered gets overused now,
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:15.680]  but this was a deluge of butthurt. What are they so afraid of? Well, as Breitbart said, politics
[1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:20.560]  is downstream from culture. Most young people who aren't paying attention to the news get their
[1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:25.680]  opinions from celebrities. Hollywood and the entertainment industry viciously polices the
[1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:31.680]  boundaries of accepted opinion so that anyone who strays from the leftist orthodoxy is ostracized
[1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:38.160]  and excommunicated. They're all for diversity until it comes to diversity of thought and that's why
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:44.480]  celebrities are so fucking boring. None of them dare express an original opinion because if they
[1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:49.760]  did, they'd be hounded out of a career by their intolerant peers. I mean, look at Eminem. He used
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:55.520]  to be happy to offend absolutely everyone, Christians, lesbians, feminists, the gay lobby.
[1:11:55.520 --> 1:12:02.560]  Now he's calling Donald Trump a bitch. Oh, how daring. That's so controversial. I mean, it's not
[1:12:02.560 --> 1:12:08.640]  like every other virtue signaling twat in Hollywood and the music industry is doing exactly the same
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:14.320]  thing, is it? But the left is starting to lose their omnipotent control of counterculture. Why?
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:20.080]  Well, counterculture used to be intrinsically leftist because the right had political power.
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:26.400]  It was a natural counterbalance. But up until very recently, the right had been getting its ass
[1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:32.720]  kicked in the culture war for decades. So now we have a whole new generation emerging who have no
[1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:38.960]  memory whatsoever of the right being in political power or having any dominance in the culture
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:43.920]  war. All they've experienced is the left's total domination of the culture war and their
[1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:49.200]  intellectual intolerance of anyone who goes against the grain. So for teenagers and 20-somethings,
[1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:55.680]  all they've ever known is having dominant culture fed to them by the left. So it comes down to this.
[1:12:55.680 --> 1:13:01.920]  You can't be the dominant culture and the counterculture. That's why conservatism or a
[1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:07.280]  particular brand of it is becoming the new counterculture. It's a natural progression. And you
[1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:13.040]  can see this new phenomenon beginning to emerge when you look at Generation Z. Teenagers born
[1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:19.840]  after the year 2000 and the most conservative generation since World War II. 14% of 14 and
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:26.640]  15-year-olds said they had a conservative outlook compared to 2% of millennials and just 1% of Gen
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:33.920]  Xers. That's a huge difference and it's only going to grow. We're redpilling. Generation Z. The tsunami
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:40.240]  of positive messages I get from teenagers every single day telling me about how it was my videos
[1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:45.200]  that turned them from being a social justice warrior, a Black Lives Matter supporter, to becoming
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:50.880]  a conservative is staggering. They're sick to the back teeth of being forced to sit in classes about
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:58.000]  gender studies or colonialism and browbeaten about their original sin of being male, being white,
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:03.760]  or being a westerner. Young people are rebelling against this stifling safe space trigger-warning
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:10.880]  PC attitude in droves. Conservatism is the new counterculture. Why? Because progressives are
[1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:17.120]  the new Puritans. They're completely joyless and authoritarian. In the 1970s, the Christian
[1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:23.200]  Right protested to try and shut down sex pistols concerts. They called on radio stations, venues,
[1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:29.440]  and TV networks to no platform the pistols because they found them offensive. No, no. What was the
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:37.920]  word? In 2017, it's the politically correct, obsessed left that campaigns and riots to no
[1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:44.880]  platform and shut down conservatives for being offensive. The right-wing temper tantrum over
[1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:51.360]  the sex pistols back in the 70s only made the pistols more taboo, more avant-garde, and therefore
[1:14:51.360 --> 1:14:57.120]  more counterculture. And we're seeing the same effect now only in reverse. What happened after
[1:14:57.120 --> 1:15:04.400]  the Berkeley riots? Milo's book sales surged by over 12,000 percent, with the book having already
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:09.920]  skyrocketed to number one on Amazon because the left had a temper tantrum. Your joyless,
[1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:17.360]  sensorious, puritanical persecution of Milo is exactly what's turned him into a complete rock
[1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:23.840]  star. After his Twitter ban, Milo became more counterculture than ever before because Silicon
[1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:30.080]  Valley doesn't represent the counterculture. It's been in place so long now that it's the new
[1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:36.080]  establishment. Conservatism is the new punk rock. And you've only got yourselves to blame,
[1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:41.760]  you complete idiots. And obviously I don't mean conservatism like Mitch McConnell conservatism,
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:46.800]  I'm not talking about old establishment republicans. If you prefer, you can think of it as cultural
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:52.000]  libertarianism. But whatever you want to call it, this is the new counterculture. Everything that
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:58.800]  the left had has gone completely stagnant. This is the only countercultural movement that's definable,
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:05.600]  that's going anywhere that resonates with anyone. And that's why the regressive left is terrified.
[1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:10.960]  Oh yeah, and don't come at me with a bunch of obscure movements within music or popular culture
[1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:17.200]  to try and debunk me, okay? Barely anyone has ever heard of those movements. We're the ones
[1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:22.720]  who are resonating. The other thing is, I don't know what it is about this profile image, but it
[1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:28.400]  triggers the holy hell out of leftists. I was actually gonna change it for 2017, but after I
[1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:41.680]  saw how much they can't stand it, I'm keeping it forever. I also made it more triggering by adding
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:47.360]  Trump in an executive order that says, conservatism is the new counterculture. Your avatar versus what
[1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:52.560]  you really look like. Yeah, Superman versus Clark Kent. Oh yeah, and you look like this. When your
[1:16:52.560 --> 1:16:58.720]  dog is more attractive than you, probably wise to stop throwing stones from within that glass house.
[1:16:58.720 --> 1:17:03.120]  You want to talk about fake news, the state of your profile pic compared to what you actually
[1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:09.600]  look like. Oh, so you really want to turn this into a beauty contest. Okay, so we've got the likes
[1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:14.880]  of Milo, Crowder, Lauren, Marion, Tommy, and yours truly. Who've you got? Michael Moore,
[1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:25.920]  Lena Dunham, Amy Schumer, Madonna, Cenk Yuga. Yeah, good luck with that. Studies show that
[1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:30.960]  conservatives are more attractive. And that's another reason why we're taking over the counter
[1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:37.920]  culture. Because no matter how much you try and make it that way, being fat and ugly isn't cool.
[1:17:37.920 --> 1:17:44.960]  Studies also show that 92% of left-wing activists live with their parents and 90% are single. In
[1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:51.120]  other words, leftists are statistically far more likely to be complete losers who spend all day
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:57.920]  masturbating alone in their mom's basements. And that's not cool either. So when Generation Z sees
[1:17:57.920 --> 1:18:04.560]  smart, attractive, rebellious, daring, successful people pissing off the Puritans, pissing off
[1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:09.440]  the authoritarians at school who lecture them all day about what they can and can't say and how
[1:18:09.440 --> 1:18:15.440]  they should behave. Obviously, they're naturally going to be drawn to us. That's why we're resonating
[1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:23.120]  so much with young people. That's why conservatism is the new punk rock. Conservatism is the new
[1:18:23.120 --> 1:18:27.680]  counterculture.
[1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:36.880]  You know, as I'm listening to that report, when I was on vacation, my wife and I listened to
[1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:42.560]  John Cleese's autobiography. So anyway, that was the name of his autobiography. It's very,
[1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:46.880]  very funny. At the very end, what he talked about was how comedy has changed. And he said,
[1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:55.040]  two things are killing comedy. Number one, the effort to get vulgar, to try to make things work
[1:18:55.040 --> 1:19:00.160]  for you because that's what comics have resorted to, just using shock value, certain words that
[1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:02.960]  they can throw out there as triggers. The other thing is political correctness. He said, those
[1:19:02.960 --> 1:19:06.960]  two things are destroying comedy. It's destroying our society as well. And when I look at that,
[1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:11.440]  it occurred to me that the liberals have become the conservatives, haven't they?
[1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:16.800]  As Paul Watson was saying, they have controlled the narrative for a long time. The younger
[1:19:16.800 --> 1:19:22.240]  generation has seen the liberals in control, especially in the school systems where they go,
[1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:28.000]  whether it's K through 12 or especially college, they're in control. They have arbitrary censorship.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:33.360]  They have political correctness. They're defending their established order. In other words, the left
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:39.120]  are the conservatives because conservatism is defined as why I don't define myself as a
[1:19:39.120 --> 1:19:43.200]  conservative. It's maintaining the status quo no matter what. The conservatives will fight tooth
[1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:49.120]  and nail to keep the minimum wage from being raised from 750 to 950 or whatever. But they will never
[1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:54.320]  work to get rid of it on principle because they don't want to change the status quo.
[1:19:54.320 --> 1:19:58.640]  There's just this entrenched, but now the left are the people who are truly entrenched and censored.
[1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:20.640]  That was to be right back.
[1:20:29.040 --> 1:20:36.080]  this is not that. My experience with synergy one has been great. My mood is better. My joints
[1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:42.640]  feel better. I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity. My wife and I both
[1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:48.720]  noticed that we even dream more. So I recommend synergy one. It's really good stuff. I'm having
[1:20:48.720 --> 1:20:58.160]  great results with it. Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com. That's oneworldwhey.com.

[1:23:57.280 --> 1:24:14.080]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host on this March 27th,
[1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:19.680]  2017. I want to get back to this clip with Ted Coppola and Sean Hay. I've been talking about
[1:24:19.680 --> 1:24:22.880]  so much time, but actually there's another article I want to talk about before that
[1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:28.320]  about what's happening in central Florida. A small college, Rollins College, kind of touches
[1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:33.600]  on what we just heard in that last segment about the arbitrary high-handed censorship
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:39.360]  of the college establishment. So we'll get to that in just a moment. Before we do real quickly,
[1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:44.160]  I want to remind you that you can get our information uncensored by social media bots,
[1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:48.800]  uncensored by YouTube and Google. You can get that at our Infowars newsletter. You can sign up

[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:12.240]  see on the infowars.com forward slash newsletter when you sign up for that. And you'll also get our
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:17.840]  articles directly sent to you, articles of the day. Also, we have back in stock super blue,
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:22.880]  fluoride-free toothpaste. Now back in stock at infowarslife.com. It's sold out very quickly,
[1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:28.080]  and there's a good reason for it. It's one of my favorite things that we sell here. You can really
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:33.600]  feel it in your mouth. It kills the bacteria that infects your gums, that creates gum disease,
[1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:38.960]  and gum disease creates heart disease, folks. It enters your bloodstream. It causes blood clots.
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:44.240]  It causes heart attacks. It's well-known. So it's very important not only for gum health,
[1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:48.480]  for tooth health, but it's also important for cardiac health to have something that's going
[1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:53.920]  to get rid of the bacteria in your mouth. And of course, fluoride-free toothpaste, super blue,
[1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:59.120]  has peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver, and other things that are going to kill that bacteria.
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:04.560]  That's why your mouth feels so fresh when you use it. Also, because we have some kids who don't like
[1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:10.400]  the feel of the peppermint, we have a spearmint-free taste that has a bubble gum flavor. So we listen
[1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:14.640]  to you. For those of you who have kids and they want something that doesn't make their mouth tingle,
[1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:19.360]  I kind of like that. And I think most adults do, but they want something that tastes like bubble
[1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:23.200]  gum. So we have that available as well. I want to read you one of the reviews that we have at
[1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:28.000]  infoawardslife.com, because you can do this yourself, but you can go down, look at the reviews,
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:33.840]  see what people have to say. Here's one from John. It says, excellent product with superfast
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:37.120]  shipping. He said, fabulous toothpaste, very impressed with the shipping, too. I like the
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:42.160]  fact that it is fluoride-free. I put it on auto-ship to ensure a steady supply. Thanks,
[1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:46.800]  infoawardsstore. Another one from Maria says, definitely, bye again. This is the first toothpaste
[1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:52.480]  I've used that upon waking up in the morning, my teeth feel clean. I also have sensitivity using
[1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:57.200]  other toothpaste, but not with super blue. I love this product. My husband does also. Thank you.
[1:26:57.200 --> 1:27:02.320]  And as I point out, our entire family loves super blue. Glad to see it back in stock. And again,
[1:27:02.320 --> 1:27:06.560]  that person talked about auto-ship. If you want to make sure that you are never out of something,
[1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:11.200]  you can sign up for auto-ship. You get a 10% discount for what you sign up for. And if you
[1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:18.320]  set up on your auto-ship, products that equal more than $50, then you will get free shipping. So you
[1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:23.360]  pick what you want, the interval that you want it shipped, and if the order is more than $50,
[1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:28.080]  you'll get free shipping in addition to the 10% discount. All right, let's go back to the news
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:35.280]  here real quickly. This story, talking about how the liberals have taken over the university,
[1:27:35.280 --> 1:27:40.000]  how they have created this high-handed censorship and political correctness that is
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:43.600]  so disgusting, even children don't like this. And they've grown up underneath it,
[1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:49.680]  and so they're rebelling against it. And when we look at this, we understand that it is really,
[1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:53.760]  I think, the liberals who become the conservatives. They are going to dictate the terms to you. They
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:58.960]  are going to set up, and they have set up this regime, and they're going to fight intensely
[1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:04.400]  against anybody who tries to change anything. So it's kind of a natural that youth would rebel
[1:28:04.400 --> 1:28:09.600]  against this. This is what creates that pendulum swing, that cycle that we talk about with the
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:13.760]  fourth turning, the cycle of seasons and generations and so forth. But let me tell you the specifics
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:17.200]  of this case. You're not going to believe this. This is a small college, Rollins College that's
[1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:21.680]  in Central Florida, close to Orlando, where there was recently the shooting. This is a
[1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:27.440]  Christian conservative student who challenged a liberal Muslim professor, a radicalized Muslim
[1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:31.520]  student also was part of this, who when they were talking about Shreya Law said, well, I think for
[1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:36.480]  homosexuals and others, basically they need to have gays, adulterers and thieves. We need to
[1:28:36.480 --> 1:28:42.240]  remove certain body parts under Shreya Law. This guy complained about this to the professor.
[1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:50.720]  He wrote his essay. She failed him. And then she went to the administration
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:56.960]  and complained about him and shut down the course. I'm not going to even have the course here,
[1:28:56.960 --> 1:29:01.920]  because this guy and then even went to file a complaint with the police. I mean, this is
[1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:08.720]  absolutely amazing. That's how sensitive she is to this, saying this is a hate speech to question
[1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:13.040]  my authority, to question what I say about this. And of course, what she was saying,
[1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:18.800]  that he questioned was the fact that the crucifixion of Jesus was a hoax. And he says, well,
[1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:22.800]  you may believe that, but we believe otherwise. And for you to present that as established
[1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:27.200]  fact is not legitimate. So because of that, she says, well, I'm going to fail you. I'm going to
[1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:31.680]  shut down the course. I'm going to file a police complaint against you. We're going to have that.
[1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:38.800]  That's the way they react, because they cannot stand anybody to question them.
[1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:42.480]  And we're going to come back. And I really am going to get to this back and forth between Ted
[1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:47.120]  Koppel and Sean Hannity, because Ted Koppel is another example of somebody who can't stand someone
[1:29:47.120 --> 1:29:54.240]  challenging him on the facts. We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN
[1:29:54.240 --> 1:30:03.120]  radio network. More fallout from the London ISIS terror attack as it is being reported on again
[1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:08.080]  that ISIS is using YouTube as a platform to put out violent recruitment videos as propaganda to
[1:30:08.080 --> 1:30:12.160]  further their religious caliphate. It is said that the London terrorist thug was using WhatsApp to
[1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:16.560]  send his final messages. But Scotland Yard and other investigative authorities cannot access these
[1:30:16.560 --> 1:30:20.640]  messages because WhatsApp itself says it cannot retrieve them. This again creates the battle
[1:30:20.640 --> 1:30:25.760]  between media platforms, consumers protected privacy and government's access into such databases.
[1:30:25.760 --> 1:30:30.480]  But what really needs to be asked, how does YouTube allow ISIS to operate on its platform
[1:30:30.480 --> 1:30:36.080]  when some info wars videos have been removed for content? You're telling me no one from the FBI
[1:30:36.080 --> 1:30:41.440]  or nothing from the CIA vault seven technologies can be used to track down whoever is posting these
[1:30:41.440 --> 1:30:45.920]  terrorist recruitment videos. It seems to me that we not only have a terrorist problem, we have a
[1:30:45.920 --> 1:30:51.440]  priority problem enabling these terrorists to operate online where conservative media is targeted
[1:30:51.440 --> 1:30:56.320]  before Islamic terrorist hate speech. This is Owen Schreuer for the more scrutinized by YouTube

[1:33:15.280 --> 1:33:28.640]  It's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. We were talking about
[1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:36.000]  the pushback against Sean Hannity by Ted Koppel how they rigged this thing. But I think it's
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:40.320]  very important to look at the essence of this discussion that they're having here. Sean Hannity
[1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:47.200]  says well, American people can understand the difference between just simply reporting the
[1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:51.760]  news, the facts of the news and an analysis of the news. And they can understand when you do
[1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:55.200]  one. They can understand when you do the other. They can understand when you combine the two.
[1:33:55.200 --> 1:34:00.400]  Ted Koppel says no, no, no. You've replaced facts with ideology. Well, quite frankly,
[1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:07.440]  I don't know. But I was at the DNC this summer and I remember walking up to DNC Rep after DNC Rep
[1:34:07.440 --> 1:34:13.280]  and talking to them about Hillary Clinton's emails which were out there, thanks to WikiLeaks,
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:19.200]  showing that they had rigged, the DNC had plotted with her to rig the election against
[1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:22.400]  Bernie Sanders and they just didn't want to hear it. They just didn't want to hear it.
[1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:28.080]  You talk about something being ideologically based and not factual based. You couldn't,
[1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:34.400]  they would not respond to that information. It was a fact. It was an established fact.
[1:34:34.400 --> 1:34:38.000]  We have a lot of facts that they don't want to hear because they're ideology. But of course,
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:43.920]  he's saying that if you do any analysis that that now is fake news and that's the way that
[1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:49.760]  they want to spin this. And the way this is now coming out is a story that Kit Daniels has put
[1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:54.640]  out. He just handed this to me. Where did I put that? Basically that they're going to set up a
[1:34:54.640 --> 1:34:59.040]  continuity of government. Here we go. Deep State Moles continuity of government plan to overthrow
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:03.280]  Trump. And what they're talking about is in fact, well, we know the election was hacked.
[1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:09.120]  But therefore, if we find out that the Russians had something to do with this, and let's pause here
[1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:15.840]  for a second, folks. They have been putting this out there since last summer. If there was anything
[1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:20.160]  at all there, then they would have found it. And believe me, they would be so eager to let
[1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:24.880]  everybody know the very fact that you haven't heard anything. You haven't heard any facts, have you?
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:29.760]  So what we're seeing here is this attack on Donald Trump truly is ideologically based.
[1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:36.160]  That truly is a lot of spin and allegation with no substance whatsoever. Because if they had any
[1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:42.160]  substance, you know that they would have immediately released anything that they had. So the dog that
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:46.560]  didn't bark is the thing that you need to pay attention to here. But they want to keep going
[1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:50.960]  with this Russian hacker thing and then take it to the next step. And the guy says, well,
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:55.760]  if this election was stolen, then Pence's place as president would be no more legitimate than
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:36:00.000]  that of Trump. And so we need to really start looking at rolling this whole thing back and
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:06.320]  changing everybody. The voters collective desires were subverted by foreign interference and a
[1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:11.440]  party's collusion. None of this would have a legitimate claim, especially since control
[1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:14.640]  the Senate at least would have been affected by the Russian rule. So we got to undo all the
[1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:18.880]  Republicans merely on allegation, without any facts whatsoever.
[1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:25.120]  Merely on an ideological attack. That's the amazing thing about this. And this just continues to go,
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:28.320]  because we've got people like Ted Koppel in the New York Times, these other people who even when
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:32.000]  they report that there's wiretapping, they want to pretend that that didn't happen. So let's listen
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.520]  to this back and forth between Ted Koppel and Sean Hannity.
[1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:40.880]  We have to give some credit to the American people that they're somewhat intelligent and that they
[1:36:40.880 --> 1:36:45.760]  know the difference between an opinion show and a news show. You're cynical, look at it.
[1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:51.920]  I am cynical because you think we're bad for America? You think I'm bad for America? Yeah,
[1:36:51.920 --> 1:36:58.080]  you do. In the in the long haul, I think you and all these opinion shows. That's sad Ted. No,
[1:36:58.080 --> 1:37:04.240]  you know why? That's sad. Because you're very good at what you do and because you have you have
[1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:13.280]  attracted a significantly more intelligent, let me finish the sentence. Homelessly you do that.
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:24.080]  With all due respect. You have attracted people who are determined that ideology is more important
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:31.120]  than facts. Did you hear that? You hear how Ted Koppel, don't defend yourself. Let me put this
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:34.720]  out there. And what they did was they had a 45 minute interview that they cut down to two minutes.
[1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:39.520]  And Sean Hannity said, I challenge you, I dare you to put out the full 45 minutes.
[1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:43.840]  Because I pointed out earlier that's why Alex Jones won't talk to those people. Because you know
[1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:48.000]  going in that they're going to edit this thing. They're going to and we've seen this happen so
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:54.160]  many times. We've seen this happen. I remember Katie Couric and how they took those people with
[1:37:54.160 --> 1:37:58.480]  the gun control focus group and they asked them a question and they made it appear as if nobody
[1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:03.280]  had an answer for it and they did. They immediately had an answer but they and somebody recorded that.
[1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:07.600]  They did have the full interview there so they could show how they were lying to people with
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:12.080]  their editing. So they asked this question and they show these people just sitting there in the
[1:38:12.080 --> 1:38:15.840]  audience as B-roll where they were listening to somebody. But they made it look like they had no
[1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:20.400]  answer and he makes it look like Sean Hannity doesn't have an answer. Sean Hannity did have an
[1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:25.440]  answer. What Ted Koppel is doing, what the mainstream media is doing, with this continuity of
[1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:29.200]  government story that we got up at Infowars.com, what they're doing is they're putting out an
[1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:35.360]  unproven allegation that they've been hitting on now for nearly a year and they don't have anything,
[1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:39.920]  nothing at all. Even the idea that there was a Russian hack, what they're implying is that the
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:44.320]  Russians somehow flipped these electronic voting machines. You know what? If that hasn't happened
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:47.680]  with a foreign government or if that hasn't happened with an internal government, it will.
[1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:52.400]  The people who hacked our machines were Homeland Security and now they're saying we have a right
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:57.680]  to do it in the future. We need to get rid of their capability to do that and by doing that
[1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:00.960]  means we get rid of the voting machines. That's one of the key things that has to be done and
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:05.520]  we're not going to win any more elections. We're going to have them just flip this. We will have
[1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:11.200]  hacked elections and they'll be hacked out of the DNC and DC is where they're going to be hacking
[1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:15.600]  them from. It's not going to be from the Kremlin. They're going to be doing it out of Washington,
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:20.240]  DC with Homeland Security. So we need to get rid of the voting machines. But remember when we had
[1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:27.760]  that dog and pony show from James Comey, I think it was Devin Nunes, somebody, maybe I'm wrong
[1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:31.840]  on the person who asked him, but went down state by state. So did you see any evidence of vote
[1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:35.280]  tampering in this state, this state, this state? No, no, no, no, didn't see any of that.
[1:39:35.920 --> 1:39:40.400]  That's what they're implying though. But see when you get right back to it, they're saying, well,
[1:39:40.400 --> 1:39:48.000]  the Russians or somebody won the minds of the American people. And we did that because we
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:54.960]  presented the facts and then we did an analysis of the facts. These people, you want to talk about
[1:39:54.960 --> 1:40:00.400]  ideology, let's talk about modernism versus postmodernism. Okay, the people that I talked to
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:06.960]  at the DNC, at the Democrat convention that last summer and a lot of them were part of the DNC.
[1:40:07.840 --> 1:40:12.880]  But the people that I talked to, they came from a postmodern point of view. They didn't believe
[1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:16.000]  that there was such a thing as facts or they believe that they had their facts. You had your
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:21.760]  facts and their facts were just as valid as your facts were. When we talk about modernism,
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:27.200]  modernism was the idea that there was a truth. And that we could discover that truth by debate.
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:34.400]  And by analysis, postmodernism rejected all that, turned to subjectivity, just opinion.
[1:40:34.400 --> 1:40:40.880]  That is the basis for academia today. That's the basis for education. Common core is a reflection
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:45.760]  of that postmodernist thinking. That's why we got to get the government out of education.
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:50.400]  The Department of Education needs to be shut down, just like we got to repeal Obamacare. So
[1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:53.600]  there's a lot of things that need to be shut down. And that gets to the essence of it. But I
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:57.600]  wanted to give you another example of this and the arrogance of the left. I want to play a clip
[1:40:57.600 --> 1:41:04.800]  for you of Nancy Pelosi clashing with some of her activists who think that she's too conservative for
[1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:11.440]  them. So it's not just the, not all the people who are young, obviously, we see a lot of social
[1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:18.000]  justice warriors out there who for them, facts don't mean anything. All they want to do is repeat
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:23.280]  this ideology that they've heard, the ideology that racist, sexist, homophobic. They just want
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:28.080]  to repeat that all the time, xenophobic. So everybody that disagrees with them, that's all
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:34.240]  they do is just shout that at you. They come out that the abortion protest here in Austin,
[1:41:34.240 --> 1:41:38.400]  they don't have any signs of their own. They have black sheets that they want to hold up over your
[1:41:38.400 --> 1:41:45.520]  speech. So they don't have, they don't want to debate. They don't have an opinion on things.
[1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:50.240]  They don't want to analyze things. They just simply want to shut you down. And that's what they do
[1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:56.560]  when they shout that you're a racist, sexist, homophobe, so forth. And now Nancy Pelosi is
[1:41:56.560 --> 1:42:02.080]  getting a taste of that as well. Let's play this clip of Nancy Pelosi clashing with her liberal
[1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:09.440]  constituents. Well, I have, as I said to my colleagues, I was on the streets holding signs
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:18.880]  for single payer 30 years ago before I went to Congress. But, sorry, that they had affordable
[1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:26.160]  care act in certain respects. We have gone to the left of Medicare for all. Medicare, yes, yes, yes.
[1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:32.880]  Do you want to listen or do you just want to speak? Let her speak please. We tried to mitigate for
[1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:39.120]  not getting single payer or public option by putting as many benefits in the bill as possible.
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:46.720]  And one of them, and listen up, one of them is catastrophic coverage. And so we think that
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:43:00.720]  there was- I have always supported that. I have been supporting it before you were born.
[1:43:00.720 --> 1:43:11.840]  Yes, that's right. She has bona fide credentials as a central control socialist single payer system.
[1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:15.280]  And if you want to know how that's going to work out, you can go down to Venezuela. And a lot of
[1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:19.360]  those people there who are jeering her supported Bernie Sanders economics. And of course, Bernie
[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:23.440]  Sanders, I used to call him Bernie Sandernista because he went down to Nicaragua 30 years ago,
[1:43:23.440 --> 1:43:27.280]  and he hasn't pulled back from that. He supported those people of their communist revolution. If
[1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:31.360]  you want to know how that turned out, the history is written for you. You can see how it destroyed
[1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:36.080]  their country, how it's destroyed Venezuela. You can see the fact that they went into nationalized
[1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:41.920]  companies and then took possession of that themselves. And when those kleptocrats, which
[1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:47.120]  is really what socialists are, when those kleptocrats who said that they were taking control of all
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:52.720]  this for the people, they took personal control of it. And as they put together a coalition of
[1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:58.400]  people left and right from libertarians to socialists to throw out those kleptocrat criminals,
[1:43:58.400 --> 1:44:03.360]  what did they do? Well, they privatized them then, okay? So the stuff that they had stolen
[1:44:03.360 --> 1:44:08.320]  for state operation, they then privatized and put themselves in as the owners of that property.
[1:44:08.320 --> 1:44:13.760]  That's the way this all works. It's just an excuse for criminality. Let's take a look at what else
[1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:20.640]  is happening here. And of course, that is the war on terror. An article that's up on info wars.com,
[1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:25.360]  From the Sun, British special forces are now deploying to London streets permanently
[1:44:25.360 --> 1:44:31.280]  after these terrorist attacks. That's the SAS troops. Their elite forces are now going to be
[1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:37.200]  on the street. And as they point out in the subtitle on our story, the police state is expanding
[1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:44.480]  through problem reaction solution. See, they're not going to solve the problem. They created
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:51.360]  the problem so they could usher in their pre-planned solution. Here's an example of this. The
[1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:57.360]  Westminster killer that we just had this last event using a car, using a knife to kill people.
[1:44:57.360 --> 1:45:02.400]  And then shot by gun. And of course, that was reported by CNN. There was a firearm incident
[1:45:02.400 --> 1:45:09.600]  in London. No, there was a Muslim incident in London. Okay, this guy had been flagged by MI5
[1:45:09.600 --> 1:45:20.320]  in 2010 as an extremist. Did they do anything about it? No, no. This is a metaphor for the
[1:45:20.320 --> 1:45:25.680]  entire situation. It's not just one individual that we know as an extremist. We know the Muslims
[1:45:25.680 --> 1:45:29.680]  that they're bringing in are extremists, but they're not going to do anything about that problem.
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:35.360]  Instead, what they'll do is turn us into an armed militarized camp. Here's one from Germany.
[1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:39.920]  Police warned a Berlin attacker as a terrorist threat nine months before the assault.
[1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:44.400]  Terrorist sent messages that he was planning an attack. Did they do anything? No.
[1:45:45.200 --> 1:45:51.840]  They let him drive that truck through the Christmas market, killing over 100 people,
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:55.920]  I believe, if I remember the number correct. There's been so many of these terrorist attacks.
[1:45:55.920 --> 1:46:01.360]  I can't remember the death tolls from the individual ones. Meanwhile, what we have in
[1:46:01.360 --> 1:46:06.800]  Germany is still going on. We've got Syrian refugees in the German streets chanting,
[1:46:06.800 --> 1:46:12.560]  Allahu Akbar. What else? Why else wouldn't they be doing that? They don't appreciate
[1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:17.280]  the fact that they're here. That's why I said the people who are going to be the most dangerous ones
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:22.720]  are going to be the second generation, even more dangerous than the 1 tenth of 1 percent
[1:46:22.720 --> 1:46:27.040]  that they come in of the 1 million people. You want to bring in 10,000 terrorists or whatever?
[1:46:27.040 --> 1:46:34.560]  You can't screen these people 100%. If we're going to be going to war with these countries
[1:46:34.560 --> 1:46:38.480]  and then bringing them in without any vetting, we don't want to have extreme vetting
[1:46:38.480 --> 1:46:42.160]  with people who are coming in from the war zones that we're going to war with. There's
[1:46:42.160 --> 1:46:46.480]  something wrong with that, isn't there? Can't you see regardless of which side of the issue
[1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:50.480]  you come down on this? If you say there's nothing wrong with these people, we ought to let them all
[1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:55.600]  come in. Then you ought to be arguing to stop the wars that Obama created. He stepped that up.
[1:46:55.600 --> 1:46:59.200]  He was at war, first president to be at war the entire eight years that he was president.
[1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:05.040]  He stepped up the number of countries that we were at war with to seven. Why wasn't the left
[1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:08.480]  talking about that? If they want to bring these people in with open arms, don't kill them in
[1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:13.120]  their own country. Then you won't have to bring them in. But they wouldn't talk about that.
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:18.800]  And instead, they'll let the slaughter in these countries continue. And then they will say,
[1:47:18.800 --> 1:47:22.480]  but we don't want to have any control over the people that come in. Just bring everybody in.
[1:47:22.480 --> 1:47:27.760]  No problem. Bring everybody in. And you realize that if you have the 1% of these people,
[1:47:27.760 --> 1:47:30.720]  you bring in a million of them, you're talking like, what is that, 10,000 or something?
[1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:36.480]  Anyway, let's look at what Al Gore says a real problem is. So the problem is not
[1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:43.360]  creating a problem and then doing a solution to this. No, no, no. That's not the problem. The
[1:47:43.360 --> 1:47:50.880]  problem is, as Al Gore says with everything, the problem is climate change. See, if the only tool
[1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:55.840]  you've got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And everything looks like climate change
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:48:00.960]  to Al Gore. This is from James Dullingpole. And this is, of course, the sequel that Al Gore is
[1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:06.880]  now pushing, an inconvenient sequel, Truth to Power. Well, it really is a convenient
[1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:12.400]  sequel for him. And it's lies about power. It's lies about power, both political and electrical.
[1:48:13.760 --> 1:48:19.520]  These are the lies that he's telling us. And he says it all began in Syria. And he's got,
[1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:24.160]  as Dullingpole points out, a lavishly complex climate conspiracy theory.
[1:48:25.280 --> 1:48:31.600]  And what he says is, the gates of hell opened in Syria with a drought. It had nothing to do
[1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:36.560]  with our government saying that we're going to have regime change, that we're going to set
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:43.040]  countries on fire. It had nothing to do with Libya. It had nothing to do with Afghanistan or Iraq.
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:46.480]  It had nothing to do with any of that stuff. It had nothing to do with us deciding that
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:52.480]  we're going to do regime change, come hell or high water. And if you want to believe that,
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:57.120]  then explain why Madeleine Albright, when questioned about whether or not
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:01.600]  sanctions in Iraq were worth the death of a half million children, she said, yeah, sure.
[1:49:02.160 --> 1:49:07.200]  Yeah, sorry about that. But now our political goals are worth the death of a half million
[1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:12.800]  Muslim children. And that's what they did at that time. And that was even before they started a war.
[1:49:12.800 --> 1:49:19.920]  So you think, though, that he's trying to tell us that it was not the sanctions. It wasn't regime
[1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:25.040]  change. It wasn't setting these countries on fire. It wasn't using al-Qaeda and ISIS as our
[1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:31.360]  surrogates for regime change. No, it was climate change. It was an extreme drought. And that drought
[1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:36.880]  caused so many people to have so many problems that they then had, we now have to bring them
[1:49:36.880 --> 1:49:41.360]  into our country. And so that's not a problem. We just need to turn over control of our economy
[1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:45.840]  to Al Gore. And then that'll start, stop the root cause of everything, according to Al Gore,
[1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:51.360]  which is climate change. He says, that's the root cause of everything. I want to talk about what
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:56.000]  happened and where this is all going. We've talked about the civil war that is developing,
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:59.600]  not only politically, but in other ways, we talked about the mass exodus side of the cities,
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:03.440]  because people are realizing how dangerous these things could be. But they don't want you to get
[1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:08.160]  out of the city. One of the reasons, one of the ways that they're keeping people in the cities,
[1:50:08.160 --> 1:50:11.760]  that they plan on keeping people in the cities, is to make sure that you don't own a car.
[1:50:12.880 --> 1:50:16.400]  That if you do own a car, that you're going to be gradually pushed out of that car
[1:50:16.400 --> 1:50:20.160]  into a self-driving car. So when you look at this accident this last weekend,
[1:50:20.800 --> 1:50:26.000]  and they were quick to point out that it was failure to yield right away for the Uber car.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:33.680]  The human car was the one that created this problem. And as I said yesterday, wired magazine
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:38.080]  instantly jumps in on this. And you can see this repeating pattern. Remember, it was wired magazine
[1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:42.560]  in their danger blog five years ago that pointed out that Petraeus said the Internet of Things is
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:46.800]  going to be used to have your appliances spy on you. When Kellyanne Conway talked about that,
[1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:51.920]  wired magazine said, no Kellyanne, your appliances aren't spying on you. That's the way they have
[1:50:51.920 --> 1:50:55.680]  changed. And they're doing the same thing with self-driving cars. I'll tell you about that when
[1:50:55.680 --> 1:51:02.640]  we return. Stay with it. They say you can't take on the man and win. That one small company doesn't
[1:51:02.640 --> 1:51:07.280]  stand a chance against the corporate behemoths with all their money and lawyers. But they don't
[1:51:07.280 --> 1:51:13.520]  know Harry's. How's Harry's done it? Simple. By owning the factory and selling directly to you.
[1:51:13.520 --> 1:51:18.720]  Harry's sells their incredible razor blades online. They ship directly from their site to you and do
[1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:23.840]  it for a lot less. And while those other guys rake in huge profits, Harry's passes the savings
[1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:30.240]  directly back to you. The result? A quality shave and more money in your pocket. Don't believe it?

[1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:13.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. I want to talk about
[1:54:13.040 --> 1:54:18.160]  where we're headed in terms of as we try to get out of the city as they want to try to keep us in.
[1:54:18.160 --> 1:54:22.800]  That's agenda 21. There's a 2030 agenda for sustainability. It's the UN agenda. Both of
[1:54:22.800 --> 1:54:28.160]  those are UN agenda. And how are they going to enact that against the wishes of the people? We
[1:54:28.160 --> 1:54:32.560]  had a story that was on the Drudge Report today talking about the mass exodus out of the city's
[1:54:33.200 --> 1:54:38.080]  66,000 people leaving the Chicago area moving to rural areas because they're afraid of what's
[1:54:38.080 --> 1:54:42.320]  going to happen with a societal breakdown. We have a very fragile infrastructure. It's very
[1:54:42.320 --> 1:54:46.880]  complicated and that makes it very fragile. So one of the things that you need to keep in mind,
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:51.920]  this is the last day too that we have for our select storable food. We have it 30 to 40% off
[1:54:51.920 --> 1:54:58.960]  at infowarsstore.com. 30 to 40% off infowars select storable food. And again, that is food that is
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:05.520]  made in the USA. It has a shelf life of 25 years. You can buy that now at this discounted price to
[1:55:05.520 --> 1:55:11.920]  help smooth out price fluctuations and supply of food as well as to provide for yourself in the
[1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:17.280]  case of a climate emergency. If Al Gore is right and all of a sudden everything else,
[1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:22.240]  or if you have a hurricane, if one day the national weather system is right and you have a
[1:55:22.240 --> 1:55:26.800]  hurricane that is the magnitude they say it's going to be or a storm that is the magnitude
[1:55:26.800 --> 1:55:31.440]  they say it's going to be for a hurricane, then you'll be prepared. Or if the grid goes out,
[1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:35.920]  whatever. It's a good time to prepare for yourself, to give yourself independence from
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:42.720]  price fluctuations so that you're not subject to the vagaries of manipulated easily manipulated
[1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:46.000]  markets. And of course you can see that today and what's happening with the stock market. They can
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:50.960]  pump stuff up and they can take it down and there can be real causes for that or it can be totally
[1:55:50.960 --> 1:55:56.000]  manufactured. But right now we have 30 to 40% off infowars like storable food. This is the last
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:00.800]  day that you'll find for that. Also, make sure that you sign up for our free newsletter if you

[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:29.600]  increasingly what is happening. And what I was talking about was this situation with Uber.
[1:56:30.160 --> 1:56:33.840]  The fact that there was this accident that looked pretty bad when you saw the picture of it. The
[1:56:33.840 --> 1:56:38.320]  Uber car was on its side. They say, well, no, it wasn't really a problem for Uber. It was the human.
[1:56:38.320 --> 1:56:43.840]  And that is the pack that Wired Magazine is taking. Just as I said, they were the ones who talked
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:48.400]  about Petraeus bragging about using the internet of things in your home. All your appliances,
[1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:54.240]  anything that has a connection to the internet they can use to spy on you, especially if it has
[1:56:54.240 --> 1:56:59.040]  some kind of a microphone so that you can give voice commands to it or if it's hooked up to an app
[1:56:59.040 --> 1:57:04.160]  so that you can control this thing remote control, then they can use that to monitor you. Even if
[1:57:04.160 --> 1:57:06.960]  they're not listening to your voice, even if they're not taking a picture of you, just the
[1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:10.480]  fact that it is hooked up to the internet, they can start monitoring your behavior patterns and
[1:57:10.480 --> 1:57:18.000]  so forth. And that is something that they're very interested in doing. The national geospatial
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:22.960]  intelligence agency is growing by leaps and bounds. I've got a story about that here as well.
[1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:26.400]  You need to understand the implication of that, but they pushed back on that when Kellyanne
[1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:30.880]  Conway talked about it. Now they're pushing back against the idea that we have human drivers
[1:57:30.880 --> 1:57:35.600]  with a problem. They say the Uber self-driving crash in Tempe, Arizona is a reminder of human
[1:57:35.600 --> 1:57:42.480]  terribleness, human terribleness. Yeah, driving itself, it had the right of way and it bears no
[1:57:42.480 --> 1:57:50.080]  blame. That's what they said. So the cars that are created by humans because they're big multinational
[1:57:50.080 --> 1:57:53.600]  corporations that are heavily subsidized by the government, they bear no responsibility
[1:57:53.600 --> 1:57:58.400]  because they're going to be tools of surveillance, tools of control in the future. So they can do
[1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:03.680]  no wrong. I've got another article here of a guy saying that they're going to be superhuman, safe,
[1:58:03.680 --> 1:58:07.600]  and nobody is going to die. And of course, we were told that about Volvo was overselling that
[1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:10.960]  as well. They were saying, we're not going to have any more traffic fatalities anymore.
[1:58:11.920 --> 1:58:15.040]  Nobody is going to die. Well, that's what they're putting out there. But you know, the reality of
[1:58:15.040 --> 1:58:21.280]  this is that Uber has people in the cars because they have to take over control of the car every
[1:58:21.280 --> 1:58:28.240]  0.8 miles. And every 100 to 200 miles, according to documents that were caught by recode,
[1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:36.000]  they found that every 100 to 200 miles, they had a potential for a $5,000 accident or a traffic
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:39.920]  fatality by hitting a pedestrian. That's the reality of it. Stay with us and be right back.

[1:58:46.400 --> 1:58:55.280]  This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new
[1:58:55.280 --> 1:58:59.840]  off the grid products of 2017. And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[1:58:59.840 --> 1:59:04.080]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science,
[1:59:04.080 --> 1:59:08.160]  one of our oldest sponsors. The PPX is so small, you can put it in your pocket,
[1:59:08.160 --> 1:59:13.040]  but so powerful, you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator,
[1:59:13.040 --> 1:59:17.520]  so you can keep food from spoiling. Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks,
[1:59:17.520 --> 1:59:21.520]  buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes. The system provides an endless
[1:59:21.520 --> 1:59:25.680]  supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid,
[1:59:25.680 --> 1:59:29.760]  literally anywhere in the world. Perfect for cabins, remote locations,
[1:59:29.760 --> 1:59:34.160]  any time you need to get off the grid for a while. Go to privatepowergrid.com

[2:00:13.520 --> 2:00:22.560]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:28.080 --> 2:00:31.040]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I want to finish up what I was talking about,
[2:00:31.600 --> 2:00:38.880]  where we are going in terms of Agenda 21, in terms of the Smith of the totally safe
[2:00:38.880 --> 2:00:42.080]  self-driving car. Anybody that's worked with computers understands that they're no better
[2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:46.320]  than the people who program them. But the public is not being told that story. Instead,
[2:00:46.320 --> 2:00:50.880]  we're being lied to by Wired Magazine saying, the problem are these terrible humans.
[2:00:51.680 --> 2:00:58.160]  Terrible humans need to be taken out of the equation. And so the reality that Recode,
[2:00:58.160 --> 2:01:04.000]  which is a tech publication, got documents out of Uber and they said, look at what's
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:09.440]  happening here. They've driven 20,000-some-odd miles and the cars had to be taken over every
[2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:14.320]  single mile by a human behind the wheel. Now, they're not doing as well as Waymo.
[2:01:14.320 --> 2:01:22.560]  Waymo is doing better, but still no prize there. Because they still have these disengagement,
[2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:27.920]  as they call them, where they're going to crash or fail. And we keep seeing this with Tesla when
[2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:35.920]  they go into automatic mode. And yet, I have this article here from Electric, another cheerleader
[2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:40.880]  of this saying, the Tesla Model 3 will give superhuman safety to the driver
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:46.000]  and be 10 times safer than current cars, says a Tesla analyst, Adam Jonas.
[2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:54.800]  Okay, let's have a reality check here. I remember when atomic power was being sold to us back in
[2:01:54.800 --> 2:02:02.880]  the 1960s. And I remember reading all the stuff coming out of Oak Ridge Labs. I was soaking all
[2:02:02.880 --> 2:02:08.800]  of that stuff up with somebody who loved technology. And I remember them saying how safe and effective
[2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:12.800]  nuclear power was going to be. It was going to be so cheap, you wouldn't even monitor it.
[2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:19.440]  You wouldn't even meter it. And that's the fantasy utopia that they're selling is. Here's the reality,
[2:02:19.440 --> 2:02:24.320]  folks. They don't want to maintain our infrastructure. But even more importantly,
[2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:30.160]  they don't want you to have the anonymous ability to move about freely. It's part of getting rid
[2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:34.720]  of cash. They want a cashless society. They want to be able to monitor your every movement with
[2:02:34.720 --> 2:02:39.360]  these cars. They don't want you to own anything. They want you to rent everything from them,
[2:02:39.360 --> 2:02:42.800]  including the roads. They're not going to build any new roads unless they can get toll roads.
[2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:48.160]  Here's an example of this. Omaha, Nebraska residents are outraged as the city is turning
[2:02:48.160 --> 2:02:53.040]  their roads now to gravel. How's that for a metaphor of what they're doing in our country?
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:02:56.960]  The residents of Omaha, Nebraska are seriously unhappy about the fact that the city is turning
[2:02:56.960 --> 2:03:01.600]  their asphalt streets into dirt and gravel roads according to New York Times. Several decades ago,
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:04.640]  a developer made the decision to save money by paving hundreds of miles of streets on the
[2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:09.280]  outskirts of Omaha with asphalt overlay instead of concrete, meaning that the roads are not
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:12.560]  built to the city standards. So they said, we don't want to maintain these things. Instead,
[2:03:12.560 --> 2:03:17.840]  we're just going to crush them and put gravel out. And if you look at the pictures that they've
[2:03:17.840 --> 2:03:26.000]  got here of people trudging through the muddy gravel roads and the potholes that are in it,
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:30.320]  and the deteriorating roads, this is our deteriorating infrastructure. This is not even Detroit.
[2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:35.760]  The place that used to be the most prosperous area in the country, Detroit, Michigan, now,
[2:03:36.720 --> 2:03:42.080]  is a monument to Democrat policies. They've turned it into a North American version of Venezuela.
[2:03:42.640 --> 2:03:46.960]  But it's happening in Republican Omaha and Nebraska because they don't want to maintain
[2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:53.840]  our infrastructure. And they don't want to maintain our freedom and our ability to move
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:58.800]  around anonymously. They want to confine us to the cities, and this is the way they do it.
[2:03:59.440 --> 2:04:04.240]  They set up a control grid. They're going to mandate boxes. First step is to mandate boxes
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:08.640]  on your cars. They call it talking cars. And that is vehicle-to-vehicle communication.
[2:04:09.520 --> 2:04:14.000]  And of course, that will work better for the cars that are connected in that network. But then,
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:18.480]  of course, you are going to be the unknown problem in the equation. They're going to have to get you
[2:04:18.480 --> 2:04:22.800]  out of that equation. You know what they talk about? Self-driving cars on autopilot.
[2:04:22.800 --> 2:04:27.360]  That is never going to work as long as there's any humans anywhere close to it. Just had a near
[2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:33.600]  miss with Prince Charles' helicopter because of a drone. You can't put... Autopilot only works
[2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:37.760]  when you've got airplanes, and they keep tens of thousands of feet between each other, and vertically
[2:04:37.760 --> 2:04:42.720]  and horizontally in every direction. You can't drive cars in close quarter with autopilot,
[2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:47.600]  so they're going to have to remove you out of the equation. And they're happy to do that
[2:04:47.600 --> 2:04:52.880]  because it's part of control. It's part of Agenda 21. Stay with us to be right back.
[2:05:17.760 --> 2:05:22.240]  $1,000,000 non-profit called OpenAI to work for safer AI in the future. It's no surprise that
[2:05:22.240 --> 2:05:27.760]  Hassabis and Ray Kurzweil would disagree. Both are working on Google AI projects. Hassabis project
[2:05:27.760 --> 2:05:32.720]  is called Deep Mind, and Kurzweil is collaborating on a project called Google Brain. But Musk is
[2:05:32.720 --> 2:05:37.280]  taking a different approach with OpenAI, wanting the technology to be shared with the world rather
[2:05:37.280 --> 2:05:41.040]  than the algorithms be in the hands of a few elites in government and the tech industry.
[2:05:41.040 --> 2:05:45.440]  Musk has also said he wants to be able to get to Mars in case AI destroys Earth. Meanwhile,
[2:05:45.440 --> 2:05:49.760]  Mark Zuckerberg is having tea with his artificial intelligence butler. The real fact of the matter
[2:05:49.760 --> 2:05:54.640]  is that AI is already here. The question is, will it ever attain self-realization? And what would
[2:05:54.640 --> 2:06:01.440]  that mean for humans? For Infowars.com, I'm Owen Schreuer. Today, we call it bone broth. And for
[2:06:01.440 --> 2:06:06.080]  thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern
[2:06:06.080 --> 2:06:11.600]  diets of processed junk. We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLife.com, the ultimate and
[2:06:11.600 --> 2:06:17.600]  true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom, and seven total primal
[2:06:17.600 --> 2:06:23.040]  superfoods in a single great tasting formula. Caveman. It's those people living in the wilds
[2:06:23.040 --> 2:06:27.360]  having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors. And we need to do everything
[2:06:27.360 --> 2:06:32.880]  we can to recapture that. Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat
[2:06:32.880 --> 2:06:38.160]  for sustenance, the fat for cooking. But you used the bones for strength, for the outside
[2:06:38.160 --> 2:06:42.640]  structure, full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[2:06:42.640 --> 2:06:48.240]  This is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were,
[2:06:48.240 --> 2:06:52.160]  but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were,
[2:06:52.160 --> 2:06:55.040]  and this is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check out Caveman,
[2:06:55.040 --> 2:07:09.120]  ultimate paleo formula for yourself in InfowarsLife.com today.
[2:07:25.120 --> 2:07:30.240]  your children through the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning
[2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:35.520]  our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects
[2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:41.200]  for themselves. The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure breeze would be a steel at $300,
[2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:46.960]  $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system
[2:07:46.960 --> 2:07:51.040]  I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that
[2:07:51.040 --> 2:07:55.920]  didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then

[2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:30.800]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Monday, March 27, 2017. You have an article up on Infowars
[2:08:30.800 --> 2:08:37.760] Life.com from zero hedge. Trump headed Merkel a $375 billion invoice for NATO defense during
[2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:43.360]  her recent visit. I love the picture of Jack's position they've got here of Trump laughing at
[2:08:43.360 --> 2:08:50.880]  the podium looking at him. And of course, they're not paying their fair share. They have well over
[2:08:50.880 --> 2:08:56.400]  $200 billion surplus that Germany has, but they're not going to pay that share. We've got some
[2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:05.280]  breaking news from Alex. Here's Alex with joining us now. Go ahead, Alex. Absolutely, David. If you
[2:09:05.280 --> 2:09:10.320]  go to infowars.com, there's a headline by Kid Daniels, linking directly to Atlantic Monthly,
[2:09:10.320 --> 2:09:15.200]  the most elite Democratic Party publication in the United States. That's a publication where
[2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:19.280]  they communicate with their top people assigned a relief for the public. And that's been admitted
[2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:25.280]  to me by folks at the Atlantic. The Atlantic Monthly, the whole East Coast elite publication
[2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:29.840]  admits they are planning and looking at an overthrow of Trump using the continuity of
[2:09:29.840 --> 2:09:35.280]  government system. Now that's if the Russians nuked us to start in the 1950s. If they hit us
[2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:41.520]  with bombers or missiles, we would then be able to have Congress reconstituted and a new president
[2:09:41.520 --> 2:09:46.240]  brought forward a whole succession of power. The difference is I noticed when they started pushing
[2:09:46.240 --> 2:09:50.640]  that Trump's a Russian and this whole narrative three months ago, the different statements they
[2:09:50.640 --> 2:09:57.280]  were making that they were using COG stay-behind networks that are already set up as shadow
[2:09:57.280 --> 2:10:04.800]  governments under law inside of our federal government. And I, again, the first person to
[2:10:04.800 --> 2:10:09.680]  say, and I said it literally hundreds and hundreds of times, not bragging, but listeners have to
[2:10:09.680 --> 2:10:14.240]  know that we're so busy, we don't even have time to chronicle when I say this. But I said this
[2:10:14.240 --> 2:10:18.800]  in November, I said it in December, I said it in January, I said it in February, and I've even said
[2:10:18.800 --> 2:10:24.640]  it this month. And then we're going to find those clips if the water doesn't rise over Barrett Creek.
[2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:31.520]  We are going to show you what I said over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
[2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:36.480]  because the enemy wants to say we're not credible because we are so credible. We make occasional
[2:10:36.480 --> 2:10:42.480]  mistakes. It's not on purpose. When we do, we own up to them. They now admit that they are
[2:10:42.480 --> 2:10:50.560]  preparing a COG Continued Government Program. Let me break this down. In 1944, they ran Operation
[2:10:50.560 --> 2:10:56.320]  Valkyrie in Germany. Deutschland is those who live in Germany. They made it into movies with
[2:10:56.320 --> 2:11:01.760]  Tom Cruise, everybody knows about Operation Valkyrie. That was a COG program as Hitler got
[2:11:01.760 --> 2:11:08.160]  killed to keep the government going with his wishes. But they used the COG Continued Government
[2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:14.480]  Program to try to actually overthrow Hitler, but that failed. So I saw what they were doing,
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:18.480]  what they were pushing, saying he was a legitimate, saying the government should resist him,
[2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:22.720]  saying Obama was putting stay behind groups in all the major agencies and hiring literally
[2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:28.240]  hundreds of thousands of people. His last two months when Trump was president-elect, I knew
[2:11:28.240 --> 2:11:35.680]  it was a COG because the neocons in the 1980s, this was in congressional hearings in 1986 and
[2:11:35.680 --> 2:11:42.320]  1987, and I ran Contra, had a COG plan to even overthrow President Ronald Reagan.
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:47.120]  Claim leftists had done it. Assassination, they had different crises,
[2:11:47.120 --> 2:11:51.760]  national riots and new coming off. Those were part of it. And under different programs,
[2:11:51.760 --> 2:11:57.520]  Cable, Spicer, Garden Plot and others, they would then have martial law come in in the name of
[2:11:57.520 --> 2:12:04.000]  stabilizing the country. Now, Democrats are all over the news calling for martial law.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:08.720]  Democrats are all over the news calling for a civil emergency, calling for the death of
[2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:14.000]  Trump. They are preparing the climate to try to get the security services, the local police,
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:21.040]  the state police, the feds, to go along with this. That's why you see McCain calling Senator
[2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:27.120]  Paul, a quote, agent of Putin. That's why you see them saying it about me and I'm under criminal
[2:12:27.120 --> 2:12:31.360]  investigation supposedly working for Russian spies. Never met one, never talked to one. It's
[2:12:31.360 --> 2:12:35.840]  totally insane. And then it goes on from there. That's why they're pushing this narrative saying
[2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:40.800]  Trump's a Russian agent because he's a real American. Restoring the Republic and the out of
[2:12:40.800 --> 2:12:46.080]  control fourth of state, the opposition party, MSM, the elite, the Democratic Party leadership,
[2:12:46.080 --> 2:12:50.880]  the Republican Party leadership, all of them are sabotaging Trump just like they're sabotaging
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:57.760]  Brexit in the UK and trying to block the return of sovereignty in England and other areas of the
[2:12:57.760 --> 2:13:03.760]  UK. And they admitted they're using economic warfare in England. The EU is trying to keep them
[2:13:03.760 --> 2:13:09.040]  in that unelected system. So ladies and gentlemen, I'm not bragging, but I've literally read
[2:13:09.680 --> 2:13:14.880]  no exaggeration, 500 plus history books on modern war. I have read the white papers, I have read
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:19.920]  psychological warfare manuals. I've done things that most top CIA analysts don't even do themselves
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:24.880]  and I'm a private citizen. That's why I know and I'm seeing when I see it because I was attracted
[2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:29.920]  to this information as a teenager and voraciously read it all, not knowing it was part of, I guess,
[2:13:29.920 --> 2:13:35.600]  God's larger plan to resist this. But here we are dealing with this and Kit wrote a nice article,
[2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:39.840]  but I asked him, add to a screenshot of Atlantic Monthly. People aren't going to believe they're
[2:13:39.840 --> 2:13:43.360]  actually calling for this, even though you link to them. Show where they're calling for him to
[2:13:43.360 --> 2:13:47.840]  be killed. Show where they're calling for civil emergency. Show screenshots of Rosie O'Donnell
[2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:53.440]  saying civil emergency martial law. I told you they were going to call for it because I could see the
[2:13:53.440 --> 2:13:57.600]  preparations they were making. Now it's here. And so the reason I keep telling you, I told you,
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:02.400]  I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you is the next phase is demoralize
[2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:07.760]  the president, demoralize the public, make any failures he makes, big, giant issues when he's
[2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:12.080]  already devastated political correctness. It's already declaring our sovereignty. It's already
[2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:16.400]  beginning to secure our border. 40 plus percent down folks coming across illegally just from the
[2:14:16.400 --> 2:14:20.960]  first 60-something days doing all the big things for the economy, all the big things for small
[2:14:20.960 --> 2:14:25.440]  business loans, all the big things trying to get tax cuts. Is it his fault they won't get rid of
[2:14:25.440 --> 2:14:30.240]  Obamacare or tax cuts? No. Is it his fault he tried to compromise with Paul Ryan? Yes.
[2:14:30.800 --> 2:14:36.240]  And that's the president's problem, just like Matt Drudge just said, just like I've said,
[2:14:36.240 --> 2:14:41.360]  just like David Knight has said, you cannot compromise with people who aren't making a deal.
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:14:45.280]  These aren't like folks you're buying a golf course from or a hotel, Mr. President.
[2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:49.440]  You're dealing with criminals that want full control and they don't want you to succeed.
[2:14:49.440 --> 2:14:53.840]  And their own white papers, they say they want poverty and they want economic collapse. So again,
[2:14:54.960 --> 2:14:59.280]  to our radio audience, to our TV viewers, to our affiliates, to our station managers,
[2:14:59.280 --> 2:15:02.960]  but most importantly to my own crew, I know you're always busy on the latest breaking info,
[2:15:03.600 --> 2:15:09.120]  but there's a war in MSM to discredit info wars in yours truly. Now, they can discredit us,
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:12.720]  they're going to set the precedent to ban all the other news. They're openly saying they want to
[2:15:12.720 --> 2:15:17.520]  ban Matt Drudge. That was in the news just two days ago. If they're successful, they're going
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:23.200]  to come and we must hang together. So we must, and the audience has got to help us. The audience has
[2:15:23.200 --> 2:15:28.960]  all heard me hundreds of times say they're going to use COG and use the project Valkyrie story
[2:15:28.960 --> 2:15:33.440]  and then play the clips of congressional hearings. And then literally we don't, I don't have notes,
[2:15:33.440 --> 2:15:37.360]  I don't know when it, when it runs. Yeah, I just know I said it hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[2:15:37.360 --> 2:15:42.640]  of times. And the true power is in saying they're going to do this. And then it happening like
[2:15:42.640 --> 2:15:47.120]  saying Trump's going to win and then he does win or saying that the polls are fake. And then it shows
[2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:52.480]  the polls are fake. Or saying a household appliances are watching you 18 years ago. Now it's admitted.
[2:15:52.480 --> 2:15:58.160]  The real power is in that we are telling the truth. We are honest. We are cutting edge. But we've
[2:15:58.160 --> 2:16:02.160]  got to find the clips. It's going to be an emergency warning to the president of martial law,
[2:16:02.160 --> 2:16:06.160]  emergency warnings to the president of the plan to overthrow him. It's in all those larger special
[2:16:06.160 --> 2:16:12.240]  reports and it's in reports I did on the Sunday show especially. I remember in December, it got
[2:16:12.240 --> 2:16:16.560]  picked up in the news where I warned that the CIA was planning to overthrow Trump and COG.
[2:16:16.560 --> 2:16:21.280]  It even got picked up in major newspapers, but the headline was planned to overthrow Trump before
[2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:25.680]  he's actually inaugurated. They wanted to do it then, but they can't get the security services to
[2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:32.000]  do it. So first they've got a bully Rand Paul, the senator. Then they got a bully Nunes and anybody
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:35.840]  else it's honorable and telling the truth. So they're all calling them Russian agents. They're
[2:16:35.840 --> 2:16:41.600]  not Russian agents. They're agents of the Republic backing the president, trying to make us great
[2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:47.120]  again. Backing us, turning our coal on that's most our power that absolutely bankrupted the Russians.
[2:16:47.120 --> 2:16:50.880]  And then he did that. We're not against the Russians, but sorry. You're selling natural gas
[2:16:50.880 --> 2:16:56.880]  globally. Sorry, our coal's much cheaper than yours. It's over for you. Sorry. He's devastating the
[2:16:56.880 --> 2:17:01.440]  Russians. He's devastating the Chinese Communists. He's devastating the EU because America is still
[2:17:01.440 --> 2:17:06.160]  positioned despite the fact that we're 90% sold off with the globalists to war back to worldwide
[2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:10.400]  dominance. Then we can empower these other countries. So that's the bottom line. I'm total
[2:17:10.400 --> 2:17:14.320]  America. Everybody knows that. I'm going to go back to David, not here, but that's why
[2:17:15.200 --> 2:17:18.960]  we're playing 3D chess here when people see me do things. Sometimes they don't totally agree with
[2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:24.240]  their understanding when they see you make moves or make apologies on certain issues. It's because
[2:17:24.240 --> 2:17:30.240]  I understand larger plans and no things you don't know. Like the official democratic party openly
[2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:35.440]  in fundraising letters saying they're planning to put everything they can this year into destroying
[2:17:35.440 --> 2:17:39.200]  info wars. And if they can take us out, they're going to take everybody else out. So then I
[2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:44.800]  strategically know what to do to block that using, I'm just going to stop right there.
[2:17:44.800 --> 2:17:50.320]  So look, we've come this far. We're defending the Republic 110%. We've told you what's going on.

[2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:44.880]  info wars.com. Kit Daniels. He's adding a lot to it. Great job. Kit doing it. But I want to,
[2:18:44.880 --> 2:18:48.800]  this is a huge article, the fact they're coming out in the most elite publication of the Democrats
[2:18:48.800 --> 2:18:53.280]  saying we're getting ready to overthrow the class and have special elections and have Homeland
[2:18:53.280 --> 2:18:57.920]  Security take control of elections, which Obama already signed in. You know their whole plan.
[2:18:57.920 --> 2:19:05.360]  They're coming for us. They took, they have taken my, my, my correction because I know we got sucked
[2:19:05.360 --> 2:19:09.520]  into the pizza gate. Of course the overall pizza gates real. Of course there's stuff with Podesta
[2:19:09.520 --> 2:19:13.360]  and the emails. I'm not saying that stuff's not real. We trailblaze exposing it. They and the
[2:19:13.360 --> 2:19:18.480]  media picked what to target to get us to focus on it, to set us up and then put this info out,
[2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:23.120]  ladies and gentlemen, so that it discredits the entire movement to expose it all. But why do you
[2:19:23.120 --> 2:19:27.280]  think every radio station I know of in Austin and every other radio station around the country
[2:19:27.280 --> 2:19:32.480]  we've heard of is attaching me and now lying saying that I'm saying pedophilia doesn't exist
[2:19:32.480 --> 2:19:36.800]  and I'm saying none of this stuff exists. That's because the elites are all into this.
[2:19:36.800 --> 2:19:40.480]  They're running this stuff and they want to take what I've said and twist it because people know
[2:19:40.480 --> 2:19:44.880]  I have credibility to discredit the overall movement against them. But the good news is
[2:19:45.440 --> 2:19:49.760]  that's not happening. The people are awakening and it's a beautiful time and we're moving forward
[2:19:49.760 --> 2:20:00.240]  to infowars.com. Back to David Knight. I spread the word. Get out there and support us. This is a war. Do you want folks to fight? Do you want folks to take action? Do you want people to take on the new world order? We're doing it, so back to the right.

[2:23:56.240 --> 2:24:16.240]  Welcome back to The Alice Jones Show. I'm going to take phone calls on this last half hour that we've got. Let me give you that number. That's 800-259-9231.
[2:24:16.240 --> 2:24:44.240]  If you want to call into the show, give us your opinion, your take on the latest events of the day, and we're going to start that in the next segment. We've got a short segment here. I'm going to go back to this article that Alex was talking about, and there's another article about the Catholic Church jumping into this issue of the Trump wall and saying that any Mexicans who work on this are committing an immoral act.
[2:24:44.240 --> 2:24:56.240]  They're committing treason. They're working against the homeland, so forth and so on. That's a pretty amazing statement. We're going to take a look at that in just a moment. Before we do, real quickly, I want to remind you that we have a free newsletter.
[2:24:56.240 --> 2:25:04.240]  If you're not signed up for that, you can go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter. You can sign up for that free newsletter so that you can get the news uncensored.
[2:25:04.240 --> 2:25:15.240]  That's not going to be censored by bots at Facebook or Google or social media anywhere. And you'll also get daily specials. Today's daily special, for example, is PowerPack.

[2:25:38.240 --> 2:25:47.240]  This is the last day of the special. Again, it has a shelf life of 25 years made with high quality ingredients in the USA, no GMO, and it is resealable.
[2:25:47.240 --> 2:26:01.240]  Once you do open that product up, you can reseal it for the next day or so, but it will preserve in its original format for 25 years. So it's the great packaging made in the USA and it supports and funds our operations with the things that we sell at infowars.
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:13.240]  And finally, one last thing here. Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is now back in stock at infowarslife.com. Check that out. Check out the reviews. It's one of my favorite products and one of the reasons why it's sold out.
[2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:22.240]  So very quickly that has silver in it as well as iodine. It does not have fluoride. So it's very important what it doesn't have and what it does have. It's a great toothpaste.
[2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:33.240]  You will feel the difference. It's very important to fight gum disease, to fight the bacteria that causes gum disease and the bacteria that then moves into your bloodstream causes heart disease.
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:43.240]  Alright, Alex was just talking about, he called him because it's a very important article that Kit Daniels put up, talking about what's going on with the Atlantic,
[2:26:43.240 --> 2:26:55.240]  confessing about their changes of continuity of government saying we need to use this whole narrative about Russian hackers, call this election into question, and then say, well, we can't just overturn Donald Trump's election.
[2:26:55.240 --> 2:27:06.240]  He pints as well and even the Republican Senate and House, we need to question all of this. And what's the basis for that? As he points out in the article, this fellow Ornstein saying,
[2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:19.240]  we need to ensure the continuity of government amid cyber warfare threats. Remember all the talk before the election about how cyber warfare was the same as launching a real physical attack against our country?
[2:27:19.240 --> 2:27:39.240]  How do we know that there's been cyber warfare? Remember we just had the WikiLeaks release of Vault 7? And it talked about how the CIA was curating all these different hacks as well as curating the ability to mask these hacks and make it look as if these attacks are coming from a different country.
[2:27:39.240 --> 2:27:50.240]  So how are you going to know if they say there's a cyber warfare attack? How are you going to know if that's coming from Russia or from Washington? That's one of the key ingredients here, then the discussion that's not really being talked about.
[2:27:50.240 --> 2:28:00.240]  Everybody's saying, Russian hack, Russian hack, and there's no evidence of this. As I said before, if they had any evidence after months and months and months of screaming about this, believe me, they would have put that evidence out.
[2:28:00.240 --> 2:28:12.240]  They don't have any evidence for it. It is a baseless allegation. But what they're doing is they're preparing the American public for when they say there is a cyber warfare attack. And guess who is going to decide that there's a cyber warfare attack?
[2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:19.240]  Well, as he points out in the article, he says the Obama administration put the Department of Homeland Security in charge of deciding if there's a cyber warfare attack.
[2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:30.240]  And there are also the people who actually did hack the elections to the extent that there were any computer hacks into elections. They got into several state boards of elections. It was Homeland Security.
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:38.240]  So the same people who we know hacked into elections, board of elections in the various states, are the people who are going to adjudicate that this is a cyber warfare attack.
[2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:50.240]  We know, based on the documents that we've seen, that we cannot tell the origin of these cyber attacks. John McAfee talked to me. He said this many times. And of course, now we've seen in the documents.
[2:28:50.240 --> 2:28:58.240]  We know that they cannot, with certainty, say that as John McAfee said, look, they would be absolutely incompetent if they left their fingerprints.
[2:28:58.240 --> 2:29:09.240]  So, in such a basic way, they say, well, we saw this and it looked like it was a Cerelli keyboard and so forth. No state agency that is doing that sort of thing, worth their salt.
[2:29:09.240 --> 2:29:19.240]  They would all be fired in front of a firing squad if they did something that absurd, that hopelessly incompetent. They're obviously going to make it look like it came from a different country.
[2:29:19.240 --> 2:29:31.240]  That's one of the first things they're going to do. And as he pointed out, the supposed software that did the supposed hack of the emails and so forth was a very old piece of software that was out of rev.
[2:29:31.240 --> 2:29:40.240]  It was in the public domain. It wasn't even current software, hacking software. But these people are going to say, well, because we've had a cyber attack and because we will, you just have to trust us.
[2:29:40.240 --> 2:29:48.240]  We know where it's coming from. We don't trust them. They're the people who create the holes and are leaving the holes open. How's that for security? Say, well, this will be right back.
[2:29:48.240 --> 2:29:52.240]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:52.240 --> 2:30:19.240]  Thanks, Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:19.240 --> 2:30:25.240]  This again creates the battle between media platforms, consumers protected privacy and governments access into such databases.
[2:30:25.240 --> 2:30:33.240]  But what really needs to be asked, how does YouTube allow ISIS to operate on its platform when some info wars videos have been removed for content?
[2:30:33.240 --> 2:30:42.240]  You're telling me no one from the FBI or nothing from the CIA vault seven technologies can be used to track down whoever is posting these terrorist recruitment videos.
[2:30:42.240 --> 2:30:53.240]  It seems to me that we not only have a terrorist problem, we have a priority problem enabling these terrorists to operate online where conservative media is targeted before Islamic terrorist hate speech.
[2:30:53.240 --> 2:31:00.240]  This is Owen Schreuer for the more scrutinized by YouTube than ISIS info wars dot com.
[2:31:00.240 --> 2:31:12.240]  The reason info wars life has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family. I take this. My family takes this and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[2:31:12.240 --> 2:31:16.240]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products info wars life dot com.
[2:31:16.240 --> 2:31:26.240]  If I ever forget to take them, like I'll I have a noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[2:31:26.240 --> 2:31:34.240]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[2:31:34.240 --> 2:31:44.240]  Very exciting feeling great looking good. And I know my hair is luxurious once again. So obviously the super female is amazing. I love it.
[2:31:44.240 --> 2:31:59.240]  The nascent iodine is essential survival shield x2. If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine survival shield x2. It's got a five star rating. It's a win win info wars life dot com.
[2:31:59.240 --> 2:32:21.240]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diet of processed junk. We are now introducing caveman by info wars life dot com. The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth to Merrick root shaga mushroom and seven total primal super foods in a single great tasting formula caveman.
[2:32:21.240 --> 2:32:32.240]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them. Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[2:32:32.240 --> 2:32:45.240]  You use the meat for sustenance the fat for cooking but you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body. This is the engine of the life essence.
[2:32:45.240 --> 2:32:58.240]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself and for life dot com today.
[2:33:15.240 --> 2:33:33.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight and we're going to go to your calls in just one moment. If you want to call in that number is 800-259-9231 that's 800-259-9231.
[2:33:33.240 --> 2:33:46.240]  Just before we go to the calls and maybe some of you want to comment about this the articles that came out from Reuters and AP today about the Catholic Church in Mexico the Archdiocese of Mexico.
[2:33:46.240 --> 2:34:01.240]  And this is what they're saying any company intending to invest in the wall of the fanatic Trump would be immoral but above all it's shareholders and owners should be considered traders to the homeland.
[2:34:01.240 --> 2:34:12.240]  You want to understand this is an invasion folks and I think nothing says that more than this and more than the actions of the Mexican government's own embassies.
[2:34:12.240 --> 2:34:24.240]  And consulates 50 of them throughout the United States working and conspiring with foreign citizens their citizens who criminally trespass in our country conspiring with them to violate our laws.
[2:34:24.240 --> 2:34:36.240]  And to come here in mass without our permission not intending to become part of America. They don't want to be Americans. They want America.
[2:34:36.240 --> 2:34:45.240]  They don't want to work with you. They want to take what you've got and nothing could be clearer than this. The editorial is titled treason against the homeland.
[2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:55.240]  So what is most surprising is the timidity of the Mexican government's economic authorities who have not firmly moved against these companies who would bid on building this wall.
[2:34:55.240 --> 2:35:14.240]  So they want these companies punished this Catholic Church this highly politicized Catholic Church working for the globalist as we pointed out over and over again working for their key issues of globalist consolidation their new world order pushing climate change as the mechanism for that.
[2:35:14.240 --> 2:35:22.240]  And of course pushing people across the border to create the kind of friction that's going to create that change. We need to understand what this is.
[2:35:22.240 --> 2:35:32.240]  And they talk about how Mexicans will judge these firms on whether they are loyal to the national identity. Folks that is nothing but la raza.
[2:35:32.240 --> 2:35:42.240]  That is la raza that is being pushed on us. We have to understand what is truly behind this. This is not your immigrants yearning to be free.
[2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:51.240]  This is not the Statue of Liberty. This is these are foreign nationals who are being pushed here by foreign government saying they want to take over our government.
[2:35:51.240 --> 2:35:59.240]  They don't want to pay for the education of their citizens first and foremost. So they want to send their citizens here to be educated at your expense.
[2:35:59.240 --> 2:36:08.240]  The dreamers are coming here and they're going to make the American dream of owning a home unaffordable because most of your property taxes are going to pay for schools.
[2:36:08.240 --> 2:36:17.240]  And now we see that about a quarter of the students nationwide are illegal homes. They're from illegal aliens homes.
[2:36:17.240 --> 2:36:23.240]  So can you afford to do that? Can you afford not only to educate them but to educate them in the language of their choice?
[2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:28.240]  That's not enough that they're going to come here. They don't want to assimilate to the extent that they would speak English.
[2:36:28.240 --> 2:36:38.240]  No, they want to be educated in the language of their choice. And it's not just Spanish. There's jurisdictions where they've got dozens of different languages that they have to educate children on.
[2:36:38.240 --> 2:36:49.240]  This is what's behind this takeover. And again, at the end of the last week, we saw the report about how 24 states, 50% or more of babies are born on Medicaid.
[2:36:49.240 --> 2:36:58.240]  And in New Mexico, that is 72%. So these children are coming here, they are coming here as birth tourism.
[2:36:58.240 --> 2:37:04.240]  They can come here, get all of their pregnancy care taken care of by the American taxpayer because the Mexican government doesn't want to do it.
[2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:17.240]  And then if they want to continue to stay here, then those anchor babies then go on Medicaid and then the whole family can continue to draw from the American trough because the Mexican government doesn't want to do this.
[2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:24.240]  This is an invasion. It's being pushed forward by the Mexican government. It is now being pushed forward amazingly by the Catholic Church.
[2:37:24.240 --> 2:37:31.240]  It has nothing to do with the Catholic Church. It has everything to do with the globalist politics of the pope.
[2:37:31.240 --> 2:37:37.240]  Let's go to your calls now. Let's go to Nicholas in Texas. Go ahead, Nicholas.
[2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:39.240]  Hello, David. How are you doing today?
[2:37:39.240 --> 2:37:42.240]  Doing good. What's on your mind?
[2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:48.240]  I just have two quick topics to go over and that is Paul Ryan in 9-11.
[2:37:48.240 --> 2:38:04.240]  First of all, Paul Ryan, I think he should really be released from the Trump administration because I think going with this tax reform that Trump's about to do, I think it's going to be a stall on Trump's agenda. What do you think?
[2:38:04.240 --> 2:38:12.240]  Well, I would like to see Paul Ryan go, but if you remember the very people that Trump is going to war with now, the House Freedom Caucus are going to be the only people who could really remove him.
[2:38:12.240 --> 2:38:24.240]  It's going to take a vote in the House and it was the House Freedom Caucus that opposed Paul Ryan in the past, that opposed John Boehner and John Boehner saw the handwriting on the wall and he got out before they threw him out.
[2:38:24.240 --> 2:38:36.240]  But then he made sure that his handpicked puppet, Paul Ryan, was put in his place. So if we want to get real change done, we have to work with the people who are standing on the principle of repealing this dictatorial Obamacare.
[2:38:36.240 --> 2:38:43.240]  Paul Ryan never wanted to get that taken out. He was part of the Republican establishment. He's going to be defended by the Republican establishment.
[2:38:43.240 --> 2:38:48.240]  Trump just can't go in as a dictator and say, I don't want Paul Ryan here anymore.
[2:38:48.240 --> 2:38:58.240]  He's going to have to work with people who don't agree with Paul Ryan, but I just don't understand why he would side with Paul Ryan or why he would say he's now going to go work with the Democrats on this stuff.
[2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:06.240]  Look, if he would work with the core Republicans and make that the base and build on that base, then he would get something done.
[2:39:06.240 --> 2:39:12.240]  The Democrats are in the minority. The Democrats, when they were in the majority, were able to get Obamacare passed.
[2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:22.240]  Republicans now have control of the House, the Senate, and the presidency. And if they can't replace Obamacare and repeal it in the first place, they have to repeal it.
[2:39:22.240 --> 2:39:27.240]  They have to repeal these dictatorial mechanisms that are there. If they can't do that, it'll never happen.
[2:39:27.240 --> 2:39:32.240]  And it certainly is not going to happen with the Democrats. They're perfectly happy with what's there.
[2:39:32.240 --> 2:39:38.240]  They're perfectly happy with the taxes, except they would like to see them hire. I don't see how you're going to work with them to get that done.
[2:39:38.240 --> 2:39:47.240]  Paul Ryan might work with him somewhat on the taxes, but he's not going to make the kind of changes in terms of the border, in terms of trade, in terms of Obamacare that we want to see happen.
[2:39:47.240 --> 2:39:56.240]  He represents the status quo establishment. And the GOP wants to drag their feet and keep things as they are just like the Democrats do.
[2:39:56.240 --> 2:40:00.240]  So I don't think that's going to happen. What do you want to say about 9-11?
[2:40:00.240 --> 2:40:10.240]  Yeah, there's a report by Breitbart and the Miami Curls that the missing 20th hijacker is willing to testify on the 9-11 trial.
[2:40:10.240 --> 2:40:15.240]  And I think he's trying to expose Saudi Arabia's link to 9-11.
[2:40:15.240 --> 2:40:26.240]  Well, that'd be interesting. When we look at this lawsuit that was filed by the families of the victims of 9-11, and of course they were blocked from doing that for 15 years,
[2:40:26.240 --> 2:40:33.240]  they came up, the official government conspiracy theory said that two planes knocked down three steel skyscrapers.
[2:40:33.240 --> 2:40:36.240]  If you believe that, I got a bridge I can sell you, okay?
[2:40:36.240 --> 2:40:42.240]  But they came up with that official conspiracy theory, and part of selling that official conspiracy theory was the Saudis did it.
[2:40:42.240 --> 2:40:46.240]  And they put it in the report, but then they wouldn't let anybody see it.
[2:40:46.240 --> 2:40:56.240]  Donald Trump came out and said, we want to see those missing 28 pages, and that got that revealed, even though the senators who were ahead of the 9-11 commission had worked for 15 years to say,
[2:40:56.240 --> 2:40:58.240]  we need to show the American people these pages.
[2:40:58.240 --> 2:41:03.240]  Nothing happened when they were doing it, but when Donald Trump said we want to see the missing 28 pages, it happened.
[2:41:03.240 --> 2:41:11.240]  And then once that happened, people were so outraged about that, they said, well, you want to say the Saudis did it, then there ought to be some consequences to the Saudis if you say they did it.
[2:41:11.240 --> 2:41:15.240]  And so that began the process to move forward and let them sue for compensation.
[2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:17.240]  Obama vetoed that.
[2:41:17.240 --> 2:41:22.240]  But the Senate, because the people were outraged with what they saw, the Senate overruled Obama's veto.
[2:41:22.240 --> 2:41:30.240]  So for the last six months, they've been looking at the documents, building information, doing discovery, and that's the important thing.
[2:41:30.240 --> 2:41:32.240]  We've got to open this back up.
[2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:33.240]  We've got to look at this again.
[2:41:33.240 --> 2:41:39.240]  We've got to get to the details, and I think that's a very positive thing that can come out of this.
[2:41:39.240 --> 2:41:41.240]  I'd like to see the families get some compensation.
[2:41:41.240 --> 2:41:49.240]  We understand that the CIA and Saudi Arabia are so connected, so connected for so long that you can't tell where one ends and the other one begins.
[2:41:49.240 --> 2:41:56.240]  I think you ought to call it like the CIA Arabians, because you've had Prince Mondar staying at Langley Air Force Base.
[2:41:56.240 --> 2:41:58.240]  The connections between them are just so tight.
[2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:07.240]  They were part of the Bretton Woods repeal of gold standard, and they put us on a Petro dollar, and the Saudis were key to that.
[2:42:07.240 --> 2:42:12.240]  So they have a lot of leverage over us. We have leverage over them, but we're joined at the hip.
[2:42:12.240 --> 2:42:16.240]  We're joined at the CIA with Saudi Arabia.
[2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:18.240]  So this is something that needs to move forward.
[2:42:18.240 --> 2:42:21.240]  I'm very happy to see that there's going to be some more discovery in that.
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:22.240]  We'll see what happens.
[2:42:22.240 --> 2:42:24.240]  Let's go to – thank you, Nicholas.
[2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:26.240]  Let's go to Mike in North Dakota.
[2:42:26.240 --> 2:42:28.240]  Go ahead, Mike.
[2:42:28.240 --> 2:42:29.240]  Hey, David.
[2:42:29.240 --> 2:42:30.240]  Can you hear me?
[2:42:30.240 --> 2:42:31.240]  Yes, I hear you.
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:32.240]  I'm talking to myself a little bit.
[2:42:32.240 --> 2:42:33.240]  You're on.
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:40.240]  Yeah, I was – people keep talking about – oh, they're happy that the state finally went constitutional.
[2:42:40.240 --> 2:42:42.240]  Yeah, I talked about that yesterday.
[2:42:42.240 --> 2:42:43.240]  Yes.
[2:42:43.240 --> 2:42:46.240]  Yeah, and for people who don't know the news – let me just explain.
[2:42:46.240 --> 2:42:51.240]  For people who don't know the news, we had the state of North Dakota say – and it was by a large margin.
[2:42:51.240 --> 2:42:56.240]  It was almost unanimous in the House, and it was like two to one, I think, or three to one, nearly in the Senate.
[2:42:56.240 --> 2:43:04.240]  They said, we're not going to turn the privilege – or the right of having weapons to protect yourself.
[2:43:04.240 --> 2:43:07.240]  We're not going to turn that right into a privilege.
[2:43:07.240 --> 2:43:10.240]  You don't have to do anything to have a concealed carry.
[2:43:10.240 --> 2:43:15.240]  You just need to be able to identify yourself if a police officer asks you at a traffic stop.
[2:43:15.240 --> 2:43:19.240]  You need to tell them that you're carrying – that you've got a weapon with you and identify yourself.
[2:43:19.240 --> 2:43:21.240]  Other than that, it's just what the Second Amendment says.
[2:43:21.240 --> 2:43:23.240]  And the Second Amendment does not give us those rights.
[2:43:23.240 --> 2:43:29.240]  The Second Amendment recognizes God-given natural rights, human rights that we all possess,
[2:43:29.240 --> 2:43:32.240]  and it says the government will not take those away.
[2:43:32.240 --> 2:43:34.240]  So the Second Amendment doesn't give us rights.
[2:43:34.240 --> 2:43:37.240]  The Second Amendment prohibits the government from taking those rights away.
[2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:38.240]  So it's very important.
[2:43:38.240 --> 2:43:42.240]  And as I said before, Mike, that really needs to be done at the state level.
[2:43:42.240 --> 2:43:46.240]  Many of our issues with liberty need to be taken back at the state level.
[2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:48.240]  We're not going to be given our liberties.
[2:43:48.240 --> 2:43:50.240]  Nobody ever gives you your freedom.
[2:43:50.240 --> 2:43:51.240]  You take it back.
[2:43:51.240 --> 2:43:53.240]  And the place we can take it back is at the state level.
[2:43:53.240 --> 2:43:56.240]  And that leads to the way we've had other states who have done this.
[2:43:56.240 --> 2:43:58.240]  And we need to do this on other issues as well.
[2:43:58.240 --> 2:44:00.240]  It's a great thing that they did.
[2:44:00.240 --> 2:44:03.240]  And North Dakota, your comments.
[2:44:03.240 --> 2:44:04.240]  Yeah.
[2:44:04.240 --> 2:44:06.240]  Well, you know, I'm from California.
[2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:08.240]  And that place is all jacked up.
[2:44:08.240 --> 2:44:09.240]  And that's why I got out of there.
[2:44:09.240 --> 2:44:13.240]  But the laws here are a lot more relaxed.
[2:44:13.240 --> 2:44:20.240]  But they still put a lot of issues with where you can carry it.
[2:44:20.240 --> 2:44:22.240]  You can't go to the mall, you can't go to Target,
[2:44:22.240 --> 2:44:25.240]  you can't go to places where people are gathering to protect yourself.
[2:44:25.240 --> 2:44:28.240]  You can't go to a theater.
[2:44:28.240 --> 2:44:33.240]  They don't want you in there if you've got a concealed carry.
[2:44:33.240 --> 2:44:34.240]  Of course, I take it anyway.
[2:44:34.240 --> 2:44:38.240]  I just won't tell nobody because nobody's going to tell me how I can and can't defend myself.
[2:44:38.240 --> 2:44:39.240]  I'm not going to hurt nobody.
[2:44:39.240 --> 2:44:40.240]  I'm just looking to defend myself.
[2:44:40.240 --> 2:44:41.240]  That's right.
[2:44:41.240 --> 2:44:42.240]  That's right.
[2:44:42.240 --> 2:44:45.240]  So you're saying that even though you don't have to have a privileged license
[2:44:45.240 --> 2:44:49.240]  because you concealed carry, they're putting restrictions on where you can carry weapons.
[2:44:49.240 --> 2:44:51.240]  Yeah, and that's what I'm saying.
[2:44:51.240 --> 2:44:55.240]  They say, oh, it's constitutional carry, but it's really not.
[2:44:55.240 --> 2:44:57.240]  It's under the blanket.
[2:44:57.240 --> 2:44:59.240]  They say, oh, it's constitutional carry.
[2:44:59.240 --> 2:45:00.240]  Now you don't need a permit.
[2:45:00.240 --> 2:45:06.240]  Well, yeah, they're still saying, oh, you can't use it here or there or here or there or other places like that.
[2:45:06.240 --> 2:45:08.240]  Well, that's an important point.
[2:45:08.240 --> 2:45:12.240]  And we need to understand that that's the way they try to set up tripwires for people.
[2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:17.240]  And of course, they've seen the same thing when they have decriminalized or legalized marijuana,
[2:45:17.240 --> 2:45:20.240]  either for medical use or for just recreational use.
[2:45:20.240 --> 2:45:23.240]  They still leave those tripwires out there.
[2:45:23.240 --> 2:45:26.240]  And that's the really insidious thing when they do that.
[2:45:26.240 --> 2:45:29.240]  But again, it's a fight that is going to continue.
[2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:33.240]  And it is a fight that we're going to have to do at the local level as we're talking about these different issues.
[2:45:33.240 --> 2:45:35.240]  Now, Trump is with us on the Second Amendment.
[2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:36.240]  Absolutely.
[2:45:36.240 --> 2:45:44.240]  There's some other issues like the war on drugs that the Trump administration is not with us on certain issues like this really have to be fought at the state level.
[2:45:44.240 --> 2:45:48.240]  But the key thing about Donald Trump and the Trump administration is that they were going to block.
[2:45:48.240 --> 2:45:50.240]  And I think so far, he's done a great job.
[2:45:50.240 --> 2:45:54.240]  And one of the first things he did was to shut down the TPP.
[2:45:54.240 --> 2:46:00.240]  Understanding that it wasn't something that you could negotiate the details of and get something that you wanted.
[2:46:00.240 --> 2:46:05.240]  It was going to create a structure that was then going to be used to enact globalism.
[2:46:05.240 --> 2:46:09.240]  And he needs to come to that same realization about the health care bill.
[2:46:09.240 --> 2:46:16.240]  The health care bill is not about the details as much as it is about the infrastructure that was built with Obamacare.
[2:46:16.240 --> 2:46:19.240]  You need to destroy and repeal that infrastructure.
[2:46:19.240 --> 2:46:28.240]  And then you can go back and you can set up things to enhance markets to give people economic choice to give them information,
[2:46:28.240 --> 2:46:31.240]  make those economic choices to have competition across great state lines.
[2:46:31.240 --> 2:46:36.240]  You can do that stuff afterwards, but you need to destroy this infrastructure of power.
[2:46:36.240 --> 2:46:41.240]  And that was the key thing about TPP. That's why it could not be negotiated.
[2:46:41.240 --> 2:46:44.240]  We didn't want to renegotiate that. We just needed to shut that down.
[2:46:44.240 --> 2:46:45.240]  And I hope he understands that.
[2:46:45.240 --> 2:46:51.240]  And so if we keep globalism from destroying our Constitution, we still have it on the books,
[2:46:51.240 --> 2:46:54.240]  even though it's being totally ignored by our federal government,
[2:46:54.240 --> 2:46:59.240]  we can then reenact the Constitution gradually at the state and local level.
[2:46:59.240 --> 2:47:03.240]  And I think that's a big move in the right direction what they did in North Dakota,
[2:47:03.240 --> 2:47:08.240]  even though they left those little tripwires around about prohibitions as to where you could carry your weapons.
[2:47:08.240 --> 2:47:12.240]  They took away the fundamental idea that is wrong,
[2:47:12.240 --> 2:47:17.240]  that this is some kind of a privilege that could be granted to you or withheld from you by the federal government.
[2:47:17.240 --> 2:47:20.240]  No, it is a fundamental human right to be able to protect yourself.
[2:47:20.240 --> 2:47:25.240]  And the next step of that, of course, is to say we're going to remove these restrictions that create gun-free zones,
[2:47:25.240 --> 2:47:28.240]  because those are the most dangerous areas, as we've pointed out time and time again.
[2:47:28.240 --> 2:47:32.240]  Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Kevin in Florida. Go ahead, Kevin.
[2:47:32.240 --> 2:47:37.240]  Thank you, David. I just have two quick points to make.
[2:47:37.240 --> 2:47:44.240]  First is there's a very dear one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes that stars Burgess Meredith,
[2:47:44.240 --> 2:47:49.240]  where he plays a library that is trying to be outed by the state.
[2:47:49.240 --> 2:47:53.240]  Oh, yeah, we play that all the time as an opening break. Absolutely. Yeah, I agree.
[2:47:53.240 --> 2:47:56.240]  I know exactly the one you're talking about. Go ahead. Sorry.
[2:47:56.240 --> 2:48:05.240]  I feel like that's kind of what's going on. I feel like Burgess Meredith is like anybody currently in the state that we live in
[2:48:05.240 --> 2:48:09.240]  who does not agree with the deep state or the current establishment.
[2:48:09.240 --> 2:48:15.240]  I mean, we've seen it happen with Ben Garrison or something as simple as a Monsanto cartoon.
[2:48:15.240 --> 2:48:20.240]  We've seen what they do with Milo. We see what's going on actually in London right now.
[2:48:20.240 --> 2:48:27.240]  What YouTube is trying to restrict with Paul Joseph Watson's articles and what is happening with Tommy Robinson.
[2:48:27.240 --> 2:48:36.240]  I just feel that that's what it's doing. It's easier for them to try and just get rid of the person rather than to come out and debate them
[2:48:36.240 --> 2:48:41.240]  and know that the deep state is wrong. So I feel like that's what's going on.
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:51.240]  And the second part is you guys were talking a little bit about AI and the robotics thing. There's also another show called The Outer Limits
[2:48:51.240 --> 2:48:59.240]  and there was a really good episode with Tom Arnold where he bought a robot to try and help his family out do things around the house
[2:48:59.240 --> 2:49:07.240]  and the robot ended up taking over his whole entire house. I feel like that's what's happening with these AI systems is
[2:49:07.240 --> 2:49:14.240]  you get it for one thing, thinking you're going to be able to control it and then it overruns everything.
[2:49:14.240 --> 2:49:20.240]  Absolutely. You know, that episode you're talking about, Burgess Meredith, we play that and it's to make you a non-entity
[2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:25.240]  to tell you that you have absolutely no value. Of course, we've seen that portrayed in other things like the prisoner episodes
[2:49:25.240 --> 2:49:31.240]  where they would say we have declared you to be non-mutual. You know, that's kind of a forerunner of political correctness.
[2:49:31.240 --> 2:49:37.240]  You know, you're non-mutual. There's also a Twilight Zone episode you want to talk about AI.
[2:49:37.240 --> 2:49:42.240]  The one that comes to my mind is the one where they have the benevolent aliens who come to Earth.
[2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:47.240]  And remember, we've got Elon Musk talking about how AI is like an artificial intelligence.
[2:49:47.240 --> 2:49:52.240]  He said, just think of this as it unrolls as being visited by an artificial intelligence.
[2:49:52.240 --> 2:49:55.240]  It's going to be coming here in about 20 years or so.
[2:49:55.240 --> 2:50:06.240]  And if you look at that episode, this benevolent aliens who came to Earth, they had said that their purpose was to serve mankind.
[2:50:06.240 --> 2:50:12.240]  And at the end of the episode, a guy gets on their ship and he sees this book that says to serve mankind
[2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:17.240]  and he opens it up and it's a recipe book. That is essentially what they're doing, folks.
[2:50:17.240 --> 2:50:22.240]  They're putting these things out there and saying, don't worry, we're going to do everything for you.
[2:50:22.240 --> 2:50:26.240]  We're going to serve you with these robot chauffeurs, these robot taxis.
[2:50:26.240 --> 2:50:29.240]  They will do everything. You don't have to worry about anything.
[2:50:29.240 --> 2:50:35.240]  You can just lay back in your cocoon that they set up like a coffin and we'll do all the driving for you.
[2:50:35.240 --> 2:50:40.240]  You know, one of the things about that is it sets it up into, it dulls our mind.
[2:50:40.240 --> 2:50:47.240]  There's an article in RT talking about how the navigation systems that we use actually cause our brains to lose their activity,
[2:50:47.240 --> 2:50:52.240]  our brains to shrink, they compared it to the taxi drivers who did the knowledge, their brains grew.
[2:50:52.240 --> 2:51:18.240]  Ours are shrinking because we're turning it over to the AIs. Stay with us and we'll be right back with more of your call.

[2:55:22.240 --> 2:55:29.240]  I want to go back to the phone calls right now. Let's go to Mark in New Hampshire. Mark, you want to talk about the border wall. Go ahead.
[2:55:29.240 --> 2:55:34.240]  Yeah, I just had a quick question, David. Thank you for taking my call.
[2:55:34.240 --> 2:55:51.240]  As far as the border wall goes, I don't necessarily agree with the wall, but don't they use technology and motion sensors at Area 51 to detect that even if a mouse crosses that line, it sets off an alarm?
[2:55:51.240 --> 2:55:54.240]  Why couldn't that be implemented along the border?
[2:55:54.240 --> 2:56:00.240]  Yeah, absolutely. They might even kind of use technology. You might think they would use that at the White House.
[2:56:00.240 --> 2:56:07.240]  We see one episode or the other of people going over that wall in that fence. Yeah, to a large degree, that's true.
[2:56:07.240 --> 2:56:13.240]  And to some degree, I think any wall that you put there, you're going to have somebody who is going to find a way to get over it.
[2:56:13.240 --> 2:56:18.240]  The key is, though, is to increase the resistance to decrease the flow. Nothing is going to be 100%.
[2:56:18.240 --> 2:56:24.240]  There's never any 100% solution to anything, but we have to do something to enforce our border.
[2:56:24.240 --> 2:56:36.240]  And I think, what do you think about this story about the Mexican Archdiocese, the Catholic Church, saying it's treason to work with these people, it's disloyal to their national identity to work with people?
[2:56:36.240 --> 2:56:44.240]  I mean, why does their national identity depend on being able to come into our country and violate our laws? What do you think about that?
[2:56:44.240 --> 2:57:08.240]  I'm still trying to figure that one out, to be honest with you. I certainly think that'd be like saying if we went into Canada or we wanted to build a wall against Canada and the Canadians wanted to come in, it was treasonous to Canada.
[2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:20.240]  Well, yeah, the analogy would be we want to do everything we can and we set up our embassies in Canada to help Americans immigrate there, or let's say, pick another country, pick China or pick Switzerland.
[2:57:20.240 --> 2:57:27.240]  And let's say the Swiss don't want to let us go there because we don't have enough money or we haven't followed their rules and we say, well, we're going to send Americans in there anyway.
[2:57:27.240 --> 2:57:36.240]  And then we're going to work with our embassies in Switzerland to make sure that the Americans can stay there and violate their laws and get free services from the Swiss, whether the Swiss like it or not.
[2:57:36.240 --> 2:57:45.240]  If you do anything to stop that, you're guilty of treason against the United States because we're trying to take over Switzerland here. Come on, guys, work with us.
[2:57:45.240 --> 2:57:50.240]  This is part of our national identity to take over Switzerland, so work with us. That's what the Mexican government is doing.
[2:57:50.240 --> 2:57:59.240]  They're saying that you are committing treason, that you are disloyal to the national identity, and that what you're doing is immoral because, of course, they're a church.
[2:57:59.240 --> 2:58:07.240]  They don't really have anything to say about what treason is or politics are, do they? I mean, that's not really something where they have the authority to speak.
[2:58:07.240 --> 2:58:14.240]  You know, when the pope comes in and talks about climate change or whatever, he's not really speaking from the chair, as they say, ex-cathedra.
[2:58:14.240 --> 2:58:20.240]  He doesn't have the authority to talk about science or politics or economics. That's when he talks about that.
[2:58:20.240 --> 2:58:25.240]  He's talking, according to Catholic doctrine, he's just talking about it as just another person commenting on it.
[2:58:25.240 --> 2:58:31.240]  Supposedly, when he talks about religion, which he rarely does, that should tell you something, too, shouldn't it?
[2:58:31.240 --> 2:58:35.240]  But it should tell us all what is going on here. This is an invasion. Stay with us.
[2:58:35.240 --> 2:58:40.240]  We'll take some more of your phone calls on the other side of the break, and then we'll have Owen Troyer coming in for the fourth hour.

[3:00:50.680 --> 3:00:57.080]  david uh i want to talk to two things real quick uh but first i'd like to say the poop in the
[3:00:57.080 --> 3:01:04.360]  vatican he's the uh false prophet in the book of revelations he's a filthy pig so well certainly
[3:01:04.360 --> 3:01:08.920]  we can see what what is happening here i mean it is absolutely he's he's not at the least bit
[3:01:08.920 --> 3:01:15.640]  concerned with the with christianity with christ with even the catholic religion and i think uh
[3:01:15.640 --> 3:01:20.120]  people who've been catholics for a long time many of them i think are starting to see this that it
[3:01:20.120 --> 3:01:25.720]  is completely politicized and he is a shill for the new world order if uh at the very least uh so
[3:01:25.720 --> 3:01:32.760]  go ahead scott yeah uh well i wanted to say too for all you people out there who think uh you got
[3:01:32.760 --> 3:01:40.520]  nothing to hide uh i don't see any of you as jesus christ everyone's got something to hide uh
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:46.600]  whether you're buying drugs on the phone cheating on your husband and wife calling your bookie y'all
[3:01:46.600 --> 3:01:52.360]  everyone's got something to hide and it's called privacy it's none of their business in in 2015
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:59.160]  i was in noxomontana at a blues fest it was my birthday and my kids were sending me happy birthday
[3:01:59.160 --> 3:02:05.800]  uh texas i get a text from track phone saying happy birthday bonus minutes so i call the corporate
[3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:12.760]  headquarters and i say i i bought a 20 phone and pay as you go minutes there's no name no birthday
[3:02:13.400 --> 3:02:18.600]  no address associated with this phone how do you know it was my birthday if you're not reading my text
[3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:26.200]  and the lady goes she goes um oh i understand your question now um do you have any other questions
[3:02:26.200 --> 3:02:30.200]  i said yeah i want to know how you're reading my you're reading my text i said i'll get a
[3:02:30.200 --> 3:02:36.600]  lawyer and i will sue you people and she said if you go ahead and hung up on me okay so that's why
[3:02:36.600 --> 3:02:40.920]  they passed syspa that's why they passed syspa and syssa they called it syssa when they got it through
[3:02:40.920 --> 3:02:44.120]  they wanted to make sure that you couldn't sue them for turning that information over to the
[3:02:44.120 --> 3:02:47.640]  government and one of the things that they want to do well you talk about not having anything to hide
[3:02:48.360 --> 3:02:51.640]  they're not necessarily interested in getting information to blackmail you that's what they're
[3:02:51.640 --> 3:02:55.000]  going to do to the people who are in political power that's why the people in political power
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:58.920]  need to shut this down they're the ones who are more exposed than anybody else but what they want
[3:02:58.920 --> 3:03:03.960]  to do is they want to measure the hive mind and then the other part of it scott is that they want
[3:03:03.960 --> 3:03:11.400]  to expose you to criminals the cia created and funded and then released all of these different
[3:03:11.400 --> 3:03:16.840]  hacks into uh our our equipment our phones our televisions and everything and they left that
[3:03:16.840 --> 3:03:21.880]  there they don't want to fix it wiki leaks julian assign just said look we have told these different
[3:03:21.880 --> 3:03:25.640]  companies about it some of them have responded to us and want to fix these vulnerabilities they
[3:03:25.640 --> 3:03:30.360]  didn't know about it others could couldn't care less about fixing it and they don't want to fix
[3:03:30.360 --> 3:03:33.720]  it because they've got contracts with the government the government that tells you that they want to
[3:03:33.720 --> 3:03:38.680]  put this stuff in here to protect you to give you safety and security they have kicked the door in on
[3:03:38.680 --> 3:03:43.960]  your house broken the lock and they're not going to let that be fixed they put this stuff out in
[3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:48.120]  the wild as john mackip he said look he debated with people about the iphone and they wanted to
[3:03:48.120 --> 3:03:53.080]  get into the iphone he said if you get the key you will lose it you will release it and that's
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:03:56.920]  what they've done as we see with a vault seven that's what they've done with all these exploits
[3:03:56.920 --> 3:04:01.320]  all these hacks they've released them in the public and they don't want to have these things fixed go
[3:04:01.320 --> 3:04:09.880]  ahead it would be uh amazed at the system here that he couldn't create the spy on the average
[3:04:09.880 --> 3:04:14.440]  individual i mean you got common man that want to work their way up in the government and do
[3:04:14.440 --> 3:04:18.440]  something good for the people and then all of a sudden you're being told but you're getting
[3:04:18.440 --> 3:04:25.160]  texas gone we know you cheat on your wife or your husband back down and real quick i want to say to
[3:04:25.160 --> 3:04:33.720]  mr trump um i'm starting to wonder about you we have congressmen senators uh hollywood people
[3:04:33.720 --> 3:04:40.200]  threatening your life and your job one of your jobs is domestic tranquility and keep peace here
[3:04:40.200 --> 3:04:44.360]  you're allowing these people to threaten you and you're doing nothing about it which makes me
[3:04:44.360 --> 3:04:50.520]  fear for my own safety i don't have security like you have to me he's starting to look like a shill
[3:04:51.160 --> 3:04:54.280]  well i'm concerned because of all the threats against him and of course as the washington
[3:04:54.280 --> 3:04:59.160]  post points out they're going to use uh uh kushner to us use a swat team to fix things that
[3:04:59.160 --> 3:05:04.040]  need to make sure that's what he says elon musk and demis hasibis and others clash over artificial
[3:05:04.040 --> 3:05:09.080]  intelligence musk has been public about his concerns for ai for years in 2014 stating with
[3:05:09.080 --> 3:05:13.160]  artificial intelligence we are summoning a demon then sarcastically mocked the thought that man
[3:05:13.160 --> 3:05:17.640]  could be in control of such a demon now musk together with sam altman has started a billion
[3:05:17.640 --> 3:05:22.840]  dollar nonprofit called open ai to work for safer ai in the future it's no surprise that hasibis and
[3:05:22.840 --> 3:05:28.440]  ray Kurzweil would disagree both are working on google ai projects hasibis project is called deep
[3:05:28.440 --> 3:05:33.400]  mind and Kurzweil is collaborating on a project called google brain but musk is taking a different
[3:05:33.400 --> 3:05:38.040]  approach with open ai wanting the technology to be shared with the world rather than the algorithms
[3:05:38.040 --> 3:05:42.040]  be in the hands of a few elites in government and the tech industry musk has also said he

[3:09:39.800 --> 3:09:44.520]  general attorney general jeff sessions takes aim at sanctuary cities i'm reading a headline from
[3:09:44.520 --> 3:09:52.760]  abc news says the department of justice will cut funding now obviously this is just kind of a first
[3:09:52.760 --> 3:09:57.880]  verbal blow i would say to sanctuary series maybe not the first but more of the verbal blow to
[3:09:57.880 --> 3:10:04.680]  sanctuary cities from jeff sessions now threatening to cut the federal funding that was him today
[3:10:04.680 --> 3:10:11.960]  and you know this actually provides an interesting talking point here because i am all for states
[3:10:11.960 --> 3:10:18.760]  rights and there's so much that can come from this think about it sanctuary cities to me don't
[3:10:18.760 --> 3:10:28.680]  make any sense at all it's just a liberal virtue signaling tactic and really a democrat vote
[3:10:28.680 --> 3:10:34.440]  engineering campaign that's really all it is the democrats use sanctuary cities to create more votes
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:40.280]  bring in democrat voters and the liberals love sanctuary cities because they convert you signal
[3:10:40.280 --> 3:10:44.120]  about it all day oh look at what we did with these sanctuary cities we'll take anybody we'll take
[3:10:44.120 --> 3:10:50.440]  everybody and then of course you get stories like what we saw in maryland with the teenager getting
[3:10:50.440 --> 3:10:57.960]  raped but let's get back to attorney general jeff sessions now i am fully behind the attorney
[3:10:57.960 --> 3:11:03.160]  general here cutting federal funding to sanctuary cities i think this is a great move you cut off
[3:11:03.160 --> 3:11:08.280]  the funding all of these sanctuary cities will be kaput the only other option they'll have is to
[3:11:08.280 --> 3:11:13.800]  take private funding which to me okay fine now you're actually making the liberals out there
[3:11:13.800 --> 3:11:18.120]  put their money where their mouth is all these liberals that say let's bring in all these refugees
[3:11:18.120 --> 3:11:22.280]  let's bring in all these immigrants well they're not opening their doors in their multimillion
[3:11:22.280 --> 3:11:29.960]  dollar mansions lee in order to caprio are they the list goes on so now you're forcing sanctuary
[3:11:29.960 --> 3:11:36.200]  cities to die via cutting federal funding or you're forcing liberals to finally put their
[3:11:36.200 --> 3:11:41.320]  money where their mouth is and actually take in some of these poor people that they claim they care
[3:11:41.320 --> 3:11:48.600]  about so much so let's say that jeff sessions who knows how long this process will take i think he's
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:54.120]  putting this out there say hey look sanctuary cities get your act together we're about to cut
[3:11:54.120 --> 3:11:58.760]  your funding giving them an opportunity to actually figure out what they're going to do before he
[3:11:58.760 --> 3:12:03.800]  finally cuts that funding okay so let's say then we reach that point and there will be sanctuary
[3:12:03.800 --> 3:12:08.440]  cities remaining folks there will be guarantee my i would guarantee that they're going to fight
[3:12:08.440 --> 3:12:13.720]  this thing tooth and nail how far this gets as far as uh litigation is concerned i guess we'll
[3:12:13.720 --> 3:12:21.240]  wait and see but if he cuts their federal funding this also creates a new precedent
[3:12:22.360 --> 3:12:29.560]  that some of us might not like where we say okay jeff sessions go ahead and wield your power of
[3:12:29.560 --> 3:12:37.400]  purse over sanctuary cities and end them by cutting federal funding now if this works which
[3:12:37.400 --> 3:12:41.960]  you would assume would be a successful tactic it would force sanctuary cities to go into the private
[3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:47.480]  sector of course now you're dealing with the whole sense of illegal immigration becoming an issue again
[3:12:47.480 --> 3:12:52.200]  people actually following the law so who knows if we'll even need sanctuary cities uh when you
[3:12:52.200 --> 3:12:58.760]  consider that but now you have jeff sessions potentially setting a precedent and realizing
[3:12:58.760 --> 3:13:04.600]  the power of the purse where now he could do this for any policy he doesn't like for example
[3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:10.600]  the legalization of marijuana now this is something that jeff sessions has been very
[3:13:10.600 --> 3:13:17.880]  vocally outspoken about and here's what i would say because to be honest with you
[3:13:19.880 --> 3:13:25.160]  i don't think that jeff sessions really understands the battle he's getting behind with the whole
[3:13:25.800 --> 3:13:31.160]  marijuana legalization or decriminalization or it being a scheduled to drug or whatever it is
[3:13:31.880 --> 3:13:37.400]  because he doesn't understand i think how many constituents actually would not like these policies
[3:13:37.400 --> 3:13:42.200]  that he's putting forward but again this sets an interesting precedent where jeff sessions
[3:13:42.200 --> 3:13:48.520]  can come in and now say hey look uh colorado or washington or the list goes on as more states
[3:13:48.520 --> 3:13:54.440]  start to legalize marijuana we're going to cut your federal funding until you follow the federal
[3:13:54.440 --> 3:14:01.240]  law which marijuana use is a federal crime so while i'm behind jeff sessions cutting federal
[3:14:01.240 --> 3:14:06.680]  funding to sanctuary cities as a means to stop them you also have to realize that this could
[3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:14.280]  be a precedent that jeff sessions sets to impose his will moving forward and so you need to know
[3:14:14.280 --> 3:14:20.920]  what jeff sessions will is as we move forward so we can create a blockade or a support system
[3:14:20.920 --> 3:14:26.200]  for whatever policies or agendas he's going to try to move forward with and here's what i think
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:32.840]  personally to me donald trump right now is taking this campaign not necessarily one
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:38.040]  issue at a time but he's focusing on one issue at a time and then moving his focus to the next
[3:14:38.040 --> 3:14:44.040]  issue whenever he reaches a stall point or a victory point with that issue for example with
[3:14:44.040 --> 3:14:48.920]  health care even though we feel like he put the ball in ryan's court a lot of people say he set
[3:14:48.920 --> 3:14:55.640]  ryan up for for uh failure others are putting the onus on donald trump regardless he's moved on
[3:14:55.640 --> 3:15:01.000]  he's saying okay sorry we put the bill out there we were going to cut planned parenthood funding
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:06.200]  we're going to cut the fines and the taxes we couldn't get that bill passed so donald trump
[3:15:06.200 --> 3:15:12.120]  i mean even though they say he loses really he almost kind of wins if obama care continues
[3:15:12.120 --> 3:15:17.080]  to collapse which it will because he called that from the very beginning so now he moves forward
[3:15:17.080 --> 3:15:21.720]  to the next thing they're saying it's going to be tax reform he's always focusing on jobs we know this
[3:15:22.360 --> 3:15:27.240]  but here's a way i think donald that you could do both and i didn't even main to get off on this
[3:15:27.240 --> 3:15:31.560]  jag but this is where it takes me when i think about jeff sessions wielding the power of the federal
[3:15:31.560 --> 3:15:39.480]  purse and where potentially that could go what donald trump to me needs to realize here and and
[3:15:39.480 --> 3:15:44.120]  jeff sessions if you want to continue attacking drugs like heroin that's fine with me i think
[3:15:44.120 --> 3:15:49.800]  heroin is a serious epidemic in a lot of areas right now it's a growing epidemic uh but marijuana
[3:15:49.800 --> 3:15:54.360]  has not reached nearly the level of epidemic that heroin has and they certainly should not be on the
[3:15:54.360 --> 3:16:00.280]  same playing field but if you look at the economic impact that the legalization of marijuana had on
[3:16:00.280 --> 3:16:05.320]  the state of california i don't see how somebody like donald trump doesn't open his eyes to it
[3:16:06.120 --> 3:16:13.080]  here's a guy that's focused on the economy focused on jobs and legalization of marijuana has helped
[3:16:13.080 --> 3:16:20.440]  both of those in the state of colorado so i don't know if jeff sessions has a similar approach
[3:16:20.440 --> 3:16:27.160]  perhaps in mind to tackling what he views as a problem which is marijuana as far as cutting
[3:16:27.160 --> 3:16:32.440]  the federal funding from states i suppose that want to have marijuana legal but this
[3:16:32.440 --> 3:16:37.320]  is an interesting precedent that jeff sessions could be setting here and of course let's remember
[3:16:37.320 --> 3:16:43.320]  that this goes on not just to sanctuary cities but universities as well and you've got universities
[3:16:43.320 --> 3:16:50.520]  right now that are basically giving scholarships to non-citizens where you could say why aren't
[3:16:50.520 --> 3:16:58.600]  these scholarships going to citizens and of course that goes with welfare etc etc etc now
[3:16:58.600 --> 3:17:03.560]  before we take this break here's another news story that's interesting and and even i am not
[3:17:03.560 --> 3:17:09.480]  fully aware of the scope of this but it seems to be going largely uncovered this is a story from
[3:17:09.480 --> 3:17:16.920]  fox news headline south africa accused of covering up grisly murder spree now some people are calling
[3:17:16.920 --> 3:17:22.280]  this a white genocide i'm really yet to find that proof i'm not saying it is or it isn't
[3:17:22.840 --> 3:17:30.840]  just from the research that i've done what we do have is farmers in south africa getting brutally
[3:17:30.840 --> 3:17:37.320]  murdered folks not just shot in the head or stabbed to death we're talking burned we're talking
[3:17:37.320 --> 3:17:43.880]  tortured we're talking dragged into a ditch absolutely horrific stuff and it's been going on
[3:17:44.600 --> 3:17:56.120]  consistently now consistently now 70 attacks around 25 murders on white farmers so again i i'm not
[3:17:57.160 --> 3:18:03.320]  aware enough of the geo social problems in south africa to call this a white genocide
[3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:11.160]  but however they are deeming this it is being rumored as a cover-up of white genocide the fact
[3:18:11.160 --> 3:18:19.240]  that nobody is talking about this and it really was amazing to me to read these stories because
[3:18:19.240 --> 3:18:25.000]  typically when you have a story like this with such gruesome content involved and of course
[3:18:25.960 --> 3:18:32.200]  could be race-based the mainstream news is all over it but it does seem that they have pretty
[3:18:32.200 --> 3:18:39.400]  much largely ignored this quote-unquote white genocide going on in south africa again i'm
[3:18:39.400 --> 3:18:46.360]  not saying it's a white genocide however the consistency of farmers that happen to be white
[3:18:46.360 --> 3:18:53.160]  being brutally murdered is a story and it is not being covered in the mainstream media at
[3:18:53.160 --> 3:18:58.920]  least as far as i can tell and i pretty much monitor it all day long and i have not seen
[3:18:58.920 --> 3:19:06.200]  one story on this whether it be television news radio news just today i started to see
[3:19:06.200 --> 3:19:14.200]  a surface on social media but pretty much nothing covered there so we'll keep an eye on that now
[3:19:14.200 --> 3:19:18.040]  we've got some more developments this is actually interesting before we go to break i'll try to
[3:19:18.040 --> 3:19:25.320]  cover this associated press tweets this out today breaking senior counter-terror officer says there
[3:19:25.320 --> 3:19:31.320]  was no evidence london attacker was associated with the islamic state or al-qaeda okay wait a
[3:19:31.320 --> 3:19:38.840]  second i've got similar stories today saying the exact opposite saying a he was in contact with ices
[3:19:38.840 --> 3:19:44.680]  but b we can't even get all the evidence because some of these technology firms are not allowing us
[3:19:44.680 --> 3:19:48.680]  in to their media platforms we'll have more on this what do you think on the other side we'll
[3:19:48.680 --> 3:20:00.600]  take your calls oh and shroy or alex joneshow fourth hour they say you can't take on the man

[3:25:01.880 --> 3:25:06.360]  will fail i'm calling it right now now let's get back before i take a couple calls on this
[3:25:07.160 --> 3:25:12.680]  so you've got the Associated Press tweeting out today that the london attacker is not affiliated
[3:25:12.680 --> 3:25:22.680]  with isis hmm okay now on counter reports all over the news isis uses terror attack to sign up youtube
[3:25:22.680 --> 3:25:30.680]  recruits google fails to stop deluge of propaganda videos and it accounts how youtube has videos of
[3:25:30.680 --> 3:25:36.120]  isis recruiting people and then they go and commit heinous crimes it goes on another headline from
[3:25:36.120 --> 3:25:41.880]  the telegraph what's that accused of giving terrorist a secret place to hide as it refuses to
[3:25:41.880 --> 3:25:46.760]  hand over london attackers messages so they don't know that they don't know his messages they don't
[3:25:46.760 --> 3:25:51.960]  know who is messaging him it goes on from the mirror secret text message ordered the lone wolf
[3:25:51.960 --> 3:25:58.200]  to carry out london terror attack a sunday mirror probe was uncovered has uncovered chilling messages
[3:25:58.200 --> 3:26:03.800]  in which jihadi masterminds urged terrorists to mount atrocities in the uk so then how is it
[3:26:04.920 --> 3:26:10.120]  that and they don't source this the ap just says senior counter terror officer says there is no
[3:26:10.120 --> 3:26:15.640]  evidence london attacker was associated with islamic state or al-qaeda now is there no evidence
[3:26:15.640 --> 3:26:24.440]  because they can't get the evidence which is what these other reports are saying or are you just
[3:26:24.440 --> 3:26:32.360]  ignoring all the obvious evidence right in front of your face hey what happened in london somebody
[3:26:32.360 --> 3:26:37.960]  got in a car ran people over and then stabbed somebody what other events has that happened
[3:26:37.960 --> 3:26:45.960]  and where else does that go on how else does that happen oh radical islamic terror but the
[3:26:45.960 --> 3:26:52.680]  associated press is going to tell you that there is no evidence there's no evidence the sun is hot
[3:26:52.680 --> 3:26:56.840]  there's no evidence grass is green there's no evidence evidence that you need oxygen to live
[3:26:56.840 --> 3:27:01.400]  folks thank you associated press what do you think let's take some calls on this who's been
[3:27:01.400 --> 3:27:05.720]  holding the longest let's go to adam who says the left hates women well duh they want to do
[3:27:05.720 --> 3:27:12.760]  elect hillary clinton what are you talking about i'm so confused go ahead adam hey oh and hey uh
[3:27:12.760 --> 3:27:17.320]  thanks for taking my call i had really quick i just wanted to thank you and alex and davin
[3:27:17.320 --> 3:27:23.080]  everyone there had info wars just being the tip of the spear being the voice of reason this
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:31.240]  crazy time that we live in um you know it's not exactly a new ark type uh but just lately you
[3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:35.640]  know the stuff with the rockville case this case out of long island just something i've been noticing
[3:27:35.640 --> 3:27:42.040]  especially on social media you get these leftists these liberals especially i noticed women you
[3:27:42.040 --> 3:27:48.120]  think they'd be um uh defending the victims but they're not they're defending the the rapists and
[3:27:48.120 --> 3:27:53.640]  actually attacking the the victims i just don't understand it i'm having a real hard time with
[3:27:53.640 --> 3:27:58.840]  it well here's what here's what the honestly the psychological thing is that the left or the thought
[3:27:58.840 --> 3:28:05.640]  process of the left has so intertwined these webs of thought in their own head that are nothing but
[3:28:05.640 --> 3:28:09.320]  double standards and hypocrisy that they really don't even know how to think so they're basically
[3:28:09.320 --> 3:28:13.640]  just spinning in a circle all day they don't know whether to blame the woman because of the way she
[3:28:13.640 --> 3:28:19.400]  was dressed whether to blame the rapist because he you know obviously raped the woman that would
[3:28:19.400 --> 3:28:23.640]  be the obvious one you blame the rapist he's the rapist but you know hey he's from a different
[3:28:23.640 --> 3:28:28.520]  culture you know where it was okay and he's just feeling all this pressure coming into a new city
[3:28:28.520 --> 3:28:32.840]  he's just not comfortable it's not his fault look at that woman she had a halter top on
[3:28:32.840 --> 3:28:37.400]  she was asking to be raped so what you're talking about here is just the double think on the left
[3:28:37.400 --> 3:28:41.640]  and i mean that's really what it comes down to it's just double think mindless twists
[3:28:43.160 --> 3:28:47.720]  that have i mean honestly liberalism has become a mental disorder modern day liberalism
[3:28:47.720 --> 3:28:54.280]  is a mental disorder let's take another call let's go to uh evalyn in texas real quick evalyn go ahead
[3:28:54.280 --> 3:29:03.720]  hi uh oh and this is evalyn i'm calling about uh issue that was a little bit earlier concerning
[3:29:04.440 --> 3:29:15.480]  education here in texas i'm in the houston area 50 percent of the elite independent
[3:29:15.480 --> 3:29:25.720]  school district is hispanic and assuming that just a few of those are illegals i found out just
[3:29:25.720 --> 3:29:36.680]  recently that none of the schools asked for or will ask for a post security number and or a
[3:29:36.680 --> 3:29:47.000]  eight um a certificate of birth wow but they'll ask all of us for our vaccines i promise you
[3:29:47.000 --> 3:29:50.840]  that more of the alex joneshow on the other side we got a statement from alex on the other side of
[3:29:50.840 --> 3:30:01.400]  this break alex jones and the gcn radio network more fallout from the london isis terror attack
[3:30:01.400 --> 3:30:05.960]  as it is being reported on again that isis is using youtube as a platform to put out violent
[3:30:05.960 --> 3:30:10.120]  recruitment videos as propaganda to further their religious caliphate it is said that the
[3:30:10.120 --> 3:30:14.200]  london terrorist thug was using whatsapp to send his final messages but scotland yard and other
[3:30:14.200 --> 3:30:18.600]  investigative authorities cannot access these messages because whatsapp itself says it cannot
[3:30:18.600 --> 3:30:22.760]  retrieve them this again creates the battle between media platforms consumers protected
[3:30:22.760 --> 3:30:28.200]  privacy and governments access into such databases but what really needs to be asked how does youtube
[3:30:28.200 --> 3:30:33.480]  allow isis to operate on its platform when some info wars videos have been removed for content
[3:30:33.480 --> 3:30:39.160]  you're telling me no one from the fbi or nothing from the cia vault seven technologies can be used
[3:30:39.160 --> 3:30:43.800]  to track down whoever is posting these terrorist recruitment videos it seems to me that we not
[3:30:43.800 --> 3:30:48.680]  only have a terrorist problem we have a priority problem enabling these terrorists to operate
[3:30:48.680 --> 3:30:54.040]  online where conservative media is targeted before islamic terrorist hate speech this is owen

[3:33:09.000 --> 3:33:17.160]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you right from the front lines of the info war
[3:33:17.160 --> 3:33:30.680]  on friday i issued a statement on info wars dot com but also broadcast on my daily show
[3:33:31.800 --> 3:33:38.760]  basically clarifying my position concerning what has become known as the pizza gate controversy
[3:33:38.760 --> 3:33:44.760]  and apologizing to james aliphonus of comet ping pong pizza in dc now why did i do that
[3:33:44.760 --> 3:33:52.360]  that because i am preparing to go on the offense against real child traffickers and those abusing
[3:33:52.360 --> 3:34:00.760]  children and because going back to december first of last year i have told my crew and info wars
[3:34:00.760 --> 3:34:09.640]  that i believed this to be a manufactured controversy by msm to discredit those researching
[3:34:09.640 --> 3:34:17.240]  and exposing the epidemic across the world of powerful elites and others abusing and exploiting
[3:34:17.240 --> 3:34:24.680]  children so please take notes and research for yourself the bombshell information i'm about to
[3:34:24.680 --> 3:34:35.240]  cover in early november of 2016 we began to get exclusive information from law enforcement
[3:34:35.240 --> 3:34:42.840]  department giving us tips into open source areas to research and it dealt with the clinton's and
[3:34:42.840 --> 3:34:49.800]  with prominent members of the democratic party admittedly going to allister crowley events and
[3:34:50.520 --> 3:34:55.720]  the bizarre information inside the wiki leaks emails we didn't know exactly what to make of
[3:34:55.720 --> 3:35:02.280]  but our law enforcement sources in new york and new jersey said watch anthony weiner is going to
[3:35:02.280 --> 3:35:09.800]  be investigated for child porn on his phone and contacting minors we were the first to report that
[3:35:09.800 --> 3:35:16.360]  because we had sources but before we could get all that information looked at suddenly people on
[3:35:16.360 --> 3:35:24.520]  online message boards and forums began to get distracted to a pizza place in dc then ms nbc
[3:35:24.520 --> 3:35:30.280]  cnn you name it the washington post new york times they focused on comet ping pong because there
[3:35:30.280 --> 3:35:35.720]  had been code words in new york concerning pizza that law enforcement was saying was connected to
[3:35:35.720 --> 3:35:42.440]  possible child pornography and trafficking that was separate so msm began to focus on a pizza
[3:35:42.440 --> 3:35:47.960]  place that did have some prominent democrats going to it what we now know is an attempt to
[3:35:47.960 --> 3:35:55.560]  distract everyone on to the probably completely innocent pizza place away from the bombshell
[3:35:55.560 --> 3:36:01.400]  information unfolding in new york and other areas so as soon as i began to figure that out
[3:36:01.400 --> 3:36:06.840]  long before i was attacked in msm for covering it long before mr aliphana sent me a letter
[3:36:06.840 --> 3:36:13.160]  just a month ago saying he liked me to retract i clicked to it why was everybody focusing on
[3:36:13.160 --> 3:36:20.280]  this pizza place and not on all the incredible bombshells we saw happening in new york hawaii
[3:36:20.280 --> 3:36:27.400]  california you name it so to be clear the reason i put this letter out to mr aliphana's
[3:36:27.400 --> 3:36:31.720]  is because i believe he and his employees are innocent people that have been sucked into this
[3:36:31.720 --> 3:36:36.600]  just like i've been sucked into it and if msm would just be honest they could track back
[3:36:36.600 --> 3:36:41.800]  and see this for themselves but regardless i did this because it's the right thing to do
[3:36:42.440 --> 3:36:49.080]  just like by december first i clicked to what was going on and have been proven right yet again
[3:36:49.080 --> 3:36:55.400]  so let's walk through the atmosphere and the news that we were looking at in november and
[3:36:55.400 --> 3:37:00.120]  december and why there was so much hysteria concerning what was happening in the washington
[3:37:00.120 --> 3:37:09.400]  dc area as part of my anti trafficking work i've met victims in russia i've met victims in india
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:14.520]  i've met victims that have been trafficked from mexico victims in new york and new jersey and
[3:37:14.520 --> 3:37:22.200]  all across our country i've been on fbi rates where i've seen things that no person should
[3:37:22.200 --> 3:37:30.920]  ever see these are the men and women to thank for the rescuing of 27 adult and 28 juvenile females
[3:37:30.920 --> 3:37:39.160]  and arresting 36 suspected traffickers and 142 so-called john's predators in total there were
[3:37:39.160 --> 3:37:45.960]  474 criminal arrests made statewide in this operation more damning the free report accuses
[3:37:45.960 --> 3:37:53.400]  paterno of stopping his superiors plan to report sandusky to authorities in 2001 another email saying
[3:37:53.400 --> 3:37:59.320]  the plan changed after quote talking it over with joe sandusky would go on to assault at least seven
[3:37:59.320 --> 3:38:07.320]  other boys between 2001 and 2009 their cover up of sandusky's behavior is the direct cause
[3:38:07.320 --> 3:38:15.960]  of my clients being molested by sandusky in 2007 and 2008 who has finally dropped a years
[3:38:15.960 --> 3:38:23.160]  long sexual abuse scandal involving bbc tv and radio stars dj kimmy savill and stewart hall a
[3:38:23.160 --> 3:38:29.880]  serial rapist and a predatory sexual abuser both hid in plain sight at the bbc for decades chimmy
[3:38:29.880 --> 3:38:35.320]  savill far from being a lone predator seemingly played an active role in supplying children
[3:38:35.320 --> 3:38:41.240]  to a network of child abusers in london is the width of an establishment cover up yes it there
[3:38:41.240 --> 3:38:45.800]  that's the suggestion i mean these are allegations they're very serious i mean this is criminal
[3:38:45.800 --> 3:38:52.280]  pedophilia on a large scale is absolutely awful these are the alarming posts catching the attention
[3:38:52.280 --> 3:38:58.920]  of social media users across the country a series of tweets by washington dc police asking to help
[3:38:58.920 --> 3:39:04.600]  find nearly a dozen black teenage girls reported missing over the course of just three days that's
[3:39:04.600 --> 3:39:09.560]  fairly routine i mean while we say 70 percent of the kids are the most vulnerable from foster care
[3:39:09.560 --> 3:39:14.280]  and other other backgrounds like that uh you know we have a lot of a lot of people from
[3:39:14.280 --> 3:39:19.640]  you know all sorts of neighborhoods a diverse background uh you know more affluent kids kids
[3:39:19.640 --> 3:39:26.120]  who don't have as much in early december i distanced myself my crew at info wars dot com
[3:39:26.120 --> 3:39:33.320]  from the entire pizza gate narrative because i realized it was distracting from hardcore confirmed
[3:39:33.320 --> 3:39:42.040]  news reports of children being abused and sexually assaulted on a mass scale i distanced myself from
[3:39:42.040 --> 3:39:49.560]  it because it was clearly a contrived distraction from the real crimes taking place less than a day
[3:39:49.560 --> 3:39:55.080]  and a half after putting out my clarification slash retraction thousands of publications
[3:39:55.080 --> 3:40:01.320]  hundreds of tv stations and major networks have picked up my retraction many of them twisting it
[3:40:01.320 --> 3:40:07.160]  it'll be interesting to see even the interest of children they actually report now on what
[3:40:07.160 --> 3:40:13.880]  we're about to break down here's a headline on a town hall why the msm is ignoring trump's sex
[3:40:13.880 --> 3:40:20.280]  trafficking bust that are massive we're going to get to that here in just a few minutes but first
[3:40:20.280 --> 3:40:25.880]  let's look at some of the things that have happened in just the last few years of why when we saw the
[3:40:25.880 --> 3:40:31.240]  potesta emails come out in new york and when law enforcement was telling us they were investigating
[3:40:31.240 --> 3:40:38.040]  it uh for code words and connection to child abuse very very serious alleged child abuse uh
[3:40:38.040 --> 3:40:42.680]  that we took it so seriously here's some of the headlines with people associated with the clintons

[3:41:14.840 --> 3:41:21.800]  going on there including satanism alistair crowley stuff we've got laura sillsby who works for the
[3:41:21.800 --> 3:41:28.360]  or did work for the clinton foundation convicted of smuggling out children from haydie and that
[3:41:28.360 --> 3:41:34.120]  ties into all the news headlines we're seeing right now about all the missing kids in dc that's why
[3:41:34.120 --> 3:41:39.320]  people are so concerned of course remember in the wiki leaks spirit cooking clinton campaign
[3:41:39.320 --> 3:41:45.480]  chairman practices bizarre cult ritual that the high priestess admits is alistair crowley black magic
[3:41:45.480 --> 3:41:53.160]  magic using blood semen uh breastmilk you name it and this is the type of stuff that was going on
[3:41:53.160 --> 3:41:59.560]  in new york with pedesta in the emails anthony weiner connected to it umma abedin you name it
[3:41:59.560 --> 3:42:05.320]  law enforcement begs the world read hillary's emails to find child rape evidence kit daniel
[3:42:05.320 --> 3:42:11.000]  november 5th before it was anywhere that weiner was being investigated for sexting underage people
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:17.320]  or child porn that's in the article from our law enforcement sources talking about anthony weiner
[3:42:18.120 --> 3:42:24.120]  so this is the climate this is the climate with the wiki leaks with the information with all this
[3:42:24.120 --> 3:42:31.480]  coming out with downing street and scotland yards saying national pedophile scandal at the highest
[3:42:31.480 --> 3:42:37.480]  levels of government may bring down the whole country a giant pedophile networks in control
[3:42:37.480 --> 3:42:43.400]  we're reading this in major newspapers than seeing it in wiki leaks and trying to investigate it
[3:42:43.400 --> 3:42:49.720]  police launched criminal investigation into mp's child sex ring jimmy savel was part of satanic
[3:42:49.720 --> 3:42:57.480]  ring children dying the sex with dead children satanic rituals royal family mainstream news folks
[3:42:58.760 --> 3:43:03.480]  then trump gets in just as we've been told by law enforcement he was planning to go after him
[3:43:03.480 --> 3:43:09.800]  474 arrested 28 sexually exploited children rescued in bondage during statewide human
[3:43:09.800 --> 3:43:17.000]  trafficking operation that was february 1st we told you those busts were coming so now you know
[3:43:17.000 --> 3:43:21.800]  i'm not going to let the media because some internet trolls focused on some pizza place
[3:43:21.800 --> 3:43:29.560]  distract serious investigations away from what's really happening and give real networks to cover
[3:43:29.560 --> 3:43:35.080]  they're looking for to demonize the idea that any children are being exploited that any children
[3:43:35.080 --> 3:43:39.480]  are being kidnapped that any children are being raped that any children are being killed when we
[3:43:39.480 --> 3:43:43.880]  know this has come out tens of thousands of times and that's what the media has done now
[3:43:43.880 --> 3:43:49.320]  i see them ridiculing people claiming the catholic church has abused her rape kids or covered it up
[3:43:49.320 --> 3:43:54.760]  i'm now hearing forget what happened with penn state and sandusky and now his son being arrested
[3:43:54.760 --> 3:44:01.800]  i'm hearing just it doesn't exist the exploitation of children is a conspiracy theory while nambla
[3:44:01.800 --> 3:44:08.840]  the north american manboy love association has been accepted by the un as an NGO and now leftist
[3:44:08.840 --> 3:44:15.560]  groups even salon are pushing saying legalized pedophilia the very groups that criticize us
[3:44:15.560 --> 3:44:23.560]  and say it doesn't exist now you begin to see exactly why early on i clicked weeks into it
[3:44:23.560 --> 3:44:30.360]  but exactly what was happening look at these headlines after exposure of pedophiles bbc scar
[3:44:30.360 --> 3:44:35.960]  probe widens the uk parliament missing black girls in dc sparks outrage prompts calls for
[3:44:35.960 --> 3:44:40.600]  federal help the police say black girls are getting grabbed out the street but a week later the news
[3:44:40.600 --> 3:44:46.760]  says conspiracy theory they all ran away let's say most of them ran away what happened to all the
[3:44:46.760 --> 3:44:51.960]  others but they always say it's a runaway don't they again to be clear it doesn't take a rocket
[3:44:51.960 --> 3:44:56.440]  scientist to understand this you just got to pull back and look at all the evidence and everything
[3:44:56.440 --> 3:45:01.640]  that's happening to see how clear it is and by late november i was already telling crew
[3:45:02.600 --> 3:45:09.160]  this is a honeypot it's a distraction from all the real admitted stuff with haydie and
[3:45:09.160 --> 3:45:16.440]  epstein and then the clinton's and the un and people working for the foundation being convicted
[3:45:16.440 --> 3:45:23.320]  of child trafficking and then boom sure enough by the middle of december after i'd already
[3:45:23.960 --> 3:45:28.760]  completely distance ourselves from this and had been the first in the alternative news community
[3:45:28.760 --> 3:45:35.640]  to say this is wrong this comet ping pong thing is a distraction we got singled out by
[3:45:35.640 --> 3:45:44.120]  meghan kelly on fox news mpr you name it by editing clips of where i was sitting to our audience
[3:45:44.120 --> 3:45:47.640]  i don't know about sex rings i don't know about hillary actually been involved in that
[3:45:47.640 --> 3:45:52.360]  but funding libya funding the syrian invasion killed hundreds of thousands of people tens of
[3:45:52.360 --> 3:45:57.560]  thousands of kids and even top lawyers say she's a war criminal and bragged about all the things
[3:45:57.560 --> 3:46:03.160]  she did in libya and madeline albright and the 500 000 dead kids so right there isn't just child
[3:46:03.160 --> 3:46:10.040]  abuse it's child murder tell the red hillary clinton is one of the most vicious serial killers
[3:46:10.040 --> 3:46:18.440]  the planet's ever seen there's a twist to that am i talking about the devil worship story with
[3:46:18.440 --> 3:46:24.760]  her chief staff or campaign chairman is leading at the menu of blood and semen and body parts
[3:46:24.760 --> 3:46:30.680]  at the ellisher crawley event the private event oh no i'm not talking about that i mean 200 000
[3:46:30.680 --> 3:46:36.120]  plus dead christians with her operation with syria and her operation in libya and not letting
[3:46:36.120 --> 3:46:41.240]  the christians get out and directing al qaeda and isis who target and murder children and put
[3:46:41.240 --> 3:46:47.320]  up their sex slavery and throw catholic priest off cliffs and kill people in mass and murder gays
[3:46:47.320 --> 3:46:52.680]  and everything else you can imagine because they don't like peaceful people and they caught everybody
[3:46:52.680 --> 3:46:59.240]  there for open society and they love everybody anything they do is for degradation info wars
[3:46:59.240 --> 3:47:05.960]  alex jones a far right web host posted a youtube video seen almost 500 000 times
[3:47:18.360 --> 3:47:25.160]  so you just saw it for yourself we clearly were talking about libya and syria but they
[3:47:25.160 --> 3:47:32.120]  think you're so stupid they took it and broadcasts it again saying that i was saying
[3:47:32.120 --> 3:47:37.640]  hillary was torturing people in the bottom of the dc pizza place now that makes me look bad
[3:47:38.200 --> 3:47:43.880]  that makes people on the street mad at me and also a lot of folks don't trust msm so they
[3:47:43.880 --> 3:47:50.440]  use my credibility twisted on fox news on npr and a bunch of other channels to have me say
[3:47:50.440 --> 3:47:56.600]  that it was literally happening when i didn't to then actually create more hysteria and send more
[3:47:56.600 --> 3:48:02.920]  people to go to comic ping pong see how that works they edit what i say rebroadcast it
[3:48:02.920 --> 3:48:08.360]  then the controversy only gets worse and they blame me in the independent press and then call for
[3:48:08.360 --> 3:48:13.880]  censorship and the shutdown of our free society and someone could have been killed inside of your
[3:48:13.880 --> 3:48:20.680]  restaurant for no good reason other than people like alex jones fanned a conspiracy theory that
[3:48:20.680 --> 3:48:28.760]  even the dc police say has no basis in fact now of the hundreds of publications that openly lied
[3:48:28.760 --> 3:48:34.360]  and said that i said that hillary was torturing people uh in the bottom of a non-existent basement
[3:48:34.360 --> 3:48:39.640]  only the washington post as bad as they are told the truth now they quoted me out of context and
[3:48:39.640 --> 3:48:45.240]  said that i said hillary was killing kids but then they said he later tied it back to syria no i did
[3:48:45.240 --> 3:48:50.440]  it in the same one minute clip you've already seen that's why they always only put audio up on
[3:48:50.440 --> 3:48:55.800]  screen and not video because it looks so edited if they actually show the chopped up clip but the
[3:48:55.800 --> 3:49:02.360]  story where the wash the post got it right was pizza gate from rumor to hashtag to gunfire in dc
[3:49:02.360 --> 3:49:09.160]  but in this they admit that i was talking about syria not dc and that's why the public doesn't
[3:49:09.160 --> 3:49:15.320]  trust establishment media they distort not only did megan kelly and others take out a context what
[3:49:15.320 --> 3:49:21.080]  i was saying about hillary and her war crimes they then also covered up the fact that i was exposing
[3:49:21.080 --> 3:49:27.160]  admitted war crimes where madeline albright's admitted that 500 000 iraqi children died under
[3:49:27.160 --> 3:49:32.840]  her bill clinton hillary clinton sanctions that that was okay we have heard that a half a million
[3:49:32.840 --> 3:49:41.880]  children have died i mean that's more children than died when went in hiroshima and and you know is
[3:49:41.880 --> 3:49:48.600]  the price worth it i think this is a very hard choice but the price we think the price is worth it
[3:49:49.400 --> 3:49:54.440]  and of course hillary making jokes about what happened with the massive deaths that took place
[3:49:54.440 --> 3:49:59.720]  when she launched that entire operation that created a felt state in libya so i mean that is the land
[3:49:59.720 --> 3:50:08.440]  of unconfirmed yes we came we saw he died did you have anything to do with your visit no i'm sure
[3:50:10.440 --> 3:50:15.320]  so if they don't care about all these kids being enslaved by isis and al-qaeda they don't care about
[3:50:15.320 --> 3:50:20.200]  them being killed then how do you think they don't care about kids in haiti or other places this
[3:50:20.200 --> 3:50:29.080]  illustrates how cold blood of these people are in closing my entire system my entire economy
[3:50:29.080 --> 3:50:36.360]  is about being genuine and telling the truth i said there were no wnds in iraq in 2003 i told you
[3:50:36.360 --> 3:50:41.720]  donald trump was going to win the election the polls were fake i told you that household appliances
[3:50:42.440 --> 3:50:47.720]  were having spy systems put into them 15 years ago because i had the schematics it's now on the news
[3:50:48.600 --> 3:50:55.480]  the truth is ladies and gentlemen we're cutting edge we're trailblazers at info wars and my whole
[3:50:55.480 --> 3:51:00.280]  world is about telling the truth and being honest and having integrity and that's why
[3:51:00.280 --> 3:51:09.240]  when i saw us being sucked in to msm picking up the most obscure rumors online and magnifying it
[3:51:09.240 --> 3:51:16.520]  and i saw us then reporting on it i had everything we'd put up removed because i didn't want to add
[3:51:16.520 --> 3:51:22.360]  fuel to the fire and i went on tv and the radio in early december and i told our listeners it was
[3:51:22.360 --> 3:51:30.280]  distraction but of course msm is still out there lying claiming that i just retracted all of this
[3:51:31.160 --> 3:51:37.800]  because aliphana sent me a letter no i openly officially retracted and apologized because
[3:51:37.800 --> 3:51:44.280]  that's a way of clearly cutting off the lies saying that i'm promoting this damn thing
[3:51:44.280 --> 3:51:51.400]  when since december first i've been publicly against it and i can sleep good at night knowing
[3:51:51.400 --> 3:51:56.520]  that all of that will come out when there's a true investigation or if there's any court action
[3:51:57.800 --> 3:52:03.320]  i stand on the truth and nothing more and i'm not going to let the exploiters of children
[3:52:03.960 --> 3:52:09.880]  like mr eppstein and bill clinton who's clearly involved and others sit there and distract and
[3:52:09.880 --> 3:52:17.880]  divert to a lower politico who i believe they've been using all along just like they've been using
[3:52:17.880 --> 3:52:24.920]  me and that's why i'm angry and that's why i'm speaking out and that's why i'm telling the
[3:52:24.920 --> 3:52:31.160]  truth about what happened to some of our viewers and others the abuse of children exploitation and
[3:52:31.160 --> 3:52:38.360]  their sexual abuse is very serious so when you go with half-baked conspiracies and when you run
[3:52:38.360 --> 3:52:43.160]  around and say that i'm covering all this up because i'm trying to actually go for the truth
[3:52:43.160 --> 3:52:48.280]  you add to the hysteria and you create a smokescreen that distracts from the real
[3:52:48.840 --> 3:52:55.160]  bonafide meat and potatoes issues that we can prove and then that gives political cover
[3:52:55.160 --> 3:53:01.240]  to the real child abusers that are there that said though we're going to start making a major
[3:53:02.440 --> 3:53:08.920]  concerted professional focus on the exploitation of children sex trafficking or more we've always
[3:53:08.920 --> 3:53:15.640]  done it but now we have a true duty to make this our focus to go after the real research
[3:53:15.640 --> 3:53:21.160]  and the real court cases and the real admissions that are there so to all the pedophiles and all
[3:53:21.160 --> 3:53:28.840]  the scum and all the controllers out there who think that they're going to use these distractions
[3:53:28.840 --> 3:53:35.960]  and these mainstream media lies to to to have a smokescreen to abuse children info wars is going
[3:53:35.960 --> 3:53:42.040]  on the offensive against the organizations that are known and documented like the united
[3:53:42.040 --> 3:53:46.680]  nations and others to be involved in this and i want to ask our viewers and listeners to understand
[3:53:46.680 --> 3:53:51.480]  it is now more important than ever that you go out and continue your important research to keep
[3:53:51.480 --> 3:53:58.760]  your eyes and ears open i'm alex jones and this is the info war welcome back to the alex jones

[3:54:09.400 --> 3:54:14.200]  fluoride free toothpaste and let me tell you something about this product the reason why
[3:54:14.200 --> 3:54:20.040]  it's so popular is because it really is great it really is a game changer i'm somebody that
[3:54:20.040 --> 3:54:27.160]  changed toothpaste a while ago to get the fluoride toothpaste out of my cabinet and it was a really
[3:54:27.160 --> 3:54:33.000]  expensive brand of toothpaste that i switched to super blue is cheaper and better i'm not kidding
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:37.320]  you i love this toothpaste everybody info wars that uses it loves it everybody out there that buys
[3:54:37.320 --> 3:54:42.440]  it uses it their families love it and that's why it keeps getting sold out so make sure you get
[3:54:42.440 --> 3:54:49.080]  your supply of super blue fluoride free toothpaste now because it will sell out again and this is
[3:54:49.080 --> 3:54:54.120]  so important so many great ingredients in there the peppermint oil the iodine show me another
[3:54:54.120 --> 3:55:00.360]  toothpaste with iodine and nano silver in it i bet you can't do it infowarstore.com is your only
[3:55:00.360 --> 3:55:05.240]  source probably the best toothpaste in the world at least by my opinion i also want to let you guys
[3:55:05.240 --> 3:55:11.000]  know that right after this if you stay tuned on the alex jones channel on youtube a lot of our radio
[3:55:11.000 --> 3:55:15.400]  audience might not even know about this go to the alex jones channel on youtube we got our own
[3:55:15.400 --> 3:55:20.440]  youtube channel there and i will actually be hosting another live broadcast with rob do talking
[3:55:20.440 --> 3:55:25.720]  about some of the movements of the left some of the movements in china and so on now we've got a
[3:55:25.720 --> 3:55:29.480]  caller in indiana mark that we're going to go to he says he wants to talk about 9-11 but i'm just
[3:55:29.480 --> 3:55:35.640]  going to preface this so i don't have to interrupt mark if we could find out the truth about 9-11 if
[3:55:35.640 --> 3:55:40.520]  we could all come together to find out the truth about 9-11 because even the left whether they
[3:55:40.520 --> 3:55:45.320]  admitted or not is treating 9-11 like it's an inside job now they might be treating it like that
[3:55:45.320 --> 3:55:50.440]  for other reasons uh for their liberal thought process but basically they're blaming america now
[3:55:50.440 --> 3:55:55.400]  for 9-11 so why can't we just come together find out the truth about 9-11 i think that would
[3:55:55.400 --> 3:56:01.800]  solve a lot of problems for the world mark what do you have to say on the issue absolutely this
[3:56:01.800 --> 3:56:05.880]  is because this is going to make you laugh you won't believe this i made it on live television
[3:56:05.880 --> 3:56:12.280]  here in indianapolis uh so there are these two towers two twin apartment towers uh called the
[3:56:12.280 --> 3:56:17.720]  keystone towers and um i saw that they were going to be demolished so i thought oh my god
[3:56:17.720 --> 3:56:22.360]  i'm going to go down there with the 9-11 truth now sign but it turned out better than i ever
[3:56:22.360 --> 3:56:27.480]  imagined you should you can find this clip on youtube uh keystone towers come crumbling down
[3:56:27.480 --> 3:56:33.400]  and uh it's a three-minute 22 second video and i think one minute 50 is where i make it on live
[3:56:33.400 --> 3:56:38.600]  television so so there's like hundreds of people and there's a big podium where the mayor speaking
[3:56:38.600 --> 3:56:45.960]  has got like all the uh local news microphones and uh uh so i casually walk up to the front
[3:56:45.960 --> 3:56:50.840]  everyone's turned around doing the 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 waiting for the countdown for the two buildings
[3:56:50.840 --> 3:56:56.120]  to uh be demolished these two old apartment buildings here in indianapolis the keystone towers
[3:56:56.120 --> 3:57:02.600]  and uh so i i really casually just walked up onto the stage walked right up to the microphones
[3:57:02.600 --> 3:57:07.960]  and when the two towers were done collapsing i screamed right to the microphone the truth about
[3:57:07.960 --> 3:57:14.440]  9 11 is right in front of you 9 11 was an inside job you've got to see this video wow we've got our
[3:57:14.440 --> 3:57:17.880]  crew hey we've got our crew looking into that right now we'll try to find it but let me ask you this
