[00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.911]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:11.532]  Broadcasting Worldwide.
[00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:12.113]  I'm your host.
[00:00:12.113 --> 00:00:14.394]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:00:14.394 --> 00:00:16.895]  Broadcasting Worldwide.
[00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:18.896]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:30.922]  I'm gonna air this special report because they are banning YouTube channels that report on the pedophile that teaches your children in Houston.
[00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:32.163]  They're trying to protect him.
[00:00:32.163 --> 00:00:33.824]  Here's what Google's protecting right now.
[00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:41.176]  I don't want to give away our game plan, but just metaphysically, I feel like I always have to.
[00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:49.363]  Because these pedos can't help themselves, but I still have to warn them, because I don't want to entrap them, even though I'm not bringing the kids to them.
[00:00:49.363 --> 00:00:52.145]  Still, I want them to know we're watching.
[00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:55.647]  If law enforcement's controlled or being blocked, we're not.
[00:00:55.647 --> 00:01:04.154]  And we're legally and lawfully going to be investigating all of these drag queen festivals that are in public spaces.
[00:01:06.101 --> 00:01:11.383]  Whether they're in public schools, whether they're in libraries, whether they're in hotels, we're going to be watching you.
[00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:12.803]  In fact, I've made a full commitment.
[00:01:12.803 --> 00:01:16.724]  We've already done some funding on this in the last year.
[00:01:16.724 --> 00:01:33.470]  You're seeing that pay off in Houston with a hardcore child rapist who was leading operations against Children as Young as Two with the knowing accomplices in the government of Houston, which is now a pedo command base.
[00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.190]  And I have that from
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.261]  The U.S.
[00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:38.502]  Army, federal law enforcement, you name it.
[00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:40.284]  Very dangerous city now.
[00:01:40.284 --> 00:01:41.565]  Very evil.
[00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:45.488]  Doesn't mean all the police are bad, but it's in trouble.
[00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:52.754]  This is Albert Garza, a registered child sex offender, convicted in 2008 for molesting an 8-year-old boy.
[00:01:52.754 --> 00:01:59.159]  This is also him, Tatiana Malanina, his drag queen alter ego.
[00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.503]  This is who's been reading to kids at Houston Public Library since last year.
[00:02:03.843 --> 00:02:06.565]  Shame on these individuals in this building behind me.
[00:02:06.565 --> 00:02:12.769]  Mass resistance claims it's been asking the city for months to disclose information about the drag queens.
[00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.432]  And when requests went unanswered, they did their own digging and made the shocking link.
[00:02:18.432 --> 00:02:28.859]  If they had done their job in due diligence, if they had said, wait, maybe not a good idea to have a sex offender who, at 200 pounds and 5'11", assaulted an 8-year-old boy,
[00:02:32.446 --> 00:02:40.511]  A statement from the Houston Public Library says, in part, we failed to complete a background check as required by our own guidelines.
[00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:42.573]  We deeply regret this oversight.
[00:02:42.573 --> 00:02:50.638]  Your parents would not allow that individual to sit in this library, sashay in, and
[00:02:51.278 --> 00:02:53.579]  Be held up as a role model to our children.
[00:02:53.579 --> 00:03:12.567]  The group in question, the so-called Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, is sending a message that they have the power to enter into the public domain, a publicly funded institution, I believe, not a private one, and to essentially hold a catechism class for this new religion.
[00:03:13.247 --> 00:03:39.523]  That they've created a religion of hedonism of self-indulgence sisters of perpetual Indulgence say a religion of licentiousness the Achilles heel Of these quote drag queen events being held from Germany to England to the United States to Canada all choreographed exactly the same run by the same group and promoted by mainstream media All you got to do is go
[00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:48.426]  And all you gotta do is pick out the obvious creepoids, including those involved, and all you gotta do is go get their license plate.
[00:03:48.426 --> 00:03:54.091]  Or if you got the proper accreditation in law enforcement or private detectives, follow them home, even if they're on foot.
[00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:58.114]  People are like, don't tell them they're getting their plate numbers, we're not stupid.
[00:03:58.114 --> 00:04:00.896]  I want them to know, I want them to stop it.
[00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:04.539]  The point is, is that how do pedophiles come after your kids?
[00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:07.221]  They dress up like women in disguises.
[00:04:08.243 --> 00:04:13.647]  My God, it's 101, pedos dress up like clowns or other things, so their identity's not known.
[00:04:13.647 --> 00:04:16.269]  This is out in the open.
[00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:24.496]  You don't just think this convicted child rapist in Houston, who was running the story time for kids, not just by the way at libraries, it's going on public schools, you name it.
[00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:28.239]  The government's trying to cover it up, the local government is, it's all coming out.
[00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:30.661]  You don't just think, he stops there.
[00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:33.983]  These people, like him, are the operatives
[00:04:34.944 --> 00:04:43.068]  As I've told you, everything in Bram Stoker's books are allegories to how the elites actually operated.
[00:04:43.068 --> 00:04:50.612]  And you've got the Renfield that just wants to strangle kids and have sex with them and, you know, eat brooches and things.
[00:04:50.612 --> 00:04:52.813]  Men are rats.
[00:04:52.813 --> 00:04:54.153]  But who's he work for?
[00:04:54.153 --> 00:04:57.055]  He works for... The Dragon.
[00:05:00.347 --> 00:05:04.989]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:09.230]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:17.173]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[00:05:17.173 --> 00:05:20.295]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[00:05:20.295 --> 00:05:23.776]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[00:05:25.106 --> 00:05:28.249]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.291]  We are the power structure.
[00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:31.892]  We are the inventors.
[00:05:31.892 --> 00:05:33.673]  We are the trailblazers.
[00:05:33.673 --> 00:05:37.076]  And the globalists understand that.
[00:05:37.076 --> 00:05:44.183]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[00:05:44.183 --> 00:05:48.006]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[00:05:49.034 --> 00:06:03.526]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:06.188]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:06.188 --> 00:06:11.352]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.414]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:33.414 --> 00:06:44.462]  The control corporate left all across this planet is launching massive total censorship that dwarfs anything that even happened to yours truly last year.
[00:06:44.462 --> 00:06:48.385]  We're gonna be looking at all of it today.
[00:06:48.385 --> 00:06:56.071]  Also, the dictator of Turkey has said we will fill body bags full of
[00:06:57.791 --> 00:07:02.533]  Of New Zealanders and Australians, just like we have before.
[00:07:02.533 --> 00:07:10.497]  That's the Islamic response, is for him to play the massacre on TV and say, we're going to conquer the planet, Islam's going to dominate.
[00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:11.077]  And why not?
[00:07:11.077 --> 00:07:16.960]  The media covers up all the Islamic murder, that's thousands of times what the scumbag did.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.102]  They only humanized Muslims, because that's part of the plan!
[00:07:22.102 --> 00:07:23.543]  Who else is being dehumanized?
[00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:26.064]  Bizarre Guardian writer,
[00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.332]  Suggests white people aren't human in a new tweet.
[00:07:31.332 --> 00:07:37.375]  Well, she'll probably get a job as the on the board of directors of the New York Times.
[00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:38.595]  So that's just some of what we've got.
[00:07:38.595 --> 00:07:41.277]  Also, jail time for the Zapruder film.
[00:07:41.277 --> 00:07:49.240]  If you shot that film today and showed it like we did of Kennedy being killed, why you'd go to jail, according to the censors.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.101]  Trying to censor the video of the massacre.
[00:07:51.101 --> 00:07:51.922]  Why are they doing that?
[00:07:51.922 --> 00:07:53.742]  Because it's all about censorship.
[00:07:53.742 --> 00:07:54.443]  Speaking of censorship,
[00:07:55.393 --> 00:08:13.045]  We had a special report we shot live Sunday about the convicted child rapist leading story time for kids under Houston City funding and YouTube said that that is not allowed and took down a fan channel that we were working with.
[00:08:14.252 --> 00:08:17.194]  The Resistance News that had tens of millions of views.
[00:08:17.194 --> 00:08:19.495]  And so, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:19.495 --> 00:08:22.556]  Pedo Library Predators get their due.
[00:08:22.556 --> 00:08:23.457]  That's not allowed.
[00:08:23.457 --> 00:08:23.997]  I'm telling you.
[00:08:23.997 --> 00:08:24.938]  Rob knew it was his Sunday.
[00:08:24.938 --> 00:08:35.903]  He said, he said, he said, if our fan channels post this pedo report, these channels will be taken down.
[00:08:35.903 --> 00:08:37.544]  I said, I know.
[00:08:37.544 --> 00:08:38.045]  But I said,
[00:08:40.114 --> 00:08:42.356]  Let's go ahead and call the administrators of the fan channels.
[00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:43.697]  One of them's here in Austin.
[00:08:43.697 --> 00:08:46.279]  That was the Resistance News.
[00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:47.540]  Been up a while.
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.282]  Couple years.
[00:08:49.282 --> 00:08:50.863]  And they agreed.
[00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:52.684]  They said, no, let's do what's right.
[00:08:52.684 --> 00:08:54.646]  But we knew.
[00:08:54.646 --> 00:08:55.226]  We knew.
[00:08:55.226 --> 00:09:00.231]  Like, you don't expose 200-pound men raping children.
[00:09:00.231 --> 00:09:04.134]  That is the religion, the sacrament of Google.
[00:09:05.427 --> 00:09:08.188]  I'm telling you, you don't touch the pedos.
[00:09:08.188 --> 00:09:14.089]  They are God.
[00:09:14.089 --> 00:09:17.290]  So, later in the broadcast, I'm going to go over all of it.
[00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:26.233]  I'm going to show you the YouTube channels of convicted killers with small children saying, we're about to do some obscene things.
[00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:29.614]  Bring your children close to the television set.
[00:09:29.614 --> 00:09:31.174]  And they talk about drugging children.
[00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:33.112]  And why not?
[00:09:33.112 --> 00:09:48.456]  The fellow on the video, before he went to prison, launched the kid club movement, back in the club kid movement, back in the 90s, that's all about sex with underage children.
[00:09:48.456 --> 00:09:51.837]  All about roofing, all about ketamine.
[00:09:51.837 --> 00:09:56.798]  We have the kids on TV talking about taking ketamine.
[00:09:56.798 --> 00:09:58.679]  It's all about the ketamine.
[00:10:01.107 --> 00:10:07.251]  So there you go, they're gonna march right into your schools, they're gonna march right into your churches, they're gonna march right in everywhere.
[00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:21.719]  In fact, Google, it's an article up on infowars.com, dailycaller.com, their employees complained about a Christian pro-marriage ad that was running, and so it was pulled!
[00:10:21.719 --> 00:10:28.263]  Because the disease of San Francisco, the disease of the left, is spreading through the bloodstream of the planet right now.
[00:10:29.369 --> 00:10:36.834]  And it's not gonna let you ever resist it, unless you actually totally resist it.
[00:10:36.834 --> 00:10:43.138]  They're all trying to bully everybody and teach you to submit right now.
[00:10:43.138 --> 00:10:44.699]  Amazing.
[00:10:44.699 --> 00:10:53.164]  So the only way to stand up for the children, the unborn, you name it, is to tell people about the local radio station you're listening to.
[00:10:54.645 --> 00:11:07.798]  And support those local stations and rebuild community local media that's just based in common sense and based in values that work and create healthy, happy civilizations.
[00:11:07.798 --> 00:11:14.205]  Not the unhappy, drugged out, mentally ill Silicon Valley system of the new royalty.
[00:11:16.158 --> 00:11:18.779]  And you tell folks about NewsWars.com.
[00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:20.999]  And you tell folks about Infowars.com.
[00:11:20.999 --> 00:11:22.280]  And you've been doing it.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.981]  And you tell people about, hey, you heard a lot of bad stuff about Alex Jones, why don't you go find out what he's actually saying?
[00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:29.481]  And they come and they find it.
[00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:33.242]  People go, wow, this is incredible.
[00:11:33.242 --> 00:11:38.443]  We're gonna show you them saying, we're here to corrupt your children.
[00:11:38.443 --> 00:11:40.984]  You cannot stop us, just like the Borg.
[00:11:40.984 --> 00:11:43.085]  We are here to assimilate you.
[00:11:43.085 --> 00:11:44.185]  Resistance is futile.
[00:11:45.964 --> 00:11:50.606]  You're gonna see grown men going, we are gonna get your kids.
[00:11:50.606 --> 00:11:52.346]  Your children are ours.
[00:11:52.346 --> 00:11:56.488]  And then trophying little boys on TV.
[00:11:56.488 --> 00:12:00.750]  I'm going, ha ha ha ha ha ha, they're ours now.
[00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:04.631]  They're rubbing it in your face.
[00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:07.312]  We're gonna dress up scarier than hit the clown.
[00:12:07.312 --> 00:12:12.294]  And then we're gonna come and we are going to run your child's life.
[00:12:12.294 --> 00:12:13.815]  We want your soul.
[00:12:19.397 --> 00:12:21.278]  Corrupt the child.
[00:12:21.278 --> 00:12:29.183]  Destroy them all.
[00:12:29.183 --> 00:12:33.105]  And they come to the city councils and they say, We are grooming your children!
[00:12:33.105 --> 00:12:34.746]  They are ours!
[00:12:34.746 --> 00:12:35.786]  And the parents go, Oh!
[00:12:35.786 --> 00:12:36.807]  And they're, Ha!
[00:12:36.807 --> 00:12:38.008]  Don't you run your mouth!
[00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.028]  They're mine!
[00:12:39.028 --> 00:12:41.250]  I'll get you and your little dog too!
[00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.691]  These things must be done delicately!
[00:12:49.378 --> 00:12:53.180]  Oh, and the... I got an email.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.162]  From the Huffington Post, breathlessly.
[00:12:57.162 --> 00:12:58.862]  There's a YouTube channel, is it yours?
[00:12:58.862 --> 00:12:59.743]  Which it wasn't.
[00:12:59.743 --> 00:13:02.304]  They got that one taken down too.
[00:13:02.304 --> 00:13:05.065]  You're saying it's a false flag, the shooting didn't happen.
[00:13:05.065 --> 00:13:07.086]  This is horrible.
[00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:08.286]  Uh, didn't say that in the video.
[00:13:08.286 --> 00:13:09.487]  Witch?
[00:13:09.487 --> 00:13:10.928]  You fabricate her?
[00:13:10.928 --> 00:13:14.109]  I want to challenge this witch to come on.
[00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:18.964]  I said the shooting happened.
[00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:23.526]  He says in the manifesto he's done it to trigger a giant war between different groups.
[00:13:23.526 --> 00:13:30.831]  When you stage something to trigger a larger event that's blamed on other groups, that's the definition of the oldest form of false flag.
[00:13:30.831 --> 00:13:34.773]  I was reporting on Rush Limbaugh saying that.
[00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:39.215]  Hell, Obama's head professor at Harvard, I never played the clip yesterday, I will later.
[00:13:39.215 --> 00:13:40.636]  I'm going to play it this hour.
[00:13:40.636 --> 00:13:45.139]  He came out and said he thinks Trump will stage a crisis or event to stay in office.
[00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:52.806]  By the way, I don't agree that Trump's going to try that, but governments have done that, so it's very reasonable to look at any event and say that.
[00:13:58.766 --> 00:14:10.369]  By the way, the Huffington Post holds out the idea that I'm banned from the public square, from city council, from anybody else's YouTube show, all because they falsely took down our channel with three fake strikes.
[00:14:10.369 --> 00:14:18.312]  They've now created the perceived notion that no one can have our content on YouTube, and then they execute according to that idea.
[00:14:18.312 --> 00:14:22.533]  Fraud based on fraud based on lies.
[00:14:22.533 --> 00:14:26.074]  And what was it that got it taken down?
[00:14:28.442 --> 00:14:34.025]  They tell us here, we've got the Google, YouTube emails, I'll show you later.
[00:14:34.025 --> 00:14:36.606]  Why you talk bad about the drag queens?
[00:14:36.606 --> 00:14:38.107]  Yeah, the convicted one?
[00:14:38.107 --> 00:14:40.988]  Of child rape?
[00:14:40.988 --> 00:14:45.410]  I'm sorry, I tried to keep your priest from his quarry.
[00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.131]  From his sacrament.
[00:14:46.131 --> 00:14:51.873]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:14:51.873 --> 00:14:53.234]  I did do it.
[00:14:53.234 --> 00:14:55.075]  And I played Laressa Limbaugh saying,
[00:14:56.397 --> 00:15:01.300]  This guy says he wants to cause a civil war, he says he's a leftist, and he goes out and does this.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.601]  Is this a false flag?
[00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:04.682]  That's a normal question to ask.
[00:15:04.682 --> 00:15:11.566]  But you don't want normal questions to be asked, and you want to silence everything while you tell Congress that nothing's being silenced.
[00:15:11.566 --> 00:15:13.488]  Incredible liars.
[00:15:13.488 --> 00:15:16.550]  But it doesn't matter, dirtbags.
[00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:20.172]  Because Infowars.com and Newswars.com is still there.
[00:15:21.582 --> 00:15:26.527]  And we're going to do our longest emergency transmission this Thursday 8 a.m.
[00:15:26.527 --> 00:15:28.309]  until Saturday 10 a.m.
[00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:43.506]  An emergency summit on the censorship globally and how to counter it to develop with top guest experts calls everybody a plan to put forward a manifesto, a blueprint of resistance to the censorship.
[00:15:45.282 --> 00:15:47.684]  Will it mean our own Yellow Vest movement here?
[00:15:47.684 --> 00:15:53.910]  But not going after the government, but legally, lawfully, and camping outside Google, Facebook, and Twitter?
[00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.252]  We're gonna develop the plan!
[00:15:55.252 --> 00:15:57.354]  It all launches this Thursday morning!
[00:15:59.512 --> 00:16:00.772]  Maybe not today.
[00:16:00.772 --> 00:16:02.073]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[00:16:02.073 --> 00:16:05.794]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[00:16:05.794 --> 00:16:06.894]  Forget bunkers.
[00:16:06.894 --> 00:16:08.715]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[00:16:08.715 --> 00:16:10.415]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:31.367]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:16:31.367 --> 00:16:36.671]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:16:36.671 --> 00:16:38.253]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:16:38.253 --> 00:16:46.619]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:17:00.966 --> 00:17:03.146]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:17:28.419 --> 00:17:34.784]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:34.784 --> 00:17:37.827]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:37.827 --> 00:17:43.751]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:43.751 --> 00:17:47.534]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:48.795]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:48.795 --> 00:17:50.157]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.157 --> 00:17:56.342]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.342 --> 00:17:57.783]  Available at Amazon Books.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.741]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.741 --> 00:18:05.522]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.522 --> 00:18:17.567]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.567 --> 00:18:26.310]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:32.534]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.534 --> 00:18:37.818]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.818 --> 00:18:40.440]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.141]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.141 --> 00:18:52.148]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.148 --> 00:18:54.270]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:59.500]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[00:20:03.251 --> 00:20:12.398]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:12.398 --> 00:20:13.659]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:13.659 --> 00:20:14.539]  I'm your host.
[00:20:14.539 --> 00:20:19.923]  And I've been fighting the Gloveless for almost 25 years.
[00:20:31.036 --> 00:20:35.298]  And people ask, how have we done so many innovative things?
[00:20:35.298 --> 00:20:36.938]  Well, we've got a great audience that takes action.
[00:20:36.938 --> 00:20:37.919]  That's number one.
[00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:44.742]  But number two, when you fight the globalists, you learn what they're scared of, and you learn what they protect.
[00:20:44.742 --> 00:20:47.703]  You know, you learn what somebody loves.
[00:20:47.703 --> 00:20:57.527]  If you start going through their house and smashing stuff and they're not getting upset, and you finally get to that one piece of art on the wall, or that one vase, maybe grandma's ashes, and you smash that on the ground and they get angry?
[00:20:58.643 --> 00:21:00.404]  You found who they love.
[00:21:00.404 --> 00:21:14.431]  You criticize big old fat convicted pedophiles having their way with your children and they flip their you-know-what.
[00:21:14.431 --> 00:21:21.154]  And we're dealing with a big old juicy pack of pot-bellied pedophiles.
[00:21:21.154 --> 00:21:25.056]  And as soon as everybody figures that out, we can start fixing stuff around here.
[00:21:26.195 --> 00:21:30.539]  Google is a bunch of devil-worshipping pedophiles.
[00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:31.940]  Period.
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.162]  They're spying on everything you do.
[00:21:34.162 --> 00:21:35.823]  They're selling all your data.
[00:21:35.823 --> 00:21:37.225]  They lie to Congress.
[00:21:37.225 --> 00:21:38.946]  They do whatever the hell they want.
[00:21:38.946 --> 00:21:43.390]  And you ask, why are they so bad?
[00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:51.197]  Who would set up giant surveillance systems and then lie for 15, 16, 17, 18... I guess they've been around 20-something years now.
[00:21:54.451 --> 00:21:55.812]  That's what Silicon Valley does.
[00:21:55.812 --> 00:22:02.335]  Its whole system is based on spying, and sharing your data, and gaming the system, and screwing you over.
[00:22:02.335 --> 00:22:15.681]  And then they sit there and go, we're not, we never game anything, we never fix results, we never spy on anybody, jeepers creepers.
[00:22:15.681 --> 00:22:18.202]  And then you wonder why they're abusing their power.
[00:22:18.202 --> 00:22:20.283]  They built this city.
[00:22:23.294 --> 00:22:26.016]  Not for rock and roll.
[00:22:26.016 --> 00:22:27.997]  Not to go to the stars.
[00:22:27.997 --> 00:22:31.720]  We built this city to rape your kids.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.122]  We built this city to control your life.
[00:22:35.122 --> 00:22:41.267]  We built this city to do it creepily where you don't know we're doing it because we're a bunch of cowards like pedophiles.
[00:22:41.267 --> 00:22:42.608]  They're creepy.
[00:22:42.608 --> 00:22:44.029]  They're in disguises.
[00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:45.109]  They're hiding.
[00:22:45.109 --> 00:22:46.531]  They're administrators.
[00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:48.652]  They can dial into all your appliances.
[00:22:48.652 --> 00:22:50.213]  They can dial into your TV.
[00:22:50.213 --> 00:22:52.575]  They do whatever they want.
[00:22:55.583 --> 00:23:04.807]  And Congress sits there like a bunch of lobotomized possums.
[00:23:04.807 --> 00:23:07.949]  A bunch of jellyfish.
[00:23:07.949 --> 00:23:11.490]  And just, it sounds like Green Acres.
[00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:16.813]  Well, gee, I don't know how that, you tell me you don't ever know no nothing.
[00:23:17.583 --> 00:23:21.865]  And Clapper gets up before, we've never spied on anyone in the U.S.
[00:23:21.865 --> 00:23:26.926]  The NSA, by the way, for at least 20 years, every phone call, every email was being recorded.
[00:23:26.926 --> 00:23:27.366]  On record.
[00:23:27.366 --> 00:23:32.348]  It's in the Telecommunications Act of 96.
[00:23:32.348 --> 00:23:33.689]  Codified it in law.
[00:23:33.689 --> 00:23:36.870]  He's just like, we've never spied on one person.
[00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:43.412]  That's like saying, Abraham Lincoln did not have a beard.
[00:23:44.133 --> 00:23:46.234]  The sun is not yellow!
[00:23:46.234 --> 00:23:49.074]  They're just practicing lying to you!
[00:23:49.074 --> 00:24:05.259]  But when you get around their precious, and that's grotesque, fat, ugly men, that's the religion, the ugliest, stinking, fat pedo you can get, wallowing with your kids sitting in their lap, being prepared, that's their religion!
[00:24:05.259 --> 00:24:10.761]  Disgustingness, ugliness, something beautiful, being defiled, that's Satanism!
[00:24:12.418 --> 00:24:18.620]  You're having Satanism practiced right out in front of you.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:24.521]  And they think there's nothing you're gonna do about it.
[00:24:24.521 --> 00:24:26.842]  It's a spirit.
[00:24:26.842 --> 00:24:30.622]  It's an operating system.
[00:24:30.622 --> 00:24:36.384]  And it's men framing women for pedophilic activity dressed up like women.
[00:24:36.384 --> 00:24:39.145]  How sick is that?
[00:24:39.145 --> 00:24:40.625]  How evil is that?
[00:24:41.889 --> 00:24:51.374]  And it's all the same spirit of life.
[00:24:51.374 --> 00:24:54.956]  But then in the real world, it's vicious and it's horrible.
[00:24:54.956 --> 00:24:55.796]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:24:55.796 --> 00:24:56.217]  We come back.
[00:24:56.217 --> 00:24:58.958]  I've got Paul Watson's incredible report.
[00:24:58.958 --> 00:25:04.801]  And then we're going to have Millie Weaver on the last segment of this hour into the next hour.
[00:25:04.801 --> 00:25:07.943]  She went and got again out of the park footage of Beto O'Rourke.
[00:25:11.249 --> 00:25:13.911]  Saying he supports partial birth abortion.
[00:25:13.911 --> 00:25:17.833]  And the crowd, woo!
[00:25:17.833 --> 00:25:20.135]  I mean, look at the fake power trip.
[00:25:20.135 --> 00:25:24.898]  He's perfectly narcissistic, perfectly empty, ugly.
[00:25:24.898 --> 00:25:27.539]  Looks like somebody who would run a funeral home.
[00:25:27.539 --> 00:25:31.422]  You know, like the undertaker's assistant.
[00:25:31.422 --> 00:25:35.204]  I mean, you certainly wouldn't stay in a bed and breakfast if the proprietor looked like that.
[00:25:35.204 --> 00:25:36.205]  You'd say, man, that's a vampire.
[00:25:38.567 --> 00:25:43.109]  He talks like this, like Bernie Sanders.
[00:25:43.109 --> 00:25:44.730]  I'm a common sense guy.
[00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.571]  I roll up my sleeves.
[00:25:46.571 --> 00:25:49.993]  Look at the cover of Texas Monthly and Esquire and everything else.
[00:25:49.993 --> 00:25:51.674]  He's out in the desert.
[00:25:51.674 --> 00:25:54.436]  He's coming out of the desert like a messiah.
[00:25:54.436 --> 00:25:57.277]  I already said it's a messiah complex, Bernie.
[00:25:57.277 --> 00:25:59.879]  He goes, I was born to run.
[00:25:59.879 --> 00:26:02.240]  I'm going to run everything now.
[00:26:06.756 --> 00:26:11.838]  I'm the last great hope on Earth when I'm not hit-and-run driving.
[00:26:11.838 --> 00:26:20.281]  I mean, this guy is a complete joke.
[00:26:20.281 --> 00:26:23.203]  We're gonna get to that coming up.
[00:26:23.203 --> 00:26:24.143]  And then all the rest of it.
[00:26:26.223 --> 00:26:29.944]  But just make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, I've been down the rabbit hole.
[00:26:29.944 --> 00:26:36.806]  I used to have top generals and retired FBI agents say they're devil-worshipping pedophiles running it all.
[00:26:36.806 --> 00:26:39.227]  And this is like 23, 24 years ago.
[00:26:39.227 --> 00:26:40.527]  I'm like, come on.
[00:26:40.527 --> 00:26:41.408]  Really?
[00:26:41.408 --> 00:26:42.008]  Absolutely.
[00:26:42.008 --> 00:26:42.948]  That's what it's all about.
[00:26:42.948 --> 00:26:44.589]  And Ted Gunderson and all of them.
[00:26:44.589 --> 00:26:47.049]  And it turns out it's all true.
[00:26:47.049 --> 00:26:49.690]  And I'm just thinking these old guys have gone crazy.
[00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:51.351]  No, they weren't crazy.
[00:26:51.351 --> 00:26:52.411]  They knew what they were talking about.
[00:26:54.468 --> 00:26:56.409]  Former head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[00:26:56.409 --> 00:26:58.611]  Former head of the FBI in Southern California.
[00:26:58.611 --> 00:26:59.711]  The list goes on and on.
[00:26:59.711 --> 00:27:04.575]  And they all told me the exact same stories.
[00:27:04.575 --> 00:27:09.938]  And then my uncle, who was down in Guatemala, saw similar things.
[00:27:09.938 --> 00:27:11.999]  He didn't tell me what.
[00:27:11.999 --> 00:27:13.460]  But it was bad.
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:19.004]  And it was kids.
[00:27:19.004 --> 00:27:20.585]  It's the real deal, folks.
[00:27:20.585 --> 00:27:22.086]  It's the real deal.
[00:27:23.422 --> 00:27:28.644]  And you try to talk about it, you cover local news, busting them, they take you off Google.
[00:27:28.644 --> 00:27:32.506]  Because you don't touch Google's God!
[00:27:32.506 --> 00:27:34.707]  Google is powered by pedophilia!
[00:27:34.707 --> 00:27:36.888]  Google is powered by devil worship!
[00:27:36.888 --> 00:27:39.790]  Google is powered by drugs and evil!
[00:27:41.325 --> 00:27:42.946]  That's who they are!
[00:27:42.946 --> 00:28:00.192]  And they watch you, and they watch your children in Lifetime, and they lick their lips, and they run society, and they're the technocrats, and they're in charge, and they believe that you are done, and that you are powerless.
[00:28:00.192 --> 00:28:07.875]  Now, we're going to go to break and come back to Paul Joseph Watson's report.
[00:28:07.875 --> 00:28:10.196]  Please do not forget we have store-wide free shipping.
[00:28:11.263 --> 00:28:16.744]  And we have all the supplements 50% off, and we have double Patriot points 10% off on your next order.
[00:28:16.744 --> 00:28:21.285]  For every dollar you spend, an additional 10 cents off.
[00:28:21.285 --> 00:28:27.446]  And double Patriot points on top of free shipping when you sign up for auto ship on the next order.
[00:28:27.446 --> 00:28:29.867]  That's an additional 20% off, so a lot of these are lost liters.
[00:28:29.867 --> 00:28:32.348]  But I want you to see how great Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is.
[00:28:32.348 --> 00:28:34.468]  I want you to see how great Turbo Force is.
[00:28:34.468 --> 00:28:37.589]  I want you to see how great X3 and X2's back in stock.
[00:28:37.589 --> 00:28:38.929]  How great it is the protein bars.
[00:28:40.726 --> 00:28:42.507]  Great five-star reviews.
[00:28:42.507 --> 00:28:50.952]  Those are about to sell out in Sosterbo for us, so this is the last day of those being 50% off, but everything else will stay there until they get ready to sell out.
[00:28:50.952 --> 00:28:52.133]  But thank you all for your support.
[00:28:52.133 --> 00:28:52.813]  These are great products.
[00:28:52.813 --> 00:28:55.435]  At the same time, we're fighting pedophilia.
[00:28:55.435 --> 00:28:58.517]  When you purchase these products, you're fighting hardcore pedophile rings.
[00:28:59.295 --> 00:29:04.276]  Number one international best-selling author, Matthew David Hurtado's pain was simple.
[00:29:04.276 --> 00:29:12.478]  Lyme disease bankrupt him in 2009, watching bankers take everything from his family after building a seven-figure business from his couch.
[00:29:12.478 --> 00:29:18.420]  God called him to ministry to teach prosperity based on pain he could not tolerate in others' lives.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.482]  IRS, creditors, car loans, debt.
[00:29:21.482 --> 00:29:26.285]  It's the Babylonian system and you have to escape it before it's too late.

[00:30:00.373 --> 00:30:02.734]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:09.337]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[00:31:00.069 --> 00:31:10.658]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:31:10.658 --> 00:31:12.719]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:31:12.719 --> 00:31:15.602]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:31:15.602 --> 00:31:17.083]  It's made in the USA.
[00:31:17.083 --> 00:31:23.928]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:31:23.928 --> 00:31:25.149]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:35.697]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:31:35.697 --> 00:31:52.509]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:55.671]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:31:55.811 --> 00:31:58.152]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield.
[00:31:58.152 --> 00:31:59.893]  Infowarslive.com.
[00:31:59.893 --> 00:32:05.097]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[00:32:05.097 --> 00:32:13.682]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:32:13.682 --> 00:32:16.643]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:32:16.643 --> 00:32:18.384]  How can I solve that problem?
[00:32:18.384 --> 00:32:23.467]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now
[00:32:25.008 --> 00:32:32.073]  $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology.
[00:32:32.073 --> 00:32:35.035]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[00:32:35.035 --> 00:32:38.977]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[00:32:38.977 --> 00:32:42.940]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.761]  I've got two in my home.
[00:32:44.761 --> 00:32:50.865]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[00:32:50.865 --> 00:32:51.706]  Don't live
[00:32:52.526 --> 00:32:56.588]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[00:32:56.588 --> 00:33:03.251]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:33:03.251 --> 00:33:05.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:29.466 --> 00:33:31.987]  I pulled the shortest straw.
[00:33:31.987 --> 00:33:34.768]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:34.768 --> 00:33:35.568]  Glad I pulled it!
[00:33:35.568 --> 00:33:38.809]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.809 --> 00:33:41.629]  I get to carry out the mission.
[00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:45.471]  And if you choose to take on the globalists, you choose to pull the shortest straw.
[00:33:45.471 --> 00:33:48.972]  Pull it!
[00:33:48.972 --> 00:33:51.352]  Not a curse to pull the short straw.
[00:33:51.352 --> 00:33:52.693]  You want to pull the short straw.
[00:33:52.693 --> 00:33:57.354]  Alright, let's get right into it.
[00:34:00.748 --> 00:34:01.548]  Good news.
[00:34:01.548 --> 00:34:04.830]  You know, people criticize Laura Loomer because they're jealous of her.
[00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.211]  All she does is take action.
[00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:09.372]  All she does is develop victory.
[00:34:09.372 --> 00:34:15.475]  And she helped create the Stop the Bias movement that trends number one on Twitter routinely, even though she's been banned from Twitter.
[00:34:15.475 --> 00:34:20.838]  He says, I'll be looking into this.
[00:34:20.838 --> 00:34:24.460]  And she's going to be on during our 50 hour emergency.
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.320]  Stop the bias.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:28.341]  Stop this big tech censorship event.
[00:34:28.341 --> 00:34:29.462]  That's actually what we're calling it.
[00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:38.674]  Stop Big Tech Censorship, 50 hour broadcast, kicks off this Thursday 8am.
[00:34:38.674 --> 00:34:42.376]  We're going to have all the experts on to develop a battle plan.
[00:34:42.376 --> 00:34:57.044]  And I know what the battle plan is going to be, not just lobbying Congress, not just going to Congress, not just writing reports exposing it, but suing, but suing right for the racketeering, the collusion, the lying to Congress, the perjury, the violations of terms of service, but it goes further.
[00:34:59.602 --> 00:35:08.210]  The racketeering and the stealing of data and the employees that admit they've stolen our data and all the Project Veritas videos and others.
[00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:11.433]  And then it's going to be infiltrating Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[00:35:11.433 --> 00:35:14.215]  We already have infiltrators.
[00:35:14.215 --> 00:35:15.917]  Oh, that door swings both ways.
[00:35:15.917 --> 00:35:23.543]  And then a few other little tricks up our sleeves, which, of course, Google and others will then stage false flags against themselves.
[00:35:24.884 --> 00:35:26.726]  So that it makes it look bad to protest them.
[00:35:26.726 --> 00:35:27.907]  I don't care, we're going to do it.
[00:35:27.907 --> 00:35:30.088]  Google, we're coming to protest you.
[00:35:30.088 --> 00:35:32.851]  Facebook, Twitter, we're coming.
[00:35:32.851 --> 00:35:34.892]  You want to fight?
[00:35:34.892 --> 00:35:39.376]  In the information war, you better believe you got one, my pretties.
[00:35:39.376 --> 00:35:45.441]  Now I'm running behind, so let's, Millie's cool to do this, because I want to spend at least 30 minutes with her.
[00:35:45.441 --> 00:35:48.624]  We're going to get to Beto O'Rourke and his love of partial birth abortion.
[00:35:48.624 --> 00:35:53.508]  Now that ties into the sickening evil governor of Virginia that admits they kill babies after they're born.
[00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:56.871]  All about targeting the unborn and the born.
[00:35:56.871 --> 00:36:00.693]  All about your children, the energy of the children.
[00:36:00.693 --> 00:36:03.234]  That's the first 30 minutes of the next hour.
[00:36:03.234 --> 00:36:13.079]  And I was just talking to Robert Barnes, and I meant to ask him to come on and talk about Nunez and his lawsuit, $250 million against Twitter for the collusion.
[00:36:13.079 --> 00:36:16.581]  But the New York Times says, oh, Section 230, they're immune.
[00:36:16.581 --> 00:36:17.201]  No!
[00:36:17.201 --> 00:36:23.104]  Twitter and all them now and Google say they are publishers and are controlling content.
[00:36:24.403 --> 00:36:24.904]  Show!
[00:36:24.904 --> 00:36:27.426]  Strip them of 230!
[00:36:27.426 --> 00:36:32.391]  And Trump, in his new NAFTA renegotiation, gives them more power under 230.
[00:36:32.391 --> 00:36:42.640]  But don't worry, it hasn't gone through Congress yet, and we're going to work like busy beavers, busy little beavies, to get rid of Section 230.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.082]  Of course, we don't really want to get rid of it.
[00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:49.647]  But it'll force big tech to stop their evil, satanic rampage.
[00:36:49.647 --> 00:36:55.792]  Sorry, it does mean when pedophiles get busted in schools with kids, that it'll come out.
[00:36:55.792 --> 00:36:59.896]  I know that really upsets Google.
[00:36:59.896 --> 00:37:01.157]  Makes them cry all night long.
[00:37:05.725 --> 00:37:07.546]  Now, I'm going to get to Paul's report next segment.
[00:37:07.546 --> 00:37:24.098]  I want to play a clip I talked about yesterday, but I didn't get to, of Obama's professor, his head professor at Harvard, and he said Trump may stage a crisis to stay in power.
[00:37:24.098 --> 00:37:25.719]  Now, that's a reasonable thing to say.
[00:37:25.719 --> 00:37:30.483]  I'm not saying Trump's bad, I'm not saying Trump's going to do that, but this is what happens in governments.
[00:37:30.483 --> 00:37:34.706]  And so, so the fact that that type of stuff goes on,
[00:37:38.331 --> 00:37:44.935]  is a reality so it's reasonable to discuss it.
[00:37:44.935 --> 00:37:47.196]  That's Professor Tribe.
[00:37:47.196 --> 00:37:48.497]  So we'll play that clip.
[00:37:48.497 --> 00:37:50.498]  Here it is.
[00:37:50.498 --> 00:37:57.503]  Elections happen every four years but sometimes some leader is much too dangerous to leave in power.
[00:37:57.503 --> 00:37:59.744]  This may be such a case.
[00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:00.525]  The fact is that
[00:38:01.897 --> 00:38:11.049]  By 2020, the amount of damage that will have been done to our rule of law, to constitutional norms, is very great.
[00:38:11.049 --> 00:38:15.555]  And we can't count on his being voted out of office in 2020.
[00:38:15.555 --> 00:38:18.799]  He is sufficiently corrupt and will probably have enough help
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.422]  From not-too-friendly foreign powers.
[00:38:22.422 --> 00:38:26.264]  Russia, Saudi Arabia, maybe Turkey.
[00:38:26.264 --> 00:38:31.086]  So that we can't count on removing this guy by an election.
[00:38:31.086 --> 00:38:38.190]  And in fact, he may fabricate yet another so-called national emergency to influence that election.
[00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:42.833]  Now documents came out that Obama was actually looking at causing martial law and race riots.
[00:38:42.833 --> 00:38:43.993]  We broke the documents.
[00:38:43.993 --> 00:38:46.255]  They admitted they were real, but they want us off air.
[00:38:46.255 --> 00:38:48.456]  It's stuff like that.
[00:38:49.275 --> 00:38:51.716]  That they can't control.
[00:38:51.716 --> 00:38:58.678]  So I'm not saying Trump's going to do that, and I disagree with this professor that Trump should be removed under the 25th Amendment.
[00:38:58.678 --> 00:39:00.579]  We told you two years ago they'd try that.
[00:39:00.579 --> 00:39:06.101]  The point is, is that saying things like that is part of the political historical discourse.
[00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:10.523]  So when I say it, the media all freaks out and says I'm insane, I'm a kook, I'm nuts.
[00:39:11.513 --> 00:39:16.175]  But he's basically saying Trump may stage a false flag to stay in power.
[00:39:16.175 --> 00:39:23.098]  Limbaugh came out and said, this guy says he's a leftist, you know, that hates America and all this stuff and loves the chi-coms.
[00:39:23.098 --> 00:39:26.279]  A lot of folks are saying he staged it to get a big crisis going.
[00:39:26.279 --> 00:39:27.560]  It's a false flag.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.801]  The dude said that.
[00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:32.062]  It isn't, the scumbag said that.
[00:39:32.062 --> 00:39:37.344]  It isn't the type of false flag where he didn't kill the people.
[00:39:38.393 --> 00:39:39.434]  That's a different type of false flag.
[00:39:39.434 --> 00:39:43.196]  It's the false flag where you do it to blame someone you don't like.
[00:39:43.196 --> 00:39:44.217]  This is a fact.
[00:39:44.217 --> 00:39:48.819]  So, why can the left say it, but we can't say it?
[00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:52.302]  The truth is, their whole Russiagate's been proven to be a fraud.
[00:39:52.302 --> 00:39:55.103]  Now they've moved it on to other, quote, forms of corruption.
[00:39:55.103 --> 00:39:56.164]  That's all a fraud.
[00:39:56.164 --> 00:39:59.526]  When they're the globalists, they're the ones getting rid of national sovereignty.
[00:39:59.526 --> 00:40:02.308]  They're the ones that believe nation states shouldn't exist.
[00:40:02.308 --> 00:40:05.250]  They're the ones that say having a country's bad.
[00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.231]  But then, oh, Trump's this foreigner.
[00:40:08.994 --> 00:40:12.139]  Trump's in league with Erdogan.
[00:40:12.139 --> 00:40:14.562]  He's in league with Putin.
[00:40:14.562 --> 00:40:19.950]  Trump is less popular in Russia, in Russian polls, than Obama.
[00:40:21.472 --> 00:40:36.140]  And one of the things Trump's done that is wrong is he's let all this neocon and leftist lies about Russia have him put heavy weapons on their border, nuclear weapons, billions of dollars that he's stabilized inside Russia, real meddling in Russia!
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:40.443]  And Russia's becoming a Christian, free-market nation that wants to work with us.
[00:40:40.443 --> 00:40:41.843]  Does that mean I'm a Russophile?
[00:40:41.843 --> 00:40:42.504]  Never been to Russia.
[00:40:44.414 --> 00:40:45.615]  But I've studied it.
[00:40:45.615 --> 00:40:53.542]  And so Trump has been moved towards one of the most aggressive anti-Russian stances in real politics.
[00:40:53.542 --> 00:40:54.643]  Not in his rhetoric.
[00:40:54.643 --> 00:40:55.985]  Oh, I love Russia.
[00:40:55.985 --> 00:40:57.766]  I'm your friend, Russia.
[00:40:57.766 --> 00:41:03.231]  All of that, the Russians have figured out, is absolute BS.
[00:41:03.231 --> 00:41:10.038]  Trump is kicking the ribs in of Russia on energy and weapons and encirclement to bankrupt Russia.
[00:41:11.138 --> 00:41:14.700]  So the oligarchs can come back in and kick the Christians around.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:19.702]  Trump's doing the wrong thing on that front.
[00:41:19.702 --> 00:41:21.383]  And it's very, very sad.
[00:41:21.383 --> 00:41:23.844]  He's doing good things on many other fronts.
[00:41:23.844 --> 00:41:29.206]  And you notice, getting upset with Trump, he's suddenly saying, OK, I may take action.
[00:41:29.206 --> 00:41:32.228]  I may take action and try to stop the censorship.
[00:41:32.228 --> 00:41:32.768]  Well, you better!
[00:41:34.246 --> 00:41:35.447]  You served the Republic.
[00:41:35.447 --> 00:41:37.128]  And look, I love Trump.
[00:41:37.128 --> 00:41:38.229]  I love a lot of what he's done.
[00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:39.050]  I think he's a good guy.
[00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:44.954]  But he's encircled by a bunch of insiders who think they're going to make deals with the establishment.
[00:41:44.954 --> 00:41:47.035]  The establishment doesn't like you.
[00:41:47.035 --> 00:41:51.719]  You didn't come from the establishment.
[00:41:51.719 --> 00:41:55.041]  Trump is not the establishment.
[00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:56.942]  Kushner's dad was not the establishment.
[00:41:56.942 --> 00:42:00.005]  He got sent to prison.
[00:42:00.005 --> 00:42:01.526]  Ivanka Trump's not the establishment.
[00:42:02.827 --> 00:42:04.747]  You guys are trying to work with the establishment.
[00:42:04.747 --> 00:42:07.428]  You didn't go through the butt-sniffing at Harvard.
[00:42:07.428 --> 00:42:09.468]  You didn't go through all the candy-ashing.
[00:42:09.468 --> 00:42:12.289]  You've not been part of their system.
[00:42:12.289 --> 00:42:13.769]  Trump is self-made.
[00:42:13.769 --> 00:42:15.090]  He's his own maverick.
[00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.910]  They don't like mavericks.
[00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:23.611]  They want to mount your hide to the wall and sit around drinking cocktails.
[00:42:23.611 --> 00:42:25.052]  Okay?
[00:42:25.052 --> 00:42:27.012]  They want to mount my head on the wall.
[00:42:27.012 --> 00:42:31.253]  This is what you call the needle weenie spirit.
[00:42:33.308 --> 00:42:35.089]  The needle weenies, you know, they want your kids.
[00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:37.551]  They can't have relationships with adults, they want your kids.
[00:42:37.551 --> 00:42:41.014]  It's a culture of the chicken you-know-what dimension.
[00:42:41.014 --> 00:42:44.716]  The chicken SH-T dimension.
[00:42:44.716 --> 00:42:49.600]  Always put on the chicken you-know-what goggles, and then you can see like a globalist.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.401]  You gotta put them on first!
[00:42:51.401 --> 00:42:57.706]  And boy, once you put them on, then you figure out what a bunch of sacks of filthy, frickin' garbage these people are!
[00:42:59.298 --> 00:43:03.241]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:43:03.241 --> 00:43:06.544]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:43:06.544 --> 00:43:12.809]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:43:12.809 --> 00:43:15.592]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:43:16.312 --> 00:43:20.138]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:43:20.138 --> 00:43:26.608]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:43:26.608 --> 00:43:31.575]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:43:32.324 --> 00:43:36.247]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:43:36.247 --> 00:43:43.433]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:43:43.433 --> 00:43:48.678]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:43:48.678 --> 00:43:54.362]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:43:54.362 --> 00:43:58.326]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:43:59.443 --> 00:44:05.472]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall so you'd have it during the winter.
[00:44:05.472 --> 00:44:08.396]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[00:44:08.396 --> 00:44:12.963]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply, one of the top

[00:46:00.066 --> 00:46:07.889]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[00:46:07.889 --> 00:46:11.211]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[00:46:11.211 --> 00:46:14.312]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[00:46:14.312 --> 00:46:15.873]  I didn't invent all this.
[00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:22.436]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[00:46:22.436 --> 00:46:25.217]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been.
[00:46:26.294 --> 00:46:29.635]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[00:46:29.635 --> 00:46:34.257]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[00:46:34.257 --> 00:46:47.801]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[00:46:47.801 --> 00:46:49.742]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[00:46:50.382 --> 00:46:55.650]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[00:46:55.650 --> 00:47:02.761]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[00:47:02.761 --> 00:47:05.405]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.952 --> 00:47:28.015]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:28.015 --> 00:47:32.318]  All right, I want to give you this powerful Paul Watson report.
[00:47:32.318 --> 00:47:44.404]  Den Millie Weaver's joining us with the exclusive video of Beto endorsing third trimester partial birth abortion and being cheered by the bloodthirsty, filthy Betoites.
[00:47:44.404 --> 00:47:45.465]  They're worse than pedophiles.
[00:47:45.465 --> 00:47:47.546]  They actually want to kill children.
[00:47:47.546 --> 00:47:48.807]  So they're Betoites.
[00:47:50.828 --> 00:47:52.789]  It's like that governor up in Virginia.
[00:47:52.789 --> 00:47:58.431]  We keep the little buggers alive to get their goodies.
[00:47:58.431 --> 00:48:01.072]  We just don't count them as alive.
[00:48:01.072 --> 00:48:03.633]  So that's all coming up.
[00:48:03.633 --> 00:48:12.837]  By the way, Joe Rogan is either going to be in studio Friday, or we're going to tape a podcast while he's here this weekend, so look for that.
[00:48:12.837 --> 00:48:14.758]  Oh, and I forgot, that article's on mfulwors.com.
[00:48:14.758 --> 00:48:15.958]  I didn't see that in my mfulwors tag.
[00:48:15.958 --> 00:48:16.659]  Will you guys print that for me?
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:24.122]  Paul Joseph Watson article, he's now a right-wing Nazi, and they want him taken off the air because the left's jealous.
[00:48:24.122 --> 00:48:25.503]  And I've told Joe this, man.
[00:48:25.503 --> 00:48:27.264]  You do have the number one podcast.
[00:48:27.264 --> 00:48:29.284]  His average podcast reaches 10 million.
[00:48:29.284 --> 00:48:32.866]  The one where I came on is over 35 million right now, and counting.
[00:48:32.866 --> 00:48:34.726]  He says it's probably the biggest ever.
[00:48:34.726 --> 00:48:35.807]  I talked to him a few days ago.
[00:48:35.807 --> 00:48:38.167]  He said it may be bigger than Elon Musk.
[00:48:38.167 --> 00:48:40.848]  That was definitely his biggest.
[00:48:40.848 --> 00:48:42.769]  And so how do they respond?
[00:48:42.769 --> 00:48:43.929]  Well, he's a Nazi.
[00:48:43.929 --> 00:48:45.090]  No, Joe's pretty liberal.
[00:48:46.374 --> 00:48:50.657]  I wouldn't call him leftist, but he is pro-gun and pro-hunting.
[00:48:50.657 --> 00:48:52.219]  So, there you go.
[00:48:52.219 --> 00:48:52.639]  There you go.
[00:48:52.639 --> 00:48:55.361]  We'll talk about that when he's in this weekend.
[00:48:55.361 --> 00:49:00.886]  He's got the sold-out comedy club gig going on in Austin, Cap City Comedy Club.
[00:49:00.886 --> 00:49:05.129]  YouTube terminates account, HuffPost, hosting Alex Jones Impo Wars.
[00:49:05.129 --> 00:49:07.411]  Of course, they don't tell you, but I have her email right here.
[00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:10.513]  She contacted him, Amy Russo, and said, what are you doing?
[00:49:10.513 --> 00:49:11.494]  He says, no one died.
[00:49:11.494 --> 00:49:12.675]  This is hurtful.
[00:49:12.675 --> 00:49:14.457]  Didn't say that, you dirty witch.
[00:49:15.595 --> 00:49:19.216]  And I'd have a right to say that if I wanted to.
[00:49:19.216 --> 00:49:23.836]  I said Rush Limbaugh says the guys are leftists that did it to blame conservatives.
[00:49:23.836 --> 00:49:25.957]  That's in the news.
[00:49:25.957 --> 00:49:30.418]  And so then they again show five-year-old videos have nothing to do with what I said.
[00:49:30.418 --> 00:49:34.238]  And then they tattle to YouTube and they take the channel down for that and exposing pedophilia.
[00:49:34.238 --> 00:49:39.819]  And it's a fan channel, but we were working with them.
[00:49:39.819 --> 00:49:43.600]  Had like, I don't want to exaggerate it, like 15 million views last six months or so.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:44.260]  So they got rid of it.
[00:49:45.333 --> 00:49:49.259]  And then they lie and say, Jones says no one died at Christchurch.
[00:49:49.259 --> 00:49:59.856]  No, I explained that World War II started in Operation Glywoods when the Nazis staged the attack on Poland on their own troops.
[00:49:59.856 --> 00:50:00.437]  That's all I said.
[00:50:03.228 --> 00:50:09.553]  I said the shooter says it's a false flag, and Limbaugh says it's a false flag, but learn what a false flag really is.
[00:50:09.553 --> 00:50:14.896]  Then I explained, the classic one is when you do something to get somebody else blamed.
[00:50:14.896 --> 00:50:16.938]  That's the classic one, is to frame somebody.
[00:50:16.938 --> 00:50:22.061]  It doesn't mean it didn't happen, but they always confuse that.
[00:50:22.061 --> 00:50:25.244]  But see, you can't see the videos because hundreds of them were taken down.
[00:50:25.244 --> 00:50:30.988]  You can't actually hear what I said, you just get to hear it from the Huffington Post, and then they don't quote or show you
[00:50:33.914 --> 00:50:41.039]  They don't show you any of what I said.
[00:50:41.039 --> 00:50:51.987]  They show clips of me from like five years ago, edited about Sandy Hook, and then say that means I'm saying this didn't happen.
[00:50:51.987 --> 00:50:55.790]  Amy Russo.
[00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:59.873]  I challenge Amy Russo to come on the air.
[00:50:59.873 --> 00:51:01.073]  Oh, and they also lie here.
[00:51:01.073 --> 00:51:01.434]  They say,
[00:51:03.877 --> 00:51:04.857]  Jones is banned.
[00:51:04.857 --> 00:51:07.098]  His content banned, period.
[00:51:07.098 --> 00:51:13.121]  No, they took down some of our channels with fake strikes, saying I beat a kid up.
[00:51:13.121 --> 00:51:14.401]  Wasn't true.
[00:51:14.401 --> 00:51:16.542]  All these lies.
[00:51:16.542 --> 00:51:19.543]  And then, they went further.
[00:51:19.543 --> 00:51:22.664]  Then the media would say, hey, wait!
[00:51:22.664 --> 00:51:24.005]  He was on local news!
[00:51:24.005 --> 00:51:24.965]  Take that down!
[00:51:24.965 --> 00:51:27.206]  No one's allowed to talk to him!
[00:51:27.206 --> 00:51:29.247]  Well, Charlie Manson could go on ABC News.
[00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:32.271]  They got Hitler on the Discovery Channel.
[00:51:32.271 --> 00:51:36.254]  They let you hear what Hitler said, but with me, you're not supposed to hear it.
[00:51:36.254 --> 00:51:39.676]  You're supposed to have them tell you.
[00:51:39.676 --> 00:51:45.980]  But it says Media Matters reported on it, on the channel, George Soros' group, and now it's been taken down.
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:54.226]  They say the channel had at least 12 million views on it, and 65,000 subscribers who aren't allowed to watch us.
[00:51:54.226 --> 00:51:58.969]  They're going to tell you at the Huffington Post, and George Soros is going to tell you what you're allowed to see.
[00:52:00.731 --> 00:52:15.300]  In a video uploaded Monday and viewed by Huffington Post before the account's deletion, Jones suggested the shooting at two mosques in which 50 people were killed were part of a stunt designed to stage something to blame somebody else or to get a desired political outcome.
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.201]  Yeah, that's what Rush Limbaugh said.
[00:52:17.201 --> 00:52:18.662]  It's a clip of Rush Limbaugh.
[00:52:20.546 --> 00:52:23.028]  If I wanted to say that no one died, it's my right to say it.
[00:52:23.028 --> 00:52:23.948]  Or they did.
[00:52:23.948 --> 00:52:28.751]  But, I mean, legitimately, the guy says in his manifesto, I want to cause a race war.
[00:52:28.751 --> 00:52:30.972]  And I'm like, are we going to give the guy what he wants?
[00:52:30.972 --> 00:52:34.915]  And mainstream corporate media is pushing that, so they don't want me to counter their narrative.
[00:52:34.915 --> 00:52:37.877]  They just want to take me down.
[00:52:37.877 --> 00:52:38.837]  I'll give them this, though.
[00:52:38.837 --> 00:52:41.519]  It's out of context, but at least they gave you a quote.
[00:52:41.519 --> 00:52:42.880]  Normally, there's not even a quote.
[00:52:52.321 --> 00:53:01.165]  And then it goes on, a caption below, the bought and paid for media are pushing an anti-white American narrative while ignoring the decimation of Christians globally at a record pace.
[00:53:01.165 --> 00:53:02.306]  All that's totally true.
[00:53:02.306 --> 00:53:08.149]  You turn on the news, it's like, whites are inherently evil, they're the devil, my god, genetically they're bad, we should exterminate them.
[00:53:09.107 --> 00:53:15.051]  The video, which was viewed more than 5,000 times, promoted blatant Islamophobia.
[00:53:15.051 --> 00:53:20.014]  I just was pointing out that thousands of churches blown up and that Islamic countries don't let Christians live in them.
[00:53:20.014 --> 00:53:28.619]  As Jones implied, Muslims celebrated Easter by committing acts of terrorism and he predicted violence would be seen this year's holiday.
[00:53:29.261 --> 00:53:45.129]  It's not disputed that from Europe to Asia to the Middle East to Africa on Easter and Palm Sunday and Christmas they've got to post guards and put up checkpoints and things to block vehicles because truck bombs get rolled in or people show up with AK-47s!
[00:53:45.129 --> 00:53:45.930]  Think about that.
[00:53:51.067 --> 00:53:55.029]  Jones said Muslims target Christians.
[00:53:55.029 --> 00:53:56.850]  Dun, dun, dun!
[00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:59.591]  Jones says 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:53:59.591 --> 00:54:07.075]  Jones says that swordfish live in the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:54:07.075 --> 00:54:11.737]  Jones said that canaries are sometimes yellow.
[00:54:11.737 --> 00:54:15.559]  Jones said his tongue is pink.
[00:54:15.559 --> 00:54:17.860]  Jones said the American flag is red, white, and blue.
[00:54:19.465 --> 00:54:21.586]  Jones said humans live off oxygen.
[00:54:21.586 --> 00:54:25.449]  Respirate on oxygen.
[00:54:25.449 --> 00:54:30.272]  Jones said he's wearing a green and silver watch.
[00:54:30.272 --> 00:54:31.473]  All of that is true.
[00:54:31.473 --> 00:54:33.734]  This is true.
[00:54:33.734 --> 00:54:40.218]  It says all the major media crack down on Jones, but still the scourge is there.
[00:54:40.218 --> 00:54:43.821]  Like I'm some foreign dictator, some country, or I'm Vietnam in 1969.
[00:54:43.821 --> 00:54:44.301]  It's 1969, President.
[00:54:52.267 --> 00:54:55.469]  Nixon has launched Operation Linebacker.
[00:54:55.469 --> 00:54:57.731]  B-52 carpet bombing to take out Alex Jones.
[00:54:57.731 --> 00:54:59.012]  It's like I'm Godzilla.
[00:54:59.012 --> 00:55:02.735]  The entire combined world armies are firing missiles at it, and we can't take it down.
[00:55:17.481 --> 00:55:30.599]  Jones said that Christians get targeted by Muslims in proportionation, in way more disproportionate level.
[00:55:30.599 --> 00:55:31.780]  Man, you read these articles.
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.462]  It's actually hilarious.
[00:55:33.462 --> 00:55:34.484]  I don't know what to say at this point.
[00:55:45.728 --> 00:55:47.609]  Oh, we're going to show some footage of Operation Linebacker?
[00:55:47.609 --> 00:55:54.233]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:55:54.233 --> 00:55:54.854]  I'm having some fun.
[00:55:54.854 --> 00:55:57.515]  We're going to come back with Millie Weaver and a lot more.
[00:55:57.515 --> 00:56:03.239]  And I have a clip of Trump with Barroso that just, not Barroso, Bolasanaro.
[00:56:05.253 --> 00:56:07.594]  Coming up, teleprompter free news.
[00:56:07.594 --> 00:56:15.599]  Please don't forget, the globalists are obsessed with shutting us down because we're reaching people at record levels that count.
[00:56:15.599 --> 00:56:19.581]  Thanks to you spreading the articles and the videos from InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:56:19.581 --> 00:56:21.902]  And everybody needs a water filtration system.
[00:56:21.902 --> 00:56:24.764]  We go out and get the very best, the best price, boom.
[00:56:24.764 --> 00:56:31.368]  Everybody needs the air filtration systems we've got that are about a third the price of comparable brands.
[00:56:31.368 --> 00:56:33.129]  Yeah, they just put giant markups on stuff.
[00:56:33.959 --> 00:56:34.820]  We don't do it.
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:39.283]  And all the supplements are 50% off, and store-wide free shipping, and double Patriot points.
[00:56:39.283 --> 00:56:40.924]  But, here's the bad news.
[00:56:40.924 --> 00:56:42.626]  I'm going to keep this sale running throughout the month.
[00:56:42.626 --> 00:56:43.206]  That's the good news.
[00:56:43.206 --> 00:56:49.611]  The bad news is, the protein bars, somebody didn't order enough of them, so it'll be a month or two until those come in.
[00:56:49.611 --> 00:56:51.713]  Very popular, super high quality.
[00:56:51.713 --> 00:56:54.795]  They're already half the price of, again, comparable brands.
[00:56:54.795 --> 00:56:58.538]  At this price, they're at a lost leader, so you get to see how great they are.
[00:56:58.538 --> 00:56:59.179]  Despite that,
[00:56:59.799 --> 00:57:01.840]  Uh, in fact, they're about to sell out.
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:07.483]  We still have a sale on, so we're gonna have to pull selectively some of the 50% off stuff.
[00:57:07.483 --> 00:57:11.765]  It's on the verge of selling out, and that means the TurboForce Beyond Energy Drink.
[00:57:11.765 --> 00:57:12.325]  Incredible.
[00:57:12.325 --> 00:57:13.066]  Best out there.
[00:57:13.066 --> 00:57:15.407]  Clean burning, long burning.
[00:57:15.407 --> 00:57:15.807]  Amazing.
[00:57:15.807 --> 00:57:16.507]  So good for you.
[00:57:16.507 --> 00:57:21.950]  Not just the nature's stimulants, but it's got the amino acids and so much more.
[00:57:23.604 --> 00:57:24.164]  We're good to go.

[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:28.645]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.645 --> 01:00:31.406]  Jair Bolsonaro's been meeting with Trump.
[01:00:31.406 --> 01:00:33.007]  We've got a clip of that for you, and then...
[01:00:34.687 --> 01:00:35.448]  Milly Weaver joins us.
[01:00:35.448 --> 01:00:37.210]  I never got to Paul Watson's report.
[01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:37.991]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:00:37.991 --> 01:00:39.452]  It's pretty powerful.
[01:00:39.452 --> 01:00:43.657]  But right now, let's go to the President of the United States with the President of Brazil.
[01:00:43.657 --> 01:00:44.358]  Two peas in a pod.
[01:00:48.551 --> 01:00:53.234]  Well, we're looking at it very strongly.
[01:00:53.234 --> 01:00:55.856]  We're very inclined to do that.
[01:00:55.856 --> 01:00:59.198]  The relationship that we have right now with Brazil has never been better.
[01:00:59.198 --> 01:01:01.940]  I think there was a lot of hostility with other presidents.
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:04.021]  There's zero hostility with me.
[01:01:04.021 --> 01:01:04.861]  And we will go.
[01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:07.083]  We're going to look at that very, very strongly in terms of
[01:01:08.424 --> 01:01:16.790]  Whether it's NATO or it's something having to do with alliance, but we have a great alliance with Brazil better than we've ever had before.
[01:01:17.998 --> 01:01:22.841]  The question is, would Brazil receive privileges, would it give privileges to the NATO for Brazil?
[01:01:22.841 --> 01:01:25.483]  And, in fact, we have an excellent relationship with Brazil.
[01:01:25.483 --> 01:01:26.844]  We are working with them.
[01:01:26.844 --> 01:01:29.326]  We have no hostility with Brazil, as happened before.
[01:01:29.326 --> 01:01:30.306]  Our hostility is zero.
[01:01:30.306 --> 01:01:32.568]  So let's work with this and other alliances.
[01:01:41.707 --> 01:01:50.089]  Mr. President, Brazil is working to offer the United States access to a rocket launch site in Brazil.
[01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:53.490]  Americans will be able to go to Brazil without a visa.
[01:01:53.490 --> 01:02:00.912]  What would you like President Bolsonaro to get to Brazil, to take to Brazil as a result of this visit?
[01:02:01.192 --> 01:02:04.814]  Well we have, we're working on different military sites and military options.
[01:02:04.814 --> 01:02:10.057]  We're working on visas and going in a much easier fashion.
[01:02:10.057 --> 01:02:11.018]  All of that is good.
[01:02:11.018 --> 01:02:12.579]  I agree with that.
[01:02:12.579 --> 01:02:14.420]  We need Brazilian women imported.
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:16.161]  I think we're working on those things.
[01:02:16.161 --> 01:02:19.443]  One of the big elements of the relationship is trade.
[01:02:19.443 --> 01:02:22.945]  Brazil makes great product and we make great product.
[01:02:22.945 --> 01:02:23.985]  And our trade has been
[01:02:25.726 --> 01:02:28.830]  Never as good as it should be in the past.
[01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:31.253]  And in some cases it should be far, far more.
[01:02:31.253 --> 01:02:35.798]  So I think our trade with Brazil will go substantially up in both directions.
[01:02:35.798 --> 01:02:38.000]  I'm trying to block trade with Brazil.
[01:02:41.344 --> 01:02:42.885]  Only China is laughing.
[01:02:42.885 --> 01:02:43.405]  That's right.
[01:02:57.874 --> 01:03:02.840]  Well, we're thinking about a lot of things, different military locations, different options.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.424]  We're also thinking about facilitating the visas.
[01:03:06.424 --> 01:03:08.746]  And a very important thing is trade.
[01:03:08.746 --> 01:03:12.530]  The trade we have with Brazil is not as good as it should be.
[01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:15.193]  And we have to work to make it as good as possible.
[01:03:17.976 --> 01:03:18.296]  Mr. President!
[01:03:18.296 --> 01:03:18.636]  Mr. President!
[01:03:18.636 --> 01:03:19.097]  Mr. President!

[01:03:21.358 --> 01:03:21.898]  Mr. President!
[01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:22.439]  Mr. President!
[01:03:22.439 --> 01:03:22.819]  Mr. President!
[01:03:22.819 --> 01:03:23.259]  Mr. President!
[01:03:23.259 --> 01:03:24.140]  Mr. President!
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:24.460]  Mr. President!
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:24.720]  Mr. President!
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.320]  Mr. President!
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:25.700]  Mr. President!
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:26.101]  Mr. President!
[01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:26.401]  Mr. President!
[01:03:26.401 --> 01:03:26.721]  Mr. President!
[01:03:26.721 --> 01:03:27.141]  Mr. President!
[01:03:27.141 --> 01:03:27.401]  Mr. President!
[01:03:27.401 --> 01:03:27.782]  Mr. President!
[01:03:27.782 --> 01:03:28.382]  Mr. President!
[01:03:28.382 --> 01:03:28.862]  Mr. President!
[01:03:28.862 --> 01:03:29.403]  Mr. President!
[01:03:29.403 --> 01:03:29.863]  Mr. President!
[01:03:29.863 --> 01:03:30.463]  Mr. President!
[01:03:30.463 --> 01:03:30.763]  Mr. President!
[01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:32.064]  Mr. President!
[01:03:32.064 --> 01:03:32.524]  Mr. President!
[01:03:32.524 --> 01:03:32.905]  Mr. President!
[01:03:32.905 --> 01:03:33.265]  Mr. President!
[01:03:33.265 --> 01:03:33.545]  Mr. President!
[01:03:33.545 --> 01:03:34.085]  Mr. President!
[01:03:34.085 --> 01:03:35.406]  Mr. President!
[01:03:35.406 --> 01:03:35.926]  Mr. President!
[01:03:35.926 --> 01:03:36.527]  Mr. President!
[01:03:36.527 --> 01:03:36.947]  Mr. President!
[01:03:36.947 --> 01:03:37.727]  Mr. President!
[01:03:37.727 --> 01:03:38.808]  Mr. President!
[01:03:38.808 --> 01:03:39.348]  Mr. President!
[01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:39.668]  Mr. President!
[01:03:39.668 --> 01:03:40.009]  Mr. President!
[01:03:40.009 --> 01:03:40.669]  Mr. President!
[01:03:40.669 --> 01:03:41.109]  Mr. President!
[01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.509]  Mr. President!
[01:03:41.509 --> 01:03:41.830]  Mr. President!
[01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:42.450]  Mr. President!
[01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:43.010]  Mr. President!
[01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:43.470]  Mr. President!
[01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:44.031]  Mr. President!
[01:03:44.031 --> 01:03:44.631]  Mr. President!
[01:03:44.631 --> 01:03:45.051]  Mr. President!
[01:03:45.051 --> 01:03:45.492]  Mr. President!
[01:03:45.492 --> 01:03:46.012]  Mr. President!
[01:03:47.513 --> 01:03:53.379]  All right, folks, we're going to go to break.
[01:03:53.379 --> 01:03:55.801]  Millie Weaver is going to be coming on with us.
[01:03:55.801 --> 01:04:01.466]  She has incredible footage of the pedo or, I'm sorry, he's worse than a pedophile.
[01:04:01.466 --> 01:04:07.572]  He likes killing viable babies, so the man that supports murdering children.
[01:04:08.453 --> 01:04:09.834]  She got us the footage.
[01:04:09.834 --> 01:04:12.977]  It's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:04:12.977 --> 01:04:15.939]  And remember, only you can get these videos out.
[01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:22.224]  Only you can share the articles so people know what a monstrous little pig creature, uh, Pito O'Rourke is.
[01:04:22.224 --> 01:04:35.935]  And just all the mindless, low IQ people that fawn and worship at this posing, preening, buck-toothed, uh, person that wants open borders and does all these weird voodoo rituals and
[01:04:36.696 --> 01:04:37.997]  Literally eats cat poop.
[01:04:37.997 --> 01:04:39.178]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:04:39.178 --> 01:04:42.279]  I mean, this guy is a hit-and-run monster.
[01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:44.561]  He writes articles about raping women.
[01:04:44.561 --> 01:04:45.821]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:04:45.821 --> 01:04:47.883]  He eats dirt off the street.
[01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:49.444]  I have the article right here.
[01:04:49.444 --> 01:04:51.585]  He's in all sorts of weirdness.
[01:04:51.585 --> 01:04:58.509]  Perfect buck-toothed demon.
[01:04:58.509 --> 01:05:01.591]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[01:05:01.591 --> 01:05:03.132]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[01:05:04.498 --> 01:05:07.463]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWars4.com.
[01:05:07.463 --> 01:05:12.030]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply on the top.
[01:05:13.092 --> 01:05:22.215]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:05:22.215 --> 01:05:27.577]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:05:27.577 --> 01:05:29.838]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:05:29.838 --> 01:05:33.360]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.840]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.822]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, and week emergency supplies.
[01:05:38.822 --> 01:05:40.842]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:05:40.842 --> 01:05:42.123]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:05:42.603 --> 01:05:44.585]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:05:44.585 --> 01:05:47.107]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:47.107 --> 01:05:52.111]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:52.111 --> 01:05:57.496]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:06:09.677 --> 01:06:15.602]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:15.602 --> 01:06:20.706]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:06:20.706 --> 01:06:21.487]  to 3 p.m.
[01:06:21.487 --> 01:06:22.788]  Central.
[01:06:22.788 --> 01:06:23.489]  We're here live.
[01:06:30.478 --> 01:06:54.561]  To the dread of the globalists, of the communists, of the pedophiles, of the AOCs, the big corporate chiefs, all the control freaks, they can't stand the fact that Americana and the fact that the love of free market and the love of God and country and family is still alive beating in our breasts, in our hearts, and in our minds.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:01.441]  It's harder than it looks to take down the spirit of 1776.
[01:07:01.441 --> 01:07:04.122]  Here's Mellie Weaver's report, and she'll join us live.
[01:07:04.122 --> 01:07:17.506]  She ran into the Lord and Savior, the Anointed One, born to run, the man from the wilderness, with his billionaire wife and his father-in-law worth $28 billion funding everything, but he's a man of the people.
[01:07:17.506 --> 01:07:19.806]  Why, he rolls up his sleeves.
[01:07:19.806 --> 01:07:22.527]  So here's the report on Beto.
[01:07:24.181 --> 01:07:25.201]  You're a pig!
[01:07:25.201 --> 01:07:25.981]  You're a pig!
[01:07:25.981 --> 01:07:27.702]  Because I don't want to have babies?
[01:07:27.702 --> 01:07:28.702]  Oh, you kill them!
[01:07:28.702 --> 01:07:32.803]  You let them live so they can starve to death!
[01:07:32.803 --> 01:07:34.884]  That's liberal mindset for you.
[01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:35.984]  Kill the babies.
[01:07:35.984 --> 01:07:38.704]  Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:07:38.704 --> 01:07:44.986]  We're here in Cleveland where 2020 presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke is scheduled to come speak.
[01:07:44.986 --> 01:07:49.127]  Beto O'Rourke has been pretty hush about which policies he supports.
[01:07:49.127 --> 01:07:52.428]  Let's go see if we can nail down where he stands.
[01:07:52.428 --> 01:07:53.468]  Thank you for asking the question.
[01:07:54.048 --> 01:07:56.731]  There was a question over here.
[01:07:56.731 --> 01:08:04.299]  Yes, are you for third trimester abortions or are you going to protect the lives of third trimester babies?
[01:08:04.299 --> 01:08:08.484]  Because, you know, there's really not a medical necessity for abortion.
[01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:14.691]  It's not a medical emergency procedure because typically third trimester abortions take up to three days to have.
[01:08:15.271 --> 01:08:23.300]  So you would, in that sense, if there was an emergency, the doctors would just do a c-section and you don't have to kill the baby in that essence.
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:26.624]  So are you for or against third trimester abortions?
[01:08:26.624 --> 01:08:31.069]  So the question is about abortion and reproductive rights.
[01:08:31.069 --> 01:08:34.893]  And my answer to you is that that should be a decision that the woman makes.
[01:08:45.163 --> 01:08:49.105]  How do we deal with the fact that the Supreme Court is being... Hit pause real quick.
[01:08:49.105 --> 01:08:51.406]  Back this up 15 seconds.
[01:08:51.406 --> 01:08:54.428]  It's a powerful headline Millie went with last night.
[01:08:54.428 --> 01:08:56.809]  We were talking on the phone and she said what do you think the headline should be?
[01:08:57.845 --> 01:09:02.029]  I'm like, well, you know, how about Beto O'Rourke endorses third trimester abortion, gets cheered.
[01:09:02.029 --> 01:09:06.734]  But she's like, well, I think the headline ought to be his supporters attack me.
[01:09:06.734 --> 01:09:10.698]  And she's probably right, because that's what you're about to hear right now.
[01:09:10.698 --> 01:09:12.900]  And again, it's not just crazed leftist here or there.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.582]  You go anywhere.
[01:09:14.582 --> 01:09:19.747]  Their religion is killing babies for their own good, because the world's going to end in 12 years.
[01:09:19.747 --> 01:09:21.088]  AOC said so.
[01:09:21.088 --> 01:09:21.649]  Please continue.
[01:09:27.659 --> 01:09:34.862]  So there you have it.
[01:09:34.862 --> 01:09:37.863]  Beto O'Rourke supports third trimester abortions.
[01:09:37.863 --> 01:09:43.026]  And when I brought up the subject, it certainly stirred up contention amongst his crowd.
[01:09:43.026 --> 01:09:44.666]  Ma'am, I'm going to clear this way.
[01:09:44.666 --> 01:09:45.607]  Don't push me.
[01:09:45.607 --> 01:09:46.747]  Ma'am, I need to clear this aisle.
[01:09:46.747 --> 01:09:47.248]  Don't push me.
[01:09:47.248 --> 01:09:48.048]  I'm just standing here.
[01:09:48.977 --> 01:09:50.458]  I'm asking real questions.
[01:09:50.458 --> 01:09:55.721]  I'm just curious, how many babies have you adopted?
[01:09:55.721 --> 01:09:58.182]  How many babies have you adopted?
[01:09:58.182 --> 01:09:59.923]  How many babies have you adopted?
[01:09:59.923 --> 01:10:01.344]  How many babies have you adopted?
[01:10:13.615 --> 01:10:15.817]  They run over and they go, how many babies have you adopted?
[01:10:15.817 --> 01:10:17.198]  How many babies have you adopted?
[01:10:17.198 --> 01:10:19.140]  And then you'll say, well actually, I've adopted one.
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:22.142]  And they go, well, it's not a black baby!
[01:10:22.142 --> 01:10:25.045]  Nobody wants those black babies, is normally the thing.
[01:10:25.045 --> 01:10:28.528]  There are more people wanting to adopt each year than there are kids aborted.
[01:10:28.528 --> 01:10:30.069]  Did you know that number?
[01:10:30.069 --> 01:10:33.572]  And women get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in many cases to have the baby.
[01:10:33.572 --> 01:10:36.214]  But women aren't being told this.
[01:10:36.214 --> 01:10:37.776]  Or that their body parts are being sold.
[01:10:37.776 --> 01:10:39.337]  Or they're being kept alive and sold.
[01:10:39.337 --> 01:10:40.338]  That's now all confirmed.
[01:10:42.765 --> 01:10:46.531]  So it's always the same talking points here.
[01:10:46.531 --> 01:10:49.355]  Yes, people want these babies.
[01:10:49.355 --> 01:10:53.221]  People adopt disabled babies too.
[01:10:53.221 --> 01:10:56.967]  But the point is, is that it's a cult.
[01:10:56.967 --> 01:10:57.328]  Continue.
[01:10:58.818 --> 01:11:00.999]  How many babies have you adopted?
[01:11:00.999 --> 01:11:02.199]  I haven't killed any.
[01:11:02.199 --> 01:11:03.459]  I haven't killed any.
[01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.220]  How many have you adopted?
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:08.301]  How many have you adopted?
[01:11:08.301 --> 01:11:08.621]  None!
[01:11:08.621 --> 01:11:10.801]  You've adopted none!
[01:11:10.801 --> 01:11:12.462]  You've adopted none!
[01:11:12.462 --> 01:11:14.803]  You've adopted none!
[01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:16.463]  You're killing them, but slowly.
[01:11:16.463 --> 01:11:18.724]  You're killing them slowly.
[01:11:18.724 --> 01:11:20.164]  Pause again.
[01:11:20.164 --> 01:11:26.426]  The bioethics boards teach that if society's bad and they decide we can kill what we want, because we're saving them from a bad future.
[01:11:27.403 --> 01:11:30.286]  That's how they dehumanize you, but in a loving, liberal way.
[01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.508]  So this guy is, you know, giving you the exact rundown.
[01:11:32.508 --> 01:11:37.453]  We'll talk to Millie in a moment, but understand, if you're a radio listener, you can't see this.
[01:11:37.453 --> 01:11:43.379]  She's just sitting there politely being screamed at with spit flying out their mouths at her.
[01:11:43.379 --> 01:11:46.022]  Because see, their approach, they're God.
[01:11:46.022 --> 01:11:46.623]  Let's continue.
[01:11:49.691 --> 01:11:52.152]  You're a hypocrite!
[01:11:52.152 --> 01:11:52.913]  Pig!
[01:11:52.913 --> 01:11:53.693]  You're a pig!
[01:11:53.693 --> 01:11:55.414]  Because I don't want to have babies!
[01:11:55.414 --> 01:11:56.274]  Oh, you kill them!
[01:11:56.274 --> 01:11:58.855]  You let them live so they can starve to death!
[01:11:58.855 --> 01:12:00.456]  You want to take away welfare?
[01:12:00.456 --> 01:12:02.417]  You want to take their mother's rights away?
[01:12:02.417 --> 01:12:03.297]  You want to kill them?
[01:12:03.297 --> 01:12:03.797]  Pause it again.
[01:12:03.797 --> 01:12:05.178]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[01:12:05.178 --> 01:12:08.360]  You could learn an entire PhD off this guy.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.141]  If you don't have 2.1 kids for every 2 adults...
[01:12:12.182 --> 01:12:14.543]  And the left always goes, there isn't such a thing as 2.1.
[01:12:14.543 --> 01:12:17.504]  Yeah, there are in the millions of people, on average.
[01:12:17.504 --> 01:12:19.105]  We have a 2.1 replacement rate.
[01:12:19.105 --> 01:12:20.825]  That pays for Social Security.
[01:12:20.825 --> 01:12:22.226]  It pays for Medicare and Medicaid.
[01:12:22.226 --> 01:12:23.706]  It pays for the welfare.
[01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:28.588]  In fact, you need a bigger population of like a replacement rate of three to really grow a society.
[01:12:29.892 --> 01:12:32.094]  But he's saying what Bill Gates taught people years ago.
[01:12:32.094 --> 01:12:36.558]  He said, well, if you don't give grandma health care, we can hire 10 teachers.
[01:12:36.558 --> 01:12:40.661]  It's that idea that if you don't have services, it creates more money.
[01:12:40.661 --> 01:12:41.061]  No.
[01:12:41.061 --> 01:12:45.565]  Societies that take care of people create economies based on service.
[01:12:45.565 --> 01:12:53.412]  So they said, get rid of our industrial base so that we can be a service economy, but really they're just getting rid of the service economy as well.
[01:12:53.412 --> 01:12:55.654]  One of the main jobs is nursing homes and taking care of people.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.503]  No, no, let's just kill their ass and then, oh, we'll kill you too.
[01:12:59.503 --> 01:13:01.345]  We've got robots to replace you.
[01:13:01.345 --> 01:13:02.566]  That's what this is.
[01:13:02.566 --> 01:13:04.268]  But this guy listens to NPR.
[01:13:04.268 --> 01:13:07.591]  You know it every day and believes all of it.
[01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:10.614]  But the mathematics, the history, all shows he's wrong.
[01:13:10.614 --> 01:13:17.220]  But here he is calling a mother of two, a woman, a smart lady out there asking questions, a pig.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:17.601]  Here he is.
[01:13:18.612 --> 01:13:19.393]  You're a pig!
[01:13:19.393 --> 01:13:21.094]  Because I don't want to kill babies!
[01:13:21.094 --> 01:13:22.134]  Oh, you kill them!
[01:13:22.134 --> 01:13:24.556]  You let them live so they can starve to death!
[01:13:24.556 --> 01:13:26.157]  You want to take away welfare!
[01:13:26.157 --> 01:13:27.598]  You want to take their mother's rights away!
[01:13:27.598 --> 01:13:28.479]  They're already living!
[01:13:28.479 --> 01:13:29.840]  You want to kill them by killing them slowly!
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.400]  They're already living!
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.621]  You're killing them slowly, honey!
[01:13:31.621 --> 01:13:32.221]  They're already living!
[01:13:32.221 --> 01:13:33.822]  You're killing them slowly!
[01:13:33.822 --> 01:13:35.003]  You're killing them slowly!
[01:13:35.003 --> 01:13:36.184]  You're a murderess!
[01:13:36.184 --> 01:13:37.525]  You're a murderess!
[01:13:37.525 --> 01:13:39.106]  When are you going to stop killing babies?
[01:13:39.106 --> 01:13:40.607]  I'm going to pause again.
[01:13:40.607 --> 01:13:42.808]  This is the leftist total inversion of reality.
[01:13:42.808 --> 01:13:43.449]  This is unedited.
[01:13:45.236 --> 01:13:47.739]  First, oh, have you adopted babies?
[01:13:47.739 --> 01:13:49.582]  Oh no, so you're a pig.
[01:13:49.582 --> 01:13:52.486]  Now you're starving them, now you're a murderer.
[01:13:52.486 --> 01:13:57.133]  So they're killing the kids, but see, not killing them is murder.
[01:13:57.133 --> 01:13:58.535]  That's Satanism.
[01:13:58.535 --> 01:13:59.516]  It's an inversion.
[01:13:59.516 --> 01:13:59.877]  Continue.
[01:14:01.411 --> 01:14:03.333]  It's all again, NPR, worthless college degrees.
[01:14:03.333 --> 01:14:04.233]  What's your major?
[01:14:04.233 --> 01:14:05.695]  You know, we're all gay.
[01:14:05.695 --> 01:14:07.196]  We're all cool, you murderer.
[01:14:29.286 --> 01:14:31.847]  You're not in the in crowd, you know.
[01:14:31.847 --> 01:14:33.127]  What's your major?
[01:14:33.127 --> 01:14:34.648]  Let's continue.
[01:14:34.648 --> 01:14:38.849]  It takes three days to perform a third trimester abortion.
[01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:41.570]  That's not a medical procedure for an emergency.
[01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:50.212]  I'm getting my information from abortionists and from OBGYNs.
[01:14:50.212 --> 01:14:52.773]  She's not getting it from InfoWars, you dumb lady.
[01:14:52.773 --> 01:14:54.394]  She is InfoWars.
[01:14:54.394 --> 01:14:54.994]  Got it?
[01:14:54.994 --> 01:14:55.394]  Continue.
[01:14:56.678 --> 01:15:02.262]  You only care about your body, you don't care about the bodies of unborn babies.
[01:15:02.262 --> 01:15:03.643]  Are you eating cows?
[01:15:03.643 --> 01:15:06.064]  I bet you're eating cows, aren't you?
[01:15:06.064 --> 01:15:06.845]  Eating cows?
[01:15:06.845 --> 01:15:10.667]  I'm sorry, I don't equate an unborn child's life to a cow.
[01:15:10.667 --> 01:15:12.128]  Pause, pause.
[01:15:12.128 --> 01:15:15.551]  This is the ultimate cult.
[01:15:15.551 --> 01:15:21.695]  Animals are on the same level as humans, so if you're eating cows, you're killing your baby.
[01:15:21.695 --> 01:15:22.776]  And they're all like this.
[01:15:22.776 --> 01:15:23.136]  Continue.
[01:15:24.805 --> 01:15:25.746]  So you do?
[01:15:25.746 --> 01:15:28.928]  That's crazy.
[01:15:28.928 --> 01:15:30.029]  Well, there you have it.
[01:15:30.029 --> 01:15:34.913]  Beto O'Rourke just confirmed that he is for third trimester abortions.
[01:15:34.913 --> 01:15:41.538]  And inside, his supporters and onlookers applauded the idea of aborting third trimester babies.
[01:15:41.538 --> 01:15:43.419]  Hey, Beto!
[01:15:43.419 --> 01:15:47.822]  Beto, is the world going to end in 12 years?
[01:15:47.822 --> 01:15:50.084]  Beto, is the world going to end in 12 years?
[01:15:52.891 --> 01:15:54.140]  Well, I know who I'm a fan of.
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.147]  Her name's Millie Weaver.
[01:15:57.549 --> 01:15:58.790]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.790 --> 01:16:00.091]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:16:00.091 --> 01:16:03.834]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.834 --> 01:16:04.914]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.914 --> 01:16:06.736]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:06.736 --> 01:16:08.457]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:16.243 --> 01:16:17.263]  Bold statement?

[01:16:57.108 --> 01:16:58.349]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:16:58.349 --> 01:17:02.253]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:02.253 --> 01:17:03.794]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:03.794 --> 01:17:06.757]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:06.757 --> 01:17:11.962]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:12.302 --> 01:17:13.503]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:13.503 --> 01:17:16.444]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:16.444 --> 01:17:18.665]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:18.665 --> 01:17:23.107]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.
[01:17:23.107 --> 01:17:24.808]  That's DanPilla.com.

[01:18:07.546 --> 01:18:16.549]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:18:16.549 --> 01:18:26.611]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:18:26.611 --> 01:18:35.154]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:18:35.994 --> 01:18:37.334]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:18:37.334 --> 01:18:38.495]  You must experience it.
[01:18:38.495 --> 01:18:40.435]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:18:40.435 --> 01:18:45.497]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:18:45.497 --> 01:18:47.017]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:18:47.017 --> 01:18:48.497]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:18:48.497 --> 01:18:55.179]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:18:55.179 --> 01:18:58.380]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:02.541]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship.
[01:19:03.266 --> 01:19:11.770]  And I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:19:11.770 --> 01:19:24.137]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[01:19:24.137 --> 01:19:26.058]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:19:26.058 --> 01:19:28.739]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:19:30.094 --> 01:19:34.436]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:38.678]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[01:19:38.678 --> 01:19:40.959]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:19:40.959 --> 01:19:43.280]  This country is in a war!
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:53.985]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:19:53.985 --> 01:19:57.567]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[01:20:01.185 --> 01:20:21.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show You may be an ambassador to England
[01:20:31.048 --> 01:20:42.736]  Millie Weaver was back at work a week after she had her second child.
[01:20:42.736 --> 01:20:45.417]  And I told her, take off a couple months.
[01:20:45.417 --> 01:20:48.779]  Told her husband, take off a few months, that her husband and wife team.
[01:20:48.779 --> 01:20:51.201]  And she said, nope, can't stop me.
[01:20:51.201 --> 01:20:54.003]  And she's been more prolific since she had her second awesome baby.
[01:20:55.481 --> 01:20:58.382]  And if you're a radio listener, you're really missing out on getting to actually see Millie.
[01:20:58.382 --> 01:21:00.563]  She's also a very lovely, sweet lady.
[01:21:00.563 --> 01:21:10.747]  And you know why the system's attacking women and children and the entire family, because women are the heart of the family, and the children are the fruit of the family, and men are supposed to defend the family.
[01:21:10.747 --> 01:21:15.689]  And we've advocated our responsibility, and I just noticed, and I'm not trying to shame anybody,
[01:21:16.806 --> 01:21:22.928]  A lot of great people, but it's our female reporters that are just dominating and slaying it.
[01:21:22.928 --> 01:21:29.189]  When you go out and you see all these Hollywood movies, like they say, the hero must be a heroine.
[01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:30.630]  And then it's always this anti-male deal.
[01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:32.670]  No, no, it's women and men empowering each other.
[01:21:32.670 --> 01:21:34.031]  And you've got other big breaking news.
[01:21:34.031 --> 01:21:36.371]  We're gonna hit the final segment that's so huge.
[01:21:36.371 --> 01:21:38.272]  And the promo piece we've got is so staggering.
[01:21:39.619 --> 01:21:41.581]  Where you and others actually have the proof.
[01:21:41.581 --> 01:21:47.886]  You infiltrated the leftist troll farm out there posting racist comments and creating division.
[01:21:47.886 --> 01:21:52.249]  I mean, if people get this report coming out, it could blow up the Death Star.
[01:21:52.249 --> 01:21:52.670]  Politically.
[01:21:52.670 --> 01:21:55.832]  They'll say, Jones actually wants to... That's a metaphor, folks.
[01:21:55.832 --> 01:21:57.514]  I know our viewers and listeners get it.
[01:21:58.234 --> 01:22:00.939]  Every time I do that, it's, Jones wants to blow up a Death Star!
[01:22:00.939 --> 01:22:03.523]  We're not sure where the plastic explosives are!
[01:22:03.523 --> 01:22:06.308]  The point is, is it could bring down their whole house of cards.
[01:22:06.308 --> 01:22:09.473]  And just show, not just the censorship, but the coordinated evil.
[01:22:09.473 --> 01:22:10.214]  But Billy, I'm gonna say it.
[01:22:11.328 --> 01:22:14.070]  You helped get Caitlyn Bennett working for Infowars.
[01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:16.752]  You've got a lot of other people you want to get on board.
[01:22:16.752 --> 01:22:22.277]  And you're not just female-centric in that most of the reporters you want to hire are women.
[01:22:22.277 --> 01:22:27.881]  That's who's really, I'm not just saying this to like brownie points with women, it's just true, are women.
[01:22:27.881 --> 01:22:33.105]  And that's why we need funds to pay for the plane tickets, the cars, the film.
[01:22:33.105 --> 01:22:35.867]  People like Caitlyn only wanted money to pay her expenses.
[01:22:35.867 --> 01:22:36.488]  She's awesome.
[01:22:37.128 --> 01:22:49.030]  So, it comes down to that we need people to buy products at Infowarsstore.com and realize we're swinging for the fences here and we're knocking home runs and grand slams routinely.
[01:22:49.030 --> 01:23:04.974]  Folks, there's nowhere where you can go buy products and get great products at the same time fund individuals and organizations that are dead in the crosshairs of the globalists because we bring the pain to the globalists.
[01:23:04.974 --> 01:23:06.154]  It's always clutch time here.
[01:23:07.125 --> 01:23:11.926]  And I gotta say it, InfoWars is kind of the Tom Brady of news and information.
[01:23:11.926 --> 01:23:16.507]  And so, we need your prayers, we need your support, we need you to support local stations.
[01:23:16.507 --> 01:23:17.627]  That means thank them.
[01:23:17.627 --> 01:23:20.208]  That means send them a $100 bill as a tithe every month.
[01:23:20.208 --> 01:23:24.109]  Because if your preachers aren't covering the pedophile rings in your town, they're part of it.
[01:23:24.109 --> 01:23:25.649]  So yes, please tithe.
[01:23:25.649 --> 01:23:27.990]  It's not tax deductible to the Mark of the Beast system.
[01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:30.911]  Buy some super blue fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:23:30.911 --> 01:23:33.891]  Buy some X2 that's now back in stock by a miracle.
[01:23:33.891 --> 01:23:35.252]  We've got it back to good halogen.
[01:23:35.252 --> 01:23:39.733]  Buy our great turmeric bodies and all the amazing anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.
[01:23:39.733 --> 01:23:41.293]  It's the best turmeric out there.
[01:23:41.293 --> 01:23:43.134]  Whatever you do, get free shipping.
[01:23:43.134 --> 01:23:44.054]  50% off right now.
[01:23:44.054 --> 01:23:44.954]  The sale's got to end soon.
[01:23:44.954 --> 01:23:46.295]  There's a lot of stuff selling out.
[01:23:46.295 --> 01:23:47.095]  And thank you for your support.
[01:23:47.435 --> 01:23:51.136]  All right, Millie, thanks for holding while I went over your incredible report.
[01:23:51.136 --> 01:23:54.198]  Let's get into Beto and how empty-eyed he looked.
[01:23:54.198 --> 01:23:58.119]  And we can play for TV viewers without audio, just the first part where she asked the question.
[01:23:58.119 --> 01:24:02.081]  I mean, he is truly a slave, truly a vacant, empty...
[01:24:03.021 --> 01:24:05.845]  Avatar of a dark spider-like force.
[01:24:05.845 --> 01:24:08.828]  He's like the spider down the hole that has hit the clown on its finger.
[01:24:08.828 --> 01:24:15.256]  You know, this hit-and-run individual, this liar, this guy running caravans in the U.S.
[01:24:15.256 --> 01:24:20.622]  But I mean, there he is looking at you, and I mean, this is who they've got to offer.
[01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:22.004]  Tell us what it was like to actually be there.
[01:24:23.396 --> 01:24:32.944]  Well, you know, Beto puts on this persona that, you know, it's all about Beto, and he has this charismatic vibe about him, kind of similar to Obama.
[01:24:32.944 --> 01:24:39.130]  But really, don't be fooled, because he's displaying many of the characteristics of a sociopath.
[01:24:39.130 --> 01:24:50.100]  And some of the statements he made when he was a teenager that he recently apologized for, where he envisioned and imagined mowing down children with a car, it gives you a tell
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:56.342]  This man is possibly a sociopath and that's why he acts like this narcissist.
[01:24:56.342 --> 01:24:59.142]  I mean, he just wanted to take selfies with everyone.
[01:24:59.142 --> 01:25:00.123]  And they love it!
[01:25:00.123 --> 01:25:04.984]  I mean, he's a nobody with a bunch of other nobodies who want to believe they've brushed greatness.
[01:25:04.984 --> 01:25:08.545]  When it's not a sociopath, Millie, it's psychotic to say you want to kill kids.
[01:25:09.617 --> 01:25:10.458]  Oh, it is!
[01:25:10.458 --> 01:25:26.232]  And, you know, that's why I was trying to, because he likes to put on this image that he's all about humanity and he cares about children, he cares about people, and, you know, that's why I wanted to ask him what his stance was on third trimester abortions to see what his reaction would be.
[01:25:26.232 --> 01:25:32.558]  Is he going to stand up for humanity, small children that can't defend themselves in the womb, that are viable?
[01:25:33.118 --> 01:25:42.641]  Or is he going to go along and tow that Democrat line and that line that the globalists want to push for depopulation, which is promoting and pushing third trimester abortions.
[01:25:42.641 --> 01:25:48.482]  And without fail, Beto O'Rourke essentially endorsed third trimester abortions.
[01:25:48.482 --> 01:25:49.502]  He said he supported it.
[01:25:49.502 --> 01:25:51.603]  He said the woman has the right to choose.
[01:25:51.603 --> 01:25:52.283]  I trust her.
[01:25:52.283 --> 01:25:53.503]  That's what he says.
[01:25:53.503 --> 01:25:59.265]  And he was followed by applause and cheering from many of the liberals that were in the crowd there.
[01:25:59.785 --> 01:26:04.746]  And this whole women's right to choose, oh, it sounds so innocent, but don't be fooled.
[01:26:04.746 --> 01:26:24.631]  And the truth was revealed when these leftists came up to me screaming, acting almost demonically possessed, harassing me, yelling angry, frothing at the mouth, calling me a pig because, you know, I just asked a question about, you know, abortion and whether he wants to support killing third trimester babies.
[01:26:25.211 --> 01:26:26.993]  You know, it really was revealing.
[01:26:26.993 --> 01:26:31.177]  One lady even compared the children to cows.
[01:26:31.177 --> 01:26:32.939]  She said, oh, I bet you eat cows.
[01:26:32.939 --> 01:26:36.663]  I'm like, I don't compare unborn babies to cows.
[01:26:36.663 --> 01:26:38.805]  From a leftist, we're all animals compared to them.
[01:26:38.805 --> 01:26:41.848]  So if you're eating animals, humans are animals.
[01:26:41.848 --> 01:26:43.110]  She's telling you what she thinks of you.
[01:26:44.333 --> 01:26:47.476]  It reminds me literally of like Cain and Abel.
[01:26:47.476 --> 01:26:51.299]  When Cain, you know, he offered up meat.
[01:26:51.299 --> 01:26:57.383]  Or no, Cain was the one who killed his brother and offered up the vegetables, like these vegan vegetarians.
[01:26:57.383 --> 01:26:59.445]  And he killed Abel, he killed his brother.
[01:26:59.445 --> 01:27:02.648]  So he saw nothing wrong with killing his brother, a human,
[01:27:03.328 --> 01:27:05.930]  But he didn't want to kill an animal to offer it up to God?
[01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:07.952]  I mean, that's kind of how these vegans think.
[01:27:07.952 --> 01:27:16.759]  Most of these vegetarian and vegans that are liberals and leftists, they think, oh, there's nothing wrong with aborting human babies, but oh, you are evil, you're a murderer.
[01:27:16.759 --> 01:27:21.003]  No, they're exactly, they're into the power of killing humans.
[01:27:21.003 --> 01:27:23.085]  It's a religion.
[01:27:24.443 --> 01:27:25.444]  And you know what's crazy?
[01:27:25.444 --> 01:27:29.367]  When he pulled up to this event, Beto pulled up in a minivan.
[01:27:29.367 --> 01:27:31.909]  It was like a total PR publicity stunt.
[01:27:31.909 --> 01:27:34.911]  They were trying to make him look like this likable, relatable guy.
[01:27:34.911 --> 01:27:42.797]  It was at a bar where people could drink beer so that, you know, this hole-in-the-wall bar was going to appeal and establish rapport with people.
[01:27:43.357 --> 01:27:52.444]  And of course, it was such a small venue, they had overflow, but that's because he couldn't draw such a large crowd in a place like Ohio where most people don't know about him.
[01:27:52.444 --> 01:27:58.148]  I'll just say this, he has that mentally ill, psychotic, kind of schizophrenic look that Bernie Sanders has.
[01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:03.374]  And when you deal with these type of psychotics, all they think is, I'm going to rule.
[01:28:03.374 --> 01:28:04.874]  I'm going to run them.
[01:28:04.874 --> 01:28:06.695]  I'm supposed to be in charge.
[01:28:06.695 --> 01:28:08.155]  And of course, you now hear his quotes.
[01:28:08.155 --> 01:28:09.835]  I'm born to be president.
[01:28:09.835 --> 01:28:11.576]  I will run things now.
[01:28:11.576 --> 01:28:14.997]  He's even worse than Obama, where all he was a state rep and couldn't even stay in that.
[01:28:14.997 --> 01:28:17.897]  Not like he was a state senator, then a senator, then president.
[01:28:17.897 --> 01:28:19.958]  He's just, I'm Beto.
[01:28:19.958 --> 01:28:21.358]  I now am your leader.
[01:28:22.987 --> 01:28:37.730]  Beto has been trying to avoid coming out and revealing his policies and his stance on certain issues that are controversial because he's sticking to the more friendly ones like legalizing marijuana, opinions that are more moderate.
[01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:42.152]  He's staying away from these touchy subjects because he doesn't want to scare people away.
[01:28:42.152 --> 01:28:44.672]  And most people don't know what his stances are on these policies.
[01:28:44.672 --> 01:28:50.914]  I just don't know how people don't see that he's clearly a horrible, criminal, evil demon.
[01:28:50.914 --> 01:28:52.054]  Not just a hit and run guy.
[01:28:52.754 --> 01:28:55.635]  You know, worship's killing children, or, you know, eats dirt.
[01:28:55.635 --> 01:28:57.476]  That's in the news.
[01:28:57.476 --> 01:28:57.776]  Ew!
[01:28:57.776 --> 01:28:59.737]  Get the stinky dog away from me!
[01:28:59.737 --> 01:29:01.298]  Bad breath and bad gas.
[01:29:01.298 --> 01:29:02.438]  PDE stopped eating.
[01:29:02.438 --> 01:29:03.839]  All of his hair fell out.
[01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:06.019]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[01:29:06.019 --> 01:29:08.260]  At least $5,000 in fat bill.
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:10.281]  Creams, antibiotics, sprays.
[01:29:10.281 --> 01:29:11.202]  No results.
[01:29:11.202 --> 01:29:13.703]  Everything we tried failed except the Dynavite.

[01:29:16.624 --> 01:29:18.945]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you gotta feed it something healthy.
[01:29:19.445 --> 01:29:19.945]  She's got life.
[01:29:19.945 --> 01:29:20.625]  She's got energy.
[01:29:20.625 --> 01:29:23.307]  Dinovite is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs.
[01:29:23.307 --> 01:29:24.487]  You know, besides me, of course.
[01:29:46.596 --> 01:29:46.676]  859-428-1000.
[01:29:46.676 --> 01:29:46.756]  859-428-1000.
[01:29:46.756 --> 01:29:47.738]  Dynavite for life.

[01:30:45.549 --> 01:30:47.069]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:30:47.069 --> 01:30:48.550]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:55.232]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[01:33:01.232 --> 01:33:03.855]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.508 --> 01:33:25.474]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.474 --> 01:33:36.166]  There is no one more empty.
[01:33:36.166 --> 01:33:36.786]  No one more...
[01:33:41.552 --> 01:33:47.674]  Absolutely husk-like than Beto O'Rourke and maybe AOC.
[01:33:47.674 --> 01:33:59.957]  And they signify the vapid emptiness of the millennial voter who is in a leftist cult in echo chambers believing they've arrived.
[01:33:59.957 --> 01:34:03.238]  These are the kids either wanted to be class president or were class president.
[01:34:04.352 --> 01:34:23.470]  And then now high school and college is over, and they want to make the whole world this place where they say what's cool, they say what's not, they censor, they control, and they just create these grand falloons, these things that don't matter, that's a Kurt Vonnegut term, that they then celebrate.
[01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:27.034]  And AOC, and Peto O'Rourke,
[01:34:28.106 --> 01:34:30.347]  I don't respect him, so I never say his name right.
[01:34:30.347 --> 01:34:33.308]  People keep saying, you know, his name's Beto, or Beto, or whatever it is.
[01:34:33.308 --> 01:34:34.309]  To the point you don't know, right?
[01:34:34.309 --> 01:34:35.549]  Because he's a joke.
[01:34:35.549 --> 01:34:37.370]  That's not his name.
[01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:39.110]  They just do that to patronize Hispanics.
[01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.971]  I'm sick of it.
[01:34:39.971 --> 01:34:43.632]  Oh, my name's Alejandro.
[01:34:43.632 --> 01:34:46.854]  Give me a break.
[01:34:46.854 --> 01:34:49.054]  He's a predator.
[01:34:49.054 --> 01:34:50.895]  Period.
[01:34:50.895 --> 01:34:52.996]  But Millie Weaver's doing a great job.
[01:34:52.996 --> 01:34:57.598]  She and others just infiltrated these leftist troll farms that go out and pose as racist conservatives.
[01:34:58.919 --> 01:35:00.141]  This is coming out in the near future.
[01:35:00.141 --> 01:35:02.564]  It's a production of NewsWars.com.
[01:35:02.564 --> 01:35:03.225]  We're very proud of that.
[01:35:03.225 --> 01:35:07.912]  We'll have the full investigative reports posted to NewsWars on these break, the next 48 hours.
[01:35:07.912 --> 01:35:08.773]  That's coming up next segment.

[01:35:53.512 --> 01:36:10.285]  And it's those staples that then you just know you're funding the info war, you know you're doing your part in a big way that goes so far to block all the globalist lawsuits, and to block all their attacks, and to expand, and to metastasize in a good way, and to get more reporters and be more hardcore.
[01:36:10.805 --> 01:36:17.969]  And to not give up, but you are the oxygen, and the guts, and the blood of this operation, and the eyes and the ears.
[01:36:17.969 --> 01:36:19.751]  And we make it so easy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:19.751 --> 01:36:22.412]  So shop at infowarestore.com today.

[01:36:31.458 --> 01:36:35.200]  But, we're gonna run this special throughout the month.
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.762]  50% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot Points,
[01:36:38.923 --> 01:36:44.045]  A few things are going to have to get pulled, like the protein bars and turbo forces are about to sell out.
[01:36:44.045 --> 01:36:47.166]  And then I guess the next thing we're getting close to is the fish oil.
[01:36:47.166 --> 01:36:48.606]  We have it for adults.
[01:36:48.606 --> 01:36:51.007]  It's the highest rated, the cleanest, the best.
[01:36:51.007 --> 01:36:54.128]  And for the kids, it doesn't give you a little bit of burpees.
[01:36:54.128 --> 01:36:59.810]  And then the wild harvested salmon from the fjords of northern Europe, it doesn't give you burpees.
[01:36:59.810 --> 01:37:03.751]  The krill is the highest rated, strongest, best for you out there.
[01:37:04.591 --> 01:37:06.172]  But it gives you fish burps.
[01:37:06.172 --> 01:37:07.652]  I'm not going to lie to anybody.
[01:37:07.652 --> 01:37:09.693]  You try to buy the denatured stuff, it isn't effective.
[01:37:09.693 --> 01:37:12.754]  They have to cook it so it doesn't have the fish taste.
[01:37:12.754 --> 01:37:14.314]  Your brain's made of this stuff.
[01:37:14.314 --> 01:37:15.855]  Your arteries are made of it.
[01:37:15.855 --> 01:37:17.475]  It's, it's, talk about energy.
[01:37:17.475 --> 01:37:20.256]  It's, it's, krill oil is the best there is.
[01:37:20.256 --> 01:37:21.957]  And we have ultimate krill oil.
[01:37:21.957 --> 01:37:24.418]  But I'm going to tell you, it's not been pasteurized.
[01:37:24.418 --> 01:37:26.058]  It's not been boiled.
[01:37:26.058 --> 01:37:28.539]  It's, it's had the mercury removed and that's it.
[01:37:28.539 --> 01:37:30.340]  It's raw concentrate.
[01:37:31.465 --> 01:37:34.848]  And it's all about to sell out, 50% off, but Honor Roll's amazing as well.
[01:37:34.848 --> 01:37:37.710]  It's a spectrum of fish oils for your children.
[01:37:37.710 --> 01:37:41.173]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:41.173 --> 01:37:43.115]  All right, back to Millie.
[01:37:43.115 --> 01:37:44.276]  Millie, I've been ranting, I've been ranting.
[01:37:44.276 --> 01:37:45.437]  I'm trying to shut up to give you the floor.
[01:37:45.437 --> 01:37:47.318]  So you're in the midst of these monsters.
[01:37:50.561 --> 01:37:55.307]  I mean, the Beto supporters demonically attacked female reporter, verbally.
[01:37:55.307 --> 01:37:57.189]  I think that's really what happened here.
[01:37:57.189 --> 01:38:01.714]  Continue on and then give us a prelude to what's coming up next segment with your great infiltration.
[01:38:03.228 --> 01:38:16.359]  Okay, so after, you know, the screaming and the harassment happened inside of the event, I walked outside and there were still crowds of these attendees that were going to this Beto event.
[01:38:16.359 --> 01:38:31.751]  Now, before the event, some of the attendees said they didn't even know what Beto's policies were, and that's why they were coming to hear him out, because Beto's been so hushed about his policies, because he doesn't want to scare away people with some of his more extreme, far-left, progressive policies.
[01:38:32.344 --> 01:38:43.547]  So, once the cat was out of the bag with these, you know, third trimester abortion policies he wants to push, it actually stirred up contention amongst the people attending.
[01:38:43.547 --> 01:38:55.510]  Some people were attacking me and then other people jumped out and started defending life, defending these unborn babies, and it actually stirred up fighting and contention amongst the attendees, and it showed that
[01:38:56.290 --> 01:39:04.133]  This subject, third trimester abortions, has the potential to actually split the Democratic base.
[01:39:04.133 --> 01:39:08.474]  Because the moderate Democrats actually don't want third trimester abortions.
[01:39:08.474 --> 01:39:16.057]  A Gallup poll came out and it revealed that only 13% of Americans are for third trimester abortions.
[01:39:16.577 --> 01:39:24.187]  So that's why this video is so important and many of you guys out there really should be spreading the links to this content.
[01:39:24.187 --> 01:39:33.979]  You can find my video Millennial Millie on YouTube or Millie Weaver on Facebook or Millie underscore Weaver on Twitter but these videos need to be out there.
[01:39:33.979 --> 01:39:34.860]  They need to be shared.
[01:39:36.028 --> 01:39:53.120]  People need to expose Beto O'Rourke for his progressive extreme ideals of wanting to abort completely viable babies that you could just do a c-section and remove them safely from the mother in the womb and give them a chance at life.
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:40:02.607]  Yes, some of them, they might not make it, but you can at least give them, you know, life resuscitation and life support to help them to live.
[01:40:03.087 --> 01:40:06.349]  So, please go ahead and share those videos.
[01:40:06.349 --> 01:40:16.516]  And Alex, you know, as far as this other special report that I have coming out soon, the Leftist Troll Farm video, this is going to be a huge report.
[01:40:16.516 --> 01:40:20.479]  You can find the trailer as well on my channel, Millennial Millie.
[01:40:20.479 --> 01:40:22.880]  I don't know if you wanted to get into that, this segment, Alex.
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:23.321]  Oh, I do.
[01:40:23.321 --> 01:40:26.383]  We're going to come back in the next break and play the trailer.
[01:40:27.363 --> 01:40:30.004]  But, you know, we know the left goes out and poses as conservatives.
[01:40:30.004 --> 01:40:31.804]  That's how they woke up Candace Owens.
[01:40:31.804 --> 01:40:33.724]  She had a powerful site she'd built.
[01:40:33.724 --> 01:40:35.425]  So they would target her as right-wingers.
[01:40:35.425 --> 01:40:37.845]  They were going to get her and suddenly leftists contacted.
[01:40:37.845 --> 01:40:46.367]  But she tracked her IP addresses and found the leftists were threatening and harassing her to then get her to go to them and be protected by them.
[01:40:46.367 --> 01:40:47.707]  That's what the colleges do.
[01:40:47.707 --> 01:40:51.228]  So they run false flags routinely and you basically caught this group doing that.
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:41:02.212]  Well, what we caught them doing was essentially creating a troll farm and our infiltrator essentially got in.
[01:41:02.212 --> 01:41:04.275]  These were all password protected.
[01:41:06.789 --> 01:41:31.014]  platforms essentially that these troll groups would use to operate in there they're operating in encrypted message boards so that they can share all their information without having it traced back to them and they would give each other instructions how to hide their VPNs essentially their fingerprints on the internet so that when they're doing all this trolling creating all of these fake accounts posing as right-wing extremists
[01:41:31.874 --> 01:41:45.616]  In order to troll content creators like myself, a conservative, and other conservatives out there to paint us and color us as extremists, they could do that safely without being outed or doxxed or found out.
[01:41:45.616 --> 01:41:56.958]  So, the whole point of this troll farm was essentially to paint and color people like InfoWars, Breitbart, myself, Jack Basovic.
[01:41:56.958 --> 01:42:00.659]  I mean, some of these people are literally mentioned and targeted in these threads.
[01:42:01.485 --> 01:42:20.553]  And the idea is put all these comments and give directives to these trolls to make it appear that they are extremist or racist, homophobic, hateful, that these are breeding grounds for hate so that then they can point the finger at us.
[01:42:21.213 --> 01:42:26.376]  And that's exactly what Oliver Darcy came out last week and said.
[01:42:26.376 --> 01:42:30.339]  He goes, we have to ban everybody because there's hateful comments at InfoWars.
[01:42:30.339 --> 01:42:31.239]  So that's their next thing.
[01:42:31.239 --> 01:42:38.324]  And of course, they're famously, probably Darcy himself, I would imagine, in there typing it himself.
[01:42:38.324 --> 01:42:38.924]  Oh, I'm sure.
[01:42:38.924 --> 01:42:44.708]  I'm sure Darcy's getting the same directives that the same people are giving the directives to this troll farm.
[01:42:44.708 --> 01:42:49.191]  I mean, he literally quotes one of the directives verbatim in one of his tweets.
[01:42:50.373 --> 01:42:56.197]  Wow, we're gonna come back with a trailer for this, and then Millie will tell us when the full report, Project Veritas-level stuff's coming out.
[01:42:56.197 --> 01:42:58.059]  Stay with us.

[01:47:01.230 --> 01:47:04.053]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.797 --> 01:47:23.880]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:27.102]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:27.102 --> 01:47:28.683]  Here's the trailer for the big bombshell.
[01:47:28.683 --> 01:47:30.744]  Millie Weaver of Infowars.com is about to drop.
[01:47:33.795 --> 01:47:39.936]  Curiously, I wanted to see what it was like to be inside one of these discord groups that were propagating the Yang Gang meme.
[01:47:39.936 --> 01:47:53.279]  So we had an undercover infiltrate a leftist troll farm the last week and what's interesting is this troll farm was getting actual directives on how to sow division and discontent.
[01:47:53.279 --> 01:47:56.380]  Their belief currently is that the United States
[01:48:02.738 --> 01:48:11.806]  Prior to anyone reporting it, we obtained documents which have subsequently been leaked on 4chan that connect to the New Zealand Shooter's Manifesto.
[01:48:16.329 --> 01:48:17.130]  Yes!
[01:48:17.130 --> 01:48:25.455]  There was a large effort to do a file dump of the Discord servers that, uh, appeared to be where these memes were being coordinated from.
[01:48:25.455 --> 01:48:29.838]  This New Zealand shooting happened, and we're watching the troll farms come into action.
[01:48:29.838 --> 01:48:41.346]  There was a shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, being blamed on a self-confessed white supremacist, who several hours before the attack submitted a manifesto to 8chan.
[01:48:41.346 --> 01:48:42.507]  Where I discovered
[01:48:43.367 --> 01:48:48.449]  A network of text documents and posts that link to each other.
[01:48:48.449 --> 01:48:55.812]  So you're saying you've got the proof of their pulling this crap, and then Oliver Darcy, that snake, says shut down Infowars, they've got racist commenters.
[01:48:56.451 --> 01:48:56.951]  That's right!
[01:48:56.951 --> 01:49:05.295]  The release of documents several days ago on 4chan and 8chan were basically the game plan to influence the public discourse on the message boards.
[01:49:21.561 --> 01:49:24.624]  There's literal psyops going on right now on the American public.
[01:49:24.624 --> 01:49:28.567]  To basically drive the United States into the wall.
[01:49:28.567 --> 01:49:30.689]  To put the foot on the accelerator.
[01:49:30.689 --> 01:49:35.333]  Which is to accelerate things to its inevitable point as quickly as possible.
[01:49:35.333 --> 01:49:36.334]  To sow more hatred.
[01:49:38.075 --> 01:49:53.759]  This could be seen as perhaps a grassroots effort by disaffected groups to spoil the plan of the globalists, or it could be seen as a plan by the globalists to basically induce chaos into a system that they're losing control of.
[01:49:53.759 --> 01:50:01.981]  We must ask ourselves, how much of this supposed hate speech that we see on the internet today is really just artificial?
[01:50:02.381 --> 01:50:21.827]  Rather than lose control of meme culture, of the internet, of public discourse, maybe they want to drive us into open conflict using the concept of accelerationism and therefore scare people, cause civil war, cause the meme war to erupt into a shooting war.
[01:50:21.827 --> 01:50:25.228]  To get the United States to be destroyed or get a thousand dollars in the process.
[01:50:27.369 --> 01:50:34.116]  But if you read the WikiLeaks, they want to collapse the U.S., they want to collapse the borders, they want to say America's evil and racist.
[01:50:34.116 --> 01:50:35.217]  It has to be brought down.
[01:50:35.217 --> 01:50:38.481]  I mean, we know that's real because of the propaganda and the documents.
[01:50:38.481 --> 01:50:39.983]  But Millie, we have Candace Owens.
[01:50:39.983 --> 01:50:41.024]  She named the groups.
[01:50:41.024 --> 01:50:43.486]  She showed the emails where she was prominent.
[01:50:44.207 --> 01:50:47.929]  Good-looking, well-spoken, a mainline liberal, not a leftist.
[01:50:47.929 --> 01:50:53.053]  She wanted to create an internet system to unify people, so they had the left threaten her, attack her.
[01:50:53.053 --> 01:50:59.757]  She was smart enough to check IP addresses and learn that it wasn't right-wing doing it with the left offering to save her, it was them.
[01:50:59.757 --> 01:51:09.563]  It was literal CIA operatives like Gloria Steinem, but 2.0, leftist, quote, feminist, who really just create farms of caged women they control.
[01:51:10.184 --> 01:51:14.142]  As soon as you get to university now, they take the nerd kids off the bus.
[01:51:15.049 --> 01:51:20.871]  They go, there's a KKK rally tonight, and somebody puts a swastika on their dorm, and they come, they go, it's all right, we're gonna keep you safe.
[01:51:20.871 --> 01:51:26.672]  Come in here, and they're like, we're gonna give you fisting lessons now, literally, or pedophilia is good, we're gonna teach you.
[01:51:26.672 --> 01:51:37.296]  And then they're just brought into this devil cult of antifa professors and weirdos, and I mean, you cannot make up how evil they are, and they're literally mind-screwing terrorists.
[01:51:37.296 --> 01:51:41.577]  Most of these groups are run by psychologists, psychiatrists, I mean, this is a cult.
[01:51:46.519 --> 01:51:48.822]  Millie, I'm sorry, we've lost your audio.
[01:51:48.822 --> 01:51:50.944]  Maybe that's on your end or is that on our end?
[01:51:50.944 --> 01:51:51.825]  Oh, it's on mine.
[01:51:51.825 --> 01:51:52.186]  Okay.
[01:51:52.186 --> 01:51:53.007]  No, no, it's not on yours.
[01:51:53.007 --> 01:51:53.648]  Go ahead and start over.
[01:51:55.020 --> 01:52:17.927]  So what we have here is we have this group of accelerationists, essentially the young generation that are anarchists, antifa, essentially radicals, that are the ones operating the troll farm and they're buying into this idea of accelerationism where you create extremists on the right, extremists on the left, you create all this acceleration
[01:52:18.867 --> 01:52:26.794]  Until chaos erupts and then they think that, you know, people are going to find a middle ground or they might destroy America.
[01:52:26.794 --> 01:52:29.857]  I mean, these people are radicals, essentially.
[01:52:29.857 --> 01:52:40.906]  So this group of radicals are being utilized by the globalists who have this narrative because their narrative is essentially to use these groups that they're paying essentially to
[01:52:42.467 --> 01:52:51.749]  They create this radical appearance on websites like InfoWars or Breitbart or on my YouTube channel, on other people's YouTube channels.
[01:52:51.749 --> 01:52:56.810]  So on social media, they'll attack certain videos, certain content, certain articles.
[01:52:56.810 --> 01:53:00.191]  And what they do is, look, go look in the comment threads.
[01:53:00.191 --> 01:53:03.092]  Look, these are all a bunch of hate pockets.
[01:53:03.092 --> 01:53:04.212]  They're creating hate.
[01:53:04.212 --> 01:53:08.293]  All their commenters, the people commenting and watching their content,
[01:53:08.633 --> 01:53:09.154]  Are you sure?
[01:53:26.707 --> 01:53:28.750]  But of course, leftist sites, they can do whatever they want.
[01:53:28.750 --> 01:53:30.012]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:53:30.012 --> 01:53:31.094]  This is their game plan.
[01:53:31.094 --> 01:53:33.056]  Oliver Darcy has signaled that.
[01:53:33.056 --> 01:53:37.122]  He quarterbacks that for CNN, along with Brian Stelter.
[01:53:37.122 --> 01:53:40.928]  So they are doing this, and in the main, your report is incredibly accurate.
[01:53:40.928 --> 01:53:41.970]  What do we do about this?
[01:53:43.254 --> 01:53:58.836]  Well Alex, do you remember months ago when I was warning about a possible terrorist attack or something along those lines that would be used to demonize social media and free speech and essentially further ban people on the conservatives?
[01:53:59.176 --> 01:54:00.677]  They're going to use the global troll war.
[01:54:26.372 --> 01:54:26.853]  To get it.
[01:54:26.853 --> 01:54:30.855]  They're saying 10 years in prison in New Zealand if you possess the video.
[01:54:30.855 --> 01:54:35.319]  Well, Zabruder shot Kennedy getting his head blown off and he won awards.
[01:54:35.319 --> 01:54:39.842]  So, and again on PBS they show Nazis shooting people in pits.
[01:54:39.842 --> 01:54:40.903]  Since when?
[01:54:40.903 --> 01:54:41.643]  I don't want to show it.
[01:54:41.643 --> 01:54:42.964]  I'm not going to show it.
[01:54:42.964 --> 01:54:45.406]  We've showed blurred versions like CNN has.
[01:54:45.406 --> 01:54:47.828]  But CNN's allowed to that supposedly we're not.
[01:54:47.828 --> 01:54:49.089]  So this is just crazy.
[01:54:50.123 --> 01:54:56.347]  And you know, we're not saying that the New Zealand shooting or Christchurch shooting didn't happen and that people didn't die.
[01:54:56.347 --> 01:55:15.581]  We're saying these things did happen, but what we're saying is that it's very, it's possible, it's likely that the shooter was actually engaging in this subculture of accelerationism where you go out and troll online and he took it to the next level, potentially trolling in the real life and enacting a shooting.
[01:55:15.581 --> 01:55:17.142]  And Millie, you just hit the nail on the head.
[01:55:17.802 --> 01:55:25.383]  When you talk about this accelerationism and creating the crisis, it's the dialectic, it's the Hegelian dialectic.
[01:55:25.383 --> 01:55:27.584]  That's what Charlie Manson was doing.
[01:55:27.584 --> 01:55:29.824]  He was being managed by San Francisco and L.A.
[01:55:29.824 --> 01:55:31.064]  Elite, that's admitted.
[01:55:31.064 --> 01:55:34.865]  Theodore Kaczynski was in the CIA in MKUltra, that's admitted.
[01:55:34.865 --> 01:55:37.045]  That's mainline news, folks.
[01:55:37.045 --> 01:55:37.505]  Don't believe me?
[01:55:37.505 --> 01:55:40.626]  Type in Unabomber with CIA, Unabomber MKUltra.
[01:55:40.626 --> 01:55:45.367]  Just click Google Images, it has the news articles from the 1990s showing it.
[01:55:45.367 --> 01:55:46.867]  So, there's this obsession.
[01:55:48.428 --> 01:55:52.709]  In the intelligentsia and in the intelligence agencies about a global crisis.
[01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:57.131]  Just like AOC says there won't be any humans in 12 years.
[01:55:57.131 --> 01:56:06.773]  Well that's because the globalists actually have a plan and a timeline around those lines to bring in bioweapon releases, huge wars, and out of that the new silicon human rises.
[01:56:06.773 --> 01:56:08.974]  And that's what Elon Musk has talked about in these elite meetings.
[01:56:08.974 --> 01:56:10.955]  So people laugh at AOC.
[01:56:10.955 --> 01:56:14.836]  She's being told this by high up people because they're really considering doing this.
[01:56:16.542 --> 01:56:27.376]  One of the interesting things that we saw was that we were watching this troll farm before the New Zealand shooting and they were in full mode trolling, engaging.
[01:56:27.376 --> 01:56:29.999]  It was reaching its climactic moment.
[01:56:29.999 --> 01:56:31.882]  As soon as the New Zealand
[01:56:32.282 --> 01:56:32.983]  I don't know.
[01:56:47.885 --> 01:56:53.128]  It was like the people inside got freaked out and all wanted to back out of the troll farm.
[01:56:53.128 --> 01:56:58.452]  So we saw that and we thought, that looks really suspicious, this weird activity that's happening here.
[01:56:58.452 --> 01:57:06.477]  But if you want to find the full report, we will be releasing it tomorrow on my YouTube channel, Millennial Millie on YouTube.
[01:57:06.477 --> 01:57:07.477]  Well, that's amazing.
[01:57:07.477 --> 01:57:09.539]  And again, folks, YouTube just came out.
[01:57:10.646 --> 01:57:16.892]  Uh, and said that, uh, they are going to... No, that's not the article.
[01:57:16.892 --> 01:57:18.613]  That's, that's the wrong article we put on screen.
[01:57:18.613 --> 01:57:19.134]  Not, not a big deal.
[01:57:19.134 --> 01:57:20.195]  As people know, that's not the article.
[01:57:20.195 --> 01:57:21.296]  I'll find it during the break.
[01:57:21.296 --> 01:57:23.818]  YouTube came out about three weeks ago to talk about this on Joe Rogan's podcast.
[01:57:23.818 --> 01:57:25.459]  He had the article up there.
[01:57:25.459 --> 01:57:31.324]  Um, and, and, and YouTube said, we, we may start banning channels if you have hateful comments.
[01:57:31.324 --> 01:57:32.585]  So that's the headline.
[01:57:32.585 --> 01:57:32.906]  YouTube.
[01:57:34.005 --> 01:57:38.672]  Made, banned channels or penalized channels that have hateful comments.
[01:57:38.672 --> 01:57:39.213]  Stay there, Millie.
[01:57:39.213 --> 01:57:42.798]  We're going to come back and talk about this in the third hour.
[01:57:42.798 --> 01:57:44.421]  Then I'm going to open the phones up.
[01:57:44.421 --> 01:57:45.843]  We've got a bunch of other reports as well.
[01:57:45.843 --> 01:57:46.224]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.912 --> 01:57:57.601]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-Western speech all across the world.
[01:57:57.601 --> 01:58:04.067]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed.
[01:58:04.067 --> 01:58:05.569]  Then they set the precedent.
[01:58:05.569 --> 01:58:09.712]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert,
[01:58:10.453 --> 01:58:11.915]  They take you off the internet.
[01:58:11.915 --> 01:58:22.727]  Now, Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[01:58:22.727 --> 01:58:24.930]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip
[01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:33.537]  of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist, anti-human, transhumanist, who literally think they own and run our lives.
[01:58:33.537 --> 01:58:42.285]  And if we keep bowing to these cults, the cancer that is San Francisco, and many of these big universities, is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[01:58:42.285 --> 01:58:45.809]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks!
[01:58:48.663 --> 01:58:56.489]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[01:58:56.489 --> 01:58:59.811]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:58:59.811 --> 01:59:02.913]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:59:02.913 --> 01:59:04.474]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:59:04.474 --> 01:59:11.039]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:59:11.039 --> 01:59:13.841]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been.
[01:59:14.895 --> 01:59:18.236]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[01:59:18.236 --> 01:59:21.157]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:59:21.157 --> 01:59:22.857]  That sends chills up my spine.
[01:59:22.857 --> 01:59:36.401]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:59:36.401 --> 01:59:38.342]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[01:59:38.982 --> 01:59:44.265]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[01:59:44.265 --> 01:59:50.749]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[01:59:50.749 --> 01:59:57.512]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:57.512 --> 02:00:06.898]  The West is the best.
[02:00:14.422 --> 02:00:27.772]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:00:27.772 --> 02:00:29.993]  Millie Weathers with us for another five minutes.
[02:00:29.993 --> 02:00:36.098]  And I want you to come back with us tomorrow and premiere your full report on this troll farm.
[02:00:36.963 --> 02:00:39.544]  Man, we're really glad you're doing this.
[02:00:39.544 --> 02:00:45.885]  Again, you and Caitlin Bennett, working as a team a lot, are just really on fire is the word.
[02:00:45.885 --> 02:00:48.826]  People always overuse on fire, but you guys really are on fire.
[02:00:48.826 --> 02:00:53.528]  And then everywhere, especially Caitlin goes, she's really famous now.
[02:00:53.528 --> 02:00:56.268]  The left particularly, she's polite and nice.
[02:00:56.268 --> 02:00:59.909]  Scream at her, hit her in the back of the head, throw things at her, more people got arrested.
[02:00:59.909 --> 02:01:04.350]  So people are like getting arrested every week for attacking her, people are getting arrested for attacking Owen.
[02:01:04.350 --> 02:01:06.031]  I mean, the left is just going insane.
[02:01:07.705 --> 02:01:14.328]  Oh yeah, I mean, they just can't handle people that want to question their little cult beliefs and mindsets.
[02:01:14.328 --> 02:01:19.991]  So if you're outside of that, and especially if they're in little groups, they will attack.
[02:01:19.991 --> 02:01:30.116]  And you know, as far as you were saying earlier, Alex, about how, you know, this is the women that are doing all this, and this is about, you know, women doing something better than men.
[02:01:30.116 --> 02:01:31.016]  It's not.
[02:01:31.016 --> 02:01:35.438]  Honestly, we have great men working with us and helping us.
[02:01:35.438 --> 02:01:36.659]  You know, Caitlin's
[02:01:37.279 --> 02:01:39.061]  You know, fiance is her camera guy.
[02:01:39.061 --> 02:01:40.902]  My husband is my camera guy.
[02:01:40.902 --> 02:01:45.606]  And these strong men of good character are, you know, pushing us and helping us.
[02:01:45.606 --> 02:01:50.790]  And they are behind the scenes and a big part of our operations and the work that we do.
[02:01:50.790 --> 02:02:01.078]  So we are a coordinated effort of men and women working together to destroy and dismantle the agenda that the globalists are trying to push.
[02:02:01.078 --> 02:02:02.059]  Oh, I totally agree with that.
[02:02:02.059 --> 02:02:04.060]  I'm trying to shame other men out there.
[02:02:05.361 --> 02:02:06.162]  To take action.
[02:02:06.162 --> 02:02:31.656]  I mean, I know all these business owners, all these veterans, all these people are all about, they can do 200 sit-ups, you know, in 30 seconds, or they can do 100 pull-ups, or they've got really big muscles, and they can shoot guns really good, and, you know, they're making a lot of money, and then they're just totally not involved in society and culture, as it's all coming down around us, and the left are like vicious piranhas attacking everything, and I'm just sick of all these, you know, guys that are too busy playing golf,
[02:02:32.236 --> 02:02:34.020]  Are too busy, you know, out on their boat.
[02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:38.129]  And I'm not saying don't play golf, don't go out on a boat, but they don't ever do anything.
[02:02:38.129 --> 02:02:40.814]  I mean, Texas is about to turn blue.
[02:02:42.110 --> 02:02:43.871]  Beto almost, you know, did that.
[02:02:43.871 --> 02:02:46.952]  He did get the young people out like idiots to vote for Democrats.
[02:02:46.952 --> 02:02:49.053]  He lost, but barely.
[02:02:49.053 --> 02:02:50.414]  Most of the courts got taken over.
[02:02:50.414 --> 02:02:53.355]  They won a bunch of seats in the statehouse.
[02:02:53.355 --> 02:02:56.436]  I mean, my beloved state of Texas is going to go the way of California.
[02:02:56.436 --> 02:02:58.517]  California used to be as conservative as Texas.
[02:02:58.517 --> 02:03:01.179]  People better get their heads out of their rear ends.
[02:03:01.179 --> 02:03:03.980]  And I'm telling the men of America, get up off your ass.
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:05.680]  Exactly.
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:16.404]  We need men and women going out there on the streets confronting these people that are pushing these ideas and calling them out, calling them to task, questioning them.
[02:03:16.404 --> 02:03:19.766]  We need people out there going and videotaping and doing these things.
[02:03:19.766 --> 02:03:23.267]  I mean, we have news articles of Beto saying, oh, I'm going to be in Cleveland.
[02:03:23.827 --> 02:03:25.209]  I shouldn't have been the only one there.
[02:03:25.209 --> 02:03:28.432]  There should have been other people with cameras going questioning that.
[02:03:28.432 --> 02:03:33.237]  No one was there the times I went to DC to confront the head of Google, Twitter, all while they lied.
[02:03:33.237 --> 02:03:34.298]  And we took over the media.
[02:03:34.298 --> 02:03:35.759]  We reached tens of millions of people.
[02:03:35.759 --> 02:03:38.622]  We had big victories because we got on a plane and we went there.
[02:03:38.622 --> 02:03:39.923]  You don't have to be Alex Jones.
[02:03:39.923 --> 02:03:40.584]  You were there.
[02:03:40.584 --> 02:03:40.964]  Or Millie.
[02:03:40.964 --> 02:03:41.665]  We were to do it.
[02:03:41.665 --> 02:03:43.207]  Just do it, people!
[02:03:44.486 --> 02:03:53.989]  You know, one of the reasons why I reached out to Caitlin and we essentially hired her to work for InfoWars was because she is self-motivated and self-driven.
[02:03:53.989 --> 02:03:56.850]  Her and her little team, they go out and they just do stuff.
[02:03:56.850 --> 02:04:02.032]  They were already going out and doing stuff, doing the groundwork, without anyone telling them to.
[02:04:02.032 --> 02:04:03.252]  They just did it.
[02:04:03.252 --> 02:04:05.773]  And we need more people out there to just do it.
[02:04:05.773 --> 02:04:11.575]  The cream will rise to the top and then, you know, we can reach out and be like, hey, come work for InfoWars.
[02:04:11.575 --> 02:04:12.815]  That's how this works.
[02:04:13.175 --> 02:04:15.718]  We need more motivated people doing this work.
[02:04:15.718 --> 02:04:20.443]  Well to be clear, I just want to be a place that fosters other folks to take action.
[02:04:20.443 --> 02:04:22.546]  I want to beat the globalists.
[02:04:22.546 --> 02:04:23.427]  I want to stop them.
[02:04:23.427 --> 02:04:24.748]  That's what I want.
[02:04:24.748 --> 02:04:27.652]  And so many other folks in media, it's about them being number one.
[02:04:28.152 --> 02:04:29.053]  And in competition.
[02:04:29.053 --> 02:04:31.775]  I'm in competition with nobody who wants liberty.
[02:04:31.775 --> 02:04:35.317]  I'm in competition with evil to bring it down and to stop it.
[02:04:35.317 --> 02:04:37.499]  And thanks for your great work and others, Millie.
[02:04:37.499 --> 02:04:38.600]  We're gonna do it together.
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:40.141]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[02:04:40.141 --> 02:04:43.183]  I'm gonna come back, hit a bunch of news, give the number out and more.
[02:04:43.183 --> 02:04:45.565]  Folks, whatever you do, spread the live feeds.
[02:04:45.565 --> 02:04:47.246]  Tell folks how you're watching and how you're listening.
[02:04:47.246 --> 02:04:50.969]  Whether it's on local radio stations, TV stations or on the internet.
[02:04:50.969 --> 02:04:52.310]  Just spread the word.
[02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.951]  Thank you, Millie.
[02:04:56.172 --> 02:04:58.674]  I've got some really good news, though.
[02:04:58.674 --> 02:05:00.055]  X2's back.
[02:05:00.055 --> 02:05:01.816]  The original X2.
[02:05:01.816 --> 02:05:04.719]  Deep-earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[02:05:04.719 --> 02:05:05.820]  What you want.
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:06.920]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:08.362]  It'll be here in a week.
[02:05:08.362 --> 02:05:09.923]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[02:05:09.923 --> 02:05:10.884]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:10.884 --> 02:05:12.685]  With the best iodine in the world.
[02:05:12.685 --> 02:05:13.826]  X2, it's available.
[02:05:13.826 --> 02:05:14.827]  I thought X3's great.
[02:05:14.827 --> 02:05:17.028]  We still got another deep-earth crystal source.
[02:05:17.028 --> 02:05:18.830]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:20.191]  The scientists that do that.
[02:05:20.191 --> 02:05:21.992]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[02:05:22.833 --> 02:05:27.196]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[02:05:27.196 --> 02:05:31.298]  We now have X2 again, and in fullmorestore.com, so hallelujah.
[02:05:31.298 --> 02:05:42.985]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[02:05:42.985 --> 02:05:51.590]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,
[02:05:52.617 --> 02:05:55.539]  Get yours today at MFORESTORE.COM or MFORESTLIFE.COM.
[02:05:55.539 --> 02:05:59.122]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:05:59.122 --> 02:06:01.664]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:21.112 --> 02:06:22.034]  We are back live.
[02:06:22.034 --> 02:06:24.097]  We're now into hour number three.
[02:06:24.097 --> 02:06:26.020]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:06:26.020 --> 02:06:30.126]  We're the most demonized, most lied about broadcast in the world for good reason.
[02:06:30.126 --> 02:06:33.612]  We know what we're talking about and we're rallying the troops.
[02:06:33.612 --> 02:06:34.754]  I want to open the phones up.
[02:06:37.568 --> 02:06:42.571]  I want to open the phones up next segment, so let me give you the number out on any issue, any topic, any item.
[02:06:42.571 --> 02:06:43.512]  You agree with me?
[02:06:43.512 --> 02:06:45.193]  You disagree with me?
[02:06:45.193 --> 02:06:46.634]  You want to talk about the censorship?
[02:06:46.634 --> 02:06:48.375]  You want to talk about Trump?
[02:06:48.375 --> 02:06:50.977]  You want to talk about what's happening in the economy?
[02:06:50.977 --> 02:06:55.520]  You want to talk about the left openly trying to plunge the nation into civil war?
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:59.982]  Whatever the subject is, I'd love to hear from you on this Tuesday Global Transmission.
[02:06:59.982 --> 02:07:00.323]  877-789-2539.
[02:07:00.323 --> 02:07:00.363]  877-789-2539.
[02:07:07.407 --> 02:07:09.788]  And again, I am Alex Jones, your host.
[02:07:09.788 --> 02:07:11.689]  Very, very honored to be here with you.
[02:07:11.689 --> 02:07:16.452]  And then after I take some calls, I'm going to get into these stories I haven't covered yet.
[02:07:16.452 --> 02:07:23.355]  Islamist's tyrant, Erdogan, threatens New Zealanders they'll return in coffins if they visit Turkey.
[02:07:23.355 --> 02:07:25.676]  So that's the loving, sweet Muslims he blames.
[02:07:25.676 --> 02:07:31.539]  All New Zealanders, Aussies, you name it, he says, we'll kill you.
[02:07:31.539 --> 02:07:34.261]  We'll put you in coffins.
[02:07:34.261 --> 02:07:36.362]  So don't go there and preach Christianity.
[02:07:37.403 --> 02:07:39.585]  Turkey used to be somewhat moderate, now it's hardcore.
[02:07:39.585 --> 02:07:43.307]  He has an Islamic State going.
[02:07:43.307 --> 02:07:45.909]  Don't go to Pakistan and tell people you're a Christian.
[02:07:45.909 --> 02:07:47.050]  Don't go to Saudi Arabia.
[02:07:47.050 --> 02:07:50.693]  Oh, if you're gay and go to Saudi Arabia, they'll kill your butt.
[02:07:50.693 --> 02:07:52.454]  But that's okay, gay people love it.
[02:07:52.454 --> 02:07:53.275]  Oh, you killed me!
[02:07:53.275 --> 02:07:55.736]  Oh, how nice!
[02:07:55.736 --> 02:08:00.640]  I mean, this is insanity.
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:02.441]  Yeah, we'll play that clip coming up.
[02:08:02.441 --> 02:08:03.102]  Because think about it.
[02:08:04.312 --> 02:08:07.133]  There's people in the House of Islam and those outside.
[02:08:07.133 --> 02:08:11.815]  And those outside the House of Islam is the House of War.
[02:08:11.815 --> 02:08:16.736]  There's no Muslim country in the world where Christian churches don't get blown up and people don't get killed.
[02:08:16.736 --> 02:08:17.556]  But don't worry!
[02:08:17.556 --> 02:08:27.880]  The Huffington Post, famously Soros-funded when it was launched, and this troll creature
[02:08:32.489 --> 02:08:48.273]  Came out and complained and tattled along with Media Matters of Jordan Soros and said... Jones posted an Islamophobic video where he said that Muslims attack Christians 100 to 1 and that they blow up our churches on Easter.
[02:08:48.273 --> 02:08:51.954]  I mean, every Easter, churches everywhere get blown up.
[02:08:51.954 --> 02:08:54.414]  And she says, this is a horrible fake news line.
[02:08:54.414 --> 02:08:56.015]  And YouTube said, yes!
[02:08:56.015 --> 02:08:57.435]  There's a channel, it wasn't even our channel.
[02:08:58.447 --> 02:09:04.549]  But we knew the folks who set it up, so we did talk to them occasionally on email.
[02:09:04.549 --> 02:09:05.249]  They banned it.
[02:09:05.249 --> 02:09:10.991]  The site had been around for four years, had 12 million views on it.
[02:09:10.991 --> 02:09:14.672]  But you aren't allowed to see that information.
[02:09:14.672 --> 02:09:19.534]  You aren't allowed to have access to that information.
[02:09:19.534 --> 02:09:25.716]  You have to be told what I said by Amy Russo.
[02:09:25.716 --> 02:09:26.456]  Oh, and I love it.
[02:09:28.923 --> 02:09:35.508]  Congressman Nunes, when they make death threats against him, they censor his response back.
[02:09:35.508 --> 02:09:36.409]  They do all this stuff.
[02:09:36.409 --> 02:09:37.290]  It's not free speech.
[02:09:37.290 --> 02:09:38.511]  It's calls of violence.
[02:09:38.511 --> 02:09:40.412]  It's organized crime.
[02:09:40.412 --> 02:09:41.813]  Twitter brigades against him.
[02:09:41.813 --> 02:09:44.455]  So he sued him for $250 million, along with some users.
[02:09:44.455 --> 02:09:48.659]  And you go to the users' sites on Twitter, they're all like, oh, you go, girl.
[02:09:50.652 --> 02:09:56.057]  Yeah, we're going to see you in court, buddy, you fascist censor trying to shut us up.
[02:09:56.057 --> 02:10:02.202]  These are the very people actually shutting all the conservatives and nationalists and libertarians down.
[02:10:02.202 --> 02:10:06.486]  The reason Nunes wants this is discovery.
[02:10:06.486 --> 02:10:14.473]  But the New York Times argues, well, Twitter has Section 230 immunity, but they violated that by saying they're a publisher.
[02:10:16.598 --> 02:10:18.399]  Why don't newspapers get immunity?
[02:10:18.399 --> 02:10:21.900]  I don't have Section 230, protecting everything I do.
[02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:25.181]  Why do they?
[02:10:25.181 --> 02:10:25.941]  Why do they?
[02:10:25.941 --> 02:10:28.282]  Because they say they're not publishers.
[02:10:28.282 --> 02:10:32.324]  Pull their Section 230.
[02:10:32.324 --> 02:10:37.226]  Instead, Trump is, in the noon-after deal, expanding Section 230.
[02:10:38.683 --> 02:10:40.884]  Now, obviously, it hadn't gone through Congress.
[02:10:40.884 --> 02:10:41.944]  Trump didn't write it.
[02:10:41.944 --> 02:10:44.445]  He thinks he's got some better trade deals in it, so he's for it.
[02:10:44.445 --> 02:10:45.646]  I get that.
[02:10:45.646 --> 02:10:52.909]  But you add that to Trump saying, well, you just have to get used to what's going on and you'll be better behaved than the left.
[02:10:52.909 --> 02:10:55.650]  Better behaved than the left?
[02:10:55.650 --> 02:11:01.112]  The left, working with big media and big tech, silences you and then lies about what you said.
[02:11:01.112 --> 02:11:02.593]  They had a whole NPR piece.
[02:11:03.604 --> 02:11:11.391]  And another Huffington Post article out saying Jones is currently saying no one died at Sandy Hook and sending people to their houses to harass them.
[02:11:11.391 --> 02:11:17.836]  All of it's out of context, never sitting by anybody's house, but there's the clear and present wolf at the door thing.
[02:11:17.836 --> 02:11:21.599]  So they're the ones publishing the thing they say is so evil to say nobody died.
[02:11:21.599 --> 02:11:27.304]  They're the ones constantly publishing it, and then saying I'm saying it, and then saying take me off the internet.
[02:11:27.304 --> 02:11:27.725]  Roku!
[02:11:28.567 --> 02:11:29.688]  Take him off!
[02:11:29.688 --> 02:11:32.049]  He's sending people to the houses right now!
[02:11:32.049 --> 02:11:34.410]  The children are in danger!
[02:11:34.410 --> 02:11:36.331]  All lies.
[02:11:36.331 --> 02:11:37.331]  All lies.
[02:11:37.331 --> 02:11:42.353]  And the left are a bunch of scum who have no morals, no anything.
[02:11:42.353 --> 02:11:48.196]  And they'll lie, they'll do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want.
[02:11:48.196 --> 02:11:49.757]  And now they're coming for your children.
[02:11:52.423 --> 02:11:58.369]  A whole bunch of sites that publish my Sunday show where I showed the unspeakable behavior.
[02:11:58.369 --> 02:12:05.095]  YouTube channels run by convicted murderers that started the club kid movement about having underage boys at gay clubs.
[02:12:05.095 --> 02:12:06.857]  Pedophilia.
[02:12:06.857 --> 02:12:08.598]  Who chopped his boyfriend up with a buzz saw.
[02:12:08.598 --> 02:12:11.321]  Or was it a hatchet?
[02:12:12.503 --> 02:12:18.047]  They're on there with this poor Desmond's Amazing, and in another video they say, well here, let's just pull it up and play it for you.
[02:12:18.047 --> 02:12:24.873]  He says, we're about to do some really bad stuff on camera, so bring your children close to the television.
[02:12:24.873 --> 02:12:36.622]  And then in Houston, a convicted child rapist is in there with no background check, in the schools, in the libraries, with the little school kids, sitting on his lap, and boy, they're taking that video down.
[02:12:36.622 --> 02:12:39.424]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[02:12:39.424 --> 02:12:39.985]  Doesn't matter.
[02:12:41.926 --> 02:12:47.310]  Not just me, but folks all over the country are finding out about these, quote, drag queen festivals.
[02:12:47.310 --> 02:12:49.951]  And I imagine the globalists might go pull a false flag on one or something.
[02:12:49.951 --> 02:12:50.912]  You know, that's how they operate.
[02:12:50.912 --> 02:12:56.255]  So, if you question grown men who are convicted rapists with your kids, well, then, you know, you're responsible for the terrible event.
[02:12:56.255 --> 02:13:02.960]  Now, we don't wish any violence upon these people, other than if they're found guilty of, say, murdering a child, that they get lethal injection.
[02:13:04.574 --> 02:13:14.416]  But the point is, is you can see what they're going to pull, because they're doing this antagonizing movement, putting adults with your kids, in many cases like Denver and other areas, not asking.
[02:13:14.416 --> 02:13:25.079]  And they just suddenly, your kid has drag queen story time or career day, and your five-year-old son or daughter is sitting on some dude's lap, a convicted rapist lap it.
[02:13:25.079 --> 02:13:26.879]  And if you don't like that, well, you're bad!
[02:13:26.879 --> 02:13:29.580]  Because it's love!
[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:33.141]  When a big old fat guy with a beard has your son bouncing on his knee.
[02:13:35.529 --> 02:13:37.734]  So let's go to a few of these clips.
[02:13:37.734 --> 02:13:38.336]  Here it is.
[02:13:38.336 --> 02:13:43.668]  Axe murderer and creep talk about subjecting children to obscene content.
[02:13:43.668 --> 02:13:43.968]  Here it is.
[02:13:46.687 --> 02:13:54.193]  And we have to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[02:13:54.193 --> 02:14:06.382]  What we're going to show you is going to leave an impression on them, and we hope the impression will be that they grow up, if they're 3 or 4 or 5 years old, to become 7 or 8 year old drag queens and ballers.
[02:14:11.001 --> 02:14:12.982]  And that's just the surface.
[02:14:12.982 --> 02:14:14.503]  So let's go ahead and play this clip.
[02:14:14.503 --> 02:14:17.566]  This is the first local newscast.
[02:14:17.566 --> 02:14:19.967]  Library debuts drag queen storyline.
[02:14:19.967 --> 02:14:25.351]  And notice, the reporters are all, you gotta get them while they're young.
[02:14:25.351 --> 02:14:26.732]  Ha ha ha!
[02:14:26.732 --> 02:14:28.233]  Yeah, the kids didn't really like it.
[02:14:28.233 --> 02:14:29.254]  They're recoiling.
[02:14:29.254 --> 02:14:31.315]  Doesn't matter, by the end they thought it was great.
[02:14:31.315 --> 02:14:32.336]  Ha ha ha!
[02:14:32.336 --> 02:14:33.417]  Yeah!
[02:14:33.417 --> 02:14:38.520]  It's like some nightmare of being in hell, where you've taken 14 hits of peyote.
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:38.901]  Here it is.
[02:14:40.325 --> 02:14:47.111]  The Heights Public Library today debuting a new children's story hour called Drag Queen Storytime.
[02:14:47.111 --> 02:14:51.816]  Stephanie Whitfield sat in on the program designed to promote acceptance.
[02:14:51.816 --> 02:14:54.398]  Good morning everybody!
[02:14:54.398 --> 02:14:58.182]  The Heights Library had a special guest for storytime.
[02:14:58.682 --> 02:14:59.682]  Oh my goodness.
[02:14:59.682 --> 02:15:01.063]  Everyone is dressed so nice.
[02:15:01.063 --> 02:15:03.484]  I wish I would have worn a nice costume for y'all.
[02:15:03.484 --> 02:15:07.485]  A visitor who usually performs for an older audience.
[02:15:07.485 --> 02:15:08.686]  My name is Blackberry.
[02:15:08.686 --> 02:15:11.287]  I'm a bearded drag queen.
[02:15:11.287 --> 02:15:16.389]  I'm a bearded drag queen that looks like a giant 400 pound goblin demon.
[02:15:16.389 --> 02:15:18.609]  The kids are like, here let's continue.
[02:15:18.609 --> 02:15:19.810]  Oh, the kids sit on the lap later.
[02:15:19.810 --> 02:15:20.030]  Here we go.
[02:15:21.374 --> 02:15:24.375]  That means I'm a lady with lots of facial hair.
[02:15:24.375 --> 02:15:25.775]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[02:15:25.775 --> 02:15:26.756]  Kid, pause.
[02:15:26.756 --> 02:15:27.076]  No.
[02:15:27.076 --> 02:15:27.436]  Back it up.
[02:15:27.436 --> 02:15:28.516]  Let's screw kids up.
[02:15:28.516 --> 02:15:31.797]  Let's screw kids up and say a man with a giant beard that weighs 400 pounds is a woman.
[02:15:31.797 --> 02:15:33.398]  Let's continue.
[02:15:33.398 --> 02:15:34.938]  Touch my hair?
[02:15:34.938 --> 02:15:35.418]  No.
[02:15:35.418 --> 02:15:38.919]  This program is geared towards kids 10 years old and younger.
[02:15:38.919 --> 02:15:44.161]  I just want to expose them to things they don't get to see every day and want it to become the more normal.
[02:15:44.161 --> 02:15:44.881]  Like an ISIS beheading?
[02:15:44.881 --> 02:15:45.441]  Yeah.
[02:15:45.441 --> 02:15:49.463]  They've never seen a drag queen before, so we thought it was a good chance to see one.
[02:15:49.463 --> 02:15:50.263]  Let's turn around.
[02:15:55.390 --> 02:15:56.611]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:15:56.611 --> 02:16:00.534]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:00.534 --> 02:16:02.075]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:02.075 --> 02:16:05.037]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:05.037 --> 02:16:10.241]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:16:10.581 --> 02:16:11.782]  I can help you too.
[02:16:11.782 --> 02:16:14.723]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:16:14.723 --> 02:16:16.944]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:16:16.944 --> 02:16:21.385]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.

[02:16:59.922 --> 02:17:04.985]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:17:04.985 --> 02:17:12.170]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:17:12.170 --> 02:17:16.713]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:17:17.313 --> 02:17:20.836]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:17:20.836 --> 02:17:24.058]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:17:24.058 --> 02:17:26.700]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:28.201]  Get sober now.

[02:17:56.454 --> 02:18:01.297]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:18:01.297 --> 02:18:10.764]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[02:18:10.764 --> 02:18:15.567]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[02:18:57.031 --> 02:19:06.698]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-Western speech all across the world.
[02:19:06.698 --> 02:19:13.183]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed.
[02:19:13.183 --> 02:19:14.684]  Then they set the precedent.
[02:19:14.684 --> 02:19:18.808]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert,
[02:19:19.548 --> 02:19:21.030]  They take you off the internet.
[02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:31.822]  Now, Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[02:19:31.822 --> 02:19:34.045]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip.
[02:19:34.665 --> 02:19:37.206]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:10.052 --> 02:20:11.213]  You found it.
[02:20:11.213 --> 02:20:13.235]  The tip of the spear.
[02:20:13.235 --> 02:20:17.478]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:17.478 --> 02:20:23.343]  I hear people talking right about the way we have to live here in this country.
[02:20:23.343 --> 02:20:26.145]  Merle Haggard's voice always makes me feel good.
[02:20:26.145 --> 02:20:30.769]  Harping on wars we fight and griping about the way things ought to be.
[02:20:33.359 --> 02:20:37.800]  The thing about Merle Haggard is I know people that actually knew him.
[02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:40.001]  Merle's a really nice fella.
[02:20:40.001 --> 02:20:42.862]  But if you mess with him, he splits your head open.
[02:20:42.862 --> 02:20:47.583]  So he isn't just somebody talking about walking on the fighting side.
[02:20:47.583 --> 02:20:49.404]  He'd walk on the fighting side.
[02:20:50.824 --> 02:20:59.808]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls right now.
[02:20:59.808 --> 02:21:01.288]  Trump's setting up a press conference.
[02:21:01.288 --> 02:21:03.149]  I may pop into some of that.
[02:21:03.149 --> 02:21:07.631]  We've got one of my favorite people, Will Johnson, hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:21:07.631 --> 02:21:09.831]  Paul Joseph Watson, I think, moved his hour.
[02:21:09.831 --> 02:21:12.492]  He's hosting tomorrow.
[02:21:12.492 --> 02:21:16.534]  And there's a lot of news here that's obviously very interesting and very important, but here's what you need to know.
[02:21:18.015 --> 02:21:21.257]  George Soros and the Globalists are breathing down my neck.
[02:21:21.257 --> 02:21:31.905]  They're all over the news just saying shut everything down, ban Alex Jones, misrepresenting what we've said and done.
[02:21:31.905 --> 02:21:38.650]  It's no secret I've been preparing a lawsuit against Media Matters and against individuals involved with Media Matters.
[02:21:38.650 --> 02:21:41.933]  We're just looking at jurisdictions and other things right now.
[02:21:41.933 --> 02:21:45.696]  It's not that I'm a litigious person, but this is about survival.
[02:21:45.696 --> 02:21:47.257]  I just can't let David Brock and
[02:21:50.782 --> 02:21:52.484]  George Soros breathed down my neck forever.
[02:21:52.484 --> 02:21:54.126]  And, you know, David versus Goliath.
[02:21:54.126 --> 02:22:00.334]  We may not be as big as Goliath, but we've got the forces with us, I think is the best way to say it.
[02:22:00.334 --> 02:22:04.360]  So, flood InfoWars with money.
[02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:05.681]  That's what stops them.
[02:22:05.681 --> 02:22:06.663]  That's what defeats them.
[02:22:07.904 --> 02:22:08.905]  You need toothpaste.
[02:22:08.905 --> 02:22:09.645]  We have the best.
[02:22:09.645 --> 02:22:11.086]  Concentrated.
[02:22:11.086 --> 02:22:13.227]  Fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified.
[02:22:13.227 --> 02:22:15.969]  50% off right now and free shipping.
[02:22:15.969 --> 02:22:18.951]  We have the best turmeric bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:22:18.951 --> 02:22:20.171]  You know what turmeric does.
[02:22:20.171 --> 02:22:21.052]  The average brand's 3-5%.
[02:22:21.052 --> 02:22:22.132]  Ours is 95%.
[02:22:22.132 --> 02:22:23.513]  It's insane.
[02:22:23.513 --> 02:22:25.534]  Nobody else has anything like it.
[02:22:25.534 --> 02:22:26.235]  Our fish oil.
[02:22:26.235 --> 02:22:27.456]  It's all about to sell out, by the way.
[02:22:27.456 --> 02:22:30.617]  It's the highest quality, best rated out there for adults and children.
[02:22:30.617 --> 02:22:33.299]  Three different types.
[02:22:33.299 --> 02:22:36.341]  Honor Roll, and then the ultimate fish oil, the ultimate krill oil.
[02:22:37.290 --> 02:22:38.671]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:22:38.671 --> 02:22:42.093]  And we've got more than 50 other great products.
[02:22:42.093 --> 02:22:48.576]  Now, the protein bars that are excellent and the TurboForce that's incredible, those are about to sell out.
[02:22:48.576 --> 02:22:51.518]  By that, if I keep them at 50% off, they'll sell out in like a week.
[02:22:51.518 --> 02:22:54.620]  It's months till more comes in, so I'm going to take them off sale by tomorrow.
[02:22:56.408 --> 02:22:59.729]  I said that yesterday, but it's going to be done today, actually, tonight.
[02:22:59.729 --> 02:23:03.290]  And then those will coast out for a few weeks, but they'll still be sold out for a while.
[02:23:03.290 --> 02:23:08.951]  X2, the particular oil company that was getting the Deep Earth Crystals at about 8,000 to 12,000 feet.
[02:23:08.951 --> 02:23:13.933]  7,000 to 12,000, but really they've been hitting it at about 10,000 feet.
[02:23:13.933 --> 02:23:15.293]  Pure Iodine.
[02:23:15.293 --> 02:23:22.715]  If you get it from the, it has to be all DEA approved, it's got to be held in a special lab, and then once it gets put into the
[02:23:24.389 --> 02:23:31.337]  Organic oil that isn't a controlled substance anymore, but it's just what it does for your body.
[02:23:31.337 --> 02:23:32.198]  It's just too insane.
[02:23:32.198 --> 02:23:35.502]  98% approval rating there with third-party reviews.
[02:23:35.502 --> 02:23:36.583]  8,000 plus reviews.
[02:23:36.583 --> 02:23:38.025]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:23:38.025 --> 02:23:39.146]  It's the original.
[02:23:39.146 --> 02:23:41.008]  It's here, the original manufacturer.
[02:23:41.008 --> 02:23:41.909]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:23:41.909 --> 02:23:42.430]  It's $19.98 right now.
[02:23:45.888 --> 02:23:48.328]  Unlike any other iodine on the planet, it's amazing.
[02:23:48.328 --> 02:23:49.449]  Something to stock up on.
[02:23:49.449 --> 02:23:53.869]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:23:53.869 --> 02:23:57.970]  And we do have a good amount of that, so we should be able to keep it throughout the month.
[02:23:57.970 --> 02:24:01.311]  But in about 10 or 11 days, we're gonna have to end this special.
[02:24:01.311 --> 02:24:03.511]  So thank you all for the support.
[02:24:03.511 --> 02:24:09.472]  Okay.
[02:24:09.472 --> 02:24:10.872]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:24:10.872 --> 02:24:11.492]  Let's do that.
[02:24:11.492 --> 02:24:14.893]  Man, it really freaks me out, though.
[02:24:17.335 --> 02:24:35.659]  That you put up videos of convicted pedophiles, convicted rapists of children, in government programs with your kids, in some cases without parents being told, and that's what YouTube takes you down instantly for, and it just lets you know these are some scary people.
[02:24:35.659 --> 02:24:43.181]  That just freaks me out, man, that this is their religion, but every ancient culture got taken over by people that were pedophiles.
[02:24:45.029 --> 02:24:47.891]  And the next best thing to killing them is raping them.
[02:24:47.891 --> 02:24:51.033]  What they really want to do is kill your kids.
[02:24:51.033 --> 02:24:52.214]  You're like, that sounds crazy.
[02:24:52.214 --> 02:24:53.775]  Yeah, because they're crazy people.
[02:24:53.775 --> 02:24:54.995]  But read a history book.
[02:24:54.995 --> 02:24:59.878]  This guy, I'm not saying he wants to kill them, he's just a convicted child rapist.
[02:24:59.878 --> 02:25:02.340]  Hello children, I'm here.
[02:25:02.340 --> 02:25:05.802]  A lot of TV viewers are having to see this.
[02:25:05.802 --> 02:25:09.865]  Radio listeners are a little bit lucky you don't have to see these things that we're documenting here.
[02:25:10.757 --> 02:25:18.043]  Okay, Paul, Arthur, Rebecca, Nikki, Tyler, Jefferson, Phillip, Greg, Marcus, Charlotte.
[02:25:18.043 --> 02:25:19.304]  We're going to all those calls.
[02:25:19.304 --> 02:25:21.225]  We've got to move quick.
[02:25:21.225 --> 02:25:23.867]  So let's go to Nikki.
[02:25:23.867 --> 02:25:25.448]  Nikki from New Jersey.
[02:25:25.448 --> 02:25:27.490]  Thank you, Nikki.
[02:25:27.490 --> 02:25:28.711]  How are you doing tonight?
[02:25:28.711 --> 02:25:30.873]  I'm good talking to you.
[02:25:30.873 --> 02:25:31.553]  Awesome.
[02:25:31.553 --> 02:25:34.936]  I wanted to call in because I remember going back a few months before
[02:25:35.734 --> 02:25:37.015]  Trump took over office.
[02:25:37.015 --> 02:25:41.237]  You were warning about our internet being taken over, and Obama is signing it over too.
[02:25:41.237 --> 02:25:42.678]  I believe it was the UN.
[02:25:42.678 --> 02:25:55.086]  And I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about that, because I'm so frustrated right now with this whole Pakistan law coming after Americans, because you can't possibly in any way, shape, or form even hint at criticizing Islam.
[02:25:55.086 --> 02:25:56.426]  So how do we get our country back?
[02:25:56.426 --> 02:26:00.429]  What can we as citizens do that we can get our power back?
[02:26:03.143 --> 02:26:19.735]  If you go back to three, four years ago when they were trying to hand the internet over from ICANN that we invented with DARPA to the UN and the EU, Soros was on record saying he wanted the UN to have full control to quote censor hate and quote push his news, which shows how powerful he is.
[02:26:19.735 --> 02:26:23.097]  And they've gone ahead with that because Trump isn't defending us.
[02:26:23.097 --> 02:26:24.018]  There it is.
[02:26:24.018 --> 02:26:28.982]  Leaked Soros document calls for regulating internet to favor open society supporters.
[02:26:29.935 --> 02:26:30.895]  And you can go read it!
[02:26:30.895 --> 02:26:32.996]  I mean, again, I don't make this up.
[02:26:32.996 --> 02:26:34.177]  And again, I said three years ago.
[02:26:34.177 --> 02:26:35.837]  There it is, three years ago.
[02:26:35.837 --> 02:26:36.198]  On screen.
[02:26:36.198 --> 02:26:36.838]  Exactly.
[02:26:36.838 --> 02:26:43.821]  So, so, it's so frustrating, and I don't know, what do you do when Trump is doing nothing to stop it?
[02:26:43.821 --> 02:26:48.203]  And I'm not trying to be mean to Trump, but my God!
[02:26:48.203 --> 02:26:49.303]  No, I'm with you on that.
[02:26:49.303 --> 02:26:51.304]  Like, I love Trump, but I'm totally with you on that.
[02:26:51.304 --> 02:26:53.845]  I'm tweeting like a madwoman every other minute to Trump, like, hey,
[02:26:54.335 --> 02:26:55.616]  Fox didn't get you elected.
[02:26:55.616 --> 02:26:57.637]  That was Alex Jones and him for worse.
[02:26:57.637 --> 02:27:02.240]  Well, it was our listeners, but the point is, he should do it because it's the right thing anyways.
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:13.867]  Here's a horrible analogy, but it'd be like if you were giving your wife a pedicure, and you got nine of her fingers all clean and painted and lovingly, and you said, baby, I sure love you, and just broke her last finger.
[02:27:13.867 --> 02:27:19.671]  It's like Trump's done all this good, and then he just breaks the last finger, and it's like, what is your deal, man?
[02:27:19.671 --> 02:27:21.312]  I mean, do you get my analogy?
[02:27:22.369 --> 02:27:23.069]  Totally!
[02:27:23.069 --> 02:27:23.630]  Absolutely!
[02:27:23.630 --> 02:27:25.731]  100% man!
[02:27:25.731 --> 02:27:26.491]  So what do we do?
[02:27:26.491 --> 02:27:27.392]  We light a fire under him.
[02:27:27.392 --> 02:27:32.834]  You know, the good news is he put some tweets out saying he's looking at investigating censorship and going after him.
[02:27:32.834 --> 02:27:33.455]  Good, man!
[02:27:33.455 --> 02:27:35.256]  Let's do it!
[02:27:35.256 --> 02:27:37.557]  And also, why can't we thank the source?
[02:27:37.557 --> 02:27:44.080]  Like, I don't get why the source was squeezing us from the top and the bottom.
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:44.781]  Absolutely!
[02:27:44.781 --> 02:27:48.282]  I mean, we've got to support alternative things like Gab.
[02:27:49.716 --> 02:27:57.504]  By the way, I've been wanting to get Robert Barnes on all day, and when I finally got on the phone earlier, I forgot to ask him, hey, come on the show and talk about Nunes' suit.
[02:27:57.504 --> 02:27:59.306]  But I promise to go to all your calls.
[02:28:10.379 --> 02:28:12.420]  And I want to air Paul Watson's report.
[02:28:12.420 --> 02:28:16.662]  But, yeah, let's get Barnes on, uh, last segment of this hour.
[02:28:16.662 --> 02:28:20.404]  I was going to air part of Paul's report, but people can go to InfoWars.com and see it.
[02:28:20.404 --> 02:28:27.948]  Uh, maybe we can get, um, last segment of the next hour, get, uh, Will Johnson to air Paul's report because it needs to be seen.
[02:28:27.948 --> 02:28:32.791]  It's particularly powerful about the New Zealand situation, but whatever you do, realize you're awake.
[02:28:32.791 --> 02:28:34.132]  You know what's going on.
[02:28:34.132 --> 02:28:35.773]  Other people don't.
[02:28:35.773 --> 02:28:36.373]  So remember,
[02:28:37.657 --> 02:28:40.200]  Patriots, Christians, Conservatives, Libertarians.
[02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:42.002]  You're not arrogant people like leftists.
[02:28:42.002 --> 02:28:43.043]  You gotta keep to yourself.
[02:28:43.043 --> 02:28:43.684]  I get it.
[02:28:43.684 --> 02:28:45.386]  I'm the same way when I'm not on air.
[02:28:45.386 --> 02:28:48.029]  That ain't gonna win the ballgame.
[02:28:48.029 --> 02:28:50.251]  You're gonna have to get out there and you're gonna have to get vocal.
[02:28:50.251 --> 02:28:51.352]  So let's do it.
[02:28:51.352 --> 02:28:53.194]  Roll up the sleeves and let's go.
[02:28:55.049 --> 02:28:57.390]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[02:28:57.390 --> 02:29:00.290]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[02:29:00.290 --> 02:29:05.352]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:29:05.352 --> 02:29:12.534]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.534 --> 02:29:17.095]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:29:17.694 --> 02:29:21.236]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:29:21.236 --> 02:29:24.457]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.457 --> 02:29:27.078]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:29:27.078 --> 02:29:28.579]  Get sober now.
[02:29:28.579 --> 02:29:31.920]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:32.720]  It's simple.
[02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:35.922]  Just call Elite Rehab Placement right now.
[02:29:35.922 --> 02:29:37.222]  Please, don't wait.
[02:29:37.222 --> 02:29:38.403]  Your life matters to us.
[02:29:38.643 --> 02:29:40.005]  800-213-9264 800-213-9264 800-213-9264 Call right now before it's too late.
[02:29:40.005 --> 02:29:40.045]  800-213-9264
[02:29:56.889 --> 02:30:06.579]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-Western speech all across the world.
[02:30:06.579 --> 02:30:13.046]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed.
[02:30:13.046 --> 02:30:14.547]  Then they set the precedent.
[02:30:14.547 --> 02:30:18.691]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert,
[02:30:19.412 --> 02:30:20.894]  They take you off the internet.
[02:30:20.894 --> 02:30:31.686]  Now, Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[02:30:31.686 --> 02:30:33.909]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip.
[02:30:34.369 --> 02:30:42.514]  of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist, anti-human, transhumanist, who literally think they own and run our lives.
[02:30:42.514 --> 02:30:51.260]  And if we keep bowing to these cults, the cancer that is San Francisco, and many of these big universities, is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[02:30:51.260 --> 02:30:56.424]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks!
[02:30:56.424 --> 02:30:59.486]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[02:30:59.486 --> 02:31:01.047]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[02:31:02.419 --> 02:31:05.365]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:31:05.365 --> 02:31:09.413]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply.
[02:31:10.990 --> 02:31:20.133]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[02:32:35.020 --> 02:32:37.061]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:08.413 --> 02:33:20.338]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:20.338 --> 02:33:25.161]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.161 --> 02:33:30.864]  Alright!
[02:33:32.168 --> 02:33:37.909]  A call just came in, long distance call from Samuel in Australia.
[02:33:37.909 --> 02:33:41.690]  Erdogan, the video's up on Infowars.com.
[02:33:41.690 --> 02:33:56.812]  Loving Muslim says you, you, you, Kiwis, you Aussies, New Zealand, or Australia will kill you and return you in coffins.
[02:33:56.812 --> 02:33:58.373]  So they see it as you're all bad.
[02:33:58.373 --> 02:33:59.833]  See, oh, they're not loving Muslims.
[02:34:00.987 --> 02:34:03.608]  They see what they would do to your church if they could.
[02:34:03.608 --> 02:34:05.068]  They're like, wow, you're doing what we do to you.
[02:34:05.068 --> 02:34:08.129]  Don't worry, we'll kill you more.
[02:34:08.129 --> 02:34:09.389]  So I don't like what the killer did.
[02:34:09.389 --> 02:34:10.069]  It's terrible.
[02:34:10.069 --> 02:34:14.371]  But see, nobody will humanize all the Christians being killed.
[02:34:14.371 --> 02:34:16.611]  Truly sickening.
[02:34:16.611 --> 02:34:19.772]  And the left is allied with these people.
[02:34:19.772 --> 02:34:25.894]  Not all Muslims are like that, but the leadership is because they can unify and fire up these groups to take over.
[02:34:25.894 --> 02:34:29.335]  There isn't any Muslim countries where they let Christians live in peace, folks.
[02:34:29.335 --> 02:34:29.975]  Doesn't exist.
[02:34:31.079 --> 02:34:33.845]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[02:34:33.845 --> 02:34:34.025]  Hello.
[02:34:43.257 --> 02:34:56.283]  I thought you'd want to know that the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was talking to the media yesterday about so-called hate speech and Facebook and I think they're starting to use our own arguments against us.
[02:34:56.283 --> 02:35:04.827]  So we've obviously been arguing that Facebook is a utility and it needs to treat us all equally.
[02:35:04.827 --> 02:35:08.629]  But what we're seeing here from Australia is that
[02:35:09.535 --> 02:35:14.922]  The government wants to treat Facebook as a utility that the government can regulate.
[02:35:14.922 --> 02:35:18.607]  And it can force it to ban anything the government thinks is hate speech.
[02:35:18.607 --> 02:35:26.917]  Oh yeah, that's the Democrat candidates are now calling a bunch of them for a news and internet czar who decides what's real and what isn't.
[02:35:26.917 --> 02:35:27.638]  Very dangerous.
[02:35:28.666 --> 02:35:34.449]  Yeah, and the Australian Prime Minister is writing to the UN about it.
[02:35:34.449 --> 02:35:38.171]  Apparently he's already written to the Japanese Prime Minister.
[02:35:38.171 --> 02:35:43.173]  Why the Japanese Prime Minister, I don't know, but it's clearly starting here.
[02:35:43.173 --> 02:35:54.359]  And we already have what I see as being trial cases here where the federal courts get cases from the
[02:35:57.732 --> 02:36:06.716]  The film industry, about websites that may or may not have pirated content on them, or might even just link to pirated content.
[02:36:06.716 --> 02:36:12.859]  The content doesn't have to be on that website, and the ISPs have to block it.
[02:36:12.859 --> 02:36:19.382]  So far only some of the ISPs are involved, but that's starting to grow as well.
[02:36:20.071 --> 02:36:28.033]  So I'm really concerned that this is going to become a global thing, and it's going to be a threat to you, it's going to be a threat to all of us.
[02:36:28.033 --> 02:36:36.995]  We saw New Zealand blocking Zero Hedge yesterday, and it just goes on and on.
[02:36:36.995 --> 02:36:38.095]  Well that's right.
[02:36:38.095 --> 02:36:44.437]  They had Media Matters come out and attack it, then they had groups listed as fake news, and then now Zero Hedge is being banned globally.
[02:36:44.437 --> 02:36:49.258]  This is global government, global corporations working with China and others, and now Andrew Yang
[02:36:50.526 --> 02:36:55.232]  He's coming out and saying he wants an internet czar over what's real and what's not.
[02:36:55.232 --> 02:36:57.134]  So incredibly dangerous.
[02:36:57.134 --> 02:36:59.396]  But that's because nationalism is exploding.
[02:36:59.396 --> 02:37:00.478]  They're losing.
[02:37:00.478 --> 02:37:06.124]  We've just got to hold the line of the average person just creates a website and starts putting out your own speech.
[02:37:06.124 --> 02:37:07.986]  They can't censor us all.
[02:37:07.986 --> 02:37:08.907]  The war is now.
[02:37:09.888 --> 02:37:12.470]  Samuel, what do you think the main target of this attack is?
[02:37:12.470 --> 02:37:17.213]  I mean, I believe the attack happened, but the guy said he wanted a race war like Charlie Manson.
[02:37:17.213 --> 02:37:18.894]  He said he's an eco-fascist.
[02:37:18.894 --> 02:37:20.755]  So I say, well that's a false flag.
[02:37:20.755 --> 02:37:24.837]  The Germans staged an attack against themselves to start World War II with Operation Himmler.
[02:37:24.837 --> 02:37:26.138]  Limbaugh says the same thing.
[02:37:26.138 --> 02:37:31.681]  They just banned more YouTube channels that post our material saying Jones is horrible.
[02:37:31.681 --> 02:37:34.723]  He says this guy might have had a motive for civil war.
[02:37:34.723 --> 02:37:36.284]  His manifesto said that.
[02:37:37.501 --> 02:37:48.825]  It did, and this is, I think, one of the risks we have with the widespread censoring of the manifesto, and to an extent the video as well, but more so the manifesto.
[02:37:49.631 --> 02:37:56.516]  is that people can't read this for themselves because it's been taken off so many websites.
[02:37:56.516 --> 02:37:59.958]  By the way, in the past, we got people's Hitler's Mein Kampf.
[02:37:59.958 --> 02:38:00.939]  That's sold at the store.
[02:38:00.939 --> 02:38:03.240]  We're not going to become Nazis because we read it.
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:06.543]  Or the Bruder film, Kennedy's head being blown off.
[02:38:06.543 --> 02:38:08.324]  You used to, you get to see this stuff.
[02:38:08.324 --> 02:38:10.545]  Why not now?
[02:38:10.545 --> 02:38:12.847]  Because it was in the face of their narrative.
[02:38:13.642 --> 02:38:31.990]  They want to cherry-pick little bits and pieces out of the manifesto and call anyone who doesn't agree with the entire manifesto being about those little cherry-picked pieces as being fake news or liars or whatever, and that's what they're doing now.
[02:38:31.990 --> 02:38:38.713]  Anyone who doesn't agree that this was a far-right nationalist, white nationalist, racist attack
[02:38:39.595 --> 02:38:49.259]  He's being called a liar, even though the manifesto quite clearly says he wants to start race wars, he wants to depopulate the planet.
[02:38:49.259 --> 02:38:51.239]  The mainstream media is lying to us.
[02:38:51.239 --> 02:38:52.680]  We shouldn't be surprised.
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:58.482]  Alex, if I can just quickly, InfoWarsStore.com, I want to thank you for Pollen Block.
[02:38:58.482 --> 02:39:01.303]  It's amazing.
[02:39:01.303 --> 02:39:08.466]  I've used so many different antihistamines over the years because I get really bad hay fever, and the antihistamines
[02:39:09.275 --> 02:39:13.819]  Sometimes work, sometimes don't, but they never quite work fully.
[02:39:13.819 --> 02:39:17.583]  They don't block all of the symptoms, they just kind of dry you up.
[02:39:17.583 --> 02:39:20.386]  At least that's what they do for me, if they work at all.
[02:39:20.386 --> 02:39:23.488]  But pollen block, it works.
[02:39:23.488 --> 02:39:24.890]  It stops everything.
[02:39:24.890 --> 02:39:29.234]  I don't get the itchy eyes, I'm not sneezing and I don't get the irritation.
[02:39:30.057 --> 02:39:31.238]  It is amazing.
[02:39:31.238 --> 02:39:35.379]  I think I've got some... I know I've got more pollen block in the car right now.
[02:39:35.379 --> 02:39:36.980]  I need to drop off in the office.
[02:39:36.980 --> 02:39:39.321]  So I keep some at home, some at work.
[02:39:39.321 --> 02:39:43.943]  Well, I know it's really expensive to get it shipped to Australia, so maybe we should get your name and number.
[02:39:43.943 --> 02:39:50.405]  So we're looking for distributors that want to get it pretty much at cost and then sell our products in Australia or create a variant.
[02:39:50.405 --> 02:39:52.846]  But this is a known patent out of France.
[02:39:52.846 --> 02:39:58.729]  You have to pay for the patent, where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail,
[02:39:59.589 --> 02:40:00.890]  And then you get their eggs.
[02:40:00.890 --> 02:40:05.091]  It creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[02:40:05.091 --> 02:40:09.793]  And so I'm always forgetting that it works better than clarinin for me and so many other things.
[02:40:09.793 --> 02:40:12.755]  Pollen Block has a whole bunch of five-star reviews.
[02:40:12.755 --> 02:40:14.395]  Pollen Block really is amazing.
[02:40:14.395 --> 02:40:18.877]  How fast did it take for Pollen Block to kick in for you?
[02:40:18.877 --> 02:40:21.118]  Yeah, it's pretty much straight away.
[02:40:21.118 --> 02:40:26.120]  You know, it may be 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
[02:40:26.120 --> 02:40:27.641]  It just works.
[02:40:29.555 --> 02:40:42.746]  The antihistamines, the pharmaceutical products, I find that with those, I can't take them until I start getting symptoms and even then, they might not kick in for half an hour or they might not kick in at all depending on the day.
[02:40:42.746 --> 02:40:45.428]  Pollen block works every single time.
[02:40:45.862 --> 02:41:08.464]  Well, that's the great part about this, and people and staff have told me, this is so good, you should make ads about it, you should talk about it, and I just, it's a blind spot, I haven't, but for whatever reason, France discovered it like 50 years ago, and it's still got to be even in this region of France, it's very complex, they don't even know why, but they think it's the pollen in the area, the dust, what the quail are eating, then they just produce in the eggs
[02:41:09.225 --> 02:41:14.868]  Whatever this essence is that just turns the histamine response off.
[02:41:14.868 --> 02:41:23.232]  So yes, in fact, if it's okay with you, I'll take this and put this out as an ad for folks and they can experience Pollen Block for themselves.
[02:41:23.232 --> 02:41:25.313]  So thank you so much for the call, Samuel.
[02:41:25.313 --> 02:41:27.014]  God bless you.
[02:41:27.014 --> 02:41:30.155]  All right, another call from Australia.
[02:41:30.155 --> 02:41:31.796]  All right, I'm gonna be as best I can.
[02:41:31.796 --> 02:41:35.638]  So I wasn't gonna hear Paul's report, but I'm gonna come back and take calls this segment.
[02:41:37.028 --> 02:41:37.588]  I love calls.
[02:41:37.588 --> 02:41:38.548]  We're getting back into calls.
[02:41:38.548 --> 02:41:39.489]  I'm going to take more calls.
[02:41:39.489 --> 02:41:40.349]  Calls are awesome.
[02:41:40.349 --> 02:41:42.669]  And then Will Johnson is coming up.
[02:41:42.669 --> 02:41:45.390]  When we come back, I got to move quick because I want to get to everybody.
[02:41:45.390 --> 02:41:48.710]  We're going to go to... Who's up next here who's been holding the longest?
[02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:50.331]  That'd be Charlotte, Illinois.
[02:41:50.331 --> 02:41:54.652]  And then Phillip in Indiana.
[02:41:54.652 --> 02:41:57.812]  And then that'll be Arthur in Delaware and Paul and a bunch of people.
[02:41:57.812 --> 02:41:59.513]  But I'm going to bam, bam, bam.
[02:41:59.513 --> 02:42:01.413]  Again, I go to your calls because the calls are so good.
[02:42:01.413 --> 02:42:02.853]  I end up spending five, ten minutes with each caller.
[02:42:02.853 --> 02:42:05.594]  We'll do it on the other side, but yes.
[02:42:05.594 --> 02:42:06.194]  Pollen Block.
[02:42:08.038 --> 02:42:09.179]  Okay, I'm just gonna tell you what I do.
[02:42:09.179 --> 02:42:14.441]  I go out and I do market research and I say, what are the best-selling products in the world?
[02:42:14.441 --> 02:42:16.922]  And what have the best reviews in the world?
[02:42:16.922 --> 02:42:26.006]  And then what do people in America not know that in Japan or in Europe or in Russia or in Africa or in Latin America is already a bestseller?
[02:42:26.006 --> 02:42:28.127]  Because a lot of stuff never gets here for some reason.
[02:42:28.127 --> 02:42:34.430]  And in Europe and in Russia and in Canada, there are a lot of brands of this stuff with the quail eggs.
[02:42:36.016 --> 02:42:36.978]  It's not here.
[02:42:36.978 --> 02:42:41.083]  So we just made a souped up version of it, discounted it, and it's Palm Block.
[02:42:41.083 --> 02:42:42.826]  And it works really good.
[02:42:42.826 --> 02:42:47.012]  But see, that's how we reverse engineer stuff.
[02:42:47.012 --> 02:42:50.296]  I copied an Amazon ad one time and it like doubled our sales.
[02:42:50.296 --> 02:42:51.798]  They did all the market research, I just...
[02:42:55.266 --> 02:43:03.650]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.650 --> 02:43:05.110]  Believe me, I know.
[02:43:05.110 --> 02:43:09.813]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:09.813 --> 02:43:12.874]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[02:43:13.374 --> 02:43:15.055]  I still have that energy.
[02:43:15.055 --> 02:43:35.183]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:43:35.703 --> 02:43:39.467]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[02:45:05.532 --> 02:45:14.535]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:45:14.535 --> 02:45:24.617]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:45:24.617 --> 02:45:33.140]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:45:33.980 --> 02:45:35.321]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:45:35.321 --> 02:45:36.481]  You must experience it.
[02:45:36.481 --> 02:45:38.462]  It is a total game-changer.
[02:45:38.462 --> 02:45:43.484]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:45:43.484 --> 02:45:45.004]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:45:45.004 --> 02:45:46.485]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:45:46.485 --> 02:45:53.167]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:45:53.167 --> 02:45:56.048]  TurboForce at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:45:56.048 --> 02:46:02.671]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[02:46:03.767 --> 02:46:07.548]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[02:46:07.548 --> 02:46:16.231]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:46:16.231 --> 02:46:20.832]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:46:20.832 --> 02:46:22.293]  You are the info war.
[02:46:22.293 --> 02:46:25.814]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:46:26.494 --> 02:46:37.877]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.

[02:46:45.859 --> 02:46:52.901]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:46:52.901 --> 02:46:55.642]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[02:46:59.204 --> 02:47:10.749]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:10.749 --> 02:47:18.572]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:23.260 --> 02:47:48.792]  Poets tell how Poncho fell And left his living in a cheap hotel The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold So the story ends, we're told Poncho needs your prayers, it's true Save a few, but left it too He only did what he had to do
[02:47:53.128 --> 02:48:06.055]  Alright, listening to the Alex Jones Show, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:48:06.055 --> 02:48:11.638]  The Dreaded Info Wars broadcast is live in defiance to their tyranny.
[02:48:11.638 --> 02:48:15.940]  Rebecca in California, you're on the air, welcome, thanks for holding.
[02:48:15.940 --> 02:48:16.661]  Hello?
[02:48:16.661 --> 02:48:18.041]  Hi.
[02:48:18.041 --> 02:48:19.662]  Alex, how are you?
[02:48:19.662 --> 02:48:21.043]  I'm doing pretty good here, welcome.
[02:48:22.279 --> 02:48:26.503]  Oh my gosh, thank you so much for giving us a plug.
[02:48:26.503 --> 02:48:27.844]  I appreciate you calling, go ahead.
[02:48:27.844 --> 02:48:33.508]  Okay, I wanted to talk to you about the abortion issue.
[02:48:33.508 --> 02:48:34.849]  Yes.
[02:48:34.849 --> 02:48:44.437]  Okay, I think it was great that the lady you had on discussing, you know, on a Saturday, February the 23rd,
[02:48:46.038 --> 02:48:51.241]  You know, wear black, don't go shopping, close your business, and all that.
[02:48:51.241 --> 02:48:51.501]  Yes.
[02:48:51.501 --> 02:48:55.303]  But I think we need to make a much bigger impression.
[02:48:55.303 --> 02:48:56.744]  Okay?
[02:48:56.744 --> 02:48:58.745]  Oh, I think it would have been great if that had been bigger.
[02:48:58.745 --> 02:49:01.127]  Yes, we're just all trying as hard as we can.
[02:49:01.127 --> 02:49:06.730]  Well, I've got an idea, and I think every community should start doing this.
[02:49:06.730 --> 02:49:08.011]  Across the nation.
[02:49:08.011 --> 02:49:10.492]  Okay?
[02:49:10.492 --> 02:49:13.974]  I think everyone needs to agree in like a small community.
[02:49:13.974 --> 02:49:15.235]  I live in Santa Clarita.
[02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:21.382]  And there are many elementary schools and junior highs and high schools.
[02:49:21.382 --> 02:49:32.765]  If the Christians and the people that are against abortion and believe abortion is murder, they need to pull their kids out of school.
[02:49:32.765 --> 02:49:33.866]  Elementary, junior high, high school.
[02:49:33.866 --> 02:49:36.147]  No, I agree, because they all get money off your kids being there.
[02:49:36.147 --> 02:49:38.107]  Exactly.
[02:49:38.107 --> 02:49:39.828]  Exactly, that's a great idea.
[02:49:39.828 --> 02:49:40.488]  It's a boycott.
[02:49:41.906 --> 02:49:43.493]  Well, see, that's the thing.
[02:49:43.493 --> 02:49:46.427]  People need to...it needs to be grassroots.
[02:49:47.634 --> 02:49:52.095]  I've been talking to, you know, pastors and... No, it's a great idea.
[02:49:52.095 --> 02:49:53.315]  So let's pick a date.
[02:49:53.315 --> 02:49:56.336]  Pick a date that's maybe two days to get their attention.
[02:49:56.336 --> 02:49:58.556]  Because sometimes parents gotta work a certain day.
[02:49:58.556 --> 02:50:02.237]  So let's say it's two or three days, or let's say a week.
[02:50:02.237 --> 02:50:11.539]  A week where as much as you can, take off work, take your child to the zoo, or go to a movie, or go for a hike, or take them to a museum, or go to church, whatever.
[02:50:11.539 --> 02:50:12.359]  Let's pick a week.
[02:50:13.805 --> 02:50:15.332]  And come up with a name and call for this.
[02:50:15.332 --> 02:50:18.306]  You know, so let's pick up... Wouldn't that be awesome?
[02:50:19.286 --> 02:50:20.107]  It's a great idea.
[02:50:20.107 --> 02:50:28.872]  So why don't we pick something like the last school week of April coming up and saying it's a protest against abortion and saying children are children.
[02:50:28.872 --> 02:50:30.533]  You shouldn't kill them after they're born.
[02:50:30.533 --> 02:50:32.654]  Shouldn't kill them before they're born.
[02:50:32.654 --> 02:50:37.317]  And so to point out that our children belong to the parents and that the parents had the children.
[02:50:37.317 --> 02:50:39.218]  The state doesn't own the children.
[02:50:39.218 --> 02:50:46.743]  That parents boycott the schools and all these corrupt systems in the last week of April.
[02:50:46.743 --> 02:50:48.324]  I'll try to come up with a name for it.
[02:50:49.204 --> 02:50:51.566]  Can you imagine what it would be like?
[02:50:51.566 --> 02:50:52.366]  I think it'd be great.
[02:50:52.366 --> 02:50:55.348]  Why don't you email us at ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[02:50:55.348 --> 02:50:58.390]  Not just you, but everybody with names of this or what you'd call it.
[02:50:58.390 --> 02:50:59.131]  Thank you, Rebecca.
[02:50:59.131 --> 02:51:03.774]  I could talk to you for hours, but I've got to get to everybody else here, which is my big frustration.
[02:51:03.774 --> 02:51:05.315]  Phillip in Indiana, you're on the air.
[02:51:05.315 --> 02:51:07.797]  Thanks for holding.
[02:51:07.797 --> 02:51:08.937]  Yeah.
[02:51:08.937 --> 02:51:11.179]  Sir, welcome.
[02:51:11.179 --> 02:51:15.822]  Well, the thing I was getting at is you always talk about tithing.
[02:51:16.753 --> 02:51:25.075]  And the scripture I thought it gives is the scripture on it is that it says to bring the full tithe into the storehouse so that there's meat in the storehouse.
[02:51:25.075 --> 02:51:29.796]  And that's what I say about InfoWars, is every single time I've been there, there's been meat.
[02:51:29.796 --> 02:51:36.278]  There's been substantial things to having an understanding of our world and our society.
[02:51:36.278 --> 02:51:44.300]  And that's why I say people should tithe to your organization and anybody that's affiliated with it, meaning radio stations and like that.
[02:51:46.159 --> 02:51:54.162]  And the other thing was is that in tithing also, give yourself an opportunity to do a little giving.
[02:51:54.162 --> 02:51:58.364]  It says that if you want to get God lending back to you and paying back to you,
[02:51:58.894 --> 02:51:59.655]  Give to the poor.
[02:51:59.655 --> 02:52:04.779]  So in the local area, to your homeless shelters or something like that, give out some of the InfoWars products.
[02:52:04.779 --> 02:52:06.761]  Sir, I totally agree.
[02:52:06.761 --> 02:52:08.483]  Give out InfoWars products.
[02:52:08.483 --> 02:52:14.468]  And I've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars funding groups surveilling pedophiles and actually getting a lot of them busted.
[02:52:14.468 --> 02:52:20.373]  In some of the cases, they don't want me to talk about it on air because it's ongoing investigations, even though arrests have been made.
[02:52:20.373 --> 02:52:22.335]  But I'm not playing games.
[02:52:22.335 --> 02:52:23.896]  And so people need to know.
[02:52:24.967 --> 02:52:27.669]  You buy products here, you are funding the tip of the spear.
[02:52:27.669 --> 02:52:30.831]  We're not playing games, we're committed, we're not backing down.
[02:52:30.831 --> 02:52:41.759]  Rob Deuce said Sunday to me, he said, you post this Millie Weaver report, you play these reports of these convicted murderers and pedophiles saying your kids belong to us, YouTube's gonna ban us.
[02:52:41.759 --> 02:52:42.640]  And I said, let's do it.
[02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:44.021]  He said, I agree, let's do it.
[02:52:44.021 --> 02:52:45.862]  So we cannot back down.
[02:52:45.862 --> 02:52:49.745]  We're not, people have to understand, we can't do it.
[02:52:49.745 --> 02:52:51.687]  We're physically unable to.
[02:52:52.387 --> 02:52:58.470]  Okay, so people cannot put their money in a better place, plus you get great products back.
[02:52:58.470 --> 02:53:00.371]  Everything with me is a 360 win.
[02:53:00.371 --> 02:53:05.814]  So yes, people should tithe to InfoWars.com by getting the products there.
[02:53:05.814 --> 02:53:06.855]  And I agree, giving
[02:53:07.375 --> 02:53:17.521]  The high quality products, like the toothpaste and things, to homeless, so that it's a total, beyond 360 win, a blessed win, a super win, a next level win.
[02:53:17.521 --> 02:53:23.205]  I don't know what you call that, because you fund the info war, you fund free speech, you stand up for the unborn, you stand up against pedophiles.
[02:53:24.509 --> 02:53:27.130]  You stand up for Americana and for religious freedoms.
[02:53:27.130 --> 02:53:28.090]  You get great toothpaste.
[02:53:28.090 --> 02:53:29.350]  It's good for your body.
[02:53:29.350 --> 02:53:33.171]  And then you give it to homeless and help them.
[02:53:33.171 --> 02:53:34.611]  It even goes to another level.
[02:53:34.611 --> 02:53:36.192]  I don't even know what you call that.
[02:53:36.192 --> 02:53:37.332]  Great point, Phillips.
[02:53:37.332 --> 02:53:39.753]  God bless you.
[02:53:39.753 --> 02:53:42.733]  I've got loaded phone lines here.
[02:53:42.733 --> 02:53:45.014]  And again, that's the Catch-22 with 20 phone lines.
[02:53:46.900 --> 02:53:47.240]  Or more.
[02:53:47.240 --> 02:53:49.101]  I just have 20 on the board.
[02:53:49.101 --> 02:53:54.003]  Is that I can take a bunch of calls, but by the time I get to a lot, I can't get to everybody, then I always feel bad trying to go to everybody here.
[02:53:54.003 --> 02:53:57.364]  But I'll get to as many as I can here, because I don't want to cut in on Will Johnson.
[02:53:57.364 --> 02:54:01.446]  He's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:54:01.446 --> 02:54:06.327]  Let's talk to Paul in Las Vegas.
[02:54:06.327 --> 02:54:07.248]  Go ahead, Paul, you're on the air.
[02:54:08.362 --> 02:54:09.262]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:54:09.262 --> 02:54:10.563]  Good, brother.
[02:54:10.563 --> 02:54:13.004]  I'll make mine real quick so you can get other colors in.
[02:54:13.004 --> 02:54:14.925]  Can you share my son's video?
[02:54:14.925 --> 02:54:17.686]  He made it for you about your protein bars.
[02:54:17.686 --> 02:54:20.947]  Owen Schwerer shared it the other day and it went viral on Twitter.
[02:54:20.947 --> 02:54:23.368]  It's just my little boy talking about your protein bars.
[02:54:23.368 --> 02:54:24.488]  If you'll do that for me.
[02:54:24.488 --> 02:54:26.129]  Sir, I would love to share it.
[02:54:26.129 --> 02:54:27.089]  I haven't seen it yet.
[02:54:27.089 --> 02:54:27.610]  What's it called?
[02:54:29.065 --> 02:54:30.948]  Um, it's not really got a name or anything.
[02:54:30.948 --> 02:54:32.369]  Um, he just retweeted whatever.
[02:54:32.369 --> 02:54:37.335]  It's about 20 seconds long and I think you'll get a laugh out of it if you get a chance to watch it.
[02:54:37.335 --> 02:54:38.417]  Sir, don't ask me.
[02:54:38.417 --> 02:54:39.478]  I want to thank you.
[02:54:39.478 --> 02:54:41.420]  Thank you for, thank your son.
[02:54:41.420 --> 02:54:44.083]  Uh, what's the Twitter account where we find it?
[02:54:44.083 --> 02:54:46.026]  Um, um, I don't actually know that.
[02:54:46.026 --> 02:54:47.167]  It's Paul at 079.
[02:54:49.745 --> 02:54:54.130]  Okay, well, I'm sure Owen will tell me, or one of the producers, and I'll play it tomorrow.
[02:54:54.130 --> 02:54:55.292]  Remind me to play it.
[02:54:55.292 --> 02:54:55.952]  Thank you.
[02:54:55.952 --> 02:54:56.513]  Thank you, Paul.
[02:54:56.513 --> 02:54:56.994]  You're awesome.
[02:54:56.994 --> 02:54:58.555]  Tell your son I said hi.
[02:54:58.555 --> 02:55:00.117]  Okay, I'll take another call here.
[02:55:00.117 --> 02:55:03.461]  Arthur in Delaware.
[02:55:03.461 --> 02:55:03.962]  You're on the air.
[02:55:03.962 --> 02:55:05.523]  Go ahead.
[02:55:05.523 --> 02:55:07.566]  Hey, Alex, my friend.
[02:55:07.566 --> 02:55:08.507]  How are you, sir?
[02:55:08.507 --> 02:55:09.248]  I'm doing alright, brother.
[02:55:10.430 --> 02:55:11.170]  Alright, brother.
[02:55:11.170 --> 02:55:16.232]  Listen, I want to let you know I'm a little older than you, but I've been following you for a long time.
[02:55:16.232 --> 02:55:19.672]  I've been following you for 10 years, and don't say much.
[02:55:19.672 --> 02:55:20.593]  Don't post much.
[02:55:20.593 --> 02:55:22.953]  I don't have any comments out there on the internet.
[02:55:22.953 --> 02:55:23.934]  You know, I follow you.
[02:55:23.934 --> 02:55:25.554]  I follow InfoWars.
[02:55:25.554 --> 02:55:29.095]  I follow Zero H. I follow The Gateway Pundit.
[02:55:29.095 --> 02:55:33.456]  You know, what I wanted to talk to you about today is a couple things.
[02:55:33.456 --> 02:55:36.657]  First of all, you know, most of these idiots on the left
[02:55:37.375 --> 02:55:45.738]  They listen just to the mainstream news, the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Washington Post, New York Times, etc.
[02:55:45.738 --> 02:55:47.638]  They only get one perspective.
[02:55:47.638 --> 02:55:50.159]  Well, they also think they're part of the power structure.
[02:55:50.159 --> 02:55:53.280]  They think they're part of the elite.
[02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:53.520]  Right.
[02:55:54.804 --> 02:55:55.565]  Right.
[02:55:55.565 --> 02:55:58.929]  Well, anyway, because I know you have other calls and everything.
[02:55:58.929 --> 02:56:00.210]  No, no, I want to hear from you.
[02:56:00.210 --> 02:56:01.271]  Tell me, tell me.
[02:56:01.271 --> 02:56:11.082]  Yeah, I'm looking at the news today, and I see that Wienermobile boy, Paul Ryan, is accepted to the board of directors of Fox News.
[02:56:11.082 --> 02:56:14.126]  And then they hire none other than Donna Brazile.
[02:56:14.786 --> 02:56:20.189]  I wanted to get your take on that, you know, because they're becoming CNN Lite or whatever you want to call it.
[02:56:20.189 --> 02:56:26.512]  Oh, I can tell you, most of the employees of Fox are rabid, hardcore leftists, like Shep Smith.
[02:56:26.512 --> 02:56:29.234]  There's only a few good people left at Fox.
[02:56:29.234 --> 02:56:31.215]  They're planning to move on Trump later.
[02:56:31.215 --> 02:56:35.357]  Trump isn't even aware of it and doesn't know, and is on his own planet half the time.
[02:56:35.357 --> 02:56:37.658]  I don't mean that in a mean way, it's just true.
[02:56:37.658 --> 02:56:41.440]  He's just busy out, you know, trying to get jobs or whatever, but if you don't have free speech, what's that matter?
[02:56:43.047 --> 02:56:47.989]  And so, yeah, no, Fox is... They call Sean Hannity in and bitch him out.
[02:56:47.989 --> 02:56:51.510]  They call Tucker Carlson in and chew him out.
[02:56:51.510 --> 02:56:53.030]  I mean, look at the judge.
[02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:55.071]  They're trying to remove off air.
[02:56:55.071 --> 02:56:57.032]  Look at Laura Ingraham, lost her radio show.
[02:56:57.032 --> 02:57:02.473]  This country and free speech is under siege.
[02:57:02.473 --> 02:57:03.774]  So, one other question.
[02:57:03.774 --> 02:57:06.195]  What do you think of this TikTok stuff with Hannity?
[02:57:06.195 --> 02:57:07.395]  Is there anything to it?
[02:57:07.395 --> 02:57:08.936]  I mean, you know, we're listening to it for years.
[02:57:08.936 --> 02:57:10.036]  It's like a broken record.
[02:57:11.223 --> 02:57:15.764]  Well, I mean, I think Hannity lays out the globalist criminal operation, does a great job.
[02:57:15.764 --> 02:57:17.025]  I don't have time to watch him a lot.
[02:57:17.025 --> 02:57:18.325]  When I do, he seems to be dead on.
[02:57:18.325 --> 02:57:19.866]  What do you mean, TikTok?
[02:57:19.866 --> 02:57:20.306]  I'm sorry.
[02:57:20.306 --> 02:57:26.728]  He's TikTok-ing about these upcoming, you know, indictments, et cetera, of the deep state.
[02:57:26.728 --> 02:57:30.629]  And, you know, we're holding our breath, you know.
[02:57:30.629 --> 02:57:32.169]  I mean, that's what needs to happen.
[02:57:32.169 --> 02:57:34.870]  There are grand juries open on McCabe and people.
[02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:38.096]  So, uh, you know, people like to hear hope.
[02:57:38.096 --> 02:57:39.479]  I don't know if it's true.
[02:57:39.479 --> 02:57:40.622]  Hey, 4th Hour's coming up.
[02:57:40.622 --> 02:57:43.769]  I'm sorry to the other callers, but if you call me back tomorrow, it'll be front of the line.
[02:57:45.868 --> 02:57:55.537]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-Western speech all across the world.
[02:57:55.537 --> 02:58:02.022]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed.
[02:58:02.022 --> 02:58:03.504]  Then they set the precedent.
[02:58:03.504 --> 02:58:07.647]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert,
[02:58:08.388 --> 02:58:09.850]  They take you off the internet.
[02:58:09.850 --> 02:58:20.662]  Now Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[02:58:20.662 --> 02:58:22.865]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip
[02:58:23.325 --> 02:58:31.486]  of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist, anti-human, transhumanist, who literally think they own and run our lives.
[02:58:31.486 --> 02:58:40.208]  And if we keep bowing to these cults, the cancer that is San Francisco, and many of these big universities, is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[02:58:40.208 --> 02:58:46.569]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks!
[02:58:46.569 --> 02:58:49.630]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[02:58:49.630 --> 02:58:51.190]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[02:58:52.592 --> 02:58:55.514]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:58:55.514 --> 02:58:59.556]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply.
[02:59:01.147 --> 02:59:10.293]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:59:10.293 --> 02:59:15.656]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[02:59:15.656 --> 02:59:17.918]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[02:59:17.918 --> 02:59:21.420]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[02:59:21.420 --> 02:59:22.921]  They've got special diet foods.
[02:59:22.921 --> 02:59:26.904]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[02:59:26.904 --> 02:59:29.125]  They've got so many great products there.
[02:59:29.125 --> 02:59:30.206]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[02:59:30.666 --> 02:59:32.648]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[02:59:32.648 --> 02:59:35.170]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[02:59:35.170 --> 02:59:40.175]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[02:59:40.175 --> 02:59:49.223]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods, powered by my Patriot Supply.
[02:59:49.223 --> 02:59:51.865]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:01:19.128 --> 03:01:20.650]  Liberals now are all over the news.
[03:01:20.650 --> 03:01:26.175]  They're the newest, biggest group buying guns, saying, I'm preparing for civil war with the right-wingers.
[03:01:26.175 --> 03:01:28.717]  Thank God you just joined us and didn't know it.
[03:01:28.717 --> 03:01:31.239]  The Second Amendment is for a tyrannous government.
[03:01:31.239 --> 03:01:38.426]  The sleeping giant that is humanity is rising!
[03:01:47.534 --> 03:01:50.135]  You won't stand up against tyranny, you'll only be a slave.
[03:01:50.135 --> 03:01:54.997]  If you're sad and lonely, they will push you around and make you their slave.
[03:01:54.997 --> 03:01:56.117]  Become men again!
[03:01:56.117 --> 03:01:57.718]  Become women again!
[03:01:57.718 --> 03:02:03.980]  Stand up and tell the New World Order, you can take our lives, but you'll never take our freedom!
[03:02:03.980 --> 03:02:09.862]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[03:02:09.862 --> 03:02:13.304]  The people above you that are inviting you into their New World Order, they're slaves.
[03:02:13.304 --> 03:02:14.204]  They've sold out to it.
[03:02:14.444 --> 03:02:16.305]  They're blind and they're cowards.
[03:02:16.305 --> 03:02:17.706]  You don't want to be part of them.
[03:02:17.706 --> 03:02:20.028]  Like Patrick Henry said, forget you are our brethren.
[03:02:20.028 --> 03:02:21.809]  Go from us in peace.
[03:02:21.809 --> 03:02:24.570]  Crouch down and flick the hand that feeds you.
[03:02:24.570 --> 03:02:28.293]  Let your chains sit lightly upon you.
[03:02:28.293 --> 03:02:39.719]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[03:02:39.719 --> 03:02:43.602]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:02:47.347 --> 03:02:53.471]  Seriously, I wanted to see what it was like inside of one of these discord groups that were propagating the gang gang meme.
[03:02:53.471 --> 03:03:06.799]  So we had an undercover infiltrate a leftist troll farm the last week and what's interesting is this troll farm was getting actual directives on how to sow division and discontent.
[03:03:06.799 --> 03:03:09.921]  Their belief currently is that the United States
[03:03:10.826 --> 03:03:16.269]  is going to collapse and we should do everything possible to make that as quickly as possible.
[03:03:16.269 --> 03:03:25.494]  Prior to anyone reporting it, we obtained documents which have subsequently been leaked on 4chan that connect to the New Zealand Shooter's Manifesto.
[03:03:25.494 --> 03:03:29.856]  You've got an insider watching in live time them troll you?
[03:03:29.856 --> 03:03:30.276]  Yes!
[03:03:30.276 --> 03:03:37.320]  There was a large effort to do a file dump of the Discord servers that were appearing to be worthy of me
[03:03:38.974 --> 03:03:43.297]  This New Zealand shooting happened and we're watching the troll farms come into action.
[03:03:43.297 --> 03:03:54.964]  There was a shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand being blamed on a self-confessed white supremacist who several hours before the attack submitted a manifesto to 8chan.
[03:03:54.964 --> 03:03:56.025]  Where I was discovered.
[03:03:56.886 --> 03:04:01.973]  A network of text documents and posts that link to each other.
[03:04:01.973 --> 03:04:09.344]  So you're saying you've got the proof of their pulling this crap and then Oliver Darcy, that snake, says shut down InfoWars, they've got racist commenters.
[03:04:09.986 --> 03:04:11.206]  That's right!
[03:04:11.206 --> 03:04:19.528]  The release of documents several days ago on 4chan and 8chan were basically the game plan to influence the public discourse on the message boards.
[03:04:35.211 --> 03:04:38.155]  Literal psyops going on right now on the American public.
[03:04:38.155 --> 03:04:42.080]  To basically drive the United States into the wall.
[03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:44.203]  To put the foot on the accelerator.
[03:04:44.203 --> 03:04:48.869]  Which is to accelerate things to its inevitable point as quickly as possible.
[03:04:48.869 --> 03:04:49.891]  To sell more hate.
[03:04:54.136 --> 03:04:58.800]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[03:04:58.800 --> 03:05:03.044]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[03:05:03.044 --> 03:05:10.992]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[03:05:10.992 --> 03:05:14.115]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[03:05:14.115 --> 03:05:17.598]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[03:05:19.099 --> 03:05:22.042]  What we say and what we do that changes the world.
[03:05:22.042 --> 03:05:24.084]  We are the power structure.
[03:05:24.084 --> 03:05:25.705]  We are the inventors.
[03:05:25.705 --> 03:05:27.487]  We are the trailblazers.
[03:05:27.487 --> 03:05:30.870]  And the globalists understand that.
[03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:37.997]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people.
[03:05:37.997 --> 03:05:41.801]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[03:05:42.839 --> 03:05:53.348]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at importastore.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[03:05:53.348 --> 03:06:03.576]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:09.551 --> 03:06:10.652]  All right, welcome back.
[03:06:10.652 --> 03:06:11.852]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:06:11.852 --> 03:06:14.133]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:14.133 --> 03:06:15.774]  I will be hosting this hour.
[03:06:15.774 --> 03:06:18.756]  Thank you for joining me, and thank you for staying.
[03:06:18.756 --> 03:06:22.358]  This is absolutely crazy what's happening in the world today.
[03:06:22.358 --> 03:06:23.938]  Thank you for being here.
[03:06:23.938 --> 03:06:33.844]  This is such an honor, such a privilege for me to host the fourth hour of Alex Jones, and I'm trying not to be nervous, but I'm going to work through it.
[03:06:33.844 --> 03:06:34.584]  All right, so
[03:06:35.336 --> 03:06:40.037]  One of the things I want to talk about is Donna Brazile going to Fox News.
[03:06:40.037 --> 03:06:41.677]  This is amazing.
[03:06:41.677 --> 03:06:57.220]  I don't know how many people have realized that Donna Brazile, now she was the one, just to do a recap, Donna Brazile was the one who leaked some of the questions to Hillary Clinton during a debate against President Trump, or at the time, candidate Trump.
[03:06:57.220 --> 03:07:00.701]  And all of a sudden, now we're supposed to be like, oh, this is great.
[03:07:01.443 --> 03:07:10.509]  My question is, is who made the decision, who made the decision for Donna Brazile to go to Fox News and be a contributor?
[03:07:10.509 --> 03:07:16.213]  I mean, it's almost like inviting the snake into the, into your home.
[03:07:16.213 --> 03:07:17.413]  Just come on in.
[03:07:17.413 --> 03:07:18.674]  It's okay.
[03:07:18.674 --> 03:07:20.415]  Now, can she possibly change?
[03:07:20.415 --> 03:07:22.657]  I don't, you know, it is possible.
[03:07:22.657 --> 03:07:23.297]  Sure.
[03:07:23.297 --> 03:07:23.497]  Sure.
[03:07:23.497 --> 03:07:24.618]  It's absolutely possible.
[03:07:24.618 --> 03:07:25.699]  Anyone can change.
[03:07:25.699 --> 03:07:26.940]  I changed.
[03:07:26.940 --> 03:07:30.702]  I used to be a Democrat and I changed from a Democrat to a conservative.
[03:07:31.457 --> 03:07:39.418]  So it is possible, but from looking at the article that she wrote on Fox News, I would say that she didn't change.
[03:07:39.418 --> 03:07:42.959]  And it's pretty, yeah, even on political.
[03:07:42.959 --> 03:07:46.100]  I actually printed out some statements here.
[03:07:46.100 --> 03:07:51.461]  The one where she made her statement saying that I'm excited.
[03:07:51.461 --> 03:07:59.302]  I'm excited by the opportunity to share my perspective and views with Fox, with the Fox News audience and to help shape
[03:08:00.103 --> 03:08:07.348]  Keyword, help shape the dialogue at this important juncture in our history.
[03:08:07.348 --> 03:08:12.891]  So why would Fox News bring her on?
[03:08:12.891 --> 03:08:22.317]  I mean, to me, it's kind of, it's really, really like in our face that Fox News is changing their ways.
[03:08:22.317 --> 03:08:28.381]  Maybe because they're at the top of the ticket as far as the news media, the news media world.
[03:08:29.207 --> 03:08:34.670]  So now that they can do this, they're going to bring in someone like Donna Brazile to try to maybe possibly bring in liberals.
[03:08:34.670 --> 03:08:44.915]  But see, she's not going to be bringing in people to try to change them to understand that President Trump is the right decision and was the right decision in 2016.
[03:08:44.915 --> 03:08:52.439]  She's going to try to get people to believe that progressiveness and being a socialist is the right thing.
[03:08:52.439 --> 03:08:55.360]  Or you should even consider it or take a look at it.
[03:08:55.360 --> 03:08:56.561]  To me, that is the problem.
[03:08:57.236 --> 03:09:00.699]  It's literally infiltrating the conservative movement.
[03:09:00.699 --> 03:09:04.923]  Not that Fox News is outpitching conservative movement by any means.
[03:09:04.923 --> 03:09:07.305]  I'm not giving Fox News any credit in that department.
[03:09:07.305 --> 03:09:12.449]  If you really want to give someone credit in that department, it would be AlexJonesInfoWars.com.
[03:09:12.449 --> 03:09:13.991]  That's where it's really at.
[03:09:13.991 --> 03:09:18.715]  And that's where people know that we have to get into this fight together.
[03:09:18.715 --> 03:09:20.116]  Another thing that she was saying
[03:09:21.244 --> 03:09:30.966]  In her article, and I'm just going to really kind of emphasize just a little bit on this here, and if you don't mind, I'm going to show you here on my screen what I have, what she was saying.
[03:09:30.966 --> 03:09:49.530]  Another thing it says right here, I fully admit that in my previous lives as a campaign staffer, presidential campaign manager and Democrat Party official, my own lack of civility
[03:09:50.322 --> 03:09:55.724]  And the heat of the battle was on full display.
[03:09:55.724 --> 03:10:01.425]  She said it was on full display and it wasn't pretty.
[03:10:01.425 --> 03:10:03.666]  Of course it wasn't pretty.
[03:10:03.666 --> 03:10:04.886]  Of course it wasn't pretty.
[03:10:04.886 --> 03:10:08.527]  She leaked questions to Hillary Clinton.
[03:10:08.527 --> 03:10:12.788]  That's the part that people were like, some people don't even remember that.
[03:10:12.788 --> 03:10:14.609]  But yet now we have Fox News.
[03:10:15.347 --> 03:10:22.952]  Straight up having Donna Brazile, the one person that was completely against President Trump, 100%.
[03:10:22.952 --> 03:10:34.680]  So my question to this, to everyone that's watching, once she's there a while, and now we're getting ready to have the 2020 election, it's like it's all being set up right now in front of our faces.
[03:10:34.680 --> 03:10:39.263]  With the 2020 election getting ready to come up, is she going to be privy to some of the questions?
[03:10:39.263 --> 03:10:44.587]  That's if Fox News is even able to have a debate, to host a debate.
[03:10:45.299 --> 03:10:48.381]  If they can host a debate, is she going to be privy to some of the questions?
[03:10:48.381 --> 03:10:50.563]  And is she going to pass it on?
[03:10:50.563 --> 03:10:51.904]  I mean, you have to wonder.
[03:10:51.904 --> 03:10:53.705]  I mean, at least I do.
[03:10:53.705 --> 03:10:56.587]  I mean, who wouldn't?
[03:10:56.587 --> 03:11:00.650]  There's so many other people that they could have brought on.
[03:11:00.650 --> 03:11:06.034]  Now, speaking of being a contributor, I'm a contributor to InfoWars, and I'm very thankful.
[03:11:06.034 --> 03:11:08.236]  And I think it's truly a blessing.
[03:11:08.236 --> 03:11:12.960]  God has blessed me to be a contributor with InfoWars.com.
[03:11:12.960 --> 03:11:14.681]  And I take that blessing with
[03:11:15.507 --> 03:11:17.269]  With such great honor.
[03:11:17.269 --> 03:11:20.032]  And it's absolutely wonderful to be here.
[03:11:20.032 --> 03:11:26.598]  But Donna Brazile, we know that she is completely against the President of the United States.
[03:11:26.598 --> 03:11:27.939]  We know this.
[03:11:27.939 --> 03:11:29.701]  It's no secret.
[03:11:29.701 --> 03:11:32.083]  They're not hiding it.
[03:11:32.083 --> 03:11:35.767]  And yet they still bring her on and people are already questioning
[03:11:37.409 --> 03:11:39.631]  Fox News, they're already questioning it.
[03:11:39.631 --> 03:11:42.153]  And it's like, is this the nail in the coffin?
[03:11:42.153 --> 03:11:45.075]  Does this confirm our suspicion?
[03:11:45.075 --> 03:11:49.139]  Does this confirm that Fox News is really trying to go left?
[03:11:49.139 --> 03:11:55.884]  It's like they're pulling in all the conservatives, all the Republicans, all the Trump supporters to Fox News.
[03:11:55.884 --> 03:12:03.490]  And then now we're going to start pushing you to believe what the left has been saying all along.
[03:12:03.490 --> 03:12:05.372]  That the left has the right idea.
[03:12:06.883 --> 03:12:12.068]  I mean, don't they already have enough liberal leftist media outlets out there?
[03:12:12.068 --> 03:12:31.765]  I mean, you have CNN, ABC, CBS, the entire Alphabet Network soup group with all of these hateful American anti-Trump ideas and stories that they're putting out, and they have to bring on a complete, total socialist, communist, liberal to Fox News?
[03:12:31.765 --> 03:12:33.066]  What is the end game in that?
[03:12:33.928 --> 03:12:35.889]  Did anyone imagine that?
[03:12:35.889 --> 03:12:38.029]  I mean, I didn't see this coming.
[03:12:38.029 --> 03:12:41.610]  And like I was saying earlier, whose decision was it?
[03:12:41.610 --> 03:12:44.571]  Who thought it was a good idea to bring Donna Brazile?
[03:12:44.571 --> 03:12:45.511]  And you know what?
[03:12:45.511 --> 03:12:47.392]  Maybe it is.
[03:12:47.392 --> 03:12:56.814]  Maybe people that don't see how crazy these leftists are, because they don't watch the liberal media, maybe with her being there, because you already have Ron Williams,
[03:12:57.893 --> 03:13:00.619]  And he's already a crazy leftist.
[03:13:00.619 --> 03:13:02.363]  But maybe it's not enough.
[03:13:02.363 --> 03:13:04.287]  Maybe they need to see more of it.
[03:13:05.006 --> 03:13:13.490]  You know, there was a there was a post out there with Ilhan Omar, and they were talking about how actually the post was with Breitbart.
[03:13:13.490 --> 03:13:17.032]  They went to the Capitol and they were they had Jewish community there.
[03:13:17.032 --> 03:13:24.015]  And they had this Jewish man talking to Nancy Pelosi's, you know, trying to get her to denounce Ilhan Omar.
[03:13:24.015 --> 03:13:30.078]  And they were and he made a comment in the video saying that, well, maybe possibly we should censor Ilhan Omar.
[03:13:30.078 --> 03:13:31.319]  And I'm completely against that.
[03:13:31.903 --> 03:13:39.029]  We shouldn't censor these crazy leftists because if we censor them we don't know what they're doing.
[03:13:39.029 --> 03:13:41.510]  We don't see the craziness that they're doing.
[03:13:41.510 --> 03:13:47.375]  I don't want them to censor CNN because then at that point I can't watch CNN to see how crazy they are.
[03:13:47.375 --> 03:13:50.898]  That's the only reason why I watch them.
[03:13:50.898 --> 03:13:55.141]  Day in and day out they spend their entire time attacking
[03:13:56.798 --> 03:14:00.381]  Fox News now, along with President Trump.
[03:14:00.381 --> 03:14:09.949]  So maybe they're trying to get the attacks to calm down and bring in a socialist, communist, leftist like Donna Brazile to maybe ease the tension.
[03:14:09.949 --> 03:14:17.535]  And do you not find it ironic that all of a sudden she comes on, but look what they did to Judge Jeanine.
[03:14:17.535 --> 03:14:24.601]  Judge Jeanine just came out and made her completely freedom of speech comments about Ilhan Omar wearing a hijab.
[03:14:25.319 --> 03:14:26.900]  She has every right to say it.
[03:14:26.900 --> 03:14:29.642]  Not one time did she call for violence.
[03:14:29.642 --> 03:14:31.264]  See, that's the difference.
[03:14:31.264 --> 03:14:38.970]  Conservatives never call for violence, but the left see it as violence when we talk about them.
[03:14:38.970 --> 03:14:40.231]  Is that not the problem?
[03:14:40.231 --> 03:14:42.152]  Think about that.
[03:14:42.152 --> 03:14:48.757]  Every time we show support for President Trump, they like to think that we're being anti-American.
[03:14:48.757 --> 03:14:51.539]  Or if you're white, you're a white supremacist.
[03:14:51.539 --> 03:14:53.421]  But I'm going to talk a little bit more about that later on.
[03:14:54.096 --> 03:14:58.397]  But right now, the whole point with Donna Brazile, really?
[03:14:58.397 --> 03:14:58.837]  Really?
[03:14:58.837 --> 03:15:12.920]  There's so many other people that would have been better fit than bringing on such a person that we already know that is totally against the president of the United States.
[03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:14.380]  What is that?
[03:15:14.380 --> 03:15:17.461]  What is the idea behind all of that?
[03:15:17.461 --> 03:15:19.601]  Someone should really be asking that question.
[03:15:20.692 --> 03:15:25.478]  So we're getting ready to go into break, but before we go into break, I want to read this to you.
[03:15:25.478 --> 03:15:27.140]  This is InfoWars.
[03:15:27.140 --> 03:15:31.725]  And I personally, I've been watching InfoWars for a long time, and this is absolutely phenomenal.
[03:15:31.725 --> 03:15:32.566]  They have like 50% off sale.
[03:15:34.483 --> 03:15:34.964]  Store.
[03:15:34.964 --> 03:15:38.327]  I mean, look like this is a storewide, if I'm not mistaken.
[03:15:38.327 --> 03:15:42.871]  But they have 50% off on all InfoWars life supplements.
[03:15:42.871 --> 03:15:44.832]  This is absolutely wonderful.
[03:15:44.832 --> 03:15:46.434]  Free shipping storewide.
[03:15:46.434 --> 03:15:47.695]  There's the storewide.
[03:15:47.695 --> 03:15:51.899]  Free shipping storewide and double patron points on all purchases.
[03:15:53.342 --> 03:15:54.563]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.563 --> 03:15:58.484]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.484 --> 03:16:00.025]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:00.025 --> 03:16:02.987]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:02.987 --> 03:16:08.549]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.549 --> 03:16:09.750]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.750 --> 03:16:12.671]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.671 --> 03:16:14.892]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:14.892 --> 03:16:19.334]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:19.334 --> 03:16:21.635]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:22.896 --> 03:16:29.241]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.241 --> 03:16:32.283]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.283 --> 03:16:38.207]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.207 --> 03:16:42.010]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.010 --> 03:16:43.270]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.270 --> 03:16:44.611]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.611 --> 03:16:50.816]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.816 --> 03:16:52.257]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:52.961 --> 03:16:56.543]  Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:16:56.543 --> 03:17:00.105]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:17:00.105 --> 03:17:02.246]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:17:54.092 --> 03:17:59.856]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[03:17:59.856 --> 03:18:01.317]  So I need to make them strong now.
[03:18:01.317 --> 03:18:03.078]  Now I can be there for my children.
[03:18:03.078 --> 03:18:04.900]  Now I can make them strong.
[03:18:04.900 --> 03:18:06.561]  Now I can instruct them.
[03:18:06.561 --> 03:18:08.282]  Now I can teach them what I've learned.
[03:18:08.282 --> 03:18:09.283]  But not once I'm gone.
[03:18:09.363 --> 03:18:14.506]  You think in this digital age, your words go on forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[03:18:14.506 --> 03:18:20.110]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[03:18:20.110 --> 03:18:23.733]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[03:18:23.733 --> 03:18:28.716]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[03:18:28.716 --> 03:18:35.601]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[03:18:35.601 --> 03:18:39.263]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[03:18:39.363 --> 03:18:46.992]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[03:18:46.992 --> 03:18:53.600]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[03:18:55.114 --> 03:19:04.804]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-Western speech all across the world.
[03:19:04.804 --> 03:19:11.271]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed.
[03:19:11.271 --> 03:19:12.772]  Then they set the precedent.
[03:19:12.772 --> 03:19:16.916]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert,
[03:19:17.637 --> 03:19:19.119]  They take you off the internet.
[03:19:19.119 --> 03:19:29.931]  Now, Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[03:19:29.931 --> 03:19:32.134]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip.
[03:19:32.754 --> 03:19:35.236]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:05.495 --> 03:20:06.879]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:20:06.879 --> 03:20:08.724]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.357 --> 03:20:19.198]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.198 --> 03:20:20.739]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:20:20.739 --> 03:20:22.880]  I am hosting this hour.
[03:20:22.880 --> 03:20:25.381]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:20:25.381 --> 03:20:35.324]  So I just got through talking about Donna Brazile and how she infiltrated Fox News and someone in Fox News had to give her the pass to bring her on in.
[03:20:35.324 --> 03:20:36.905]  But I want to move on.
[03:20:36.905 --> 03:20:44.248]  I want to move on to how right now in America and not just America, but across the world, we have
[03:20:45.060 --> 03:20:48.882]  This whole thing about white supremacy.
[03:20:48.882 --> 03:20:53.285]  And the reason why I keep talking about it is because I want to drill it in.
[03:20:53.285 --> 03:20:55.506]  And I give you an example.
[03:20:55.506 --> 03:21:09.674]  When Martin Luther King was here and he was going around trying to get all of the injustices that was taking place against black people by these Democrats, by these white Democrats, he kept speaking.
[03:21:09.674 --> 03:21:11.055]  He kept talking about it.
[03:21:11.576 --> 03:21:12.757]  He did not let up.
[03:21:12.757 --> 03:21:16.659]  And I'm pretty sure there was people out there telling him, maybe you should stop.
[03:21:16.659 --> 03:21:17.659]  Maybe you should calm down.
[03:21:17.659 --> 03:21:18.840]  They're going to try to harm you.
[03:21:18.840 --> 03:21:20.841]  They're going to try to do something to you.
[03:21:20.841 --> 03:21:23.042]  But he knew he couldn't stop.
[03:21:23.042 --> 03:21:28.405]  Now, by any means, I cannot feel the shoes of Martin Luther King, and I'm not trying to.
[03:21:28.405 --> 03:21:35.269]  My point is, is that if we stop talking about it, if we stop addressing it, it's not going to go away.
[03:21:35.990 --> 03:21:46.434]  That's part of the reason why America is in the predicament that it's in right now, because we did not have enough good men and women to stand up and speak about this craziness.
[03:21:46.434 --> 03:21:52.917]  We have Alex Jones, and Alex Jones has done a phenomenal job over the years.
[03:21:52.917 --> 03:21:54.978]  But we still have our part.
[03:21:54.978 --> 03:21:57.319]  We still have to do what we have to do.
[03:21:57.319 --> 03:22:00.260]  And Alex Jones has made it clear that we all have to do it.
[03:22:01.138 --> 03:22:02.959]  And he's encouraged people.
[03:22:02.959 --> 03:22:05.940]  And I'll be honest with you, I got a lot of encouragement from Alex Jones.
[03:22:05.940 --> 03:22:15.323]  Listened to him one years ago saying, pick up a camera, record something, do something, try, speak out.
[03:22:15.323 --> 03:22:20.004]  And he's absolutely right because of not enough women in the past have done it.
[03:22:20.004 --> 03:22:28.227]  So to get, to get to the point where I'm talking about AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
[03:22:29.546 --> 03:22:37.163]  She's the one, along with a lot of these other socialist Democrats, have been pushing this racist rhetoric.
[03:22:38.174 --> 03:22:39.335]  Throughout the entire country.
[03:22:39.335 --> 03:22:44.619]  And the reason why I'm talking about her because she has millions of followers on Twitter.
[03:22:44.619 --> 03:22:47.942]  She has millions of people that listen to what she's saying.
[03:22:47.942 --> 03:22:52.125]  No matter how crazy it is, people are following for it.
[03:22:52.125 --> 03:22:58.270]  You even have Nancy Pelosi jumping in on the ACO bandwagon, which is completely crazy to me.
[03:22:58.270 --> 03:23:01.292]  And they're all talking about because she's bringing fresh new ideas.
[03:23:01.292 --> 03:23:03.474]  They're fresh, crazy ideas.
[03:23:03.474 --> 03:23:06.276]  If you want to be honest, that's exactly what we're seeing here.
[03:23:06.756 --> 03:23:08.398]  So let me put something that I have.
[03:23:08.398 --> 03:23:12.401]  I have a screenshot of her.
[03:23:12.401 --> 03:23:17.545]  I have a screenshot of one of her tweets that I want to have here, and you can see my brain force there.
[03:23:17.545 --> 03:23:19.526]  I'm sorry, turbo force.
[03:23:19.526 --> 03:23:23.049]  It's almost like brain force, but it's better, my opinion.
[03:23:23.049 --> 03:23:27.673]  OK, so we have AOC here and this is a tweet that I printed out.
[03:23:28.453 --> 03:23:42.903]  And she goes on to say, we all can play a role in recognizing plus preventing spread of white supremacy, especially our white friends.
[03:23:42.903 --> 03:23:51.089]  There are a lot of community orgs, writers, plus groups that help people learn to spot white supremacy.
[03:23:51.089 --> 03:23:52.310]  Is that not crazy?
[03:23:52.310 --> 03:23:54.892]  I mean, think about it.
[03:23:54.892 --> 03:23:57.814]  She's basically saying, telling her white friends.
[03:23:59.128 --> 03:24:02.111]  Not to be white supremacists.
[03:24:02.111 --> 03:24:10.399]  And for the life of me, if you're a white and you're a Democrat, why are you still in the Democrat Party when they are calling you white supremacists?
[03:24:10.399 --> 03:24:16.205]  Well, see, the whole point in that is that they're basically saying anyone on the right is a white supremacist.
[03:24:16.205 --> 03:24:17.586]  That's what it comes down to.
[03:24:17.586 --> 03:24:19.868]  I mean, it's quite obvious.
[03:24:19.868 --> 03:24:20.729]  It's quite obvious.
[03:24:20.729 --> 03:24:21.310]  If you're right,
[03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:27.083]  You're a white supremacist because they don't like anyone that supports the President of the United States.
[03:24:27.083 --> 03:24:29.684]  They don't like anyone that supports the First Amendment.
[03:24:29.684 --> 03:24:32.586]  They don't like anyone that supports the Second Amendment.
[03:24:32.586 --> 03:24:38.229]  And they most importantly, don't like anyone who supports President Trump.
[03:24:38.229 --> 03:24:39.150]  And that's where we are.
[03:24:39.150 --> 03:24:40.951]  This is the country we live in.
[03:24:40.951 --> 03:24:50.096]  I mean, you even have people, if you wear a mega hat, and I love my mega hat, and I wear it every single chance I get when I go out.
[03:24:50.096 --> 03:24:50.876]  I love wearing it.
[03:24:51.531 --> 03:24:58.036]  Me being a black male wearing a mega hat, I think it scares them, you know, more than a white person in a mega hat these days.
[03:24:58.036 --> 03:24:59.337]  Look at Jussie Smollett.
[03:24:59.337 --> 03:25:01.659]  I mean, just an example.
[03:25:01.659 --> 03:25:16.872]  But ALC, she's pushing the whole white supremacy, trying to say that it's on the uprise, that we're all in trouble, that we all have to pay attention, that white people are being indoctrinated on the internet.
[03:25:16.872 --> 03:25:19.173]  They're joining these hate groups.
[03:25:19.173 --> 03:25:20.975]  And the hate groups that they're talking about,
[03:25:21.579 --> 03:25:24.100]  Are those of us on the right?
[03:25:24.100 --> 03:25:28.161]  And I've had people say, because I'm black, that I'm a Nazi sympathizer.
[03:25:28.161 --> 03:25:30.742]  I mean, how ignorant is that?
[03:25:30.742 --> 03:25:34.002]  There are no Nazi groups.
[03:25:34.002 --> 03:25:36.303]  I mean, you may have a few.
[03:25:36.303 --> 03:25:42.025]  And when I mean a few, I'm talking probably less than a hundred, if you take my opinion on it.
[03:25:42.025 --> 03:25:43.145]  There's probably less than a hundred.
[03:25:45.063 --> 03:25:51.948]  If there was statistics where they were showing there was thousands of Nazis grouping up in America, then they would be able to show it.
[03:25:51.948 --> 03:25:53.369]  But they can't.
[03:25:53.369 --> 03:26:02.335]  You know, I've been to Portland, where they had all the Antifa show up, BLM and BAM, all of these anti-American groups.
[03:26:02.335 --> 03:26:11.902]  I've been to the Battle of Berkeley, where again, you have Antifa, BAM, and all of these anti-American groups show up.
[03:26:12.532 --> 03:26:17.714]  To try to throw rocks, bombs, explosives at conservatives.
[03:26:17.714 --> 03:26:23.657]  But yet they call people on the right, white supremacists simply because you're white.
[03:26:23.657 --> 03:26:39.603]  And you know what, what, what, what amazes me the most when I go to these rallies and I'm standing there with people that love this country holding the American flag and they happen to be white and I stand in front of them, you get BLM and BAM and Antifa and all these other hateful groups.
[03:26:39.603 --> 03:26:40.824]  They'll look around me.
[03:26:42.020 --> 03:26:46.564]  And they'll say, you're racist, you're racist, you're a neo-Nazi.
[03:26:46.564 --> 03:26:50.527]  They'll look around me to point at the white person behind me.
[03:26:50.527 --> 03:26:52.869]  I mean, it's like, hello, I'm right here.
[03:26:52.869 --> 03:26:53.809]  I support America.
[03:26:53.809 --> 03:26:56.071]  I love this country.
[03:26:56.071 --> 03:26:58.833]  But see, they want to demonize white people.
[03:26:58.833 --> 03:27:05.659]  And I'm going to continue talking about how they're doing this to white people until they stop doing it.
[03:27:05.659 --> 03:27:08.461]  The crazy thing is, is they're not going to stop doing it.
[03:27:09.446 --> 03:27:12.407]  I have a video that I'm going to show you with Cory Booker.
[03:27:12.407 --> 03:27:15.068]  I like to call him Cory Booker.
[03:27:15.068 --> 03:27:23.570]  His actual name is Cory Booker, but I like to call him Cory Booker because he's a snotty-nosed booger that's trying to bring in more racism in the country.
[03:27:23.570 --> 03:27:25.130]  I mean, you've already seen it.
[03:27:25.130 --> 03:27:33.753]  Don Lemon, and he's a sour one, extra sour, come out talking about how white people are the problem in America, specifically white males.
[03:27:34.907 --> 03:27:38.049]  How sickening are the, how sickening is that?
[03:27:38.049 --> 03:27:40.450]  How sick are these people?
[03:27:40.450 --> 03:27:48.875]  You would think the year 2019 after Martin Luther King came and said that it's our character, not our color, that these people would embrace that.
[03:27:48.875 --> 03:27:53.278]  If Martin Luther King was walking around today, they would be attacking him.
[03:27:53.278 --> 03:27:55.239]  They will be calling him the Uncle Tom.
[03:27:55.239 --> 03:27:57.100]  They will be calling him the coon.
[03:27:57.100 --> 03:28:00.942]  They will be calling him the race traitor.
[03:28:00.942 --> 03:28:01.682]  Think about that.
[03:28:01.682 --> 03:28:04.484]  They will be calling him all of the hateful names that they call me.
[03:28:05.945 --> 03:28:08.586]  Martin Luther King was a Republican.
[03:28:08.586 --> 03:28:11.566]  He wasn't a Democratic KKK party member.
[03:28:11.566 --> 03:28:13.426]  He wasn't.
[03:28:13.426 --> 03:28:14.987]  He was not.
[03:28:14.987 --> 03:28:17.167]  So people need to understand.
[03:28:17.167 --> 03:28:27.309]  So when we come back from this break, I'm going to play the video with Cory Booger talking about white supremacy and how it was supposedly on the uprise.
[03:28:27.309 --> 03:28:29.990]  We'll be right back after this message.
[03:28:29.990 --> 03:28:30.390]  God bless.
[03:28:30.390 --> 03:28:30.830]  See you in a minute.
[03:28:33.116 --> 03:28:37.992]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:28:37.992 --> 03:28:39.437]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:28:53.399 --> 03:28:55.381]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:28:55.381 --> 03:29:00.684]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:29:00.684 --> 03:29:02.266]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:29:02.266 --> 03:29:10.632]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:10.632 --> 03:29:16.316]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:29:16.616 --> 03:29:16.996]  I don't know.
[03:29:35.049 --> 03:29:37.070]  Our grandparents, our great-grandparents, they canned food.
[03:29:37.070 --> 03:29:40.071]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[03:30:00.436 --> 03:30:03.380]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[03:30:03.380 --> 03:30:07.426]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply.
[03:30:09.011 --> 03:30:18.155]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[03:31:17.655 --> 03:31:18.215]  We made it.

[03:31:43.060 --> 03:31:44.081]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:31:44.341 --> 03:31:47.464]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.

[03:33:18.277 --> 03:33:19.338]  Welcome back.
[03:33:19.338 --> 03:33:21.619]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:21.619 --> 03:33:23.259]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:33:23.259 --> 03:33:24.280]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:33:25.248 --> 03:33:32.594]  Before I get started and I was saying before the last in the last segment that I'm going to show a video with Cory Booker or Cory Booger.
[03:33:32.594 --> 03:33:34.256]  Let me talk about the supplements.
[03:33:34.256 --> 03:33:36.037]  This is huge.
[03:33:36.037 --> 03:33:43.323]  I'm really talking about it because the Turbo Force, I actually have a cup of Turbo Force right now on my desk and I'm drinking it.
[03:33:43.323 --> 03:33:44.064]  I like it hot.
[03:33:44.064 --> 03:33:47.106]  Personally, I make it hot and I sip it like tea.
[03:33:47.106 --> 03:33:52.190]  But right now with the free shipping store wide, how could you not take advantage of this?
[03:33:52.190 --> 03:33:54.052]  And it's 50 percent off.
[03:33:54.972 --> 03:33:56.254]  I mean, this is no brainer.
[03:33:56.254 --> 03:34:02.605]  I mean, I'm putting in the order myself because what you have double points on all purchases.
[03:34:02.605 --> 03:34:04.288]  This is amazing.
[03:34:04.288 --> 03:34:07.314]  50% off the brain force, the protein bars.
[03:34:08.143 --> 03:34:09.243]  TurboForce.
[03:34:09.243 --> 03:34:13.384]  Now the TurboForce, I've heard Alex Jones said the TurboForce is about to sell out.
[03:34:13.384 --> 03:34:15.725]  I'm glad I got my box now.
[03:34:15.725 --> 03:34:22.726]  So I might order another box before it sells out because I can't express how wonderful this TurboForce is.
[03:34:22.726 --> 03:34:25.327]  It really makes me feel like I can take on the world.
[03:34:25.327 --> 03:34:30.008]  I have the energy that is unbelievable without the crash.
[03:34:30.008 --> 03:34:31.008]  That's amazing to me.
[03:34:31.648 --> 03:34:36.592]  So, and also, you have all these different ones, the DNA, the DNA Force Plus.
[03:34:36.592 --> 03:34:48.202]  There's so many products on the InfoWarsStore.com that you can get that take your ability to take on the world to the next level.

[03:34:49.843 --> 03:34:50.724]  I love it.
[03:34:50.724 --> 03:34:55.108]  And I'm not just saying that because I'm hosting a show on the InfoWars.
[03:34:55.108 --> 03:34:57.570]  I've been saying it before I got to this point.
[03:34:58.050 --> 03:35:00.493]  So, please, by all means, check it out.
[03:35:00.493 --> 03:35:02.075]  Infowarsstore.com.

[03:35:03.356 --> 03:35:03.857]  Check it out.
[03:35:03.857 --> 03:35:04.237]  Check it out.
[03:35:04.237 --> 03:35:04.758]  Okay.
[03:35:04.758 --> 03:35:06.259]  So, let's get on.
[03:35:06.259 --> 03:35:09.543]  Like I said, I have this video with Cory Booger.
[03:35:09.543 --> 03:35:10.244]  Okay?
[03:35:10.244 --> 03:35:11.966]  Cory Booger.
[03:35:11.966 --> 03:35:18.073]  Where he also is going talking about how white supremacy is on the rise.
[03:35:19.242 --> 03:35:22.884]  And we all should be paying attention exactly how they're spinning this.
[03:35:22.884 --> 03:35:25.625]  And even the media is complicit with it.
[03:35:25.625 --> 03:35:33.808]  Even the media is going right along with the whole white supremacy is trying to take over and do all of these things.
[03:35:33.808 --> 03:35:38.810]  We cannot stand idly by why they do this.
[03:35:38.810 --> 03:35:40.731]  I'm not going to.
[03:35:40.731 --> 03:35:43.952]  I don't see white people as the problem.
[03:35:43.952 --> 03:35:44.973]  Just to be honest,
[03:35:45.882 --> 03:35:59.145]  There's been more white people in America, maybe partly because there's more white people in America, but there's been more white people in America to help me and try to help me to succeed than black people have.
[03:35:59.145 --> 03:36:00.565]  You have to think about that.
[03:36:00.565 --> 03:36:07.127]  And really when I think further back, the people that were helping me were Republicans.
[03:36:07.127 --> 03:36:11.788]  And I'm like, cause I used to live in a state that was predominantly Republican, which was Arkansas.
[03:36:13.331 --> 03:36:17.052]  First of all, let's just understand that what happened in New Zealand is horrific.
[03:36:43.886 --> 03:36:51.880]  And we should all pause and really express our sorrow and our mourning for the people who are struggling and suffering with that grievous loss.
[03:36:52.925 --> 03:37:06.735]  We have now a nation, and we see this around the world, where white supremacy and anti-Islamic vicious hate is manifesting itself in this kind of violence, and that is absolutely unacceptable.
[03:37:06.735 --> 03:37:09.758]  We in America know that kind of hate.
[03:37:09.758 --> 03:37:17.323]  We've seen how white supremacy, the terrorist attacks being conducted by white supremacist organizations in this country are on the rise, and they're obviously seeing it globally.
[03:37:17.323 --> 03:37:20.826]  So I condemn that, and this is why words matter.
[03:37:21.841 --> 03:37:22.642]  Okay.
[03:37:22.642 --> 03:37:24.703]  Words do matter.
[03:37:24.703 --> 03:37:26.584]  Yeah, they absolutely do matter.
[03:37:26.584 --> 03:37:31.187]  What about Roshida Tlaib saying we're going to impeach the MF-er?
[03:37:31.187 --> 03:37:33.428]  I mean, do words matter then?
[03:37:33.428 --> 03:37:37.690]  What about Ilhan Omar with her whole anti-Semitic comments?
[03:37:37.690 --> 03:37:39.592]  Do words matter then?
[03:37:39.592 --> 03:37:47.016]  See, he's referring to President Trump coming out saying that there were good people on both sides when it comes to Charlottesville.
[03:37:47.751 --> 03:37:51.094]  They keep emphasizing about Charlottesville, Charlottesville.
[03:37:51.094 --> 03:38:02.545]  I know that's the only thing they have on anything because they have one idiot decide to go out there and get in a vehicle and kill a person.
[03:38:02.545 --> 03:38:05.387]  Look how they're attacking President Trump because of that.
[03:38:05.387 --> 03:38:07.149]  He had nothing to do with that.
[03:38:07.149 --> 03:38:09.031]  Same thing with New Zealand.
[03:38:09.031 --> 03:38:12.194]  President Trump had nothing to do with that.
[03:38:12.194 --> 03:38:13.455]  Talking about words matter.
[03:38:14.329 --> 03:38:19.052]  Of course they matter, but there were good people on both sides in Charlottesville.
[03:38:19.052 --> 03:38:20.814]  And for some reason they want to acknowledge that.
[03:38:20.814 --> 03:38:22.014]  You know why?
[03:38:22.014 --> 03:38:28.559]  Because when they said there was good people on both sides, when President Trump said it was good people on both sides, that's a true statement.
[03:38:28.559 --> 03:38:35.264]  But the liberals, they have a problem with saying that people on the right are good people.
[03:38:35.264 --> 03:38:37.565]  Only people on the left are good.
[03:38:37.565 --> 03:38:38.646]  That's what they're saying.
[03:38:38.646 --> 03:38:40.948]  Only people on the left are good people.
[03:38:40.948 --> 03:38:42.869]  Anyone on the right that love this country,
[03:38:44.069 --> 03:38:50.211]  That loves our First Amendment, our Second Amendment, loves God, and respects our President.
[03:38:50.211 --> 03:38:54.332]  Those people, they consider not being good.
[03:38:54.332 --> 03:39:01.914]  So, speaking of words, you had AOC, what I was talking about earlier, come out talking about white supremacy on the uprising.
[03:39:01.914 --> 03:39:03.434]  You have Cory Booker on the uprising.
[03:39:03.434 --> 03:39:10.756]  Then Cory Booker goes on to say that you have all of these white supremacist groups attacking Islamic groups now.
[03:39:11.539 --> 03:39:19.923]  How many times in the past have you heard of white supremacist groups going out attacking Muslims at the mosque or Muslims on the street?
[03:39:19.923 --> 03:39:21.743]  How many times have you heard that?
[03:39:21.743 --> 03:39:33.268]  If it was happening as often as the liberal media saying it, and even Cory Booker, you know good and well that all of these liberal media outlets will be displaying it.
[03:39:33.268 --> 03:39:35.089]  They will be showing it day in and day out.
[03:39:35.089 --> 03:39:35.869]  There will be non-stop.
[03:39:37.791 --> 03:39:42.874]  The reason why they keep going back to Charlottesville, because that's the only thing that they have.
[03:39:42.874 --> 03:39:52.499]  Now, when I was in Portland and the police department did an excellent job the second time I was there, they kept Antifa from engaging with us.
[03:39:52.499 --> 03:39:57.742]  So because Antifa could not engage with us, they started throwing rocks and bottles at the police department.
[03:39:57.742 --> 03:40:04.166]  So rightfully so, the police department started throwing explosives back at them to break them up, to make them leave.
[03:40:05.504 --> 03:40:13.569]  And then the local liberal media said it was us that incited the violence that caused Antifa to be violent towards the police department.
[03:40:13.569 --> 03:40:15.890]  Do you see that?
[03:40:15.890 --> 03:40:18.032]  The brainwashing just right there.
[03:40:18.032 --> 03:40:18.732]  Boom.
[03:40:18.732 --> 03:40:19.493]  Let's not hide it.
[03:40:19.493 --> 03:40:21.714]  Let's just brainwash them in the public.
[03:40:21.714 --> 03:40:23.975]  Let's just make it all happen right here.
[03:40:23.975 --> 03:40:27.097]  We don't need to hide it anymore because people are so done down.
[03:40:27.097 --> 03:40:30.039]  They're going to believe anything that the liberal media says.
[03:40:30.039 --> 03:40:31.100]  But that's not the case.
[03:40:31.781 --> 03:40:36.166]  That's the reason why CNN and the rest of them, their ratings are in the tank.
[03:40:36.166 --> 03:40:41.611]  I mean, I do videos myself and I get better ratings than CNN, which is crazy.
[03:40:41.611 --> 03:40:51.061]  That's probably one of the reasons why Facebook is putting CNN on its pedestal and helping them push their message out.
[03:40:51.061 --> 03:40:53.104]  And they're banning conservatives.
[03:40:53.104 --> 03:40:54.225]  They're blocking conservatives.
[03:40:55.879 --> 03:40:57.439]  This is the problem in America.
[03:40:57.439 --> 03:41:00.060]  We're in Nazi Germany all over again.
[03:41:00.060 --> 03:41:02.401]  And guess who is the Gestapo?
[03:41:02.401 --> 03:41:04.641]  It is these tech companies.
[03:41:04.641 --> 03:41:06.342]  They are the ones who's trying to take us down.
[03:41:06.342 --> 03:41:07.682]  But I digress.
[03:41:07.682 --> 03:41:08.783]  I'm getting into tech companies.
[03:41:08.783 --> 03:41:11.003]  It's a whole different subject.
[03:41:11.003 --> 03:41:15.945]  I'm talking about the white supremacy that's supposedly taking over the planet.
[03:41:15.945 --> 03:41:19.906]  See, they don't want to talk about how ISIS is killing people.
[03:41:19.906 --> 03:41:24.587]  ISIS put people in cages over water.
[03:41:26.275 --> 03:41:29.457]  And submerge the cage in the water and they watch it.
[03:41:29.457 --> 03:41:31.218]  How horrible is that?
[03:41:31.218 --> 03:41:34.580]  Where's the liberal media talking about that?
[03:41:34.580 --> 03:41:38.142]  Where's the liberal just just was a week or so ago.
[03:41:38.142 --> 03:41:43.045]  There's a report where they killed 60 Christians overseas.
[03:41:43.045 --> 03:41:51.910]  And I think another report showed it was more than more than 60 was 100 plus Christians that were killed because they were Christians by these Muslim groups.
[03:41:51.910 --> 03:41:54.712]  And where is the liberal media at on that?
[03:41:55.598 --> 03:41:58.800]  Where's the outcry on that?
[03:41:58.800 --> 03:42:16.889]  And the only reason why they're talking about anything being anti-Semitic and the Democrat Party trying to bring up a whole resolution about it is because they don't want people to realize that Jewish people, they bring a lot of money.
[03:42:16.889 --> 03:42:20.591]  The Jewish community brings a lot of money to the Democrat Party.
[03:42:21.340 --> 03:42:24.642]  And they want to squash that really quick because they want that money.
[03:42:24.642 --> 03:42:26.403]  And Nancy Pelosi knows it.
[03:42:26.403 --> 03:42:29.525]  But people in the Jewish community are leaving.
[03:42:29.525 --> 03:42:30.846]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:42:30.846 --> 03:42:33.167]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:33.167 --> 03:42:36.969]  We will be right back after this brief message.
[03:42:36.969 --> 03:42:37.890]  See you in a minute.
[03:42:37.890 --> 03:42:38.230]  God bless.
[03:42:53.078 --> 03:42:55.579]  I've got some really good news, though.
[03:42:55.579 --> 03:42:56.959]  X2's back.
[03:42:56.959 --> 03:42:58.719]  The original X2.
[03:42:58.719 --> 03:43:01.640]  Deep-earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[03:43:01.640 --> 03:43:02.720]  What you want.

[03:43:06.821 --> 03:43:07.781]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:07.781 --> 03:43:09.602]  With the best iodine in the world.
[03:43:09.602 --> 03:43:10.742]  X2, it's available.
[03:43:10.742 --> 03:43:11.722]  I thought X3's great.
[03:43:11.722 --> 03:43:13.923]  We still got another deep-earth crystal source.
[03:43:13.923 --> 03:43:15.743]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[03:43:15.743 --> 03:43:17.083]  The scientists that do that.
[03:43:17.083 --> 03:43:18.904]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[03:43:19.744 --> 03:43:24.107]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[03:43:24.107 --> 03:43:28.209]  We now have X2 again at InfoWarsTore.com, so hallelujah!
[03:43:28.209 --> 03:43:39.896]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.

[03:45:54.113 --> 03:46:01.919]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[03:46:01.919 --> 03:46:05.262]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[03:46:05.262 --> 03:46:08.364]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[03:46:08.364 --> 03:46:09.905]  I didn't invent all this.
[03:46:09.905 --> 03:46:16.470]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[03:46:16.470 --> 03:46:19.273]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been.
[03:46:20.322 --> 03:46:23.665]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[03:46:23.665 --> 03:46:26.588]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[03:46:26.588 --> 03:46:28.290]  That sends chills up my spine.

[03:46:57.113 --> 03:46:59.734]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:12.981 --> 03:47:16.543]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:47:16.543 --> 03:47:21.146]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:21.146 --> 03:47:21.606]  All right.
[03:47:21.606 --> 03:47:23.987]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.987 --> 03:47:25.788]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:47:25.788 --> 03:47:28.050]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:47:28.050 --> 03:47:38.856]  I was talking about in the last segment, I was talking about how Cory Booger and the rest of these Democrats are attacking white people and they're not hiding it any longer.
[03:47:38.856 --> 03:47:40.537]  I mean, it's like the playbook.
[03:47:41.436 --> 03:47:44.142]  The CNN is using the same playbook.
[03:47:44.142 --> 03:47:46.486]  All the liberal media is using the same playbook.
[03:47:46.486 --> 03:47:50.274]  And you have to wonder, why are they attacking white people like this?
[03:47:51.255 --> 03:48:01.526]  And since I really started recognizing how they're attacking white people like this, I come to realize that the Democrats are the common denominator.
[03:48:01.526 --> 03:48:13.219]  How back in the day, when you have black people out protesting against white Democrats trying to keep them from having civil rights, et cetera, et cetera, it was Democrats that hosed down black people in the street.
[03:48:14.722 --> 03:48:22.265]  2019, the Democrats again are doing the same thing, but yet they want to do it to white people.
[03:48:22.265 --> 03:48:32.148]  I mean, it's like it's never ending vicious cycle with the Democrats and they want black people to be under their thumb.
[03:48:32.148 --> 03:48:44.092]  And when black people decide to start leaving the Democrat party, I've had conversations with people on social media, white liberals, black liberals, and for some reason, especially white liberals, they act like
[03:48:44.853 --> 03:48:47.415]  They have lost some property.
[03:48:47.415 --> 03:48:51.097]  And these black people are starting attacking me because I'm leaving.
[03:48:51.097 --> 03:48:53.338]  I've left the Democrat Party.
[03:48:53.338 --> 03:48:55.179]  I mean, isn't that the point?
[03:48:55.179 --> 03:48:57.261]  You're supposed to be a free thinker.
[03:48:57.261 --> 03:49:00.022]  But see, according to them, that is the problem.
[03:49:00.022 --> 03:49:03.404]  You can't think for yourself, not in this country.
[03:49:03.404 --> 03:49:07.787]  If you're black, you have to think the way the Democrats want you to think.
[03:49:07.787 --> 03:49:09.268]  And how despicable is that?
[03:49:09.904 --> 03:49:11.425]  And they know it!
[03:49:11.425 --> 03:49:15.227]  And you know what, they don't even say, they don't say, no that's not the case.
[03:49:15.227 --> 03:49:17.529]  We want you to think for yourself.
[03:49:17.529 --> 03:49:20.651]  I've yet to hear them say, we want you to think for yourself.
[03:49:22.330 --> 03:49:23.951]  I've yet to hear them say that.
[03:49:23.951 --> 03:49:26.673]  Now they might come out and start saying it now, but do they mean it?
[03:49:26.673 --> 03:49:28.374]  I really don't believe them.
[03:49:28.374 --> 03:49:29.555]  I really don't.
[03:49:29.555 --> 03:49:36.220]  I don't believe anything Democrats say and never in my life again will I ever, ever vote for a Democrat.
[03:49:36.220 --> 03:49:41.864]  I will vote for a crooked Republican over a good Democrat any day now.
[03:49:41.864 --> 03:49:48.789]  And it's just the way it is because the Democrats, their policies and their beliefs, they don't have any morals.
[03:49:48.789 --> 03:49:50.410]  That's why they attacked President Trump.
[03:49:50.410 --> 03:49:51.811]  You remember the whole sex tape?
[03:49:52.560 --> 03:49:54.461]  Grab them, you know?
[03:49:54.461 --> 03:50:01.746]  They only released that because they were like, oh, are you going to still support President Trump because he said that?
[03:50:01.746 --> 03:50:02.987]  You're a conservative Christian.
[03:50:02.987 --> 03:50:04.047]  You're supposed to have morals.
[03:50:04.047 --> 03:50:06.129]  You're supposed to condemn it now.
[03:50:06.129 --> 03:50:09.050]  See, they forget that we understand.
[03:50:09.050 --> 03:50:10.732]  Christ died for all of us.
[03:50:10.732 --> 03:50:12.893]  See, that's the part they don't realize.
[03:50:12.893 --> 03:50:15.675]  Democrats can't wrap their mind around that.
[03:50:15.675 --> 03:50:18.857]  So we know that President Trump is not a perfect man.
[03:50:18.857 --> 03:50:19.837]  We know that.
[03:50:19.837 --> 03:50:20.818]  Okay, but I digress.
[03:50:21.437 --> 03:50:32.487]  Let's get talking about how New Zealand and how the Democrats are pushing this whole thing about white supremacists and the racists are trying to take over America.
[03:50:32.487 --> 03:50:34.349]  They're trying to take over the world.
[03:50:34.349 --> 03:50:36.991]  White supremacists now they're attacking black people.
[03:50:36.991 --> 03:50:39.293]  They're attacking Asian people.
[03:50:39.293 --> 03:50:40.855]  They're attacking Hispanic people.
[03:50:40.855 --> 03:50:41.856]  Build the wall.
[03:50:41.856 --> 03:50:44.859]  They're attacking Muslims now, which is not true.
[03:50:45.659 --> 03:50:46.900]  None of it's true.
[03:50:46.900 --> 03:50:50.521]  But for some reason, they are happy to promote it that way.
[03:50:50.521 --> 03:50:55.582]  And for some reason, people are still naive to believe every word that they're saying.
[03:50:55.582 --> 03:50:57.603]  And I don't understand it.
[03:50:57.603 --> 03:50:59.264]  I really don't.
[03:50:59.264 --> 03:51:05.626]  I mean, even when I considered myself a Democrat, I didn't have all this hatred for white people.
[03:51:05.626 --> 03:51:12.528]  Because see, the Democrats, they have us to believe that white people in the Democrat Party are for us.
[03:51:12.528 --> 03:51:13.228]  But it's not.
[03:51:13.228 --> 03:51:14.849]  This can't be further from the truth.
[03:51:15.865 --> 03:51:17.845]  And I don't understand it.
[03:51:17.845 --> 03:51:18.646]  I really don't.
[03:51:18.646 --> 03:51:20.806]  I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it.
[03:51:20.806 --> 03:51:34.269]  I guess because when I woke up to it, then I started going like, man, I can't even understand how I used to support the Democrat Party, knowing how they were doing us, seeing how they've done black people.
[03:51:34.269 --> 03:51:36.910]  And now I see they're doing it to Hispanics.
[03:51:36.910 --> 03:51:42.531]  And now the Jewish community, they see them doing it to the Jewish community.
[03:51:43.777 --> 03:51:46.859]  And they see it, and it's happening.
[03:51:46.859 --> 03:51:56.783]  So, the whole thing with them coming out talking about white supremacists, AOC doing it, where are all the politicians denouncing this?
[03:51:56.783 --> 03:52:01.766]  Where are the politicians coming out saying, no, we really know that's not the case?
[03:52:01.766 --> 03:52:04.047]  Where are they saying it?
[03:52:04.047 --> 03:52:10.830]  Here's a screenshot that I took of Dan Crenshaw, and I really have mad respect for this gentleman.
[03:52:10.830 --> 03:52:12.391]  Here's a screenshot from his tweet.
[03:52:12.961 --> 03:52:32.253]  And he goes on to say, if you find yourself using the tragedy in New Zealand to take a backhanded swipe at conservatives in America, many of my colleagues already have, then you have no shame and you are part of the problem.
[03:52:32.253 --> 03:52:41.058]  It should be easy for us to stand united and condemn terrorism.
[03:52:41.058 --> 03:52:41.799]  Right?
[03:52:41.799 --> 03:52:41.999]  Right?
[03:52:42.853 --> 03:52:44.954]  We all should stand united and condemn terrorism.
[03:52:44.954 --> 03:52:52.296]  No one is condoning the killing of innocent people, even if you disagree in their beliefs.
[03:52:52.296 --> 03:52:54.576]  No one's condoning that.
[03:52:54.576 --> 03:53:00.938]  To go back to Charlottesville, President Trump did not condone the killing of the young lady that took place there.
[03:53:00.938 --> 03:53:01.998]  Not at all.
[03:53:01.998 --> 03:53:07.760]  But see, the left, they can't wrap their mind around it that he said something positive about the people on the right.
[03:53:10.568 --> 03:53:11.889]  They can't wrap their mind around it.
[03:53:11.889 --> 03:53:14.331]  They can't understand it.
[03:53:14.331 --> 03:53:16.112]  I don't understand it.
[03:53:16.112 --> 03:53:19.314]  How they can't understand logic.
[03:53:19.314 --> 03:53:22.156]  How is it they don't understand reality any longer?
[03:53:22.156 --> 03:53:26.699]  The left, they hate reality.
[03:53:26.699 --> 03:53:32.263]  And without going into great detail, they are trying to change the mind of children.
[03:53:33.883 --> 03:53:37.845]  And all this relates back to, my opinion, to white supremacy.
[03:53:37.845 --> 03:53:43.907]  They want to get rid of white people because the majority of the white people in this country happen to be Christians.
[03:53:43.907 --> 03:53:45.508]  That's what it ultimately comes down to.
[03:53:45.508 --> 03:53:55.352]  And Christian, the number one reason why they're attacking white people, that's my opinion, because other than white people being soft targets, because not enough white people don't say anything.
[03:53:55.352 --> 03:53:56.413]  And that runs all through me.
[03:53:57.600 --> 03:54:01.963]  Because white people, they're called racists, racism and everything else.
[03:54:01.963 --> 03:54:05.826]  They're called a racist and they don't say anything.
[03:54:05.826 --> 03:54:06.967]  That runs off through me.
[03:54:06.967 --> 03:54:10.490]  I take it personal because white people don't say enough to say, stop.
[03:54:10.490 --> 03:54:13.913]  You're the one that's racist because you're saying that about me.
[03:54:13.913 --> 03:54:23.040]  I've never done anything to give you any kind of notion or idea that I'm racist simply because I'm white and you're calling me that or because I support President Trump.
[03:54:23.040 --> 03:54:24.381]  You're the one that's racist.
[03:54:24.381 --> 03:54:25.622]  White people need to say that.
[03:54:27.196 --> 03:54:30.278]  It's a pet peeve of mine, because I'm a black male.
[03:54:30.278 --> 03:54:31.299]  I don't want it happening.
[03:54:31.299 --> 03:54:34.821]  Martin Luther King didn't want it happening, and I don't want it happening.
[03:54:34.821 --> 03:54:39.204]  As an American citizen, we all shouldn't want it to happen.
[03:54:39.204 --> 03:54:41.285]  But they're doing it.
[03:54:41.285 --> 03:54:44.788]  They're absolutely doing it.
[03:54:44.788 --> 03:54:48.650]  Okay, we're almost at the end here, and I want to say this.
[03:54:48.650 --> 03:54:55.835]  It's been an extreme honor to come on here and talk about the different things that's taking place in this country.
[03:54:56.798 --> 03:54:59.079]  The different events that's taking place.
[03:54:59.079 --> 03:55:00.179]  And it's true.
[03:55:00.179 --> 03:55:03.160]  InfoWars is at the tip of the spear.
[03:55:03.160 --> 03:55:08.321]  And it's so important to fund InfoWars.com.
[03:55:08.321 --> 03:55:09.982]  I mean, we've got to.
[03:55:09.982 --> 03:55:13.482]  This is how we fight the enemy.
[03:55:13.482 --> 03:55:18.744]  By you going to InfoWarsStore.com, you contribute to the fight.
[03:55:19.480 --> 03:55:22.521]  You don't have, if you're, a lot of people are scared to use their voice.
[03:55:22.521 --> 03:55:29.683]  A lot of people are scared to go out and do videos because they're afraid of their friends and family attacking them.
[03:55:29.683 --> 03:55:30.963]  I've lost family.
[03:55:30.963 --> 03:55:35.684]  I've lost friends of 20 plus years because I show my support for president Trump.
[03:55:35.684 --> 03:55:39.465]  That doesn't mean I'm going to stop because it's the right thing to do.
[03:55:39.465 --> 03:55:42.846]  Go to Infowarsstore.com today.
[03:55:42.846 --> 03:55:46.947]  When you go to Infowarsstore.com, you help people like me.
[03:55:46.947 --> 03:55:48.628]  I'm a black male with dreadlocks.
[03:55:49.798 --> 03:55:55.299]  Can you imagine how the left feels about me being on InfoWars.com?
[03:55:55.299 --> 03:55:56.139]  Think about that.
[03:55:56.139 --> 03:55:59.160]  They've already tried to say InfoWars is racist.
[03:55:59.160 --> 03:56:00.160]  Really?
[03:56:00.160 --> 03:56:00.580]  Really?
[03:56:00.580 --> 03:56:09.482]  All the people that I've come in contact with at InfoWars have been one of the best group of people that I've ever come across.
[03:56:09.482 --> 03:56:11.023]  And it's not that they need me.
[03:56:11.023 --> 03:56:12.343]  They don't.
[03:56:12.343 --> 03:56:14.163]  See, that's the point.
[03:56:14.163 --> 03:56:16.364]  They're doing this because they love this country.
[03:56:17.526 --> 03:56:22.667]  I'm here because they know I love this country and they know that I'm going to fight for this country.
[03:56:22.667 --> 03:56:26.709]  And I'm going to fight for the people in this country.
[03:56:26.709 --> 03:56:33.170]  And one of the things that you can do is go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:56:33.170 --> 03:56:35.411]  Get the TurboForce.
[03:56:35.411 --> 03:56:36.191]  I have my box.
[03:56:36.191 --> 03:56:39.952]  I keep it right here because I talk about it all the time.
[03:56:39.952 --> 03:56:41.893]  TurboForce is great.
[03:56:42.921 --> 03:56:48.522]  You know what, the next time I go out, when I go to these rallies and stuff, I'm going to take my turbo force with me.
[03:56:48.522 --> 03:56:55.063]  And I may, I have a whole box and I may share a couple with some people just so they'll know, so they'll understand.
[03:56:55.063 --> 03:56:58.404]  If you come to a rally that I'm at, I may have a packet for you.
[03:56:58.404 --> 03:57:03.405]  But anyways, the year 2020 is coming.
[03:57:03.405 --> 03:57:06.385]  They're demonizing white people because of President Trump.
[03:57:06.385 --> 03:57:11.066]  They're demonizing all of us that support the president.
[03:57:11.940 --> 03:57:18.106]  And it's becoming to a point to where we have to realize that we're in this battle together.
[03:57:18.106 --> 03:57:21.490]  We're in this spiritual war together.
[03:57:21.490 --> 03:57:23.512]  We have to stand up and unite together.
[03:57:24.378 --> 03:57:26.300]  I want to thank everybody for watching.
[03:57:26.300 --> 03:57:27.781]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:57:27.781 --> 03:57:29.162]  UnitesAmericaFirst.com.
[03:57:29.162 --> 03:57:32.104]  This is InfoWars.com.
[03:57:32.104 --> 03:57:34.026]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:34.026 --> 03:57:35.246]  Get in the fight!
[03:57:35.246 --> 03:57:36.327]  Get in the fight!
[03:57:36.327 --> 03:57:39.670]  Don't let them tell you otherwise.
[03:57:39.670 --> 03:57:40.631]  I can't even get it.
[03:57:40.631 --> 03:57:41.431]  Get in the fight.
[03:57:41.431 --> 03:57:43.393]  Just get in the fight.
[03:57:43.393 --> 03:57:46.295]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[03:57:46.295 --> 03:57:48.276]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[03:57:48.276 --> 03:57:51.199]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[03:57:51.199 --> 03:57:53.921]  InfoWars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[03:57:54.520 --> 03:57:57.621]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[03:57:57.621 --> 03:57:59.162]  I didn't invent all this.
[03:57:59.162 --> 03:58:05.744]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[03:58:05.744 --> 03:58:08.525]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[03:58:09.588 --> 03:58:12.929]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[03:58:12.929 --> 03:58:15.850]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[03:58:15.850 --> 03:58:17.550]  That sends chills up my spine.
[03:58:17.550 --> 03:58:31.094]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
