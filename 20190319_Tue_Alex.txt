[00:00.000 --> 00:28.000]  I'm going to air this special report because they are banning YouTube channels that report
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  on the pedophile that teaches your children in Houston.
[00:31.000 --> 00:32.000]  They're trying to protect them.
[00:32.000 --> 00:35.440]  Here's what Google is protecting right now.
[00:35.440 --> 00:39.280]  I don't want to give away our game plan, but it just metaphysically I feel like I always
[00:39.280 --> 00:44.880]  have to because these pedos can't help themselves, but I still have to warn them because I don't
[00:44.880 --> 00:49.320]  want to entrap them even though I'm not bringing the kids to them.
[00:49.320 --> 00:52.160]  Still, I want them to know we're watching.
[00:52.160 --> 00:59.280]  If law enforcement's controlled or being blocked, we're not and we're legally and lawfully
[00:59.280 --> 01:06.240]  going to be investigating all of these drag queen festivals that are in public spaces.
[01:06.240 --> 01:09.880]  Whether they're in public schools, whether they're in libraries, whether they're in hotels,
[01:09.880 --> 01:10.880]  we're going to be watching you.
[01:10.880 --> 01:12.880]  In fact, I've made a full commitment.
[01:12.880 --> 01:16.840]  We've already done some funding on this in the last year.
[01:16.840 --> 01:25.920]  We're seeing that pay off in Houston with a hardcore child rapist who was leading operations
[01:25.920 --> 01:30.920]  against children as young as two with the knowing accomplices in the government of Houston,
[01:30.920 --> 01:37.680]  which is now a pedo command base, and I have that from the U.S. Army federal law enforcement.
[01:37.680 --> 01:38.760]  You name it.
[01:38.760 --> 01:40.520]  Very dangerous city now.
[01:40.520 --> 01:41.520]  Very evil.
[01:41.520 --> 01:45.720]  Doesn't mean all the police are bad, but it's in trouble.
[01:45.720 --> 01:51.560]  This is Albert Garza, a registered child sex offender convicted in 2008 for molesting an
[01:51.560 --> 01:53.440]  eight-year-old boy.
[01:53.440 --> 01:59.320]  This is also him, Tatiana Malaninha, his drag queen alter ego.
[01:59.320 --> 02:03.720]  This is who's been reading the kids at Houston Public Libraries since last year.
[02:03.720 --> 02:06.760]  Shame on these individuals in this building behind me.
[02:06.760 --> 02:11.560]  Mass resistance claims it's been asking the city for months to disclose information about
[02:11.560 --> 02:12.560]  the drag queens.
[02:12.560 --> 02:18.000]  And when requests went unanswered, they did their own digging and made the shocking link.
[02:18.000 --> 02:23.800]  If they had done their job in due diligence, if they had said, wait, maybe not a good idea
[02:23.800 --> 02:32.320]  to have a sex offender who at 200 pounds and five foot 11 assaulted an eight-year-old boy.
[02:32.320 --> 02:37.880]  A statement from the Houston Public Library says in part, we failed to complete a background
[02:37.880 --> 02:40.560]  check as required by our own guidelines.
[02:40.560 --> 02:42.760]  We deeply regret this oversight.
[02:42.760 --> 02:51.400]  So parents would not allow that individual to sit in this library, sashay in, and be
[02:51.400 --> 02:53.640]  held up as a role model to our children.
[02:53.640 --> 02:58.440]  The group in question, the so-called sisters of perpetual indulgence, is sending a message
[02:58.440 --> 03:06.080]  that they have the power to enter into the public domain, a publicly funded institution,
[03:06.080 --> 03:13.020]  and I believe not a private one, and to essentially hold a catechism class for this new religion
[03:13.020 --> 03:16.920]  that they've created, a religion of hedonism, of self-indulgence.
[03:16.920 --> 03:21.080]  Sisters of perpetual indulgence say a religion of licentiousness.
[03:21.080 --> 03:28.640]  The Achilles heel of these, quote, drag queen events being held from Germany to England
[03:28.640 --> 03:35.480]  to the United States to Canada, all choreographed exactly the same, run by the same group.
[03:35.480 --> 03:38.520]  Promoted by mainstream media.
[03:38.520 --> 03:43.840]  All you gotta do is go, and all you gotta do is pick out the obvious creepoids, including
[03:43.840 --> 03:48.840]  those involved, and all you gotta do is go get their license plate, or if you got the
[03:48.840 --> 03:52.640]  proper accreditation and law enforcement or private detectives, follow them home, even
[03:52.640 --> 03:53.640]  if they're on foot.
[03:53.640 --> 03:58.000]  People are like, don't tell them they're getting their plate numbers, we're not stupid.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.920]  I want them to know, I want them to stop it.
[04:00.920 --> 04:06.280]  The point is, is that how the pedophiles come after your kids, they dress up like women
[04:06.280 --> 04:08.280]  in disguises.
[04:08.280 --> 04:13.800]  My God, it's 101, Pitos dress up like clowns, or other things, so their identity's not known.
[04:13.800 --> 04:16.320]  This is out in the open.
[04:16.320 --> 04:20.280]  You don't just think this convicted child rapist in Houston, who was running the storytime
[04:20.280 --> 04:24.520]  for kids, not just by the way at libraries, it's going on public schools, you name it,
[04:24.520 --> 04:28.360]  the government's trying to cover it up, the local government is, it's all coming out.
[04:28.360 --> 04:30.880]  You don't just think he stops there.
[04:30.880 --> 04:37.680]  These people, like him, are the operatives, as I've told you, everything in Brand Stoker's
[04:37.680 --> 04:43.160]  books are allegories to how the elites actually operate.
[04:43.160 --> 04:48.480]  And you've got the Renfield that just wants to strangle kids and have sex with them and
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.960]  eat brooches and things, and then rats.
[04:52.960 --> 04:54.200]  But who's he worked for?
[04:54.200 --> 05:00.400]  He works for the dragon.
[05:00.400 --> 05:04.560]  The globalist, the eugenicist, are always talking down to us.
[05:04.560 --> 05:09.280]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[05:09.280 --> 05:13.600]  They try to censor, because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access
[05:13.600 --> 05:17.200]  information so you can make your own decisions.
[05:17.200 --> 05:19.480]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[05:19.480 --> 05:25.680]  But the truth is, it is we, the people, and our ideas, and our actions, and what we say
[05:25.680 --> 05:31.920]  and what we do that changes the world, we are the power structure, we are the inventors,
[05:31.920 --> 05:37.120]  we are the trailblazers, and the globalists understand that.
[05:37.120 --> 05:42.400]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from
[05:42.400 --> 05:43.400]  we, the people.
[05:43.400 --> 05:48.920]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[05:48.920 --> 05:53.160]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half
[05:53.160 --> 05:58.160]  of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50%offinforrestore.com,
[05:58.160 --> 06:03.600]  something everybody should take advantage of.
[06:03.600 --> 06:10.320]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[06:10.320 --> 06:28.840]  the Info War.
[06:28.840 --> 06:33.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[06:33.440 --> 06:40.640]  The control corporate left all across this planet is launching massive total censorship,
[06:40.640 --> 06:46.000]  the dwarfs, anything that even happened to yours truly last year, we're going to be looking
[06:46.000 --> 06:47.760]  at all of it today.
[06:47.760 --> 06:58.840]  Also, the dictator of Turkey has said we will fill body bags full of New Zealanders and
[06:58.840 --> 07:02.720]  Australians, just like we have before.
[07:02.720 --> 07:07.360]  That's the Islamic response is for him to play the massacre on TV and say, we're going
[07:07.360 --> 07:10.560]  to conquer the planet, Islam's going to dominate.
[07:10.560 --> 07:11.560]  And why not?
[07:11.560 --> 07:17.000]  The media covers up all the Islamic murder, it's thousands of times what the scumbag did.
[07:17.000 --> 07:22.160]  They only humanized Muslims because that's part of the plan.
[07:22.160 --> 07:23.640]  Who else is being dehumanized?
[07:23.640 --> 07:30.720]  A bizarre guardian writer suggests white people aren't human in a new tweet.
[07:30.720 --> 07:37.440]  We should probably get a job as the, on the board of directors of the New York Times.
[07:37.440 --> 07:38.800]  So that's just some of what we've got.
[07:38.800 --> 07:41.320]  Also jail time for the Zabruder film.
[07:41.320 --> 07:46.120]  If you shot that film today and showed it like we did of Kennedy being killed, why you'd
[07:46.120 --> 07:51.160]  go to jail according to the censors, trying to censor the video of the massacre.
[07:51.160 --> 07:52.160]  Why are they doing that?
[07:52.160 --> 07:53.680]  Because it's all about censorship.
[07:53.680 --> 07:59.920]  Speaking of censorship, we had a special report we shot live Sunday about the convicted
[07:59.920 --> 08:07.160]  child rapist leading story time for kids under Houston city funding.
[08:07.160 --> 08:12.760]  And YouTube said that that is not allowed and took down a fan channel that we were working
[08:12.760 --> 08:17.240]  with on the resistance news that had tens of millions of views.
[08:17.240 --> 08:22.720]  And so there you go, ladies and gentlemen, Pito Library Predators get their due.
[08:22.720 --> 08:23.720]  That's not allowed.
[08:23.720 --> 08:28.640]  I'm telling you, Rob, it was your Sunday, he said, he said, he said, if our fan channels
[08:28.640 --> 08:35.840]  post this Pito report, these channels will be taken down.
[08:35.840 --> 08:42.480]  I said, I know, but I said, let's go ahead and call the administrators of the fan channels
[08:42.480 --> 08:43.760]  when I'm here in Austin.
[08:43.760 --> 08:49.480]  That was the resistance news that up a while, a couple of years.
[08:49.480 --> 08:50.480]  And they agreed.
[08:50.480 --> 08:52.480]  They said, no, let's do what's right.
[08:52.480 --> 08:54.680]  But but we knew.
[08:54.680 --> 08:55.680]  We knew.
[08:55.680 --> 09:00.360]  Don't expose 200 pound men, raping children.
[09:00.360 --> 09:05.360]  That is the religion, the sacrament of Google.
[09:05.360 --> 09:08.240]  I'm telling you, you don't touch the Pitos.
[09:08.240 --> 09:11.680]  They are God.
[09:11.680 --> 09:17.240]  So later in the broadcast, I'm going to go over all of it.
[09:17.240 --> 09:24.280]  I'm going to show you the YouTube channels of convicted killers with small children saying
[09:24.280 --> 09:26.360]  you're about to do some obscene things.
[09:26.360 --> 09:29.720]  Bring your children close to the television set.
[09:29.720 --> 09:32.560]  And they talk about drugging children.
[09:32.560 --> 09:33.560]  And why not?
[09:33.560 --> 09:38.440]  The fellow on the video, before he went to prison, launched the kid club movement back
[09:38.440 --> 09:42.400]  in the club kid movement back in the nineties.
[09:42.400 --> 09:51.920]  That's all about sex with underage children, all about roofing, all about ketamine.
[09:51.920 --> 09:55.680]  You have the kids on TV talking about taking ketamine.
[09:55.680 --> 10:01.200]  It's all about the ketamine.
[10:01.200 --> 10:02.200]  So there you go.
[10:02.200 --> 10:03.800]  They're going to march right into your schools.
[10:03.800 --> 10:05.480]  They're going to march right into your churches.
[10:05.480 --> 10:07.640]  They're going to march right in everywhere.
[10:07.640 --> 10:13.960]  That Google article up on infowars.com, dailycaller.com.
[10:13.960 --> 10:18.600]  Their employees complained about a Christian pro marriage ad that was running.
[10:18.600 --> 10:25.640]  And so it was pulled because the disease of San Francisco and the disease of the left
[10:25.640 --> 10:29.440]  is spreading through the bloodstream of the planet right now.
[10:29.440 --> 10:36.960]  And it's not going to let you ever resist it unless you actually totally resist.
[10:36.960 --> 10:42.080]  They're all trying to bully everybody and teach you to submit right now.
[10:42.080 --> 10:43.080]  Amazing.
[10:43.080 --> 10:51.400]  So the only way to stand up for the children, the unborn, you name it, is to tell people
[10:51.400 --> 10:58.240]  about the local radio station you're listening to and support those local stations and rebuild
[10:58.240 --> 11:05.120]  community local media that's just based in common sense and based in values that work
[11:05.120 --> 11:11.600]  and create healthy, happy civilizations, not the unhappy, drugged out, mentally ill Silicon
[11:11.600 --> 11:16.240]  Valley system of the new royalty.
[11:16.240 --> 11:21.160]  And you tell folks about newswars.com and you tell folks about infowars.com and you've
[11:21.160 --> 11:22.160]  been doing it.
[11:22.160 --> 11:25.200]  And you tell people about, hey, you heard a lot of bad stuff about Alex Jones.
[11:25.200 --> 11:28.080]  Why don't you go find out what he's actually saying?
[11:28.080 --> 11:29.640]  And they come and they find it.
[11:29.640 --> 11:33.320]  People go, wow, this is incredible.
[11:33.320 --> 11:38.500]  We're going to show you them saying we're here to corrupt your children.
[11:38.500 --> 11:41.040]  You cannot stop us just like the Borg.
[11:41.040 --> 11:44.280]  We are here to assimilate you, resistance is futile.
[11:44.280 --> 11:51.520]  You're going to see grown men going, we are going to get your kids, your children are
[11:51.520 --> 11:55.600]  ours and then trophying little boys on TV.
[11:55.600 --> 12:04.720]  I'm going, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, they're Oz now, they're rubbing it in your face.
[12:04.720 --> 12:09.040]  We're going to dress up scarier than at the clown and then we're going to come and we
[12:09.040 --> 12:12.360]  are going to run your child's life.
[12:12.360 --> 12:29.240]  We want your soul, ha, ha, ha, ha, corrupt the child, destroy them all.
[12:29.240 --> 12:33.680]  And they come to the city councils and they say, we are grooming our children, they are
[12:33.680 --> 12:34.680]  ours.
[12:34.680 --> 12:39.800]  And the parents go, ha, ha, ha, don't you run your mouth and mine, I'll get you and
[12:39.800 --> 12:41.280]  your little dog too.
[12:41.280 --> 12:47.200]  These things must be done, damn, look at me.
[12:47.200 --> 12:54.540]  Oh, and the, I got an email from the Huffington Post breathlessly.
[12:54.540 --> 12:58.600]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, there's a YouTube channel, is it yours?
[12:58.600 --> 13:02.360]  Which it wasn't, they got that one taken down too.
[13:02.360 --> 13:07.760]  saying it's a false flag, the shooting didn't happen. This is horrible. Didn't say that
[13:07.760 --> 13:17.880]  in the video, a witch? You fabricator? I want to challenge this witch to come on. I said
[13:17.880 --> 13:22.760]  the shooting happened. He says in the manifesto he's done it to trigger a giant war between
[13:22.760 --> 13:26.520]  different groups. When you stage something to trigger a larger event that's blamed on
[13:26.520 --> 13:31.440]  other groups, that's the definition of the oldest form of false flag. I was reporting
[13:31.440 --> 13:38.040]  on Rush Limbaugh saying that. Hell, Obama's head professor at Harvard, I never played
[13:38.040 --> 13:42.000]  the clip yesterday, I will later when I played this hour, he came out and said he thinks
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.200]  Trump will stage a crisis or event to stay in office. By the way, I don't agree that
[13:47.200 --> 13:51.480]  Trump's going to try that, but governments have done that, so it's very reasonable to
[13:51.480 --> 14:01.560]  look at any event and say that. By the way, the helping of Post holds out the idea that
[14:01.560 --> 14:07.040]  I'm banned from the public square, from city council, from anybody else's YouTube show.
[14:07.040 --> 14:11.060]  All because they falsely took down our channel with three fake strikes, they've now created
[14:11.060 --> 14:16.280]  the perceived notion that no one can have our content on YouTube and then they execute
[14:16.280 --> 14:25.280]  it according to that idea. Fraud based on fraud, based on lies. And what was it that
[14:25.280 --> 14:34.120]  got it taken down? They tell us here, we've got the YouTube emails, I'll show you later.
[14:34.120 --> 14:41.320]  Why you talk bad about the drag queens? Yeah, the convicted one, the child rape. I'm sorry
[14:41.320 --> 14:51.920]  I tried to keep your priest from his quarry, from his sacrament. Yeah, that's right. I
[14:51.920 --> 14:58.120]  did do it. And I played the rest limbo saying this guy says he wants to cause a civil war,
[14:58.120 --> 15:02.880]  he says he's a leftist and he goes out and does this. Is this a false flag? That's a
[15:02.880 --> 15:07.040]  normal question to ask, but you don't want normal questions to be asked and you want
[15:07.040 --> 15:12.320]  to silence everything while you tell Congress that nothing's being silenced. Incredible
[15:12.320 --> 15:20.800]  liars. But it doesn't matter, dirtbags, because info wars.com and news wars.com is still there.
[15:20.800 --> 15:27.480]  And we're going to do our longest emergency transmission this Thursday, 8am until Saturday,
[15:27.480 --> 15:33.240]  10am, an emergency summit on the censorship globally and how to counter it to develop
[15:33.240 --> 15:41.000]  with top guests, experts, calls, everybody, a plan to put forward a manifesto, a blueprint
[15:41.000 --> 15:48.080]  of resistance to the censorship. Will it mean our own yellow vest movement here, but not
[15:48.080 --> 15:54.000]  going after the government, but legally lawfully and camping outside Google, Facebook and Twitter?
[15:54.000 --> 16:01.000]  We're going to develop the plan. It all launches this Thursday morning. Maybe not today, maybe
[16:01.000 --> 16:07.000]  not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive. Forget bunkers, you're
[16:07.000 --> 16:12.240]  not a live underground gopher. You need survivalist camps, the ultimate fully functional off the
[16:12.240 --> 16:16.560]  grid mobile survival bug outhouse that's well equipped and custom built to outlast any
[16:16.560 --> 16:22.880]  other RV or trailer. Bold statement, you bet. See them now at survivalist camps dot com.

[17:30.960 --> 17:36.200]  claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us
[17:36.200 --> 17:42.440]  against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left
[17:42.440 --> 17:48.880]  England broken. Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote?
[17:48.880 --> 17:54.920]  Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire
[17:54.920 --> 18:02.280]  by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books. Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough
[18:02.280 --> 18:08.160]  in modern medicine, introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new, natural
[18:08.160 --> 18:13.440]  way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus
[18:13.440 --> 18:20.280]  passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France
[18:20.280 --> 18:24.960]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and
[18:24.960 --> 18:30.120]  inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades
[18:30.120 --> 18:35.400]  later we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps
[18:35.400 --> 18:40.880]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not
[18:40.880 --> 18:45.640]  an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking
[18:45.640 --> 18:51.040]  the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[18:51.040 --> 18:56.820]  in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to InfoWarsLife.com and
[18:56.820 --> 19:02.240]  grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets. It's time to show them what a real alpha male

[20:03.420 --> 20:10.420]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:33.420 --> 20:39.360]  We've got a great audience that takes action. That's number one. But number two, when you
[20:39.360 --> 20:45.040]  fight the globalists, you learn what they're scared of and you learn what they protect.
[20:45.040 --> 20:49.800]  You learn what somebody loves. If you start going through their house and smashing stuff
[20:49.800 --> 20:53.280]  and they're not getting upset and you finally get to that one piece of art on the wall or
[20:53.280 --> 20:58.680]  that one vase, maybe grandma's ashes and you smash that on the ground and they get angry,
[20:58.680 --> 21:05.720]  you find out who they love. You criticize big old fat convicted pedophiles having their
[21:05.720 --> 21:15.840]  way with your children and they flip there. You know what? And we're dealing with a big
[21:15.840 --> 21:23.400]  old juicy pack of potbellied pedophiles. And as soon as everybody figures that out, we
[21:23.400 --> 21:30.400]  can start fixing stuff around here. Google is a bunch of devil worshiping pedophiles,
[21:30.400 --> 21:36.360]  period. They're spying on everything you do. They're selling all your data. They lie to
[21:36.360 --> 21:43.680]  Congress. They do whatever the hell they want and you ask why are they so bad? Who would
[21:43.680 --> 21:51.000]  set up giant surveillance systems and then lie for 15, 16, 17, 18? I guess they've been
[21:51.000 --> 21:57.160]  around 20-something years now. That's what Silicon Valley does. Its whole system is based
[21:57.160 --> 22:02.560]  on spying and sharing your data and gaming the system and screwing you over. And then
[22:02.560 --> 22:07.880]  they sit there and go, we're not. We never game anything. We never fix results. We never
[22:07.880 --> 22:18.240]  spy on anybody. Jeepers creepers. And then you wonder why they're abusing their power.
[22:18.240 --> 22:29.280]  They built this city. Not for rock and roll. Not to go to the stars. We built this city
[22:29.280 --> 22:37.480]  to rape your kids. We built this city to control your life. We built this city to do it creepily
[22:37.480 --> 22:41.360]  where you don't know we're doing it because we're a bunch of cowards like pedophiles.
[22:41.360 --> 22:47.040]  They're creepy. They're in disguises. They're hiding. They're administrators. They can dial
[22:47.040 --> 22:56.360]  into all your appliances. They can dial into your TV. They do whatever they want. And Congress
[22:56.360 --> 23:10.240]  sits there like a bunch of lobotomized possums. A bunch of jellyfish. And just, it sounds
[23:10.240 --> 23:17.600]  like green acres. Well, gee, I don't know how that you tell me you don't ever know nothing.
[23:17.600 --> 23:23.320]  And Clapper gets up before we've never spied on anyone in the US. The NSA, by the way,
[23:23.320 --> 23:28.320]  for at least 20 years, every phone call, every email was being recorded on record. It's in
[23:28.320 --> 23:35.920]  the Telecommunications Act of 96 codified in law. He's just like, we've never spied on
[23:35.920 --> 23:46.320]  one person. That's like saying Abraham Lincoln did not have a beard. The sun is not yellow.
[23:46.320 --> 23:53.240]  They're just practicing lying to you. But when you get around their precious and that's
[23:53.240 --> 23:59.120]  grotesque fat, ugly men, that's the religion, the ugliest stinking fat pedo you can get
[23:59.120 --> 24:06.240]  wallowing with your kids sitting in their lap being prepared. That's their religion. Disgustingness,
[24:06.240 --> 24:14.400]  ugliness, something beautiful being defiled. That's Satanism. You're having Satanism practice
[24:14.400 --> 24:24.600]  right out in front of you. And they think there's nothing you're going to do about it.
[24:24.600 --> 24:35.240]  It's a spirit. It's an operating system. And it's men framing women for pedophilic activity
[24:35.240 --> 24:43.440]  dressed up like women. How sick is that? How evil is that? And it's all the same spirit
[24:43.440 --> 24:55.400]  of light. But then in the real world, it's vicious and it's horrible. I'm going to stop
[24:55.400 --> 24:59.400]  right there. When we come back, I've got Paul Watson's incredible report. And then we're
[24:59.400 --> 25:05.080]  going to have Millie Weaver on the last segment of this hour into the next hour. She went
[25:05.080 --> 25:13.800]  and got again out of the park footage of Beto or Rourke saying he supports partial birth abortion
[25:13.800 --> 25:22.680]  and the crowd. I mean, look at the fake power trip. He's perfectly narcissistic, perfectly
[25:22.680 --> 25:28.680]  empty, ugly. Looks like somebody would run a funeral home, you know, like the undertaker's
[25:28.680 --> 25:34.280]  assistant. I mean, you certainly wouldn't stay in a bed and breakfast at the proprietor.
[25:34.280 --> 25:40.120]  You'd look like that. You'd say, man, that's a vampire. But he talks like this, like Bernie
[25:40.120 --> 25:48.120]  Sanders. I'm a common sense guy. I roll up my sleeves. Look at the cover of Texas Monthly
[25:48.120 --> 25:53.360]  and Esquire and everything else. He's out in the desert. He's coming out of the desert
[25:53.360 --> 26:00.320]  like a messiah. I already said it's a messiah complex. He goes, I was born to run. I'm going
[26:00.320 --> 26:15.680]  to run everything now. I'm the last great hope on earth when I'm not hit and run driving.
[26:15.680 --> 26:23.480]  I mean, this guy is a complete joke. We're going to get to that coming up and then all
[26:23.480 --> 26:30.600]  the rest of it. But just make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, I've been down a rabbit hole.
[26:30.600 --> 26:36.440]  I just have top generals and retired FBI agents say they're devil worshiping pedophiles running
[26:36.440 --> 26:42.160]  at all. And this is like 23, 24 years ago. I'm like, come on, really? Absolutely. That's
[26:42.160 --> 26:47.120]  what it's all about. And Ted Gunderson and all of them. And it turns out it's all true.
[26:47.120 --> 26:51.640]  And I'm just thinking these old guys have gone crazy. No, they weren't crazy. They do what
[26:51.640 --> 26:56.880]  they were talking about. Former head of Air Force weapons development, former head of
[26:56.880 --> 27:00.800]  the FBI in Southern California. The list goes on and on. And they all told me the exact
[27:00.800 --> 27:10.240]  same stories. And then my uncle, who was down in Guatemala, saw similar things. He didn't
[27:10.240 --> 27:23.520]  tell me what, but it was bad. And it was kids. It's the real deal, folks. It's the real deal.
[27:23.520 --> 27:28.600]  And you try to talk about it. You cover local news, busting them. They take you off Google
[27:28.600 --> 27:35.640]  because you don't touch Google's God. Google is powered by pedophilia. Google is powered
[27:35.640 --> 27:43.840]  by devil worship. Google is powered by drugs and evil. That's who they are. And they watch
[27:43.840 --> 27:49.720]  you and they watch your children in lifetime and they lick their lips and they run society
[27:49.720 --> 27:54.320]  and they're the technocrats and they're in charge and they believe that you are done
[27:54.320 --> 28:04.000]  and that you are powerless. Now, we're going to go to break and come back with Paul Joseph
[28:04.000 --> 28:11.880]  Watson's report. Please do not forget we have store-wide free shipping and we have all the

[28:28.920 --> 28:31.800]  lot of these are lost leaders, but I want you to see how great super blue fluoride-free

[28:47.240 --> 28:51.240]  50% off and everything else will stay there until they get ready to sell out. But thank
[28:51.240 --> 28:54.680]  you all for your support. These are great products at the same time. We're fighting
[28:54.680 --> 28:59.520]  pedophilia. When you purchase these products, you're fighting hardcore pedophile rings.

[31:04.560 --> 31:09.280]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[31:09.280 --> 31:15.640]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.

[34:41.060 --> 34:44.540]  battle plan and I know what the battle plan is gonna be not just lobbying
[34:44.540 --> 34:48.540]  Congress I'm just going to Congress not just writing reports exposing it but
[34:48.540 --> 34:53.380]  suing but suing right for the racketeering the collusion the lying to
[34:53.380 --> 34:59.660]  Congress the perjury the violations the terms of service but it goes further the
[34:59.660 --> 35:03.620]  racketeering and the stealing of data and the employees that admit they've
[35:03.620 --> 35:08.540]  stolen our data and all the project Veritas videos and others and then it's
[35:08.540 --> 35:11.820]  going to be infiltrating Google and Facebook and Twitter we already have
[35:11.820 --> 35:19.060]  infiltrators oh that door swings both ways and then a few other little tricks
[35:19.060 --> 35:22.740]  up our sleeves which of course Google and others will then stage false flags
[35:22.740 --> 35:27.060]  against themselves so that it makes it look bad to protest them I don't care

[35:58.140 --> 36:03.460]  energy of the children that's at the first 30 minutes the next hour and I was
[36:03.460 --> 36:06.660]  just talking to Robert Barnes and I meant to ask him to come on to talk about
[36:06.660 --> 36:13.180]  Nunez and his lawsuit $250 million against Twitter for the collusion but
[36:13.180 --> 36:17.980]  the New York Times is oh section 230 they're immune no Twitter and all them
[36:17.980 --> 36:25.220]  now in Google say they are publishers and are controlling content show strip
[36:25.220 --> 36:31.460]  them of 230 and Trump in his new NAFTA renegotiation gives them more power
[36:31.460 --> 36:35.060]  under 230 but don't worry it hasn't gone through Congress yet and we're gonna
[36:35.060 --> 36:43.100]  work like busy beavers busy little bvs to get rid of section 230 of course we
[36:43.100 --> 36:47.780]  don't really want to get rid of it but it'll force big tech to stop their evil
[36:47.780 --> 36:53.900]  satanic rampage sorry it does mean when pedophiles get busted in schools with
[36:53.900 --> 37:00.660]  kids that it'll come out I know that really upsets Google makes them cry all
[37:00.660 --> 37:08.380]  night long now I'm gonna get to Paul's report next segment I want to play a
[37:08.380 --> 37:12.500]  clip I talked about yesterday but I didn't get to of Obama's professor his
[37:12.500 --> 37:20.100]  head professor at Harvard and he said Trump may stage a crisis to stay in
[37:20.100 --> 37:26.860]  power now that's a reasonable thing to say I'm not saying Trump's bad I'm not
[37:26.860 --> 37:32.460]  saying Trump's gonna do that but this is what happens in governments and so so
[37:32.460 --> 37:40.100]  the fact that that type of stuff goes on is a reality so it's reasonable to
[37:40.100 --> 37:50.940]  discuss it that's professor tribe so we'll play that clip here it is elections
[37:50.940 --> 37:56.220]  happen every four years but sometimes some leaders much too dangerous to leave
[37:56.220 --> 38:04.580]  in power this may be such a case the fact is that by 2020 the amount of damage
[38:04.580 --> 38:10.420]  that will have been done to our rule of law to constitutional norms is very
[38:10.420 --> 38:15.660]  great and we can't count on his being voted out of office in 2020 he is
[38:15.660 --> 38:20.900]  sufficiently corrupt and will probably have enough help from not too friendly
[38:20.900 --> 38:28.060]  foreign powers Russia Saudi Arabia maybe Turkey so that we can't count on
[38:28.060 --> 38:34.340]  removing this guy by an election and in fact he may fabricate yet another so
[38:34.340 --> 38:39.620]  called national emergency to influence that now documents came out that Obama
[38:39.620 --> 38:43.540]  was actually looking at causing martial law with race riots we we broke the
[38:43.540 --> 38:48.180]  documents but admitted they were real so they want us off air it's stuff like
[38:48.180 --> 38:54.620]  that that they can't control so I'm not saying Trump's gonna do that and I
[38:54.620 --> 38:58.100]  disagree with this professor that that Trump's be removed under the 25th
[38:58.100 --> 39:02.020]  amendment we told you two years ago they try that the point is is that saying
[39:02.020 --> 39:06.460]  things like that is part of the political historical discourse so when I
[39:06.460 --> 39:11.700]  say it the media all freaks out and says I'm insane I'm a cook I'm nuts but he's
[39:11.700 --> 39:16.860]  basically saying Trump may stage a false flag to stay stay in power limbaugh came
[39:16.860 --> 39:21.140]  out and said this guy says he's a leftist you know that hates America and
[39:21.140 --> 39:25.080]  all this stuff and loves the chai comms a lot of folks are saying he staged it to
[39:25.080 --> 39:30.660]  get a big crisis going it's a false flag the dude said that it isn't the
[39:30.660 --> 39:36.380]  scumbag said that it isn't the type of false flag where the where where he
[39:36.380 --> 39:39.580]  didn't kill the people that's a different type of false like it's the
[39:39.580 --> 39:44.020]  false flag where you do it to blame someone you don't like this is a fact
[39:44.020 --> 39:49.660]  so why can't the left say it but we can't say it the truth is their whole
[39:49.660 --> 39:54.180]  rushing gates been proven to be a fraud now they've moved it on to other quote
[39:54.180 --> 39:57.540]  forms of corruption that's all a fraud when they're the globalists they're the
[39:57.540 --> 40:00.380]  ones getting rid of national sovereignty they're the ones that believe
[40:00.380 --> 40:05.340]  nation-state shouldn't exist they're the ones that say having a country's bad but
[40:05.340 --> 40:12.860]  then oh Trump's this foreigner Trump's in league with Erdogan he's in league with
[40:12.860 --> 40:21.780]  Putin Trump is less popular in Russia in Russian polls than Obama and one of
[40:21.780 --> 40:25.660]  the things Trump's done that is wrong is he's let all this neocon and left his
[40:25.660 --> 40:30.300]  lies about Russia have him put heavy weapons on their border nuclear weapons
[40:30.300 --> 40:35.540]  billions of dollars that he stabilized inside Russia real meddling in Russia and
[40:35.540 --> 40:39.900]  Russia's becoming a Christian free-market nation that wants to work with us
[40:39.900 --> 40:45.340]  does that mean I'm a Russophile never been to Russia but I've studied it and
[40:45.340 --> 40:50.660]  so Trump has been moved towards one of the most aggressive anti-russian
[40:50.660 --> 40:56.220]  stances in real politics not in his rhetoric oh I love Russia I'm your
[40:56.220 --> 41:03.660]  friend Russia all of that the Russians have figured out is absolute BS Trump is
[41:03.660 --> 41:09.660]  kicking the ribs in of Russia on energy and weapons and encirclement to bankrupt
[41:09.660 --> 41:14.220]  Russia so the oligarchs can come back in and kick the Christians around
[41:14.220 --> 41:21.780]  Trump's doing the wrong thing on that front and it's very very sad he's doing
[41:21.780 --> 41:25.660]  good things on many other fronts and you notice getting upset with Trump he
[41:25.660 --> 41:31.660]  suddenly saying okay I may take action I may take action and try to stop the
[41:31.660 --> 41:37.420]  censorship well you better you serve the Republic and look I love Trump I love
[41:37.420 --> 41:41.140]  a lot of what he's done I think he's a good guy but he's encircled by a bunch
[41:41.140 --> 41:44.980]  of insiders who think they're gonna make deals with the establishment that the
[41:44.980 --> 41:50.540]  establishment doesn't like you you didn't come from the establishment
[41:50.540 --> 41:57.100]  Trump is not the establishment Kushner's dad was not the establishment he got
[41:57.100 --> 42:03.540]  sent to prison Ivanka Trump's not the establishment you guys are trying to
[42:03.540 --> 42:06.940]  work with the establishment you didn't go through the butt sniffing and Harvard
[42:06.940 --> 42:10.460]  you didn't go through all the candy ashing you're not been part of their
[42:10.460 --> 42:15.820]  system you you Trump is self-made he's his own maverick they don't like
[42:15.820 --> 42:22.300]  mavericks they want to mount your hide to the wall and sit around drinking
[42:22.300 --> 42:27.900]  cocktails okay they want to mount my head on the wall this is what you call
[42:27.900 --> 42:34.980]  the needle weenie spirit the needle weenies you know they want your kids
[42:34.980 --> 42:38.260]  they can't have relationships with adults they want your kids it's a culture
[42:38.260 --> 42:45.020]  of the chicken you know what dimension the chicken sh dash T dimension always
[42:45.020 --> 42:48.700]  put on the chicken you know what goggles and then you can see like a
[42:48.700 --> 42:53.220]  globalist you got to put them on first and boy once you put them on then you
[42:53.220 --> 42:58.580]  figure out what a bunch of sacks of filthy freaking garbage these people are
[42:58.580 --> 43:03.500]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real
[43:03.500 --> 43:07.460]  drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the big
[43:07.460 --> 43:12.140]  island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[43:12.140 --> 43:17.660]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[43:17.660 --> 43:22.700]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[43:22.700 --> 43:28.260]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[43:28.260 --> 43:33.380]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[43:33.380 --> 43:37.700]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[43:37.700 --> 43:42.980]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as
[43:42.980 --> 43:48.940]  it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
[43:48.940 --> 43:53.180]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[43:53.180 --> 43:59.420]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it our
[43:59.420 --> 44:03.460]  grandparents great grandparents they canned food during the falls they have
[44:03.460 --> 44:08.500]  it during the winter and that's what I'm talking about in four store.com with

[46:11.460 --> 46:15.660]  globalist are obsessed with it trying to shut it down. I didn't invent all this I
[46:15.660 --> 46:19.740]  went and researched the Renaissance Americana and what really works for
[46:19.740 --> 46:23.580]  humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super
[46:23.580 --> 46:27.900]  popular like it's always been. That's why the globalists are trying to shut it
[46:27.900 --> 46:32.580]  down so desperately because we have the light in the dark of the night that
[46:32.580 --> 46:36.900]  since chills up my spine so whatever you do continue to support yourself and
[46:36.900 --> 46:40.740]  info wars by buying the great products and info wars store.com by spreading the
[46:40.740 --> 46:44.460]  articles by spreading the videos and by praying for this operation and for praying
[46:44.460 --> 46:48.820]  for this nation and the world for peace and discernment for myself and the whole
[46:48.820 --> 46:53.420]  info wars family. I want to thank all of you for what you've done because without
[46:53.420 --> 47:00.020]  you info wars is nothing. You are the info war and I salute you.
[47:00.020 --> 47:23.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the
[47:23.620 --> 47:31.940]  information war. It's Alex Jones. All right I want to give this powerful Paul Watson
[47:31.940 --> 47:36.580]  report then Millie Weaver's joining us with the exclusive video of Bito
[47:36.580 --> 47:41.060]  endorsing third trimester partial birth abortion and being cheered by the blood
[47:41.060 --> 47:46.100]  thirsty filthy Bitoites. They're worse than pedophiles actually want to kill
[47:46.100 --> 47:53.380]  children so they're Bitoites. It's like that governor up in Virginia we keep the
[47:53.380 --> 47:59.300]  little book as alive to get their goodies. We just we just don't count them
[47:59.300 --> 48:07.540]  as alive so that's all coming up. By the way Joe Rogan is either gonna be in
[48:07.540 --> 48:11.820]  studio Friday or we're gonna tape a podcast while he's here this weekend so
[48:11.820 --> 48:15.140]  look for that. Oh and I forgot that articles on info wars.com I didn't see
[48:15.140 --> 48:19.100]  that my info wars tab we just print that for me. Paul Joseph Watson article he's
[48:19.100 --> 48:24.100]  now a right-wing Nazi and they want him taken off the air is the left jealous
[48:24.100 --> 48:27.540]  and I've told Joe this man you do have the number one podcast his average
[48:27.540 --> 48:31.260]  podcast which is 10 million the one where I came on's over 35 million right
[48:31.260 --> 48:35.500]  now and counting he says it's probably the biggest ever I talked to him a few
[48:35.500 --> 48:38.780]  days ago he said it may be bigger than Elon Musk that was definitely his
[48:38.780 --> 48:45.620]  biggest and so how do they respond well he's a Nazi no Joe's pretty liberal
[48:45.620 --> 48:51.540]  wouldn't call him leftist but he has pro gun and pro hunting so there you go
[48:51.540 --> 48:56.100]  there you go we'll talk about that when he's in this weekend he's got the sold
[48:56.100 --> 49:01.860]  out comedy club get going on Austin cap city comedy club YouTube terminates
[49:01.860 --> 49:05.900]  account huff post hosting Alex Jones info wars of course they don't tell you
[49:05.900 --> 49:09.620]  but I have her email right here she contacted him Amy Russo and said what
[49:09.620 --> 49:13.980]  are you doing he says no one died this is hurtful didn't say that you dirty
[49:13.980 --> 49:20.660]  witch and I'd have a right to say that if I wanted to I said Rush Limbaugh says
[49:20.660 --> 49:26.260]  the guy's a leftist that did it to blame conservatives that's in the news and so
[49:26.260 --> 49:29.380]  didn't they again show five-year-old videos I've nothing to do with what I
[49:29.380 --> 49:32.860]  said and then they tattle the YouTube and they take the channel down for that
[49:32.860 --> 49:39.020]  and exposing pedophilia and it's a fan channel but we were working with them
[49:39.020 --> 49:43.060]  had like I don't want to exaggerate like 15 million views the last six months or
[49:43.060 --> 49:47.940]  so so they got rid of it and then they lie and say Jones says no one died at
[49:47.940 --> 49:52.700]  Christchurch no I explained that World War two started in Operation Gliwitz
[49:52.700 --> 50:00.140]  when the Nazis staged the attack on Poland on their own troops that's all I
[50:00.140 --> 50:07.420]  said I said the shooter says it's a false flag and Limbaugh says it's a false
[50:07.420 --> 50:11.260]  flag but learn what a false flag really is then I explained when you do the
[50:11.260 --> 50:15.340]  classic one is when you do something to get somebody else blamed that that's the
[50:15.340 --> 50:19.260]  classic one is to frame somebody it doesn't mean it didn't happen but they
[50:19.260 --> 50:24.420]  always confuse that but see you can't see the videos just hundreds of them
[50:24.420 --> 50:27.580]  were taken down you can't actually hear what I said you just get to hear it from
[50:27.580 --> 50:35.020]  the Huffington Post and then they don't quote or show you they don't show you
[50:35.020 --> 50:44.860]  any of what I said they show clips of me from like five years ago edited about
[50:44.860 --> 50:50.100]  Sandy Yuck and then say that means I'm saying this didn't happen
[50:51.340 --> 51:01.140]  Amy Russo a challenge Amy Russo to come on the air oh and they also lie here they
[51:01.140 --> 51:10.140]  said Jones is banned his content banned period no they took down some of our
[51:10.140 --> 51:15.900]  channels with fake strikes saying I beat a kid up wasn't true all these lies and
[51:15.900 --> 51:23.700]  then they went further then the media would say hey wait he was on local news
[51:23.700 --> 51:28.540]  take that down no one's allowed to talk to him well Charlie Manson could go on
[51:28.540 --> 51:32.940]  ABC news that they got Hitler on the Discovery Channel they let you hear what
[51:32.940 --> 51:36.780]  Hitler said but with me you're not supposed to hear it you're supposed to
[51:36.780 --> 51:42.940]  have them tell you but it says media matters reported on it on the channel
[51:42.940 --> 51:46.940]  George Soros's group and now it's been taken down they say the channel had at
[51:46.940 --> 51:53.580]  least 12 million views on it and 65,000 subscribers who aren't allowed to watch
[51:53.580 --> 51:57.180]  us they're going to tell you at the Huffington Post and George Soros is going
[51:57.180 --> 52:02.300]  to tell you what you're allowed to see in a video uploaded Monday and viewed by
[52:02.300 --> 52:05.940]  Huffington Post before the account's deletion Jones suggested the shooting at
[52:05.940 --> 52:10.060]  two mosques in which 50 people were killed were part of a stunt designed to
[52:10.060 --> 52:15.460]  stage something to blame somebody else or to get a desired political outcome yeah
[52:15.460 --> 52:21.020]  that's what Rush Limbaugh said it's a clip of Rush Limbaugh but if I wanted to
[52:21.020 --> 52:25.180]  say that no one died it's my right to say it or they did but I mean legitimately
[52:25.180 --> 52:29.460]  the guy says in his manifesto I want to cause a race war and I'm like are we
[52:29.460 --> 52:32.420]  going to give the guy what he wants and mainstream corporate media is pushing
[52:32.420 --> 52:35.700]  that so they don't want me to counter their narrative they just want to take
[52:35.700 --> 52:40.420]  me down I'll give them this though it's out of context but at least they gave
[52:40.420 --> 52:44.820]  you a quote normally there's not even a quote
[52:44.820 --> 52:55.460]  and then it goes on a caption below the bottom paid for media are pushing an
[52:55.460 --> 52:59.500]  anti-white American narrative while ignoring the decimation of Christians
[52:59.500 --> 53:03.220]  globally at a record pace all that's totally true you turn on the news it's
[53:03.220 --> 53:07.020]  like why it's inherently evil they're the devil my god's genetically they're bad
[53:07.020 --> 53:11.420]  we should exterminate them the video which was viewed more than 5,000 times
[53:11.420 --> 53:16.620]  promoted blatant Islamophobia I'm just was pointing out that thousands of
[53:16.620 --> 53:19.340]  churches blown up and that Islamic countries don't like Christians live
[53:19.340 --> 53:24.700]  at them as Jones implied Muslims celebrated Easter by committing acts of
[53:24.700 --> 53:29.260]  terrorism and he predicted violence would be seen this year's holiday it's
[53:29.260 --> 53:35.860]  not disputed that from Europe to Asia to the Middle East to Africa on Easter and
[53:35.860 --> 53:40.140]  Palm Sunday and Christmas they've got to post guards and put up checkpoints and
[53:40.140 --> 53:44.780]  things to block vehicles because truck bombs get rolled in or people show up
[53:44.780 --> 53:56.020]  with AK-47s think about that Jones said Muslims target Christians done done done
[53:56.020 --> 54:02.480]  Jones says 2 plus 2 equals 4 Jones says that swordfish live in the Atlantic
[54:02.480 --> 54:12.620]  Ocean Jones said that canaries are sometimes yellow Jones said his tongue

[54:20.340 --> 54:28.380]  live off oxygen that's parade on oxygen Jones said he's wearing a green and
[54:28.380 --> 54:35.400]  silver watch all of that is true this is true it says all the major media and
[54:35.400 --> 54:41.160]  crackdown on Jones but still the scourge is there like I'm some foreign
[54:41.160 --> 54:53.280]  dictator some country around Vietnam in 1969 1969 president Nixon has launched

[55:16.680 --> 55:21.560]  Jones said that questions get targeted by Muslims in proportionation in
[55:21.560 --> 55:31.040]  support the nation's toward in way more disproportionate level man you read

[1:00:13.560 --> 1:00:21.800]  from deep in the heart of FEMA region 6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's
[1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:25.280]  alex jones
[1:00:27.840 --> 1:00:32.560]  Jair Balzanaro has been meeting with Trump we've got a clip of that for you
[1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:37.280]  and then the only way we're joining us I never got to Paul Watson's report it's
[1:00:37.280 --> 1:00:41.440]  on info wars.com it's pretty powerful but right now let's go to the president of
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:44.920]  the United States with the president of Brazil two peas and a pod.
[1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:55.920]  Well we're looking at it very strongly we're very inclined to do that the
[1:00:55.920 --> 1:00:59.440]  relationship that we have right now with Brazil has never been better I think
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:03.200]  there was a lot of hostility with other presidents there's zero hostility with
[1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:07.600]  me and we will go we're going to look at that very very strongly in terms of
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:14.000]  whether it's NATO or it's something having to do with Alliance but we have a
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  great alliance with Brazil better than we've ever had before
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:48.720]  Brazil is working to offer the United States access to a rocket launch site
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:54.080]  in Brazil Americans will be able to go to Brazil without a visa what would you
[1:01:54.080 --> 1:01:59.840]  like president Balzanaro to get to Brazil to take to Brazil as a result of
[1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:04.160]  this visit. Well we have we're working on different military sites and military
[1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:10.280]  options we're working on visas and and going in a much easier fashion all of
[1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:14.800]  that is good I agree with that we need Brazilian women imported I think we're
[1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:19.240]  working on those things one of the big elements of the relationship is trade
[1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:24.920]  Brazil makes great product and we make great product and our trade has been
[1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:30.600]  never as good as it should be in the past and in some cases it should be far
[1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:34.880]  far more so I think our trade with Brazil will go substantially up in both
[1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:41.440]  directions and we look forward to that. I'm trying to block trade with Brazil.
[1:02:41.440 --> 1:03:09.440]  China's a lot of trade.
[1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:32.280]  We're talking about different things all options are on the table and it's a
[1:03:32.280 --> 1:03:36.840]  shame what's happening in Venezuela the the death and the destruction and the
[1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:41.800]  hunger hard to believe one of the wealthiest countries is now one of the
[1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:45.720]  poorest and most impoverished countries so we'll be talking about that in great
[1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:55.360]  length Venezuela we're gonna go to break Millie Weaver is gonna be coming on

[1:06:16.280 --> 1:06:31.040]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central we're here live to the dread
[1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:38.000]  of the globalist of the communist of the pedophiles of the AOCs the big
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:43.120]  corporate chiefs all the control freaks they can't stand the fact that
[1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:48.800]  Americana and the fact that the love of free market and the love of God and
[1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:54.000]  country and family is still alive beating in our breasts and our hearts and in
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:07:01.600]  our minds it's harder than it looks to take down the spirit of 1776 here's
[1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:06.160]  Mellie Weaver's report and she'll join us live she ran into the Lord and Savior
[1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:11.440]  the anointed one born to run the man from the wilderness with his billionaire
[1:07:11.440 --> 1:07:16.000]  wife and his father-in-law worth 28 billion dollars funding everything but
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:21.640]  he's a man of the people why he rolls up his sleeves so here's the report on
[1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:49.440]  beat oh you kill them you let them live so they can starve to death that's a liberal mindset for you kill the babies Millie weaver reporting for info wars.com we're here in Cleveland where 2020 presidential candidate Beto Rourke is scheduled to come speak Beto Rourke has been pretty hush about which policies he supports let's go
[1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:57.440]  see if we can nail down where he stands thank you for asking the question are you for
[1:07:57.440 --> 1:08:02.640]  third trimester abortions are are you going to protect the lives of third
[1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:07.840]  trimester babies because you know there's really not a medical necessity for
[1:08:07.840 --> 1:08:11.880]  abortion it's not a medical emergency procedure because typically third
[1:08:11.880 --> 1:08:16.560]  trimester abortions take up to three days to have so you would in that sense
[1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:21.200]  if there was an an emergency the doctors would just do a c-section and you don't
[1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:25.440]  have to kill the baby in that essence so are you for or against third trimester
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:31.360]  abortions so the question is about abortion and reproductive rights and and
[1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:48.240]  my answer to you is that that should be a decision that the woman makes the head
[1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:52.800]  pause real quick back to some 15 seconds the it's a powerful headline Millie went
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:55.920]  with last night cuz we were talking on the phone and she said what is the
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:08:59.700]  headline should be in I'm like well you know how about Beto Rourke and Doris's
[1:08:59.700 --> 1:09:03.840]  third trimester abortion gets cheered but she's like well I think the headline
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:08.560]  ought to be his supporters attack me and she's probably right because that's
[1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:12.520]  what you're about to hear right now and again it's not just crazed leftist here
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:17.280]  or there you go anywhere there their religion is killing babies for their own
[1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:34.000]  good cuz the world's gonna end in 12 years AOC said so please continue so
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:38.120]  there you have it Beto Rourke supports third trimester abortions and when I
[1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:42.280]  brought up the subject it certainly stirred up contention amongst his crowd
[1:09:42.280 --> 1:09:47.300]  ma'am I'm gonna clear this way don't push me ma'am I need to clear this I'm
[1:09:47.300 --> 1:10:05.140]  just standing here question is about how many babies have you adopted years
[1:10:05.140 --> 1:10:08.620]  ago when I went out and demonstrated 10 or 15 times in abortion clinics like 20
[1:10:08.620 --> 1:10:14.440]  years ago 15 years ago and I've gone a few times since they run over and they
[1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:17.520]  go how many babies have you adopted how many babies you adopted and then you'll
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:21.960]  say well actually I've adopted one and they go well it's not a black baby
[1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:25.480]  nobody wants those black babies is normally the thing there are more
[1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:28.960]  people wanting to adopt each year than there are kids aborted did you know that
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:32.400]  number and women get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in many cases to
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:37.200]  have the baby but women aren't being told this or that their body parts are
[1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:42.880]  being sold or they're being kept alive and sold that's now all confirmed so
[1:10:42.880 --> 1:10:49.640]  it's always the same talking points here yes people want these babies people
[1:10:49.640 --> 1:10:56.760]  adopt disabled babies too but the point is is that it's a cult
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:23.400]  continue the bioethics boards teach that if society's bad and they decide we
[1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:27.660]  can kill what we want because we're saving them from a bad future that's how
[1:11:27.660 --> 1:11:31.440]  they dehumanize you but in a loving liberal way so this guy is you know
[1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:35.160]  giving you the exact run-in we'll talk to million a moment but understand if
[1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:38.720]  you're a radio listener you can't see this she's just sitting there politely
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:44.160]  being screamed at with spit flying out their mouths at her because she their
[1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:57.400]  approach their god let's continue oh you kill them you let them live so they
[1:11:57.400 --> 1:12:01.040]  can starve to death you want to take away welfare you want to take their
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:05.720]  right away you want to pause again back it up 10 seconds you could learn an
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:12.440]  entire PhD office guy if you don't have 2.1 kids for every two adults and left
[1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:15.920]  always goes there is this thing is 2.1 yeah there are in the millions of people
[1:12:15.920 --> 1:12:20.800]  on average we have a 2.1 replacement rate that pays for Social Security it
[1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:24.480]  pays for Medicare and Medicaid it pays for the welfare in fact you need a
[1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:29.960]  bigger population of like a replacement rate of 3 to really grow a society but
[1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:33.160]  he's saying what Bill Gates taught people years ago he said well if you
[1:12:33.160 --> 1:12:37.640]  don't give grandma health care we can hire 10 teachers it's that idea that if
[1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:42.120]  you don't have services it creates more money no societies that take care of
[1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:46.440]  people create economies based on service so they said get rid of our
[1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:50.840]  industrial base so that we can be a service economy but really there's
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:54.640]  getting rid of the service economy as well one of the main jobs is nursing
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:12:58.640]  homes and taking care of people no no let's just kill their ass and then oh
[1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:02.800]  we'll kill you too we've got robots to replace you that's what this is but this

[1:19:05.320 --> 1:19:09.640]  type of video that is the most censored the most buried
[1:19:09.640 --> 1:19:13.640]  the most suppressed and that's the videos
[1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:18.040]  where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant
[1:19:18.040 --> 1:19:20.840]  leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others
[1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:25.960]  get so butt hurt when trump won they don't want us to have that victory
[1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:29.960]  they don't want us to remember what political action did
[1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:33.640]  and that's why the globalist hillary and others are trying to shut in for us

[1:19:59.480 --> 1:20:20.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:20.280 --> 1:20:27.880]  you may be an ambassador to england or france you may like to gamble

[1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:42.600]  millie weaver was back at work a week after she had her second child
[1:20:42.600 --> 1:20:46.520]  and i told her take off a couple months told her husband take off a few months
[1:20:46.520 --> 1:20:50.280]  so that her husband and wife team and she said no
[1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:53.640]  can't stop me and she's been more prolific since she had her second awesome
[1:20:53.640 --> 1:20:56.360]  baby and if you're a radio listener you're
[1:20:56.360 --> 1:20:58.920]  really missing out on getting to actually see millie she's also a very
[1:20:58.920 --> 1:21:02.280]  lovely sweet lady and you know why the system's attacking women and
[1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:05.320]  children and the entire family because women are
[1:21:05.320 --> 1:21:09.000]  the heart of the family and the children are the fruit of the family
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:12.120]  and men are supposed to defend the family and we've advocated our
[1:21:12.120 --> 1:21:16.520]  responsibility and i just i just noticed and i'm not trying to shame anybody
[1:21:16.520 --> 1:21:20.440]  we have a lot of great people but it's our female reporters that are just
[1:21:20.440 --> 1:21:24.600]  dominating and slaying it when you go out and you see
[1:21:24.600 --> 1:21:27.320]  all these hollywood movies like they say the heroine
[1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:30.920]  the hero must be a heroine and then it's always this anti-male deal no no it's
[1:21:30.920 --> 1:21:34.040]  women and men empowering each other and you've got other big breaking news we're
[1:21:34.040 --> 1:21:36.200]  going to hit the final segment that's so huge
[1:21:36.200 --> 1:21:39.480]  and the promo piece we've got is so staggering
[1:21:39.480 --> 1:21:42.920]  where you and others actually have the proof you infiltrated
[1:21:42.920 --> 1:21:47.720]  the leftist troll farm out there posting racist comments and creating division
[1:21:47.720 --> 1:21:51.960]  i mean if people get this report coming out out it could blow up the death star
[1:21:51.960 --> 1:21:55.320]  politically they'll say jones actually wants to know that that's a metaphor
[1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:58.040]  folks i know our viewers and listeners get it but
[1:21:58.040 --> 1:22:01.320]  every time i do that it's jones wants to blow up a death star we're not sure
[1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:04.840]  where the plastic explosives are the point is is it could bring down their
[1:22:04.840 --> 1:22:08.680]  whole house of cards and just show not just the censorship but the
[1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:11.160]  coordinated evil but millie i'm gonna say it
[1:22:11.160 --> 1:22:15.240]  you help get katlyn Bennett working for info wars you've got a lot of other
[1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:19.160]  people you want to get on board and you're not just
[1:22:19.160 --> 1:22:22.360]  female centric and that most of the reporters you want to hire women that's
[1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:26.360]  who's really i'm not just saying this to like brownie points with women it's just
[1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:29.160]  true are women and that's why we need funds to
[1:22:29.160 --> 1:22:32.920]  pay for the plane tickets the cars the film uh
[1:22:32.920 --> 1:22:37.000]  people like katlyn did only wanted money to pay her expenses she's awesome
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:40.760]  so it comes down to that we need people to buy products
[1:22:40.760 --> 1:22:44.840]  at infowarstore.com and realize we're swinging for the fences here
[1:22:44.840 --> 1:22:50.120]  and we're not getting home runs and ran slams routinely folks there's nowhere
[1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:54.920]  where you can go buy products and get great products at the same time
[1:22:54.920 --> 1:22:58.600]  fund individuals and organizations that are dead in the crosshairs of the
[1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:04.840]  globalist because we bring the pain to the globalist
[1:23:04.840 --> 1:23:08.440]  it's always clutch time here and i got to say it
[1:23:08.440 --> 1:23:11.800]  info wars is kind of the tom brady of news and information
[1:23:11.800 --> 1:23:14.920]  and so we need your prayers we need your support
[1:23:14.920 --> 1:23:18.200]  we need to support local stations that means thank them that means send them a
[1:23:18.200 --> 1:23:21.240]  hundred dollar bill as a tithe every month because if your preachers aren't
[1:23:21.240 --> 1:23:23.960]  covering the petal fall rings in your town they're part of it
[1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:28.520]  so yes please tithe it's not tax deductible to the mark of the b system

[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:52.840]  over your incredible report uh let's let's get into bdo and how
[1:23:52.840 --> 1:23:55.400]  empty-eyed he looked then we can play for tv viewers
[1:23:55.400 --> 1:23:58.600]  without audio just the first part where she asked the question i mean he is
[1:23:58.600 --> 1:24:05.640]  truly a slave truly a vacant empty avatar of a dark spider-like force
[1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:09.160]  he's like the spider down the hole that has hit the clown on its finger
[1:24:09.160 --> 1:24:12.760]  uh no this hit and run individual this this liar
[1:24:12.760 --> 1:24:17.240]  this guy running caravans in the u.s but i mean there he is looking at you
[1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:20.440]  and i mean the this is who they've got to offer
[1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:25.000]  tell us what it was like to actually be there well you know beta puts on this
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:28.760]  persona that you know it's all about beta and he
[1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:32.840]  has this charismatic vibe about him kind of similar to obama
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:37.480]  but really don't be fooled because he's displaying many of the characteristics
[1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:41.640]  of a sociopath and some of the statements he made when he's a teenager
[1:24:41.640 --> 1:24:46.520]  that he recently apologized for where he envisioned and imagined
[1:24:46.520 --> 1:24:50.600]  mowing down children with a car it gives you a tell
[1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:56.200]  that this man is possibly a sociopath and that's why he acts like this narcissist
[1:24:56.200 --> 1:25:00.200]  i mean he just wanted to take selfies with everyone and they love it i mean
[1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:03.480]  he's a nobody with a bunch of other nobodies who want to believe they
[1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:06.760]  brushed greatness when it's not a sociopath millie
[1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:10.840]  it's psychotic to say you want to kill kids oh it is and
[1:25:10.840 --> 1:25:14.600]  you know that's why i was trying to because he likes to put on this image
[1:25:14.600 --> 1:25:18.760]  that he's all about humanity and he cares about children he cares about people
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:22.760]  and you know that's why i wanted to ask him what his dance was on third trimester
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:26.360]  abortions to see what his reaction would be is he
[1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:30.840]  going to stand up for humanity small children that can't defend themselves
[1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:34.520]  in the womb that are viable or is he going to go along and
[1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:38.120]  toe that democrat line and that line that the globalists want to push for
[1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:41.240]  depopulation which is uh promoting and pushing third
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:45.320]  trimester abortions and without fail Beto O'Rourke
[1:25:45.320 --> 1:25:49.720]  essentially endorsed third trimester abortions he said he supported it he said
[1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:53.320]  the woman has the right to choose i trust her that's what he says
[1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:57.080]  and and he was followed by applause and cheering
[1:25:57.080 --> 1:26:00.680]  from many of the liberals that were in the crowd there and this whole women's
[1:26:00.680 --> 1:26:05.560]  right to choose oh it sounds so innocent but don't be fooled and the truth was
[1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:09.080]  revealed when these leftists came up to me screaming
[1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:12.840]  acting almost demonically possessed harassing me yelling
[1:26:12.840 --> 1:26:15.960]  angry frothing at the mouth calling me a pig because
[1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:20.600]  you know i just asked a question about you know abortion and whether he wants
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:25.640]  to support killing third trimester babies you know
[1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:29.000]  it really was revealing one lady even compared the children
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:33.480]  to cows she said oh i bet you eat cows i'm like
[1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:37.240]  i don't compare well that's because from a leftist babies to cows from a leftist
[1:26:37.240 --> 1:26:41.480]  we're all animals compared to them so if you're eating animals humans are
[1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:44.200]  animals she's telling you what she thinks of you
[1:26:44.200 --> 1:26:48.120]  it reminds me literally of like kane enable when
[1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:53.560]  kane you know he offered up meat or no kane was the one who killed his
[1:26:53.560 --> 1:26:57.640]  brother and offered up the vegetables like these vegan vegetarians and he
[1:26:57.640 --> 1:27:00.520]  killed able he killed his brother so he saw nothing
[1:27:00.520 --> 1:27:04.840]  wrong with killing his brother a human but he didn't want to kill an animal to
[1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:07.800]  offer it up to god i mean that's kind of how these vegans think
[1:27:07.800 --> 1:27:11.240]  most of these vegetarian and vegans that are liberals and leftists
[1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:14.920]  they think oh there's nothing wrong with aborting human babies but
[1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:19.320]  oh you are evil you're a murderer they're exactly they're into the power of
[1:27:19.320 --> 1:27:24.280]  killing humans they they're it's a religion
[1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:28.200]  and you know what's crazy when he pulled up to this event beto pulled up in a
[1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:32.040]  minivan it was like a total pr publicity stunt they're
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:35.080]  trying to make him look like this likable relatable guy
[1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:39.160]  it was at a bar where people could drink beer so that you know this
[1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:43.160]  hole in the wall bar was going to appeal and establish rapport with people
[1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:46.520]  and of course it was such a small venue they had overflow
[1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:50.600]  but that's because he couldn't draw such a large crowd in a place like
[1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:54.920]  ohio where i'll just say this he has that mentally ill
[1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:59.000]  psychotic kind of schizophrenic look that bernie sanders has
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:02.360]  and when you deal with these type of psychotics all they think is i'm going
[1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:05.960]  to rule i'm going to run them i'm supposed to be in
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:10.120]  charge and of course you now hear his quotes i'm born to be president i will
[1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:13.080]  run things now he's even worse than obama where all he
[1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:16.360]  was a state rep and couldn't even stay in that not like he was a state senator
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:22.840]  than a senator than president he's just i'm beto i now am your leader
[1:28:22.840 --> 1:28:26.760]  beto has been trying to avoid uh coming out
[1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:30.440]  and revealing his policies and his stance on certain issues that are
[1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:33.560]  controversial because he's sticking to the more friendly ones like oh
[1:28:33.560 --> 1:28:36.840]  legalizing marijuana you know opinions that are more
[1:28:36.840 --> 1:28:40.600]  moderate he's staying away from these touchy subjects because he doesn't want
[1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:43.240]  to scare people away and most people don't know what his
[1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:46.680]  stances are on these policies so that's why i just don't know how people don't
[1:28:46.680 --> 1:28:50.760]  see that he's clearly a horrible criminal evil demon
[1:28:50.760 --> 1:28:54.520]  not just a hit-and-run guy that worships killing children or
[1:28:54.520 --> 1:28:57.640]  you know each dirt that's in the news

[1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:45.640]  ready i'm trying to shut up to give you the floor
[1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:53.080]  so you're in the midst of these monsters uh i mean beta supporters demonically
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:56.920]  attack female reporter verbally i think that's really what happened here
[1:37:56.920 --> 1:38:00.520]  continue on and then give us a prelude to what's coming up next segment with
[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:06.520]  your great infiltration okay so after you know the screaming
[1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:10.280]  and the harassment happened inside of the event
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:14.280]  i walked outside and there were still crowds of these attendees
[1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:18.040]  that were going to this beta event now before the event some of the attendees
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:21.720]  said they didn't even know what beto's policies were and that's why they were
[1:38:21.720 --> 1:38:25.720]  coming to hear him out because beto's been so hush about his policies
[1:38:25.720 --> 1:38:29.080]  because he doesn't want to scare away people with some of his more
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:34.600]  extreme far left progressive policies so once the cat was out of the bag with
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:39.480]  these you know third trimester abortion policies he wants to push
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:43.400]  it actually stirred up contention amongst the people attending
[1:38:43.400 --> 1:38:47.320]  some people were attacking me and then other people jumped out and started
[1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:50.760]  defending life defending these unborn babies and it
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:54.440]  actually stirred up fighting and contention amongst the attendees
[1:38:54.440 --> 1:39:00.280]  and it showed that this subject third trimester abortions has the potential
[1:39:00.280 --> 1:39:04.920]  to actually split the democratic base because the moderate
[1:39:04.920 --> 1:39:09.480]  democrats actually don't want third trimester abortions a gallup poll came
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:13.800]  out and it revealed that only 13 percent of americans
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:18.440]  are for third trimester abortions so that's why this video is so
[1:39:18.440 --> 1:39:21.480]  important and many of you guys out there

[1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:39.560]  people need to expose beto or roark for his
[1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:46.200]  progressive extreme ideals of wanting to abort completely viable babies
[1:39:46.200 --> 1:39:50.920]  that you could just do a c-section and remove them safely from the mother
[1:39:50.920 --> 1:39:54.040]  in the womb and give them a chance at life yes some of them
[1:39:54.040 --> 1:39:58.520]  they might not make it but you can at least give them
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:03.000]  you know life resuscitation and life support to help them to live
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:06.200]  so please go ahead and and share those videos
[1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:10.520]  and alex you know as far as this other special report that i have coming out
[1:40:10.520 --> 1:40:16.120]  soon the leftist troll farm video this is going to be a huge report
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:20.280]  uh you can find the trailer as well on my channel millennial millie
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:23.320]  i don't know if you wanted to get into that this segment alex oh i do we're
[1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:26.840]  going to we're going to come back in the next break and play the trailer
[1:40:26.840 --> 1:40:30.120]  uh but you know we know the left goes out and poses as conservatives that's how
[1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:34.200]  they woke up kandace owens she had a powerful site she built so they would
[1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:36.840]  target her as right-wingers they were going to get her and suddenly leftist
[1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:40.360]  contacted but she tracked her ip addresses about the leftist
[1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:45.400]  were threatening and harassing her uh to then get her to go to them and be
[1:40:45.400 --> 1:40:49.080]  protected by them that's what the colleges do so they run false flags
[1:40:49.080 --> 1:40:52.440]  routinely and you basically caught this group doing that
[1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:58.280]  well what we caught them doing was essentially um creating a troll farm and
[1:40:58.280 --> 1:41:06.680]  our infiltrator essentially got in these were all password protected um
[1:41:06.680 --> 1:41:10.600]  platforms essentially that these troll groups would use to operate in their
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:15.240]  they're operating in encrypted message boards so that they can share all their
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:19.400]  information without having it traced back to them and they would give
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:24.200]  each other instructions how to hide their vpns essentially their fingerprints
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:26.920]  on the internet so that when they're doing all this trolling creating all of
[1:41:26.920 --> 1:41:31.720]  these fake accounts posing as right-wing extremists uh
[1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:36.280]  in order to troll content creators like myself a conservative
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:40.840]  and other conservatives out there to paint us and color us as extremists
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:45.480]  they could do that safely without being outed or doxxed or found out
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:51.720]  so the whole point of this troll farm was essentially to paint and color
[1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:55.800]  um people like info wars bright Bartz myself
[1:41:55.800 --> 1:41:59.080]  jack bassobeck i mean some of these people are literally mentioned and
[1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:04.680]  targeted in these threads and the idea is put all these
[1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:08.040]  comments and give directives to these trolls to
[1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:12.280]  make it appear that they are extremists or um
[1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:15.480]  racist homophobic hateful that these are
[1:42:15.480 --> 1:42:21.240]  breeding grounds for hate so that then um they can point the finger at us at
[1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:24.760]  the conservatives and that's exactly what Oliver Darcy that's exactly what
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:27.800]  Oliver Darcy came out last week and said he goes we have to ban everybody
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:30.920]  because you know there's hateful comments at info wars so that's their next
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:34.200]  thing and of course they're famously probably Darcy himself
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:39.560]  i would imagine in there typing in himself oh i'm sure i'm sure Darcy is
[1:42:39.560 --> 1:42:43.960]  getting the same directives that the same people are giving the directives to
[1:42:43.960 --> 1:42:47.400]  this troll farm i mean uh he literally quotes one of the
[1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:50.200]  directives verbatim in one of his tweets
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:53.160]  wow we're gonna come back with a trailer for this and then Millie will tell us

[1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:33.640]  for wars dot com is about to drop
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:37.160]  curiously i wanted to see what it was like to be inside of one of these
[1:47:37.160 --> 1:47:39.800]  discord groups that were propagating the gang gang meme
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:44.200]  so we had an undercover infiltrate a leftist troll farm
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:48.920]  the last week and what's interesting is this troll farm was getting actual
[1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:53.080]  directives on how to sow division and discontent
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:57.160]  their belief currently is that united states
[1:47:57.160 --> 1:48:00.600]  is going to collapse and then we should do everything possible
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:04.760]  to make that as quickly as possible prior to anyone reporting it we obtained
[1:48:04.760 --> 1:48:08.760]  documents which have subsequently been leaked on forchan
[1:48:08.760 --> 1:48:11.880]  that connect to the new zealand shooters manifesto
[1:48:11.880 --> 1:48:16.280]  we've got an insider watching in a lifetime them troll you
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:19.800]  yes there was a large effort to do a file dump
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:24.280]  of the discord servers that i will appear to be where these memes are being
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:27.560]  related this new zealand shooting happened and we're
[1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:30.920]  watching the troll farms come into action there was a shooting in christ
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:35.240]  terse new zealand being blamed on a self-confessed white
[1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:39.000]  supremacist who several hours before the attack submitted
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:43.160]  a manifesto to eight champ where i discovered
[1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:46.840]  a network of text documents down the post
[1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:50.280]  snap link to each other so you're saying you've got the proof of their
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:54.520]  pull in this crap and then all of our see that snake says shut down info wars
[1:48:54.520 --> 1:48:58.280]  they've got racist commenters that's right on friday again
[1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:02.040]  waking up to acceleration is shooting up a moss
[1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:06.280]  that published a manifesto quite alike the game game needs to be propagated
[1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:10.280]  on forchan and other social media sites for the act of accelerationism
[1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:13.000]  the release of documents several days ago
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:18.280]  on forchan and eightchan were basically the game plan to influence the public
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:22.120]  discourse uh on the message boards literal
[1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:25.880]  psyops going on right now on the american public to basically drive the
[1:49:25.880 --> 1:49:30.600]  united states uh into the wall to put the foot on the accelerator
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:35.240]  which is to accelerate things to its inevitable point as quickly as possible
[1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:38.840]  to sell more hatred so they want full spectrum dominance this could be seen as
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:42.840]  a perhaps a grassroots effort by disaffected groups to
[1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:47.160]  uh spoil the plan of the globalist or it could be seen as a plan by the
[1:49:47.160 --> 1:49:52.120]  globalists to basically induce chaos into a system
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:55.560]  that they're losing control of we must ask ourselves
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:50:00.120]  how much of the supposed hate speech that we see on the internet today
[1:50:00.120 --> 1:50:04.680]  is really just artificial rather than lose control of meme culture
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:08.760]  of the internet of public discourse made they want to
[1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:13.480]  drive us into open conflicts using the concept of accelerationism
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:21.080]  and therefore scare people cause civil war cause the meme war to erupt into a
[1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:24.600]  shooting war to get the united states to be destroyed or get a thousand dollars
[1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:28.920]  in a process but if you read the wiki leaks they
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:32.120]  want to collapse the u.s they want to collapse the borders they want to say
[1:50:32.120 --> 1:50:36.200]  america's evil and racist and has to be brought down i mean we know that's real
[1:50:36.200 --> 1:50:40.120]  because the propaganda and the documents but millie we have kandace ellen she
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:44.040]  named the groups she showed the emails where she was prominent
[1:50:44.040 --> 1:50:47.800]  good-looking well-spoken a mainline liberal not a leftist
[1:50:47.800 --> 1:50:50.440]  she wanted to create an internet system to unify people
[1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:54.200]  so they had the left threaten her attack her she was smart enough to check ip
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:56.680]  addresses and learned that it wasn't right wing
[1:50:56.680 --> 1:50:59.560]  doing it with the left offering to save her it was them
[1:50:59.560 --> 1:51:04.200]  it was literal cia operatives like gloria steinem but 2.0
[1:51:04.200 --> 1:51:08.040]  leftist quote feminist who really just create farms
[1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:12.120]  of caged women they control as soon as you get to university now
[1:51:12.120 --> 1:51:17.160]  they take the nerd kids off the bus they go there's a kkk rally tonight
[1:51:17.160 --> 1:51:19.560]  then somebody puts a swastika on their dorm and they come they go it's all
[1:51:19.560 --> 1:51:22.760]  going to keep you safe come in here they're like we're going to give you
[1:51:22.760 --> 1:51:25.880]  fisting lessons now literally or pedophilia is good we're going to
[1:51:25.880 --> 1:51:29.480]  teach you and then they're just brought into this devil cult
[1:51:29.480 --> 1:51:32.760]  of antifa professors and weirdos and i mean you
[1:51:32.760 --> 1:51:36.360]  cannot make up how evil they are and they're literally mind screwing
[1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:39.640]  terrorists most of these groups are run by psychologist
[1:51:39.640 --> 1:51:43.560]  psychiatrist i mean this is a cult
[1:51:46.360 --> 1:51:50.040]  millie i'm sorry we've lost your audio maybe that's on your end or is that on
[1:51:50.040 --> 1:51:52.920]  our end oh it's online okay no no it's not on yours
[1:51:52.920 --> 1:51:56.600]  go ahead and start over so what we have here
[1:51:56.600 --> 1:52:00.920]  is we have this this group of accelerationists essentially the young
[1:52:00.920 --> 1:52:05.800]  generation that are anarchists uh antifa essentially radicals
[1:52:05.800 --> 1:52:10.280]  that are the ones operating the troll farm and they're buying into this idea of
[1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:13.640]  accelerationism where you create extremists on the
[1:52:13.640 --> 1:52:16.920]  right extremists on the left you create all this
[1:52:16.920 --> 1:52:22.440]  acceleration until chaos erupts and then they think that you know people are
[1:52:22.440 --> 1:52:27.320]  going to find a middle ground or they might destroy america i mean
[1:52:27.320 --> 1:52:31.800]  these people are radicals essentially so these group of radicals are being
[1:52:31.800 --> 1:52:35.880]  utilized by the globalists who have this narrative
[1:52:35.880 --> 1:52:40.200]  because their narrative is essentially to use these groups that they're paying
[1:52:40.200 --> 1:52:44.200]  essentially uh to create this radical
[1:52:44.200 --> 1:52:48.200]  appearance on websites like info wars or breitbart or on
[1:52:48.200 --> 1:52:51.560]  plat on my youtube channel on other people's youtube channels
[1:52:51.560 --> 1:52:54.680]  so on social media they'll attack certain videos certain content
[1:52:54.680 --> 1:52:59.240]  and certain articles and what they do is look go look in the
[1:52:59.240 --> 1:53:02.200]  comment threads look these are all a bunch of hate
[1:53:02.200 --> 1:53:05.480]  pockets they're creating hate all their commenters
[1:53:05.480 --> 1:53:08.520]  they're the people commenting and watching their content
[1:53:08.520 --> 1:53:13.160]  are being radicalized we need to shut them down we let me throw this in there
[1:53:13.160 --> 1:53:16.200]  regardless of the documents or the whistleblower you have it and i'm and
[1:53:16.200 --> 1:53:20.280]  that looks like it's accurate we have youtube a month ago saying if you have
[1:53:20.280 --> 1:53:24.200]  bad comments we're going to suspend you well they know full well they just go
[1:53:24.200 --> 1:53:27.400]  make the bad comments and now they can bring you down but of course left the
[1:53:27.400 --> 1:53:29.880]  sides they can do whatever they want so you're absolutely right
[1:53:29.880 --> 1:53:34.040]  this is their game plan oliver darcy has signaled that he quarterbacks that for
[1:53:34.040 --> 1:53:38.280]  cnn along with brian stelter so they are doing this
[1:53:38.280 --> 1:53:41.720]  and in the main your report is incredibly accurate what do we do about
[1:53:41.720 --> 1:53:45.880]  this well alex do you remember months ago
[1:53:45.880 --> 1:53:50.600]  when i was warning about a possible terrorist attack or something along those
[1:53:50.600 --> 1:53:55.160]  lines that would be used to demonize social media and free
[1:53:55.160 --> 1:53:59.240]  speech and essentially further ban people on the conservative
[1:53:59.240 --> 1:54:02.600]  side that are pushing for liberty and how facebook
[1:54:02.600 --> 1:54:06.920]  already purchased the government id verification
[1:54:06.920 --> 1:54:11.160]  systems and technologies ahead of time this is something that they've been
[1:54:11.160 --> 1:54:14.680]  working toward the globalists they want this
[1:54:14.680 --> 1:54:18.200]  government id for all social media accounts
[1:54:18.200 --> 1:54:22.520]  to be mandatory they want to be able to justify that legislation from our
[1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:26.280]  congressman and senator they're going to use the global troll war
[1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:29.960]  to get it they're saying ten years in prison in new zealand if you possess the
[1:54:29.960 --> 1:54:33.320]  video well zebruder shot kennedy getting his head blown off
[1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:39.000]  and he and he won awards so and again on pbs they show nazis shooting people in
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:42.760]  pits since when i don't want to show it i'm not going to show it
[1:54:42.760 --> 1:54:47.240]  we've showed blurred versions like cnn has but cnn's allowed to that supposedly
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:52.040]  we're not so this is just crazy and you know we're not saying that the new
[1:54:52.040 --> 1:54:55.560]  zealand shooting or christian certain shooting didn't happen and that people
[1:54:55.560 --> 1:54:58.840]  didn't die we were saying these things did happen
[1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:02.840]  but what we're saying is that it's very it's possible it's likely
[1:55:02.840 --> 1:55:07.480]  that the shooter was actually engaging in this subculture of accelerationism
[1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:12.200]  where you go out and troll online and he took it to the next level potentially
[1:55:12.200 --> 1:55:16.760]  trolling in the real life and enacting a shooting and melee just hit the nail on
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:19.880]  the head when you talk about this accelerationism
[1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:23.720]  and and and and creating the crisis it's the dialectic it's the hagei
[1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:27.400]  hageilian dialectic that's what charlie manson was doing
[1:55:27.400 --> 1:55:30.920]  he was being managed by san francisco and la elite that's admitted
[1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:35.160]  theodore kazinsky was in the cia in mk ultra that's admitted that's that's
[1:55:35.160 --> 1:55:39.080]  main mainline news folks don't believe you type in unabomber with cia
[1:55:39.080 --> 1:55:42.760]  unabomber mk ultra just click google images it has the news articles
[1:55:42.760 --> 1:55:48.280]  you know from the 1990s showing it so there's this obsession
[1:55:48.280 --> 1:55:51.720]  in the intelligentsia and in the intelligence agencies about a global
[1:55:51.720 --> 1:55:55.480]  crisis just like aoc says there won't be a
[1:55:55.480 --> 1:55:58.680]  any humans in 12 years well that's because that globalists actually have a
[1:55:58.680 --> 1:56:02.040]  plan and a timeline around those lines to bring in
[1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:06.600]  bioweapon releases huge wars and out of that the new silicon human rises
[1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:09.560]  and that's what elon musk has talked about these elite meetings so
[1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:13.000]  people laugh at aoc she's being told this by high up people
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:16.360]  because they're really considering doing this
[1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:19.400]  one of the interesting things that we saw
[1:56:19.400 --> 1:56:23.880]  was that we were watching this troll farm before the new zealand shooting
[1:56:23.880 --> 1:56:29.240]  and they were in full mode trolling engaging it was reaching its climactic
[1:56:29.240 --> 1:56:32.760]  moment as soon as the new zealand
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:37.800]  church shooting happened essentially they instantly panicked you you saw this
[1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:41.480]  weird movement and activity inside the troll farm you saw people starting to
[1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:45.000]  delete stuff and start to remove the post remove
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:50.200]  the links essentially do dumps and it was like the people inside got freaked
[1:56:50.200 --> 1:56:53.000]  out and all wanted to back out of the troll farm
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  so we saw that we thought that looks really suspicious this weird activity
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:00.360]  that's happening here but if you want to find the full report we will be
[1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:06.280]  releasing it tomorrow on my youtube channel millennial milly on youtube
[1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:10.680]  well that's amazing and again folks youtube just came out
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:16.680]  and said that they are going to no that's not the article
[1:57:16.680 --> 1:57:19.240]  that's that's the wrong article we put on screen not not a big deal as people
[1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:21.080]  know that's not the article i'll find it during the break
[1:57:21.080 --> 1:57:23.800]  youtube came out about three weeks ago i talked this on joe rogan's podcast you
[1:57:23.800 --> 1:57:27.160]  had the article up there and and youtube said we
[1:57:27.160 --> 1:57:31.160]  we may start banning channels if you have hateful comments
[1:57:31.160 --> 1:57:36.440]  so that's the headline youtube may ban channels or penalized channels
[1:57:36.440 --> 1:57:40.120]  that have hateful comments stay there milly we're going to come back and talk
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:43.720]  about this uh in the third hour then i'm gonna open
[1:57:43.720 --> 1:57:47.800]  the phones up we've got a bunch of other reports as well stay with us
[1:57:47.800 --> 1:57:51.400]  there is a publicly admitted international plan
[1:57:51.400 --> 1:57:55.800]  to shut down nationalist pro free market pro western speech
[1:57:55.800 --> 1:57:59.400]  all across the world and i don't want to say i'm honored but
[1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:03.880]  in a way i am to have been chosen first last year to be platformed
[1:58:03.880 --> 1:58:07.560]  then they set the precedent now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of
[1:58:07.560 --> 1:58:11.800]  vaccines and read off the insert they take you off the internet
[1:58:11.800 --> 1:58:15.400]  now google announced just today that they're not going to take
[1:58:15.400 --> 1:58:19.560]  christian advertising of most types on their platform because it upsets the
[1:58:19.560 --> 1:58:24.360]  san francisco google employees our country in the world more and more is in
[1:58:24.360 --> 1:58:28.360]  the grip of anti-free speech hyper leftist
[1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:32.360]  anti-human transhumanists who literally think they own
[1:58:32.360 --> 1:58:35.640]  and run our lives and if we keep bowling to these cults
[1:58:35.640 --> 1:58:39.720]  the cancer that is san francisco and many of these big universities
[1:58:39.720 --> 1:58:43.560]  is going to be the operating system of the planet humanity must awaken
[1:58:43.560 --> 1:58:47.800]  and say no to these control freaks
[1:58:48.520 --> 1:58:52.600]  there are thousands of ideologies out there hundreds of different political
[1:58:52.600 --> 1:58:56.360]  systems and most of them are funded by the globalist
[1:58:56.360 --> 1:58:59.640]  info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist
[1:58:59.640 --> 1:59:02.680]  that's why the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut it down
[1:59:02.680 --> 1:59:06.120]  i didn't invent all this i went and researched the renaissance
[1:59:06.120 --> 1:59:09.880]  americana and what really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to
[1:59:09.880 --> 1:59:14.760]  bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular like it's always been
[1:59:14.760 --> 1:59:18.120]  that's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately
[1:59:18.120 --> 1:59:22.040]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that's since chills up my
[1:59:22.040 --> 1:59:25.320]  spine so whatever you do continue to support yourself

[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:47.480]  are just really on fire is the word people always overuse on fire you guys
[2:00:47.480 --> 2:00:51.720]  really are on fire and then everywhere especially katlyn goes
[2:00:51.720 --> 2:00:56.120]  she's really famous now the left particularly she's polite nice
[2:00:56.120 --> 2:00:58.840]  scream at her hit her in the back of the head throw things that are more people
[2:00:58.840 --> 2:01:02.120]  got arrested so people are like getting arrested every week for attacking her
[2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:05.320]  people are getting arrested for attacking oan i mean the left is just
[2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:09.240]  going insane oh yeah i mean they just can't
[2:01:09.240 --> 2:01:12.760]  handle people that want to question their little cult
[2:01:12.760 --> 2:01:16.520]  beliefs and mindsets so if you if you're outside of that
[2:01:16.520 --> 2:01:19.880]  and especially if they're in little groups they will attack
[2:01:19.880 --> 2:01:25.560]  and you know as far as you were saying earlier alex about how you know this is
[2:01:25.560 --> 2:01:27.640]  the women that are doing all this and this is about
[2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:30.920]  you know you know women doing something better than men it's not
[2:01:30.920 --> 2:01:35.320]  honestly we have great men working with us and helping us
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:40.760]  you know katlyn's you know fiance is her camera guy my husband is my camera guy
[2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:45.480]  and these strong men of good character are you know pushing us and helping us
[2:01:45.480 --> 2:01:49.720]  and they are behind the scenes and a big part of our operations and the work
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:53.960]  that we do so we are a coordinated effort of men
[2:01:53.960 --> 2:01:58.760]  and women working together to destroy and dismantle the
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:02.120]  agenda that the globalists are trying to push oh i totally agree with that i'm
[2:02:02.120 --> 2:02:07.000]  trying to shame other men out there to to take action i mean i know all these
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:10.520]  business owners all these veterans all these people are all about they can do
[2:02:10.520 --> 2:02:15.080]  200 setups you know in 30 seconds or they can do 100 pull-ups or
[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:18.200]  they've got really big muscles and they can shoot guns really good
[2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:21.160]  oh and and you know they're making a lot of money and then they're just totally
[2:02:21.160 --> 2:02:24.520]  not involved in society and culture as it's all coming down around us
[2:02:24.520 --> 2:02:28.440]  and the left are like vicious piranhas attacking everything
[2:02:28.440 --> 2:02:32.040]  and i'm just sick of all these you know guys they're too busy playing golf
[2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:35.240]  are too busy you know out on their boat and i'm not saying don't play golf don't
[2:02:35.240 --> 2:02:38.600]  go out on a boat but they don't ever do anything
[2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:44.280]  i mean texas is about to turn blue beto almost you know did that he did get the
[2:02:44.280 --> 2:02:49.160]  young people out like idiots to vote for democrats he lost uh but barely most
[2:02:49.160 --> 2:02:53.160]  the courts got taken over they want a bunch of uh seats in the state house
[2:02:53.160 --> 2:02:56.280]  i mean my beloved state of texas is going to go the way of california
[2:02:56.280 --> 2:03:00.040]  california used to be as conservatives of texas people better get their heads out
[2:03:00.040 --> 2:03:03.560]  of their rear ends and i'm telling the men of america get up off your
[2:03:03.560 --> 2:03:07.480]  ass exactly we need men and women going out
[2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:10.760]  there on the streets uh confronting these people that are
[2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:15.400]  pushing these ideas and calling them out calling them to task
[2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:18.920]  questioning them we need people out there going and videotaping and doing
[2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:21.400]  these things i mean we have news articles of
[2:03:21.400 --> 2:03:24.440]  beto saying oh i'm going to be in cleveland i shouldn't have been the
[2:03:24.440 --> 2:03:26.760]  only one there there should have been other people
[2:03:26.760 --> 2:03:31.000]  with cameras no one was there at the times i went to dc to confront the head of
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:34.520]  google twitter all of while they lied and we took over the media we reached
[2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:37.880]  tens of millions of people we had big victories because we got on a plane
[2:03:37.880 --> 2:03:39.800]  and we went there you don't have to be alex jones
[2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:44.360]  you were there or meli we were to do it just do it people
[2:03:44.360 --> 2:03:48.360]  you know one of the reasons why i i reached out to katelin and we
[2:03:48.360 --> 2:03:52.920]  essentially hired her to work for info wars was because she is self-motivated
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:56.920]  and self-driven her and her little team they go out and they just do stuff they
[2:03:56.920 --> 2:04:00.120]  were already going out and doing stuff doing the groundwork
[2:04:00.120 --> 2:04:04.360]  without anyone telling them to they just did it and we need more people out
[2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:07.480]  there to just do it the cream will rise to the top
[2:04:07.480 --> 2:04:11.480]  and then you know we can reach out and be like hey come work for info wars
[2:04:11.480 --> 2:04:15.560]  that's how this works we need more motivated people doing this work
[2:04:15.560 --> 2:04:19.880]  well to be clear i just want to be a place that fosters other folks to take
[2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:24.520]  action i want to beat the globalist i want to stop them that's what i want
[2:04:24.520 --> 2:04:27.960]  and so many other folks in media it's about them being number one

[2:04:31.880 --> 2:04:35.080]  competition with evil to bring it down and to stop it

[2:08:04.200 --> 2:08:07.560]  there's people in the house of islam and those outside and those outside
[2:08:07.560 --> 2:08:11.720]  the house of islam is the house of war
[2:08:11.720 --> 2:08:14.920]  there's no muslim country in the world where christian churches don't get
[2:08:14.920 --> 2:08:19.800]  blown up and people don't get killed but don't worry
[2:08:19.800 --> 2:08:22.920]  the heffington post
[2:08:23.560 --> 2:08:29.880]  famously soros funded when it was launched and this troll creature
[2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:36.360]  came out and complained and tattled along with media matters of george
[2:08:36.360 --> 2:08:41.560]  soros and said jones posted an islamophobic video where he said that
[2:08:41.560 --> 2:08:46.840]  muslims attack christians a hundred to one and that they blow up
[2:08:46.840 --> 2:08:51.800]  our churches on easter i mean every easter churches everywhere get blown up
[2:08:51.800 --> 2:08:55.880]  and she says this is a horrible fake news line and youtube said yes
[2:08:55.880 --> 2:09:01.640]  there's a channel wasn't even our channel but we knew the folks who set it up
[2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:05.640]  so we did talk to them occasionally on email they banned it the site had been
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:10.840]  around for four years had 12 million views on it
[2:09:10.840 --> 2:09:15.480]  but you aren't allowed to see that information you
[2:09:15.480 --> 2:09:19.400]  aren't allowed to have access to that information
[2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:23.800]  you have to be told what i said by amy
[2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:31.560]  russo oh and i love it congressman nunez
[2:09:31.560 --> 2:09:35.560]  when they make death threats against him they censor his response back they
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:38.360]  do all this stuff it's not free speech it's calls of violence
[2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:42.600]  to organize crime twitter brigades against him so he's suited for 250
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:46.040]  million dollars along with some users and you go to the user sites
[2:09:46.040 --> 2:09:50.600]  on twitter they're all like oh you go girl
[2:09:50.600 --> 2:09:54.520]  yeah we're going to see you in court buddy you fascist censor
[2:09:54.520 --> 2:09:58.280]  trying to shut us up these are the very people actually shutting all the
[2:09:58.280 --> 2:10:01.320]  conservatives and nationalist and libertarians
[2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:06.280]  down the reason nunez wants this is discovery
[2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:12.120]  but the new york times argues well twitter has section 230 immunity but
[2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:16.440]  they violated that by saying they're a publisher
[2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:19.960]  why don't newspapers get immunity i don't have section 230
[2:10:19.960 --> 2:10:24.520]  thinking everything i do why do they
[2:10:25.080 --> 2:10:28.200]  why do they because they say they're not publishers
[2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:35.960]  pull their section 230 instead trump is in the new nafta deal
[2:10:35.960 --> 2:10:40.760]  expanding section 230 now obviously he hadn't gone through congress
[2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:43.720]  trump didn't write it he thinks he's got some better trade deals in it so he's
[2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:49.000]  for it i get that but you add that to trump saying well
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:52.120]  you just have to get used to what's going on and you'll be better behaved
[2:10:52.120 --> 2:10:56.440]  than the left better behave than the left the left
[2:10:56.440 --> 2:11:00.040]  working with big media and big tech silences you and then lies about what
[2:11:00.040 --> 2:11:03.880]  you said they had a whole npr piece and another
[2:11:03.880 --> 2:11:07.880]  huffington post article out saying jones is currently saying
[2:11:07.880 --> 2:11:11.240]  no one died at sandy hook and sending people to their houses to harass them
[2:11:11.240 --> 2:11:14.440]  all of its out of context never sitting by anybody's house
[2:11:14.440 --> 2:11:17.640]  but there's the clear and present wolf at the door thing
[2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:21.480]  so they're the ones publishing the thing they say so evil to say nobody died
[2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:25.560]  they're the ones constantly publishing it and then saying i'm saying it
[2:11:25.560 --> 2:11:29.560]  and then saying take me off the internet roku take him off
[2:11:29.560 --> 2:11:34.200]  he's sending people to the houses right now the children are in danger
[2:11:34.200 --> 2:11:39.480]  all lies all lies and the left are a bunch of scum
[2:11:39.480 --> 2:11:43.320]  who have no morals no anything and they'll lie
[2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:46.760]  they'll do whatever they want whenever they want
[2:11:46.760 --> 2:11:51.640]  however they want and now they're coming for your children
[2:11:51.640 --> 2:11:55.240]  a whole bunch of sites that publish my sunday show
[2:11:55.240 --> 2:12:00.040]  where i showed the unspeakable behavior youtube channels run by convicted
[2:12:00.040 --> 2:12:03.960]  murderers that started the club kid movement about having underage boys at
[2:12:03.960 --> 2:12:08.040]  gay clubs pedophilia who chopped his boyfriend up with a
[2:12:08.040 --> 2:12:13.000]  buzzsaw or was it a hatchet they're on there with
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:16.440]  his poor desmond's amazing and in another video they say well here let's
[2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:20.360]  just pull it on play for you he says we're about to do some really bad
[2:12:20.360 --> 2:12:25.240]  stuff on camera so bring your children close to television
[2:12:25.240 --> 2:12:27.880]  and then in houston a convicted child rapist
[2:12:27.880 --> 2:12:31.560]  is in there with no background check in the schools in the libraries
[2:12:31.560 --> 2:12:35.640]  with the little school kids sitting on his lap and boy they're taking that
[2:12:35.640 --> 2:12:39.320]  video down bam bam bam bam bam bam bam
[2:12:39.320 --> 2:12:44.280]  doesn't matter not just me but folks all over the country
[2:12:44.280 --> 2:12:47.080]  are finding out about these quote drag queen festivals
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:49.880]  and i imagine the globalist might go pull a false flag on one or something
[2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:52.920]  you know that's how they operate so if you question grown men who are convicted
[2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:55.080]  rapists with your kids well then you know you're
[2:12:55.080 --> 2:12:58.120]  responsible for the terrible event no we don't wish any violence upon these
[2:12:58.120 --> 2:13:00.600]  people other than if they're found guilty of
[2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:04.440]  say murdering a child that they get lethal injection
[2:13:04.440 --> 2:13:07.320]  but the point is is you can see what they're going to pull because they're
[2:13:07.320 --> 2:13:10.600]  doing this antagonizing movement putting adults with your kids
[2:13:10.600 --> 2:13:14.280]  in many cases like denver and other areas not asking
[2:13:14.280 --> 2:13:17.240]  and they just suddenly your kid has dragged queen story time
[2:13:17.240 --> 2:13:21.240]  or career day and your your five-year-old son or daughter
[2:13:21.240 --> 2:13:24.920]  is sitting on some dude's lap a convicted rapist lap it
[2:13:24.920 --> 2:13:29.400]  and if you don't like that why you're bad because it's love
[2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:35.400]  well the big old fat guy with a beard has your son bouncing on his knee

[2:19:04.920 --> 2:19:08.520]  all across the world and i don't want to say i'm honored but
[2:19:08.520 --> 2:19:13.080]  in a way i am to have been chosen first last year to be platformed
[2:19:13.080 --> 2:19:16.680]  then they set the precedent now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of
[2:19:16.680 --> 2:19:20.920]  vaccines and read off the insert they take you off the internet
[2:19:20.920 --> 2:19:24.520]  now google announced just today that they're not going to take
[2:19:24.520 --> 2:19:27.720]  christian advertising of most types on their platform
[2:19:27.720 --> 2:19:31.640]  because it upsets the san francisco google employees
[2:19:31.640 --> 2:19:35.800]  our country in the world more and more is in the grip of anti free speech
[2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:41.880]  hyper leftist anti human transhumanists who literally think they own and run
[2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:44.760]  our lives and if we keep bowing to these cults
[2:19:44.760 --> 2:19:48.840]  the cancer that is san francisco and many of these big universities
[2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:52.680]  is going to be the operating system of the planet humanity must awaken
[2:19:52.680 --> 2:19:56.920]  and say no to these control freaks
[2:19:59.640 --> 2:20:04.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[2:20:17.240 --> 2:20:23.160]  i hear people talking about about the way we have to live here in this country
[2:20:23.160 --> 2:20:25.560]  murrell haggard's voice it's always makes me feel good
[2:20:25.560 --> 2:20:32.680]  arping on wars we fight and griping about the way things are to be
[2:20:32.680 --> 2:20:36.120]  and i don't mind him switching sides what about murrell haggard is i know
[2:20:36.120 --> 2:20:39.880]  people that actually knew him murrell is a really nice fellow
[2:20:39.880 --> 2:20:44.760]  but if you mess with him he splits your head to open
[2:20:44.760 --> 2:20:48.360]  so he had just somebody talking about walking on the fighting side
[2:20:48.360 --> 2:20:53.160]  walking on the fighting side
[2:20:58.040 --> 2:21:00.600]  all right i'm going to go to your phone calls right now trump said to have a
[2:21:00.600 --> 2:21:03.000]  press conference i may pop into some of that

[2:23:03.080 --> 2:23:07.000]  x2 the particular oil company that was getting the deep earth crystals
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:12.600]  at about 8 to 12 000 feet 7 to 12 but really they've been hitting it about
[2:23:12.600 --> 2:23:16.680]  10 000 feet pure iodine if you get it from the
[2:23:16.680 --> 2:23:21.480]  it has to be all dea approved it's got to be held in a special lab
[2:23:21.480 --> 2:23:25.480]  and then once it gets put into the organic
[2:23:25.480 --> 2:23:29.800]  oil then it isn't a controlled substance anymore but
[2:23:29.800 --> 2:23:33.160]  it's just what it does for your body is just too insane 98 percent of

[2:24:01.640 --> 2:24:05.960]  all for the support okay um
[2:24:09.320 --> 2:24:13.560]  let's go to your phone calls let's do that man it's
[2:24:13.560 --> 2:24:20.760]  it really freaks me out though that you put up videos of convicted pedophiles
[2:24:20.760 --> 2:24:25.640]  convicted rapists of children in government programs with your kids in
[2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:29.880]  some cases without parents being told and that's what youtube takes you down
[2:24:29.880 --> 2:24:32.680]  instantly for and it just lets you know these are
[2:24:32.680 --> 2:24:38.440]  some scary people that just freaks me out man that
[2:24:38.440 --> 2:24:42.360]  this is their religion but every ancient culture got taken over by people
[2:24:42.360 --> 2:24:46.040]  that were pedophiles and the next best thing to kill
[2:24:46.040 --> 2:24:50.840]  them is raping them they're what they really want to kill your kids
[2:24:50.840 --> 2:24:54.120]  you know like that sounds crazy yeah because they're crazy people but read a
[2:24:54.120 --> 2:24:57.400]  history book this guy not saying he wants to kill him he's just a convicted
[2:24:57.400 --> 2:25:03.960]  child rapist hello children i'm here
[2:25:03.960 --> 2:25:06.760]  a lot of tv viewers are having to see this radio listeners are a little bit
[2:25:06.760 --> 2:25:10.600]  lucky you have to see these things that we're documenting here
[2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:17.560]  okay paul arthur rebecca nicky tyler jefferson philip greg marcus
[2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:21.080]  charlotte we're going to all those calls things we got to move quick
[2:25:21.080 --> 2:25:27.000]  so let's go to nicky nicky from new jersey thank you nicky
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:30.680]  hello how are you doing tonight i'm good talking to you
[2:25:30.680 --> 2:25:35.640]  awesome i wanted to call in because i remember going back a few months before
[2:25:35.640 --> 2:25:39.640]  trump took over office you were warning about our internet being taken over and
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:43.400]  obama is signing it over to i believe it was the un and i wanted to see if you
[2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:46.280]  could talk a little bit more about that because i'm so
[2:25:46.280 --> 2:25:50.280]  frustrated right now with this whole pakistan law coming after americans
[2:25:50.280 --> 2:25:54.040]  because you can't possibly in any way shape or form even hint at criticizing
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:25:56.920]  his law so how do we get our country back what can we as
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:02.360]  citizens do that we can get our power back
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:06.520]  if you go back to three four years ago when we're trying to hand the internet
[2:26:06.520 --> 2:26:10.600]  over from ican that we invented with darpa to the un and the u
[2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:15.080]  soros was on record saying he wanted the un to have full control to quote censor
[2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:19.560]  hate and quote push his news which shows how powerful he is
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:22.920]  and they've gone ahead with that because trump isn't defending us
[2:26:22.920 --> 2:26:26.600]  there it is leek soros document calls for regulating internet
[2:26:26.600 --> 2:26:31.800]  to favor open society supporters and you can go read it i mean again i don't
[2:26:31.800 --> 2:26:35.640]  make this up and again i said three years ago there it is three years ago
[2:26:35.640 --> 2:26:39.400]  on screen so so it's so frustrating and
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:43.080]  i don't know what do you do when trump is doing nothing
[2:26:43.080 --> 2:26:48.120]  to stop it and i'm not trying to be mean to trump but my god
[2:26:48.120 --> 2:26:51.320]  no i'm with you on that like i love trump but i'm totally with you on that i'm
[2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:54.200]  tweeting like a mad woman every other minute to trump like hey
[2:26:54.200 --> 2:26:57.960]  box didn't get you elected that was alex jones at info wars and well it was
[2:26:57.960 --> 2:27:00.520]  it was our listeners but the point is he should do it because it's the right
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:03.800]  thing anyways here's a horrible analogy but it'd be like
[2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:08.760]  if you were giving your wife a pedicure and you got nine of her fingers all
[2:27:08.760 --> 2:27:12.760]  clean and painted and lovingly you said baby i sure love you and just broke her
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:15.560]  last finger it's like trump's done all this good
[2:27:15.560 --> 2:27:20.120]  and then he just breaks the last finger and it's like what is your deal man
[2:27:20.120 --> 2:27:25.560]  i mean you get my analogy totally absolutely a hundred percent man
[2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:28.440]  so what do we do we lot of fire under him you know the good news is
[2:27:28.440 --> 2:27:31.880]  he puts some tweets out saying he's looking at investigating censorship
[2:27:31.880 --> 2:27:36.680]  and going after him good man let's do it what and also why can't we thank the
[2:27:36.680 --> 2:27:40.920]  source like i don't get lost on like squeezing us from the top and the
[2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:46.520]  bottom absolutely i mean we just and we've got a
[2:27:46.520 --> 2:27:50.520]  support alternative things like gab and info wars
[2:27:50.520 --> 2:27:53.720]  and notice the left wants gab to lose its internet hosting and they've lost
[2:27:53.720 --> 2:27:56.520]  their banking i mean they're these are tyrants these are
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:00.120]  authoritarians it's here god bless you i appreciate your call

[2:33:30.760 --> 2:33:34.760]  all right well just came in long distance call
[2:33:34.760 --> 2:33:41.560]  from samuel in australia urtigan videos up on info wars dot com
[2:33:41.560 --> 2:33:46.520]  loving muslim says you you you kiwis you you aussies
[2:33:46.520 --> 2:33:56.680]  new zealand or australia will kill you and return you in coffins
[2:33:56.680 --> 2:34:00.840]  so they see it as you're all bad see oh they're not loving muslims
[2:34:00.840 --> 2:34:04.040]  they see what they would do to your church if they could they're like wow
[2:34:04.040 --> 2:34:07.960]  you're doing what we do to you don't worry we'll kill you more
[2:34:07.960 --> 2:34:11.480]  so i don't like what the killer did it's terrible but see nobody will human
[2:34:11.480 --> 2:34:16.440] ize all the christians being killed truly sickening
[2:34:16.440 --> 2:34:21.080]  and the left is allied with these people not all muslims are like that but the
[2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:25.720]  leadership is because they can unify and fire up these groups to take over
[2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:29.160]  there isn't any muslim countries where i let christians live in peace folks
[2:34:29.160 --> 2:34:33.560]  doesn't exist so all their talk is a load of bull
[2:34:33.560 --> 2:34:37.400]  okay let's go to a caller from australia samuel
[2:34:37.400 --> 2:34:42.520]  samuel thanks for calling alex is a pleasure to talk to you hello
[2:34:42.520 --> 2:34:47.160]  uh i thought you'd want to know that the australian prime minister scott morrison
[2:34:47.160 --> 2:34:51.080]  was talking to the media yesterday about so-called hate speech
[2:34:51.080 --> 2:34:55.800]  and facebook and i think they're starting to use our own arguments against us
[2:34:55.800 --> 2:35:00.520]  so we've obviously been arguing that facebook is a utility
[2:35:00.520 --> 2:35:04.760]  and it needs to treat us treat us all equally
[2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:09.400]  but what we're seeing here from australia is that
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:13.800]  the government wants to treat facebook as a utility that the government can
[2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:16.920]  regulate and it can force it to ban anything the
[2:35:16.920 --> 2:35:20.440]  government thinks is hate speech and oh yeah that's the democrat candidates
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:25.160]  are now calling a bunch of them for an for a news and internet czar
[2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:28.600]  who decides what's real and what isn't very dangerous
[2:35:28.600 --> 2:35:34.360]  yeah and the australian prime minister is is writing to u n about it
[2:35:34.360 --> 2:35:38.040]  apparently he's already written to the japanese prime minister
[2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:40.760]  why the japanese prime minister i don't know but
[2:35:40.760 --> 2:35:45.160]  but it's clearly starting here and i mean we already have
[2:35:45.160 --> 2:35:48.760]  what i see as being trial cases here where
[2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:54.040]  the uh the the federal courts uh get uh
[2:35:54.040 --> 2:35:59.000]  subpoena uh get cases from the um the the film industry
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:05.080]  about websites that may or may not have pirated content on them or might even
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:08.920]  just link to pirated content the content doesn't have to be on that website
[2:36:08.920 --> 2:36:13.640]  and the the the isps have to block it so far only
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:19.960]  some of the isps are involved but that's starting to grow as well
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:23.640]  so i i'm really concerned that this is going to become
[2:36:23.640 --> 2:36:26.760]  a global thing and it's going to be a threat to you it's going to be a threat
[2:36:26.760 --> 2:36:30.680]  to all of us we saw new zealand uh blocking uh
[2:36:30.680 --> 2:36:36.840]  zero hedge yesterday and it just goes on and on
[2:36:36.840 --> 2:36:40.200]  well that's right uh they had media matters come out and attack it then they
[2:36:40.200 --> 2:36:43.640]  had groups listed as fake news and then now zero hedge is being banned
[2:36:43.640 --> 2:36:46.760]  globally this is global government global corporations
[2:36:46.760 --> 2:36:50.360]  working with china and others and now andrew yang
[2:36:50.360 --> 2:36:54.440]  is coming out and saying he wants an internet czar over what's real and what's
[2:36:54.440 --> 2:36:58.040]  not so incredibly dangerous but that's because
[2:36:58.040 --> 2:37:01.800]  nationalism is exploding they're losing we've just got to hold the line of the
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:04.520]  average person just creates a website in
[2:37:04.520 --> 2:37:09.480]  sorts putting out your own speech they can't censor us all the war is now
[2:37:09.480 --> 2:37:13.000]  uh samuel what do you think the main target of this attack is i mean i
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:16.440]  believe the attack happened but the guy said he wanted a race war like charlie
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:20.760]  manson he said he's an eco fascist so i say well that's a false flag the
[2:37:20.760 --> 2:37:24.120]  german staging attack against themselves start world war two with operation
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:27.720]  hemler lembaugh says the same thing they just banned more youtube channels that
[2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:31.480]  post our material saying jones is horrible
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:34.520]  he says this guy might have had a motive for civil war
[2:37:34.520 --> 2:37:40.440]  his manifesto said that it did and and this is the i think one of the risks we
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:46.200]  have with with the widespread censoring of the the manifesto uh and
[2:37:46.200 --> 2:37:49.400]  to an extent the video as well but more so the manifesto
[2:37:49.400 --> 2:37:53.160]  is that people can't read this for themselves because it's
[2:37:53.160 --> 2:37:58.680]  it's been taken off so many websites so by the way in the past we got people's
[2:37:58.680 --> 2:38:02.120]  hitler's mind comp that sold at the store we're not going to become nazis
[2:38:02.120 --> 2:38:05.960]  because we read it or the brooder film kennedy's headbling blown off or
[2:38:05.960 --> 2:38:10.360]  i mean you used to you get to see this stuff why not now
[2:38:10.360 --> 2:38:13.240]  because it applies in the face of their narrative
[2:38:13.240 --> 2:38:17.320]  uh they they want to cherry pick little bits and pieces out of the
[2:38:17.320 --> 2:38:21.480]  out of the manifesto and call anyone who doesn't agree with
[2:38:21.480 --> 2:38:25.800]  the the entire manifesto being about those little cherry picked pieces as
[2:38:25.800 --> 2:38:29.240]  being fake news or liars or whatever and
[2:38:29.240 --> 2:38:33.480]  that that's what they're they're doing now anyone who doesn't agree that this
[2:38:33.480 --> 2:38:37.720]  was a a a far right nationalist white nationalist
[2:38:37.720 --> 2:38:41.480]  racist attack uh is being called a liar
[2:38:41.480 --> 2:38:45.320]  even though the manifesto quite clearly says he wants to start race wars he
[2:38:45.320 --> 2:38:48.040]  wants to depopulate the planet
[2:38:48.040 --> 2:38:52.520]  the the the mainstream media is lying to us we shouldn't be surprised
[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:55.800]  alex if i can just quickly info or store dot com
[2:38:55.800 --> 2:38:59.480]  i want to thank you for pollen block it's it's amazing
[2:38:59.480 --> 2:39:04.760]  the um i've i've used so many different antihistamines over the years because i
[2:39:04.760 --> 2:39:10.040]  get really bad hay fever and the antihistamines sometimes work
[2:39:10.040 --> 2:39:13.720]  sometimes don't but they never quite work fully
[2:39:13.720 --> 2:39:17.320]  they they don't block all of the symptoms they just kind of dry you up
[2:39:17.320 --> 2:39:20.280]  or at least that's what they do for me if they work at all
[2:39:20.280 --> 2:39:24.680]  but pollen block it works it stops everything
[2:39:24.680 --> 2:39:29.880]  i don't get the itchy eyes i'm not sneezing and i don't get the irritation
[2:39:29.880 --> 2:39:34.680]  it is amazing i think i've got some um i know i've got more pollen block in the
[2:39:34.680 --> 2:39:38.760]  car right now i need to drop off in the office uh so i keep some at home some at
[2:39:38.760 --> 2:39:41.800]  work well i know it's really expensive to get it shipped
[2:39:41.800 --> 2:39:44.360]  australia so maybe we should get your name and number so we're looking for
[2:39:44.360 --> 2:39:47.320]  distributors that want to get it at pretty much at cost
[2:39:47.320 --> 2:39:51.720]  and then sell our products in australia or create a variant but this is a known
[2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:54.520]  patent out of france you have to pay for the patent
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:39:59.480]  where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail
[2:39:59.480 --> 2:40:03.240]  and then you get their eggs it creates this incredible antihistamine
[2:40:03.240 --> 2:40:07.080]  of a certain type of quail and so i'm always forgetting that it works better
[2:40:07.080 --> 2:40:09.720]  than claring in for me and so many other things
[2:40:09.720 --> 2:40:13.560]  pollen block has a whole bunch of five star reviews pollen block really is
[2:40:13.560 --> 2:40:18.760]  amazing how fast did it take for pollen block to kick in for you
[2:40:18.760 --> 2:40:23.560]  yeah it's it's pretty much straight away uh you know in maybe 10 minutes maybe
[2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:30.920]  20 minutes it it's it just works uh the the antihistamines the
[2:40:30.920 --> 2:40:36.360]  pharmaceutical products i find that with those i can't take them until i start
[2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:39.480]  getting symptoms and even then they they might not
[2:40:39.480 --> 2:40:42.600]  kick in for half an hour or they might not kick in at all depending on the day
[2:40:42.600 --> 2:40:47.160]  pollen block works every single time well that's the great part about this and
[2:40:47.160 --> 2:40:49.560]  people in that staff have told me this is so good
[2:40:49.560 --> 2:40:52.680]  you should make ads about it you should talk about it and i just it's a blind
[2:40:52.680 --> 2:40:55.240]  spot i haven't but for whatever reason it's this
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:40:59.480]  france discovered like 50 years ago it's still got to be even in this region of
[2:40:59.480 --> 2:41:01.880]  france it's it's very complex they don't even know why
[2:41:01.880 --> 2:41:05.000]  but they think it's the pollen in the area of the dust what the quail are
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:09.080]  eating uh then they just produce in the eggs
[2:41:09.080 --> 2:41:14.760]  whatever this this essence is uh that just turns the histamine response off
[2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:18.680]  so yes uh in fact it's okay with you i'll take this and put this out
[2:41:18.680 --> 2:41:21.960]  as an ad for folks and they can experience pollen block uh for
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:24.760]  themselves uh so thank you so much for the call

[2:42:07.880 --> 2:42:11.080]  okay i'm just gonna tell you what i do i go out and i do market research
[2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:14.280]  and i say what are the best-selling products in the world
[2:42:14.280 --> 2:42:18.680]  and what have the best reviews in the world and then what do people in america
[2:42:18.680 --> 2:42:22.040]  not know that in japan or in europe or in russia
[2:42:22.040 --> 2:42:25.880]  or in africa or in latin america is already a best-seller
[2:42:25.880 --> 2:42:29.640]  because a lot of stuff never gets here for some reason and in europe and in russia
[2:42:29.640 --> 2:42:35.880]  and in canada uh there are a lot of brands of this stuff with the quail eggs
[2:42:35.880 --> 2:42:39.560]  it's not here so we just made a souped-up version of it discounted it
[2:42:39.560 --> 2:42:44.520]  and it's pollen block and it works really good but see
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:49.000]  that's how we reverse engineer stuff i copied an amazon ad one time and like
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:53.960]  doubled ourselves dated all the market research i just
[2:42:55.160 --> 2:42:57.960]  it's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day

[2:48:29.160 --> 2:48:33.480]  okay i wanted to um talk to you about the abortion issue
[2:48:33.480 --> 2:48:40.120]  yes okay um i think it was great that the lady you had on
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:46.280]  discussing um you know on the saturday december 23rd you know
[2:48:46.280 --> 2:48:51.160]  wear black don't go shopping close your business and all that
[2:48:51.160 --> 2:48:56.200]  yes i think we need to be make a much bigger impression
[2:48:56.200 --> 2:48:59.000]  okay oh i i think it would have been great if that had been bigger yes we're
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:04.120]  just all trying as hard as we can well i've got an idea and i think every
[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:08.520]  community to start doing this across the nation
[2:49:08.520 --> 2:49:14.520]  okay i think everyone needs to agree in like a small community i live in san
[2:49:14.520 --> 2:49:21.240]  aclorida and there are many elementary schools and junior highs and high schools
[2:49:21.240 --> 2:49:26.440]  if the christians and the people that are against abortion and believe abortion
[2:49:26.440 --> 2:49:32.680]  is a murder they need to pull their kids out of the school
[2:49:32.680 --> 2:49:36.680]  elementary no i agree because they all get money off your kids being there
[2:49:36.680 --> 2:49:41.800]  and exactly exactly that's a great idea it's got it's a boycott
[2:49:41.800 --> 2:49:47.480]  well see that's the thing people need to it needs to be it needs to be grassroots
[2:49:47.480 --> 2:49:52.360]  i've been talking to you know pastors and no it's a great idea so let's so let's
[2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:56.760]  pick a date pick a date that's uh made two days to get their attention
[2:49:56.760 --> 2:49:59.560]  because sometimes parents kind of work a certain days let's say it's two or three
[2:49:59.560 --> 2:50:04.360]  days or let's say a week a week where as much as you can
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:08.600]  take off work take your child to the zoo or go to a movie or go for a hike or
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:13.400]  you know take him to a museum or go to church whatever let's pick a week
[2:50:13.400 --> 2:50:17.320]  and and come up with a name and call for this uh you know so let's pick up that
[2:50:17.320 --> 2:50:20.760]  be awesome it's a great idea so why don't we
[2:50:20.760 --> 2:50:25.240]  pick something like the last school week uh of april coming up
[2:50:25.240 --> 2:50:28.680]  and saying is a protest against abortion and saying children are children
[2:50:28.680 --> 2:50:31.240]  and you shouldn't kill them after they're born shouldn't kill them before
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:33.800]  they're born and so to you know point out that our
[2:50:33.800 --> 2:50:37.320]  children belong to the parents uh and that the parents had the children the
[2:50:37.320 --> 2:50:41.480]  state doesn't own the children uh that parents uh boycott uh the
[2:50:41.480 --> 2:50:45.480]  schools and and and and all these corrupt systems uh in the last
[2:50:45.480 --> 2:50:49.160]  week of april i'll try to come up with a name for it
[2:50:49.160 --> 2:50:52.760]  can you imagine what it would be like i think it'd be great why don't you
[2:50:52.760 --> 2:50:56.760]  email us at showtipsandinfullwars.com not just you but everybody with names of
[2:50:56.760 --> 2:50:59.320]  this or what you'd call it thank you rebecca
[2:50:59.320 --> 2:51:02.360]  and talk to you for hours but i've got to get to everybody else here which is my
[2:51:02.360 --> 2:51:07.720]  big frustration philip and indiana you're on the air thanks for holding
[2:51:07.720 --> 2:51:13.880]  yeah sir welcome well the thing i was getting at
[2:51:13.880 --> 2:51:18.280]  is uh you always talk about tithing and the the scripture i thought it gave
[2:51:18.280 --> 2:51:21.320]  us is the scripture on it is is that it says to bring the full
[2:51:21.320 --> 2:51:24.920]  the full tithe into the storehouse that there's meat in the storehouse
[2:51:24.920 --> 2:51:28.840]  and that's what i say about you info wars is every single time i've been there
[2:51:28.840 --> 2:51:32.680]  there's been meat there's been substantial things to having an
[2:51:32.680 --> 2:51:36.120]  understanding of our our world in our society
[2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:40.120]  and that's why i say people should tithe to your your organization
[2:51:40.120 --> 2:51:46.040]  and anybody that's affiliated with it meaning radio stations and like that
[2:51:46.040 --> 2:51:51.800]  and the other thing was is that uh in in tithing also give yourself an
[2:51:51.800 --> 2:51:55.800]  opportunity to do a little giving um it says that if you want to get god
[2:51:55.800 --> 2:52:00.920]  lending back to you paying back to you give to the poor so in the local area
[2:52:00.920 --> 2:52:04.120]  to your homeless shelters or something like that give out the give out some of
[2:52:04.120 --> 2:52:08.280]  the info wars sir i totally agree and give out info wars products
[2:52:08.280 --> 2:52:11.480]  and i've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars funding groups
[2:52:11.480 --> 2:52:14.600]  surveilling pedophiles and actually getting a lot of them busted and some
[2:52:14.600 --> 2:52:18.040]  of the cases they don't want me to talk about it on air because it's ongoing
[2:52:18.040 --> 2:52:22.120]  investigations even though arrests have been made but i'm not playing games
[2:52:22.120 --> 2:52:26.200]  and so people you know you buy products here

[2:52:52.280 --> 2:52:55.800]  okay so people cannot put their money

[2:52:59.080 --> 2:53:03.880]  360 win so yes people should tithe to info wars

[2:55:34.120 --> 2:55:37.720]  you know most of these idiots on the left they
[2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:44.520]  they listen just to the mainstream news this tbs abc nbc cnn wash and impose
[2:55:44.520 --> 2:55:47.480]  new york times etc they only get one perspective
[2:55:47.480 --> 2:55:50.280]  well they also think they're part of the power structure
[2:55:50.280 --> 2:55:54.680]  yeah but they think they're part of the elite right
[2:55:54.680 --> 2:55:58.360]  right well anyway but you know because because i know you have other calls and
[2:55:58.360 --> 2:56:00.840]  everything but no no i want to hear from you tell me tell me
[2:56:00.840 --> 2:56:05.640]  look at yeah i'm looking at the news today and i see that uh wiener mobile boy
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:11.080]  uh paul ryan is accepted to the the board of directors of fox news uh and
[2:56:11.080 --> 2:56:16.520]  then they hire uh none other than donna brazil i wanted to get your take on that
[2:56:16.520 --> 2:56:20.120]  you know because they're becoming cnn light or whatever you want to tell you
[2:56:20.120 --> 2:56:24.760]  i don't even most the employees of fox are rabid hardcore leftist
[2:56:24.760 --> 2:56:29.160]  like shep smith uh there's only a few good people left at fox
[2:56:29.160 --> 2:56:32.600]  they're planning to move on trump later trump is even aware of it and doesn't
[2:56:32.600 --> 2:56:35.160]  know and is on his own planet half the time
[2:56:35.160 --> 2:56:38.680]  i don't mean that in a mean way it's just true he's just busy out you know
[2:56:38.680 --> 2:56:41.160]  trying to get jobs or whatever but if you don't have free speech what's that
[2:56:41.160 --> 2:56:46.280]  matter and so uh yeah no fox is they they call
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:51.400]  shanhandian and bitch him out they call tucker carlson in and chew him out
[2:56:51.400 --> 2:56:54.920]  i mean look at look at the judge they're trying to remove off air
[2:56:54.920 --> 2:56:59.480]  look at law ranger lost her radio show this country in free speech is under
[2:56:59.480 --> 2:57:04.200]  siege so one other question what do you think of
[2:57:04.200 --> 2:57:07.720]  this tick-tock stuff with hanity is there anything to it i mean you know
[2:57:07.720 --> 2:57:11.080]  we're listening to it for years it's like a broken record
[2:57:11.080 --> 2:57:15.320]  well i mean i think hanity lays out the globalist criminal operation does a
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:18.440]  great job i don't have time to watch him a lot when i do he seems to be dead on
[2:57:18.440 --> 2:57:20.920]  what do you mean tick-tock i'm i'm sorry i'm
[2:57:20.920 --> 2:57:25.320]  he's he's talking about these upcoming uh you know indictments etc
[2:57:25.320 --> 2:57:29.800]  uh of the deep state and um you know i mean you know we're holding our breath
[2:57:29.800 --> 2:57:32.840]  though you know but i mean that's what needs to happen there are there are
[2:57:32.840 --> 2:57:38.040]  grand juries open on the caban people so uh you know people like to hear hope i
[2:57:38.040 --> 2:57:40.920]  don't know if it's true hey fourth hour's coming up i'm sorry
[2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:43.160]  other callers but if you call me back tomorrow it'll be
[2:57:43.160 --> 2:57:49.320]  front of the line there is a publicly admitted international plan

[3:00:47.400 --> 3:01:05.240]  so
[3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:23.320]  Liberals now are all over the news to the newest biggest group buying guns saying I'm
[3:01:23.320 --> 3:01:25.920]  preparing for civil war with the like wingers.
[3:01:25.920 --> 3:01:28.760]  Thank God you just joined us, it didn't know it.
[3:01:28.760 --> 3:01:30.760]  The second amendment is for a tyrannous government.
[3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:39.760]  A sweeping giant that is your father is rising!
[3:01:39.760 --> 3:01:49.760]  If you don't stand up and get through, you'll only be a slave.
[3:01:49.760 --> 3:01:53.760]  If your time is moving, they will push you around and make you their slave.
[3:01:53.760 --> 3:01:54.760]  They come here again!
[3:01:54.760 --> 3:01:55.760]  They come here again!
[3:01:55.760 --> 3:01:57.760]  Stand up and tell the New World Order!
[3:01:57.760 --> 3:02:02.760]  You can take our lives, but you'll never take our freedom!
[3:02:02.760 --> 3:02:07.760]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:11.760]  People above you that are inviting you into their New World Order, they're slaves.
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:13.760]  They've sold out to it.
[3:02:13.760 --> 3:02:15.760]  They're blind to their towers.
[3:02:15.760 --> 3:02:17.760]  You don't want to be part of them.
[3:02:17.760 --> 3:02:19.760]  Like Patrick Henry said, forget you are our president.
[3:02:19.760 --> 3:02:21.760]  Go from us to peace.
[3:02:21.760 --> 3:02:24.760]  Crowds down and flick the hand that feeds you.
[3:02:24.760 --> 3:02:27.760]  Let your chains sit lightly upon you.
[3:02:27.760 --> 3:02:32.760]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[3:02:32.760 --> 3:02:43.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:02:43.760 --> 3:02:49.760]  Here at the I-1 is what we are.
[3:02:49.760 --> 3:02:53.760]  Inside of one of these discord groups, they were propagating the gang game meme.
[3:02:53.760 --> 3:02:58.760]  So we had an undercover infiltrate, a leftist troll farm, the last week.
[3:02:58.760 --> 3:03:03.760]  And what's interesting is this troll farm was getting actual directives
[3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:06.760]  on how to sow division and discontent.
[3:03:06.760 --> 3:03:12.760]  Their belief currently is that the United States is going to collapse
[3:03:12.760 --> 3:03:16.760]  and that we should do everything possible to make this quickly as possible.
[3:03:16.760 --> 3:03:22.760]  Prior to anyone reporting it, we obtained documents which have subsequently been leaked on 4chan
[3:03:22.760 --> 3:03:25.760]  that connect to the New Zealand shooter's manifesto.
[3:03:25.760 --> 3:03:29.760]  We got an insider watching in a live time them troll you.
[3:03:29.760 --> 3:03:30.760]  Yes!
[3:03:30.760 --> 3:03:34.760]  There was a large effort to do a file top of the discord servers
[3:03:34.760 --> 3:03:38.760]  that appeared to be where these means were being portrayed from.
[3:03:38.760 --> 3:03:43.760]  This New Zealand shooting happened and we're watching the troll farms come into action.
[3:03:43.760 --> 3:03:49.760]  There was a shooting in Christhurst, New Zealand being blamed on a self-confessed white supremacist
[3:03:49.760 --> 3:03:54.760]  who several hours before the attack submitted a manifesto to 8chan.
[3:03:54.760 --> 3:04:01.760]  Where I discovered a network of text documents and posts that leaked to each other.
[3:04:01.760 --> 3:04:04.760]  So you're saying you've got the proof of their pulling this crap
[3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:09.760]  and then Oliver Darcy, that snake, says shut down info wars, they've got racist commenters.
[3:04:09.760 --> 3:04:10.760]  That's right!
[3:04:10.760 --> 3:04:15.760]  On Friday, again, waking up to an acceleration that's shooting up a mosque
[3:04:15.760 --> 3:04:19.760]  that published a manifesto quite like the game gaming through propaganda
[3:04:19.760 --> 3:04:23.760]  on 4chan and other social media sites for the act of accelerationism.
[3:04:23.760 --> 3:04:28.760]  The release of documents several days ago on 4chan and 8chan
[3:04:28.760 --> 3:04:34.760]  were basically the game plan to influence the public discourse on the message boards.
[3:04:34.760 --> 3:04:37.760]  Literal psyops going on right now on the American public
[3:04:37.760 --> 3:04:43.760]  to basically drive the United States into the wall to put the foot on the accelerator
[3:04:43.760 --> 3:04:48.760]  which is to accelerate things to its inevitable point as quickly as possible.
[3:04:48.760 --> 3:04:53.760]  To sell more hatred.
[3:04:53.760 --> 3:04:58.760]  The globalist, the eugenicist are always talking down to us.
[3:04:58.760 --> 3:05:02.760]  They're always trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant.
[3:05:02.760 --> 3:05:08.760]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information
[3:05:08.760 --> 3:05:10.760]  so you can make your own decisions.
[3:05:10.760 --> 3:05:13.760]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[3:05:13.760 --> 3:05:18.760]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[3:05:18.760 --> 3:05:21.760]  and what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[3:05:21.760 --> 3:05:23.760]  We are the power structure.
[3:05:23.760 --> 3:05:25.760]  We are the inventors.
[3:05:25.760 --> 3:05:27.760]  We are the trailblazers.
[3:05:27.760 --> 3:05:30.760]  And the globalists understand that.
[3:05:30.760 --> 3:05:37.760]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people.
[3:05:37.760 --> 3:05:42.760]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists
[3:05:42.760 --> 3:05:47.760]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March
[3:05:47.760 --> 3:05:51.760]  we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50%offinforestore.com
[3:05:51.760 --> 3:05:54.760]  Something everybody should take advantage of.
[3:06:08.760 --> 3:06:10.760]  Alright, welcome back.
[3:06:10.760 --> 3:06:13.760]  My name is Will Johnson. This is the Alex Jones show.
[3:06:13.760 --> 3:06:15.760]  I will be hosting this hour.
[3:06:15.760 --> 3:06:18.760]  Thank you for joining me and thank you for staying.
[3:06:18.760 --> 3:06:21.760]  This is absolutely crazy what's happening in the world today.
[3:06:21.760 --> 3:06:23.760]  Thank you for being here.
[3:06:23.760 --> 3:06:29.760]  This is such an honor, such a privilege for me to host the fourth hour of Alex Jones.
[3:06:29.760 --> 3:06:33.760]  And I'm trying not to be nervous, but I'm going to work through it.
[3:06:33.760 --> 3:06:39.760]  Alright, so one of the things I want to talk about is Donna Brazil going to Fox News.
[3:06:39.760 --> 3:06:41.760]  This is amazing.
[3:06:41.760 --> 3:06:47.760]  I don't know how many people have realized that Donna Brazil, now she was the one just to do a recap.
[3:06:47.760 --> 3:06:54.760]  Donna Brazil was the one who leaked some of the questions to Hillary Clinton during a debate against President Trump
[3:06:54.760 --> 3:06:56.760]  or at the time candidate Trump.
[3:06:56.760 --> 3:07:00.760]  And all of a sudden now we're supposed to be like, oh, this is great.
[3:07:00.760 --> 3:07:09.760]  My question is, is who made the decision, who made the decision for Donna Brazil to go to Fox News and be a contributor?
[3:07:09.760 --> 3:07:15.760]  I mean, it's almost like inviting the snake into your home.
[3:07:15.760 --> 3:07:17.760]  Just come on in. It's okay.
[3:07:17.760 --> 3:07:19.760]  Now, can she possibly change?
[3:07:19.760 --> 3:07:21.760]  I don't, you know, it is possible.
[3:07:21.760 --> 3:07:22.760]  Sure.
[3:07:22.760 --> 3:07:23.760]  Sure, it's absolutely possible.
[3:07:23.760 --> 3:07:24.760]  Anyone can change.
[3:07:24.760 --> 3:07:25.760]  I change.
[3:07:25.760 --> 3:07:30.760]  I used to be a Democrat and I changed from a Democrat to a conservative.
[3:07:30.760 --> 3:07:38.760]  So it is possible, but from looking at the article that she wrote on Fox News, I would say that she didn't change.
[3:07:38.760 --> 3:07:44.760]  And it's pretty, yeah, even on political, I actually printed out some statements here.
[3:07:44.760 --> 3:08:06.760]  The one where she made her statement saying that I'm excited by the opportunity to share my perspective and views with the Fox News audience and to help shape the dialogue at this important injunction in our history.
[3:08:06.760 --> 3:08:12.760]  So why would Fox News bring her on?
[3:08:12.760 --> 3:08:21.760]  I mean, to me, it's kind of, it's really, really like in our face that Fox News is changing their ways.
[3:08:21.760 --> 3:08:28.760]  Maybe because they're at the top of the ticket as far as the news media, the news media world.
[3:08:28.760 --> 3:08:34.760]  So now that they can do this, they're going to bring in someone like Donna Brazil to try to maybe possibly bring in liberals.
[3:08:34.760 --> 3:08:44.760]  See, she's not going to be bringing in people to try to change them to understand that President Trump is the right decision and was the right decision in 2016.
[3:08:44.760 --> 3:08:54.760]  She's going to try to get people to believe that progressiveness and being a socialist is the right thing, or you should even consider it or take a look at it.
[3:08:54.760 --> 3:09:04.760]  To me, that is the problem is literally infiltrating the conservative movement, not that Fox News is outpeaching conservative movement by any means.
[3:09:04.760 --> 3:09:06.760]  I'm not giving Fox News any credit in that department.
[3:09:06.760 --> 3:09:11.760]  If you really want to get someone credit in that department, it would be Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[3:09:11.760 --> 3:09:13.760]  That's where it's really at.
[3:09:13.760 --> 3:09:17.760]  And that's where people know that we have to get into this fight together.
[3:09:17.760 --> 3:09:25.760]  Another thing that she was saying in her article, and I'm just going to really kind of emphasize just a little bit on this here.
[3:09:25.760 --> 3:09:31.760]  And if you don't mind, I'm going to show you here on my screen what I have, what she was saying, another thing.
[3:09:31.760 --> 3:09:42.760]  It says right here, I fully admit that in my previous lives as a campaign staffer, presidential campaign manager,
[3:09:42.760 --> 3:09:54.760]  and Democrat Party official, my own lack of civility in the heat of the battle was on full display.
[3:09:54.760 --> 3:09:57.760]  She said it was on full display.
[3:09:57.760 --> 3:10:00.760]  And it wasn't pretty.
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:02.760]  Of course it wasn't pretty.
[3:10:02.760 --> 3:10:04.760]  Of course it wasn't pretty.
[3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:07.760]  She leaked questions to Hillary Clinton.
[3:10:07.760 --> 3:10:11.760]  That's the part that people were like, some people don't even remember that.
[3:10:11.760 --> 3:10:22.760]  But yet now we have Fox News straight up, having Donna Brazil, the one person that was completely against President Trump 100%.
[3:10:22.760 --> 3:10:31.760]  So my question to this, to everyone that's watching, once she's there a while, and now we get ready to have the 2020 election,
[3:10:31.760 --> 3:10:36.760]  it's like it's all being set up right now in front of our faces, with the 2020 election getting ready to come up.
[3:10:36.760 --> 3:10:44.760]  Is she going to be privy to some of the questions? That's if Fox News is even able to have a debate, to host a debate.
[3:10:44.760 --> 3:10:47.760]  If they can host a debate, is she going to be privy to some of the questions?
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:49.760]  And is she going to pass it on?
[3:10:49.760 --> 3:10:51.760]  I mean, you have to wonder.
[3:10:51.760 --> 3:10:53.760]  I mean, at least I do.
[3:10:53.760 --> 3:10:55.760]  I mean, who wouldn't?
[3:10:55.760 --> 3:10:59.760]  There's so many other people that they could have brought on.
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:05.760]  Now, speaking of being a contributor, I'm a contributor to Infowars, and I'm very thankful.
[3:11:05.760 --> 3:11:07.760]  And I think it's truly a blessing.
[3:11:07.760 --> 3:11:12.760]  God has blessed me to be a contributor with Infowars.com.
[3:11:12.760 --> 3:11:16.760]  And I take that blessing with such great honor.
[3:11:16.760 --> 3:11:19.760]  And it's absolutely wonderful to be here.
[3:11:19.760 --> 3:11:26.760]  But Donna Brazil, we know that she is completely against the President of the United States.
[3:11:26.760 --> 3:11:27.760]  We know this.
[3:11:27.760 --> 3:11:29.760]  It's no secret.
[3:11:29.760 --> 3:11:31.760]  They're not hiding it.
[3:11:31.760 --> 3:11:37.760]  And yet they still bring her on, and people are already questioning Fox News.
[3:11:37.760 --> 3:11:39.760]  They're already questioning it.
[3:11:39.760 --> 3:11:41.760]  And it's like, is this the nail in the coffin?
[3:11:41.760 --> 3:11:44.760]  Does this confirm our suspicion?
[3:11:44.760 --> 3:11:48.760]  Does this confirm that Fox News is really trying to go left?
[3:11:48.760 --> 3:11:55.760]  It's like they're pulling in all the conservatives, all the Republicans, all the Trump supporters to Fox News.
[3:11:55.760 --> 3:12:02.760]  And then now we're going to start pushing you to believe what the left has been saying all along.
[3:12:02.760 --> 3:12:06.760]  That the left has the right idea.
[3:12:06.760 --> 3:12:11.760]  I mean, don't they already have enough liberal leftist media outlets out there?
[3:12:11.760 --> 3:12:18.760]  I mean, you have CNN, ABC, CBS, the entire alphabet network soup group.
[3:12:18.760 --> 3:12:25.760]  With all of these hateful American anti-Trump ideas and stories that they're putting out,
[3:12:25.760 --> 3:12:31.760]  and they have to bring on a complete total socialist, communist, liberal to Fox News.
[3:12:31.760 --> 3:12:33.760]  What is the end game in that?
[3:12:33.760 --> 3:12:35.760]  Did anyone imagine that?
[3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:37.760]  I mean, I didn't see this coming.
[3:12:37.760 --> 3:12:41.760]  And like I was saying earlier, whose decision was it?
[3:12:41.760 --> 3:12:44.760]  Who thought it was a good idea to bring Donna Brazil?
[3:12:44.760 --> 3:12:45.760]  And you know what?
[3:12:45.760 --> 3:12:47.760]  Maybe it is.
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:53.760]  There are people that don't see how crazy these leftists are because they don't watch the liberal media.
[3:12:53.760 --> 3:13:00.760]  Maybe with her being there, because you already have Ron Williams, and he's already a crazy leftist,
[3:13:00.760 --> 3:13:02.760]  but maybe it's not enough.
[3:13:02.760 --> 3:13:05.760]  Maybe they need to see more of it.
[3:13:05.760 --> 3:13:13.760]  There was a post out there with Ilhan Omar, and they were talking about how actually the post was with a Breitbart.
[3:13:13.760 --> 3:13:19.760]  They went to the capital, and they had a Jewish community there, and they had this Jewish man talking to Nancy Pelosi,
[3:13:19.760 --> 3:13:23.760]  trying to get her to denounce Ilhan Omar.
[3:13:23.760 --> 3:13:29.760]  And he made a comment in the video saying that maybe possibly we should censor Ilhan Omar.
[3:13:29.760 --> 3:13:31.760]  And I'm completely against that.
[3:13:31.760 --> 3:13:38.760]  We shouldn't censor these crazy leftists because if we censor them, we don't know what they're doing.
[3:13:38.760 --> 3:13:40.760]  We don't see the craziness that they're doing.
[3:13:40.760 --> 3:13:46.760]  I don't want them to censor CNN because then at that point, I can't watch CNN to see how crazy they are.
[3:13:46.760 --> 3:13:48.760]  That's the only reason why I watch them.
[3:13:48.760 --> 3:13:51.760]  They end and day out.
[3:13:51.760 --> 3:13:59.760]  They spend their entire time attacking Fox News now, along with President Trump.
[3:13:59.760 --> 3:14:09.760]  So maybe they're trying to get the attacks to calm down and bring in a socialist communist leftist like Donna Brazil to maybe ease attention.
[3:14:09.760 --> 3:14:16.760]  And do you not find it ironic that all of a sudden she comes on, but look what they did to Judge Jeanine?
[3:14:16.760 --> 3:14:24.760]  Judge Jeanine just came out and made her completely freedom of speech comments about Ilhan Omar wearing a hijab.
[3:14:24.760 --> 3:14:26.760]  She has every right to say it.
[3:14:26.760 --> 3:14:28.760]  Not one time did she call for violence.
[3:14:28.760 --> 3:14:30.760]  See, that's the difference.
[3:14:30.760 --> 3:14:38.760]  Conservatives never call for violence, but the left see it as violence when we talk about them.
[3:14:38.760 --> 3:14:40.760]  Is that not the problem?
[3:14:40.760 --> 3:14:42.760]  Think about that.
[3:14:42.760 --> 3:14:48.760]  Every time we show support for President Trump, they like to think that we're being anti-American.
[3:14:48.760 --> 3:14:51.760]  Or if you're white, you're a white supremacist.
[3:14:51.760 --> 3:14:53.760]  But I'm going to talk a little bit more about that later on.
[3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:58.760]  But right now, the whole point with Donna Brazil, really?
[3:14:58.760 --> 3:15:11.760]  There's so many other people that would have been better fit than bringing on such a person that we already know that is totally against the President of the United States.
[3:15:11.760 --> 3:15:13.760]  What is that?
[3:15:13.760 --> 3:15:16.760]  What is the idea behind all of that?
[3:15:16.760 --> 3:15:19.760]  Someone should really be asking that question.
[3:15:19.760 --> 3:15:24.760]  So we're getting ready to go into a break, but before we go into a break, I want to read this to you.
[3:15:24.760 --> 3:15:31.760]  This is Infowars, and personally, I've been watching Infowars for a long time, and this is absolutely phenomenal.
[3:15:31.760 --> 3:15:34.760]  They have a 50% off sale store.
[3:15:34.760 --> 3:15:37.760]  I mean, it looked like this was store-wide, if I'm not mistaken.
[3:15:37.760 --> 3:15:42.760]  But they have 50% off on all Infowars life supplements.
[3:15:42.760 --> 3:15:44.760]  This is absolutely wonderful.
[3:15:44.760 --> 3:15:46.760]  Free shipping store-wide.
[3:15:46.760 --> 3:15:47.760]  There's a store-wide.
[3:15:47.760 --> 3:15:48.760]  Free shipping store-wide.
[3:15:48.760 --> 3:15:52.760]  And double-patriot points on all purchases.
[3:15:52.760 --> 3:15:54.760]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:54.760 --> 3:15:58.760]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:58.760 --> 3:15:59.760]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:15:59.760 --> 3:16:02.760]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:02.760 --> 3:16:08.760]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:08.760 --> 3:16:09.760]  I can help you, too.
[3:16:09.760 --> 3:16:12.760]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:16:12.760 --> 3:16:14.760]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:16:14.760 --> 3:16:19.760]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[3:16:19.760 --> 3:16:22.760]  Danpilla.com, Danpilla.com.
[3:16:49.760 --> 3:16:52.760]  Game's done. Available at Amazon Books.
[3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:21.760]  But I need to know their good quality.
[3:17:21.760 --> 3:17:25.760]  Of course, Sunny Bay heating pads and pillows are often an Amazon choice,
[3:17:25.760 --> 3:17:30.760]  and it's easy and most affordable when you purchase your Sunny Bay heating pads right from our website,

[3:17:36.760 --> 3:17:39.760]  Hey, a Sunny Bay heating pad would make a great gift, right?
[3:17:39.760 --> 3:17:43.760]  Yes, and they start at just $19.99, and free shipping is available.

[3:17:53.760 --> 3:17:57.760]  You know, the worst part about getting old, and I'm still strong at 45,
[3:17:57.760 --> 3:17:59.760]  is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[3:17:59.760 --> 3:18:00.760]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[3:18:00.760 --> 3:18:02.760]  Now I can be there for my children.
[3:18:02.760 --> 3:18:04.760]  Now I can make them strong.
[3:18:04.760 --> 3:18:05.760]  Now I can instruct them.
[3:18:05.760 --> 3:18:08.760]  Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[3:18:08.760 --> 3:18:10.760]  You think of this digital age, your word's going forever,
[3:18:10.760 --> 3:18:13.760]  but now they're using better, getting rid of what you said they were before.
[3:18:13.760 --> 3:18:19.760]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[3:18:19.760 --> 3:18:22.760]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[3:18:22.760 --> 3:18:23.760]  I can't be destroyed now.
[3:18:23.760 --> 3:18:27.760]  As long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people know the truth,
[3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:29.760]  and you can't be destroyed either.
[3:18:29.760 --> 3:18:34.760]  As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it, and go through the fire for it,
[3:18:34.760 --> 3:18:38.760]  there is a magic that then takes place, that transcends space and time.
[3:18:38.760 --> 3:18:43.760]  When you commit the word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos,
[3:18:43.760 --> 3:18:46.760]  that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[3:18:46.760 --> 3:18:53.760]  So please now commit to support InfoWars, however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[3:18:54.760 --> 3:19:03.760]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-western speech all across the world.
[3:19:03.760 --> 3:19:10.760]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be the platform.
[3:19:10.760 --> 3:19:11.760]  Then they set the precedent.
[3:19:11.760 --> 3:19:18.760]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert, they take you off the internet.
[3:19:18.760 --> 3:19:25.760]  Now, Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform,
[3:19:25.760 --> 3:19:28.760]  because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[3:19:28.760 --> 3:19:37.760]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist, anti-human transhumanists,
[3:19:37.760 --> 3:19:39.760]  who literally think they own and run our lives.
[3:19:39.760 --> 3:19:46.760]  And if we keep bowing to these cults, the cancer that is San Francisco, and many of these big universities,
[3:19:46.760 --> 3:19:48.760]  is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[3:19:48.760 --> 3:19:52.760]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks.
[3:19:52.760 --> 3:19:55.760]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:04.760 --> 3:20:09.760]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:20:09.760 --> 3:20:12.760]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:15.760 --> 3:20:18.760]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:18.760 --> 3:20:22.760]  My name is Will Johnson, I am hosting this hour.
[3:20:22.760 --> 3:20:24.760]  Thank you for joining us.
[3:20:24.760 --> 3:20:31.760]  So I just got through talking about Donna Brazil and how she infiltrated Fox News,
[3:20:31.760 --> 3:20:34.760]  and someone in Fox News had to give her the pass to bring her on in.
[3:20:34.760 --> 3:20:36.760]  But I want to move on.
[3:20:36.760 --> 3:20:43.760]  I want to move on to how right now in America, and not just America, but across the world,
[3:20:43.760 --> 3:20:48.760]  we have this whole thing about white supremacy.
[3:20:48.760 --> 3:20:54.760]  And the reason why I keep talking about it is because I want to drill it in, and I give you an example.
[3:20:54.760 --> 3:21:01.760]  When Martin Luther King was here, and he was going around trying to get all of the injustices
[3:21:01.760 --> 3:21:06.760]  that was taking place against black people by these Democrats, by these white Democrats,
[3:21:06.760 --> 3:21:12.760]  he kept speaking, he kept talking about it, he did not let up.
[3:21:12.760 --> 3:21:15.760]  And I'm pretty sure there was people out there telling him,
[3:21:15.760 --> 3:21:18.760]  maybe you should stop, maybe you should calm down, they're going to try to harm you,
[3:21:18.760 --> 3:21:20.760]  they're going to try to do something to you.
[3:21:20.760 --> 3:21:22.760]  But he knew he couldn't stop.
[3:21:22.760 --> 3:21:27.760]  Now by any means, I cannot feel the shoes of Martin Luther King, and I'm not trying to.
[3:21:27.760 --> 3:21:33.760]  My point is, is that if we stop talking about it, and if we stop addressing it,
[3:21:33.760 --> 3:21:35.760]  it's not going to go away.
[3:21:35.760 --> 3:21:39.760]  That's part of the reason why America is in the predicament that it's in right now,
[3:21:39.760 --> 3:21:45.760]  we did not have enough good men and women to stand up and speak about this craziness.
[3:21:45.760 --> 3:21:52.760]  We have Alex Jones, and Alex Jones has done a phenomenal job over the years,
[3:21:52.760 --> 3:21:56.760]  but we still have our part, we still have to do what we have to do,
[3:21:56.760 --> 3:22:00.760]  and Alex Jones has made it clear that we all have to do it.
[3:22:00.760 --> 3:22:03.760]  And he's encouraged people, and I'll be honest with you,
[3:22:03.760 --> 3:22:05.760]  I got a lot of encouragement from Alex Jones,
[3:22:05.760 --> 3:22:12.760]  listen to him when years ago saying, pick up a camera, record something, do something,
[3:22:12.760 --> 3:22:19.760]  try, speak out, and he's absolutely right, because not enough women in the past have done it.
[3:22:19.760 --> 3:22:28.760]  So, to get to the point what I'm talking about, AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
[3:22:28.760 --> 3:22:37.760]  she's the one, along with a lot of these other socialist Democrats, have been pushing this racist rhetoric
[3:22:37.760 --> 3:22:41.760]  throughout the entire country, and the reason why I'm talking about her,
[3:22:41.760 --> 3:22:44.760]  because she has millions of followers on Twitter,
[3:22:44.760 --> 3:22:47.760]  she has millions of people that listen to what she's saying,
[3:22:47.760 --> 3:22:51.760]  no matter how crazy it is, people are following for it.
[3:22:51.760 --> 3:22:57.760]  You even have Nancy Pelosi jumping in on the ACO bandwagon, which is completely crazy to me,
[3:22:57.760 --> 3:23:00.760]  and they're all talking about because she's bringing fresh new ideas,
[3:23:00.760 --> 3:23:05.760]  they're fresh crazy ideas, if you want to be honest, that's exactly what we're seeing here.
[3:23:05.760 --> 3:23:11.760]  So, let me put something that I have, I have a screenshot of her,
[3:23:11.760 --> 3:23:16.760]  I have a screenshot of one of her tweets that I want to have here, and you can see my brain force there,
[3:23:16.760 --> 3:23:22.760]  I'm sorry, turbo force, it's almost like brain force, but it's better, my opinion.
[3:23:22.760 --> 3:23:27.760]  Okay, so we have AOC here, and this is a tweet that I printed out,
[3:23:27.760 --> 3:23:29.760]  and she goes on to say,
[3:23:29.760 --> 3:23:37.760]  we all can play a role in recognizing plus preventing spread of white supremacy,
[3:23:37.760 --> 3:23:42.760]  especially our white friends.
[3:23:42.760 --> 3:23:50.760]  There are a lot of community orgs, writers plus groups that help people learn to spot white supremacy.
[3:23:50.760 --> 3:23:52.760]  Is that not crazy?
[3:23:52.760 --> 3:23:54.760]  I mean, think about it.
[3:23:54.760 --> 3:24:01.760]  She's basically saying, telling her white friends not to be white supremacists.
[3:24:01.760 --> 3:24:05.760]  And for the life of me, if you're a white and you're a Democrat,
[3:24:05.760 --> 3:24:09.760]  why are you still in the Democrat Party when they are calling you white supremacists?
[3:24:09.760 --> 3:24:15.760]  Well, see, the whole point in that is that they're basically saying anyone on the right is a white supremacist.
[3:24:15.760 --> 3:24:17.760]  That's what it comes down to.
[3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:20.760]  And it's quite obvious. It's quite obvious.
[3:24:20.760 --> 3:24:26.760]  If you're right, you're a white supremacist because they don't like anyone that supports the President of the United States.
[3:24:26.760 --> 3:24:29.760]  They don't like anyone that supports the First Amendment.
[3:24:29.760 --> 3:24:32.760]  They don't like anyone that supports the Second Amendment,
[3:24:32.760 --> 3:24:37.760]  and they most importantly don't like anyone who supports President Trump.
[3:24:37.760 --> 3:24:41.760]  And that's where we are. This is the country we live in.
[3:24:41.760 --> 3:24:49.760]  When you even have people, if you wear a mega hat, and I love my mega hat, and I wear it every single chance I get when I go out,
[3:24:49.760 --> 3:24:51.760]  I love wearing it.
[3:24:51.760 --> 3:24:57.760]  Me being a black man wearing a mega hat, I think it scares them more than the white person in the mega hat these days.
[3:24:57.760 --> 3:25:00.760]  Look at Jesse Smollett. I mean, just an example.
[3:25:00.760 --> 3:25:07.760]  But ALC, she's pushing the whole white supremacy, trying to say that it's on the uprise,
[3:25:07.760 --> 3:25:11.760]  that we're all in trouble, that we all have to pay attention,
[3:25:11.760 --> 3:25:16.760]  that white people are being indoctrinated on the internet.
[3:25:16.760 --> 3:25:18.760]  They're joining these hate groups.
[3:25:18.760 --> 3:25:23.760]  And the hate groups that they're talking about are those of us on the right.
[3:25:23.760 --> 3:25:27.760]  And I've had people say, because I'm black, that I'm a Nazi sympathizer.
[3:25:27.760 --> 3:25:29.760]  I mean, how ignorant is that?
[3:25:29.760 --> 3:25:33.760]  There are no Nazi groups.
[3:25:33.760 --> 3:25:41.760]  I mean, you may have a few, and when I mean a few, I'm talking probably less than 100, if you take my opinion on it.
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:25:44.760]  There's probably less than 100.
[3:25:44.760 --> 3:25:51.760]  If there was statistics where they were showing there was thousands of Nazis grouping up in America, then they would be able to show it.
[3:25:51.760 --> 3:25:52.760]  But they can't.
[3:25:52.760 --> 3:26:01.760]  You know, I've been to Portland where they had all the Antifa show up, BLM and BAM, all of these anti-American groups.
[3:26:01.760 --> 3:26:16.760]  I've been to the Battle of Berkeley, where again, you have Antifa, BAM, and all of these anti-American groups show up to try to throw rocks, bombs, explosives at conservatives.
[3:26:16.760 --> 3:26:22.760]  But yet they call people on the right white supremacists simply because you're white.
[3:26:22.760 --> 3:26:33.760]  And you know what amazes me the most when I go to these rallies, and I'm standing there with people that love this country, holding the American flag, and they happen to be white.
[3:26:33.760 --> 3:26:35.760]  And I stand in front of them.
[3:26:35.760 --> 3:26:39.760]  You get BLM and BAM and Antifa and all these other hateful groups.
[3:26:39.760 --> 3:26:43.760]  They'll look around me and they'll say, you're racist.
[3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:45.760]  You're a neo-Nazi.
[3:26:45.760 --> 3:26:49.760]  They'll look around me to point at the white person behind me.
[3:26:49.760 --> 3:26:52.760]  I mean, it's like, hello, I'm right here.
[3:26:52.760 --> 3:26:53.760]  I support America.
[3:26:53.760 --> 3:26:55.760]  I love this country.
[3:26:55.760 --> 3:26:58.760]  But see, they want to demonize white people.
[3:26:58.760 --> 3:27:04.760]  And I'm going to continue talking about how they're doing this to white people until they stop doing it.
[3:27:04.760 --> 3:27:08.760]  The crazy thing is, is they're not going to stop doing it.
[3:27:08.760 --> 3:27:12.760]  I have a video that I'm going to show you with Cory Booger.
[3:27:12.760 --> 3:27:14.760]  I like to call him Cory Booger.
[3:27:14.760 --> 3:27:22.760]  His actual name is Cory Booger, but I like to call him Cory Booger because he's a snotty-nosed Booger that's trying to bring in more racism in the country.
[3:27:22.760 --> 3:27:24.760]  I mean, you've already seen it.
[3:27:24.760 --> 3:27:33.760]  Don Lemon, and he's a sour one, extra sour, come out talking about how white people are the problem in America, specifically white males.
[3:27:33.760 --> 3:27:37.760]  How sickening are the, how sickening is that?
[3:27:37.760 --> 3:27:39.760]  How sick are these people?
[3:27:39.760 --> 3:27:48.760]  You would think the year 2019 after Martin Luther King came and said that it's our character, not our color, that these people would embrace that.
[3:27:48.760 --> 3:27:52.760]  If Martin Luther King was walking around today, they would be attacking him.
[3:27:52.760 --> 3:27:54.760]  They would be calling him the Uncle Tom.
[3:27:54.760 --> 3:27:56.760]  They would be calling him the Coon.
[3:27:56.760 --> 3:27:59.760]  They would be calling him the race trader.
[3:27:59.760 --> 3:28:01.760]  Think about that.
[3:28:01.760 --> 3:28:04.760]  They would be calling him all of the hateful names that they call me.
[3:28:04.760 --> 3:28:07.760]  Martin Luther King was a Republican.
[3:28:07.760 --> 3:28:10.760]  He wasn't a Democratic KKK party member.
[3:28:10.760 --> 3:28:12.760]  He wasn't.
[3:28:12.760 --> 3:28:14.760]  He was not.
[3:28:14.760 --> 3:28:16.760]  So people need to understand.
[3:28:16.760 --> 3:28:26.760]  So when we come back from this break, I'm going to play the video with Cory Booger talking about white supremacy and how it's supposedly on the up-rise.
[3:28:26.760 --> 3:28:28.760]  We'll be right back after this message.
[3:28:28.760 --> 3:28:38.760]  God bless. See you in a minute.
[3:28:58.760 --> 3:29:02.760]  I cannot be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[3:29:02.760 --> 3:29:10.760]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:29:10.760 --> 3:29:16.760]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[3:29:16.760 --> 3:29:18.760]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[3:29:18.760 --> 3:29:20.760]  My diabetes has totally improved.

[3:33:22.760 --> 3:33:24.760]  Thank you for joining us.
[3:33:24.760 --> 3:33:28.760]  Before I get started and I was saying before the last in the last segment
[3:33:28.760 --> 3:33:31.760]  that I'm going to show a video with Cory Booger or Cory Booger.
[3:33:31.760 --> 3:33:33.760]  Let me talk about the supplements.
[3:33:33.760 --> 3:33:35.760]  This is huge.
[3:33:35.760 --> 3:33:38.760]  I'm really talking about it because the turbo force.
[3:33:38.760 --> 3:33:42.760]  I actually have a couple of turbo force right now on my desk and I'm drinking it.
[3:33:42.760 --> 3:33:44.760]  I like it hot personally.
[3:33:44.760 --> 3:33:46.760]  I make it hot and I'll sip it like tea.
[3:33:46.760 --> 3:33:51.760]  But right now with the free shipping storewide, how could you not take advantage of this?
[3:33:51.760 --> 3:33:54.760]  And it's 50% off.
[3:33:54.760 --> 3:33:55.760]  I mean, this is no brainer.
[3:33:55.760 --> 3:34:01.760]  I mean, I'm putting in the order myself because what you have double points on all purchases.
[3:34:01.760 --> 3:34:03.760]  This is amazing.
[3:34:03.760 --> 3:34:08.760]  50% off the brain force, the protein bars, turbo force.
[3:34:08.760 --> 3:34:12.760]  Now the turbo force, I've heard Alex Jones said the turbo force is about to sell out.
[3:34:12.760 --> 3:34:14.760]  I'm glad I got my box now.
[3:34:14.760 --> 3:34:21.760]  So I might order another box before it sells out because I can't express how wonderful this turbo force is.
[3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:24.760]  It really makes me feel like I can take on the world.
[3:34:24.760 --> 3:34:28.760]  I have the energy that is unbelievable without the crash.
[3:34:28.760 --> 3:34:30.760]  That's amazing to me.
[3:34:30.760 --> 3:34:35.760]  So and also you have all these different ones, the DNA, the DNA force plus.
[3:34:35.760 --> 3:34:47.760]  There's so many products on the infowarstore.com that you can get that take your ability to take on the world to the next level.

[3:34:49.760 --> 3:34:50.760]  I love it.
[3:34:50.760 --> 3:34:54.760]  And I'm not just saying that because I'm hosting a show on the info wars.
[3:34:54.760 --> 3:34:57.760]  I've been saying it before I got to this point.
[3:34:57.760 --> 3:35:01.760]  So please by all means check it out infowarstore.com.
[3:35:01.760 --> 3:35:02.760]  Check it out today.
[3:35:02.760 --> 3:35:03.760]  Check it out.
[3:35:03.760 --> 3:35:05.760]  Okay, so let's get on.
[3:35:05.760 --> 3:35:08.760]  Like I said, I had this video with Corey Booger.
[3:35:08.760 --> 3:35:18.760]  Okay, Corey Booger, where he also is going talking about how white supremacy is on the rise.
[3:35:18.760 --> 3:35:22.760]  And we should all should be paying attention exactly how they're spending this.
[3:35:22.760 --> 3:35:24.760]  And even the media is complicit with it.
[3:35:24.760 --> 3:35:32.760]  Even the media is going right along with the whole right supremacy is trying to take over and do all of these things.
[3:35:32.760 --> 3:35:38.760]  We cannot stand idly by why they do this.
[3:35:38.760 --> 3:35:39.760]  I'm not going to.
[3:35:39.760 --> 3:35:42.760]  I don't see white people as a problem.
[3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:50.760]  Just to be honest, there's been more white people in America, maybe partly because there's more white people in America.
[3:35:50.760 --> 3:35:57.760]  But there's been more white people in America that helped me and try to help me to succeed than black people have.
[3:35:57.760 --> 3:35:59.760]  You have to think about that.
[3:35:59.760 --> 3:36:05.760]  And really, when I think further back, the people that were helping me were Republicans.
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:13.760]  And I'm like, because I used to live in a state that was predominantly Republican, which was Arkansas, which is completely red.
[3:36:13.760 --> 3:36:15.760]  Well, for the most part, it's red.
[3:36:15.760 --> 3:36:21.760]  I mean, I have family members there that are still, for some reason, Democrats and for the life of me, I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it.
[3:36:21.760 --> 3:36:22.760]  But I digress.
[3:36:22.760 --> 3:36:28.760]  Okay, so let me get to this video with Corey Booger and with Corey Booger here.
[3:36:28.760 --> 3:36:31.760]  And you'd have to just pay attention to what he's saying.
[3:36:31.760 --> 3:36:33.760]  This is exactly what I've been talking about.
[3:36:33.760 --> 3:36:35.760]  Okay, so check this out.
[3:36:35.760 --> 3:36:38.760]  I got it queued here and we're going to play this for you.
[3:36:38.760 --> 3:36:42.760]  First of all, let's just understand what happened in New Zealand is horrific.
[3:36:42.760 --> 3:36:52.760]  And we should all pause and really express our sorrow in our mourning for the people who are struggling and suffering with those that grieve us loss.
[3:36:52.760 --> 3:37:04.760]  We have now a nation and we see this around the world where white supremacy and anti-Islamic vicious hate is manifesting itself in this kind of violence.
[3:37:04.760 --> 3:37:06.760]  And that's absolutely unacceptable.
[3:37:06.760 --> 3:37:09.760]  We in America know that kind of, America know that kind of hate.
[3:37:09.760 --> 3:37:17.760]  We've seen how white supremacy, the terrorist attacks being conducted by white supremacy organizations in this country all arise and we're obviously seeing a cold war.
[3:37:17.760 --> 3:37:21.760]  So I condemn that and this is why words matter.
[3:37:21.760 --> 3:37:24.760]  Okay, words do matter.
[3:37:24.760 --> 3:37:26.760]  Yeah, they absolutely do matter.
[3:37:26.760 --> 3:37:30.760]  What about Rochita to lead saying we're going to impeach the MFR?
[3:37:30.760 --> 3:37:32.760]  I mean, do words matter then?
[3:37:32.760 --> 3:37:37.760]  What about Ilhan Omar with her whole anti-Semitic comments?
[3:37:37.760 --> 3:37:39.760]  Do words matter then?
[3:37:39.760 --> 3:37:47.760]  See, he's referring to President Trump coming out saying that there were good people on both sides when it comes to Charlottesville.
[3:37:47.760 --> 3:37:51.760]  They keep emphasizing about Charlottesville, Charlottesville.
[3:37:51.760 --> 3:38:02.760]  That's the only thing they have on anything because they have one idiot decide to go out there and get in a vehicle and kill a person.
[3:38:02.760 --> 3:38:05.760]  Look how they're attacking President Trump because of that.
[3:38:05.760 --> 3:38:07.760]  He had nothing to do with that.
[3:38:07.760 --> 3:38:09.760]  Same thing with New Zealand.
[3:38:09.760 --> 3:38:12.760]  President Trump had nothing to do with that.
[3:38:12.760 --> 3:38:14.760]  Talking about words matter.
[3:38:14.760 --> 3:38:18.760]  They matter, but there were good people on both sides in Charlottesville.
[3:38:18.760 --> 3:38:20.760]  And for some reason they want to acknowledge that.
[3:38:20.760 --> 3:38:21.760]  You know why?
[3:38:21.760 --> 3:38:28.760]  Because when they said there was good people on both sides, when President Trump said there was good people on both sides, that's a true statement.
[3:38:28.760 --> 3:38:34.760]  But the liberals, they have a problem with saying that people on the right are good people.
[3:38:34.760 --> 3:38:37.760]  Only people on the left are good.
[3:38:37.760 --> 3:38:38.760]  That's what they're saying.
[3:38:38.760 --> 3:38:40.760]  Only people on the left are good people.
[3:38:40.760 --> 3:38:53.760]  Anyone on the right that love this country, that loves our First Amendment, our Second Amendment, loves God, and respects our President, those people they consider not being good.
[3:38:53.760 --> 3:39:01.760]  So, speaking of words, you had AOC, what I was talking about earlier, come out talking about white supremacy on the uprise.
[3:39:01.760 --> 3:39:03.760]  You have Cory Booker on uprise.
[3:39:03.760 --> 3:39:10.760]  Cory Booker goes on to say that you have all of these white supremacist groups attacking Islamic groups.
[3:39:10.760 --> 3:39:19.760]  Now, how many times in the past have you heard of white supremacist groups going out attacking Muslims at the mosque or Muslims on the street?
[3:39:19.760 --> 3:39:21.760]  How many times have you heard that?
[3:39:21.760 --> 3:39:32.760]  If it was happening as often as the liberal media is saying it, and even Cory Booker, you know good and well that all of these liberal media outlets will be displaying it.
[3:39:32.760 --> 3:39:34.760]  They will be showing it day in and day out.
[3:39:34.760 --> 3:39:36.760]  That would be non-stop.
[3:39:36.760 --> 3:39:41.760]  The reason why they keep going back to Charlottesville because that's the only thing that they have.
[3:39:41.760 --> 3:39:51.760]  Now, when I was in Portland and the police department did an excellent job the second time I was there, they kept Antifa from engaging with us.
[3:39:51.760 --> 3:39:56.760]  So, because Antifa could not engage with us, they started throwing rocks and bottles at the police department.
[3:39:56.760 --> 3:40:04.760]  So, rightfully so, the police department started throwing explosives back at them to break them up, to make them leave.
[3:40:04.760 --> 3:40:12.760]  And then the local liberal media said it was us that incited the violence that caused Antifa to be violent towards the police department.
[3:40:12.760 --> 3:40:14.760]  Do you see that?
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:17.760]  The brainwashing just right there, boom.
[3:40:17.760 --> 3:40:18.760]  Let's not highlight.
[3:40:18.760 --> 3:40:20.760]  Let's just brainwash them in the public.
[3:40:20.760 --> 3:40:22.760]  Let's just make it all happen right here.
[3:40:22.760 --> 3:40:28.760]  We don't need to hide it anymore because people are so done down, they're going to believe anything that the liberal media says.
[3:40:28.760 --> 3:40:30.760]  But that's not the case.
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:34.760]  That's the reason why CNN and the rest of them, their ratings are in the tank.
[3:40:34.760 --> 3:40:38.760]  I mean, I do videos myself and I get better ratings than CNN.
[3:40:38.760 --> 3:40:40.760]  It was just crazy.
[3:40:40.760 --> 3:40:49.760]  That's probably one of the reasons why Facebook is putting CNN on its pedestal and helping them push their message out.
[3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:52.760]  And they're banning conservatives.
[3:40:52.760 --> 3:40:55.760]  They're blocking conservatives.
[3:40:55.760 --> 3:40:57.760]  This is the problem in America.
[3:40:57.760 --> 3:40:59.760]  We're in Nazi Germany all over again.
[3:40:59.760 --> 3:41:01.760]  And guess who is the Gestapo?
[3:41:01.760 --> 3:41:03.760]  It is these tech companies.
[3:41:03.760 --> 3:41:07.760]  They're the ones who's trying to take us down, but I digress.
[3:41:07.760 --> 3:41:10.760]  I'm getting into tech companies as a whole different subject.
[3:41:10.760 --> 3:41:15.760]  I'm talking about the white supremacy that's supposedly taken over the planet.
[3:41:15.760 --> 3:41:19.760]  See, they don't want to talk about how ISIS is killing people.
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:28.760]  ISIS put people in cages over water and submerged the cage in the water and they watch it.
[3:41:28.760 --> 3:41:30.760]  How horrible is that?
[3:41:30.760 --> 3:41:33.760]  Where's the liberal media talking about that?
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:35.760]  Where's the liberal?
[3:41:35.760 --> 3:41:42.760]  Just a week or so ago, there was a report where they killed 60 Christians overseas.
[3:41:42.760 --> 3:41:51.760]  And I think another report showed it was more than 60, it was 100 plus Christians that were killed because they were Christians by these Muslim groups.
[3:41:51.760 --> 3:41:55.760]  And where is the liberal media at on that?
[3:41:55.760 --> 3:41:58.760]  Where's the outcry on that?
[3:41:58.760 --> 3:42:09.760]  And the only reason why they're talking about anything being anti-Semitic and the Democrat Party trying to bring up a whole resolution about it
[3:42:09.760 --> 3:42:16.760]  is because they don't want people to realize that Jewish people, they bring a lot of money.
[3:42:16.760 --> 3:42:20.760]  The Jewish community brings a lot of money to the Democrat Party.
[3:42:20.760 --> 3:42:25.760]  And they want to squash that really quick because they want that money and Nancy Pelosi knows it.
[3:42:25.760 --> 3:42:28.760]  But people in the Jewish community are leaving.
[3:42:28.760 --> 3:42:30.760]  My name is Will Johnson.
[3:42:30.760 --> 3:42:32.760]  This is the Alex Jones show.

[3:43:06.760 --> 3:43:13.760]  I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.

[3:43:16.760 --> 3:43:18.760]  So hallelujah.

[3:46:04.760 --> 3:46:07.760]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[3:46:07.760 --> 3:46:09.760]  I didn't invent all this.
[3:46:09.760 --> 3:46:14.760]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity,
[3:46:14.760 --> 3:46:16.760]  simply trying to bring it back.
[3:46:16.760 --> 3:46:19.760]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[3:46:19.760 --> 3:46:23.760]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately,
[3:46:23.760 --> 3:46:27.760]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine.
[3:46:27.760 --> 3:46:31.760]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars

[3:47:20.760 --> 3:47:23.760]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:23.760 --> 3:47:27.760]  My name is Will Johnson. Thank you for joining us.
[3:47:27.760 --> 3:47:32.760]  I was talking about in the last segment, I was talking about how Cory Booger
[3:47:32.760 --> 3:47:36.760]  and the rest of these Democrats are attacking white people,
[3:47:36.760 --> 3:47:38.760]  and they're not hiding any longer.
[3:47:38.760 --> 3:47:43.760]  I mean, it's like the playbook, the CNN is using the same playbook,
[3:47:43.760 --> 3:47:45.760]  all the liberal media is using the same playbook.
[3:47:45.760 --> 3:47:50.760]  And you have to wonder, why are they attacking white people like this?
[3:47:50.760 --> 3:47:54.760]  And since I really started recognizing how they're attacking white people like this,
[3:47:54.760 --> 3:48:00.760]  I come to realize that the Democrats are the common denominator
[3:48:00.760 --> 3:48:06.760]  how back in the day when you have black people out protesting against white Democrats
[3:48:06.760 --> 3:48:09.760]  trying to keep them from having civil rights, et cetera, et cetera,
[3:48:09.760 --> 3:48:13.760]  it was Democrats that holds down black people in the street.
[3:48:13.760 --> 3:48:19.760]  2019, the Democrats again are doing the same thing,
[3:48:19.760 --> 3:48:22.760]  but yet they want to do it to white people.
[3:48:22.760 --> 3:48:28.760]  I mean, it's like it's never ending vicious cycle with the Democrats,
[3:48:28.760 --> 3:48:31.760]  and they want black people to be under their thumb,
[3:48:31.760 --> 3:48:35.760]  and when black people decide to start leaving the Democrat Party,
[3:48:35.760 --> 3:48:38.760]  I've had conversations with people on social media,
[3:48:38.760 --> 3:48:42.760]  white liberals, black liberals, and for some reason, especially white liberals,
[3:48:42.760 --> 3:48:46.760]  they act like they have lost some property,
[3:48:46.760 --> 3:48:50.760]  and these black people are starting attacking me because I'm leaving,
[3:48:50.760 --> 3:48:52.760]  I've left the Democrat Party.
[3:48:52.760 --> 3:48:54.760]  I mean, isn't that the point?
[3:48:54.760 --> 3:48:59.760]  You're supposed to be a free thinker, but see, according to them, that is the problem.
[3:48:59.760 --> 3:49:02.760]  You can't think for yourself, not in this country.
[3:49:02.760 --> 3:49:06.760]  If you're black, you have to think the way the Democrats want you to think,
[3:49:06.760 --> 3:49:09.760]  and how despicable is that?
[3:49:09.760 --> 3:49:13.760]  And they know it, and they don't even say, they don't say,
[3:49:13.760 --> 3:49:16.760]  no, that's not the case, we want you to think for yourself.
[3:49:16.760 --> 3:49:21.760]  I've yet to hear them say, we want you to think for yourself.
[3:49:21.760 --> 3:49:23.760]  I've yet to hear them say that.
[3:49:23.760 --> 3:49:25.760]  Now, they might come out and start saying it now,
[3:49:25.760 --> 3:49:26.760]  but do they mean it?
[3:49:26.760 --> 3:49:28.760]  I really don't believe them.
[3:49:28.760 --> 3:49:29.760]  I really don't.
[3:49:29.760 --> 3:49:31.760]  I don't believe anything Democrats say,
[3:49:31.760 --> 3:49:35.760]  and never in my life again where I ever, ever vote for a Democrat.
[3:49:35.760 --> 3:49:40.760]  I will vote for a crooked Republican over a good Democrat any day now.
[3:49:40.760 --> 3:49:46.760]  And just as the way it is, because the Democrats, their policies and their beliefs,
[3:49:46.760 --> 3:49:48.760]  they don't have any morals.
[3:49:48.760 --> 3:49:50.760]  That's why they attack President Trump.
[3:49:50.760 --> 3:49:52.760]  You remember the whole sex state?
[3:49:52.760 --> 3:49:53.760]  Grab them.
[3:49:53.760 --> 3:49:57.760]  You know, they only, they only released that because it was like, oh,
[3:49:57.760 --> 3:50:00.760]  are you going to still support President Trump because he said that?
[3:50:00.760 --> 3:50:02.760]  See, you're conservative Christians.
[3:50:02.760 --> 3:50:03.760]  You're supposed to have morals.
[3:50:03.760 --> 3:50:05.760]  You're supposed to condemn it now.
[3:50:05.760 --> 3:50:10.760]  See, they forget that we understand Christ died for all of us.
[3:50:10.760 --> 3:50:12.760]  See, that's the part they don't realize.
[3:50:12.760 --> 3:50:15.760]  Democrats can't wrap their mind around that.
[3:50:15.760 --> 3:50:18.760]  So we know that President Trump is not a perfect man.
[3:50:18.760 --> 3:50:19.760]  We know that.
[3:50:19.760 --> 3:50:21.760]  Okay, but I digress.
[3:50:21.760 --> 3:50:27.760]  Let's get talking about how New Zealand and how the Democrats are pushing this whole thing
[3:50:27.760 --> 3:50:32.760]  about white supremacists and the races are trying to take over America.
[3:50:32.760 --> 3:50:34.760]  They're trying to take over the world.
[3:50:34.760 --> 3:50:35.760]  White supremacists.
[3:50:35.760 --> 3:50:37.760]  Now they're attacking black people.
[3:50:37.760 --> 3:50:39.760]  They're attacking Asian people.
[3:50:39.760 --> 3:50:41.760]  They're attacking Hispanic people.
[3:50:41.760 --> 3:50:42.760]  Build the wall.
[3:50:42.760 --> 3:50:45.760]  They're attacking Muslims now, which is not true.
[3:50:45.760 --> 3:50:47.760]  None of is true.
[3:50:47.760 --> 3:50:50.760]  But for some reason they are happy to promote it that way.
[3:50:50.760 --> 3:50:55.760]  And for some reason people are still naive to believe every word that they're saying.
[3:50:55.760 --> 3:50:57.760]  And I don't understand it.
[3:50:57.760 --> 3:50:59.760]  I really don't.
[3:50:59.760 --> 3:51:05.760]  When I considered myself a dummy crat, I didn't have all this hatred for white people because
[3:51:05.760 --> 3:51:10.760]  see the Democrats, they have us to believe that white people in the Democrat Party are
[3:51:10.760 --> 3:51:12.760]  for us.
[3:51:12.760 --> 3:51:15.760]  But it's not this can be further from the truth.
[3:51:15.760 --> 3:51:17.760]  And I don't understand it.
[3:51:17.760 --> 3:51:18.760]  I really don't.
[3:51:18.760 --> 3:51:20.760]  I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it.
[3:51:20.760 --> 3:51:26.760]  I guess because when I woke up to it, then I started going like, man, I can't even understand
[3:51:26.760 --> 3:51:32.760]  how they used to support the Democrat Party, knowing how they were doing us, seeing how
[3:51:32.760 --> 3:51:34.760]  they've done black people.
[3:51:34.760 --> 3:51:36.760]  And now I see they're doing it to Hispanics.
[3:51:36.760 --> 3:51:43.760]  And now the Jewish community, they see them doing it to the Jewish community.
[3:51:43.760 --> 3:51:46.760]  And they see it and it's happening.
[3:51:46.760 --> 3:51:52.760]  So the whole thing with them coming out talking about white supremacists, AOC doing it, where
[3:51:52.760 --> 3:51:56.760]  are all the politicians denouncing this?
[3:51:56.760 --> 3:52:01.760]  Where are the politicians coming out saying, no, we really know that's not the case?
[3:52:01.760 --> 3:52:03.760]  Where are they saying it?
[3:52:03.760 --> 3:52:07.760]  Here's a screenshot that I took of Dan Crenshaw.
[3:52:07.760 --> 3:52:10.760]  And I really have mad respect for this gentleman.
[3:52:10.760 --> 3:52:12.760]  Here's a screenshot from his tweet.
[3:52:12.760 --> 3:52:19.760]  And he goes on to say, if you find yourself using the tragedy in New Zealand to take a
[3:52:19.760 --> 3:52:26.760]  black-handed swipe at conservatives in America, many of my colleagues already have, then you
[3:52:26.760 --> 3:52:31.760]  have no shame and you are part of the problem.
[3:52:31.760 --> 3:52:40.760]  It should be easy for us to stand united and condemn terrorism.
[3:52:40.760 --> 3:52:41.760]  Right?
[3:52:41.760 --> 3:52:42.760]  Right?
[3:52:42.760 --> 3:52:44.760]  We all should stand united and condemn terrorism.
[3:52:44.760 --> 3:52:48.760]  No one is condoning the killing of innocent people.
[3:52:48.760 --> 3:52:51.760]  Even if you disagree in their beliefs.
[3:52:51.760 --> 3:52:53.760]  No one's condoning that.
[3:52:53.760 --> 3:52:58.760]  To go back to Charlottesville, President Trump did not condone the killing of a young lady
[3:52:58.760 --> 3:53:00.760]  that took place there.
[3:53:00.760 --> 3:53:01.760]  Not at all.
[3:53:01.760 --> 3:53:05.760]  But see, the bluff, they can't wrap their mind around it that he said something positive
[3:53:05.760 --> 3:53:09.760]  about the people on the right.
[3:53:09.760 --> 3:53:11.760]  They can't wrap their mind around it.
[3:53:11.760 --> 3:53:13.760]  They can't understand it.
[3:53:13.760 --> 3:53:15.760]  I don't understand it.
[3:53:15.760 --> 3:53:18.760]  How they can't understand logic.
[3:53:18.760 --> 3:53:22.760]  How is it they don't understand reality any longer?
[3:53:22.760 --> 3:53:25.760]  The left, they hate reality.
[3:53:25.760 --> 3:53:33.760]  And without going into great detail, they are trying to change the mind of children.
[3:53:33.760 --> 3:53:37.760]  And all this relates back to, my opinion, to white supremacy.
[3:53:37.760 --> 3:53:40.760]  They don't want to get rid of white people because majority of the white people in this
[3:53:40.760 --> 3:53:43.760]  country happen to be Christians.
[3:53:43.760 --> 3:53:45.760]  That's what it ultimately comes down to.
[3:53:45.760 --> 3:53:49.760]  And Christian, the number one reason why they're attacking white people, that's my
[3:53:49.760 --> 3:53:53.760]  opinion because other than white people being soft targets because not enough white people
[3:53:53.760 --> 3:53:55.760]  don't say anything.
[3:53:55.760 --> 3:53:57.760]  And that runs off through me.
[3:53:57.760 --> 3:54:01.760]  Because white people, they're called racism and everything else.
[3:54:01.760 --> 3:54:05.760]  They're called a racist and they don't say anything.
[3:54:05.760 --> 3:54:07.760]  That runs off through me.
[3:54:07.760 --> 3:54:10.760]  I take it personal because white people don't say enough to say stop.
[3:54:10.760 --> 3:54:13.760]  You're the one that's racist because you're saying that about me.
[3:54:13.760 --> 3:54:19.760]  I've never done anything to give you any kind of notion or idea that I'm racist simply because
[3:54:19.760 --> 3:54:22.760]  I'm white and you're calling me that or because I support President Trump.
[3:54:22.760 --> 3:54:24.760]  You're the one that's racist.
[3:54:24.760 --> 3:54:26.760]  White people need to say that.
[3:54:26.760 --> 3:54:29.760]  It's a pet pee of mine because I'm a black male.
[3:54:29.760 --> 3:54:31.760]  I don't want it happening.
[3:54:31.760 --> 3:54:34.760]  Martin Luther King didn't want it happening and I don't want it happening.
[3:54:34.760 --> 3:54:38.760]  As an American citizen, we all shouldn't want it to happen.
[3:54:38.760 --> 3:54:40.760]  But they're doing it.
[3:54:40.760 --> 3:54:44.760]  They're absolutely doing it.
[3:54:44.760 --> 3:54:45.760]  Okay.
[3:54:45.760 --> 3:54:48.760]  We're almost at the end here and I want to say this.
[3:54:48.760 --> 3:54:54.760]  It's been an extreme honor to come on here and talk about the different things that's
[3:54:54.760 --> 3:54:58.760]  taking place in this country, the different events that's taking place.
[3:54:58.760 --> 3:54:59.760]  And it's true.
[3:54:59.760 --> 3:55:02.760]  Info Wars is at the tip of the spear.
[3:55:02.760 --> 3:55:07.760]  And it's so important to funinfowars.com.
[3:55:07.760 --> 3:55:09.760]  I mean, we've got to.
[3:55:09.760 --> 3:55:15.760]  This is how this is how we fight the enemy by you going to infowarstore.com.

[3:55:18.760 --> 3:55:22.760]  You don't have if you're a lot of people are scared to use their voice.
[3:55:22.760 --> 3:55:27.760]  A lot of people are scared to go out and do videos because they're afraid of their friends
[3:55:27.760 --> 3:55:29.760]  and family attacking them.
[3:55:29.760 --> 3:55:30.760]  I've lost family.
[3:55:30.760 --> 3:55:35.760]  I've lost friends of 20 plus years because I show my support for President Trump.
[3:55:35.760 --> 3:55:38.760]  That doesn't mean I'm going to stop because it's the right thing to do.

[3:55:49.760 --> 3:55:54.760]  Can you imagine how the left feels about me being on infowars.com?
[3:55:54.760 --> 3:55:55.760]  Think about that.
[3:55:55.760 --> 3:55:58.760]  They've already tried to say Info Wars is racist.
[3:55:58.760 --> 3:56:05.760]  Really, really, all the people that I've come in contact with at Info Wars have been one
[3:56:05.760 --> 3:56:08.760]  of the best group of people that I've ever come across.
[3:56:08.760 --> 3:56:10.760]  And it's not that they need me.
[3:56:10.760 --> 3:56:11.760]  They don't.
[3:56:11.760 --> 3:56:13.760]  See, that's the point.
[3:56:13.760 --> 3:56:16.760]  They're doing this because they love this country.
[3:56:16.760 --> 3:56:21.760]  I'm here because they know I love this country and they know that I'm going to fight for this country.
[3:56:21.760 --> 3:56:25.760]  And I'm going to fight for the people in this country.
[3:56:25.760 --> 3:56:32.760]  And one of the things that you can do is go to infowarsstore.com.
[3:56:32.760 --> 3:56:34.760]  Get the turbo force.
[3:56:34.760 --> 3:56:35.760]  I have my box.
[3:56:35.760 --> 3:56:39.760]  I keep it right here because I talk about it all the time.
[3:56:39.760 --> 3:56:40.760]  Turbo force.
[3:56:40.760 --> 3:56:42.760]  It's great.
[3:56:42.760 --> 3:56:47.760]  You know, the next time I go out, when I go to these rallies and stuff, I'm going to take my turbo force with me.
[3:56:47.760 --> 3:56:54.760]  And I have a whole box and I may share a couple with some people just so they'll know, so they'll understand.
[3:56:54.760 --> 3:56:57.760]  If you come to a rally that I met, I may have a packet for you.
[3:56:57.760 --> 3:57:02.760]  But anyway, the year 2020 is coming.
[3:57:02.760 --> 3:57:05.760]  They're demonizing white people because of President Trump.
[3:57:05.760 --> 3:57:11.760]  They're demonizing all of us that support the president.
[3:57:11.760 --> 3:57:17.760]  And it's becoming to a point to where we have to realize that we're in this battle together.
[3:57:17.760 --> 3:57:20.760]  We're in this spiritual war together.
[3:57:20.760 --> 3:57:23.760]  We have to stand up and unite together.
[3:57:23.760 --> 3:57:25.760]  I want to thank everybody for watching.
[3:57:25.760 --> 3:57:27.760]  My name is Will Johnson.
[3:57:27.760 --> 3:57:28.760]  UnitedAmericaFirst.com.
[3:57:28.760 --> 3:57:31.760]  This is infowars.com.
[3:57:31.760 --> 3:57:33.760]  The Alex Jones show.

[3:57:35.760 --> 3:57:39.760]  Don't let them tell you otherwise.
[3:57:39.760 --> 3:57:40.760]  Get in the fight.
[3:57:40.760 --> 3:57:42.760]  Just get in the fight.
[3:57:42.760 --> 3:57:45.760]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[3:57:45.760 --> 3:57:47.760]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[3:57:47.760 --> 3:57:50.760]  And most of them are funded by the globalist.
[3:57:50.760 --> 3:57:53.760]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[3:57:53.760 --> 3:57:56.760]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[3:57:56.760 --> 3:57:58.760]  I didn't invent all this.
[3:57:58.760 --> 3:58:03.760]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity.
[3:58:03.760 --> 3:58:05.760]  And I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[3:58:05.760 --> 3:58:08.760]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[3:58:08.760 --> 3:58:12.760]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[3:58:12.760 --> 3:58:16.760]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[3:58:16.760 --> 3:58:20.760]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars
