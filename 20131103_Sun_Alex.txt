[00:00.000 --> 00:17.640]  We are on the march the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[00:22.600 --> 00:28.440]  Well, we've got a full plate ladies and gentlemen lined up for you of absolutely vital information
[00:28.440 --> 00:36.240]  on this third day of November 2013 on this two-hour Sunday abbreviated
[00:37.240 --> 00:40.920]  Transmission three to three hours weekdays 11 a.m. To 2 p.m.
[00:41.520 --> 00:46.360]  Central and then of course the two-hour transmission every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central
[00:47.360 --> 00:51.680]  Wow, there is so much to get into huge developments on the Obamacare front
[00:52.360 --> 00:57.840]  With the Obamacare architect admitting the plan is to get rid of the individual
[00:57.840 --> 01:04.400]  Having a insurance market and everyone being forced into a collectivist market
[01:04.600 --> 01:11.360]  We're going to be getting into that admission of course they always admitted that but just thought their constituents were morons and would say that
[01:11.360 --> 01:14.880]  We were liars when we pointed out what they were actually planning
[01:16.520 --> 01:18.760]  We're also going to get into a book
[01:19.360 --> 01:23.320]  Written with AIDS of the obama where he would brag about what a great killer
[01:23.320 --> 01:26.840]  He was and how manly it was to order drones to kill people
[01:26.840 --> 01:30.120]  You know obama reportedly said I'm really good at killing people
[01:31.080 --> 01:33.520]  Yes, and then giving the drone pilots
[01:34.160 --> 01:39.280]  Above Purple Hearts when Audie Murphy got Purple Hearts for being wounded and shot by
[01:39.800 --> 01:43.120]  German soldiers that was nothing compared to a drone pilot or
[01:44.080 --> 01:48.160]  Someone giving orders to the drone pilot that they're even greater
[01:48.720 --> 01:55.600]  Greater heroes perhaps we should give him a thousand grabbing inflation in the dollar about a thousand Nobel Prizes a
[01:55.600 --> 01:57.600]  Thousand Nobel Prizes a minute
[01:58.680 --> 02:01.720]  Or a thousand Nobel Prizes a second we could give him
[02:02.520 --> 02:04.520]  57 trillion Nobel Prizes
[02:05.120 --> 02:11.000]  And that would make all the funding al-qaeda and funding torture and secret arrest and warrantless wiretapping and
[02:11.760 --> 02:19.320]  bid rigging and no bid contracts and hiring more lobbyists than anyone before him and bankrupting the country that makes it all okay, so we're going to get into
[02:20.520 --> 02:22.520]  Obamacare the latest on NSA
[02:23.240 --> 02:24.840]  We're going to get into
[02:24.840 --> 02:30.160]  Panetta former sect dev says u.s. May have to use military force against iran and
[02:31.840 --> 02:33.840]  We're also going to get into
[02:34.200 --> 02:40.840]  Obama using executive orders to bypass Congress on carbon taxes and more and then of course the big news I
[02:41.080 --> 02:45.000]  Have to cover it to protect ourselves really but also to illustrate media control
[02:46.160 --> 02:51.640]  The lax shooting that left one dead and six wounded
[02:51.640 --> 02:54.760]  Unfortunately, if you even believe the official story
[02:55.480 --> 02:59.320]  But it looks like it actually happened sometimes they staged stuff entirely like Gulf of Tonkin
[02:59.560 --> 03:04.280]  They have government documents like Operation Northwood some about how to stage mass shootings and blame on their political enemies
[03:04.280 --> 03:08.680]  So we have to know that it is possible with this crew to do anything, but it probably happened
[03:09.240 --> 03:11.240]  but the issue is that
[03:12.600 --> 03:15.320]  The official narrative has disintegrated
[03:16.240 --> 03:19.440]  And we're gonna be going over that and of the southern public law center
[03:19.440 --> 03:24.040]  It's basically a White House front group demonizes anybody that isn't
[03:24.760 --> 03:26.480]  Left of Stalin
[03:26.480 --> 03:31.720]  They have come out now and you demonize. What do you think they demonized it?
[03:32.160 --> 03:35.800]  Just wild guess, you know a lot of them was a mass shooting. I say gee
[03:35.800 --> 03:40.880]  I hope they don't blame me somehow then they'll have national stories going Jones is delusional
[03:40.880 --> 03:43.200]  He thinks they might try to connect him to it
[03:44.880 --> 03:47.280]  And then they go ahead and still try to connect me to it
[03:47.280 --> 03:48.640]  I
[03:48.640 --> 03:54.680]  Mean I shouldn't laugh about it, but it's really weird Boston bombing no connection to me
[03:55.240 --> 03:56.040]  and
[03:56.040 --> 04:01.600]  They came out when I said that well, there was a drill and there was a government agencies involved and showed proof
[04:01.680 --> 04:04.240]  Their response was a you're involved Alex
[04:04.560 --> 04:10.600]  And they produced some local libertarian magazine that I wasn't even in as the proof now to be honest
[04:10.600 --> 04:13.920]  I do have 15 million listeners a lot of folks that come along that you know
[04:13.920 --> 04:19.160]  Listen to the show or watch it online. It's so it's actually hundreds of millions that know who we are globally
[04:19.160 --> 04:21.360]  That's a conservative estimate. So sure. It's like saying
[04:21.960 --> 04:26.160]  Did you watch Jay Leno? Yeah, I know who he is. Well, that's it
[04:26.160 --> 04:28.240]  It's his fault in the Boston bombing as well
[04:28.240 --> 04:33.840]  But they could ask the surviving brother the surviving Patsy the Boston bombing if he's ever heard of Jay Leno
[04:34.600 --> 04:38.960]  And then if he says yes, I've heard of Jay Leno or Obama then it's Obama's fault
[04:38.960 --> 04:45.480]  Actually, it is probably if Obama's controllers obviously did it the evidence on that is stacked to the rafters
[04:45.480 --> 04:50.440]  But we're gonna come back and break down this as well and folks saying he was dressed up multiple witnesses
[04:51.280 --> 04:57.720]  Credible witnesses saying no he was dressed up as a TSA agent sounds like a drill to me. It's the script
[04:58.920 --> 05:04.040]  Introducing pro one all of your filtration in one system portable on the go
[05:04.040 --> 05:11.960]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride? You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to
[05:12.520 --> 05:19.780]  95% of hydrofluorosalic acid advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new
[05:20.280 --> 05:25.800]  Aquametics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element

[05:40.120 --> 05:47.320]  Ammonia and chlorine hydrofluorosalic acid the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands and
[05:47.520 --> 05:53.200]  Sodium hexafluorosilicate get your pro pure with the new pro one filter today at infowarstore.com
[05:53.200 --> 06:01.760]  Or by calling 888-253-3139
[06:05.800 --> 06:11.640]  In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwanted influence
[06:11.880 --> 06:15.840]  Whether sought or unsought by the military industrial
[06:16.640 --> 06:22.440]  In Dallas, Texas three shots were fired at president Kennedy's motorcade and down found Dallas
[06:22.440 --> 06:30.800]  The first report to play at a president Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting. It is a big idea a
[06:31.480 --> 06:33.480]  new order
[06:35.840 --> 06:39.680]  It was almost as if it were a plan to implode it just
[06:39.680 --> 06:49.840]  Hey, hey, either you're with us or you're with the terrorists
[06:49.840 --> 06:59.840]  Oh
[06:59.840 --> 07:05.920]  But I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals
[07:10.040 --> 07:12.400]  Guns will be taken no one will be able to be off
[07:13.680 --> 07:15.640]  For many of the police and guard troops
[07:15.640 --> 07:20.120]  It is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city global governance at last
[07:20.120 --> 07:22.760]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[07:22.760 --> 07:26.560]  But are we all just living and dying from what the central banks do?
[07:32.640 --> 07:37.440]  Live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[07:38.560 --> 07:44.760]  And it is Sunday the third day of November 2013. I'm your host Alex Jones
[07:44.760 --> 07:51.560]  We're going to cover the news today and boy, is there a lot of incredibly important news very weighty issues
[07:51.680 --> 07:56.800]  And we'll also open the phones up on world events. We're going to get into the very
[07:58.040 --> 07:59.880]  suspicious
[07:59.880 --> 08:04.440]  Tragic events at LA X leaving one dead six wounded
[08:04.960 --> 08:12.520]  That fits in with more than 20 drills. They've had no evidence. It was coming of a libertarian right winger
[08:12.520 --> 08:15.720]  shooting up the precious TSA and
[08:17.320 --> 08:25.640]  So we're going to be looking at this because it has all the earmarks all the signature hallmarks of a false flag
[08:25.640 --> 08:27.640]  And we know the globalists have been caught
[08:28.040 --> 08:32.400]  Doing this before it's called a gambit in military strategy
[08:33.000 --> 08:39.720]  Where you sacrifice some of your own people in a staged event as a pretext to wave the bloody shirt and mobilize
[08:39.720 --> 08:42.440]  Your operation against the general public
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.360]  It is a 3000 year old chess move and it's 101 in military
[08:49.080 --> 08:50.320]  strategy and
[08:50.320 --> 08:52.320]  stratagem
[08:52.320 --> 08:59.680]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down and our so-called government has a long long long
[09:00.480 --> 09:02.480]  history
[09:02.840 --> 09:06.800]  Staging events and being caught attacking our own ships to get us into Vietnam
[09:06.800 --> 09:09.520]  Valve of Tonkin or saying they were attacked
[09:10.120 --> 09:14.720]  Cy Hirsch pulled a surprise one or two times of course broke in New Yorker a few years ago
[09:14.720 --> 09:19.600]  The plan to have US Navy SEALs attack our own ships the blame it on Iran of all people George W. Bush
[09:19.840 --> 09:25.520]  Blocked Dick Cheney from doing it and there's hundreds of other examples. So the point is
[09:26.480 --> 09:28.760]  State-run media like MSNBC CNN
[09:28.760 --> 09:35.400]  They're going to be aghast that we point out some of the telltale signs of this perhaps being a staged event
[09:35.400 --> 09:37.400]  Boston bombing if you remember
[09:38.240 --> 09:45.240]  Totally hands-down both brothers government operas one of them publicly on CIA payroll protected for years part of a drill
[09:45.240 --> 09:47.240]  We know they were having that was even the Boston Globe
[09:47.520 --> 09:52.400]  Our reporters went and covered it were threatened by Secret Service who weren't even around the president there
[09:52.400 --> 09:57.720]  They were just there to threaten people covering up Saudi nationals clearly involved and so much more and
[09:58.480 --> 10:04.720]  For for exposing that they then had MSNBC and others come out with no evidence. We played this clip here
[10:04.720 --> 10:10.400]  And you can just type in MSNBC says Alex Jones behind the Boston bombing and on quite a few TV shows
[10:10.400 --> 10:12.920]  They say I am behind it and then show no evidence
[10:12.920 --> 10:17.360]  I lawyer says I could clearly win a lawsuit for defamation hands-down
[10:17.360 --> 10:22.400]  But I mean they're so discredited anyways and MSNBC gets government stimulus money
[10:22.400 --> 10:28.480]  So I'm just be taxpayer money. My goal is not to win a multi-million dollar lawsuit. It's just to discredit these people and
[10:28.480 --> 10:34.240]  But the point is they are very upset about us exposing them. So we're gonna be getting into that in a moment
[10:35.080 --> 10:42.600]  There it is MSNBC blames Boston bombing on deeply racist Alex Jones and then showed no clips of me being racist and no
[10:44.040 --> 10:48.400]  No clips of me connected to the Boston bombing in any way except for my reporter
[10:49.160 --> 10:56.880]  asking questions at stage press conferences about the drill but the Boston Globe and a local TV station minute and the still photos by the
[10:56.880 --> 10:58.280]  thousands of
[10:58.280 --> 11:00.920]  men in military outfits with black backpacks
[11:02.120 --> 11:03.360]  running around
[11:03.360 --> 11:05.360]  during and after the bombing
[11:05.960 --> 11:09.040]  and all the rest of it so
[11:10.160 --> 11:16.320]  And the fact that al-Qaeda in Chechnya is run by the CIA on record and the older brother was on the CIA payroll
[11:16.320 --> 11:21.080]  But I'm already digressing. We just see this over and over again. In fact, let me just cover this now
[11:21.080 --> 11:25.120]  Then I'll get into huge developments on Obamacare huge developments of the Middle East
[11:25.120 --> 11:28.120]  Big developments on the NSA front
[11:28.720 --> 11:33.560]  Obama is now bragging that he's quote really good at killing people. That's big news
[11:34.200 --> 11:37.360]  So give another peace price for that. He's really macho and tough
[11:37.880 --> 11:43.840]  Very gangsters. We're gonna be breaking that down. But let's first just just just get into the whole false flag situation
[11:45.400 --> 11:50.640]  Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag in February 27th 1933
[11:50.640 --> 11:57.560]  He was already elected as the leader of the country, but he wanted to abolish their bill of rights a constitution in the Weimar Republic
[11:58.080 --> 12:03.240]  And to have Kaiser Wilhelm step down so he did get that done using the the
[12:04.040 --> 12:11.560]  Destroying of their own capital building their firebombing of the capital building of the Reichstag to get that job done
[12:12.680 --> 12:15.640]  And it had always been rumored to be a false flag
[12:15.640 --> 12:21.520]  But a couple years ago. It was declassified. I don't know why the West declassified that well, actually
[12:21.520 --> 12:25.920]  I know why they don't want you thinking about things like that that it was indeed a staged event by Hermann Göring
[12:26.280 --> 12:28.880]  Then we even know more about operation Himmler
[12:29.600 --> 12:33.640]  You wonder how Nazi Germany with its high-tech military in 1939
[12:34.480 --> 12:39.280]  1940 attacked Poland that had horse-drawn carriages and was a World War one-style army
[12:40.280 --> 12:44.760]  Well, they attacked us. Excuse me 40 and slip Nazi bases
[12:44.760 --> 12:52.720]  Along the German-Polish border in operation Himmler that was declassified in the Nuremberg trials
[12:53.480 --> 13:00.280]  And in operation Himmler, they attacked bases at Gliwitz and others would even dress up local concentration camp victims in
[13:03.440 --> 13:06.760]  Polish regalia and German regalia and
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.480]  They would then of course shoot them so it looks real real
[13:12.480 --> 13:16.000]  And then shoot film footage 16 millimeter
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.520]  I guess for the German cinema was where you went to the news to get your movie for
[13:23.120 --> 13:24.600]  Whatever
[13:24.600 --> 13:30.880]  10th of a mark was and then you would also get 30 minutes of Hitlerian propaganda newsreels before as they were called
[13:30.880 --> 13:33.920]  we got that here as well just our our form of propaganda and
[13:35.160 --> 13:38.040]  That they said how dare the Poles attack us and then the rest is history
[13:38.040 --> 13:44.360]  So the point is when the media acts all aghast at this, it's like being aghast at the Sun coming up in the morning
[13:44.600 --> 13:46.600]  This is a standard operating procedure
[13:48.280 --> 13:54.560]  To do these type of things and the fact is we have criminal elements in our government that blew up the main in
[13:54.880 --> 13:57.240]  1898 to get us in the Spanish-American War
[13:58.080 --> 14:00.480]  The stage massacres in Cuba
[14:01.000 --> 14:05.240]  To then blame it on the forces there to invade in 1898 as well
[14:05.240 --> 14:11.920]  And then just since then it was declassified a decade ago that Bobby Kennedy went to his brother and wanted to blow up US
[14:13.360 --> 14:18.040]  Consulates in in in the South America as a pretext to invade there
[14:18.800 --> 14:23.600]  Because the Pentagon had been coming to him as well wanting to push that so because Kennedy had said no
[14:23.600 --> 14:27.160]  They went to his brother. So the fact is you're just knee-deep in this
[14:27.800 --> 14:32.200]  Actually up to your eyeballs and examples of false flags and you've got the TSA
[14:32.200 --> 14:36.160]  Wanting to roll out armed agents on the streets of America. It's already begun
[14:37.200 --> 14:41.280]  Wanting to set up checkpoints on highways wanting to set up checkpoints outside the airport
[14:41.280 --> 14:44.480]  They already searched your car every parking long-term parking without a warrant
[14:44.800 --> 14:51.400]  They're now shifting from saying Al Qaeda is the reason because everybody knows that's a hoax and a fraud and our government publicly runs them in Libya
[14:51.400 --> 14:53.400]  And Syria and Egypt everywhere else
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.260]  So that's mainstream news. So now they're seguing in the news saying, oh, no, it's veterans gun owners libertarians
[14:59.260 --> 15:06.700]  Conservatives they're going to attack us and they had 20 drills in the last couple months. We had an article five days ago
[15:07.460 --> 15:10.700]  Showing all these drills where the TSA is attacked by libertarians
[15:10.700 --> 15:15.700]  And I'm going to show you some articles about that and play some news clips not just us saying it
[15:15.700 --> 15:22.220]  We're going to show you that they go, okay, the libertarians are gonna come shoot us now and they're the new enemy. Okay, it's not Al Qaeda
[15:22.420 --> 15:25.940]  It's the gun owners and the returning veterans and libertarians
[15:25.940 --> 15:31.540]  All right, who don't want to set up checkpoints on the highway and totally taken over as a national police force. They're gonna attack
[15:31.540 --> 15:33.540]  Oh my goodness
[15:33.660 --> 15:35.660]  somebody dressed up
[15:36.340 --> 15:42.020]  Like a TSA agent came in and shot some people. We don't know what happened and it turns out I said Friday
[15:42.020 --> 15:46.180]  It may not be a false flag. Maybe a mentally ill person or maybe somebody going postal
[15:46.260 --> 15:52.040]  But I said if they have a drill and if they were dressed up like TSA, it's a false flag. Well, there was a drill
[15:52.040 --> 15:58.420]  Dressed up like TSA. It's probably a false flag. I mean, I'm an expert on false flags. It looks like a big giant false flag
[16:00.320 --> 16:06.600]  Alex Jones here and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show my patriot supply as you might remember
[16:06.840 --> 16:09.880]  This is the company that stood up to the DHS and

[16:14.440 --> 16:22.200]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow patriots

[19:57.800 --> 20:12.760]  Coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[20:16.680 --> 20:21.240]  We now take you live to the central texas command center
[20:22.200 --> 20:24.200]  And the heart of the resistance
[20:24.200 --> 20:27.480]  Rallying patriots worldwide
[20:31.800 --> 20:34.440]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[20:38.280 --> 20:43.640]  So if you go up to info wars dot com you can see the article tsa shooting narrative
[20:44.520 --> 20:46.520]  disintegrates
[20:46.520 --> 20:50.760]  And again if you question known liars who've been caught staging events over and over again
[20:50.760 --> 20:57.480]  And you're a conspiracy theorist, but everybody in history including our founding fathers especially
[20:57.880 --> 21:02.120]  Knew that you don't trust big government big corporations big powerful institutions
[21:02.120 --> 21:06.520]  You've got to hold them to task because historically they are the most dangerous things around
[21:07.160 --> 21:13.480]  Government in the 20th century according to the university of hawaii study killed 262 million people in the last century alone
[21:13.880 --> 21:18.040]  The term is demo side if you'd like to look it up. That's a non military deaths
[21:18.040 --> 21:23.400]  Not military bombing london or bombing dresden or bombing tokyo
[21:24.120 --> 21:27.160]  Not the allies attack in germany or germany attack in england
[21:28.120 --> 21:29.480]  no no
[21:29.480 --> 21:37.080]  Governments lining people up and or hanging them civilians cold-bloodedly executing them 262 mil
[21:38.520 --> 21:42.680]  So it's always the biggest threat, but you say hey, we better keep this government under control
[21:42.680 --> 21:49.400]  Hey, the deficit's 17 trillion and that's more than our GDP every year and every economist says we're in deep trouble basically
[21:49.880 --> 21:53.640]  But obama says if you raise the debt ceiling that doesn't raise the debt
[21:54.280 --> 21:58.280]  And if you built a business you didn't build that and by the way, you're going to be able to keep your insurance
[21:58.280 --> 22:00.280]  Don't listen to anybody that tells you that
[22:00.280 --> 22:01.880]  Remember all these lies
[22:01.880 --> 22:07.320]  And we'd say actually the bill says you can't keep your insurance in most cases and it's going to double it shut up racist
[22:08.120 --> 22:11.560]  Literally and you're like what's that do with race? That's what all racists say
[22:11.560 --> 22:15.000]  They just change the subject because it's a criminal takeover
[22:16.680 --> 22:23.000]  So you've got the tsa that is outside of sworn officers outside of spree decor outside of military history
[22:23.400 --> 22:25.400]  outside of the jag culture
[22:25.480 --> 22:27.960]  Which isn't perfect, but compared to just a whole new
[22:28.600 --> 22:31.560]  Agency and a whole new enforcement arm. That's what every
[22:32.520 --> 22:36.280]  dictator did linen Stalin mal hitler
[22:36.280 --> 22:42.520]  Pull pot every Caesar when he took over set up his own new internal police force
[22:42.760 --> 22:50.440]  You always set up a new group that doesn't have clicks that doesn't have infighting which is a good thing separation of powers that doesn't have
[22:50.920 --> 22:51.720]  uh
[22:51.720 --> 22:58.200]  Any good guys in it that doesn't have any checks and balances you create your ss your sa
[22:59.880 --> 23:02.920]  And that's what the tsa is and you laugh at them and go
[23:02.920 --> 23:08.920]  So waddling around searching people well now it's armed on the streets now. It's armored vehicles now. It's you see
[23:09.640 --> 23:15.240]  That's how this praetorian guard gets set up and they always do it smartly as a non-threatening thing
[23:15.720 --> 23:17.720]  So many people have faith throughout history
[23:18.280 --> 23:22.760]  You can study it as well would like to say we're going to have a port security forces 10 guys
[23:23.480 --> 23:27.400]  And then 10 years later 20 years later. It's it's 5000 troops
[23:27.400 --> 23:34.840]  I mean i'm just using one example from the Byzantine empire and one account i read of some local governor that created his own army that way
[23:35.320 --> 23:37.320]  This is mission creep
[23:37.400 --> 23:39.400]  And this is what these agencies do
[23:39.960 --> 23:46.920]  And this is what all the military industrial complex most of them foreign bank owned are setting up is a militarization of everything
[23:47.240 --> 23:51.000]  Where everything spies on us everything tracks us and we've got to pay for it
[23:51.240 --> 23:54.920]  We got to pay for our car to have all these boxes taxing us and tracking us
[23:54.920 --> 23:59.960]  We got to pay for the smart meter that dials into all our digital devices and surveils us on record
[24:00.120 --> 24:02.520]  We we pay for our own enslavement
[24:02.760 --> 24:09.240]  We pay in the phone bill for fees under national security that paid since the telecommunications act of 96
[24:10.520 --> 24:16.680]  To have the nsa grids put in you pay for your own enslavement. And so i'm sitting here
[24:19.320 --> 24:22.600]  Seeing the tsa have drills all over the united states
[24:22.600 --> 24:24.600]  of gun owners
[24:26.920 --> 24:30.440]  Attacking them libertarians attacking them that way they can demonize their enemy
[24:30.600 --> 24:33.160]  Oh the people that don't like us they're coming here and shoot us
[24:34.040 --> 24:36.040]  And then magically it happens
[24:36.440 --> 24:42.360]  And then magically we learned the sister airport had a drill that airport lax just had a drill and here is the headline
[24:43.240 --> 24:44.840]  amazing headline
[24:44.840 --> 24:51.080]  Out of the digital journal lax shooter police trained for exact scenario three weeks ago
[24:51.080 --> 24:53.880]  And we have an article up at info wars.com
[24:54.520 --> 24:56.520]  20 drills show
[24:56.760 --> 24:58.760]  that patriots
[24:58.840 --> 25:05.480]  Are the main target of homeland security? There's the actual headline i'm going for memory 20 drills that prove the dhs official new enemy
[25:05.800 --> 25:07.800]  Is the american people info wars.com
[25:08.440 --> 25:13.480]  So i'm watching all this go on and first we hear it's a tsa agent shooting people
[25:15.400 --> 25:19.000]  And it's tsa agents that have been shot and it's plain closed people
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.640]  In suits and ties and dress shirts being drug out shot. So that doesn't fit
[25:24.520 --> 25:27.080]  And then the story keeps changing and that happens in a live event
[25:27.320 --> 25:32.120]  But then the eyewitnesses these aren't just reporters getting it wrong from the cops. These are eyewitnesses going
[25:32.360 --> 25:35.400]  I saw him. He was in a tsa uniform
[25:36.600 --> 25:38.600]  with body armor
[25:38.840 --> 25:44.280]  And i've told people this a hundred times in fact more than a hundred. I said last week multiple times
[25:45.080 --> 25:47.080]  look for a mass shooting
[25:47.080 --> 25:52.520]  At the tsa. I don't know how I know this stuff folks a lot of people think i'm actually behind stuff
[25:52.600 --> 25:56.040]  I guess because I could figure it out, but I mean I could see them branding something
[25:56.120 --> 26:00.200]  It's like how do I know a new mcdonald's sandwich is coming out the ads are everywhere
[26:00.680 --> 26:04.040]  I mean, how do I know deer season's coming up? Oh, there's the deer season ads again
[26:04.280 --> 26:07.400]  I mean, it's like both the libertarians are gonna shoot us any minute
[26:07.640 --> 26:11.000]  They're coming and i'm like it had to be tuesday. I remember on the show
[26:11.800 --> 26:15.640]  I don't have a crew to dig this stuff up listeners. Can you dig it up? I said
[26:15.640 --> 26:19.640]  If they ask you to go do a shooting drill or a bombing drill in an airport
[26:19.880 --> 26:23.640]  And you're an informant or you're a cop or you're whatever or a citizen don't do it
[26:23.720 --> 26:30.040]  They'll shoot you in the drill and shoot a bunch of people and blame you. How do I know this? They this is how they do it
[26:31.880 --> 26:35.640]  The zars used to have drills before the soviets came in and for the
[26:36.520 --> 26:38.280]  Before that the bolsheviks
[26:38.280 --> 26:43.960]  They would have drills and get patsies involved and then they do it during the drill in place their people get caught
[26:43.960 --> 26:46.600]  They say oh, it's part of the drill just like the boston bombing
[26:47.640 --> 26:52.920]  Turned out a local paper screwed up and reported. Oh, yeah, there was a drill of a bombing right there where it happened boston globe
[26:53.240 --> 26:55.240]  and a local td station
[26:55.320 --> 26:57.320]  look it up
[26:57.640 --> 27:02.280]  And the people involved in the drill they're not involved in the bombing that way if they're one guy going in
[27:02.600 --> 27:05.560]  Or the one guy from the ceiling shooting people or whatever the case was
[27:06.280 --> 27:08.840]  That you know, they shoot a few people shoot the guy that's in the drill
[27:09.400 --> 27:11.880]  Then you get to set them up. There it is police responding
[27:11.880 --> 27:15.880]  Training plan, but bombs hit first. Yeah, there's the boston globe
[27:16.600 --> 27:21.000]  They trained months before and on the day of of the bomb at the finish line
[27:23.160 --> 27:30.280]  Again, they've even declassified in different government documents like north woods how they use a drill to cover up the real attack
[27:30.280 --> 27:32.280]  It's not like I figured this out on my own
[27:32.680 --> 27:38.040]  A lot of these manuals have been declassified then they say by accident and then reclassified
[27:38.360 --> 27:40.360]  So when they come back i'm going to play you the clips
[27:40.360 --> 27:42.360]  of witnesses
[27:43.080 --> 27:47.480]  Saying he was in a tsa uniform and then and then and then they say oh
[27:48.120 --> 27:52.680]  They shot tsa agents in their outfits in their uniforms in their costumes
[27:53.320 --> 27:56.680]  Their authority costumes and then it's video the people shot weren't
[27:57.400 --> 28:03.400]  And then there's the drills and we're going to go over this at that airport and other airports of the exact same scenario
[28:03.400 --> 28:10.280]  When there'd never been a libertarian who's against the new world order southern poverty law center fed run
[28:10.760 --> 28:13.560]  Comes out and ties it to alex jones and glenn beck
[28:14.200 --> 28:16.700]  And people that don't like the tsa
[28:17.720 --> 28:19.720]  When i just released two weeks ago
[28:19.800 --> 28:24.360]  It was in the federal register, but they they reclassified it the accidentally declassified it
[28:24.840 --> 28:26.600]  Uh that they admit in federal court
[28:26.600 --> 28:32.840]  It's all fake and not for terrorist and it's for the american people and for capital controls to keep you from fleeing during a depression
[28:32.840 --> 28:39.000]  And everything implodes. These are the border and highway police to shake everybody down and basically take you to the fema camp
[28:39.640 --> 28:42.760]  If they decide you've got a designation in the nsa
[28:43.400 --> 28:45.960]  Uh file that they could use in slave labor
[28:46.440 --> 28:51.400]  And by the way, that's the emergency centers establishment act and in the civilian and mate labor camp program
[28:51.800 --> 28:58.200]  That if you're a doctor and auto mechanic, you're going to the slave camp with potbellies standing over you. We'll be right back. Stay with us

[33:30.600 --> 33:32.600]  It's alex jones
[33:32.600 --> 33:39.800]  All right coming up in the next segment your phone calls on any subject you want to cover
[33:40.280 --> 33:51.560]  877-789 alex 877-789-2539 first-time callers yet again today 877-789-2539
[33:52.120 --> 33:55.400]  And we'll get you up and on the air. What do you think about the lax shooting?
[33:55.960 --> 33:58.360]  Is it suspicious to you? Look, it's very simple
[33:58.360 --> 34:03.240]  The government and the in the interest that run it act like they're so concerned about one dead person
[34:03.240 --> 34:07.160]  Well, I'm actually concerned about I have empathy for everybody who was a tsa
[34:08.360 --> 34:13.240]  Attendant or guard whatever you want to call them. They're not really officers are not sworn
[34:14.360 --> 34:16.360]  I'm sad they were shot and killed
[34:16.360 --> 34:22.040]  And it appears that this shooting did indeed happen sometimes. They just say something happened that didn't even happen entirely
[34:22.040 --> 34:25.160]  That's how controlled the state-run media is
[34:25.160 --> 34:27.160]  But
[34:27.160 --> 34:30.360]  It is it is an elementary equation throughout history
[34:31.160 --> 34:36.440]  That governments and other groups stage events to blame it on their political opposition
[34:37.160 --> 34:41.720]  It's a false flag. It's a self-inflicted wound. It's a staged event
[34:43.160 --> 34:45.160]  It is a inside job
[34:45.160 --> 34:53.160]  And then the establishment media ridicules anyone who points out a historical fact that most big internal
[34:53.160 --> 34:55.160]  uh,
[34:55.160 --> 34:59.160]  Terroristic events in the last really 200 years
[34:59.160 --> 35:05.160]  It's turned out were staged as a way for the establishment to go after their political enemies
[35:07.160 --> 35:09.160]  Frame-ups are incredibly
[35:09.160 --> 35:11.160]  Incredibly common
[35:11.160 --> 35:19.160]  And it even came out in mainstream media and even Glenn Beck and rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage had to come out
[35:19.160 --> 35:27.160]  And say it looks like NATO and Obama staged chemical attacks in Syria with al Qaeda to blame it on their enemies
[35:27.160 --> 35:29.160]  So we've come a long way
[35:29.160 --> 35:33.160]  The fact that governments and criminal groups do this is a fact
[35:33.160 --> 35:35.160]  I'm not saying this was staged
[35:35.160 --> 35:45.160]  But the evidence the preponderance of of information leans towards that and the timing of it
[35:45.160 --> 35:53.160]  Drills that a libertarian anti-TSA person is going to come in and shoot everybody and it comes through crescendo in the media to the point of
[35:53.160 --> 36:01.160]  I said multiple times last week on record don't be part of a drill or if you see a drill or an airport get out of there
[36:03.160 --> 36:05.160]  And
[36:05.160 --> 36:07.160]  Then
[36:07.160 --> 36:13.160]  It happens. That's all I'm saying and then the media jumps on it like it's a new 9-11 into the world
[36:13.160 --> 36:15.160]  You would have thought a thousand people are dead
[36:15.160 --> 36:21.160]  I mean they can have an earthquake and 50,000 people die. It's not even in the news or there can be fires that kill 100 people
[36:21.160 --> 36:25.160]  And then it's not even the news or there can be a flood displacing millions barely in the news
[36:25.160 --> 36:33.160]  But man you get one government person shot. It's like the earth split into and blew up like the Death Star
[36:33.160 --> 36:35.160]  And that is the propaganda
[36:35.160 --> 36:37.160]  You got 53 million abortions
[36:37.160 --> 36:41.160]  You got kids getting sterilized getting paralyzed from vaccines
[36:41.160 --> 36:43.160]  You've got all these other health effects
[36:43.160 --> 36:47.160]  You got 300,000 a year on average dying from flesh-eating bacteria
[36:47.160 --> 36:49.160]  It isn't even an issue
[36:49.160 --> 36:54.160]  Just in the US you've got all 200 people dying from honeybees each year
[36:54.160 --> 36:57.160]  Hundreds dying from deer running out in front of their cars
[36:57.160 --> 36:59.160]  Are they setting up deer fences everywhere to stop that?
[36:59.160 --> 37:01.160]  No, people die
[37:01.160 --> 37:03.160]  But when it's the government being attacked
[37:03.160 --> 37:05.160]  Oh my gosh it's the end of the world
[37:05.160 --> 37:08.160]  And it's the anti-government people
[37:08.160 --> 37:13.160]  It's Alex Jones and it's Glenn Beck
[37:13.160 --> 37:21.160]  And oh my, I mean it's in AP and CNN and MSNBC and Raw Story
[37:21.160 --> 37:26.160]  And Southern Prairie Law Center is the one that put it out
[37:26.160 --> 37:28.160]  Because it turns out yesterday
[37:28.160 --> 37:33.160]  Listen, a day after all this happens the Southern Prairie Law Center has accessed the police
[37:33.160 --> 37:36.160]  And a letter stuck in this guy
[37:36.160 --> 37:38.160]  How do you pronounce this guy's name?
[37:38.160 --> 37:43.160]  Paul Ciencia
[37:43.160 --> 37:47.160]  So you've got Paul Ciencia reportedly
[37:47.160 --> 37:51.160]  And he's got a note in his bag that he did this
[37:51.160 --> 37:54.160]  Because he doesn't like authoritarian government, that's a quote
[37:54.160 --> 37:56.160]  And he doesn't like the New World Order
[37:56.160 --> 37:59.160]  And he doesn't like the TSA violating his rights
[37:59.160 --> 38:01.160]  And the TSA said two weeks ago
[38:01.160 --> 38:03.160]  They said in announcements
[38:03.160 --> 38:06.160]  If you criticize or ask us questions or make jokes
[38:06.160 --> 38:09.160]  We're gonna arrest you, that's terrorism
[38:09.160 --> 38:12.160]  See, we're now the enemy, suddenly it's us
[38:12.160 --> 38:15.160]  And people are like, well just go through the security, put up with it
[38:15.160 --> 38:17.160]  This is a bathing and tyranny
[38:17.160 --> 38:19.160]  This is a breaking of our will
[38:19.160 --> 38:22.160]  This is a learn to be perps, learn to be prisoners
[38:22.160 --> 38:27.160]  This is what prisoners go through and they show up at medium and maximum security presence
[38:27.160 --> 38:29.160]  Is what the TSA does to you
[38:29.160 --> 38:34.160]  Is the enslavement, the antithesis of what our republic was founded on
[38:34.160 --> 38:37.160]  And if you don't do it, you're not a good American
[38:37.160 --> 38:42.160]  So Paul Ciencia, who's unconscious, we're told
[38:42.160 --> 38:45.160]  And if he pleads not guilty later and says there were other shooters
[38:45.160 --> 38:49.160]  Like the lone living Boston bombing patsy
[38:49.160 --> 38:51.160]  You'll never hear about that
[38:51.160 --> 38:54.160]  It'll be national security, the trial's secret
[38:54.160 --> 38:57.160]  Only know why it's secret
[38:57.160 --> 39:01.160]  Tamerlan, the older brother of Zarnaev
[39:01.160 --> 39:03.160]  On record was working with the CIA
[39:03.160 --> 39:06.160]  That came out in British, German and Russian news
[39:06.160 --> 39:08.160]  There was a drill, there was a stand down
[39:08.160 --> 39:11.160]  They set those brothers up and they screamed at cops
[39:11.160 --> 39:13.160]  We didn't do it, we're not part of it
[39:13.160 --> 39:17.160]  As they shot his brother and ran over him and then chased the other one
[39:17.160 --> 39:20.160]  Then shot up his boat with 50 cops and he climbs out
[39:20.160 --> 39:24.160]  And then they had to cut his throat out so he couldn't talk
[39:24.160 --> 39:27.160]  By the way, I've talked to the police involved
[39:27.160 --> 39:29.160]  Just so you know, ladies and gentlemen
[39:29.160 --> 39:34.160]  Just like we broke, there was an order by Obama for a stand down
[39:34.160 --> 39:40.160]  A stand down at the navel yard shooting by the SWAT team
[39:40.160 --> 39:43.160]  From the Capitol that happened to be driving by right when it happened a mile away
[39:43.160 --> 39:46.160]  And we're fully locked and loaded to go in and stop whatever happened
[39:46.160 --> 39:48.160]  National security got declared on that one
[39:48.160 --> 39:50.160]  On and on and on
[39:50.160 --> 39:52.160]  This is how they set up the police state
[39:52.160 --> 39:54.160]  This is how they take over
[39:54.160 --> 39:55.160]  You want to take over the Middle East?
[39:55.160 --> 39:57.160]  Fund Al Qaeda, have them blow stuff up
[39:57.160 --> 39:58.160]  You want to take over America?
[39:58.160 --> 40:00.160]  Well, fund Al Qaeda to blow stuff up
[40:00.160 --> 40:03.160]  But then come in and flip it on to the American people
[40:03.160 --> 40:05.160]  So let's go over some of the evidence here
[40:05.160 --> 40:07.160]  But I just want to remind you
[40:07.160 --> 40:13.160]  They are now coming out in literally hundreds of publications as we speak
[40:13.160 --> 40:16.160]  It was like 10 yesterday
[40:16.160 --> 40:18.160]  More than I could count this morning and it's just flooding
[40:18.160 --> 40:20.160]  Now it's all over the news
[40:20.160 --> 40:22.160]  Videos are coming into our inbox
[40:22.160 --> 40:27.160]  As they say, Alex Jones is the one that coined the term New World Order
[40:27.160 --> 40:30.160]  They actually say that in one article
[40:30.160 --> 40:33.160]  Hitler used the term New World Order first
[40:33.160 --> 40:36.160]  On record, before I was born, I was born in 74
[40:36.160 --> 40:40.160]  Hitler used the term in 1936, you can look it up
[40:40.160 --> 40:43.160]  At the Olympics that he basically founded, the modern Olympics
[40:43.160 --> 40:45.160]  See, I'm cursed by being informed
[40:45.160 --> 40:49.160]  It's like I'm here talking about, I guess, rocket science to the public
[40:49.160 --> 40:51.160]  And they just think, that guy talks fancy
[40:51.160 --> 40:54.160]  He's trying to show off, he's a terrorist
[40:54.160 --> 40:57.160]  I hope somebody in a black uniform takes my goons
[40:57.160 --> 41:00.160]  To keep me safe from people like him
[41:00.160 --> 41:04.160]  He scared me, government loved me
[41:04.160 --> 41:07.160]  Like you're some domesticated potbellied pig or something
[41:07.160 --> 41:10.160]  I saw at the Austin Zoo yesterday with my children
[41:10.160 --> 41:12.160]  I mean, does anyone really buy into all this fraud?
[41:12.160 --> 41:16.160]  All I know is we've got groups that stand again from staging stuff
[41:16.160 --> 41:18.160]  Or letting it happen, who have a history of doing it
[41:18.160 --> 41:20.160]  And who have the motive to seize power
[41:20.160 --> 41:22.160]  And blame us for political events
[41:22.160 --> 41:24.160]  Before we go to break, let's play one of these clips
[41:24.160 --> 41:28.160]  Here's KTLA with one of the countless videos we have
[41:28.160 --> 41:33.160]  Of folks saying they saw the shooter with the gun in a TSA uniform
[41:33.160 --> 41:36.160]  Correct, there's two weapons playing the part
[41:36.160 --> 41:39.160]  And this gunman looked like a TSA agent to me
[41:39.160 --> 41:41.160]  Because he was dressed like that
[41:41.160 --> 41:43.160]  Like a security TSA agent
[41:43.160 --> 41:46.160]  And he was pretty big, I mean, bigger than me
[41:46.160 --> 41:50.160]  Like body-wise, so I bet if he was going to go crazy today
[41:50.160 --> 41:51.160]  Alright, that's enough
[41:51.160 --> 41:53.160]  We've got a whole bunch of videos like this
[41:53.160 --> 41:58.160]  Let's go to the one where they did a drill of the exact same thing
[41:58.160 --> 42:00.160]  And I think this is CBS
[42:00.160 --> 42:03.160]  Cue up the one of the drill the exact same thing
[42:07.160 --> 42:08.160]  Here we go
[42:08.160 --> 42:13.160]  The officers didn't, I repeat, they didn't hesitate
[42:13.160 --> 42:16.160]  They went after this individual and they confronted this individual
[42:16.160 --> 42:19.160]  In our airport
[42:19.160 --> 42:22.160]  And unfortunately it involved an officer involved shooting
[42:22.160 --> 42:25.160]  But that's what needed to be done in that particular situation
[42:25.160 --> 42:27.160]  And that was heroic
[42:27.160 --> 42:30.160]  We practiced to this, not more than three weeks ago
[42:30.160 --> 42:34.160]  We took every one of our officers, our patrol officers
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.160]  And a couple hundred officers from the Los Angeles Police Department
[42:38.160 --> 42:40.160]  And we practiced the exact same thing
[42:40.160 --> 42:43.160]  But I remember being on air at the time, as God is my witness
[42:43.160 --> 42:44.160]  You can pull it up
[42:44.160 --> 42:46.160]  And I said, watch them stage something in LAX
[42:46.160 --> 42:48.160]  I remember on air
[42:48.160 --> 42:51.160]  Because the way the media was smacking their lips
[42:51.160 --> 42:53.160]  And had that look in their eye like the word had been given
[42:53.160 --> 42:55.160]  These people, unbelievable
[42:55.160 --> 42:56.160]  Unbelievable
[42:56.160 --> 43:21.160]  Man, I tell you, I can't handle anymore
[43:26.160 --> 43:28.160]  I'm going to go to the airport

[44:09.160 --> 44:14.160]  The US isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat

[44:32.160 --> 44:35.160]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states
[44:35.160 --> 44:38.160]  Most people won't even be ready and won't be able to get out of town

[45:58.160 --> 46:00.160]  I had tried everything
[46:00.160 --> 46:02.160]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating
[46:02.160 --> 46:05.160]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working
[46:05.160 --> 46:09.160]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements
[46:09.160 --> 46:10.160]  As well as key vitamins
[46:10.160 --> 46:12.160]  And as soon as I had that

[46:56.160 --> 46:58.160]  Infowarsteam.com
[47:01.160 --> 47:04.160]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[47:04.160 --> 47:08.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[47:11.160 --> 47:14.160]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth
[47:14.160 --> 47:17.160]  A lie, no man is obsolete
[47:17.160 --> 47:19.160]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth
[47:19.160 --> 47:22.160]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time
[47:22.160 --> 47:24.160]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you
[47:24.160 --> 47:27.160]  That you cannot destroy truth by burning pages
[47:27.160 --> 47:29.160]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth
[47:29.160 --> 47:33.160]  A crawling insect, an ugly, misforn little creature
[47:33.160 --> 47:35.160]  Who has no purpose here, no meaning
[47:35.160 --> 47:37.160]  I am a human being
[47:37.160 --> 47:40.160]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth
[47:40.160 --> 47:43.160]  That have no substance and no dimension
[47:43.160 --> 47:45.160]  I don't care, like the winds
[47:45.160 --> 47:47.160]  I don't care, I tell you, I don't care
[47:47.160 --> 47:50.160]  I'm a human being, I exist
[47:50.160 --> 47:54.160]  And if I speak one for a loud, that thought lives
[47:54.160 --> 47:56.160]  Even after I'm shoveled into my grave
[47:56.160 --> 47:59.160]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth
[47:59.160 --> 48:03.160]  Delusions that you inject into your veins
[48:03.160 --> 48:05.160]  To make you think you have a strength
[48:05.160 --> 48:07.160]  When you have no strength at all
[48:07.160 --> 48:10.160]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream
[48:10.160 --> 48:14.160]  That mistake has no use for your crime
[48:14.160 --> 48:18.160]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God
[48:18.160 --> 48:21.160]  It's Alex Jones
[48:24.160 --> 48:28.160]  236 years ago, the British newspapers
[48:28.160 --> 48:30.160]  Nothing against the great British people
[48:30.160 --> 48:36.160]  I myself have got a lot of blood from the aisles over there
[48:36.160 --> 48:39.160]  They declared that the colonists were terrorists
[48:39.160 --> 48:43.160]  They were thieves, thugs, highwaymen
[48:43.160 --> 48:45.160]  That they would be dealt with
[48:45.160 --> 48:49.160]  And of course, they ended up founding this republic
[48:49.160 --> 48:51.160]  On the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[48:51.160 --> 48:53.160]  And the ideas of English common law
[48:53.160 --> 48:56.160]  That had been developed by their predecessors
[48:56.160 --> 48:59.160]  They honored the good Englishmen and women
[48:59.160 --> 49:02.160]  Who had stood for Magna Carta in 1215
[49:02.160 --> 49:07.160]  So we salute the real Britannic roots today
[49:07.160 --> 49:09.160]  Not the fact that the global issues in England
[49:09.160 --> 49:12.160]  Is one of their main command bases
[49:12.160 --> 49:15.160]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen
[49:15.160 --> 49:16.160]  We're going to go to your phone calls
[49:16.160 --> 49:19.160]  Coming up here in just a few minutes
[49:19.160 --> 49:22.160]  I want to make it clear
[49:22.160 --> 49:25.160]  Governments throughout history and also private groups
[49:25.160 --> 49:27.160]  Stage events to blind their political enemies
[49:27.160 --> 49:28.160]  That's a fact
[49:28.160 --> 49:30.160]  False flags are a part of history
[49:30.160 --> 49:33.160]  They're very common
[49:33.160 --> 49:38.160]  But when you see the establishment state-run media
[49:38.160 --> 49:42.160]  Come out less than 24 hours after the tragic event
[49:42.160 --> 49:44.160]  That's been blown way out of proportion
[49:44.160 --> 49:46.160]  Compared to disasters a thousand times bigger
[49:46.160 --> 49:48.160]  When you see all the scripting
[49:48.160 --> 49:50.160]  And you see all the telltale signs
[49:50.160 --> 49:52.160]  And when you see political enemies
[49:52.160 --> 49:55.160]  Republicans, conservatives, constitutionalists
[49:55.160 --> 49:57.160]  Veterans, libertarians
[49:57.160 --> 50:01.160]  But number one, Alex Jones and Glenn Beck
[50:01.160 --> 50:04.160]  And look, folks, I'm not in competition with Glenn Beck
[50:04.160 --> 50:05.160]  Even though his show is very similar to mine
[50:05.160 --> 50:07.160]  I agree with 95% of what's on his show
[50:07.160 --> 50:09.160]  I don't want them to go after Glenn Beck
[50:09.160 --> 50:11.160]  If they try to blame him for things
[50:11.160 --> 50:13.160]  He has nothing to do with
[50:13.160 --> 50:14.160]  I'm going to defend him
[50:14.160 --> 50:17.160]  I am absolutely nonviolent offensively
[50:17.160 --> 50:19.160]  Do not start anything
[50:19.160 --> 50:20.160]  Do not go shoot anybody
[50:20.160 --> 50:22.160]  Don't shoot cops at a checkpoint
[50:22.160 --> 50:24.160]  Don't shoot FBI agents
[50:24.160 --> 50:26.160]  Don't shoot ATF agents
[50:26.160 --> 50:28.160]  Do not go out looking for trouble
[50:28.160 --> 50:31.160]  If somebody comes up shooting at you
[50:31.160 --> 50:33.160]  Like Sheriff John Brown
[50:33.160 --> 50:35.160]  In the famous song
[50:35.160 --> 50:38.160]  Talking about I shot the sheriff
[50:38.160 --> 50:40.160]  But I didn't shoot the deputy
[50:40.160 --> 50:42.160]  Here came John Brown coming down the road to shoot me
[50:42.160 --> 50:43.160]  So I shot first
[50:43.160 --> 50:45.160]  That's a different issue
[50:45.160 --> 50:48.160]  But we're not trying to cause a civil war here
[50:48.160 --> 50:49.160]  The globalists are
[50:49.160 --> 50:51.160]  We don't want a fight with the police and the military
[50:51.160 --> 50:53.160]  We have more in common with them
[50:53.160 --> 50:56.160]  Times 100 than we do the offshore globalists
[50:56.160 --> 50:58.160]  That are manipulating this
[50:58.160 --> 51:01.160]  And the police and military are smart enough
[51:01.160 --> 51:03.160]  Being on the inside
[51:03.160 --> 51:04.160]  To understand that
[51:04.160 --> 51:07.160]  And realize there's a manipulation happening here
[51:07.160 --> 51:09.160]  So they chose Los Angeles
[51:09.160 --> 51:10.160]  For something like that
[51:10.160 --> 51:12.160]  And that's my gut
[51:12.160 --> 51:13.160]  That's my inclination
[51:13.160 --> 51:14.160]  I now remember
[51:14.160 --> 51:16.160]  Three weeks ago with the drill at LAX
[51:16.160 --> 51:17.160]  The mass shooting
[51:17.160 --> 51:18.160]  Saying oh my gosh
[51:18.160 --> 51:19.160]  When they do stuff like this
[51:19.160 --> 51:20.160]  Look out it's LA
[51:20.160 --> 51:21.160]  If they're going to stage something
[51:21.160 --> 51:22.160]  It'd be a place like LA
[51:22.160 --> 51:24.160]  I remember saying it
[51:24.160 --> 51:25.160]  You remember
[51:25.160 --> 51:26.160]  Go to all the YouTube videos
[51:26.160 --> 51:28.160]  The prisonplanet.tvs
[51:28.160 --> 51:31.160]  Find it, post it
[51:31.160 --> 51:33.160]  And then I said this week
[51:33.160 --> 51:34.160]  Multiple times
[51:34.160 --> 51:36.160]  Look for a staged attack
[51:36.160 --> 51:38.160]  At a checkpoint
[51:38.160 --> 51:39.160]  Or a police station
[51:39.160 --> 51:40.160]  Or a TSA line
[51:40.160 --> 51:43.160]  Because I just see all the pre-programming
[51:43.160 --> 51:44.160]  It's like how do you know
[51:44.160 --> 51:46.160]  You always forget falls coming around
[51:46.160 --> 51:47.160]  Do you see Christmas stuff
[51:47.160 --> 51:48.160]  You go to the mall
[51:48.160 --> 51:49.160]  There's Christmas music
[51:49.160 --> 51:53.160]  It's the same thing with the PR rollout
[51:53.160 --> 51:54.160]  It's just everywhere
[51:54.160 --> 51:56.160]  The libertarians are going to come to the airport
[51:56.160 --> 51:57.160]  And shoot everybody
[51:57.160 --> 51:58.160]  Never happened before
[51:58.160 --> 51:59.160]  And I'm like
[51:59.160 --> 52:01.160]  Wow, they're in all these movies
[52:01.160 --> 52:02.160]  And dramas and sitcoms
[52:02.160 --> 52:04.160]  It's the anti-New World Order people
[52:04.160 --> 52:06.160]  They're going to kill everybody
[52:06.160 --> 52:08.160]  Get ready for it to be staged
[52:08.160 --> 52:11.160]  Or this could be a mentally ill person
[52:11.160 --> 52:13.160]  That sees the countless cop shows
[52:13.160 --> 52:14.160]  And TV shows
[52:14.160 --> 52:15.160]  Hawaii 5.0
[52:15.160 --> 52:16.160]  Every show I see
[52:16.160 --> 52:18.160]  Every show my crew tells me about
[52:18.160 --> 52:19.160]  We play clips
[52:19.160 --> 52:22.160]  Is the libertarian liberty lover
[52:22.160 --> 52:24.160]  Shoots up the TSA
[52:24.160 --> 52:26.160]  Murders the children
[52:26.160 --> 52:27.160]  On and on and on
[52:27.160 --> 52:28.160]  The demonization
[52:28.160 --> 52:30.160]  When it's not happening in the real world
[52:30.160 --> 52:32.160]  So they don't even have to stage it sometimes
[52:32.160 --> 52:34.160]  Copycats will see that
[52:34.160 --> 52:37.160]  And it puts the idea in their mind
[52:37.160 --> 52:39.160]  You know, New York, Chicago, LA police
[52:39.160 --> 52:40.160]  Famously every time somebody
[52:40.160 --> 52:41.160]  Gets the most skyscraper
[52:41.160 --> 52:42.160]  And jumps off
[52:42.160 --> 52:43.160]  They know for two days
[52:43.160 --> 52:44.160]  To post police there
[52:44.160 --> 52:46.160]  Or to put up fences
[52:46.160 --> 52:48.160]  Because somebody sees one person
[52:48.160 --> 52:49.160]  Jump off the impersonates building
[52:49.160 --> 52:51.160]  Suddenly it's on the news
[52:51.160 --> 52:52.160]  This is a suicidal go
[52:52.160 --> 52:54.160]  I was going to blow my head off today
[52:54.160 --> 52:56.160]  Let me go to the impersonates building to do that
[52:56.160 --> 52:57.160]  Now it's all plexiglass
[52:57.160 --> 52:58.160]  And you can't
[52:58.160 --> 53:00.160]  This is mob psychology
[53:00.160 --> 53:02.160]  And they show you images of running people
[53:02.160 --> 53:04.160]  At LAX and all the fear
[53:04.160 --> 53:05.160]  And oh my gosh
[53:05.160 --> 53:06.160]  I better do what they say
[53:06.160 --> 53:07.160]  It's the libertarians
[53:07.160 --> 53:10.160]  They're coming to kill me
[53:10.160 --> 53:12.160]  It's a scyop
[53:12.160 --> 53:14.160]  Even if this guy was unstable
[53:14.160 --> 53:15.160]  And went and did this
[53:15.160 --> 53:16.160]  Regardless, people have died
[53:16.160 --> 53:17.160]  It's terrible
[53:17.160 --> 53:19.160]  But why is it being pushed so much
[53:19.160 --> 53:21.160]  See what I'm saying?
[53:21.160 --> 53:24.160]  Meanwhile, one week after
[53:24.160 --> 53:25.160]  They passed Obamacare
[53:25.160 --> 53:26.160]  Three and a half years ago
[53:26.160 --> 53:27.160]  Newsweek had the cover
[53:27.160 --> 53:28.160]  The case for killing Granny
[53:28.160 --> 53:30.160]  Showing an old woman being unplugged
[53:30.160 --> 53:32.160]  Bill Gates came out and said
[53:32.160 --> 53:33.160]  The death panels are real
[53:33.160 --> 53:35.160]  Kilogram all our 10 teachers
[53:35.160 --> 53:38.160]  The death panels were in there
[53:38.160 --> 53:40.160]  The bioethics boards
[53:40.160 --> 53:42.160]  We knew what this was going to do
[53:42.160 --> 53:43.160]  Rahm Emanuel's brother
[53:43.160 --> 53:44.160]  Had written white papers
[53:44.160 --> 53:45.160]  As he killed Emanuel
[53:45.160 --> 53:47.160]  His brother was the chief of staff at the time
[53:47.160 --> 53:50.160]  Now Chicago mayor, Chicago Don
[53:50.160 --> 53:56.160]  And he came out and admitted all this
[53:56.160 --> 53:57.160]  And they would control us
[53:57.160 --> 53:58.160]  Through the healthcare
[53:58.160 --> 53:59.160]  Well, now he's come out and admitted
[53:59.160 --> 54:01.160]  Okay, you are going to have
[54:01.160 --> 54:03.160]  No more private market
[54:03.160 --> 54:04.160]  Where you go out and buy what you want
[54:04.160 --> 54:05.160]  No more market
[54:05.160 --> 54:07.160]  That's because the insurance companies want it
[54:07.160 --> 54:08.160]  And what he's saying is true
[54:08.160 --> 54:09.160]  But their plan was to destroy it
[54:09.160 --> 54:11.160]  The insurance companies will still get
[54:11.160 --> 54:13.160]  All the money as foreign banks
[54:13.160 --> 54:14.160]  That's what they are
[54:14.160 --> 54:16.160]  But you won't have a choice
[54:16.160 --> 54:18.160]  That's why it doubled this year
[54:18.160 --> 54:20.160]  That's why it's set to triple next year
[54:20.160 --> 54:22.160]  And quadruple by 20
[54:22.160 --> 54:23.160]  Middle of 2014
[54:23.160 --> 54:24.160]  The numbers vary
[54:24.160 --> 54:26.160]  In fact, it's worse than I even
[54:26.160 --> 54:29.160]  Prognosticated trying to read the writers
[54:29.160 --> 54:31.160]  It's a bunch of special interest in there
[54:31.160 --> 54:32.160]  Get whenever they want
[54:32.160 --> 54:33.160]  Big insurance companies
[54:33.160 --> 54:34.160]  Shut down little ones
[54:34.160 --> 54:35.160]  Shut down competition
[54:35.160 --> 54:37.160]  Shut down what type of test
[54:37.160 --> 54:38.160]  And healthcare people can get
[54:38.160 --> 54:39.160]  But you still got to buy
[54:39.160 --> 54:40.160]  Expensive healthcare
[54:40.160 --> 54:41.160]  Let's double the price
[54:41.160 --> 54:42.160]  On and on and on
[54:42.160 --> 54:45.160]  I mean, it is a rec Medicare Medicaid
[54:45.160 --> 54:49.160]  Let the government give you less care
[54:49.160 --> 54:52.160]  This is the greatest screw job in history
[54:52.160 --> 54:54.160]  And everything we said about it
[54:54.160 --> 54:56.160]  Was accurate with our guests and experts
[54:56.160 --> 54:58.160]  To a point, but I was wrong
[54:58.160 --> 55:02.160]  Obamacare, I was right up to a point
[55:02.160 --> 55:04.160]  Of how bad I thought it would get
[55:04.160 --> 55:05.160]  From the legislation
[55:05.160 --> 55:06.160]  Trying to read it, understand it
[55:06.160 --> 55:08.160]  But I couldn't believe that they're this arrogant
[55:08.160 --> 55:09.160]  And think you're this dumb
[55:09.160 --> 55:13.160]  It was light years beyond
[55:13.160 --> 55:15.160]  Beyond what I thought
[55:15.160 --> 55:17.160]  So I was wrong here
[55:17.160 --> 55:19.160]  This was much worse than I even thought
[55:19.160 --> 55:22.160]  Obama was much worse than I thought
[55:22.160 --> 55:23.160]  And I knew he'd be bad
[55:23.160 --> 55:24.160]  But I mean, this is unbelievable
[55:24.160 --> 55:26.160]  So let's go to a video clip of him
[55:26.160 --> 55:28.160]  On Fox News Sunday
[55:28.160 --> 55:31.160]  This is today
[55:31.160 --> 55:33.160]  Admitting, but spinning it like
[55:33.160 --> 55:36.160]  Oh, the insurance companies are the ones
[55:36.160 --> 55:37.160]  They did it, not us
[55:37.160 --> 55:38.160]  Which is true though
[55:38.160 --> 55:40.160]  But still gets Obama out of the trouble
[55:40.160 --> 55:42.160]  Not all the insurance companies
[55:42.160 --> 55:44.160]  I have family that works in
[55:44.160 --> 55:46.160]  Major healthcare management
[55:46.160 --> 55:48.160]  Okay, they're all getting out of it
[55:48.160 --> 55:49.160]  Not because they don't want to
[55:49.160 --> 55:51.160]  Not make money or because they're bad
[55:51.160 --> 55:52.160]  It's because it's written where
[55:52.160 --> 55:54.160]  Little operators can operate
[55:54.160 --> 55:57.160]  It's written to shut down competition, folks
[55:57.160 --> 56:00.160]  Just like Obama shut down our coal-powered plants
[56:00.160 --> 56:02.160]  And you're seeing the evidence of that now
[56:02.160 --> 56:05.160]  So let's go to this clip of the architect
[56:05.160 --> 56:07.160]  One of the main architects of Obamacare
[56:07.160 --> 56:09.160]  Now admitting what we told you was going to happen
[56:09.160 --> 56:11.160]  You're not going to have a health market
[56:11.160 --> 56:13.160]  You're just going to have to buy whatever
[56:13.160 --> 56:15.160]  The insurance companies say
[56:15.160 --> 56:17.160]  Because they bought off the government
[56:17.160 --> 56:18.160]  Here it is
[56:18.160 --> 56:21.160]  People who knew the law as it was being written
[56:21.160 --> 56:23.160]  Knew the president wasn't telling the truth
[56:23.160 --> 56:25.160]  The grandfather provision written into the law itself
[56:25.160 --> 56:26.160]  Was too narrow
[56:26.160 --> 56:28.160]  And frankly, they wrote a regulation
[56:28.160 --> 56:31.160]  Intentionally trying to get people out of the individual market
[56:31.160 --> 56:33.160]  They want the people to go into the exchanges
[56:33.160 --> 56:35.160]  Because there's a lot of people in the individual market
[56:35.160 --> 56:37.160]  The whole point of the exchanges is to close down
[56:37.160 --> 56:39.160]  The individual insurance market over time
[56:39.160 --> 56:42.160]  Insurance company wanted to move millions of people into the exchanges
[56:42.160 --> 56:46.160]  Insurance companies don't like the individual market
[56:46.160 --> 56:47.160]  As it's constructed
[56:47.160 --> 56:48.160]  They see the future
[56:48.160 --> 56:50.160]  That individual market is going away
[56:50.160 --> 56:51.160]  They don't want to invest in it
[56:51.160 --> 56:52.160]  That's why
[56:52.160 --> 56:53.160]  Let me finish
[56:53.160 --> 56:54.160]  Let me switch
[56:55.160 --> 56:56.160]  Ladies and gentlemen
[56:56.160 --> 56:59.160]  That was Rahm Emanuel's brother who helped write the bill
[56:59.160 --> 57:02.160]  The Eugenesis Dodger that says we're dispopulation death panels
[57:02.160 --> 57:03.160]  We have clips of him
[57:03.160 --> 57:04.160]  We played it three years ago
[57:04.160 --> 57:05.160]  We're going to stop this
[57:05.160 --> 57:06.160]  You didn't listen to us
[57:06.160 --> 57:08.160]  Or at least the rest of the public
[57:08.160 --> 57:09.160]  Didn't
[57:09.160 --> 57:10.160]  And did you hear it?
[57:10.160 --> 57:13.160]  The insurance companies see the future
[57:13.160 --> 57:15.160]  It's going away
[57:15.160 --> 57:17.160]  It was meant to wreck it
[57:17.160 --> 57:19.160]  And give us what England has, everything else
[57:19.160 --> 57:20.160]  Or it's not free
[57:20.160 --> 57:22.160]  You pay 30% of your paycheck for it
[57:22.160 --> 57:24.160]  And then when my crew members that live in England
[57:24.160 --> 57:25.160]  Go to get health care
[57:25.160 --> 57:27.160]  They can't get it with their national health care card
[57:27.160 --> 57:29.160]  You can have rot throat
[57:29.160 --> 57:30.160]  Strip throat
[57:30.160 --> 57:31.160]  You don't get health care
[57:31.160 --> 57:32.160]  Just go home and die
[57:32.160 --> 57:34.160]  Okay, this is it
[57:34.160 --> 57:36.160]  See how funny it is to them
[57:36.160 --> 57:38.160]  They see the future
[57:38.160 --> 57:39.160]  Wrecking the free market
[57:39.160 --> 57:40.160]  But get this
[57:40.160 --> 57:42.160]  You will still pay to foreign banks

[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:58.820]  you're on the air worldwide sir hello alex i i got some information on the lax shooting my sister
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:04.820]  along brother we're at the airport 30 minutes after the incident and supposedly she saw someone
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:10.420]  on the ground bleeding and if you're a human bleeding from a gunshot 30 minutes after the
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:15.780]  event you're an actor with fake blood i was a fireman i know that the first thing you do
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:21.140]  is you get the wounded to the hospital well that's right you go into shock you go into shock
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:26.100]  and you dive it's a serious wound and within minutes you've got somebody turn a kit and you've
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:31.940]  got a stretcher that is and you know that's in the news that like 45 minutes later people still
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:37.620]  saw folks bleeding if you only got six wounded with all these police and stuff they'd be on gurney's
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:43.940]  what in 15 20 minutes at an airport at the most they'd be five 10 minutes i was a fireman that's
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:48.180]  the first thing you do is you stabilize the victims and you get them to the hospital you
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:53.700]  don't leave them there for 30 minutes unless godzilla himself is standing outside the building
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:59.220]  and even then you'd still try to get them to the hospital well sir the government is doing a good
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:04.020]  job and if you question them that's that's hate mongering and racist and it doesn't matter if
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:08.340]  they're all announcing world government calling in a new world order the media says that i made up
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:14.500]  this term and then i made the the shooter the alleged shooter do this and i'm just getting used
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:18.500]  to learning that i'm it's my fault everything happens i'm kind of like godzilla actually
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:23.860]  i'm just causing all these horrible things to happen of course it's not really true i have a
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:28.820]  good idea who's making it happen as we go out to break sir scott what do you think's going on here
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:35.300]  i think at least it had to be at least partially staged there you go going to use this to try to
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:41.460]  increase the arms of the tsa and try to get them guns so that somebody that was working flipping
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.780]  burgers at mcdonald's yesterday can be standing there with a gun with the hands in your pants
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:50.100]  that's exactly who they want they want to take their welfare army cut them off welfare
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:55.700]  make them brigade level every town goon force that's what they do that's the kami plan well said
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:05:01.060]  you're on target well they ride back with the humet why does the united states spend the largest
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:06.180]  percentage of gdp in the world on health care why do we have the highest cancer rates on the

[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:43.540]  or just keep denying it denying it denying it when it becomes more and more obvious in our face
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:50.740]  go into your phone calls but this piece up on info wars dot com prison planet dot com it's going viral
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:58.420]  right now be a drugs report dot com gateway pundit this morning architect of obama care
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:06.660]  ezequiel immanuel dr. ezequiel immanuel is debating one of the people on fox sunday fox
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:11.940]  new sunday and he says hey the insurance company see the future they know there's no more individual
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:15.700]  healthcare you don't have a choice this is the future and yeah we could read the bill
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:20.980]  government involvement is what took the best healthcare system in the last 30 years and wrecked
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:25.060]  it made it the most expensive and now you're going to come in and it's already doubled in a year
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:29.060]  and it's going to triple quadruple and and they're going to wreck the healthcare mandate and bring
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:34.020]  in eugenics and social engineering and it's admitted in obama care what you eat off your credit
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:39.140]  cards is tracked to decide what you pay i mean we're collectivized with all these other people
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:44.900]  now telling us what to do in our lives this is the opposite of freedom this is what wrecks countries
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:51.140]  but it's what gives these control freaks control of our lives and it's what they lost after it is
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:57.140]  a nightmare in england a nightmare in canada and and they lied to us obama we ought to queue that
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:01.380]  up after this clip and play it before we go back to calls where he said i'm not going to get rid
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:06.500]  of your healthcare nobody's taking it that's a conspiracy theory it's three million people
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:11.620]  now conservatively it was two million a week ago they've been kicked off their health plans
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:18.900]  in texas they're up 539 percent that's mainstream news california 200 and something percent this
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:25.300]  is a giant raping a private tax to private insurance companies of course it's going to go up if you've
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:30.820]  got to buy their product and they can cut the type of care you get but obama wants to give me something
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:37.220]  free they're eating any free lunches dombo's i'm talking to new listeners man you people are gullible

[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:47.220]  administration and millions could not keep their health insurance and they admit now he lied but
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:52.500]  see he can be politically destroyed now he's the puppet he knows the game what about the people
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:57.540]  that put him in and did all this and the republican leadership trying to stop the tea party right now
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:01.860]  from defeating this you got the republican leadership the democratic leadership attacking
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:08.020]  the tea party because it's real americans and all you gullible yuppies go it's popular not like the

[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:32.100]  what we told you for six years and for three and a half years when it passed emergency red level
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:37.140]  this is a total foreign banking tax just like they do to other countries here it is
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:42.180]  people who knew the law as it was being written knew the president wasn't telling the truth the
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:47.380]  grandfather provision written into the law itself was too narrow and frankly they wrote a regulation
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:50.980]  intentionally trying to get people out of the individual market but if you read the regular
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:55.140]  to go into the exchanges because there's a lot of people in the individual market the whole point
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:59.300]  of the exchange is that the closed down the individual insurance market over james kapper ready
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:04.660]  wanted to move millions of people into the insurance companies don't want insurance companies don't
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:09.540]  like the individual market as it's constructed they see the future that individual market is going
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:13.780]  away they don't want to invest in it but that's why president let me finish the president let me

[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:26.660]  they say why would he do that to me i voted for him he loves me no he's run mainly by offshore banks
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:32.260]  that own our military industrial complex that own the big insurance companies who write the
[01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:39.860]  legislation to absolutely impoverish you transfer the wealth to themselves as a way to control and
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:46.980]  run your life and you're going to have to admit to yourself this is social engineering if you have
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:54.020]  any hope of ever getting out of it just because you're a nice person doesn't mean the robber barons
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:21:01.540]  that live in castles are they're not but see you only think a middle class person is bad

[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:14.820]  that's social engineering that's social warfare class warfare but if it's a big ultra rich guy

[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:26.340]  and that's why you're a failure is because you are gullible like a little fishy coming
[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:33.380]  inviting on the lucky and free people are not that gullible so i'm begging you to admit you've
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:39.860]  been conned and to admit you've been bamboozled and to admit you've been manipulated because
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:46.260]  knowing is as the army used to say half the battle let's go to your phone calls fast frank
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:51.700]  in north carolina thanks for holding you're on the air worldwide yeah i just have a quick
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:56.260]  possible news tip it may be nothing but we're sitting in traffic the other day i don't normally
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:22:03.380]  listen to him turn him on i don't know the context exactly but rush limbaugh was talking uh he was
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:08.340]  giving tips sounds like to his audience to turn off their cell phones when they get onto an airplane
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:13.060]  because everybody knows cell phones don't work and what he was trying to warn people to change
[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:18.980]  your battery down because the whole time once you you know take off uh your your phone is
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:24.820]  going to constantly be searching it's constantly trying to make access with the cell towers but
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:30.420]  cell phones don't work about about 4 000 feet except on 9 11 then they all work perfectly
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:35.140]  even though the fbi had to admit uh almost all those phone calls except for air phones were not
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:40.260]  made including the solicitor general's wife it was all fake but let's just ignore that well i
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:45.300]  just think it's interesting i that he was talking about that i had mentioned once before back in
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:52.420]  the around the ninth of uh january back in 2009 and he was not joking uh it may have been a stunt
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:57.540]  of some type uh some type of a contractual stunt uh maybe he was trying to get more money or maybe
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:01.540]  he was trying to scare some people like hey if you want i'll start telling you know what's really
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:07.060]  going on but uh he was telling how the world worked he was talking about the cfr he's like the
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:12.900]  president's the congress or ceremonial i mean he sounded like alex jones uh he went to a commercial
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:17.460]  break came back it was like it never happened none of the callers mentioned it i don't know if it was
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:21.780]  like a test to see if the sheep would would see but it was definitely not a joke he was not well i
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:27.460]  know for a fact rest limbaugh obviously uh is aware of what's going on so i'll just leave it at that
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:33.700]  and whatever there's just no future if we don't turn this around the problem is the public is
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:38.260]  so dumbed down and cowardly a lot of folks won't stick their neck out because why should they
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:45.460]  the public the general public wants to be wants to be abused they want to be chumped
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:51.220]  it's very sad i appreciate your call i appreciate chris calling in as well from indiana go ahead chris
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:59.540]  hey yeah alex uh most of the public is like parson from 1984 who's collecting all the money and
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:05.540]  who believe that the chocolate ration going down was a good thing and standing up and clapping for
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:10.660]  it well that's right because as long as they cheer the system it doesn't matter if their kids are
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:18.420]  dying in front of them if they imagine it's okay they're like optimist on pcp and being an optimist
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:24.660]  when bad stuff's happening is not good it's good when things are bad to admit they're bad to make
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:29.700]  your condition better and to not live in denial but it's all part of this magical thinking oh
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:34.100]  alex don't be so negative about our seven trillion dollar deficit don't be so negative about the
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:39.540]  communist chinese taking over the panama canal and building a 40 billion dollar new one alex don't
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:44.820]  be so negative about our iqs dropping and and and and the average person being close to bankruptcy
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:48.660]  just be positive and i'm like okay i'm gonna be positive then everything's
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:55.300]  everything's wonderful obama care is a great success uh isn't it chris oh yeah i was just
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:25:00.660]  wearing an obama mask i work in the health care system in top end indiana and i was wearing
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:07.060]  an obama mask that you have on your info wars dot com magazine for october and everyone's
[01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:11.860]  loving it you know i had like the upper management come by and taking pictures of me and stuff yeah
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:16.420]  for those that don't know you could cut off the cover it was obama care as a skull which is death
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:20.740]  for the elderly and others death panels the trendies love it it's liberal they didn't get some more
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:24.900]  welfare if they kill somebody of course they'll be killed as well just teaching them to have that
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:31.380]  idea and so what happened when you were wearing the loving obama care mask no i was i i got a very
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:37.060]  positive response from michael workers they were all like yeah i know it's gonna make people they're
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:42.260]  gonna cut their hours and everything from 40 hours to 29 hours i want to get to a very important
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:48.580]  predictive programming issue i it sounds very animal alec but i just i have to bring it up
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:57.220]  last christmas uh i was watching home alone too lost in new york with melancholy hulkin and
[01:25:57.220 --> 01:26:03.700]  joe peskin so far and it was very strange because i've seen this movie before and i never noticed
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:09.700]  this but at the last segment at the very second round of york and stuff and he's having fun and
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:14.580]  all that and he's on the world trade center he's on the observation deck taking polaroid photos
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:23.140]  and so forth and it zooms out in it very next scene it has a huge bold lettered clad
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:30.260]  saying saying airport security it just quick snap your fingers from the world trade center
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:35.380]  that might have been a coincidence but i appreciate your call there's no doubt that the cia came to
[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:40.740]  fox because i've talked to people involved dean haggling and others and said we want an episode
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:46.500]  where a jet flies in the world trade center and blows it up to attack afghanistan but it's really
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:51.780]  the government in a drill remote control that we blame it on muslims and then six months later that
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:27:00.900]  happened and listen it isn't just that i'd covered that show i get a call from like 93.7's producer
[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:09.860]  sister station to 590 a.m and she goes hey uh dean haggling i said haggman i can't remember

[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:32.100]  that being staged the cia came to us and uh you know the maker of the x falls was all freaked out
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:36.420]  and everything after it happened chris carter i mean this is the twilight zone i'm living in

[01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:05.220]  right now jerry and then kaleb allen damien leaky and others jerry in tennessee are on the air
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:11.300]  hey uh i got some pretty important info from my buddy in the kateke national gaurd that i
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:18.340]  think everybody should hear um i talked to him about a week ago when the uh info came out about
[01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:25.700]  the uh you know the mp's garden for the fema doing the confiscations yes i was sent by a member
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:30.500]  of the military police who gave us his info and name and documents video of them being
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:34.340]  taught that fema is their new command but that's also in the news it's not like i just believe
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:39.860]  the video and that they're being trained for gun confiscation during uh chivalry unrest
[01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:45.860]  and a suspension of the constitution go ahead exactly well i told him about this and he said
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:50.820]  oh no i haven't heard anything like that i'm under command of the governor of kentucky
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:56.900]  he wouldn't go along with anything like that that was you know a week ago well saturday morning
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:03.140]  at midnight friday night he'd been on grill and i got this text from him and uh it kind of blew
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:09.220]  my mind let me see if i can get through here um he said it's a million this white he said just
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:16.660]  thought you should know uh we are now at the state q r s quick reaction course we're getting right
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:20.740]  control training just got all kinds of new right gear issues with the armory including
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:26.180]  non-lethal weapons such as tear gas and rubber bullets handcuffs bats and buffer shield also
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:31.140]  tasers it's our whole battalion this is new to us because we are not a military police battalion
[01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:36.740]  i was about to say they're even training the auto mechanics now the last year and the enemy
[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:40.980]  they train them to fight as the tea party and gun owners and so for those that don't know what this
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:46.180]  caller's saying is actually in the army times it's actually in stars and stripes it's hiding in plain
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:52.180]  view that obama and his controllers are preparing for a total collapse and training the entire
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:58.740]  national guard for one mission taken over society finish the rest so receiving police
[01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:03.460]  right control training all of a sudden it's kind of off kilter because the mp's already
[01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:08.900]  have this training why when you think about it the state of Kentucky will have over 5 000 soldiers
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:14.340]  trained in right control to aid police the reason is in case of martial law i have heard martial
[01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:20.340]  law a dozen times in my classes two days and they're like we just want you to know what may
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:24.820]  be coming it's martial law and the government's allowed to take the guns in a civil emergency
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:29.860]  we need our guns during a collapse of society every statistic shows makes the crime rate lower
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:37.380]  but the default is Katrina gun confiscation and people will make any excuse they can but man i
[01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:43.380]  tell you everywhere they are training for coordinating cities and confiscating guns and
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:48.660]  again they're going to cut the welfare until folks riot to set the precedent for a permanent
[01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:55.620]  military force so the good news is it's also the bad news is that the first time they implode things
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:37:00.500]  it won't be that bad and they've done this in other countries it's an imf world bank plan they
[01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:06.100]  played it out they've tested it though it'll be a small collapse at first then they stabilize things
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:12.900]  and then if we go along with that and buy into the occupation they are going to shut everything off
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:17.700]  and steal everything including the pensions and folks you don't say you didn't hear it because
[01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:23.060]  i'm warning everybody i'm not bragging it's just fact it didn't fun to be up point on this
[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:28.260]  i've done the research i've researched the history it didn't hard but i'm the only guy that did it
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:35.780]  it seems we're following an exact paradigm here and it's very scary to be the guy on the radio
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:40.740]  it's surreal who knows what's going on talking about this go ahead and tell me what else your friend
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:46.580]  told you well that that was pretty much the gist of it now he's gone from a guy who was excited
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:52.980]  about you know serving for Kentucky he would always defend and be like no i don't i'm not under obama
[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:57.860]  i'm under the governor of Kentucky now he's posting talking about he's counting down the days until he
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:03.300]  gets out well see and that's the problem that's the plan i told my dad this is a doctor still had
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:09.060]  another five years to work or so if he wanted to but he was near retirement you know 64 he said look
[01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:13.460]  son i know they want me to quit but i just can't do this and sign these documents waving my rights
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:20.900]  and and and and doing all this and everybody i know police military doctors everybody that
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:26.660]  served america faithfully is getting out and then all your left was the scum so see how that plan
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:31.380]  works what do we do about that you can't demand they stay in it when it's bad but what do you do
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:38.980]  there's nothing we can do alex this this is a foregone conclusion and it's the judgment of god
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:43.780]  that lady got up in the congress the other day and whether she was a brainwashed victim i personally
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:50.020]  believed she'd been under conviction from the lord she was it's why back for me is a big red flag
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:55.300]  judgments coming we're not none of us none of a little bit repeated a long time ago the book of
[01:38:55.300 --> 01:39:00.500]  revelation is happening and we're with no no i hear you i hear you i hate to say it i can feel it i
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:04.100]  think it's already started if you notice how crazy folks are going they're being given great
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:09.700]  delusion i think the judgment's already starting and as the book of revelation is something that
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:13.700]  happens my preacher just said the other day it's not going to snap your fingers and you're in it
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:18.180]  you build into it we're building into it now and if you you have to have your head in the fans and
[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:24.260]  not fit and notice who does homeland security say the enemy is born again christians folks that
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:29.140]  believe in the second coming of christ that means you believe in the antichrist coming and will resist
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:35.220]  it that was on 60 minutes in like 1995 she said if you believe in the second coming of christ
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:40.020]  you were a cult member you are a terrorist in fact pull up her full quote you probably
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:44.900]  find the video i used to have it uh uh yeah we played it about a month ago where she says
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:50.660]  if you believe in the second coming of christ you are a cult member because these people
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:56.580]  are out and even if you don't believe in god folks these people are like manifesting it

[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:42.900]  looks really bad that's all i can say yeah and uh on a second point i'd like to ask you a question
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:51.220]  a couple years ago actually if i think it was 2000 2000 uh you um wide about bill cooper
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:55.620]  swearing and then kicking him off the air i'd like to wonder i'd like to get your point well you
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:41:00.580]  mean you just called in about some dead talk show host uh to like create some youtube video
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:04.100]  i had bill cooper on my radio show and he kept cussing and we have a delay
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:09.860]  and i had to cut him off and then finally ended the segment got him off gracefully bill cooper was
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:15.540]  famous for cussing constantly and then you guys say well the the radio show you have recorded on
[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:21.380]  youtube doesn't do it and that's because when it's on am and fm jack ash then you don't hear it
[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:27.860]  so there's your answer just it's unbelievable the whole new world order is coming down on us

[01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:05.140]  because he made up something called a new world order that all these world leaders are calling for
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:09.540]  knowing him and cnbc says we're under global government of the new world order no no no
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:16.260]  it's alex jones that's why the obama care doesn't work or it's it's it's anybody else that doesn't
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:21.620]  buy into it actually they've said it's secret republican sabotage they've been saying that for
[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:28.980]  two weeks of the obama care website they have surrogates say it though i'm sorry alan in florida
[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:35.700]  finish your point up recap what you were saying and get into it sure alex so this individual was a
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:44.420]  veteran tsa checkpoint worker told me that suddenly this was in january of this year the tsa had
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:52.820]  rolled out new training for a um actor shooter scenario and this worker seemed very upset and
[01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:58.260]  actually afraid the worker told me they were afraid to go to work and they were told always
[01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:03.700]  look for an escape route you know at any time a shooter could show up and if that happens
[01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:10.340]  the tsa needs to save themselves don't worry about protecting the passengers save yourself first
[01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:18.980]  now um like i told you i recently become partly thanks to you uh a citizen journalist and i published
[01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:24.580]  this at washington times communities um about you know i thought you've called before didn't you
[01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:32.260]  call a couple weeks ago mentioning your fear of a mass shooting uh yes sir wow now i'm freaking out
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:37.460]  right now i remember in fact tell your name we pulled it up and saw your article you actually
[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:41.860]  warned of this go ahead what's your name yeah actually alan i have the same name as you know
[01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:49.940]  relation alan jones um so about two weeks after this um something strange happened i was approached
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:56.180]  in a public place um by this guy with a camera who just came up to me and started taking pictures of
[01:51:56.180 --> 01:52:03.620]  me and then telling me things about where i used to live different cities and uh then just took off
[01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:11.060]  so uh i've since come to learn i believe that person is a dhs contractor uh as a canine handler
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:18.580]  but yeah uh this person uh was upset that this was new training they had never seen in their life
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:27.940]  uh at the tsa well sir it sounds like you need to uh cover this more but i remember you calling
[01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:31.700]  what was it two three weeks ago you were worried about a mass shooting in an airport
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:36.580]  and then you got harassed by some operative because they knew you were onto it wow we're
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:41.380]  living in a spy movie i mean i mean that's all i could say you should go find that youtube clip
[01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:46.020]  you remember when you called in was it two three weeks ago or a month ago when was that i don't
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:50.820]  know i don't know if i mentioned this particular story no you called in during the day because
[01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:55.540]  i remember saying this and having a discussion and it was you and i said i'm worried they're
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:53:03.060]  going to stage a mass shooting probably at lax i remember that call um okay i i can't remember
[01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:09.460]  problem is i do like 16 17 hours a week or more just a live radio but i remember god bless you
[01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:15.620]  brother i appreciate your call uh anybody can search tsa prepares for mass shootings you can
[01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:20.580]  find articles from a month ago you name it but i want to go to a report speaking of the demonization
[01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:26.180]  of gun owners right now then we'll come back and see if i can find that news article uh here is
[01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:33.380]  that uh report dealing with the demonization of gun owners is owning a gun racist remember three
[01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:38.420]  and a half years ago when they were trying to pass obama care and we were reading the legislation
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:43.220]  and pointing out that it was written by insurance companies to raise premiums and kick people off
[01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:49.300]  their existing plans and was a giant fraud we were called racist if you didn't support obama
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:55.140]  care you were racist there was no proof no reason no logic well the same thing is happening again
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:54:01.700]  we've seen in the last year this drumbeat by fox sports columnist like whitlock and others
[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:10.020]  that you are racist if you basically own guns or if you're a member of the nra that you are the new
[01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:16.260]  coup claude's clan i did not go as far as i would like to go because my my thoughts on the nra
[01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:23.220]  uh and america's gun culture i i believe the nra is the new kkk well the drumbeat has been
[01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:29.220]  intensifying with a new study put out by a brit and an australian two places where their populations
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:37.220]  have been disarmed putting together doctored statistics to say that owning guns is racist
[01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:41.700]  that's right ladies and gentlemen if you own guns it's because you don't like black people
[01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:47.060]  of course uh a few years ago uh michael moore didn't even need statistics to say this he said
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:51.380]  scared white people out in the countryside have these because they don't like black people
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:58.660]  but what jason whitlock of fox and what bob costas and what michael moore don't want you to know
[01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:03.140]  is the historical fact that at the end of the civil war they were passing laws so that black
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:09.860]  folks couldn't own guns in the south and the nra was founded to teach blacks how to use firearms
[01:55:09.860 --> 01:55:14.740]  to protect themselves from the coup claude's clan this is a fact it was one of the main reasons
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:21.860]  the national rifle association was founded but in this upside down world the nra and gun owners
[01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:28.980]  collectively are told that we are the new coup claude's clan because we are against individuals
[01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:34.740]  being ganged up on and abused and because the nra was founded to fight the coup claude's clan
[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:44.580]  thank the lord for our constitution i also want to thank the nra for its legacy the national
[01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:53.060]  rifle association was started founded by religious leaders who wanted to protect free slaves from
[01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:59.300]  the coup claude's clan they would raise money buy arms show the free slaves how to use those arms
[01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:04.900]  and protect their families god bless you many of us probably wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:11.060]  the nra the truth is none of these so-called liberals that are really authoritarian progressives
[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:18.260]  they are for the progression of tyranny want the state that's arming to the teeth to be restricted
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:23.860]  they don't want all of the hollywood stars who are anti-gun for other individuals to have their
[01:56:23.860 --> 01:56:29.460]  armed bodyguards taken away no no no they're just for the mass of the commoners who can't afford
[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:36.020]  bodyguards they're just for us to be disarmed these people are anti-liberty anti-freedom in
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:42.580]  fact recently eddie vetter came out of pearl june and said that people are trying to take his free
[01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:47.380]  speech away because they're arguing with him saying they don't want to have their guns taken away
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:52.580]  they also don't think that you have the right to speak as an American as a taxpayer
[01:56:55.140 --> 01:57:00.580]  to take your right of self-defense away so you argue against him and then he calls that an attack
