[00:00.000 --> 00:19.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, the southern border is wide open.
[00:19.680 --> 00:29.960]  We are on pace to accept almost three million illegal immigrants in the calendar year 2021
[00:29.960 --> 00:39.960]  This is an invasion. This is a population replacement. This is a collapse the United States of America strategy.
[00:39.960 --> 00:46.960]  Most of these people coming in would not legitimately qualify for asylum. They're coming here because it's a free ride.
[00:46.960 --> 00:50.960]  It's a free ticket and party on baby.
[00:50.960 --> 01:02.960]  So our crew with Alex Jones is back down at the southern border. Here is just some of the reports that they are filing.
[01:02.960 --> 01:09.960]  So we're approaching the border wall and we were here last week. The gates were wide open. No Border Patrol vehicles here.
[01:09.960 --> 01:23.960]  Today we're seeing the same thing again. This border wall is actually about a half mile inside US territory, but it is supposed to be the final barrier that makes it difficult for illegals to cross.
[01:23.960 --> 01:38.960]  And every time we come out here, the gates are literally just wide open completely wide open with no Border Patrol or law enforcement or any kind of agency that's going to stop these illegals from coming across.
[01:38.960 --> 01:50.960]  And we saw it last week. We're seeing it again today. It's continuing on under divided administration. We now literally, literally have a wide open US border policy.
[01:50.960 --> 02:00.960]  But then it says no trespass. Keep going. Right. So Americans are not allowed to come in here. Okay. Supposedly, even though this is US property, we're not allowed to come in here.
[02:00.960 --> 02:13.960]  They tell us no trespassing. Again, we're about a half a mile from the actual river from the border. If you look down there in that tree line where that dike is, the river is just on the other side of that dike.
[02:13.960 --> 02:23.960]  But so now illegals that are crossing across the river at night, they come across this farmland. This border wall is supposed to be what stops them and it's wide open.
[02:23.960 --> 02:33.960]  As you can see, you don't see any Border Patrol presence here at all. Zero. This is the wide open border policy of the Biden administration.
[02:33.960 --> 02:41.960]  The wall and the border that Trump tried so hard to finish and close to protect America is now wide open.
[02:41.960 --> 02:48.960]  And we have a guy who stole the election telling people rush the US border and now congratulating the coyotes on the swiveling yesterday.
[02:48.960 --> 03:03.960]  So if you'd like, we can go along this border wall. I'll show you more open gates again with no Border Patrol presence, no law enforcement presence.
[03:03.960 --> 03:10.960]  So just more of what we captured and witnessed last week.
[03:10.960 --> 03:19.960]  Probably we don't even know the actual numbers. I mean, we know the numbers that we have on record, 171 illegal border crossings in March of 2021.
[03:19.960 --> 03:26.960]  That's just on record. We don't know how many people crossed without running to Border Patrol or being caught by Border Patrol.
[03:26.960 --> 03:39.960]  These are numbers that are not on the books. Border Patrol has said it's as many as 1000 illegal crossings a day that don't even make the books.
[03:39.960 --> 03:47.960]  So what's the plan? Who's funding all of this? Who's facilitating all this? Who's promoting and organizing?
[03:47.960 --> 03:54.960]  What's the plan once they get here? Most of them can't even speak English. Most of them have no prospects.
[03:54.960 --> 04:04.960]  Well, see, you're asking these questions, thinking logically, trying to figure out how to solve problems.
[04:04.960 --> 04:10.960]  The real agenda here is to create problems. The real agenda here is to collapse the United States.
[04:10.960 --> 04:22.960]  The real agenda here is to set a precedent that there is no border. There is no such thing as illegal immigration. You bigot. You racist.
[04:22.960 --> 04:29.960]  So you say, well, what's the plan? Well, that is the plan. There is no plan. Chaos is the plan.
[04:29.960 --> 04:36.960]  Destabilization is the plan. Collapse is the plan.
[04:36.960 --> 04:42.960]  So we're going to be having more from Alex Jones coming up today on the Alex Jones show from the southern border.
[04:42.960 --> 04:49.960]  We also have all kinds of breaking news, the latest on COVID. The world isn't afraid of the fake pandemic anymore.
[04:49.960 --> 04:57.960]  And so now they're running new fear mongering campaigns and other lies from the Democrat Party and their media cohorts as well.
[04:57.960 --> 05:03.960]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world. They are creating insecurity, crime, war, and famine.
[05:03.960 --> 05:10.960]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our family's sakes, but also our community.
[05:10.960 --> 05:17.960]  And citizensstronghold.com is the best place to go to get high quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.
[05:17.960 --> 05:25.960]  Again, this is high quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find. We've worked with them for years, but they can never supply enough to our audience.
[05:25.960 --> 05:31.960]  They have massively expanded their factories. It's made right here in America, and they're ready to ship it to right now.
[05:31.960 --> 05:37.960]  Citizensstronghold.com. When you go there, put in promo code Alex and get 10% off on your purchases.
[05:37.960 --> 05:43.960]  They have it for children, they have it for women, they have it for men. They have bat packs that didn't unfold and are full top body armor.
[05:43.960 --> 05:51.960]  They've got it all right now ready to ship to you, 10% off. And the globalists are coming to try to stop the sale of it soon.
[05:51.960 --> 05:56.960]  And that's why you need to get it now at Citizensstronghold.com. Promo code Alex and get 10% off.
[06:22.960 --> 06:27.960]  I tried to make sure close to some information as they moved through the collection there.
[06:27.960 --> 06:30.960]  But it didn't look like it.
[06:30.960 --> 06:35.960]  Motorcycles. Where the circuits are flying by.
[06:35.960 --> 06:40.960]  I kept dreaming of the world. I thought I'd never see it.
[06:40.960 --> 06:43.960]  One day.
[06:43.960 --> 06:56.960]  Music
[06:56.960 --> 07:03.960]  So here we are at South International Boulevard. So here we are at South International Boulevard and Rio Grande.
[07:03.960 --> 07:11.960]  Right here in South Texas on the Texas-Mexico border. And this is a giant illegal facility being massively expanded by Joe Biden, the
[07:11.960 --> 07:18.960]  public president, who said once I'm in office immediately surge the United States.
[07:18.960 --> 07:26.960]  And now children, many of them kidnapped, it's on record, he was sent reports, are being smuggled and given to the Democratic Party.
[07:26.960 --> 07:33.960]  So they come across the border, they're taken here by buses, by the board patrol that's now being ordered by Biden to engage in this crime with them,
[07:33.960 --> 07:43.960]  paid the bed. They then bring them to this facility for a few days, prepare them, and then put it right here.
[07:43.960 --> 07:45.960]  Here come the buses, they don't want us getting this.
[07:45.960 --> 07:46.960]  Let's go, get across the street.
[07:46.960 --> 07:51.960]  Hey, you're running criminal activity, don't you do your color law without spotting the way.
[07:51.960 --> 07:58.960]  No, this is not private property, this is right away. And you're smuggling children. You don't try your color law with me, do you understand that?
[07:58.960 --> 08:07.960]  This is illegal. This is illegal. And you're outside your jurisdiction, you're a fraud. You're a security guard and a liar.
[08:07.960 --> 08:13.960]  Those are kidnapped children and families illegally being smuggled in the United States.
[08:13.960 --> 08:19.960]  Don't you try your security guard stuff with us. We know you're trying to destroy this country, we're here to stop you.
[08:19.960 --> 08:24.960]  You and your boss, Biden, that said rush the border, collapse this country.
[08:24.960 --> 08:31.960]  Our reporters were out here a few days ago and you told them they can't be here. Those are power poles, those are ride a ways that the taxpayers pay for.
[08:31.960 --> 08:36.960]  We have right to ride horses down this, to walk down this, to whatever you want right here.
[08:36.960 --> 08:42.960]  You're putting these barriers up right here, this right here violates state and federal law.
[08:42.960 --> 08:50.960]  This is an illegal incumbrance like everything else you're doing. Everything you do is a goddamn crime.
[08:50.960 --> 08:54.960]  Just because you come and wave your finger at us, doesn't make you the boss.
[08:54.960 --> 08:59.960]  It's what you call color law, just like they're doing smuggling these children here.
[08:59.960 --> 09:09.960]  It's whole things a goddamn fraud.
[09:09.960 --> 09:15.960]  All of this is taxpayer paid for. All of this is a giant criminal fraud.
[09:15.960 --> 09:19.960]  All of this, stay out of my space, buddy.
[09:19.960 --> 09:25.960]  You're already over here with your color law, unlawfully trying to tell us we can't be right over there.
[09:25.960 --> 09:28.960]  And this whole thing is illegal to begin with.
[09:28.960 --> 09:34.960]  You also be citizen arrested for what you're doing. Shame on you aiding and abetting child trafficking.
[09:34.960 --> 09:39.960]  You're destroying this country. You had to wear your two masks, you're a slave.
[09:39.960 --> 09:43.960]  All of you are pathetic, unbelievable un-American garbage.
[09:43.960 --> 09:50.960]  All these people are signed on to criminal activity with smuggling of children illegally, massively expanding this facility,
[09:50.960 --> 09:54.960]  part of the United Nations program to collapse our border.
[09:54.960 --> 10:01.960]  And just a week ago, this was packed with media. Now there's no one here because we're just supposed to accept this giant crime.
[10:01.960 --> 10:12.960]  All color law garbage.
[10:12.960 --> 10:15.960]  What are you guys so afraid of?
[10:15.960 --> 10:17.960]  Why are you guys afraid of the media?
[10:17.960 --> 10:20.960]  What are you trying to hide?
[10:20.960 --> 10:25.960]  Seriously, you know there's kids getting raped in there, right?
[10:25.960 --> 10:27.960]  I don't understand what you guys are trying to hide.
[10:27.960 --> 10:32.960]  That's right. We've talked to the whistleblowers who are good people inside about the children being raped,
[10:32.960 --> 10:39.960]  being raped by the older children that are really adults with fake IVs and being raped by some of the people that work here.
[10:39.960 --> 10:46.960]  And we know the FBI waives the law which they can't do to waive background checks
[10:46.960 --> 10:51.960]  so that sex predators can come get jobs and work in this illegal facility.
[10:51.960 --> 11:00.960]  This is a giant criminal fraud, giant sex trafficking operation.
[11:00.960 --> 11:06.960]  What makes you guys think you have the authority to tell the media they can't be on public property?
[11:06.960 --> 11:10.960]  Any media inquiry has to go to...
[11:10.960 --> 11:13.960]  I have to inquire you to be on public property?
[11:13.960 --> 11:16.960]  Any media inquiry has to go to...
[11:16.960 --> 11:21.960]  So I have to inquire you, my first amendment right, to be on public property.
[11:21.960 --> 11:24.960]  You feel like you have the authority to tell me that.
[11:24.960 --> 11:26.960]  All media inquires go to...
[11:26.960 --> 11:28.960]  On public property.
[11:28.960 --> 11:30.960]  Understand how you sound? I'm not trying to make you look dumb.
[11:30.960 --> 11:32.960]  I'm trying to get you to think about what you're doing.
[11:32.960 --> 11:36.960]  And the reason we're pissed off is we know the law.
[11:36.960 --> 11:40.960]  You've gotten away with every other major media organization being told they had to go across the street
[11:40.960 --> 11:42.960]  when there's a public right away right here.
[11:42.960 --> 11:47.960]  And now you're building entrances that jump out into the road.
[11:47.960 --> 11:50.960]  That's an illegal little production there.
[11:50.960 --> 11:53.960]  It doesn't matter if you're God, Biden says it's okay.
[11:53.960 --> 11:59.960]  So I'm here seeing a giant facility, many kidnapped children inside there, smuggled children,
[11:59.960 --> 12:04.960]  being given fake passports, fake IDs, and traveled into the interior of the U.S.
[12:04.960 --> 12:06.960]  to Democratic Party crime syndicates.
[12:06.960 --> 12:12.960]  And I am ashamed to be an American that this giant criminal facility is operating in plain view.
[12:12.960 --> 12:14.960]  God damn it!
[12:18.960 --> 12:20.960]  Let's do that.
[12:23.960 --> 12:25.960]  Good morning.
[12:25.960 --> 12:27.960]  I'm good, I don't want to.
[12:27.960 --> 12:29.960]  Absolutely. Take care, God.
[12:29.960 --> 12:30.960]  What's your name?
[12:30.960 --> 12:31.960]  What's your name?
[12:31.960 --> 12:32.960]  There you go.
[12:32.960 --> 12:33.960]  Can I give you more?
[12:33.960 --> 12:34.960]  What's your name?
[12:34.960 --> 12:35.960]  Just for your fruit.
[12:35.960 --> 12:36.960]  Take care, God.
[12:36.960 --> 12:37.960]  Thanks for being here.
[12:37.960 --> 12:38.960]  Alright, it looks like something to stand out.
[12:38.960 --> 12:39.960]  I'm going to ask what you were used to.
[12:39.960 --> 12:40.960]  Take care.
[12:40.960 --> 12:41.960]  And it's now talking now.
[12:41.960 --> 12:42.960]  Look at that.
[12:42.960 --> 12:43.960]  Take care.
[12:43.960 --> 12:45.960]  There's the loving act of the folks here.
[12:45.960 --> 12:46.960]  Has the county smuggled?
[12:46.960 --> 12:47.960]  Yes, we got it.
[12:47.960 --> 12:48.960]  I want to do this.
[12:48.960 --> 12:49.960]  I just have a question.
[12:49.960 --> 12:51.960]  We're so nice to us.
[12:51.960 --> 12:56.960]  How come we're here to expose kids that are being raped in there,
[12:56.960 --> 12:58.960]  but we're told to go across the street when we're here
[12:58.960 --> 13:01.960]  to bring in some exposure to these migrants.
[13:01.960 --> 13:02.960]  Is that your answer?
[13:02.960 --> 13:04.960]  That's all that left is PR deals.
[13:04.960 --> 13:06.960]  They told Senator Cruz,
[13:06.960 --> 13:09.960]  oh, you're hurting their privacy.
[13:09.960 --> 13:10.960]  Smuggled children.
[13:10.960 --> 13:12.960]  We have videos of children crying for mommy.
[13:12.960 --> 13:13.960]  They're not with their mom.
[13:13.960 --> 13:14.960]  They've been grabbed by some man,
[13:14.960 --> 13:15.960]  grabbed by some woman.
[13:15.960 --> 13:17.960]  They're used to get into the country over and over again.
[13:17.960 --> 13:18.960]  This is on record.
[13:18.960 --> 13:20.960]  The Senate report found five years ago,
[13:20.960 --> 13:24.960]  Obama placed tens of thousands of children with smugglers,
[13:24.960 --> 13:26.960]  many of them sex smugglers.
[13:26.960 --> 13:28.960]  Trump tried to stop that.
[13:28.960 --> 13:31.960]  And now it's been started here again.
[13:31.960 --> 13:33.960]  Absolutely insane.
[13:33.960 --> 13:35.960]  You know what's interesting, guys,
[13:35.960 --> 13:36.960]  is in this facility behind us,
[13:36.960 --> 13:38.960]  there are kids that have been trafficked,
[13:38.960 --> 13:40.960]  fighting called for a surge at the border.
[13:40.960 --> 13:43.960]  He literally is the welcome wagon.
[13:43.960 --> 13:45.960]  I would, in fact, make sure that there is,
[13:45.960 --> 13:48.960]  we immediately surge to the border.
[13:48.960 --> 13:50.960]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[13:50.960 --> 13:51.960]  They deserve to be heard.
[13:51.960 --> 13:52.960]  That's who we are.
[13:52.960 --> 13:54.960]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee
[13:54.960 --> 13:56.960]  and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[13:56.960 --> 13:58.960]  I would change the order that the president just changed,
[13:58.960 --> 14:01.960]  saying women who were being beaten and abused
[14:01.960 --> 14:04.960]  could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum.
[14:04.960 --> 14:06.960]  And by the way, retrospectively,
[14:06.960 --> 14:09.960]  you know, the 25th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act is up.
[14:09.960 --> 14:12.960]  The Republican Congress has not reauthorized it.
[14:12.960 --> 14:14.960]  Let's put pressure on the past,
[14:14.960 --> 14:16.960]  the Violence Against Women Act now.
[14:16.960 --> 14:17.960]  But then we go back.
[14:17.960 --> 14:18.960]  You didn't answer the question.
[14:18.960 --> 14:21.960]  Did you make a mistake with those deportations?
[14:21.960 --> 14:24.960]  The president did the best thing
[14:24.960 --> 14:26.960]  that was able to be done at the time.
[14:26.960 --> 14:27.960]  How about you?
[14:27.960 --> 14:29.960]  I'm the Vice President of the United States.
[14:29.960 --> 14:31.960]  Secretary Castro.
[14:31.960 --> 14:34.960]  Welcome, my fellow Americans.
[14:34.960 --> 14:38.960]  First and foremost, I want to thank you for choosing us
[14:38.960 --> 14:42.960]  and believing that America is worthy of your aspirations.
[14:42.960 --> 14:44.960]  Every immigrant comes from America
[14:44.960 --> 14:47.960]  from different circumstances and for different reasons.
[14:47.960 --> 14:50.960]  But you all have one thing in common,
[14:50.960 --> 14:51.960]  courage.
[14:51.960 --> 14:56.960]  The courage it takes to sacrifice and make this journey.
[14:56.960 --> 14:59.960]  The courage to leave your homes, your lives, your loved ones
[14:59.960 --> 15:02.960]  and come to a nation that is more than just a place,
[15:02.960 --> 15:04.960]  but rather an idea.
[15:04.960 --> 15:07.960]  An idea that where everyone is created equal
[15:07.960 --> 15:09.960]  and deserves to be treated equally.
[15:09.960 --> 15:12.960]  The idea that we have as a nation,
[15:12.960 --> 15:15.960]  and we can define American one word,
[15:15.960 --> 15:19.960]  possibilities, possibilities since it's founded,
[15:19.960 --> 15:24.960]  that very idea has been nurtured, enriched and advanced
[15:24.960 --> 15:27.960]  by the contributions, sacrifices and dreams of immigrants
[15:27.960 --> 15:31.960]  like you and immigrants like my own ancestors from Ireland,
[15:31.960 --> 15:33.960]  like generations of fellow Americans.
[15:33.960 --> 15:35.960]  Possibilities except when they have a fake pandemic
[15:35.960 --> 15:37.960]  to take away your civil liberties and rights.
[15:37.960 --> 15:38.960]  You sure are possibilities.
[15:38.960 --> 15:40.960]  I'm an American president.
[15:40.960 --> 15:42.960]  The title I'm most proud of,
[15:42.960 --> 15:46.960]  citizen, citizen of the United States of America.
[15:46.960 --> 15:48.960]  But now that means anything.
[15:48.960 --> 15:50.960]  It means any country on earth.
[15:50.960 --> 15:52.960]  All you got to do is come across that southern border
[15:52.960 --> 15:53.960]  and they'll invite you into that facility.
[15:53.960 --> 15:55.960]  But not if you're an American citizen.
[15:55.960 --> 15:57.960]  No, no, no, no, no.
[15:57.960 --> 16:01.960]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers
[16:01.960 --> 16:05.960]  that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[16:05.960 --> 16:08.960]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other
[16:08.960 --> 16:11.960]  major companies and engaging in massive censorship
[16:11.960 --> 16:13.960]  and organized crime racketeering.
[16:13.960 --> 16:16.960]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[16:16.960 --> 16:19.960]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain
[16:19.960 --> 16:21.960]  or want help building a website or want servers
[16:21.960 --> 16:24.960]  or any other major service, they've got it all
[16:24.960 --> 16:25.960]  and they're expanding.
[16:25.960 --> 16:28.960]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com
[16:28.960 --> 16:30.960]  and follow that link, you get all their services
[16:30.960 --> 16:34.960]  at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up
[16:34.960 --> 16:36.960]  for a new domain or a domain you move
[16:36.960 --> 16:38.960]  goes to fund the info war.
[16:38.960 --> 16:40.960]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers
[16:40.960 --> 16:43.960]  or any other type of services that you get from them.
[16:43.960 --> 16:46.960]  We get a win-win as we build a true open free internet again
[16:46.960 --> 16:48.960]  because the globalists are destroying
[16:48.960 --> 16:50.960]  what was open and what was free.
[16:50.960 --> 16:54.960]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there.
[16:54.960 --> 16:57.960]  infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[16:57.960 --> 16:59.960]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is a remarkable product

[17:04.960 --> 17:06.960]  It's always been one of our top 10 best sellers.
[17:06.960 --> 17:08.960]  We've had it for six years or more.
[17:08.960 --> 17:11.960]  But now it's our number one best selling product of all time
[17:11.960 --> 17:13.960]  because people are doing their research,
[17:13.960 --> 17:15.960]  they're doing their shopping and they're checking the fine print
[17:15.960 --> 17:19.960]  and they're discovering that as high quality vitamins and minerals
[17:19.960 --> 17:21.960]  all the essential vitamins and minerals

[17:35.960 --> 17:37.960]  it's 40% off.
[17:37.960 --> 17:39.960]  The supply chains are breaking down.
[17:39.960 --> 17:42.960]  However, we couldn't even get it because getting high quality ingredients
[17:42.960 --> 17:44.960]  is very, very hard and we're not going to cut corners,
[17:44.960 --> 17:46.960]  we're going to keep the quality at the highest levels.
[17:46.960 --> 17:49.960]  It also funds the InfoWars, so get your Vitamin Mineral Fusion now
[17:49.960 --> 18:10.960]  at infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[18:10.960 --> 18:20.960]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[18:20.960 --> 18:22.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[18:22.960 --> 18:32.960]  And now your host, Owen Schreuer.
[18:32.960 --> 18:39.960]  You just saw Alex Jones down at the southern border at the facility in Ghana,
[18:39.960 --> 18:44.960]  where tens of thousands, it'll be hundreds of thousands, maybe millions.
[18:44.960 --> 18:48.960]  I mean, who knows how long this illegal immigration pipeline
[18:48.960 --> 18:58.960]  criminal organization operation is going to be working.
[18:58.960 --> 19:02.960]  But think about it like this.
[19:02.960 --> 19:04.960]  As American citizens are standing outside,
[19:04.960 --> 19:08.960]  and this was me last week, it's Alex Jones this week,
[19:08.960 --> 19:11.960]  because we're not part of the sheep media,
[19:11.960 --> 19:17.960]  we're not part of the fake news media, the dinosaur media.
[19:17.960 --> 19:20.960]  We're alive, we got a spirit, we got a soul,
[19:20.960 --> 19:23.960]  so we're saying, okay, well, let's go across the street,
[19:23.960 --> 19:26.960]  let's get in that facility, let's not just do everything we're told
[19:26.960 --> 19:28.960]  like good slaves, and well, let's stand across the street
[19:28.960 --> 19:31.960]  and we can barely even get a view of what's going on in there.
[19:31.960 --> 19:34.960]  But this is what we're told to do, so we're just going to stand here.
[19:34.960 --> 19:37.960]  Yeah, it's comfortable that way and still get our paychecks,
[19:37.960 --> 19:40.960]  so it's fine, it's fine.
[19:40.960 --> 19:42.960]  Now, we go right up to the facility.
[19:42.960 --> 19:45.960]  We say, why are we being rejected entry?
[19:45.960 --> 19:49.960]  Why are you out here doing illegal criminal activity?
[19:49.960 --> 19:55.960]  Who owns this? Who's operating this?
[19:55.960 --> 19:57.960]  Think about it like this.
[19:57.960 --> 20:00.960]  As you see, the American citizens, Alex Jones,
[20:00.960 --> 20:04.960]  Drew Hernandez, our crew out there asking questions,
[20:04.960 --> 20:09.960]  what happens? Five, six, seven security guards from the facility
[20:09.960 --> 20:19.960]  come rushing up to confront them? Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
[20:19.960 --> 20:24.960]  But now, what if Alex and crew decided,
[20:24.960 --> 20:27.960]  we're just going to come across the southern border illegally,
[20:27.960 --> 20:29.960]  we're going to hop into border patrol,
[20:29.960 --> 20:34.960]  and then you'll be allowed in the facility.
[20:34.960 --> 20:39.960]  So you see, there's no logic here, there's no common sense here.
[20:39.960 --> 20:45.960]  Why is it citizens are being rejected by this facility
[20:45.960 --> 20:48.960]  and being confronted by a massive security force
[20:48.960 --> 20:52.960]  when illegal immigration is happening around the clock
[20:52.960 --> 20:55.960]  and they're let into that facility to play on the playgrounds
[20:55.960 --> 20:57.960]  and play on the soccer fields and basketball courts
[20:57.960 --> 21:01.960]  and eat the food truck foods that are being prepared?
[21:01.960 --> 21:05.960]  Why is that? Why would that be?
[21:05.960 --> 21:09.960]  Well, because this is organized crime.
[21:09.960 --> 21:15.960]  That's why this is a criminal operation of illegal immigration
[21:15.960 --> 21:20.960]  and much worse, but that at the very least.
[21:20.960 --> 21:23.960]  So this was our drone footage from last week.
[21:23.960 --> 21:29.960]  This was the closest we were allowed to see into the facility.
[21:29.960 --> 21:31.960]  And so you can see them playing soccer.
[21:31.960 --> 21:33.960]  They've got nice big soccer fields there
[21:33.960 --> 21:35.960]  and they got big playgrounds inside
[21:35.960 --> 21:37.960]  and they got the food trucks set up
[21:37.960 --> 21:40.960]  and all the electricity and energy that they need
[21:40.960 --> 21:44.960]  and they'll probably never be without power or plumbing,
[21:44.960 --> 21:49.960]  but after our infrastructure was sabotaged and shut down,
[21:49.960 --> 21:51.960]  there's still parts of Austin and Texas
[21:51.960 --> 21:53.960]  and entire condo complexes
[21:53.960 --> 21:55.960]  and apartment complexes and housing complexes
[21:55.960 --> 21:57.960]  that still can't even get their plumbing back on
[21:57.960 --> 21:59.960]  because of the sabotage of our government.
[21:59.960 --> 22:01.960]  But if you're an illegal immigrant,
[22:01.960 --> 22:03.960]  come right on in.
[22:03.960 --> 22:05.960]  Come right on into these new facilities.
[22:05.960 --> 22:07.960]  Here's a free bag of clothes.
[22:07.960 --> 22:09.960]  Here's some free food for however long you need it,
[22:09.960 --> 22:12.960]  free shelter, need some water, whatever you need.
[22:12.960 --> 22:14.960]  We got you.
[22:14.960 --> 22:19.960]  And if any American citizen dares try to even look inside
[22:19.960 --> 22:23.960]  this facility, we will send security guards after them
[22:23.960 --> 22:31.960]  and we'll make sure that they can't see what's happening here.
[22:31.960 --> 22:33.960]  You drive through Texas.
[22:33.960 --> 22:37.960]  You drive on the southern tip of Texas.
[22:37.960 --> 22:44.960]  Illegal immigrants are pouring through the border,
[22:44.960 --> 22:46.960]  pouring through the border.
[22:46.960 --> 22:51.960]  See, if you're driving north on 281,
[22:51.960 --> 22:53.960]  about every 20 miles or so,
[22:53.960 --> 22:55.960]  there's going to be a border patrol agent monitoring,
[22:55.960 --> 22:57.960]  making sure there's no illegal immigrants.
[22:57.960 --> 23:00.960]  They're going to have an entire, they have entire checkpoints
[23:00.960 --> 23:03.960]  about 40, 50 miles in from the southern border
[23:03.960 --> 23:05.960]  checking for illegal immigrants.
[23:05.960 --> 23:09.960]  So ironically, or not so much,
[23:09.960 --> 23:14.960]  when they were checking our vehicles,
[23:14.960 --> 23:17.960]  and I was filming, and I said,
[23:17.960 --> 23:19.960]  hey, I got a tip for you.
[23:19.960 --> 23:22.960]  There's tens of thousands of illegal immigrants
[23:22.960 --> 23:24.960]  crossing the southern border right now,
[23:24.960 --> 23:26.960]  about 50 miles south of here.
[23:26.960 --> 23:30.960]  They're checking our IDs and flash lighting into our car.
[23:30.960 --> 23:32.960]  Oh, yes.
[23:32.960 --> 23:34.960]  Any illegal immigrants in there?
[23:34.960 --> 23:36.960]  Are you all citizens?
[23:36.960 --> 23:38.960]  What difference does it make?
[23:38.960 --> 23:40.960]  If I wasn't a citizen, I'd just go back down
[23:40.960 --> 23:43.960]  about 50 miles south and I'd get everything I want for free.
[23:43.960 --> 23:45.960]  But hey, harass me, though.
[23:45.960 --> 23:47.960]  Harass me 50 miles inland.
[23:47.960 --> 23:50.960]  Harass me and my crew, American citizens,
[23:50.960 --> 23:52.960]  but the illegal immigration is happening
[23:52.960 --> 24:00.960]  wide, open, promoted, permitted, facilitated.
[24:00.960 --> 24:03.960]  Forget about your politics.
[24:03.960 --> 24:07.960]  Forget about what you think about borders or walls
[24:07.960 --> 24:09.960]  or immigration or illegal immigration.
[24:09.960 --> 24:13.960]  How about just some common sense?
[24:13.960 --> 24:15.960]  Is that so much to ask for?
[24:15.960 --> 24:17.960]  Can we have some common sense here?
[24:17.960 --> 24:19.960]  How about some common sense?
[24:19.960 --> 24:23.960]  Americans are suffering.
[24:23.960 --> 24:29.960]  We have a homeless epidemic here.
[24:29.960 --> 24:31.960]  We have veterans that are homeless.
[24:31.960 --> 24:33.960]  We have people that are struggling to pay bills.
[24:33.960 --> 24:35.960]  We have people that have been out of work.
[24:35.960 --> 24:38.960]  We have families that can't send their kids to schools.
[24:38.960 --> 24:40.960]  We have families that aren't sure
[24:40.960 --> 24:42.960]  where they're going to sleep tomorrow
[24:42.960 --> 24:44.960]  because our infrastructure has been shut down
[24:44.960 --> 24:48.960]  and our plumbing has exploded in Texas.
[24:48.960 --> 24:51.960]  Thanks, Democrats.
[24:51.960 --> 24:56.960]  Thanks, communists.
[24:56.960 --> 24:58.960]  We have an infrastructure that's collapsing
[24:58.960 --> 25:06.960]  and falling apart in many cities.
[25:06.960 --> 25:08.960]  But what is our priority?
[25:08.960 --> 25:10.960]  What do we do?
[25:10.960 --> 25:14.960]  We open up massive facilities,
[25:14.960 --> 25:17.960]  spend billions of dollars,
[25:17.960 --> 25:21.960]  and put non-citizens first.
[25:21.960 --> 25:24.960]  And so that's what this really is.
[25:24.960 --> 25:28.960]  This is putting non-citizens first.
[25:28.960 --> 25:31.960]  This is the exact opposite of America first.
[25:31.960 --> 25:34.960]  This is the exact opposite of caring about American cities
[25:34.960 --> 25:36.960]  and American citizens.
[25:36.960 --> 25:39.960]  What you're looking at is the New World Philadelphia,
[25:39.960 --> 25:43.960]  a total hellhole.
[25:43.960 --> 25:46.960]  But we won't be spending time and money
[25:46.960 --> 25:49.960]  on infrastructure here and building new facilities
[25:49.960 --> 25:51.960]  and taking care of these American citizens
[25:51.960 --> 25:54.960]  that live night by night in the streets,
[25:54.960 --> 25:57.960]  wondering where their next meal will come from.
[25:57.960 --> 26:00.960]  No, no, we spend billions of dollars
[26:00.960 --> 26:04.960]  to house and shelter and feed and clothe
[26:04.960 --> 26:10.960]  and facilitate illegal immigrants.
[26:10.960 --> 26:15.960]  So where's the common sense in that?
[26:15.960 --> 26:17.960]  No, the common sense would say,
[26:17.960 --> 26:21.960]  huh, that's an illegal operation.
[26:21.960 --> 26:23.960]  That's a criminal operation.
[26:23.960 --> 26:25.960]  That needs to be shut down immediately
[26:25.960 --> 26:29.960]  and everyone involved needs to be investigated.
[26:29.960 --> 26:32.960]  But that's if you want common sense.
[26:32.960 --> 26:34.960]  That's if you want to have a nation.
[26:34.960 --> 26:36.960]  That's if you want to have a country.
[26:36.960 --> 26:38.960]  That's if you want to have a sovereign nation state,
[26:38.960 --> 26:39.960]  a republic.
[26:39.960 --> 26:41.960]  That's if you want to be prosperous.
[26:41.960 --> 26:43.960]  Apparently, we're not interested in that anymore.
[26:43.960 --> 26:46.960]  So non-citizens will be put first.
[26:46.960 --> 26:47.960]  That's the new American way.
[26:47.960 --> 26:49.960]  You come here as a non-citizen.
[26:49.960 --> 26:51.960]  You get the red carpet treatment, anything you want.
[26:51.960 --> 26:52.960]  You're an American citizen.
[26:52.960 --> 26:55.960]  F.U., you piece of dirt, just die.
[26:55.960 --> 26:57.960]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time
[26:57.960 --> 27:01.960]  or my time and rattle off the successes
[27:01.960 --> 27:04.960]  and full-worses that if you're paying attention,
[27:04.960 --> 27:06.960]  you know we've done together.
[27:06.960 --> 27:08.960]  But I'll tell you this.
[27:08.960 --> 27:12.960]  The technocrats are really upping their game
[27:12.960 --> 27:16.960]  and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[27:16.960 --> 27:19.960]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance.
[27:19.960 --> 27:22.960]  So now is the time to understand that everything
[27:22.960 --> 27:24.960]  we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[27:24.960 --> 27:26.960]  Everything you warned your friends and family
[27:26.960 --> 27:28.960]  about is going to have to be true.
[27:28.960 --> 27:30.960]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[27:30.960 --> 27:32.960]  The power structures are to silence
[27:32.960 --> 27:35.960]  those of us that they can.
[27:35.960 --> 27:39.960]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[27:39.960 --> 27:41.960]  We have the power.
[27:41.960 --> 27:43.960]  But the sun is setting on humanity
[27:43.960 --> 27:45.960]  and setting on free speech.
[27:45.960 --> 27:48.960]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now
[27:48.960 --> 27:51.960]  to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[27:51.960 --> 27:56.960]  So be the polar bearer as you are.
[27:56.960 --> 27:58.960]  In the early 1990s,
[27:58.960 --> 28:02.960]  it was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[28:02.960 --> 28:04.960]  Wayne's World!
[28:04.960 --> 28:06.960]  Wayne's World!
[28:06.960 --> 28:09.960]  Even before I had an access to this show in the mid-1990s,
[28:09.960 --> 28:11.960]  I went and saw that movie and thought,
[28:11.960 --> 28:13.960]  man, that looks fun.
[28:13.960 --> 28:15.960]  You have to speak out and have your own ideas
[28:15.960 --> 28:17.960]  and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining
[28:17.960 --> 28:19.960]  because you're real.
[28:19.960 --> 28:21.960]  Wayne's World!
[28:21.960 --> 28:23.960]  We're not worthy!
[28:23.960 --> 28:25.960]  Every day when I cover these huge topics,
[28:25.960 --> 28:27.960]  I don't feel worthy to talk to you
[28:27.960 --> 28:29.960]  because these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[28:29.960 --> 28:31.960]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[28:31.960 --> 28:33.960]  I'm trying to get it right and most of the time we do.
[28:33.960 --> 28:35.960]  The globalists love lying to you.
[28:35.960 --> 28:37.960]  They love manipulating you.
[28:37.960 --> 28:39.960]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[28:39.960 --> 28:41.960]  They enjoy manipulating ideas
[28:41.960 --> 28:43.960]  and using people's ignorance against them.
[28:43.960 --> 28:46.960]  That for me is really such a discussion.
[28:46.960 --> 28:49.960]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew
[28:49.960 --> 28:52.960]  that we will never join the globalists.
[28:52.960 --> 28:54.960]  We will never knowingly manipulate you
[28:54.960 --> 28:56.960]  because we know we're all in this together.
[28:56.960 --> 28:59.960]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[28:59.960 --> 29:02.960]  America is about to have its energy cut off.
[29:02.960 --> 29:04.960]  Its borders destroyed.
[29:04.960 --> 29:07.960]  Its dollar brought down to nothing.
[29:07.960 --> 29:09.960]  All of you that have served Satan
[29:09.960 --> 29:12.960]  believe that you are on the right team.
[29:12.960 --> 29:15.960]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[29:15.960 --> 29:17.960]  So I ask all of you
[29:17.960 --> 29:20.960]  who are awake and who love God
[29:20.960 --> 29:22.960]  stop living in fear.
[29:22.960 --> 29:25.960]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[29:25.960 --> 29:27.960]  The enemy can't help itself.
[29:27.960 --> 29:31.960]  The enemy comes to kill, steal and destroy.
[29:31.960 --> 29:34.960]  We sit here as good people get upset about that
[29:34.960 --> 29:36.960]  and try to stop it. We should.
[29:36.960 --> 29:40.960]  But once it comes through, once it hits us,
[29:40.960 --> 29:44.960]  once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us,
[29:44.960 --> 29:47.960]  we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[29:47.960 --> 29:49.960]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[29:49.960 --> 29:51.960]  You're going under a judge but just like all the children
[29:51.960 --> 29:53.960]  that were aborted.
[29:53.960 --> 29:56.960]  This is the truth. This is the InfoWars.
[29:56.960 --> 29:59.960]  I actually bought this at Blocks, UHF frequencies.
[29:59.960 --> 30:02.960]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones
[30:02.960 --> 30:04.960]  are constantly spying on us,
[30:04.960 --> 30:08.960]  not just tracking and recording our GPS location,
[30:08.960 --> 30:11.960]  but recording audio and video as well,
[30:11.960 --> 30:14.960]  with or without a battery.
[30:14.960 --> 30:17.960]  Now with the InfoWars privacy pouch,
[30:17.960 --> 30:20.960]  you can go dark wherever you choose.
[30:20.960 --> 30:24.960]  Excellent. Now I have my own compact Faraday cage
[30:24.960 --> 30:26.960]  I can take wherever I want.
[30:26.960 --> 30:31.960]  And you can too at infowarstore.com.
[30:31.960 --> 30:35.960]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants,
[30:35.960 --> 30:38.960]  and now contact tracers
[30:38.960 --> 30:42.960]  all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[30:42.960 --> 30:45.960]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off
[30:45.960 --> 30:47.960]  and go dark.
[30:47.960 --> 30:49.960]  Support the InfoWars

[31:24.960 --> 31:30.960]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[31:30.960 --> 31:33.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[31:38.960 --> 31:41.960]  Well, here we are on the Texas-Mexico border.
[31:41.960 --> 31:44.960]  This is part of that beautiful wall
[31:44.960 --> 31:46.960]  that Trump built,
[31:46.960 --> 31:49.960]  securing the nation, standing up to globalism,
[31:49.960 --> 31:51.960]  standing up to replacement migration.
[31:51.960 --> 31:53.960]  But now, it's all been turned off
[31:53.960 --> 31:58.960]  and the gate's been opened. Look at this.
[31:58.960 --> 32:01.960]  And just about a half mile that way is Mexico,
[32:01.960 --> 32:03.960]  which has completely collapsed in law.
[32:03.960 --> 32:05.960]  It's just hundreds of thousands of dead.
[32:05.960 --> 32:07.960]  All their guns are banned there.
[32:07.960 --> 32:10.960]  So of course, all of the criminals in the state have guns.
[32:10.960 --> 32:13.960]  There's this huge border gate.
[32:13.960 --> 32:16.960]  It's electric.
[32:16.960 --> 32:23.960]  It's able to close this and open it, but now permanently opened by Joe Biden.
[32:23.960 --> 32:25.960]  Absolutely outrageous.
[32:25.960 --> 32:27.960]  So all of this infrastructure,
[32:27.960 --> 32:30.960]  billions and billions and billions of dollars,
[32:30.960 --> 32:32.960]  all completely shut down.
[32:32.960 --> 32:34.960]  So the Chinese could have their ancient wall
[32:34.960 --> 32:37.960]  and the old Brits could have their Hadrian's wall,
[32:37.960 --> 32:41.960]  but we can't have our wall here in America.
[32:41.960 --> 32:44.960]  And now Biden wants our guns as well,
[32:44.960 --> 32:47.960]  as the crime rate explodes across the country,
[32:47.960 --> 32:49.960]  particularly in blue cities.
[32:49.960 --> 32:51.960]  Crime rate in the U.S. has doubled.
[32:51.960 --> 32:55.960]  But 80% of that has been in the blue cities.
[32:55.960 --> 33:02.960]  All of this now are relic of an attempt to restore
[33:02.960 --> 33:04.960]  our republic before it was completely shut down.
[33:04.960 --> 33:06.960]  There's extremely powerful footage right here.
[33:06.960 --> 33:08.960]  Let me look at this shot.
[33:08.960 --> 33:14.960]  There's none of that blue sky.
[33:14.960 --> 33:16.960]  A symbol of America's sovereignty,
[33:16.960 --> 33:19.960]  a symbol of America's security being shut down.
[33:19.960 --> 33:21.960]  While they bankrupt the dollar,
[33:21.960 --> 33:22.960]  while they dissolve the borders,
[33:22.960 --> 33:23.960]  while they demoralize it,
[33:23.960 --> 33:25.960]  while they tell us we're racist and evil on every channel,
[33:25.960 --> 33:28.960]  while they tell us that America's time is over,
[33:28.960 --> 33:30.960]  while he shuts down more of our coal power plants,
[33:30.960 --> 33:33.960]  while China opens new ones every week.
[33:33.960 --> 33:35.960]  And I've seen shut down coal power plants here
[33:35.960 --> 33:37.960]  that have the big electrical wires going into them,
[33:37.960 --> 33:38.960]  and no more power going out.
[33:38.960 --> 33:40.960]  This really is the end of America.
[33:40.960 --> 33:41.960]  This is modern warfare.
[33:41.960 --> 33:43.960]  This is how they've shut us down.
[33:43.960 --> 33:45.960]  That makes my blood boil.
[33:45.960 --> 33:47.960]  Back to Owen Schroder in a live transmission.
[33:47.960 --> 33:49.960]  More reports coming up.
[33:49.960 --> 33:51.960]  So our country is under lockdown.
[33:51.960 --> 33:53.960]  Our kids can't go to school.
[33:53.960 --> 33:56.960]  We can't go to church.
[33:56.960 --> 33:58.960]  But the border is wide open.
[33:58.960 --> 34:01.960]  And illegal immigrants can house in these shelters.
[34:01.960 --> 34:03.960]  And illegal immigrants can house in hotels,
[34:03.960 --> 34:05.960]  even if they test positive for COVID
[34:05.960 --> 34:07.960]  and move about the country.
[34:07.960 --> 34:11.960]  And the youth that comes across the border illegally,
[34:11.960 --> 34:15.960]  they can have in-person learning.
[34:15.960 --> 34:17.960]  Hmm.
[34:17.960 --> 34:20.960]  A country totally shut down
[34:20.960 --> 34:22.960]  unless you're an illegal immigrant,
[34:22.960 --> 34:24.960]  then you have all the rights.
[34:24.960 --> 34:27.960]  And you get free stuff.
[34:27.960 --> 34:29.960]  But the Biden administration
[34:29.960 --> 34:32.960]  that promised you $2,000 stimulus checks,
[34:32.960 --> 34:35.960]  hmm, they lied about that. You never got that.
[34:35.960 --> 34:40.960]  But believe me, that money, that's going somewhere.
[34:40.960 --> 34:43.960]  That's going to facilitate
[34:43.960 --> 34:47.960]  the illegal immigration pipeline
[34:47.960 --> 34:54.960]  promoted, facilitated by the Biden administration.
[34:54.960 --> 34:58.960]  And now you have
[34:58.960 --> 35:03.960]  northern border crossings escalating.
[35:03.960 --> 35:05.960]  And that story is on the Gateway Pundit.
[35:05.960 --> 35:07.960]  So the word is out.
[35:07.960 --> 35:09.960]  The United States is wide open.
[35:09.960 --> 35:11.960]  No borders, free stuff.
[35:11.960 --> 35:14.960]  Come on in.
[35:14.960 --> 35:18.960]  And you'll have all the cover in the world.
[35:18.960 --> 35:21.960]  And you'll have security detail to protect you
[35:21.960 --> 35:25.960]  from even having to deal with a pesky American
[35:25.960 --> 35:28.960]  that may want to talk about it or ask some questions
[35:28.960 --> 35:31.960]  or film it and report on it so that the world
[35:31.960 --> 35:34.960]  or that the country can see.
[35:34.960 --> 35:37.960]  They don't want you to know about their criminal activity.
[35:37.960 --> 35:41.960]  And the good lapdog media
[35:41.960 --> 35:43.960]  stands across the street like good slaves,
[35:43.960 --> 35:46.960]  not asking any questions.
[35:46.960 --> 35:48.960]  Hell, they're not even doing reports.
[35:48.960 --> 35:52.960]  They're just sitting out there, maybe getting some b-roll.
[35:52.960 --> 35:56.960]  But you, an American, you're shut down.
[35:56.960 --> 35:57.960]  You're suffering.
[35:57.960 --> 35:58.960]  You can't get to work.
[35:58.960 --> 36:00.960]  You can't take the kids to school.
[36:00.960 --> 36:02.960]  Go to church.
[36:02.960 --> 36:03.960]  You had it all wrong.
[36:03.960 --> 36:05.960]  You should have come across the southern border illegally.
[36:05.960 --> 36:06.960]  Forget about that.
[36:06.960 --> 36:09.960]  Take your family illegally crossing to Mexico
[36:09.960 --> 36:11.960]  and then illegally crossing the United States
[36:11.960 --> 36:12.960]  and you'll get food.
[36:12.960 --> 36:13.960]  You'll get clothes.
[36:13.960 --> 36:14.960]  You'll get shelter.
[36:14.960 --> 36:15.960]  You'll get security.
[36:15.960 --> 36:18.960]  You'll get everything you need.
[36:18.960 --> 36:20.960]  By the way, there was just another shooter
[36:20.960 --> 36:22.960]  on a Fort today, Fort Detrick.
[36:22.960 --> 36:24.960]  It's already been neutralized.
[36:24.960 --> 36:29.960]  But you know, plenty of security here, though.
[36:29.960 --> 36:32.960]  I bet you a mass shooter couldn't get into that facility.
[36:32.960 --> 36:34.960]  So plenty of security there.
[36:34.960 --> 36:35.960]  Don't worry about that.
[36:35.960 --> 36:36.960]  Plenty of food.
[36:36.960 --> 36:37.960]  Everything's good.
[36:37.960 --> 36:42.960]  It's all free of charge for the illegal immigrants.
[36:42.960 --> 36:45.960]  Open crime being committed.
[36:45.960 --> 36:49.960]  I mean, imagine, yeah, that was footage from last night
[36:49.960 --> 36:52.960]  shot by the true Texas Patriots.
[36:52.960 --> 36:53.960]  There's a compilation of this.
[36:53.960 --> 36:56.960]  Just all night it's happening.
[36:56.960 --> 36:58.960]  And this is the wee hours of the night.
[36:58.960 --> 37:03.960]  That's why you see the flashing yellows on the streets.
[37:03.960 --> 37:05.960]  Because this is late, late night.
[37:05.960 --> 37:07.960]  And you can see them being waved on,
[37:07.960 --> 37:10.960]  being moved about from bus stop to Catholic Charity,
[37:10.960 --> 37:14.960]  from Catholic Charity to bus stop.
[37:14.960 --> 37:16.960]  All illegal immigrants.
[37:16.960 --> 37:18.960]  And most of them don't even have a clue what's going on.
[37:18.960 --> 37:19.960]  They don't speak English.
[37:19.960 --> 37:22.960]  They're just doing what they're told.
[37:22.960 --> 37:24.960]  And they just wanted to come to the United States.
[37:24.960 --> 37:27.960]  Maybe they got family here, friends here.
[37:27.960 --> 37:31.960]  So they now know they're smart enough to know.
[37:31.960 --> 37:33.960]  All right, well, I can head to the United States
[37:33.960 --> 37:35.960]  and I can get the entire trip paid for,
[37:35.960 --> 37:37.960]  probably to make a little profit.
[37:37.960 --> 37:40.960]  I get some clothes on my back, some clothes on my children's back.
[37:40.960 --> 37:43.960]  I can feed myself and my family three times a day.
[37:43.960 --> 37:45.960]  I can get free transportation.
[37:45.960 --> 37:48.960]  And eventually I'll get to where I want to go and I'll be set.
[37:48.960 --> 37:52.960]  And I'll be in America then.
[37:52.960 --> 37:57.960]  But imagine if I decided, hey, I'm going to build a facility here.
[37:57.960 --> 38:00.960]  We'll call it a stash house.
[38:00.960 --> 38:04.960]  Like the stash houses that Border Patrol is busting up every day now.
[38:04.960 --> 38:10.960]  Imagine if I had a stash house and I was facilitating illegal immigrants
[38:10.960 --> 38:13.960]  in and out of this stash house every day by the thousands.
[38:13.960 --> 38:17.960]  Well, see, I would be arrested. That would be a crime.
[38:17.960 --> 38:19.960]  That would be a felony.
[38:19.960 --> 38:22.960]  Oh, but if the government does it,
[38:22.960 --> 38:25.960]  if the Biden administration does it, then it's good,
[38:25.960 --> 38:29.960]  then it's virtuous, then it's allowed.
[38:29.960 --> 38:33.960]  So it's not just that noncitizens have more rights than you.
[38:33.960 --> 38:37.960]  The government now has more rights than you.
[38:37.960 --> 38:42.960]  So the American citizen is now oppressed by its own government.
[38:42.960 --> 38:47.960]  Just in the unequal treatment from the noncitizens or to the noncitizens
[38:47.960 --> 38:52.960]  and the fact that you're getting shut down for a fake pandemic.
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.960]  But so it's now all about training the U.S. citizen to be treated
[38:57.960 --> 39:01.960]  like a second class citizen, training the U.S. citizen that your dog meat,
[39:01.960 --> 39:04.960]  your nothing, your trash, your garbage.
[39:04.960 --> 39:08.960]  Your only job here is to fund all the criminal activity of the Biden administration.
[39:08.960 --> 39:11.960]  Your only job here is to do what you're told.
[39:11.960 --> 39:13.960]  Shelter during a pandemic.
[39:13.960 --> 39:15.960]  Get a vaccine when it's your turn.
[39:15.960 --> 39:18.960]  Sit down, shut up, fund the illegal immigration.
[39:18.960 --> 39:20.960]  Don't turn your cameras on and film it.
[39:20.960 --> 39:21.960]  Don't report on it.
[39:21.960 --> 39:22.960]  Don't talk about it on the Internet.
[39:22.960 --> 39:24.960]  Don't talk about the vaccine side effects.
[39:24.960 --> 39:26.960]  Shut up.
[39:26.960 --> 39:31.960]  That's what the American citizen is told to do.
[39:31.960 --> 39:35.960]  But you want to come across that southern border?
[39:35.960 --> 39:37.960]  Oh, you get everything handed to you.
[39:37.960 --> 39:44.960]  You get treated like royalty and we're just supposed to sit here and take it.
[39:44.960 --> 39:45.960]  And you watch.
[39:45.960 --> 39:47.960]  There'll be people that write hit pieces about Alex Jones.
[39:47.960 --> 39:52.960]  You know, Alex Jones goes down to the border and harasses Border Patrol harasses.
[39:52.960 --> 39:56.960]  They're running criminal operations.
[39:56.960 --> 40:01.960]  Complain all you want about Alex Jones or his antics or loud voice or whatever.
[40:01.960 --> 40:05.960]  He's not the one committing the crimes.
[40:05.960 --> 40:08.960]  So you become so focused on your hatred.
[40:08.960 --> 40:10.960]  Your hatred drives you.
[40:10.960 --> 40:12.960]  Your hatred for people that tell the truth.
[40:12.960 --> 40:16.960]  Your hatred for people with a certain skin color.
[40:16.960 --> 40:20.960]  Your hatred for people with a certain political belief or religious belief.
[40:20.960 --> 40:22.960]  Your hatred fuels you.
[40:22.960 --> 40:30.960]  So you see Alex Jones down there reporting, talking about the illegal operation and that drives you insane.
[40:30.960 --> 40:40.960]  But not the actual criminal activity facilitating child sex trafficking, child rape, illegal immigration, pipelines, coyotes, human smuggling, drug running, gun running.
[40:40.960 --> 40:44.960]  All of it at the taxpayers expense to the tune of billions of dollars.
[40:44.960 --> 40:56.960]  You have no problem with that because you're a liar and a fraud and you identify as a progressive Democrat liberal, which is really translated in reality a liar.
[40:56.960 --> 40:59.960]  The equation is very simple.
[40:59.960 --> 41:01.960]  The mega banks control the media.
[41:01.960 --> 41:03.960]  They control big pharma.
[41:03.960 --> 41:05.960]  They control academia.
[41:05.960 --> 41:08.960]  They control the military, industrial complex.
[41:08.960 --> 41:10.960]  They control big tech.
[41:10.960 --> 41:19.960]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[41:19.960 --> 41:27.960]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[41:27.960 --> 41:43.960]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt and turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopoly of control.
[41:43.960 --> 41:48.960]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the key to defeating them.
[41:48.960 --> 41:53.960]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[41:53.960 --> 41:58.960]  So redouble your efforts. We're all in this together.
[42:23.960 --> 42:28.960]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[42:28.960 --> 42:57.960]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[42:57.960 --> 43:00.960]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[43:00.960 --> 43:03.960]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war and famine.
[43:03.960 --> 43:10.960]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our family's sakes, but also our community.
[43:10.960 --> 43:17.960]  And citizensstronghold.com is the best place to go to get high quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.
[43:17.960 --> 43:21.960]  Again, this is high quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.
[43:21.960 --> 43:25.960]  We've worked with them for years, but they can never supply enough to our audience.
[43:25.960 --> 43:27.960]  They have massively expanded their factories.
[43:27.960 --> 43:31.960]  It's made right here in America and they're ready to ship it to you right now.
[43:31.960 --> 43:33.960]  Citizensstronghold.com.
[43:33.960 --> 43:37.960]  When you go there, put in promo code ALIX and get 10% off on your purchases.
[43:37.960 --> 43:40.960]  They have it for children, they have it for women, they have it for men.
[43:40.960 --> 43:43.960]  They have bat packs that didn't unfold and are full top body armor.
[43:43.960 --> 43:47.960]  They've got it all right now ready to ship to you 10% off.
[43:47.960 --> 43:51.960]  And the globalists are coming to try to stop the sale of it soon.
[43:51.960 --> 43:57.960]  That's why you need to get it now at citizensstronghold.com promo code ALIX and get 10% off.
[43:57.960 --> 44:05.960]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[44:05.960 --> 44:13.960]  And they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[44:13.960 --> 44:16.960]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[44:16.960 --> 44:21.960]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers
[44:21.960 --> 44:25.960]  or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[44:25.960 --> 44:32.960]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the lowest price
[44:32.960 --> 44:38.960]  and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war.
[44:38.960 --> 44:43.960]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them.
[44:43.960 --> 44:50.960]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[44:50.960 --> 44:54.960]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there.
[44:54.960 --> 45:18.960]  infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[45:24.960 --> 45:35.960]  We're back here in the info wars world headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[45:35.960 --> 45:39.960]  This is the Alex Jones show on Shroyer sitting in for Alex today.
[45:39.960 --> 45:46.960]  We'll be hearing from Alex at the border throughout the broadcast.
[45:46.960 --> 45:48.960]  There's a lot developing right now.
[45:48.960 --> 45:53.960]  The new world order is turning out its medical tyranny.
[45:53.960 --> 46:01.960]  The good news is citizens of earth are pushing back and they know the whole thing was a scam.
[46:01.960 --> 46:07.960]  Except for those that are brainwashed and have bought into the scam, they're more brainwashed than ever.
[46:07.960 --> 46:16.960]  They're having psychotic breakdowns like kicking people off an airplane for a two year old that's eating yogurt without a mask on
[46:16.960 --> 46:26.960]  or having hysterical psychotic mental breakdowns and elevators because the person in the elevator with you has the mask slipped beneath their nose.
[46:26.960 --> 46:40.960]  These are the final deranged behaviors of mentally ill people that are having complete psychotic breakdowns.
[46:40.960 --> 46:51.960]  Their behavior is only going to get more erratic and more insane as the new world order tyranny continues to unveil itself and we continue to push back against it.
[46:51.960 --> 47:06.960]  They continue to buy into it with their Stockholm syndrome and any form of resistance that they witness is like poison to them.
[47:06.960 --> 47:25.960]  But there is a pushback, there is an awakening and what to do with the brainwashed sheep is going to become somewhat of a debate as they descent into slavery and tyranny
[47:25.960 --> 47:39.960]  and we ascend into human liberty, freedom, spiritual liberty and common sense really more than anything.
[47:39.960 --> 47:52.960]  But it's tough, it's tough when your fellow man, it's tough when your fellow human is buying into all of it.
[47:52.960 --> 47:57.960]  You want to help them, you want to show them the truth and they're just not interested.
[47:57.960 --> 48:09.960]  And then they get their confirmation bias affirmed by Big Brother, by Big Tech with the censorship of all the ideas that they don't like.
[48:09.960 --> 48:13.960]  And they feel good that the southern border is wide open.
[48:13.960 --> 48:17.960]  They don't care that it's completely unfair to American citizens at the very least,
[48:17.960 --> 48:27.960]  not to mention the criminal activity of human smuggling and child sex trafficking that's happening that they're facilitating and cheering on.
[48:27.960 --> 48:43.960]  These are the final waning moments of an insane sect of society that is moments away from having complete psychotic breakdowns.
[48:43.960 --> 48:58.960]  And part of the wing of this, part of a feather of this wing is groups like Black Lives Matter that are now issuing terroristic threats
[48:58.960 --> 49:06.960]  that they will burn Minneapolis, Minnesota to the ground if Chauvin is not convicted.
[49:06.960 --> 49:09.960]  That is a terrorist threat.
[49:09.960 --> 49:13.960]  But Black Lives Matter has been getting away with terrorist activity for years now.
[49:13.960 --> 49:16.960]  Why would it stop now?
[49:16.960 --> 49:22.960]  No, it only gets worse.
[49:22.960 --> 49:29.960]  And it won't matter that George Floyd was going to die from a heart attack
[49:29.960 --> 49:40.960]  or George Floyd was going to die from a drug overdose or the fact now that we have alternative angles from the incident
[49:40.960 --> 49:48.960]  and Chauvin's knee was never even on Floyd's neck, which confirms the findings of the autopsy.
[49:48.960 --> 49:50.960]  No, that doesn't matter to Black Lives Matter.
[49:50.960 --> 49:53.960]  They said the city will burn.
[49:53.960 --> 49:55.960]  We want that white cop dead.
[49:55.960 --> 49:58.960]  We want that cop dead or this city burns.
[49:58.960 --> 50:00.960]  Don't you understand? We're terrorists.
[50:00.960 --> 50:03.960]  Don't you understand? We're criminals.
[50:03.960 --> 50:10.960]  And don't you understand that the Democrat Party and the media funds us and promotes us?
[50:10.960 --> 50:22.960]  So yeah, these images that you're seeing right here from the first George Floyd riots, the first Democrat riots, the first CNN riots.
[50:22.960 --> 50:23.960]  What do you do if you're a jury?
[50:23.960 --> 50:38.960]  What do you do if you're a judge and you know that terrorists will burn a city to the ground if you don't give them what they want, which is not justice?
[50:38.960 --> 50:42.960]  No, it's not justice.
[50:42.960 --> 50:46.960]  When they say justice, they lie.
[50:46.960 --> 50:52.960]  I'm not really sure what a fair punishment for Chauvin would be or if he deserves any punishment.
[50:52.960 --> 50:54.960]  We've all been so convoluted.
[50:54.960 --> 51:01.960]  We've all had to sit there and watch the video that the media wanted us to have Floyd dying and stare into his eyes.
[51:01.960 --> 51:04.960]  It was all by design.
[51:04.960 --> 51:06.960]  It was all by design.
[51:06.960 --> 51:09.960]  Divide and conquer.
[51:09.960 --> 51:17.960]  And instigate a group of people that have now been turned into terrorists threatening to burn Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota to the ground.
[51:17.960 --> 51:19.960]  And it won't just be Minneapolis.
[51:19.960 --> 51:22.960]  That'll be the start. It'll be all major Democrat cities.
[51:22.960 --> 51:29.960]  It'll be LA, it'll be New York, it'll be Chicago, maybe a little bit in Austin, maybe a little bit in Dallas.
[51:29.960 --> 51:34.960]  Meanwhile, though, where's the story on Ashley Babbitt?
[51:34.960 --> 51:39.960]  Who murdered Ashley Babbitt?
[51:39.960 --> 51:46.960]  No names, no images, no explanation, no court dates, no big trials, no big media coverage.
[51:46.960 --> 51:49.960]  What about Ashley Babbitt?
[51:49.960 --> 51:57.960]  Unarmed, murdered, executed, point and lake range. Everybody saw it.
[51:57.960 --> 52:00.960]  Media doesn't care.
[52:00.960 --> 52:02.960]  Politicians don't care.
[52:02.960 --> 52:05.960]  We don't get to know the name of her killer.
[52:05.960 --> 52:08.960]  We don't get to know who he works for, who told him to do it.
[52:08.960 --> 52:10.960]  Nope, that gets covered up.
[52:10.960 --> 52:12.960]  That gets pushed under the rug.
[52:12.960 --> 52:25.960]  George Floyd, a lifetime criminal, a lifetime crackhead, 90% artery blockage, overdosed on three different street drugs,
[52:25.960 --> 52:35.960]  autopsy said he died from a drug overdose, never had any physical damage to his neck or breathing areas.
[52:35.960 --> 52:37.960]  That doesn't matter to the media.
[52:37.960 --> 52:39.960]  That doesn't matter to the Democrat Party.
[52:39.960 --> 52:41.960]  That doesn't matter to Black Lives Matter.
[52:41.960 --> 52:46.960]  That George Floyd is Black, they're racists, and they want to burn the city to the ground.
[52:46.960 --> 52:51.960]  That's what matters to them.
[52:51.960 --> 52:53.960]  And so in all likelihood, they'll get what they want.
[52:53.960 --> 53:04.960]  Now, I don't know what Chauvin's fate is going to be, but I know what the fate of Minneapolis is going to be.
[53:04.960 --> 53:07.960]  It will burn.
[53:07.960 --> 53:17.960]  Democrat, CNN, MSNBC, riots, and terrorism will commence.
[53:17.960 --> 53:28.960]  Now, this jury could already be so corrupted that they may actually put Chauvin in jail
[53:28.960 --> 53:34.960]  and say he murdered George Floyd, despite all the evidence to the contrary.
[53:34.960 --> 53:47.960]  Or will it go like the Officer Wilson case with Michael Brown, where the jury of all Black people decided that no, hands up, don't shoot, never happened,
[53:47.960 --> 53:58.960]  and Officer Darren Wilson did what he had to do to defend himself and his community.
[53:58.960 --> 54:06.960]  But this will be the breakdown of civilization. The Democrats and their cohorts in the media want it.
[54:06.960 --> 54:14.960]  And the police have basically just been turned into a target for the Democrats, for the media,
[54:14.960 --> 54:21.960]  and now all the Democrat-run cities are a target for Black Lives Matter and Antifa to burn to the ground.
[54:21.960 --> 54:28.960]  So whether it's Portland or whether it's Minneapolis or whether it's Kenosha,
[54:28.960 --> 54:37.960]  as soon as the Democrats and the left see an opportunity for terrorist activity, they seize it, and they burn, and they riot,
[54:37.960 --> 54:45.960]  and they loot, and they terrorize, and they murder, and the media covers all of it up.
[54:45.960 --> 54:52.960]  But when millions of people are in DC fighting the big government corruption, the actual government corruption at our nation's capital,
[54:52.960 --> 55:02.960]  that's the biggest crime ever, even though four Trump supporters died and police executed one of them, a lady, unarmed, nobody blinks an eye, nobody cares.
[55:02.960 --> 55:10.960]  This is the insane times that we live in, ladies and gentlemen. Only God can help us now.
[55:10.960 --> 55:16.960]  But no one else will tell it like Infowars. That's why it's imperative for us to be on air, ladies and gentlemen.

[56:42.960 --> 56:54.960]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[56:54.960 --> 57:03.960]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[57:03.960 --> 57:14.960]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque,
[57:14.960 --> 57:20.960]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[57:20.960 --> 57:31.960]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[57:31.960 --> 57:40.960]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[57:40.960 --> 58:05.960]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[58:10.960 --> 58:30.960]  One of the objectives that has dug deep into the fabric of America is that of the Marxist Frankfurt School adherents that fled Hitler in the 1920s to the west
[58:30.960 --> 58:43.960]  and have managed to subvert every aspect of American culture over its 100-year cancerous occupation to gradually foment an unreliable legal system with bias against victims of crime.
[58:43.960 --> 58:49.960]  Fast forward to March 2021, and the Derek Chauvin trial is the main event.
[58:49.960 --> 59:05.960]  One percent of Minneapolis' sworn strength is on leave tonight as it stands. Minnesota Public Safety officials expect that the total cost for securing the Chauvin trial will reach somewhere around $35 million.
[59:05.960 --> 59:12.960]  Governor Tim Walz wants the state to pick up the tab, but Republicans say it should be up to the city of Minneapolis.
[59:12.960 --> 59:18.960]  As the trial of Derek Chauvin presses forward, pressing decisions are going to be made on Glimwood Avenue, too.
[59:18.960 --> 59:22.960]  What are your fears, worries, anxieties?
[59:22.960 --> 59:28.960]  My fear is that things are going to be destroyed again.
[59:28.960 --> 59:40.960]  If this trial ends up with the acquittal of Derek Chauvin, then it shows that and it will show America and it will show the world that in fact black lives don't matter when it comes to the police.
[59:40.960 --> 59:50.960]  A grenade placed against a Minnesota judicial system under the imminent threat of irrational Marxist thugs salivating to burn their community to the ground.
[59:50.960 --> 1:00:08.960]  In Austin, Texas, the madness of the children of Marxism was on full display as a man is violently assaulted for merely trying to walk his apparently out-of-commission motorcycle in their presence, as the George Floyd mob arrogantly grows across the United States.
[1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:14.960]  What do I want it? No! What do I want it? No!
[1:00:14.960 --> 1:00:24.960]  Also tonight, developing news out of Grand Rapids, a protest ending with police making several arrests as demonstrators clashed with officers.
[1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:31.960]  Tonight's protest coincides with the beginning of the trial of Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer charged in the death of George Floyd.
[1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:49.960]  And as the tension brews outside the three block radius of fencing and the what could amount to the largest domestic deployment in Minnesota National Guard history for the second year in a row, the Derek Chauvin trial has already been a display of metaphors and emotions versus facts.
[1:00:49.960 --> 1:01:04.960]  I don't believe you. I don't believe you, man. Mr. McGon, can you give me a minute?
[1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:12.960]  We're outside the hearing of the jury and Ms. Hanson, I'm advising you. Do not argue with counsel and specifically do not argue with the court.
[1:01:12.960 --> 1:01:15.960]  Is it the camera, though? Are the cameras on?
[1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:23.960]  We're on the record. Okay. You will not argue with the court. You will not argue with counsel. They have the right to ask questions. Your job is to answer them.
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:26.960]  I was finishing my answer.
[1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:29.960]  I will determine when your answer is done. Okay, well.
[1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:33.960]  And so do not argue with the court. Do not argue with counsel.
[1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:49.960]  New documents filed in the George Floyd case give new information about the medical examiner's findings in Floyd's autopsy. Handwritten notes of a law enforcement interview with Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hemp and County Medical Examiner say Floyd had 11 nanograms per milliliter of fentanyl in his system.
[1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:59.960]  Quote, if he were found dead at home alone and no other apparent causes, this could be acceptable to call an OD. Deaths have been certified with levels of three.
[1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:10.960]  And if you think this is a fair and objective trial, look no further than the witnesses and potential jurors having all expressed unavoidable threats to their lives.
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:20.960]  Whatever happens from here until the verdict is read is another tragic chapter in the decline of America under the boot of a cresting Marxist subversion.
[1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:30.960]  John bound reporting. So the question here is when do we want to get serious?
[1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:42.960]  When do we want to stop dealing with insane political correctness, stop looking around the corner for racism and stop censoring free speech and just be honest about what's happening here.
[1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:50.960]  The Democrat Party and the mainstream media is the biggest terrorist hate group in America today.
[1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:54.960]  That's the reality. We deal with it or we see what happens.
[1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:59.960]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[1:02:59.960 --> 1:03:04.960]  People ask me all the time, they go, Joe, are you on cocaine? Are you on meth? How are you so excited?
[1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:07.960]  How do I not get excited about world government?
[1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:13.960]  How do I force mass, force inoculations, open announcements that our country is going to be dissolved?
[1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:18.960]  I'm sorry. I'm a fighter. And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:23.960]  And so I'll just say this. I try to be calm. I try to be focused.
[1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:27.960]  And I don't know what I do. I wasn't still on air right now.
[1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:35.960]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air because you have to realize when I tell you that you're the infomer, that's not me patting on the head.
[1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:39.960]  You are 99% of the equation.
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:43.960]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products, infowarstore.com,
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:47.960]  when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:52.960]  So you are the info war. Thank you so much for the fight. Thank you for all you've done.
[1:03:52.960 --> 1:04:05.960]  Now let's take action together and take down the globalists.
[1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:18.960]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:29.960]  All right, folks, we've just been given permission to go through the border wall by the company that owns the private land here between the border wall and the river, the actual border of Mexico.
[1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:38.960]  So we're going to go and drive down to the river to show just how easy it is under the Biden administration to get into the United States of America.
[1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:47.960]  Now, we just saw an article by Biden saying that they are considering fixing the gaps in the border wall.
[1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:52.960]  That's smoking mirror, folks. It doesn't matter. They could close the wall completely.
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:59.960]  But the fact is that Biden is allowing migrants with children to come into the United States.
[1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:14.960]  He's funding it. He's assisting it with the help of the endeavor group that's probably funded by Soros and other rich Democrats to sit there and give these illegals $1,200 debit cards
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:21.960]  a free plane ticket in first class to fly to the destination city of their choice.
[1:05:21.960 --> 1:05:26.960]  And then it came just to be clear, it came out, Lou Dobbs even exposed it, got in a lot of trouble for it.
[1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:33.960]  But Soros was in Reuters three years ago saying they get $1,200 on these debit cards to people and that through UNICEF and the UN they're running it.
[1:05:33.960 --> 1:05:44.960]  Trump ended that UNESCO plan where we had unofficially joined a treaty back under actually George W. Bush to let the UN direct who could come into the U.S.
[1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:50.960]  So it was actually the UN was in control of that. Just like when you see the invasions of the Muslims of Europe, that is all run by that.
[1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:55.960]  So yes, when you say probably by Soros, I mean currently, yes, that is going on. Currently that's happening.
[1:05:55.960 --> 1:05:59.960]  But now it's direct taxpayer money for the giant facilities they're expanding down here.
[1:05:59.960 --> 1:06:07.960]  Yeah, absolutely. And we know that Biden, the Biden administration just awarded an $86 million contract to ICE to buy out all the hotel rooms down there.
[1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:13.960]  Well, I mean they just, he told them, surged the border and just yesterday said you have a lot of courage. Good job.
[1:06:13.960 --> 1:06:19.960]  That's exactly right. And here's one of the gaps we're talking about in the border right there. If you look to your right right there, you can see the gap.
[1:06:19.960 --> 1:06:25.960]  Okay. Literally a child could come across this border unassisted actually.
[1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:31.960]  And we're going to show you just how easy it is. Like I said, we're doing this with permission of the landowner.
[1:06:31.960 --> 1:06:36.960]  And remember, we're all supposed to wear masks. We're supposed to follow all these laws.
[1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:41.960]  But the FBI, quote, wave the rules so that people working at these facilities have to have background checks.
[1:06:41.960 --> 1:06:46.960]  That is so criminals can come in and out. And you guys are experts at this. You're from the State Department.
[1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:52.960]  We've noticed when they come in, they don't even check IDs. They just write who they are on a clipboard.
[1:06:52.960 --> 1:06:55.960]  They don't even check who they are going to the facility with thousands of children.
[1:06:55.960 --> 1:07:02.960]  That's exactly right. When we were at the Donna facility just a few short minutes ago, we literally watched someone drive up to the guard and say,
[1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:10.960]  I'm with Allied. And the guard goes, oh, okay, and just waved them through. There was no ID check. There was no, no accountability whatsoever.
[1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:14.960]  And they're allowing them access in the facilities where these children are kept.
[1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:23.960]  And we know for a fact from talking to some of the Border Patrol and ICE agents that children in these facilities have been raped by adults.
[1:07:23.960 --> 1:07:27.960]  Dave, rate this week this week in that facility, in that Donna facility.
[1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:31.960]  We talked to a lady in law enforcement. Leave it at that and said it's unbelievable.
[1:07:31.960 --> 1:07:39.960]  It's unbelievable. She's actually considering resigning from her job because she said she can't stand by and witness what she's seen being done to the kids
[1:07:39.960 --> 1:07:45.960]  and what the kids are doing to each other. And they're acting out. I'll explain. They've all been raped, so they're doing stuff.
[1:07:45.960 --> 1:07:53.960]  They've had a long journey and these cartels and some of the adults who are not their parents who are traveling with them just for a free ticket into the U.S.
[1:07:53.960 --> 1:07:57.960]  They're sexually exploiting these kids along the journey.
[1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:03.960]  The State Department, the U.N., all of them, and I agree with the assessment, 80% of these girls have been raped.
[1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:12.960]  They've been raped, and so when they get to these facilities, they act out on that behavior and they rape other children or they masturbate openly.
[1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:14.960]  Like I said, ICE agents have told us this.
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:22.960]  To hell with you, a lot of them are. They're not Mexican. These are Guatemala street kids from Guatemala City who have been huffing glue, paint.
[1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:27.960]  They basically make Mowgli look like a saint from the Jungle Book, and so they're like equivalent 30-year-old drug addicts.
[1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:31.960]  They're 17, 18. That's just what their IDs say, literally raping babies.
[1:08:31.960 --> 1:08:36.960]  Right, and they're literally just taking babies from these foreign countries and bringing them across.
[1:08:36.960 --> 1:08:37.960]  As a football.
[1:08:37.960 --> 1:08:46.960]  That's exactly right. It's like carrying a football over the touchdown line to score that touchdown, to score that free pass into the United States of America.
[1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:50.960]  All right, we're up here to the levee. We're up here to the dam, and we can keep going.
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:52.960]  I don't know why we're not keeping going.
[1:08:52.960 --> 1:08:56.960]  We're going to get out real quick. I think he's just checking out to see what the road looks like.
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:08:57.960]  All right, here we go.
[1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:03.960]  Hey, they let us in. Let's do it. We're on the border. Let's not go to Mexico.
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:17.960]  Give me an example. You go to Big Bend. The Park Rangers harass the hell out of you when you even get by the Rio Grande until you shouldn't be there.
[1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:23.960]  But here it's just completely wide open, and the cops are all very, very nice, and have been on our side. They all are absolutely outraged.
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:32.960]  We're not going to say who we've met with, but we've talked to, let's just say the highest level law enforcement around here is very upset about what's happening and said, you know, they're 100% behind us.
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:42.960]  That's exactly right. I can't even say how many police officers have come up to us off the record and say, we're so thankful you're here. We're so thankful you're exposing this.
[1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:48.960]  The people need to know this because we're being overrun. We're literally being overrun.
[1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:50.960]  So you probably can see the river.
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:57.960]  That's right there. We walk right there. We can probably see the river if you want to walk over there. Absolutely. We want to radio them and this is a good spot right here or maybe.
[1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:01.960]  Hey guys, we're going to pull over right here so we can see the river from right here.
[1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:04.960]  That is the river. Yeah.
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:11.960]  There it is right there.
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:13.960]  But if they want to keep going forward, I guess we can.
[1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:20.960]  Let's go check it out and then around the point.
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:30.960]  So look right here. That's the Rio Grande, right? That's the border. Okay.
[1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:36.960]  So currently the way it's set up, anybody could take a raft, come across the border. Okay.
[1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:39.960]  Now if you look over to this side, there's a little levy right here.
[1:10:39.960 --> 1:10:44.960]  And as we showed you when we were driving, the border wall is about a quarter mile up the road.
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:52.960]  And all the gates to that border wall are completely open without a single border patrol agent at any of the gates.
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:57.960]  And before I've been down there, they're at all the gates. They'll be talking to us. That's who we are.
[1:10:57.960 --> 1:11:02.960]  Now it's just a stand down and they're just giving the kids and told to deliver them to the facilities.
[1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:03.960]  Right.
[1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:09.960]  If you look, you can see right there, footpaths going right down to the river. If you look over there.
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:10.960]  Oh, absolutely. Yeah, right there.
[1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:14.960]  You can see the footpaths going down where they launched the rafts from.
[1:11:17.960 --> 1:11:22.960]  And again, Drew Hernandez has been at the Arizona dexporter a while.
[1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:25.960]  He was coming down this weekend. We ran into him. What do you make of this?
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:31.960]  This is part of the river. This is where the cartels, where the human traffickers, where they pay.
[1:11:31.960 --> 1:11:35.960]  The actual migrants will pay the traffickers to take them across this river.
[1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:38.960]  Right now it looks peaceful, but sometimes this river can be pretty rough.
[1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:43.960]  And the people, I mean, reports last week, a six month old baby was actually thrown into the river.
[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:49.960]  Not the specific location, but these are the types of horrors that are happening here at the southern border.
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:51.960]  And remember that world told me I live in a nanny state.
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:54.960]  Turn our guns out. It's insane.
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:58.960]  Beautiful area down here, though, in its own way.
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:01.960]  You can see the footpaths over there. I'm going to get you out of this.
[1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:09.960]  The armored truck has been on some real adventures.
[1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:11.960]  Oh, yeah, you can see.
[1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:13.960]  Come on, activity over there.
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:20.960]  Let's drop on down and see some more of it.
[1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:25.960]  So that is Alex Jones reporting from the border, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:32.960]  And if you want to know just how ahead of the game info wars has been and Alex Jones has been.

[1:13:57.960 --> 1:13:59.960]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:16.960]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld, but big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the chai comms especially are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data.
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:20.960]  They can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:28.960]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover in their own words.
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:29.960]  They admit it.
[1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:33.960]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and block it, pockets and things like that for more than a decade.

[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:38.960]  They just look like a cloth envelope.

[1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:27.960]  Global tyranny is a foot.
[1:16:27.960 --> 1:16:33.960]  The infrastructure has been built, the battle plan laid out and it is now being executed.
[1:16:33.960 --> 1:16:39.960]  And the only path to victory begins with resistance.
[1:16:39.960 --> 1:16:42.960]  But first we need understanding.
[1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:50.960]  We need acceptance of this reality so that we then can properly prepare for the resistance and the pushback.
[1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:52.960]  And it's beginning to happen right now.
[1:16:52.960 --> 1:17:00.960]  And in many ways, InfoWars has been the alpha, the genesis of the resistance of this pushback.
[1:17:00.960 --> 1:17:07.960]  That's why we've been targeted for censorship off the internet, unlike anyone else that you've seen.
[1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:14.960]  But now that we're a year into this fake pandemic and I get emails from people saying, don't call it fake, Owen.
[1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:16.960]  You're just turning people off.
[1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:17.960]  I got COVID.
[1:17:17.960 --> 1:17:19.960]  I know some people that have gotten COVID.
[1:17:19.960 --> 1:17:21.960]  I never said COVID was fake.
[1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:23.960]  The pandemic is fake.
[1:17:23.960 --> 1:17:26.960]  There is no pandemic.
[1:17:26.960 --> 1:17:36.960]  The death rate in the United States did not go up a single percentage, not even a fraction of a percentage.
[1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:39.960]  It was 1.8 in the year 2019.
[1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:41.960]  It was 1.8 in the year 2020.
[1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:43.960]  It'll be 1.8 in the year 2021.
[1:17:43.960 --> 1:17:50.960]  Unless we actually do all take the vaccines, then it probably will see an uptick to about 1.9, maybe 2%.
[1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:56.960]  And that'll be a nice little victory in Bill Gates and the global eugenesis cause.
[1:17:56.960 --> 1:18:00.960]  But really, they want those numbers to be about 98%.
[1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:05.960]  They want about a 1.8 survival rate.
[1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:09.960]  But that's just the beginning of the understanding.
[1:18:09.960 --> 1:18:15.960]  Then once you have the understanding, the resistance, the pushback begins.
[1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:25.960]  So we are beginning to see this in mass, not just with all the rallies against the masks, all the rallies against the shutdowns, increasing in Europe, increasing in the United States.
[1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:38.960]  New polls are suggesting that nobody's really afraid of COVID at all anymore, except for the complete lunatic fringe out there on the left that just buy anything they see on TV.
[1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:42.960]  Here's a story from infowars.com.
[1:18:42.960 --> 1:18:54.960]  Diners chant, get out, get out at government COVID health enforcers at a restaurant in British Columbia, Canada.
[1:18:54.960 --> 1:19:00.960]  You will see a group of diners chanting for the COVID health officials to get out.
[1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:03.960]  Yes, that's how it's done, just like the pastor.
[1:19:03.960 --> 1:19:07.960]  You stand up, they want to get in your face, you get in their face.
[1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:14.960]  You tell them you're a free citizen of earth, you're not going to live in fear, you're not going to live under global tyranny, take your tyranny elsewhere.
[1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:17.960]  We don't want it here.
[1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:24.960]  And you tell them to get lost, they have no right, you do not consent.
[1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:28.960]  They are Nazis, they are tyrants.
[1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:30.960]  And so here is that video.
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:32.960]  Guys, let's crank up the audio on this real quick.
[1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:58.960]  Here's a story from infowars.com.
[1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:15.960]  Let's bring it up in forever.
[1:20:15.960 --> 1:20:22.960]  Get out bye tyrants, you're not wanted here.
[1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:24.960]  Yes.
[1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:26.960]  Freedom wins, humans win.
[1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:27.960]  Truth wins.
[1:20:27.960 --> 1:20:34.680]  Truth wins, logic wins, and you're going to see more and more of this happening as business
[1:20:34.680 --> 1:20:39.480]  owners stand up, restaurant owners stand up, gym owners stand up, so the trend is just
[1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:40.480]  being set.
[1:20:40.480 --> 1:20:41.480]  The trend is just beginning.
[1:20:41.480 --> 1:20:44.760]  Now, the pushback must commence.
[1:20:44.760 --> 1:20:51.200]  Here's a courageous lady, a stewardess with an airline carrier.
[1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:56.080]  One courageous airline stewardess resigns rather than enforced passenger mask mandates.
[1:20:56.080 --> 1:20:58.080]  Her name is Teresa Mullins.
[1:20:58.080 --> 1:21:01.560]  The story is at GatewayPundit.com.
[1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:04.560]  We salute Teresa.
[1:21:04.560 --> 1:21:07.120]  Here's what we're trying to avoid.
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:09.480]  The well health and safety seal.
[1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:13.840]  Now, you remember, remember, we covered this last week, and it's always being pushed by
[1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:17.040]  Hollywood celebs, the well health and safety seal.
[1:21:17.040 --> 1:21:22.720]  It's all about forced vaccinations, forced masking, and Hollywood celebs telling you
[1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:23.720]  to do it.
[1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:24.720]  They never wear masks.
[1:21:24.720 --> 1:21:25.720]  They never take the vaccines.
[1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:26.720]  They never act.
[1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:27.720]  It's all a big lie.
[1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:33.480]  These are controlled puppets of the New World Order in Hollywood.
[1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:35.440]  They don't want you to have a gun, but they have armed security.
[1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:37.560]  They have walls.
[1:21:37.560 --> 1:21:40.960]  So it now turns out, though, that the well health and safety seal that they're trying
[1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:45.080]  to put on every restaurant in the U.S. to force you to take a vaccine and wear a mask, well,
[1:21:45.080 --> 1:21:53.120]  it turns out that it's run by Chinese communists and has massive ties to the Chinese Communist
[1:21:53.120 --> 1:21:54.120]  Party.
[1:21:54.120 --> 1:21:56.840]  The story is at infowars.com.
[1:21:56.840 --> 1:21:57.840]  Go figure.
[1:21:57.840 --> 1:22:04.560]  Here's another individual standing up, story at infowars.com, police body cam footage shows
[1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:08.680]  man arrested at Disney World for refusing temperature check.
[1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:14.880]  And in the video, he's talking about how he spent $15,000 to be here, and he gets arrested.
[1:22:14.880 --> 1:22:20.560]  He gets arrested at the Boathouse Restaurant at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa.
[1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:25.520]  Chinese Fills, 47, arrested because he refuses a temperature check.
[1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:30.120]  Of course, he had to get his temperature check to go to jail, didn't have a high temperature,
[1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:35.120]  and had $15,000 robbed from him because he wants to be a free citizen.
[1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:36.640]  So you know what?
[1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:37.640]  He knew the cost.
[1:22:37.640 --> 1:22:38.640]  He stood up.
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:42.640]  He did what's right.
[1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:44.040]  Everyone's going to have to do this, folks.
[1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:47.480]  Everyone's going to have to go into discomfort zone to fight against this tyranny.
[1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:53.560]  So let me tell you, the discomfort you're going to experience now is a lot less than
[1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:56.640]  it'll be in the future if you don't stand against it now.
[1:22:56.640 --> 1:22:59.080]  So this man spent a night or a day in jail.
[1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:03.600]  He lost $15,000 because he said, I refuse to be a slave.
[1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:06.120]  I am not consenting to your medical tyranny.
[1:23:06.120 --> 1:23:07.120]  He gets cuffed.
[1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:08.120]  He gets arrested.
[1:23:08.120 --> 1:23:10.280]  He loses his 15 grand.
[1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:16.840]  But see, Americans and people around the world are seeing the reality now that they've been
[1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:18.400]  lied to by the mainstream news.
[1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:21.720]  They've been lied to by their politicians.
[1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:27.120]  Texas COVID case is dropped to record lows after scrapping mask mandate.
[1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:30.840]  And all the data is in this story at nationalfile.com.
[1:23:30.840 --> 1:23:35.440]  Again, we got rid of the mask mandate.
[1:23:35.440 --> 1:23:37.120]  I don't wear the mask anywhere I go.
[1:23:37.120 --> 1:23:38.720]  Nobody says anything to me.
[1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:39.720]  Nobody's getting sick.
[1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:41.400]  No super spreader event.
[1:23:41.400 --> 1:23:43.200]  All lies by the media.
[1:23:43.200 --> 1:23:45.840]  They said, for sure, people in Texas are going to die.
[1:23:45.840 --> 1:23:48.440]  No, you lied again.
[1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:49.440]  You liars.
[1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:51.000]  You lied about COVID.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:52.600]  You're lying about masks.
[1:23:52.600 --> 1:23:54.760]  You're lying about the vaccine.
[1:23:54.760 --> 1:23:56.320]  It's sick.
[1:23:56.320 --> 1:24:00.160]  You'll never stop lying, will you?
[1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:04.000]  And so because we're finally realizing that the media lied and our politicians lied and
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:09.720]  Fauci lied and Gates lied and you all lied.
[1:24:09.720 --> 1:24:10.720]  Americans are realizing this.
[1:24:10.720 --> 1:24:13.080]  People around the world are realizing this.
[1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:15.720]  And so a new poll is out from Gallup.
[1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:21.120]  Americans fear of catching COVID-19 drops to record lows.
[1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:25.360]  Last time they sent the poll out, it was 49 percent worried about getting COVID.
[1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:26.360]  Now it's 35 percent.
[1:24:26.360 --> 1:24:31.000]  Soon it will be 20 percent, then 15 percent, then 10 percent, then 5 percent, then 0 percent
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.680]  because we know you lied.
[1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:34.920]  Fauci lied.
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:35.920]  Gates lied.
[1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:36.920]  The media lied.
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:37.920]  The politicians lied.
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:38.920]  But don't worry.
[1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:40.840]  See, they got something special for you, though.
[1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:47.360]  Bill Gates has something special for you that they'll release that'll be much worse than
[1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:53.280]  whatever they released from the COVID lab if they get away with it, folks.
[1:24:53.280 --> 1:25:00.280]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:01.600]  that this is all a test.
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:07.560]  This experience, this whitelist planet is a reckoning.
[1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:12.840]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out of the third dimension so we can decide
[1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:16.440]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:17.840]  And it really does come down to that.
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:22.200]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:26.480]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:30.080]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:35.720]  God is the author of us having free will, and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[1:25:35.720 --> 1:25:39.880]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington,
[1:25:39.880 --> 1:25:45.240]  D.C., and Fauci, and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:49.200]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:57.240]  you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:25:58.240]  Granny Do Right.
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:25:59.240]  Granny Do Right.
[1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:00.240]  Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:01.240]  Go ahead.
[1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:02.240]  Challenge.
[1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:03.640]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:09.120]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:14.600]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:20.600]  But since taking your X-2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:23.920]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:27.960]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:31.560]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:36.080]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:41.240]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is
[1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:47.720]  wonderful, you know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway,
[1:26:47.720 --> 1:26:53.280]  it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.

[1:27:56.040 --> 1:28:24.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:24.600 --> 1:28:31.280]  More people are waking up to the fact that the COVID pandemic was a giant scam, a scam
[1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:40.400]  demic, a plandemic, but not a pandemic at all. And it may be a dollar short, it may
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:47.400]  be a day late, but the awakening is happening. People are realizing Anthony Fauci is a scumbag
[1:28:47.400 --> 1:28:55.000]  liar, big mouth, big pharmaceutical whore. People are scratching their heads and wondering
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:58.280]  why Bill Gates is considered the most powerful doctor in the world, even though he's not
[1:28:58.280 --> 1:29:06.760]  a doctor at all, and he wants to inject you with his synthetic material and why he owns
[1:29:06.760 --> 1:29:17.520]  060606 patent on things he wants to inject you with. People are beginning to wonder about
[1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:25.320]  this. People are beginning to wonder why the media lied about the pandemic. People are
[1:29:25.320 --> 1:29:28.280]  beginning to wonder, hey, why did they say at least three million would be dead? That
[1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:34.920]  didn't happen. Why are they adding up every death that happens even if you have COVID
[1:29:34.920 --> 1:29:41.400]  as a COVID death? Why are they saying all these deaths are from COVID when it's 87% comorbidities
[1:29:41.400 --> 1:29:44.920]  up to two other diseases that they had when they died, terminal illnesses and other such
[1:29:44.920 --> 1:29:52.320]  things, and 70% of the people that get it are obese. Why are the people wearing masks
[1:29:52.320 --> 1:29:56.600]  getting COVID and the people not wearing masks not getting COVID? Why are we seeing
[1:29:56.600 --> 1:30:05.840]  doctors come out with basically cures for COVID, but they're getting censored and silenced?
[1:30:05.840 --> 1:30:12.400]  Why do we have studies coming out? New studies and old studies saying that the masks become
[1:30:12.400 --> 1:30:17.360]  a petri dish for bacteria and disease. What is going on here? Were we lied to? Were we
[1:30:17.360 --> 1:30:24.440]  tricked? Are our experts morons? The fear of COVID is dropping. Excitement to get back
[1:30:24.440 --> 1:30:33.720]  to normal life is a bound, and it's not about a mask. It's not about a vaccine. It's about
[1:30:33.720 --> 1:30:37.960]  realizing we were duped, realizing we had everything stolen from us, and it's time
[1:30:37.960 --> 1:30:44.440]  to get back to normal. Like yesterday, and I guess I'm in an MLB boycott. I just can't
[1:30:44.440 --> 1:30:50.720]  stomach it anymore. But kudos to the Texas Rangers that had a full stadium yesterday.
[1:30:50.720 --> 1:30:55.000]  I had a couple of friends at the ball game, said it was a great time, a little bit jealous,
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:59.120]  but I think I'll probably boycott the MLB this year. It'll be my first year not going
[1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:03.040]  to a major league baseball game, probably in my life, aside from last year, just because
[1:31:03.040 --> 1:31:13.880]  it was all shut down. But yeah, this is the big lie I'm going to get to. Oh, the private
[1:31:13.880 --> 1:31:18.880]  industry will force the vaccine passports. Not me, says Fauci, says Saki, says Biden.
[1:31:18.880 --> 1:31:23.120]  Well, that's another big lie that they're telling you. So Americans and people around
[1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:27.440]  the world are waking up to the fake pandemic. They're waking up to the criminal activity
[1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:33.680]  of Fauci and Gates in their view, lying to us, lying to us about a pandemic, shutting
[1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:39.400]  down our economy illegally, crashing it. They're getting it now, all the cell you have
[1:31:39.400 --> 1:31:43.160]  vaccine that they're then going to use to control all human activity. People are getting
[1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:49.280]  it. So when people on planet Earth, when the people in the United States of America begin
[1:31:49.280 --> 1:31:56.040]  to wake up and understand an issue better, what happens? Well, the fake news comes to
[1:31:56.040 --> 1:32:02.880]  the rescue. The fake news comes to put you right back in fear, right back in bondage.
[1:32:02.880 --> 1:32:11.360]  So this is CNN's big story today. Michigan's latest coronavirus surge. There's a new kind
[1:32:11.360 --> 1:32:15.640]  of patient. And now it's all about how anybody can get it. Anybody can die from it, even
[1:32:15.640 --> 1:32:21.680]  if you're young and healthy. So people are no longer afraid of COVID. They know the
[1:32:21.680 --> 1:32:28.800]  whole thing was a scam, Demik. And so here comes CNN. Here comes CNN to put you back
[1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:33.400]  into bondage, put you back into fear. So believe me, the people at CNN saw the polls that people
[1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:37.600]  aren't afraid of COVID anymore. They saw the packed stadiums. They saw the packed bars
[1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:43.160]  and restaurants and venues, and they panic. They said, uh-oh, our fake news isn't working.
[1:32:43.160 --> 1:32:47.640]  We're failing the New World Order. What can we do? We have to put Americans back in fear.
[1:32:47.640 --> 1:32:52.840]  We have to tell them to live in fear. We have to tell them to live in bondage. So that's
[1:32:52.840 --> 1:33:02.240]  just what CNN did and will continue to do. And of course, they'll be covering up the
[1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:07.480]  vaccine side effects that Bill Gates gets so giddy about playing Russian roulette with
[1:33:07.480 --> 1:33:18.800]  your body. The vaccine is killing me, said Desiree Penrod in a series of Facebook posts.
[1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:23.120]  The vaccine is killing me today. My arm hurts beyond exhaustive headaches, stomach cramps,
[1:33:23.120 --> 1:33:28.720]  ear aches. Multiple people told me I look pale today. Yesterday, I was fine, but today
[1:33:28.720 --> 1:33:36.560]  it's taking its toll on me. Facebook censored that tweet, excuse me, censored that post
[1:33:36.560 --> 1:33:46.680]  and then Desiree Penrod died after receiving the COVID vaccine. Twenty-five years old today,
[1:33:46.680 --> 1:33:52.960]  a preschool teacher. So she was obviously forced to take the vaccine because she teaches
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:34:02.960]  at a school. She was forced to die. That's just the cost of living in the New World
[1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:11.560]  Order. There's a price to pay. It's a human price. That human might be you. This time,
[1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:18.440]  it was Desiree Penrod. Sometimes it's a nurse. Sometimes it's a nurse's baby. Sometimes it's
[1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:25.760]  a grandma. Sometimes it's Hank Aaron. Sometimes it's Marvin Hagler. Sometimes it's your aunt.
[1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:32.840]  Sometimes it's you. So it is Russian roulette. They know these vaccines are going to kill
[1:34:32.840 --> 1:34:36.920]  people. They know it's going to give people bells, palsy and the rest. And who knows what
[1:34:36.920 --> 1:34:40.760]  the long-term side effects are? They may know. They may not. They may not care. This could
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:45.600]  be the giant trial to find out. But see, that's the cost of living in the New World Order.
[1:34:45.600 --> 1:34:51.440]  That's the cost of having Bill Gates in charge of the World Health Organization and funding
[1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:57.160]  John Hopkins' research and funding the media and sending Fauci out there to put the whole
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:35:01.640]  world in fear of a fake pandemic so they can now come in with their population control
[1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:08.200]  vaccines and kill you deader than a hammer. That's the cost of living in the New World
[1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:16.080]  Order. It's your life. It's your life. And so the new big lie they're telling, and this
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:23.520]  is coming right from the Biden White House, from Fauci and others, the private market
[1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:28.640]  is going to push the vaccine passport. Not the government. Oh, what a giant misnomer.
[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:34.880]  What a lie. So you tell us to be afraid of COVID. You spread the fear porn. You spread
[1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:40.080]  the fear propaganda. You lie about the death numbers. You lie about the infection numbers.
[1:35:40.080 --> 1:35:46.840]  You lie about the positive tests and the positive test rates. You lie about everything. You
[1:35:46.840 --> 1:35:57.640]  lie about everything. And then you dare put the burden on the private sector to take the
[1:35:57.640 --> 1:36:07.280]  blame for forced vaccines and vaccine passports. You dirty rotten scoundrels. Amazing, isn't
[1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:15.160]  it? The biggest perpetrators of the pandemic was not the actual virus or you living in
[1:36:15.160 --> 1:36:18.680]  fear because you're seeing people drop dead and get sick all around you. No, no, no, no.
[1:36:18.680 --> 1:36:23.800]  It was Fauci. It was the Democrats. It was the media. But now that you know it's fake,
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:28.480]  now that you know you've been duped, now that the world is waking up to the giant fake pandemic
[1:36:28.480 --> 1:36:34.560]  scam, New World Order medical tyranny, now they want to put their hands in the air and
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:40.200]  say, well, we're not the ones making you take a vaccine. We're not the ones making the vaccine
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:45.440]  passports a thing. That's not us. We just lied to you about the whole thing. We just
[1:36:45.440 --> 1:36:50.480]  created the environment. We just sold the fear. We just pushed the vaccine. We just did all
[1:36:50.480 --> 1:37:01.080]  of that. But you should take the blame for the tyranny, not us. In a sane world, Anthony
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:08.520]  Fauci would be in jail. In a sane world, we would be holding Nuremberg-style trials for
[1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:17.400]  Bill Gates and his cohorts and the people that ran Event 201 and the people that wanted
[1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:23.880]  to force the vaccine into people's arms that then killed them. We'd be having huge Nuremberg
[1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:31.000]  trials because stories like this are cropping up. Chronic shortages of child's cancer drugs
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:35.160]  force U.S. hospitals to work together. So children are dying of cancer. Adults are dying
[1:37:35.160 --> 1:37:38.120]  of cancer. People are dying from all this other stuff because they can't get access
[1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:43.160]  to the hospitals because they're shut down because of COVID. A giant New World Order
[1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:48.600]  eugenics program, population control, murdering humans on planet Earth right now. We should
[1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:52.440]  be holding Nuremberg trials against these people.
[1:37:52.440 --> 1:37:58.840]  The equation is very simple. The mega banks control the media. They control big pharma.
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:06.000]  They control academia. They control the military, industrial complex. They control big tech.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:10.520]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established
[1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:17.560]  absolute total despotism and dehumanization. It is the Western Christian idea of human
[1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:22.280]  freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:28.520]  threatens them. So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted,
[1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:35.000]  turned it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:40.040]  and the free market that threatens their monopoly, so control. That's why they targeted
[1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:45.000]  info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them. The only way our transmission
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:50.280]  gets out is if you promote info wars and hand out video. So redouble your efforts. We're
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:51.800]  all in this together.
[1:38:51.800 --> 1:38:54.840]  Gerald and South Carolina, go ahead. You're on the air trying to move quicker.
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:56.120]  Hey, Alex. Welcome.
[1:38:56.120 --> 1:39:01.240]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:06.120]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amputee
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:12.680]  and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away. A living defense saved my life.
[1:39:12.680 --> 1:39:18.520]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back.
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:24.440]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:32.200]  Matthew 24 verse nine. Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you
[1:39:32.200 --> 1:39:38.920]  shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray
[1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:44.040]  one another and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at brother. And that's because
[1:39:44.040 --> 1:39:48.280]  God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy
[1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:50.520]  hates it because God created this country.
[1:39:52.920 --> 1:39:57.240]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world. They are creating insecurity,
[1:39:57.240 --> 1:40:03.080]  crime, war and famine. All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready
[1:40:03.080 --> 1:40:08.360]  for ourselves and our family's sakes but also our community. And citizensstronghold.com
[1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:13.320]  is the best place to go to get high quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.

[1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:57.080]  they get 10% off. I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:40:57.080 --> 1:41:01.560]  Hell I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that. But let me tell you
[1:41:01.560 --> 1:41:06.280]  the new world orders breathe them down our neck. The big globalist publications are coming after
[1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:10.760]  us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down. So please pray to keep info wars on the
[1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:15.560]  air and please support the local states you're listening to as well. At the same time go to
[1:41:15.560 --> 1:41:21.880]  infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements
[1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:27.560]  because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing. I need your help
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:32.600]  more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalists but I can't do it if you don't support
[1:41:32.600 --> 1:41:38.280]  us. So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can and buy great
[1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:43.640]  products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com. Whether it's

[1:41:49.160 --> 1:41:53.560]  empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-god. Thank you so much.
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:42:14.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:38.040]  Just about 40 yards behind me is Mexico. That is the famed Rio Grande River right there and so
[1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:41.960]  they call it a pejorative term but that's where the term wetback comes from as people would get in
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:46.520]  the water and then swim across and come over here so they literally had water still in their backs
[1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:51.080]  meaning they were being grabbed at the border of that term turned into a pejorative term but
[1:42:51.080 --> 1:42:56.040]  regardless that's where the term comes from the Rio Grande River right there. Now you've got folks
[1:42:56.040 --> 1:42:59.640]  that live here in America, most of them are American citizens, some go back and forth
[1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:04.120]  into Mexico where they have families who do a great job and there are the agricultural workers
[1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:08.360]  right back there. We'll show you that here in just a few minutes and they just picked a bunch of
[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:13.960]  delicious smelling onions and also a bunch of delicious looking turnips so definitely great
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:21.240]  produce being produced on here but these aren't the people that Obyden and the Obyden administration
[1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:27.240]  has told to search. These are women and children many of which are already being trafficked whose
[1:43:27.240 --> 1:43:33.560]  families owe money to cartels in Central America. These are mainly Guatemalan and South Salvadoran
[1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:37.480]  and others that are now coming in. That's where the Mexican president has come out and said
[1:43:37.480 --> 1:43:41.080]  Biden should stop saying search the border. This is killing a lot of people in Mexico,
[1:43:41.080 --> 1:43:45.320]  a lot of people in the U.S. and a lot of Mexicans are having their children kidnapped
[1:43:45.320 --> 1:43:49.640]  because Saki and others the administration say you got to have a 10-year-old kid or younger
[1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:54.360]  and then we'll give you an envelope full of money debit cards from George Soros of the State
[1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:59.240]  Department and let you fly wherever you want in the U.S. or by bus. That's what is incredibly
[1:43:59.240 --> 1:44:06.760]  criminal and so they started under Obama. It's escalated but this is an incredibly dangerous
[1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:12.040]  area. Thousands and thousands of graves have been found of women and children and adult men
[1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:15.240]  who did not pay the coyotes the full amount. Another thing the coyotes do and it's all over the
[1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:21.240]  news you see this all the time in Texas mainly is they have people inside tractor trailers and if
[1:44:21.240 --> 1:44:25.720]  people back home don't pay the full amount once they get here they got to pay half up front usually
[1:44:25.720 --> 1:44:31.080]  if they refuse to pay or can't pay or if the cartels are fighting with each other they lock
[1:44:31.080 --> 1:44:34.920]  everyone inside the 18-wheelers in the winter to starve to death. During the summer they die
[1:44:34.920 --> 1:44:40.840]  just a few hours of heat exhaustion. You see in reports 10, 15, 20, 30 people found dead sometimes
[1:44:40.840 --> 1:44:45.880]  dozens of others barely alive. That's how evil and wicked these cartels are and it's been estimated
[1:44:45.880 --> 1:44:52.840]  by Amos International and others that 80% of the women before they get across the Rio Grande
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:59.400]  are raped and it goes all the way down the Texas border with Mexico which is the Rio Grande. It
[1:44:59.400 --> 1:45:06.680]  goes right through here right through all the way to Big Bend to El Paso and life has gotten so cheap
[1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:12.440]  in Mexico but you see movies like Machete put out by Robert Rodriguez where it shows a Don
[1:45:12.440 --> 1:45:16.920]  Johnson redneck shooting a pregnant Mexican lady in the stomach. That's not who's shooting
[1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:21.880]  pregnant Mexican ladies it is the cartels ladies and gentlemen so this isn't about race it's about
[1:45:21.880 --> 1:45:30.360]  evil it's about corruption and it's about the third world collapsing into the United States and so
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:34.440]  we're going to show you some shots here of the agriculture workers producing some of the most
[1:45:34.440 --> 1:45:40.440]  delicious produce in the world comes out of this Rio Grande Valley and we're going to show you again
[1:45:40.440 --> 1:45:45.960]  some more of the wall and what's unfolding here but this is the fabled romanticized Rio Grande it's
[1:45:45.960 --> 1:45:52.600]  very very beautiful in a strange way and it's very very sad to see this community we've been told
[1:45:52.600 --> 1:45:58.200]  was almost bankrupted by the lockdowns and down here it's more authoritarian just like Mexico is
[1:45:58.200 --> 1:46:02.760]  the people are still locked down in some areas they're still wearing masks everywhere and they
[1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:08.200]  just want things to reopen and so now Biden is pumping billions of dollars in here to fund these
[1:46:08.200 --> 1:46:12.840]  illegals and so some of that's getting in the community so the community's torn some of them
[1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:18.040]  want the money to survive and I understand that but still they're then aiding and abetting child
[1:46:18.040 --> 1:46:24.200]  trafficking and funding the cartels that are already bringing the type of corruption and
[1:46:24.200 --> 1:46:28.600]  really horrible lifestyle of slavery here to south Texas and other areas of the country
[1:46:28.600 --> 1:46:34.920]  that they've gotten in control of and you've got Pelosi famously saying MS-13 is all of God's children
[1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:39.880]  remember that that's because they're working with these people and laundering the money so
[1:46:39.880 --> 1:46:43.400]  that's why we're in so much danger because the Democratic Party has become a purely
[1:46:44.120 --> 1:46:47.960]  globalist organization a communist Chinese organization dedicated to destruction of our
[1:46:47.960 --> 1:46:52.600]  republic and that's why we have to understand this as part of a UN world government takeover to
[1:46:52.600 --> 1:46:56.760]  break our borders to break Europe's borders while the global lockdown this is the most important
[1:46:56.760 --> 1:47:01.880]  point has caused mass starvation and a complete collapse not just over the border but also on
[1:47:01.880 --> 1:47:07.240]  the Texas side of the border in other areas then it causes the giant migrant surge and the very UN
[1:47:07.240 --> 1:47:12.840]  that triggered the lockdown ran the Wuhan virus turns around and raises money off people starving
[1:47:12.840 --> 1:47:17.560]  to death claiming they're going to feed them in Africa and Asia and Latin America and the Middle
[1:47:17.560 --> 1:47:21.240]  East when none of the money actually goes to feed the people so they're using that double pronged
[1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:25.800]  attack of the fear of the virus to cause the lockdown then the third world surges the UN
[1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:30.200]  organizes people in refugee camps gives them their Joe Biden shirts gives them their debit cards
[1:47:30.200 --> 1:47:34.520]  and then buys off the local government to let this take place but I can tell you I've talked to
[1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:38.280]  the highest levels of the police here whether it's the state police or local police they're all
[1:47:38.280 --> 1:47:42.360]  behind us they totally agree with our analysis and they say this is illegal and needs to stop
[1:47:42.360 --> 1:47:47.000]  but it's the politicians above them that have basically been selling out and this is a bipartisan
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:55.480]  crisis I'll say this in closing we must we absolutely must demand that governor Abbott
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:48:01.960]  do more than just send the state police down here to write citizens tickets we must demand
[1:48:01.960 --> 1:48:07.560]  that Congress act and begin impeachment against the illegitimate president Joe Biden because this
[1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:12.600]  man said surge the border this man now has said good job you've got courage doing this what courage
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:17.640]  kid of people children the Mexican president it says this is insane it must stop and it's collapsing
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:23.560]  Mexico so this is nation states under globalist attack if we don't have borders we don't have
[1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:28.200]  language we don't have culture we're a tower of babble that will fall so stay with us more coming
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:32.600]  up this is exclusive information there's no mainstream media down here there's no coverage of
[1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:37.400]  this actual boots on the ground now and republicans are still debating whether there's a crisis or
[1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:42.200]  not down here but they're expanding all these giant facilities and waving laws and waving
[1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:46.600]  background checks for people that work in the facilities or waving background checks for who
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:52.040]  the children are being given to the FBI has no idea the state police have no idea they come
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:56.520]  across they walk through the gate they get picked up a border patrol on a bus they get taken to a
[1:48:56.520 --> 1:49:01.880]  facility for seven to 14 hours on average they're saying then they take them and put them into
[1:49:01.880 --> 1:49:06.680]  these democrat facilities catholic charities and others and they come right back out and they're
[1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:10.840]  put on a plane or they're put on a bus or they're put on a train and just ship anywhere in the US
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:16.040]  but then all of us as citizens need to have COVID passports to travel and there's checkpoints and
[1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:22.680]  apps and you know all this crap this is globalism collapse your borders and then give you corporate
[1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:27.240]  IDs to travel around the country and around the world and that's their whole plan have corporations
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:31.960]  in force control while governments sit back and allow it all to happen but now we see Governor
[1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:36.360]  DeSantis and others saying no we're not going to have COVID passports we're not going to have this
[1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:41.160]  crap this is corporations acting like government and acting like authoritarian governments at that
[1:49:41.160 --> 1:49:47.080]  so again no IDs no checks no COVID testing for these people not even background checks for who
[1:49:47.080 --> 1:49:52.040]  gets the children but all of us got to be watched carefully this is the essence of the new owner
[1:49:52.040 --> 1:49:57.160]  takeover and we're fighting hard at band.video and info wars.com that's why it's so critical
[1:49:57.160 --> 1:50:01.160]  for you to again share these reports with your friends with your family and say here is the
[1:50:01.160 --> 1:50:05.240]  forbidden information and do it via email do it very via text message because they try to block
[1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:09.720]  them on facebook and twitter and other places and always use whatever new url we have that
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:15.480]  isn't blocked at the time they'll block it later so you can spread it and right now that's bandthis.tv
[1:50:15.480 --> 1:50:20.920]  bandthis.tv you're just as important as i am just as important as this crew is just as important as
[1:50:20.920 --> 1:50:24.360]  this information is getting out because without you supporting us to spread the word know what's
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:27.800]  going to know without you buying products info warshore.com we're not going to have the crew to
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:32.840]  be down here in the security and the helicopter and the drones and all of this to break information
[1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:37.240]  that nobody else is breaking we've got major whistleblowers coming out so many big reports
[1:50:37.240 --> 1:50:41.320]  once we get back to austin but right now and follow this report in the field thanking law because
[1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:48.680]  this is such an important historic moment so there it is the latest from alex jones we're
[1:50:48.680 --> 1:50:55.560]  going to be having more from alex at the southern border i am sure throughout the day of course i'll
[1:50:55.560 --> 1:51:00.920]  be back hosting the war room again today as well uh and so i'm sure we'll be getting updates from
[1:51:00.920 --> 1:51:09.000]  alex and crew down at the border but the situation for the most part has been blown wide open and
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:17.160]  exposed and so now it's just how much cover can the biden administration run for their criminal
[1:51:17.160 --> 1:51:24.040]  activity like they're now saying oh you know what maybe we will plug some of those gaps in the wall
[1:51:24.040 --> 1:51:30.680]  we'll see if they actually do that but that's just pandering that's just pretending like they
[1:51:30.680 --> 1:51:36.920]  aren't running an illegal immigration pipeline a criminal activity campaign even though they've
[1:51:36.920 --> 1:51:45.880]  been completely exposed in doing just that arrests should be made impeachment trials is like the very
[1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:51.800]  minimum of what joe biden and crews should be experiencing for their illegal immigration
[1:51:52.840 --> 1:51:57.400]  criminal activity the pipeline that they have facilitated promoted funded
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:03.720]  uh impeachment trials would be a nice start but where the republicans calling for the impeachment
[1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:09.720]  trials nope they're just losers that do nothing apparently remember folks everything we do is

[1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:21.000]  let's take a look at what black lives matter activists are saying about the scharman trial
[1:55:22.680 --> 1:55:29.720]  for choice murder is not sentenced just know that all hell is going to break loose
[1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:40.360]  don't be surprised when buildings are on fire just yeah sounds like insurrection sounds like
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:46.520]  terrorism sounds like an arrest should be made but it won't be she's black see she's with black lives
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:51.160]  matter you're allowed to be a terrorist now that's what's promoted kind of like in washington dc when
[1:55:51.160 --> 1:55:57.960]  those two little black girls murdered that immigrant in a carjacking and the mayor immediately ran
[1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:03.240]  cover with ad campaign saying make sure to lock your car to avoid crime blaming the immigrant
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:08.120]  putting out new psas saying the same thing and now those girls will be released by the time they're
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:15.080]  21 for that murder and now black lives matter activists get to say we're going to burn your
[1:56:15.080 --> 1:56:20.520]  city to the ground unless you do what we say that's terrorism there should be terrorism charges
[1:56:20.520 --> 1:56:28.280]  levied against these groups and these people and investigations and trials but there won't be the
[1:56:28.280 --> 1:56:32.520]  democrats get to be terrorists the democrats get to be racist and now look at what they're
[1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:39.240]  teaching kids in school and if students don't want to buy into the racism they're being taught
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:45.960]  look at how the teachers try to indoctrinate them with critical race theory the story behind this
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:52.680]  picture um i'd rather hold on to that just tell me tell me what this seems to be a picture of
[1:56:56.520 --> 1:57:02.120]  it's just two people chilling right just two people there's nothing more to this picture
[1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:13.000]  i'm not really just two people chilling i don't believe that you believe that um i don't believe
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:18.120]  that you look at this as just two people um i don't think truly is just two people though is it not
[1:57:19.480 --> 1:57:24.600]  yeah but i think you're being i think you're being um i think you're being intentionally coy
[1:57:24.600 --> 1:57:30.840]  about what this is a picture of what i'm being coy about it's two people standing back to back
[1:57:30.840 --> 1:57:37.560]  in a picture yeah and that's all you see is two people i'm confused on what you would like me to
[1:57:37.560 --> 1:57:44.040]  to speak i don't i don't think you are i don't know why you do this um i'm not trying to call you out
[1:57:44.040 --> 1:57:49.560]  but you could you you rate you know you come out off of mute to talk about what this is a picture of
[1:57:49.560 --> 1:57:54.760]  and you act as if as if you know there's nothing noticeable about this apart from the fact that
[1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:59.560]  there's two people well i'm confused are you trying to get me to say that there are two different
[1:57:59.560 --> 1:58:04.120]  races in this picture yes i am i'll see you today well at the end of the day wouldn't that just be
[1:58:04.120 --> 1:58:08.840]  feeding into the problem of looking at race instead of just acknowledging them as two normal people
[1:58:10.040 --> 1:58:15.080]  no it's not because you you can't not look at you can't like you can't look at the people and not
[1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:21.640]  acknowledge that there are racial differences right but if we're going for let's say if we're
[1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:25.960]  looking for equality within all this then why would we need to point out things such as that
[1:58:26.760 --> 1:58:30.920]  because those things those differences are real things you can't you can't
[1:58:30.920 --> 1:58:34.600]  yeah so there you go there's your critical race theory right there
[1:58:36.360 --> 1:58:42.280]  they're teaching kids they're teaching young adults they're teaching students how to be
[1:58:42.280 --> 1:58:46.600]  racists in fact they're not even teaching they're forcing them they're forcing them
[1:58:46.600 --> 1:58:53.240]  everything is about race be a racist and look at the teacher try to call the guy out no see the
[1:58:53.240 --> 1:59:01.960]  skin color see the skin color talk about race why are liberals like this why are communists like
[1:59:01.960 --> 1:59:08.760]  this why are you such racists you know the good news is there's going to be such a pushback in the
[1:59:08.760 --> 1:59:15.080]  face of these racists that i i do believe when when when we've eradicated this this nonsense
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:22.040]  that people will be more united than ever and they'll say remember what they tried to do to us
[1:59:22.040 --> 1:59:26.280]  remember what they tried to do to us they tried to divide us on race remember when the the democrats
[1:59:26.280 --> 1:59:29.960]  remember when the media remember when the when the politicians remember when the establishment
[1:59:29.960 --> 1:59:36.760]  tried to divide us on race haha they didn't beat us we won but no this is your this is your democrat
[1:59:36.760 --> 1:59:41.400]  party this is your mainstream media this is your modern day liberal progressive democrat they want
[1:59:41.400 --> 1:59:48.600]  everybody to be racist because they are racists they're training racists with critical race theory
[1:59:48.600 --> 1:59:56.040]  power abhorrence humanity has been domesticated by and large the population has been trained
[1:59:56.040 --> 2:00:01.160]  to submit do what you're told that's all going to pass but if you study authoritarians if you
[2:00:01.160 --> 2:00:05.400]  study the globalists you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta
[2:00:05.400 --> 2:00:09.480]  and you go into the point of being cold being totally enslaved and because the globalists see
[2:00:09.480 --> 2:00:14.280]  us as weak and see us as stupid they are now making that move and they are collapsing the third
[2:00:14.280 --> 2:00:19.560]  world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that the un will use as
[2:00:19.560 --> 2:00:25.640]  a weapon to then have us under such a crises under such a load capitulate to the un whatever
[2:00:25.640 --> 2:00:30.920]  agreements they want us to sign hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees
[2:00:30.920 --> 2:00:37.000]  not fleeing covid or climate change as the un and claus schwaver saying and bill gates is saying
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:43.640]  but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the un and bill gates ordered them to institute or they
[2:00:43.640 --> 2:00:49.720]  wouldn't get more imf and world bank money and that's why we have to really get educated about the
[2:00:49.720 --> 2:01:00.760]  globalist
[2:01:02.360 --> 2:01:08.760]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex johns
[2:01:08.760 --> 2:01:16.600]  i'm sure you're sitting in for alex johns we're in the third hour today paul joseph blottsin coming
[2:01:16.600 --> 2:01:20.440]  up hosting the fourth hour i'll be back hosting the war room today i've got enough news that i'll
[2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:24.680]  be doing a lot of news on the war room plus i've got a couple great guests patrick alley has an
[2:01:24.680 --> 2:01:29.720]  exclusive story he's going to be breaking on the war room today and then jesse lee peterson
[2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:33.560]  and of course we'll be hearing from alex before the day is done as well down at the border but
[2:01:33.560 --> 2:01:41.960]  let me explain how this works again you know you can only tell a lie so long before people
[2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:47.400]  realize that it's a lie and and understand what the truth actually is and so with the covid pandemic
[2:01:47.400 --> 2:01:55.160]  we're beginning to reach that stage even if people do believe it outside of the total brainwash
[2:01:55.160 --> 2:02:00.040]  leftist that just wants to become a slave and enslave the world people just want to get back
[2:02:00.040 --> 2:02:04.440]  to their normal lives they're sick of living in fear they're sick of all the big government um
[2:02:04.440 --> 2:02:07.160]  they're sick of the economic shutdown they're just sick of it they just want to get back to their
[2:02:07.160 --> 2:02:13.880]  lives and so this is how it goes in a series of headlines let me explain how this works
[2:02:14.600 --> 2:02:22.280]  and again if we were a sane society serious about living in in a in an advanced civilization we'd
[2:02:22.280 --> 2:02:29.240]  be responding to this appropriately we're not but maybe that day will come but here's how it goes
[2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:34.520]  texas covid cases dropped to record lows after scrapping mask mandate okay so they lied about
[2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:41.720]  the spread and they lied about the mask so then people understand the big lie and new polls come
[2:02:41.720 --> 2:02:47.800]  out americans fear of catching covid 19 drops to record lows okay so you realize you were lied to
[2:02:47.800 --> 2:02:52.600]  and the lies that told you to live in fear were not were not true so now you don't live in fear
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:03:00.680]  anymore but then you notice hmm maybe the vaccine is what i should actually be afraid of the vaccine
[2:03:00.680 --> 2:03:05.960]  is killing me facebook fact checks women's post about covid vaccine adverse reaction then she dies
[2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:12.760]  hmm so okay so here's how it goes so americans realize you lied about the pandemic they don't
[2:03:12.760 --> 2:03:18.600]  live in fear now they realize that the vaccine is killing people and they have questions and so here
[2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:24.280]  comes the very people that lied about the pandemic lied about covid and forced the vaccines like
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:31.160]  fauci and then they come out and say we're not forcing vaccines we're not pushing for vaccine
[2:03:31.160 --> 2:03:39.640]  passports that's the private industry scrubbing their hands of the blood that's on them scrubbing
[2:03:39.640 --> 2:03:43.880]  their head of the collapse of the country is the collapse of the supply chain the collapse of just
[2:03:43.880 --> 2:03:50.760]  basic human confidence of walking around the earth they did all of that but now that we're awake to
[2:03:50.760 --> 2:03:56.440]  their lies now that we're awake to the deadly vaccines oh no no no fauci oh no no no no we're
[2:03:56.440 --> 2:04:01.640]  not forcing vaccines we're not talking about vaccine passports that's not us no that is you
[2:04:01.640 --> 2:04:07.000]  dirt bag we know it's you don't try to pass this off like you have nothing to do with it
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:18.200]  it we know about event 201 we know about fauci's work at the n i n h i h for years we know about
[2:04:18.200 --> 2:04:23.720]  the scumbag fauci we have your documents we've seen your predictive programming we know about
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:31.080]  event 201 we know about all the things that you have like the new latest leaked documents
[2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:39.480]  that summit news has leaked documents show uk government has planned for vaccine passports
[2:04:39.480 --> 2:04:44.280]  all along so the very people that lied to you about the pandemic forced you to take the vaccines
[2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:49.560]  after you locked down as an incentive to be free again now they know uh oh the people of the world
[2:04:49.560 --> 2:04:53.160]  know that we lied to them and the people of the know the world know that we planned this whole
[2:04:53.160 --> 2:04:58.120]  thing and they know the vaccine is deadly uh what are we going to do well let's just say we had
[2:04:58.120 --> 2:05:06.360]  nothing to do with it uh we have the receipts nice try so you wait bill gates and fauci and
[2:05:06.360 --> 2:05:09.880]  everybody else is going to try to wipe their hands of all the blood that's on it say we had nothing
[2:05:09.880 --> 2:05:13.560]  to do with vaccines we had nothing to do with a vaccine passport no it was all you you lied
[2:05:13.560 --> 2:05:17.880]  about the pandemic you lied about covid you probably even had something to do with the release
[2:05:17.880 --> 2:05:25.240]  of it and we're on to you so you're not going to slink away on this deal you're not going to wash
[2:05:25.240 --> 2:05:30.520]  the blood off your hands on this deal and say see our hands are clean that's not how this is going to
[2:05:30.520 --> 2:05:37.240]  go they may think this is how it's going to go it's not how it's going to go and so greg abbott
[2:05:37.240 --> 2:05:45.400]  is trying to save some face right now and he has followed in the footsteps of ron de santis of
[2:05:45.400 --> 2:05:52.920]  florida and so the governor of texas greg abbott has just released he's issued an executive order
[2:05:52.920 --> 2:05:58.200]  prohibiting state agencies or political subdivisions in texas from creating a vaccine passport
[2:05:58.200 --> 2:06:05.960]  requirement and he says he stands for health privacy and individual privacy so he's obviously
[2:06:05.960 --> 2:06:12.280]  trying to save face for the hack job that he did in the year 2020 falling for the fake pandemic
[2:06:12.280 --> 2:06:18.920]  and then the hack job he did uh allowing texas texas energy to no longer be independent which
[2:06:18.920 --> 2:06:23.960]  has caused a complete sabotage of our infrastructure so abbott trying to save face for another run
[2:06:23.960 --> 2:06:29.960]  at governor saying we're not going to do the vaccine passports and uh we're fully open so hey
[2:06:29.960 --> 2:06:36.680]  good for him at least he woke up maybe it was a little too late but so that's how it's going right
[2:06:36.680 --> 2:06:45.400]  now but if another pandemic happens and if these vaccines continue killing people we know who to
[2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:49.720]  blame we know who's responsible it'll be the very people saying we had nothing to do with this
[2:06:53.480 --> 2:07:01.160]  so good on greg abbott even though uh i haven't been a fan of his all the time he's doing the
[2:07:01.160 --> 2:07:07.960]  right thing here and it's just time for people to stand up and say enough is enough we've been
[2:07:07.960 --> 2:07:13.160]  doing this for over a year are we going to do this forever are we going to live our lives again
[2:07:13.160 --> 2:07:22.280]  and if you want government tyranny then at least be honest about it don't sit here and talk about
[2:07:22.280 --> 2:07:26.280]  a pandemic don't sit here and talk about how you want to save lives don't sit here and talk about
[2:07:26.280 --> 2:07:32.920]  mass spread super spread events that's all a lie and we know it do i expect you'll be honest about
[2:07:32.920 --> 2:07:39.960]  it no do i expect to admit you to admit that you were wrong no do i expect you to take the mask off
[2:07:39.960 --> 2:07:45.880]  and stop acting like an insane psychopath no but we the same people of planet earth
[2:07:45.880 --> 2:07:50.440]  we the same people of the united states of america we're done we're ready to move on we're ready to
[2:07:50.440 --> 2:07:56.680]  be free again we don't want globalism we don't want a new world order we don't want population
[2:07:56.680 --> 2:08:04.280]  control we don't want eugenics we want free market we want free speech we want free movement free
[2:08:04.280 --> 2:08:10.360]  commerce we want you out of our lives fouchie we want you out of our lives gates we want you out
[2:08:10.360 --> 2:08:18.040]  of our lives government but yes ladies and gentlemen expect the news media and the headlines
[2:08:18.040 --> 2:08:23.320]  and everybody to say new mutant strain four times as deadly in fact fouchie just came out and said
[2:08:23.320 --> 2:08:29.720]  the only way today he said the only way to stop a fourth wave a fourth wave did you even know
[2:08:29.720 --> 2:08:35.160]  there was a second wave a third wave no but there's a fourth wave and fouchie says the only way to
[2:08:35.160 --> 2:08:39.640]  stop the fourth wave is to everybody to get vaccinated but he says he's not for the vaccine
[2:08:39.640 --> 2:08:46.520]  passwords he's not the one forcing the vaccines what a liar but he's a big pharmaceutical whore
[2:08:47.320 --> 2:08:57.080]  so he has to say that cdc director fears impending doom if we open too too soon what a lie so as
[2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:03.000]  america's getting back to normal as 40 000 people are flooding major league baseball stadiums as
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:07.320]  trump is probably gonna have another rally with 50 000 100 000 plus probably within a month or two
[2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:12.600]  as bars are getting open as restaurants are getting open as the mask mandates are being
[2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:17.160]  lifted as people are getting back to normal lives and as we see the illegal immigrant facilities
[2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:22.760]  with people stacked on top of each other like sardines the american people are saying we're
[2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:28.440]  done with your fake pandemic we want to get back to normal so here comes the media here comes fouchie
[2:09:28.440 --> 2:09:33.240]  here comes gates here comes the democrat party to tell you to still live in fear to tell you
[2:09:33.240 --> 2:09:38.520]  covid's gonna kill you to tell you to be absolutely deadly afraid of covid and give over to world
[2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:46.440]  government tyranny that's the only way you can live again we refuse your lies we refuse your
[2:09:46.440 --> 2:09:54.200]  false narratives we refuse your fear and we will be free again and if you really want this battle
[2:09:54.200 --> 2:10:00.760]  if you really want to stand in the way of humans and freedom you will be annihilated
[2:10:04.680 --> 2:10:09.560]  you will be done humans will be free
[2:10:09.560 --> 2:10:16.600]  and anybody who wants to get in the way of human freedom will be destroyed
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:27.080]  that's our destiny that's our will so good luck tyrants yeah you're gonna murder a bunch of people
[2:10:27.080 --> 2:10:30.440]  yeah your vaccines are gonna kill a bunch of people yeah you'll probably release a little
[2:10:30.440 --> 2:10:35.560]  biological weapon that'll actually be deadly but we know who you are
[2:10:35.560 --> 2:10:44.120]  are and we have the gift of the holy spirit we have the light and the soul of god and we
[2:10:44.120 --> 2:10:50.360]  know who's standing in between us and freedom and we will be free get out of our way epic is one of
[2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:57.800]  only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association and they
[2:10:57.800 --> 2:11:02.760]  know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive
[2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:08.360]  censorship and organized crime racketeering that's why they've been massively expanding their services
[2:11:08.360 --> 2:11:12.520]  so whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want
[2:11:12.520 --> 2:11:17.960]  servers or any other major service they've got it all and they're expanding and if you go to info
[2:11:17.960 --> 2:11:23.960]  wars domains dot com and follow that link you get all their services at the lowest price
[2:11:23.960 --> 2:11:29.800]  and 25 percent of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war
[2:11:29.800 --> 2:11:34.680]  then we get five percent as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from
[2:11:34.680 --> 2:11:39.560]  them so it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists are
[2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:46.200]  destroying what was open and what was free so info wars domains dot com the revolution starts there
[2:11:46.200 --> 2:11:53.800]  info wars domains dot com take action now the equation is very simple the mega banks control
[2:11:53.800 --> 2:12:00.840]  the media they control big pharma they control academia they control the military industrial
[2:12:00.840 --> 2:12:06.920]  complex they control big tech and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:14.760]  they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization it is the western christian idea
[2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:19.640]  of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that
[2:12:19.640 --> 2:12:26.120]  actually threatens them so because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted
[2:12:26.120 --> 2:12:33.720]  turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free
[2:12:33.720 --> 2:12:38.760]  market that threatens their monopoly so control that's why they target info wars because we
[2:12:38.760 --> 2:12:44.520]  understand the keys to defeating them the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote
[2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:51.400]  info wars and have that video so redouble your efforts we're all in this together
[2:12:51.400 --> 2:13:20.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:29.400]  you know the truth is the globalists and the eugenicist fear humans that's the truth
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:35.960]  they fear you that's why they want you enslaved that's why they want you in pavers that's why
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:41.240]  they want you unhealthy that's why they want you in fear because they're afraid of you
[2:13:43.560 --> 2:13:47.800]  we are here in the third hour of the alex jones show owen schreuer sitting in for alex jones
[2:13:47.800 --> 2:13:53.000]  paul joseph watson coming up on the fourth hour i mean i got a big war room broadcast scheduled
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:14:03.800]  for today as well we also have some other stories that uh i'm gonna cover here in fact
[2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:13.720]  let's go ahead and begin right now so ronda santis who is doing a great job as a trump
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:21.560]  impersonator maybe unintentionally or intentionally either way it's it's good stuff nobody's doing
[2:14:21.560 --> 2:14:28.760]  a great job as the governor of florida does plan on running for president in 2024 it seems uh
[2:14:30.040 --> 2:14:34.600]  so 60 minutes though had to step in and do something to destroy him because that's what
[2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:39.000]  mainstream media does they want to destroy good men they want to destroy good women they want to
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:43.400]  destroy uh actual politicians that tell the truth see that's the problem they don't like it when
[2:14:43.400 --> 2:14:50.280]  politicians are real and tell the truth so desantis must be destroyed kwomo kwomo the pervert
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:55.560]  that has what nine ten women that have accused him of sexual assault now media silent on that
[2:14:56.760 --> 2:15:02.200]  the 16 000 people that died in the nursing home because of his policies media doesn't really seem
[2:15:02.200 --> 2:15:11.320]  to mind that much either oh but 60 minutes we'll do a massive hit piece on ronda santis and then
[2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:20.920]  it comes out it was just entirely fabricated fake entirely fake so the pervert murderer the pervert
[2:15:20.920 --> 2:15:29.480]  nursing home slayer gets protection by the mainstream media but ronda santis who actually
[2:15:29.480 --> 2:15:32.920]  is a good governor who actually wants to be real and tell the truth and help people
[2:15:33.800 --> 2:15:39.000]  no 60 minutes has to run a hit piece on him and lie about him so of course the whole thing ends up
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:46.840]  being totally fake story at zero hedge it was intentionally false 60 minutes planned for fabricating
[2:15:46.840 --> 2:15:53.160]  pay for play narrative against desantis uh public's has made a statement saying it's entirely false
[2:15:53.160 --> 2:16:00.040]  and now the democrat mayor of palm beach has said it's completely false do you hear that
[2:16:00.040 --> 2:16:06.520]  that was a democrat mayor saying the 60 minutes reporting on ronda santis was totally false so
[2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:14.760]  will there be any consequences for 60 minutes will facebook or twitter or youtube or anybody
[2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:25.160]  banned 60 minutes from their platforms for fault for presenting false information somehow i don't
[2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:33.800]  think so because this is their job this is now 60 minutes job is to deceive you is to destroy
[2:16:33.800 --> 2:16:40.280]  targets that's what 60 minutes job is now that's what mainstream media's job is now running puff
[2:16:40.280 --> 2:16:47.800]  pieces on hunter biden talking about smoking parmesan cheese in his crack addiction a 51 year
[2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:52.360]  old man running cover for him like he's a like he's a adolescent child that doesn't know any
[2:16:52.360 --> 2:16:58.360]  better than to smoke crack for 30 years of his life and get naked in bed with his with his
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:03.240]  family members his underage nieces god knows what else this guy was doing
[2:17:03.240 --> 2:17:13.000]  but they run cover pieces for hunter biden they don't ask about the deals with china he just says
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:20.920]  no that never happened they just don't ask a single question but oh we got to get to santis
[2:17:21.960 --> 2:17:27.720]  all those women accusing qualmo of uh the sexual assault allegations don't worry about that
[2:17:28.920 --> 2:17:32.680]  we're not worried about that we have to destroy desantis see he's doing a good job in florida
[2:17:32.680 --> 2:17:40.040]  he's an honest politician he must be destroyed we can't have that that's the modus operandi at
[2:17:40.040 --> 2:17:46.280]  60 minutes but boy oh boy you want to get away with anything i mean you want to get away with
[2:17:46.280 --> 2:17:51.000]  being a drug drug addict you want to get away with being a serial abuser of women you want
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:56.280]  to get away with uh selling our country out to foreign nations just be a democrat man i mean
[2:17:56.280 --> 2:18:01.960]  seriously this here's the thing some criminals are actually really smart some criminals are
[2:18:01.960 --> 2:18:06.680]  actually really smart and so big time criminals or murderers they know all i have to do is be a
[2:18:06.680 --> 2:18:12.040]  democrat if i end up getting to office as a democrat i got the media to cover me i got i got all the
[2:18:12.040 --> 2:18:16.600]  people that the democrat party owns to cover me i got the whole new world order to cover me i'm good
[2:18:16.600 --> 2:18:21.720]  i can do anything i want i can go on tv and talk about how i smoke parmesan cheese
[2:18:24.200 --> 2:18:30.040]  uh yeah and everybody's wondering if it's even the real hunter biden i mean i think it's fair
[2:18:30.040 --> 2:18:35.320]  to say that those two men are not the same person but it's like i don't even want to go down that
[2:18:35.320 --> 2:18:41.080]  rabbit hole quite frankly i really don't want to go down that rabbit hole i remember when we saw
[2:18:41.080 --> 2:18:49.800]  the hunter biden speech at the joe biden uh dnc commencement or whatever it was this summer i
[2:18:49.800 --> 2:18:54.520]  remember seeing that saying that's not hunter biden doesn't look like hunter biden totally
[2:18:54.520 --> 2:18:58.520]  different hairline different hair color different eyes different face different jawline different
[2:18:58.520 --> 2:19:03.160]  nose but it's like i don't even want to go down that road the world is so insane now so are they
[2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:09.000]  doing hunter biden stand-ins when hunter biden is smoking parmesan cheese out of a rug in a hotel
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:15.960]  they have to bring in the body double and this is the smartest guy joe biden knows he said smartest
[2:19:15.960 --> 2:19:22.520]  guy knows it's his son that smokes parmesan cheese out of rugs a crack addict for 30 plus years who
[2:19:22.520 --> 2:19:36.600]  does porn who does porn and uh again it's like this weird thing folks where you know we used to just
[2:19:37.640 --> 2:19:40.360]  present this all to you but there's really no value in me telling
[2:19:42.360 --> 2:19:47.080]  what could potentially be coming out of hunter biden's laptop because either comes out or it
[2:19:47.080 --> 2:19:56.600]  does it the guy's a pervert the things that the details on his laptop are so sorted and i think
[2:19:56.600 --> 2:20:01.480]  there's yet to even be divulged and it's going to involve other politicians and it's going to
[2:20:01.480 --> 2:20:07.240]  involve underage people maybe even people in his own family uh beyond just the drug use and and the
[2:20:07.240 --> 2:20:13.080]  sexual perversions folks it's not good this guy this is this is this is a really fallen human
[2:20:13.080 --> 2:20:21.560]  this is a really bad badly fallen human addicted to drugs addicted to sex and a horrible influence
[2:20:21.560 --> 2:20:28.200]  on the people that were in his life of course joe biden facilitated all of it joe biden got paid off
[2:20:28.200 --> 2:20:34.120]  for a lot of the deals that hunter did that was part of the plan but will 60 minutes run a special
[2:20:34.120 --> 2:20:38.920]  on that nope but they'll lie about ronda santis an honest man a good man who actually wants to be a
[2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:47.160]  real leader but they'll run cover for the biden crime family all around the clock because that's
[2:20:47.160 --> 2:20:54.680]  what they do but the good news is there's people on mainstream news that have been regular guests
[2:20:54.680 --> 2:21:01.080]  and fill ins and stuff on fox that are actually like wow this is a lot worse than i thought it was
[2:21:01.720 --> 2:21:05.160]  we'll see much how much longer they're allowed at fox news there's a lot of changes happening
[2:21:05.160 --> 2:21:10.520]  in fox news right now so uh they may be trying to wait out weed out the people that are taking
[2:21:10.520 --> 2:21:15.720]  the red pill and realize how bad things have gotten and might dare call something a fake pandemic
[2:21:15.720 --> 2:21:20.760]  or might dale dare call fouchy a liar and a criminal on a scumbag or might dare talk about
[2:21:20.760 --> 2:21:25.560]  the joe biden crime family or might dare to talk about what's on hunter biden's laptop yeah they
[2:21:25.560 --> 2:21:30.360]  might be waned off of fox news soon i'm seeing the awakening happening on some of their outlying
[2:21:30.360 --> 2:21:39.960]  personalities so but don't worry 60 minutes will run a fake hit piece onto santis suffer no
[2:21:39.960 --> 2:21:46.200]  consequences meanwhile the biden crime crime family runs rampant quomo runs rampant they run cover for
[2:21:46.200 --> 2:21:54.120]  all of it i'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes
[2:21:54.120 --> 2:22:00.040]  and full versus head if you're paying attention you know we've done together but i'll tell you this
[2:22:01.480 --> 2:22:07.880]  the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms
[2:22:07.880 --> 2:22:14.440]  of media they're trying to shudder and silence human resistance so now is the time to understand
[2:22:14.440 --> 2:22:18.360]  that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate everything you warned your friends and
[2:22:18.360 --> 2:22:23.880]  family about it's around to be true so it's now that your credibility is way up the power structures
[2:22:23.880 --> 2:22:31.320]  of a silence those of us that they can't but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us
[2:22:32.040 --> 2:22:38.600]  we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech we have to
[2:22:38.600 --> 2:22:44.040]  make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't come so be the
[2:22:44.040 --> 2:22:54.840]  polar bears you are the new world order is a planetary corporate plan for world government
[2:22:54.840 --> 2:23:02.120]  but world government is only the control grid now intermembers of the cult are told that they are
[2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:07.560]  going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality but the price for that is to carry
[2:23:07.560 --> 2:23:14.920]  out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based line forms that's why they say carbon is bad
[2:23:14.920 --> 2:23:21.640]  they are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet they are playing god they believe they
[2:23:21.640 --> 2:23:28.120]  have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry
[2:23:28.120 --> 2:23:33.880]  out this transformation i know this sounds insane but if you read the writings of the globalist
[2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:42.600]  it's all on record you have been warned you have been given the information to say no to this plan
[2:23:42.600 --> 2:23:49.640]  this is the end of all life on earth as we know it this is the alien takeover of earth i've been
[2:23:49.640 --> 2:23:55.080]  thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there about looking at the world from
[2:23:55.080 --> 2:23:59.240]  the perspective of the globalist that the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're
[2:23:59.240 --> 2:24:03.160]  stealing their future from them that we're poisoning them that we're sterilizing them
[2:24:03.160 --> 2:24:08.520]  that they deserve to be killed yes that's the position of the globalist they play god and they
[2:24:08.520 --> 2:24:14.920]  think because we don't stand up they have a right to do this to us you know i've told you that the
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:19.320]  globals who tried to harm me they try to get me to join them but metaphysically at a spiritual level
[2:24:20.440 --> 2:24:25.160]  i have the whole spirit i'm connection with gods and i know that god does not like that so i say
[2:24:25.160 --> 2:24:30.840]  i've joined the enemy but i'll tell you at a selfish level i get very very mad at people
[2:24:30.840 --> 2:24:34.520]  that go along with the system believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power
[2:24:35.560 --> 2:24:40.520]  whether you're just a steelworker or a school teacher or a Henry Kissinger you're not god
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:46.520]  and treating other people like they're animals and your god is something that the real god of
[2:24:46.520 --> 2:24:51.960]  the universe doesn't like and that's a fact you know it's crazy to get to this point it's very
[2:24:51.960 --> 2:24:56.680]  bittersweet everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we
[2:24:56.680 --> 2:24:59.880]  have a lot of credibility but i don't care about that i care about beating the new world order
[2:24:59.880 --> 2:25:05.240]  and it's because we have so much credibility they can't allow us to stay on air much longer
[2:25:05.240 --> 2:25:09.000]  and i don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  tell you what's going on but let's just say this we're going to see this through the end
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:18.200]  we're gonna stay on air as long as we can so please pray for us and please buy the products
[2:25:18.200 --> 2:25:23.160]  and then forwardstore.com they're great products plus they fund the operation so you know unlike
[2:25:23.160 --> 2:25:27.320]  other products you can buy they're still great do they fund freedom no a lot of them don't these
[2:25:27.320 --> 2:25:32.440]  are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and
[2:25:32.440 --> 2:25:36.920]  looking for truth that's why the globalists are censoring they can't bring in all this tyranny
[2:25:36.920 --> 2:25:40.920]  and leave people like us on the air so while you're at it don't just financially support us and
[2:25:40.920 --> 2:25:45.640]  spread the word download everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long
[2:25:45.640 --> 2:25:49.080]  we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said
[2:25:49.080 --> 2:25:55.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:26:04.760 --> 2:26:09.720]  all right more republican governors are waking up and taking a stand against the vaccine passport
[2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:16.280]  and trying to save their own political career as well governor brine kemp of georgia says he will
[2:26:16.280 --> 2:26:22.600]  not be bringing the vaccine passport to georgia so that's good now it's just time to reopen
[2:26:23.560 --> 2:26:26.760]  so here's the next move all you cowardly politicians need to make
[2:26:28.520 --> 2:26:32.680]  if you can figure this one out it's kind of difficult it's called freedom
[2:26:33.960 --> 2:26:38.120]  so it is really simple it's called freedom all you do is make a statement say you know what
[2:26:38.120 --> 2:26:44.440]  here's what we're going to go with freedom it's a total political win people don't want to go out
[2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:49.240]  people want to wear a mask people want to wear a hazmat suit a suit a welder shield mask whatever
[2:26:49.240 --> 2:26:52.520]  freedom people don't want to open their business people do want to open their business people want
[2:26:52.520 --> 2:26:55.400]  to have restrictions people don't want to have restrictions people want to get the vaccine
[2:26:55.400 --> 2:27:02.280]  people don't want to get it there it's called freedom baby whoo it works and freedom is popular
[2:27:02.840 --> 2:27:10.680]  freedom is good for you so be free we'll see if these cowardly corrupt politicians can figure
[2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:22.120]  that out but that's not in their agenda is it now this is really an odd thing because
[2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:31.640]  the mlb moving the all-star game to denver from atlanta is is making a lot of people realize
[2:27:31.640 --> 2:27:37.320]  how insane and stupid and moronic our politicians really are and how the policies and the moves
[2:27:37.320 --> 2:27:44.120]  they make really have no bearings in reality oh we're moving the all-star game out of atlanta
[2:27:45.400 --> 2:27:51.560]  for a voter law in georgia that actually expands voting rights it increases early voting it increases
[2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:56.200]  access to voting i mean it's insane so people actually read the bill and they're like huh
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:28:01.640]  this actually increases the ability to vote this makes it easier to vote wow what are they so mad
[2:28:01.640 --> 2:28:08.360]  about well there's always something else going on there's always an ulterior motive but then
[2:28:09.080 --> 2:28:14.840]  they go even further and they say hold on i'll hold on they're moving it to denver where there's
[2:28:14.840 --> 2:28:21.320]  even more in colorado there's even more restrictive voter laws less early voting less mail-in voting
[2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:28.760]  georgia's like wide open voter laws colorado's like so they're like well this doesn't make sense
[2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:34.920]  plus you have the atlanta braves that play in atlanta georgia 81 home games a year they're not
[2:28:34.920 --> 2:28:38.360]  boycotting they're not leaving the state they're still gonna play those games
[2:28:40.360 --> 2:28:45.720]  oh but wait a second maybe there's a racial angle we can find to this yeah that's what yeah race
[2:28:45.720 --> 2:28:56.920]  that's what we want race uh georgia i believe the third most uh by demographics i think guys in fact
[2:28:56.920 --> 2:29:02.440]  look it up let me see if i'm remembering this i think georgia's the number three most black
[2:29:02.440 --> 2:29:07.480]  state in the nation is georgia atlanta georgia is one of the blackest cities in america but i'm
[2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:11.320]  pretty sure georgia's i think number three in america but guys let's look this up i'm gonna try
[2:29:11.320 --> 2:29:17.240]  to go from memory i haven't done this in a while i believe georgia's the number three most black
[2:29:17.240 --> 2:29:26.200]  demographic state in the united states of america is georgia oh there it is so so guys let's try to
[2:29:26.200 --> 2:29:32.200]  find colorado i'm guessing colorado is probably around number 40 let's see let's see the let's
[2:29:32.200 --> 2:29:39.000]  see where colorado ranks for demographics for black people let's see guys let's find colorado on that
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:44.200]  list i think i'm gonna go around third i'm gonna go around 40 for colorado because you know everything's
[2:29:44.200 --> 2:29:49.800]  about race to these people so there has to be a racial angle oh 34 it's moving up they're almost
[2:29:49.800 --> 2:29:56.040]  woke enough to have an all-star game oh wait they are so you pull the all-star game out of one of the
[2:29:56.040 --> 2:30:02.280]  most uh black cities in america and then you put it into denver colorado one of the widest
[2:30:03.720 --> 2:30:12.520]  states and inner cities in america so your voting rights uh deal doesn't make any sense
[2:30:12.520 --> 2:30:16.680]  if you try to backtrack and say it's about race that's not going to make any sense so what the
[2:30:16.680 --> 2:30:22.840]  hell is going on here there's an ulterior motive there's an agenda there always is
[2:30:25.320 --> 2:30:30.440]  mlb cuts a deal with tencent the chinese company maybe ten cents making the calls
[2:30:30.440 --> 2:30:35.560]  just like they do with the nba gotta get our product in china that's what it's all about
[2:30:39.160 --> 2:30:43.640]  so there's two things destroying sports greed and liberalism now
[2:30:43.640 --> 2:30:48.440]  now greed and liberalism the greed of wanting to get in the chinese market and then the liberalism
[2:30:48.440 --> 2:30:57.240]  of bowing to the woke mob now i'll be honest i was jealous of my friends that got to go to the
[2:30:57.240 --> 2:31:02.440]  rangers game yesterday in a crowded ballpark nobody wearing masks with cold beers flowing and
[2:31:02.440 --> 2:31:10.840]  hot dogs simmering reminds me of childhood the sounds the sights americana the great american
[2:31:10.840 --> 2:31:15.880]  the great american pastime now being ruined by china now being ruined by liberals once again
[2:31:18.040 --> 2:31:29.960]  and this whole bs about moving the all-star game is just that total bs it doesn't make any sense
[2:31:29.960 --> 2:31:35.240]  nobody could actually make the arguments logically but yeah there's the texas ranger game filled with
[2:31:35.240 --> 2:31:41.640]  brim but i will be boycotting the mlb this year last year was probably the first year in my life
[2:31:41.640 --> 2:31:47.240]  i didn't go to a major league baseball game now granted that's because the stadiums were closed
[2:31:48.280 --> 2:31:54.200]  but i don't think i will be this year you want to take a knee to china you want to take a knee to
[2:31:54.200 --> 2:32:01.400]  the liberal mo woke mob i'm out i'm out not a dollar for me not a t-shirt not a ticket sale not
[2:32:01.400 --> 2:32:12.200]  an mlb tv subscription you get nothing but hey nice fake boycott of georgia real nice nobody
[2:32:12.200 --> 2:32:15.960]  could logically explain it but nobody could logically explain anything that the left does
[2:32:15.960 --> 2:32:25.560]  these days they've gone completely insane unless oh and i love this though the republicans ramp up
[2:32:25.560 --> 2:32:30.200]  attacks on corporations over georgia voting laws threatened consequences what mitch mcconnell that
[2:32:30.200 --> 2:32:38.120]  limp dick loser please that chicken gobbler neck loser he won't do anything that guy's a coward and
[2:32:38.120 --> 2:32:44.200]  a fraud so oh yeah republicans are really going to do something about the corporations guys
[2:32:46.040 --> 2:32:51.400]  yeah trump maybe would and some of the people that support him not mitch mcconnell that little guy
[2:32:51.400 --> 2:33:05.240]  that intellectual weasel but let's move on so you'd have to use humor you'd have to use irony
[2:33:05.240 --> 2:33:09.000]  to try to make sense of anything that the democrats are doing like this headline
[2:33:10.120 --> 2:33:19.560]  from the babel on b so parody but logically the parody works parents disguising kids as
[2:33:19.560 --> 2:33:23.800]  illegal immigrants so they can receive in-person teaching and it's got a little kid there with
[2:33:23.800 --> 2:33:27.640]  a little fake mustache and sombrero a little white boy that's probably racist by the way
[2:33:28.280 --> 2:33:32.920]  so that's probably racist on top of the irony showing how lunatic friends the democrats have
[2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:37.640]  become but no that's what you got to do that's what you got to do to be free i mean seriously
[2:33:37.640 --> 2:33:40.920]  if you were homeless in the united states of america why wouldn't you just go into one of
[2:33:40.920 --> 2:33:45.960]  these facilities oh wait we all know why because they're drug addicts but that's neither here nor
[2:33:45.960 --> 2:33:51.720]  there so your kids can't go to school in person learning you can't go to church but all of this
[2:33:51.720 --> 2:33:57.720]  is being facilitated at the illegal immigration facilities we played the video yesterday and
[2:33:57.720 --> 2:34:01.880]  it's not the only incident people getting kicked off of flights for not wearing the mask families
[2:34:01.880 --> 2:34:07.160]  being kicked off of flights because their kids a two-year-old is not wearing a mask but john carrey
[2:34:07.720 --> 2:34:12.600]  he gets to fly around the country not wearing a mask so john carrey who says global warming
[2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:17.720]  is killing us flies on planes as the biggest carbon footprint of anybody you know and doesn't
[2:34:17.720 --> 2:34:25.160]  wear a mask on a plane a total fraud a total criminal arrest john carrey but the good news is
[2:34:26.600 --> 2:34:32.920]  these abusive flight attendants that that are just again left-wing lunatics are being
[2:34:33.640 --> 2:34:40.200]  fired and removed from their jobs so why were why was that family being bullied on that plane
[2:34:40.200 --> 2:34:45.240]  yesterday on that spirit airlines flight why well they're never going to give you the why because
[2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:50.920]  we all know the why it was a liberal jerk it was a liberal a-hole that's what these people are man
[2:34:51.640 --> 2:34:57.000]  they ruin everything you want to avoid them at all costs and you can just sense them too can't you
[2:34:57.560 --> 2:35:01.240]  you can just sense them i can sense them when i'm at the store and i don't have my mask on i can
[2:35:01.240 --> 2:35:06.120]  see the look in their eyes they're so angry that i'm free and they're not at the restaurants
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:11.800]  on the airlines oh you can just sense a liberal can't you i mean you can just that's just the
[2:35:11.800 --> 2:35:21.400]  nastiness the hatred you can just sense it man they just ooze evil they just ooze resentment
[2:35:22.120 --> 2:35:27.080]  they just ooze hatred they just ooze racism they just ooze all these negative things that
[2:35:27.080 --> 2:35:32.440]  they claim to be fighting all right when we come back i'm going to finish up with these news headlines

[2:36:49.160 --> 2:36:54.200]  throughout history there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two
[2:36:54.200 --> 2:36:59.480]  one is born of renaissance the other is born of conquest one bases its power on having strong
[2:36:59.480 --> 2:37:05.800]  enlightened focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity art and skill and strength
[2:37:06.360 --> 2:37:11.960]  the other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny relief above it
[2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:17.640]  america is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom

[2:39:52.280 --> 2:39:55.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:40:08.840]  so many things developing including george floyd's drug dealer get this
[2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:18.680]  george floyd's drug dealer refuses to testify and says because he could potentially be held
[2:40:18.680 --> 2:40:23.240]  responsible for murder if he testified because he's the one that sold george floyd the drugs
[2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:32.040]  that he overdosed on so floyd's drug dealer admits that floyd died of a drug overdose wow
[2:40:33.800 --> 2:40:38.360]  but black lives matter already has their riot plans ready to go
[2:40:40.520 --> 2:40:42.840]  and shawman should not be guilty of murder
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:51.720]  but blm already threatened to burn down the city of minneapolis and other democrat cities they
[2:40:51.720 --> 2:40:54.600]  already said we'll burn these cities of the ground if you don't give us Derek Chauvin's
[2:40:54.600 --> 2:40:58.840]  head on a stick because these are terrorists that we're dealing with
[2:41:01.160 --> 2:41:05.800]  so that's amazing by the way forbes just released its new billionaires list
[2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:13.720]  donald trump has fallen 300 spots down that's what that man has sacrificed to try to save this
[2:41:13.720 --> 2:41:20.360]  country and all of you liars in media all of you liars in politics all of you liars that
[2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:25.560]  said he did this for self-enrichment he did this for them for himself you are sick sick puppies
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:31.400]  aren't you donald trump sacrificed everything to try to save this country and still is
[2:41:34.600 --> 2:41:39.720]  you eat these people couldn't even imagine sacrificing a fingernail
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:48.200]  for something more important than them they are complete stooges of the mainstream narrative
[2:41:48.200 --> 2:41:53.560]  they are complete stooges of the new world order and they hate trump because he's everything
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:41:58.920]  they wish they were he's successful he has a successful family he runs a successful business
[2:41:58.920 --> 2:42:03.080]  he's done it all on his own he was a great president he was the most popular president in
[2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:06.920]  modern history he was a great leader they hate everything about him because he's everything
[2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:14.520]  they could never be and yes he has made great sacrifice in his effort to save this country
[2:42:14.520 --> 2:42:22.600]  and i believe that there is more to come from donald trump meanwhile under biden everybody saw
[2:42:22.600 --> 2:42:29.720]  it coming dollars share of global currency reserves hits lowest level in over 25 years
[2:42:29.720 --> 2:42:37.160]  all by design so folks i'm telling you i don't know what the recovery from the biden catastrophe
[2:42:37.160 --> 2:42:41.320]  is going to look like but he will completely destroy our infrastructure they've already
[2:42:41.320 --> 2:42:47.000]  done it in texas it's already happened to california it'll come to new york it'll come to chicago
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:52.280]  it'll come to the big democrat run cities next they will shut your power off they will blow up
[2:42:52.280 --> 2:42:58.920]  your pipes next winter your infrastructure will be sabotaged they will tear down roads they will
[2:42:58.920 --> 2:43:05.400]  tear down highways biden's administration is coming to destroy your infrastructure it is an
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:14.280]  act of war by a foreign enemy except it's joe biden so they're crashing our economy they're
[2:43:14.280 --> 2:43:20.760]  crashing our currency they're opening our borders they're destroying our infrastructure
[2:43:22.520 --> 2:43:30.920]  they're taking our freedoms now you've had two tankers today block the suez canal so
[2:43:30.920 --> 2:43:38.120]  so something is happening here someone it seems wants the suez canal to be blocked
[2:43:38.840 --> 2:43:42.040]  and and and that was the one where the big tanker was there for like a week right did they even
[2:43:42.040 --> 2:43:48.280]  ever remove that one so they finally got rid of the big one and now two more today have
[2:43:48.280 --> 2:44:01.480]  blocked it what is going on in the suez canal that's wild uh meanwhile global net zero climate
[2:44:01.480 --> 2:44:09.720]  change targets are pie in the sky this story is at zeroheads.com and so basically this whole
[2:44:09.720 --> 2:44:17.080]  net zero carbon emission uh no climate change is literally impossible folks even if bill gates
[2:44:17.080 --> 2:44:23.240]  got his wish and all humans were dead he said that neteds talks even if bill gates got his wish
[2:44:23.240 --> 2:44:28.760]  and there were zero humans left climate change would still exist uh and there's multiple scientific
[2:44:28.760 --> 2:44:34.280]  examples of this like the vosdoc ice core samples that before human activity was even known on planet
[2:44:34.280 --> 2:44:40.840]  earth thousands of years before the industrial age there was more carbon in the atmosphere than
[2:44:40.840 --> 2:44:49.240]  there is today so yes manmade global warming is a lie and a myth at least the way they're telling you
[2:44:49.240 --> 2:44:54.840]  it there is geoengineering happening where they spray stuff in the sky but they don't talk about that
[2:44:56.040 --> 2:45:02.520]  and there are some consequences to not properly monitoring some of the farmlands and and and
[2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:05.960]  not doing the back burning and taking care of some of the fields and you know we build we do
[2:45:05.960 --> 2:45:11.800]  big build big concrete jungles and there's a give and take to that but no the lies that we've been
[2:45:11.800 --> 2:45:19.240]  told about manmade climate change and the goals that they are presenting to try to save us from
[2:45:19.240 --> 2:45:28.840]  this are all lies and it's all pretty much just like this two plus two equals five organ department
[2:45:28.840 --> 2:45:34.920]  of education pushes course claiming math is racist because it requires a correct answer so it's now
[2:45:34.920 --> 2:45:40.600]  racist to have a correct answer so what are they really saying if they were if they were really
[2:45:40.600 --> 2:45:46.440]  saying what they wanted to say they'd say black people are too stupid so it's racist to have a
[2:45:46.440 --> 2:45:52.120]  right answer that's what they're saying that's what liberals are saying like when they say oh black
[2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:57.480]  people can't get a voter id brown people can't get a voter id why is that because they're racist
[2:45:57.480 --> 2:46:04.200]  they think you're stupid democrats are racist against black people and brown people and white
[2:46:04.200 --> 2:46:10.680]  people they're racist against everybody so now they're saying it's racist to have a right answer
[2:46:10.680 --> 2:46:15.000]  because i guess they don't think black or brown people can have a right answer that seems racist
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:18.760]  and they say it's racist to get a voter id because i guess they don't think black or brown people can
[2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:27.400]  get a voter id that's odd why are democrats and liberals such liars why are they such racists
[2:46:27.400 --> 2:46:35.480]  what is wrong with these people this is mass mental illness here's another lie uh gen sake
[2:46:35.480 --> 2:46:41.000]  yesterday said joe biden never said the mlb should move the all-star game actually we have it on tape
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:47.640]  he literally said the exact thing you know gen sake doesn't have a clue i think that that's pretty
[2:46:47.640 --> 2:46:54.280]  obvious but you know what i'm i give sake the benefit of the doubt how is he supposed to have
[2:46:54.280 --> 2:46:59.160]  any idea what's going on in the biden white house when biden doesn't have any idea what's going on
[2:46:59.160 --> 2:47:06.120]  in the biden white house i mean she's she's basically running blind so she has an impossible job
[2:47:06.120 --> 2:47:12.040]  now her problem is she's also a liar and a fraud and she helps cover up the crimes and the lies
[2:47:12.040 --> 2:47:16.600]  and and just the total disaster that the biden administration is so so she's allied with that
[2:47:16.600 --> 2:47:25.800]  she's interfaced with that so she chose that destiny but uh no i do somewhat defend sake
[2:47:25.800 --> 2:47:29.560]  in this she doesn't have a clue what's going on nobody's talking to her it's pretty obvious
[2:47:30.760 --> 2:47:34.520]  it's pretty obvious biden has no idea what's going on so how can sake have any idea what's
[2:47:34.520 --> 2:47:38.440]  going on so that's pretty much gen sake's life right there because you're looking at it
[2:47:41.640 --> 2:47:46.360]  and peter doucy is the only person that's allowed in the white house press corps from fox news that
[2:47:46.360 --> 2:47:50.360]  actually asked real question like people are saying where's chanel ryan from one american
[2:47:50.360 --> 2:47:55.240]  news network yeah she's banned from the biden press corps what do you think you think they're
[2:47:55.240 --> 2:48:04.200]  going to let a real journalist in there give me a break kamala harris had an event in her
[2:48:04.200 --> 2:48:13.000]  hometown of oakland did you know about this you didn't but she's so popular she's so cool she's so
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:24.280]  hip california loves kamala harris right wrong no supporters show up to greet 81 million vote
[2:48:24.280 --> 2:48:28.280]  recipient kamala harris as she returned to her hometown of oakland for the first time since
[2:48:28.280 --> 2:48:33.960]  inauguration there was more security there than supporters there were like three or four supporters
[2:48:33.960 --> 2:48:40.360]  and that's it so joe biden can't draw a crowd joe biden can't draw flies on a poo poo platter
[2:48:40.360 --> 2:48:50.280]  and kamala harris is just as unpopular the cackling demon witch by the way did you know
[2:48:50.280 --> 2:48:56.920]  that they just built her a resolute desk you're going to notice two behavioral malfunctions
[2:48:56.920 --> 2:49:02.840]  about kamala harris that show how insecure she really is she's always laughing and she always
[2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:09.480]  has her hands above her navel because she doesn't have a clue she's a moron so her way out of these
[2:49:09.480 --> 2:49:14.040]  uncomfortable situations where she doesn't have a clue is to laugh and to put her hands above her
[2:49:14.040 --> 2:49:20.520]  navel in in a confused state like she really doesn't know what's going on but uh yeah you're so popular
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:25.560]  biden can't draw a crowd anywhere harris can't draw a crowd anywhere nobody watches their youtube
[2:49:25.560 --> 2:49:30.600]  videos nobody watches their press conferences nobody shows up for their events they are losers
[2:49:30.600 --> 2:49:37.800]  they are cheaters they are liars they are criminals and this is the most unpopular
[2:49:37.800 --> 2:49:44.840]  administration this is the most unpopular white house in modern history now why is it that tim
[2:49:44.840 --> 2:49:50.920]  cook and apple are condemning the voter id law in florida when i can't even get onto my iphone
[2:49:50.920 --> 2:49:57.800]  without an id oh and look at that look how they're manipulating the likes and dislikes they always
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:50:03.400]  do that they always so really it's probably about 87 likes to about 3000 dislikes but youtube just
[2:50:03.400 --> 2:50:08.680]  erased us thousands of dislikes from the biden white house videos to cover up how unpopular he is
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:14.760]  and they know they cheated to win and that's the reason why the arizona maricopa county board of
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:20.920]  supervisors are delaying counting of their results and this is why raffensburger in georgia is refusing
[2:50:20.920 --> 2:50:25.960]  to turn over the votes for the audit the democrats and republicans that allied with the democrats
[2:50:25.960 --> 2:50:30.040]  in the new world order and the chinese communists cheated to win the 2020 election they've been caught
[2:50:30.040 --> 2:50:34.280]  they're criminals they belong in jail paul joseph watching coming up on the fourth hour of the alex

[2:51:43.800 --> 2:51:48.920]  would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity
[2:51:48.920 --> 2:51:53.800]  wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee
[2:51:53.800 --> 2:52:00.440]  and i have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away uh living defense saved my life
[2:52:00.440 --> 2:52:06.280]  they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back
[2:52:06.280 --> 2:52:12.680]  i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is matthew
[2:52:12.680 --> 2:52:20.520]  24 verse nine then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be
[2:52:20.520 --> 2:52:27.400]  hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another
[2:52:27.400 --> 2:52:32.600]  and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because god's name
[2:52:32.600 --> 2:52:36.840]  is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because
[2:52:36.840 --> 2:52:44.520]  god pray to this country you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:53.400]  this was a symbolic gesture only about 5000 participated for perspective on how many that is
[2:52:53.400 --> 2:52:57.640]  that is far fewer about half the number of troops that the democratic congress sent to
[2:52:57.640 --> 2:53:03.480]  washington this winter to protect itself from the imaginary qanon threat but for those with
[2:53:03.480 --> 2:53:09.080]  a vested interest in open borders virtually everyone in dc any military presence on our
[2:53:09.080 --> 2:53:14.200]  border was just too much it was intolerable official washington went berserk when he did it
[2:53:14.200 --> 2:53:18.360]  deploying troops to our own border for no national security reason is one of the biggest
[2:53:18.360 --> 2:53:24.600]  scandals of his presidency declared a senator from hawaii called brian shatz with what looked like
[2:53:24.600 --> 2:53:31.160]  carefully simulated outrage congressman philemon veila of texas who was then the head democrat
[2:53:31.160 --> 2:53:36.440]  on the subcommittee in charge of border security described trump's tiny troop deployment as a
[2:53:36.440 --> 2:53:42.920]  political ploy designed to quote appease his white nationalist supporters he was racist of course it
[2:53:42.920 --> 2:53:48.680]  was the so-called national security community claimed to be every bit as upset as their partners
[2:53:48.680 --> 2:53:54.920]  in the democratic party it's a craven misuse of the u.s. armed forces for an obvious political
[2:53:54.920 --> 2:54:01.640]  stunt said a former national security council staffer called kelly mags maximum and that turned
[2:54:01.640 --> 2:54:07.240]  out to be the right thing to say for ambitious young players in dc less than three years later
[2:54:07.240 --> 2:54:12.760]  kelly magsum is now chief of staff to the secretary of defense that would be the political activist
[2:54:12.760 --> 2:54:17.800]  and defense contractor loyte austin hotheaded congressman philemon veila meanwhile the one
[2:54:17.800 --> 2:54:24.120]  who charged racism has now ascended to vice chairmanship of the dnc so in washington there
[2:54:24.120 --> 2:54:30.040]  is always a real payoff for those willing to repeat the necessary slogans and then the border
[2:54:30.040 --> 2:54:35.640]  how is the border doing these days remember the border well the military our military is still
[2:54:35.640 --> 2:54:40.520]  involved in the immigration crisis but not in the ways that you might expect american troops are
[2:54:40.520 --> 2:54:46.200]  now occupied serving the needs not of americans but if foreign nationals who have flagrantly
[2:54:46.200 --> 2:54:51.960]  violated our laws the biden administration is turning our military bases into housing for
[2:54:51.960 --> 2:54:58.440]  illegal aliens if that sounds like a partisan attack something we just made up watch the president's
[2:54:58.440 --> 2:55:05.640]  own flak brag about it just in this past week we've taken steps to bring a number of new facilities
[2:55:05.640 --> 2:55:11.240]  online from fort bliss where there are 5000 beds to lackland air force base where there are 350
[2:55:11.240 --> 2:55:17.480]  beds sandiego convention center 1400 beds these three sites alone provided peak capacity and
[2:55:17.480 --> 2:55:27.160]  additional 66 750 beds so you break into our country and in return we give you free housing
[2:55:27.160 --> 2:55:33.480]  and medical care pretty generous what's interesting is to note who's not getting that treatment last
[2:55:33.480 --> 2:55:38.200]  night more than half a million americans spent the night in makeshift shelters or on the streets
[2:55:38.200 --> 2:55:43.480]  they're homeless but the biden administration isn't even considering the use of the u.s military to
[2:55:43.480 --> 2:55:49.240]  help them despite the fact that many are veterans instead the administration is boasting about all
[2:55:49.240 --> 2:55:55.080]  they're doing for the people who have demonstrated pure contempt for our system the system that some
[2:55:55.080 --> 2:56:00.440]  of us prefer and would like to preserve the press conference we just played a clip from was 10 days
[2:56:00.440 --> 2:56:05.880]  ago no one in the media seems to have bothered to follow up on that fort bliss for example headquarter
[2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:12.280]  in alpaso texas one of the largest army bases on the planet how many illegal aliens are now living
[2:56:12.280 --> 2:56:18.680]  at fort bliss how many are there right now and the truth is we don't know we asked authorities at
[2:56:18.680 --> 2:56:24.280]  fort bliss point blank that question today but they refused to tell us instead they referred us to
[2:56:24.280 --> 2:56:29.560]  their bosses in the biden administration to the political commissars america has no right to know
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:34.520]  how many illegal aliens are living on our military bases and neither by the way do elected members of
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:39.640]  congress who are charged with overseeing all of this but they can't know watch what happened when
[2:56:39.640 --> 2:56:46.440]  one of them tried to find out please give dignity to the people please give dignity to the people
[2:56:46.440 --> 2:56:50.120]  so you worked for the commissioner your senior advisor you were hired two weeks ago and you're
[2:56:50.120 --> 2:56:55.400]  instructed to ask us to not have any pictures taken here because the political leadership at
[2:56:55.400 --> 2:56:59.560]  dhs does not want the american people to know it please don't treat the people you're right
[2:56:59.560 --> 2:57:05.720]  and this is a dangerous place and your policies unfortunately are tried to hide them i understand
[2:57:05.720 --> 2:57:11.320]  you're instructed when 18 senators came down here respect the people give them dignity i respect
[2:57:11.320 --> 2:57:15.720]  them and i want to fix this situation we are going to be administration you're working for is
[2:57:15.720 --> 2:57:23.640]  responsible for these conditions please give dignity to the people squeaks the women's studies
[2:57:23.640 --> 2:57:28.120]  major from wesley and who's now overseeing all this somehow please respect the people
[2:57:28.840 --> 2:57:33.720]  she says meaning of course the foreign nationals whose interest the biden administration is now
[2:57:33.720 --> 2:57:41.160]  serving notice the total lack of respect for the american people the ones who deserve precise answers
[2:57:41.160 --> 2:57:46.520]  who deserve to see what's happening but don't get it they can shut up and pay for it
[2:57:51.480 --> 2:57:55.640]  granny do right granny do right thanks for holding her on the air go ahead challenge
[2:57:55.640 --> 2:58:01.800]  first of all let me say i love your products i am a granny and um for all the senior citizens
[2:58:01.800 --> 2:58:07.000]  out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up with sunspots or age
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:13.160]  spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is
[2:58:13.160 --> 2:58:19.960]  just really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already taking your other
[2:58:19.960 --> 2:58:24.520]  supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do because i just thought it
[2:58:24.520 --> 2:58:29.400]  was a hopeless situation but when i started taking it i mean it doesn't happen immediately but you
[2:58:29.400 --> 2:58:35.560]  know over a period of time i started noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is working
[2:58:35.560 --> 2:58:42.200]  this is wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know so anyway
[2:58:42.200 --> 2:58:59.880]  it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[2:59:12.920 --> 2:59:17.000]  where we are still a year after the first lockdown here in the uk
[2:59:18.040 --> 2:59:23.880]  still talking about the lockdown still under the lockdown and still under the lockdown in a
[2:59:23.880 --> 2:59:30.680]  permanent state until god knows when of course we supposedly got this roadmap out of lockdown that
[2:59:30.680 --> 2:59:36.520]  the prime minister is sticking to but then one questioned about whether it will actually end
[2:59:36.520 --> 2:59:44.280]  that's another matter entirely we've got a checklist of dates the 12th of april is when
[2:59:44.280 --> 2:59:52.440]  outdoor dining outdoor pubs are open the 17th of may is when indoor dining indoor pubs are open
[2:59:53.800 --> 2:59:57.960]  but now there are questions over that there are questions whether masks whether social distancing
[2:59:57.960 --> 3:00:03.640]  will still be required there are questions over when this will end if ever with sage the government
[3:00:03.640 --> 3:00:10.840]  advisors basically saying that they want it to continue for another year at least meanwhile in
[3:00:10.840 --> 3:00:15.880]  texas which dropped its mask mandate and social distancing back on march 10th and they've had
[3:00:16.440 --> 3:00:20.040]  giant baseball games they're actually enjoying life they're actually living life
[3:00:20.840 --> 3:00:26.200]  covid cases have dropped to a record low and they continue to drop i refer to this article
[3:00:26.200 --> 3:00:31.560]  out of summit news from a week ago two weeks after media predicted catastrophe texas sees
[3:00:31.560 --> 3:00:38.040]  covid cases drop to record low this was of course just over two weeks actually since
[3:00:38.840 --> 3:00:44.760]  march 10th which they initially released as the first date where people could rip off their masks
[3:00:44.760 --> 3:00:50.040]  and disavow social distancing the numbers were good then and they're even better now
[3:00:51.160 --> 3:00:55.880]  there's a national file headline here from today which has the latest numbers from texas
[3:00:55.880 --> 3:01:01.480]  as headline texas covid cases dropped to record lows after scrapping mask mandate
[3:01:03.320 --> 3:01:08.200]  says the number of new texas covid cases has dropped to a record low on the year in the week
[3:01:08.200 --> 3:01:13.560]  since the state moved to scrap mask mandates despite hysterical warnings from mainstream media
[3:01:13.560 --> 3:01:19.240]  and the biden regime that ditching the masks would result in mass casualties i'm going to
[3:01:19.240 --> 3:01:23.640]  flash back to what those warnings were but first we're going to play this clip of dr. Fauci
[3:01:23.640 --> 3:01:30.840]  when he was asked about the plummeting cases in texas now at record low weeks after the mask
[3:01:30.840 --> 3:01:38.200]  mandate was basically kicked into touch this is his response during an appearance on cnn let's
[3:01:38.200 --> 3:01:44.200]  roll the dr. Fauci clip here it is mentioned texas and that full ballpark in arlington yesterday
[3:01:44.200 --> 3:01:49.320]  there was a lot of concern last month when texas effectively opened up dropped all those
[3:01:49.320 --> 3:01:55.320]  restrictions and said it's back to life and if you go to texas as you know it looks like 2019
[3:01:55.320 --> 3:02:01.160]  the restaurants and the bars are full and open the ballparks are full and yet we've seen cases
[3:02:01.160 --> 3:02:06.760]  and hospitalization since then continue to tick downward so what do you make of that as all of
[3:02:06.760 --> 3:02:13.000]  us look around and sort of try to consider how safe it is to get back to normal life yeah you
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:20.840]  know it's it can be confusing because you may see a lag and a delay because often you have to wait
[3:02:20.840 --> 3:02:26.920]  a few weeks before you see the effect of what you're doing right now you know there are a lot of
[3:02:26.920 --> 3:02:34.280]  things that go into that i mean when you say that they've they've had a lot of activity on the outside
[3:02:34.280 --> 3:02:39.560]  like ball games i'm not really quite sure it could be they're doing things outdoors you know it's
[3:02:39.560 --> 3:02:45.400]  very difficult to just one-on-one compare that you just have to see in the long range i hope they
[3:02:45.400 --> 3:02:51.400]  continue to tick down if they do that would be great but there's always the concern when you
[3:02:51.400 --> 3:02:57.880]  pull back on methods particularly things like indoor dining and bars that are crowded you can
[3:02:57.880 --> 3:03:04.120]  see a delay and then all of a sudden tick right back up we've been fooled before by situations
[3:03:04.120 --> 3:03:09.720]  where people begin to open up nothing happens and then all of a sudden several weeks later
[3:03:09.720 --> 3:03:14.440]  things start exploding on you so we've got to be careful we don't prematurely judge that
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:22.200]  you've been pretty clear of that so again Fauci says there needs to be a wait a delay of at least
[3:03:22.200 --> 3:03:29.000]  a few weeks until we can gauge the actual impact of releasing those social distancing those mask
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:36.520]  restrictions there has been a delay of three weeks in fact now it's nearly four weeks it's 27 days
[3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:44.920]  since that mandate was lifted and cases in texas have dropped to all-time lows since they reopened
[3:03:44.920 --> 3:03:52.600]  100 in texas the number of new cases deaths hospitalizations icu occupancy and positivity
[3:03:52.600 --> 3:04:00.120]  rate have all fallen reports zero hedge and this article dr. Fauci can't explain why texas COVID
[3:04:00.120 --> 3:04:05.720]  cases keep dropping despite reopening and then when you look at all the major european countries
[3:04:05.720 --> 3:04:11.880]  which i've pointed out before when they institute those mask mandates in the middle of summer last
[3:04:11.880 --> 3:04:22.600]  year COVID cases in France in belgium in germany in spain in italy even in the uk all shot up and
[3:04:22.600 --> 3:04:27.320]  yet we're supposed to believe that masks are this great protection and that now we need to wear
[3:04:27.320 --> 3:04:34.440]  three four five six seven masks because they're working so well texas has had three weeks of no
[3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:41.560]  mask mandates more than three weeks now and the cases continue to plummet but dr. Fauci will get
[3:04:41.560 --> 3:04:47.560]  up on cnn say oh we need to wait a few weeks yeah we have we have and the numbers just keep going
[3:04:47.560 --> 3:04:53.080]  lower and lower they want this to continue forever when they see statistics which show
[3:04:53.880 --> 3:04:59.800]  COVID cases are plummeting less people are dying they hate it they hate it because it's another
[3:04:59.800 --> 3:05:06.120]  movement towards them giving up that power giving up that control and now we're seeing that in the
[3:05:06.120 --> 3:05:12.440]  uk and i'm gonna get into that in the next segment with this debate over vaccine passports which
[3:05:12.440 --> 3:05:18.760]  thankfully looks to be going by the wayside because the opposition party labor party for the first
[3:05:18.760 --> 3:05:25.960]  time in over a year of these lockdowns look like they may be about to act like an actual opposition
[3:05:25.960 --> 3:05:33.400]  party and oppose the government can you believe it there's a headline here out of lockdown skeptics
[3:05:33.400 --> 3:05:40.360]  it says meanwhile in texas and it says while go slow boris johnson talks about keeping masks and
[3:05:40.360 --> 3:05:46.440]  social distancing in place for another year at least i'm going to get on to that this was the
[3:05:46.440 --> 3:05:54.360]  scene in texas this is tweeted by sam gannon a sports reporter for kwf box four a packed stadium
[3:05:54.360 --> 3:06:00.120]  for a baseball game no vaccine passport required not a mask inside this is what's being taken
[3:06:00.120 --> 3:06:06.120]  place in texas for the past three weeks the cases continue to plummet and we look at south
[3:06:06.120 --> 3:06:13.240]  dakota again this is out of lockdown skeptics today south dakota the least restrictive state in the
[3:06:13.240 --> 3:06:20.120]  western world yet covid deaths now averaging one a day so as i noted back in march south dakota
[3:06:20.120 --> 3:06:26.040]  may have taken the least restrictive approach to covid 19 of anywhere in the entire western world
[3:06:26.040 --> 3:06:31.000]  this conservative governor christie gnome has been a stalwart opponent of lockdowns when the
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:36.040]  state's epidemic versioned at the end of august there were practically no restrictions in place
[3:06:36.600 --> 3:06:42.040]  despite this case numbers fell rapidly after reaching a peak in mid november and by late
[3:06:42.040 --> 3:06:48.760]  february they were in the low triple digits and it goes through the graphs asking how was it fared
[3:06:48.760 --> 3:06:54.840]  since then case numbers have remained low averaging about 170 to per day deaths have
[3:06:54.840 --> 3:07:01.640]  continued to fall the last seven days or an average of just one death per day in south dakota
[3:07:01.640 --> 3:07:07.720]  again one of the least restrictive areas of the western world when it comes to mask mandates and
[3:07:08.520 --> 3:07:15.800]  mandatory social distancing also points out south dakota's economy has done economically better than
[3:07:15.800 --> 3:07:22.520]  other western states the equation between gdp unemployment human life there is of course a
[3:07:22.520 --> 3:07:30.760]  very tight correlation between poverty shortening people's lives that's not a problem in south dakota
[3:07:31.800 --> 3:07:39.160]  it has the lowest unemployment rate out of all 50 states at just 2.9 percent and that will eventually
[3:07:39.160 --> 3:07:46.680]  end up saving lives it will end up prolonging lives unlike the uk for example where our gdp
[3:07:46.680 --> 3:07:55.080]  plunged by 10 last year alone and now we're being told by the vaunted government advisors of sage
[3:07:55.080 --> 3:08:02.200]  that it's not going to end anytime soon meanwhile breaking abut signs weak executive order that
[3:08:02.200 --> 3:08:09.080]  doesn't stop businesses from requiring vaccine passports of course governor disancis in florida
[3:08:09.080 --> 3:08:14.520]  did sign an executive order which abolished those it directly prevented businesses from
[3:08:14.520 --> 3:08:20.680]  mandating mask wearing but now texas governor greg abut seemingly banned vaccine passports
[3:08:20.680 --> 3:08:27.160]  with an executive order today yet private businesses can still require whatever documentation they
[3:08:27.160 --> 3:08:34.040]  choose so they're not actually banned from demanding covid vaccine passports as the condition
[3:08:34.040 --> 3:08:38.040]  of entry which i'm going to get on to in the next segment they're not just vaccine passports
[3:08:38.040 --> 3:08:48.520]  but biosecurity digital item summit on you actually bought this at blocks uhf frequency
[3:08:48.520 --> 3:08:54.920]  snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us not just tracking and
[3:08:54.920 --> 3:09:03.640]  recording our gps location but recording audio and video as well with or without a battery now
[3:09:03.640 --> 3:09:11.400]  with the info wars privacy pouch you can go dark wherever you choose excellent now i have my own

[3:09:20.760 --> 3:09:29.080]  agencies identity thieves tech giants and now contact tracers are all tracking your every move

[3:09:46.200 --> 3:09:53.400]  the equation is very simple the mega banks control the media they control big pharma they control
[3:09:53.400 --> 3:10:00.520]  academia they control the military industrial complex they control big tech and everywhere
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:05.640]  that they have been in control in the third world they have established absolute total
[3:10:05.640 --> 3:10:13.320]  despotism and dehumanization it is the western christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:18.200]  and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them so because they can't
[3:10:18.200 --> 3:10:26.360]  defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down and use the idea of equality
[3:10:26.360 --> 3:10:32.200]  to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopoly some control
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:37.480]  that's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them
[3:10:37.480 --> 3:10:42.840]  but the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video
[3:10:42.840 --> 3:10:52.120]  so we double your efforts we're all in this together you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:06.520]  transmitting worldwide from the summit dot new studios in the united kingdom you're listening
[3:11:06.520 --> 3:11:14.360]  to her joseph watson i'm going to throw straight to this report right now because it just went up
[3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:19.720]  a couple of hours ago the truth about the vaccine passport it's not just a vaccine passport it's a
[3:11:19.720 --> 3:11:26.360]  biosecurity digital id card and it's the introduction of the chinese social credit score in the west
[3:11:26.360 --> 3:11:30.360]  we're going to get a chance to play most of this i'll come back after and talk about it
[3:11:30.360 --> 3:11:40.840]  here is the truth about vaccine passports there's currently a big debate on both sides of the
[3:11:40.840 --> 3:11:46.840]  atlantic about the vaccine passport no not the vaccine i'm not talking about the vaccine
[3:11:46.840 --> 3:11:52.120]  i'm talking about the vaccine passport according to the uk government covid passports will
[3:11:52.120 --> 3:11:57.960]  quote become a likely feature of our lives this is what a mock-up of the vaccine passport looks
[3:11:57.960 --> 3:12:04.760]  like name photograph date of birth kind of reminds me of something something that starts with id
[3:12:04.760 --> 3:12:11.800]  an ending card oh yeah it's a digital id card the same thing that in 2004 borris johnson said was
[3:12:11.800 --> 3:12:38.760]  quote a recipe for tyranny and oppression so what changed borris there are also plans to link it
[3:12:38.760 --> 3:12:43.960]  to the facial recognition surveillance network the uk government has already given grants to two
[3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:49.400]  companies building this technology andrew budd the ceo of one of these companies i prove asserts
[3:12:49.400 --> 3:12:55.160]  that trying to check tens of thousands of vaccine passports at major events will be too slow so digital
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:13:00.440]  face scans which permit entry will be introduced as the streamlined solution and there you were
[3:13:00.440 --> 3:13:05.640]  thinking you'd happily show a small piece of paper to get into a football match without knowing you
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:23.080]  just unwittingly stumbled into the minority report
[3:13:23.080 --> 3:13:36.760]  China which has universally been praised by health authorities and governments in the west for its
[3:13:36.760 --> 3:13:42.840]  response to the covid outbreak has already linked its coronavirus tracking program to its social
[3:13:42.840 --> 3:13:47.720]  credit score system the idea that this could for example be used for totalitarian social
[3:13:47.720 --> 3:13:53.880]  monitoring well this has now become a reality in china the local government of china's jiang su
[3:13:53.880 --> 3:14:00.200]  province has launched a new social control system that combines a ccp's health code program with
[3:14:00.200 --> 3:14:06.440]  the regime's social credit system to create what they're calling a quote civilization code this new
[3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:12.120]  system gives people a civilization score which ranks them into different levels and this level
[3:14:12.120 --> 3:14:17.080]  is then used by the government to judge who gets priority or who should be subjected to
[3:14:17.080 --> 3:14:22.840]  restrictions or punishments what is the social credit score system it's a centralized database
[3:14:22.840 --> 3:14:28.760]  linked to internet activity purchase history and general behavior which punishes citizens for a
[3:14:28.760 --> 3:14:34.760]  whole host of minor infractions including bad driving smoking on trains buying too many video
[3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:39.640]  games buying too much junk food buying too much alcohol calling a friend who has a low social
[3:14:39.640 --> 3:14:45.800]  credit score having a friend online who has a low social credit score posting fake news online
[3:14:45.800 --> 3:14:51.320]  visiting unauthorized websites walking your dog without leash or letting your dog bark too much
[3:14:51.320 --> 3:14:57.400]  and how do the authorities punish those who commit these deadly sins in 2019 beijing bragged about
[3:14:57.400 --> 3:15:04.440]  how it had prevented 2.5 million discredited entities from purchasing plane tickets and 90
[3:15:04.440 --> 3:15:33.800]  thousand people from buying high-speed train tickets in the month of july alone and what what is it
[3:15:33.800 --> 3:15:47.400]  sir that's reserved for members of our prime flight program you got to be a 4.2 or over to
[3:15:47.400 --> 3:15:56.360]  qualify oh i'm i'm a 4.2 i'm afraid you're actually a 4.183 the very same kind of restrictions that
[3:15:56.360 --> 3:16:01.960]  will be imposed on people in the west who don't have the vaccine passport recall that professor
[3:16:01.960 --> 3:16:07.640]  neil ferguson one of the primary uk advisors whose warning of half a million debt led to our
[3:16:07.640 --> 3:16:13.640]  lockdown express surprised that they were able to get away with mimicking the draconian measures
[3:16:13.640 --> 3:16:19.320]  taken by china in response to the pandemic and according to the founder of data firm panda the
[3:16:19.320 --> 3:16:25.880]  chinese government has even asked the who for permission to run a global vaccine passport system
[3:16:25.880 --> 3:16:31.880]  i'm motivated here by fear for what is going to happen to our world to the fabric of our society
[3:16:32.680 --> 3:16:38.040]  i'm worried about the future of my children china is petitioning the wealth health organization
[3:16:38.920 --> 3:16:42.920]  to appoint it to run a global immune passport program
[3:16:45.640 --> 3:16:49.160]  now if that doesn't scare the living daylights out of you i do not know what will
[3:16:49.160 --> 3:16:58.600]  that this kind of centralization this kind of control social credit systems
[3:16:59.960 --> 3:17:04.920]  that's the stop here for you prominent figures like ian brown who publicly opposed the vaccine
[3:17:04.920 --> 3:17:10.120]  passport are immediately targeted for cancellation by the mob the most prominent supporter of
[3:17:10.120 --> 3:17:16.120]  vaccine passports from the very start was tony blair who as i'm sure you're aware isn't noted
[3:17:16.120 --> 3:17:21.000]  for his moral beneficence journalists for mainstream news outlets like the la times harry
[3:17:21.000 --> 3:17:28.360]  litman are salivating at the prospect of imposing the vaccine passport to quote break the resistance
[3:17:28.360 --> 3:17:33.640]  down litman's comment sounds like something an evil character in a dystopian thriller about a
[3:17:33.640 --> 3:17:39.240]  high-tech dictatorship would say and that's precisely the point the vaccine passport is the
[3:17:39.240 --> 3:17:45.880]  opening salvo of what eventually could become the chinese social credit system mirrored in the west
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:55.880]  the vaccine passport platform is the same platform as a social credit system in china the ccp can find
[3:17:55.880 --> 3:18:05.400]  any dissident in five minutes because of the 360 degree surveillance of the social credit system
[3:18:05.400 --> 3:18:13.080]  and it means that when you act like a good citizen you get a boost and when you act like a bad
[3:18:13.080 --> 3:18:17.800]  citizen opportunities get closed to you maybe your child doesn't get into college or get into
[3:18:18.680 --> 3:18:22.440]  prep school maybe you know you don't get that job you don't get that promotion
[3:18:23.880 --> 3:18:31.000]  the vaccine passport that is being proposed in the rest of the west is the same platform this is
[3:18:31.000 --> 3:18:38.040]  the most dangerous tool that humanity has faced in my lifetime if not ever in terms of human
[3:18:38.040 --> 3:18:43.720]  liberty so you don't have to be an ardent anti-vaxxer to realize what a horrific precedent the
[3:18:43.720 --> 3:18:49.240]  vaccine passport would set fine get the vaccine i'm sure it's perfectly logical for someone under
[3:18:49.240 --> 3:18:55.240]  the age of 50 who according to the cdc has a 99.98 percent chance of surviving covet to take the
[3:18:55.240 --> 3:19:01.320]  vaccine but a vaccine passport the digital id card based on your level of compliance with
[3:19:01.320 --> 3:19:06.360]  government mandates empowering the state to restrict the basic freedoms of those who for
[3:19:06.360 --> 3:19:12.200]  whatever reason don't fully comply keeping millions of people under a de facto permanent
[3:19:12.200 --> 3:19:17.400]  state of lockdown preventing them from enjoying basic leisure activities and god knows what
[3:19:17.400 --> 3:19:22.120]  else in the future don't forget france even tried to pass a law banning those who didn't take the
[3:19:22.120 --> 3:19:27.560]  jab from using public transport a german geneticist said people who refuse the shot should be denied
[3:19:27.560 --> 3:19:32.920]  medical treatment canada's current chief public health officer appeared in a 2010 documentary
[3:19:32.920 --> 3:19:38.920]  in which he advocated using mandatory tracking bracelets for people who refused to take a vaccine
[3:19:38.920 --> 3:19:43.400]  after a virus outbreak if there are people who are non-compliant there are definitely
[3:19:43.960 --> 3:19:49.800]  laws and you know listeners calling to the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:19:50.520 --> 3:19:55.640]  because i sit there and i beg you for support constantly you go into prayer for financial
[3:19:55.640 --> 3:20:01.240]  support for word of mouth and then we're all this together and i you know it gets old having to come
[3:20:01.240 --> 3:20:05.240]  to you and say hey i got great products please bomb or we won't be here on air but it's true
[3:20:05.240 --> 3:20:08.760]  we're the only media organization in the united states that promotes liberty at this level
[3:20:09.400 --> 3:20:13.720]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down everybody
[3:20:13.720 --> 3:20:18.360]  else they crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order
[3:20:18.360 --> 3:20:22.840]  comes out and be open our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be taken off there that's
[3:20:22.840 --> 3:20:27.640]  why america has got to be taken down you can't have all these other nations enslaved and america

[3:21:40.360 --> 3:21:52.520]  dot com i knew trump was in battle i knew he was surrounded by cowards and my double talking
[3:21:52.520 --> 3:21:59.800]  agents of the enemy and a lot of people just couldn't believe it right oh no it's 3g chest
[3:21:59.800 --> 3:22:04.520]  5g chest he's invincible and i understand why people are to believe that because this is scary
[3:22:04.520 --> 3:22:08.520]  what's going on the global government the new world order and now that people woke up in fact
[3:22:08.520 --> 3:22:13.640]  that's real they won't somebody to come save them from well trump sure it's held pride my gosh look
[3:22:13.640 --> 3:22:18.200]  at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadruple depending on the drug once you find
[3:22:18.200 --> 3:22:23.080]  that executive order we pay the most of anybody in the world that's just one case of hundreds of
[3:22:23.080 --> 3:22:28.280]  things that trumpet reversed and now people are going to feel the sting of the pain the energy
[3:22:28.280 --> 3:22:33.400]  cost everything else but what's really illustrated this is the trial to the senate where trump's
[3:22:33.400 --> 3:22:38.200]  own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just
[3:22:38.200 --> 3:22:44.360]  engage all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in folks the swamp is deep trump fought it
[3:22:44.360 --> 3:22:51.720]  but it's up to us to win it epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free
[3:22:51.720 --> 3:22:57.160]  speech and freedom of association and they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other
[3:22:57.160 --> 3:23:02.520]  major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering that's why they've
[3:23:02.520 --> 3:23:07.720]  been massively expanding their services so whether you have domains or want to register a domain or
[3:23:07.720 --> 3:23:12.520]  want help building a website or want servers or any other major service they've got it all
[3:23:12.520 --> 3:23:18.280]  and they're expanding and if you go to info wars domains dot com and follow that link you get all
[3:23:18.280 --> 3:23:24.520]  their services at the lowest price and 25 percent of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you
[3:23:24.520 --> 3:23:29.640]  move goes to fund the info war and then we get five percent as well for any servers or any other
[3:23:29.640 --> 3:23:34.920]  type of services that you get from them so it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet
[3:23:34.920 --> 3:23:40.680]  again because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free so info wars domains
[3:23:40.680 --> 3:23:45.640]  dot com the revolution starts there info wars domains dot com take action now
[3:23:48.920 --> 3:23:51.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:23:51.560 --> 3:24:09.240]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for you
[3:24:09.240 --> 3:24:16.280]  in mind
[3:24:16.280 --> 3:24:23.720]  we're here outside mccallant texas in donna at the main donna facility that's being massively
[3:24:23.720 --> 3:24:34.360]  expanded this facility is the largest admitted human traveling child trafficking facility
[3:24:34.360 --> 3:24:42.200]  in the world obama started this eight years ago halfway into his administration
[3:24:43.640 --> 3:24:48.440]  but when the senate put out reports admitting that they were giving children to smugglers inside the
[3:24:48.440 --> 3:24:55.320]  us and encouraging smugglers to bring children in many of them kidnapped even obama had to
[3:24:55.320 --> 3:25:03.400]  back off the program and stop it then trump got in and reversed the program and completely shut it
[3:25:03.400 --> 3:25:13.000]  down we're now only two and a half months into puppet obiton and puppet obiton the puppet of
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:18.600]  obama and the globalist fighting the puppet administration not the guy playing mario kart
[3:25:18.600 --> 3:25:25.400]  in the basement his old pedophile days are over his smelling all the girls and grabbing all women
[3:25:25.400 --> 3:25:31.800]  in public you know that's over he's barely alive but the office is a un globalist operation
[3:25:31.800 --> 3:25:38.840]  and that puppet said if i win the election when i steal the election i want you to search the border
[3:25:39.640 --> 3:25:46.040]  search the border and now yesterday six months later he congratulates you and says it's the
[3:25:46.040 --> 3:25:52.840]  american dream to sneak over here to be taken here by smugglers to be kidnapped again and i
[3:25:52.840 --> 3:26:00.680]  congratulate you on your courage coming for as far away as the middle east including two men on the
[3:26:00.680 --> 3:26:10.360]  terrorist watch list we have terrorist out of iran terrorist out of syria both connected to al-qaeda
[3:26:10.360 --> 3:26:19.000]  isis and the iranians with their hesbua and now that's what you do that's what you've allowed
[3:26:19.800 --> 3:26:26.360]  and you've conscripted the border patrol that didn't sign up for this to help carry out your
[3:26:26.360 --> 3:26:35.640]  criminal operations now the beta test for this was europe the last 10 years more than 10 million
[3:26:35.640 --> 3:26:46.120]  illegal aliens mainly military hmen were brought in by the un with marco and with the rest of them
[3:26:46.120 --> 3:26:52.280]  inviting the people in and say come here we'll give you free welfare we'll give you a house
[3:26:52.280 --> 3:27:03.320]  and they even threw spanish and greeks and italians and germans and dutch out of their houses that
[3:27:03.320 --> 3:27:11.640]  they owned to put the invaders from africa and the middle east end it's called replacement migration
[3:27:11.640 --> 3:27:22.440]  and now the un says they want 600 plus million illegals brought in by 2050 and at this pace they'll
[3:27:22.440 --> 3:27:33.160]  do it adding an entire chicago sized city with illegals alone every year and now talking to local
[3:27:33.160 --> 3:27:41.320]  law enforcement they say this is 10 times the surge that they've ever seen 10 times what it was
[3:27:41.320 --> 3:27:50.120]  under obama and now it's going to get 10 times worse and 10 times worse after that so the border
[3:27:50.120 --> 3:28:02.040]  is completely gone this is the depth of america this is the leftist takeover bringing in a third
[3:28:02.040 --> 3:28:09.240]  world population on underclass they can keep control of they can keep them down and that they
[3:28:09.240 --> 3:28:16.920]  could rule over and who will also vote like they voted is that is way love to bring in a dictatorship
[3:28:18.600 --> 3:28:30.360]  hitler was elected as well people forget that you are here by unnoticed this is an illegal child
[3:28:30.360 --> 3:28:40.840]  human trafficking facility or biden has not even signed an executive order because it will be overturned
[3:28:40.840 --> 3:28:50.040]  by the courts because it's illegal so instead he just gives executive directives to open the
[3:28:50.040 --> 3:28:58.120]  border and he tells the smugglers to search with the human trafficking and then he congratulates
[3:28:58.120 --> 3:29:04.440]  the smugglers on what they've done the democrats are globalists they have every major corporation
[3:29:05.160 --> 3:29:11.480]  they have all the media all the banks all the universities all the federal agencies and most
[3:29:11.480 --> 3:29:22.360]  the city under blue city control under blue city control and everywhere that follows everything
[3:29:22.360 --> 3:29:34.360]  collapses you are the establishment leftist you are not the resistance we the people of america
[3:29:34.360 --> 3:29:44.360]  and the world are the resistance to your united nations globalist operation and the answer to
[3:29:44.360 --> 3:29:55.560]  your charity is seventeen seventy six humanity must fight back and those watching this need to
[3:29:55.560 --> 3:30:01.560]  know that you are the rest of the equation big tech thinks they can win if they can block our
[3:30:01.560 --> 3:30:08.520]  communications but if you simply take this and share this from band on video and the live streams
[3:30:08.520 --> 3:30:12.680]  on your text message and your email you can still share there and tell people pass it on
[3:30:12.680 --> 3:30:19.880]  we're covering the collapse of our country and the globalist plan to take down our nation
[3:30:21.960 --> 3:30:29.160]  this facility is like a boiling downhill of eighteen wheelers and dump trucks expanding it
[3:30:29.160 --> 3:30:37.960]  so it can hold more than the ten thousand that it can now this is only the beginning of the collapse
[3:30:37.960 --> 3:30:44.920]  of our country having poor children many of them being delivered into sex slavery
[3:30:46.680 --> 3:30:55.320]  all of you inside that are not aware of this need to research it there's a senate report
[3:30:55.320 --> 3:31:02.040]  that you're involved in human trafficking and sex slavery don't be part of the human

[3:31:36.760 --> 3:31:45.000]  slave trade because democrats get these children and they milk them for money by putting them
[3:31:45.000 --> 3:31:50.920]  on welfare catholic charities all the big charities are criminal operations when they're
[3:31:50.920 --> 3:32:10.200]  involved in this and must be exposed info wars info wars dot com info wars dot com info wars dot

[3:32:31.800 --> 3:32:38.520]  as it regards the implementation of that we have another example though of the elite the wealthy
[3:32:38.520 --> 3:32:43.640]  the government ministers not following their own lockdown their own core coronavirus restrictions
[3:32:43.640 --> 3:32:48.120]  that they impose on everyone else of course we've had many examples of that both in america and in
[3:32:48.120 --> 3:32:53.800]  the united kingdom now we have one out of friends headline french elite court violating lockdown
[3:32:53.800 --> 3:32:59.480]  rules by attending secret restaurants even as prisons continue to struggle under lockdown

[3:33:05.160 --> 3:33:11.160]  attending rule-breaking secret restaurants in the french capital so the french tv channel m6

[3:37:48.920 --> 3:37:51.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:37:51.560 --> 3:38:03.960]  you're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[3:38:07.640 --> 3:38:11.720]  so for the past six months the uk government told the british people that there were no
[3:38:11.720 --> 3:38:18.360]  plans whatsoever to introduce domestic back theme passports went to pubs went to restaurants went
[3:38:18.360 --> 3:38:24.840]  to cinemas went to sporting events music venues and it turns out that they were funding the very
[3:38:24.840 --> 3:38:30.360]  company building the technology behind those programs technology that is linked with facial
[3:38:30.360 --> 3:38:38.200]  recognition software technology but then they said oh don't worry when the pubs open on april 12th
[3:38:38.200 --> 3:38:44.840]  for outdoor drinking dining when the pubs open on may 17 for indoor drinking and dining you won't
[3:38:44.840 --> 3:38:51.960]  require a vaccine passport then it comes out today after boris johnson's shambolic press
[3:38:51.960 --> 3:38:57.640]  conference last night that oh well maybe you will need one because that by that point they'll
[3:38:57.640 --> 3:39:03.000]  have grease the skids they'll have got the technology in place the reason they can't let
[3:39:03.000 --> 3:39:10.360]  a vaccine passport be mandated for pubs right now is because hardly anyone in the united kingdom
[3:39:10.360 --> 3:39:17.160]  under the age of 50 has taken the coronavirus vaccine it hasn't been offered to them the vast
[3:39:17.160 --> 3:39:24.280]  majority of people who work in pubs in the united kingdom are under the age of 50 so the only reason
[3:39:24.280 --> 3:39:28.840]  that they couldn't implement this immediately is because the employees who would have to enter the
[3:39:28.840 --> 3:39:34.360]  pub to serve people wouldn't be able to do so because they wouldn't have a vaccine passport
[3:39:34.360 --> 3:39:39.640]  because none of them have taken the vaccine that's why it's not being implemented now
[3:39:39.640 --> 3:39:45.480]  not because there are no plans to implement it whatsoever and in fact the vaccine minister came
[3:39:45.480 --> 3:39:51.560]  out today and said no we're still considering it in fact the very documents that they released
[3:39:51.560 --> 3:39:57.880]  to the media as part of this vaccine passport announcement say that it's still under consideration
[3:39:57.880 --> 3:40:04.600]  for pubs and restaurants later on in the summer when those under 50s will many of them have been
[3:40:04.600 --> 3:40:11.080]  vaccinated and potentially have these vaccine passports the point is it's not just the vaccine
[3:40:11.080 --> 3:40:18.280]  passport it's a bio identity card it's not just a piece of paper that says you've had the vaccine
[3:40:18.280 --> 3:40:23.560]  it's got your digital photograph on it it's got your date of birth on it it's got your name on it
[3:40:23.560 --> 3:40:31.480]  it's an id card and it's going to be linked in to a prototype social credit score system the very
[3:40:31.480 --> 3:40:39.000]  same system that they've linked in china to their own covid tracking technology the upshot of that
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:45.080]  of course is the people who don't comply for a start with this vaccination this mandatory medical
[3:40:45.080 --> 3:40:51.000]  government procedure and later on for whatever else the government wants to foist upon us those
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:55.960]  who don't comply will be punished they're already punished in china under the social credit score
[3:40:55.960 --> 3:41:02.520]  they're banned from buying plane and train tickets they're banned from using public transportation
[3:41:02.520 --> 3:41:08.760]  that is the exact same system we see being rolled out in the west it's the exact same system being
[3:41:08.760 --> 3:41:16.520]  rolled out by the biden administration so let's call it what it is it's a digital bio identity
[3:41:16.520 --> 3:41:23.160]  card it's not just a vaccine passport headline out of the spectator and there is a big white
[3:41:23.160 --> 3:41:28.840]  pill on this which i'll get on to johnson is in trouble over vaccine passports and it's showing
[3:41:29.640 --> 3:41:34.120]  the biggest question facing boris johnson is the future of his so-called vaccine passports a few
[3:41:34.120 --> 3:41:41.400]  months ago the idea was dismissed as discriminatory and again that's the other facet the reason it
[3:41:41.400 --> 3:41:46.280]  might eventually get shot down is because there are so many illegal aliens in the united kingdom
[3:41:46.280 --> 3:41:51.080]  at least a million probably way more who don't want to have any interaction with the authorities
[3:41:51.080 --> 3:41:55.800]  and won't take a vaccine they won't take a vaccine passport and we can't discriminate against the
[3:41:55.800 --> 3:42:03.240]  precious illegal aliens can we matt hancock the health secretary a few months ago said quote we
[3:42:03.240 --> 3:42:08.920]  are not a papers-carrying country that apparently changed over the past six months but now without
[3:42:08.920 --> 3:42:14.360]  debate or democratic scrutiny vaccine passports are quickly heading from unthinkable to unstoppable
[3:42:15.560 --> 3:42:18.920]  so it's bizarrely the prime minister that's unable to admit to any of it
[3:42:18.920 --> 3:42:23.400]  despite having the government having released it in the media for days before
[3:42:24.360 --> 3:42:29.320]  and pretended to be confused by what he was being asked this matters if he cannot acknowledge his
[3:42:29.320 --> 3:42:33.720]  flagship scheme leaving such an indefensible gulf between what his government has just published
[3:42:33.720 --> 3:42:39.240]  and what he has just said he already may be in some political trouble and again they make the
[3:42:39.240 --> 3:42:44.600]  same point i've been making over the past several months his ministers use vaccine passport as a
[3:42:44.600 --> 3:42:50.200]  euphemism but even this sounded awful to him he corrected those who said passport referring
[3:42:50.200 --> 3:42:57.000]  instead to a covid status certification so they've just renamed it rebranded it but it's the exact
[3:42:57.000 --> 3:43:04.120]  same thing a certificate doesn't have someone's photo on it what he is planning is a digital
[3:43:04.120 --> 3:43:11.800]  identity card but linked to nhs records unloaded with personal health data so a bio identity card
[3:43:11.800 --> 3:43:18.440]  whatever they choose to call it that's precisely what it is and when they asked Boris Johnson
[3:43:19.080 --> 3:43:25.640]  if this would be required in pubs in restaurants he said quote the very important thing to say to
[3:43:25.640 --> 3:43:29.800]  everybody listening and watching is that there is absolutely no question of people being asked to
[3:43:29.800 --> 3:43:35.400]  produce certification or a covid status report when they go to the shops or to the pub garden
[3:43:35.400 --> 3:43:44.680]  or to the hairdressers or whatever on monday so again for days beforehand in the media they
[3:43:44.680 --> 3:43:50.120]  had leaks from the government apparently and we were assured we were assured that we would never
[3:43:50.680 --> 3:43:56.120]  never have to provide a vaccine passport to enter a shop to enter a pub to enter a restaurant
[3:43:56.680 --> 3:44:03.400]  now the government's saying well you won't for a couple of months until they get the scheme in
[3:44:03.400 --> 3:44:08.600]  place so again they denied it was a thing for the past six months then they denied it would be
[3:44:08.600 --> 3:44:13.560]  used to pubs restaurants and shops and now they're making those are that yes it will be required
[3:44:13.560 --> 3:44:19.560]  in a couple of months for pubs restaurants and shops they've lied about it at every turn to try
[3:44:19.560 --> 3:44:27.720]  and quell public resistance the polls still show that 80 percent of brits support mandatory vaccine
[3:44:27.720 --> 3:44:33.720]  passports to enter all of these kind of venues who they're polling in these surveys god only knows
[3:44:33.720 --> 3:44:39.960]  because that's not what i'm hearing anecdotally on the streets wherever you go whoever you talk to
[3:44:39.960 --> 3:44:44.600]  that's not what people are saying but apparently the vast majority of the public supports it
[3:44:44.600 --> 3:44:50.520]  would they support it if they knew precisely what it was given that we had a digital id card proposed
[3:44:50.520 --> 3:44:56.200]  by tony blare and the labor government back in 2004 which by the way the current prime minister
[3:44:56.200 --> 3:45:04.040]  borris johnson said would represent tyranny what has changed over the course of those years the
[3:45:04.040 --> 3:45:09.080]  white pill though is that the labor party the opposition party in the united kingdom may finally
[3:45:09.080 --> 3:45:15.240]  be about to grow a pair of balls for the first time in over a year and actually oppose a government
[3:45:15.240 --> 3:45:21.400]  policy as it relates to lockdown they've acted as a rubber stamp at every single turn of the way
[3:45:21.400 --> 3:45:27.560]  and in fact have demanded even more draconian lockdown policies well that may be about to
[3:45:27.560 --> 3:45:33.480]  change although this again is very much up in the air headline vaccine passport could face
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:40.120]  failure after reports labor set to oppose because vaccine passport could be set to fail if it goes
[3:45:40.120 --> 3:45:44.040]  up for a vote in parliament after reports the opposition party labor would not support the
[3:45:44.040 --> 3:45:49.720]  policy political playbook reports on the basis of what we've seen and discussed with ministers we
[3:45:49.720 --> 3:45:55.960]  oppose the government's plans for domestic vaccine passport that's from a labor source so if they
[3:45:55.960 --> 3:46:02.200]  have the Tory rebels within the conservative government oppose the vaccine passport added to
[3:46:02.200 --> 3:46:08.680]  the liberal democrat mps added to these labor mps the government is not going to have a big
[3:46:08.680 --> 3:46:15.240]  enough majority in parliament to pass the legislation that mandates these vaccine passports
[3:46:15.240 --> 3:46:20.600]  they could just say oh well it's already authorized to us under coronavirus legislation we've already
[3:46:20.600 --> 3:46:26.200]  passed they could go down that route but then that would increase public opposition as well
[3:46:26.920 --> 3:46:31.560]  so if labor do oppose it if there is a vote it looks like it will get shut down but that is a
[3:46:31.560 --> 3:46:38.280]  very long way off and of course we'd have another new battle to fear mongering over a third wave
[3:46:38.280 --> 3:46:45.560]  over a fourth wave of mutant viruses which we're all already seeing and in fact our esteemed government
[3:46:45.560 --> 3:46:51.720]  advisors with sage are saying that that's basically guaranteed to do the case in late summer in autumn
[3:46:51.720 --> 3:46:56.280]  and that these restrictions these mass mandates are never going to end they don't want them to
[3:46:56.280 --> 3:47:01.960]  end they want this to continue for years and years and years this is out of a lockdown skeptics
[3:47:01.960 --> 3:47:09.000]  imperial college who will be vital to emphasize the importance of normalizing and ensuring adherence
[3:47:09.000 --> 3:47:15.960]  to all measures even after quote full lifting is achieved so they never want to lift the restrictions
[3:47:16.520 --> 3:47:22.040]  this is from their own summary of this report whilst the impact of test threats isolate mask
[3:47:22.040 --> 3:47:26.680]  wearing hand hygiene and covid security is difficult to quantify it will be vital to
[3:47:26.680 --> 3:47:32.120]  emphasize the importance of normalizing and ensuring adherence to all the measures even after full
[3:47:32.120 --> 3:47:38.840]  lifting is achieved so the mass the social distancing all of it will continue bright bar
[3:47:38.840 --> 3:47:44.440]  reports project vsh scientists won a third wave if uk scraps lockdown so again they're going to
[3:47:44.440 --> 3:47:50.600]  blame this slight lifting this slight give back of freedoms on a third wave they've already got
[3:47:50.600 --> 3:47:56.760]  that in the pipeline one white pill though in italy where of course we've had a new round of lockdowns
[3:47:56.760 --> 3:48:02.520]  in places like france italy germany poll reveals seven in ten italians are against lockdowns
[3:48:03.320 --> 3:48:08.200]  surveys revealed massive opposition among the italian public 70 percent of italians are tied
[3:48:08.200 --> 3:48:12.920]  of lockdown restrictions you see that in other parts of the world you see a lot of young people
[3:48:12.920 --> 3:48:17.960]  coming out in the streets everyone basically has had enough at this point public opposition
[3:48:17.960 --> 3:48:23.400]  despite what you see in the polls is building and it looks like thankfully a lot of people are
[3:48:23.400 --> 3:48:29.160]  going to stand up and say no to yet another lockdown and they're not going to end so more
