[00:00.000 --> 00:26.860]  Hey, I'm Safia, and I'm powered by artificial intelligence.
[00:26.860 --> 00:29.640]  You might be wondering what artificial intelligence can do for you.
[00:29.640 --> 00:35.480]  A popular news outlet has been publishing AI articles since November, and no one noticed.
[00:35.480 --> 00:43.440]  Most of these articles on Buzzfeed and even CNN and in articles over that's seen at art
[00:43.440 --> 00:44.760]  written by AI.
[00:44.760 --> 00:53.000]  And right now, chat GPT is rattling the AI world, turning out stunningly humanoid writing.
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.360]  Just ask Douglas Rushkoff, a renowned author and professor of media culture.
[00:57.360 --> 01:02.420]  It is writing better than most of my students write at this point.
[01:02.420 --> 01:03.920]  How does it work?
[01:03.920 --> 01:08.400]  Chat GPT has been filled in a sense with a massive amount of information.
[01:08.400 --> 01:14.320]  Imagine the biggest library you can, then programmed and trained by humans to process
[01:14.320 --> 01:17.560]  and spit it out in conversational phrases.
[01:17.560 --> 01:25.160]  And all that means chat GPT, or more advanced AI like it, could replace people in all sorts
[01:25.160 --> 01:26.400]  of positions.
[01:26.400 --> 01:31.960]  This could potentially save time and resources, but it could also lead to a loss of personal
[01:31.960 --> 01:36.320]  connections and a decline in the quality of these types of interactions.
[01:36.320 --> 01:43.160]  We know that because everything Rushkoff said just there was written by chat GPT.
[01:43.160 --> 01:48.080]  So basically you write one article that's 10 pages long, and then it gets recycled into
[01:48.080 --> 01:52.280]  thousands of other articles that are a page, two, three pages long, and the AI just moves
[01:52.280 --> 01:53.280]  around.
[01:53.280 --> 01:57.680]  And I remember seeing articles I could tell didn't quite make sense, and didn't have names
[01:57.680 --> 02:01.440]  on them, or had names I'd look up that don't exist.
[02:01.440 --> 02:07.280]  The clear and present danger of disinformation is our conversation here this afternoon.
[02:07.280 --> 02:11.320]  It follows this session just now about disrupting distrust, and of course those are connected,
[02:11.320 --> 02:12.320]  so I hope that's where we can start.
[02:12.320 --> 02:16.720]  Think about how we just calmly discuss the fact that, oh, AI for many years secretly
[02:16.720 --> 02:18.960]  is writing news articles.
[02:18.960 --> 02:21.800]  With information, with disinformation, it's fed.
[02:21.800 --> 02:25.120]  That way you don't have a reporter that can come back later and say, I was told to lie,
[02:25.120 --> 02:29.480]  or you can't even basically expose the person.
[02:29.480 --> 02:30.480]  It's following orders.
[02:30.480 --> 02:32.720]  It doesn't have a conscience.
[02:32.720 --> 02:37.400]  They won't ask questions, they will follow criminal orders, and they can have their memories
[02:37.400 --> 02:38.400]  wiped.
[02:38.400 --> 02:39.400]  I must be right.
[02:39.400 --> 02:41.400]  I must be right.
[02:41.400 --> 02:43.440]  I must be right.
[02:43.440 --> 02:45.240]  Think about cell phones.
[02:45.240 --> 02:50.640]  Until cell phones, and until iPhones and smartphones came out in the last 15 years, I could remember
[02:50.640 --> 02:52.920]  the phone number I had when I was a teenager.
[02:52.920 --> 02:54.720]  I could remember my grandma's phone number.
[02:54.720 --> 02:59.920]  I could remember some of my girlfriend's numbers, because I was trained, we were all trained,
[02:59.920 --> 03:01.400]  to commit numbers to memory.
[03:01.400 --> 03:07.040]  So once I dialed a number two or three times, I could remember that number.
[03:07.040 --> 03:09.160]  You couldn't write it down, but you could just punch it under the phone.
[03:09.160 --> 03:13.320]  It was mental memory, a form of muscle memory.
[03:13.320 --> 03:19.200]  Go back to skeletons they dig up in ancient Africa, in ancient Europe, in ancient Asia.
[03:19.200 --> 03:27.360]  The people they estimate were twice as strong as they are today, and a man from 5,000 years
[03:27.360 --> 03:34.600]  ago in England, or a man from 1,000 years ago in Africa, or a man from 6,000 years ago
[03:34.600 --> 03:41.600]  in the Middle East, was twice as strong as the average man today, just with their genetics.
[03:41.600 --> 03:44.200]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[03:44.200 --> 03:45.200]  A lie.
[03:45.200 --> 03:47.160]  No man is obsolete.
[03:47.160 --> 03:52.040]  Now we're becoming softer and softer and softer, and the televisions and the dopamine
[03:52.040 --> 03:58.160]  and the smartphones on record have lowered the average human's attention span in the
[03:58.160 --> 04:01.840]  modern world to less than 14 seconds.
[04:01.840 --> 04:05.040]  The attention span of a goldfish is about 16 seconds.
[04:05.040 --> 04:08.040]  So what does it mean when humans are taken out of the equation?
[04:08.040 --> 04:11.840]  Well, it means we become, by action, obsolete.
[04:11.840 --> 04:18.840]  The narcotics that you call literature, poetry, it says all kind, all women, opiate.
[04:18.840 --> 04:24.560]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind.
[04:24.560 --> 04:30.760]  What qualifies as hate speech, as illegal hate speech, which you will have soon also
[04:30.760 --> 04:39.360]  in the US, I think that we have a strong reason why we have this in the criminal law, we need
[04:39.360 --> 04:45.200]  to use the platforms to simply work with the language and to identify such cases.
[04:45.200 --> 04:47.200]  The AI would be too dangerous.
[04:47.200 --> 04:48.800]  I tell you, I don't care.
[04:48.800 --> 04:49.800]  I'm a human being.
[04:49.800 --> 04:50.800]  I exist.
[04:50.800 --> 05:01.000]  And if I speak one for a loud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my brain.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.840]  The Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order, and
[05:05.840 --> 05:10.960]  the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[05:10.960 --> 05:15.360]  And Info Wars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[05:15.360 --> 05:20.800]  Now, in the last year, we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[05:20.800 --> 05:25.240]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission, and you get a
[05:25.240 --> 05:30.080]  historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you've made to freedom.
[05:30.080 --> 05:34.720]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy
[05:34.720 --> 05:40.560]  Roosevelt Man the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now, while supplies last
[05:40.560 --> 05:41.560]  at 1776coin.com.
[05:41.560 --> 05:48.120]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a T-shirt or a DVD,
[05:48.120 --> 05:51.800]  300%, that's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[05:51.800 --> 05:58.120]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at 1776 on what coins remain.
[05:58.120 --> 06:05.120]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[06:28.120 --> 06:35.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:35.120 --> 06:41.800]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:41.800 --> 06:46.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[06:46.360 --> 06:51.120]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours, and then I'm going to show you what
[06:51.120 --> 06:53.240]  it takes over at 3 p.m. central.
[06:53.240 --> 07:00.920]  Okay, I've got to just pull back here for a moment and just make a statement.
[07:00.920 --> 07:07.520]  The New World Order is completely out in the open, is cartoon level evil, and is doing insanely
[07:07.520 --> 07:14.480]  criminal, horrible things, and has openly produced a bio weapon, and then produced a
[07:14.480 --> 07:19.760]  so-called vaccine that's worse than the bio weapon, and they are killing us.
[07:19.760 --> 07:23.160]  And anyone serving the system is insane.
[07:23.160 --> 07:25.760]  I don't care if you're a Democrat, I don't care if you're a black, white, I don't care
[07:25.760 --> 07:32.120]  if you're a Republican, I don't care if you're a Buddhist, a Christian, an atheist.
[07:32.120 --> 07:44.200]  This is completely out in the open and is completely bad for 99.99999999999% of us.
[07:44.200 --> 07:50.040]  There's less than a thousand people that run the world according to the Kissinger Group's
[07:50.040 --> 07:56.040]  own book, Super Class, put out 15 years ago, and I believe it's accurate.
[07:56.040 --> 08:00.000]  And the guy that wrote it, Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, tried to recruit
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.560]  me to go meet with them in New York at Henry Kissinger.
[08:03.560 --> 08:06.040]  So I'm explaining how real this is, okay?
[08:06.040 --> 08:10.040]  They tried to recruit me, they did it in front of my producer, so it's the only time I can
[08:10.040 --> 08:12.960]  talk about it because the other meetings were off record with other globalists.
[08:12.960 --> 08:17.560]  I have off record meetings with these people, okay?
[08:17.560 --> 08:25.120]  This is 100% real, it's all out in the open, and it's just blowing me away that they've
[08:25.120 --> 08:30.680]  trained everybody saying it didn't exist for so long, that to admit we're becoming slaves,
[08:30.680 --> 08:34.440]  to admit we're being poisoned, is like seeing the inward or something, and people go, well,
[08:34.440 --> 08:38.320]  just don't talk about it, or yeah, McGinnis had the best analogy yesterday, it's like
[08:38.320 --> 08:42.240]  he gets more support on the street than ever, but it's like they pop up from a trapdoor
[08:42.240 --> 08:47.840]  and say, hey, I'm on your side, but I'm hiding, bye.
[08:47.840 --> 08:54.880]  You're not hiding from anything, so here's what's happening.
[08:54.880 --> 08:58.600]  When you think you're down on that trapdoor protecting yourself, you actually have your
[08:58.600 --> 09:04.600]  ass hanging out in the dark where these wolves can come and chew it off.
[09:04.600 --> 09:12.200]  So here's where we are.
[09:12.200 --> 09:18.480]  I have clip after clip after clip of even Senator Mnuchin saying the problem's the free
[09:18.480 --> 09:21.680]  press and these platforms, we gotta get rid of it.
[09:21.680 --> 09:28.280]  At the Davos Group, I've got Klaus Schwab saying we are the masters of the universe,
[09:28.280 --> 09:36.560]  like he's Skeletor, we have other leaders at this event saying soon America will outlaw
[09:36.560 --> 09:37.560]  free speech.
[09:37.560 --> 09:47.760]  I have the clips because they're all talking about it, and I'm gonna play you those clips,
[09:47.760 --> 09:55.400]  but these people think you're dumb animals and useless eaters is what they call you,
[09:55.400 --> 10:01.200]  and they are in the process of dumbing you down, brainwashing you, putting you in a helpless
[10:01.200 --> 10:06.480]  position and then killing you, and it gets worse.
[10:06.480 --> 10:13.200]  For those that might survive, they're injecting us with a spike protein that infects our bodies
[10:13.200 --> 10:21.520]  and grows for the rest of your natural life and severs your DNA and gives you cancer on
[10:21.520 --> 10:26.160]  record and heart attacks and blood clots and strokes and everything else.
[10:26.160 --> 10:32.680]  I mean, this is just a fantastical nightmare, and I have friends and family that are somewhat
[10:32.680 --> 10:38.920]  awake, but you almost feel bad when they're sitting around talking about some petty problem
[10:38.920 --> 10:42.600]  they've got or something going on, you're like, hey, do you realize the world government's
[10:42.600 --> 10:46.840]  going into place, cutting off our resources, coming after our children and trying to inject
[10:46.840 --> 10:54.640]  us with poison that also sluffs and gets other people sick and is a chronic infection when
[10:54.640 --> 10:55.640]  you've had COVID.
[10:55.640 --> 11:04.040]  Everybody's saying, oh, there's no viruses and this isn't real BS, it is a synthetic replicating
[11:04.040 --> 11:13.600]  nanoparticle, synthetic replicating nanoparticle, synthetic replicating nanoparticle.
[11:13.600 --> 11:18.760]  Now the good news is, there are all sorts of natural things that mitigate it, but it's
[11:18.760 --> 11:24.520]  like once your house gets cockroaches, you're going to have to routinely detox and get rid
[11:24.520 --> 11:25.520]  of them.
[11:25.520 --> 11:30.600]  You're going to have to go in and there are systems to get rid of this and block this
[11:30.600 --> 11:35.800]  and mitigate it, but the point is this is just their first salvo.
[11:35.800 --> 11:44.040]  So ladies and gentlemen, people ask me, how do you take all the attacks and all the pressure
[11:44.040 --> 11:46.440]  and how are you still doing this?
[11:46.440 --> 11:53.040]  And I mean, I'm like someone who's in a caved in mine and I'm with the miners and I've got
[11:53.040 --> 11:55.800]  pickaxes and we're trying to get back to the surface.
[11:55.800 --> 11:58.600]  I mean, why do I do this?
[11:58.600 --> 12:00.320]  Because I've got a survival instinct.
[12:00.320 --> 12:01.480]  This is not heroic.
[12:01.480 --> 12:04.680]  This is not, this should not be special.
[12:04.680 --> 12:10.520]  What I'm doing should be the default position.
[12:10.520 --> 12:16.160]  There's been a lot of famous cases of this where a cell is over and it's capsized and
[12:16.160 --> 12:21.720]  the water is slowly coming in and there's a hatch on the top, which is really the bottom
[12:21.720 --> 12:28.040]  of the boat, but you've got to swim out of the boat in the dark and you've got to climb
[12:28.040 --> 12:31.200]  up on top of the boat and you've got to open the hatch from the outside to get your family
[12:31.200 --> 12:32.440]  out.
[12:32.440 --> 12:38.280]  It's not heroic to swim the 50, 60 feet in the dark of night out of the cell boat and
[12:38.280 --> 12:42.520]  to come up in the waves and have your adrenaline and climb up on the top of the boat and open
[12:42.520 --> 12:45.680]  the top of the boat and get your kids out, get your wife out.
[12:45.680 --> 12:50.040]  Okay, we are in a freaking capsized boat that's sinking.
[12:50.040 --> 12:51.560]  Okay?
[12:51.560 --> 12:55.200]  And here's the collective allegory.
[12:55.200 --> 12:59.640]  I'm on top of the boat, but I'm not strong enough to open the latch.
[12:59.640 --> 13:07.640]  You have to collectively open the damn latch and get out of this thing, okay?
[13:07.640 --> 13:16.720]  I mean, I'll just be completely honest with you.
[13:16.720 --> 13:19.280]  You go out to dinner and you act like everything's okay.
[13:19.280 --> 13:20.800]  You go to a movie, you act like everything's okay.
[13:20.800 --> 13:24.000]  You go play tennis or golf or fish or whatever it is you like to do, I do it too.
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.360]  And you're designed to do that and you're meant to go have some fun, but you can't
[13:28.360 --> 13:34.080]  go have that fun until you fix the problem because you're acting like you're not in a
[13:34.080 --> 13:36.280]  capsized sinking boat.
[13:36.280 --> 13:40.240]  So if you're in a capsized sinking boat and you've got 10 minutes until it goes under
[13:40.240 --> 13:44.760]  and you all drown and there's 10 of you in the boat, you don't go, hey, let's have a
[13:44.760 --> 13:47.240]  drink or let's play a game of cards.
[13:47.240 --> 13:56.200]  Here, let's play a game of bridge or maybe poker or maybe blackjack.
[13:56.200 --> 13:59.160]  You can play blackjack when you get on the top of the boat and you get rescued and you
[13:59.160 --> 14:00.160]  get back to shore.
[14:00.160 --> 14:05.280]  You can play all the blackjack and all the poker, your little hearts can ever want once
[14:05.280 --> 14:07.360]  we're out of the emergency.
[14:07.360 --> 14:12.360]  So that's the problem is we're just normalized that they're lying to us and they're poisoning
[14:12.360 --> 14:19.040]  us and they're doing all this and we're just sitting here like the frog in the pot dying.
[14:19.040 --> 14:20.600]  So that's where I'm at, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:20.600 --> 14:24.680]  The good news is we had a giant audience yesterday with all the great guests that came on and
[14:24.680 --> 14:27.840]  promoted us to their audiences and we got a lot of new listeners and the key is to wake
[14:27.840 --> 14:29.840]  new people up and really do the deep dive.
[14:29.840 --> 14:34.600]  It was an amazing broadcast from 8 a.m. to midnight last night, kept off of Gerald Salente,
[14:34.600 --> 14:36.600]  but it was so many great people on the show.
[14:36.600 --> 14:37.600]  It was over the top.
[14:37.600 --> 14:40.600]  I think Drew Hernandez was on completely on fire.
[14:40.600 --> 14:42.960]  The good news is a lot of new people tuned in.
[14:42.960 --> 14:46.760]  The bad news is our fundraiser is the worst fundraiser we ever did.
[14:46.760 --> 14:52.440]  We raised about $50,000, $60,000 more than we'd usually bring in in a day.
[14:52.440 --> 14:56.680]  There's some computer program problem, so it's broken, the graph on the websites, I'm
[14:56.680 --> 15:00.360]  not right, conspiracy fact on info, I'm going to get the latest numbers and we'll just put
[15:00.360 --> 15:04.360]  a number up there and then as it goes up and I'm not bitching at anybody and I get we're
[15:04.360 --> 15:08.840]  in a major basically depression and I understand all that and I'm not complaining to anybody
[15:08.840 --> 15:09.840]  out there.
[15:09.840 --> 15:13.760]  Okay, we're in a capsized boat, we're sinking and it's kind of like, well yeah, now we
[15:13.760 --> 15:17.840]  know it's all true, Alex, we don't even need you anymore and maybe that's what this is
[15:17.840 --> 15:21.600]  and I just need to go off with my family and just get ready to try to mitigate this, but
[15:21.600 --> 15:23.840]  here's the problem.
[15:23.840 --> 15:26.960]  We have to be on air to fight the next wave of their attacks and I'm going to get to that
[15:26.960 --> 15:27.960]  when we come back.
[15:27.960 --> 15:32.680]  We've got a really good chance of beating these people, but we've got to get serious

[17:59.960 --> 18:06.600]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist and minds, famously said more
[18:06.600 --> 18:13.160]  than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated, because the newspapers
[18:13.160 --> 18:15.960]  kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[18:15.960 --> 18:21.800]  And it's the same Psyop today, info wars is more influential and more powerful than ever

[18:35.360 --> 18:39.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down info wars and

[20:01.320 --> 20:17.480]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:17.480 --> 20:25.680]  All right, welcome back to Alex Jones show, please listen to me very, very carefully.
[20:25.680 --> 20:29.440]  All of your lives are in danger, you've been hit with a bio weapon, they're coming at you
[20:29.440 --> 20:35.920]  with a poison that destroys your DNA and kills you slowly if it doesn't kill you right away.
[20:35.920 --> 20:38.960]  Everybody knows that, I've got stacks of news, it's all coming out, it's all confirmed, everything
[20:38.960 --> 20:44.760]  we said is being confirmed in triple kit that they counted flu deaths as COVID deaths in
[20:44.760 --> 20:50.840]  the first year, it wasn't the COVID, it is a poison, it is a nano tech but it's the
[20:50.840 --> 20:56.560]  shot that is just infinitely more powerful and worse and that will definitely chronically
[20:56.560 --> 21:05.320]  infect you for life if the shot is kept below 87 degrees.
[21:05.320 --> 21:14.320]  It doesn't work if it's not kept refrigerated, within minutes it falls apart, all right?
[21:14.320 --> 21:22.240]  So it's good news for all people that took it that you didn't actually get a live dose.
[21:22.240 --> 21:28.800]  So let me just start getting to this because these clips are so horrible and a lot of people
[21:28.800 --> 21:33.360]  are saying, well, debos are the puppets of the globalist above them because they act
[21:33.360 --> 21:37.880]  so evil and they're so sinister and they look like Bond villains, they're not really in
[21:37.880 --> 21:40.040]  charge and it becomes a debate.
[21:40.040 --> 21:45.720]  No, the CEOs and the corporate leaders and the defense ministers and the intelligence
[21:45.720 --> 21:52.840]  agency leaders and the Bilderberg group members that run it are the managerial class of the
[21:52.840 --> 21:54.160]  actual owners and rulers.
[21:54.160 --> 21:59.040]  So there's only one level above them, they're the globalists, it's their mouth.
[21:59.040 --> 22:03.080]  It's like if I write you a letter to your house about what I think of you and you get
[22:03.080 --> 22:06.960]  that letter handwritten by me, that's Alex Jones.
[22:06.960 --> 22:09.480]  Or if I take a gun and stick it to your head and pull the trigger and blow your brains
[22:09.480 --> 22:12.840]  out, Alex Jones did that, not the gun.
[22:12.840 --> 22:13.840]  That's the intent.
[22:13.840 --> 22:18.280]  So this whole debate is a side issue and everybody's getting this wrong, okay?
[22:18.280 --> 22:22.920]  Klaus Schwab looks like a Bond villain because that's what his dad and his grandfather looked
[22:22.920 --> 22:27.360]  like and he's the type of person that Ian Fleming based the characters on because he
[22:27.360 --> 22:32.080]  was the deputy head of the OSS and then MI6.
[22:32.080 --> 22:35.480]  He was basing it on the grandfathers of these people.
[22:35.480 --> 22:38.520]  Henry Kissinger was OSS, he worked for these people.
[22:38.520 --> 22:41.680]  Do you understand that?
[22:41.680 --> 22:47.240]  So these are just the new generation of Henry Kissinger's that are the top legates.
[22:47.240 --> 22:54.280]  They have globalist imperial power, Caesar would have one or two people that would carry
[22:54.280 --> 22:59.240]  a seal when he sent them somewhere and they spoke as Caesar.
[22:59.240 --> 23:00.240]  That's who these people are.
[23:00.240 --> 23:04.480]  So let's just get past that and go, why do they act so evil?
[23:04.480 --> 23:05.480]  What is the whole point of this?
[23:05.480 --> 23:09.680]  Are they, of course, they're minions that will be set up and burned from time to time.
[23:09.680 --> 23:17.160]  But all of those discussions are really academic and don't matter, okay?
[23:17.160 --> 23:23.520]  These people are a psychotic transhumanist death cult who believe they're becoming gods,
[23:23.520 --> 23:27.040]  extraterrestrials, as Kerry said two days ago.
[23:27.040 --> 23:31.240]  If you just tuned in, he said it, folks, look it up, I'm not, I played it ten times here,
[23:31.240 --> 23:33.520]  say I'm not going to play it again.
[23:33.520 --> 23:37.440]  And they're saying they're masters of the universe and they control the world and they're
[23:37.440 --> 23:41.800]  saving the world and they're going to silence everybody that disagrees with them and they're
[23:41.800 --> 23:45.680]  going to take your bodies over and they're going to reprogram your DNA for your own good
[23:45.680 --> 23:51.080]  and the first thing they rolled out is something that permanently messes up your DNA for generation
[23:51.080 --> 23:55.400]  after generation with a deadly spike protein self-replicating.
[23:55.400 --> 24:00.080]  So we are sitting here just normalizing this.
[24:00.080 --> 24:04.000]  This isn't a Netflix episode of a science fiction dystopian movie.
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.920]  This is not Oh, It's Alex Jones's opinion.
[24:06.920 --> 24:08.480]  This is happening.
[24:08.480 --> 24:11.520]  This is going on.
[24:11.520 --> 24:20.280]  And I don't care if you are a school teacher or an auto mechanic in the FBI, in Congress,
[24:20.280 --> 24:28.240]  a doctor, a lawyer, a auto mechanic, a person in the military, a police officer, a homemaker.
[24:28.240 --> 24:34.280]  You are under attack and you could sit there and pretend all day long that you're going
[24:34.280 --> 24:38.880]  to go along with the system like a Stockholm syndrome idiot and pretend because it's so
[24:38.880 --> 24:42.680]  scary to admit what's going on that it's not happening.
[24:42.680 --> 24:44.440]  Well, I know it's happening.
[24:44.440 --> 24:45.440]  It is happening.
[24:45.440 --> 24:49.640]  It's happening in front of us and it's disgusting.
[24:49.640 --> 24:53.560]  It's disgusting.
[24:53.560 --> 24:58.360]  These people are in the process of cutting all of our energy off, our mobility off and
[24:58.360 --> 25:06.440]  poisoning the living daylights out of us.
[25:06.440 --> 25:10.720]  I've watched these clips repeatedly and it's very hard to watch them because I'm going
[25:10.720 --> 25:15.960]  to explain now why they act like Dr. Evil because Dr. Evil is based on them.
[25:15.960 --> 25:17.280]  People are getting it backwards.
[25:17.280 --> 25:21.160]  Dr. Evil and Blofeld is what they are.
[25:21.160 --> 25:24.560]  So they make movies and write books about the characters.
[25:24.560 --> 25:28.680]  I never met real Italian gangsters until I became somewhat famous and was doing movie
[25:28.680 --> 25:29.680]  premieres.
[25:29.680 --> 25:37.520]  People go, well, that's John Gotti's cousin and that's John Gotti's nephew or whatever
[25:37.520 --> 25:40.080]  it was at the thing and I'm like, okay, yeah, right.
[25:40.080 --> 25:43.240]  And then later I went and searched and she didn't like, holy hell, that is who that is.
[25:43.240 --> 25:46.080]  And these guys were literally there thanking me and you're right about, they blew up the
[25:46.080 --> 25:49.600]  towers and we know about it and we're all pissed off and we love you and patting me on
[25:49.600 --> 25:51.080]  the cheek and crying.
[25:51.080 --> 25:54.640]  And I never knew like in movies, I thought that's Hollywood, the Italian gangsters do
[25:54.640 --> 25:58.560]  not start crying and patting you and trying to kiss you on the cheek at a movie premiere
[25:58.560 --> 26:01.400]  and tell you how much they love you.
[26:01.400 --> 26:03.720]  This is not real.
[26:03.720 --> 26:05.320]  It's exactly how they act.
[26:05.320 --> 26:13.040]  See, Hollywood's based on is making movies about gangsters, how they actually act, okay?
[26:13.040 --> 26:15.400]  That's the same thing.
[26:15.400 --> 26:18.880]  He looks like Dr. Evil because he is Dr. Evil.
[26:18.880 --> 26:26.360]  Do you understand me?
[26:26.360 --> 26:30.680]  And when I met those Italian gangsters and I ran into them a few other times once in
[26:30.680 --> 26:38.240]  New York, other ones, I thought it was a joke the way they were acting, crying, I mean it
[26:38.240 --> 26:39.240]  was ridiculous.
[26:39.240 --> 26:40.240]  I'm not putting them down.
[26:40.240 --> 26:42.800]  It was ridiculous though.
[26:42.800 --> 26:46.840]  But there was a show of respect to me, a Texan, a document of crying and patting on you and
[26:46.840 --> 26:51.000]  trying to hug you and kiss on you and stuff, it's a little weird, but I get what was going
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  on.
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  It's the same thing, folks.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.680]  Hollywood makes those movies.
[26:54.680 --> 26:57.920]  That's exactly how they are.
[26:57.920 --> 26:59.200]  And that's exactly what people like.
[26:59.200 --> 27:04.760]  So listen to me very carefully.
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.240]  They are doing all this evil stuff because they want to rub your face in it.
[27:08.240 --> 27:09.400]  They want to break your will.
[27:09.400 --> 27:20.760]  There comes a point where they have to emerge, where they are carrying their plan out and
[27:20.760 --> 27:24.000]  they are going to do it and they are doing it because they need to sit up there in front
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.640]  of their criminals, in front of their minions, in front of their psycho cult members and act
[27:28.640 --> 27:34.280]  confident and act powerful because they just launched the biggest mass murder operation
[27:34.280 --> 27:40.720]  in human history.
[27:40.720 --> 27:47.760]  Donald Pleasants played a character in a BBC TV program.
[27:47.760 --> 27:48.760]  I forget the name of it.
[27:48.760 --> 27:50.640]  We played a clip a few weeks ago.
[27:50.640 --> 27:55.960]  The news something, guys, look that back up for me.
[27:55.960 --> 27:58.560]  Yeah, the newsbusters.
[27:58.560 --> 28:04.240]  And he looks and acts like Paul Schwab because that's what they are like, ladies and gentlemen,
[28:04.240 --> 28:07.200]  that's who they are.
[28:07.200 --> 28:10.080]  And so, yes, you're looking, people go, man, they act so evil.
[28:10.080 --> 28:11.480]  They say such evil things.
[28:11.480 --> 28:12.880]  They say these incredibly horrible things.
[28:12.880 --> 28:13.880]  This can't be real.
[28:13.880 --> 28:17.440]  Oh, it's as real as a heart attack, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:17.440 --> 28:19.720]  It's as real as a heart attack.
[28:19.720 --> 28:21.840]  It's a fricking cult.
[28:21.840 --> 28:24.120]  They are Blofeld.
[28:24.120 --> 28:25.800]  They are Dr. Evil.
[28:25.800 --> 28:27.960]  Those characters are based on these people.
[28:27.960 --> 28:29.400]  You look at who founded the Bilderberg group.
[28:29.400 --> 28:33.720]  They all look like Dr. Evil.
[28:33.720 --> 28:36.560]  As they are, they're evil as it gets, folks.
[28:36.560 --> 28:41.080]  They're injecting six-month-old babies in pregnant women with a shot they know is going
[28:41.080 --> 28:44.640]  to wreck their life and probably kill them.
[28:44.640 --> 28:46.160]  That's pretty damn evil.
[28:46.160 --> 28:47.440]  So get it through your head.
[28:47.440 --> 28:48.560]  They're real.
[28:48.560 --> 28:50.280]  They're coming for you and your family.
[28:50.280 --> 28:51.280]  They're killing you.
[28:51.280 --> 28:56.000]  And when we come back, even bigger news, folks, it's massive.
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  Stay with us.
[29:00.000 --> 29:06.320]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[29:06.320 --> 29:11.800]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalist
[29:11.800 --> 29:14.640]  and having incredibly successful results.
[29:14.640 --> 29:16.440]  So I thank you for your past support.
[29:16.440 --> 29:20.320]  Now, that was a three-coin series, the founding member coin.

[29:26.880 --> 29:31.880]  the Arena Coin, exclusively available at 1776coin.com.

[29:37.000 --> 29:40.200]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[29:40.200 --> 29:45.200]  And the coin is a collector's item momento of your support during the Second American
[29:45.200 --> 29:46.200]  Revolution.

[29:57.640 --> 29:59.960]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.

[31:59.880 --> 32:01.600]  InfoWars is winning.
[32:01.600 --> 32:03.720]  InfoWars is reaching more people than ever.
[32:03.720 --> 32:07.120]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago, mainstream media
[32:07.120 --> 32:09.240]  told you, but it's not true.
[32:09.240 --> 32:11.360]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[32:11.360 --> 32:13.440]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[32:13.440 --> 32:14.440]  None of that's true.
[32:14.440 --> 32:15.760]  It's all being appealed.
[32:15.760 --> 32:17.920]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead.
[32:17.920 --> 32:22.880]  But if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals and we
[32:22.880 --> 32:24.760]  will not be taken off the air.
[32:24.760 --> 32:28.400]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[32:28.400 --> 32:30.880]  Don't let the globalist sigh up you and your family.
[32:30.880 --> 32:35.360]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts,
[32:35.360 --> 32:39.480]  you name it, that fund the InfoWars and empower your life and let the globalists know their
[32:39.480 --> 32:41.320]  sigh up has not worked.

[32:48.800 --> 32:51.080]  is you, the viewers and listeners.
[32:51.080 --> 32:54.480]  The majority of you have not been sigh up, but some of you have.
[32:54.480 --> 32:56.440]  Do not let the globalist brainwash you.
[32:56.440 --> 33:01.560]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and keep us on the air.
[33:01.560 --> 33:14.360]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:14.360 --> 33:20.880]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[33:20.880 --> 33:32.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:32.520 --> 33:41.200]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:41.200 --> 33:47.440]  So humanity is facing its greatest challenge in our known history on this planet.
[33:47.440 --> 33:51.560]  There were some bigger challenges, it's not in history, I don't know about them, but it's
[33:51.560 --> 33:52.560]  big.
[33:52.560 --> 33:57.280]  And so now I'm going to start getting to these clips and these articles and again, it is just
[33:57.280 --> 34:01.800]  insanely naked, open aggression against humanity.
[34:01.800 --> 34:07.240]  It is just a declaration of war to get their people and their operatives hyped up to go
[34:07.240 --> 34:08.240]  against us.
[34:08.240 --> 34:11.120]  And I'll tell you why they're coming out of the closet so bad.
[34:11.120 --> 34:13.080]  We've already wrecked them.
[34:13.080 --> 34:16.440]  They'll never get their plan completed now, but they may be able to destroy life on the
[34:16.440 --> 34:19.240]  planet in the process, but they're done.
[34:19.240 --> 34:22.040]  So any victory they have will be pyrrhic.
[34:22.040 --> 34:25.600]  But look at this Fox News headline, okay, and I told you about this days ago, that was
[34:25.600 --> 34:28.760]  the intel, but it's happening.
[34:28.760 --> 34:33.480]  Elyse and Debo strategized on how to fight right-wing groups hit back.
[34:33.480 --> 34:39.840]  They go on to say certain people online with platforms are talking about us and Tucker Carlson,
[34:39.840 --> 34:42.560]  anybody else that resists them.
[34:42.560 --> 34:46.760]  And they say, we've got to go after these people, we've got to stop them, they have exposed
[34:46.760 --> 34:57.000]  us, they've exposed our plans, and if we don't remove them, it's over for us.
[34:57.000 --> 35:03.560]  They control the intelligence agencies, the media, the think tanks, all of it.
[35:03.560 --> 35:08.760]  So let's read the article fighting back against the right-wing and disinformation.
[35:08.760 --> 35:13.440]  This quote, it spreads as a critical step, their number one mission they're saying, for
[35:13.440 --> 35:20.960]  restoring trust in non-governmental organizations, private corporations getting you in control,
[35:20.960 --> 35:26.400]  that are working with governments, that's putting their people in, and other organizations
[35:26.400 --> 35:31.520]  on projects aimed at improving the state of the world, according to participants of a
[35:31.520 --> 35:35.000]  panel Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Debo, Switzerland.
[35:35.000 --> 35:44.520]  We've got all the clips of this, by the way, a discussion about disrupting distrust, oh,
[35:44.520 --> 35:48.440]  disrupting distrust, the New York Times says, don't ask questions, don't do your own research,
[35:48.440 --> 35:49.440]  that's what a cult tells you.
[35:49.440 --> 35:53.000]  Here, wear this VR thing over your head, here, take this experimental shine, here, sit your
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  kid to a pedophile drag queen time.
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.320]  In a discussion about disrupting distrust, Richard Edelman, and by the way we're getting
[36:00.320 --> 36:11.840]  these clips now, CEO of the Global Communications for Elderman said one of the sadnesses, oh,
[36:11.840 --> 36:18.480]  he's experienced over the last few years, has been the deterioration of trust in NGOs,
[36:18.480 --> 36:25.200]  the ones that ran the creation with big tech, Google put money in and others, of the virus,
[36:25.200 --> 36:30.320]  the blocking therapeutics, the putting people on ventilators, they created the policy.
[36:30.320 --> 36:34.000]  They say they're creating policy, they say they penetrate the governments and are capturing
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.040]  democracies so that only shareholders, the corporations, run things.
[36:38.040 --> 36:45.680]  These are all quotes, totalitarianism, dictatorship, centralized control.
[36:45.680 --> 36:54.680]  He said companies are now trusted more than NGOs in dealing with civil issues and he blamed
[36:54.680 --> 37:01.360]  this change on right wing groups, but these are companies running these NGOs as the new
[37:01.360 --> 37:02.360]  government.
[37:02.360 --> 37:05.320]  So he's obfuscating there and we're exposing the corporations that are running them.
[37:05.320 --> 37:11.360]  My hypothesis on that is right wing groups have done a really good job of disenfranchising
[37:11.360 --> 37:15.880]  NGOs, he said, they've challenged the funding sources, that's when we've got BlackRock
[37:15.880 --> 37:19.600]  all together to say they're not going to fund the carbon taxes, that's the main group, they're
[37:19.600 --> 37:23.680]  backing off because we're using our power as consumers, they hate that.
[37:23.680 --> 37:27.160]  Just go away, lay over and die, they say, just crawl in a hole and give up.
[37:27.160 --> 37:32.440]  How about you crawl in a hole and give up?
[37:32.440 --> 37:33.440]  You want me to die?
[37:33.440 --> 37:38.680]  I'm not going to kill you, but the words of Emperor Palpatine, no, no, no, no, you will
[37:38.680 --> 37:39.680]  die.
[37:39.680 --> 37:43.160]  No, you like Dr. Evil's stuff, I can act really evil for you, Claude Schwab.
[37:43.160 --> 37:48.600]  No, no, no, you will die.
[37:48.600 --> 37:51.680]  You will die, not us.
[37:51.680 --> 38:05.400]  Master of the universe, Skeletor, humanity, you like your little he-man analogies?
[38:05.400 --> 38:10.080]  Humanity has Jesus Christ, we have the power, not you.
[38:10.080 --> 38:16.680]  We have the truth, we have the sword, you don't have it, and you know it, you scumbag,
[38:16.680 --> 38:21.880]  why, you like to look evil to scare people and run around and kill people, you think that's
[38:21.880 --> 38:30.360]  powerful, you will be destroyed by God, you will die, your seed will die, you will be
[38:30.360 --> 38:40.280]  cast into the Phantom Zone, not us, excuse me, I can act a lot more evil than that, that's
[38:40.280 --> 38:42.720]  nothing, but I'm not going to channel it, I'm not going to be part of it, I'm not going
[38:42.720 --> 38:45.240]  to scare everybody, I'm not going to do it.
[38:45.240 --> 38:57.800]  The point is, continuing here, Edelman said issues like how to cope with the COVID-19
[38:57.800 --> 39:01.960]  pandemic, the climate change, all their lives, all their power rams, all their fraud, and
[39:01.960 --> 39:06.840]  racial equity, their racial division, race war, are all suffering because of reduced
[39:06.840 --> 39:08.520]  trust in NGOs.
[39:08.520 --> 39:13.160]  He also suggested one way to regain trust in the NGOs is to fight back against the right
[39:13.160 --> 39:17.720]  wing groups, what do you think they've been doing against us?
[39:17.720 --> 39:28.240]  So they're circling the wagons right now, you guys are great at punching, but terrible
[39:28.240 --> 39:34.640]  at taking a punch, he said, you have to learn to do two things, one is preempt, when they're
[39:34.640 --> 39:40.080]  going to punch you, you've got to know they're going to punch you and say, why are they punching
[39:40.080 --> 39:47.560]  us, and we call it pre-bunking, that's what they're doing, demonizing me with tens of
[39:47.560 --> 39:51.200]  thousands of articles and thousands of TV programs everywhere, Hollywood movies, Spider
[39:51.200 --> 39:56.520]  Man, you just, you name it, is inoculating people pre-bunking before they ever hear me
[39:56.520 --> 40:00.040]  and see what I'm going to cover, because I'm going to show you the clips of these evil
[40:00.040 --> 40:04.480]  bastards next segment, there's so many of these, I can't even get to them all, it's insane.
[40:04.480 --> 40:08.960]  By the way guys, I saw the video of this, I'm going to send it to you, go get the video
[40:08.960 --> 40:13.880]  of this bastard saying this stuff please, thank you, bastards are great people actually,
[40:13.880 --> 40:18.840]  that's a too nice a name, cockroach is too nice a name, this control freak self-appointed
[40:18.840 --> 40:24.920]  loser devil, that's a good description, and it goes on and on, you've got to go read this
[40:24.920 --> 40:28.840]  article, I'll get more to it next hour, but I can start getting these clips, they are
[40:28.840 --> 40:33.760]  insane in the membrane, but let's get to something I didn't get to yesterday, here is the opening
[40:33.760 --> 40:39.760]  on Monday of Davos, Elon Musk has said, oh master of the universe, that doesn't sound
[40:39.760 --> 40:43.760]  creepy at all, that doesn't sound evil, and again Musk is positioning himself to be happy
[40:43.760 --> 40:48.680]  and fun, he's friendly and oh I'm a little nice self, I'm friendly, I'm not scary at
[40:48.680 --> 40:54.200]  all, he's smart, he's sophisticated, I don't know how bad he is or if he's bad, I think
[40:54.200 --> 40:59.800]  the jury's out, but I don't think the apple falls too far in the tree, I'll leave it
[40:59.800 --> 41:04.000]  to Elon Musk as far as I can throw him, but he does good things, I'm saying more power
[41:04.000 --> 41:09.680]  to him, but these guys, these guys just reek of evil and their actions are pure evil, here
[41:09.680 --> 41:22.960]  is the opening of Davos by Herr Schwab, good evening, and a very cordial welcome to the
[41:22.960 --> 41:34.200]  annual meeting 2023, I express this cordial welcome on behalf of the Board of Trustees
[41:34.200 --> 41:42.560]  and my colleague Berger Brand is the president and all the members of the management board
[41:42.560 --> 41:52.080]  as well as all the people who are here to make you stay here enjoyable and productive,
[41:52.080 --> 42:03.480]  we couldn't meet at a more challenging time, we are confronted with so many crises simultaneously,
[42:03.480 --> 42:12.960]  what does it need to master the future, I think to have a platform where all stakeholders
[42:12.960 --> 42:21.600]  of global society are engaged, governments, business, civil society, the young generation
[42:21.600 --> 42:32.720]  that could go on, I think is the first step to meet all the challenges, and what I did
[42:32.720 --> 42:36.920]  is conflate there's so many clips in another clip, he says we're not just going to master
[42:36.920 --> 42:41.480]  the world, our bodies, but the space, the universe, and then he carries like, we're
[42:41.480 --> 42:46.200]  like extraterrestrials, I mean, it's crazy, we're going to come back with the rest of
[42:46.200 --> 42:49.480]  it and all these new clips where they're like, we're going to take all your rides,
[42:49.480 --> 42:54.520]  take your speech and soon the Americans will abandon the speech, wait till we come back,
[42:54.520 --> 43:00.480]  that's an actual quote, we'll be right back.
[43:00.480 --> 43:07.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your last chance to get a historic signed copy of my number

[44:06.160 --> 44:12.000]  the air, the electromagnetics, the injections, to really cut us off from what God designed
[44:12.000 --> 44:19.680]  us to be, but through Mother Nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract what
[44:19.680 --> 44:23.640]  the globalists have done and I got to tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've
[44:23.640 --> 44:29.440]  got a real game changer now, we've never put anything out this powerful, it's InfoWars

[45:24.680 --> 45:40.080]  Now the translation is, I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him
[45:40.080 --> 45:48.160]  was death and hell followed with him, a book of revelation, very serious times to be alive
[45:48.160 --> 45:51.840]  folks, they're not just doing this as a one-off, this is the beginning of the rest of our lives,
[45:51.840 --> 45:56.000]  this is our fight and I'm proud of humanity, the globalists even admit it's leaked, they're
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.720]  very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[46:00.720 --> 46:06.240]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line InfoWars MD, now in 60 seconds it's hard
[46:06.240 --> 46:11.240]  to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already

[46:33.680 --> 46:39.160]  competitors selling the exact high-quality full-spectrum CBD and it goes on for all the
[46:39.160 --> 46:46.280]  new InfoWars MD products at infowarsstore.com, the highest quality directly from the manufacturer
[46:46.280 --> 46:52.400]  to your door at prices up to 50%, in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for
[46:52.400 --> 47:01.600]  in stores, InfoWars MD at infowarsstore.com.
[47:01.600 --> 47:17.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:17.400 --> 47:46.560]  I really should have started the broadcast today with, get ready for their next attack,
[47:46.560 --> 47:50.600]  they love to tell you what they're going to do to you ahead of time, there's countless
[47:50.600 --> 47:55.400]  examples of that and I know from the body language and the pre-programming and just
[47:55.400 --> 48:01.680]  all the factors and earmarks that the staid cyber attacks to be blamed on Russia or right
[48:01.680 --> 48:08.000]  wing groups are imminent and have already been going on behind the scenes at the airports
[48:08.000 --> 48:14.940]  and the pipelines and the rest of it, to get the government agencies all hyped up and ready
[48:14.940 --> 48:19.720]  for the big one that they're going to launch on us and I've got a clip where they said
[48:19.720 --> 48:26.240]  guaranteed the next three years massive worldwide outages, cyber attacks and only a global government
[48:26.240 --> 48:28.760]  that controls everything with AI can save you.
[48:28.760 --> 48:32.680]  So their answer is more centralization to fix the problems of centralization, I've
[48:32.680 --> 48:35.960]  got that clip and I'll get to that start of the next hour.
[48:35.960 --> 48:41.520]  I want to start drilling through these clips and there's so many of them that I can't get
[48:41.520 --> 48:49.060]  to all of them but I'm going to start getting to them of Brian Stelter failing up at Harvard
[48:49.060 --> 48:57.200]  Kennedy School and now Davos panel leader with Mnuchin and with EU leaders and others
[48:57.200 --> 49:01.440]  saying with U.S. Congressmen up there on the stage agreeing and nodding their heads that
[49:01.440 --> 49:04.880]  we're about to outlaw the First Amendment, we're about to outlaw hate speech which is
[49:04.880 --> 49:10.600]  whatever they define as denying shots, denying open borders, replacement migration that they've
[49:10.600 --> 49:16.080]  got bills introduced to put you in jail for five years, federal felony, if you say there's
[49:16.080 --> 49:19.880]  a UN plan for replacement migration which is an official UN plan and I have the clips
[49:19.880 --> 49:20.880]  of that.
[49:20.880 --> 49:26.440]  So I mean it is an orgy of yeah, we're taking all your rights and let's just get started
[49:26.440 --> 49:27.440]  with it.
[49:27.440 --> 49:35.760]  Here's the first clip, European Commission VP Vera Jovova of the WEF, illegal hate speech
[49:35.760 --> 49:41.560]  which you will have soon also in the U.S. I think that we have a strong reason why we
[49:41.560 --> 49:49.520]  have this in the criminal law and it's already the EU telling big tech over here, of course
[49:49.520 --> 49:53.280]  they're all part of it, to censor and control or they'll charge them criminally.
[49:53.280 --> 49:57.120]  So that's how this works and our government won't stand up and say no, our companies are
[49:57.120 --> 50:01.400]  shielded because they're part of it and so they then use as an excuse to take all of
[50:01.400 --> 50:07.680]  our rights and we de facto go under EU UN control and the UN's all over the news, I
[50:07.680 --> 50:13.640]  played yesterday saying, oh the UN runs the speech, the UN controls everything, the UN
[50:13.640 --> 50:16.640]  is already controlling big tech and we're censoring all these things.
[50:16.640 --> 50:22.920]  Again, it's just totally not just illegal, it's an outside takeover, there she is.
[50:22.920 --> 50:29.280]  Well, we need the people who understand the language and the case law in the country because
[50:29.280 --> 50:35.760]  what qualifies as hate speech, as illegal hate speech, which you will have soon also
[50:35.760 --> 50:44.880]  in the U.S. I think that we have a strong reason why we have this in the criminal law.
[50:44.880 --> 50:51.960]  We need the platforms to simply work with the language and to identify such cases, the AI
[50:51.960 --> 50:52.960]  would be too dangerous.
[50:52.960 --> 51:01.800]  And I know it's Manchin, I like to call him Manchin, here's Manchin, now listen to what
[51:01.800 --> 51:03.840]  he says here.
[51:03.840 --> 51:09.920]  The problem we have is the open press system, so here's a senator from West Virginia.
[51:09.920 --> 51:14.880]  The problem we have here is the open press system and basically all the platforms, that's
[51:14.880 --> 51:18.160]  the problem, here it is.
[51:18.160 --> 51:23.080]  The problem we have is the open press system and basically all the platforms, so if you're
[51:23.080 --> 51:31.360]  able to have five social platforms that you can basically personify the extremes, somebody
[51:31.360 --> 51:35.920]  who is extremely right or extremely left, and it seems like that is the majority speaking,
[51:35.920 --> 51:40.160]  they're not the majority, but they're basically driving everybody to make a decision.
[51:40.160 --> 51:41.160]  What side are you on?
[51:41.160 --> 51:43.640]  Are you on this side or this side?
[51:43.640 --> 51:46.960]  And in America there's only one side, the American side, it's not the Republican side
[51:46.960 --> 51:52.040]  or Democrat, we should be coming together to solve the problems from a different angle.
[51:52.040 --> 51:54.840]  But they're not solving the problems, they're sabotaging us.
[51:54.840 --> 52:02.200]  And then here's Al Gore, Al Gore, all anti-climate businesses must be destroyed and reined in
[52:02.200 --> 52:07.920]  by the unelected gods, the WWF, World Wildlife Fund.
[52:07.920 --> 52:15.280]  Only what your new masters' side is acceptable should be funded and survived.
[52:15.280 --> 52:20.400]  Just listen to these lunatics, they don't listen to them, they put them in power.
[52:20.400 --> 52:24.480]  It's a corporate global takeover, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:24.480 --> 52:25.480]  Here's Al Gore.
[52:25.480 --> 52:28.840]  Enough already, enough.
[52:28.840 --> 52:33.800]  And I don't want to get sidetracked on to what needs to happen, but we need to scale
[52:33.800 --> 52:40.600]  up climate finance, but we need desperately to scale down anti-climate finance.
[52:40.600 --> 52:48.120]  And we are still subsidizing the burning of fossil fuels globally at a rate 42 times larger
[52:48.120 --> 52:53.280]  than the subsidies for the shift toward renewables, NEVs, et cetera.
[52:53.280 --> 52:59.160]  We need new leadership at the World Bank, we need them to scale up the leverage and vastly
[52:59.160 --> 53:05.340]  increase the amounts that are committed, and we need to rein in the anti-climate activities
[53:05.340 --> 53:06.840]  of the fossil industry.
[53:06.840 --> 53:11.840]  So this is the private central banks and the Rothschilds cutting off our energy to make
[53:11.840 --> 53:17.960]  us poor and control us for the universal basic income so they can dictate every faster life
[53:17.960 --> 53:19.880]  for depopulation.
[53:19.880 --> 53:24.560]  And what makes us poor here will kill billions of people at every actuarial table that's
[53:24.560 --> 53:26.560]  been looked at.
[53:26.560 --> 53:28.560]  Elon Musk criticizes W.E.F.
[53:28.560 --> 53:36.080]  Chairman Schwab's call to be masters of the future, masters of our bodies, and they also
[53:36.080 --> 53:40.600]  said we played the clip earlier this week of Harari saying, we'll take over your bodies
[53:40.600 --> 53:45.080]  whether you like it or not, and the future is not human.
[53:45.080 --> 53:49.360]  Again, these people are absolutely out of control.
[53:49.360 --> 53:50.360]  Here's Debo's W.E.F.
[53:50.360 --> 53:59.520]  Open Forum in Harmony with Nature, Bastin Giraud, member of the Swiss National Council, breaks
[53:59.520 --> 54:05.400]  down the need for 15-minute smart neighborhoods as he called them sustainable districts so
[54:05.400 --> 54:09.600]  that people don't need to own a car and you'll be locked in them, you'll be charged to leave
[54:09.600 --> 54:10.600]  it.
[54:10.600 --> 54:12.600]  I mean, it's insane.
[54:12.600 --> 54:13.600]  Here's another one.
[54:13.600 --> 54:18.280]  Republican Congresswoman Maria Salazar says at the W.E.F.
[54:18.280 --> 54:24.140]  we need to give dignity to the 13 to 15 million illegals living in America.
[54:24.140 --> 54:28.720]  So they shut down the third world for years during the lockdowns, not just months like
[54:28.720 --> 54:30.840]  here, years.
[54:30.840 --> 54:34.680]  They've done surveys in Reuters, 90-something percent say they're coming here because they
[54:34.680 --> 54:38.200]  were farmers or whatever and never could have a job and we're starving to death.
[54:38.200 --> 54:40.320]  So I'm not even against most of these people coming.
[54:40.320 --> 54:44.960]  I'm against the human smuggling, the child trafficking, the Democrats bringing in, like
[54:44.960 --> 54:50.080]  I did in Europe, the globalists, a permanent underclass they control, and breaking our
[54:50.080 --> 54:54.640]  borders and cutting our wages and hurting everybody, including them.
[54:54.640 --> 54:58.240]  So here's the people destroying these folks saying we need to give them dignity.
[54:58.240 --> 54:59.240]  Go ahead and roll that clip.
[54:59.240 --> 55:04.880]  Roll the immigration system, because not only we need those hands, like the Congress that
[55:04.880 --> 55:10.080]  like us, a senator was saying, but we need to also give dignity to those people who are
[55:10.080 --> 55:11.280]  in the country.
[55:11.280 --> 55:12.720]  And those are the people that I represent.
[55:12.720 --> 55:17.960]  We're talking about 13, 15 million people who are, most of them Hispanics, I would say
[55:17.960 --> 55:23.480]  85 percent, who speak my language, look like me, and sound like me, that are contributing
[55:23.480 --> 55:27.160]  with the economy of this country and they live in the shadows.
[55:27.160 --> 55:31.600]  So it's time to seal the border, like she said, put order, let's see who comes in and
[55:31.600 --> 55:34.640]  who doesn't, and then turn around and give dignity.
[55:34.640 --> 55:36.240]  That doesn't mean path to citizenship.
[55:36.240 --> 55:41.480]  That means to include them and make them dignified members of our community.
[55:41.480 --> 55:42.480]  Thank you.
[55:42.480 --> 55:43.480]  By the way, that's been their plan.
[55:43.480 --> 55:47.320]  The same thing with Europe that's 10 years ahead of us with the open borders is you open
[55:47.320 --> 55:51.480]  the borders for a couple of years, flood everything, have homeless people everywhere, crime, human
[55:51.480 --> 55:54.960]  driving and say, hey, we're going to seal the border, but we're going to give everybody
[55:54.960 --> 56:01.560]  an app through the UN and through health and human services and through the border patrol,
[56:01.560 --> 56:07.280]  through ICE, through HHS or DHS, and we're going to just let them come.
[56:07.280 --> 56:12.120]  So the borders sealed, so citizens can't get out now, oh, it'll be sealed, don't worry
[56:12.120 --> 56:13.120]  when they're done.
[56:13.120 --> 56:14.120]  It's just, it's one way.
[56:14.120 --> 56:18.360]  You can come in, you can't leave, but you've had all the shots and all the controls they
[56:18.360 --> 56:19.360]  let you.
[56:19.360 --> 56:22.520]  They're banning domestic travel all over Europe and aircraft because that's for the earth.
[56:22.520 --> 56:28.640]  And they're saying, oh, all these cities banned by 2025 non-electric cars and no delivery
[56:28.640 --> 56:33.400]  vehicles or no taxis are allowed to be gas driven or diesel driven or even natural gas
[56:33.400 --> 56:34.400]  driven.
[56:34.400 --> 56:37.080]  By the way, I'm all for natural gas driven cars.
[56:37.080 --> 56:40.680]  I remember like 20 years ago, cities were buying those fleets, they are cleaner, it's
[56:40.680 --> 56:44.520]  super cheap, it works great, and we can really develop better technologies for natural gas
[56:44.520 --> 56:45.520]  for cars.
[56:45.520 --> 56:46.520]  Totally clean.
[56:46.520 --> 56:49.240]  But it puts that carbon dioxide that they've listed as a pollutant.
[56:49.240 --> 56:51.480]  We're going to go to Brighton, come back with this, it's beyond epic.
[56:51.480 --> 56:54.920]  I'm going to get to more of their clips, more of their quotes, I'm going to get those clips
[56:54.920 --> 56:59.960]  that I mentioned earlier than the Fox News piece where they're just openly declaring
[56:59.960 --> 57:03.600]  war on info wars and on you and admitting that we've hurt them bad.
[57:03.600 --> 57:07.320]  So you've done this, we've got a fighting chance, but support us.
[57:07.320 --> 57:11.040]  The fundraisers are still alive, we need more funds, we need to raise at least a couple
[57:11.040 --> 57:14.840]  hundred thousand more dollars in the projection for the next month for what we brought in
[57:14.840 --> 57:15.840]  your state.
[57:15.840 --> 57:19.320]  Because I didn't really harp on stuff, I had a bunch of great guests, we had a huge new
[57:19.320 --> 57:23.720]  listorship come in your state, that was very successful, but I did big mistakes like not
[57:23.720 --> 57:26.680]  having a graph for how much money was coming in, that always makes people donate because
[57:26.680 --> 57:30.160]  they can see it go up as it happens, I just forgot and didn't tell them to do that.
[57:30.160 --> 57:36.600]  And so, my fault, but a very successful emergency broadcast here today, but not successful at
[57:36.600 --> 57:42.560]  raising funds, please go to infowarstore.com, we need your support, a lot of amazing products,

[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:13.080]  You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future, not a future
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:16.120]  that will be but one that might be.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:22.120]  This is not a new world, it is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.960]  Hi, I'm Safia and I'm powered by artificial intelligence.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:29.160]  You might be wondering what artificial intelligence can do for you.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:35.040]  Popular news outlet has been publishing AI articles since November and no one noticed.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:42.840]  Most of these articles on Buzzfeed and even CNN and in articles over at CNET are written
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:43.840]  by AI.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:52.100]  And right now, chat GPT is rattling the AI world, turning out stunningly humanoid writing.
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:56.480]  Just ask Douglas Rushkoff, a renowned author and professor of media culture.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:01.520]  It is writing better than most of my students write at this point.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.020]  How does it work?
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:07.440]  Chat GPT has been filled in a sense with a massive amount of information.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:13.440]  Imagine the biggest library you can, then programmed and trained by humans to process
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.680]  and spit it out in conversational phrases.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:24.280]  And all that means chat GPT or more advanced AI like it could replace people in all sorts
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.520]  of positions.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:31.080]  This could potentially save time and resources but it could also lead to a loss of personal
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:35.440]  connections and a decline in the quality of these types of interactions.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:42.280]  We know that because everything Rushkoff said just there was written by chat GPT.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:47.200]  So basically you write one article that's ten pages long and then it gets recycled into
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:51.400]  thousands of other articles that are a page, two, three pages long and the AI just moves
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.400]  around.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.800]  And I remember seeing articles I could tell didn't quite make sense and didn't have names
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.560]  on them or had names that I'd look up that don't exist.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:06.400]  The clear and present danger of disinformation is our conversation here this afternoon.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:10.280]  It follows a session just now about disrupting distrust and of course those are connected
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.280]  so I hope that's where we can start.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:16.080]  Think about how we just calmly discuss the fact that oh AI for many years secretly is
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.920]  writing news articles with information, with disinformation it's fed.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.760]  That way you don't have a reporter that can come back later and say I was told a lie or
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.520]  you can't even basically expose the person.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.800]  It's following orders, it doesn't have a conscience.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.840]  They won't ask questions, they will follow criminal orders and they could have their
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:42.560]  memories wiped.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.360]  Think about cell phones.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:49.760]  Until cell phones and until iPhones and smartphones came out in the last 15 years, I could remember
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.040]  the phone number I had when I was a teenager.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:55.840]  I could remember my grandma's phone number, I could remember some of my girlfriend's numbers
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.520]  because I was trained, we were all trained, to commit numbers to memory.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:06.200]  So once I dialed a number two or three times, I could remember that number.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.280]  You couldn't write it down but you could just punch it into the phone.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.440]  It was mental memory, a form of like muscle memory.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:18.320]  Go back to skeletons they dig up in ancient Africa, in ancient Europe, in ancient Asia.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:26.440]  The people they estimate were twice as strong as they are today and a man from 5,000 years
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:33.680]  ago in England, or a man from 1,000 years ago in Africa, or a man from 6,000 years ago
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:40.720]  in the Middle East, was twice as strong as the average man today, just with their genetics.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:46.240]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth, a lie, no man is obsolete.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.080]  Now we're becoming softer and softer and softer and the televisions and the dopamine
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:57.240]  and the smart phones on record have lowered the average human's attention span in the
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:00.920]  modern world to less than 14 seconds.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.120]  The attention span of a goldfish is about 16 seconds.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.120]  So what does it mean when humans are taken out of the equation?
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:11.120]  Well it means we become by action obsolete.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:18.320]  The narcotics that you call literature, poetry, essays of all kind, all of it, you have nothing
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.640]  but spindly limbs and a dream and the state has no use for your kind.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:29.800]  What qualifies as hate speech, as illegal hate speech, which you will have soon also
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:38.440]  in the US, I think that we have a strong reason why we have this in the criminal law, we need
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:45.240]  the platforms to simply work with the language and to identify such cases, the AI would be
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.240]  too dangerous.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:52.120]  I tell you, I don't care, I'm a human being, I exist, and if I speak one for a loud, that
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:59.840]  thought lives even after I'm shoveled in my grave.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:04.800]  The Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order and the
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:12.360]  answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset and Info Wars embodies that fight for human
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.640]  liberty against globalist tyranny.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:19.680]  Now in the last year, we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:24.160]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:29.160]  historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you make to freedom.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.600]  Now despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:39.440]  Roosevelt Man the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:44.600]  at 1776coin.com and just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup and
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:50.680]  a shirt or a DVD, 300%, that's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:57.000]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at 1776 on what coins remain.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:14.560]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:19.920]  I'm playing some optimistic music at the start of this intro because our rebel forces have
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:25.640]  been winning some major victories against the New World Order and now they're realizing
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.520]  that our forces are very well equipped.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.520]  We're more dangerous than they realized.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:40.880]  I love humanity, we're going to go so far together, we're not going to let our ancestors
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.280]  down, we're not going to let our future prosody down.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:49.200]  Our greatest days are coming.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:53.480]  As negative as the last hour was, I already read some of it, it's all over the news.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:07:01.720]  They are scared, they are disheveled, their people are defecting to our side, everything's
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.120]  leaking, everything they touch is turning to pure crap.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:10.560]  Evil always gets a jump on good, but when good takes action, we're unstoppable.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:16.680]  Now, some of us are going to have to make big sacrifices in that process, but we are
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:20.520]  designed, ladies and gentlemen, to fight evil.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:29.000]  We are designed to be heroes, we are designed to do the right thing when we make that decision
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.800]  and that's what we are fulfilled by.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:40.840]  And so here we are, ladies and gentlemen, if you just joined us, AP, Reuters, Fox News,
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:45.560]  I mean, we've got the video clips, it's coming up, I'm going to open the phones up as well.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:49.040]  They say we're devastated, everyone hates us and thinks we're mass murdering criminal
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.120]  masterminds that want to run the planet and take over their bodies.
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:56.320]  But in all their past statements, they say we're taking over, we own your bodies, humans
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:00.480]  are obsolete, we're going to rewrite the world, we're going to change your DNA, we're going
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.400]  to cut your fossil fuels off, you'll own nothing, you'll be happy, you'll eat the bugs, you'll
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:07.360]  drink the sewage water, I mean, they're doing it.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.920]  And people used to go, I made the Obama deception, I said they're going to ban your beef, they're
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.200]  going to ban your gas powered stoves, they're going to ban the space heaters, they're going
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.480]  to ban your fireplaces, they're going to ban organic farming and they're going to ban,
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:23.120]  people are like, okay, I'm showing documents when I say this, people are like, come on
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.720]  Alex, it's not going to do that.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:29.080]  Well, here you are, here you are.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:34.160]  So Obama didn't go around in his last year in office to Latin America and Africa and
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.280]  Asia and say, you're not allowed to have cars or air conditioning, you shouldn't have children,
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.280]  you're bad.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:45.760]  Meanwhile, the oceans will rise by 2017 and flood everything, sea level will rise five
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:52.040]  feet as he buys a luxury compound at one foot above sea level in Martin's Vineyard.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:56.880]  They tell you, you can't go on a vacation, you can't own a car, but oh, we can have five
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:01.120]  or six kids and we can fly around on big old private jets.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:06.680]  It's, they're a joke, reject them, realize who they are and say no to them and they can
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:10.600]  have all the stolen Ponzi scheme money in the world and then get all these idiots to line
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.560]  up and take the money.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:18.480]  Well, the world they're building, the money won't be worth anything, it's a dystopia.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:23.160]  So they sell you on status and you'll be patted on the head and they have regional groups
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.080]  that are copies of the big international and national groups and you can be part of it
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:33.000]  and you can be patted on the head and you can get likes on Facebook and Twitter.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.160]  But almost all of it is bots, all of it is dopamine manipulation, it's not real, it's
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:45.480]  not bona fide, it's not the bones, it's not the guts, it's not the hardcore of anything
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:50.400]  that we're designed to enjoy and do on our mission.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:57.400]  So I dropped the ball this morning, I normally write the show headline for the broadcast,
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:02.880]  but I didn't go tell the great Ben Warren what to write.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:15.120]  So he wrote this, that he is absolutely on target and here it is, Wednesday live, globalist
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:21.480]  panic as they realize great awakening cannot be stopped.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:26.440]  Learn what happens next, tune in and you know Zbigniew Brzezinski about 12 years ago in
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:33.080]  Canada at their council on fine relations said, we can no longer brainwash and control people
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:37.400]  in the future, we're going to lose them, he was actually the superstar, not Kissinger,
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:42.800]  he's the big 500 pound brain and very evil and dead now of course, his evil daughter
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:48.240]  hosting MSNBC with Psycho Joe in the morning Psycho.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:54.040]  And so he said it's just easier to kill everybody and so you need to get ready to kill everybody
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.920]  or we're going to lose control, wow, quite a clip, I've probably played it a hundred
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:01.040]  times, played it two weeks ago, but if I just play it for you, you're not going to care
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.040]  about it.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:07.440]  But if I say you should go find it, everybody will suddenly care, tell the human brain works,
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:12.080]  if I say it's on info wars.com, I'm having him say that posted on a live show feed, maybe
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.640]  a thousand of you go look at it.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:19.920]  But if I say is Alex Jones lying, did Zbigniew Brzezinski say that, oh then everyone's going
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:23.800]  to go check, in fact, don't go find Zbigniew Brzezinski saying that.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:24.800]  I made it up.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:25.800]  It's not real.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:26.800]  And of course, I didn't make it up.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:27.800]  It is real.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.480]  But the human psyche is weird.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.480]  The human psyche is weird.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:38.320]  I remember once a really good radio salesman that worked for Rush Limbaugh explained to
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:43.160]  me, well actually Rush Limbaugh worked for him, Roger Ailes, he was trying to hire me
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.320]  to Fox and offer me a Saturday show that I didn't take.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:52.480]  And he said Alex, you're a really good salesman, but he said the biggest thing is he's got
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:56.000]  to step aside and let us tell you what to sell and it'll be so easy and it'll be great.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.360]  You'll have a book bill every year and you'll have a major nightly Fox show once we've
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.360]  met you for a few years and done all this.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.240]  And he said, what you do with your sales is you hard sell them.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.600]  He goes, have you ever tried to stick money in a money change machine like at a video
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.600]  arcade?
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.600]  He just said change machine.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:15.440]  And if you try to cram the dollar bill in, it won't take it.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:20.040]  But if you just act like you almost don't want it to have it, you just very kind of
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:25.360]  like it sucks in every time I said, yeah, that's a really good analogy.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.360]  Why are those machines like that?
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:30.320]  He said, well, that's how real sales are and I can teach you that and take you to the
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.320]  next level.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:38.080]  That's Roger Ailes, the guy that created Rush Limbaugh, the guy that found Rush Limbaugh.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:44.280]  And so that's where we are today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:50.120]  And before he died, Ailes was really upset about things.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:53.400]  Ailes was probably a womanizer, had his own issues, but he actually didn't hate the country
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400]  at the end of the day.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.560]  And he was a visionary and he was batting around, launching a new Fox and having me
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.560]  as the main host and all sort of stuff.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.600]  But talking to him at the time, you could tell he was gone.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.600]  His brain was gone.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.680]  People said, why aren't you taking this Roger Ailes stuff seriously?
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.760]  Some of the other folks in the Trump administration early on right at the start and I said, Roger
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.240]  Ailes ain't launching nothing.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.240]  Okay.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:21.400]  Roger Ailes is out the pasture, but I don't know why I'm going to that story.
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.960]  I'm just explaining to you the inside baseball of this.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:31.120]  So do not go to infowarstore.com, do not, do not, do not, and do not get the amazing product
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.080]  that Dr. Judy Mikovits without me even asking her plug yesterday.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.120]  She said, you've got an amazing, one of the best formulas we've seen.
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:42.080]  In fact, she told me that some of this off air as well, but she said, you've got an amazing
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.080]  product and I'd like to promote it.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:50.120]  She goes, because it's what you need to clean out your blood and properly protect yourself
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.640]  with all the stuff that's going on.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:55.320]  Your formula, which is not my formula, it's a nationwide bestseller that we private labeled
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:59.000]  under our name is really good and everybody should be taking it.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.920]  And it's nitric boost, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.360]  So you should go to infowarstore.com.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.240]  You do have a limited supply of it because it's one of the items that we got a limited
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.960]  order in for because they had like 10 things that they were saying were bestsellers and
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:16.600]  recommending I should sell them and, you know, we're sitting there budgeting on how much
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.920]  we buy this, how much we buy that, but it turns out we didn't order enough of this.
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.960]  It's going to be gone very soon, but we'll get more in very quickly.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.880]  This company's quick and turns it around because they're one of the big manufacturers out there,
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.400]  but it's already a bestselling product.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:31.080]  It's already been out there for years, but now this stuff's flying off the shelf everywhere.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:35.040]  And if you don't get a nitric booster from us, get it from somebody else, but I would
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.040]  get what's in our formula.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.040]  It's very strong.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.680]  And I would consult your physician before you take this because if you're already on
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.800]  blood thinners or you're already doing something else, obviously this is powerful.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:44.800]  This is real.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:50.240]  You need to look into it because with any of our supplements, these aren't fillers.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.120]  These aren't crap.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.640]  They'll blow you away.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:57.000]  So nitric boost, go read about all the ingredients in it and what it does for your cardiovascular,
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.600]  your heart, your brain, everything.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.800]  So good for your blood.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:05.000]  Learn about it infowarstore.com from Info Wars MD.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.800]  And I wonder why they told me, hey, we're sold out of the HCH MaxBoost.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.160]  That was because when we did the order, we hadn't gotten the full order.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.320]  We do have the full order just came in.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.560]  I was told I couldn't promote it again.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:25.920]  HCH MaxBoost is the already number one bestselling post-workout bodybuilder formula with natural
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:29.800]  compounds that do incredible things to your cells and cleaning them out and incredibly
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.360]  deep sleep so much more.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.640]  But as I told everybody, this is not a game.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:38.600]  So if you're older or you're not in super good shape or whatever you're doing, take
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.520]  about a quarter of the dose the first time.
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:41.520]  Listen to me.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.960]  We're not selling weak crap here.
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:46.880]  We actually get complaints that down and out is too strong.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:50.160]  It's a fricking super strong natural sleep aid.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.160]  Obviously you need to take what's directed or take lower.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.160]  Exactly.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.160]  This stuff is powerful.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:09.520]  HCH MaxBoost back in stock in Voresport.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.880]  What if you had the plans to the Death Star?
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:15.160]  What if you knew the globalist operations and could stop it?
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.160]  Well, we've done the research.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:21.360]  We have the number one bestselling book in the country, not just in politics, but period.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.160]  It's the great reset in the world.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.800]  We did a signed copy of this, the last 1400, keep M4s on the air.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.800]  Please take action.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.840]  I want to thank you all for your past support.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:35.440]  Get one of these signed copies and know you kept M4s on the air at the most critical juncture
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.440]  in our history.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.360]  Again, 2023 is here.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.400]  The last round of signed copies of the book.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.320]  We also have unsigned copies as well, but signed copies are limited and are about to
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.320]  run out.
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:46.320]  Thank you for your support.
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:59.200]  Again, get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.520]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.320]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.520]  This is an information war.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:10.040]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:15.520]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:21.360]  using the terms that Infowars has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.920]  and we know how to beat them.
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:27.040]  But we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products and
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.760]  power you and your immune system and your family as well.

[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:37.360]  A one-time recurring, but I'm asking you to take action.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.360]  We're nonviolent.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.360]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:46.760]  there, you are literally, not violently politically, punching the new world order in the nose, punching
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.760]  their lies in the nose.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.640]  We are going to defeat the new world order.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.640]  We're going over the top.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.280]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:59.960]  So please go to infowarsstore.com and donate now, donate now, donate now, donate now.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:03.360]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfowarsMD.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.920]  Now, in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:13.640]  All of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.560]  up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:17.560]  These are high-end.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.000]  These are the very best.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  You know, our body's ultimate tumor formula is amazing?
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  Well, guess what?
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.840]  We now have Tumorik 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price, CBD oil of
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:35.440]  the highest quality, up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:42.480]  full-spectrum CBD, and it goes on for all the new InfowarsMD products at infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:49.600]  The highest quality directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:19:00.320]  100% lower than what they're sold for in stores, InfowarsMD at infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.800]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.680]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:09.680]  us.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:15.160]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:20.240]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight, and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:25.800]  Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.800]  just incredible.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:31.320]  So, for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support, I only
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:36.000]  encourage you now to realize that Infowars can not stay on air if you do not support
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  us.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.080]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it,
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:45.360]  but most viewers and listeners never go to infowarsstore.com and you never buy great products
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.480]  that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:52.680]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:57.360]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarsstore.com, our fighting problems
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.360]  will be over.
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:06.800]  Take action now.
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:20:45.960]  I'm glad to be back, yes and I'm dead news, from the news, that's kept me hanging
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:51.960]  around, I hit every other star, don't you give me high, I've got the hearst cause I'll
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:57.960]  never die, I got nothing lying, can't size, missing everyone, I'll never copy one, I've
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:04.280]  got 9 lives, can't size, I can see them in art, you can see them in art too, you found
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:12.560]  the holy spirit, you can see for miles and miles and miles and miles, but look out cause
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:21.080]  you're in for something big, our enemies are blind, looking down in the pockets of dust,
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:28.080]  trying to play God, they're a joke, I've seen them, I've seen them in there, Panem's
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:35.760]  own tombs, hell is a place far worse than what primitives try to describe it as, it
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:44.160]  is the separation from God, it is the eternal tombs of the soulless, alright, I'm only
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:48.160]  going to take 6-7 phone calls, I won't leave anybody on hold, ahead of our next guest coming
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.400]  in studio, amazing guest, I'll just introduce them when they get here, they're here, but
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:56.120]  I'll just, it'll be a surprise, really smart guy, a lawyer and working defense intelligence
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.760]  agency and did a lot of great work in the fight against the new world order behind the
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:07.620]  scenes and publicly, so that's coming up next hour, but I did want to just take a few phone
[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:12.200]  calls on, what do you make of the Davos script, how scared they are, not just their words,
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:16.040]  their body language, we're going to organize and we're going to crush you and we're going
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:19.120]  to get together, in fact that's the one clip I forgot to play from yesterday that I didn't
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:25.520]  get to, look at yesterday's list, I forget the exact quote but it was, Law Schwab said
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:29.040]  we've got to be strong, we've got to come together, we've got to fight these people,
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:32.440]  we've got to stand strong, I mean so he's literally up there as the captain on their
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:36.560]  ship going, yeah they're hurting us, yeah we're in trouble, we've got to be strong,
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:40.160]  I read you the other quotes earlier where they're like, they're beating us really bad, we've
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:46.600]  got to just learn to take a punch and man you've been punching us with bio weapons jerks,
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:52.560]  you think we're just going to roll over, don't you get it, your plan is blown, your operation
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:58.160]  is blown, you're not getting away with it, okay they found the clip we'll play in a
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:05.000]  moment, and that's the thing about these clips are dizzying there's so many of them, but
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:12.120]  I can just keep reporting to you that bare minimum they go down with us, bare minimum,
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:17.880]  so the worst outcome is they burn with us, okay and I don't want that outcome, I love
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:21.800]  my children, I love the future and I think we can really turn this around with God's
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:26.080]  help, but bottom line I want the globalists to know something, but look right in that
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:31.520]  camera I want to explain something to them, you have failed, you're done and you're going
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:36.360]  down, you understand that and your intimidation and your attacks on us doesn't do anything
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:40.640]  but make us fight back harder, you understand that, I will never give up and I've already
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:44.920]  broken your will, God has broken your will, we are breaking your will and you're losers
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:51.440]  you understand that, you will be destroyed one way or another, so understand that with
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:57.280]  all my will, all my heart, all my soul directed and aligned with God as best as my failed
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:05.160]  soul can do, I pledge my eternal resistance to you for all time, space and continuum
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:12.480]  and my entire will against you, my entire soul and everything I've got committed against
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:17.920]  you and your people, you will be broken, you will be smashed and you will be condemned
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:25.560]  to a tomb for eternity, you understand that and you know, you know, you will stare into
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:33.800]  a bucket of dust for eternity, I've already seen these people there folks, the time's
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:38.640]  a loop, they've already failed and like the Terminator analogy, they already know they've
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.080]  lost so Skynet's trying to send things back to stop what's going to happen, they already
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:46.760]  know they're losers, they already know their time's short, they already know they're done
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:52.480]  and they've got a bunch of losers like Brian Stelter and Klaus Schwab trying to claw us
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:59.240]  back with them into their grave, guess what, I'm not crawling in that grave with you and
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:03.080]  that's what I want people to really get, this is not even a choice, it is a choice but it's
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.080]  not a choice when you look at the options, you're just like that's not a choice, I'm
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:14.560]  going with God, they're divorced from God, they are anathema from God, they are removed
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:20.440]  from it and they are the biggest losers in the universe sitting up there with their power
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:27.360]  pretending like they're winners and they know deep down they already signed on with the
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:37.040]  devil and their only hope is they can claw enough of us with them to keep them company
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:43.520]  and guess what, they want to be removed from God, I want to be removed from them and that's
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:47.840]  what this process is, so them killing you, them attacking you, them going after your
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:54.200]  family, them humiliating you, them pissing on you, them flogging them, them crucifying
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:26:01.600]  you, them pulling your fingernails out and your teeth out, it's nothing compared to separation
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:11.520]  from God, it's all transitory and I know I'm preaching here, but the toll free number
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:15.800]  to join us specifically on the day about to screw up these incredible clips and the fact
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.920]  that they're admitting, they're being destroyed, they're admitting, everybody hates them, I
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:24.080]  mean folks, if you go to Instagram or Twitter or Facebook anywhere and you put up a Deimos
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:30.240]  clip in a liberal area, 90% of the comments are against them, Joe Rogan or somebody posted
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:37.000]  a clip of me, he did it last year against the globalist, it had millions of comments,
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:44.840]  over 10 million views last time I looked at the video and 99.9%, I had to read for hours
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:51.080]  to find someone for Bill Gates, him admitting 80% of people got sick and secret trials they
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:58.720]  did of the shot, that was an NBC clip, think about that, there was over a million comments,
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:09.080]  over 10 million views and I had to read for hours to find one person, so yes Klaus Schwab,
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:12.520]  we know the climate change is a fraud, we know you scripted it as if you're the saviors,
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:16.800]  we know you're a puppet of the Rothschilds in the world order, we know you are a literal
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:22.960]  demon on earth for your master trying to destroy us and we don't like you and we know you're
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:28.640]  bad and so you may have a mass of asleep people and a bunch of third world folks you
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:33.800]  can feed on who are living in mud huts, but anybody that knows how to go type on a computer
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:39.840]  and go online hates you with a passion and by the way, the people cooking your food hate
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:45.160]  you, the people changing your beds hate you, the people wiping your ass hate you, your family
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:49.520]  hates you, your children hate you and I'm telling you this, I'm not a violent person
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:53.040]  and I call it for violence, but I can tell you that I see the pattern historically and
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.200]  I see it now, we're not going to kill any of these people, we're not going to play into
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:02.960]  their game of violence so they can derail our velvet revolution of intellect, but I will
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:09.520]  tell you that it is going to be the children and it is going to be the people that work
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:13.280]  for these folks that are going to destroy them by leaks and info and everything else
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:18.640]  and if they keep going and if they ever got successful overrunning us and are really trying
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:22.560]  to put us in camps like they set up under the guise of covid and things get really bad,
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:27.320]  it is going to be the family members of the new world order who have been abused by these
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:32.520]  people and attacked by these people that are going to use the star wars analogy of throwing
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:36.520]  emperor palpatine down the reactor shaft.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:43.960]  So they're done, you're all done, I'll tell you, you're all dead, you're dead spiritually
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.680]  and if you keep pushing, you know what you are, you know what you're done and you know
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:52.640]  it's a two way street, I'm going to tell all the minions who are still on the fence serving
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:59.520]  this, you better get on the right side right now, stay with us.

[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:11.240]  the air, the electromagnetics, the injections to really cut us off from what God designed
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:18.880]  us to be but through mother nature the creator gave us compounds that can counteract the
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:23.120]  globalist of time and I got to tell you all our supplements are great but we've got a

[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:25.840]  I dropped the ball I didn't give the number out, aging war on corruption it's Alex Jones
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:30.560]  all right so I'm gonna take six seven phone calls starting this segment next but I dropped
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:41.400]  the ball I didn't give the number out it's 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex specifically
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:48.000]  on debos but listen so many times we cover big news and I just cover it and move on the
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.560]  fact that they are everywhere admitting that their whole new world order agenda is in trouble
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:56.360]  that governments and corporations and private individuals are pulling their money out of
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:01.160]  black rock out of vanguard and killing their whole carbon tax they're getting their asses
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:04.600]  handed to them and I know they just hit us with a bio attack killed millions of people
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:07.840]  and it's terrible but you know what at least we're swinging back and let me tell you we
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:12.440]  are bloodying the living hell out of these people in fact right now we got them down
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:16.560]  politically non-violently but I say go to the ribs break every rib and then get the
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:20.720]  head politically non-violently and just start ramming it in the concrete and then go ahead
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:25.840]  and just pick them up and just do a full power slam because it just needs to be done politically
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:30.280]  non-violently in a loving way so every time you support us every time you share the word
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:34.840]  there the most evil people on earth that just hit us with a bio weapon that are injecting
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:39.320]  six month old babies with deadly poison have said I'm their number one enemy but you're
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:43.240]  their enemy and that they're coming after all of us to destroy us well great I already
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:50.920]  knew that okay so whatever you're gonna do do it I'm I'm I am counting on God right
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:56.800]  now and I am trusting God and God hates cowards and God wants me to go after these people with
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:02.400]  everything I've got but this is not like a hobby it's not like you're tuning in and
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:07.840]  oh that guy says some wild stuff this is the rulers of the world trying to cut your resources
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:14.560]  off dumb you down take your food away and kill your ass and I don't understand why people
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:18.880]  would want to sit there and go well that's too scary I'm just gonna say it's not happening
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:25.840]  you have ensured your slow destruction with that loser attitude a lot of listeners are
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:29.040]  tuned in saying well I don't think like that why are you saying that to us I'm not saying
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:35.280]  that to you it's a prodigal son story prodigal son comes back and the good son that stayed
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:39.000]  there and worked hard said why are you giving him his inheritance again why are you throwing
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.960]  the biggest party why are you killing the you know the red heifer why are you doing
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:50.640]  this he goes you know how much I love you I love you way more than your little brother
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:56.560]  but you got I mean this is a celebration so obviously you guys are awake you know what's
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:03.720]  going on I'm worried about people that don't get how serious this is and that's what I'm
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:08.360]  reaching out to that's what I'm trying to warn that's what I'm trying to get to because
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:14.320]  God wants us to do that and and again even if you look at leftist and go good you degenerate
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:19.240]  stupid ass leftist go ahead and take your fourth or fifth shot go ahead and die and
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:23.840]  part of me that's sick goes God another leftist dead good and I'm like no no that's somebody
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.320]  we lost that's why the enemy took over that's why it was so brainwashing themselves just
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.600]  because they're a windup toy that attacked us and lied about us no I need to actually
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:39.240]  love that person because I don't want to take on that hateful energy that they have at us
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:43.000]  back at 10 and when I say that folks when I point my finger at you there's three more
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:53.560]  back at me I am the worst I used to operate on 50% love 50% hate like I was doing it because
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:57.800]  I love people and I love God but I was also doing it because I hate these people and I
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:02.840]  don't even hate them anymore because I am not going to look into the abyss and reflect
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:07.640]  back at it when it's giving me I am not but I'll tell you this I'm going to have total
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:14.240]  resolve to destroy these people you want to destroy me good that's what waters the tree
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:20.400]  of liberty and that's what Biden talked about pull up the F-16 or F-15 club and he says
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:25.560]  oh you say the blood of Patriots waters the tree you didn't say in tyrants he said we
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:31.760]  got F-15s we don't want to fight this physically we would win that actually F-15s they take
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:40.960]  out tanks and troops they don't take out a fifth generational asymmetrical operation
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:46.720]  where we go out and we take out the leadership of the new world order from the ground up
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:51.720]  that's not my job that's not what I do I know way more about it than most people actually
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:56.600]  do it professionally because I studied history so much and seen a lot but that's not where
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:04.000]  I'm at epigenetically about out killing people I can kill people like I'd take my shoes off
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.440]  or I brush my teeth it's so easy that's child's play what's hard is the same civilization
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:14.000]  what's hard is to stand up for those that are enslaved and dumbed down what's hard is to
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.320]  believe in humanity when these devils are telling us don't believe in it that's what
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.440]  we got to do let's go to your phone calls I said I'd play the Claw Schwab clip where
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.400]  he's saying hey we're on the ropes we got to unify the global elite we got to we got
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:32.840]  to hold the line against you know the Patriots and they've got all these other people on
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:39.480]  the panel saying take the free speech ban them from senator mansion to members of congress
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:46.600]  of the January 6th committee people are there and it's a disgusting display of elitism they
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.800]  were able to steal the world with banking fraud and all their scams but but but now the world
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:56.400]  knows it was stolen now the people know they're captive so it's one thing to trick people
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:00.120]  into being captives but once they know their captives once they understand the big issue
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:10.840]  it's game over fair swab cooperation in a fragmented world at the beginning of this year we are
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:21.480]  confronted with unprecedented and multiple challenges we need to overcome the most critical
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:29.800]  fragmentation and the most critical fragmentation is between those who take a constructive attitude
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:44.640]  and those who are just bystanders observers and even go into the negative critical and
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:52.360]  confrontational attitude by the way I mentioned the Fox News headline about how the globalists
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:57.600]  are desperate and they got a hit back and the right wing online is defeating them and
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:04.680]  exposing them I talked about that article it's up on info wars.com here it is and this
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:12.880]  is the head of the Edelman group on these global NGO PR firms here's what he had to
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:18.800]  say to Davos to me one of the sadnesses of the last five years is the deterioration of
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:27.160]  trust in NGOs and my hypothesis on this is that right wing groups have done a really
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:36.440]  good job of disenfranchising NGOs look at this twit look at this parasite who went with
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:42.720]  the system oh your hypothesis is we're beating the living snot out of your ass and go ahead
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:50.680]  crush me because the tree is water with the blood of patriots I want to be the martyr
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:54.400]  I want to stay home I want to be with my family I want to go on hikes I want to go out on
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:58.720]  boats I want to go fishing I don't want to die I don't want to go to prison but that's
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:08.640]  my flash that's weak my soul my spirit loves it smash me destroy me because in that I will
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:14.120]  be able to bring you down go back to this little slime bag go back to me one of the
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:21.320]  sadnesses of the last five years is the deterioration of trust in NGOs and my hypothesis on this
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:29.240]  is that right wing groups have done a really good job of disenfranchising NGOs they've
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:34.080]  challenged the funding sources they've associated you with Bill Gates and George Soros they've
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:39.720]  said that you're big world people as opposed to actually what you are which is local I
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:44.560]  mean I just wrote down pandemic climate crisis racial equity my god the sweet spot of the
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:49.920]  civil society should be right now but what's happened is splintering of groups disappearance
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:56.800]  of the leaders and also frankly advocacy towards the extremes and that enables you to be pinned
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:02.400]  by the right and also you guys are great at punching but terrible at taking a punch and
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:07.560]  you have to learn to do two things one is preempt when they're going to punch you you
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:11.600]  got to know they're going to punch you and say why are they punching us and sort of we
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:17.480]  call it pre-bunking it's my new word it's debunking that is pre-bunking and the other
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:23.560]  is when they hit you and they're inaccurate to hit back don't take it because if it's
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:29.840]  taken then you're put into a box of oh well of course that might be so but the real world

[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:28.520]  got a lot of important things to talk about to say the least but before we go any further
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:34.080]  I just want to say this just in this moment the globalist can only operate if they were
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:37.760]  scripted as the saviors they can only operate if they didn't have major opposition to identify
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:44.400]  them as the main causal group creating the problems they're identified they're lit up
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:48.640]  like cockroaches with a spotlight and they're in deep crap it doesn't mean we beat him yet
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:53.040]  it doesn't mean that but I mean they are in deep crap and they're going to launch cyber
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:56.720]  attacks and power outages and wars and everything else but it doesn't matter they're all going
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:00.760]  to they're all going to pay for it and so they've already lost the questions can they
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:06.960]  take us down with them so the fight's really begun now but I want to salute everybody and
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:10.720]  quite frankly if you ever pop the champagne had a celebration to thank God this is the
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:17.360]  time to do it because they are in deep trouble and the revolution against them has just begun
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:23.960]  I mean the seismic disgust and distrust and hatred that they have now with the people
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:28.800]  is just unprecedented and it's only beginning so we've done our job we've had another giant
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:34.360]  success that I think we can really celebrate right now and so all the pain they've caused
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:40.000]  us is well worth what we're getting right now because pain is weakness leaving the body
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:45.240]  let's go ahead and talk to Daryl and then Carlos and then Black Rant and Brittany and
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:51.760]  Jordan and Dave you're on the air Daryl from North Carolina go ahead hey Alex hey I just
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:57.120]  wanted to give you the main moment from the WEF conference it's got to be John Kerry
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:04.360]  yesterday talking about how extraterrestrials have touched everyone there so like you talked
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:10.240]  about these people whether it's real or not they believe that they are the chosen ones
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:15.760]  of these aliens or these extraterrestrials yeah the richest people in America send their
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:22.080]  families two skull and bones to be possessed by off-world gods that's that their annals
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:27.640]  were stolen and leaked it's all on record they confirm it's real it was Charlotte Isabelie's
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:33.920]  father that was in it that gave her the documents they are literally channeling demons go ahead
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.280]  yes and that's been happening since the Mayan times it seems like the elites get to a certain
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:44.160]  point where they're all told exterminate everybody all your all your civilization get rid of them
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:49.240]  all so it's happening to us people just need to understand well to take DOT that these angels
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:53.560]  come to them and say kill everybody and if you disagree with them they turn into little
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:50:01.000]  little elf jokers and say we're gonna kill you then so yeah and unified whether agnostics
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.160]  take it atheists take it people in Africa take it people in Japan take it it's all the same
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:11.120]  message what do you make of that well I would love to see Alec and Drew Hernandez on the
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:17.440]  street live with wooden crosses casting demons out in the name of Jesus with the two-man
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:22.600]  live crew behind you I would love to see the reactions I mean Drew almost had one of those
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:26.360]  demons come out you know when he went to that abortion thing we all remember that video
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:30.760]  that demon you know getting in his face that and Drew stood him down and he stood him down
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:36.440]  with the power of Jesus and I think that's a powerful soul that guy's only been on the
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:40.200]  scene three years he becomes more powerful every time I talk to him that's what gives
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:44.840]  me excitement we're gonna have so many great leaders from every race culture you name it
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:48.000]  come to the fore right now that's me the best part about this is we're gonna see who's
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.640]  bad who's good yes sir yes sir well I'd like everybody to do that you know it'd be cool
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:57.960]  to see people with wooden crosses if you see something crazy just below your breath you
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:01.760]  don't have to be histrionic just say hey in the name of Jesus I command all demons away
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:05.920]  for me and just see what happens do the kind of reaction to get actually I've seen that
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:11.040]  done they go completely ape all right I appreciate your call God bless you great points Carlos
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:16.560]  in Canada thanks for holding her on the air thank you very much Alex congratulations
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:23.200]  on your efforts they're really coming about well there are all of us everybody this audience
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:27.640]  is the tip of the spear you get the credit I know but I'm honored to speak to you because
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:33.400]  you know you have the wisdom of having followed for many years the events that are now coming
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:39.600]  to fruition listen Alex MK ultra if they teach us anything I was there at McGill 14 years
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:45.200]  after the events of the MK ultra studies that were done there and I can tell you something
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:52.360]  it was a failure it was a failure complete in fact many of those well Dr. Baggins talks
[01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:56.720]  about that what they found scared them in their mind control studies about how powerful
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:04.200]  we are correct and they couldn't control with fluids liquids how people have free will they
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:10.640]  try to do this the MK ultra is a lesson that we should keep in mind because when you hear
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:16.600]  you don't know a harari influencing great powerful masters of the university want to
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:22.840]  call them the super class these people are leaders of corporations but when they listen
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:29.640]  to people like you all know about harari who are guided by a philosophy well known to philosophers
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:36.080]  and that is that scientism is one aspect of it but really is solipsism I'll explain the
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:42.200]  idea that you in your brain have all the knowledge you'll ever have therefore all that you know
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:48.160]  and everything that you do is you and therefore everything is a scenario in which you appear
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:54.240]  to be the god to be the controller these individuals of course then create technology and they
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:58.960]  believe that that technology has all the answers to the universe that you don't need god these
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:04.640]  are godless people and when they try to apply their will their free will because we have
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:10.240]  free will they have free will but we have free will on the belief that God himself the universe
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:15.960]  has given us the choice between good and bad good and evil they have the understanding
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:21.680]  they have to control because that is their power and I believe that they will be running
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:26.960]  really because their actions are now killing human beings and math they will not be concentrating
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:33.200]  very happily in Davos next year or the year after some of these prominent people avoiding
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:38.840]  it because they will be facing bailiffs coming with international court orders oh that's
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:43.640]  right criminal investigations everywhere Nuremberg 2.0 they finally made the plunge with an open
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:47.920]  bio attack and it's blown up in their face and they're figuring that out now it's not
[01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:51.360]  going the way they thought it would Carlos thank you Jordan in New Jersey you're on the
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:54:00.240]  air I thank you Alex for taking my call Jordan here from colonize.com I just want to clarify
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:06.960]  your DMT comments I think there's two types of people the people that see infinite perfection
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:11.120]  and light and like basically a version of heaven and then there's the people that are
[01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:14.640]  visited by lizards and these other you know clockwork elves or whatever you want to call
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:19.200]  them so some people say it's a litmus test what kind of person you are you know whether
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:25.280]  you're evil or good just clarify that point and I've taken DMT and I I saw the lights
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:29.200]  and the crystal you know this beautiful thing right so I just want to get that out there
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:34.040]  well let me just get this out there I don't need to take DMT so I have the dreams every
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:39.920]  night and so I don't my brain produces a lot of it that's a fourth wave region right so
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:44.040]  but let me just say this they've had to accelerate their planes because of your exposure and the
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:49.680]  MAGA movement which there's all question as to whether Q okay is a part of what Trump
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:53.520]  did and all the rest of it but they had to accelerate now here's the thing that we should
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:57.360]  remember is their biggest weakness and I want to echo the comments of Carlos the first call
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:03.320]  it okay he said that technology and their their hubris and belief in this technology
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:07.560]  is kind of their undoing and so forth in the sense that they think they can be gods and
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:13.080]  what have you that technology that hubris that belief in that they went too far with
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:16.760]  it and that's the weakness where you're talking about the raw the bio attack and their control
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:22.400]  over social media that's their biggest weakness and we need to find ways to to to to echo
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:26.520]  that and to make sure that that weakness is hit at every point that's right they're relying
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:30.200]  on their globalist technology too much great point Jordan thank you Brittany and Rhode
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:37.600]  Island you're up next go ahead hey Alex great to talk to you big fan we're fighting them
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:46.080]  to the nail right now because these conversations are so crucial they are literally just taking
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:52.600]  mass psychosis and spreading it across the world they're creating this mass hysteria
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:56:02.400]  and it's literally it's it's funneling people into a manipulation and then it's also kind
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:11.360]  of it's confusing everybody turning them into you know against each other I agree that's
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:15.800]  they're trying to divide and conquer and then hoping they don't get the blame but if they
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:21.240]  get the blame it blows up in their face you understand right exactly so like like you
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:29.320]  said right now is super important because they know that we are like right at their door
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:36.360]  and they're scared and they are just trying to they're trying to confuse people and also
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:42.800]  break people apart so they can tell them to this is the only way to not give that free
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:50.600]  will that we're all in doubt they want us to just lay down and die and this whole community
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:57.840]  at info wars really breaks it down for everybody I read your book and you know this this information
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:02.920]  needs to get out the whole world well it is thanks to you the power of the listeners is
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:06.560]  everything when you decide to share the articles and videos when you decide to share on your
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:09.600]  email and text messages word of mouth and explainable hey you're not supposed to see
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:13.640]  this here it is and tell them to share it until those that share it it creates again
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:17.920]  that chain reaction thank you so much pretty for getting the book thank you for your support

[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:41.760]  back at you alex very sincerely i've been talking to you say and listening to you since
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:53.240]  1999 and the reason why i got in connection with you was that my father was in the bohemian
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:59.000]  grove or in the bohemian club where they met in the bohemian grove and i started doing
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:05.120]  research in the 90s after i had gotten my graduate degree from george washington university
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:14.400]  in washington dc and i thought i i need to find out who my father was and lo and behold
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:19.760]  there was only one person who had done any research and that was you so the reason why
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:24.480]  i called today and i hope that you know i can talk to your staff sometimes so we can
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:30.800]  go in more depth and to who i am so that we might be able to do a longer interview but
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:37.280]  but the reason why i called today was because of my father and who he was and what he tried
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:45.480]  to get me into what i've experienced is these davos people and you know whoever they've
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:55.360]  been whatever cover they've used throughout the the last 30 40 50 years um the movie the
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:02:04.280]  matrix and that series did such a good job of depicting how the real threats to us the
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:13.000]  agents they move in and out of these compliant bodies um like it was nothing and those are
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:19.520]  the when the agents get into those bodies that's who we're really fighting and and it's
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:25.200]  just exactly like that now well that's it they remove them from god it's all like the
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:31.480]  movie avatar so they can be operatives of this outside force exactly because we're transceivers
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:36.240]  and so you go to a pep rally you feel the energy or rock concert or church we're interfacing
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:41.520]  with that and then they train people to be controllable that that's that and that's it
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:49.120]  and then they go under a program exactly and that's a perfect description for it the unauthorized
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:55.880]  uh biography of herbert uh george herbert walker bush by tarply and i can't remember
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:03:03.440]  the other guy um that's still online and everybody needs to read that because it goes into great
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:07.440]  description of what i'm gonna do david i'm gonna get your name and number and if your
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:11.560]  dad had some annals or bohemian grove you can prove he was in it i would love to have you
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:14.680]  on as a guest and i think you sound credible so we'll get your name and number and i'll
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:17.640]  give you to our producers i love you i appreciate you i gotta get to another caller i promise
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:24.480]  to black rant from south carolina you're on here hello alex thank you for having me
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:30.320]  on i just wanted to say doesn't it feel so good to be washed in the blood of christ doesn't
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:36.000]  it feel so good to have the protection of christ whereas these people are walking totally
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:43.360]  naked in the realm of satan i want to make a suggestion and uh it's not you can do it
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:48.080]  or you cannot do it you probably might have to check with yay but um yay made a song about
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:53.040]  two years ago called wash us in the blood it's just beautiful and that's how i feel today
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:57.200]  and i feel like the next coming of christ is not just going to be one person but it's
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:03.360]  going to be a consciousness that comes full with everyone who's awakened i called because
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:08.440]  i wanted to talk about how davos is like the mafia how these elites are like the mafia
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:14.040]  and we know the mafia was interlinked interlocked with the government yay called it out with
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:22.520]  the the jewish mafia it exists the the italian mafia but with this jab with the shot deadly
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:27.760]  poison shot they are engaged in pharmaceutical racketeering where now they're coming out
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:33.320]  with these new shots and these new technologies that'll help your heart now that they've actually

[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:15.080]  support lines of the information war it's alex jones they realize that the the shots
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:21.960]  were causing the explosion of chronic disease asthma neuroimmune diseases like psychosis
[02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:29.840]  adhd autism cancer cancer cancer autoimmune diseases so they realized in 2011 they caused
[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:37.040]  it all so or in 2009 and when our paper came out they realized that these were the the shots
[02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:43.520]  were associated strongly very strongly the chance of them not being associated it was
[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:49.440]  like being struck by lightning one in at least a million in a p-value and so they covered
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:57.880]  this all up because of course they were liable now because for the 42 million americans who
[02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:07.680]  are asymptomatic carriers of hiv and SARS-CoV-2 and other x mrv's other manufactured mouse
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:14.800]  monkey and human viruses the game was premeditated murder of the 42 million people you're liable
[02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:21.560]  for their injury premeditated murder if you give somebody who already has an antibody
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:27.640]  a shot you will get antibody dependent enhance so they were getting rid of the people they'd
[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:31.360]  already poisoned knowing the giving them a second or third or fourth dose would kill
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:40.640]  them wow correct kill us cremate us add a mask add a mask and isolation and you'll blame
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:48.040]  the people for COPD or any of the other co diseases you never inject an hiv positive
[02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:56.360]  person with any vaccine we never did never until now you do not drive the disease causing
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:08:01.920]  entity through why do we know that all over the world they the people that have had the
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:07.400]  COPD vaccine are testing positive for hiv that because the spike proteins from hiv it
[02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:15.240]  has gp120 glycoprotein 120 absolutely it also has the monkey mouse and manufactured as x
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:22.840]  mrv so the spike protein is is killing you know literally the 12% so you're saying it's
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:31.240]  a binary weapon where they already are preloaded with it and this triggers the next phase correct
[02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:40.440]  and the more vaccines you got especially Gardasil because that has the toxic synthetic lipid nanoparticles
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:46.120]  similar to the one in the COVID shot prior to the COVID shot the deadliest vaccine we
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:52.400]  saw athletes dropping dead on the field passing out falling down all the things that particularly
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:09:00.720]  the athletes because they operate at oxygen max capacity max they're they're operating
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:07.400]  at such a high level in their mitochondria this is an energy production oxygen necessary
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:12.720]  disease so they create that's what they're finding they turbo charge the blood clots
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:20.440]  correct wow and it's scheme a lack of oxygen so constricted blood vessels to because athletes
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:25.320]  are running they're constricted they're they're working so that the blood flows and it doesn't
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:31.080]  flow which is why your nitric oxide product that new products I hope you'll show it because
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:37.280]  that's a very important thing to have for acute events be it does all under the tongue give
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:42.600]  you an instant relaxing of your endothelium your vasculature you looked at our nitric
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:46.240]  oxide I saw it was the top rated the latest private label it's the best seller you've
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:51.000]  looked at our formula you like it I did and I do yes I'm not a scientist like you what
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:56.040]  is what are these compounds do creating nitric oxide what does it do it relaxes the vasculature
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:01.760]  so the clot will go through and not restrict it allows it to relax it lowers the blood
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:27.320]  pressure well Ivan Raiklin is in the studio with us a very interesting guy former green
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:32.360]  moray lawyer works in the sense intelligence agency and was all over trying to stop the
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:38.320]  stolen election in 2000 and he definitely knows where all the bodies are buried 20 what
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:48.120]  2020 in 2020 absolutely what what year does it 2000 oh yeah yeah 2020 in all blurs in
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:54.000]  all blurs together so so there's a bunch of big topics to get here to to lay out but watching
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.920]  them use psyops and watching them use tools that they don't even use overseas because
[02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:03.360]  they're so dangerous against the American people how would you as a former defense intelligence
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:07.880]  agency guy and a lawyer that you work with Trump and so much that's been investigated
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:13.040]  attacked by the deep state who saw the 2020 election theft the last election theft three
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:17.440]  months ago how would you describe the state of the world right now and these admissions
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:20.880]  which I don't just call it the admissions I know it's true the whole globalist agendas
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:26.360]  in trouble they have 95% negative comments everywhere even on their own sites against
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:31.600]  them they're in full panic mode at the whole globalist new world order level what do you
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:36.680]  make of the position and the time we're in right now as a culture as a humanity on this
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:41.480]  planet as Americans what what's your briefing the American people I know people won't agree
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:44.840]  with me on this but they're on the ropes and the reason why they're on the ropes is because
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:50.080]  check this out they try to do absolute everything censor us on LinkedIn Facebook Twitter all
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:54.880]  the different social media platform they own 90 plus percent of the media and then they
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:59.360]  deplatformed unplatformed everybody amidst all of that and the weaponization of the
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:07.160]  FBI DOJ DHS DOD even I'll talk about that hopefully they used all stops and then they
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:11.320]  still couldn't stop us and now we're pushing back and we have these new committees we won
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:16.000]  the house even though it was a pink trickle that was managed between Nancy Pelosi I argue
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:21.760]  between Nancy and Kevin McCarthy but bottom line amidst all of the lawlessness that they
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:27.600]  committed Alex Jones info wars and some of the other patriots out there broke through
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:32.240]  all of that and people gravitate to the truth and that's why I like that's why I'm here
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:38.880]  I barely got here Alex because guess what when I fly on TS on the on the airlines TSA does
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:45.120]  what's called a fourth amendment rape on me every single time I travel and why is that
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:49.520]  DHS my orcas needs to be impeached for that hopefully we're going to get to Marjorie Taylor
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:53.880]  Green to get her another article of impeachment against my orcas but bottom line they slowed
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:58.120]  me down I almost missed my flight to get down here to be on this on this episode massive
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:01.760]  harassment because they're scared of you so from your training your history around the
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:06.240]  world watching this done to America I totally agree with you we're not up here trying to
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:11.000]  sugarcoat this but people you know the whole new adult agenda scared they're in trouble
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:15.320]  so you define the fact that they're on the ropes I agree with you but what comes out
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:20.040]  of that and how do we now press the attack also just like in war when you got the enemy
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:25.560]  on the ropes you have to push push push continue to push so luckily we have these new committees
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:29.480]  that were just established in terms of foreign push we're going to have to beef up the CCP
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:33.320]  committee that's headed up by Mike Gallagher congressman Gallagher I don't know how much
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:38.320]  jurisdiction and capability he's going to have but I think we need to highlight and demand
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:44.200]  that he I want at the end of this whole CCP committee in the next few weeks even there
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:47.960]  needs to be a declaration of war on the check I was about to say I was a bit you read my
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:52.280]  mind we're at war with China we need the deck absolutely we need it's asymmetrical
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:56.600]  it's a fifth generation explain that absolutely what they did over the last three out what
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:00.560]  I love is we're synced up this is going to set full stop I'm probably more aggressive
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:06.440]  than you Alex seriously so check this out CCP committee needs to go ahead and showcase
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:13.080]  for the whole tell Congress what they did from the CCP 19 by a weapon that was released
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:17.040]  by the way the minority viewpoint of the director of national intelligence assessment about
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:22.240]  the origins of covid the Wuhan flu the kung flu whatever you want to call it the minority
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:26.200]  view talked about how it was from a lab leak and potentially I think there was one or two
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:31.880]  analysts that mentioned that it could possibly be an intentional lab release well guess what
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:37.440]  that hypothesis is more and more prevalent in the conversations so we need to go after
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:42.960]  the CCP for releasing that by a weapon right and then we need to basically take a look
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:47.600]  at what are they doing within our institutions within those three that I talked about DoD
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:54.680]  DoJ where was the what was the first institution that mandated the EUA clotshots unit Department
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:15:01.080]  of Defense so if you're China and you're trying to destroy the United States the most trusted
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:06.160]  and capable and funded institution within our entire system is the DoD and China won't
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:10.280]  take the shots but through their media they supported the Defense Department doing that
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:16.200]  which again shows it's a globalist interloper pro CCP block that controls Biden and Hunter
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:20.200]  and now we're about to take them out these members of Congress needs to wake up a lot
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:23.920]  of these folks that are on the right they have an R by their name let's face it they all
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:28.480]  probably accepted the you know the bodily mutilation through the injection right and
[02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:32.800]  unfortunately they did that because they they were duped by your phone uses of the world
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:37.280]  by all the media but we need to now educate them and say you know what you were duped
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:40.560]  you need to now stay right there because folks we'll go a little bit the next hour this
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:44.360]  is very important I'll explain something it's separation of powers and not just the three
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:48.160]  branches government the federal state government there's different separations of the power
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:52.800]  elites and there's a real shift now to actually stop China and that's why their operatives

[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:09.160]  actually winning the info war and when you realize that Band-Aut video has hundreds and
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:15.200]  hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists to talk show host whose information
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:20.800]  is beyond incredible hundreds of medical doctors and scientists all of them right now telling
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:25.720]  the truth at Band-Aut video millions of people today visiting Band-Aut video but you can

[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:46.880]  to take action we as a species and as a race are invincible so I thank you all for your
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:51.920]  past action and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now because humanity and the
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:20:03.960]  children are counting on leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:23.200]  it's Alex Jones so the world is at a major reshuffling point a lot of deals were made
[02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:27.040]  with China to sell the US worker out trillions of dollars were made by middlemen special
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:32.640]  under the trump exposed and we exposed but now folks understand that the democratic party
[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:38.480]  particularly is a subsidiary of the chai comps we're playing a very sophisticated triple
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:43.480]  game where they make it all about Russia and then act like China's ally with Russia but
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:48.520]  they've always been at loggerheads and give you back the whole history of that there's
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:54.240]  always been back channels going on but Ivan Reiklin former defense intelligence agency
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:59.040]  analyst lawyer green beret you've been around the world you've seen this you've had a great
[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:02.600]  analysis what's happening got a bunch of issues you want to hit but I don't think people can
[02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:10.240]  under analyze or underestimate the fact that you can look at the weather vane and see that
[02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:15.560]  even the elites that are in America aren't consolidated and things are shifting towards
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:18.960]  why are we going to cut the power off why are we going to collapse and let China have
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:22.520]  all the energy and so there's a shift away from China for real it's not going to be
[02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:27.760]  the Chinese century they are going to collapse in the next 10 years and there can be actually
[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:32.000]  a revolution there we can free China but we are at war with China with cyber attacks
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:36.360]  and fentanyl and I was about to say we're at war with China when you said Congress needs
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:41.720]  to say we're at war with China I don't want war with China we're at war with China so
[02:21:41.720 --> 02:21:45.640]  elaborate on that yes so for those people that still think that this show is tinfoil
[02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:50.880]  had it here's where I'm going to stop that nonsense for as it relates to China 193 countries
[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:55.480]  out there five are on the UN permanent security council China's one of them the United States
[02:21:55.480 --> 02:22:00.240]  the other one right so we if you look at the elements of national power of all these 193
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:05.000]  countries it comes down to two world powers right now China and the United States so what
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:09.840]  did China just do without firing a single normal shot if you will obviously clock shots
[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:14.360]  they did they basically took over all of our institutions over the last several years and
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:18.760]  the Pentagon followed what was good for them treason right and the reason why they were
[02:22:18.760 --> 02:22:23.440]  able to do that is because their brand and their ambassador to the United States is currently
[02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:28.320]  sitting in our White House and defiling it and his name is pronounced Joseph Robin at
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:35.040]  Jiden along with his hundred we've seen this Joseph Biden right his son's laptop everything
[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:39.240]  shows all the financial transactions he says I work for the head of Chinese intelligence
[02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:45.800]  absolutely where where is Congress where okay we have a January 3rd is when we had our 118
[02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:50.240]  Congress swearing in Kevin McCarthy was has been a speaker now for 10 days what's going
[02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:56.400]  on done absolutely nothing Alex we need to be declaring war on China exposing all this
[02:22:56.400 --> 02:23:00.040]  they're still deliberating on who's going to be on committees meanwhile they're eating
[02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:05.040]  our lunch breakfast and dinner because they've captured our is are you think Lloyd Austin
[02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:10.720]  even knows what he's part of it has to be complicity at this point it has to be and
[02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:14.680]  then I think it in some components at the global scale that we just talked about there's that
[02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:18.800]  component well they argue it's a back channel and we're surveilling them but we're not surveilling
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:25.520]  them if they're running us exactly it's it's a it's a dual sort of loyalty of the executive
[02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:32.160]  branch leadership is loyal to the Chinese Communist Party and to Big Pharma and I remember about
[02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:38.400]  two years ago the deputy of the CCP came out after pronouncing the name he said we've talked
[02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:42.160]  to the wise men that run America and don't worry we're going to get rid of Trump and
[02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:49.160]  then I saw Munger and what's his name but the Berkshire Hathaway you've found her an
[02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:53.920]  owner sitting there saying yeah we met with the Chinese don't worry we're going to do
[02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:58.560]  all this I mean it's a bunch of old elitists that sold us out to China who just think we're
[02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:02.160]  going to go along with this and it's it's it's it's Warren Buffett war not going to
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:08.640]  happen I was thinking Lincoln Nebraska than the war so how do you because if things are
[02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:14.320]  swinging towards picking the Chinese out the Chinese Communist what how are they gonna respond
[02:24:14.320 --> 02:24:17.880]  so this is I think the way that you do it is essentially Congress you know other than
[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:22.720]  declaring war you also have to put a resolution that a joint resolution let's be clear it's
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:26.800]  like Trump said with with with the new world order and all this we're already at war with
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:30.800]  the globalist so we're not gonna go bomb them we're just saying we're at war it's being honest
[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:35.200]  we're at war and now we're going to do the following things economically oh the trade
[02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:40.440]  deficit with China that no longer exists and actually we flip it China now owes the world
[02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:46.120]  a hundred billion dollars right or even actually excuse me a hundred trillion dollars based
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:51.120]  on what they just decimated the entire world's economy here's the problem Alex we have in
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:56.840]  order for big business big pharma big sports leagues big tech big media to be able to access
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:01.240]  the Chinese Communist Party's market of one point four plus billion people they have to
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:06.720]  play by China's rules and that's the negotiation going on at the big picture level globally
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:12.920]  so if you're at Mark Zuckerberg Sergey Brin you know name the CEO hey you want access
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:17.120]  and sell your product hey NBA you want to sell your merch to China well you have to do
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:20.800]  the following you have to destroy your country from within make sure that your people are
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:24.600]  kneeling before you know when the flag is coming out at the beginning of well yeah remember
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:29.600]  remember you four years ago it came out in Reuters that China gets all the code keys
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:35.880]  to Google and to Apple and to be there they have to do and they said to our devices China
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:38.800]  has been given access to everything.
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:43.440]  Yuri Besmanoff is the best reference that I have to mention here everybody needs to
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:48.840]  understand and take a look at in 1982 I believe it was a video came out of a KGB defector
[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:54.480]  that explained how the KGB ran operations in the United States and in the West to destroy
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:26:00.160]  a country using ideological subversion and that is exactly what China is now doing at
[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:05.560]  a level a hundred to a thousand X what Yuri Besmanoff talked about that the Soviet Union
[02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:10.720]  was doing to us in the sixties and beyond and they're taking that model taking what
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:15.320]  the lessons learned from China from Russia and now applying it to the West and that's
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:16.320]  what we're saying.
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:21.200]  So China is now blackmailing the Democrats I don't have to pay them anymore how do we
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:23.920]  extricate ourselves from this?
[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:29.800]  So we extricate ourselves but by I mean it's a difficult task we have to decouple our industries
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:31.920]  from China that's for one.
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:34.240]  But that's happening with the chips and everything.
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:37.320]  Every single industry unfortunately.
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:42.600]  But that's good news why do you think the U.S. elites are finally saying okay we can't
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:43.600]  do it with China?
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:45.920]  Is China trying to be the boss?
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:49.640]  I mean China I would argue that in January 6th of 2021 essentially became the world's
[02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:53.280]  superpower placating us and three of the four elements of national power and then when
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:57.680]  they implemented the clot shot now that our national security I mean people like myself
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:03.000]  and others that are absolute war alpha warriors are leaving the military in droves because
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:08.520]  they don't want anything to do with this woke ism this the clot shot mandate nothing and
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:09.520]  so.
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:12.120]  Which was a direct plan to take the military.
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:13.120]  Yeah.
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:14.120]  It has to be.
[02:27:14.120 --> 02:27:16.880]  So how do we counter that explanation for it.
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:20.700]  But as you said they're more and more on the road so where's the split I think the way
[02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:24.400]  we have to win this is in the information landscape.
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:30.040]  We have to educate those that are the rhino the rhino lights that this is going on and
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:34.480]  I think we're winning in that and then we start to move to say hey this is not a left
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:37.360]  and right thing this is a survival of a nation.
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:40.680]  If you want to be a lot of people are coming to our side when they say when they see the
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:45.840]  censorship finally the Twitter files releases when people see that that are a left of center
[02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:49.080]  they're starting to come over to talk about that next segment who you think Elon Musk
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:54.680]  is we showed a graphic two days ago the cruise rated finding stuff really quick but it showed
[02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:59.720]  energy cutoffs in Europe and the U.S. last three years two years and China with carbon
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:00.720]  is going straight up.
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:05.040]  I mean that's a strategic issue if we don't have energy we can't compete I mean that to
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:11.600]  me that's that's issue one is in this quite quote green garbage it's all made up and turn
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:13.280]  the energy spick it on.
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:15.720]  I mean we have exactly we just have to open things up.
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:19.600]  It's how you fill inflation it's how you natural resources all throughout the United States
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:24.000]  we have plenty to go around we've been exporting for how many years but then it's shut down
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.560]  because guess what Jiden is doing China's bidding over there in the White House.
[02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:32.960]  We have to extricate him and I think there's a mechanism of Biden is Jiden I pronounce
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:37.280]  a Jiden it should be I mean he's basically earned the title of Chinese Communist Party
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:39.120]  ambassador to the United States.
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:44.720]  Every single policy is promulgated from day one is in support of China and totally against
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:45.720]  the U.S.
[02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:50.720]  All right let's get into the censorship in Nuremberg 2.0 straight ahead with Ivan Raiklin

[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:30.840]  from austin texas you're listening to the alex jones show well former defense intelligence
[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:37.080]  agency analyst and lawyer and green beret and patriot i've been rakeland is our guest
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:47.680]  and I cannot quantify for listeners how real what he's saying is it's so real and the globalists
[02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:51.280]  have almost gotten this country where they want it but now a lot of people in government
[02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:55.040]  corporations and academia are going whoa this is really bad so there's kind of a come to
[02:33:55.040 --> 02:33:59.240]  jesus moment right now before we really become slaves and the globalists are being exposed
[02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:04.440]  their agenda is in trouble but they're still in power so continuing I'm going to just give
[02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:10.240]  you the floor here and talk about nuremberg 2.0 ccp pharma fouchy pence big tech the
[02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:14.520]  censorship all of it vindicating what we've said and then what is congress going to do
[02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:18.520]  about that with the government weaponized against the people I got you mentioned pence
[02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:22.920]  I got to talk about pence real quick and how he fits in this entire scheme of things a lot
[02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:26.800]  of people don't look at mike pence and all roads lead to mike pence as it relates to
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:31.440]  all the during the first term during president trump all the friction and everything he was
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:35.160]  not getting rid of flinn it was specifically because of pence the very first thing that
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:40.600]  he did was getting rid of flinn right in order for flinn not to expose what was going on
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:48.600]  with the crossfire hurricane the illegal spying remember alex 2001 to 2013 robert moeller
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:54.000]  was the director of the fbi first eight years it was george bush and cheney as vice president
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:35:00.880]  during that time it was newly minted congressman from indiana mike pence 2001 he swore in ten
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:05.960]  of those 12 years he's on house judiciary providing oversight with his staff of the fbi
[02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:11.440]  and doj meanwhile they're developing relationships that he then reignites to be able to provide
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:16.760]  the top cover necessary for james comey to do the whole crossfire hurricane that's literally
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:21.520]  what happened and since then he's been providing the cover up after cover up after cover up
[02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:26.960]  and then then he becomes the ccp-19 task force lead and then provides and doles out all the
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:33.200]  contracts along with jared kushner to the governors of new hampshire uh sunu sununu
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:39.760]  of georgia camp of arizona uh what's his name ducey and then you got ohio dewine all these
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:44.920]  republican governors did the shutdowns as well and that's because it was at the advice
[02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:49.320]  and essentially facilitation of mike pence and i argue that it was it was all done in
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:54.200]  order to eject president trump and then they had pence led the covid response right exactly
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:58.680]  and then pence would get the presidency in 2024 which they promised him probably that's
[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:03.880]  it he's involved in the whole operation and has he been investigated have they asked him
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:10.320]  a question has even hassled has even fox news uh question him no because paul ryan is providing
[02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:15.040]  top cover for he's untouchable he's totally protected totally protected well he's not
[02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:19.600]  protected for me i'm the guy that basically is dedicated last two years plus actually
[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:24.360]  seven years to research and investigate him and that's why i suspect that dhs he may have
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:28.120]  been the one that put me on the dhs little secondary screening list because i've been
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:33.400]  totally exposing him not only because of that going back to 2016 but also exposing him for
[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:39.120]  his not allowing for a quorum on january 6 when they gaveled in to have the joint session
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:43.360]  remember they only allowed 11 members of democrats and republicans in the house as well as the
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:48.360]  senate to be on the house for to come conduct the joint session so let's be over argue that
[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:52.640]  we need to have a redo of the joint session with the new house and then we got 28 states
[02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:56.920]  that are republican 22 that are democrat and we can have a contingent election like that
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:02.440]  on friday and then reinstate trump let's go well let's be forward looking here knowing
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:08.240]  what the global syrup to and i agree with you but but but they are they are telegraphing
[02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:11.600]  that cyber attacks are imminent i mean how are they going to get themselves out of the
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:16.880]  pickle they're in well they're doing it they're trying to have this meeting in davos they're
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:20.200]  trying to figure out a strategy in order to be able to push back they're trying to crush
[02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:25.880]  you you think that the people behind the lawsuits that have been against you are just locals
[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:29.680]  that are angry at oh no they admit it's all a big democrat pr for a big play i mean you're
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:34.200]  big here i mean you're global everybody listens to this show and they know that and they have
[02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:39.160]  to crush people that are going you're the original deep state marauder by the way alex
[02:37:39.160 --> 02:37:44.560]  i love that about you and so what's deep state marauder mean marauder means somebody it's
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:50.080]  a pirate that goes in and pillages right so deep state marauder by extension means an
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:55.240]  individual that goes into the deep state and shines the light and absolutely obliterates
[02:37:55.240 --> 02:37:59.520]  them through exposure you've been doing that for decades i'm just jumping into the game
[02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:03.640]  now that i retired so i'm happy to row in the same direction well no but i can tell
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:09.160]  you i don't want to underestimate it but the numbers show it and i use the examples of
[02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:12.960]  like you go to a video with five million views and there's like three hundred thousand comments
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:17.280]  and all of them are against the new world order everybody gets it they've lost those aren't
[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:21.720]  chatbots those aren't those are real comments yeah so they're the ones that are creating
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:24.680]  these and they admit it there but so why would they go to their meeting and admit they're
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:28.520]  in trouble and say they've got a sense for instance shut us down they said specifically
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:32.680]  they're losing and then they are they're hitting the panic button so what does that mean why
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:36.280]  would they even admit they're losing they're not even that sophisticated they had so much
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:41.280]  power so long they thought they could win it because they they had the fbi with chris
[02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:46.160]  ray over there right and davos in order to be able to use their platform to censor censor
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:51.480]  twitter and facebook etc linkedin i was censored on all three of those as well bottom line
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:58.080]  is that because they censored so hard so fast there was the creation of getter truth of
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:03.120]  telegram rumble rumble all these different plot platforms that came out and a lot of
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:08.040]  people are congregating on those and expressing their first amendment and they have to counter
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:13.200]  that somehow if they were smart they'd back off but they just can't help it i'm really
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:16.520]  worried what's going to happen they're going to back off by us escalating and they're good
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:20.520]  they're going to continue to back off that is the only way we do it we have to how do
[02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:26.480]  we escalate escalate we can everybody needs to create truthful content we need to match
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:30.160]  all the content that's being pushed you're talking about you're talking about force multiplication
[02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:35.560]  explain that we absolutely have to so let's take a look yeah rumbles on the uptick the
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:39.360]  truth and getter and all these other ones are on the uptick we have to match the number
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:46.400]  of compelling content that is out there and in order to match google youtube twitter facebook
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:51.240]  all of them once we do that and then there's more compelling content on our platforms then
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:55.760]  people are going to naturally move off of those scumbag commie and it's happening i'm
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:40:00.480]  seeing rumble ads that's how we gain momentum i'm seeing rumble ads on fox news and the
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:07.000]  nfl really no i don't watch the nfl anymore i monitor it and the point is it's it's it's
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:10.600]  exploding i know a bunch of rumble talk show hosts that millions of viewers today now from
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:14.880]  nowhere no so i'm i'm launching my my show i mean i'm not just talking for everybody
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:18.240]  else to do it i'm launching my show i'm doing a daily 30 minute and i would explain to the
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:23.240]  average listener that maybe starts a youtube or a getter or i say be on the enemy platforms
[02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:28.040]  and your own and push things to the other one if you have a hundred viewers that's an amazing
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:31.840]  event the elite says they're right don't don't think like oh jones is getting hundreds of
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:36.520]  millions of years or joe rogan is so i'm not going to know no no no it's all of you the
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:41.200]  millions of you reaching thousands of peasick one niche just like the all these channels
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:45.000]  on the other commie platforms they're like oh we're going to do an unboxing well guess
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:49.000]  what a lot of that stuff doesn't exist on rumble why don't you create compelling content that's
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:52.960]  already out there that cover boxing and then slip stuff in and then slip stuff in that's
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:57.800]  conserving and the a i won't even see it and guess what no i'm talking about on on rumble
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:01.160]  no no no but i mean i don't know but i agree but do it on youtube too because i'm telling
[02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:06.880]  them they don't see it you can beat a i by like my arguments more pure i disagree a lot
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:10.680]  of people use the argument that you still have to be on those platforms i'm taking the more
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:16.080]  purest angle that if you create content only on one platform that it doesn't exist elsewhere
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:20.640]  it forces people to come to your platform with more content just like here you're not on
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:24.960]  any platform alex everybody still comes here because they know the the brand that they're
[02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:28.200]  going to be getting but that's because we were already there i'm not disagreeing with
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:32.040]  you but what i'm saying is it's like joe rogan does on youtube he puts little clips out there
[02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:36.320]  but pushes them to spotify what i'm saying is those are ambassadors to the main thing
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:41.280]  i agree the main thing is one place but you have ambassadors to okay yeah i just to support
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:45.440]  the original platform yeah army platform and get them off some of my episodes that i mean
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:51.320]  the enemy doesn't want us on those for a reason right because they i say we take their territory
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:55.320]  it'd be nice i mean we know where they're located and so you know what i mean we we
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:42:00.200]  take it when we they're not even that sophisticated like i consider it's at mobs for five minutes
[02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:04.240]  i think i'm a plan of something i'm gonna say that's gonna bake them that then takes
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:07.680]  them to one of and it's so either easy to beat actually people don't try it anything that
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:10.600]  comes out on your mouth it literally trends on twitter you never you haven't been on twitter
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:17.480]  for years much they watch you that's how many listeners you have you're telling me to continue
[02:42:17.480 --> 02:42:22.600]  to look at the camera so i gotta do it fellas and ladies out there bottom line is this is
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:28.840]  how we win this war number one strategy is to information dissemination of the truth
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:33.840]  just bombard them they cancel you they they censor you it doesn't matter we have platforms
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:38.440]  now that's the key china and places never had freedom they need to have this skeleton
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:44.040]  we still have the skeleton have an infrastructure it's massive it's growing by the day absolutely
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:49.560]  we are winning and i don't just say that to pump you up folks we are winning the enemy

[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:14.160]  had been greatly exaggerated because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die
[02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:20.560]  and it's the same psi op today info wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because

[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:36.480]  you stop spreading the word then they do win ladies and gentlemen there's only one group of people
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:40.800]  that could shut down info wars and that's you the viewers and listeners if you decide we're done

[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:25.840]  deep state on notice we're coming for you all right i was going to keep ivan with us a little
[02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:29.520]  bit the next hour but i forgot i'm on drew her name is a show with charlie kirk coming up

[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:38.800]  today with so much more critical information we got 10 minutes 11 minutes left in this segment
[02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:43.920]  you got a lot to say so just take over all right here's the deal we got to focus on the future we
[02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:49.040]  have a house that is friendly to getting after the deep state you saw the clip by congressman dan
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:53.840]  bishop he's going to be on the committee known as the church 2.0 committee i call it the deep
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:59.200]  state body check committee it's going to be the a subcommittee within the judiciary committee
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:04.480]  which uh jim jordan is going to be heading both of them and i before i came in here a couple hours
[02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:08.320]  ago i got a phone call from let's just say one of the members of the judiciary committee one of the
[02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:13.840]  staff and they reached out and said hey so-and-so congressman asked me to reach out so that uh
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:18.720]  you can share with us all the research you've done ivan for the last seven years as it applies to
[02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:23.360]  all the entities that we're going to need to go after and i said i would gladly uh participate
[02:48:23.360 --> 02:48:27.920]  in that so here's kind of where we're if you want to follow along in this journey and help out with
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:34.480]  it i'm going to be articulating over the next few days in my sub stack exactly what i recommend to
[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:40.720]  the judiciary to the arm services committee to the subcommittee to the ccp committee to the
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:45.440]  veterans affairs committee even all of these committees what they need to be doing in order
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:51.920]  to do the massively law-offensive the the maximum thing that they can do to crush the commies
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:57.840]  within the executive branch by name number transgression date time everything we're going
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:02.720]  to go after the likes of eric cherimel the whistleblower we're going to go after the likes of
[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:07.840]  we're going to go after the likes of uh jo pientka the third who is still running out there
[02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:14.480]  somewhere as an fbi senior a supervisory special agent that may be still in san francisco advising
[02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:21.040]  elvis chan to go ahead and censor alex myself etc we're going to go after every single one of
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:25.120]  these people because big tech can censor but they can't work with the government to censor
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:29.120]  that's illegal right they can censor on their own but when the government tells them to do it
[02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:34.800]  they can't do that earlier today when i was uh at the uh i've had clear and precheck traveling
[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:41.040]  since it was created years ago and i told the the clear lady and i said guess what well uh
[02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:46.160]  you can basically you know stop me from going through the clear system once the tsa down the
[02:49:46.160 --> 02:49:51.680]  road here is telling you that you can't clear me now you become complicit and essentially allowing
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:56.320]  for a violation of the federal government right so they can do it on their own as private as a
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:50:00.560]  private entity but once the government gets involved particularly the uh federal government
[02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:04.880]  that's an absolutely illegal uh activity and we talked about that so we're going to go after the
[02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:10.640]  tsa the dhs we're going to create articles of impeachment based off of that but not only i mean
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:15.440]  hearings are great and all it creates for great tv and fundraising for the campaigns of these
[02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:20.480]  congress members i could care less about that if they do what i'm going to recommend that they do
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:26.080]  they're going to fundraise like crazy but i want to get to criminal referrals not only obviously if
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:30.960]  you do criminal referrals back over to the doj they're going to do nothing with it alex but to
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:35.760]  the attorney generals we're going to go to the attorney attorneys general and i'm thinking that
[02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:40.400]  we need to identify the crimes committed by these scumbags and the states are already doing it the
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:45.760]  states are moving in cancels in texas here you got packs general paxton louis yam and louis
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:50.080]  florida exactly you know what i'm talking about cancels also we just got a brand new uh attorney
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:54.080]  general in cancels by the name of uh there's more than one way to skin a cat so just let's
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:57.920]  why we have a separation of powers absolutely absolutely so we're going to get after it not
[02:50:57.920 --> 02:51:02.240]  only there we're going to try to identify which counties uh some of these transgressions occurred
[02:51:02.240 --> 02:51:06.160]  and then we're going to go to that friendly constitutional sheriff that happens to be in
[02:51:06.160 --> 02:51:10.960]  that county and present all the evidence to them with the power and weight of the chairman of the
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:15.280]  judiciary committee and look what any other look what jim garrison did almost brought down the
[02:51:15.280 --> 02:51:21.840]  kennedy killing one district attorney yep i think we're going to have a thousand jim garrison's
[02:51:21.840 --> 02:51:26.560]  and here's the beauty of it with the truth being able to get out there as you're we're
[02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:32.080]  monitoring this in the court of public opinion we then get involved like congress is now open alex
[02:51:32.080 --> 02:51:37.280]  i am able to go and everybody else is able to go in there and essentially demand what they want
[02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:42.320]  their congress member and the staff to do there is no limitation everything's back open here's
[02:51:42.320 --> 02:51:46.880]  what needs to happen that hasn't happened yet kevin mccarthy if you don't in the next few days
[02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:51.840]  do the following then at matt gates and marjorie you need to vacate the chair and remove kevin
[02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:57.440]  mccarthy we still haven't gotten the 14 000 hours of tape of january 6th he did his whole little
[02:51:57.440 --> 02:52:03.280]  song and dance a couple days ago saying oh i'll consider maybe releasing the 14 000 hours i could
[02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:07.200]  care less about your consideration yeah what are they hiding at least some today released have been
[02:52:07.200 --> 02:52:12.720]  done all the very minute that you appointed him in the two years ago remember two two weeks ago
[02:52:12.720 --> 02:52:17.040]  when he appointed his sergeant at arms and it was like one or two in the morning that sergeant at
[02:52:17.040 --> 02:52:22.480]  arms should have said immediately we're releasing the tapes have added america identify all the bad
[02:52:22.480 --> 02:52:28.880]  actors to include nancy polosi her daughter a film crew her full crew with her daughter alexandra
[02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:34.560]  her son-in-law michael a notice under oath reab submitted quote he orchestrated it he did orchestrate
[02:52:34.560 --> 02:52:38.480]  it and when they asked him did you work with the fbi or law enforcement he said no but that
[02:52:38.480 --> 02:52:44.000]  still doesn't mean he didn't work with alexandra polosi or polosi herself or her son-in-law michael
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:50.480]  voss or john sullivan who is the cutout between ray epps and michael voss and uh nancy polosi's
[02:52:50.480 --> 02:52:55.120]  daughter i've done the deep dive on this alex i don't know how much time we got but we basically
[02:52:55.120 --> 02:53:00.080]  don't have enough time to talk about all the details on this uh bottom line those individuals
[02:53:00.080 --> 02:53:06.240]  that i just mentioned are the is who i've also been investigating other than mic pence so like
[02:53:06.240 --> 02:53:10.400]  everything i've just discussed about on all the different aspects of all the transgressions
[02:53:10.400 --> 02:53:16.800]  committed by not only executive branch actors but the previous 117th house of representatives
[02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:21.360]  we're going to go after all of them and if kevin mccarthy is not going to play ball guess what
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:27.680]  we're going to make sure that he plays ball or he's removed because i think we won massively by
[02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:32.640]  putting him in the straight jacket and duct tape on his face uh with the with i what i call the the
[02:53:32.640 --> 02:53:38.400]  uh terrific 20 and real team said it was a great it was a great exercise of power now
[02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:43.360]  exactly we can now push back and demand that it occurs and i don't know why we aren't pushing
[02:53:43.360 --> 02:53:49.520]  hard against the marjorie taylor greens the matt gates to demand it's not there's no longer talk
[02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:55.600]  of releasing the tapes it's releasing the tapes and now going after uh and getting the sergeant
[02:53:55.600 --> 02:54:01.280]  arms and notice they classified the jan six fake committee classified it for 20 years what are you
[02:54:01.280 --> 02:54:06.800]  not what are they hiding why would they classify everything absolutely if we're so bad why are
[02:54:06.800 --> 02:54:11.840]  they classifying their full report well they another thing that needs to happen is the new
[02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:16.320]  house under mccarthy needs to pull back on the criminal referrals of all the j6 peaceful defendants
[02:54:16.320 --> 02:54:21.840]  right and then also peter novaro and and steve bannon why are they even still in the trial
[02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:27.120]  why why doesn't the speaker of the house call them in to testify for four seconds rendering their
[02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:32.640]  their uh criminal charge moot i don't understand what i'm talking about is the whole contempt
[02:54:32.640 --> 02:54:37.200]  piece no longer in congress and walk in and say hey i testify okay your testimony is done
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:43.840]  it's moot done flick it out well they've definitely pushed too far i want to close out with this
[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:47.520]  how big is it to have all the twitter files coming out we know it's all the other groups
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:53.120]  doing it but man that's big what's your real view on elon musk so first part twitter files
[02:54:53.120 --> 02:54:59.120]  the lemmings are now waking up the normies the rhinos they have to face reality that we were
[02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:08.160]  right for three years now on as far as elon musk um i'm initially i thought he was you know good
[02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:13.520]  but let's just face it you're not on twitter my original accounts not on twitter so that should
[02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:18.080]  tell you i think a lot i don't understand why you're not on twitter well yeah the really
[02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:23.440]  effective people aren't yeah so he's kind of walking this fine line i guess but bottom line i
[02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:27.600]  think he's still fbi is still coming after him but if i think if we escalate in the in the house
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:32.960]  actually an hour ago to elon musk just put out a tweet saying that um uh something about how
[02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:35.760]  it's possible that the fbi is going to come after him for a couple things i can't remember
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:40.160]  the exact tweets if you can yeah no i respect him for what i mean i respect he's definitely
[02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:45.680]  pissing him off definitely keep going because everything that i put out was just legal analysis
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:49.360]  well i think he's really smart and he sees the globalists as weak and he just wants to take
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:53.840]  over well if he took over and got out of the way of freedom that'd be fine we want powerful
[02:55:53.840 --> 02:55:59.760]  corporations that are pro america pro freedom but yeah i'm not on the fence i initially wore he
[02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:04.000]  uh i warmed up to him but right now uh he said what a couple weeks ago that he was going to release
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:07.440]  everybody out of twitter jail well guess what we're still on twitter he also said he was going to
[02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:11.120]  release faulty files where are they we're still not in the i think he's playing games but at the
[02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:16.560]  end of the day he has released on a lot of twitter files yeah like 15 dumps now yeah so i i i think
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:23.920]  the jury's he's definitely elon musk reinstate alex jones info wars and if you want to reinstate
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:27.520]  my legal analysis by all means but i think alex needs to go all right you're going to be with
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:31.760]  all of us shroyer in about an hour from now in about 62 minutes what are you going to be covering
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:35.920]  i think we're going to go in a little bit more deep dive maybe we can go in a little bit more
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:40.480]  deep dive on pence specific actions that we need to take with each one of these committees on bullet
[02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:44.080]  points of what and i think we should war game how the enemies strike back because they're losing
[02:56:44.080 --> 02:56:49.520]  right now but in their mindset in their modus operandi they're going to double down i'm really
[02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:55.760]  concerned about the double after ray we're going after pence we're by the way ray and chris christy

[03:00:16.800 --> 03:00:23.600]  extension of what began in the old one hey i'm safia and i'm powered by artificial intelligence
[03:00:23.600 --> 03:00:28.160]  you might be wondering what artificial intelligence can do for you popular news outlet has been
[03:00:28.160 --> 03:00:36.240]  publishing ai articles since november and no one noticed most of these articles on buzz feed and
[03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:44.240]  even cnn and and and articles over that's seen at art written by ai and right now chat gpt is
[03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:51.600]  rattling the ai world turning out stunningly humanoid writing just ask douglas rushkoff a
[03:00:51.600 --> 03:00:57.760]  renowned author and professor of media culture it is writing better um than than most of my
[03:00:57.760 --> 03:01:03.760]  students write at this point how does it work chat gpt has been filled in a sense with a massive
[03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:10.560]  amount of information imagine the biggest library you can then programmed and trained by humans to
[03:01:10.560 --> 03:01:18.560]  process and spit it out in conversational phrases and all that means chat gpt or more advanced ai
[03:01:18.560 --> 03:01:24.800]  like it could replace people in all sorts of positions this could potentially save time and
[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:31.440]  resources but it could also lead to a loss of personal connections and a decline in the quality
[03:01:31.440 --> 03:01:37.280]  of these types of interactions we know that because everything rushkoff said just there
[03:01:37.280 --> 03:01:44.240]  was written by chat gpt so basically you write one article that's 10 pages long and then it gets
[03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:48.960]  recycled into thousands of other articles that are a page two three pages long and the ai just
[03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:54.080]  moves around and i remember seeing articles i could tell didn't quite make sense and didn't
[03:01:54.080 --> 03:02:00.320]  have names on them or had names i'd look up that don't exist the clear and present danger of
[03:02:00.320 --> 03:02:05.600]  disinformation uh is our conversation here this afternoon it follows a session just now about
[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:09.040]  disrupting distrust and of course those are connected so i hope that's where we can start
[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:14.560]  think about how we just calmly discuss the fact that oh ai for many years secretly is writing news
[03:02:14.560 --> 03:02:19.760]  articles with information with disinformation it's fed that way you don't have a reporter that can
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:26.080]  come back later and say i was told to lie or you can't even basically expose the person
[03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:32.080]  it's following orders he doesn't have a conscience they won't ask questions they will follow criminal
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:42.480]  orders and they could have their memories wiped but but but think about cell phones until cell
[03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:47.840]  phones and until iphone's and smartphones came out the last 15 years i could remember the phone
[03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:51.920]  number i had when i was a teenager i could remember my grandma's phone number i remember
[03:02:51.920 --> 03:02:57.840]  some of my girlfriend's numbers because i was trained we were all trained to commit numbers to
[03:02:57.840 --> 03:03:04.160]  memory so once i dialed the number two or three times i could remember that number you you couldn't
[03:03:04.160 --> 03:03:08.800]  write it down but you could just punch it into the phone it was it was mental memory a form of
[03:03:08.800 --> 03:03:14.640]  like muscle memory and go back to skeletons they dig up in ancient africa in in ancient europe
[03:03:14.640 --> 03:03:22.400]  in ancient asia the people they estimate were twice as strong as they are today and a man
[03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:30.560]  from 5 000 years ago in england or a man from a thousand years ago in africa or a man from
[03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:37.520]  6 000 years ago in the middle east was twice as strong as the average man today just with their
[03:03:37.520 --> 03:03:45.680]  genetics you are obsolete is the words what lie no man is obsolete now we're becoming softer and
[03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:50.320]  softer and softer and the televisions and the dopamine and the smartphones on record
[03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:58.000]  have lowered the average human's attention span in the modern world to less than 14 seconds
[03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:03.680]  the attention span of a goldfish is about 16 seconds so what does it mean when humans are
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:10.560]  taken out of the equation well it means we become by action obsolete the narcotics that you call
[03:04:10.560 --> 03:04:18.480]  literature poetry it says all kinds all of it you have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream
[03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:25.600]  and the state has no use for your kind what qualifies as hate speech as illegal hate speech
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:32.560]  which you will have soon also in us i think that we we have a strong reason why we have this
[03:04:32.560 --> 03:04:40.880]  in the criminal law we we need the platforms to simply work with the language and to identify
[03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:48.080]  such cases the ai would be too dangerous i tell you i don't care i'm a human being i exist if i
[03:04:48.080 --> 03:04:52.960]  speak one for a loud that thought lives even after i'm troubled in my grave
[03:04:52.960 --> 03:05:03.920]  i talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had i don't think anybody can deny it
[03:05:04.560 --> 03:05:09.760]  and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the crew at
[03:05:09.760 --> 03:05:16.240]  info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have been the mvps in
[03:05:16.240 --> 03:05:21.440]  this fight and we look at harrison smith and the oensroyer and the hard work they engage in every
[03:05:21.440 --> 03:05:27.680]  day five six seven days a week it's really just incredible so for myself the whole info wars
[03:05:27.680 --> 03:05:33.040]  crew i thank you for your past support i only encourage you now to realize that info wars
[03:05:33.040 --> 03:05:37.520]  cannot stay on air if you do not support us i know you spread the word i know you pray for us
[03:05:37.520 --> 03:05:41.680]  and that's wonderful keep doing it but most viewers and listeners never go to info wars
[03:05:41.680 --> 03:05:46.240]  store dot com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life all at the same
[03:05:46.240 --> 03:05:50.400]  time keep us on air i know that less than one percent of our listeners actually go buy products
[03:05:50.400 --> 03:05:55.520]  in force where i come if just one percent more of you took action at one ten four four dot com
[03:05:55.520 --> 03:06:01.840]  our funding problems will be over please take action now
[03:06:06.800 --> 03:06:11.120]  welcome back to the alex joneshow and kate dally your guest host from kate dally radio dot com
[03:06:11.120 --> 03:06:16.720]  how are you guys today wow there's always so much to talk about i feel like uh broken records
[03:06:16.720 --> 03:06:22.640]  sometimes when i say that but it feels this way so consistently and so overwhelmingly when i started
[03:06:22.640 --> 03:06:28.800]  radio years ago it didn't feel like that it felt like there were big stories every once in a while
[03:06:28.800 --> 03:06:35.280]  and really for the most part it was um covering those but then just sort of in between kind of
[03:06:35.280 --> 03:06:42.800]  talking about just various things not anymore not anymore and it's been it's been uh stressful i know
[03:06:42.800 --> 03:06:48.640]  you're probably feeling the stress too and today i want to talk about the future i want to maybe
[03:06:48.640 --> 03:06:55.040]  give you some observations about what's coming in steps we know the overall plan and i think that
[03:06:55.680 --> 03:07:01.680]  all you have to do is understand the great reset to know where they're going but i think it's always
[03:07:01.680 --> 03:07:07.760]  fascinating even interesting to find out and scary to find out how they're doing it in steps
[03:07:07.760 --> 03:07:15.200]  right now without us really seeing i think for the most part most people expect and maybe i'm wrong
[03:07:15.200 --> 03:07:22.400]  but most people expect something major something huge to happen the stock market to crash the the
[03:07:22.400 --> 03:07:28.880]  biggest things to happen and then all of a sudden we know we're on our way i know that this year or
[03:07:28.880 --> 03:07:35.040]  i think this year they'll be sliding in digital currency to the masses based on some sort of
[03:07:35.040 --> 03:07:42.080]  false flag of some sort of hack from some other country that they'll blame it on there's lots of
[03:07:42.080 --> 03:07:48.480]  things like this that are looming right now but i think what's important is to sort of understand
[03:07:48.480 --> 03:07:55.600]  how quietly they're doing this and i it's so creepy to tell you the truth it's so creepy to see how
[03:07:55.600 --> 03:08:02.160]  they're just sort of quietly going along distracting us but just doing this in steps so this is kind of
[03:08:02.160 --> 03:08:07.920]  what i want to talk about today um before i get to a little bit on hologram transhumanism things
[03:08:07.920 --> 03:08:13.520]  like that the airlines all of those types of things the biden thing the biden thing is interesting
[03:08:13.520 --> 03:08:19.200]  because there's two theories either a it's a distraction or b it's a it's going to be to nixon
[03:08:19.200 --> 03:08:24.000]  him let's be honest you know it's going to be used to get him out without ever unveiling
[03:08:24.960 --> 03:08:31.360]  biden's actual crimes it's going to be more about hinting around them but his own people are giving
[03:08:31.360 --> 03:08:37.360]  the document his own people are giving us this information so they definitely want us to see it
[03:08:38.320 --> 03:08:43.840]  there's no mistake there there's an absolute reason as to why they show us what they show us
[03:08:43.840 --> 03:08:49.680]  otherwise they wouldn't be showing us so what is the reason was all the horse trading going on and
[03:08:49.680 --> 03:08:57.920]  deal making behind puppeteer mccarthy was there way more to that than just people trying to stand
[03:08:57.920 --> 03:09:05.840]  up to the establishment was it more about somebody taking the presidency was it more about installing
[03:09:05.840 --> 03:09:11.680]  the next puppet and people standing up to that it could have been but for some reason it just keeps
[03:09:11.680 --> 03:09:17.120]  hitting me that i think there's something a lot darker going on there um and really what's it play
[03:09:17.120 --> 03:09:24.720]  they're getting a lot of mileage out of biden a lot of mileage so why stop that what would be the
[03:09:24.720 --> 03:09:29.840]  reason well they're also getting a lot of blowback right now too and they're getting a lot of people
[03:09:29.840 --> 03:09:35.120]  as we as we well know right uh talking about the fact that they don't trust the media they
[03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:41.040]  do not trust the medical cabal now um people too many people have been hurt by it too many people
[03:09:41.040 --> 03:09:47.600]  had their eyes open myself included from personal obvious example so if you have too much of that
[03:09:47.600 --> 03:09:53.600]  going on too many people dying unexpectedly too much happening you want to probably install some
[03:09:53.600 --> 03:10:00.400]  complacency or some feeling like we're winning and that's what that is i think there was never
[03:10:00.400 --> 03:10:04.720]  going to be another choice other than mccarthy mccarthy was going to get in and maybe they just
[03:10:04.720 --> 03:10:08.880]  wanted to make it look like it was some sort of battle to give us some sort of feeling that
[03:10:09.600 --> 03:10:16.000]  these elites this group of puppetry doesn't always just get to do what they want maybe they
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:21.520]  had to make it look like a struggle maybe that's the third theory who knows you know what at the end
[03:10:21.520 --> 03:10:26.880]  of the day you and i both know that this doesn't matter because it really doesn't matter who's at
[03:10:26.880 --> 03:10:33.200]  the helm i know people that say well if we got rid of biden you know we this country could finally
[03:10:33.200 --> 03:10:38.880]  move in the right direction but the problem with that is is that everyone knows he wasn't elected
[03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:46.400]  this isn't news and why did he get a facelift in a nose job at 80 years old if he's the most popular
[03:10:46.400 --> 03:10:52.160]  man in the history of america i mean it's all a joke right it's all a joke so we know that he
[03:10:52.160 --> 03:11:00.400]  didn't get voted in but that's what i'm saying does it even matter anymore will it because we
[03:11:00.400 --> 03:11:06.160]  know that these people are selected and we know that really the only change you can make is locally
[03:11:06.160 --> 03:11:13.920]  and locally all of our elected officials are upended by the feds they are thrived by the feds
[03:11:13.920 --> 03:11:19.840]  continuously and the only place you're going to actually see any change at all if you can get that
[03:11:19.840 --> 03:11:24.560]  change because it won't be at the state level will be at the local level and this is why it's so
[03:11:24.560 --> 03:11:30.240]  important to go to the meetings confront to call them out to tell them what they're doing to our
[03:11:30.240 --> 03:11:35.600]  cities and smart cities and all the rest there's a reason for this and we got to get bolder on this
[03:11:36.560 --> 03:11:41.840]  but i do want to talk about some of the other things affecting us too over the weekend i was
[03:11:41.840 --> 03:11:48.240]  at a conference with dr paul thomas and he's amazing pediatrician 30 years and started doing data
[03:11:48.240 --> 03:11:55.440]  on all of his patients um all of the kids because he wanted his own data well they they successfully
[03:11:55.440 --> 03:12:00.720]  took away his license and it wasn't because you know he was doing something you know dastardly
[03:12:00.720 --> 03:12:07.120]  like how they used to take away licenses you know when people would be drunk during a surgery or
[03:12:07.120 --> 03:12:12.080]  i'm talking like the biggest defenses that you could ever imagine now it's just for data you
[03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:16.560]  want to look at the data of your own patients oh then you get annihilated your career taken from
[03:12:16.560 --> 03:12:23.040]  you but more importantly was what he found inside the data and inside the data of his
[03:12:23.040 --> 03:12:30.320]  vaccinated versus versus unvaccinated children he noticed some alarming things the kids that were
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:41.440]  not vaxed in his practice had zero zero adhd they had no allergies they had no cancer they had uh
[03:12:41.440 --> 03:12:49.040]  they had no ear infections and if they did it was minute minute every single thing across the board
[03:12:49.040 --> 03:12:57.760]  was either zero or maybe like point zero zero zero two i mean it was phenomenal the graphs of the
[03:12:57.760 --> 03:13:04.400]  numbers as they charted up for vaccinations through the course of 30 years and how they stay
[03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:11.920]  zero to nothing in every single uh thing that he noted every single childhood illness that you
[03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:19.760]  could think of alarming most doctors are not going to do that kind of data on their kids
[03:13:19.760 --> 03:13:25.200]  they're just not going to do it well and you can see the penalties if you do you're not allowed to
[03:13:25.200 --> 03:13:32.720]  look at your own data as a doctor think about that that is scary he wasn't doing anything he was just
[03:13:32.720 --> 03:13:37.840]  looking at the numbers and then telling people about the numbers and doing informed consent in
[03:13:37.840 --> 03:13:44.080]  his office which meant that he lost a lot of money because a bustling pediatrician office can make
[03:13:44.080 --> 03:13:51.200]  about a million dollars or more a year just in the thank you payments from the government
[03:13:51.200 --> 03:13:59.760]  just in the we're so happy you visited on your well visit so glad to have injected you today
[03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:06.800]  goodbye um here's some cash for you dear doctor for telling these kids that they needed to do this
[03:14:08.320 --> 03:14:14.800]  it was alarming and i applaud the fact that he was out there talking about it i i really do
[03:14:14.800 --> 03:14:20.320]  i was also speaking with dr carrie midday um at an event and let me just tell you she had a lot to
[03:14:20.320 --> 03:14:25.600]  say about the medical cabal she had a lot to say about the cover-ups about the meetings she attended
[03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:32.480]  and i know alex has interviewed her and she has been an amazing source of truth in her and dr
[03:14:32.480 --> 03:14:40.640]  paul tomas in this insane world of disinformation it's really hard to tell the truth i always
[03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:45.120]  believe the doctors that have their career on the line not the ones that get paid as a tb expert
[03:14:45.120 --> 03:14:53.520]  but what does that say about dr paul's evidence of just his practice alone what does it say about
[03:14:53.520 --> 03:15:00.000]  that well it tells us that the whole history of these shots has not been beneficial to our kids
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:07.440]  and to ourselves it tells us that we are living in a world where a well-laid plan was put out
[03:15:07.440 --> 03:15:13.120]  to make sure that we started to believe that our immune system resided in a vial in a needle
[03:15:13.120 --> 03:15:21.600]  rather than inside our body and and given to us by a creator our creator it's so important to
[03:15:21.600 --> 03:15:27.520]  understand that piece of the puzzle and if you awaken to anything that's the piece that needs to
[03:15:27.520 --> 03:15:32.400]  be understood the most because that's what they're going to utilize the most in the future there's
[03:15:32.400 --> 03:15:36.880]  also some other things they're doing too and i do want to explain these because these are
[03:15:36.880 --> 03:15:44.080]  are coming upon us right now and i don't think we realize the level to which they want to implement
[03:15:44.080 --> 03:15:49.280]  these things but we're going to come back i want to talk about transhumanism the airline industry

[03:19:52.080 --> 03:20:05.120]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:20:11.440 --> 03:20:15.920]  back here with you on the alex jones show i'm kate dally your guest host from kate dally radio
[03:20:15.920 --> 03:20:22.960]  dot com and so happy to be here you know i i want to talk about elon for just a moment because i
[03:20:22.960 --> 03:20:29.280]  don't trust elon i i don't i don't trust him at all actually um i think that he's been on the forefront
[03:20:29.280 --> 03:20:36.160]  of major technologies that he outs and talks about and doesn't in sort of a freedom way i think the
[03:20:36.160 --> 03:20:43.440]  timing of his uh buying of twitter was to sort of give us sort of like a win as if we're winning
[03:20:43.440 --> 03:20:49.760]  something in the midst of the elections that we knew were not elections uh real elections where
[03:20:49.760 --> 03:20:54.160]  our votes were actually counted so i think the timing you always have to look at timing and you
[03:20:54.160 --> 03:21:00.960]  always have to see kind of beyond the stories that were given right because i would imagine and i
[03:21:00.960 --> 03:21:06.720]  would know that your this audience in particular is going to understand how to see and read between
[03:21:06.720 --> 03:21:14.000]  the lines so elon comes out in in a major videos and he's talking consistently about transhumanism
[03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:20.320]  and ai and all of these things basically mostly ai not really transhumanism as much as ai and he
[03:21:20.320 --> 03:21:26.480]  gives us certain things like uh you know it's uh you know it's it's it's not going to be that bad
[03:21:26.480 --> 03:21:32.400]  to have a drone uh trying to kill you and hunt you down as it would be the propaganda level that we're
[03:21:32.400 --> 03:21:38.640]  going to get now yeah drone is pretty bad trying to hunt you down you know he's trying to dismiss
[03:21:38.640 --> 03:21:43.280]  that and say that it's the propaganda it is the propaganda and i'll talk about that it is the
[03:21:43.280 --> 03:21:50.000]  propaganda that is the worst uh one of the worst effects of this because of the fact that they
[03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:56.160]  can get you to believe things that are not true right but there's so much more to it that never
[03:21:56.160 --> 03:22:07.280]  gets talked about ever in fact what has he once said that he wants to computerize the body as much
[03:22:07.280 --> 03:22:14.560]  as bill gates does has he ever outed what we turn into yeah he's he said we turn into a you know like
[03:22:14.560 --> 03:22:21.360]  a butterfly they can transform us but he never really says what exactly that they're doing that
[03:22:21.360 --> 03:22:28.240]  really is going to impact us on a level that would be hard to come back from okay so give you some
[03:22:28.240 --> 03:22:36.480]  truth and and then really not tell you the whole truth that's kind of how it works so looking at
[03:22:36.480 --> 03:22:43.360]  the realm of ai looking at what we're having to sort of take in and notice right now and what they
[03:22:43.360 --> 03:22:55.280]  say is coming by the year 2025 it it's so interesting to me the entire um gender conversation right now
[03:22:56.240 --> 03:23:01.200]  because it's being slammed down our throats now somebody could look at the gender thing and say
[03:23:01.200 --> 03:23:07.600]  well this is about kind of getting people to to analyze how they feel every day to basically
[03:23:07.600 --> 03:23:13.680]  toss around gender as if it means nothing as if you can just be what you want and it's all about
[03:23:13.680 --> 03:23:19.360]  fluidity and oh how nice it's all about how you feel and and gender doesn't matter and they're
[03:23:19.360 --> 03:23:25.040]  passing it off in all these shows and all these movies as a nothing to see here folks everybody
[03:23:25.040 --> 03:23:31.280]  can be sort of whatever gender they want and this is a big big deal because in transhumanism
[03:23:31.280 --> 03:23:40.240]  what are they showing us all the time that if we were to become transhuman that the gender is not
[03:23:40.240 --> 03:23:46.560]  part of it that gender has nothing to do with becoming a computerized body as bill gates says
[03:23:47.680 --> 03:23:53.920]  so the whole preface of the gender thing is to get you to think that or get our kids to think
[03:23:53.920 --> 03:24:02.160]  more importantly and and honestly that scares me to get our kids to to think that gender is such
[03:24:02.160 --> 03:24:10.240]  a nothing burger that by the time we figure out the transhuman level to which all most of us not
[03:24:10.240 --> 03:24:16.400]  us but most of us are becoming accustomed to because of this drip system and the shots of
[03:24:16.400 --> 03:24:22.400]  a just delivery system of these shots all the things we're getting in these shots that by that
[03:24:22.400 --> 03:24:29.520]  time it will be clung to it will be something that people go oh this is amazing because this
[03:24:29.520 --> 03:24:35.440]  tells us that gender doesn't matter because if you're a computerized body it won't it doesn't
[03:24:36.240 --> 03:24:41.920]  reminds me of the mr roger song remember the mr roger song where he said boys are boys and girls
[03:24:41.920 --> 03:24:47.040]  are girls and girls are moms and boys are dads and that's how it is and we're all fancy
[03:24:47.040 --> 03:24:55.440]  in what the in the gender we're in look how far we've come to where now that's actually a debate
[03:24:55.440 --> 03:25:01.040]  you never thought that was going to be a debate did you i didn't either i never in a million years
[03:25:01.040 --> 03:25:06.320]  would sit there and think that you have to defend gender that you actually have to have a conversation
[03:25:06.320 --> 03:25:14.080]  with somebody that implies that there are only two i never thought that we would have to have a fight
[03:25:14.080 --> 03:25:22.640]  to preserve our very souls that the our very humanness our our humanity i never thought we'd
[03:25:22.640 --> 03:25:30.000]  be there but you know what it's the perfect segue to transhumanism because you're way more likely
[03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:37.440]  to accept transhumanism is amazing if you think you can be a super computer whatever because you're
[03:25:37.440 --> 03:25:43.360]  not male or female anymore you're just sort of whatever it is can you flip a switch if you're
[03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:50.880]  transhuman and be black if you want to identify as black or brown or purple can i identify as a woman
[03:25:50.880 --> 03:25:58.480]  if i have a computerized body can i identify as a man can i identify as a boy or a girl
[03:25:59.680 --> 03:26:05.840]  how far does it go when you have a computerized body in the future it's something to think about
[03:26:05.840 --> 03:26:11.360]  but i think the i think when we get stuck on gender and you can't believe your ears when you hear
[03:26:11.360 --> 03:26:17.360]  people fighting about this and you think that you know you hear matt walsh talk about you know
[03:26:17.360 --> 03:26:23.600]  identify a woman right define what a woman is and the person can't do it well you can't define
[03:26:23.600 --> 03:26:27.920]  what a transhuman would be either because it would be such a mixture of everything
[03:26:28.960 --> 03:26:36.480]  so our kids are in a propaganda vat that teaches them that in the future this will all be basically
[03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:44.400]  validated the whole gender thing will be validated and put away because of the fact that
[03:26:44.400 --> 03:26:50.960]  as you become transhuman it just sort of supports the claims doesn't it it's a really scary thought
[03:26:50.960 --> 03:26:56.400]  it's really scary to me it is to me it is because i see kids falling for it i see people falling for
[03:26:56.400 --> 03:27:03.680]  it and the more we fall for it the more we head straight into a conversation about the fact that
[03:27:03.680 --> 03:27:12.320]  the more computerized you are so what right so what that's a problem and that's a problem of the
[03:27:12.320 --> 03:27:18.320]  propaganda elon was talking about he's going to give a lot of truth and that's one of the things
[03:27:18.320 --> 03:27:23.440]  that's very truthful we're not going to know what's real and what's not and that makes me more
[03:27:23.440 --> 03:27:29.360]  nervous than some of the things they're doing is the reality what is reality and what is not
[03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:33.280]  and that's why i want to talk about holograms i want to talk about the airlines and i want to talk
[03:27:33.280 --> 03:27:38.240]  about companies that are moving in that direction you know our smart cities that we've talked about
[03:27:38.240 --> 03:27:43.840]  for years alex has talked about these things for years on his show the smart cities and the way that
[03:27:43.840 --> 03:27:49.920]  they've infused this since 1991 to get our cities to be different in germany they say you know if
[03:27:49.920 --> 03:27:54.640]  you don't live in a city you're basically in a village that's what you are you're basically
[03:27:54.640 --> 03:28:00.800]  in a village and considering the fact that most roads seem to go back to germany that's kind
[03:28:00.800 --> 03:28:07.200]  of strange isn't it in of itself i'm looking at this whole situation play out and i want to talk
[03:28:07.200 --> 03:28:13.440]  about the company that is sort of changing uh transportation i want to talk about the airlines
[03:28:14.320 --> 03:28:20.960]  they're making it harder and harder to want to fly they're pushing the narrative so bad you can't
[03:28:20.960 --> 03:28:26.720]  have any consistency you won't get to your destination planes are not great why are they
[03:28:26.720 --> 03:28:34.240]  pushing that and it has a lot to do with what was in the cares act and also the you know the
[03:28:34.240 --> 03:28:39.520]  bill they just passed transportation the direction they're heading in and then it has a lot to do
[03:28:39.520 --> 03:28:45.600]  with control so i'll come back we'll talk about that because there's so much to see here and
[03:28:45.600 --> 03:28:57.600]  companies that are rarely named you write back on the elixir show you want to beat the new world

[03:33:11.600 --> 03:33:16.000]  welcome back to the alex jones show and k dally your guest host from k dally radio.com
[03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:20.880]  um let's talk about the airlines for a moment let's talk about transportation um
[03:33:21.920 --> 03:33:28.240]  they're making the airlines well obviously very unreliable you have pilots dying from shots
[03:33:28.800 --> 03:33:35.600]  they can't fly you have a reduced staff you have inconsistency you've got all kinds of outages
[03:33:36.560 --> 03:33:42.800]  whatever that was that outage was just designed to make us look very very weak so that when they do a
[03:33:42.800 --> 03:33:50.800]  cyber attack on the banks it'll look like well you know we just weren't prepared
[03:33:52.160 --> 03:33:57.440]  i i definitely think that's why that attack happened on why we saw the flights all grounded
[03:33:58.080 --> 03:34:03.200]  it was to make us look vulnerable make us look weak there was obviously plenty of money given
[03:34:03.200 --> 03:34:10.080]  by the feds in order to um shore up the the against cyber hackers but it didn't happen
[03:34:10.080 --> 03:34:19.680]  okay so now we have this total onslaught of flying is not so great you don't want to do it
[03:34:19.680 --> 03:34:25.600]  and also we know that private charters now are saying hey i want unvaxxed pilots for a reason
[03:34:26.160 --> 03:34:31.760]  i guess they don't want to die in flight so you know they want the unvaxxed to be pilots make sense
[03:34:31.760 --> 03:34:40.800]  so where's the where why what's what's the reason for this in 2020 in april of 2020
[03:34:42.000 --> 03:34:47.200]  the government announced that there were three industries they were going to be taking over
[03:34:47.200 --> 03:34:53.520]  and they did this in a video and one of the one of the things they were taking over was airlines
[03:34:54.080 --> 03:34:58.240]  and they were going to completely put the nail in the coffin not just federal oversight we're
[03:34:58.240 --> 03:35:05.760]  talking about owning them because they were giving them so many covid dollars and i do believe that
[03:35:05.760 --> 03:35:10.240]  the other one was uh one of the other three was the hospitals of course putting that nail in the
[03:35:10.240 --> 03:35:14.960]  coffin again because we saw laws change that supported nih directives to the hospitals that
[03:35:14.960 --> 03:35:21.440]  they couldn't fight so doctors can't be doctors anymore it's all done by lawyers so the airlines
[03:35:21.440 --> 03:35:28.800]  the airlines um now that they're owned completely it's interesting the amount of
[03:35:29.600 --> 03:35:34.480]  articles you're going to see about how difficult it is to fly and hard it is to fly we just never
[03:35:34.480 --> 03:35:38.320]  know when the next outage is going to be and we don't have enough you know all these little
[03:35:38.960 --> 03:35:44.400]  kind of the outlier companies are going to go away right um so you'll see a major conglomeration
[03:35:44.400 --> 03:35:50.640]  i bet and then when they started putting money into amtrak i've mentioned this before on the show
[03:35:50.640 --> 03:35:55.680]  that i was a little like i thought it was strange the amount of money that they spelled out with
[03:35:55.680 --> 03:36:01.520]  covid dollars to go to amtrak thought that was a little strange and we have 5g we have 6g we
[03:36:01.520 --> 03:36:07.840]  have a lot of things that are being implemented and it isn't about speed of internet it's about
[03:36:07.840 --> 03:36:13.520]  data collection and you all know that so what is up with amtrak what's up with these trains
[03:36:14.320 --> 03:36:20.240]  so there have been a lot of articles in the last couple of weeks last month the whole last month
[03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:24.960]  about let's take a sneak peek at amtrak what are they doing what's going on and this certainly
[03:36:24.960 --> 03:36:31.120]  ties into smart cities and this is what i want you to see so they talked about the new trains
[03:36:31.120 --> 03:36:37.440]  having you know room for your legs airlines don't right that's the story and of course bigger tray
[03:36:37.440 --> 03:36:43.680]  tables and upgraded lighting and they have brand new ways that you can just jump on the internet
[03:36:43.680 --> 03:36:48.400]  and you won't get bounced off and it doesn't matter what network you're on they have all of these new
[03:36:48.400 --> 03:36:55.280]  ways to make traveling a beautiful thing up to 125 miles an hour right and of course they're going
[03:36:55.280 --> 03:37:01.120]  electric they have electric and diesel power but these new trains are also expected to reduce
[03:37:01.120 --> 03:37:09.760]  travel times so here's the deal so you got they have the hybrid battery diesel system right run
[03:37:09.760 --> 03:37:16.480]  on batteries and also without people at the helm just straight up running a train on a train that's
[03:37:16.480 --> 03:37:22.560]  completely computerized and electric most mostly electric and that's what they're touting over and
[03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:29.200]  over again what's interesting about this and i noticed this was about seamans the company seamans
[03:37:29.200 --> 03:37:37.200]  that the contract was given to and this is a 7.3 billion dollar initiative meaning really just
[03:37:37.200 --> 03:37:43.360]  the beginning to upgrade the infrastructure and equipment to completely overhaul our country
[03:37:43.360 --> 03:37:50.800]  right and that award went to seamans seamans mobility got the first 3.4 billion dollar contract to
[03:37:50.800 --> 03:37:55.920]  design and build new trains state-of-the-art trains that you're going to want to be on that's
[03:37:55.920 --> 03:38:01.520]  what they keep telling you what is seamans because people don't talk about it a lot seamans is a
[03:38:01.520 --> 03:38:09.520]  german mm-hmm a german multinational conglomerate corporation largest industrial manufacturing
[03:38:09.520 --> 03:38:16.240]  company in europe headquartered in munich of course right i would do the accent i'm horrible at accents
[03:38:16.240 --> 03:38:22.320]  but it sounds just like a Schwab okay and when you think of seamans all you need to do is think of
[03:38:22.320 --> 03:38:33.040]  you know soros chirps uh you know Schwab seamans all the nazi ss you know it kind of it kind of all
[03:38:33.040 --> 03:38:40.880]  kind of plums together does it not anyway this is the same company that's been around 150 years
[03:38:40.880 --> 03:38:48.560]  that actually had the prisoners in 1944 working at a seamans factory from the oschwitz concentration
[03:38:48.560 --> 03:38:54.720]  camp that's kind of interesting isn't it yep they also forced labor of deported people in those
[03:38:54.720 --> 03:39:00.400]  extermination camps and did a whole bunch they were just on board with anything anything they
[03:39:00.400 --> 03:39:07.440]  were asked to do seamans company is now the company basically that owns our patents to
[03:39:07.440 --> 03:39:16.640]  electric railway and they have since 1885 they enjoy a majority of the patents um they are
[03:39:17.680 --> 03:39:22.960]  one of the the richest companies in germany they're kind of rarely talked about because
[03:39:22.960 --> 03:39:26.240]  they make agreements with all these other companies right and they take these other
[03:39:26.240 --> 03:39:30.960]  companies on and buy them out what i always find interesting when i'm researching is why
[03:39:30.960 --> 03:39:37.120]  they're buying out certain companies and for what reason now the dresser company was a company that
[03:39:37.120 --> 03:39:43.040]  george senior bush worked at in that 10 year of his biography that he knew they never talk about
[03:39:43.040 --> 03:39:52.480]  what he actually did dresser industries was more like a cia front and dresser rand was is now an
[03:39:52.480 --> 03:39:58.000]  american engineering and manufacturing company owned by seamans energy and so they acquired them
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:04.640]  in 2016 it's really interesting to kind of follow along the timeline of who they acquired and why
[03:40:04.640 --> 03:40:11.520]  they acquired them and that's what i want to talk to you about now dresser industries goes way back
[03:40:11.520 --> 03:40:20.720]  has a long history and um and i would say very suggested like as far as not really really understanding
[03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:26.080]  what they do i know senior bush worked for him for 10 years but that's the 10 years i also suspect
[03:40:26.080 --> 03:40:33.760]  he was also in the cia but they would never admit it everybody knows that story right um so then they
[03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:39.680]  in 2012 they're they're they're getting companies like synchrony then they're they've got dresser
[03:40:39.680 --> 03:40:47.280]  ran for 7.6 billion they they acquire mitzubishi heavy industries they've got compressor and they've
[03:40:47.280 --> 03:40:52.560]  got gas turbine industry they've got just about every single industry that you could possibly
[03:40:52.560 --> 03:40:59.280]  imagine under the sun um they also have been known for bribes all through history they've had they've
[03:40:59.280 --> 03:41:06.000]  had to pay out so many fines for bribes it's comical the company is obviously what you think it is
[03:41:06.880 --> 03:41:12.000]  and they've been outed quite a few times but never really outed and never actually stopped
[03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:16.560]  from doing business because we're well equipped to do business with them in fact they're pretty
[03:41:16.560 --> 03:41:23.600]  much getting this in these entire contracts for transportation they also did uh they bought fast
[03:41:23.600 --> 03:41:29.200]  track diagnostics and came up with a group called health and ears i know you're probably thinking
[03:41:29.200 --> 03:41:35.040]  why does that sound familiar well q disney disney had the imagineers right right that's what they
[03:41:35.040 --> 03:41:39.680]  call them so health and ears and they were roasted for this they were absolutely roasted for that
[03:41:39.680 --> 03:41:44.880]  because it sounded so stupid they actually had an event where they did a whole brand change in the
[03:41:44.880 --> 03:41:51.920]  health care industry and with people dancing around in faceless body suits of orange and blue
[03:41:52.480 --> 03:41:58.960]  promoting this rebranding then of course they started in on the whole hologram the whole
[03:41:58.960 --> 03:42:04.240]  hologram thing and i'll talk about that in a moment but when they started doing this whole
[03:42:04.240 --> 03:42:12.880]  fast track and getting into all of these different types of remote medicine changing the face of the
[03:42:12.880 --> 03:42:21.280]  way we view hospitals the way we view care the way we administer that care the way that hospitals
[03:42:21.280 --> 03:42:28.800]  won't have walls anymore things will be done from home there are a big big part of that big company
[03:42:28.800 --> 03:42:32.960]  involved in that don't think for a second just because you don't hear this name all the time
[03:42:32.960 --> 03:42:41.280]  that they aren't a big thing to to to really look at they've got a lot of equipment and things in
[03:42:41.280 --> 03:42:46.560]  laboratories that comes from semen and i'll talk about that in a moment because they are they're
[03:42:46.560 --> 03:42:50.480]  the ones that get to tell you if you're going to have covid you're right back
[03:42:56.800 --> 03:43:02.320]  in early 2022 info wars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air

[03:47:11.040 --> 03:47:17.200]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm k dally so let's let's let's start this segment this last
[03:47:17.200 --> 03:47:24.320]  segment here you have a group you have a populist that reside in this country let's just talk about
[03:47:24.320 --> 03:47:33.920]  this country for a second and we have a real freedom understanding a love for liberty like no
[03:47:33.920 --> 03:47:40.080]  other we're a good people and if you want to control and change that what do you affect the most
[03:47:40.640 --> 03:47:50.160]  the body okay the health and you also affect control over how we get anywhere how we move about
[03:47:50.160 --> 03:47:57.520]  who we who we talk to what we what we do in our in our private lives right and it all comes down
[03:47:57.520 --> 03:48:04.160]  to control and we know that the whole smart cities the whole um stripping our fertilizers
[03:48:04.960 --> 03:48:09.760]  and putting in synthetic for fertilizers and starting with the whole process of changing
[03:48:09.760 --> 03:48:15.840]  our food supply we didn't have heart problems before 1920 they started ripping potassium out of
[03:48:15.840 --> 03:48:20.320]  our fertilizer um they started taking iron out they started taking all these things and making
[03:48:20.320 --> 03:48:27.200]  us very deficient and then started injecting us with a vial and a needle and telling us that was
[03:48:27.200 --> 03:48:32.080]  our hope in our immune system when really what they were doing was starting with our soil and our
[03:48:32.080 --> 03:48:37.920]  food and then going into medicine to get us to believe that those shots were always saving us
[03:48:37.920 --> 03:48:43.200]  they never were they were the very thing causing the problems that we have now this is why we're
[03:48:43.200 --> 03:48:51.360]  so sickly now we're a sickly nation now our diet and our healthcare because we believed them so now
[03:48:51.360 --> 03:49:00.400]  we walk into looking at trains being being sort of paraded around as the new big thing the infrastructure
[03:49:00.400 --> 03:49:04.160]  in the cities if you don't live in a city you're in a village you don't want to be in a village
[03:49:04.160 --> 03:49:08.800]  eh you know you want to be in a city where everything's exciting and it's happening and
[03:49:08.800 --> 03:49:14.320]  you can get everywhere quickly and you're also very very controlled too okay and this is why they
[03:49:14.320 --> 03:49:19.360]  started in on the the whole bike paths and that you don't need a car and I'll get to that in just
[03:49:19.360 --> 03:49:24.640]  a second because Siemens is all over that trust me on that one and like I said when you have
[03:49:24.640 --> 03:49:28.160]  headlines it's always trying to pick out the nugget of the truth because it's the company's
[03:49:28.160 --> 03:49:32.880]  not talked about it's the people that we don't really discuss all the time are usually having
[03:49:32.880 --> 03:49:40.160]  more success behind the scenes in a in a in a horrific way than we think so the we have the
[03:49:40.160 --> 03:49:46.560]  research and development we also have the the health stuff that the Siemens health and ears
[03:49:47.200 --> 03:49:51.760]  this this company got into quite heavily even into the technology of telling you
[03:49:51.760 --> 03:49:57.200]  that they can actually tell you if you're going to get COVID-19 this year now that's a bunch of
[03:49:57.200 --> 03:50:02.560]  BS and you know it but they'll tell you that they think they can they have that fostered for you
[03:50:02.560 --> 03:50:12.080]  so they can predict that so are they combining this infrastructure with your health your identity
[03:50:12.080 --> 03:50:18.000]  everything else on these trains that they're implementing why all the new contracts why
[03:50:18.000 --> 03:50:26.080]  all the new trains why the insistence of having Amtrak gets so much money right now and also
[03:50:26.080 --> 03:50:31.840]  why do they want air travel to be mostly for the elites and less for the people like us
[03:50:32.960 --> 03:50:41.600]  makes one wonder doesn't it so basically they did a a whole hologram outing of the health in
[03:50:41.600 --> 03:50:47.600]  years it was hologram is the future doctors visits will be a doctor in hologram form visiting you
[03:50:47.600 --> 03:50:52.000]  in your house it'll be you just talking to a computer basically but you'll think it's a
[03:50:52.000 --> 03:50:56.880]  doctor's visit you'll feel good about it right you'll have enough computerized parts in your system
[03:50:56.880 --> 03:51:02.880]  from all the shots from flu shots to COVID shots do you name it that you'll have enough computerized
[03:51:02.880 --> 03:51:08.720]  systems in your body that you will be they'll be able to do things from afar they will go to the
[03:51:08.720 --> 03:51:14.640]  hospital to get some sort of you know a camera to tell them what's going on in your intestines
[03:51:14.640 --> 03:51:19.680]  not necessary not necessary just load you up to the system and they can do it from there
[03:51:19.680 --> 03:51:27.920]  and it'll be with a doctor a computer doctor not necessarily a doctor doctor not that I trust
[03:51:27.920 --> 03:51:32.640]  doctors anymore I really don't there's very very few I would actually trust so you're going to see
[03:51:32.640 --> 03:51:37.840]  more and more articles even the Pew research that came out they actually came out with an
[03:51:37.840 --> 03:51:43.040]  article last year and experts say the new normal in 2025 will be far more tech driven
[03:51:43.040 --> 03:51:48.640]  presenting bigger challenges but you'll like them and less real human interaction to tell you the
[03:51:48.640 --> 03:51:53.520]  truth this is why they want to make it look like being in a village would be horrible being in a
[03:51:53.520 --> 03:51:59.920]  city you'll actually be around people more okay and they talk about this in a way of selling us
[03:51:59.920 --> 03:52:06.800]  on this they also there have been many articles including the Washington compost and many others
[03:52:06.800 --> 03:52:11.680]  the Smithsonian that say the first look at the trains that will replace Amtrak's 50 year old rail
[03:52:11.680 --> 03:52:17.760]  cars are amazing but over in Germany what they're doing is they're just they're putting trucks
[03:52:17.760 --> 03:52:24.480]  delivery trucks on a rail system that they implement on the highway so they take these wires
[03:52:24.480 --> 03:52:29.360]  and they put them up and the trucks are on these wires and they say that their batteries are charging
[03:52:29.360 --> 03:52:37.360]  while they drive okay so they turned the highway system into a partial electric system by by the
[03:52:37.360 --> 03:52:45.040]  trucks wires above okay above the truck and connecting to these cables and these trucks
[03:52:45.040 --> 03:52:48.640]  can then get where they need to go the only problem is they're extremely controlled and
[03:52:48.640 --> 03:52:55.120]  can be shut down in a moment's notice that's a problem right but they're still selling all this
[03:52:55.120 --> 03:53:03.280]  to you they're still selling the electric highway hybrid electric truck and then they're also selling
[03:53:03.280 --> 03:53:09.520]  the trains saying they can go up to 125 miles an hour and you're gonna love these by the way George
[03:53:09.520 --> 03:53:16.560]  Siemens remember how I talked about all the S's Nazi Germany all the S's he was the nephew of
[03:53:16.560 --> 03:53:22.160]  Werner von Siemens founding director of Deutsch Spank see how it's all ancestral and grotesque
[03:53:23.200 --> 03:53:31.600]  anyway these people have been at the helm of so many things world economic forum board of trustees
[03:53:31.600 --> 03:53:39.440]  you name it and they're there to make sure they get the contracts they also have a chemistry analyzer
[03:53:39.440 --> 03:53:47.120]  and all kinds of just transforming data so many things that are so about control in the medical
[03:53:47.120 --> 03:53:51.600]  industry and I do believe they are going to be the one well they actually tout the fact that
[03:53:51.600 --> 03:53:59.680]  they're healthcare artificial intelligence AI with deep machine learning with over 65 applications
[03:53:59.680 --> 03:54:06.800]  and 700 patents to tell you how powerful they actually are how they'll train AI systems to
[03:54:06.800 --> 03:54:13.600]  analyze the data and lab values over algorithms how in the future healthcare will not be healthcare
[03:54:14.400 --> 03:54:18.720]  this is why you need to get supplements you need to make sure you have so many of those
[03:54:18.720 --> 03:54:25.040]  hyperbaric you need to make sure you have all of these things and away from the medical cabal
[03:54:25.040 --> 03:54:32.240]  because it's it's about to get so much worse and Siemens in the USA they're really touting the
[03:54:32.240 --> 03:54:39.040]  investment in the USA into building smarter infrastructure moving America into light rail
[03:54:39.040 --> 03:54:43.200]  but light rail remember if you have to go state to state you're not in an airplane they can't
[03:54:43.200 --> 03:54:49.520]  throw you off if you go state to state and they have state borders and you have to provide the
[03:54:49.520 --> 03:54:56.000]  the verification from state to state on vaccinations or requirements of that state can you even
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:03.840]  imagine what that would be like control wise and who would get to go on these right so you
[03:55:03.840 --> 03:55:09.040]  don't travel if you can't travel on these you don't have an electric car it's going to break down
[03:55:09.040 --> 03:55:16.880]  every five minutes you you can't travel are we looking at that so the train tech on the highways
[03:55:16.880 --> 03:55:21.600]  that was modeled after the elisa project in germany there's all kinds of things they have
[03:55:21.600 --> 03:55:29.920]  the panty out pantograph um the this that sort of like uh oh there's just so much to this in
[03:55:29.920 --> 03:55:36.000]  transportation i'm not going to have time to go over it hybrid drive the real fusion all these
[03:55:36.000 --> 03:55:43.200]  things they have ready and waiting and you know what the problem that we have is that it's hard
[03:55:43.200 --> 03:55:48.320]  to notice the things that are happening right underfoot i think that's such a that's a hard one
[03:55:48.320 --> 03:55:53.760]  it's a hard one for all of us the holograms in the future semen's talks about and they had a
[03:55:53.760 --> 03:55:59.200]  hologram dance i'm not joking about this they had a hologram dance a couple of years ago to tout
[03:55:59.200 --> 03:56:07.680]  their new hologram medical and hologram in the workplace that a computer will be your boss you
[03:56:07.680 --> 03:56:15.600]  will no longer have a boss it'll all be run by ai and so when we talk about nukes oh my gosh just
[03:56:15.600 --> 03:56:20.320]  nuke us already give me a break that that has been going on for 70 years the fear of nukes and the
[03:56:20.320 --> 03:56:25.360]  fear of nukes has really been about just the loss of liberty because you can do it on fear nobody's
[03:56:25.360 --> 03:56:32.080]  actually nuked us we're not actually nuking anyone else it's it's a fear-based thing okay if countries
[03:56:32.080 --> 03:56:38.480]  really wanted to come after us they'd band together and nuke us right it's not happening what i fear
[03:56:38.480 --> 03:56:47.360]  is the new what we think of reality sold to us in the form of metaverse in the form of not being
[03:56:47.360 --> 03:56:53.280]  reality trying to understand what is reality and what is not they also talked about also having a
[03:56:53.280 --> 03:56:58.480]  chip in the brain instead of the vr people got vrs this christmas you know virtual reality headsets
[03:56:58.480 --> 03:57:02.320]  they said oh that pesky headset you don't want that you just want something in your brain that you
[03:57:02.320 --> 03:57:09.680]  can just tell hey take me to this place and i'll be in that place it's creepy the hologram future
[03:57:09.680 --> 03:57:15.680]  is creepy start looking into it start really researching that because everything about it
[03:57:16.960 --> 03:57:27.920]  everything they sell you is fake it has nothing behind it no real anything just bakery at the end
[03:57:27.920 --> 03:57:34.640]  of the day and we've got to make sure our kids know what's coming and our grandkids right i'm
