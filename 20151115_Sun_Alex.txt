[00:00.000 --> 00:21.200]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the
[00:21.200 --> 00:39.480]  InfoWars.com Studios it's Alex Jones it is Sunday the 15th day of November 2015
[00:39.480 --> 00:46.720]  on Friday the 13th two days ago the third largest terror attack on Western
[00:46.720 --> 00:52.320]  soil since 9-11 took place the second largest the downing of the Russian
[00:52.320 --> 00:59.440]  aircraft killing 224 happened on Halloween and ISIS has pledged to strike
[00:59.440 --> 01:04.240]  all over Europe and the United States including using impads surface-to-air
[01:04.240 --> 01:10.000]  missiles that they've got thousands of thanks to Benghazi why would our
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.280]  government transfer those weapons to them knowingly and how do they think
[01:14.280 --> 01:18.440]  they're going to cover it up as more aircraft begin to get shot down like
[01:18.440 --> 01:22.320]  the British aircraft we learned that almost got shot down and barely was
[01:22.320 --> 01:28.880]  missed by an impad one month ago ladies and gentlemen we have three reporters
[01:28.880 --> 01:34.040]  Paul Joseph Watson from London Joe Biggs from Austin Texas and Michael Zimmerman
[01:34.040 --> 01:39.560]  from Austin Texas as well are all on the ground they basically have it slept they
[01:39.560 --> 01:44.520]  got in earlier today they are inside Paris less than 48 hours after the attacks
[01:44.520 --> 01:48.280]  they've been reporting from the ground when we come back from break we'll be
[01:48.280 --> 01:51.920]  talking to Paul Joseph Watson standing in front of the Eiffel Tower that has
[01:51.920 --> 01:56.440]  been shut down to the terror attacks at least seven different attacks inside
[01:56.440 --> 02:01.080]  Paris other attacks hardly getting any attention across Paris and across other
[02:01.080 --> 02:05.160]  areas of France other terror attacks are taking place in other areas of Europe
[02:05.160 --> 02:10.520]  and they're keeping them very very quiet reports of explosions fires stabbings
[02:10.520 --> 02:15.520]  shootings they're coming in we're trying to track all of it again six major
[02:15.520 --> 02:21.280]  attacks just that night in Paris several others since then burning shootings
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.800]  attacks counter strikes as refugee camps are burned this is the clash of
[02:26.800 --> 02:33.920]  civilizations that PNAC talked about so much so Paul Joseph Watson and Joe Biggs
[02:33.920 --> 02:39.040]  will be reporting with Mike Zimmerman the intrepid cameraman there with them as
[02:39.040 --> 02:47.600]  well this is overwhelming the angles of this obviously at nauseam four or five
[02:47.600 --> 02:51.520]  years since the attack on Libya using al-Qaeda we have said this would spread
[02:51.520 --> 02:55.960]  to the rest of the Middle East Syria Iraq Egypt and then to Europe and the
[02:55.960 --> 03:02.600]  United States the West is funding al-Qaeda al-Nazra ISIS they said eight
[03:02.600 --> 03:05.720]  months ago and six months ago and a month ago in the news that they were
[03:05.720 --> 03:10.720]  going to attack Europe with you with refugee hordes with their military
[03:10.720 --> 03:15.000]  operatives inside we would simply quote their quotes on air and we would have
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.520]  media matters MSNBC and others attack us and say it didn't exist there was not
[03:19.520 --> 03:24.400]  one terrorist amongst the military age men pouring in you see the videos in the
[03:24.400 --> 03:29.480]  photos it's the governments over there say it's 80% or so our military age men
[03:29.480 --> 03:35.800]  I see the videos I don't see the women and kids and on their own Twitter's and
[03:35.800 --> 03:41.240]  Facebook's they say they're coming to kill we broke this on Friday into Saturday
[03:41.240 --> 03:47.320]  drudge link to it then major news ABC News CBS News others picked it up and it's
[03:47.320 --> 03:52.320]  been confirmed by the French and Greek government Paris attack terrorist Ahmed
[03:52.320 --> 03:59.400]  al-Muhammad was rescued near Greece after his refugee boats sank now how did
[03:59.400 --> 04:02.880]  Paul Watson break that well the Greek government came out and released the
[04:02.880 --> 04:08.200]  info in tweets from their official ministry we picked it up other press
[04:08.200 --> 04:10.600]  went and picked it up and then it was put out and I'm not bragging that we
[04:10.600 --> 04:15.560]  broke that it's just I'm pointing out we are on target we are a serious news
[04:15.560 --> 04:21.560]  agency with three reporters on the ground right now in Paris and the reason I

[04:38.960 --> 04:44.720]  want it out this was a refugee with the fake passport almost all the quote
[04:44.720 --> 04:48.440]  refugees are not from Syria the jihadis are invading there and then infiltrating
[04:48.440 --> 04:53.120]  into Europe out of Syria where NATO is bringing them in it's all coming up from
[04:53.120 --> 05:01.280]  Paris straight ahead when cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in

[06:27.040 --> 06:31.000]  ladies and gentlemen I come to you from deep in the heart of Texas Austin on
[06:31.000 --> 06:37.400]  this live Sunday worldwide broadcast 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time Joe Biggs
[06:37.400 --> 06:42.440]  former Staff Sergeant US Army expert on al Qaeda fought him in Afghanistan and
[06:42.440 --> 06:47.880]  Iraq is joining us here in just a few minutes from the ground in Paris
[06:47.880 --> 06:53.280]  France just 48 hours after the tragic attacks they've been on the ground there
[06:53.280 --> 06:59.440]  now since this morning we also have Paul Joseph Watson from London who's also on
[06:59.440 --> 07:03.280]  the ground there in Paris outside the lockdown Eiffel Tower with our
[07:03.280 --> 07:10.400]  intrepid cameraman Michael Zimmerman let me set the table here if you're a new
[07:10.400 --> 07:14.120]  listener on our affiliates out there if you go back to the last five years of
[07:14.120 --> 07:21.920]  broadcast since the West began funding al Qaeda in Syria in Libya in Egypt and
[07:21.920 --> 07:27.200]  other countries in the Arab Spring to overthrow governments that were pro-west
[07:27.200 --> 07:32.160]  and put in jihadi governments and we can get into why that was done but that's
[07:32.160 --> 07:35.960]  on record WikiLeaks is being criticized today
[07:35.960 --> 07:41.880]  WikiLeaks blames America for Paris to tax many other Twitter users respond with
[07:41.880 --> 07:45.720]  hostility to WikiLeaks argument but the organization refuses to give ground well
[07:45.720 --> 07:50.960]  they didn't blame America listen to their tweet at least 39 dead tonight that
[07:50.960 --> 07:57.080]  that's right after it happened the terror attacks now it's over 100 250k dead in
[07:57.080 --> 08:02.280]  Syria and Iraq both the direct result of US UK France feeding Sunni extremist
[08:02.280 --> 08:09.640]  that's right the Wahhabist are a Sunni strain out of Saudi Arabia on record and
[08:09.640 --> 08:14.760]  our governments all of the Middle East have been defending them and funding them
[08:14.760 --> 08:21.160]  they are the rebels that our quote ally Saudi Arabia is funding and that our
[08:21.160 --> 08:26.400]  government's funding so the criminals in European governments and in our
[08:26.400 --> 08:30.920]  governments have opened the borders advertised the free lunch and are
[08:30.920 --> 08:35.280]  bringing the people in by the millions I just saw some national numbers out from
[08:35.280 --> 08:40.560]  Congress today where we've doubled Muslim integration since 9-11 immigration
[08:40.560 --> 08:48.160]  Europe has more than quadrupled it millions a year and mainly from radical
[08:48.160 --> 08:53.160]  countries military-age men so Rob Lowe comes out puts out a tweet not even
[08:53.160 --> 08:58.120]  really conservative and says I can't believe you waited this long to close
[08:58.120 --> 09:01.360]  your borders all the stuff going on like all he said was oh now the French
[09:01.360 --> 09:06.040]  government closes the borders and they have all this faux outrage how bad he
[09:06.040 --> 09:11.640]  is they've arrested Le Pen she's now the frontrunner in national polls she came
[09:11.640 --> 09:17.400]  in third place last time so to win the presidency she's now in the lead mainline
[09:17.400 --> 09:21.480]  nationalist libertarian conservative they act like she's an extremist and far
[09:21.480 --> 09:27.640]  right for saying we should control our borders they arrested her a month ago and
[09:27.640 --> 09:31.520]  charged her was saying there's a radical Islamic invasion close quote she was
[09:31.520 --> 09:36.840]  arrested that'd be like if they arrested Mitt Romney or something because he said
[09:36.840 --> 09:44.560]  you know there's a such and such an invasion from Mexico she's now on trial
[09:44.560 --> 09:51.520]  facing years in prison so so have that backdrop to understand ladies and
[09:51.520 --> 09:56.920]  gentlemen that the controlled left the socialists the EU types the EU dictatorship
[09:56.920 --> 10:01.480]  is using radical Islam to bully Europe into submission and now they're saying
[10:01.480 --> 10:06.000]  France is saying they're gonna start a bombing Assad because he won't be toppled
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.360]  by Al Qaeda and ISIS as if him being weak gives them a safe haven so we so now
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.520]  France has to take over Syria to then push ISIS out when the West including
[10:15.520 --> 10:22.400]  France put them in man that's playing off political ignorance right there now
[10:22.400 --> 10:26.520]  we're gonna cover all of this today but but is it a false flag not in the
[10:26.520 --> 10:34.600]  classical sense of a purely staged event like Oklahoma City or operation you
[10:34.600 --> 10:38.800]  know the stuff that went on in the 1960s with Operation Northwoods and Operation
[10:38.800 --> 10:43.800]  Ajax and others but the West the criminals running our governments want
[10:43.800 --> 10:50.280]  chaos crisis as their brand order out of chaos and so they want crises they want
[10:50.280 --> 10:55.280]  problems and they then will then take our liberties and our freedoms in the
[10:55.280 --> 10:59.880]  name of fighting radical Islam which they're funding it's a very simple
[10:59.880 --> 11:05.000]  equation problem-reaction solution to Gailian dialectic and that's what's
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.120]  going on and I predicted it to a T and I'm saying it's gonna get worse but
[11:09.120 --> 11:14.640]  before they really hit us with the big waves that are coming they cover up the
[11:14.640 --> 11:18.680]  Garland shooting say it is an Islamic the attack on the training centers the
[11:18.680 --> 11:22.120]  attack on the Army Navy recruiting centers they cover those up the Marine
[11:22.120 --> 11:26.480]  Corps were recruiting centers they cover those up they covered it all up they
[11:26.480 --> 11:31.640]  cover up the attacks on Charlie Hebdo they cover up the attack on Fort Hood
[11:31.640 --> 11:36.280]  and 14 people dead and won't say it was Islamic even though it was Hillary won't
[11:36.280 --> 11:39.280]  say in the Democratic debate no the other candidates will because they want to
[11:39.280 --> 11:44.180]  build it up first to where it's so horrible with sleeper cells it totally
[11:44.180 --> 11:50.040]  transforms our society forever when they strike I should think then they double
[11:50.040 --> 11:53.400]  cross and kick the Islamic sound or go after Saudi Arabia no they'll have
[11:53.400 --> 11:56.760]  political correctness and say we must submit to it or they'll blow us up
[11:56.760 --> 12:00.960]  that's how politically correct we are if we'll give up our kids and give up the
[12:00.960 --> 12:04.960]  word mother and father so they won't call us homophobic well of course we're
[12:04.960 --> 12:08.240]  gonna give up to millions of radical Islamists is coming in there and
[12:08.240 --> 12:11.840]  bullying us with the left all screaming and cheerleading for it who they never
[12:11.840 --> 12:15.760]  attack and touch now Paul Watson will be in the next segment I'm going to him
[12:15.760 --> 12:19.360]  now to break down what he's witness so far than Joe Biggs after that but we're
[12:19.360 --> 12:23.480]  gonna cover it all it is over the top Madonna says it's the West fault we got
[12:23.480 --> 12:26.960]  hit because we don't accept radical Islam we should love them and
[12:26.960 --> 12:30.280]  unconditionally well you go there and walk around a lot of hood on your head
[12:30.280 --> 12:34.760]  Saudi Arabia sweetie pie when you have sucked off the West sucked off the
[12:34.760 --> 12:39.160]  Renaissance acted like a liberal and now you make statements like this you are a
[12:39.160 --> 12:47.220]  joke now let's go to Paris France with Paul Joseph Watson reporting from the
[12:47.220 --> 12:51.880]  Eiffel Tower that is shut down you can see the other famous buildings of Notre
[12:51.880 --> 12:56.000]  Dame and others in the background Paul Watson this is a major sea change
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.080]  obviously if we can't get the borders controlled and kick radical Islamist
[13:00.080 --> 13:04.120]  out when they're openly calling for killing us now if Merkel can bully
[13:04.120 --> 13:08.680]  everyone into submitting she obviously runs Germany the new Hitler then where
[13:08.680 --> 13:13.520]  is all this going Paul Watson well the thing is Alex you would think that this
[13:13.520 --> 13:17.880]  would change the narrative right we've got at least two of these attackers these
[13:17.880 --> 13:23.160]  bombers proven to at least have stolen passports gotten via the refugee
[13:23.160 --> 13:27.440]  accepting system so whether they would those passports belong to them or not
[13:27.440 --> 13:32.120]  the fact is they abused the system which we had been warning about for months in
[13:32.120 --> 13:37.840]  fact I made a video in December last year saying that ISIS was about to attack
[13:37.840 --> 13:42.640]  major European cities Charlie Hebdo happened less than a month later now we
[13:42.640 --> 13:46.560]  have this we have these reports now confirmed by the Greek government which
[13:46.560 --> 13:52.320]  we report Saturday morning but one if not two of these attackers snuck into
[13:52.320 --> 13:57.360]  Europe on fake Syrian passports now the reaction to that from the left was oh
[13:57.360 --> 14:02.000]  this is not as it seems we can't treat this you know to blame all the refugees
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.440]  they're fleeing from ISIS we and we of course know that's not the case yes
[14:06.440 --> 14:10.400]  there are many Syrian refugees that fleeing from war and ISIS persecution
[14:10.400 --> 14:16.640]  or ISIS themselves said that they would use that crisis to sneak in multiple
[14:16.640 --> 14:20.800]  numbers of they said that in February of this year I'm showing the article they
[14:20.800 --> 14:24.920]  said that in February of this year listening to him exactly via Libya and
[14:24.920 --> 14:28.000]  that was even before the whole Syrian refugee thing blew up and could not be
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.400]  warned of it that was their plan now we have this whole backlash before this
[14:33.400 --> 14:38.480]  attack in Germany in other European countries massive protests people
[14:38.480 --> 14:42.720]  basically calling for Merkel to be deposed because of the dangers not only of
[14:42.720 --> 14:48.080]  this policy but of the social upheaval that Germany is already going through you
[14:48.080 --> 14:51.680]  know if this attack had happened in Germany which is a little different to
[14:51.680 --> 14:56.080]  France not as big a Muslim population there probably would have been riots on
[14:56.080 --> 14:59.880]  the streets because they're almost already off in fact top German security
[14:59.880 --> 15:04.520]  experts we report this two weeks ago are saying this is gonna lead to riots
[15:04.520 --> 15:09.080]  because it's not just about far right that they're getting angry about this
[15:09.080 --> 15:15.040]  now it's people who live in towns of 300 a village of 300 people who suddenly get
[15:15.040 --> 15:19.840]  inundated by a thousand refugees and that was one another had 100 and was
[15:19.840 --> 15:25.480]  given 340 something and told your children will literally quote serve them
[15:25.480 --> 15:32.080]  in national service now that that is proposing in fact they're already doing
[15:32.080 --> 15:38.880]  that with the school children and now they will go over what's happening
[15:38.880 --> 15:42.000]  currently what you witnessed there but why why we believe this is happening and
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.440]  what their next step will be but we know what it is first they say a hundred
[15:46.440 --> 15:49.200]  thousand then a million then three million refugees Obama wants to bring
[15:49.200 --> 15:55.000]  millions in the first arrived today in New Orleans stay with us they're coming

[20:10.800 --> 20:12.800]  thank you for coming to you
[20:12.800 --> 20:14.800]  this transmission is coming to you from Paris
[20:14.800 --> 20:18.800]  waging war on corruption
[20:18.800 --> 20:26.800]  it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[20:26.800 --> 20:32.920]  I don't want to play the actual theater shooting and hang-renating video shot by
[20:32.920 --> 20:37.640]  one of the horrified rock and roll fans that was there at the theater but I will
[20:37.640 --> 20:41.560]  show for TV viewers we also simulcast a full television production if you're a
[20:41.560 --> 20:46.320]  radio listener there's a free feed at info wars.com forward slash show
[20:46.320 --> 20:51.240]  important to add that that we are a radio show quote on television pioneering
[20:51.240 --> 20:55.000]  that format that so many others now duplicate and I'm very happy about that
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.400]  but it is important for us to note that for new loot for new listeners and
[20:59.400 --> 21:03.880]  viewers busy it can get confusing before you like to Paul Watson in front of the
[21:03.880 --> 21:09.560]  Eiffel Tower in Paris France here's some of the dramatic footage outside of the
[21:09.560 --> 21:31.400]  police involved in a gun battle with the terrorists here it is and the police
[21:31.400 --> 21:34.560]  that are credited run out in the street and save people that are crossing and
[21:34.560 --> 21:38.440]  expose themselves to gunfire they've been criticized for waiting for two hours
[21:38.440 --> 21:41.320]  before they went in but it turns out that they were waiting to get orders and
[21:41.320 --> 21:45.360]  what should happen because there were hostages inside that's still a pretty
[21:45.360 --> 21:52.080]  quick response to ours when you have hostages but they started killing the
[21:52.080 --> 21:55.440]  hostages it's better than a response with the Charlie Hebdo attack we're
[21:55.440 --> 22:00.760]  talking three days to get them they are leading a woman across the street and
[22:00.760 --> 22:04.920]  gunfire and it gets worse because there is also the political correctness of
[22:04.920 --> 22:09.600]  covering up the rocket launchers that were used inside the newspaper okay
[22:09.600 --> 22:13.640]  let's stop right there there's more of that all the raw footage up on info
[22:13.640 --> 22:18.560]  wars calm Paul this is the suspension of reality though with millions of
[22:18.560 --> 22:22.320]  radical Islamists is being brought in most of the military age men fake
[22:22.320 --> 22:26.320]  passports just like this guy had infiltrating through Syria these are
[22:26.320 --> 22:29.840]  mainly the people that have been in Syria murdering hundreds of thousands of
[22:29.840 --> 22:35.360]  Christians and Alawite and Shiite non-radical Muslims and I mean can
[22:35.360 --> 22:40.760]  Merkel get away with saying be nice to him bring more in this is an Islam can
[22:40.760 --> 22:44.680]  Hillary get away with not criticizing it how dare Obama come out and say we
[22:44.680 --> 22:48.760]  stand with France we're gonna help you fight ISIS when he knows full well the
[22:48.760 --> 22:53.280]  West including France has been funding this group to kill hundreds of thousands
[22:53.280 --> 22:57.120]  of people this is really sick Paul Watson what do you see there on the
[22:57.120 --> 23:01.440]  ground other points and what do you think's really behind this are they
[23:01.440 --> 23:05.040]  starting to turn against ISIS have they decided to not go along with Saudi
[23:05.040 --> 23:10.320]  Arabia's strategy of jihad takeover to use radical Islam to conquer the Middle
[23:10.320 --> 23:14.600]  East with the West backing it is it a triple cross I mean I talked with some
[23:14.600 --> 23:18.400]  of the smartest people to Pentagon off record they don't even know what's
[23:18.400 --> 23:22.760]  going on right now they believe that the globalists have lost control of the
[23:22.760 --> 23:26.960]  situation evidenced by Russia coming into the vacuum and kicking ISIS's
[23:26.960 --> 23:31.480]  butt in the last three months forcing ISIS now to lash out including with
[23:31.480 --> 23:42.240]  massive terror attacks in places like Lebanon and other areas well unfortunately
[23:42.240 --> 23:45.160]  I believe they have let's just stop for a moment I believe they have an internal
[23:45.160 --> 23:50.240]  mic open on the camera as well not just the line-in mic so when you do some data
[23:50.240 --> 23:55.640]  testing right there and ascertain what's happening with those systems and then we
[23:55.640 --> 24:01.040]  will attempt to go back to Paul Joseph Watson there on the ground in Paris
[24:01.040 --> 24:04.880]  France again even most national TV in the United States doesn't have reporters
[24:04.880 --> 24:08.880]  there on the ground we're doing this but we're out there in the cold in the
[24:08.880 --> 24:15.480]  high wind working on the systems and we will check those systems and go over
[24:15.480 --> 24:20.720]  those systems and see exactly what happens and come back to Paul Watson in
[24:20.720 --> 24:25.600]  the next segment let me now here just a moment get one of the big blaring is
[24:25.600 --> 24:30.960]  issues here and that's Donald Trump Donald Trump has done it again saying
[24:30.960 --> 24:33.840]  common sense statements that get him demonized he said that there have been
[24:33.840 --> 24:40.080]  more guns and not such draconian gun control laws in Paris basically total
[24:40.080 --> 24:44.200]  gunman that citizens would have had concealed carry and fought back that's
[24:44.200 --> 24:48.520]  what we saw has happened at other events here in the United States and it was the
[24:48.520 --> 24:55.960]  Interpol chief in 2013 Interpol chief army citizens they says armed citizens
[24:55.960 --> 25:00.680]  globally to prevent terrorist attacks I had a Freudian slip of an army of
[25:00.680 --> 25:05.240]  citizens Interpol chief armed citizens globally to prevent terror attacks
[25:05.240 --> 25:12.720]  Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble told ABC News that one of the only ways
[25:12.720 --> 25:16.720]  to prevent terrorists from hitting soft targets like shopping malls in Kenya was
[25:16.720 --> 25:21.120]  to armed citizens globally noting that the Westgate mall siege would have been
[25:21.120 --> 25:26.520]  averted far quicker if it had taken place in a gun friendly area like Denver or
[25:26.520 --> 25:31.720]  Texas noble statements are a powerful rebuttal to the anti-gun lobby so let's
[25:31.720 --> 25:39.320]  not forget that from 2013 and we do have the Donald Trump clip here's Donald
[25:39.320 --> 25:43.440]  Trump saying the same thing as the Interpol head but being criticized as
[25:43.440 --> 25:48.480]  being ignorant for saying it even though all the facts point towards it you don't
[25:48.480 --> 25:51.680]  see mass shootings happening or folks getting away with it when Switzerland do
[25:51.680 --> 25:55.680]  you the only European country to have similar gun ownership to the United
[25:55.680 --> 26:00.200]  States here it is when you look at Paris you know the toughest gun laws in the
[26:00.200 --> 26:09.040]  world Paris nobody had guns but the bad guys nobody nobody had guns and they
[26:09.040 --> 26:15.120]  were just shooting them one by one and then they broke in and had a big shoot
[26:15.120 --> 26:23.760]  out and ultimately killed the terrorists and I'll tell you what you can say what
[26:23.760 --> 26:29.640]  you want but if they had guns if our people had guns if they were allowed to
[26:29.640 --> 26:35.520]  carry now that for those of us that are informed that's just common sense but
[26:35.520 --> 26:40.680]  that is so revolutionary it would have been a much much different situation I
[26:40.680 --> 26:44.520]  hear it all the time you know you you look at certain cities that have the
[26:44.520 --> 26:49.680]  highest violence the highest the highest problem with guns and shootings and
[26:49.680 --> 26:56.280]  killings Chicago as an example toughest gun laws in the United States nothing
[26:56.280 --> 27:01.840]  but problems so there's Donald Trump ladies and gentlemen we're gonna come
[27:01.840 --> 27:04.800]  back from break here and try to reconnect with our crew on the ground in
[27:04.800 --> 27:09.240]  Paris France they haven't gotten a lot of sleep obviously it is a somewhat
[27:09.240 --> 27:12.360]  dangerous situation with the terrorists saying they're going to launch more
[27:12.360 --> 27:17.320]  attacks inside the country and against other Western countries but the real
[27:17.320 --> 27:21.200]  danger is not standing up to this so I want to salute our reporters who are
[27:21.200 --> 27:25.440]  there on the ground and I also want to salute all of you out there that spread
[27:25.440 --> 27:29.320]  the word about this broadcast that support our sponsors and info wars.com
[27:29.320 --> 27:35.440]  and that by the products at m4store.com and m4life.com you are right
[27:35.440 --> 27:38.800]  beside us in this fight I want to go back to Paul Watson we're going to break
[27:38.800 --> 27:41.480]  in a minute we're going to come back and let him finish but he had some Skype
[27:41.480 --> 27:45.920]  problems they're gonna be also filing more reports the next few days they're
[27:45.920 --> 27:49.040]  on the ground talking to folks on the street looking at the censorship but
[27:49.040 --> 27:52.960]  coming back Paul what are the points you're gonna get into just the fact
[27:52.960 --> 27:57.440]  that this attack has not changed the narrative on admitting the refugees in
[27:57.440 --> 28:01.200]  fact the president of the EU Commission Karl Junker has come out today and said
[28:01.200 --> 28:05.560]  that this won't change the policy we've got Hillary Clinton saying they're
[28:05.560 --> 28:09.120]  going to allow more Syrian refugees into America we've got Obama promising at
[28:09.120 --> 28:13.640]  least a hundred thousand initially and again most of them aren't Syrian
[28:13.640 --> 28:17.960]  refugees only one fifth are we've got the Calais migrant camps which are mostly
[28:17.960 --> 28:21.880]  North Africans of course we've got threats coming from there so even though
[28:21.880 --> 28:24.480]  this has happened you would think it would reverse that narrative they're
[28:24.480 --> 28:29.520]  doubling down on the insanity despite all these social problems in Germany which
[28:29.520 --> 28:35.040]  we've touched on previously and you've talked about the motive for all of this
[28:35.040 --> 28:38.600]  when we come back I want to get into it what the census on the street they've
[28:38.600 --> 28:43.800]  had cars backfired and then hundreds run panicking and fear they've shut down
[28:43.800 --> 28:49.560]  most the major tourists destinations and more Paul Joseph Watson with a

[33:48.200 --> 33:55.560]  have been financing and radicalizing Islamic countries since the 40s you look
[33:55.560 --> 34:00.480]  that up that's even the Washington Post and they're not bringing in women and
[34:00.480 --> 34:07.080]  children that are real refugees they're bringing in military aged men and I love
[34:07.080 --> 34:10.000]  how the crew every time I just make a statement they just Google it pull up the
[34:10.000 --> 34:14.400]  article so we can prove what I'm saying Daily Mail four out of five migrants are
[34:14.400 --> 34:19.960]  not from Syria EU figures expose the lie that the majority of refugees are
[34:19.960 --> 34:23.960]  fleeing war zone and that's even accepting the fake passports and they
[34:23.960 --> 34:30.240]  admit almost 80% of those are fake and again right at 80% or military aged men
[34:30.240 --> 34:35.440]  you look at the videos you look at the photos there's almost no children in
[34:35.440 --> 34:43.640]  any of these it's men it's men and they're carjacking robbing taking over I
[34:43.640 --> 34:50.880]  mean by the millions and then chanting they're gonna blow everything up I mean
[34:50.880 --> 34:57.520]  this is crazy this is this is like the invasions the Islamic invasions that
[34:57.520 --> 35:00.680]  triggered the crusades and is that what's happening is the West trying to
[35:00.680 --> 35:06.640]  trigger the is the government trying to trigger a move so we'll back new crusades
[35:06.640 --> 35:11.720]  but but not to go fix the Middle East not to free the Middle East but to bring
[35:11.720 --> 35:14.360]  it back to the Stone Age and actually then just kind of put these people in
[35:14.360 --> 35:19.440]  charge or are the globalist double-crossing us and are they going to
[35:19.440 --> 35:23.200]  have their radical Islamics be our new bosses in the politically correct world
[35:23.200 --> 35:28.120]  because they say we have to comply with it not it with our freedom Paul Watson
[35:28.120 --> 35:31.760]  there's a manhunt for the eighth Paris suspect underway obviously across Europe
[35:31.760 --> 35:37.000]  investigation widens to nearby countries the president wants a three month
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.120]  state of emergency announced two weeks ago he was gonna shut down the borders
[35:40.120 --> 35:44.760]  for the world government summit coming the biggest world government summit
[35:44.760 --> 35:48.960]  ever bringing global taxes the Pope's calling for it big things are happening
[35:48.960 --> 35:53.240]  Paul I know we don't like to speculate but we know the West has been hijacked
[35:53.240 --> 35:59.200]  open the borders the head of the UN migrant group the former head of the EU
[35:59.200 --> 36:03.800]  Peter Sutherland says get rid of Europe sovereignty admits it's a plan they
[36:03.800 --> 36:07.440]  advertise the freebies they caused the flood they knew the attacks would come
[36:07.440 --> 36:12.560]  what is their end game in this because Paul Watson if they get caught running
[36:12.560 --> 36:15.920]  this which they have been caught then they're all gonna end up getting in
[36:15.920 --> 36:20.520]  trouble or politically destroyed or are they so confident in geopolitical
[36:20.520 --> 36:25.680]  illiteracy that as France has announced they want to take out a sod now saying
[36:25.680 --> 36:29.320]  the fact that he's weak allows ISIS to have a safe area when our own
[36:29.320 --> 36:33.840]  governments funded ISIS that caused the failure of Syria I mean is this the
[36:33.840 --> 36:38.400]  triumph of ignorance is this the inversion of reality Paul you're a smart
[36:38.400 --> 36:43.080]  guy where do you see all this going go ahead I think what's going on Alex is
[36:43.080 --> 36:48.080]  they're more terrified of this conservative you know genuine legitimate
[36:48.080 --> 36:51.360]  conservative wave sweeping Europe which has been happening for the past two
[36:51.360 --> 36:55.720]  years or so they're more terrified of that having an authentic government that
[36:55.720 --> 36:59.840]  actually represents people's desires a kind of populist government not just in
[36:59.840 --> 37:03.040]  Paris but in all these different countries they're more afraid of that
[37:03.040 --> 37:07.280]  than having these jihadists running around everywhere killing everyone
[37:07.280 --> 37:11.080]  because here in France in two months I believe they've got these regional
[37:11.080 --> 37:16.920]  elections where Marine Le Pen of course has garnered such political capital out
[37:16.920 --> 37:20.400]  this because she's a French Ron Paul and again you hit the nail exactly on the
[37:20.400 --> 37:24.400]  head they even admit that flood everything with friends of the socialists
[37:24.400 --> 37:29.320]  that are on the payroll with welfare so many as a political checkmate not to
[37:29.320 --> 37:34.000]  just out vote but burn down every city and hold Europe hostage the left
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.360]  controls these terrorists go ahead trust in Alex because the biggest book in
[37:39.360 --> 37:43.280]  France this year was a book called submission by Michel Welben who is
[37:43.280 --> 37:47.320]  basically France's most famous author and in that book which was written before
[37:47.320 --> 37:51.400]  Charlie Hebdo he predicted that there would be these Islamist attacks in
[37:51.400 --> 37:56.320]  France which would lead to France having a runoff in the election in 2022
[37:56.320 --> 38:00.400]  between Marine Le Pen and this Islamist party which was seen as more
[38:00.400 --> 38:04.960]  moderate and able to control the jihadists so it's strange that fiction
[38:04.960 --> 38:10.240]  parallels reality because that seems to be the case of course 2017 is the next
[38:10.240 --> 38:15.520]  French election everybody's quite confident that Marine Le Pen will win
[38:15.520 --> 38:19.920]  the first round and then they're gonna bring in Sarkozy and these other
[38:19.920 --> 38:24.360]  neocons to try and battle it out with her in the second round and knock her out
[38:24.360 --> 38:29.280]  because they're terrified again that Marine Le Pen will become the leader of
[38:29.280 --> 38:33.240]  France and I think they're they're more terrified of that than the situation
[38:33.240 --> 38:37.440]  that we had a couple of days ago but even so you know Alain came out and said
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.800]  this is an act of war that's the most aggressive rhetoric that he's come out
[38:41.800 --> 38:45.960]  with but again it's not about boots on the ground in Syria it's not about
[38:45.960 --> 38:49.480]  attacking them in Syria it's about stopping them from getting here in the
[38:49.480 --> 38:53.440]  first place and of course we know several of them were French citizens
[38:53.440 --> 38:57.160]  Belgian citizens they were already here and some of the other and the police
[38:57.160 --> 39:00.520]  knew who they were and were ordered to stand down it is incredible they let one
[39:00.520 --> 39:05.280]  of them go yeah so so it's key I agree with your analysis in fact it's not even
[39:05.280 --> 39:08.280]  our opinion it's a fact they open the borders they advertised they brought them
[39:08.280 --> 39:12.120]  in they protected them they ordered the police to stand down they have allowed
[39:12.120 --> 39:15.480]  them to attack now they'll say let's bring in a moderate Muslim party to
[39:15.480 --> 39:18.560]  control it you've got all the socialist parties as you've written about
[39:18.560 --> 39:22.680]  extensively from Sweden to France saying we should get rid of Christianity we
[39:22.680 --> 39:27.960]  should adopt Islam so the socialist hate Christianity in the West they're such
[39:27.960 --> 39:34.080]  self-haters that they want to suicide the West and adopt socialist Islam and
[39:34.080 --> 39:38.440]  there's there's no great revolt against that here in France there is more so in
[39:38.440 --> 39:41.760]  Germany but I'll give you an example here's an article out of Tourette's today
[39:41.760 --> 39:47.400]  it's in Paris neighborhood heavily hit by terrorists residents view attackers as
[39:47.400 --> 39:52.280]  victims this is out of Tourette's today and I basically talk about well that's
[39:52.280 --> 39:56.080]  stupid but they aren't evil that's what Madonna's saying that's what Madonna's
[39:56.080 --> 40:00.440]  saying yeah these liberals in these areas that were hit by the attacks blame
[40:00.440 --> 40:04.600]  themselves for the attacks and say they're just misunderstood they blame
[40:04.600 --> 40:08.360]  society for not integrating these people they don't blame the fact that
[40:08.360 --> 40:12.400]  they're evil jihadists who are this violence is based in their religion
[40:12.400 --> 40:17.120]  which they didn't criticize because it's not politically correct so that's what
[40:17.120 --> 40:20.160]  France is like I mean France has I don't want to be mean in this time of
[40:20.160 --> 40:25.920]  crisis but Francis cornered a reputation over the past 60 70 years for
[40:25.920 --> 40:29.720]  being very weak for one specific reason during the Second World War and it
[40:29.720 --> 40:33.200]  seems like that's continuing today because in Germany we're seeing this
[40:33.200 --> 40:37.400]  kind of uprising they're openly talking about toppling Merkel we're seeing these
[40:37.400 --> 40:42.360]  demonstrations grow greater and greater but here in France it you know the
[40:42.360 --> 40:46.120]  streets are basically deserted I was in London late last night just getting back
[40:46.120 --> 40:50.240]  it was still bustling even though there was a huge storm you know everyone was
[40:50.240 --> 40:55.360]  in the cafes the restaurants busy here it's it's a ghost town basically tonight
[40:55.360 --> 41:00.280]  and you know that goes somewhat to the character of French and that book
[41:00.280 --> 41:05.560]  submission by Michel Welbeck is I think going to turn out to be very prophetic
[41:05.560 --> 41:10.240]  in the future political course that's right well it's as you said a month ago
[41:10.240 --> 41:14.080]  near this is a mass cuckolding and that's again where a man lets another man
[41:14.080 --> 41:17.440]  basically slap him around and then have sex with his wife in front of him this
[41:17.440 --> 41:23.120]  is a religion is being dominated being overrun destroying what your forebears
[41:23.120 --> 41:29.920]  built committing suicide culturally is the religious holy sacrament of the left
[41:29.920 --> 41:35.760]  because they're not the left they are a group of mentally ill people and they
[41:35.760 --> 41:39.400]  they hate anyone that cares about them they hate anyone that genuinely wants
[41:39.400 --> 41:42.880]  to help them they hate anyone that wants to build and give them something strong
[41:42.880 --> 41:48.120]  they get off on destroying everything good and they love misery they love
[41:48.120 --> 41:51.480]  ugliness and there's been mainline articles written about this that the
[41:51.480 --> 41:57.800]  left loves everyone poor starvation ugliness this is who they are yeah and
[41:57.800 --> 42:01.640]  again it goes back to this tipping point France has the highest population of
[42:01.640 --> 42:06.760]  Muslims out the whole of Europe it's about 7% of the population and they've
[42:06.760 --> 42:11.040]  done studies which show that if you get 6% of the population that Muslims a lot
[42:11.040 --> 42:16.880]  of whom aren't integrated social upheaval civil unrest begins to occur and
[42:16.880 --> 42:20.480]  that was happening 10 years ago in Paris and that's because the West though
[42:20.480 --> 42:25.440]  previously wasn't like that the West is so submissive and won't have a brown
[42:25.440 --> 42:29.080]  bag in case it makes someone upset or won't say mother or father that when
[42:29.080 --> 42:32.680]  people show up that say whatever they want or they want the West kneels and
[42:32.680 --> 42:37.800]  bows and then splits its own throat and and and this is totally pathetic Paul

[47:13.880 --> 47:21.280]  eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man Thomas
[47:21.280 --> 47:29.880]  Jefferson it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network so just to be clear
[47:29.880 --> 47:35.280]  France is saying and has been saying that Islamic State is able to be in Syria
[47:35.280 --> 47:39.720]  and have the country cut in two not because France and the West openly
[47:39.720 --> 47:45.160]  funded ISIS in al Qaeda and al-Nusra same group the last four or five years as the
[47:45.160 --> 47:51.760]  quote rebels but because Assad hasn't been removed and so now that France is
[47:51.760 --> 47:54.440]  saying we want to send ground troops there that stories up on info wars
[47:54.440 --> 48:01.640]  dot-com here's another one with video of John Kerry Secretary of State videos
[48:01.640 --> 48:06.120]  post at the tower website it's also in info wars dot-com carry Assad cut his
[48:06.120 --> 48:11.200]  own deal with ISIS that's their response to Bashir al Assad saying France is
[48:11.200 --> 48:15.880]  backing ISIS and now it's turned against them he's goes on to say no Assad's
[48:15.880 --> 48:21.200]  really running ISIS now I mean folks al Qaeda launched two chemical attacks what
[48:21.200 --> 48:26.040]  two and a half three years ago on Syria and then blamed it on Syria but when
[48:26.040 --> 48:29.440]  they tested the nerve gas it was from Saudi Arabia I mean it was admittedly a
[48:29.440 --> 48:33.800]  false flag now has the West really turned against ISIS and are they really
[48:33.800 --> 48:38.840]  bombing them now because they're uncontrollable maybe I don't know we know
[48:38.840 --> 48:43.600]  the Russians are are they're really good rebels yeah we're told there's five of
[48:43.600 --> 48:46.760]  them I'm not joking five of them hundreds of thousands of al Qaeda and
[48:46.760 --> 48:51.360]  ISIS but five good rebels now the plan was always to destabilize the area are
[48:51.360 --> 48:54.440]  they now turning against ISIS because they're not playing ball and really
[48:54.440 --> 48:58.920]  bombing them so ISIS is now hitting the West we're gonna get Paul Watson's taking
[48:58.920 --> 49:02.960]  the next hour but I want to talk to Joe Biggs who had slept in about 40
[49:02.960 --> 49:08.200]  something hours who got into France today flew out day and a half ago out of
[49:08.200 --> 49:12.560]  Boston got into London got into France today and he's there to get his take as
[49:12.560 --> 49:17.520]  a military veteran Purple Heart recipient blown up multiple times in
[49:17.520 --> 49:21.480]  armored vehicles and hit by shrapnel in Afghanistan and Iraq fighting al Qaeda
[49:21.480 --> 49:25.880]  the Connie network other jihad groups we're not you know they're like the
[49:25.880 --> 49:29.800]  mainstream media just calling give up all your rights more TSA but leave our
[49:29.800 --> 49:33.720]  borders wide open we're there really exposing what's happening you've been
[49:33.720 --> 49:38.720]  on the ground you've been analyzing it what what what blares it me Joe is that
[49:38.720 --> 49:42.760]  the borders are open to Europe they're flooding these people in al Qaeda said
[49:42.760 --> 49:46.800]  they were sending in military age men ISIS said the same thing to attack on
[49:46.800 --> 49:51.760]  record they attack and the answer in France is arrest anybody that
[49:51.760 --> 49:56.480]  criticizes radical Islam and Merkel's having people's kids taken in Germany if
[49:56.480 --> 50:01.520]  they criticize radical Islam how will they get away with this Joe Biggs I
[50:01.520 --> 50:07.400]  mean this is so crazy and now they want to attack Assad who's fighting ISIS
[50:07.400 --> 50:12.400]  thinking the public so dumb that will think he's behind it like attacking
[50:12.400 --> 50:18.160]  Saddam for what Saudi Arabia did bare minimum 9-11 or is this a false flag did
[50:18.160 --> 50:22.760]  the West some were saying stage this as a pretext to go in and attack Assad now
[50:22.760 --> 50:27.480]  I don't know because they weren't ready in the first few hours with a script it
[50:27.480 --> 50:31.560]  doesn't look staged to me now I may be wrong if we learn there's a drill or
[50:31.560 --> 50:35.640]  something else then it has the telltale signs but not everything is an inside
[50:35.640 --> 50:41.400]  job but it's still a false flag by extension because the West opened the
[50:41.400 --> 50:46.440]  borders and funded these groups so that's a fact our criminal governments are the
[50:46.440 --> 50:53.160]  main authors they're the mommy and daddy of this but their baby did it either way
[50:53.160 --> 50:57.720]  Joe Biggs we again don't script this we're gonna get his take from his
[50:57.720 --> 51:01.440]  perspective former Staff Sergeant US Army Joe Biggs what do you think's
[51:01.440 --> 51:05.520]  happening yeah honestly Alex I don't think this is a false flag attack
[51:05.520 --> 51:09.120]  whatsoever because guess what the elite want they want wide open borders they
[51:09.120 --> 51:12.040]  want that to happen they want the refugees to come in they want these
[51:12.040 --> 51:15.720]  attacks to happen if this was a false flag attack they wouldn't do something
[51:15.720 --> 51:19.160]  like that because what's it gonna be the direct reaction of government when
[51:19.160 --> 51:22.560]  something like this happens close down the borders like France said they shut
[51:22.560 --> 51:25.720]  everything down so I don't think it's a false flag in that sense whatsoever I
[51:25.720 --> 51:29.680]  think this is a legitimate attack I think this is a group of individuals who
[51:29.680 --> 51:33.720]  we've said before have gotten out of control now this is what they want they
[51:33.720 --> 51:38.640]  want a global domination they want people to be scared they want people to
[51:38.640 --> 51:42.720]  feel like they need more government to take over they want to they want to take
[51:42.720 --> 51:46.520]  people's liberties and freedoms away and go what hey we've got this we're in
[51:46.520 --> 51:51.160]  control you guys will be safe knowing that we can take power of this and
[51:51.160 --> 51:54.160]  that's what they want to do that's the entire point and then when people go
[51:54.160 --> 51:57.400]  along with it they need these attacks to happen because then people are more
[51:57.400 --> 52:00.400]  willing to give up their liberties their rights their freedoms just like we
[52:00.400 --> 52:04.440]  saw with 9-11 with all that stuff so that's the entire in-game I think they
[52:04.440 --> 52:09.320]  wanted they want the entire world to be in fear non-stop and that's why they're
[52:09.320 --> 52:13.040]  allowing this kind of stuff to happen so they can do that I agree George Soros is
[52:13.040 --> 52:16.800]  in the news today bragging that he helped create the migrant crisis in his own
[52:16.800 --> 52:21.080]  words he went on CNN admitted he helped overthrow the elected government of
[52:21.080 --> 52:26.240]  Ukraine and now Peter Sutherland is bragging saying yes we will get rid of
[52:26.240 --> 52:30.680]  Europeans white faces of the problem that's a quote who are these crazy
[52:30.680 --> 52:35.440]  people a crazy weirdo Nazi collaborator from World War two is bringing in
[52:35.440 --> 52:39.520]  radical Muslims to destroy Europe I mean how do these crooks sit there with
[52:39.520 --> 52:44.720]  straight faces and brag about their evil I mean it's amazing today there have
[52:44.720 --> 52:48.680]  been protests you know lashing out all over France where they were calling them
[52:48.680 --> 52:54.120]  far-right extremists because these people didn't want refugees coming in and
[52:54.120 --> 52:57.800]  this happening you know we've been saying this for months and months on end
[52:57.800 --> 53:02.280]  that they would use this crisis to bring in these jihadis these terrorists
[53:02.280 --> 53:07.040]  through these borders that are wide open and use them to do these attacks and they
[53:07.040 --> 53:10.760]  hate the West so much they can't even wait till there's 20 million jihadis
[53:10.760 --> 53:14.280]  they just have to start killing right away well people don't even know this
[53:14.280 --> 53:19.000]  today but 13 Syrian refugees were brought into New Orleans today you can
[53:19.000 --> 53:23.520]  go to a local New Orleans papers and find that 13 now out of that how many of
[53:23.520 --> 53:26.800]  those guys are vetted I mean you don't know who's being vetted because there's
[53:26.800 --> 53:30.600]  nothing out there there's no check and balance as to what's going on they're
[53:30.600 --> 53:33.320]  just letting people in and then saying you know we'll deal with it later sure
[53:33.320 --> 53:37.800]  that's WVUE and that's how it starts in Europe 13 20 a hundred five hundred ten
[53:37.800 --> 53:40.920]  thousand a hundred thousand two million five million that's how they do it that's
[53:40.920 --> 53:45.320]  WVUE television New Orleans Louisiana Syrian refugees beginning arriving in
[53:45.320 --> 53:49.600]  New Orleans and again a lot of these are real refugees about 25 percent the
[53:49.600 --> 53:53.480]  government admits that our real women and children that our policies help do
[53:53.480 --> 53:57.600]  this but see how the globalists want to destroy everybody I mean these are the
[53:57.600 --> 54:01.600]  jihadis our criminal government help bring into Syria that our own military
[54:01.600 --> 54:05.400]  Joe as you know two years ago said we're not gonna fight on the side of al-Qaeda
[54:05.400 --> 54:10.880]  this is crazy what what do you think the in-game is and what's the sense I mean
[54:10.880 --> 54:14.720]  I'm told it's a ghost town in Paris I'm told they hear a car backfire everyone
[54:14.720 --> 54:18.440]  runs panicking in fear oh well exactly that's what I was gonna get to now
[54:18.440 --> 54:22.720]  earlier tonight there was a lot of people out at the memorial of the attacks
[54:22.720 --> 54:26.640]  that happened on Friday the 13th you know just a few days ago when you know
[54:26.640 --> 54:31.120]  135 people were murdered and over 350 people wounded and there were people
[54:31.120 --> 54:35.040]  after visiting that memorial laying down candles going out and sitting pictures
[54:35.040 --> 54:39.920]  out and just kind of going over and talking to each other praying and all
[54:39.920 --> 54:42.960]  that and some guy wanted to come out and he starts throwing fireworks out and
[54:42.960 --> 54:46.960]  everyone thinks his gunshots and you can see videos from the BBC I think for
[54:46.960 --> 54:49.880]  people are screaming and running because they they thought they were being
[54:49.880 --> 54:53.360]  attacked against now we know more it's fireworks they first thought it was a
[54:53.360 --> 54:56.480]  backfire sounds like you did that on purpose that's that's that's that's
[54:56.480 --> 55:01.360]  criminal yes exactly that is and CNN won't even report the truth you know we
[55:01.360 --> 55:04.880]  got that from here on the ground what's going on those are fireworks that were
[55:04.880 --> 55:08.360]  set off like little little kinds that you like and have like the little red
[55:08.360 --> 55:13.160]  ones on it sure so pop off people do and that's discussing but that's what they
[55:13.160 --> 55:17.600]  want though they want everyone in the world to be in fear that is the end
[55:17.600 --> 55:21.800]  game so people give up their liberties their rights their freedoms so they
[55:21.800 --> 55:25.320]  feel like they need a bigger government to take control you know it's it's
[55:25.320 --> 55:29.440]  amazing you know in America people take the Second Amendment for granted so much
[55:29.440 --> 55:33.760]  and it's quite sickening because we need that you know when ISIS showed up in
[55:33.760 --> 55:37.800]  garland Texas what happened they got shot down literally you know just imagine
[55:37.800 --> 55:42.120]  how the outcome would be right now if people here had that ability not
[55:42.120 --> 55:45.720]  everybody in France agrees with the Second Amendment but those who do should
[55:45.720 --> 55:49.720]  have that right you know when you have the right to carry doesn't mean that
[55:49.720 --> 55:54.160]  everyone has to but if you feel like you should if you feel that you need that
[55:54.160 --> 55:58.560]  protection that's a route that you can go and that's something that everybody in
[55:58.560 --> 56:02.880]  the world should have that safety net you know imagine if those people in that
[56:02.880 --> 56:07.920]  theater could have had someone there that was armed and that's exactly what
[56:07.920 --> 56:11.360]  that's exactly what Donald Trump said I'm gonna come back cover more news with

[59:50.920 --> 59:56.320]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:05.920]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:12.600]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.640]  well throughout this week Paul Joseph Watson Joe Biggs and Michael Zimmerman
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:27.320]  info wars.com reporters will be in Paris and not just covering the terror attacks
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.400]  with the ongoing refugee camps getting burned other shootings other stabbings
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.440]  other burnings that are happening but are getting glossed over and the big
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:39.840]  world government UN summit the biggest ever it's being built to openly announce
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.160]  world government I was already secretly I'd announced it yet probably planning
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:49.040]  myself to go to Paris I like to send out my reporters they do a great job so they
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.160]  can get the glory it's not about the glory but so it's all about Alex Jones
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:58.800]  just they in some ways are better than I am of different perspectives but I was
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.680]  clearly gonna send some reporters there but they're already there to cover this
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:09.840]  coming up it is a big deal now let's go ahead and go in fact Al Gore was there at
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:16.240]  the Eiffel Tower when the attack took place putting on a 24-hour broadcast
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.320]  about how we'd all die we didn't pay him money Joe Biggs is with us for this
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.640]  segment part of the next and Paul Watson comes back and I'm gonna try to give him
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.280]  the floor to break down other angles of what he sees happening here but Joe I
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:32.080]  just keep going back to this it is so epic over the top ridiculous to be
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:37.800]  politically informed and to see these Western governments open the borders
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.600]  bring people in everybody warns they're gonna attack Al Qaeda ISIS says they're
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:46.560]  gonna attack they're mainly military H-man they got fake passports here's
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:50.040]  the Guardian the crew brought it in because it sounds crazy US has trained
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.960]  only four or five Syrian fighters against ISIS top general testifies in
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:58.400]  Congress sounds crazy if you're a new listener and I go there's a hundred to
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:04.080]  200,000 Al Qaeda Al Qaeda and those are ISIS people in Syria and Iraq but our
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.120]  government's trained five good ones and then it's actually four or five I'm sorry
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:12.800]  it's less than I said see that sounds like pure bull when I say they've trained
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:18.280]  five and then they say over for the good rebels our government's funding the
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.080]  radicals let me ask you this show we're gonna go to break and come back to you
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:25.520]  this short segment don't they know this is the issue that finally woke up the
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:32.120]  military that our government runs Al Qaeda I mean but they don't care I mean
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:36.360]  Soros comes out and brags I'm getting rid of Europe I caused the migrant crisis
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.000]  huh I mean it's like they're villains out of a cartoon Joe Biggs how do they
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.880]  think they're gonna get away with this let me get understand Alex people are
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:50.160]  starting to definitely wake up to what's going on I mean for example Friday night
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.600]  after the attack happened what happened Trump's numbers surged a 40 I believe
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.040]  43 45% they search he went from you went from like 26 to something like that
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:03.040]  because he's the only person out there effectively talking about trying to close
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.680]  down the border and do something no one else is out there Hillary Clinton Bernie
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.040]  Sanders all these guys want to leave a wide open and let everyone run in this
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:16.080]  was an example of what happens when you leave your borders wide open and the
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.120]  people the military are awake to that stuff they see what happens behind that
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.520]  curtain but most people don't see the doesn't get put on TV most of things that
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:28.000]  happen overseas in combat don't have huge exposure like what happens here in
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.640]  Paris and when you have something like this put into a large spotlight when
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:36.160]  people actually see the running the fear the bodies being dragged out of theaters
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:42.280]  people hanging from windows the terror the horrific scenes of violence people
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.320]  start to re-question what they've been thinking that's why his numbers are
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.400]  surging now because he's the only person out there with an effective plan and the
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:54.600]  only person who says he will do something about the border sure the sad
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.200]  thing is there's so many countries out there Alex who are just going to ignore
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:03.400]  that fact this is how many attacks this year alone in France the third one I
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:08.280]  believe the first one Charlie the third way this one this one was at least 10 or
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:14.520]  15 attacks six in Paris this is the third wave I mean it's ridiculous how many of
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.480]  these things have to happen before people start to use a little bit of common
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:22.080]  sense and go hey maybe we should look at what we're doing wrong maybe we should
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.520]  close these borders down maybe we should bet these people a little bit more I
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:31.320]  agree don't do that people lose their lives especially in these gun-free zones
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.080]  because we've said time and time again gun-free zones or kill zones and let's
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:39.440]  not forget Obama the day it happened hours before it happened job eggs shed
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:44.680]  ISIS is contained in Iraq and in Syria and then now look at this and of course
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:48.040]  they shot down or blew up we're not sure which one they took credit for taking
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.920]  down the Russian airliner but but oh everything's fine everything's
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.280]  wonderful what is the end game crisis because they're gonna put a police

[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:11.320]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:36.160]  our reporters are live Paul Joseph Watson and former Army Staff Sergeant Joe
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:42.320]  Biggs along with Michael Zimmerman bravely there with the deserted Paris most
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.240]  the flights were canceled that's why we couldn't even fly out the day it
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.600]  happened or the next morning we had to fly out in the evening Saturday they
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:52.760]  did because almost all the flights were canceled out of England in the United
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.800]  States to get into France because everyone was basically saying they were
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:01.640]  too scared to go meanwhile we have these clips that we're going to be going
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:06.800]  over the first clip is Obama I was confusing Nicola in the break saying
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.080]  we're gonna go back to Trump I meant Obama Obama coming out the day it
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:19.680]  happened hours before last Friday Friday the 13th and saying that we had ISIS
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:27.080]  contained then we have been roads coming out of spokesman for the wine house
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:32.280]  saying Obama still planning on taking refugees so let's go ahead and go to the
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:37.480]  clip because it's hard to believe of Obama saying ISIS is contained when his
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.280]  own government helped fund it and created we have the former head of
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.600]  defense intelligence going public two months ago and saying when he was in
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.960]  there they were ordered to do this this is on record now claiming that the group
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:51.640]  they helped create and fund and that WikiLeaks is exposing as the West
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.680]  funding claiming that actually they were contained and then hours later
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:00.280]  hundreds dead in Paris here it is ISIS is creating strength aren't they well
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:04.120]  I don't think they're gaining strength what is true is is that from the start
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:08.640]  our goal has been first to contain and we have contained them they have not
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:16.800]  gained ground and not Iraq and in Syria it they'll come in the leave but you
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:22.760]  don't see this systematic march by ISIL across the terrain what we have not yet
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:29.320]  been able to do is to completely decapitate their command and control
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:35.200]  structures we've made some progress in trying to reduce the flow of foreign
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:39.200]  fighters and part of our goal has to be to recruit more effective Sunni
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:44.960]  partners in Iraq to really go on offense rather than simply engage in defense
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.640]  what do you think when you hear someone like Ben Carson get up a debate and say
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:51.400]  hey this would be easy we can take ISIL out just by bombing their oil fields
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:56.760]  you're on by that's what general told him yeah what I think is that he doesn't
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:02.920]  know much about it and look George I think it's fair to say that all right
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.640]  that's enough I wanted to hear the full clip in context they don't fully
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.320]  control ISIS Saudi Arabia stirs them up funds them turns them loose is all on
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:16.760]  record they just keep the public ignorant never talk about real facts then
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:22.240]  they send them in in mass promising them all Syria when they don't get it in a
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.920]  couple years they get mad invade Iraq wanting their new homeland and then they
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.000]  say we got a deal with Turkey you just go through to Europe you can go to Europe
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.560]  get free welfare and so that was their veterans deal here a veteran gets you
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:40.440]  know VA benefits supposedly the GI Bill here you get to go to Germany and get
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:47.280]  welfare isn't that just special and then here's Ben Rhodes the spokesman for the
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.960]  White House saying Obama still planning on taking refugees we'll go back to Joe
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:57.000]  Biggs in Paris we consider his plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees over the
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:06.200]  next year no Chris we're still planning to take in Syrian refugees we have very
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:11.100]  robust vetting procedures all men it involves our intelligence
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:15.360]  management terrorism center extensive interviews vetting them against all the
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.280]  available information and what we need to be able to do frankly it's sort out
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:23.200]  all men fighter flow those people who've gone into Syria one one okay that's
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:27.000]  finally tax or those people who've had connections with ISIL and stop right
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.640]  there and this is also the cover because the West help recruit all these groups
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.240]  in the US England Europe the cover for their own operatives to come back in
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.760]  because even the FBI wants to arrest them but then they use the State
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.040]  Department to bring them in as refugees to circumvent the no-fly list so I'm
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.040]  giving you the deep intel on how this works Joe Biggs we see the escalation
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.960]  of the attacks the more refugees the more attacks they're not going to be able
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.000]  to cover up the attacks on military bases in Fort Hood and Army recruiting
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.160]  Marine Corps and centers they're not gonna be able to cover this up forever
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:02.680]  where do you expect all this to go and other points they're gonna come back
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:07.560]  with more from Paul Watson I think it's laughable that President Obama would
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.840]  come out and say that ISIS is contained I mean that's equivalent to George W.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:16.200]  Bush's mission accomplished I mean it's completely ridiculous they make these
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:21.720]  comments without any facts whatsoever I mean what has Obama done to stop ISIS
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:27.800]  nothing but he has done every single thing in his power to arm those terrorists
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.640]  he's done everything to cover for him he has done everything to allow them to
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.720]  grow he has kept our military from doing what is capable of doing we could have
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:41.920]  destroyed ISIS over a year ago when they're all convoying into Iraq with
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.040]  successive bracketing we could have taken them out in minutes instead we allow
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:50.520]  them to grow and we keep accidentally dropping these ammunitions off these
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.360]  bombs these weapons and allow them to do it and yet they come out and they
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:58.960]  actually do what they're supposed to do they go out and they kill a whole bunch
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:02.920]  of innocent people and yet what are we gonna do Obama still calls for open
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:07.840]  borders Hillary Clinton still calls for open borders nothing will be done it is
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:12.520]  completely and totally disgusting that they could sit here and look into that
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:16.440]  video camera and talk to the people of the world and say I'm not literally gonna
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:21.000]  do a damn thing about it my agenda is to leave this border open and I don't care
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.440]  what happens Joe we've got another clip I want you to hear I don't know if you've
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:30.360]  heard this yet you're on a plane Hillary Clinton and all the Democratic
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:35.040]  candidates in the in the Democrat debate refuse to use the word radical Islam
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.400]  they won't even do that but they'll demonize gun owners and call us
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:45.480]  terrorists all day long here's that clip Joe Biggs radical jihadists yes Marco
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:49.480]  Rubio also running for president said that this attack showed in the attack
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:53.520]  in Paris showed that we are at war with radical Islam do you agree with that
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.480]  characterization radical Islam I don't think we're at war with Islam I don't
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.640]  think we're at war with all Muslims I think we're at war with jihadists who
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.840]  have just to interrupt he's he's they all Muslims he just said radical Islam is
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:11.520]  that a phrase you know I think that you can you can talk about Islamists who
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:17.440]  clearly are also jihadists but I think it's it's not particularly helpful to
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.080]  make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with that we've
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.520]  got to reach out to Muslim countries we've got to have them be part of our
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:30.880]  coalition if they hear people running for president who basically short cut it
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.080]  to say we are somehow against Islam that was one of the real contributions
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:40.640]  despite all the other problems that George W. Bush made after 9-11 when he
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:45.360]  basically said after going to a mosque in Washington we are not at war with
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:52.800]  Islam or no here's reality you're at war with non radical Islam the truth is
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.520]  you're trying to exterminate it and the secular countries you're
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:59.800]  overthrowing every one of them and you're putting the radical jihadis in
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.920]  run by Saudi Arabia to keep those folks in the dark age and the truth is that
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.640]  Saudi Arabia was involved in the attacks our government stood down that's been
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:14.360]  basically declassified now it's been admitted to the 28 pages and you attacked
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:18.680]  Iraq that had nothing to do with it truly sickening Joe Biggs final points
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:21.440]  that we're coming back to Paul Watson you're gonna be there all week with us

[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.560]  wide open there was a terrorist attack we know that we have too many sick
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:43.840]  demented left-wing liberals crazy nutjobs look at the University of
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:50.160]  Missouri for example the students there have started the hashtag F Paris why
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:57.400]  because they feel like the spotlight's been taking off of them these are the
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.600]  kind of crazy people Alex who are coming up and they're eventually gonna
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.600]  take leadership positions in it and around the country these are people who
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:09.520]  when journalists came out there to cover the story they assaulted them they
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.240]  pushed them and they told them to get out of there because that was their safe
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.840]  place they're scum they go and they they're racially divided and have black
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.480]  only meetings and segregate the entire thing meanwhile and they start you know
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:25.360]  complaining saying that you know why has the media completely ignored us you
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:29.960]  know what's happening is Paris is just as equally and as important as what is

[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:39.120]  cartoon that my buddy Rob do send me from the amazing patriot actually
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:45.560]  syndicated cartoonist editorial cartoonist ben garrison it says attack
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:52.200]  of the crybullies and shows a bunch of giant 50-foot babies stomping around
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:56.520]  attacking people of political correctness and burning up curriculum
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:01.280]  burning books and that's exactly what's happening I just heard Joe big say
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:05.320]  this from Paris and I was talking to the crew I said I hadn't heard that yet I
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:08.640]  saw the daily caller on drudge report dot com with liberal activist upset
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:15.000]  Paris terror attacks are getting attention not me zoo protest and then
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.240]  get Daniels runs in he goes no it hasn't broken yet but it's one of the top
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:21.360]  Twitter hashtags we're writing an article right now so we'll be breaking at
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:26.520]  info wars dot com the next 30 minutes F Paris and it's getting thousands of
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:31.240]  tweets from me zoo this isn't a joke saying we want the attention F the white
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:36.840]  French basically so this is just the total mental illness of the left and
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:43.360]  how anything seemed at its core is anti-white or Western what it is but it's
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:47.000]  all run by globalists it's just there's crew and everybody over the Middle East
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.080]  Latin America Africa everybody's getting screwed here but they sold global
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:55.960]  carbon taxes is increasing taxes on white people turned out it's basically
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:01.400]  double on Africa and stuff you know they just play us off against each other
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:06.840]  Paul I cannot believe that the actual Black Lives Matter me zoo people from
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:11.040]  their official Twitter accounts are saying F Paris now because it's not
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:14.160]  giving them attention and because I guess they have solidarity with the G
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:18.280]  Hotties are these people completely mentally ill do they not know that the
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:21.720]  radical Wahhabist think blacks aren't humans basically and in Libby are
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:26.520]  killing every black they can find Paul Watson well it's fascinating Alex because
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:31.080]  in the very minutes after the Paris terror attack broke on Friday you had
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:35.680]  these me zoo people on Twitter coming out and saying hey how dare you even start
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:39.880]  because of those the top Twitter trends were completely monopolized by Paris
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:43.920]  obviously in the hours afterwards they were absolutely furious because of
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:48.440]  us it was bad day it was the million student March even though they've been
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:51.800]  completely debunked in the days leading up to that but they were absolutely
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:56.120]  furious I mean I've just tweeted that it's no surprise that Black Lives Matter
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:02.280]  radicals are tweeting F Paris because their ideological inspiration is a
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:07.440]  terrorist of the FBI's most wanted domestic terrorist list a convicted
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:11.880]  cop killer so it's no surprise that they're going for that and again you had
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:16.320]  Amherst University on Friday this got a clip by what happened in Paris but the
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:20.360]  students there came out they had a sit-in they demanded that the president
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:27.640]  acquiesce to this huge list of demands one of which was to not tolerate and to
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:33.000]  punish people who express free speech those were though their words not mine
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:39.040]  free I know spoiled rotten brats who's one the leaders dad makes a point two
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:43.360]  million worshipping terrorists running around bitching I mean these people are
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:50.560]  a joke and then CNN and ABC News and MSNBC bowed down to them and they're
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:55.400]  looking at firing the professors at Yale that said don't ban costume parties I
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:00.560]  mean these are freaks well yeah that's how it started at Yale of course but
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:04.040]  yeah they actually came out because there were people holding up signs which
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:09.320]  said free speech this Amherst University they weren't happy with that they put
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:13.880]  out this huge list of demands not just that basically calling for complete
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:19.280]  intolerance for any free speech again their words not mine demanded that the
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:24.000]  president acquiesce to these demands within 48 hours or they would stage
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.440]  quote civil disobedience so that was all going down on Friday of course he had
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:33.800]  the nationwide protests over absolutely nothing and then immediately and again
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:37.680]  right now it's trending on Twitter I mean I retweeted some of them they're
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:42.080]  coming out and saying how dare you compare what happened in Paris with the
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:47.400]  terrorism that's happening in American colleges every day again somebody shout
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:52.080]  at the end word out of a pickup truck a few weeks ago somebody drew a poop
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.360]  swastika on a bathroom wall they're actually equating that to Paris and
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:00.560]  saying basically whining about the fact that it took them out of the headlines
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:04.400]  it's totally sick with the threats Paul I'm gonna go to break here in a moment
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:10.200]  877-789-2539 specifically on the terror attacks your take your view especially
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:17.800]  if you're in Europe or a family over there 877-789-2539 877-789 Alex

[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:33.640]  topic and this is specifically on this the next two segments Paul you've got
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:38.400]  the floor for the last four minutes other angles to this it's just wild to
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:43.640]  see Merkel saying tolerance to open the borders more than arresting people that
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:48.840]  criticize open borders Syrian refugees arriving here Madonna saying we haven't
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:52.200]  been loving enough to the jihadis they'd rape her and kill her in minutes if
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:56.040]  they got their hands on her what is wrong with these people crapping all
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:00.560]  over the Western culture that gave them the freedom they've they've they're
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:06.280]  living off of well it's quite bizarre Alex a lot of them don't really know how
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:10.720]  to respond because I was again in London late last night in Trafalgar Square
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:14.960]  where they had a huge vigil because they lit up the buildings in the French flag
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:18.560]  they've been doing a similar thing around the world the World Trade Center the
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:23.320]  new World Trade Center is lit up in the French as a show of solidarity you know
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:29.280]  that's quite a nice gesture but how about we have a show of solidarity we've
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.600]  lost your audio again Paul I'm gonna have to come back to you after the break I
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:36.200]  believe we're having a disconnect where the internal mic on the camera is

[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:24.720]  it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex jones everyone
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:29.960]  knows there's been a long-term listener that I am not in Islam a folk there's
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:32.520]  been a lot of great culture a lot of amazing things come out of the Middle
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:37.040]  East Muhammad Mosaddegh was trained in the West he was pro-america but he
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:41.080]  wanted our Iranians to have the Persians to have their own oil money so they
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:45.800]  overthrew him and use radical jihadists to do it and they set up Saddam Hussein
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.640]  and I'm not saying he's perfect but compared to these guys he was a good
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:53.080]  guy Muammar Gaddafi helped stabilize Africa they set him up removed him
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:57.360]  Egypt they tried to remove them and put in radicals they wanted to stabilize the
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:00.480]  area and they want to take our jobs and make us poor and stupid too the
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:05.040]  globalist or parasites above nation states but they are radicalizing Islam
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.880]  and bringing folks in and allowing this to happen and then I'm not attacking the
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:15.200]  folks that did it attacking whoever their enemy is Saudi Arabia is involved
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:22.480]  in 9-11 attack Iraq Saudi Arabia and its people are involved in this attack they
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:26.240]  want to take out Assad and that's because of political ignorance in the
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:30.000]  public they can get away with that and that's what they're announcing right now
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.960]  it's unprecedented and it's because politicians aren't held accountable for
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:39.280]  stuff like this happening that they get more power when there's an attack now
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:44.160]  well there's gonna be more attacks then now I don't know if this was a false
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:48.560]  flag or not in the classical sense that really Muslims didn't do this but we
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:52.760]  know radical Muslims do stuff like this and it if you look at the larger issue
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:57.200]  the false flag is bringing them in to allow it to happen and I've got Hamza
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:01.960]  Tamir William Scott Steven Alex Josh all of you your calls are coming up here in
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:05.920]  a few minutes at the end of this segment the next but we've got calls from
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:11.040]  Montreal's calls from Syria calls from you name it we're going to your phone
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:17.360]  calls Australia this is a global program but finishing up with Paul Watson you
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.720]  got cut off by audio problems finish your points and I want to I've got one
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:24.040]  more question for Joe Biggs as you were there in front of the Eiffel Tower that
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:28.920]  they've now announced Associated Press is closed indefinitely in fact here in
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:34.600]  this AFP Eiffel Tower closed indefinitely after Paris attacks well
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:37.040]  there's always terrorists are always going to be able to attack different
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:42.520]  things you can't just close them to be safe this is giving in to the fear but
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:45.160]  now Rob Lowe is being criticized for saying they should control their
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:49.360]  borders I mean this is how politically correct we are Paul Watson final points
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:53.680]  well I mean the Eiffel Tower might be closed and you can't go up here but you
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:57.480]  can walk right there are no barricades or anything you can walk right under it
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:02.360]  so I don't see much sense in closing if you're a G-Hadis who wants to do damage
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:06.600]  then nobody's stopping anybody from walking right up to it and then again
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:11.020]  just on this whole virtue signaling thing you know after Charlie Hebdo the
[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:14.840]  G-Hadis were emboldened because you had people like the Pope coming out and
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:19.400]  saying that you know insulting someone is wrong and it's offensive and that's not
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:23.680]  part of free speech that's what the Pope said he basically sided with the G-Hadis
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:28.520]  Charlie Hebdo themselves after a certain amount of time said they would stop
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:33.160]  publishing Muhammad cartels they had this huge fate marked with all the world
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:38.240]  leaders just be charled that completely evaporated we went back to this thing
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:44.600]  about you know Islamophobia remind people that Islam is not a race you've
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:47.720]  got Muslims from all over the world North Africa the Middle East you've got
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:54.240]  white Muslims you've got Chinese Muslim East Asia weep exactly so Islam is not
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:59.160]  a race so to criticize it is not racist and again going back to first let's be
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:04.520]  clear Islam kills itself a Shiite Sunni and all the other subgroups more than
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:08.560]  any other group I mean people say oh Islam is perfect don't criticize it the
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:12.560]  main two groups are constantly killing each other and I'm not siding with the
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:16.400]  Shiites but they seem to be the ones that don't go around stirring up all the
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:21.800]  trouble it is the dominant Sunni group Saudi Arabian controlled that is running
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:25.480]  around bullying everybody including Sunnis that that want to have a decent
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:31.160]  life yeah then you know domestically you've got these progressives who are
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:35.080]  just so terrified of being politically correct I told the story on your show
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:39.360]  my girlfriend's dad a couple of months ago when the whole refugee story was
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:44.960]  unfolding sat them all down and said we're gonna take in two Syrian refugee
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:51.120]  families into our tiny two office-based bedrooms in this small house in London no
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:55.960]  plan to actually do it whatsoever it was virtue sigmo and so a lot of people
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:00.240]  like that and now in fact her dad is threatening to kick her out of the house
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:05.000]  because she said that Marine Le Pen being president wasn't as terrifying a
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.360]  scenario as G had his running around France killing everybody
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:12.960]  exactly I mean to quantify this all we hear all we hear on the news is oh we're
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.400]  gonna cover your Twitter support for the victims how about support shutting the
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:20.000]  borders how about support shipping out the jihadis how about support not
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.240]  supporting al-Qaeda or ISIS see how about being informed means you help people
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:28.840]  not just sending out a tweet sorry Paul exactly and then you know you've got the
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:32.760]  flip side you've got Fox News saying oh this must mean we need more American
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:36.600]  boots on the ground in Syria what the hell is American boots on the ground in
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:41.160]  Syria going to do about people who are already here already citizens already
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:45.840]  radicalized because of Saudi Arabia exporting this extreme Wahhabism and
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:51.880]  now building 200 just for starters 200 new mosques in Germany that's how they're
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:57.040]  gonna help us right refugee crisis Paul I'm gonna shift gears now into a final
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:02.440]  comments from Joe Biggs we're gonna go to phone calls here but briefly did you
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:07.840]  have any trouble getting into France no trouble whatsoever it was it was quite
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:12.160]  quiet the flight was delayed a little bit but it was fine all right thank you
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:15.880]  let's pass the microphone great job you might want to go down tomorrow today and
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:19.000]  show they claim they've closed the Eiffel Tower you can still walk right
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.720]  underneath it it's like saying you know airport security a bomber which is blow
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:26.320]  up the TSA line that's where everybody's concentrated there's no stopping
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:31.160]  terrorism there's just not giving into it then they have no reason to do it but
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:34.760]  just simply amazing but I would go down and point that out as well Joe did you
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:38.000]  have any trouble because Paul's parents live in France they have a little hotel
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.240]  there that you know they're British but there's no jobs in England so he
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:46.520]  obviously can get in easier did you have any trouble getting in negative Alex had
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:51.040]  no trouble getting in but I did get looked at very strange you by everyone
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:55.080]  everyone going why would you go there why would you do this but you want to
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:59.040]  know what we do have an attack going on it's free speech what happened a free
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:03.520]  speech Alex what happened to journalists being able to go out and tell
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:08.080]  stories and tell the truth and tell people what's really going on now it's
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:13.500]  free comma speech we have to fight for our freedom of speech we need to free
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:17.760]  speech because journals don't have that ability anymore people are scared to
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:20.320]  cover what's going on with black lives matters because they're afraid they're
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:25.760]  gonna be attacked by those people and then they wonder why they get no spotlight
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:31.240]  it's good to be attacked by a bunch of scum people people want to know why that
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:34.080]  people are scared to even say anything about the migrants now because you've
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.920]  got Merkel and Zuckerberg sitting there snickering back and forth saying all
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:40.240]  right yeah if someone gets on Facebook we're gonna censor those people that's
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:43.400]  what the attacks happening right now Alex it's not with all this other stuff
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:47.040]  with the actual attacks it's our attack on free speech because free speech used
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.640]  to be that free speech now it's free comma speech we have to go back we have
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:57.240]  to take that so it is free again people shouldn't be scared to be able to go out
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:00.520]  and do that but you see so many journalists now that are horrified to go
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:04.440]  out and tell the truth because of the backlash or the fact that they're gonna
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:07.040]  be censored or the fact that the government's going to attack them and
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:11.920]  say no or go attack your Facebook page or your YouTube page it is ridiculous the
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:16.160]  fact that people can't go out you actually tell what is going on that is
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:20.520]  the atrocity here's what's crazy lost the globe you become a hero when you fight
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:25.000]  this tyranny the scum attacking you has no power until they finally take over
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.760]  like Germany where they arrest you for criticizing radical Islam or socialism
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:33.120]  that's why now in the US they want to arrest you for criticizing man-made
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:37.880]  climate change these tyrants can't beat us in the info war in the fight of
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:42.920]  information in the open market of ideas so they want to shut us down the answer
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:46.680]  to their tyranny and bullying is to stand up to them hey you guys can go hit the
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:50.680]  set get a great dinner if you want if you want to keep reporting do whatever
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:53.960]  job we need to work on that might connection the rest of it that's been

[01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:17.640]  lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:20.600]  is it a false flag? One way or another it
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.460]  is we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow
[01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:28.060]  the United States government. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:31.060]  World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:34.060]  Do you still think that Jeff Hewlett brought down the World Trade Center?
[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:39.060]  Does anybody else see a problem?
[01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:40.060]  The story doesn't add up.
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:42.060]  If the government has nothing to hide,
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:45.060]  why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:48.060]  This story does not add up.
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:52.060]  Ministry bringing us in.
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:54.060]  Yes, criminal, globalist organizations,
[01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:56.060]  stage false flags,
[01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:58.060]  private corporate groups do it to push governments,
[01:47:58.060 --> 01:48:00.060]  like the inspector movie shows,
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:02.060]  into doing it.
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:05.060]  But the false flag is radicalizing Islam,
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:07.060]  protecting and opening the borders and bringing them in.
[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:09.060]  That's going to happen to begin with.
[01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:11.060]  So it is a false flag regardless.
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:13.060]  I see these calls most of them are saying,
[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:15.060]  hey, we think it's totally staged.
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:17.060]  But they want the open borders.
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:18.060]  They want to bring the folks in.
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:21.060]  If that's true, they think we're so dumb
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:23.060]  that they'll have the attacks, take our rights,
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:25.060]  but still keep the borders open.
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:26.060]  Maybe you're right.
[01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:28.060]  Maybe it could be staged completely.
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:30.060]  Anything's possible nowadays.
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:32.060]  Scott, in California, go ahead.
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:34.060]  You're on the air.
[01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:36.060]  I don't think it was completely,
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:38.060]  I don't think it was completely staged,
[01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:41.060]  but I just came across an article in the Times of Israel.
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:45.060]  The headline is Jewish owners recently sold
[01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:49.060]  Paris' Bataclan Theater where I.S. killed dozens.
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:53.060]  And it talks about how this Israeli owner
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:55.060]  owned that theater for 40 years
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:58.060]  and sold it on September 11th, 2015
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:01.060]  because of the spread of ISIS that was
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:03.060]  directed against that theater.
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:05.060]  So that might be something.
[01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:06.060]  Sure.
[01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:07.060]  I mean, if you're getting threatened,
[01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:08.060]  you're going to sell it.
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:09.060]  And why would he openly say,
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:10.060]  I sold it because of threats
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:11.060]  if they were somehow involved?
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:12.060]  I don't think it's like Silverstein
[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:16.060]  owning the towers and getting double insurance a week before.
[01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:17.060]  No, I would agree.
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:20.060]  It's not a smoking gun of anything,
[01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:22.060]  but it's something to look at and consider
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:25.060]  if there were threats on this theater.
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:26.060]  Oh, we know there were threats.
[01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:28.060]  We know the cops had arrested some of these people
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:29.060]  in order to stand down.
[01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:31.060]  So I think there clearly is prior knowledge.
[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:34.060]  What about the CIA director there that day
[01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:37.060]  meeting with the head of French intelligence on 7-7?
[01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:40.060]  The CIA head was meeting with MI6,
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:43.060]  a block from the first bombing.
[01:49:43.060 --> 01:49:46.060]  It all smells like somebody knew something at the top.
[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:49.060]  And probably at their minimum allowed it to happen.
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:50.060]  I agree with you.
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:51.060]  I agree.
[01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:52.060]  We'll call up.
[01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:53.060]  We find out there's a drill.
[01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:54.060]  It's a done deal.
[01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:56.060]  Steven Orange County, you're on the air.
[01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:57.060]  Go ahead.
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:50:00.060]  Thanks for receiving my call.
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:02.060]  The last call I just stole my thunder.
[01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:06.060]  Actually, I was calling on the ownership of the Vatican,
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:10.060]  the concert hall itself,
[01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:14.060]  and that they had pro-Israeli events that were held there
[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:18.060]  and also Israeli border police events that were held there.
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:21.060]  The main thing about it was is that I looked into
[01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:24.060]  the equals of death metal group last night.
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:26.060]  I was thinking, you know, who's this band?
[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:27.060]  I want to check it out.
[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:29.060]  And I went to the Wikipedia site.
[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:33.060]  And the last paragraph from the Wikipedia site stated
[01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:36.060]  the ownership of the Vatican was owned and da-da-da-da
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:39.060]  by, you know, a Jewish ownership
[01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:42.060]  and that they used to hold these pro-Israeli events
[01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:44.060]  and had all these threatening going on.
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:45.060]  So I took a picture of it
[01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:47.060]  because I wanted to show my friend this morning.
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:50.060]  Come back home because he wants me to send you the link
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:52.060]  and actually be erased it from WikiLeaks.
[01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:53.060]  Well, do me a favor.
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:55.060]  We'll investigate that send it to us.
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:58.060]  And I'm not saying Israel hadn't staged false flags before.
[01:50:58.060 --> 01:50:59.060]  At the same time, though,
[01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:03.060]  if a Jewish-owned thing gets targeted,
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:05.060]  that's what the Z-Hotties would target.
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:06.060]  That's what the Middle East does.
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:08.060]  Everybody stabs each other in the back.
[01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:10.060]  It's hard to figure out what's going on.
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:11.060]  We're going to continue.
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:15.060]  That's why we got four people on the ground in Paris
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:17.060]  to cover this because, obviously,
[01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:19.060]  this is the beginning of a lot more.
[01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:21.060]  ISIS has been carrying out the threats.
[01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:22.060]  They say they will.
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:24.060]  And all I know is our government's funded these people
[01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:27.060]  and are bringing them in and Obama's bringing them in.
[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:29.060]  And so when they attack, it's their fault.
[01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:32.060]  I don't care if they totally ran it or opened the door for it.
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:33.060]  They're to blame.
[01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:34.060]  That's the big issue.
[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:35.060]  And we got to get that out.
[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:37.060]  But great point.
[01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:39.060]  William and Montreal, Canada,
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:40.060]  thank you for calling in today.
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:41.060]  You're on the air.
[01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:42.060]  Hello, Alex.
[01:51:42.060 --> 01:51:44.060]  It's an honor, a long time first time.
[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:46.060]  I've been following you since Ruby Ridge.
[01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:49.060]  Well, anyways, so two weeks ago,
[01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:52.060]  there was a terrorist simulation in Montreal down my street.
[01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:53.060]  Kind of odd.
[01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:57.060]  It's pretty close to last Friday's massacre.
[01:51:57.060 --> 01:52:01.060]  I just want to point out, wouldn't the NSA have tabs
[01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:02.060]  on all these conversations?
[01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:05.060]  I hope they have the certificates for the SSL communications
[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:06.060]  with Google.
[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:07.060]  I meant to make that point.
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:09.060]  The more NSA spying, we get everything tracked.
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:13.060]  The more terror Al Qaeda went 15 years ago from 1,000
[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:16.060]  to about a couple hundred thousand under the name ISIS.
[01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:19.060]  I mean, boy, the more money we spend to take our liberties away,
[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:23.060]  the worse it gets because that's who's really gaining
[01:52:23.060 --> 01:52:25.060]  is the military industrial complex.
[01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:26.060]  Exactly.
[01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:30.060]  And you know, there's none of this, oh, they encrypted the messages
[01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:31.060]  and they can't read it.
[01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:32.060]  They have access to all the certificates.
[01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:34.060]  They just go to the, I'm a programmer.
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:36.060]  They just go to Verifine or one of these certificate authorities.
[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:38.060]  They say, hey, we're the FBI.
[01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:39.060]  We're the CIA.
[01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:44.060]  One CIA connected Silicon Valley company ended up was running
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:47.060]  40 plus ISIS sites, almost all of them.
[01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:50.060]  Folks, we tweet anti-ISIS stuff and they shut us down
[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:52.060]  on Facebook claiming we're promoting ISIS.
[01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:55.060]  But then they let real ISIS promote itself.
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:57.060]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[01:52:57.060 --> 01:52:58.060]  Anyways, that's all I have to say.
[01:52:58.060 --> 01:52:59.060]  I'm really proud of you, Alex.
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:01.060]  I've seen you growing over the years and just amazing work.
[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:03.060]  William, thank you for putting up with me.
[01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:04.060]  I still interrupt.
[01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:05.060]  I still chomp at the bit because I'm real.
[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:06.060]  I'm like a dog chasing a rabbit.
[01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:08.060]  I get upset and thank you.
[01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:10.060]  Hamza is a Syrian.
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:11.060]  He says he lives in Missouri.
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:13.060]  What is your view on this?
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:16.060]  Yeah, I guess I'm going to have to be the stick in the mud here.
[01:53:16.060 --> 01:53:17.060]  It's unfortunate.
[01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:18.060]  This happened.
[01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:21.060]  Let me just preface my comments by saying it's absolutely horrible,
[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.060]  terrible what happened there.
[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:24.060]  Innocent people getting killed, but you know what?
[01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:26.060]  I'm a Syrian born here in America.
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:27.060]  As you can tell, I have no accent.
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:28.060]  I was born here.
[01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:29.060]  My dad's over there.
[01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:33.060]  He escaped over here because he wanted to escape the bath party.
[01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:34.060]  And you know what, everybody?
[01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:37.060]  We've been having this style event going on in our country
[01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:39.060]  for the past 10 years.
[01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:42.060]  And every time we've tried to have a secular Arab nationalist leader,
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:44.060]  let's go all the way back to Sadat.
[01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:47.060]  And like what you said earlier, most of the deck,
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:50.060]  the other Abdul Nasir, every time we have one of these guys
[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:52.060]  that wants to take us out of the freaking Stone Age,
[01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:53.060]  what happens?
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:54.060]  He catches a bullet.
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:56.060]  And I'm sick and tired of everybody.
[01:53:56.060 --> 01:53:58.060]  And I know it's easy to say, okay, you know,
[01:53:58.060 --> 01:53:59.060]  let's blame all these refugees.
[01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:00.060]  They're all coming in.
[01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:02.060]  I tell you what, Alex, I got to pull in my backyard.
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:05.060]  I could pop a hole in it and all the water will fall out that hole.
[01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:07.060]  And I guarantee you, I'll tell you where that water's going to flow.
[01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:09.060]  You destabilize the whole region.
[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:10.060]  You open the door.
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:11.060]  I want to be clear.
[01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:14.060]  I totally agree that the Middle East would be a paradise
[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:17.060]  if the West wasn't in there putting radicals in.
[01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:18.060]  I agree.
[01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:19.060]  But the threat's real.
[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:22.060]  But the real enemy is the George Soros' helping fund it.
[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:24.060]  I mean, it's so evil.
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:25.060]  Absolutely.
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:26.060]  And I would 100% agree with that.
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:27.060]  In fact, I'm a longtime listener.
[01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:30.060]  And the only way me and my wife have never been able to get
[01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:33.060]  any real information on the whole Syrian conflict is through your show.
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:35.060]  So we're big time fans.
[01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:40.060]  And the last thing I want to say is that the refugees coming in,
[01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:42.060]  you know, everyone goes, oh, they're all military age men.
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:44.060]  You know why they're all military age men?
[01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:47.060]  Because those are the people they're going to be drafted by the government
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:50.060]  or drafted by the ISIS people to go fight in a war between them.
[01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:51.060]  That's a good point.
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:53.060]  A lot of them are men running from real stuff.
[01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:56.060]  I totally hear you and we need to humanize these people.
[01:54:56.060 --> 01:55:00.060]  But we need to really humanize them by not letting the West destabilize them.
[01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:03.060]  And when I say the West, the criminals that want to break up our families,
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:04.060]  they want to take our property.
[01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:08.060]  The globalists are doing the same crap to everybody in different ways.
[01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:10.060]  It's world government is the enemy.
[01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:11.060]  Incredible calls today.
[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:13.060]  Can't wait till tomorrow to take your calls.
[01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:15.060]  Let's take some more.
[01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:17.060]  Let's just go to Tamir in New York.
[01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:19.060]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:20.060]  Hi, yes.
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:23.060]  I just wanted to say something to the guy that called before me,
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:29.060]  that ISIS itself admitted that thousands of these refugees are working for them.
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:33.060]  So, okay, not all of them, maybe 20 to 30 years old, and they're all bad.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:36.060]  But thousands of them are already admitted to work for them.
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:37.060]  That's first of all.
[01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:38.060]  That's right.
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:39.060]  I mean, they have said that.
[01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:41.060]  They said in February, we're going to flood you with 500,000.
[01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:43.060]  It's been way more than that.
[01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:44.060]  Exactly.
[01:55:44.060 --> 01:55:47.060]  And they keep finding these passports outside of these terrorist attacks.
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:51.060]  How do they find three different country passports outside of the attacks?
[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:53.060]  It's crazy.
[01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:56.060]  Well, we know on 9-11, they claim they found two that didn't burn.
[01:55:56.060 --> 01:55:59.060]  Pure bull, they were planted with these.
[01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:03.060]  You've got to have papers to get a hotel or do anything in Europe because of Interpol rules.
[01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:09.060]  And so they had fake passports, fake Syrian passports, and it's been confirmed by the French government
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:12.060]  and the Greek government that they indeed.
[01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:15.060]  This guy got saved out of the ocean.
[01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:17.060]  This guy got saved.
[01:56:17.060 --> 01:56:21.060]  This Ahmed al-Muhammad, and it's very, very sad.
[01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:22.060]  God bless you.
[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:23.060]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:24.060]  We're going fast through these calls.
[01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:30.060]  Let's talk now to Alex in New York and Mia if we have time in Kansas.
[01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:32.060]  Go ahead.
[01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:34.060]  Yeah, how are you doing?
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:36.060]  Good, my friend.
[01:56:36.060 --> 01:56:41.060]  I just want to let you know in Hancock, New York, they have a muslinbork.
[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:47.060]  It's exactly right by three big water reservoirs located in New York City.
[01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:52.060]  And nobody allowed this muslinbork and bunch of bunch of muslins over there.
[01:56:52.060 --> 01:57:01.060]  And my friend lived there and he told me he was living in every almost night hearing automatic shooting, AK shooting.
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:06.060]  I'm only picking up part of what you're saying, but yes, there are radical Islamic training camps all over the US.
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:07.060]  We've been to them.
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:08.060]  We've covered them.
[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:09.060]  They're real.
[01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:10.060]  The government allows them to operate and build.
[01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:11.060]  It's just crazy.
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:12.060]  I'm sorry to Mia.
[01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:13.060]  We're out of time.
[01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:19.060]  The one thing I forgot to cover, Serbia in the early 90s and again in 99, was invaded out of Albania.
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:20.060]  They brought in jihadis.
[01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:21.060]  They attacked them.
[01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:26.060]  They tried to fight this and they got bombed by the Clintons and by the UN.
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:29.060]  And a third of their country was taken and given to the jihadis.
[01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:34.060]  So the globalists are working with radical Islam to chop up the West.
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:36.060]  And it's, it's sick.
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:37.060]  It's very, very dangerous.
[01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:38.060]  It's unbelievable.
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:39.060]  Pray for our crew.
[01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:40.060]  Support us.
[01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:41.060]  Spread the word.
[01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:45.060]  We'll be back at 11 a.m. tomorrow with a big weekday show in full wars.com.
[01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:51.060]  That shows for the word.
