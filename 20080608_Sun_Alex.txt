[00:04.720 --> 00:10.080]  brace for more flooding. At least one person is drowned, another is missing, and in Chicago's
[00:10.080 --> 00:14.640]  southern suburbs residents are cleaning up from a series of tornadoes. The National Weather
[00:14.640 --> 00:19.360]  Service says more strong storms could hit northern Illinois later this afternoon. The
[00:19.360 --> 00:24.640]  national average price for unleaded gasoline has hit a new milestone, dropping the $4 a
[00:24.640 --> 00:29.120]  gallon mark. The highest average prices are in states like Alaska, California, Connecticut
[00:29.120 --> 00:34.080]  and Washington state. The lowest can be found in Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
[00:34.080 --> 00:40.000]  and Tennessee. A 5.0 aftershock has caused massive landslides in a mountainous region in China.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.320]  A strong earthquake in Greece has killed at least two people and injured dozens more.
[00:44.320 --> 00:50.080]  Reports have collapsed and severely damaged homes. Seismologists expect more aftershocks.

[01:54.080 --> 01:58.960]  President Bush is getting set to leave on a farewell tour of Europe. The trip starts with a
[01:58.960 --> 02:04.720]  U.S.-EU summit in Slovenia then takes the president to Paris, Rome, Berlin and London.
[02:04.720 --> 02:10.880]  It's likely the final European tour of his term and a key goal is rallying the allies to get Iran
[02:10.880 --> 02:18.320]  to halt its nuclear program. Iran is an existential threat to peace and it's very important for the
[02:18.320 --> 02:23.600]  world to take the Iranian threat seriously. Tehran continues to enrich uranium despite three rounds
[02:23.600 --> 02:29.520]  of U.N. sanctions, but Bush says he's committed to diplomatic efforts while not ruling out force
[02:29.520 --> 02:34.960]  as an option. Mark Smith at the White House. A powerful explosion is torn through a mine in
[02:34.960 --> 02:40.720]  eastern Ukraine, trapping some 37 miners thousands of feet underground. Voices of trapped miners
[02:40.720 --> 02:45.600]  could be heard as rescue efforts began. The workers had been trying to improve the mine's
[02:45.600 --> 03:11.600]  safety conditions. For the latest news and analysis, log on to irannews.com.
[03:24.080 --> 03:27.600]  A spacewalk today at the International Space Station has a two-man crew,
[03:27.600 --> 03:33.120]  tackles a sky-high list of fix-up tasks, the third and last of the mission.
[03:33.120 --> 03:37.920]  Additional information on a story we told you about yesterday. A group of European scuba divers who
[03:37.920 --> 03:42.720]  were swept away in strong currents who had scrambled on to a remote Indonesian island
[03:42.720 --> 03:48.640]  had yet to face another threat, a Komodo dragon. Those in the know say Komodo dragons often come
[03:48.640 --> 03:54.240]  out when they smell something new, including humans, who they've been known to kill. The divers
[03:54.240 --> 03:59.600]  were able to scare the giant man eating lizard off by throwing rocks and pieces of wood at it.
[03:59.600 --> 04:03.200]  After the ordeagle, they spent the night on an island before they were rescued.
[04:03.200 --> 04:08.880]  Well, the offer was rejected almost as quickly as it came and lettered to both candidates today,
[04:08.880 --> 04:13.680]  New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and ABC News offered to host the first presidential
[04:13.680 --> 04:17.760]  town hall meeting between John McCain and Barack Obama. Just last week,
[04:17.760 --> 04:21.520]  likely Republican nominee McCain asked his Democratic counterpart to join him in
[04:21.520 --> 04:26.640]  10 meetings in the coming months, and campaign managers for both McCain and Obama said they
[04:26.640 --> 04:32.080]  agree in spirit to some type of joint appearances. But both sides have rejected the offer from
[04:32.080 --> 04:37.280]  Bloomberg and ABC, saying they didn't want the broadcast limited to just one television network,
[04:37.280 --> 04:42.000]  but rather opened the wall. And first Lady Laura Bush is on a mission to Afghanistan.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.920]  The visit is in advance of this week's donors conference in Paris.
[04:45.920 --> 04:49.600]  Officials are hoping the world community will pledge aid to Afghanistan.
[04:49.600 --> 04:52.480]  I'm Pete LaValle, IRNUSA Radio News.
[04:55.280 --> 04:59.200]  Once America was led by real politicians, now politicians in the U.S.,
[04:59.200 --> 05:03.440]  city, county, state and federal are owned and controlled by corporations. We have corporate
[05:03.440 --> 05:07.200]  representatives instead of politicians. Criminal corporate manipulation has caused
[05:07.200 --> 05:11.360]  grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history. Shortages of rice, corn and wheat
[05:11.360 --> 05:16.160]  now exist in most countries. Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[05:16.160 --> 05:20.080]  Food riots and bread lines occur daily in 30 nations, and not only is that list growing,
[05:20.080 --> 05:24.000]  but it's headed this way. Survival enterprises are massive distributors of the highest quality,

[05:54.960 --> 06:08.080]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones
[06:08.080 --> 06:12.880]  on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[06:12.880 --> 06:23.280]  Well, I've done a lot of interviews with a lot of amazing people. But I have to tell you,
[06:23.280 --> 06:31.600]  this is the most excited I've ever been. To have a guest on, he put us with a full hour.
[06:31.600 --> 06:39.440]  He's in Tucson, Arizona. He just played the Super Bowl pregame last night. He is a global icon,
[06:39.440 --> 06:47.040]  an American institution. There's probably nothing more. Americana. They've had polls overseas
[06:47.040 --> 06:51.680]  of Europeans, Asians, others, and they say, you know, who's Americana? What symbolizes America
[06:51.680 --> 06:58.160]  in Texas? And it's Willie Nelson. But it's not just his music that I grew up listening to and that I
[06:58.160 --> 07:05.920]  love. It's not just the films he's been in. It's the work he's done for humanity. And it's his
[07:05.920 --> 07:10.240]  incredible spirit. You know, I had a chance to briefly meet him a few months ago here in Austin,
[07:10.240 --> 07:15.440]  where he lives. We're honored to have him hail from here. And I was just struck, and I said that on
[07:15.440 --> 07:24.640]  air, by the down to earth and really just the Obi-Wan Kenobi level zenness. It's not an act.
[07:24.640 --> 07:28.800]  He's an incredible person. I'm not going to gush. He doesn't like it. Willie Nelson,
[07:28.800 --> 07:32.880]  thank you for spending time with myself and the audience. Well, thank you, Alex. I'm not
[07:32.880 --> 07:39.040]  sure I was enjoying that introduction. Thank you. Well, you deserve, you deserve a bit of it, sir.
[07:40.720 --> 07:45.680]  I'm glad to be on your show. I'm a big fan and have been for years and I've watched your videos
[07:45.680 --> 07:51.120]  and listened to you on radio and I'm always checking in to see what you're doing and you're
[07:51.120 --> 07:57.120]  doing a great job. That's amazing. It humbles me. I better do a really good job of Willie Nelson's
[07:57.120 --> 08:04.000]  tuning in along with the Japanese parliament every day. Willie, this is a quick segment to come back
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.200]  in a long 20-minute segment, but I asked you before the interview, I said, what do you want to
[08:07.200 --> 08:12.400]  talk about? You said whatever you want to get into. Let's talk about some fun stuff first. Tell me
[08:12.400 --> 08:19.840]  about what the band's doing, your new song, Gravedigger. What's going on? Well, we have this
[08:19.840 --> 08:25.280]  new album that I just call Mom of the Forever and it's the song that Chris wrote and it's probably
[08:25.280 --> 08:31.360]  the greatest love song I've ever heard and then we got some couple of videos coming out of the
[08:31.360 --> 08:38.400]  album, The Gravedigger is one and then we did another video that's coming out in a couple of
[08:38.400 --> 08:45.840]  months. We did it down at my ranch there in Texas out there and there's a video with me and Jessica
[08:45.840 --> 08:52.720]  Simpson and Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson and all the Wilson boys and Ray Price and Johnny Bush
[08:52.720 --> 08:57.840]  and we just had a big crowd down there in town and we had a lawnmower race. I wish you'd have
[08:57.840 --> 09:03.120]  been there. You'd have had a lot of fun. I actually heard about it from Turk Pibkin and other people.
[09:06.400 --> 09:12.000]  But anyway, that's what we're into and we're out here doing a couple of songs off the album
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.680]  every night. You've got quite a few websites. What are some of the sites people can visit to see
[09:17.680 --> 09:23.360]  or let us know from? Well, there's a willynellson.com and my daughter does a
[09:25.120 --> 09:32.400]  you know, a column every day to tell everybody what we're into out here and there's the willynellsonpri.com
[09:32.400 --> 09:40.240]  which is a website set up. I did it originally to try to organize all the peace organizations in
[09:40.240 --> 09:46.880]  the world and we did a pretty good job of doing that I think because there's a whole lot of
[09:46.880 --> 09:51.840]  networking going on there about people talking about peace and then I wrote this song with
[09:51.840 --> 10:00.160]  my daughter Amy called Peaceful Solution and I put the song on the website and told people they could
[10:00.160 --> 10:05.200]  you know, record it, rewrite it or say it, put their band behind it. I just gave them a song
[10:05.200 --> 10:12.400]  basically and so far over a hundred people have recorded that song and videoed it. The
[10:12.400 --> 10:20.880]  University of Texas did two videos on it. Amazing. Go ahead willy. I would just say that you know,
[10:20.880 --> 10:26.400]  I'm just fooling around. Well, it's fantastic all of it. It seems like your music just gets
[10:26.400 --> 10:31.120]  better and better. You are a driven individual and that's what I want to ask when we get back.
[10:31.120 --> 10:36.000]  What drives willynellson? What does willynellson think is most important in this world? What is
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.520]  your philosophy summed up? I know your book that I read just last week, The Towel of Willey is amazing
[10:41.520 --> 10:46.080]  and I learned a lot from it. We'll talk about that. Biodiesel, Hemp, The Ward,
[10:47.280 --> 10:53.520]  Dennis Cassini, Ron Paul, it's all coming up with the legend, the icon, Willy Nelson.
[10:54.400 --> 11:00.080]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[11:00.080 --> 11:09.920]  He is counted among the top country legends, music legends, political activist legends,
[11:11.520 --> 11:21.360]  pretty much the icon of music. And he is quite a survivor. Willy Nelson, again,
[11:21.360 --> 11:26.800]  thank you for being with us. I wanted to throw out that question, I mean, about your life growing up.
[11:26.800 --> 11:33.600]  What made you the way you are? Why you've always stood up to the little guy, the farmers and people
[11:33.600 --> 11:40.480]  in Africa and just so many others? Why did you go in that direction in your life?
[11:42.160 --> 11:47.520]  Well, you know, I don't really know. Except the fact that I grew up in a town in Abbott,
[11:47.520 --> 11:54.160]  Texas, was a little small community farm town. I knew everybody in town. Everybody knew me
[11:54.160 --> 11:59.200]  at three or four churches there, four churches. So, in one way or another, you went to church every
[11:59.200 --> 12:06.880]  day and every night of your life. And I learned, if I learned anything, I learned that all those
[12:06.880 --> 12:13.040]  places, you know, sometimes the Baptist wouldn't talk to the Methodists or the Church of Christ,
[12:13.040 --> 12:18.400]  wouldn't talk to the Catholics. But they were all trying to do the same thing. And they were
[12:18.400 --> 12:24.800]  just divisions, even in that small town. But the one thing that I did learn now that it was the
[12:24.800 --> 12:30.240]  golden rule, you do unto others as you would have them do unto you. And that's maybe that,
[12:30.240 --> 12:36.480]  an amazing grace. I pulled out of Abbott, Texas, and I think those two things alone have been
[12:36.480 --> 12:46.000]  really good for me. When did you start your first band? I was about 10, let's see,
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.560]  you want to, before I got out of high school, I started a band with me and my sister and my
[12:50.560 --> 12:56.640]  brother-in-law and my football coach. And he played drum ball. And we had a little family
[12:56.640 --> 13:04.880]  band. We played all over Texas. We played in Waco and West and, you know, places that we could
[13:04.880 --> 13:12.560]  drive to with a trailer. Didn't you start out in radio by 16 or 17? You already had your own show?
[13:12.560 --> 13:19.840]  Yeah, I was with KHBR in Hillsborough. And we got our own radio show there every Saturday. And
[13:20.720 --> 13:27.600]  then after that, I went to the Air Force and then went down to Pleasanton, Texas, and went to work
[13:27.600 --> 13:33.520]  with KOB Pleasanton down there. And then I worked several other radio stations. And at the same
[13:33.520 --> 13:39.040]  time, playing bars around, trying to make it. It's amazing. Well, you certainly did make it a
[13:39.040 --> 13:45.920]  long career. You've been out, what, on the road and playing since, what, 54, 55 earlier?
[13:46.560 --> 13:54.320]  Yeah, at least at 49. When I got out of my high school, I was already in a band then.
[13:54.320 --> 14:02.800]  So 49. Shifting gears, again, we're talking to Willie Nelson. Willie,
[14:03.840 --> 14:07.920]  the war. I mean, you've been speaking out against it from the very start. And if you did that at
[14:07.920 --> 14:12.480]  the beginning, the media, the corporate media tried to punish people. They punished the Dixie
[14:12.480 --> 14:17.520]  chicks, but they kind of shied away from attacking you too much. They tried to make an example out
[14:17.520 --> 14:24.160]  of them. But I remember hearing you on the radio just saying, hey, I don't care what they do.
[14:25.280 --> 14:27.280]  I don't want a paraphrase. What did you do at the time?
[14:27.280 --> 14:38.000]  Well, first of all, it all happened. The Dixie chicks was overseas when they
[14:39.680 --> 14:44.400]  said what they said that seemed to have upset everybody. I was overseas too at the press
[14:44.400 --> 14:51.760]  conference. And I guess they headed in for the Dixie chicks more than they did me, I don't know,
[14:51.760 --> 14:55.120]  because they had every reason in the world to get on me also.
[14:55.120 --> 14:58.720]  They're afraid of you. They knew it wouldn't fly. Well, I don't know what they said. You know,
[14:58.720 --> 15:02.800]  what about this crazy cowboy from Texas you got running? I said, first of all,
[15:02.800 --> 15:06.880]  you're not a cowboy. Second of all, you're from Texas. So, you know, let's start there.
[15:11.360 --> 15:16.880]  And I mean, I make the point that they backed off from you because I don't think that they could
[15:17.840 --> 15:21.600]  chew up Willie Nelson. I think they tried to pick on the Dixie chicks, but it seemed that backfired
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.880]  on them. Well, it did. And it took a while and the chicks had to go through some uncomfortable
[15:26.880 --> 15:32.720]  times. But, you know, they're tough. And they came out on the other side of it, really looking
[15:32.720 --> 15:38.560]  great. And they're more popular now than they were then. And a lot of it's because of that.
[15:39.120 --> 15:43.920]  So, you know, I don't know whether they'd rather have done that way or not. But at least they said
[15:43.920 --> 15:48.080]  what they thought and they stuck with it. And I think their last record was, you know, we're not
[15:48.080 --> 15:56.240]  ready to make nice yet. Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in
[15:56.240 --> 16:02.480]  Internet history comes the long awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour
[16:02.480 --> 16:07.680]  film that completely destroys the official fable forever. Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a

[16:12.320 --> 16:17.280]  questions. And the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice. Loose

[16:54.720 --> 16:59.600]  triumph of reducing government debt. But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a
[16:59.600 --> 17:07.120]  record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57 percent annual increase
[17:07.120 --> 17:12.560]  outpacing its previous 10 years. The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through
[17:12.560 --> 17:17.200]  private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System. In the year 2000, debt growth
[17:17.200 --> 17:23.040]  collapsed to only 4.5 percent. It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to
[17:23.040 --> 17:27.680]  have commerce. However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out
[17:27.680 --> 17:33.040]  years of growth in a stock portfolio. Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold

[17:44.800 --> 17:55.120]  Call 1-800-686-2237, that's 1-800-686-2237. Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you
[17:55.120 --> 17:59.920]  about the high price of gasoline. It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're
[17:59.920 --> 18:04.640]  paying record prices at the pump. I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two
[18:04.640 --> 18:09.840]  products that improve gas mileage. Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your
[18:09.840 --> 18:15.360]  injection system, protect a complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95 percent of new engine
[18:15.360 --> 18:20.160]  condition, improving mileage in only one tank full. Protect an engine treatment not only reduces
[18:20.160 --> 18:25.280]  friction, but it extends the life of your engine. Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline,
[18:25.280 --> 18:30.800]  it's time to take action. Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive
[18:30.800 --> 18:37.760]  a free engine treatment, which is a $12.95 value free. Call 1-888-UseSFR1, that number again is
[18:37.760 --> 18:46.320]  1-888-UseSFR1 or check them out online at OilCompanySecret.com, that's OilCompanySecret.com.

[19:55.120 --> 20:00.000]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[20:06.080 --> 20:09.440]  Not ready to play nice. I'm ready to go along with this. I'm mad as hell
[20:09.440 --> 20:14.240]  and I'm just going to continue doing the right thing and that's why they're becoming
[20:14.240 --> 20:20.240]  even bigger icons. Willie, your take on the war. I mean, you were there from day one saying it was
[20:20.240 --> 20:27.600]  bad. Now 80% of Americans are saying it's a bad idea. We know we relied to about the WMDs.
[20:28.160 --> 20:32.560]  We know with the White House and Downing Street Memo that Bush tried to manufacture
[20:32.560 --> 20:38.240]  getting some of our aircraft shot down with Blair to start the war. Where's Willie Nelson now?
[20:38.240 --> 20:48.080]  Five years into this war and thousands and thousands of dead Americans, hundreds of thousands of
[20:48.080 --> 20:57.520]  dead Iraqis, you've been vindicated yet again. Well, it was always a bad idea. You just don't
[20:57.520 --> 21:06.240]  start wars. Again, it goes back to whatever I learned in Abba, Texas. You just don't kill people.
[21:06.240 --> 21:11.440]  There's something in the Bible that says they shall not kill and there's also a lot of things in
[21:11.440 --> 21:17.280]  there about peace on earth. I grew up believing that way and then all of a sudden I found out
[21:17.280 --> 21:22.800]  there are huge organizations out there that are starting wars and selling bullets to both sides
[21:22.800 --> 21:28.560]  and I said, what the hell is going on? What happened to peace on earth? Well, you brought up a key
[21:28.560 --> 21:33.680]  there. Can you elaborate on your take on the big organizations selling to both sides because
[21:33.680 --> 21:37.920]  that's the key here, the humanity, the humans, the children, the people that died that have
[21:37.920 --> 21:42.720]  their countries bombed out, the Americans that are taxed to pay for it all in the no-bid contracts.
[21:43.440 --> 21:49.360]  Humanity loses, but these kingpins, they win. Yeah, and they've been winning ever since,
[21:50.400 --> 21:57.200]  you know, in the old testament, they talk about war. There always be wars and rumors of wars,
[21:57.200 --> 22:01.840]  but in the new one, it says let's talk about peace and then there's going to be some peace.
[22:01.840 --> 22:06.320]  And I believe that there's, eventually, there's going to be peace on earth,
[22:06.320 --> 22:10.960]  and it shows other bastards that are getting in the way of it. So what do we do about them, Ali?
[22:12.880 --> 22:16.880]  Well, I have to say this. I do interviews every day on other people's talk shows,
[22:16.880 --> 22:22.080]  even confrontational interviews, adversarial interviews, and they'll take 10, 20 calls.
[22:22.640 --> 22:29.520]  And the 20 calls, 19 people agree with me while the neocon or right wing host is attacking me
[22:29.520 --> 22:33.600]  because I come to it from a libertarian perspective, and it just neutralizes them.
[22:33.600 --> 22:38.960]  Now, five, six years ago, that wasn't happening. It was half and half. And I'm seeing a total shift,
[22:38.960 --> 22:44.320]  personally, but also in the polls, but now both parties have circled the wagons against the people,
[22:44.320 --> 22:48.400]  and they're saying, we don't care what you want. John McCain said this war is going to go on for 100 years.
[22:48.400 --> 23:00.240]  Yeah. Yeah. And it can't. It just can't. We can't let it go on another year. I mean, it has...
[23:02.160 --> 23:05.440]  The other day I was getting interviewed, somebody said, what would you do if you were elected president?
[23:05.440 --> 23:12.080]  I would stop the damn war. And it's just that simple. You stop that war. You stop the other
[23:12.080 --> 23:17.200]  wars that we're in around the country, and you go around the country being a peacemaker and
[23:17.200 --> 23:19.760]  stopping wars. I thought that's what you're supposed to do.
[23:20.880 --> 23:24.640]  Since when does America invade all these countries that have nothing to do with 9-11?
[23:25.280 --> 23:31.200]  Yeah, really. And all of a sudden, the way I heard it, there are 15 people from
[23:31.760 --> 23:38.000]  Saudi Arabia hit us in New York, and we go jump on Afghanistan. I never could figure that one out.
[23:38.000 --> 23:42.640]  In Iraq, well, I did figure it out, too, but I'm surprised more people haven't figured it out.
[23:42.640 --> 23:47.840]  Yeah. Willie, you brought it up. You figured it out. What's your take on 9-11? It just came out
[23:47.840 --> 23:52.080]  in AP today that the White House was running the commission. We always knew that, but now they
[23:52.080 --> 23:57.280]  admit. In fact, I have the headline right here. I read it before you came on where they're now
[23:57.280 --> 24:04.640]  admitting that it was a staged, staged commission. Well, that ain't good news, but it doesn't surprise
[24:04.640 --> 24:11.280]  me. Did it use? No, it didn't. I'm glad it's coming out. What's your take on 9-11? Do you question
[24:11.280 --> 24:18.320]  the official story? I certainly do. I saw those towers fall, and I've seen an impulsion in Las
[24:18.320 --> 24:24.080]  Vegas. There was too much similarities between the two, and I saw the building fall that didn't
[24:24.080 --> 24:30.560]  get hit by nothing. How naive are we? What do they think we will go for?
[24:32.080 --> 24:38.240]  Are you saying you started having questions or that little voice in your head? Did you have
[24:38.240 --> 24:41.920]  a bad feeling the day it happened? Is that what you're saying? The day it happened. I saw one
[24:41.920 --> 24:46.400]  fall, and it was just so symmetrical. I said, wait a minute. I just saw that last week at the
[24:48.320 --> 24:53.520]  casino over in Las Vegas, and you see these impositions all the time, and the next one
[24:53.520 --> 24:57.680]  fell, and I said, hell, there's another one. They're trying to tell me that an airplane did it,
[24:57.680 --> 25:02.560]  and I can't go on with it. Then you find out that mainstream news reported, but it never
[25:02.560 --> 25:06.720]  got the attention that the supposed hijackers were given national security clearance and were
[25:06.720 --> 25:11.440]  trained at U.S. bases, and the dean of the Defense Language School, Colonel Butler, goes public and
[25:11.440 --> 25:15.680]  says, we train these people, the government's involved, and they start court-martialing until
[25:15.680 --> 25:21.520]  they agree to shut up. True story, I guess. I hate to hear it, but it's probably true.
[25:23.200 --> 25:27.200]  You've had a chance to see what tears form in-game some of the other films. What's
[25:27.200 --> 25:33.600]  Willie Olson's take on those films? Oh, I think they're right on. I think the fact that they're
[25:33.600 --> 25:39.120]  a few elite that are running everything, calling the shots, starting the wars, financing them all,
[25:40.640 --> 25:47.360]  I believe that, and what else we're doing, who knows, but that one thing alone is enough
[25:47.920 --> 25:54.080]  for us to think about, how do we stop them? Well, the proof is in the pudding. If you've got,
[25:54.080 --> 25:59.200]  on every issue, 75 to 85 in all the major scientific polls, and the people are against
[25:59.200 --> 26:02.880]  everything this government's doing, we send the Democrats to Congress in the war,
[26:02.880 --> 26:07.680]  they increase it, and now they're saying they're going to be there 100 years, Hillary and McCain.
[26:07.680 --> 26:10.880]  I mean, that, to me, that is a small group of them, things right there in privacy.
[26:11.600 --> 26:16.240]  Absolutely. And of course, I can see all those people attended the same meetings
[26:16.240 --> 26:19.280]  that you and the guys attended up in Canada. Am I wrong?
[26:19.280 --> 26:21.600]  Oh, no, a lot of them do go to the Bilderberg group. Yes, sir?
[26:22.240 --> 26:22.720]  Yes.
[26:22.720 --> 26:23.440]  Is that freedom?
[26:24.640 --> 26:27.760]  I don't think so. It's not democracy either.
[26:27.760 --> 26:35.280]  Willie Nelson, you're blowing me away here. When we get back, I want to talk about solutions,
[26:35.280 --> 26:40.080]  your ideas, because the people are awake to a certain extent. I just don't think that they
[26:40.080 --> 26:44.560]  have the specifics of what to do. I'm going to talk about some of your organizations and groups,
[26:44.560 --> 26:51.120]  and I agree with taking our everyday life into our own hands, like you've done with the biodiesel.
[26:51.120 --> 26:54.320]  That's a separate thing from what they're doing with the corn and other things, and
[26:54.320 --> 26:58.720]  I want to be sure and separate that out and explain that to people and what you've tried to do,
[26:58.720 --> 27:04.400]  and all the money you've put into trying to get us into renewable resources and things that are
[27:04.400 --> 27:10.080]  actually, you know, will allow us to not continue to destroy the earth. We'll be right back.
[27:10.080 --> 27:12.880]  Oh, in fact, we're not going to go to break. I forgot. I told them to skip that break.
[27:12.880 --> 27:16.320]  I'm so used to going to break at the 20 after, and I told John to skip that,
[27:16.320 --> 27:21.920]  so we've got more time here. I'm a little bit dumbstruck here talking to you, Willie.
[27:21.920 --> 27:27.600]  Solutions. I mean, you talk about how we do have this elite running things,
[27:27.600 --> 27:30.480]  and the evidence shows that, and the documents have been declassified.
[27:30.480 --> 27:34.160]  What are your ideas to get the people to mobilize to do something about it?
[27:36.160 --> 27:41.040]  Well, the fund I wrote called Peaceful Solution. Now,
[27:43.920 --> 27:49.280]  all those people that recorded it believe, and so do I, that there is a peaceful solution,
[27:49.280 --> 27:54.800]  and it's called a peace revolution, and we just take back America, and we do it,
[27:55.440 --> 28:00.880]  vote it back, we do it, and we make sure that the crooked ballot boxes are thrown away,
[28:00.880 --> 28:06.240]  we get a paper trail and everything, and make sure that good, honest people can get back in
[28:06.240 --> 28:10.240]  control, and that's the only way we're going to do it, is to just do it. You know what I mean?
[28:11.760 --> 28:17.760]  Well, I think that's happening. Just in the news today, we're seeing that they've recruited 26,000
[28:17.760 --> 28:23.440]  preachers the White House has through FEMA to tell their flocks to stand down, to turn in their guns,
[28:23.440 --> 28:28.960]  to follow orders, to do what the President says in the Presidential Decision Directive 51. Bush
[28:28.960 --> 28:32.800]  says he's above the Congress. It's no longer involved in continuity of government in the
[28:32.800 --> 28:38.160]  John Warner Defense Authorization Act. They have openly funded for insurrection and rebellion
[28:38.160 --> 28:43.920]  by the American people. The whole police state apparatus they built up after 9-11, and I'm
[28:43.920 --> 28:48.400]  going to get your take on this, Willie, because I know you're aware of it, is now being used against
[28:48.400 --> 28:53.760]  the people. They're not even talking about the boogeyman of Al Cida. It's no secret that for
[28:53.760 --> 28:58.480]  the past seven years, the Balance Bracelet has been one of the hottest products around. You've
[28:58.480 --> 29:02.720]  seen the Balance Bracelet on the risks of golf professionals, athletes, and people from all

[31:52.480 --> 31:57.680]  It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States
[31:57.680 --> 32:02.480]  create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue. With never ending late fees over
[32:02.480 --> 32:06.880]  the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to
[32:06.880 --> 32:11.760]  repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors. The Federal Debt Relief System has
[32:11.760 --> 32:17.040]  created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans,
[32:17.040 --> 32:20.880]  lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[32:20.880 --> 32:25.200]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[32:25.200 --> 32:29.120]  ending with nothing on your credit report. Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe
[32:29.120 --> 32:33.280]  with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt. Instead of living each
[32:33.280 --> 32:37.760]  day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around. Call the Federal

[32:59.520 --> 33:12.800]  today. A lot of people are saying that. I was saying that many years ago and now
[33:12.800 --> 33:18.240]  Bob Woodward has talked about other setting up for martial law of all people. Naomi Wolfe
[33:18.240 --> 33:24.800]  is talking about it. I think that might save us. I'm seeing a lot at the end of the tunnel,
[33:24.800 --> 33:29.680]  but I think you're right. I think that's a great danger. If that did happen, a nuke went off,
[33:29.680 --> 33:34.320]  a biological weapon was released, or terrorists supposedly blew up a bunch of other buildings.
[33:35.520 --> 33:38.720]  What do you think the response of the population should be if they announce one of this new
[33:38.720 --> 33:43.040]  emergency or it could be an economic emergency and Bush is going to have to stay on to save us?
[33:44.960 --> 33:50.560]  Well, I would hope that we'd be smarter than that and I would hope that we'd say,
[33:50.560 --> 33:56.640]  no, we're throwing all you guys out and we're starting over. You can stop the elections if
[33:56.640 --> 34:05.120]  you want to, but you can't stop the people. Well, Ron Paul has gotten more donations from
[34:06.080 --> 34:13.200]  troops and people in Iraq than all Republicans combined. The troops in polls 75% are against
[34:13.200 --> 34:17.040]  the war, so if Bush is planning on using these troops here, it looks like he's going to have a
[34:17.040 --> 34:23.200]  problem. Well, again, the troops are under orders and if they don't do what they, you know, the
[34:23.200 --> 34:28.880]  orders are, then they get shot. So the troops have no choice. There's a few of them in there
[34:28.880 --> 34:33.280]  that are there because they think it's the right thing to do. There are a few there because they
[34:33.280 --> 34:37.680]  just like to fight, but there's a lot of them there, like you say, that would rather be home
[34:37.680 --> 34:43.600]  with their families and save our good men and women for something that really matters for really
[34:43.600 --> 34:48.080]  something that is the defense of our country. If we need some people down here on the borders,
[34:48.080 --> 34:52.480]  let's take 150,000 people out of Iraq and put them on the borders. Canada and Mexico,
[34:52.480 --> 34:57.680]  we can secure our borders that way. Well, how will we have this war on terror where there's
[34:57.680 --> 35:03.040]  an al-Qaeda terrorist under every bed, under every table? We got to have checkpoints and kids getting
[35:03.040 --> 35:07.680]  thumbscan to get their lunches to stop al-Qaeda, but then the borders wide open. That kind of
[35:07.680 --> 35:12.320]  makes the war on terror look like a fraud. Well, yeah, and, you know, they're fighting over there
[35:12.320 --> 35:15.760]  because you remember the old joke about the guy that dropped a quarter and he was looking around,
[35:15.760 --> 35:18.720]  the guy said, where did you lose it? I said, I lost it over yonder. And he said,
[35:19.280 --> 35:21.840]  why are you looking over here for? I said, what's called the lights better?
[35:25.600 --> 35:27.760]  I think that's why they're over there, the lights better.
[35:29.520 --> 35:35.200]  Well, it's a black hole to launder money and dump trillions of dollars in no bed contracts to
[35:35.200 --> 35:42.960]  Halliburton. Yeah. And there's nobody stopping it. And as long as it keeps going on and nobody
[35:42.960 --> 35:49.440]  stops it, I don't know what the end result will be. Well, tyrants seem to be good. It can't be good
[35:49.440 --> 35:54.000]  for us. Well, you're right. Tyrants have known throughout history. They keep pushing, they
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.320]  keep testing, tyranny doesn't come overnight. And I hope a lot of people that support this war,
[35:58.320 --> 36:02.080]  I hope you know, we have illegal wars not declared, torture, the rest of it.
[36:02.080 --> 36:06.400]  But none of us are safe here. What comes around goes around. You reap what you sow, don't you,
[36:06.400 --> 36:12.720]  Willie? Absolutely. We're 10 times over, I remember. And I'm not sure I want to get
[36:12.720 --> 36:18.640]  treated 10 times as bad as we're treating other people. Did you ever see the actual army reports
[36:18.640 --> 36:24.720]  MSNBC posted it, but then never covered it with what the actual torture was, not just those photos?
[36:25.760 --> 36:29.040]  I mean, they reported they tortured people's children in front of their parents.
[36:29.040 --> 36:35.280]  No, I didn't hear them. Did you see the report about them raping the women inside the camps?
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.160]  Well, that one done, surprisingly, but torturing them in front of their family,
[36:40.160 --> 36:45.600]  I didn't know we did that. Yeah, if you want, I can email you some of the mainstream stories.
[36:46.720 --> 36:49.440]  They had a CIA section chief in the Washington Post say, yeah, we
[36:50.720 --> 36:53.200]  torture their children in front of the parents to get answers.
[36:53.200 --> 36:58.800]  Well, I don't understand it.
[36:59.840 --> 37:05.760]  I think the establishment is trying to seduce our crypts into evil. But again, I think they're
[37:06.560 --> 37:11.600]  throwing it back up at them. Well, I think so. You just, this can't happen,
[37:11.600 --> 37:17.040]  because everyone is an individual. We all have our free will and God give us the freedom to
[37:17.040 --> 37:24.160]  to use it. So no matter where we are, what we're doing, if we know it's wrong, we should not do it.
[37:25.600 --> 37:29.840]  Well, for anybody that wants to report, it was a Filipino American general, two star general,
[37:29.840 --> 37:37.040]  to Goomba was hired to run the report on 30 plus camps in Iraq. And that was the findings for
[37:37.040 --> 37:40.720]  anybody that wants to go check that those are amazing claims, but they they are true.
[37:40.720 --> 37:49.360]  You know, speaking of an individual like George Bush and these elitists that are puppeteering him,
[37:50.480 --> 37:54.000]  how do you think they sleep at night, Willie, because somebody like you or myself, you know,
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.600]  we have a conscience and I love my conscience. It's my greatest possession.
[37:58.560 --> 38:01.840]  And I wonder about psychopaths sometimes how they just enjoy evil.
[38:02.800 --> 38:06.960]  But you know, I don't know where you grew up, but I grew up with a lot of people who
[38:06.960 --> 38:15.600]  who really are that you have to doubt if they have a conscience. And I know they're all over
[38:15.600 --> 38:21.600]  the world. So I'm not surprised that people, you know, can torture because that's going to happen
[38:21.600 --> 38:27.680]  all my life and, you know, smaller degrees. But there are just some people who are that way.
[38:27.680 --> 38:31.920]  They like to make the other person uncomfortable in whatever way they can.
[38:31.920 --> 38:33.600]  It's a power trip, isn't it?
[38:33.600 --> 38:37.040]  Yeah, I think it is. It's not money, it's about power.
[38:38.320 --> 38:43.600]  Well, where I'm from, my dad is from two counties over to the east. That's where our
[38:43.600 --> 38:49.280]  family's been since 1829 with Spanish land grants. And then my mom's family were German
[38:49.280 --> 38:55.440]  immigrants in the 1840s to right around Austin and surrounding areas. So I am really proud
[38:55.440 --> 38:59.120]  to be a Texan, because you're a Texan, Willie. All the way through.
[38:59.120 --> 39:02.400]  You know, I love our state. It sure is growing.
[39:03.520 --> 39:06.640]  It is growing. And I'm glad to see it. We've got a lot of room down there.
[39:06.640 --> 39:10.800]  And, you know, so if it gets too crowded in Fredericksburg, we'll go further west.
[39:12.640 --> 39:15.680]  There's plenty of room out there. So I'd tell people to come on down.
[39:16.640 --> 39:18.560]  You've got a studio out in Fredericksburg, don't you?
[39:19.200 --> 39:23.840]  I have one out at Ferdinand. It's out in out by just west of Austin.
[39:23.840 --> 39:26.480]  There's between Austin and Fredericksburg.
[39:26.480 --> 39:29.120]  Well, it sure is pretty out by hunt.
[39:30.240 --> 39:34.160]  Yes, it is. It's just incredibly beautiful all over that state.
[39:34.160 --> 39:36.640]  And I'm prejudiced and I will be the first to admit it.
[39:37.520 --> 39:40.320]  The presidential election, the Kissinich has dropped out.
[39:40.320 --> 39:42.720]  My audience and others helped raise the money for the recount.
[39:42.720 --> 39:47.440]  They did find evidence on the Republican and Democratic side of Chicanery in New Hampshire.
[39:47.440 --> 39:50.640]  But Kissinich has dropped out now. What do you think of Ron Paul?
[39:51.760 --> 39:55.760]  Oh, I like Ron Paul, but I think he's got the same troubles that Dennis had.
[39:55.760 --> 40:00.240]  First of all, you know, there's not that much support behind him.
[40:00.240 --> 40:06.480]  He is growing a little bit, but I noticed his numbers had come up.
[40:06.480 --> 40:09.680]  Then where was it? Maine here in the last day or so that he got quite a good.
[40:10.240 --> 40:14.720]  I like what he said. I still think when we get down to it,
[40:14.720 --> 40:17.600]  it's going to be McCain and either Hillary or Obama.
[40:18.240 --> 40:19.920]  And they're all pro-war.
[40:19.920 --> 40:24.560]  It sounds like it. I was hoping that Hillary had changed her mind.
[40:24.560 --> 40:27.440]  I was hoping Obama was all the way against the war.
[40:29.440 --> 40:34.160]  I don't know. Maybe public opinion can keep their minds where they need to be.
[40:34.160 --> 40:37.680]  Let's talk more about the election, biodiesel, hemp, the drug war,
[40:37.680 --> 40:41.840]  so many other questions. This is half the interviews already gone by.
[40:41.840 --> 40:44.640]  This is just wonderful to have you with us, Mr. Nelson.
[40:44.640 --> 40:47.120]  You are a sweetheart to spend so much time with us.
[40:47.120 --> 40:50.800]  We'll be right back with Willie Nelson after this quick three-minute break.
[40:50.800 --> 40:51.920]  Please stay with us.
[40:59.920 --> 41:02.640]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[41:02.640 --> 41:05.840]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[41:07.840 --> 41:09.200]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:09.200 --> 41:11.440]  Translating on the MNFM dial across the nation.
[41:11.440 --> 41:15.280]  Saddlecast on the satellite and on to the Internet at Cruz News.
[41:15.280 --> 41:20.160]  www.usmpolewars.com, www.prisonplanet.com.
[41:22.240 --> 41:26.960]  We have eight servers, and this is not happening in about a year.
[41:26.960 --> 41:29.040]  Some of the sites you can't even hardly get to right now.
[41:29.040 --> 41:32.720]  I guess the word is spread on the Internet that Willie Nelson is,
[41:32.720 --> 41:34.800]  and we can take millions of visitors.
[41:34.800 --> 41:38.560]  So people are going crazy right now on the websites.
[41:38.560 --> 41:40.880]  Willie, you have made quite a splash here.
[41:41.680 --> 41:42.480]  Well, that's good.
[41:42.480 --> 41:45.920]  Yeah, you're burning the place down.
[41:45.920 --> 41:46.480]  It's awesome.
[41:49.680 --> 41:53.920]  Getting into the war and then the solution, trying to fix this politically.
[41:54.960 --> 41:59.120]  Magically, Ron Paul has been getting half the votes, the poll show he should get.
[41:59.120 --> 42:02.480]  Obama was getting 15 more points or more than Hillary in New Hampshire.
[42:02.480 --> 42:04.800]  She magically won by almost four points.
[42:04.800 --> 42:06.320]  That's like an 18-point swing.
[42:06.320 --> 42:07.680]  That's never happened before.
[42:07.680 --> 42:10.960]  Ron Paul really got second place in Nevada.
[42:10.960 --> 42:13.360]  The media just said he didn't even make place.
[42:13.360 --> 42:15.280]  He won first place in Louisiana.
[42:15.280 --> 42:16.800]  They lied and said he got second place.
[42:17.520 --> 42:21.200]  These voting machines, all the corruption there, give us your view on that.
[42:22.240 --> 42:24.960]  Well, you know, it's a no-brainer.
[42:24.960 --> 42:27.680]  You've got to get rid of the voting machines to go to their crooked.
[42:27.680 --> 42:29.040]  Or they can be hacked.
[42:29.040 --> 42:33.600]  And we can't afford to have another election stolen.
[42:35.760 --> 42:39.840]  Well, in the past, when you were growing up as a young man and even older,
[42:39.840 --> 42:42.720]  I mean, the voting was, they put the ballot box out in the middle of the room.
[42:42.720 --> 42:43.600]  They all got counted.
[42:43.600 --> 42:45.600]  That precinct then announced it.
[42:45.600 --> 42:47.040]  Everybody got to watch the counting.
[42:47.040 --> 43:15.040]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[43:15.040 --> 43:18.640]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[43:18.640 --> 43:23.040]  They are called Illuminati, elite, opponents of the New World Order.
[43:23.040 --> 43:25.840]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[43:25.840 --> 43:29.360]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[43:29.360 --> 43:32.960]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated,
[43:32.960 --> 43:36.000]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses,
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.400]  the destruction of the earth and mankind,
[43:38.400 --> 43:42.400]  we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[47:19.360 --> 47:24.560]  Well, now that Kusinich has dropped out, I mean, do you think Ron Paul is the best candidate or
[47:24.560 --> 47:25.440]  what's your take on that?
[47:26.160 --> 47:30.560]  Oh, I think he's a great candidate. I think he's a great guy. And, you know, I wish him well.
[47:30.560 --> 47:35.680]  And we'll see what happens, I guess, tomorrow. We'll answer a lot of our questions.
[47:37.600 --> 47:40.160]  Yeah, Super Tuesday coming up tomorrow.
[47:40.160 --> 47:47.280]  Willi, getting back into 9-11 because you brought it up and I was debating even bringing it up,
[47:47.280 --> 47:53.200]  it's so controversial. But other questions, other things that piqued your interest and
[47:53.200 --> 47:56.000]  made you question the official story surrounding 9-11?
[47:58.480 --> 48:06.720]  Well, as soon as it happened, in the next day, I was somewhere doing a show and somebody said,
[48:06.720 --> 48:11.840]  what do you think about it? And I said, well, first of all, when I get hit, I like to look
[48:11.840 --> 48:16.960]  around and see who did it before I start swinging at everybody in the room. And it kind of looked
[48:16.960 --> 48:22.320]  at what we were doing. We get hit over here. And the next thing you know, we're jumping on everybody
[48:22.320 --> 48:31.440]  in the town. So we got hit from Saudi Arabia. I think we have some questions that need to be
[48:31.440 --> 48:32.800]  answered from most folks.
[48:32.800 --> 48:39.680]  You know, that's a really good point you make. Again, Newsweek reported a week after 9-11 that
[48:39.680 --> 48:46.160]  in the six months before, they had mass carrier task forces, 44,000 U.S. troops, 18,000 British
[48:46.160 --> 48:52.480]  troops into Shikistan, Uzbekistan surrounding, and that Bush on September 10th signed the order
[48:52.480 --> 48:56.800]  in the next week to attack Afghanistan. Man, what timing, Willi, that he signed the attack
[48:56.800 --> 49:06.320]  order the day before? Yeah, I wonder how that happened. I mean, how smoking gun is that?
[49:06.320 --> 49:12.160]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, what does it take for us to realize that, you know, we're having the war
[49:12.160 --> 49:18.800]  pulled over our eyes one more time? You know, there's a war against the American people,
[49:18.800 --> 49:23.840]  and that's the drug war. Back when drugs were sold on store shelves, we had a lot less drug
[49:23.840 --> 49:29.040]  use in this country. They criminalize it. It corrupts the police, and it puts a lot of money
[49:29.040 --> 49:34.480]  in drugs, and then the kids get involved in it. And of course, they got to go after marijuana,
[49:34.480 --> 49:39.280]  because 70-plus percent of people don't use other drugs. They use the medicine.
[49:40.160 --> 49:46.560]  Hemp, and you've been a big advocate exposing how Dupont and Alchemical shut that down,
[49:46.560 --> 49:50.880]  even the cannabis varieties that don't even have HTC in them.
[49:50.880 --> 49:57.680]  When did you first begin to fight the drug war and to expose what was happening with the suppression
[49:57.680 --> 50:06.480]  of him? Well, first of all, I knew that there should be, that it's the greatest killer on the
[50:06.480 --> 50:12.320]  planet. It is stress, and the best medicine is cannabis, and for some people. And it's a good
[50:12.320 --> 50:19.120]  medicine. So first of all, there was no reason to make it illegal unless you had an agenda.
[50:19.120 --> 50:32.640]  And the same thing with BioDiesel and ethanol. Ethanol back in the 30s was 25 percent of the
[50:32.640 --> 50:40.560]  market with ethanol. The other 75 percent was standard oil. So once ethanol became a problem,
[50:41.120 --> 50:46.160]  what did they do? They came up with prohibition. They did two things. It stopped the farmer from
[50:46.160 --> 50:52.480]  growing and making ethanol because he was making ethanol in the same piece of equipment that he
[50:52.480 --> 50:59.040]  made his whiskey at, which was a steal. So when they brought in prohibition and stopped the whiskey,
[50:59.040 --> 51:03.920]  they also stopped the making of ethanol, and they put the farmers out of business who were
[51:03.920 --> 51:12.320]  making their own fuel and also standard oil again won the battle. Yeah, my family's from
[51:12.320 --> 51:20.720]  in between Fairfield and Buffalo, and we've still got over a thousand acres out there.
[51:21.360 --> 51:25.840]  Farmers tough. Some of the years they would sell land off the original Spanish land grant just to
[51:25.840 --> 51:30.320]  just be able to pay the taxes, but the big drought in the 50s almost made them go under.
[51:30.320 --> 51:36.000]  But there are rotting stills back there down on some of the swamp land. I don't know who put
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.600]  them there. They're still regulators. They might come after us, but there's old metal remnants
[51:39.600 --> 51:45.280]  of stills. And the story I got was is that they made them destroy them and went after people,
[51:45.280 --> 51:49.840]  and they weren't even most of the time making moonshine with them. But you're right. That was
[51:49.840 --> 51:55.360]  an economic warfare against the farmers because I know that happened to my family, the Joneses.
[51:56.160 --> 52:01.760]  Well, it definitely happened to a lot of people, and it put the ethanol people out of business
[52:01.760 --> 52:05.440]  the first time. And then the second time around, they put them out of business. And now they're
[52:05.440 --> 52:10.160]  here. They're trying to do it again. And as the oil goes up and up and up and up,
[52:11.680 --> 52:16.560]  they're also looking at us over here who are the alternative energies. And I've heard from
[52:16.560 --> 52:20.400]  the oil companies that, hey, you know, it's all right. You guys go ahead and do what you're going
[52:20.400 --> 52:24.160]  to do for the next 36 months or so, and then we're going to come in and take it over.
[52:24.800 --> 52:30.080]  And that would all be well and good, except that when that happens, I know it's not going to be
[52:30.080 --> 52:34.880]  good for the local producer and the local consumer. A lot of things will be imported,
[52:34.880 --> 52:40.960]  palm oil for all over the world. And that's not good until we can get it back to where
[52:41.680 --> 52:47.680]  that your family and my family can grow their own ethanol in their own biodiesel.
[52:49.040 --> 52:54.240]  And then our economy is going to stay bad. We have to bring it back to sustainable agriculture
[52:54.240 --> 53:01.120]  locally. And it's got to start locally. Well, going back to biodiesel, there's a big
[53:01.120 --> 53:05.600]  difference between biodiesel and some of the things that are making out of corn, because
[53:05.600 --> 53:10.560]  you're able to make the biodiesel you create out of all sorts of things. Can you explain the
[53:10.560 --> 53:14.160]  difference and then talk about the program you've tried to launch nationally?
[53:14.880 --> 53:22.160]  Well, the first diesel engine, Ludoff diesel, designed his first engine to run on peanut oil.
[53:22.800 --> 53:30.080]  So for all these years that we've been using, you know, all in diesel, and we could have been
[53:30.080 --> 53:36.880]  using peanut oil, we could have been using all kinds of vegetable oils. We didn't have to become
[53:36.880 --> 53:46.480]  that dependent. So it was, again, it was a planned agenda to keep us away from the biodiesel because
[53:46.480 --> 53:52.160]  they wanted to sell us oil. At the same time, the government was using biodiesel and ethanol
[53:52.160 --> 53:58.960]  in its equipment because it was cheaper to produce and the equipment ran better on it.
[53:58.960 --> 54:04.240]  But they didn't give it to the private sector because they wanted us to keep using oil.
[54:06.480 --> 54:12.480]  Well, you talk about the monopoly game they played to do this. Is that where, I mean,
[54:12.480 --> 54:17.200]  is that the place you started to learn about the monopoly man and the larger global forces? Or
[54:17.200 --> 54:22.160]  when did you discover what, for lack of a better term, we'd call the New World Order or the Kingpence?
[54:23.280 --> 54:26.960]  Oh, I don't know. There's one thing and another. That was part of it. You know,
[54:26.960 --> 54:31.600]  when the cannabis thing in the marijuana was made illegal back in those days,
[54:31.600 --> 54:38.480]  I traced it back to the petrochemicals again and everything that was made from cannabis
[54:38.480 --> 54:44.560]  now is made from petrochemicals. So it's just the oil companies, again, coming in and taking over
[54:44.560 --> 54:52.960]  and making marijuana illegal and having people as crazy and it'll kill you and all that stuff.
[54:52.960 --> 54:57.840]  So far, I don't know of anybody that's died from marijuana unless the bail fell on them or something.
[54:58.560 --> 55:02.640]  My friend Kevin Booth just produced a film I consulted on called American Drug War that's
[55:02.640 --> 55:09.920]  going to be airing on Showtime coming up in March, I guess next month. And he spent four years making
[55:09.920 --> 55:14.400]  it and he's got the numbers from year to year it changes. What about 200 to 300,000 it changes
[55:14.400 --> 55:23.440]  each year, die from pharmacological legal drugs and about 10,000 die a year from all the really
[55:23.440 --> 55:27.760]  hard, you know, quote, bad illegal drugs, which I agree are bad heroin, cocaine, things like that.
[55:28.400 --> 55:33.440]  And then they can't even find any deaths from marijuana and George Washington grew it on his
[55:33.440 --> 55:39.040]  land and smoked it for stomach aches. So why is marijuana illegal? And why do they fill the
[55:39.040 --> 55:44.640]  prisons with hundreds of thousands of people a year who are caught with it? Well, it's obvious again
[55:44.640 --> 55:52.000]  because everything that's made from petrochemicals at one time was made from cannabis. And it's
[55:53.040 --> 55:59.760]  even the the blue jeans. Did you ever read a book called The Emperor Where He Has No Clothes or Jack
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.960]  Hare Rope? Yes, I did. I like the Bible. Yeah. And it talks about the original Levi's being made
[56:04.960 --> 56:14.000]  from cannabis and it talks about the all the ships, the covered wagons, the canvas was made
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.440]  from cannabis. Yeah, the sails, the ropes, they lasted four or five times longer. Yeah. And when
[56:19.440 --> 56:26.640]  I was in the high school in the FFA during the war, and they had us making rope out of hemp,
[56:26.640 --> 56:31.600]  they made him legal again back during the war because they needed it. And we were making
[56:31.600 --> 56:38.080]  hemp ropes in the gymnasium there in Abbott, Texas. It really is a magic plant. I mean,
[56:38.080 --> 56:44.720]  you can grow it anywhere and it's just an incredible product for industry. But I guess
[56:44.720 --> 56:48.880]  it's not centralized like a giant chemical plant. So they just can't let the farmers have that,
[56:48.880 --> 56:54.960]  can they? That's right. It's just too hard for them to compete against something that you can
[56:54.960 --> 57:02.960]  just throw out some seeds and that you've got food, fuel, material, everything you need in one
[57:04.640 --> 57:09.600]  seed. And that's just too much for them to compete with. We're talking to Willie Nelson. He's not
[57:09.600 --> 57:17.120]  just a country music legend or been in scores of films. He's a humanitarian and has just done so
[57:17.120 --> 57:21.680]  much good work for humanity. Do you want to play part of that song since you mentioned it? We
[57:21.680 --> 57:25.040]  happen to have it piece on earth. Would you like us to play a few minutes of that, Willie?
[57:25.040 --> 57:27.360]  Sure, go ahead. John, you've got that, right?
[57:30.080 --> 57:36.080]  We're sending so many songs. Yeah, it's there. I forgot to tell them that we might play that,
[57:36.080 --> 57:39.520]  if you mentioned it. Here it is. We'll be back to Willie here in about two minutes.

[1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:07.920]  A report by AAA and the oil price information service finds that gas prices have gone up an
[1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:13.360]  average of 33 cents a gallon since its time last month. A strong earthquake has hit southwestern

[1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:38.080]  Fire swept through the historic Texas Governor's Mansion, correspondent Kelly Shannon.
[1:00:38.080 --> 1:00:43.760]  The walls are still intact, but the roof has buckled because of the fire damage and the water
[1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:48.000]  from the fire truck fighting the fire. No one was in the mansion at the time of the fire.

[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:56.560]  President Bush is getting set to leave on a farewell tour of Europe. The trip starts with a
[1:01:56.560 --> 1:02:02.320]  U.S.-EU summit in Slovenia, then takes the president to Paris, Rome, Berlin, and London.
[1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:08.480]  It's likely the final European tour of his term and a key goal is rallying the allies to get Iran
[1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:15.840]  to halt its nuclear program. Iran is its existential threat to peace and it's very important for the
[1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:21.200]  world to take the Iranian threat seriously. Tehran continues to enrich uranium despite three rounds
[1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:27.120]  of U.N. sanctions, but Bush says he's committed to diplomatic efforts while not ruling out force

[1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:39.440]  Hundreds of people have been evacuated from homes, a hospital and a flooded nursing home.
[1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:44.400]  Residents of Chicago's southern suburbs are cleaning up after yesterday's storms and tornadoes,
[1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:49.360]  which tore the roofs from homes and overturned semi-trailer trucks. Forecasters warn that more
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:54.640]  strong storms could hit northern suburbs again this afternoon. More rain is expected in Wisconsin
[1:03:54.640 --> 1:04:00.480]  when officials warn of flooding from La Crosse to Sheboygan. There's already an offer to host
[1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:05.520]  the first presidential town hall meeting between John McCain and Barack Obama. That's according
[1:04:05.520 --> 1:04:10.800]  to a letter being sent to both candidates today. The offer comes from New York City Mayor Michael
[1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:16.240]  Bloomberg and ABC News. A spacewalk today at the International Space Station has a two-man crew
[1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:23.280]  tackled to sky high list of fix-up tasks. The spacewalk is the third and last of the mission.
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:29.440]  Police in New York State say a 29-year-old man jumps out of a plate at 10,000 feet with a camera
[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:34.240]  but no parachute yesterday. The man was apparently abjuring on the flight when he followed an
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:39.120]  instructor, student and videographer out the door but wearing no skydiving gear. Police don't
[1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:43.760]  suspect foul play but they're not elaborating. His body was found next to a house with a damaged
[1:04:43.760 --> 1:04:53.440]  roof west of Albany. I'm Pete LaValle, IRN, USA, Radio News. More than 700 chemicals have been found
[1:04:53.440 --> 1:04:57.600]  in our drinking water and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while
[1:04:57.600 --> 1:05:02.160]  taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when
[1:05:02.160 --> 1:05:07.680]  they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with
[1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:13.360]  both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits
[1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:19.440]  the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts
[1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:24.960]  10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities
[1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:30.080]  use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria. What about you? Order your
[1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:36.080]  KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:14.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:06:21.600 --> 1:06:30.400]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen. It is already the 20th day of May 2008 and we are going straight
[1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:35.840]  into a big interview right here at the start of the show. He'll be with us for the next 40 minutes.
[1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:44.320]  He is former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, also Hollywood movie star, Navy Seal and so
[1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:50.320]  much more. He's also a best-selling author, former TV host on MSNBC and he was on with us
[1:06:50.320 --> 1:06:55.760]  about a month ago and it made headlines in hundreds of newspapers, the Associated Press and National
[1:06:55.760 --> 1:07:01.920]  Television when he came on the show and questioned the official 9-11 story and I was just talking to
[1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:06.720]  him before we went live and he said, he's got something he wants to complain about. So you'll
[1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:11.120]  find out what that is with me right now. Governor Ventura, thank you for coming on with us.
[1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:16.160]  Hi, Alex. Great to be here again. I hope I can say that. No, I'm laughing because
[1:07:17.440 --> 1:07:24.400]  I guess when you do your show, you automatically make it on Bill O'Reilly's idiot list.
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:31.840]  I think that's what happens, yes. Now, I'm confused over that, Alex. How come we're not allowed to
[1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:39.280]  ask any questions today? Well, this broadcast has about two million listeners per show and then
[1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:44.960]  it's all magnified on the web and they don't like the fact that there's a large alternative radio
[1:07:44.960 --> 1:07:51.200]  show with more than 60 affiliates and that's number one internet show. Maybe it's something
[1:07:51.200 --> 1:07:57.920]  like that because I can't believe how I simply ask some questions in the way you're attacked.
[1:07:58.960 --> 1:08:04.320]  For simply asking questions, does our country really become that that you're not even allowed to
[1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:12.240]  publicly question the government? I say this, Alex, because in looking back on my 56 years on
[1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:19.840]  the planet, the government's lied to me a great deal and they don't have great credibility with me.
[1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:24.000]  So why wouldn't I question them when they tell me something?
[1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:28.960]  Oh, I totally agree with you. I mean, how many times have they been caught lying
[1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:34.400]  and isn't it more suspicious? Me thinks they protest too much that they don't want us to
[1:08:34.400 --> 1:08:38.640]  ask about Building 7, the firefighters on tape saying the government blew it up. I mean,
[1:08:38.640 --> 1:08:45.440]  why aren't we supposed to talk about that? I don't know. One of the most interesting interviews
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:56.960]  that I've seen now has been William Rodriguez. Absolutely. When I watched the DVD of William
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:04.320]  Rodriguez, this guy is totally talking from what he remembers. You can clearly see it.
[1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:09.120]  He's not making anything up. Well, he was there. The firefighters and police
[1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:12.480]  said that he stayed in to get a lot of them out when things were starting to collapse.
[1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:18.880]  Oh, he's a hero's hero. There's no doubt about it. And when you hear him talk and he tells about
[1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:25.440]  what he knows there, how can you not question what went on that day? Well, that was my first
[1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:32.880]  question. What do you think of the massive media attack that you have gone through for
[1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:36.880]  simply asking a question? They never address what you actually said on the show.
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:41.920]  And the majority of Americans in polls have the same questions. It's all that you're bad
[1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:48.320]  to ask those questions. Well, that's, yeah, it's been pretty eye-opening to say the least.
[1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:55.680]  That, you know, if you do ask a question out there, it's like you're not allowed to today. And
[1:09:55.680 --> 1:10:01.360]  that's what really troubles me the most is this attitude. Here's what Alex, the fact that, and
[1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:09.440]  here's what I truly believe. I think people have this hidden, almost screen around them in many
[1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:18.240]  ways that because they don't want to believe that it could be true, they just put that screen
[1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:23.840]  up and won't allow anything to penetrate it to the effect that it might be true. You're right.
[1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:30.320]  It's a bubble of denial, their little imaginary world, and anything that conflicts with that,
[1:10:30.320 --> 1:10:37.840]  they say isn't allowed. Yeah, it really is that way. And that to me is what has to come down,
[1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:45.360]  is the fact that, you know, and I like to refer a great deal to the movie that was just out with
[1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:51.680]  I'm John Adams because it was very profound. Don't ever stay there. Tell us about that after
[1:10:51.680 --> 1:11:00.240]  this quick break. He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:06.880]  Well, he needs no introduction. He's Jesse Ventura. He's going to be with us for most of
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:11.200]  this hour. We're very thankful for that. And I was going to get into his book being on the New
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:18.640]  York Times by selling less. And I was going to get into his run for the Senate. Is he really
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:22.880]  going to do it? We know he's looking at that. When will we get a final answer? And we will cover
[1:11:22.880 --> 1:11:27.600]  that in the second half of the interview after the bottom of the hour. But out of the gates,
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:32.720]  he brought up 9-11. Now, I have to say, Governor Ventura, I have never seen anyone. And I said
[1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:36.960]  this on air. My whole staff said this, all the emails we got said it. I've never seen anyone
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:44.000]  trounce Sean Hannity like that just from a position of strength, a position of knowledge.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:47.840]  When he says, hey, we don't stage the news, we're not told what to say. And you said,
[1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:52.080]  oh, you really want to cover Ann and Nicole Smith for six months. And he just looked like a
[1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:56.720]  cat that had been caught eating the canary. He looked totally guilty and turned red-faced
[1:11:56.720 --> 1:12:01.680]  and smiled like a Cheshire cat. I mean, it's asinine. It's come out with the Pentagon's
[1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:06.240]  planning propaganda. They have hundreds of people on the payroll claiming they're not putting out
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:11.120]  this info about the war. We know there's propaganda in media. We know they have talking points.
[1:12:11.680 --> 1:12:17.600]  They have talking points to attack 9-11 truthers. But I have to tell you, you absolutely kicked
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:22.480]  Hannity's butt. I've never seen anything like it. He was speechless.
[1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:29.440]  Well, you know, I'm going to give him his due. I actually found him on and off camera the day that
[1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:36.720]  I was there, kind of enjoyable. And I know that seems weird to say. It's because I think that
[1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:40.720]  with me, he took it slightly different posture than he did with most people.
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:47.440]  Well, he knows. The thing is, they want me on later this month, but it won't be in studio.
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:52.880]  I fully expect them to be far more aggressive with me when I'm not there in person.
[1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:57.360]  But it's not just that they weren't being aggressive. Every thing he threw at you,
[1:12:57.360 --> 1:13:02.160]  you totally turned around on him. I mean, I told my listeners that is now the textbook example
[1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:07.520]  of how to deal with these people. Well, I deal with it the only way I know how, and that's kind
[1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:15.600]  of pulling strap the years back and full door ahead. I'm that way about things. And the truth
[1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:20.640]  of the matter was, I worked in that business. I know what goes on because I thought it myself
[1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:27.040]  when I worked at MSNBC. Every day, they would send me down the topics they wanted on the show
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:32.240]  after telling me that my show I could have complete control of. Well, there were topics
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:40.160]  that, yes, I remember distinctly the one was the murder in California of the pregnant girl.
[1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:47.520]  Yes. And I mean, that's important to California, but there's 10,000, 12,000 murders a year that
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:54.960]  take place. How is one more important than another in this country? And those are local
[1:13:54.960 --> 1:14:00.000]  stories that should be dealt with with local media. There are not national stories, nor
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:04.720]  should they be made national stories. They're national inquirer stories. Well, we know what
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:10.400]  they do. They do those strictly to get ratings. I was about to say, and it fills up the news time
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:14.240]  with these issues that don't affect the power brokers. Meanwhile, there's no time.
[1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:21.520]  Three more US troops died today. Exactly. They fill it up with this God, God, Bologna.
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:27.920]  And the bad part is we as a culture are accepting it, but hopefully the listeners that listen
[1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:34.160]  to you and the internet are very dangerous to that because it's becoming more and more powerful
[1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:39.600]  all the time as we know it. Rest assured, the internet will be the next thing the government
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:46.480]  will try to control. By the way, Joe Lieberman has called for federal control over the internet.
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:53.280]  He wrote a letter to Google's head and said that they need a self-censor and that the government
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:57.440]  would give them a list of things that weren't allowed to be covered. Thank God, Google said no,
[1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:01.920]  but they're talking about taxing the web, regulating it, making you have an IP address
[1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:07.040]  that certified, making you thumb scan to get online. What's your view on that, Governor?
[1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:14.880]  I think that's horrible. To me, we better wake up. Oh, guess what? I've got a great story for you
[1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:20.800]  that I'll tie right in. I just came across the Mexican border from Mexico to the U.S., right?
[1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:27.280]  Yes, sir. And this will tie into what you just talked about. All through Mexico, I was waved
[1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:32.240]  through every military stop. They have now down there what are called hassle-free zones,
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:39.040]  where U.S. citizens can drive and you won't be hassled by the federalies or any of that stuff.
[1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:46.240]  We want their little bite, their morditas. Well, but the point of the matter is I wasn't stopped until
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:54.480]  the U.S. border. Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:59.440]  national sovereignty worldwide. But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in
[1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:04.000]  modern history, the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:08.240]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short
[1:16:08.240 --> 1:16:12.960]  time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the Info War,

[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:54.720]  Hello, Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and
[1:16:54.720 --> 1:16:59.920]  understand the risks of deficit spending. Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise
[1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:04.080]  that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from
[1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:08.880]  their accounts. A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in
[1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:13.440]  reserve for immediate withdrawal. Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government
[1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:18.480]  is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy. A current effort
[1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:23.280]  is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:28.320]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[1:17:28.320 --> 1:17:32.880]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:37.920]  investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver. While paper investments currently
[1:17:37.920 --> 1:17:43.760]  have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years. For more information,
[1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:53.200]  call 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237. Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond. You can now get
[1:17:53.200 --> 1:17:58.560]  the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.

[1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:08.880]  and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days. The package contains six DVDs
[1:18:08.880 --> 1:18:14.000]  that contain ten different programs, two books that combined over a thousand pages and other

[1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:52.720]  for this massive package of information is only $10, $15 for U.P.S. Grounds or $30 outside the U.S.
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:57.280]  Once America was led by real politicians, now politicians in the U.S., City, County, State,
[1:18:57.280 --> 1:19:01.360]  and Federal are owned and controlled by corporations. We have corporate representatives
[1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:05.520]  instead of politicians. Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar
[1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:09.920]  to the highest levels in history. Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:14.400]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation. Food riots and breadlines
[1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:18.320]  occurred daily in 30 nations and not only is that list growing, but it's headed this way.
[1:19:18.320 --> 1:19:22.400]  Survival enterprises are massive distributors of the highest quality long-term storage foods.
[1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:25.840]  Mountain House freeze-dried foods, canned beef, chicken, turkey, butter, bacon,
[1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:31.440]  spices, cheese, fruit, and more. We have tons of food in stock now. Call 1-800-753-1981.

[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:43.680]  what you need to keep you and your loved ones secure. And remember, those without food will
[1:19:43.680 --> 1:20:09.760]  be servants of those with the food. Call now. And when they stopped me, they recognized who I was.
[1:20:09.760 --> 1:20:22.800]  I drive an RV. They sent me over to the inspection area. And I was inspected and he knew who I was.
[1:20:23.440 --> 1:20:31.360]  Guess what they confiscated from me? What? This is Homeland Security for you. My dog's dog food.
[1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:37.680]  Keeping us safe from al-Qaeda. Gotta stop that dog food. Now here's the thing that troubled me.
[1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:43.280]  This was dog food. I have a very special dog. And I carried the dog food from Minnesota to
[1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:49.920]  Mexico and back and I bring enough. And so the dog food was purchased in the United States.
[1:20:49.920 --> 1:20:56.640]  It just was taken out of its original wrapper. Well, they had to, they had to authority over it.
[1:20:56.640 --> 1:21:03.040]  By word, Alex, when I said that to them and said, but this is United States dog food,
[1:21:03.040 --> 1:21:08.800]  it didn't matter that I vouched for it. And the fact that only my dog would be eating it.
[1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:14.880]  It wasn't like I was bringing in, you know, 30 cartons worth of Mexican dog food.
[1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:21.680]  I'm a private vehicle carrying dog food and they confiscated it. Well, the point is that
[1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:26.560]  criminals are running wild, murder and crime is way up. And meanwhile, Homeland Security's
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:32.480]  taking over almost every federal agency. And you have a former governor, you know, an individual
[1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:36.880]  who is well known to everybody. And they had to have that little enforcement,
[1:21:36.880 --> 1:21:41.760]  that little, we're the boss, you did something wrong. They're training Americans how to be slaves.
[1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:47.840]  I don't know about that, but I thought it was utterly ridiculous that they confiscate dog food
[1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:53.280]  from you when you, when you stated it originated here. What about your word? Doesn't that mean
[1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:58.560]  anything anymore today? No, it means nothing to them. Let's go back, governor, to when out of
[1:21:58.560 --> 1:22:03.360]  the gates, you talked about the media attacking you, but the media saying how dare you question
[1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:09.600]  the official 9-11 story, never addressing any of the specific facts you listed. So we were talking
[1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:13.760]  during the break and you said you'd like to go through the scientific evidence from another
[1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:19.760]  perspective. Let's talk about 9-11. Well, okay. I'll come out of a little more
[1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:23.840]  from the professional standpoint and make it out. Maybe I'll make it on a rally again.
[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:32.320]  I served three years with the Navy underwater demolition team 12 West Coast. And our specialty
[1:22:32.320 --> 1:22:38.560]  and what I was trained in was blowing things up. And from a professional standpoint and watching
[1:22:38.560 --> 1:22:46.000]  how these three buildings fell, it sure looks like demolition to me. And I believe I have an eye
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:51.760]  for it, you know, having been trained in it and trained by the best that our military has.
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:58.800]  And, you know, and especially building number seven, no doubt on that one. When you look at it
[1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:05.040]  from my viewpoint, that looks like demolition explosions bringing it down. And I view that
[1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:13.040]  as a member of the underwater demolition team. But then we have them staging the Gulf of Tonkin.
[1:23:13.040 --> 1:23:19.680]  We have our own government staging the attack on Iran. And now the White House admits they funded
[1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:26.000]  real Wahhabist al-Qaeda, number three in al-Qaeda, has been going on for four years to attack Iran
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:31.120]  and staged terror attacks there. A former general came out on Fox earlier this week
[1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:35.600]  and said that we need to, quote, have terror attacks inside Iran. But then the media turns
[1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:40.400]  around and says Iran is al-Qaeda when Iran is Shiite. I mean, that's incredible when our
[1:23:40.400 --> 1:23:46.480]  government's funding real al-Qaeda to attack Iran, but then saying Iran is also al-Qaeda.
[1:23:47.040 --> 1:23:52.160]  Well, I can't answer to that because I'm not as privy as you on that information. Remember,
[1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:59.120]  I just returned from Mexico and I don't get all the news that you get on that. So I can't really
[1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:04.320]  respond to that at all. I can only listen to what you have to say and be appalled over if it's indeed
[1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:11.360]  true. Let's go back and look at 9-11 from this angle. Why did you decide? I mean, I interviewed
[1:24:11.360 --> 1:24:16.960]  you in June of 2006, almost two years ago. You said, I have questions, Operation Northwoods.
[1:24:16.960 --> 1:24:22.800]  I have questions, Gulf of Tonk, and other staged events. But you went that far. And then last time,
[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:26.640]  I didn't press you on 9-11, you brought it up during a break and said, I'd like to talk about it.
[1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:31.440]  Why did you decide to take that plunge and go ahead and write about it and question in your
[1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:37.760]  book and then go even further on my show? I mean, what spurred me to do it? First of all,
[1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:43.920]  I was like everyone. I couldn't comprehend where did I want to believe the worst. And we all know
[1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:49.280]  what the worst is. And then when it happened, I also was embarrassed a little bit that when it
[1:24:49.280 --> 1:24:54.800]  happened, I went on full military mode. I didn't question anything because I was the governor
[1:24:54.800 --> 1:25:00.960]  at the time. And I feel bad about that now because I could have been even more powerful then
[1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:06.800]  in questioning it. But I didn't because, again, I kind of went on military mode. Our country's been
[1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:14.880]  attacked. I believed what I was told, believed it, and went accordingly. Well, then after I got out
[1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:19.840]  of office shortly thereafter, and of course, the invasion of Iraq happened, which I opposed,
[1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:27.680]  I couldn't understand why if Al Qaeda indeed truly attacked us, why would we not be fighting them
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:34.000]  in Afghanistan? Instead, we're focusing and going in this other direction to Iraq, who had nothing
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  to do with any of it. In fact, Saddam Hussein feared Al Qaeda as a problem for him. So it didn't
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:48.320]  make sense to me on that aspect. And so what we invaded Iraq was when I truly, truly started
[1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:54.000]  to question President Bush and his policies, because I opposed that war before it even happened.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:01.600]  And that's when I thought that my son kept on me. He kept telling me about this loose change that
[1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:08.400]  was on the Internet, and I'm not very savvy to the Internet generally. And finally, he kept on
[1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:12.960]  me saying, you've got to watch this. And I kept even fighting with him, saying, come on, Ty, you
[1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:19.040]  can't believe everything on the Internet. There's no way these guys had to have attacked us, blah,
[1:26:19.040 --> 1:26:24.160]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, then we got home from Mexico a couple years ago,
[1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:30.400]  and one Sunday afternoon, my wife and I both said, you know, let's watch that loose change thing that
[1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:35.280]  my son keeps telling you about. And so we had an hour or whatever it was, we went up to the
[1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:41.360]  computer room and we watched it. And when I watched it, it hit me like this punch in the stomach,
[1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:46.880]  the things that are brought up in it. So your instincts, your instincts then
[1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:53.680]  picks up the truth of it. Yeah. Well, I guess you'd call it my instincts. I just,
[1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:59.360]  as I watched it and started putting things together in the fact that why would George Bush
[1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:18.480]  drag his feet on any investigation? I put myself in that position as a governor or as a president.
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:26.160]  Governor Jesse Ventura, author of the new book, it's on the best seller list, a bunch of the
[1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:30.560]  different best seller list. Don't start the revolution without me. We have links where you
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:34.560]  can get it at infowars.com, but it's in stores everywhere. We're going to talk more about that
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:40.080]  before he leaves us. Governor Ventura, you were going over during that last segment that some
[1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:45.440]  stations didn't get. Why hasn't there been an investigation when there's an investigation
[1:27:46.480 --> 1:27:51.680]  of a cop having an auto accident and getting hurt? Well, there's an investigation of a jumbo jet
[1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:57.440]  blowing up or an investigation of the bridge collapse. I mean, it's not just that. Then we
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:01.920]  have how they've used 9-11 to take our liberties and freedoms and how they directed us at the
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:07.120]  wrong country. Like you mentioned, Iraq and Afghanistan and how Bush then said, I'm not
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:12.960]  looking for bin Laden. I don't care where he is. And now how they're using anti-terror laws against
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:17.680]  the American people and federalizing everything. Can you give me your take on that governor?
[1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:24.400]  Well, I certainly don't like it. We're called the United States of America. And that means
[1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:32.320]  states' rights. And many things I think states' rights should prevail. We always have a constant
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:39.120]  takeover by the federal government going on. And we have to stand up to it and you have to
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:46.080]  find a way to do it because we don't want to be the United States with no states.
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:49.760]  And that's the direction we seem to be going at it.
[1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:23.440]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place,
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:28.800]  the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us. Only getting our food supply
[1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:36.160]  immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future. Call 800-409-5633.

[1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:55.920]  It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States
[1:29:55.920 --> 1:30:00.800]  create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue. With never ending late fees over the
[1:30:00.800 --> 1:30:05.520]  limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay
[1:30:05.520 --> 1:30:10.480]  all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors. The federal debt relief system has created a
[1:30:10.480 --> 1:30:15.280]  successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans,
[1:30:15.280 --> 1:30:19.120]  lines of credit and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:23.440]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:27.360]  ending with nothing on your credit report. Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe
[1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:31.520]  with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt. Instead of living each
[1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:36.000]  day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around. Call the Federal

[1:30:53.760 --> 1:30:58.800]  hijacked our government and began the process of trying to destroy the United States of America.
[1:30:58.800 --> 1:31:04.160]  If we the American citizens do not intervene immediately they will succeed. It is time we

[1:31:47.440 --> 1:31:54.080]  That's RightToRedress.com. I used to be ashamed of my toenails. I thought I was destined to wear
[1:31:54.080 --> 1:31:59.120]  socks and tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes in the sand at the beach,
[1:31:59.120 --> 1:32:05.360]  but then I heard about Nonex Nail Gel. It tackles the problem of unsightly nails by clearing out
[1:32:05.360 --> 1:32:12.320]  the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup. With regular use, Nonex Gel breaks down
[1:32:12.320 --> 1:32:18.400]  and removes this debris so nails look clear. I confess I was skeptical in the beginning,
[1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:24.560]  but I stuck with it using Nonex Gel twice daily. Actually, I was surprised how generously sized
[1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:30.960]  the bottle is and how long it lasts. A while ago you could look at my nails and, well,
[1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:37.600]  glance away, but not anymore. Now my toenails look better than ever and I'm wearing sandals again,
[1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:44.720]  thanks to a simple natural gel. If your toenails are an embarrassment, try Nonex Nail Gel. It's
[1:32:44.720 --> 1:32:49.120]  available in the foot care aisle of your drugstore, mass retailer, or super center.
[1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:24.000]  you
[1:34:01.840 --> 1:34:06.320]  That was one of my big disappointments. George Bush, when he first took office, he said that he
[1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:10.560]  was going to be a whole federal-style president powered in the states, which I agreed with.
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:18.480]  And every decision he's made has been just the opposite. And case in point, what is it now?
[1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:24.000]  11 or 12 states have voted for medicinal use of marijuana, and yet the federal government won't
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:31.680]  allow it. Or again, I know twice has voted for dignity and death, that if you're not going to
[1:34:31.680 --> 1:34:36.880]  live and you're dying, you have the right to be in control of your life, and the federal government
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:44.640]  says no. And so things like that are very disturbing to me because I like to have an option in this
[1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:50.000]  country that the state that I live in thinks a lot like me, and I have the option in which to
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:55.200]  live there. But more and more, I'm seeing that lead, so I tend to live in Mexico more today.
[1:34:56.800 --> 1:35:01.200]  Would you say that in any respects, a third-world country like Mexico has more freedoms than we
[1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:06.640]  have here? Well, I put it to you this way. I could still go in the bar and have a cigar at a sports event.
[1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:15.120]  Smoke a cigar in the bar, you can't hear. Well, that's the control freak nanny state,
[1:35:15.120 --> 1:35:20.160]  which is just... You know, I mean, I say that laughingly. The other thing is too, Mexico,
[1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:23.920]  I'm not saying Mexico is a great government, but at least you know they're corrupt.
[1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:30.880]  I agree. So you know that going in. But the thing that I find where I live, there's nobody
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:36.880]  of government anywhere around. So you just govern yourselves and we all get along great.
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:43.600]  It's like a libertarian paradise where I'm at. You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right.
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:49.200]  You know, I take care of myself, Alex, and my family, and we help each other. My neighbors help,
[1:35:49.200 --> 1:35:54.240]  if they need help, you pull each other out of the ditch because I live in a pretty rugged area,
[1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:59.200]  and everyone pitches in, and it doesn't require government at all, even though there's all these
[1:35:59.200 --> 1:36:04.720]  laws and everything. Hey, if they're not around, they don't apply to anybody. Just take care of
[1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:10.480]  each other. What kind of dog you got, Governor? I have a Belgian Malinois. Oh, those are neat dogs.
[1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:16.000]  Oh, yeah. He's so smart when he arrived here. He was literate in three languages,
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:22.240]  which made him the smartest in the house. He's soon learning Spanish, number four.
[1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:26.560]  Amazing. We're going to break and come back with our final segment with the Governor,
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:29.120]  unless I can twist his arm to stay even longer, maybe to the end of the hour.
[1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:34.080]  But I want to come back and talk some about the book. I want to talk about a Senate run.
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:37.680]  Let's go ahead and get into that now. I mean, are you going to run for the Senate or how long
[1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:43.040]  until we know? Here's how I feel right now. I don't know yet. I have to July to decide.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:50.480]  I feel like this. I believe strongly that on every ballot, federal, local, or whatever,
[1:36:50.480 --> 1:36:54.960]  there should be none of the above. So you can vote a vote of no confidence in your government.
[1:36:54.960 --> 1:37:01.440]  With this deficit, we should have no confidence in them. And I may offer myself up as that because
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:07.760]  it doesn't officially, it isn't officially on the ballot, none of the above. But if I go file and
[1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:14.400]  put Jesse Ventura down, I then become none of the above. And so any disgruntled voter,
[1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:20.800]  and all I'll try to do at that point is run a very minimal campaign. And all I ask is to be
[1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:26.960]  alive in the debates. Because if I can debate them, I can beat them. Well, no doubt we need your
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:33.280]  voice in the US Senate because you are a maverick. You are a somewhat of a renegade. And you're only
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:38.400]  a renegade because you're what we call an old fashioned American independence, liberty, freedom.
[1:37:38.960 --> 1:37:45.040]  And we need you. So I would certainly support you from Texas for a run for the Minnesota Senate,
[1:37:45.040 --> 1:37:49.680]  because you could certainly wreak havoc on their plans and use a bully pulpit up there
[1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:53.760]  to expose what they're doing. So Governor, we totally support you. We're going to be back
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:59.120]  in three minutes with Governor Jesse Ventura. And we'll also talk about his new book,
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:02.880]  Don't Stop Revolution Without Me. So I'm drafting you, Governor. I think you need to go ahead and
[1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:20.640]  run for the Senate. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:42.000]  And we have a short time left with Governor Ventura. So I'm going to try to move quickly.
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:48.560]  Governor, final comment on 9-11. I want to play you a clip that came out and was in major
[1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:53.520]  newspapers last week. You may have missed it, where I'm sure you've heard about how they,
[1:38:53.520 --> 1:39:00.640]  all these major quote, wartime correspondence or experts they have on Fox, CNN, MSNBC,
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:04.880]  are really on the Pentagon payroll. They're all former generals, of course, and colonels,
[1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:09.600]  and that they're putting out unified propaganda. They now release hundreds of hours of these tapes
[1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:13.600]  and on the tape, they say, wouldn't another terror attack get the people behind the war?
[1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:18.080]  We have Republican memos saying the same thing. And Rumsfeld says, yeah, the cure for the people
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:22.960]  not wanting to go into Iran and other places is another attack. Here's that one minute clip.
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:28.400]  I want to get your take on this. I mean, this president is pretty much a victim of success.
[1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:37.440]  He's been in attack here in five years. Help fill in the perception that the threat is so low
[1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:46.400]  in society that he's not surprising that the behavior pattern reflects a low threat assessment.
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:55.440]  And he said he was in Europe with a low threat perception. The connection for that, I suppose,
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:40:03.200]  is kind of fat. And when that happens, then everyone gets energized for another person.
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:08.240]  And it's a shame. We don't have the maturity to recognize that.
[1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:11.680]  So the American people don't have the maturity to give up their liberty. So there's got to be
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:17.840]  another attack. The PNAC documents written by Dick Cheney in September of 2000 called for massive
[1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:23.440]  Pearl Harbor events to mobilize the empire. The Brazilian book, Grand Chess Board, calls for
[1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:29.760]  giant terror attacks. Your take on that, sir? First of all, I got to apologize. There was
[1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:37.040]  a lot of static on there. My years are not any better than they used to be before I had a hard
[1:40:37.040 --> 1:40:41.040]  time hearing it clearly. Let me just tell you what he says. He says, quote,
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:47.120]  the correction for the people not wanting military action is another attack. And he said,
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:52.400]  that's the cure for it. But barring, having another one of those, the people don't support the war.
[1:40:52.400 --> 1:40:58.720]  And who said this? Donald Rumsfeld. Wow. Well, you know, if this stuff's true,
[1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:04.960]  then my book is right on. We've got to have a revolution and take our country back.
[1:41:05.920 --> 1:41:10.800]  Well, I agree. The book is on a bunch of the bestseller list. I mean,
[1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:13.680]  why did you decide to write the book? Don't set a revolution without me.
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:18.800]  Well, as a wait-but-call, I actually, with two New York Times bestsellers, I, you know,
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:24.240]  I got paid great front money and all that to do those books. This book I did with Nug. I wanted
[1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:30.160]  to do it down in Mexico with Dick Russell. And we got together every week and we'd work on it.
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:35.760]  And I wanted it to be more of a message and a wake-up call to try to wake up the United States
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:41.520]  of America, that the two-party system is corrupt, and that the two-party system, that you have to
[1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:47.360]  change the system in which to change the government. And we've got to wake up to that fact,
[1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:53.520]  because if we don't, we could very much lose the republic, because that's what Thomas Jefferson
[1:41:53.520 --> 1:42:00.000]  warned about. That's what John Adams warned about, that political parties would eventually
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:04.800]  strangle the republic, because decisions would be made on behalf of the political party,
[1:42:05.360 --> 1:42:08.400]  not on behalf of the republic. And that's what we're getting today.
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:14.960]  Interesting case in point, you know, and we'll tie it back to 9-11 a little. I find it very
[1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:20.240]  interesting that the Whitewater investigation, which, you know, in the end, all it did was turn
[1:42:20.240 --> 1:42:26.480]  up that the president cheated on his life with an intern. They spent $100 million on that.
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:35.280]  For 9-11, they only spent $9 million. And I find that peculiar that, you know, thousands of people
[1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:41.120]  were killed in one, and nobody died. And the other one that I know of where they couldn't prove maybe
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:47.280]  one person did, I guess they talk about it, but they spent $100 million to investigate that.
[1:42:47.280 --> 1:42:50.480]  What do you think of Barack Obama and Hillary wanting socialized?
[1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:55.120]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced
[1:42:55.120 --> 1:42:59.520]  alkaline environment. But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress,
[1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:04.800]  acidic diet, and lack of exercise. pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect
[1:43:04.800 --> 1:43:09.680]  health, as well as prevention of disease. People who alkalize the water they drink experience
[1:43:09.680 --> 1:43:14.960]  normalize blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight. It was intended for human beings to drink
[1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:20.080]  alkaline water. But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic. The fact is that
[1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:24.800]  disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment. Fat accumulates if a person consumes
[1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:30.320]  too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it. Do your part. Alkalize and supercharge
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:35.520]  your body now. Alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate
[1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:40.640]  that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:54.960]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft
[1:45:54.960 --> 1:46:00.480]  each year. The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of
[1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:06.320]  $8,000. If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication and often the only protection

[1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:24.320]  And he said easy. He said because they spend a million dollars for a job that pays a hundred
[1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:29.520]  grand a year. Absolutely. The evidence is right there. That's what one of my grandparents always
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:36.000]  said. And so I make it a point that when I run for office, I do not spend more money than what I
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:42.880]  will make. Now as a U.S. Senator, I will make close to $950,000 through the course of that
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:48.400]  six-year thing. So that means I could probably spend about three quarters of a million to get
[1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:56.000]  the job, but I will not spend over that. And if I do it, I decide in July because I believe these
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:01.840]  campaigns are far too long and far too expensive. Well, we need you also during this national
[1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:06.560]  election cycle to be injecting sanity and that will up your profile if you run for Senate. I
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:10.960]  think it's a no-brainer. I'm begging you to do it. We need you to do this, Governor. The problem
[1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:16.880]  is that Alex is then I have to do it. Then you can't go surfing. That's right. Then I can't go
[1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:22.320]  down the Baha and watch sunsets down there and take my surfboard out and fall down as I try to
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:27.360]  learn how to do it. Absolute heaven down there. I certainly envy you down there. No one watching
[1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:32.640]  over me. No big brother telling you. No big brothers down there. Do you know what I also do
[1:48:32.640 --> 1:48:38.320]  with all my new vehicles? I disconnect that on Star. Which tracks you, yes, sir. Absolutely.
[1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:43.680]  Do people think that they can track you anywhere you go if you got that hooked up on your vehicle?
[1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:46.800]  Governor, I want to run through a bunch of questions quickly because we're almost out of
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:52.880]  time. A government drug dealing. They had a CIA aircraft right at four tons of pure cocaine,
[1:48:52.880 --> 1:48:58.720]  showing it came from the source. One of the CIA rendition flights, same plane, CIA owned,
[1:48:58.720 --> 1:49:04.240]  crashed in Yucatan Peninsula. Nothing on our press all over the foreign press with the CIA
[1:49:04.240 --> 1:49:10.240]  pilot killed the people on board filled with pure cocaine. Now, should we decriminalize drugs A and
[1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:15.840]  B? The experts I've had on here believe that over 85% of all narcotics is brought in and licensed
[1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:21.040]  by the government. Well, I think absolutely we should decriminalize it because of the fact that
[1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:28.400]  when I was in Mexico, the Virginia Tech thing happened. And the headlines in Mexico said USA
[1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:34.080]  33, Mexico 20 because that day there were 20 people killed and the war on drugs on the border,
[1:49:34.080 --> 1:49:39.680]  only differences. There's happens every day. And now it's spread all the way up into Indiana,
[1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:45.040]  up into Dallas. Quote military, our government trained or now quote helping the Mexican drug
[1:49:45.040 --> 1:49:50.240]  cartels. I don't know anything about that. Oh yeah, that was that was finally in the
[1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:54.880]  Houston Chronicle. Just a side issue. What do you, I know he's your buddy. I know you've been in
[1:49:54.880 --> 1:50:00.560]  some films with him like running man and predator. And I know you're a loyal person, but Schwarzenegger,
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:06.560]  you talk about big government gun control on on a lot of these issues. What do you think of the job
[1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:13.120]  Schwarzenegger's done as governor? Well, remember this Arnold Arnold is not a true Republican.
[1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:18.720]  Arnold is very liberal on the social issues, much like I am. I don't care about gay marriage. It's
[1:50:18.720 --> 1:50:25.600]  none of my business, things of that nature. So and remember Arnold Arnold's also a populist.
[1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:31.200]  He tried the hard line Republican position in California and he got hammered. His popularity
[1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:36.800]  went down the toilet. So he made a turn. And now he's doing things that apparently the Californians
[1:50:36.800 --> 1:50:43.440]  are more popular with. But what about Arnold? Arnold is not a dummy. You know, Arnold knows
[1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:47.680]  where his bread gets buttered, depending on what he's doing. Yeah, but you can do that too. You
[1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:52.080]  could go with how the bread's buttered and probably be president. I mean, there is a difference here.
[1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:56.640]  You're not for gun control. You're not for drug criminalization. Arnold is.
[1:50:57.360 --> 1:51:02.240]  Well, I don't think Arnold's for drug criminalization, is he? Because he's not bothering
[1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:06.320]  the pot shops out there for the medical stuff. He lets the feds come in and go after him. He
[1:51:06.320 --> 1:51:12.320]  hasn't been trying to repeal these. But the point is he can't stop the feds anyway.
[1:51:12.320 --> 1:51:17.680]  So good jurisdiction takes priority over state. Otherwise, if I was governor,
[1:51:17.680 --> 1:51:23.120]  I could stop our national guard people from going to Iraq. When's the last time you
[1:51:23.120 --> 1:51:28.160]  talked to Arnold? Has he read your book? I have never talked to him since he took office.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:33.440]  Well, I know that he said that he modeled a lot of his campaign off the fact that he saw that you
[1:51:33.440 --> 1:51:39.280]  could win. That may be true, but I haven't spoken to him at all. I stopped by one time when I was
[1:51:39.280 --> 1:51:45.040]  taught giving a speech in Sacramento, and he had already gone home, you know, back to LA.
[1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:49.200]  And so he wasn't in that day. I just left a note for him and gave him my best regards,
[1:51:49.200 --> 1:51:58.080]  and I haven't talked or heard from him since. Jesse, talking about the police state all over
[1:51:58.080 --> 1:52:02.400]  the country now, they don't just do repelizers. They're taking blood at checkpoints from Illinois
[1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:08.320]  to Texas, from Arizona to New York State. They're now having, quote, federalization drills where
[1:52:08.320 --> 1:52:14.160]  they get tens of thousands of police in three, four state areas to randomly search pedestrians now,
[1:52:14.160 --> 1:52:20.640]  not just cars set up checkpoints. What's your take on that? Well, if it's true, we're in tough
[1:52:20.640 --> 1:52:26.800]  shape. The only thing I can comment on is what goes on in my life, and I am concerned because
[1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:33.120]  when I crossed the border this year, inside the border was a second immigration checkpoint. Well,
[1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:38.080]  according to the Constitution of the United States, once I show at the border that I'm a
[1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:44.400]  U.S. citizen, I should not be required to be asked any type of identification as I travel
[1:52:44.400 --> 1:52:48.560]  throughout the continental United States. And now they're building those deeper and deeper over
[1:52:48.560 --> 1:52:54.000]  a hundred miles in, and they're going after citizens. Oh, yeah. Everybody, like the car in
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:59.360]  front of me, I saw the people showing passports near from California. Well, for some reason,
[1:52:59.360 --> 1:53:04.400]  they waved me through because I turned to my life and I go, I am not, I'm going to see if the
[1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:09.600]  Constitution protects me. I will not show these people anything, even though they're immigration.
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:14.640]  What happened? I'm a U.S. citizen. If it's a state trooper, that's different. You're on a highway
[1:53:14.640 --> 1:53:20.640]  that you show your driver's license. But as a U.S. citizen, I am not required to show anything.
[1:53:20.640 --> 1:53:25.360]  What happened? What happened? I travel throughout the country. The Constitution guarantees me that.
[1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:32.800]  Governor, what happened when you did that? For some reason, they always waved me through it.
[1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:38.000]  Every time they don't question or do anything, I get waved through. So I don't get a chance to
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:44.240]  really turn them down because they never asked me for anything. But it is racial profiling because
[1:53:44.240 --> 1:53:47.600]  I happen to have blue eyes. That might be part of the reason I'm waved through.
[1:53:49.600 --> 1:53:54.320]  Unbelievable. Governor, we have a little bit of issue with the line. Can you hear me?
[1:53:54.320 --> 1:53:59.520]  Sure. Okay, good. We went to back up there. I'm in Texas there in Minnesota. This only happens.
[1:53:59.520 --> 1:54:05.600]  We got a huge guest on with us. Governor, in closing with the three or four minutes,
[1:54:05.600 --> 1:54:10.640]  we've got left other points, other key issues that you want to impart. Anything else on 9-11?
[1:54:10.640 --> 1:54:13.360]  Anything else you want to talk about with the future of this republic?
[1:54:13.360 --> 1:54:18.720]  Well, the main thing I want to talk about is the fact that we better wake up and we better
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:24.800]  pay attention and not to believe everything that the status quo tells you because
[1:54:24.800 --> 1:54:30.640]  they're not necessarily talking the truth. And I'm finding that out more and more and more.
[1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:36.080]  And I personally have no trust in the government anymore because they've been so deceitful to
[1:54:36.080 --> 1:54:42.640]  me on everything, it seems. And that we've got to change. And I think the other thing I'd like
[1:54:42.640 --> 1:54:48.400]  to bring out is this. Having lived outside of the United States now for three years in a row for
[1:54:48.400 --> 1:54:55.440]  half the year, my belief is that you're not a word pirate by tearing a club and beating everyone up.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:00.240]  And our status throughout the world is dropped dramatically now.
[1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:04.160]  The most popular T-shirt you see in Mexico amongst young people now
[1:55:04.880 --> 1:55:08.560]  is a photo of George Bush and it says, Weapon of Mass Destruction.
[1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:15.360]  And I really don't think it should be part of as the United States and it's time for us to change
[1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:22.000]  direction. So when Obama says about talking to our enemies, I see nothing wrong with that because
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:29.120]  it should be the last option. Where should never be the first option is what we've made it today.
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:34.480]  Well, you're right, Governor. Our name has been destroyed and these so-called conservatives
[1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:38.640]  that still support the war, A, they're against the will of the people, only 30% support the war
[1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:46.320]  still, and B, they have bankrupted us. The dollar's being devalued, inflation is in double digits.
[1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:53.360]  The fellow reserves denying it, but oil just went to 130 a barrel today. 130 a barrel.
[1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:56.320]  Did I tell you my take on oil? No, sir.
[1:55:56.320 --> 1:56:01.360]  I think this is what's happening on oil. I think they're driving the price up
[1:56:01.360 --> 1:56:05.840]  to battle the environmentalists. I think they want to get drilling in Alaska,
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:11.280]  they want to get offshore drilling. This is a ploy by the oil companies, in my opinion,
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:17.040]  to drive the price up to where the American people will say it's $5 a gallon. I don't care about the
[1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:22.480]  environment drill. I've got to have my gas. Well, that's a part of it, I think. But largely,
[1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:27.920]  the dollar has been devalued. Oil is dollar denominated. And so the dollar's been devalued
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:32.320]  by more than half. Oil's going to double. Oh, yeah. That matter, too. Very good point.
[1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:38.640]  Very good point. I noticed that in Minnesota, because we had some of our local guys at work,
[1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:43.360]  the network came out and shot some video of you talking, and you wouldn't address the press,
[1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:47.200]  but you would address them. Why were you not talking to the mainstream press?
[1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:51.760]  Well, I talked to the mainstream press, except not the Minnesota mainstream press.
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:56.960]  I've made it my personal vendetta that I never speak to them again, because when I was in the
[1:56:56.960 --> 1:57:03.440]  office, they attacked my children. And so the only way I can fight back is to not talk to them,
[1:57:03.440 --> 1:57:09.280]  not make them money. And so I speak to the open press in Boston. I speak to them in LA,
[1:57:10.160 --> 1:57:14.960]  anywhere else, but I will not speak to the Minnesota media, because it's my personal
[1:57:14.960 --> 1:57:20.320]  vendetta against them. And, you know, us Navy SEALs, we don't get mad, we get even.
[1:57:20.320 --> 1:57:28.080]  That's our thing. And so my only way of getting even with them is to not speak to them. That's
[1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:33.760]  why I did speak to your people, but on purpose, I do not speak to them. And it is because they
[1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:39.280]  attacked my kids, my son refuses to live in Minnesota now. Governor Mincero, I want to
[1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:42.240]  say one more word to you during the mic. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. As you know,
[1:57:42.240 --> 1:57:46.480]  GCN is a huge supporter of Ron Paul, and all he stands for. That's why, for a limited time,
[1:57:46.480 --> 1:57:50.880]  I have personally set aside commercial inventory-long advertisers the chance to show their personal
