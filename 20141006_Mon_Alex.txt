[01:24.040 --> 01:30.040]  daring to speak half-truths about ISIS see they're trying to spend this right now that this
[01:30.040 --> 01:41.000]  administration clearly funded al Qaeda in Iraq now known as ISIS or ISIL to confuse us and this
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.760]  is a major scandal in the government itself because people in the government are completely freaked
[01:46.760 --> 01:54.200]  out it's a kind of a come-to-jesus moment where they realize well our government really is running
[01:54.200 --> 02:00.760]  and funding al Qaeda it's all true the military's waking up it's just amazing and so they're busy
[02:00.760 --> 02:08.200]  trying to spin all of this right now and so Joe Biden has come out and said in a speech that yes
[02:08.200 --> 02:14.760]  Qatar and Saudi Arabia and Turkey and others have been funding ISIS well yeah with the US
[02:14.760 --> 02:21.400]  and NATO giving them the weapons and then giving them directly to al Qaeda and so now Biden's had

[08:09.880 --> 08:25.800]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[08:40.680 --> 08:55.800]  it was the 18th of september last month about three weeks ago when robert david steel
[08:57.480 --> 09:04.760]  a retired cia field commander has worked with the u.s army closely was recommended by colonel
[09:04.760 --> 09:10.760]  schaefer to come on this show and he predicted that they would launch an abola false flag terror
[09:10.760 --> 09:18.120]  attack in the united states and that it would actually be a simulant that made people sick
[09:18.680 --> 09:25.240]  but that it wouldn't actually even be abola but that they needed to get uh infected people into
[09:25.240 --> 09:31.240]  the country as a cover for what they were really going to do now the reason that interview was so
[09:31.240 --> 09:39.080]  important again this is the sixth day of october 2014 on this live monday edition the reason that's
[09:39.080 --> 09:46.760]  important is that colonel schaefer who blew the whistle on stratos ivy and a bunch of other secret
[09:47.640 --> 09:55.480]  operations conducted in and around afghanistan right before nine eleven able danger you name it
[09:55.480 --> 10:03.480]  he was over the program to kill al-qaeda leaders and they were continually ordered by the cia and
[10:03.480 --> 10:11.080]  by the white house not to drop hellfire missiles on a sum of bin laden and the rest of his leadership
[10:11.080 --> 10:19.720]  when they had him confirmed in their sights and c bell edmunds high level uh fbi nsa translator
[10:19.720 --> 10:25.640]  high level communication was picking up and confirming the chatter that he testified secretly to
[10:25.640 --> 10:32.280]  congress on now since then a lot of what he said has come out and been confirmed but he said i can't
[10:32.280 --> 10:36.760]  talk about a lot of this on air alex he said this on air but he also said it offered to me
[10:37.320 --> 10:41.640]  he said get robert david steel on he'll tell you what's really going on
[10:43.720 --> 10:48.520]  because he'd worked with him in army operations with the cia the actual arm of the cia that's
[10:48.520 --> 10:54.680]  actually on the ground actually fighting not the 98 percent that just sits around in offices all day
[10:54.680 --> 11:02.200]  showing off their cia coffee cups to each other so we got him on and he dropped bombshell after
[11:02.200 --> 11:08.920]  bombshell after bombshell after bombshell after bombshell and i just don't think people realized
[11:08.920 --> 11:15.320]  what they were hearing when he was on the show was a data dump well talked about this tomorrow
[11:15.320 --> 11:21.560]  of what's really being talked about inside the pentagon now i've tried to explain to everybody
[11:21.560 --> 11:25.480]  something here there's different factions in the army different factions in the navy different
[11:25.480 --> 11:31.400]  factions in the marines different factions in the air force different factions in the cia
[11:31.400 --> 11:38.280]  different factions in the fbi everybody knows that and the classic factions are black hats white hats
[11:39.480 --> 11:43.640]  and for the majority of this country's history there were more white hats than black hats
[11:43.640 --> 11:49.400]  a lot of boss hog corruption but there was no attempt to overthrow the country undermine it
[11:49.400 --> 11:54.920]  destroy the family bankrupt the country just no one would go along with that we now have
[11:54.920 --> 12:00.600]  running these agencies groups of people that are globalists who want to sacrifice american
[12:00.600 --> 12:08.040]  prosperity and freedom on the altar of globalism and so you now have the british military coming
[12:08.040 --> 12:13.880]  out last week and telling their government stop funding al-qaeda this is on the one telegraph
[12:13.880 --> 12:21.880]  yesterday i mean the headline i read it on the sunday show was british military commanders brass
[12:22.840 --> 12:27.720]  i'm paraphrasing they'll pull the headline up put it on screen for tv viewers radio listeners
[12:27.720 --> 12:34.600]  i'll read it out to you top british brass or top uk brass tell government to stop funding
[12:34.600 --> 12:43.880]  through gulf states terrorist groups and then we also see the pentagon coming out and saying
[12:43.880 --> 12:49.000]  that two weeks ago with the chairman of the joint chiefs general dempsi there's the headline army
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.880]  chiefs tell government stop gulf states funding terrorism joe biden comes out last week and says
[12:55.880 --> 13:00.920]  that katar and others are clearly funding terrorist i mean they're buying them the trucks the armored
[13:00.920 --> 13:05.080]  vehicles the weapons they're buying it from the u.s in nato they're giving it to them
[13:05.080 --> 13:09.960]  but the u.s in nato is also delivering it directly to them i've been harping on this forever
[13:12.280 --> 13:18.760]  because the public may not fully know what's going on but inside government it's what i call a come
[13:19.560 --> 13:26.920]  to jesus moment where oh my gosh our government is run by criminals that really are funding a
[13:26.920 --> 13:34.360]  worldwide jihad of global destabilization oh my gosh big mega banks really are shipping in the drugs
[13:34.360 --> 13:39.800]  running the aircraft and laundering the money oh my gosh the nsa really is spying on everybody
[13:39.800 --> 13:45.160]  political to blackmail them and control them it's not about keeping us safe oh my gosh it's all true
[13:45.160 --> 13:50.520]  oh my gosh we're going into a tyranny oh my gosh it's the worst the world's ever seen do we really
[13:50.520 --> 14:01.720]  want to do this and now people in government are looking because the facade has fallen
[14:04.120 --> 14:08.760]  the curtain has been pulled back the little man behind it it's that todo moment in wizard of us
[14:09.320 --> 14:13.560]  they're now going well who are these globalist what is the new order what's their end game what's
[14:13.560 --> 14:20.440]  their goal what's their ideology and then you find out what their ideology is pure anti-hensile
[14:20.440 --> 14:28.840]  human anti-decent seat overthrow of reality total playing god mental illness writ large
[14:30.040 --> 14:36.440]  and now humanity is starting to line up on which side they've chosen now it's clicking
[14:37.320 --> 14:44.360]  and the masses of good people around the world not just here in private industry in private life
[14:44.360 --> 14:50.040]  in government and corporations you name it are realizing everything is in danger prosperity
[14:50.040 --> 14:54.040]  the future you name it to basically a 21st century french revolution
[14:56.040 --> 15:00.520]  that will bring in super oppression not remove the problems that are there
[15:02.040 --> 15:08.200]  the system has been broken on design so that on its ashes a hellish scientific dictatorship
[15:08.200 --> 15:15.480]  can be built perpetual war for perpetual peace perpetual martial law the national
[15:15.480 --> 15:22.280]  stabilization force in every country secret police on every corner secret arrest just
[15:22.280 --> 15:30.840]  hell on earth a psychopath's dream a man who wants prosperity and security and honor a nightmare
[15:33.160 --> 15:37.720]  and you notice good people always get down until things are overwhelmingly against them
[15:37.720 --> 15:42.600]  and then that's when the good guys start standing up historically and the elite know that
[15:42.600 --> 15:45.960]  so they put a lot of things in place to try to stop that but it's not going to work
[15:48.920 --> 15:51.080]  we've not been hit flat footed by all this
[15:54.760 --> 16:00.760]  the liberty movement as ron paul said in that 2003 speech that's in my film matrix of evil
[16:00.760 --> 16:04.520]  he said they're going to collapse the world economy by design in the future and on its ashes
[16:04.520 --> 16:12.680]  bring in planetary dictatorship agenda 21 total managed economy by select groups to shut down
[16:12.680 --> 16:17.400]  all their competition we've got to get in place now to show they're the authors of it
[16:17.400 --> 16:23.560]  so that people will go to liberty and to true capitalism versus crony capitalism when the
[16:23.560 --> 16:29.320]  collapse comes that's our moment of opportunity to wake up as many people as we can beforehand
[16:29.320 --> 16:33.400]  so we're not caught flat footed well ladies and gentlemen we've not been caught flat footed
[16:33.400 --> 16:40.600]  we've been working around the clock worldwide the liberty movement to warn people about what's
[16:40.600 --> 16:46.680]  coming to expose the globalist program to break down how they create crises or exacerbate current
[16:46.680 --> 16:52.680]  crises to pose as saviors and to expose their modus operandi paradigm and once people have the
[16:52.680 --> 16:57.240]  blueprint they'll know what they're looking at and then they can go research it for themselves
[16:57.240 --> 17:02.280]  and find out we told the truth and then it's not rocket science you know the enemy once the enemy
[17:02.280 --> 17:15.400]  is identified once they have been spotlighted they are in deep trouble and they still got a
[17:15.400 --> 17:22.520]  lot of little tricks up their sleeve but at that point unless they basically decide to blow the
[17:22.520 --> 17:29.000]  planet up they can't go anywhere in the next six seven eight moves in this global chess game
[17:29.000 --> 17:37.320]  once the paradigm has shifted that there is a global corporate group anti free market sitting
[17:37.320 --> 17:42.680]  on top the nations playing us off against each other divide and conquer trying to create ignorance
[17:42.680 --> 17:47.480]  trying to destroy prosperity because it competes with their monopoly of power and their hegemon
[17:48.520 --> 17:54.680]  once that genie is out of the bottle once that cat is out of the bag once that train leaves the
[17:54.680 --> 18:01.320]  station it's over and by the way here's the little secret the train already left the station the
[18:01.320 --> 18:08.440]  genie already is out of the bottle they're just now trying to keep you from realizing that because
[18:08.440 --> 18:14.440]  the moment you realize that that's happened is the moment it's truly left the station it's kind
[18:14.440 --> 18:19.560]  of a mile down the road right now and they want to bomb it and blow it up before it gets too far
[18:19.560 --> 18:24.280]  not that that'll even save them but that's the best bet they've got is bring in Ebola start a
[18:24.280 --> 18:29.240]  war with Russia blow up some federal buildings blind the liberty movement the problem is our
[18:29.240 --> 18:33.880]  people are inside all the police departments they're inside the fbi the cia they're everywhere
[18:35.240 --> 18:40.200]  we are the majority minority in government the liberty movement and the system knows that
[18:40.200 --> 18:44.200]  their purges haven't worked what's going to happen when you blow up another mural building
[18:45.960 --> 18:51.160]  i'm talking to the globalist what's going to happen when you release smallpox or anthrax again
[18:51.160 --> 18:55.080]  what's going to happen when you put a drugged up kid on an airplane with a firecracker in his pants
[18:55.080 --> 18:58.520]  we're going to have two witnesses that are lawyers that are going to blow it wide open and congress
[18:58.520 --> 19:06.200]  is going to have to admit the cia got him on the airplane when you run your false flags you better
[19:06.200 --> 19:12.520]  do it at the north pole because we're watching everything you do and we know who's behind it
[19:12.520 --> 19:16.680]  and we know who the killers are and we know who the criminals are you understand that
[19:16.680 --> 19:22.680]  that and we know your plan we know your tricks we know your games jack so don't think you're not
[19:22.680 --> 19:28.840]  being watched don't think don't think that your whole nsa system has got everybody scared and
[19:28.840 --> 19:34.520]  suppressed because all the nsa systems becoming is a giant feedback loop to wake up everyone
[19:35.080 --> 19:40.680]  you gave 800 000 plus people access to total intelligence all you did was create a sieve
[19:40.680 --> 19:45.960]  to expose your operations you thought you'd use it to suppress people blowing your operations
[19:45.960 --> 19:53.560]  in your greed you blew your own operation humanity is rising the latest on abola the economy the

[24:45.400 --> 24:50.840]  they can't be shamed with me they can't be seen i think a few people could actually say the
[24:50.840 --> 25:04.120]  song applies to them that is the christian now let's cooper bring us in
[25:10.680 --> 25:14.760]  all right i want to open the phones up coming up in the next segment to discuss
[25:14.760 --> 25:21.000]  two different big issues hey how big of a deal is it
[25:22.680 --> 25:26.680]  that you've got joe biden obama and others trying to cover their booties
[25:26.680 --> 25:28.920]  you've got senator lindsay
[25:31.080 --> 25:36.840]  limp wrist graham and the rest of them running around doing the same thing
[25:38.440 --> 25:43.240]  going isn't it right general dempsey that none of our allies ever gave any weapons to ices
[25:43.240 --> 25:49.160]  and dempsey goes well of course they did and now the british military has come out and told
[25:49.160 --> 25:53.720]  their government stop arming them and our own military has been refusing for over a year and
[25:53.720 --> 26:01.640]  a half to be part of it there has been a mutiny following the constitution following their oath
[26:02.200 --> 26:07.160]  that's gotten almost no coverage where our military and where joint chief of staff chairman went
[26:07.160 --> 26:11.720]  remember a year and a half ago to the white house at midnight and told obama don't launch those air
[26:11.720 --> 26:17.960]  strikes tomorrow or there is going to be problems when thousands of our military put out tweets
[26:17.960 --> 26:25.720]  holding up signs officers saying i did not sign up to fight for al qaeda in syria against Assad
[26:28.360 --> 26:32.520]  and so they rearmed them let them take over the middle east and they're now trying to spin it that
[26:32.520 --> 26:38.920]  oh our allies weren't even involved we weren't involved because this could bring down the entire
[26:38.920 --> 26:44.760]  system ladies and gentlemen they have gone way too far now if they get away with this that's why
[26:44.760 --> 26:49.640]  walter jones the congressman is joining us if they get away with this the sky's the limit
[26:54.360 --> 27:00.760]  and that's why the the globalist technicians that these social engineers only do things if it helps
[27:00.760 --> 27:10.040]  them on a whole bunch of fronts they're obsessed with that they can make hundreds of billions if
[27:10.040 --> 27:14.680]  there's a global pandemic of Ebola on a vaccine hundreds of billions of the next decade conservatively
[27:14.680 --> 27:18.440]  that's not even the big reason they can bring in a medical tyranny of oppression and control
[27:18.440 --> 27:26.120]  that's more important but currently it's good as a political smokescreen and helps push federalization
[27:26.120 --> 27:31.240]  once the crisis gets going kind of like female order to stand down in katrina and then a year
[27:31.240 --> 27:38.360]  later got doubled their funding for disasters they failure is rewarded so you fail to get more money
[27:40.280 --> 27:43.560]  no other country's ever done things that way we've never done it either but that's the new system
[27:43.560 --> 27:51.640]  the last 15 years or so in the united states and it becomes a political distraction while
[27:51.640 --> 27:56.600]  obama's got executive orders on open borders executive orders on getting rid of our power plants
[27:56.600 --> 28:01.800]  executive orders on military executive orders on everything under the sun carbon taxes you name it
[28:01.800 --> 28:08.280]  while all of this is happening we're hearing abola abola abola abola abola and they set the
[28:08.280 --> 28:15.640]  president to say oh like the cdc head said saturday oh if we don't let people come in and out that
[28:15.640 --> 28:22.680]  could spread it keeping them there craft flying back and forth that stops it that's like saying
[28:22.680 --> 28:27.400]  you know taking a hatchet to your fingers stops them from bleeding or shooting yourself in the
[28:27.400 --> 28:31.800]  head with rift 7 magnum is good for you i mean it's just two plus two equals whatever i say
[28:36.120 --> 28:42.600]  it's all part of overthrowing reality as governor gendall said he said this is absolutely
[28:42.600 --> 28:50.520]  the diametric opposite of common sense i'll give you his exact quote scroll down on that for me
[28:51.880 --> 28:53.320]  the exact quote was um
[28:58.440 --> 29:05.400]  he said this defies logic not halt defies logic not halting flights as france and england and
[29:05.400 --> 29:10.680]  everybody else and the ua and everybody else is done but instead they have a guy get up there from
[29:10.680 --> 29:16.280]  the cdc the director and say no this is no big deal well then why didn't you ever let abola
[29:16.280 --> 29:22.520]  patients send before why would you halt flights from countries with pandemics before it's all
[29:22.520 --> 29:27.320]  about setting the precedent they can do whatever they want whenever they want more on abola straight
[29:27.320 --> 29:33.080]  ahead i'll give out the number we'll take your phone calls we're also going to get into a bunch
[29:33.080 --> 29:40.600]  of other important news 62 million people in us now speak different language at home as english
[29:40.600 --> 29:44.760]  begins to die in the united states well sure you don't want these groups to speak the world
[29:44.760 --> 29:48.920]  language and be effective you want them in tiny little minority groups controlled by the democratic
[29:48.920 --> 29:55.720]  party l have it we're on the march oh and get this france is pro-business lx jones and the gcn radio

[33:45.160 --> 33:58.200]  democide has killed over 262 million people in the 20th century alone as the university of hawaii
[33:58.200 --> 34:08.760]  studying a conservative number 260 2 million people have been killed who were not military
[34:08.760 --> 34:18.840]  combatants not soldiers in the 20th century the number one unnatural killer was government our
[34:18.840 --> 34:24.840]  forebearers warned us government generally degenerates evil special interest kitten control
[34:24.840 --> 34:31.640]  and you see a full collapse of society and nightmares are born when you have a renaissance
[34:31.640 --> 34:37.720]  free market open society you literally create so much wealth your grandkids become decadent
[34:37.720 --> 34:45.560]  slobs and then the cycle of evil continues again the veneer of civilization is paper thin
[34:47.720 --> 34:50.040]  and is wearing away right now
[34:53.640 --> 35:00.680]  and we're entering the depths of a violent bottom of the cycle
[35:00.680 --> 35:09.240]  so i cannot stress to you enough that this age of crisis this age of destabilization
[35:09.240 --> 35:15.720]  has only begun most the world is in semi starvation mode 30 million people starve to death
[35:15.720 --> 35:22.200]  a year half of them children almost every third world nation is in flames right now
[35:22.200 --> 35:25.320]  or is completely destabilized with riot police on the street
[35:25.320 --> 35:33.720]  the west are like mountains in an ocean of corruption and an ocean of poverty but the water
[35:33.720 --> 35:43.320]  is rising quick in japan in idly in the united states in canada in germany in spain in portugal
[35:43.320 --> 35:57.720]  in greece in ireland in greenland it's rising fast and the globalists have decided to accelerate
[35:57.720 --> 36:06.520]  it as fast as they can to artificially bring the world to carrying capacity and carrying capacity
[36:06.520 --> 36:14.120]  because if you've got 100 cows on a field and there's only enough grass for 50 cows
[36:15.560 --> 36:24.600]  over the next few months more than 50 cows will die you go but wait the carrying capacity of 50
[36:24.600 --> 36:31.480]  why would 65 die they've done studies on this i'm giving you a small part number because at first
[36:31.480 --> 36:35.800]  they all eat things down and bring it into an even lower abundance level so now the carrying
[36:35.800 --> 36:47.800]  capacity is 35 cows 20 cows five cows the energy is being turned off the food is being turned off
[36:47.800 --> 36:54.680]  they're paying farmers around the world not to produce our immune systems are being lowered by
[36:54.680 --> 37:01.560]  design and you've got this parasitic technocratic class of republicans and democrats of labor and
[37:01.560 --> 37:09.560]  Tory it's the same worldwide who actually know all this and sit around praying on their constituency
[37:10.120 --> 37:23.640]  playing games with you and they're going to pose as the saviors during this long cold war this long
[37:23.640 --> 37:31.240]  siege the most ancient and total form of war against every decent institution against everything
[37:31.240 --> 37:39.160]  good everything wholesome we are witnessing an illuminati revolution
[37:43.240 --> 37:47.320]  just as the french revolution is an open illuminati revolution
[37:47.320 --> 37:58.280]  we are witnessing an attempt to overthrow reality to overthrow truth
[38:01.240 --> 38:06.200]  to fully domesticate and shackle humanity and destroy our free will
[38:08.200 --> 38:15.160]  it is the opposite the polar opposite of enlightenment or of illumination that's why
[38:15.160 --> 38:22.200]  they call themselves the illuminati they do not illuminate oh the inner circle of the illuminati
[38:22.200 --> 38:28.520]  believes they are illuminated with the master 360 luciferian panopticonic understanding
[38:29.720 --> 38:35.720]  but they themselves are the greatest of the deceived to know the knowledge they possess
[38:35.720 --> 38:45.800]  and do a physically using human ingenuity and our creativity built semi omnipresent surveillance
[38:45.800 --> 38:55.240]  systems and to not see the destruction they are creating well they actually do see it they worship
[38:55.240 --> 39:02.040]  it like a moth to flame and they are truly not eliminated or they would not seek to dominate
[39:02.040 --> 39:10.120]  free will and to dominate life and to reduce life and destroy life and exterminate life out of a
[39:12.200 --> 39:22.920]  spoiled rotten convulsive demonic orgy of darkness
[39:26.360 --> 39:31.800]  but that's what's on the other side you join with the new world order you have stepped in
[39:31.800 --> 39:38.440]  and taken satan's hand and have asked to be pulled through into that world
[39:43.720 --> 39:49.800]  i personally studying history studying the globalist own writings and my own bizarre
[39:49.800 --> 39:59.320]  life experiences beyond anything you see in a movie do have a limited view into what the
[39:59.320 --> 40:05.160]  global architects are up to it's extremely detailed extremely wide reaching more than
[40:05.160 --> 40:08.360]  what a lot of their top people even have but when i say limited
[40:11.880 --> 40:18.200]  my soul and my psyche doesn't swim in the same waters as theirs so i can't see it through their
[40:18.200 --> 40:23.240]  eyes but i can come close and let me tell you it shakes my very soul
[40:23.240 --> 40:30.680]  just as they cannot see the things i've seen and where my soul dwells
[40:34.200 --> 40:40.280]  even for but fleeting moments each month in the stillness of the night in the quiet place of the
[40:40.280 --> 40:49.000]  most high and that's why they put fluoride in the water that's why they dumb down the population
[40:49.000 --> 40:55.400]  that's why they feed you gmo because you will have that quiet dignity that quiet confidence that
[40:55.400 --> 41:02.840]  quiet understanding that will transcend this world and transcend all these corrupt wicked people
[41:03.640 --> 41:10.760]  who for temporal power on this globe would cheat their fellow men and women and would pull down
[41:10.760 --> 41:19.480]  the psyches and the free will of other individuals in an attempt so that they might dominate
[41:20.520 --> 41:26.440]  their cheaters and they're not fans of humanity and they will fail
[41:31.320 --> 41:36.440]  rick perry is under tremendous pressure and folks know that uh uh i don't like rick perry
[41:36.440 --> 41:40.920]  because he was a big democrat and was for gun control before he flipped sides with carl rove
[41:40.920 --> 41:45.960]  but that can always still happen somebody was a democrat and woke up had a road to
[41:45.960 --> 41:51.560]  Damascus moment i would support them if their fruits were good after that
[41:53.720 --> 41:59.080]  if i didn't see the politician betrayals where they flip flop
[41:59.080 --> 42:06.440]  rick perry pushed Gardasil said it was the law to take it when it wasn't
[42:08.200 --> 42:14.520]  the deadly hp v shot but he has done some pro gun stuff and he has done some real stuff on the
[42:14.520 --> 42:19.960]  border just because really his constituents demand it so that's fine he's a lot better than diane
[42:19.960 --> 42:27.720]  feinstein or barack obama but the first thing he should have done at that press conference last
[42:27.720 --> 42:34.680]  when the is what governor jindal did on friday called for president obama to stop all flights
[42:34.680 --> 42:39.080]  coming in from six different african nations two of which have already basically collapsed
[42:39.800 --> 42:48.920]  Sierra Leone and Liberia from Ebola why would you let people flee from a country that has that
[42:50.840 --> 42:54.520]  well now rick perry has come out and said in fighting against Ebola
[42:54.520 --> 42:59.960]  us must set up quarantine at borders texas governor rick perry on monday called the federal
[42:59.960 --> 43:04.360]  government to enhance screening procedures at points of entry in the united states to check
[43:04.360 --> 43:08.360]  if someone might have Ebola and i said bare minimum do that yesterday perry i know perry
[43:08.360 --> 43:12.440]  listens to the show he's told me to my face so i i just want that's good
[43:14.680 --> 43:18.280]  the procedures would include gathering more information about people coming
[43:18.280 --> 43:24.440]  from affected areas and perhaps taking temperatures think so he said he called for fully staff
[43:24.440 --> 43:27.960]  quarantine stations anywhere people enter the country yeah they're going to wait till it's
[43:27.960 --> 43:32.840]  spreading around the country and just do it to everybody that's fair after all perry has signed
[43:32.840 --> 43:37.000]  an executive order creating the texas task force infectious diseases preparedness and response
[43:37.640 --> 43:42.360]  so that's good another Ebola patient arriving on states on monday
[43:42.360 --> 43:49.560]  reminding the nation the virus killing thousands of people in west africa will likely come
[43:50.120 --> 43:55.480]  continued across us borders and now the cdc saying they believe it probably has spread to others
[43:56.120 --> 44:01.000]  really think so they for five days sent the guys kids back to school
[44:06.120 --> 44:09.160]  they didn't clean the vomit up for days they left the ambulance he was in driver out for
[44:09.160 --> 44:15.720]  days the other sick people the guy came in a week before and they gave him antibiotics for a quote
[44:15.720 --> 44:22.600]  virus it's not the state's job to do this though the state has to because the feds won't
[44:25.480 --> 44:28.760]  but when it starts to spread around the country and i hope it doesn't but looks like it's going
[44:28.760 --> 44:39.080]  that direction how will we hold obama accountable you're like well obama's a puppet yeah but you've
[44:39.080 --> 44:43.480]  got to hold the puppets accountable because then it sets a precedent where they get more power out
[44:43.480 --> 44:49.320]  of doing this see teenager with Ebola like symptoms quarantine in miami after getting sick
[44:49.320 --> 44:53.720]  following a trip to west africa yeah that's a good idea let's all go visit west africa that's a
[44:53.720 --> 45:00.360]  great place to go right now it's a wonderful place to go child brought to delaware hospital for
[45:00.360 --> 45:10.200]  possible Ebola that's out of cbs news police find man who wrote an Ebola patients ambulance yeah
[45:10.200 --> 45:15.400]  why are police in dallas having to go track down people this is what the federal government the
[45:15.400 --> 45:21.240]  cdc supposed to do with their hundreds of billions of budgets for this every year but notice they
[45:21.240 --> 45:26.600]  don't do anything they don't lead jack squat they just sit up there and say leave the borders open
[45:26.600 --> 45:32.040]  let people fly in they don't check the plane manifest they don't go question who this guy flew
[45:32.040 --> 45:41.960]  with this has been out for over a week no a homeless panhandler who wrote the same dallas
[45:41.960 --> 45:48.280]  ambulance after Ebola patient eric duncan has been found after an extensive manhunt
[45:48.920 --> 45:53.880]  50 year old man who officials identified as michael lively was admitted to parkland memorial
[45:53.880 --> 45:59.160]  hospital sunday afternoon after being taken into custody by dallas police officers county judge
[45:59.720 --> 46:06.680]  clay jinkin said he was taken to the hospital psychiatric ward
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.520]  here's the deal this gets into another 20 30 people you're not going to be able to stop it
[46:14.520 --> 46:18.200]  it's going to start spreading just like africa and and let's say it only runs through a couple
[46:18.200 --> 46:23.800]  hundred thousand people only kills 30 40 50 thousand you know let's say low mobility morbidity rate
[46:26.680 --> 46:31.400]  what's going to do to the economy in this country or texas when abola is running around i mean
[46:32.120 --> 46:37.000]  i am down the street from dallas i am in austin texas and i am so angry at the government
[46:38.440 --> 46:43.640]  i'm so thankful to the dallas police they're at least doing the job of the feds trying to hunt down
[46:43.640 --> 46:49.800]  some people that were around this guy this should have been done day one he was diagnosed with abola
[46:49.800 --> 46:54.520]  day one put his kids in quarantine put his wife in quarantine put the neighbors in quarantine
[46:54.520 --> 46:59.640]  day one hazmat cruise cleaning up the vomit day one what's that ambulance you sit her and say
[46:59.640 --> 47:05.480]  what was his trail where did he go you know clean up the entire trail find out who was on the
[47:05.480 --> 47:10.520]  airplane go to all their houses quarantine every single one of them because you don't want it to
[47:10.520 --> 47:14.680]  spread ladies and gentlemen then you got to quarantine thousands and then hundreds of thousands
[47:14.680 --> 47:26.040]  and then things collapse standard procedure all of it ignored in fact i want to hear from
[47:26.040 --> 47:31.000]  emergency managers first we had an incredible call from an emergency manager in san antonio
[47:31.000 --> 47:37.000]  talking about this how all the protocols are being ignored why do you think they're doing this
[47:37.000 --> 47:40.920]  where do you think it's going do you agree with steel who was on saying this could be a
[47:40.920 --> 47:45.480]  simulate false flag he said that back in september said it was coming he's on tomorrow
[47:45.480 --> 47:49.000]  we have that clip coming up we're gonna be playing it coming up in the next hour

[48:48.760 --> 48:54.360]  getting right with god because it isn't just that the Ebola is now in the united states
[48:54.360 --> 48:59.640]  and the un says 1.4 to 5 million or to get it in africa and then the only place you're allowed to
[48:59.640 --> 49:06.360]  run is the us and that's another huge issue obama makes the us the place to run obama
[49:06.360 --> 49:10.120]  advertises just like he advertises for kids to come here from all over the world and their
[49:10.120 --> 49:14.360]  families the advertisement is you got Ebola come here you want to come here and get free medical
[49:14.360 --> 49:18.840]  care i mean i gotta be honest with you if i was in africa and thought my kids had Ebola or i had it
[49:18.840 --> 49:23.720]  i'd stay behind and send my kids even though it's super immoral who wouldn't and i would try to get
[49:23.720 --> 49:30.440]  them over here to get treatment that should be hanging off helicopters co-workers of Ebola patient

[54:29.960 --> 54:35.720]  man ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting world wide i'm your host alex jones we're going to your
[54:35.720 --> 54:40.680]  phone calls here throughout the next hour in about 10 minutes paul joseph watson's article
[54:41.880 --> 54:49.320]  dealing with um former top cia field commander going public predicting back in september
[54:49.320 --> 54:56.360]  that he was being told that a fecabola attack was coming in america i think i'm gonna have added
[54:56.360 --> 55:02.280]  to watson's article if you go back to wolfgang woodard the head of the e u viral program he
[55:02.280 --> 55:08.520]  first confirmed well he confirmed after medical doctors and others here had said that h1n1 appeared
[55:08.520 --> 55:14.280]  to be a viral simulant five years ago that had been released the previous year to quote track
[55:14.280 --> 55:21.320]  viral spread it is a virus but they call it a simulant because it was so attenuated but
[55:21.320 --> 55:28.760]  still allowed to spread then they used the outbreak of it the next year to claim it was
[55:28.760 --> 55:34.840]  deadly to sell a vaccine that actually lowered your immune system by 50 percent so we should
[55:34.840 --> 55:39.560]  probably add there's precedent for this where they release a biological simulant that does
[55:39.560 --> 55:47.400]  make you sick or even kills you but is either weakened attenuated or something else where
[55:47.400 --> 55:52.040]  say it's designed to mutate they know how it's going to mutate it's a previous generation and
[55:52.040 --> 55:56.200]  they know it'll mutate and and and then won't kill the next group i mean there's a lot of
[55:56.200 --> 55:59.960]  different ways to do this without getting technical i'm no virologist i would just
[55:59.960 --> 56:04.680]  read the medical literature to then have a limited outbreak but something they control
[56:04.680 --> 56:11.720]  like SARS so watson has an article coming out on this in the next 10 minutes and we will play
[56:11.720 --> 56:18.680]  the video from three weeks ago when steel was on the broadcast it's coming up in the next hour
[56:18.680 --> 56:25.000]  about 15 after or so that article should be up and we will play that clip from the interview
[56:25.000 --> 56:32.040]  here on air and that video will go live on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[56:32.040 --> 56:37.240]  but right now first caller of the day rich in oregon you're on the air thanks for calling
[56:38.440 --> 56:46.040]  hi alex how are you today i'm fine sir hey um i believe it is a false black it has to be but
[56:46.040 --> 56:50.120]  you know what the unfortunate thing is people probably will die from this i mean they are dying
[56:50.120 --> 56:55.800]  in west africa obviously according to the line media says 3400 people have died who knows really
[56:55.800 --> 57:01.480]  how many have so the only thing i can personally do for myself and my family is i have been taking
[57:01.480 --> 57:07.400]  survival shield and the fluoride shield you know and um i even went to my doctor and asked them
[57:07.400 --> 57:12.840]  about that he said there's a good step in the right direction however you know they don't really know
[57:12.840 --> 57:19.000]  a lot about it but obviously nothing's a silver bullet but the only thing the federal government
[57:19.000 --> 57:26.040]  ever said till fluoride put it in the salt was iodine because there was just massive goiter
[57:26.040 --> 57:31.080]  and illnesses and thyroid across the country and millions of people within a few years of them
[57:31.080 --> 57:37.560]  doing that reversed it and so we just found the very best of actual nascent crystal iodine
[57:38.120 --> 57:42.360]  that because of the fda and stuff i can't even say all the things it does the point is it's well
[57:42.360 --> 57:49.000]  known it's well known for iq well known for your glands well known for immune system uh so is
[57:49.000 --> 57:55.400]  silver but that's not something you take long term it's during a problem uh it's it's well known uh
[57:55.400 --> 58:05.800]  that it's things coq 10 and ppq and all the stuff that's in uh the uh dna force i mean we so i'm
[58:05.800 --> 58:10.520]  glad your doctor said that because listen all we sell is what we know is really real it's
[58:10.520 --> 58:14.760]  nutraceutical that's why the dna force is so expensive to get the products anyways sir i'm
[58:14.760 --> 58:20.760]  sorry i'm ranting go ahead well anyway i was uh you know i i'm totally sold on it me and my wife
[58:20.760 --> 58:25.320]  and uh my children we take it you know and stuff and we've been around people that hold an early
[58:25.320 --> 58:32.120]  and nobody's gotten sick yet you know so i that's what i believe in well i know that the x2 alone
[58:32.120 --> 58:35.960]  the the super iodine has changed my life hold on i'm gonna come back and let you get to your point
[58:35.960 --> 58:41.640]  about habola then we'll go to wild man lab rat truth raiders shame others thank you and then
[58:41.640 --> 58:47.240]  after we take these calls i just want to get emergency managers or emt's or people trained

[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:53.320]  the cdc previously governor jindal has called for that we are joined by representative walter
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:01:01.160]  b jones from north carolina and of course he's one of the few ron paul types we've still got in

[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:11.000]  constitution and bill of rights but he has introduced legislation this year that's now
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.680]  gotten a lot of attention and we've had a lot of different military people on and and whistleblowers
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:22.120]  who have seen the 28 pages of the 911 report showing clearly the soddies were involved
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:27.240]  and our government knew and basically had a stand down he's been working to get that released
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:32.440]  and he joins us to talk about that and other issues so congressman jones thanks for coming on
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:39.960]  alex delighted to do it and i want to thank you this is an important issue because for our country
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.960]  if the american people don't know the truth about 911 there is no hope for our nation in my opinion
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.960]  so i'm delighted to be on your show well thank you sir you know it's perfect timing to have you on
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:55.320]  it's coming out that our own government with nato's been arming isis uh they've been uh that
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:00.280]  our so-called gulf state partners have been arming them this is just a replay of what we've seen before
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.560]  alex there's no question about it that's why i have it's a totally different issue but very
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:11.560]  quickly i have joined some of my colleagues asking john bainer to bring us back let's have a debate
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:17.240]  on this syrian situation and i'm very disappointed that uh speaker bainer will not do that and it
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:22.440]  keeps saying well if the president asks us to bring you back we will and i've said to mr bainer
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:28.040]  and let her form mr bainer you have the authority as leader of the house to bring us back at any time
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:33.240]  to let the house debate and discuss well let's talk about that a little bit more before we go
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:39.640]  to break and come back with the 9 11 commission rubber dachshund 28 pages uh we've seen the
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:45.400]  british military come out and say that the british government should stop arming the radicals
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:51.080]  we've seen our own military as you know on the hill and close closed hearings saying the same thing
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.600]  i'm proud that our military has been against this from the beginning but our political leaders
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:02.680]  uh on both sides of the aisle have been for it well i was very disappointing we did have
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:09.720]  a debate uh on the floor of the house about arming or training the syrian rebels and uh
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:16.840]  sadly it passed uh and i spoke out in opposition to it with the two minutes i had on the floor
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:23.800]  and other members of both parties spoke out against it and i do not understand why the president
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:31.000]  continues to bypass congress he bombed libya which was unnecessary uh and he continues to
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.880]  want to bomb in syria i think it raises legal questions but that's another issue i'm not an
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:42.520]  attorney as you know but to me congress is not following the constitution and therefore i'm
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:47.800]  very disappointed in the leadership that would not allow us to have a debate and actually wrote
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:52.920]  a letter to mr bainer uh last week asking that when we come back what's called the lame duck
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:59.000]  session we can at least have a two or three day day debate on this syrian situation because in my
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:06.760]  opinion uh the policy is the failed policy to begin with jones.house.gov and when we come back
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:12.440]  we're going to get into declassify the national campaign to reveal the 28 censored pages the 9
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:17.560]  11 commission but didn't you also introduce legislation that if obama continues to launch
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:23.240]  wars without congressional approval that impeachment would get triggered sir well i'm i'm sad to tell
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:27.640]  you i did introduce it but i can't even get a hearing on the house side and we're controlled
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:32.440]  by republicans that they won't even give me a hearing on that issue incredible well doing the
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:37.160]  right thing is what counts and just like ron paul would introduce stuff and no one would co-sponsor
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:40.920]  it down the road he got a lot of co-sponsors and i know you are getting a lot of support
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:46.360]  for your declassification uh movement of the 28 pages we'll talk about that with congressman
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:53.400]  walter jones a true hero of tellin the truth and liberty of the republican from north carolina

[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:17.720]  obama has promised to bankrupt hole in this country that supplies well did supply about 60
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:23.400]  percent of our power now about 40 energy prices have almost doubled the last six years electricity
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:32.840]  well the democrat senate candidate allison grimes a grime staff caught on hidden cameras
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:39.400]  she's lying about support for coal industry us senate candidate allison lungrin grimes is lying
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:43.880]  about her support for the state's coal industry according to kentucky democrats including members
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:49.320]  of her campaign team who were caught on a hidden camera video saying yeah we go out we shoot guns
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:55.400]  in public we say we're conservative but once we get in we're going to bankrupt coal well obama
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:04.360]  famously said that as well so that's what they're doing i don't own one stock in coal i own zero
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:09.880]  coal but i'm against shutting it down because it's clean it powers our country i don't want to get off
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:15.160]  down a rabbit trail with the congressman walter b jones of north carolina who's introduced legislation
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:19.400]  to impeach obama that continues to launch wars without congressional approval he's introduced
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:24.760]  legislation that's getting a lot of cosponsors as well to release the 28 pages of the 9 11 commission
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:31.080]  report jones dot house dot gov but let me just ask you briefly what you think about coal being
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:37.880]  shut down in this country throw a wildcard at you a curveball and separately about uh the obola
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:42.360]  flights being allowed to come in out of west africa what's your take on both those issues sir
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:51.400]  well i think any uh opportunity to use any type of energy to help the american people as long as
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:57.720]  it's clean and safe and that's been proven about the coal industry they make gigantic gains and
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:02.680]  trying to make sure that their product is clean and i think they've done a great job i think it
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:09.400]  should be a way that we can have that option and as far as ebola i have already read to the
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:15.000]  white house joined many of my colleagues to say stop letting these people come into this country
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.080]  so you're on record with colleagues writing a letter to the president shane uh stop the flights
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:27.080]  absolutely and there's almost no media coverage of this and the head of the cdc is out saying quote
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:32.840]  it will make obola spread if we don't let them come in i mean that is the most asinine thing i've
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:39.000]  ever heard i would agree with you and alex that is why that many of my colleagues uh from north
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.880]  carolina and all the states are asking the administration to use the authority they have
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:51.560]  to protect the american people from any type of disease it's got the potential to be an epidemic
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:59.000]  and uh i don't know i can't explain you've been around a while and does it seem like we're living
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.760]  in the twilight zone i've never seen government act this way this reckless on so many fronts our
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:10.680]  southern borders wide open while they're saying isis terror attacks are imminent uh it's just bizarre
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:18.920]  well you know i've made a statement many times that uh i believe that we are at a crossroads
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:25.320]  in this country and if we don't make the right decision uh in the next presidential election
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:32.280]  there will be no hope for america and i'm a big rand paul's support about way well god bless you
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:37.880]  my friend i tell you it's it's it's just so frightening when you have children or grandchildren
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:46.040]  it really is to just really another subject very quickly the debt of this nation in the year 2000
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:55.640]  our debt in in america was 5.6 trillion dollars today it is over 17.7 trillion dollars how much
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:00.840]  longer economically can a country continue to borrow money from foreign governments to pay
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:06.600]  its bills before it collapses i don't know then you got it bowling then you got all these other
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:11.960]  issues i mean we could do another show if you want to on the 28 pages because i will tell you the truth
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:17.880]  that in that in itself the 28 pages the american people the families of 9-11 have a right to see
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:23.880]  what's in there and uh i can honestly tell you when you've got the former two chairman of senator
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:28.520]  bob graham retired now lives in florida from florida and richard shelby still in the united
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:35.160]  state senate and their inquiry commission said that yes it should be declassified then you've got
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:43.720]  uh halmonton and and can recently as recently as three weeks ago uh former members of the house
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:48.680]  and then the former governor new jersey can't say that it should be declassified and there's
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:54.360]  no reason the american people should not see the truth it was george bush that classified this
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:13:01.320]  information mr obama owes nothing to george bush but he does owe to the families of 9-11
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:07.240]  the right to see the 28 pages and certainly the american people and mr obama has told the families
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:14.680]  twice that he would allow them to see the 28 pages and steve lynch a democrat and myself
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:20.520]  have written to president obama in april of this year reminding him that he made this promise
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:26.440]  and he needs keep his word to the 9-11 families uh and uh we stand on top of that we call the
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.880]  white house every now and then we have been told as recently as two weeks ago that in the next four
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:37.160]  or five weeks they would give us an answer to our letter extremely powerful and that's the main
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:42.520]  reason congressman walter b jones has joined us today is to talk about what is what he can say
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:47.000]  is in those pages i've talked to military sources other congressional sources you were on at the
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.600]  first of year when you first introduced the legislation what can you tell us without violating
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.920]  your supposed national security laws that they used to hide all these crimes what can you tell us
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:03.080]  is in the 28 pages well what i can tell you in the 28 pages is nothing about national security
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:08.760]  it is about relationships and it could be somewhat embarrassing to the bush administration
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:15.240]  but i'm telling you that the american people need to know those people in saudi arabia
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:22.280]  who were not our friends at that time and i'm not going to the very top of the saudi leadership
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:30.120]  but i'm just saying that the saudi uh i need to let the american people know who within their
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:36.280]  country who was involved in financing this 9-11 attack and that that's been in the press i'm
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:41.240]  not telling people anything that i read because that's been in the press that's speculation
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:49.960]  that's right we've done two press conferences with family members who lost love one one in march
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:55.720]  thomas massie was there to see lynch myself and and family members and we did another one three
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:01.480]  days before 9-11 in washington dc with family members and they're calling on the president to
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:08.040]  keep his word to them that they have a right to see the 28 pages and the american people do also
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:17.160]  now if the 28 pages comes out what do you expect will come of that
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:24.120]  you know what will come of it it would be exactly what it needs to be it helps educate
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:31.480]  the american people to what happened on 9-11 and it doesn't do anything anymore or or less
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.560]  and i would tell you alex that if people really want to
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:41.160]  bob graham down in florida i've taught him he's been he's skied during one of our interviews to
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:47.560]  to give his call to the president to declassify i have spoken to son the mansion just two weeks ago
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:53.400]  as a matter of fact i've spoken to son the poll about it the american people need to see this
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:57.880]  information if it was national security issues that involved i would not be on your show today
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:06.840]  it's only about relationships well look at how vice president biden apologizes uh this weekend
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:12.680]  to the prince of cutter uh overcoming out and saying that that our quote allies
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.320]  should stop arming isis it's on record they're arming isis so how have we gotten to the point
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:25.480]  that we're so controlled by these arab states that they could be funding al qaeda under the
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:29.720]  name isis and our vice president has to apologize when he states the truth
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:40.520]  is alex that's why again i think that america needs the kind of leadership that aran paul just
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:47.560]  like his father ron paul with led this nation to help us to understand that we have a constitution
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:53.400]  and if we don't follow the constitution then we're headed for worse times than what we see today
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:17:00.120]  and it's not really good right now either i i don't understand why i mean this is the way
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:05.560]  i feel about it first of all we had no business going into iraq we would be better off with
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:11.640]  saddam hussein in leading the people of iraq he understood his country a lot better than the
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:17.240]  bush people did we have created the problems we got in the middle east right now by going into iraq
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:23.560]  obama should not have bombed libya and taken out kadafi that country is about to fall apart

[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:31.720]  you know a 10 year old it's just so politically correct i can't figure it out just happened here

[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:11.480]  earlier uh go ahead and make your points uh my point is to be a boy obviously as a false flag
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:15.080]  you have plenty of whistleblowers you have plenty of evidence of that you also have
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:21.560]  plenty of support from your listeners and also to the giving back to the documents that you have
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:27.080]  my question is or maybe just get your take on it why isn't somebody paying for this
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:32.120]  that's what i've been asking is we know they're bringing people in and have a bolo we know they're
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:37.160]  not coordinating those that had it they're families that can be spreading it uh we just
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:43.640]  know that they've violated all the protocols and law all the defaults and it's like leaving the
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:50.360]  hatch open on a submarine when you submerge it is totally criminal and i think they're just setting
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:55.480]  the precedent there's a bunch of lawyers run this administration to just get away with bloody murder
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.480]  this is what criminals love to do when they don't get caught or don't get in trouble
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:05.240]  what do they do they escalate they get more bold they get more out of control they start taunting
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:10.840]  this is basic criminology uh and i think they want to use an Ebola outbreak to basically bring in
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:16.360]  martial law that could be what's happening here what do you think i don't know that's a scary thing
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:23.080]  you know i just you know i just don't know what to say i i i all i could say is i appreciate
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:27.240]  everything you do i like to keep up the good work i mean there's really nothing else i could say
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:34.920]  about it i'm shell shocked as well i mean i woke up like four a.m this morning and i just laid there
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:39.400]  staring out the window at the stars and i was just thinking to myself
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:47.880]  why is this happening why is the elite so i listen they shouldn't have given him a visa
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:55.400]  the guy it turns out knew he had Ebola and came here of course where where what what
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:00.760]  what do you think is going to happen with countries with millions of people now set to get Ebola
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:04.360]  according to the computer models they're going to try to go to a country that has medical here
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:09.960]  and they can't get into europe they can't get in the middle east they're going to come here they
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:15.800]  can't get into asia they're going to come here because america is a joke and i don't say that

[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:06.040]  abola false flag in september former case officer predicted outbreak in us two weeks before dallas

[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:24.600]  seven of october 2014 transmission and again he came highly recommended from colonel schaffer
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.160]  he said we don't know what's really going on interview this guy he's
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:39.720]  out of the government and he just came on and just false flag at the boston bombing false flag at

[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:56.440]  it happens just unbelievable so he'll be joining us tomorrow and the reason you're seeing more of
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:01.640]  this is people in the government are done playing games i'm going to say this again the chairman of
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:06.280]  the joint chiefs well i'm not lionizing but he did it last year went to obama and so there's
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:11.240]  going to be a mutiny in the military we're not going to openly back al qaeda against syria don't do it
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:16.760]  it the british military went this weekend to parliament their chairman of the joint chiefs
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:23.400]  their heads and said do not fund radical islam anymore okay we're done the public knows about
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:29.720]  it we don't want to be part of it no see there's an open decloaking happening right now
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:34.440]  where the establishment is basically raising its skirt and showing us what's under there
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:42.600]  trying to sell us on the fact that it's apple pie and it's a dead horse basically people don't want
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:50.760]  this people don't want to openly join with evil as corrupt as the west is but the sickos that run
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:56.280]  things just really have a desire to do this and all they're going to get is big trigger events
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:01.720]  against them the harder they push the more pushback they're going to get it doesn't matter
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:08.440]  if they've got half the public drooling talking about their favorite sitcom or sport center
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:13.320]  it doesn't matter if you've got 10 percent of the public knows what's going on it's came over
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:21.000]  we've got way past that we got it where it counts people are sick of it
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:25.640]  wild man in texas go ahead and finish your point up about a bowl
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:32.120]  yes sir uh as i was saying i was watching uh paul ghost of watson and uh david night last week
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:36.680]  and they also said that somebody had warned or said that it would hit the united states
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:44.840]  in october and i don't remember how that was but at any rate on the other side of that coin
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:49.400]  i'm thinking what the border is being open and now all the airlines coming in here and everything
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:54.600]  else you don't get some of them nut bags over there uh isis contracting the disease and just
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.080]  sending it over here is another way to get well that's what people have been saying for for months
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:06.280]  and her older ovara said it's racist if you say that no that's what's going on and undoubtedly
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.480]  you've got these countries collapsing now so they're going to have people like this guy that came
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:19.000]  here with abola trying to get here and obama and the cdc's answer is no we're not going to stop those
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:25.560]  flights so they are directly to blame when it happens and they are going to be held accountable
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:32.120]  i thank you so much for your call truth raider in oregon you're on the air hello my friend elix
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:37.400]  i i have to say i i apologize and why i say that is because you know i know you don't like to be
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:41.960]  thanked but thank you for putting me up on your youtube channel i sure took a terrific amount of
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:49.240]  heat but it was well worth it okay man that's great uh go ahead okay well this is this is it
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:55.560]  this is the i predicted the the mole outbreak coming in the fall but this is why they're doing it
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:05.000]  it's a 34 letter f word called fear fear it's exactly what they want people to be it's unsafe
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:13.320]  feeling of insecure and in fear that's right so while they rob the treasury and in overturn the
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:18.120]  constitution bill of rights we're busy worried about abola great point let's talk to another
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:25.720]  caller here now let's talk to shane and pennsylvania you're on the air hello alex yes i love you brother
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:32.200]  quick question quick comment you've been doing this a long time you're pretty good at reading
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:37.480]  them between the lines and the stuff what's your opinion on the abola alex do you think
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:41.560]  i mean really do you think false flag or do you think red flag
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:50.600]  undoubtedly they have souped up abola at labs at the west has over there that we know they
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:54.600]  admittedly have they've released it right on time as monsanto and others are getting their
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:39:00.280]  abola vaccine ready with bill of melinda gates and bare minimum they've opened the door to bring
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:06.680]  in the patients and let people fly in hoping it spreads thinking we're so dumb that the ruling class
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:14.040]  won't get in trouble for what they've clearly done so if you knew that a grizzly bear uh was
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:18.200]  killing everybody that tried to camp out at a certain spot and you took your little kids out
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:23.720]  there and chained them up to a tree at night you would be an accomplice to their death and it'd be
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:30.040]  murder one premeditated murder and so by opening the borders up by letting the flights come in
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:36.120]  by not has matting anything for days they are aiding and abetting this at the cdc so the
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:41.560]  it is a false flag whether they made the crisis or opened the door for it they aren't letting
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:47.320]  it go to waste they are aiding and abetting it and so they are murder one they are murder one
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:54.040]  when americans die from this they are murder one and it is economic sabotage against industry
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:59.720]  the globalists are going to make a bunch of money out of the response to it it's just a new war
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:07.960]  that they can manage like a black hole and feed our tax money into i agree just like lawyers will
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:13.240]  have a divorce going and will drain both sides in it it just like the Rothschilds would fund
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:18.040]  both sides of a war the globalists manipulate people off against each other divide and conquer
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:24.600]  and it's what's happening right now what do you think's behind it well i i i think it's a false
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:31.080]  flag but i don't know i earlier i you had mentioned about uh a big form of grab for money uh vaccine
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:36.200]  thing i'm thinking maybe that's the route they're going well they always allow something to happen
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:40.680]  or or actually orchestrate it if it helps them on a bunch of fronts and this will bring in medical
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:47.000]  tyranny hundreds of billions of vaccine sales of the next decade uh big political diversion
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:53.080]  expansion of obama care is a federalized fema it just helps them on so many fronts
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:58.200]  if they can politically get away with it and they don't care even if we impeach obama over it
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:02.840]  show up the special interest they'll get what they want again banner won't repeal obama care we put
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:08.840]  up with that why not bring a bola in here thank you so much for the call lab rat in virginia you're
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:14.200]  on the air alex that's really good to talk to you again how you doing today i'm doing great

[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:34.840]  she's a studying epidemiologist and she's an internships and friends with the cbc their protocols
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:43.320]  are absolutely 100% being ignored everyone from due to big to every single one of your
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:48.680]  excellent reporters knows that look at the reports that you guys were putting out ahead of time from
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:54.520]  the world health organization and the cdc they were absolutely apocalyptic this is going to end
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:42:00.840]  the world i mean the cdc was losing their hair over this thing it gets to dallas add don't worry
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:07.480]  about it it's going to be don't forget about it it's fine we got this we're good really you're
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:12.520]  good go to your house i mean everybody go you call your local hospital ask to speak to the head
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:19.720]  nurse ask them how many negative pressure rooms they have available how many beds they've got
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:24.600]  a negative pressure rooms because that's what it's going to take when somebody's spewing blood and
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:31.080]  vomit and feces all over from every orifice we are not ready but i agree with you this is this is a
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:40.280]  100% like everything else a stand down i ask ask your guy tomorrow is this just a simulation and
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:46.040]  they are studying you as much as or more than anybody else because you are at the tip of the
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:51.560]  spear you've said it yourself they want to see who's going to buy what how the alternative press
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:55.240]  is going to handle this how the liberty movement is going to handle it how the zombies and the
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:43:00.440]  sleepers are going to handle it how the cold use the cedars are going to have how everybody this
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:07.480]  is a study en masse and they made you're right let a few hundred thousand go that's the sad part
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:12.760]  but what they are they are wargaming just like they admitted with h1n1 that was a simulant that
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:18.680]  came out that was a simulant they are wargaming how we'll respond to a mega pandemic in the future
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:22.920]  and this could be a simulant but it's killing a lot of people in africa show whatever it is
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:29.320]  it's lethal great points good to hear from you i'm going to continue with calls but right now
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:33.160]  i want to cover this article and guys will you print me a copy of it some of the new stories
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:40.760]  that have broke thanks a lot uh cia insider warned of a bowl of false flag in september
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:47.880]  former case officer predicted outbreak in us two weeks before dallas case former cia insider
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:52.040]  robert david steele warned during a september eight the eighteenth appearance on the alex
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:56.520]  jones show that a stage the bowl of false flag attack was on the horizon two weeks before the
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:03.000]  first case was confirmed in united states we need to add the point that he said he's been told by
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:09.240]  sources he's not just speculating he says he's been told he's hearing that's key
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:16.760]  steele who is now an author and lecturer previously worked for the central intelligence agency
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:21.400]  as a clandestine services case officer and also ran as presidential candidate reform party
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:26.600]  they will have another false flag in fact that false flag i'm hearing about is a simulated
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:33.400]  Ebola attack in which they actually use biochemical weapons that dissipate but then they pretend
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:40.600]  that it's Ebola and that it has been brought here by saudi martyrs said steele adding we have not
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:45.240]  reached the end of the false flag line still elaborated by warning that the chaos created by
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:51.560]  a false flag attack could lead to a general strike across america steele's website public
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:56.120]  intelligence blog also warned of a false flag Ebola outbreak in united states almost two weeks
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:02.920]  before the first case of Ebola was confirmed in dallas and it goes on if Ebola virus hits the USA
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:10.280]  it will be in this order or probability a false flag biochemical stand-in b volunteers ready in
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:19.720]  the USA infected by saudi clandestines see white virgins not known by the USA to be associated in
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:25.800]  any way or combinations what they're called the cia is people working for them or cutouts that
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:31.960]  are rogue elements in the USA that would be happy to kill citizens for effect and there are rogue
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:37.640]  elements among our allies including the zionist government of israel that would be equally happy
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:49.800]  to screw the big or great satan saudi arabia and it goes on an individual who said he worked as a
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:58.040]  first responder an emergency manager in texas also called in to the alexio shown sonny to assert
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:02.280]  that the bot's response to Ebola outbreak in the united states was on purpose i don't think
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:06.840]  she's not asserting it it doesn't matter if the guy was an emergency manager or not even though
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:11.960]  clearly he was it's in the manuals what the default is we need to do articles about that
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:18.200]  and about how what the caller just said it's a default stand-down we need to be focusing in on
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:22.680]  that that it is a stand-down why is there a stand-down why are the flights being allowed in when
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:26.360]  nobody else does okay and we're still saying is it is it no it is
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:36.440]  so let's go ahead and play that clip a short clip of the steel interview the full clip is
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:43.080]  linked under it as well info wars.com prisonplanet.com retweet the story to cause a debate about this
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:48.920]  CIA insider warned of Ebola false flag in september here it is they will have another false flag in
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:54.280]  fact the the false flag i'm hearing about is a simulated Ebola attack in which they actually
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:47:00.440]  use biochemical weapons that that dissipate but then they pretended it's Ebola and that it has been
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:06.840]  brought here by saudi martyrs okay so no we have not reached the end of the false flag line however
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:12.280]  what we have reached is i i did my first graduate thesis on predicting revolution and there's a
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:17.880]  difference between preconditions of revolution and precipitants and i have posted a graphic on
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:23.400]  preconditions of revolution that exist in the usa today now a precipitant is like the tunisian
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:29.080]  fruit seller my preferred precipitant is a soccer mom that torches herself on the steps of capitol
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:35.240]  hill and it appears on youtube but the bottom line is the next false flag could lead to a general
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:43.000]  strike across this country all right and again you see the full interview at info wars.com i'm
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.080]  going to go to break and come back with more of your calls and open phones right into the third hour
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:55.320]  the issue isn't even for me the Ebola i mean i didn't think it would come here two months ago
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:58.920]  and then they sort of bring in an infected people and i said that's never been done before that's
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:05.240]  against the law no one's even pointing that out in the news clearly they want a cover as i said a
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:09.880]  few months ago a month and a half ago a cover for when it does break out they can blame it on something
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:14.200]  and then they let this guy fly and had been in the hospital and knew he had Ebola
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:19.480]  to vomit and spew and go to the hospital here and diarrhea all over the place and i mean undoubtedly
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:24.360]  he gave it to people if it's real Ebola and they're saying it is and and then now just don't worry
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:31.800]  about it you know go to sleep everything's fine what do you think's going on why would government
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:36.280]  act like this why would our border be wide open why would herald over vera say it's racist not
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:43.960]  want everybody to have open borders when clearly this country is under siege i mean no one other
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:51.080]  african countries bordering it's important Sierra Leone and others have locked down their borders i
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:57.800]  mean our government does whatever is bad i mean it really comes out of that it's so over the top
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:03.320]  they have the Dallas police trying to chase down who was around this guy instead of the feds and
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:08.440]  that this is a federal issue it's a local issue as well because there's public harm you know taking
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:12.760]  place here but the main purview is the feds and they have the giant budget so they're doing nothing
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.280]  just like they ordered the police to stand out at Katrina and cut the police radio towers down and

[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:23.000]  reporter on the ground with Josh Owens up in Dallas is going to give us his take on what
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:29.560]  he saw in Dallas at the bottom of the next hour again this is Paul Watson's new story
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:35.880]  apocalypse scenario discoverer of Ebola fears virus can mutate professor warns of humanitarian
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:40.680]  catastrophe one of it does go airborne and they'll say sorry we got to let the planes fly in
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:45.560]  and then just everybody starts dying in mass and they'll probably give Obama a peace prize or
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:52.280]  something and if you don't support getting Ebola you're racist i'm not even joking at this point
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:58.680]  it's getting so insane right now let's continue with your phone calls john in california you're on
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:07.240]  the air go ahead Alex the only way to deal with criminals is by force the political option is off
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:15.000]  the table banners not going anywhere obama is not going anywhere you claim that 80 to 90 percent of
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:21.240]  the military listen to your program and there are military officers inside the Pentagon that know
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:28.280]  about the u.s. equivalent of operation valkyrie i'll just be clear for a minute i'm not saying 89
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:32.920]  percent of military listens to my show i'm saying for what i've seen on the ground and what my other
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:39.320]  sources have said 89 percent are now awake that our government runs al-qaeda that there's a criminal
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:44.680]  group that's taken over but they're all compartmentalized and don't know what to do either they are
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:50.520]  becoming belligerent you know in congress saying no your allies are arming al-qaeda no we don't
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:55.000]  want to be part of this the british military is doing the same thing so those are positive issues
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:56:01.720]  but i mean you know to sit here on air and talk about a military coup for those that don't know
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:07.320]  operation valkyrie was a continuity of government program the nazis had so they reversed it to try
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:13.320]  to use it to overthrow hitler and it did not work here's another problem obama is just a puppet
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:21.240]  you'd have to remove the entire group of oligarchs and they they run the pension funds the banks
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:28.120]  everything it's so deep it has to be a complete cultural revolution not supporting globalist
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:33.240]  institutions and moving away from them and and just decrying them and not complying
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:39.560]  and then they're going to start a physical war in a civil war but that's better than going the
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:45.960]  coup route in my view listen the globalist might blow obama's head off and i hope they don't
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:50.680]  and turn him into a martyr don't think that's not a rabbit in the hat they hadn't been thinking about
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:54.600]  can you imagine they'll use some white supremacists or something they drug up to take the fall
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:57:00.280]  and they'll kill a body double and obama will retire to wherever i mean he is a pure fake
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:05.480]  so i've war game this it's easy to sit back and say have the military
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:11.720]  tell you you got two minutes to break what are you saying what i'm saying is that this
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:17.320]  you're right the oligarchs are entrenched but we can arrest the entire leadership who are all
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:23.800]  puppets of them put them on display put them on trial and you may not know this but stop and
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:31.320]  berg who led the coup in nazi germany compiled a list of civilians loyal germans that could take
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:37.160]  over they would hand it over to the civilians to deal with the criminals once hitler was dead
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:42.440]  that's why they failed because they failed to kill hitler we don't want to see anybody get killed
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:47.720]  we want them arrested we want to put them on trial the only people that can deal with this
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:53.800]  and i say we take our chance with the military because we don't have time a bowl is on our back
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:58.200]  they're going to start another false flag any moment now and the moment that happens is when
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:04.680]  the military should move against them well i'll tell you that that's exactly the type of stuff
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:10.040]  that's being talked about and i'm just a radio host trying to analyze this and warn the people
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:15.800]  it's way above my head it's way above everybody's head and of course they brought the oboe and
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:19.640]  of course they're trying to spread it i mean it's just they're horrible i mean we're in the hands
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:24.920]  of total demons and the churches are government run so they won't tell anybody i mean we are in so
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:30.120]  much trouble just like those 54 million babies who are in trouble who are murdered in this country
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:37.480]  it's called judgment folks and i don't know what we do rather than spread the word i mean it's just
[01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:43.080]  it's it's we'll be right back stay with us it's so heavy in reality it's so much stranger than fiction
[01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:48.920]  god help us god forgive us for all we've done i mean we're a nation of demons let's just be honest

[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:55.160]  you're on the air hi forever listener first-time caller um let me get right to the point uh are
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:01:02.600]  we not living in the script of the for vendetta except for the one important difference at least
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:09.400]  there they had the vaccine for their false flag uh pandemic outbreak already ready to go before
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:17.000]  the dictator was allowed to take power you're absolutely right sir i hadn't even thought about
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:24.520]  that since darryl mcbrain made that great um peace showing v for vendetta and other films
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:30.520]  tied into the current Ebola outbreak that's a great point and uh and then next uh and the real
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:38.120]  topic of my call was uh what what if anything can we do about it well what i've done is to start a
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:47.240]  facebook community page called ban Ebola flights now and what i'm doing is aggregating all the real
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:56.760]  stories from info wars uh health ranger and other sources and calling for people to badger their
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:04.440]  senators and congressmen not via email but rather phone calls overwhelm the uh the uh
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:11.240]  capital switchboard and demand that these flights be banned regardless of the of the poop that the
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:18.440]  cdc is is spewing and because they still care about the outcome uh and their fate uh from the
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.880]  uh you know the upcoming midterm election they may actually listen if enough people
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:28.520]  are screaming for it and at least we can take that much of this matter into our own hands
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:34.360]  well very well said marty uh why do you and your gut think that they're obviously there's no debating
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:39.240]  it letting Ebola in trying to spread it i mean that's just an absolute fact how would they
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:46.920]  try to do that so openly so arrogantly what is wrong with them or or do they know something i
[02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:53.160]  don't know i think that leads to the to the second point i wanted to discuss and and i'll try to do
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:59.160]  it very quickly the i'm sure you're familiar with the the phenomenon psychologically of cognitive
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:07.240]  dissonance yes okay well for those who don't just quickly it's it's people cannot believe that something
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:13.480]  that they have never experienced could possibly happen especially when it goes against their
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:18.920]  belief system or their comfort that's right america has been spared bad stuff for so long
[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:22.760]  we're like native americans that have never experienced smallpox it wipes us all out
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:30.520]  we have no immunity we have no resistance exactly and so uh you take that to the point well we're
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:37.080]  just like 9 11 our government couldn't possibly and wouldn't possibly do that and if you believe
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:43.240]  that you must be crazy same thing here how could the government that's that's here to protect us
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:49.240]  uh you know just do everything in their power to make sure that uh we are not only unprotected
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:55.400]  but we're overtly exposed you know you know i feel sorry for is the firefighters the medical
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:59.320]  workers and the police they are going to be the ones of this if this really breaks out they're
[02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:03.320]  going to be wallowing in it i mean they are going to be getting it in record numbers just like they
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:10.760]  have in africa what day if i was a emt or a cop right now i'd be so angry well exactly why do

[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:24.440]  eric tom donna's phone calls but first uh let's go to this piece
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:31.480]  well it sounds like the perfect script for a horror movie a virus with no vaccine and no cure
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:40.280]  kills thousands of people by being people died in 1996 and 1997 it was the entire population of the
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:47.400]  world only about one percent of us survived reports of blue cases along the border but
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:51.960]  officials are seeing the art connected surely there's very real and very convincing data
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:56.680]  that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race and i actually think the world
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:02.920]  will be much better when there's only 10 or 20 percent of us left dr eric piyanka but most
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:09.720]  frightening was the fact that in a crowd of over 1 000 prominent scientists local newspapers reported
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:17.640]  that 95 percent of those in attendance gave piyanka sustained standing ovations every time he
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:24.840]  stole the virtues of mass culling microbes and man's destruction and went on to laud the virtues of
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:31.400]  abola because it would kill 90 percent of the world population quickly the world health organization
[02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:38.600]  said on Tuesday the abola death toll jumped by almost 200 in a single day to at least 2296
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:44.200]  and is likely to be higher than that the head of the u.s centers for disease control confirmed
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:49.480]  Tuesday that west africa is in desperate situation but that there is still hope that the
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:56.840]  autoprx can be reigned a top german virologist has caused shock waves by asserting that it's too late
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:03.240]  to halt the spread of the ebola virus in other news the cdc is receiving reports of a possible
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:09.400]  flu outbreak in san francisco if the symptoms were first detected in philadelphia on december 27
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:16.440]  1996 that makes us know that it was released in philadelphia probably on december 13 1996
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:22.920]  and was seen sequentially after that year san francisco new Orleans real de Janeiro

[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:40.680]  some trip you're taking sir is this all in one week business one of the two americans
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:46.840]  infected with the ebola virus has arrived in atlanta from africa for treatment the massachusetts
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:52.840]  doctor arrived at the negraska medical center just before dawn this morning to be treated for ebola
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:58.600]  and right now his or her blood sample is on its way to the centers for disease control the new
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:05.800]  ability to wage war is born from the blood to run for the victims there you see also invisible to the
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:15.560]  naked eye it doesn't even have an odor this ebola outbreak is unprecedented and has become the
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:23.960]  deadliest on record ebola is now an epidemic uh you start to get a sense of the rapid escalation
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:30.760]  now we're seeing of the virus imagine a virus the most terrifying virus you can then imagine
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:37.240]  that you and you alone have the cure without specific drugs or a vaccine for ebola the only
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:43.400]  thing doctors can do for those suffering from this disease is treat their symptoms ebola is not
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:49.960]  spread through the air like the flu one will not likely catch the virus just by nearing someone
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:57.800]  who has it in 1989 ebola made its way to the us this new strain of ebola had shown the potential
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:05.400]  to spread through the air they're now calling this a true pandemic five years on still no cure no cure
[02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:11.720]  the bill in melinda gates foundation has given 31 million pounds to help battle the ebola epidemic
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:17.000]  in africa it is hoped it will also speed up the development of drugs and vaccines as ebola has
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:24.440]  killed more than half of its 4300 victims uh first we've got population now if we do a really great
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:31.720]  job on new vaccines healthcare we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent a preventative
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:36.840]  vaccine for the ebola virus could be available as early as next year as british pharma company
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:43.560]  a galaxosmith client so you want to balance the need to get a potentially effective vaccine to
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:49.400]  the people who need it in a way that you can get some meaningful information as to a whether it does
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:55.240]  work or not and whether it does harm a confidential galaxosmith client document recently linked to
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:14:01.400]  the press exposed that within a two-year period a total of 36 infants died after receiving the six
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:09.080]  in one vaccine of infrex hexa uk pharmaceutical giant galaxosmith client will plead guilty and
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:15.000]  pay a record breaking three billion us dollars to settle the largest case of healthcare fraud
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:21.240]  in us history going right out to get vaccinated the vaccine uses a modified chimpanzee common
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:28.360]  cold virus carry a single ebola protein we're ready to move on to the next phase does it work
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:35.400]  like we predicted with one exception we can't dawdle on this one we have to move uh with force
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:42.680]  and make sure that uh we are catching this as best we can nearly two and a half thousand people
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:48.120]  have died thousands more have been infected and made an international call for action president
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:53.400]  obama announced america's plan which will see three thousand us troops head to the region
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:59.240]  three thousand us military personnel compare that to iraq there are 1600 us military troops in iraq
[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:03.720]  right now we're talking about three thousand troops but the true goal of this project is power
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:09.400]  complete and total hegemonic domination at the request of the librarian government we're going
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:16.280]  to establish a military command center in liberia under the pretext of humanitarian aid and dominate
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:22.760]  and occupy africa through african the security firm halo corp announcer will conduct a zombie

[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:40.440]  thousand military and law enforcement members using this technique we got down to a science if
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:47.720]  you will if there is such a thing it's an art it's a government made virus designed manufactured
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:53.000]  to put us out of our misery they euthanized us probably one of these numbers is going to have
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  to get pretty near to zero now that's back from a high school algebra but let's let's take a look
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:05.800]  attention due to the extremity of the simian flu crisis all regular government functions
[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:12.600]  have been suspended if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:20.760]  we have a global elite who in every publication eco science list goes on and on current white
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:27.000]  house science are all they talk about is releasing mega bio weapons to reduce our numbers and now
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.800]  they're leaving the borders wide open letting aircraft fly in from infected countries and
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:38.120]  not even cleaning up from people that have a boa it's here and i'm sure we'll do nothing knowing
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:43.160]  us they'll abort some more babies and watch some more sports center folks it's what you want it's
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:49.880]  what you get and when the core of sand or ices hits us they'll take more of our rights as well
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:57.320]  even though they publicly fund them because after all those babies weren't humans and now they say
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:01.480]  kill old people they're not humans either you're not a human you're bank accounted in yours and
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:08.600]  doesn't matter the trendies acl's here in austin right now here the rock bands and act cool that's
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:14.600]  really matters you can see how the people of the west are just like ready to be slaughtered just
[02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:20.680]  begging for it begging the new order to crush them and the new order will oblige you they'll give you
[02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:26.360]  everything you ever wanted you act like sheep to wolves they'll tear your guts out
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:36.440]  let's go to bill in iowa than alex bill you're on the air go ahead thank you for holding alex i just
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:46.040]  got two quick points the first uh when mr duncan was uh sent home after two days uh the first time
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:53.000]  primarily it was because he had no insurance nobody in the media has reported that that's what
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:57.800]  hospitals do if you have no insurance and you go in with the flu they will send you home well that's
[02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:01.960]  right before obama care they would take care of you but now obama care lets them refuse care
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:07.320]  they've gotten rid of the Hippocratic oath absolutely yeah and secondly uh when the influence
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:12.920]  of a virus kicks in here in a couple months we're going to see an outbreak of ebola because
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:17.400]  they will be airborne well a lot of doctors i've had on medical doctors have said it could
[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:21.320]  mutate with all of these new vaccines they're giving people and with all the different flu
[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:27.320]  bugs out there they say that'll cause it to mutate um you sit on the screen you're an emt or you're
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:34.120]  gonna uh it says emt quitting in two weeks is that accurate right well the hospital i work for it
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:39.960]  doesn't even want to provide us with biosuits or have really no plan on providing us with biosuits
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:43.320]  well a biosuit would be a racist sir you need to get Ebola that proves you're loving
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:47.800]  well you know if you respond to a call and somebody's in a car crash and there's blood
[02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:53.240]  flying all over the place they you know it you don't have to have symptoms to still get Ebola
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:19:00.680]  maybe the guy you can't profile Ebola so once the outbreak starts uh you know you're not going to
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:06.120]  know so every call you're going to have to be on a be wearing a biosuit or uh you're going to get
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:12.600]  exposed well even if a few hundred people get it it's going to cause hysteria and panic and
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.560]  i just think Obama's done a great job and we should all get Ebola and i agree that babies
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:24.040]  aren't babies and two plus two equals whatever they say isn't that just easier just to wear different
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:30.840]  color socks at trendy and uh you know support banning freedom i mean it isn't that good
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:39.320]  i mean come on the president is a peace prize winner he funded al-qaeda that's
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:44.440]  i'm being sarcastic now here all right thank you sir alex donna tom eric and others your calls

[02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:40.280]  so much potential for mischief in governments and corporations scooping up these pathogens like obola
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:43.720]  which we know our government and other governments have been messing with for more than 30 years
[02:24:43.720 --> 02:24:48.040]  alex in wisconsin thanks for calling thanks for holding her on the air worldwide
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:54.440]  what's up alex i've worked in mold asbestos remediation and bioclean up for over 20 years
[02:24:54.440 --> 02:24:59.960]  similar to the uh cleanup guys seen on cn cleaning that a bowl of victims apartment
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:06.760]  yes and i just got to say i use more precautionary methods with painting moldy addicts than i've seen
[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:12.200]  with this a bowl of scare i mean they were using blue painter's tape to seal the seams on those
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:18.520]  their biohazard suits which leads me to believe that this is either a fake slash false flag or
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:25.560]  the point zero one percent state wants us to spread it break down why you say that
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:33.960]  why i say that they're um not using precautionary methods or why i think i mean i mean i mean as
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:41.160]  an expert what you saw well you know when we put on the biohazard suits um and the suits in general
[02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:47.240]  either thivex suits or the plastic ceiling suits uh every seam the ankles the wrist
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:52.440]  around the stays uh everywhere it connects to other parts of the biohazard suit we use a special
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:26:00.120]  type of chemical biohazard tape and seal it up it also comes in every uh federal grade biohazard
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:07.400]  suit like chemical tape similar to duct tape and um they weren't using that they were wearing their
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:13.480]  normal normal shoes walking around and you know it's a fine particulate uh viruses and
[02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:18.920]  molds and asbestos you know and it can get everywhere and you try not to make it spread
[02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:24.360]  and it seems like you know they were just kind of making a scene making the show that they were
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:30.440]  kind of cleaning up but not really doing the due diligence on what is you know the standards in
[02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:36.920]  this industry well that's what the other hazmat people have been saying when they call in i've
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:41.560]  read the manuals that's what they say this whole thing stinks to high heaven and may just be a
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:47.080]  simulant obola might not even be in the us other than these patients being flown over here who knows
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:52.280]  if that's even true when you're dealing with the liars of this magnitude you really don't know what
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:58.120]  the truth is thank you so much for the call but days before that they had the apartment workers
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:04.680]  cleaning up the vomit so it just shows a total breakdown of the government bureaucracy either
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:14.280]  way you slice it it's just total incompetence or total evil but even an incompetent government
[02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:19.000]  could do it everybody else did shut down these flights donna in new york thanks for holding
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:24.760]  you're on the air i was watching morning joe on september 30th and rick perry was on
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:30.040]  he was talking about how he had just met with henry kissinger prepping for the 2016 presidential
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:38.040]  election fast forward literally a few hours that same day obola's in texas then yesterday the ap
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:46.760]  headline obola case gives perry real-time leadership test i know there's a lot of facets too a false
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:51.800]  flag but this is one they're testing to see if people will back perry so he can be the next
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:58.680]  puppet do not trust rick perry at all well rick perry did work with the big vaccine makers for
[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:04.840]  bio tyranny when he said it's the law with murk you've got to take garter cell h pv shot and
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:11.800]  there was no law it was all a giant hoax and then he went to bilderberg and the republicans i know
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:17.640]  said that they thought he'd be the frontrunner in 2012 but he he didn't make it because of
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:23.560]  back surgery and he was drugged up on tv and bummed around a little bit but i know rick
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:28.760]  perry is a frontrunner right now with the insiders i mean ran paul's the frontrunner
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:34.280]  with with republican libertarian voters i know he's just a great guy especially compared to rick
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:40.120]  perry but uh i was keeping perry out of this when they were politically going after him saying
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:44.920]  you better do a good job of the bola but but but now he won't ask obama to seal seal the borders
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:51.720]  or to stop the flights he's saying well check people at the border and maybe check people
[02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:55.160]  when they got off the plane so that's better than nothing but but why do you have to get
[02:28:55.160 --> 02:29:01.000]  called out by governor jindal before he did that that's a big question i think some of it is remember
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:05.480]  when um even you were backing him with the indictment they did that on purpose they did that
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:10.840]  indictment so then people who even criticized him you're like hey you know poor rick perry oh they're
[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:15.960]  going after him so i think they were trying to make him sympathetic to people who normally would be
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:21.240]  right against him so they were using that too but just to get back to the garter cell in new york
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:27.400]  state there's all kinds of commercials for garter cell now oh yeah they literally say it cures i mean
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:33.800]  it stops cancer even though the insert says it doesn't protect you doesn't cover the papilloma

[02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:47.480]  is joe biggs a veteran of afghanistan and iraq now a veteran of patient zero in the north america
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:53.880]  in dallas texas joe you were there for three days uh with our intrepid cameraman who's also
[02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:58.600]  seen some adventures josh owens uh while he's been here give us your take on what you witnessed and
[02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:04.280]  where you see all this going um it doesn't look good the cdc wants to tell you that everything's
[02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:09.880]  fine but just that press conference we went to shows the unprofessionalism that that they have
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:14.600]  there in their ranks the fact that i asked them don't you think that we should be doing something
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:19.000]  about stopping the flights from west africa coming in to america and they laughed at me and they
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:22.360]  thought that that was funny i don't think that's a funny thing to joke by the way we should take
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:27.800]  that video even though it happened last wednesday and post it right now with the headline cdc laughs
[02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:32.600]  at stopping flights from africa because three days after you did that they started responding
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:37.720]  saying quote stopping flights would make it worse yeah that's the most ridiculous thing i've ever
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:42.440]  heard how does stopping how does it get cut off at the head and stopping it in this tracks how does
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:47.640]  that make it worse you know if we don't fly it over here by the way great job going to get those
[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:52.840]  questions in yeah i mean you had to fight through all those reporters please continue yeah i mean
[02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:56.760]  i just don't understand their their logic they are saying that stopping that is going to make it
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:36:01.080]  worse i don't understand how that happens but just the overall the press conference just the
[02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:05.640]  snide remarks from the uh the people there that were talking like governor perry had nothing to
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:10.840]  say even about abola really i mean it was just gibber jabber he was there just as a political
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:17.240]  figure to to parade around to kind of take i would say the eyes off the subject kind of in a sense
[02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:23.080]  you know it was uh it was just a big uh dog and pony show well i saw the video where they laugh at
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:27.400]  you why aren't you moving to shut down the flights you notice governor general isn't laughing you
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:31.560]  notice everybody else isn't laughing you notice the state governors aren't laughing and all these
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:36.120]  letters getting written why isn't our governor calling for that yeah i mean and they were sitting
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:40.360]  there well that's something that we can't do i'm like well you know you're the governor you talk to
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:45.800]  the president and regardless of anybody on this panel that's here today can do anything about it
[02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:51.400]  every eye in america was watching that's total buck passing yeah it's it's other countries shut down
[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:55.560]  the flight shut down the flight to go over a month ago and what are they doing bringing them in like
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:37:00.600]  spain did it it's now spreading yeah and then no one's going to get in trouble what are they doing
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:06.520]  bringing abola victims into our countries and then governor perry goes and says that texas the uh
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:12.200]  the medical staff is the most well equipped to handle this meanwhile the person at the lowest
[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:17.800]  tier level getting someone off the street doesn't even know to pass it up the chain that hey this
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:23.160]  guy just came in from liberia he's showing possible signs of uh you know the abola virus
[02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:28.520]  and they send them off with antibiotics i mean that shows if it if it happens at that low level
[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:32.680]  and they're not giving that information and pushing it down to the first responders we're all
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:38.600]  screwed um it's unbelievable remember a month and a half ago when we warned of this the national
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:42.280]  media oh they said we were crazy they said that we were just conspiracy theorists out of our mind
[02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:47.080]  and here it is well notice how they laugh to you though yeah i mean we go down to the city council
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:51.800]  and we say we don't want the city of austin try to ban guns and say limits and they laugh at us
[02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:55.640]  when they're at trower we don't want fluoride here's harvard study at increases cancer
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:37:59.560]  lowers IQ they laugh at us hey we don't want you flying abola people into the country
[02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:08.040]  ha ha ha that's all they got is ha ha ha it's the smart mouth swarmy attitude isis isn't on
[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:12.520]  its way it's already here abola isn't on its way it's already here tyranny isn't on it isn't on
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:19.160]  its way it's already here you know this is crazy the times we live in and these are the people
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:22.600]  that are supposed to be doing something meanwhile they're they're laughing they're joking they're
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:27.400]  not taking this serious i think they have a huge ego problem they're they're afraid to admit that
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:31.000]  this is something that can get out of control yeah because obama said there wasn't going to happen
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:35.720]  there was no fear no no problem not likely and now they're just like oh it's no big deal it's
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:38.920]  not going to spread everything so you know it's funny though they come out and say that these
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:44.520]  people who go to uh west africa have the right to return but meanwhile we have sergeant to morsey
[02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:48.760]  in mexico he doesn't have a right to return and our government's not going to do anything for him
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:52.760]  well this guy isn't even a citizen that flew in yeah and turned out he had abola knew he had it
[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:58.440]  and came here everyone but citizens has rights in this country yeah that's true we have nothing
[02:38:58.440 --> 02:39:05.240]  anymore it's sad to say that we we we live in a time now in our own country where as citizens
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:11.560]  law-abiding citizens we're now terrorists but isis gets rocket launchers yeah and they get
[02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:16.600]  free rein to go over they want illegals are paid given bus tickets and you know able to fly
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:23.400]  for across the country without even any kind of identification whatsoever i mean like it's like uh
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:30.040]  twilight zone yeah what about this ap headline militants fbi says maybe working on plan to strike
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:34.760]  us fbi director warren's of course on attack says that it's an imminent attack in the us
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:39.400]  when they blow stuff up or if they do or shoot up a school you know they're gonna say we gotta turn
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:45.880]  our guns under something or it'll be liberty's fault msnbc had a headline yesterday second
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:52.360]  amendment in our right to blame for abola with with no reason or why so well the course on thing
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:57.000]  too though was obama's way of because obama or was it a couple years ago said that we had already
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:02.120]  you know defeated al-qaeda basically you know we we've already suppressed that we're done with them
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:06.680]  so now they're using a different name to kind of so he can cover his own tracks in a sense and
[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:11.400]  he doesn't want to admit once again because of his ego that he was wrong about that and he's
[02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:16.120]  overestimated everything so they're giving it a new name so it doesn't look as bad so we can't
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:20.920]  say that i made a mistake this is cognitive dissonance though because they know the american
[02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:25.480]  people faced with something this monster is open borders government funding al-qaeda government
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:30.680]  bringing in abola government bankrupting the pension funds government just trying to push us
[02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:36.440]  over cliff they're trying to wreck the country the people that run the country want to bring us down
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:40.280]  while using us to build their world government that when that's ready they're done with us so
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:45.720]  they're getting us ready that's why everything they do is to shut the country down do you get it
[02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:53.240]  folks yeah it's i i can't stand to see where this is going like every day i wake up and i have to
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:58.280]  read these headlines and i'm just like i i can't believe this is real sometimes i pinch myself i
[02:40:58.280 --> 02:41:02.040]  think i'm still dreaming well here's some good news the british military came out and told their
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:06.840]  parliament's top funding radical islamist system that the west is behind this our own joint chiefs
[02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:11.640]  i know have been telling capitol hill that so there is some good news that even the military brass
[02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:16.520]  who are very political understand this has gotten out of control i mean this is this has gotten out
[02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:22.680]  of control yeah on all fronts i mean you know the borders open on the ground we're we're leaving our
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:27.960]  air uh airspace open for these flights to come in it's a complete and total planned event what
[02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:32.920]  happens as five million people in africa get it as they're estimating between one one point four
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:37.960]  and five and they all try to flee here we're just going to accept unlimited abola just just come on in
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:43.320]  but meanwhile they got checkpoints on the highways it's a joke yeah i mean you see how quickly that
[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:49.560]  one person one person affects so many people you know the you shake someone tan you talk to somebody
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:53.480]  you know you get some people they're close talkers and spit when they talk one person can affect
[02:41:53.480 --> 02:41:59.160]  a hundred people so this is why i i thought it was so unprofessional at that conference that they
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:04.840]  were laughing at questions like that laughing this is not a joking matter whatsoever well that's why
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:10.520]  everything's a joke abortions a joke tyrannies a joke adulterated foods a joke genomes a joke
[02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:16.360]  it's more than just a corrupt establishment it's a bunch of trendies who literally have never been
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:20.680]  faced with anything in their lives who just get paychecks and are lazy and they think everything's
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:24.600]  funny joe they don't know what the real world's like i guess yeah they're firing officers in the
[02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:28.920]  military meanwhile they're bringing in all these illegals that come in to join and be in the military
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:36.360]  they're bringing in these voters it's it's one big stage thing it's a bunch of lawyers and people
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:42.280]  loot in the country yeah this is a lawyer mindset of just screw everything up and then bill on both
[02:42:42.280 --> 02:42:52.360]  sides it's disgusting to see this it just every day we we go out here and we try to do what we can
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:57.080]  to tell people about this stuff but there's so many people that just sit down and don't even
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:02.040]  pay attention they won't wake up whatsoever i just don't understand with all this going on right now
[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:07.240]  this should be the largest awakening we should have right now in people with all this well i'm
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:12.200]  not putting folks in the 20s and 30s on a pedestal but i knew my grandfathers and grandmothers they
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:19.720]  were hardworking smart cool people who didn't take any crap either and they knew how to skin a buck
[02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:23.880]  run a trot line they didn't know how to do electrical they knew how to make cheese they knew
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:30.920]  how to can food they enjoyed working and then i think about how i am lazy and pathetic compared
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:35.160]  to them and i'm super hardworking and know how to do a lot more stuff than general public so but i
[02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:40.360]  can see the degeneration i mean my dad you know grew up on a farm in a ranch so he knows how to do
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:44.040]  everything i don't know how to do stuff my dad does how to do and i think about my kids and my
[02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:47.320]  kids are great compared to a lot of kids but they don't know how to do anything just because i'm so
[02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:52.040]  busy you know my dad taught me how to live off the land he's taught him to be a businessman to quote
[02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:56.280]  hank williams jr and the only thing i got are the old timers is how to shoot and fight and that's
[02:43:56.280 --> 02:44:02.920]  about it and i look at all these skills lost seven million people major university studies
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:08.920]  starved to death or died of complications from bad nutrition in the 10 years of the great depression
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:16.200]  90 percent were rural most of them self-sufficient we're now 90 percent urban of the 10 percent
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:23.000]  that are rural half are self-sufficient we have a collapse we have a depression we have a major
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:28.600]  Ebola or smallpox outbreak or something like that can you imagine what all these yuppies and people
[02:44:28.600 --> 02:44:32.840]  that just don't want to play with their iphone and act cool all day can you imagine when the hell
[02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:37.400]  hits the fan what that's going to be like with these people all i got to say thank god i'm sitting
[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:43.400]  on a pile of guns and food yeah they're not ready for anything like that i mean like you said most
[02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:47.640]  people don't have an attention span past the the length of their arm because all they do is stare at
[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:53.480]  their phone all day all night non-stop then comes down to fighting they can't do it you know that's
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:58.520]  why drones are so popular it's easy you've taken that emotional connection away from combat like how
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:02.760]  it used to be back in the day you actually had to stab someone you saw their eyes dilate that's a
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:07.000]  life change experience now people can just push a button and then go on about their day and it
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:11.160]  doesn't affect them i read about you in a magazine stabbing al-qaeda guy what was that like or is it
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:19.480]  a conny guy yeah uh taliban why'd you stab instead of shoot him just um i don't know i guess i was
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:23.800]  caught up in the moment i would say well as you jumped off on the vehicle on him yeah what was
[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:29.320]  the story yeah they were shooting at us and i jumped up off the vehicle and uh ran up the hill
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:35.560]  and i was trying to avoid being shot you know basically and uh i snuck around and just gashed
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:43.080]  the guy right inside it worked pretty well yeah but uh it's like i said when you experience something
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:47.400]  like that you never want to see something like that ever again you never want to to go through
[02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:51.240]  anything like that again and you you try to tell people that it's the most horrific horrible thing
[02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:55.560]  ever you know and that's why with these drones that's what scares me because you take that emotional
[02:45:55.560 --> 02:45:59.720]  connection away from seeing something like that it's just like playing a video game it's easy to
[02:45:59.720 --> 02:46:04.200]  push a button and then go home to your kids when that one button you pushed killed thousands of
[02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:07.480]  people but you didn't have to witness that you don't have to well that's like Kurt Vonnegut you
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:11.720]  know was in the planes bombing and then he was on the ground being bombed so slaughterhouse fives
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:17.240]  about in germany at po w being bombed by his own guys and that was my dad's dad you know did his
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:21.400]  missions and then was on the ground going into italy and germany and that was really freaked him out
[02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:26.360]  was the starving kids and the bombed out cities and the dead people everywhere and and then you
[02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:30.040]  know really make them the connection while i was in planes flying above bombing people
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:33.480]  just a month ago well that's what the crazy thing with what's going on in siri right now
[02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:37.240]  i don't understand why we didn't attack isis ice or whatever you want to call them when they were
[02:46:37.240 --> 02:46:42.040]  storming into iraq on that convoy they were bumper to bumper a couple coordinated targets
[02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:48.200]  could have taken them out now they're all in syria and they're in populated areas with heavy collateral
[02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:54.040]  damage you know we're we're not this has nothing to do with isis this is purely a regime change
[02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:58.280]  they want to put in their own western puppet that's going to play ball and that's what they
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:02.760]  want it has nothing to do with isis that's just a beard they want syria they've been wanting
[02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:06.360]  the next thing that they'll move on they even have a saudi ambassador admitting it
[02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:11.800]  oh and then biden goes oh we're sorry you need to stop doing they how dare you any grovels
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:16.520]  they're all on tv admitting they're behind this that's how dumb they think we are
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:20.680]  makes you want to throw up a president will salute a marine with a coffee cup in his hand
[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:25.640]  i mean that's one of the things that i i went on a rant for about three days i had not furious
[02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:32.680]  you know i was just so mad i mean that's the most disrespectful thing you're gonna make decisions
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:38.520]  that put young men and women in harm's way meanwhile you can't even give them the the proper
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:46.520]  respect to take a coffee cup out of your hand and give them a salute i mean this is how i mean
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:51.800]  that's right here in front of your face the president doesn't even care anybody just sounds
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:55.880]  like a nation getting ready to fall to me i'm gonna say it right now i really think the country's
[02:47:55.880 --> 02:48:01.560]  going to completely collapse i mean i really think everybody should have an exit plan i'm
[02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:06.920]  going to stay here because it's it's worldwide collapse but i just feels the yuppies are just
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:10.120]  going to tear us apart whenever thing collapses and those inner cities are going to burn and
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:14.520]  no one will even care about that either we're just a nation that's we're like the romans
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:18.840]  in 410 they've been sacked but they couldn't even get up and fight when the barbarians were coming
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:23.160]  in they were laughing and you know having sex parties as the barbarians came in and then murdered
[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:28.920]  them all i mean that that's what they want though they they've created such a the next generations
[02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:33.480]  coming through they're they're giving these bogus educations you know the two two plus two is five
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:38.120]  you know when it comes down to to a time when they really need to defend themselves stand up
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:41.400]  and fight back they're not going to know how to do it and that's what they want the number one
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:45.480]  crime is for a kid to fight back against a bully now because they don't want you to know how to
[02:48:45.480 --> 02:48:50.680]  defend yourself all right joe anything else you think it's important that you witness in dallas
[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:57.160]  just like i said don't believe this hype to the cdc saying that that they have this under control
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:00.840]  you know being their first hand it's they're very unprofessional they're not prepared for
[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:06.040]  this whatsoever so we as americans have to prepare ourselves and do what we can like you said a
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:10.760]  possible exit strategy or just have something things on stand by food water yeah because other
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:15.800]  companies aren't going to let the Ebola people in we are advertising just like they advertise if
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:19.720]  you're poor come here we'll pay for everything they're advertising here's where you come vomit
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:24.600]  if you've got Ebola you come hang your butt over america and just spewed Ebola feces all over us
[02:49:24.600 --> 02:49:29.240]  and obama wants that i mean i'm sorry to be gross but that's it you want to come vomit blood on us
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:36.120]  we're here yeah i mean i'm sorry to be gross that's what it is exactly we're a giant vomit bucket
[02:49:36.120 --> 02:49:43.960]  pretty much i mean they just america is an Ebola porta potty yeah and it feels bad to laugh but i
[02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:50.360]  mean it's such a joke of what's going on you know i mean this is the biggest joke in the world
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:54.360]  and people can literally go home right now and sit there and watch the tv and pretend like nothing's
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:59.400]  going on everybody right now should be mad exactly i hope it doesn't have a big outbreak i hope nothing

[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:51.480]  i want to am i on yes you are brother i promise okay all right i uh i want to make to give people
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:59.080]  an idea that i had actually just today about ebola but before that i i have something that i
[02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:05.160]  really wanted to say about fluoride and that you know compared to ebola it's sort of like
[02:56:05.160 --> 02:56:09.640]  comic relief well yeah but i mean it's a soft kill over time where they kill us slowly and
[02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:15.400]  enjoy it the cancer the acu reduction uh it's kind of 2 plus 2 equals 5 it's common core for all
[02:56:15.400 --> 02:56:22.600]  it's chemical common core but uh real fast tell us your points okay rapaport is one of the best
[02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:29.400]  people you ever have on and something he did back in 2003 i've heard you mention this that
[02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:37.160]  the ssri's prozac et cetera contain fluoride yeah but it's worse than that they actually
[02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:43.880]  are fluoride no no they control fluorine molecule and that's what they attach uh the other uh arms to
[02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:52.200]  it from chemist i've talked to yes it is weaponized electrically active fluorine basically yeah they call
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:57:00.280]  it fluoxetine flu oh admitting to you like you said it makes them happy they're laughing at us
[02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:05.800]  literally eat your brain yes it's it's it's they love us they care about us it's a stupid pill
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:11.160]  and i know it's very racist for me to you know to say that but that's right you should get a
[02:57:11.160 --> 02:57:14.520]  bowl or you're racist i gotta jump real quick brother gotta give everybody thank you tom
[02:57:14.520 --> 02:57:21.240]  eric in texas go ahead uh yeah i always good talk to you look uh card to me a while ago when i was
[02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:27.960]  listening that uh dis ebola when you start affecting your police and amt and all your
[02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:34.200]  infrastructure people your public servants uh there's another aspect of gay symmetric warfare
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:40.680]  that's it now what one of my other points is you know we should be getting really upset about
[02:57:40.680 --> 02:57:46.280]  the fact that i can't even live my life right now i'm sitting here with my phone in one hand and my
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:52.120]  go no go gauge in the other hand checking ammo this is not the way for americans to be ribbon
[02:57:52.840 --> 02:57:58.440]  and i've had to spend money that i could have put cows on my land on other preparations
[02:57:59.480 --> 02:58:06.520]  so you know i agree with the earlier caller that said we need to get a coalition of uh
[02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:13.800]  lawyers and military and whatever other forces we can get together and we need to take these people
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:20.440]  out of office if that's what it calls for then let's get it done okay well i know this letting
[02:58:20.440 --> 02:58:26.120]  a bunch of Ebola people into the us is treason nobody else does it our government is a bunch of
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:31.160]  scum at the top and that's and and then they're going to this is going to be hellish and they're
[02:58:31.160 --> 02:58:34.840]  all going to fly off in their jet airplanes while the low-level government people have to literally
[02:58:34.840 --> 02:58:39.240]  face an Ebola pandemic god bless you eric great points from texas we're going to come back a

[03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:07.320]  hey alex how you doing all right brother thanks for calling listen i just don't understand the
[03:01:08.280 --> 03:01:14.600]  americans in this country how they can listen to the audacity of the director of the cdc thomas
[03:01:14.600 --> 03:01:20.920]  freeden for the past month go up in front of congress on a national television and cause panic
[03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:27.240]  by continue continuously saying how out of control ebola is in africa and then in the same breath
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:32.680]  say nothing to worry about banning air travel into the u.s would make ebola war
[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:37.960]  that is a fantastic point so fantastic i started stuttering we should get his earlier press
[03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:43.080]  conference clips saying ebola is out of control and then cut to him saying let the flights come in
[03:01:43.080 --> 03:01:48.040]  that's how you stop it you know set your house on fire it's how you you know don't burn it down
[03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:56.680]  it's just why do you think he's so over the top you know this whole entire thing my you know i i had
[03:01:56.680 --> 03:02:02.840]  a revelation today i don't know it just came to my mind that their end game eventually ebola will
[03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:10.040]  go airborne and they will all of a sudden have the ebola vaccines ready to give out and because
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:15.080]  it's airborne it'll have to be vaccines that are mandatory and what better way to have the
[03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:21.160]  mandatory but then to bring in martial law and quarantine everybody in their homes and they
[03:02:21.160 --> 03:02:25.560]  can vaccinate you in your homes and they have martial law in place and if you refuse to take
[03:02:25.560 --> 03:02:31.720]  the vaccine well we know what we have fema camis we can bring you into for 21 days and then those
[03:02:31.720 --> 03:02:37.000]  people in the fema camis will have to stay i mean it's just such a perfect plan no that's it and it
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:41.080]  might mean next year it goes airborne or a year later they get the vaccine in place it's ready
[03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:46.120]  there's all this fear and then oh we've got it and oh you've got to take it uh that's been their
[03:02:46.120 --> 03:02:50.520]  past program i i really agree with you i think that's in the cards big time great points good to
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:56.280]  hear from you ron and canada you're on the air go ahead yes how you doing good brother hey uh just
[03:02:56.280 --> 03:03:00.840]  give me a story for two minutes i just want to make a couple points okay but ebola yeah we got
[03:03:00.840 --> 03:03:04.600]  two minutes till the show's over go ahead all right okay so here's what they're doing they're
[03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:10.120]  consuming all this bush meat down there in liberia right and they're spreading this ebola it wouldn't
[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:13.800]  have been a big problem i'm out here in canada we've known they've had that ebola out there for
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:18.360]  a long time but it was never a problem until we started letting them all in these guys are
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:23.880]  virtually sleeping they don't know what's going on obama is nothing but a gigantic puppet controlling
[03:03:23.880 --> 03:03:28.760]  a whole bunch of other puppets and they're all asleep too uh he can do basically virtually
[03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:34.760]  whatever he wants and that's what he's done i believe obama could be a muslim extremist
[03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:39.320]  he's taking control of the country asymmetrical warfare exactly like you said i've been a long
[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:43.960]  time listener of your show i love you you are amazing i totally agree with all your point
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:51.960]  about obama el bozo he is this is an attack he's controlling isis because he's muslim the white
[03:03:51.960 --> 03:03:57.240]  house is a control center for isis and he's the leader and i believe well i mean listen here's
[03:03:57.240 --> 03:04:03.320]  the deal what whatever he is by default it is the controlled center for al-qaeda and by default he is
[03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:09.400]  operating as the grand imam the madi and i've said that and i i'd used to disagree with glenn
[03:04:09.400 --> 03:04:14.600]  back and all those people uh but now for all intents and purposes they are creating the
[03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:21.480]  clash of civilizations to bring in a world conflict that albert pike talked about in 1877
[03:04:21.480 --> 03:04:26.680]  and it's off the charts i appreciate your call sorry to andrew paul tom and others i'm out of time
