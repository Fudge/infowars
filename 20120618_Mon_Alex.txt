[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:33.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.680]  what happens with tyranny what happens with corruption it happens with toxic
[00:38.680 --> 00:44.480]  waste dumping radiation leaks you name it what happens with evil is that people
[00:44.480 --> 00:53.000]  become acclimated and accustomed to it myself included the ATF came out last
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.680]  year so they were going to ban most shotguns there was a big backlash and
[00:56.680 --> 01:00.640]  people said we're not going to turn them in was the only reason that they backed
[01:00.640 --> 01:06.080]  off but they said we can just rule make now we don't need laws they also came
[01:06.080 --> 01:13.040]  out with some new regulations saying that if you buy more than two semi-autos in
[01:13.040 --> 01:19.640]  four western states Texas to California that a gun shop has to report that it's
[01:19.640 --> 01:24.000]  suspicious to the ATF which is already reported to the next system it's
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.840]  unconstitutional but but they just wanted you to follow an order that was
[01:29.840 --> 01:35.720]  unconstitutional and unlawful because once you'll go along with things and
[01:35.720 --> 01:44.720]  accept them it sets the precedent and I remember Obama during the campaign and
[01:44.720 --> 01:49.040]  up until about a year ago in hundreds of speeches because I heard this every week
[01:49.040 --> 01:55.520]  or so a few times a week said we can't violate the Constitution we we can't
[01:55.520 --> 02:01.400]  legalize the illegals and all the rest of it without Congress well as you know
[02:01.400 --> 02:05.520]  on Friday you know they're saying it's 80,000 folks it's going to be all the
[02:05.520 --> 02:09.320]  illegals that's always been the globalist plan is to bust this country
[02:09.320 --> 02:13.200]  wide open and the illegals will then be able to vote very quickly and they will
[02:13.200 --> 02:17.240]  vote to take the guns and they will vote to take the property and they will
[02:17.240 --> 02:20.920]  vote to take everything it's a guarantee and then there'll be a civil war in
[02:20.920 --> 02:24.680]  this country which is exactly what the globalist want they've caused the civil
[02:24.680 --> 02:30.560]  war in Mexico the Ford Foundation all of them openly for 50 plus years have
[02:30.560 --> 02:36.680]  financed in Mexico that the entire US was stolen basically and the entire
[02:36.680 --> 02:42.680]  Southwest as part of Oslo I was taught that in public school and Anderson
[02:42.680 --> 02:50.360]  Hine here in Austin Texas and it is all meant to break this country up and again
[02:50.360 --> 02:54.320]  Obama launches wars without approval from Congress Obama shuts down
[02:54.320 --> 02:58.680]  power plants not owned by his buddy he gives waivers to health care laws this
[02:58.680 --> 03:06.800]  is called dictatorship fact here's Mr. Carney the White House press secretary
[03:06.800 --> 03:12.360]  like a comic book character just a few months ago saying oh he's looking
[03:12.360 --> 03:16.600]  forward to using executive orders and other things to bypass Congress here's
[03:16.600 --> 03:20.240]  the little criminal up there flaunting it in front of the bottom paid for
[03:20.240 --> 03:27.120]  prostitute whore press corps this is how America dies folks here it is here
[03:27.120 --> 03:30.720]  about this stuff so we can see your point they don't give a lick about what
[03:30.720 --> 03:33.840]  day it is what time it is why doesn't he give a speech from the whole office
[03:33.840 --> 03:38.520]  tonight saying here's my plan he wants to speak before Congress because he
[03:38.520 --> 03:43.720]  recognizes that while there are things he can do without Congress and he will do
[03:43.720 --> 03:47.920]  them there are there are there are actions that need to be taken with
[03:47.920 --> 03:51.880]  Congress that require legislation to grow the economy and create jobs and he
[03:51.880 --> 03:57.360]  wants to go to Congress speak directly to members of Congress and lay out his
[03:57.360 --> 04:03.640]  proposals the first opportunity to do that is next week so that's when he'll
[04:03.640 --> 04:10.240]  do it okay when we come back we're gonna play a compilation of clips over the
[04:10.240 --> 04:14.000]  last four years candidate Obama president Obama saying that he couldn't
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.200]  bypass Congress he's now doing that and then we're going to shift gears into
[04:21.200 --> 04:26.520]  what's happening with the designed economic meltdown over in Europe oh
[04:26.520 --> 04:31.040]  they got the banker bailout money for Greece they're getting it for Spain oh
[04:31.040 --> 04:38.000]  it's it's worse now all the mega banks need more and oh the Federal Reserve is
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.640]  signaling Goldman Sachs their boss that QE3 will begin next week we told you it
[04:43.640 --> 04:47.360]  was always coming I thought it would come by January but it's coming and that
[04:47.360 --> 04:54.240]  means inflation it is all coming up big broadcast also the feminists want you to
[04:54.240 --> 04:58.040]  urinate sitting down men and they will have you arrested if you don't comply
[04:58.040 --> 05:02.200]  with them we'll be right back this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[05:02.200 --> 05:06.080]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[05:06.080 --> 05:09.760]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[05:09.760 --> 05:13.760]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[05:13.760 --> 05:18.120]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[05:18.120 --> 05:22.560]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[05:22.560 --> 05:27.280]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.280 --> 05:31.080]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.080 --> 05:34.720]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:34.720 --> 05:39.080]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:39.080 --> 05:42.280]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[05:42.280 --> 05:45.920]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[05:45.920 --> 05:51.480]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com

[08:13.360 --> 08:26.120]  well unfortunately it's all happening just like all the old-timers said it
[08:26.120 --> 08:32.000]  would the world government run by six megabanks hellbent on cutting off the
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.440]  resources to the industrialized world cutting off the resources to the third
[08:36.440 --> 08:42.320]  world we have a giant hydra wrapped around our face basically sucking the
[08:42.320 --> 08:49.920]  lifeblood out of us like a giant stinking tick and I want out of it I want
[08:49.920 --> 08:55.520]  this corporate banking dictatorship run by a bunch of Malthusian eugenics
[08:55.520 --> 09:01.880]  loving control freaks out of my life I want the Jerry Sandusky TSA out of my
[09:01.880 --> 09:08.040]  life I want the Federal Reserve's collection agency the stinking criminal
[09:08.040 --> 09:13.680]  violating due process IRS out of my life I want government to quit lying to
[09:13.680 --> 09:18.440]  everybody and saying vaccines with a law to take when they're not I'm tired of
[09:18.440 --> 09:23.360]  this group of crooks telling us what to do over in Scotland a nine-year-old girl
[09:23.360 --> 09:28.120]  was taking photos of the horrible ugly stinking food they feed them so they
[09:28.120 --> 09:32.880]  said you're not allowed to take photos of your school lunch over in Europe they
[09:32.880 --> 09:39.320]  want to make men sit to use the bathroom I mean it just it's over here they're
[09:39.320 --> 09:43.120]  trying to ban milk popcorn and soft drinks well they have banned those in
[09:43.120 --> 09:47.320]  New York there's no end to these people they're launching with our tax money
[09:47.320 --> 09:53.160]  armed drones against us they got face scanning cameras everywhere CIA moving
[09:53.160 --> 09:57.240]  into threat fusion centers the criminal government runs al Qaeda publicly I'm
[09:57.240 --> 10:08.840]  sick of it I'm tired of it I'm done and again the reason I get so wound up as I
[10:08.840 --> 10:12.320]  read this news all last night this morning and I get in here and it's just so
[10:12.320 --> 10:17.520]  over the top I want to go over 10 things that will happen in Barack Obama
[10:17.520 --> 10:22.800]  continues to systematically legalize illegal immigrants I want to go over the
[10:22.800 --> 10:28.280]  fact that whether it's war or energy or the Second Amendment he's now saying in
[10:28.280 --> 10:33.720]  his second administration that he is going to restrict all semi-autos as the
[10:33.720 --> 10:38.720]  honorary warrant a few months ago in the Washington Times I mean that's it folks
[10:38.720 --> 10:42.440]  you look the government comes to take the guns it's over and they want the
[10:42.440 --> 10:47.840]  Civil War they'll march all these roided up idiots in up against us
[10:47.840 --> 10:52.680]  got to watch these scumbag bankers sit offshore and do this to us and the idiots
[10:52.680 --> 10:57.280]  across the board who are going to go along with it all you people that serve
[10:57.280 --> 11:00.040]  this criminal system you're going to get what you deserve but it's pointless
[11:00.040 --> 11:03.560]  because the New World Order is going to sit offshore and watch all this unfold
[11:03.560 --> 11:09.600]  is there nothing people in this scum government won't do and the looting at
[11:09.600 --> 11:16.920]  every level and I knew what the response would be whenever we discovered via our
[11:16.920 --> 11:23.080]  sources a hidden nuclear waste dump on the edge of Austin and talked about the
[11:23.080 --> 11:28.520]  secretive nuclear reactors a people denied the reactors existed while
[11:28.520 --> 11:32.760]  simultaneously saying what's the big deal they admit there's reactors and so
[11:32.760 --> 11:39.480]  what if there's a secret nuclear dump 20 years ago people would have been
[11:39.480 --> 11:43.240]  concerned now it's like okay the tune is radioactive out of Pacific feed it to
[11:43.240 --> 11:48.800]  your kids big deal and culture says it's good for you I mean there is a delusion
[11:48.800 --> 11:53.560]  now that every civilization gets before it totally collapses that is now upon
[11:53.560 --> 11:59.080]  this country and the West shelf preservations out the window everybody's
[11:59.080 --> 12:04.660]  just clicking on their iPads and iPhones and droids and I'm sick of it it's a
[12:04.660 --> 12:09.040]  nation of children just begging to be hurt by the New World Order I'm gonna
[12:09.040 --> 12:18.760]  stop raining right there I am so sick of watching the race baiters to on the so
[12:18.760 --> 12:24.440]  called left pushing all their racism pushing all their cultural division and
[12:24.440 --> 12:29.440]  then attacking anybody that points it out we're gonna get into that we're gonna
[12:29.440 --> 12:32.400]  get into what's happening in Egypt the Middle East what's happening with the
[12:32.400 --> 12:38.800]  nanny state what's unfolding on so many I mean look at this article Ottawa
[12:38.800 --> 12:44.920]  citizen I've been arrested for 15 hours in this airport Ottawa Airport wired
[12:44.920 --> 12:52.680]  with microphones to record travelers conversations hidden cameras in the
[12:52.680 --> 12:57.760]  Austrian forest caught a politician having sex I mean we live in 1984 and
[12:57.760 --> 13:02.480]  it's all meant to protect the criminals that have hijacked society it's ill
[13:02.480 --> 13:06.640]  legitimate it's like coming home and somebody's in your bed watching TV you're
[13:06.640 --> 13:16.840]  like get out of my bed they go oh I've got a badge so it's okay no it's not but
[13:16.840 --> 13:20.680]  let me just start with this first last Friday curtain Emma wrote a story saying
[13:20.680 --> 13:25.120]  it's official Obama is a dictator and I did notice over the weekend a lot of
[13:25.120 --> 13:29.400]  mainstream media did point out that Obama is taking on dictatorial powers and
[13:29.400 --> 13:33.600]  for the last three years they've done this song and dance we're at public
[13:33.600 --> 13:38.600]  speaking engagements and in TV interviews and with the press corps the
[13:38.600 --> 13:44.320]  press corps and others say Obama if the evil Republicans won't let you save the
[13:44.320 --> 13:48.720]  poor sweet illegal aliens why don't you just bypass them like a president can
[13:48.720 --> 13:54.080]  do what's a president can't do no no I'm waiting I want to work with them so
[13:54.080 --> 13:58.280]  they have this this image of people begging and begging and begging for
[13:58.280 --> 14:01.720]  him to be a dictator like Bush saying things to be a heck of a lot easier this
[14:01.720 --> 14:05.880]  was a dictatorship so long as I'm the dictator you know you can find that clip
[14:05.880 --> 14:10.960]  online Obama has now made similar claims and they do this because it's off a
[14:10.960 --> 14:15.920]  script to acclimate you to the idea so Congress has been told by the Joint
[14:15.920 --> 14:20.560]  Chiefs the Secretary of Defense and Obama in person and in letters the NATO in
[14:20.560 --> 14:26.080]  the UN command the US military earth shattering incredible off the charts
[14:26.080 --> 14:30.760]  info Obama has shut down hundreds of power plants and blocked the
[14:30.760 --> 14:36.240]  construction or the firing up of dozens and dozens of power plants section
[14:36.240 --> 14:43.120]  close to 100 massively increasing power prices outside of law Congress would not
[14:43.120 --> 14:48.240]  pass his carbon tax increasing the stock value and profits of General
[14:48.240 --> 14:51.840]  Electric who's allowed to operate and if you hire them suddenly you're allowed to
[14:51.840 --> 14:57.000]  operate if they take over your management just total mafia with General Motors
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.800]  they took hundreds and hundreds of dealerships away from people that were
[14:59.800 --> 15:04.520]  Republican donors or not Democratic donors and gave it to people you can't
[15:04.520 --> 15:08.560]  sell Chevy's anymore you can go get some other dealership if you want but we've
[15:08.560 --> 15:13.760]  had this for 80 years doesn't matter I mean just total criminal mafia scum
[15:13.760 --> 15:18.120]  that's caught shipping guns and hand grenades to street gangs of the US
[15:18.120 --> 15:22.760]  Honduras and Mexico tens of thousands what is it 60 something thousand dead
[15:22.760 --> 15:31.080]  now in the last four years the total bedlam and they're caught lying caught
[15:31.080 --> 15:34.240]  running at all and they don't get in trouble and they say in the new
[15:34.240 --> 15:39.680]  administration they're going to come and ban the semi-autos period in our a
[15:39.680 --> 15:45.000]  who's usually milk toast has the Intel Washington Times three months ago people
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.560]  say well you better vote for Romney you know what I hate Obama so much he makes
[15:49.560 --> 15:55.240]  me so sick I'm so sick of his criminal liars he's such a disgusting puppet that
[15:55.240 --> 16:01.520]  I want like a man in the desert who sees mirages and runs over the next hill
[16:01.520 --> 16:09.640]  thinking there's a lake I won't I run towards Mitt Romney at a childlike
[16:09.640 --> 16:15.360]  level an area of my mind wants things to get better what would be happy if
[16:15.360 --> 16:19.800]  things just reversed a few degrees but the intellectual and in my gut I
[16:19.800 --> 16:25.320]  understand that that's how this works you hate what Bush is doing you vote for
[16:25.320 --> 16:31.720]  Obama you hate what Obama is doing you vote for Mitt Romney because Mitt Romney
[16:31.720 --> 16:36.440]  is probably going to get elected and he's going to step right in and the same
[16:36.440 --> 16:40.720]  reason the same banks own him that own Obama there's like a Don King fight where
[16:40.720 --> 16:46.320]  he owns both boxers folks that you know it's going to be the same thing but
[16:46.320 --> 16:54.040]  suddenly there won't be any opposition anymore maybe the left will suddenly at
[16:54.040 --> 16:58.520]  least on paper act like they're concerned about secret arrest torture all these
[16:58.520 --> 17:05.320]  wars mercenaries drones all the rest of it but Romney has said he likes NDA he
[17:05.320 --> 17:10.080]  wants more war it's just because it's exactly what the special interests that
[17:10.080 --> 17:17.160]  hijacked this country want so it's so but you're almost inexorably drawn into
[17:17.160 --> 17:21.720]  this to support one of the two even though you know if their puppets even
[17:21.720 --> 17:29.600]  though you know it's a con game even though you know it's a fraud but we sit
[17:29.600 --> 17:34.680]  here and witness this unbelievable spectacle and by the way Rand Paul has
[17:34.680 --> 17:40.680]  come out now and said abolish the TSA basically or a bare minimum restricted
[17:40.680 --> 17:44.160]  and get warrants for drones introduce legislation look of course you need
[17:44.160 --> 17:48.360]  warrants for drones that's already on the books just enforce the law but who's
[17:48.360 --> 17:52.640]  in charge of enforcing the usurpers that have taken over our country the
[17:52.640 --> 17:59.240]  banksters so good see we're pushing Rand Paul back towards reality and I
[17:59.240 --> 18:02.520]  understand the political decision to endorse Romney because everybody's
[18:02.520 --> 18:06.360]  turning against Obama and and maybe Romney's gonna be better because you
[18:06.360 --> 18:10.240]  meet with Romney and he says oh I want to audit the Fed now oh I won't ban the
[18:10.240 --> 18:14.960]  guns now I don't like abortion now I don't like open borders now I don't like
[18:14.960 --> 18:22.360]  Obama care that I wrote now I mean yes this Mitt Romney with what he says
[18:22.360 --> 18:27.360]  today is better than Barack Obama the problem is the real Mitt Romney and the
[18:27.360 --> 18:32.040]  way he's actually voted as a governor and what he's promoted when he's in power
[18:32.040 --> 18:39.040]  is Barack Obama you know we're not gonna trade out lung cancer for bone
[18:39.040 --> 18:43.520]  cancer here and and I know this is elementary to most of you but so many
[18:43.520 --> 18:50.000]  people if I am catching my shelf hating Obama so much so disgusted with all his
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.120]  crimes openly and knowing they're thinking about doing an Oklahoma city
[18:54.120 --> 18:59.680]  with his own advisors so arrogant that there's three different advisors and all
[18:59.680 --> 19:03.360]  these newsletters they send out to their big donors saying we know we may have a
[19:03.360 --> 19:09.400]  new Oklahoma and we're gonna blame it on you know alternative media and I'm
[19:09.400 --> 19:14.680]  listed Glenn Beck's demonized in there you better believe it's gonna be drudge
[19:14.680 --> 19:20.160]  to because the system sees everybody that isn't a hundred percent in line with
[19:20.160 --> 19:25.280]  them as the enemy I mean I get wanting to cozy up just for your own protection
[19:25.280 --> 19:31.480]  to Mitt Romney because the Republicans in name at least claim there for the
[19:31.480 --> 19:35.640]  Second Amendment sovereignty and things but see in that is the great betrayal but
[19:35.640 --> 19:39.800]  when we come back I'm gonna play a video audio clip of Obama saying he doesn't
[19:39.800 --> 19:42.840]  have the power to legalize the illegals he doesn't have the power to do the
[19:42.840 --> 19:47.960]  carbon taxes without congressional authorization but now he is and then he
[19:47.960 --> 19:53.040]  says in his new administration he is going to just sign executive orders to
[19:53.040 --> 19:58.320]  take the guns everything what do we do about this what do we do I mean the

[24:33.240 --> 24:38.560]  the same thing on a video this morning that what Obama is doing is what a
[24:38.560 --> 24:42.280]  dictator does they said he's acting like a dictator well let me explain
[24:42.280 --> 24:47.560]  something when you act like a dictator you're a dictator it's not when I go rob
[24:47.560 --> 24:52.520]  a bank or you go rob a bank you're acting like a bank robber you're now a bank
[24:52.520 --> 24:58.840]  robber when they're setting up checkpoints with not even sworn officers
[24:58.840 --> 25:03.000]  violating the 4th and 10th Amendment trying to grope you on the highways now
[25:03.000 --> 25:10.000]  we're not becoming a police state we are one when Google and the NSA admit
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.520]  they're dialing into home appliances and smart meters and listening to you in
[25:14.520 --> 25:21.880]  your home and they want you to know that they're listening to you you know what
[25:21.880 --> 25:28.440]  that's called do you know what that's called that's called an out-of-control
[25:28.440 --> 25:34.120]  dangerous group of criminals that are a threat to all of us as our forebearers
[25:34.120 --> 25:38.520]  warned us and I start thinking about everything Obama's doing and again that
[25:38.520 --> 25:42.040]  that means the big bankers that just took over Europe and are installing the
[25:42.040 --> 25:46.160]  president's and prime ministers now and Time Magazine Newsweek Financial Times
[25:46.160 --> 25:50.880]  are like hey it's dictatorship but it's by bankers and they know how to run
[25:50.880 --> 25:54.520]  things best they're not like the old-fashioned dictators the economist
[25:54.520 --> 25:57.600]  actually was saying this word for word a few months ago I read it on air no
[25:57.600 --> 26:03.800]  they're just technocratic and really care and a remove from the process and oh
[26:03.800 --> 26:07.280]  yeah they're real removed they're a bunch of you Genesis that talk about how
[26:07.280 --> 26:13.480]  they want to wreck societies and of course they're doing all this they're
[26:13.480 --> 26:17.520]  just coming out in the open and I think about the illegal alien issue how
[26:17.520 --> 26:22.080]  every time I turn on television it's the poor immigrants and the poor this and
[26:22.080 --> 26:27.200]  they just want to you know they deserve rights and all this stuff meanwhile the
[26:27.200 --> 26:31.440]  borders are basically wide open meanwhile the minute the illegals get here
[26:31.440 --> 26:34.800]  they have welfare and and and they're allowed to have their kids paid for
[26:34.800 --> 26:39.800]  something I don't get as a citizen the anchor babies instantly citizens tons of
[26:39.800 --> 26:45.000]  money and then they're organized over 90 percent to vote against the Second
[26:45.000 --> 26:51.280]  Amendment against private property I mean it's over folks it's over this
[26:51.280 --> 26:57.480]  country is collapsing if we don't reverse this I mean there are six and
[26:57.480 --> 27:00.640]  plus billion people there's over seven million people in the world there are
[27:00.640 --> 27:04.600]  billions of people that want to come to this country they want to come here right
[27:04.600 --> 27:11.080]  now and it'd be one thing if we had millions a year coming here and they
[27:11.080 --> 27:16.360]  actually went out and got jobs and and did all that but no no no no we've got a
[27:16.360 --> 27:22.040]  sick culture of gangsterism so I don't care if they're Eastern Europeans or
[27:22.040 --> 27:28.120]  from Africa or from Latin America or Asia they all adopt the MTV gangster
[27:28.120 --> 27:35.440]  culture they all adopt a a thug culture and and I'm not a violent person but
[27:35.440 --> 27:39.200]  when I'm out in public and some group of people bug their eyes out at me I want
[27:39.200 --> 27:45.400]  to literally go incredible hulk on them I mean I get I am threatened by this I
[27:45.400 --> 27:49.440]  am angry and let me tell you something America is angry and buying two three

[28:10.560 --> 28:14.080]  first amendment there as well and we're gonna beat these people the globalists
[28:14.080 --> 28:17.720]  are trying to gut this country seven ways from Sunday and I'm tired of it we're
[28:17.720 --> 28:21.040]  gonna go to break long segment coming up and I do have this clip of Obama saying
[28:21.040 --> 28:27.680]  he can't legalize the illegals because it's against the law yeah the
[28:27.680 --> 28:32.960]  president doesn't make the laws but now the president doesn't just say he
[28:32.960 --> 28:37.520]  launches wars and military operations without Congress he says he takes the
[28:37.520 --> 28:42.600]  orders from NATO a bunch of narcotics trafficking criminals NATO is a private
[28:42.600 --> 28:48.160]  group and that criminal group the United Nations our country is a joke and
[28:48.160 --> 28:52.960]  we're never gonna get America back until we admit that every time I see a good
[28:52.960 --> 28:57.480]  old boy with American flags all over their vehicle I want to go over to him

[29:14.760 --> 29:18.360]  sign saying it's owned by the UN at the Grand Canyon and the guy comes out of
[29:18.360 --> 29:22.320]  nowhere there's nobody even around me and starts getting in my face because he
[29:22.320 --> 29:26.120]  hears me he thinks I'm talking bad about America saying the UN took over his
[29:26.120 --> 29:29.800]  ego doesn't want to admit we got taken over so we can get the country back he
[29:29.800 --> 29:34.040]  just wants to live in La La Land and go watch a baseball game and suck his thumb

[34:28.080 --> 34:34.600]  or wipe their spiritually snot filled snouts alright I am in a really really
[34:34.600 --> 34:38.920]  angry right now because they're just doing everything let me tell you
[34:38.920 --> 34:43.600]  something if Obama can launch wars and tell Congress to go to Hades and
[34:43.600 --> 34:48.160]  Congress sits down and takes it last year and this year and says thank you
[34:48.160 --> 34:55.840]  for the abuse that pack of criminals up there if we can sit there and as a
[34:55.840 --> 35:01.800]  country put up with the TSA abusing our wives our husbands our children while
[35:01.800 --> 35:07.040]  hiring pedophiles to be the commanders at their facilities oh yes look it up and
[35:07.040 --> 35:11.920]  not do background checks what a joke oh the security we've got to keep you safe
[35:11.920 --> 35:15.680]  but we hire criminals and don't do background checks and it turns out they
[35:15.680 --> 35:19.760]  don't just have bad background checks they hire criminals on purpose this is
[35:19.760 --> 35:25.360]  what societies when they go into the terminal rotting phase do we're like a
[35:25.360 --> 35:29.840]  dead animal that's been in a ditch for about three days now we're bloating now
[35:29.840 --> 35:34.200]  the eyeballs are popping out now the guts are coming out the other end now
[35:34.200 --> 35:37.800]  that now the maggots the stomach just popped open the maggots are spilling
[35:37.800 --> 35:42.480]  out and Homeland Security is telling us the maggots are the sign of our health
[35:42.480 --> 35:47.800]  they're telling us it's a great thing no it's not a great thing they're not
[35:47.800 --> 35:52.560]  launching 30,000 drones and buying armored pill boxes and 450 million
[35:52.560 --> 35:57.000]  rounds of 40 cal hollow point and get handing shotguns out to every agency
[35:57.000 --> 36:00.760]  there is and hardening all their facilities going back a decade ago
[36:00.760 --> 36:05.040]  because they wanted to be friendly with you they plan to gut this country the
[36:05.040 --> 36:11.080]  entire time with pure hatred this is all been preplanned everything we told
[36:11.080 --> 36:14.760]  just coming true and I'm not proud of that fact I wish we could have backed
[36:14.760 --> 36:20.200]  this off and stopped it all people are like listen to this guy get angry he's
[36:20.200 --> 36:24.400]  crazy you know what I'm what I am is disgusted and angry and desperate to try
[36:24.400 --> 36:29.680]  to get people out of their coma this country's in a coma this country is an
[36:29.680 --> 36:35.880]  annoying mind numbed days and I'm sick of it I'm sick of people in days is all
[36:35.880 --> 36:40.440]  around me I'm tired of it I took my son to the bookstore and also to the pet
[36:40.440 --> 36:46.120]  store and I was watching the workers a few of them were nice listeners but the
[36:46.120 --> 36:49.840]  others were like scared and addled and couldn't run a cash register and were
[36:49.840 --> 36:54.320]  shaking and afraid and there were women lined up behind me hen pecking me in the
[36:54.320 --> 36:57.840]  aisle and then I went over to the bookstore and the woman kept hammering
[36:57.840 --> 37:01.960]  me to get a loyalty card and I kept saying no no no no and she kept saying
[37:01.960 --> 37:05.960]  pushing it and I said listen here I know you're on a petty power trip following
[37:05.960 --> 37:11.320]  this script and everything leave me alone slave you like being a slave fine
[37:11.320 --> 37:16.160]  leave me alone I said and I told him I said don't worry the whole society's
[37:16.160 --> 37:21.280]  about to collapse now shut up I didn't quite go that far as my son was there
[37:21.280 --> 37:26.120]  but that's what I was thinking I'm sick of timid cowardly scum everywhere just
[37:26.120 --> 37:30.040]  begging to be run over by the new world order just begging to have their country
[37:30.040 --> 37:41.080]  hammered to hell oh I'm tired of it I want to reverse this and then I think
[37:41.080 --> 37:47.440]  about then I think about Obama and how much I can't stand him but he's meant
[37:47.440 --> 37:51.200]  to be hated he's meant to be the front teleprompter reader the puppet that
[37:51.200 --> 37:54.880]  gets all the blame like a shield and when they're done with him they throw him
[37:54.880 --> 37:59.700]  down when he's all been up and pick up Mitt Romney and I and if even I want
[37:59.700 --> 38:05.320]  Mitt Romney in my gut my gut knows he's a fraud but in my gut at an animal level
[38:05.320 --> 38:11.680]  I was sick of Bush and wanted something new Obama I didn't vote for Obama I said
[38:11.680 --> 38:16.800]  he'd be a fraud late it all out but I still had this mindless pathetic
[38:16.800 --> 38:22.680]  childlike idiotic hope that a bought and paid for person will be different and
[38:22.680 --> 38:26.920]  it's the same thing with Mitt Romney because you see Obama just slaughtering
[38:26.920 --> 38:30.640]  the country it's Bill of Rights it's Constitution everything right now and
[38:30.640 --> 38:35.240]  you say oh I want Mitt Romney and it's in that fraud that keeps us perpetually
[38:35.240 --> 38:41.520]  being con-gamed and knowing everything I know they dangle that way out oh Mitt
[38:41.520 --> 38:45.640]  Romney says he won't do this when he's all about betrayal and then you say well
[38:45.640 --> 38:49.640]  what do we do well that when we open the phones up that's a question I have for
[38:49.640 --> 38:54.680]  you eight hundred two five nine nine two three one eight hundred two five nine
[38:54.680 --> 39:03.800]  nine two three one and again ladies and gentlemen we've got to get angry we've
[39:03.800 --> 39:09.160]  got to get involved me look at this Paul Joseph Watson article
[39:09.160 --> 39:15.160]  Apple's iOS 6 includes government alerts how many years ago did I tell you that
[39:15.160 --> 39:19.040]  all the computers smartphones digital clock radios will have government
[39:19.040 --> 39:22.800]  takeover switches that listen to you and watch you because it was in all the
[39:22.800 --> 39:27.680]  government documents it was in the telecommunications acts that they had
[39:27.680 --> 39:32.880]  to do it not under law but regulations and that you'd have government alerts
[39:32.880 --> 39:37.320]  it's already started in New York New Jersey Obama pops on with audio and
[39:37.320 --> 39:42.120]  text and there's putting jumbo trons in everywhere with Homeland Security on it
[39:42.120 --> 39:48.080]  right out of every nightmare science fiction dystopian novel they're
[39:48.080 --> 39:53.040]  launching Skynet against us and I love my children you know I'm angry there's
[39:53.040 --> 39:56.760]  not one reason I'm so enraged is I've got to be here risking my life up front
[39:56.760 --> 40:01.040]  fighting these tyrants and then people tell me oh thanks for the great job you're
[40:01.040 --> 40:05.440]  doing I'm doing nothing but self-preservation don't you understand
[40:05.440 --> 40:12.640]  you don't have a future if you don't take action what do you do you go out to
[40:12.640 --> 40:17.680]  spray paint the website you think's the most informative everywhere I don't know
[40:17.680 --> 40:20.640]  desperate times be desperate measures I don't think that's a desperate measure
[40:20.640 --> 40:24.720]  it's info or it's what the committee's the correspondence did the Sun's a
[40:24.720 --> 40:29.080]  liberty for a decade before the Red Codes came and confiscated the guns and the
[40:29.080 --> 40:32.360]  war started and by the way that's when the war is gonna start here and the
[40:32.360 --> 40:37.040]  globalists are gonna do it on purpose but we don't have a choice at that point
[40:37.040 --> 40:41.840]  they want to show you who's boss they want to roll this country so bad it
[40:41.840 --> 40:48.080]  makes their head spin look at that article here's another one by Kurt
[40:48.080 --> 40:54.440]  Nemo in his own words Obama says he is a constitution violating dictator holy
[40:54.440 --> 41:00.400]  mackerel ladies and gentlemen I don't just say they put cancer viruses in your
[41:00.400 --> 41:06.280]  vaccine you think I'm happy every time we find more documents where they're
[41:06.280 --> 41:11.280]  putting in the vaccine and how they admit they're killing us no it's horrible I
[41:11.280 --> 41:15.720]  wish it wasn't true you think I like the fact they're putting fluoride in the
[41:15.720 --> 41:20.400]  water and I get to expose them it's horrible you know I'm bad it freaks
[41:20.400 --> 41:23.800]  everybody out around here when we go to a store and everywhere's fluoride this
[41:23.800 --> 41:28.560]  for kids fluoride water that fluoride candies knowing it brain damages these
[41:28.560 --> 41:36.560]  little children folks people go well how did the Germans let Nazi Germany happen
[41:36.560 --> 41:42.080]  how did the Russians let it happen because the tyrants do it by increment we
[41:42.080 --> 41:48.240]  are lobsters that have been put in hot water and I'm in the water going and my
[41:48.240 --> 41:51.680]  listeners and my crew are like man this is hot trying to keep our feet off the
[41:51.680 --> 41:55.360]  bottom let's get out of here and we're trying to climb out but if you ever
[41:55.360 --> 41:58.640]  seen if you ever seen a bunch of lobsters or crawdads thrown live in the
[41:58.640 --> 42:04.600]  water or crabs when one starts trying that's how you do it you put them in the
[42:04.600 --> 42:08.000]  cold water turn it on and as things start to happen they start moving their
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.640]  feet and one will go over to try to climb out so to use each other to get out
[42:11.640 --> 42:16.280]  they'll others will walk over and grab them when they try to leave and you ain't
[42:16.280 --> 42:21.440]  going nowhere and that's exactly what all these neocons and liberals and the
[42:21.440 --> 42:25.240]  rest of them are doing I'm saying man let's get out of here this is starting
[42:25.240 --> 42:30.520]  to boil and they're like you ain't going nowhere just grabbing me by the leg and
[42:30.520 --> 42:35.000]  I'm like stop at you idiot the crab looks at me up out of the water with a
[42:35.000 --> 42:41.560]  bubble starting to form and says we're all gonna roast because people love the
[42:41.560 --> 42:47.000]  status quo well the status quo is just headlong off a cliff headlong off a
[42:47.000 --> 42:54.640]  cliff right into pure evil right into a big bucket of snakes big old that of
[42:54.640 --> 43:07.600]  cobras worse than a big giant vat of cobras a lot of times cobras might be in
[43:07.600 --> 43:12.200]  the mood to bite you like a big old bucket of sulfuric acid more like it
[43:12.200 --> 43:16.400]  it's always in the mood to eat your flesh right off the bones I mean
[43:16.400 --> 43:19.520]  governments killed according to the University of Hawaii there's other
[43:19.520 --> 43:25.400]  studies that even hire non-military deaths must say it again non-military
[43:25.400 --> 43:35.920]  deaths non-military deaths to hundred and sixty two million people exterminated
[43:35.920 --> 43:44.840]  by authoritarian governments in the 20th century to hundred and sixty two
[43:44.840 --> 43:53.480]  million and I read ADL Southern Poverty Law Center 60 minutes in SNBC
[43:53.480 --> 43:57.960]  Nightline all of them have attacked yours truly saying I'm an extremist
[43:57.960 --> 44:02.120]  because I am concerned about the government and say we better keep them
[44:02.120 --> 44:05.720]  under control well I'm in good company ladies and gentlemen with George
[44:05.720 --> 44:08.560]  Washington Thomas Jefferson Benjamin Franklin
[44:08.560 --> 44:16.280]  Frederick Douglas after him the list goes on and on you have to be in a coma to
[44:16.280 --> 44:40.000]  not know we are made a made a made a emergency situation red alert let's go
[44:40.000 --> 44:45.920]  ahead I said I'd go to this clip here is Obama oh it's only 80,000 illegals it's
[44:45.920 --> 44:49.720]  illegal for him to do this oh it's children though oh the ATF is just
[44:49.720 --> 44:53.120]  going to ban some shotguns if you can bottom-load clips into them you know
[44:53.120 --> 44:55.960]  they said that last year but had to back off they said well now that we're
[44:55.960 --> 44:59.960]  allowed to do rulemaking outside of Congress because Obama says so the guy
[44:59.960 --> 45:03.320]  that ships guns in the Mexico to blame the Second Amendment we're going to have
[45:03.320 --> 45:09.200]  some new laws they're not laws but we just say so all bottom-loading shotguns
[45:09.200 --> 45:14.040]  will be banned and the NRA again a few months ago in a Washington Times article
[45:14.040 --> 45:18.960]  normally very milk toast very conservative said yes he does plan to ban
[45:18.960 --> 45:24.240]  all semi-autos in the next administration let me just give the police
[45:24.240 --> 45:28.640]  and military newsflash you can arrest a few old men or whatever who don't know
[45:28.640 --> 45:31.760]  you're coming for them and and make an example out of them when they don't turn
[45:31.760 --> 45:35.480]  their guns in all that's gonna make everybody dig in and get ready it is a
[45:35.480 --> 45:41.240]  death sentence once this starts for anyone that tries to go get the guns and
[45:41.240 --> 45:45.880]  the globalist know that when they give you the order so just remember that and
[45:45.880 --> 45:51.040]  I don't get any thrill or we're gonna have our revolution thinking about
[45:51.040 --> 45:55.640]  cannon fodder that Henry Kissinger calls dumb animals having a war with you I
[45:55.640 --> 45:59.480]  don't think you're a dumb animal I think military and police are smart
[45:59.480 --> 46:02.600]  enough to understand what's happening here and realize that we've got
[46:02.600 --> 46:07.600]  criminals running everything and that you better start saying no in the
[46:07.600 --> 46:13.480]  military and the police and everywhere else our country has been hijacked we've
[46:13.480 --> 46:18.520]  been taken over we've been usurped collaborators are in control you know
[46:18.520 --> 46:23.360]  people think the Hitler beat the French in two weeks the Maginot line failed it
[46:23.360 --> 46:29.720]  all failed in the Blitzkrieg not because the German military was even that
[46:29.720 --> 46:32.080]  formidable notice what happened they finally tried to fight in the Russians
[46:32.080 --> 46:37.160]  Russians just said come on in 500 miles and see what happens it was that the
[46:37.160 --> 46:42.040]  Vici French over 80% of the French general staff just like the Iraqi stood
[46:42.040 --> 46:48.680]  down in 2003 they'd already been paid off they were given the country that's
[46:48.680 --> 46:53.800]  why Hitler could turret two weeks into the war go to Paris and the French were
[46:53.800 --> 46:59.240]  lined up to seem and we're told you don't line up you get in trouble just like
[46:59.240 --> 47:05.040]  North Korea that's what we got we've got Vici government they've already signed
[47:05.040 --> 47:10.160]  us over folks they sold us out that's why Congress can have the generals in
[47:10.160 --> 47:13.680]  there with their eyes all crazed gleaming at Congress just 10 years ago the
[47:13.680 --> 47:17.640]  generals were respectful they walk into Congress now and they know they go hey
[47:17.640 --> 47:25.520]  we got all the dirt on you you sit down you shut up is that understood punks now
[47:25.520 --> 47:29.880]  here's Obama this video is up at info wars.com a curtain emos article in his
[47:29.880 --> 47:36.120]  own words Obama says he is a constitution violating dictator here is
[47:36.120 --> 47:39.760]  Obama saying he couldn't do what he's now doing with the military with
[47:39.760 --> 47:44.520]  illegals with guns with everything we have a rogue president but but the
[47:44.520 --> 47:48.760]  bankers have given him this power just getting rid of him won't fix it here it
[47:48.760 --> 47:55.360]  is yeah we've got a government designed by the founders so that there'd be checks
[47:55.360 --> 48:00.080]  and balances you don't want a president who's too powerful but this is part of
[48:00.080 --> 48:04.000]  the whole theory of George Bush that he can make laws as he's going along that's
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.240]  always leave me the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting this
[48:08.240 --> 48:18.920]  2011 we can't wait for Congress to do its job so where they won't act I will so
[48:18.920 --> 48:22.720]  from all age 11 total change administration we're gonna look every
[48:22.720 --> 48:31.040]  single day to figure out what we can do without Congress what can we do without
[48:33.520 --> 48:39.400]  and that's from the words matter 2012 words matter 2012.com does some good
[48:39.400 --> 48:42.440]  work over there and there's a lot of other compilations of that let's play
[48:42.440 --> 48:48.680]  that whole thing one more time for people here he is in 08 saying Bush was
[48:48.680 --> 48:51.680]  doing this and by the way nothing compared to this actually he went to
[48:51.680 --> 48:54.480]  Congress for war and all the rest of it didn't mean the war was legal or
[48:54.480 --> 48:59.440]  lawful doing whatever he wants Bush is wrong and then later saying well I need
[48:59.440 --> 49:03.640]  Congress to act but I can't and saying hey we'll just do whatever we want and
[49:03.640 --> 49:11.360]  ladies and gentlemen he's shutting down power plants he's going after guns he's
[49:11.360 --> 49:15.160]  getting rid of our border he's launching wars he's signing us on to UN
[49:15.160 --> 49:21.360]  treaties Obama came out Friday and said he may sign an executive order and say
[49:21.360 --> 49:25.920]  it ratifies the small arms treaty of unidire that calls for the complete
[49:25.920 --> 49:31.000]  abolition of civilian ownership of firearms the treaty was first began to
[49:31.000 --> 49:38.920]  be ratified in July of 2000 12 years later 12 years later Obama says he'll
[49:38.920 --> 49:43.560]  just sign it and then try to march the ATF up against us let's go back to that
[49:43.560 --> 49:48.680]  clip here it is yeah we've got a government designed by the founders so
[49:48.680 --> 49:52.840]  that there'd be checks and balances you don't want a president who's too
[49:52.840 --> 49:57.600]  powerful but this is part of the whole theory of George Bush that he can make
[49:57.600 --> 50:02.520]  laws as he's going along believe me the idea of doing things on my own is very
[50:02.520 --> 50:12.560]  tempting we can't wait for Congress to do its job so where they won't act I
[50:12.560 --> 50:18.800]  will and I've told my administration we're gonna look every single day to
[50:18.800 --> 50:25.840]  figure out what we can do without Congress what can we do without all right
[50:25.840 --> 50:30.080]  and there's a lot more of those we're gonna go to break and come back and get
[50:30.080 --> 50:33.240]  to some calls and then later in the next hour I'll get into the geopolitical
[50:33.240 --> 50:37.240]  news the Kiwi three news is off the charts that means hyperinflation
[50:37.240 --> 50:40.960]  incredible nanny state the feminists want you to sit while urinating of
[50:40.960 --> 50:44.720]  you're a man banning children photographing their filthy school
[50:44.720 --> 50:51.200]  lunches a total bizarre police state activity secret military mini shuttle
[50:51.200 --> 50:55.280]  landing off California microphones hidden in airports we'll be right back

[54:59.440 --> 55:03.160]  being totally overriding
[55:04.360 --> 55:09.320]  because the average person is in a television fantasy land you go sit in a
[55:09.320 --> 55:15.040]  restaurant all you hear adults talking about is their favorite TV show and
[55:15.040 --> 55:18.280]  again I don't say that in a judgmental way like I'm into politics I'm smarter

[55:22.400 --> 55:30.000]  monkeys stop acting like slaves or you will be them I can't imagine what the

[56:08.800 --> 56:12.040]  yeah I think it's something happens an accident or something that happened you
[56:12.040 --> 56:18.120]  know made by nature I actually bought that magazine a few months ago and I
[56:18.120 --> 56:21.840]  meant to do a shoot with it where I showed governments killing hundreds of
[56:21.840 --> 56:27.520]  millions government is the biggest disaster yes it is but Oklahoma 911
[56:27.520 --> 56:30.960]  not in here when they if they're successful in this coup and we try to
[56:30.960 --> 56:34.440]  tell the kids later on that how they got away with everything and we
[56:34.440 --> 56:37.920]  explained 911 in Oklahoma to them they're gonna oh man that didn't happen
[56:37.920 --> 56:43.640]  time life wouldn't lie to us oh yeah but I mean if we don't win they'll say you
[56:43.640 --> 56:48.120]  could never buy vitamin C at the store women never breastfed people never live
[56:48.120 --> 56:53.840]  past 30 that's a conspiracy theory it's not a conspiracy theory the way I say
[56:53.840 --> 56:58.240]  it God bless you for all you've done sir please don't thank me I want to thank
[56:58.240 --> 57:04.040]  you take care hey what do you think of Obama becoming a dictator I wish Ron Paul
[57:04.040 --> 57:10.760]  hadn't pulled what he pulled because I was at the Chico State Ron Paul rally
[57:10.760 --> 57:17.600]  yeah I stood behind the media platform and the whole time Channel 7 news had
[57:17.600 --> 57:21.440]  their camera pointed away from Ron Paul until I mentioned to a bunch of people
[57:21.440 --> 57:24.360]  in the crowd look how much news we're gonna get about Mr. Ron Paul they ain't
[57:24.360 --> 57:29.880]  even pointing the camera at him and I got a dirty look from the film crew well
[57:29.880 --> 57:34.280]  that's because the average coward in media only does what they're told and so
[57:34.280 --> 57:38.760]  they revel in being part of the system they think they're on the winning team
[57:38.760 --> 57:43.440]  because they distort things the average reporter out there so I talked to a lot
[57:43.440 --> 57:47.680]  of them they get off on deceiving people they like the fact that the public's
[57:47.680 --> 57:53.160]  dumb it makes it very easy for them and that's their little secret power is that
[57:53.160 --> 57:57.400]  is that they're there shaping and crafting and manipulating instead of
[57:57.400 --> 58:01.280]  wanting to unlock minds unleash human potential instead of wanting people to
[58:01.280 --> 58:05.760]  see the truth have the electricity of discovery in their eyes they love the
[58:05.760 --> 58:11.400]  dull ignorant the cow like state the predators love that because they can
[58:11.400 --> 58:14.560]  feed on everybody well you know what I don't want my children going up with a
[58:14.560 --> 58:19.200]  bunch of cattle a bunch of drooling idiots I want to lift everybody up I
[58:19.200 --> 58:26.000]  want humans to be electric and powerful and real and explosive and dynamic not
[58:26.000 --> 58:30.680]  a bunch of nanny-state men sitting on the toilet to urinate women ruling over

[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:13.480]  the State Department and not your average Marine but these Marines because
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.360]  they're part of the house slave Marines they get to be around the world leaders
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:22.280]  so they'd shake their head at us they would come out and say they wanted to
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:27.360]  shake my hand and then try to crush my hand and really acted like mentally

[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:07.760]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.920]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.960]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:19.840]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:24.080]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:28.240]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.560]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:36.320]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.480]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.960]  even though a few years ago he said that was illegal on videotape we're gonna be
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:07.240]  playing again all of this is happening and yep we told folks about this a long
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:13.640]  time ago Apple iOS 6 and so all the new smart phones stuff coming out mandates
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:20.040]  of government alerts text alerts video alerts Obama your gracious leader so it's
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.640]  not just at Walmart now the telescreens with big sis sing trust no one but
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:27.840]  government and now the president will be breaking in and it says it will cut off
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.000]  your phone calls or whatever you were doing because government is going to
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.800]  force its way in front of you presidential alerts to be mandatory for
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:42.360]  all cell phone users Apple eagerly awaited the iOS 6 update for iPhones and
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:46.520]  iPads will include controversial government alerts that some fear are
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:50.120]  part of the federal government's takeover of communications networks some
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:56.920]  fear I mean they admit that's the plan I would just add Watson that we have worn
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.480]  this part of a takeover communication networks with a bunch of links to where
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:05.520]  we've said that ten years ago in a year ago I mean in compliance with the
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:11.680]  national alert program the WEA will be coming to Apple devices that will run
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:16.760]  on the new OS once it arrives this fall the iOS 6 compatible devices include
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:25.000]  iPhone 3g s iPhone 4 iPhone 4 s iPod touch 4g iPad 2 and the new iPad this
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.160]  means the users with older iPhones will be able to receive WEA messages once
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:35.080]  they upgrade their handset to the new mobile phone software the federal
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.120]  government is keen to implement a centralized system of control over all
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:44.240]  communications with last year's announcement that all cell phones will
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:50.040]  be required to comply with the plan program personal localized alerting
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:54.520]  network yeah the local threat fusion center to will pop up in California they
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:59.440]  want to have the license plates be a TV screen that will pop up you know when

[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:26.040]  your child will be with the dungeon keepers although users can opt out of
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:30.680]  receiving the alerts from FEMA and the amber alert program messages directly
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:34.680]  from the president oh the guy that ships guns into Mexico and legalizes
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:44.520]  illegals will be mandatory mandatory messages from der führer consumers
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:48.120]  will have the option to block all plan alerts except for those issued by the
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:53.600]  president the LA Times reported the thought of cell phone users being
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:58.200]  forcibly targeted with text messages from Barack Obama during the election
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:02.880]  season will obviously stoke concerns that the emergency alert system could be
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:08.280]  exploited I'm gonna have it goes on and on I'm going to have Aaron or Curt
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:13.200]  Nemo here in the office add my video from like what the last one it was like a
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:18.920]  year ago president to seize control of communications I searched that what was
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:27.720]  the name of my video here I'll do it watch this let me see this FEMA FEMA
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:37.600]  FEMA to take over communications and I have links to all the documents but of
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.440]  course here it is yep FEMA communication takeover test scheduled
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:53.200]  FEMA communication takeover test there's my videos that was from last October
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:03.600]  and there's a video that goes along with it that is so very important where I
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.840]  break that down people need to understand the full import of what this means
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:12.160]  we'll be getting more into that after I go to some phone calls let's let's go
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:18.640]  to your phone calls I'm gonna go to Carl and then we're gonna go to Mark Willie
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:24.320]  Doug Oz and others let's talk to Carl and Georgia you're on the air welcome
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:34.320]  to ask me that everybody first off I am a no longer an active duty disabled
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:37.320]  Marine Corps gunnery sergeant you asked the question earlier about what can we do
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:43.080]  the fat idiot in DC decides to declare martial law between now and November we
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:49.080]  go to war if he gets reelected we go to war and he can have his little 100,000
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:56.600]  Russians and 100,000 Chinese there are millions of us vets who refuse to roll
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:04.680]  over for that individual and his gang of criminals okay now as bad as Obama is and
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:08.640]  I agree with you he's the worst president ever what about Mitt Romney if they put
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:13.160]  Mitt Romney in they submit all their globalist gains he just pays lip service
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:17.320]  to libertarians and conservatives and keeps moving ahead with the agenda but
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:21.520]  I get the point of am I as well still just get rid of Obama because the change
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:27.640]  up in management might slow him down well he's walking a thin line right now by
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:34.320]  declaring himself a constitutional dictator and as far as Romney he's just
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:40.200]  Obama light first time he steps out of line he will need to be removed just like
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:46.320]  that idiot we got in DC now what do you make because I mean I understand your
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:50.160]  fine line point I think they went over it I mean it's saying the UN and NATO
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:54.360]  runs the military shutting down power plants ATF saying they can make rules
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:59.080]  without law and now seeing the illegal aliens he's gonna legalize them when he
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:04.880]  said a year ago he couldn't do it under the law I mean this is treason and when
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:10.080]  they had the members of the joint chief of staff sitting behind Panetta when he
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:14.320]  said he declared his treasonous activities along with the presidents in
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:19.920]  front of the Senate they should have immediately been arrested well that's
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:24.200]  what the law says but the law says you can't have drones with weapons above us
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:28.640]  well the law says you can't have the CIA operating domestically the law says you
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.600]  can't have foreign banks and the Chinese government owning our fake debt that they
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:37.160]  induced us and signed us on to you know all day they tell you we owe 15 trillion
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:42.480]  folks we've signed on to 600 plus trillion of the 1.5 quadrillion of the
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:47.720]  bank or debt 15 trillion is nothing we're not even in debt everything is
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:52.200]  about how we're in debt and how we're bad and how we don't work enough you got
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:55.920]  two Americas you got people working their hind ends off and you got a lazy
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.640]  people but still we're not in debt as a nation because of the lazy people that
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:05.800]  are just there to be voters for the big government I mean it's so incredible
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:10.320]  this is not our debt God bless you sir good to hear from you yeah that's the
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.440]  thing the American people are buying guns they're digging in they're getting
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:21.760]  ready for war but we need to also be out there in the info war with signs on the
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.760]  street corners putting up bumper stickers calling in to talk radio calling
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:31.800]  Congress making as big a noise as we can to avert this physical situation
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:35.200]  because the globalists want to solve to kill each other I'm telling you that's
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:39.880]  the plan ladies and gentlemen let's go to Willie and Nevada Willie you're on the
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:46.680]  air Wiley hey buddy sorry Wiley go ahead no problem I've been thinking about this
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.720]  for I mean there's a very simple solution that the problem is is that most
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:53.800]  Americans have no more faith in Congress because they're not doing what
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:57.160]  they're supposed to be doing which is representing us I mean why can't we put
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:01.880]  in a system so that when people would actually set up a voter registration
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:06.920]  that I go online put it in and the representatives who just have to vote
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.800]  for what the majority says I mean the problem is we're giving them choice to
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:16.040]  not do what we asked I mean well Congress has a 9% approval rating the
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.600]  government's trying to legalize all the illegals because they're told hey vote
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:25.840]  to ban the guns you'll get more welfare checks so the people if the people
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:29.360]  stand up and finally say enough is enough you're gonna start listening to us
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.760]  you're gonna start doing what you're supposed to be doing and do what we
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.060]  are telling you to do listen we've been telling them to follow the
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:38.520]  Constitution Bill of Rights all those constitutional positions are very
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:43.400]  popular people demanded them the government instead is building armored
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:48.800]  bases giant tanks drones and weapons they've heard that we don't like them
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:54.040]  they know we hate them and their answer is militarize against us do you understand
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.400]  that oh no I totally understand that ours but my thing is if enough people get
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:02.560]  together to make something else possible but the problem is is everybody's
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:07.840]  there's nobody that is deciding on what to do they're all have no more faith so
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:11.080]  they're trying to do nothing all right listen I appreciate your call sir we're
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:16.600]  all busting our hind ends I mean we tried to use Ron Paul as a vehicle to at
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:19.880]  least educate people about the Federal Reserve the New World Order we had a
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:24.080]  lot of success there then we got horrified to see them saying we'll just
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:28.240]  join with the Republican Party but I understand why they did that it's a
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:38.200]  process but as a people we have to recognize just how illegitimate and
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:44.280]  morally bankrupt the federal government is it it's that realization we can say
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.800]  well nobody's getting together because through the mass media through the
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:52.600]  globalist operations they've divided everybody let's go another call here
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:58.520]  mark in Oregon you're on the air hello Alex got one minute sir go ahead well
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:02.560]  Alex as you yourself have said there's only one sober bullet in this situation
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:07.480]  and that is a national repentance and that means out in public I believe you've
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:11.160]  even gone so far as to say we should go out in public along the lines of none of
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:16.000]  it to do this you're the old Alex you're the only one who can actually organize

[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:14.480]  this broadcast is certainly the t-rex of real talk unscripted real analysis and
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:19.040]  a lot of days just pure anger yeah you heard me tell him the last caller when
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:23.680]  he brings up how we need to repent as a society then I go into a rant about I
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:28.280]  can't do anymore I understand the position we've got I understand the fact
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.200]  that we've got a platform that's one of the biggest out there to reach the
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:40.120]  population that's alternative I mean what is there Glenn Beck Matt drudge
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:44.560]  alex jones that's about it and Glenn Beck always makes jokes about
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:50.840]  Bilderberg and key stuff you know he's cynical like a barracuda not trying to
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:55.640]  bash the guy he does some good Matt drudge is great there's info wars.com
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:00.680]  and info wars.com is the only hardcore thing out there that can actually
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:06.160]  reach some people but just reaching people I'm trying to grow to the next
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:11.560]  level but I'm always so busy doing the radio show the nightly news dealing
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:17.840]  with everything else that I've bitten off more than I can chew I mean you even
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:24.160]  take Glenn Beck TV they probably only do TV a few times a week we do it five
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.960]  nights a week and then I do the Sunday radio show most weeks that's live and I
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:33.560]  do all and I'm not complaining I want to do more but I've got to spend time
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:38.120]  trying to manage people and tell them what I want and and and you know basic
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:42.880]  equipment upgrades and I've got 600 plus videos everybody's like well when is

[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:51.160]  $10,000 in prizes it's going to get judged this week because there's not
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:54.920]  going to be a nightly news we're going to be on hiatus again which I don't want
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:26:00.960]  to do very often because I've got to stop to do everything else so I can sit
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:05.040]  here and say this one goes here that one goes there so I can sit there and
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:11.160]  actually judge it and so and I'm not complaining there's planet info wars
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:17.360]  dot com it's got a lot of members we're working the bugs out on that social
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.000]  network hope you go there meet people whether it's for camping shooting getting
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.320]  politically organized dating planet info wars dot com I am trying on every
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:32.600]  front to do more we went up to Bilderberg he had a big effect it was in
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:38.120]  hundreds of newspapers worldwide a bunch here domestically reached a bunch of
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:46.640]  people but again I can't do everything I'll guarantee if our listeners and I'm
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.320]  not even saying do this or if you did it do on the side of your barn and legal
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:54.120]  awful areas or go out and find a business that's you knocked on 20 business
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:58.720]  doors you'd find one that was a listener spray paint info wars dot com
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:04.000]  giant all over the side of a business that authorizes it God forbid you go big
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.160]  gun you know pylons under highways and spray paint it there I'd forbid up on
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:15.760]  mopac central mopac where you go over that hill before skyway and all that
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.600]  there's those big highway dividers they've got sitting there God forbid
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.400]  somebody spray paint info wars dot com giant right there you know what happened
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:28.960]  of people listeners in every city today spray painted info wars dot com and
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:34.360]  legal awful areas and then call the news media about it there'd be hundreds of
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.360]  news events and right there would just be an example why did I do the Obama
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:45.160]  Joker poster contest they ended up being in hundreds of newspapers hundreds and
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:50.520]  I don't know 40 50 TV stations and because the media would always come out
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:54.640]  and say arrest whoever is hanging up little Joker posters and I said hang
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:58.600]  them up and legal awful areas and then that would backfire and more people would
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:03.880]  put more of them up we're going to do that again in fact in fact I'm
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:12.000]  announcing the initiative we're gonna have a ten thousand dollar prize I I
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:19.160]  wanted to finish the next contest but I will start tomorrow you'll start seeing
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:26.040]  out of 600 or so the top 50 finalist because I want to see what your comments
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:29.680]  are and some things and the next few weeks we will get that announced I'll
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:35.160]  set a deadline I will announce the winner next Thursday next Thursday we
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:38.360]  will announce the male and female winner of that okay so there I've put
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.080]  myself in the position I mean I've got to not do the nightly news to do this I've
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:46.880]  taken on more than I can do which is a good thing I've decided to pull the
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:53.280]  trigger on trying to launch that newspaper by September I'm gonna try
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:57.760]  everything here the nightly news just takes up like three four hours a day
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:01.800]  it's killing me that's why I have Aaron doing a great job McBreen sometimes but
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:04.480]  I'm trying to do all these other videos I'm not complaining I'm just doing
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.360]  everything I can I'm doing everything I can to get this country out of a coma
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:11.640]  and people are in comas they just walk around like jellyfish all day I can tell
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:16.040]  somebody that watches TV all day versus somebody that doesn't people just don't
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:20.640]  take things serious because they sit there watching stuff all day and so they
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:24.600]  think of everything as something you watch not something you do so yes I am
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:31.240]  recommitting to do everything I can and we will we will buy sometime next week
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:34.680]  launch a contest you only have two weeks with it because I don't want to we
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:39.280]  don't have time anymore $10,000 on whoever hangs up and video tapes the
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.920]  most Obama is a Nazi piece of trash dictator signs communist whatever you

[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:05.240]  know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:08.600]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:12.440]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:15.600]  seeds have outperformed even golden silver before in this country and it's
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:19.520]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:23.640]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a

[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:14.120]  leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order it's alex jones on
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:21.480]  the GCN radio network well you know the big story is that obama whether it's
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:26.960]  our military under NATO UN command congress told they don't have a say
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:33.840]  anymore and congress going along with that or whether it's bill marr saying
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:37.320]  that if you post a photo of a black person on your website when they're in
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:43.400]  the news you're a racist I'm not kidding that's coming up that's like when they
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:46.640]  said if you're against socialist health care you don't you're a racist I mean it
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:54.160]  just just a pure weapon that's used big blow-ups in Egypt Syria with Russia you
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:59.240]  name it Russia has confirmed their sending warships and troops the west
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:04.520]  is sending an al-qaeda again I'm not a fan of the Russians but al-qaeda I mean
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:09.160]  our country is run by the bad guys I mean they're so bad they make the Russians
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:12.960]  look good that's the point we've gotten to are the Russians shipping guns into
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:16.720]  Mexico are the Russians trying to bankrupt our country are the Russians
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:20.480]  putting drones in the sky are the Russians putting in smart meters that
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:27.680]  control our houses and banning popcorn in New York no they were doing one tent
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:31.560]  of it I would absolutely hate them they're not now they're threatening to
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:35.440]  nuke Western Europe if the West continues to roll weapons in let's say
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:39.760]  these bankers will end up just like Hitler going too far ladies and gentlemen
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:43.320]  I keep going back to the Hitler analogy because it's a great example of somebody
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.120]  getting out of control I'm gonna try to rampage through your calls here in a
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:50.840]  moment another issue people asked me how to get prepared we should get
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:55.080]  prepared because if we get prepared enough the globalist may actually back
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:00.040]  off plus if society continues to go in the direction it is we all need to be

[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:38.160]  Alex how are you oh man I am just just absolutely freaked out and upset it's
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:41.560]  all coming true government takeovers of communications with government
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:47.280]  announcements jumbo screens tattletale squad CIA checkpoints was that rhetorical
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:52.160]  asking me how I'm doing just Obama announcing he's got dictator powers the
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:57.840]  Republicans are saying hardly anything I mean what do you say well I think you
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:01.720]  mentioned earlier you were hoping the people would call in with some concern
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:08.320]  about Obama and absolutely I'm concerned about everything he's doing and as odd as
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:13.520]  it sounds something that could even concern me even more is the fact that
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:18.960]  you know people in general just don't seem to care or think that it's an issue
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:28.880]  whatsoever they are in a coma you know pop culture trendy coma what do you do
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:33.840]  about that well I'll tell you what and to follow up with something else that you
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:38.200]  did say here a little while ago you guys you and your team are without a doubt
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:44.600]  obviously busting your arms and I think thousands of us individuals you know out
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:48.600]  on the street locally are doing what we can I've got a little YouTube channel I've
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:54.960]  got your all of your different stickers going up on street full signs here and
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:38:00.280]  there around my town and I know like I said thousands of others are doing what
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:05.920]  they can forward progress is being made I do truly believe that I just hope it's
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:11.200]  enough you know when the day comes hope for the best plan for the worst well
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:22.240]  look it's time for banner hangs it's time I'm going to develop a basic poster
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:30.160]  design in fact everybody starts sending it to show tips and info wars calm or
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:38.200]  create a new group at planet info wars calm where everybody can send in their
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:44.000]  poster idea that exposes Obama as a dictator and as the government as a
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  criminal enterprises a whole and I think it should probably even though it's
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.880]  been overused it will get through to everybody I think it will be Obama with
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:58.560]  a mustache I mean I think that's it in fact no I mean people can send in their
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:04.480]  suggestions maybe text wise but I think it's going to be Obama's face with a
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:12.680]  mustache saying traitor scum or or or dictator scum that's it hey guys Tim will
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:18.480]  you come in here real quick please brother come on in here I want to have
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:22.080]  we're about to hire another graphics person as well because our two are so
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:26.480]  overworked I need oh you know the classic Obama photograph where it's kind of
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:32.320]  like big brother his face straight on posterized it or whatever and I want to
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:38.600]  Hitler mustache and I want it to say dictator scum dictator than scum his
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:45.440]  face info wars calm on the bottom and we don't have time for this phase one
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.560]  there'll be two prizes five thousand dollars for whoever hangs the most of
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:59.520]  them up in legal lawful places by by and shoots video of it and puts it up on
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:04.800]  YouTube by this Friday then they'll be phase two next week whoever hangs up the
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:10.880]  most in legal and lawful areas everywhere and videotape sitting puts it on
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:16.320]  YouTube ten thousand dollars all right here's the deal because I started
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:19.520]  thinking about they could kill me or arrest me anytime we've got to use these
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:23.840]  powerful patriots we're ready to fight now because the media even though the
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:26.480]  memo is going to go out it's going to take debate on this and they're going to
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:29.880]  attack the First Amendment and then others are going to do it they won't be
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.600]  able to help themselves like I shouldn't even explain how they do it right now
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:38.000]  they'll try to block us but it doesn't matter I want you know dictator scum
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.160]  Obama's face with a Hitler mustache info wars calm how's that sound let's see
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:47.560]  how they like that okay I mean folks you ready right now and it isn't even the
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:52.080]  money just makes it fun it's whoever hangs up the most in legal lawful areas
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:57.320]  and whoever and then you shoot a video of it and then you email it to contest
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:03.920]  and info wars calm it's got to be into me by Friday night and we will get the
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:07.240]  poster up by the end of the day it's a new contest and I'll get the other one
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:11.040]  judged and done by next Thursday the but I mean this is going to be powerful
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:15.800]  what do you think of that idea that's awesome that's a great idea because I'm
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:19.280]  tired of just sitting here desperately I'm tired of just watching him do all
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:28.440]  this he is a dictator scum or dictator traitor dictator filth and it's
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:31.000]  perfect putting a mustache on it was because they'll spin it to say we're
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.880]  being racist oh really we're saying a Nazis bad who's white again this color
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:38.400]  stuff means nothing folks they use that as a distraction to get us against each
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:46.760]  other I mean Obama is pure evil pure unadulterated crystalline evil who he
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:52.000]  represents what he does he is anything else sir oh yeah just one more quick
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.240]  little request I'd love to do a loud battle roar with you right here on air
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:05.800]  let's do it I don't have much voice left I can't do too much around people
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:09.840]  think I appreciate your call my brother people are like one time a radio
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:14.120]  consultant wanted to come visit with me a big national radio consultant and he's
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:18.720]  like Alex I really enjoy the show over the years and but you know I kind of like
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:22.760]  the voice you were doing like four or five years ago you know now it just
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:27.040]  sounds so scratchy and I'm like what do you think I have a fake radio voice what
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.160]  do you think I try to sound like a toad I mean if I focus right now and try to
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:35.560]  speak you know like this I cannot sound too deep but I just start talking that
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:40.200]  I've fried my voice screaming and bullhorning and doing all this radio and
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:45.120]  TV I mean okay that's what's happening here but I just really can't roar and
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:50.840]  scream anymore I say that I did it probably 25 hours at Bilderberg over four
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:55.080]  days and then you see that video where I'm around with tarp with them like
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:43:00.280]  Jones is drunk I'm sure of it actually had had had two glasses of wine but more
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:04.880]  like tired and I was like very nice tarp play that's good I mean my voice you know
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:08.440]  like you've heard cheerleaders after the football game they sound like Marine
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:14.200]  Corps drill sergeants my voice is fried let's go ahead and talk to Oz in Texas
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:19.240]  Oz you're on the air go ahead greetings from Fredericksburg Texas how are you
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:23.760]  doing Atlas Jones I don't know about that if I'm Atlas we're in trouble you guys
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:28.600]  are Atlas all of us together with the idea of freedom and justice we are Atlas
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:32.600]  yes absolutely I have some rapid-fire stuff for you here real quick planet
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:37.920]  info wars tell everybody it's beta no one's censoring them okay just just back
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:42.480]  up your stuff and repost it okay second thing you've been talking a lot of
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:49.840]  nanotech lately type in and Google IV in space DX see what you get it's the New
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:53.840]  World Order shopping list it's incredible there's a PDF that goes with it
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:58.960]  let's go back to planet info wars and then we'll go to your next point I told
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:04.000]  people it's beta and it's got hundreds of thousands of people on it 20,000 with
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  profiles or 22,000 and it's it's we've got consultants in here we're trying to
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.160]  make it work that's why I'm not promoting it too much because I want to
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:17.040]  make sure it's I mean we've already had this happen once before and and and
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:20.840]  yeah people get their page erased so there's a problem and I get all these
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:24.720]  calls and emails and text hey you're you're you're erasing this what was your
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:28.480]  side about you know it was about the Second Amendment and I walk in the back
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:33.040]  and they go no no it's erasing things and then repot or or like a backup server
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:37.840]  goes down see we when you have a big site with a lot of traffic but also a lot
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:40.840]  of stuff going on on it I'm on an IT person but this is how it's been
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.240]  explained you've got different types of servers like part of it can be on cloud
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:50.160]  servers other stuff on CDN but you've got to have original you know command
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:54.720]  systems on you know server farms themselves and so you've got to break
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:00.520]  that up and so when a server goes down then part of the site goes away but
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:04.400]  some of the sites still there I don't know how to explain that and so yeah
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:09.480]  people will come in and sometimes comment on info wars and they don't see
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:13.840]  their comment for like 10 minutes because the caching server's behind and
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:17.760]  they think my gosh I've been censored what no and they'll post 10 times
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:22.280]  griping about it and then later it comes up and you see their 10 posts
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:26.280]  complaining they're like oh look after I complained they went ahead and put it
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:30.800]  through this is an example of YouTube censoring they do censor but not in the
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:36.040]  way people think always when a new video goes up it says 301 views 305 views
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:39.920]  that's when you first upload it's on one server from folks I've talked to
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:45.880]  inside YouTube then once it goes past that level it caches to other servers
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:51.720]  then then they run a program to see what all the different views were and it
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:54.920]  integrates it together and that's why sometimes it takes a day to update
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:46:00.240]  people all think that that is a censorship no no that's not what's
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:04.340]  happening so again Planet Info Wars is there but listen there's going to be
[01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:09.040]  trolls that complain about everything that's what they do that's their job and
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:12.480]  you're not gonna convince them and they're not gonna listen because they
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:18.480]  don't care so it's a non-issue it's in beta they don't know what beta means but
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:21.640]  overall I think the site's doing good what do you think of Planet Info Wars
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:25.600]  dot-com I love it I use it all the time my only mistake is I don't back up my
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:28.780]  work and I post stuff on the fly and then when I lose it I have to go redo my
[01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:33.600]  research but that's my bad so hold on they're talking to me real quick hold
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:36.440]  on I'm sorry I couldn't hear over you and them talking to me what was that
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:43.720]  John are you on air right now yeah what I remember we went through a whole deal
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:47.400]  I want to be able to have it you guys never get in the habit of knowing how to
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:51.240]  do it it's kind of a Byzantine thing for you guys to put yourselves on air I
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.000]  want you guys to get on air enough where you know how to put yourselves on air
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.480]  so that it's not like a big rocket science deal every time you do so we're
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:01.960]  gonna put the collar on hold long as this takes because what happens is
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:05.360]  they're always talking to me and stuff and then it doesn't make any sense on
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:10.680]  air and it breaks up my whole flow and then nobody's on air it can we can we
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.400]  put him on air now
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:19.320]  up can't hearing can't hearing this is what I'm talking about right here I mean
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:25.520]  this is not be a big deal so we're just gonna sit here till this happens I mean
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:29.360]  this is what I'm talking about ladies and gentlemen okay just don't talk to me
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:34.240]  anymore okay obviously that's not gonna work okay thank you going back to the
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:39.640]  caller go ahead sir all right the IV and DX it's the nanotechnology the
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:46.640]  future is the 2045 thing it's it's right there it's a PDF it's it's a government
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:51.800]  document DARPA it's I mean it's in your face that's why I'm going crazy we have
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:56.880]  evil in control building an evil system it's taking us to an evil place period
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:01.240]  the proof is now overwhelming tell us about the DARPA document again okay
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:04.960]  well basically what it says is that we want we want to develop nanites that we
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:08.200]  can inject in our soldiers so that when they go out in the field we can see
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:12.000]  where the radiological attacks are we can see what the radiation levels are we
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.840]  can see what all this stuff is and their little nanites will send sensors back
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:20.920]  and it just turns them into lemurs I mean you're basically gonna turn our troops
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:25.360]  into little dagger counters no no they've gone from saying we'll never put
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:30.320]  chips into you to putting chips in troops officers and others about five
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:34.480]  six years ago we know it began and to now admitting they're testing drugs on
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:39.280]  them vaccines on them and yes we get a report where they said they're gonna
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:43.720]  inject these nanotech in the troops that are already testing it there's already
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:48.400]  nanotech and a lot of the food manufacturing processes it's all
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:54.120]  happening right now and it's total dehumanization ahead of they're not
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:57.760]  even being humans in combat it's going to be all robots with the globalist
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:02.040]  controlling it with robots working on robots that's the checkmate for the new
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:05.760]  world order that's what they're moving towards right now and they don't care
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:09.240]  that we know they're already soft killing us they're already moving forward
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:13.360]  now I mean I'd seen that article Paul did about a month ago I'd seen documents
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:16.840]  previous to that but what's the specific document you were talking about it's
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:22.400]  it's got IV in and then you put a space in DX and Google and it'll come up it's a
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:27.080]  DARPA document and basically what it is is a bid list and what they're doing
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:30.720]  it's an open call wait all I do is put in hold on a minute let's see the
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:43.560]  nanotech reports IV in dot DX no no no IV in space DX space DX D D as in David X
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:52.920]  all right oh yeah here it is yeah in vivo nano sensors for diagnostics and
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:59.720]  it's FBO dot gov yeah it's I hadn't seen this one but yeah they say they're
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:04.680]  already testing this stuff on the troops and it goes right through the
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:08.280]  blood-brain barrier and again the the globalists say they're big revolutions
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:13.040]  bio weapon as well are these nanobots they're really genetically engineered
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:17.320]  like basically computer viruses for the brain that's all viruses is a
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:22.440]  unliving piece of piece of data that program cells that go in and eat certain
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:26.160]  areas of your brain and they're advertised that you'll never be upset
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:31.360]  again because yeah you're gonna be a zombie it's DARPA dash BAA dash 12 dot
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:37.000]  33 document yep there it is quite loving nanotech for the troops and then use
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:43.200]  them out in the radiation as it's like you know my dad asked professor once he
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:46.440]  said why don't they use monkeys for nuclear testing why do they use troops
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:51.440]  and the professor said because troops are cheaper than monkeys all right
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:51:02.880]  anything else sir you saw what well hi this is Alex Jones did you know that
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:06.280]  the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:10.160]  vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:13.640]  seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:17.000]  all performed even golden silver before in this country and it's possible that
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.760]  could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:25.520]  together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank

[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:23.880]  and go 12,000 rpms and throw a throw a rod we got people in there setting up new
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:28.040]  studios stringing lights the crew running around hooking stuff up we are
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:33.000]  moving forward but we all can feel the energy of tyranny and the energy of
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:38.240]  liberty challenging each other the energy of freedom versus the energy of
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:44.080]  evil good versus evil and everybody can feel it I mean if you're awake it's
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:48.720]  electric and then you look at people who are in a zombie state well it's up to us
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:54.640]  to shake them out of it it's up to us to make such statements that it brings them
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:58.360]  to their knees the second amendments one area we've been winning the fact that
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:01.880]  millions of guns are being sold a month and in questionnaires people say it's
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:05.880]  because we don't trust the government is a serious vote against their arms build
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:15.080]  up against us for a balance of power it's a major vote that people all over the
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:18.640]  country are doing open carry there were people all over the place open care
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:23.240]  carry with firearms on their sides at Bilderberg and that really got the
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:30.960]  system's attention all the announcements of spying and drones it's it's to
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:36.600]  intimidate you we don't want violence but there is that check there that of
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:41.840]  government that's killed 262 million people last century thinks it's gonna
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:47.480]  do it without being resisted they're wrong and we're not just gonna I'm not
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:51.200]  even gonna get into it the point is is that the sleeping giant is waking up and
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:55.920]  I'm running around like a piranha around here during the breaks and I've just we
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:01.280]  all have to remember CC I want to do everything it's up to you the listeners
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:05.560]  to start doing something whether it's spreading the word about the broadcast or
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:10.160]  whether it's going and doing your own local radio show is you got to buy the
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:17.120]  time it doesn't matter access TV calling Congress marching starting a local
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:22.640]  newspaper whatever it is you better do it now use it or lose it people are
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:27.760]  ready to wake up and listen just because 50% of the public or so are in total
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:31.240]  commas and laugh at you they've always been in commas in history there's
[01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:34.520]  always been thumb suckers that don't care there's always been people who
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:38.440]  aren't involved there's always been people who won't listen they don't count a
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:44.520]  bunch of drooling spectators don't count they think it's work to be informed
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:48.920]  they think it's work to be involved they don't understand it's the animating
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:53.680]  contests for liberty the Thomas Jefferson talked about we I think my lucky
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.960]  stars every day I think God I was born free and then I woke up to this stuff and
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:01.760]  you ought to thank God you're awakened involved I salute all of you that love
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:06.040]  liberty and the fact that we're so fired up and trying to find out ways to beat
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:11.440]  these people shows that we will defeat the enemy Nathan in Missouri you're on
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:18.640]  the air welcome yes sir can you hear me yes okay I just want to thank God bless
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:25.400]  you I'll be praying for you and your family I do get a sense that lately you've
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:30.360]  been saying people call in they say thank you and you respectfully deflected and I
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:36.360]  finally you finally clicked you want us to go ahead and take this moving and
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:40.800]  just move it forward and one thing that I think I'm going to get into is looking
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:48.480]  at the we are change movement and actually confronting these politicians the
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:54.920]  question I have is I think partly in some other people talk about hey we need to
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:59.200]  go ahead and get everything politicized we need to get an organization going do
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:02.480]  you have any advice on how to do that or is there anything going on behind the
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:09.760]  scenes you need to low-intention look look look look look the State
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:14.800]  Department's having to run TV ads in Europe saying come here America's free
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:18.560]  see they want to shut America down and bankrupt everything but they still want
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:23.600]  some of their tourism but it's so horrible no one will come wreck them they
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:27.240]  want to wreck us we wreck them their dictators their murderers their
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:32.440]  criminals their scum call them out that's the political movement okay our
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:37.000]  country was taken over we got to get that message out okay forget all the

[01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:01.960]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs system and
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:05.760]  how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the

[02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:13.520]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:21.840]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:28.240]  all right here's the deal I'm gonna take a bunch of calls in this segment the
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:33.280]  next and I'm news blitzing until the end of the hour if I have to cover all the
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:39.720]  news thank you for joining us Obama says he'll legalize the illegal aliens who
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:43.520]  every once he'll ban your guns without law he'll shut down your power plant he'll
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:48.600]  launch wars he's God in the neocon media and even making a big deal out of it
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:53.160]  hardly let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Florida you're on the air Steve
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:59.120]  thanks for holding yeah thank you good afternoon Alex first of all I just wanted
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:04.840]  to say that I have a good suggestion for a theme a lot of lines of you know you're
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:09.560]  talking about the Joker Obama Joker posters and the new one that you're
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:15.760]  coming up with and I think the title under it should be Obamni 213
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:26.040]  tyranny and overdrive because you know Obama and Romney you've got no
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:29.880]  difference and that's all it's going to be is the acceleration of the tyranny
[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:40.120]  so Obamni 2000 2013 tyranny and overdrive but I also want to say you had
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:46.360]  done this excellent interview last week with James Wesley Rawls and I went to his
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:53.400]  website survival blog calm and he has a link there to what happened in Waco in
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:58.280]  93 everybody needs to look at this with the two-part documentary called Waco the
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:03.400]  rules of engagement it's excellent yeah they send the Delta Force to murder the
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:07.200]  children as well that the order was kill them all including one-year-old babies
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:12.840]  with pleasure they did yeah and here's the thing you know there's a religious
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:17.200]  aspect of that because you know they were quote-unquote Christian called
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:21.560]  Mount Carmel because that in the Bible in the Old Testament is where Elijah met
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:25.440]  the Prophet of Baal and the fire came down and took the sacrifice showing who
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:29.720]  the real God was so they took that to the extreme okay well we'll just you know
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:34.080]  they call it this so we'll just make it for real you know as far as what we're
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:38.240]  gonna do but I want to say everybody needs to look at that and just replace
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:44.120]  the name of David Kaurash your burning house with your own name and your church
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:47.840]  your church's name with the name of Lance the billions because the thing is
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:50.840]  you know there's people while you know they were caught they got what they
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:55.360]  deserve blah blah blah oh no no no the ATF on in that video it's their own
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:59.440]  footage they said we're gonna get more funding we picked a group so we can then
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:04.040]  go after any church as we want they picked it to be the rollout of a new war
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:08.760]  against the American people and it backfired you see the good news is as
[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:13.560]  this stuff gets worse and worse it's going to backfire for every action
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:20.040]  there's an equal and opposite reaction my friend well I just I just got so angry
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:24.000]  watching this out and the thing that really angered me the most was seeing
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:30.720]  the FBI special agent testifying before Congress as well as these other clowns
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:35.960]  lately contradicting all the expert testimony and lying through their teeth
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:42.180]  and here they show the photos of these people especially the children burned to
[02:03:42.180 --> 02:03:47.880]  death in this fire that's your children folks and the fan started the fire it's

[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:52.600]  through your calls as quickly as possible Nate in New Jersey you're on the
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:09:02.440]  air welcome hey Alex I gotta tell you you say about how people are waking up
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:06.920]  I've got a friend of mine who's younger than me he's 16 years old goes to the
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:13.080]  government reeducation camps known as public school he went on an incredible
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:17.880]  rant about just how awake he is and realizing that public school today are a
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:23.040]  joke and my other friend of mine I mean he's not a big reader yours but he just
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:28.360]  went on an amazing rant I just listening to two of my friends who are around my
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:32.640]  age and I think you know keep college age kids are probably the easiest to wake
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:37.360]  up because I get people who come up to me and they say they you know they you
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:43.160]  post the most interesting news stories why what generation you think is the
[02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:48.840]  easiest to wake up or you know easiest to wake up with would you say your phone
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:53.400]  yeah your phone's pretty bad I'm making out most of it or what do you what was
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:56.920]  the last point what of our generation or what generations the easiest to wake
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:04.200]  up yeah I think it varies widely but most folks if they're older are either
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:08.560]  already awake or they're in denial and will never wake up so obviously young
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:15.040]  people are the group to target but look someone can seem like they're completely
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:20.080]  asleep and you say things to them that make them wake up a month later but you
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:25.280]  never talked to him again it's all part of planting seeds and or you can wake
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:29.240]  somebody up right there on the spot if somebody gets angry at you that means
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:34.560]  they're a lot closer to waking up than if they just laugh at you and again we
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:40.840]  don't need everybody some people just are stupid everybody is awake to a
[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:45.640]  certain extent nowadays I mean because so much of this agenda is out on the
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:50.160]  open it's just instead of denying all the tyranny they say the tyranny is good
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:56.040]  or make excuses for it and and like you said I'm seeing people everywhere
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:01.360]  spontaneously awakened because the deeper the sleep sometimes you can really
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:07.920]  come out of it quick anything else well first of all you mentioned you mentioned
[02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:12.800]  yourself Glenn Beck and Matt Brudge as sort of like a searmen of the alternative
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:20.360]  media do you know this guy by the name of Ben Swan no and I've heard that name
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:26.000]  somebody called him like a month ago about it yeah because he is a reporter
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:32.680]  for the local news station in Cincinnati Ohio he was one of the few people to
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:38.080]  break mostly Ron Paul centered stories but he also reported on the NDAA oh yeah
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:44.000]  he's a he's a younger guy with dark hair yeah yeah home school yeah no no I've
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.880]  seen that fella yeah there's all sorts of local people who are telling the truth
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:52.960]  and getting huge audiences that's the thing local news directors are
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:58.520]  discovering you talk about liberty and freedom suddenly it's popular so just
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:02.440]  from a market base they're letting more and more people get on the air and tell
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:09.400]  the truth great points good to hear from you yeah look all of us just need to get
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:13.560]  out there and start speaking out let me tell you this Obama thing is gonna be
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:20.320]  big I'm gonna come up with a couple of poster designs one of them is dictator
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:27.880]  trash or dictator scum Obama's face with a Hitler mustache because that will
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:32.520]  really make the system go crazy you got to get him real mad like a red red cape
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:38.000]  to the ball because it's their attack that's gonna get the attention I know
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.760]  the White House listens that you're not gonna be able to stop the local media
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:46.040]  from covering this okay you're not in full control in their zest to defend you
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:50.440]  they will be defeated and then info wars dot com on the bottom but we should
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:56.040]  also do that famous poster from 96 of Tony Blair black and white photo black
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:01.800]  cut out across his eyes with demon eyes and then say dictator demon info wars

[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:48.080]  want to just take the money we've accrued and do nothing with it people are
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:52.400]  like $10,000 folks you couldn't pay $10,000 to get a local news station to
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:57.240]  do a three-minute report on you we'll probably get 50 to 100 or more stations
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:01.040]  to cover this this will be a million two million dollars in advertising for the
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:05.560]  truth so before people say well that's a big prize look I could say just do it the
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:11.280]  listeners would I want to put some competition in this I will defile your

[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:31.560]  next level around here in the fight against tyranny Doris in Tennessee you're
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:43.120]  on the air Alex yeah well I just wanted to talk about the reason that I think
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:49.520]  people are they're afraid of their gub at the de facto government no no no they're
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:54.600]  afraid you should be afraid of letting them win people the danger is in not
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:59.600]  fighting back the danger is in going along with this you idiots sorry go
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:04.480]  ahead they fear they fear that the fact of government and I went down to my
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:12.840]  local councilman if you want to call it that I came under such persecution and
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:21.160]  such a torment that I ended up having to pay $5,000 which it was well worth it
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:27.080]  the guy the guy from the Daily Teller that called out Obama the other day yes
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:34.800]  when he okay he he was a patriot and Chris Matthews on Fox News said he
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:40.520]  should never be allowed to be in the press corps again that's that's what
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:45.320]  we're dealing with people like Chris Matthews telling people what to think
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:50.960]  he's a modern day fair look what I did your decade ago confronting politicians
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:54.320]  in press conferences and getting arrested and stuff that we are changed has
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:59.360]  taken to the 10th level of magnitude now is gonna make people like Daily Caller
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:02.840]  that are competing with us start doing that and that's great cuz I'm not in
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:06.640]  competition with them they think I'm in competition with them I want them to be
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:11.240]  ten times bigger than info wars.com I just want to have a future here and
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:16.520]  that's what we need is to stop going and having Obama shovel lies at us like

[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:35.520]  those two but can I make a comment real quick Alex I got fired for my job for
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:41.520]  bringing up the flu shot oh really tell me doctor okay there was a doctor and he
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:46.560]  was talking about flu shots and I work at a treatment center and he was
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:50.520]  extolling basically why the HPV shot was good and he said he was gonna give it
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:56.280]  to his seven-year-old boy whether he wanted it or not and even though I work
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:59.320]  there I have to sit in on these lectures and I have to kind of bite my tongue
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:03.320]  but finally I had to say something because when he said that I was just

[02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:11.800]  to Randy in Ohio Randy you're on the air welcome hi Alex I wanted to share some
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:15.960]  information that I had found that I think other info warriors would appreciate
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:25.440]  I found a online on Netflix there was a show called Ethos Woody Harrelson kind
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:29.960]  of like it's like a documentary he goes over all the same stuff that you talk
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:34.000]  about and it's kind of more like an introductory and he's a latecomer to the
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:40.520]  game of talking about the truth but I mean I know Woody Harrelson last time
[02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:43.240]  we were talking to him he was ready to come on he's always like when I finish
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:47.560]  this movie I mean I'm in a movie with him I'm in scanner darkly I mean he's
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:52.680]  I mean he's awake to a lot of things but sure go ahead he drops a couple names
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:58.160]  that I found pretty interesting one of them is Edward Bernays the nephew of
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:02.920]  Sigmund Freud yeah the father of propaganda there you go and when you
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:08.440]  know the playbook that they're using a lot easier to see through their lies so
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:14.560]  between him and Walter Lippmann they pretty much built this whole propaganda
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:20.200]  machine he wrote a book called propaganda and he develops a tool called
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:26.280]  engineering of consent basically we we are stumbag citizens and we don't deserve
[02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:30.400]  the right to have a choice we need to be influenced no he's the guy that got it
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:35.360]  it's changing from the Department of War to the Department of Defense and he's
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:38.360]  the guy that got women to smoke cigarettes he's the guy that helped break up
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:43.400]  the family have you seen my film Terror Storm or or any of our special reports
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:48.360]  on Edward Bernays of the last decade I have not seen the ones on Edward Bernays
[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:53.880]  I've seen the police state and a couple other ones on YouTube and I thought they
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:57.920]  were excellent well I'm not like going hey we covered ever Bernays first hey
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:01.080]  come on now man that's where Woody Harrelson learned about all that stuff
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:06.760]  but listen good to hear from you brother let's go to Miranda in Montana
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:12.120]  welcome hi Alex I'm calling from the great state of Montana I'm a long-time
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:17.280]  listener first-time caller prison planet TV number thank you and I'm a little
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:21.480]  confused I've got a question for you with all this evidence that's out there
[02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:25.640]  concerning Obama's birth certificate and the fact that he was not eligible to
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:32.040]  become a president why hasn't any I don't care if a Republican Democrat
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:38.680]  presidential candidate anybody gone full bore against the dictator and get him
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:43.640]  in peace and all of his executive orders and all the rules that he's made and
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:47.520]  laws that he's helped pass including Obamacare will be thrown out the door
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:52.840]  well tell you why because Bush was involved in a fast and furious operation
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:56.840]  as well and I predicted that when Holder got in trouble he would use that he did
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:00.000]  wasn't hard to predict people are like how did you do that well I mean it's
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:04.560]  Bush was doing similar things from our sources so Holder's gonna know about that
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:10.800]  they all each administration that leaves has the files on everybody and so the
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:17.240]  Clintons have the files on Bush in the bush that came before them and Bush has
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:21.960]  the files on them and then Bush Jr. has the files and Obama has the files and
[02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:27.480]  so they all know where the bodies are buried and so once things get to that
[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:31.520]  level of corruption nobody can begin to try to reverse any of it because
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:37.200]  everybody has dirt on the others you know what a Mexican standoff is right
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:43.360]  yes that's where just everybody is pointing guns at each other in a circle
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:48.920]  and no one can pull the trigger nobody can put their gun down because it's a
[02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:53.600]  Mexican standoff that's what happens with corruption is a giant Mexican standoff
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:58.960]  that's why I mean I'm really devastated about this whole Ron Paul and Rand Paul
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:02.640]  thing but how come they didn't come up to the forefront with this in the
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:07.480]  beginning of their campaigns and and you know stand next to Sheriff Roppo and
[02:29:07.480 --> 02:29:10.600]  say you know this guy well I mean I get why they didn't really get into that
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:13.480]  because you can't a hundred percent prove it one way or the other you can
[02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:18.560]  prove though he says the UN runs our military you can prove he's saying the
[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:23.360]  illegals are legal outside of law you can prove he has the ATF saying they're
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:29.280]  gonna ban all semi-autos just cuz they feel like it no law I mean that's total
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:34.560]  illegal big government war against us so I don't criticize people that cover the
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:38.000]  bar through issue we've covered it I think clearly Obama's not who he says
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  he is but just because we don't know who he is we don't know exactly who he is
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:48.160]  you see we're not sure who he is we just know he's not who he says he is stay

[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:20.120]  welcome to your world yeah there's no going back let me just dive in randomly
[02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:25.160]  here in the stacks because there's so much we haven't gotten to yet today look
[02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:35.760]  at this Google reports alarming rise in censorship by governments that's the one
[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:39.560]  in Guardian isn't that funny Google itself has worked with governments to
[02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:45.280]  censor but it's just talking about governments that that aren't basically
[02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:51.040]  letting it the NSA come in and take control that's what they're discussing
[02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:59.200]  so you know Google is against soap up but then they support at least on the
[02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:05.200]  surface the other legislation there's a report here out of the Washington Post in
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:12.440]  the shadows so what is America's cyber war policy and then it goes over the
[02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:21.200]  Stuxnet and in the same article they discuss giving up our rights on the
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:24.640]  internet basically because of things like Stuxnet which they admit the US
[02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:30.160]  government created along with Israel just amazing brainwashing type stuff
[02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:35.520]  that's going on 35 Hertz seven killed in Chicago shootings I thought almost a
[02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:38.440]  total gun ban in the city would make it milk and honey with your mafia
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:45.120]  government weekend violence didn't stop for President Obama's Chicago visit and
[02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:51.760]  now all of America can be like Chicago I guess Rodney King after decades of drug
[02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:56.640]  problems and other issues was found dead at the bottom of a swimming pool and
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:02.960]  they have not discovered the exact cause of that yet I did some reports of
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:09.760]  the weekend on this subject nine-year-old girl banned from taking photos and I
[02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:13.680]  wrote with a YouTube video I did when a nine-year-old Scottish girl took photos
[02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:18.120]  of the prison food she was being fed at the local reeducation camp slave
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:22.760]  commanders banned her photo taking that's what the schools are basically prison
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:26.920]  reeducation and doctored nation center so people are like well is it really a
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:31.240]  reeducation camp yeah that's what they are Martha Payne stood her ground the
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:36.560]  rebellion ban was removed this is a microcosm of the fight we all face a
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:40.960]  daily against control freaks worldwide say no to pushy people in government and
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:45.160]  in private life or become slaves this is the history of the world when good
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:49.640]  people at scum boss them around in the name of safety we let the worst take over
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:55.160]  society now that's what I wrote about it here's the daily mail girl nine who
[02:35:55.160 --> 02:36:01.760]  became internet sensation with a picture blog of her terrible school dinners is
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:08.520]  silenced by counsel only for them to make a u-turn 24 hours later after Twitter
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:14.600]  backlash and she was getting donations for poor people she was pointing out of
[02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:18.560]  the food looks like some space food or something and you know government
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:23.360]  instinct was shut her up you don't have any free speech now when I saw this
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:29.880]  article Saturday I thought it was a joke until I found it in the Swedish
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:36.480]  newspapers and a bunch of publications here I was on info watch calm and saw
[02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:40.480]  it saw was the Huffington Post and I thought it might be their proposal
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:44.960]  because that's the kind of stuff they like or it was a satire piece but but
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:49.120]  then I remembered that feminist feminist in public schools try to make little
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:53.080]  kids sit a little boy sit on the toilet because they say it upset you know it's
[02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:57.680]  it's bad that men do different things than women and you always have
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:02.880]  excuses that it's more hygienic or whatever which I think is pure bull but
[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:10.000]  the point is that one of the leftist parties in Sweden put forward the
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:18.400]  proposal in a council that men be made to sit while urinating I'm not joking
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:22.920]  I'm not joking there they're banning soft drinks above 16 ounces and moving to
[02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:29.040]  ban popcorn and Milton rinks in New York I'm not joking they're launching 30,000
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:32.360]  armed drones I'm not joking they put cancer viruses in the vaccines to kill
[02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:37.200]  you and then brag about it I mean this is who these people are every scumbag who
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:41.160]  no one wants to be friends with no one wants to date no one wants to do
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:45.400]  business with no one wants to be around them no one likes them everyone hates
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:51.080]  them they go and they get into government or their big corporate chiefs who go
[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:54.240]  and merge with government to use government to suck off of us that's
[02:37:54.240 --> 02:38:00.720]  who they are they're the Legion of filth they all deserve the Legion of filth
[02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:06.560]  award male representatives of the Swarman Land County Council in Sweden
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:11.200]  should sit rather than stand while urinating and office restrooms were
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:14.800]  into a motion advanced by the local left party known as a socialist and
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:18.760]  feminist organization the party claims that seated urination is more
[02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:22.520]  hygienic for men the practice decreases the likelihood of puddles and other
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:26.560]  unwanted residue forming in the stall in addition see they want to run
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:31.080]  everything you know I was at a pet store and I mentioned this earlier I didn't
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:37.280]  tell the whole story and I had some fish for my son's fish she got a couple
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:43.800]  fish tanks and I had one type of fish over here another type and this woman's

[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:36.600]  the counter in front of me you know the fish he's got will attack the other
[02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:44.880]  fish and it just went on and on with her trying to get the woman behind the

[02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:08.560]  sure it's a lead weight to drag down the economy they want you bankrupt because
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:14.600]  that makes you easier to control all right here's this video clip this is out
[02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:23.120]  of the Daily Caller Bill Maher finds six black men to deem Matt Drudge racist and
[02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:30.160]  the reason I'm going to play this is when I've caught two black guys being paid
[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:34.320]  off on video at the Capitol and the state and the state board did say it was
[02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:40.080]  illegal by an anti gun control group it's all on video online is type Alex
[02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:44.320]  Jones catches bribery at state Capitol I get a call by the statesman after the
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:48.520]  video went viral this is like 12 years ago back when the Internet barely worked
[02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:54.640]  for video but it went viral because the NRA actually posted it and it was in a
[02:46:54.640 --> 02:46:57.600]  bunch of newspapers I get a call by the statesman about a week later the local
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:02.320]  paper and they said Mr. Jones why do you hate black people and I said is this
[02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:05.840]  really a reporter for the statesman they said yeah and I said give me your
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:08.960]  number I want to call back I don't believe this is you this actually happened
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:14.680]  and I call back up and sure enough it's at the statesman they transfer me to the
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:17.760]  guy and I'm like you're really from the statesman you call up asking why I hate
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:22.320]  black people he just answer the questions Jones and I was like okay well
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:27.400]  what is this about me goes would you have shown that video of the payoff if
[02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:32.200]  they wouldn't have been black and I went well of course I would it's it's wrong
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:38.560]  they were being paid off and the article opened the next day with Jones denies
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:45.920]  he's racist and then and the whole article was about am I a racist because I
[02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:50.520]  showed a white guy paying off these two black guys to get up there and go yo
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:55.600]  yo yo we're black gang bangers baby and we're gonna get you if you don't ban the
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:48:01.560]  guns yo literally I mean they got black guys to go up there and act like gang
[02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:06.000]  members to stereotype black people and say here's the scary black people
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:11.400]  restrict guns banned under 18 touching guns in Texas was the bill the bill they
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:17.080]  had the votes at the time was killed because of this and they literally had
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:20.960]  the black guys go up there and do an acting job and then we're paid I don't
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:28.360]  know 300 400 bucks a piece out out out in a corner area of the capital one of my
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:31.440]  moles saw the payoff begin and got me I ran around the corner and caught it on
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:37.240]  tape and asked him about it and they spun it that I was a racist oh you don't
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:40.520]  like government health care you're a racist well racist don't like Obama's
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:47.080]  health care plan I mean it's a joke they just throw it out there and so here is
[02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:51.480]  I mean Bill Marx not even really funny he just does these one-line stupid
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:56.200]  statements like look drudge out of you know thousands of photos he shows a
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:02.080]  month on average why here's six photos of black people you know I mean if
[02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:07.120]  Michael George's teams last in the NBA you're gonna have a photo about it or if
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:11.400]  a mayor gets caught doing you know or I remember that article on drudge the the
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:17.240]  mayor had said there's too many Asians in we ought to you know basically kick
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:21.440]  them out of DC that's why he was in the news because he did something that was
[02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:26.120]  very offensive not because Matt drudge is a racist and again they do this
[02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:31.560]  to everybody I've had nightline here or it was MSNBC and they go why don't you
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:37.440]  like black people Alex yeah you know and again this is what they do here's the
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:48.120]  clip of Bill Maher engaged in defamation the problem with racism is Matt drudge
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:53.920]  I picked from Matt drudge's website just as over a month we monitor this just as
[02:49:53.920 --> 02:49:58.480]  a couple just some of the pictures that were on Matt there Mike Tyson looking
[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:05.200]  like he's gonna eat your head oh yes Louis Farrakhan because he's so relevant
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:13.480]  now oh and Marion Barry he's in the news every day also oh yes Reverend Wright
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:17.440]  because he matters to your life so much this is who appears on the drudge
[02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:24.000]  report oh yes and there's Al Sharpton telling Eric Holder what he should do and
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:30.280]  Michael Jordan angry because that's how we all remember him this is racism in
[02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:40.400]  America this is racism in America thousands of photos six photos of black
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:45.480]  people I mean there's white people everybody on there every day and the
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:51.200]  idea is you can't show black people who are 12% of the population acting badly
[02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:55.840]  or your erases you can't even say it's a racial attack when black people attack
[02:50:55.840 --> 02:51:00.680]  white people again that's the political poverty pimp control system right there

[02:54:29.400 --> 02:54:34.880]  that they're so cold-blooded in their operations and they're so over the top
[02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:41.880]  it's like the Associated Press you look it up right now admits there were 46,000
[02:54:41.880 --> 02:54:50.240]  plus paralyzed or dead children in 2011 in India alone with the UN slash Bill
[02:54:50.240 --> 02:54:58.920]  Gates vaccine program when they give them the polio vaccine I mean at its
[02:54:58.920 --> 02:55:03.680]  height in India back in the 50s and 60s polio wasn't killing or maiming that
[02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:09.120]  many a year and they're like but but it's a shot or it's oral it's good you're

[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:30.560]  Africa and just shoot some to take their property and then I've got to hear Mr.
[02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:37.200]  abortion Mr. Eugenics Bill Maher lecture us about how if you show a picture of a
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:42.840]  black person you're bad you're not allowed to report on black people on the
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:48.400]  news that's racist but if you want to kill some black people hey baby knock
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:58.160]  yourself out here's an article Taliban to US in drone strikes in Pakistan or no
[02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:02.120]  more polio vaccines they're saying they're gonna religiously order their
[02:56:02.120 --> 02:56:08.960]  people and it's got I love how they now even use the new polio cases their
[02:56:08.960 --> 02:56:13.080]  vaccines used to push it the news will even show kids paralyzed by them or dead
[02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:18.440]  that day there's no end of these people a Taliban commander in northwest
[02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:21.720]  Pakistan has announced a ban on polio vaccines for children as long as the
[02:56:21.720 --> 02:56:25.200]  United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region according to
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:30.280]  a statement by the Taliban polio drops will be banned in north was here a
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:33.920]  stand until the drone strikes are stopped to the statement released Saturday
[02:56:33.920 --> 02:56:38.800]  where the drone cells been gonna sell will just sell here almost every resident
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:42.760]  in north was here stand has become a mental patient because the drone strikes
[02:56:42.760 --> 02:56:46.600]  which are worse than polio the statement continued on the one hand the US
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:50.440]  spends millions of dollars to eliminate polio yeah right on the other hand it
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:57:00.880]  kills hundreds of us to with the help of its slave Pakistan Pakistan remains one
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:04.320]  of only three countries that have yet to eradicate polio yeah cuz they got a
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:09.800]  UN polio program there look it up folks they're the ones giving it to people and
[02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:13.000]  you raise this point it's like they don't want to discuss it they don't want
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:16.680]  to have a discussion about it they don't want to look at it look at these
[02:57:16.680 --> 02:57:20.520]  articles in the nanny said I didn't even get into this government website gives
[02:57:20.520 --> 02:57:28.760]  dad's tips on teaching kids hygiene how to eat that's cns news fatherhood.gov
[02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:32.720]  again you need the government to tell you how to wash your hands and take care
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:35.680]  of your kids cuz chances are the government broke up your family with
[02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:39.160]  its policies beforehand so just in case there's a father actually with his
