[00:00.000 --> 00:10.360]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:10.360 --> 00:17.600]  the Info War and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:17.600 --> 00:23.360]  Robert Mueller is the unelected unofficial president of the deep state and the Democrat
[00:23.360 --> 00:24.360]  party.
[00:24.360 --> 00:29.040]  He's rogue, he's out of control, he's doing anything and everything he can to try to destroy
[00:29.040 --> 00:35.200]  President Donald Trump and this country, here's Alex Jones breaking it down.
[00:35.200 --> 00:40.080]  Congressman Schiff taking over the Intelligence Committee of the House on January 2nd says
[00:40.080 --> 00:44.360]  Trump may face quote, real prospect of jail time.
[00:44.360 --> 00:49.600]  There's a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office, the Justice Department
[00:49.600 --> 00:54.400]  may indict him, that he may be the first president in quite some time to face the real
[00:54.400 --> 00:56.000]  prospect of jail time.
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.640]  And ABCNBC, Hype President Trump's inevitable impeachment by the Dems.
[01:01.640 --> 01:05.620]  Are we going to hear more of this in January now from leading Democrats that maybe there
[01:05.620 --> 01:07.680]  are impeachable offenses here?
[01:07.680 --> 01:12.800]  I think it's inevitable and in fact I think there's going to be a point where House Democrats
[01:12.800 --> 01:17.760]  are going to feel as if they don't open an impeachment inquiry over what they've seen
[01:17.760 --> 01:20.320]  so far, then what would be the trigger?
[01:20.320 --> 01:27.800]  And if Congress at all wants to be a watchdog for the executive branch, I think it's inevitable.
[01:27.800 --> 01:30.760]  So look, I think it's inevitable that an impeachment inquiry is going to get open.
[01:30.760 --> 01:34.880]  And as Jerry Nadler says, that doesn't mean they will end up impeaching him.
[01:34.880 --> 01:37.840]  But I think the investigation is going to open sooner rather than later.
[01:37.840 --> 01:39.200]  They at least have to go there.
[01:39.200 --> 01:45.440]  Jerry Nadler saying, if the campaign finance case as laid out by prosecutors is true, Mr.
[01:45.440 --> 01:50.720]  Trump would be likely to meet the criteria for an impeachable offense, and he said he
[01:50.720 --> 01:55.780]  would instruct his committee to investigate when he takes over in January.
[01:55.780 --> 01:59.080]  So I do think things have moved since last Friday.
[01:59.080 --> 02:03.080]  As we have said, the president is moving into a perilous period.
[02:03.080 --> 02:08.200]  They said during the campaign they weren't going to do that because Americans wouldn't
[02:08.200 --> 02:12.680]  have supposedly voted for Democrats in the midterms, but oh, now they are because they're
[02:12.680 --> 02:14.960]  desperate to cover up their own crimes.
[02:14.960 --> 02:19.720]  Meanwhile, Trump is accurately tweeted, the Comey lied to Congress.
[02:19.720 --> 02:25.880]  Comey told Congress, here's the big one of the 245 occasions that he lied that Trump's
[02:25.880 --> 02:26.880]  talking about.
[02:26.880 --> 02:32.680]  The big one that's ironclad is Comey saying, I've never leaked, and I don't know anyone
[02:32.680 --> 02:34.320]  that's leaked to the media.
[02:34.320 --> 02:40.000]  And it turned out he was the chief leaker, but he went, well, I gave the information
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.600]  to give it to the press, to a professor who would then give it to him.
[02:46.600 --> 02:55.240]  Oh, so I'm a drug dealer, and I give them the suitcase full of cocaine, and then my
[02:55.240 --> 03:01.680]  dealer goes and sells it to somebody I'm not involved in the cocaine dealing, Balderdash,
[03:01.680 --> 03:03.880]  BS, a loanee.
[03:03.880 --> 03:08.920]  And it goes on and on and on, and to watch the corporate press try to cover it up.
[03:08.920 --> 03:16.680]  It is just mind-blowing, and two years in, $33 million in just this fake investigation,
[03:16.680 --> 03:22.080]  and they have people pleading guilty for not paying taxes for taxicab services that Trump
[03:22.080 --> 03:26.320]  has nothing to do with New York, Michael Cohen, who did a 180 once they busted him, and other
[03:26.320 --> 03:27.320]  crap like that.
[03:27.320 --> 03:31.640]  I mean, this is incredibly ridiculous.
[03:31.640 --> 03:35.400]  For two years, they've been telling President Trump, oh, you're not the target, sir.
[03:35.400 --> 03:40.440]  We know you're not involved in Russiagate, in fact, there's nothing there, but they're
[03:40.440 --> 03:45.680]  just doing their investigation, even though it's all about some people brought in by Hillary
[03:45.680 --> 03:46.840]  and Obama.
[03:46.840 --> 03:52.280]  When you were president-elect, they were panicking, what were they going to do?
[03:52.280 --> 03:55.000]  They'd been in bed with Russia, they'd been in bed with China, they'd sold the nation
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  out.
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.160]  They're the folks that say having a nation's bad, that America existing, America was never
[04:00.160 --> 04:04.080]  great, it'll never be great, Governor Cuomo in New York.
[04:04.080 --> 04:11.920]  You're not going to make America great again, it was never that great.
[04:11.920 --> 04:24.160]  We have not reached greatness, we will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.
[04:24.160 --> 04:29.720]  Just look at the crazed look of, chef, you know, chef, and Alexander Cortez, you're not
[04:29.720 --> 04:35.080]  just waiting for a weird moment to grab a screenshot that isn't honest, they always
[04:35.080 --> 04:41.040]  have that power-mad lunatic look in their eyes.
[04:41.040 --> 04:49.000]  And now, today, Trump has been wild on Twitter, letting you know that he knows, and he figured
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.440]  out a while ago, but he's now letting you know that he knows the Russia investigation,
[04:53.440 --> 04:57.520]  Russia collusion investigation was fake from the very beginning.
[04:57.520 --> 05:04.120]  In the last few months, Info Wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[05:04.120 --> 05:07.520]  of many of our best-selling items, and then I came up with the idea last week, let's not
[05:07.520 --> 05:12.320]  just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off double-patriot points, let's
[05:12.320 --> 05:18.440]  extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[05:18.440 --> 05:22.520]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine, 4 to 5 super blue, you'll
[05:22.520 --> 05:28.240]  get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last, and what I mean by that is
[05:28.240 --> 05:32.120]  everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out, so whatever you order
[05:32.120 --> 05:36.280]  that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out, and then
[05:36.280 --> 05:39.480]  there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders, so in the next
[05:39.480 --> 05:45.560]  12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had, so this is a loss leader,
[05:45.560 --> 05:49.920]  we are losing money on this, this is our biggest sale ever, get your free gift, your free shipping
[05:49.920 --> 05:54.440]  everything, and don't fight the crowds in FullWorksStore.com, in FullWorksLife.com, or
[05:54.440 --> 06:22.320]  triple-8253-3139, God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[06:22.320 --> 06:32.280]  Here is something that really amazes me about modern society, modern culture here, on this
[06:32.280 --> 06:36.960]  Sunday, December 16th, 2018, Owen Schroyer filling in for Alex Jones on The Alex Jones
[06:36.960 --> 06:42.600]  Show, tons of news, video clips to get to, plus President Trump has tweeted about 12
[06:42.600 --> 06:51.320]  times today, so we're going to be reading all those as well, but if it's a new movie,
[06:51.320 --> 06:56.520]  a new comic movie, a new movie with a famous actor or actress in it, and it gets a bunch
[06:56.520 --> 07:00.600]  of hype, and a bunch of publicity, and a bunch of marketing, and they show it on the sporting
[07:00.600 --> 07:05.160]  events, and they do the interviews on late night TV, and they hype this movie up, and
[07:05.160 --> 07:12.600]  this movie, it's about a deep state civil war, or corruption in government, you know,
[07:12.600 --> 07:17.280]  on the inside, White House intrigue, and all this stuff, and if it's in a movie, well then
[07:17.280 --> 07:21.720]  it's like, you know, pop culture, it's cool, it has human interest, everybody wants to
[07:21.720 --> 07:27.640]  talk about it, people want to go see it, and so then it becomes a thing, but when it happens
[07:27.640 --> 07:35.960]  in real life, there's no interest, there's no big story, there's no big hype, there's
[07:35.960 --> 07:43.480]  no big publicity, and the only thing you really get is the propaganda coming out of one side
[07:43.480 --> 07:53.240]  of it acting like it's just one man that's responsible for all the corruption, and so
[07:53.240 --> 08:00.240]  there is no real civil war, it's just we gotta get the one man, and everybody buys into that,
[08:00.240 --> 08:06.160]  but what's really going on is you have an actual cold civil war happening right now
[08:06.160 --> 08:15.280]  in the White House, in Washington D.C., with, well, it's a complex group, but at the bottom
[08:15.280 --> 08:22.120]  line, people that have sold out, politicians that are puppets, people in the FBI, CIA that
[08:22.120 --> 08:27.960]  have sold out, you're learning some of these names, the Peter Strokes, the Andrew McCabe's,
[08:27.960 --> 08:36.360]  the Bob Mueller's, the James Comey's, we know the names now, so this is all going on, and
[08:36.360 --> 08:43.680]  you have them arresting and raiding innocent men and women's houses, lying about people,
[08:43.680 --> 08:50.080]  censoring the internet, and this is the real actual civil war happening in D.C., this is
[08:50.080 --> 08:58.040]  the real life cold civil war happening in the United States of America, but that's not
[08:58.040 --> 09:02.320]  the story, that's not the big hype.
[09:02.320 --> 09:10.080]  Again though, if it's in a comic book movie or some new TV show, that's the big hype,
[09:10.080 --> 09:17.880]  that's the big attraction, but when it actually happens, when it's actually going on, nobody
[09:17.880 --> 09:24.200]  even knows, and that's basically where we're at right now.
[09:24.200 --> 09:34.760]  And then it actually comes down to something so simple, so basic, so fundamental that you
[09:34.760 --> 09:41.120]  can't even believe really it's a debate, and that's the border.
[09:41.120 --> 09:47.080]  But doesn't it show you the fraud of the Democrat Party, where you can play all the clips, I
[09:47.080 --> 09:52.040]  mean we've done it a hundred times here, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Diane Feinstein, Hillary
[09:52.040 --> 09:56.480]  Clinton, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, all of them saying we need
[09:56.480 --> 10:02.800]  borders, we need border security, they all signed bills to fund walls, they all have
[10:02.800 --> 10:08.480]  walls in their own houses and gates and private security and guns, but what do they do?
[10:08.480 --> 10:16.680]  Now they say they want an open border, and then, I mean literally they want an open border.
[10:16.680 --> 10:18.960]  And so that becomes a debate.
[10:18.960 --> 10:26.800]  And so now citizens have to go down to the southern border to protect it, because that's
[10:26.800 --> 10:32.040]  how politically correct, and far to the left, our actual government has gone.
[10:32.040 --> 10:38.240]  Here's a report from Greg Rees highlighting the issue and the concern that just citizens
[10:38.240 --> 10:41.480]  of the United States have with an open southern border.
[10:41.480 --> 10:49.800]  The United Nations Global Compact for Migration was adopted on Monday by 164 governments at
[10:49.800 --> 10:55.320]  an international conference in Marrakesh, Morocco.
[10:55.320 --> 11:02.280]  The historic event was described by UN Chief Antonio Guterres as the creation of a road
[11:02.280 --> 11:06.120]  map to prevent suffering and chaos.
[11:06.120 --> 11:12.920]  More doublespeak from the failing globalist agenda, flooding nations with millions of
[11:12.920 --> 11:19.160]  foreigners who have no intention to assimilate and who are not held accountable for their
[11:19.160 --> 11:27.080]  criminal actions is perhaps the most potent recipe for suffering and chaos the world has
[11:27.080 --> 11:29.760]  ever known.
[11:29.760 --> 11:36.960]  The French, perhaps history's greatest nationalists, have reached their breaking point.
[11:36.960 --> 11:42.000]  They have been erecting multiple guillotines in the streets, a tool they invented in the
[11:42.000 --> 11:49.120]  French Revolution to chop off at least 40,000 heads of state.
[11:49.120 --> 11:55.080]  In Brussels, Belgium, the people have erupted in protest against their government for signing
[11:55.080 --> 11:57.480]  the UN Migration Compact.
[11:57.480 --> 12:06.120]  And ISIS has called for attacks against the Yellow Vest protest, as if in support of the
[12:06.120 --> 12:11.040]  globalist French government.
[12:11.040 --> 12:16.680]  While the global elites and the radical left have duped their submissive minions into thinking
[12:16.680 --> 12:23.560]  their open borders agenda is one of peace, the rest of us struggle to keep the world
[12:23.560 --> 12:29.680]  from falling into the hands of those who seek to gain more power at the expense of global
[12:29.680 --> 12:31.880]  destruction.
[12:31.880 --> 12:37.640]  Lebanon agreed to the UN Migration Compact, and they are digging tunnels beneath Israel's
[12:37.640 --> 12:39.520]  border wall.
[12:39.520 --> 12:47.480]  The tunnels are being dug by radical Islamic group Hezbollah, who seeks to destroy Israel.
[12:47.480 --> 12:54.280]  Mexico agreed to the UN Migration Compact, and with over $20 billion a year worth of
[12:54.280 --> 13:00.680]  illicit drug smuggling and tens of thousands of children being trafficked across the border
[13:00.680 --> 13:08.360]  as sex slaves, there is very good reason to secure the US border into Mexico.
[13:08.360 --> 13:14.680]  President Trump got elected on his promise to secure the border, and his deep state opponents
[13:14.680 --> 13:17.960]  are desperately fighting him on this issue.
[13:17.960 --> 13:25.200]  The black market business of sex and drugs is worth trillions of dollars, tax free and
[13:25.200 --> 13:26.200]  untraceable.
[13:26.200 --> 13:33.280]  It is the biggest domestic cash cow of the criminal cabal, which has entrenched itself
[13:33.280 --> 13:38.160]  deep within all branches of the US government.
[13:38.160 --> 13:45.160]  Just halfway through his term, President Trump has failed to secure the border.
[13:45.160 --> 13:51.160]  Citizen patriots such as the Oath Keepers have taken to the skies, patrolling the border
[13:51.160 --> 13:58.200]  from civilian aircraft, offering reconnaissance to the overwhelmed border patrol.
[13:58.200 --> 14:06.320]  And while there are military aircraft and blimps monitoring the border from the skies,
[14:06.320 --> 14:11.480]  we can clearly see miles of unprotected border along the Rio Grande.
[14:11.480 --> 14:19.000]  In a single weekend this month, Border Patrol agents arrested 1,900 illegal immigrants in
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.920]  South Texas, including gang members and child predators.
[14:24.920 --> 14:31.520]  With miles of wide open border and cartel safehouses, one can only guess how many are
[14:31.520 --> 14:35.840]  making it across each and every day.
[14:35.840 --> 14:41.160]  President Trump says he will shut down the government if he has to, and Nancy Pelosi
[14:41.160 --> 14:47.640]  says she'll keep the government closed forever rather than fund Trump's wall.
[14:47.640 --> 14:53.560]  But if a government cannot secure its own borders, then what is the purpose of government
[14:53.560 --> 14:54.560]  at all?
[14:54.560 --> 15:03.560]  And if the United Nations succeeds at opening up borders worldwide, then national sovereignty
[15:03.560 --> 15:10.560]  will become a thing of the past, and America will be no more.
[15:10.560 --> 15:14.960]  This is Gregory's reporting for NewsWars.com.
[15:14.960 --> 15:20.840]  And now Oath Keepers is putting out a call to action to citizens who want to help protect
[15:20.840 --> 15:21.840]  the southern border.
[15:21.840 --> 15:24.600]  Now we've had Stuart Rhodes in the studio breaking this down, you can go to OathKeepers.com
[15:24.600 --> 15:27.440]  and find out exactly what that entails.
[15:27.440 --> 15:31.880]  But when your own government has no interest in preserving the republic, when your own
[15:31.880 --> 15:35.600]  government has no interest in preserving a southern border, I guess you just have to
[15:35.600 --> 15:39.240]  take matters into your own hands then, don't you?
[15:39.240 --> 15:42.240]  Now folks, I didn't even plug this first segment.

[17:34.560 --> 17:39.240]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they
[17:39.240 --> 17:44.800]  want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control
[17:44.800 --> 17:45.800]  everyone.

[17:54.800 --> 17:59.240]  At InfoWars.com, Ford slash show.
[17:59.240 --> 18:04.480]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:04.480 --> 18:09.760]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:09.760 --> 18:16.520]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:16.520 --> 18:22.360]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:22.360 --> 18:25.720]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:25.720 --> 18:30.400]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[18:30.400 --> 18:35.680]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:35.680 --> 18:36.680]  symptoms.
[18:36.680 --> 18:40.600]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:40.600 --> 18:45.280]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:45.280 --> 18:51.080]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:51.080 --> 18:53.760]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:53.760 --> 18:59.040]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[18:59.040 --> 19:03.400]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[19:03.400 --> 19:07.640]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[19:07.640 --> 19:11.800]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[19:11.800 --> 19:18.920]  lights every day, but thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[19:18.920 --> 19:23.120]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[19:23.120 --> 19:27.280]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with
[19:27.280 --> 19:32.280]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[19:32.280 --> 19:39.520]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[19:39.520 --> 19:44.840]  To go to InfowarsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone, this is actually our last
[19:44.840 --> 19:47.200]  run of SuperMailVitality.
[19:47.200 --> 19:52.080]  So I want you to experience SuperMailVitality before it's too late.
[19:52.080 --> 20:10.480]  Unleash the SuperMail in you with SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:41.220 --> 20:27.200]  have a lot of things to discuss here on the Alice Jones show today and I'm
[20:27.200 --> 20:33.400]  going to be taking calls in the entire second hour, probably open up the phone lines perhaps
[20:33.400 --> 20:38.120]  in the next segment to discuss everything that's going on.
[20:38.120 --> 20:43.280]  The total collapse of globalism.
[20:43.280 --> 20:58.360]  Now how do you explain to somebody globalism or the threat of globalism?
[20:58.360 --> 21:05.360]  Because the concept of globalism, it's almost kind of like a vaccine where the science behind
[21:05.360 --> 21:11.680]  a vaccine is there and you know with the health industry and technology inevitably you could
[21:11.680 --> 21:16.720]  have vaccines that are safe and effective but what's the catch?
[21:16.720 --> 21:25.000]  Well the catch is whoever is making the vaccine and mass producing it and putting it out there,
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.520]  well they kind of are in charge of what goes into it, right?
[21:28.520 --> 21:31.600]  And so who is checking up on that?
[21:31.600 --> 21:35.320]  Well you do a little bit of research, you find out vaccine courts have their own separate
[21:35.320 --> 21:40.280]  justice system and they're never held accountable for the millions of deaths they're responsible
[21:40.280 --> 21:41.280]  for.
[21:41.280 --> 21:49.720]  Well that doesn't seem right, well they never talk about it so nobody says that.
[21:49.720 --> 21:54.200]  Just like globalism, well sure, okay globalism, well let's see humans with technology and
[21:54.200 --> 22:03.680]  our nature to just be social beings and expand our consciousness naturally, you know, globalism
[22:03.680 --> 22:11.080]  with the technology and everything, okay that's probably inevitable but what's the catch?
[22:11.080 --> 22:12.640]  Who's rolling it out?
[22:12.640 --> 22:14.120]  Who's deciding what it means?
[22:14.120 --> 22:22.440]  Who's deciding who gets their fingers on the levers of power?
[22:22.440 --> 22:30.520]  And so the elite and the establishment right now are doing everything they can to entrench
[22:30.520 --> 22:36.960]  themselves and their power structure as the establishment as globalism is being rolled
[22:36.960 --> 22:40.200]  out.
[22:40.200 --> 22:48.480]  So now their policy, their agenda is entrenched as the global government comes into manifestation
[22:48.480 --> 22:50.120]  except what's happening.
[22:50.120 --> 22:56.400]  Their plan has been exposed, it's failed in many areas and now there's total blowback.
[22:56.400 --> 23:00.980]  You see it politically with the election of a Donald Trump, the election of a Bolsonaro.
[23:00.980 --> 23:06.600]  You see it physically with the streets of France and the streets of Brussels where
[23:06.600 --> 23:12.960]  there are now riots going on against the EU and the UN.
[23:12.960 --> 23:30.380]  But that's a sign of the world changing and humanity trying to figure out how to adapt.
[23:30.380 --> 23:36.880]  So right now in Brussels people are in front of the EU headquarters and the police are
[23:36.880 --> 23:39.600]  looks like getting brutalized up there.
[23:39.600 --> 23:42.360]  It's symbolic for the rejection of globalism.
[23:42.360 --> 23:47.040]  In France you have the, looks like thousands if not hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions
[23:47.040 --> 23:53.600]  of people in the yellow vests out on the streets.
[23:53.600 --> 23:54.600]  What does it represent?
[23:54.600 --> 24:02.640]  French people, they don't want to see their country fall to globalism.
[24:02.640 --> 24:12.440]  And so that's kind of the political, geopolitical, philosophical civil war going on worldwide
[24:12.440 --> 24:15.200]  between nationalism and globalism.
[24:15.200 --> 24:22.540]  But then right here in the United States you have the true focus with the cold civil war
[24:22.540 --> 24:28.920]  going on between Donald Trump and the deep state who's led by Robert Mueller.
[24:28.920 --> 24:38.920]  And that's where most eyes are in the United States and most eyes are worldwide.
[24:38.920 --> 24:47.520]  But when you understand, it's all about the power structure that has been in power here
[24:47.520 --> 24:52.560]  in the United States in the West, working with the very power structures established
[24:52.560 --> 25:02.240]  in the East and in Europe and in North Africa and in the Middle East.
[25:02.240 --> 25:06.360]  And you see how they were all pushing for the same thing, globalism, open borders.
[25:06.360 --> 25:09.040]  They entrenched themselves.
[25:09.040 --> 25:10.960]  And then what happened?
[25:10.960 --> 25:15.600]  The people woke up and they didn't want to go that way so they elected Donald Trump.
[25:15.600 --> 25:17.100]  They elected Bolsonaro.
[25:17.100 --> 25:18.960]  They put in Nationalists in Italy.
[25:18.960 --> 25:24.080]  They put in Nationalists in other countries.
[25:24.080 --> 25:31.360]  But the biggest pushback now is the media where they act like none of this is even going
[25:31.360 --> 25:37.760]  on and the rejection of globalism, which is inevitable and progressive and the best,
[25:37.760 --> 25:45.960]  is racist, is bigoted, is homophobic, is just you name it.
[25:45.960 --> 25:51.600]  And all it is is people just saying, I want to have a country.
[25:51.600 --> 25:55.180]  I don't want to have open borders.
[25:55.180 --> 26:03.640]  And I'm sick of having to pay for it all when it's not in my own best interest.
[26:03.640 --> 26:07.120]  So that's just an overall picture of everything that's going on.
[26:07.120 --> 26:12.440]  And I got all the news here, again, thousands rallying against the UN, outside the EU headquarters
[26:12.440 --> 26:17.280]  in Brussels, thousands in the yellow jackets again this weekend in France.
[26:17.280 --> 26:24.080]  Meanwhile, in the Middle East, you've got places in Syria and Iraq that have been freed
[26:24.080 --> 26:29.140]  from ISIS that are actually celebrating Christmas pretty openly for the first time in years.
[26:29.140 --> 26:32.160]  Nobody talks about that.
[26:32.160 --> 26:41.120]  You have Turkey claiming that Trump is working on extraditing Gulen here, who runs all of
[26:41.120 --> 26:47.320]  these education camps in the United States.
[26:47.320 --> 26:54.880]  In fact, it's been Sebel Edmunds who has been making a big issue of that.
[26:54.880 --> 26:56.160]  And I've heard these rumors swirling.
[26:56.160 --> 26:58.640]  We'll see if anything comes with that.
[26:58.640 --> 27:04.040]  But then you have Putin says rap should be controlled in Russia, not banned.
[27:04.040 --> 27:07.200]  But see, isn't that why you love living in the United States?
[27:07.200 --> 27:12.040]  You can rap about pimping hoes and beating hoes and hoeing hoes, and it's all good in
[27:12.040 --> 27:13.560]  the United States.
[27:13.560 --> 27:22.520]  But if you say, baby, it's cold outside, well, FCC is coming to shut you down.
[27:22.520 --> 27:27.000]  So when I come back on the other side of this break, I'm going to hit all the headlines.
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.680]  I got video clips here.
[27:28.680 --> 27:32.280]  We got about 12 tweets from President Trump I'm going to read.
[27:32.280 --> 27:35.000]  SNL seems to be just getting more deranged every week.
[27:35.000 --> 27:42.160]  But folks, in this break, please go to infowarstore.com because unfortunately, we were not able
[27:42.160 --> 27:45.440]  to expand the way we wanted to in 2018.
[27:45.440 --> 27:51.400]  And that's because of different lawsuits and mainly the total censorship of Alex Jones
[27:51.400 --> 27:55.200]  and Info Wars on social media, which is the best place to expand and market.
[27:55.200 --> 28:00.760]  They just cut us off from the biggest highways in the United States when it comes to marketing
[28:00.760 --> 28:02.440]  and communication.
[28:02.440 --> 28:05.800]  So unfortunately, we were not able to expand, but we have plans to expand.
[28:05.800 --> 28:06.960]  You already have seen the clues.
[28:06.960 --> 28:07.960]  You've seen the new studios.
[28:07.960 --> 28:10.000]  You've seen us hiring more people.
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.080]  So with your support over this Christmas season, I think that we can make that happen
[28:13.080 --> 28:14.080]  in 2019.
[28:14.080 --> 28:16.320]  But we got great specials going on right now.
[28:16.320 --> 28:18.320]  Just check out all of them.
[28:18.320 --> 28:19.840]  This is we got all of these specials.
[28:19.840 --> 28:20.840]  I didn't even realize.

[28:25.040 --> 28:26.040]  Christmas.
[28:26.040 --> 28:27.040]  I guess they're still all live.

[28:28.040 --> 28:35.040]  So you got 60% off bodies, 60% off knockout, 60% off silver bullet, 55% off ultimate bone
[28:35.040 --> 28:39.120]  broth, just 55% off super male vitality.

[29:03.240 --> 29:06.800]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best selling items, but we've still got most of our best
[29:06.800 --> 29:07.800]  selling items in.
[29:07.800 --> 29:12.440]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days because we're guaranteed
[29:12.440 --> 29:17.160]  up to about the 19th bill to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas

[29:35.800 --> 29:37.520]  the t-shirts, all of it.
[29:37.520 --> 29:38.960]  Just go check out the sales.

[29:41.960 --> 29:44.800]  You're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[29:44.800 --> 29:46.800]  And thank you again all for your support.
[29:46.800 --> 29:51.320]  We're extending the sale until the 19th, but info wars is in your hands.
[29:51.320 --> 29:55.000]  Again, whatever you do, just spread the word about info wars.com and we're going to beat
[29:55.000 --> 29:56.000]  the globals together.
[29:56.000 --> 29:57.000]  Thank you.
[29:57.000 --> 30:05.040]  Everybody knows that history documents it, but there is a cult in every culture and every
[30:05.040 --> 30:08.440]  system throughout history that wants to hurt children.
[30:08.440 --> 30:09.560]  They want to abort children.
[30:09.560 --> 30:11.320]  They want to disease children.
[30:11.320 --> 30:12.440]  They want to abuse children.
[30:12.440 --> 30:14.080]  They want to confuse children.
[30:14.080 --> 30:15.240]  They want their essence.
[30:15.240 --> 30:16.240]  They want their soul.
[30:16.240 --> 30:17.520]  They want their spirit.
[30:17.520 --> 30:21.600]  They want their power because they are our future.
[30:21.600 --> 30:25.120]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice.
[30:25.120 --> 30:30.280]  It is about the West and it is about a human future and standing with each other and believing
[30:30.280 --> 30:31.280]  in a better future.
[30:31.280 --> 30:35.600]  So I just want to thank you all for your support, but I want to ask you all to pray for your
[30:35.600 --> 30:40.480]  own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for info wars
[30:40.480 --> 30:44.440]  and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[30:44.440 --> 30:46.520]  You have the power to override the sensors.
[30:46.520 --> 30:49.680]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[30:49.680 --> 30:54.000]  I know you've been taking action and I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble,
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.920]  but just remember you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[30:59.920 --> 31:04.800]  Info wars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the
[31:04.800 --> 31:08.840]  family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[31:08.840 --> 31:10.200]  We've been proven dead on.
[31:10.200 --> 31:14.040]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project.
[31:14.040 --> 31:18.320]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you.
[31:18.320 --> 31:23.160]  All words are not enough to think about of all the different systems of all the different
[31:23.160 --> 31:28.800]  political ideologies that you have been on target, promoting Americana and Renaissance
[31:28.800 --> 31:33.400]  and open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force and created their
[31:33.400 --> 31:36.920]  tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other.
[31:36.920 --> 31:42.160]  But we have cut right to the chase human liberty, a pro human future versus the globalist anti
[31:42.160 --> 31:43.160]  human future.
[31:43.160 --> 31:46.560]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that
[31:46.560 --> 31:48.880]  info wars really is your baby.
[31:48.880 --> 31:53.160]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to info wars

[33:22.360 --> 33:28.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Owen Troyer.
[33:28.080 --> 33:33.000]  All right, I'm going to get focused hammer these headlines, play some of these videos,
[33:33.000 --> 33:36.080]  and then dedicate the entire second hour to phone calls.
[33:36.080 --> 33:39.920]  So we're going to open up the phone lines probably in the next segment.
[33:39.920 --> 33:44.080]  I don't want to open up the phone lines now and then make me wait online to get on air.
[33:44.080 --> 33:52.080]  So let me hit these headlines, get some of these video clips, and then in the next segment,
[33:52.080 --> 33:56.000]  I'm just going to read every tweet from President Trump today.
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.720]  He's tweeted about 12 times.
[33:58.720 --> 34:04.800]  He's been up since, I guess, about six or five a.m. east coast tweeting on a Sunday.
[34:04.800 --> 34:10.960]  So I'm just going to read all those in a segment too, but let's just look at some of these
[34:10.960 --> 34:21.560]  headlines here domestically and let's kind of sift through them and try to make sense
[34:21.560 --> 34:22.560]  of it all.
[34:22.560 --> 34:31.480]  Again, what's incredible to me is, and see, I almost really can't even accurately talk
[34:31.480 --> 34:39.200]  about this because I'm so far removed from the hype that I don't even, it's like a foreign
[34:39.200 --> 34:41.080]  language almost to me.
[34:41.080 --> 34:46.280]  But there was just some movie came out, it was a Marvel movie, I think, I'm probably insulting
[34:46.280 --> 34:47.880]  people that actually are fans of it.
[34:47.880 --> 34:52.000]  I really genuinely forgot what it's called, but it said a bunch of box office records
[34:52.000 --> 34:53.600]  and there's all kinds of hype.
[34:53.600 --> 34:57.800]  Everybody goes and sees the movie and everybody talks about it for the next two weeks and
[34:57.800 --> 34:58.800]  that's the big thing.
[34:58.800 --> 35:00.880]  Okay, yeah, Aquaman is the new one.
[35:00.880 --> 35:02.280]  I'm talking about a movie from the summer.
[35:02.280 --> 35:05.880]  It was like Captain Marvel heroes or something.
[35:05.880 --> 35:08.200]  But now the new one's Aquaman is getting rave reviews.
[35:08.200 --> 35:14.520]  But my point is though, you get all this hype or a new Star Wars movie even, and I get it.
[35:14.520 --> 35:15.840]  I'm not insulting you if you like movies.
[35:15.840 --> 35:19.880]  The point is that or like a new TV show gets a bunch of hype and everybody talks about
[35:19.880 --> 35:20.880]  like Game of Thrones.
[35:20.880 --> 35:24.280]  All right, I'll use Game of Thrones, perfect example.
[35:24.280 --> 35:25.280]  Perfect example.
[35:25.280 --> 35:27.240]  I can't believe I didn't think of this until now.
[35:27.240 --> 35:32.240]  Game of Thrones, big TV show, I believe it's HBO.
[35:32.240 --> 35:33.240]  Everybody loves it.
[35:33.240 --> 35:34.240]  Everybody talks about it.
[35:34.240 --> 35:37.240]  It's like, if you don't watch Game of Thrones to the Game of Thrones people, you're like,
[35:37.240 --> 35:38.240]  what's wrong with you?
[35:38.240 --> 35:39.240]  Like, wow.
[35:39.240 --> 35:41.280]  So it's Game of Thrones.
[35:41.280 --> 35:44.280]  I've never watched it, so I really don't know the plot.
[35:44.280 --> 35:46.800]  But I can imagine Game of Thrones, I know enough about it.
[35:46.800 --> 35:51.520]  So I guess you've got like Kingdoms or whatever fighting for power and all, you know, right,
[35:51.520 --> 35:56.920]  the intrigue and the murder and the sex and everything that's involved.
[35:56.920 --> 36:05.120]  And it's all, and all of the focus is on the Game of Thrones, the TV show, all fake.
[36:05.120 --> 36:10.840]  When there's an actual real Game of Thrones happening right now in the real world.
[36:10.840 --> 36:12.080]  It's like the same thing.
[36:12.080 --> 36:19.280]  They put out a Captain Hero comic book movie about some civil war in the United States.
[36:19.280 --> 36:20.280]  It gets all the hype.
[36:20.280 --> 36:21.400]  It gets the box office records.
[36:21.400 --> 36:22.640]  Everybody talks about that.
[36:22.640 --> 36:28.240]  There's a real cold civil war happening right now in the United States, in the White House,
[36:28.240 --> 36:29.400]  in Washington, DC.
[36:29.400 --> 36:36.520]  That's real stuff with real world complications, with real world consequences.
[36:36.520 --> 36:38.440]  But notice how there's no attention on that.
[36:38.440 --> 36:40.360]  There's no focus on that.
[36:40.360 --> 36:46.800]  Everybody focuses on the big movie, the big TV show.
[36:46.800 --> 36:48.360]  Now what do you call that?
[36:48.360 --> 36:59.120]  Well, it's called distraction, bread and circus in the archaic analogy.
[36:59.120 --> 37:05.680]  So all of your attention and focus is on a basketball game or on a TV show or on a movie
[37:05.680 --> 37:10.880]  or something, and the media doesn't want you to actually see what's going on, the power
[37:10.880 --> 37:19.480]  struggle in DC, in the White House, worldwide even, globalism versus nationalism.
[37:19.480 --> 37:24.680]  And so then you have Saturday Night Live, and I didn't even mean to go to this, but
[37:24.680 --> 37:32.840]  I guess it's really the perfect time, that kind of likes to act like it's a joke and
[37:32.840 --> 37:40.920]  kind of distracts and acts like Trump is the bad guy, and it really doesn't matter.
[37:40.920 --> 37:46.200]  You tune in to any late night comedy show, they call it comedy, you know, I thought
[37:46.200 --> 37:56.480]  comedy was funny, and they're all bashing Trump, it's all the same propaganda.
[37:56.480 --> 38:01.480]  But again, the average American has no idea the real stuff that's going on behind the
[38:01.480 --> 38:02.480]  scenes.
[38:02.480 --> 38:10.360]  Like, look at these two stories here, in fact, look at these three stories.
[38:10.360 --> 38:19.040]  Report X Fox exec claims MH370 got hijacked by Oregon harvesters, that's from Sputnik,
[38:19.040 --> 38:21.000]  so they'll say it's fake news.
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.080]  Darlene Libleek Tipton, I'm probably pronouncing that wrong, but a former Fox TV executive
[38:27.080 --> 38:31.640]  announced that she has a hard drive containing proof that Malaysia Airlines flight MH370,
[38:31.640 --> 38:34.600]  which went missing four years ago, was actually hijacked in order to harvest the organs of
[38:34.600 --> 38:39.440]  the people on board.
[38:39.440 --> 38:41.680]  Whatever happened to that plane?
[38:41.680 --> 38:44.920]  Whatever happened to those people?
[38:44.920 --> 38:55.560]  I'm not saying that that's true or not, I'm saying wouldn't surprise me one bit.
[38:55.560 --> 39:02.400]  This is from years ago, three years ago, but Disney World, Legoland employees among 11
[39:02.400 --> 39:12.200]  arrested in undercover child porn sting, and the headline is at least three years ago,
[39:12.200 --> 39:13.200]  what was the number?
[39:13.200 --> 39:22.400]  Like 40 Disney employees have been arrested since 2006 for some charge involving pedophilia.
[39:22.400 --> 39:30.320]  That was a report from three years ago, that number has at least doubled.
[39:30.320 --> 39:37.360]  So just think about that, in 12 years you've had nearly 100 Disney employees, some of them
[39:37.360 --> 39:52.720]  with huge massive troughs of child pornography, and then you go and you look at all the videos
[39:52.720 --> 39:58.600]  people have done of all the weird subliminal messages in the Disney movies, I mean you
[39:58.600 --> 40:11.600]  want to take a red pill, you think that's a coincidence, missing Malaysian airline,
[40:11.600 --> 40:22.840]  Oregon harvesters, child sex trafficking, all of it more real than your favorite movie
[40:22.840 --> 40:35.280]  that came out this year, Aquaman, or Captain Marvel vs. DC Comics, but see that's the distraction.
[40:35.280 --> 40:41.800]  And then they make some huge joke of it on SNL, President Trump's bad, he's a buffoon,
[40:41.800 --> 40:46.600]  he's a Russian, he doesn't know what he's doing, just look at this, look at this guy,
[40:46.600 --> 40:53.600]  so here's SNL pretending like Trump was never president, go ahead and roll clip four.
[40:53.600 --> 41:04.600]  Oh it's Alec Baldwin, who just got caught in a second aggravated assault situation,
[41:04.600 --> 41:18.440]  I don't think I can do this anymore, I might finally eat a salad and explode, what seems
[41:18.440 --> 41:23.960]  to be the trouble Donald, who are you stay back, relax I mean you know harm, my name
[41:23.960 --> 41:29.600]  is Clarence and I was sent here from heaven, I heard you were in trouble, it's awful everything's
[41:29.600 --> 41:36.080]  falling apart, sometimes I wish I had never been president, a world where you were never
[41:36.080 --> 41:47.480]  president eh, I think we can arrange that, it's a wonderful Trump, yeah the economy would
[41:47.480 --> 41:52.360]  be down, it would be at war with Russia, what are those things on their faces, those are
[41:52.360 --> 41:58.440]  called smiles, hey Mr. Trump I just wanted to say Merry Christmas, if you go to a White
[41:58.440 --> 42:04.760]  House dinner it's nothing but smiles, nothing but cheers, I just wanted to thank you for
[42:04.760 --> 42:10.480]  suggesting I go into PR, I've made so much work money working for so many awesome companies
[42:10.480 --> 42:17.880]  like Facebook and Ashley Madison and the Romaine Lettuce Association, Merry Christmas Donald,
[42:17.880 --> 42:23.040]  wait Sarah isn't my press secretary, I told you Donald, you don't have a press secretary
[42:23.040 --> 42:28.160]  because you weren't elected president, and so it's this whole fantasy oh life would be
[42:28.160 --> 42:33.840]  so much better if it just wasn't for Trump, meanwhile it's the democrat cities and states
[42:33.840 --> 42:37.560]  that are totally hell holes, just look at California, it's the democrats that want open
[42:37.560 --> 42:41.120]  borders, it's the democrats that want to collapse the economy, it's the democrats that want
[42:41.120 --> 42:46.520]  to have DC in total shambles, but then they project all of it onto Trump, it's the democrats
[42:46.520 --> 42:50.720]  that colluded with Russia, they projected onto Trump, so this is what the media does
[42:50.720 --> 42:56.680]  to try to distract and disable you from being informed, and if you're uninformed then what
[42:56.680 --> 43:00.280]  do you do, you're just confused, whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish

[44:08.040 --> 44:12.280]  we had like info war store that just showed our products, but they just banned them all
[44:12.280 --> 44:17.080]  yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that
[44:17.080 --> 44:21.000]  loved us, your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.600]  the country and the world back from the brink, but the globalists now want to target where
[44:25.600 --> 44:31.360]  the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future, I want to be troublesome
[44:31.360 --> 44:36.400]  and pesky, I want to keep going, I want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy
[44:36.400 --> 44:41.080]  us financially, I want to push all the way, I've committed to do that, I've prayed for

[44:45.640 --> 44:50.920]  this, I will never falter, I will never waver at the spiritual level, I physically will,

[44:55.560 --> 44:59.120]  my absolute total commitment.
[44:59.120 --> 45:04.400]  Info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block,
[45:04.400 --> 45:09.560]  we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[45:09.560 --> 45:16.400]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[45:16.400 --> 45:22.240]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[45:22.240 --> 45:27.640]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses, they began studying this effect in published
[45:27.640 --> 45:33.800]  trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet
[45:33.800 --> 45:39.240]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, pollen block is natural and effective, it
[45:39.240 --> 45:44.400]  is not an antihistamine, in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking
[45:44.400 --> 45:49.800]  the activity of tryptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[45:49.800 --> 45:55.560]  in the body, go outside and enjoy the air you breathe, head to infowarslife.com and
[45:55.560 --> 45:59.200]  grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[45:59.200 --> 46:04.360]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now, Info
[46:04.360 --> 46:08.800]  Wards is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[46:08.800 --> 46:13.560]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate, people say why would you start
[46:13.560 --> 46:18.200]  a fight with them, because they were already dominating and running America into the ground
[46:18.200 --> 46:23.160]  and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this, so we've already had incredible success
[46:23.160 --> 46:28.160]  but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[46:28.160 --> 46:33.000]  why we've been made the main target and if you financially support us and if you spread
[46:33.000 --> 46:38.720]  the word about our articles and videos, infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against
[46:38.720 --> 46:41.720]  these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[46:41.720 --> 46:46.000]  We have huge sales at infowarsstore.com right now, and we're still able to operate, the
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.880]  shopping cart gets stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block
[46:48.880 --> 46:53.880]  our commerce and you're right to the market, but if you don't stand up and support us financially,
[46:53.880 --> 46:57.760]  Soros and the globe will spring win, this is Info Wards Darker Sour, we're your support,
[46:57.760 --> 47:02.480]  I'm counting on you.
[47:02.480 --> 47:16.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:16.960 --> 47:36.960]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[47:36.960 --> 47:39.160]  It's the Game of Thrones team, did you guys plan that?
[47:39.160 --> 47:43.280]  I'm serious, tell me, did you plan that?
[47:43.280 --> 47:46.800]  Always thinking on their toes, the real Game of Thrones is going on right now, let me get
[47:46.800 --> 47:47.800]  some of these headlines.
[47:47.800 --> 47:56.200]  Oh, by the way, I want to give a annual hello to Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy and the
[47:56.200 --> 48:01.120]  folks over at Media Matters who are always tuned in to write up some piece about us,
[48:01.120 --> 48:06.080]  slandering us, lying about us, libeling us, and trying to get us kicked off the air, so
[48:06.080 --> 48:10.040]  I just want to give a salute to all our friends at Media Matters, which by the way, I know
[48:10.040 --> 48:15.000]  you guys print up a transcript of all our live broadcasts, so I'm serious, if you could
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.600]  actually print me that, I would really appreciate that.
[48:18.600 --> 48:22.480]  So if you guys could just send us those transcripts over at Media Matters that you guys pay for
[48:22.480 --> 48:26.680]  all of our live broadcasts to have a transcript of, that sometimes you publish in the articles,
[48:26.680 --> 48:30.320]  you think it makes us look bad, it actually makes us look good, but if you could send
[48:30.320 --> 48:35.800]  those over our way, we'd really appreciate that, but I just want to say hi to Stelter,
[48:35.800 --> 48:40.400]  hi to Darcy, hi to our friends at Media Matters who I know are tuned in.
[48:40.400 --> 48:44.120]  Now, you have nothing better to do.
[48:44.120 --> 48:47.000]  Here is the real-life game of thrones.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.800]  This is from the AP Today.
[48:49.800 --> 48:53.680]  Scope of investigations into Trump has shaped his presidency.
[48:53.680 --> 49:01.800]  Well, this is kind of true, but it's a misnomer because basically it's handicapped President
[49:01.800 --> 49:02.800]  Trump.
[49:02.800 --> 49:10.160]  It's put a ball and chain on a marathon runner, on an Olympic sprinter, and then said, look
[49:10.160 --> 49:16.800]  at the Olympic sprinter struggling to finish his sprint as he's got two 12-pound ball and
[49:16.800 --> 49:18.520]  chains around his ankles.
[49:18.520 --> 49:21.760]  And they're like, what is wrong with the sprinter today?
[49:21.760 --> 49:23.160]  He is moving extra slow.
[49:23.160 --> 49:24.960]  It's like, well, what are you talking about?
[49:24.960 --> 49:27.880]  There's a ball and chain on his ankle, two of them even.
[49:27.880 --> 49:29.200]  Well, I don't see that.
[49:29.200 --> 49:30.760]  I don't think so.
[49:30.760 --> 49:31.920]  He's just moving really slow.
[49:31.920 --> 49:34.960]  And so that's what they are like, all these investigations, they're legit.
[49:34.960 --> 49:39.160]  I mean, this is just Trump has all this dirt, all these skeletons in his closet.
[49:39.160 --> 49:42.280]  They're just, these investigations, it's coming back to haunt him.
[49:42.280 --> 49:47.160]  No, it's a deep state coup, and it's all going to come out.
[49:47.160 --> 49:52.040]  Well, it already has come out, it's just that, you know, the media just won't report it.
[49:52.040 --> 49:55.840]  Trump's legal quandaries multiply, threaten to dominate rest of his term.
[49:55.840 --> 49:57.640]  Again, same bullcrap.
[49:57.640 --> 50:02.320]  So they launch all of these fake, fraudulent, illegal investigations, and then they say,
[50:02.320 --> 50:04.320]  uh-oh, look at Trump.
[50:04.320 --> 50:06.440]  He's being investigated now.
[50:06.440 --> 50:09.120]  Oh, this is it for Donald Trump.
[50:09.120 --> 50:10.120]  That's right.
[50:10.120 --> 50:12.200]  Mueller's on the, he's on the case.
[50:12.200 --> 50:15.040]  Let me ask you this.
[50:15.040 --> 50:18.040]  How many stories have you seen in the last, let's say, year?
[50:18.040 --> 50:21.600]  Hell, the last month, I've seen three.
[50:21.600 --> 50:24.560]  Mueller's getting ready for the final report.
[50:24.560 --> 50:29.200]  Mueller's last report about to be released, Mueller's final damning report is here to bring
[50:29.200 --> 50:30.200]  down Trump.
[50:30.200 --> 50:32.560]  That's just three in the last month.
[50:32.560 --> 50:35.040]  They've been saying that for a year.
[50:35.040 --> 50:37.160]  You know what it's called?
[50:37.160 --> 50:45.400]  It's called Tokyo Rose, acting like there's a victory for Mueller, acting like he's ready
[50:45.400 --> 50:48.680]  to claim victory and put Trump's head on a pike.
[50:48.680 --> 50:52.720]  Of course, all fake news, Mueller's team is being completely destroyed.
[50:52.720 --> 50:59.640]  Go and look, just look at all the people that were on Mueller's side or on Obama's side
[50:59.640 --> 51:03.160]  when this all started years ago, the illegal spying.
[51:03.160 --> 51:09.080]  They have all either been fired or resigned from their positions inside of DC.
[51:09.080 --> 51:15.040]  Over 10 people, and they're sitting here acting like Trump is the one who's going down when
[51:15.040 --> 51:19.720]  it's all the Mueller, Clinton Knights, Obamaites that are going down.
[51:19.720 --> 51:25.920]  This is what Tokyo Rose does, the Japanese broadcaster as they're literally being nuked
[51:25.920 --> 51:29.640]  to hell going on air saying the Japanese are winning.
[51:29.640 --> 51:31.960]  That's the deep state right now with Mueller.
[51:31.960 --> 51:36.240]  Totally getting hammered, totally getting exposed, and then what does the deep state
[51:36.240 --> 51:38.760]  corporate media say?
[51:38.760 --> 51:41.960]  Mueller preparing final report against President Trump.
[51:41.960 --> 51:43.760]  This is the big one.
[51:43.760 --> 51:45.280]  And then all the media runs with it.
[51:45.280 --> 51:46.640]  This is it for Trump.
[51:46.640 --> 51:49.480]  Mueller's finally got him.
[51:49.480 --> 51:55.320]  And then they drone on for about maybe 24 hours about that, and then something else happens
[51:55.320 --> 52:00.960]  and you've completely forgotten about the final Mueller report until next week when
[52:00.960 --> 52:04.840]  his next final report is coming up.
[52:04.840 --> 52:06.280]  But now Mueller wants to interview Trump.
[52:06.280 --> 52:07.280]  He always did.
[52:07.280 --> 52:10.840]  That's how you get anybody with entrapment.
[52:10.840 --> 52:14.280]  And Rudy Giuliani, in fact, guys, let's just roll clip six.
[52:14.280 --> 52:19.240]  Rudy Giuliani says over my dead body will Mueller interview Trump?
[52:19.240 --> 52:27.880]  Now that the special counsel is interested again in interviewing the president, has
[52:27.880 --> 52:32.960]  his office reached out to you about sitting down for an in-person interview with the president?
[52:32.960 --> 52:41.000]  Yes, there are several unpaid parking tickets back in 1986, 87 that haven't been explained.
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.000]  Seriously.
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  No, we've got it.
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  Seriously.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  Unpaid parking tickets.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  No, no, no.
[52:46.000 --> 52:47.000]  It was a movie theater.
[52:47.000 --> 52:48.000]  It was a proper thing.
[52:48.000 --> 52:49.000]  It was a special counsel.
[52:49.000 --> 52:50.000]  Does he want to interview the president?
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  Yeah, good luck.
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.000]  Good luck.
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.440]  You have to, what they did to Flynn, the way they trapped him into perjury, and no sentence
[52:55.440 --> 53:00.800]  form, 14 days for Papadopoulos, I did better on traffic violations than they did with Papadopoulos.
[53:00.800 --> 53:03.600]  So when you say good luck, you're saying no way, no interview.
[53:03.600 --> 53:08.640]  They're a joke over my dead body, but you know, I could be dead.
[53:08.640 --> 53:11.240]  Have they, have they, do they want to speak to the president?
[53:11.240 --> 53:15.720]  I do have other, I am disgusted with the tactics they have used in this case.
[53:15.720 --> 53:20.200]  What they did to General Flynn should be a result in discipline.
[53:20.200 --> 53:28.720]  Just kind of hear Giuliani almost realizing how cryptic that was for a second when he
[53:28.720 --> 53:34.760]  said over my dead body, like, yeah, he's like, actually they might kill me.
[53:34.760 --> 53:36.480]  He knows who's he dealing with.
[53:36.480 --> 53:39.920]  You'd dealt with these people.
[53:39.920 --> 53:43.200]  But why would President Trump sit down for an interview with Mueller?
[53:43.200 --> 53:48.760]  Even if it was going to be live on TV, it's all entrapment, folks.
[53:48.760 --> 53:51.240]  All of it is entrapment.
[53:51.240 --> 53:56.160]  Trump's interior chief to step down his pressure mount from ethics inquiries again.
[53:56.160 --> 53:58.320]  Say what you want about these inquiries and Zinke.
[53:58.320 --> 54:02.040]  The point here shows the double standard.
[54:02.040 --> 54:07.400]  How come, because they're all, he's all benefits, pay for play and all this crap.
[54:07.400 --> 54:13.720]  I mean, Andrew Gillum was guilty and caught of 10 times what they're claiming Zinke, Zinke's
[54:13.720 --> 54:18.460]  doing, and the Democrats just lauded this guy as a hero two months ago.
[54:18.460 --> 54:21.720]  So again, it just shows you, if you're a Democrat, you can get away with anything.
[54:21.720 --> 54:24.600]  But it's all about media control.
[54:24.600 --> 54:28.120]  Just see, that's what people need to understand.
[54:28.120 --> 54:32.200]  Because of the rhetoric, it seems like you're sitting here playing politics, left, right,
[54:32.200 --> 54:35.160]  paradigm, Republican, Democrat, bash heads all day long.
[54:35.160 --> 54:36.160]  No, no, no.
[54:36.160 --> 54:40.520]  You have to understand how corporate media works.
[54:40.520 --> 54:45.720]  In today's day and age, right now at least, I'm no Republican, the corporate media and
[54:45.720 --> 54:49.280]  the Democrat Party work together to destroy America.
[54:49.280 --> 54:50.600]  That's what's going on right now.
[54:50.600 --> 54:53.440]  Again, I'm not a Republican.
[54:53.440 --> 54:56.800]  I'm not here to line eyes of the Republican Party or tell you to vote Republican.
[54:56.800 --> 55:02.560]  I'm telling you that the corporate media in this country, which most Americans that are
[55:02.560 --> 55:07.760]  uninformed go to for information, protect the Democrat Party.
[55:07.760 --> 55:11.320]  But as soon as there's a nationalist or a guy with an R behind his name that has an
[55:11.320 --> 55:14.800]  ethics inquiry, then all of a sudden it's a big story and he has to step down and the
[55:14.800 --> 55:16.920]  entire media landscape celebrates it.
[55:16.920 --> 55:22.280]  But if you're Diane Feinstein with a spy under your employee from China for 20 years, you're
[55:22.280 --> 55:24.200]  all good.
[55:24.200 --> 55:30.080]  If you're Eric Holder held in contempt in court, the first AG in the history of the United
[55:30.080 --> 55:33.240]  States to be held in contempt of court, you're all good.
[55:33.240 --> 55:38.560]  If you're Andrew Gillum with all the ethics violations or you're Maxine Waters with multiple
[55:38.560 --> 55:43.880]  ethics and violations or you're Bill de Blasio with your biggest assistant, the next John
[55:43.880 --> 55:51.160]  Podesta caught with all child poor on his computer, you're fine.
[55:51.160 --> 55:56.680]  That's the collusion between the Democrats and the media all exposed in the WikiLeaks.
[55:56.680 --> 56:00.680]  Mick Mulvaney to replace John Kelly as acting chief of staff.
[56:00.680 --> 56:03.800]  Right now it's acting.
[56:03.800 --> 56:10.080]  I'm hearing that this is going to become permanent and Trump seems to be very excited about Mulvaney.
[56:10.080 --> 56:11.880]  Pelosi gets her swagger on.
[56:11.880 --> 56:15.040]  Boy, I had to have a laugh at this one.
[56:15.040 --> 56:17.680]  This is so ridiculous from the hill.
[56:17.680 --> 56:20.160]  She's got her swag back.
[56:20.160 --> 56:25.200]  She baited President Trump into taking the blame for potential government shutdown.
[56:25.200 --> 56:26.440]  No.
[56:26.440 --> 56:32.480]  Trump baited her into acting like it was the negative side to take the side of shutting
[56:32.480 --> 56:35.600]  the government down when actually most people probably would want the government shutdown
[56:35.600 --> 56:37.120]  surprisingly.
[56:37.120 --> 56:42.720]  The image of Pelosi strutting out of the White House meeting in a red wool jacket quickly
[56:42.720 --> 56:49.640]  went viral and prompted the co-designer to bring back the discontinued piece.
[56:49.640 --> 56:55.320]  No one is buying a jacket because it was worn by Nancy Pelosi.
[56:55.320 --> 56:58.080]  You notice how nobody knew about that?
[56:58.080 --> 57:02.680]  Melania Trump wore a jacket that said I don't care on the back of it and it literally sold
[57:02.680 --> 57:04.520]  like a million jackets.
[57:04.520 --> 57:07.080]  They sold out. Nancy Pelosi wears a red jacket.
[57:07.080 --> 57:08.080]  They bring it back.
[57:08.080 --> 57:09.960]  Nobody even knows what it is.
[57:09.960 --> 57:12.040]  But she's got her swagger on.
[57:12.040 --> 57:15.520]  This woman, I almost feel bad.
[57:15.520 --> 57:24.760]  I mean, if she wasn't such a corrupt lying thief, I maybe would have a little more empathy
[57:24.760 --> 57:25.880]  for Nancy Pelosi.
[57:25.880 --> 57:31.960]  But this is a woman that has serious mental deficiencies.
[57:31.960 --> 57:36.560]  This is an older woman, maybe had an alcohol issue, and that's why her brain isn't working.
[57:36.560 --> 57:41.520]  Maybe it's just old age, but folks, she is totally mentally deranged.
[57:41.520 --> 57:43.200]  And this is the speaker of the House for the Democrats.
[57:43.200 --> 57:46.520]  I mean, get ready for some fireworks and some fun.
[57:46.520 --> 57:53.480]  In the last few months, you have seen info wars offer the biggest sales in our history.
[57:53.480 --> 57:56.920]  Now we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling
[57:56.920 --> 57:57.920]  items in.
[57:57.920 --> 58:01.800]  That's why I am extending the 12 Days of Christmas for four more days because we're
[58:01.800 --> 58:05.720]  guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United
[58:05.720 --> 58:08.560]  States before Christmas at info wars store.com.
[58:08.560 --> 58:09.800]  But get your orders in.
[58:09.800 --> 58:12.400]  Don't fight those crowds and support the info war.
[58:12.400 --> 58:17.200]  All the sales the last 12 days, 50 to 75% off is back.
[58:17.200 --> 58:18.360]  Free shipping is still there.
[58:18.360 --> 58:19.360]  Double Patriot points.
[58:19.360 --> 58:25.840]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items, vitamin mineral fusion, micro ZX, the
[58:25.840 --> 58:27.480]  t-shirts, all of it.
[58:27.480 --> 58:28.920]  Just go check out the sales.
[58:28.920 --> 58:30.640]  There's too many to break them all down.
[58:30.640 --> 58:31.920]  Get your orders in by the 19th.
[58:31.920 --> 58:34.720]  You're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[58:34.720 --> 58:36.720]  And thank you again all for your support.
[58:36.720 --> 58:41.240]  We're extending the sale until the 19th, but info wars is in your hands.
[58:41.240 --> 58:44.280]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about info wars.com.
[58:44.280 --> 58:45.920]  And we're going to beat the globalists together.
[58:45.920 --> 58:46.920]  Thank you.
[58:46.920 --> 58:54.400]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important info wars is in the fight against
[58:54.400 --> 58:55.400]  the anti-human globalist.
[58:55.400 --> 59:00.400]  So let's say a short and sweet, we are your support now more than ever.
[59:00.400 --> 59:03.120]  You've come through a thousand times since I'm not bitching at you.
[59:03.120 --> 59:06.240]  I'm just simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now.
[59:06.240 --> 59:11.200]  The attacks on info wars have become absolutely exponential and down the road, we probably
[59:11.200 --> 59:12.200]  will get destroyed.
[59:12.200 --> 59:16.600]  But I know and God has really put it on my heart that we've got to maintain the fight
[59:16.600 --> 59:22.160]  as hard as possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry
[59:22.160 --> 59:25.200]  out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[59:25.200 --> 59:26.960]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[59:26.960 --> 59:30.800]  I need to be provisioned and I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Roth
[59:30.800 --> 59:34.440]  Childs and all these devil worshipers, but I need your prayers, I need you to spread
[59:34.440 --> 59:35.440]  the articles and videos.
[59:35.440 --> 59:37.440]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[59:37.440 --> 59:38.440]  We make it easy.
[59:38.440 --> 59:43.440]  Do your Christmas shopping with us, not with the globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon
[59:43.440 --> 59:44.960]  and you'll help provision us.
[59:44.960 --> 59:47.960]  We've got a bunch of huge deals in info wars.com.
[59:47.960 --> 01:00:14.960]  So please take action right now.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:36.120]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is just total madness coming from the Democrat Party
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.120]  right now.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:42.600]  I mean, you got to wonder what these people are on and where you can get some for a good
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.600]  time.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:50.000]  Listen to what Democrat Senator Jeff Merkley said on CNN, why he doesn't like a border
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  wall.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.440]  Yeah, border security, including fencing, is I've been down on the border.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.440]  I've seen the fencing.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440]  You can see through it.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.520]  In fact, the border guard itself says a concrete wall is an absolute mistake.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.000]  They say the border guard needs to be able to see what's going on on the other side,
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.640]  that the wall doesn't stop any bad things from happening.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.960]  It just makes it impossible for the folks on our side to see what's developing and makes
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.520]  it more difficult for them.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:19.520]  So we're not going to fund a 4th century strategy easily defeated that makes life more
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.160]  difficult for security.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.720]  So here's a president who's claiming he wants a wall for security, but it does the opposite.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.120]  Why should we fund that?
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:31.280]  That makes no sense at all, and we're not going to do it.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:36.680]  You know, I had a realization about faux progressivism that I wish I had the time in the segment
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.600]  to explain to Mr. Merkley here, but did you hear that, folks?
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.560]  We got to be able to see what's on the other side of the wall.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.360]  So like this idea is just no good.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.680]  So just toss this idea out the window.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:50.160]  We got we I can't see what's on the other wall on this on the other side.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.320]  It's not like there's a camera that I could use to do that, you know, but so we just got
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.320]  to throw there.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:00.500]  There's a 4th century thing, you know, but that's so ridiculous.
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.840]  But here is a fake Bito O'Rourke.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.000]  Oh, this one's even more rich.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.720]  Listen to why Bito doesn't want the wall.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:16.320]  The number of people dying at the U.S.-Mexico border dying in some years has grown and in
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:23.800]  some years has grown because it's connected to that wall that pushes people who are at
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.880]  their most desperate and vulnerable.
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:32.280]  The wall is now pushing in hospitable stretches of the Chihuahuan Desert, trying to come here
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:37.200]  for safety or to join their family or to work a job that they were called to that they can
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.120]  feed their family from you call them.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.520]  Let me read you some numbers.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:51.880]  This is never part of the conversation about walls and security, and it must be going forward.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:03:01.000]  In the year 1998, 263 human beings died on the U.S. side of the U.S.-Mexico border trying
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.640]  to cross into this country.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.640]  Yeah.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.640]  Okay.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.640]  So don't come here.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.640]  What's the risk they took?
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.640]  365.
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:15.720]  The wall in this area was built in 2006, 2007, and 2008.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:21.920]  So even though total crossing attempts had decreased, number of deaths went up.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.120]  Yeah, because we want to keep people out.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.160]  The wall's not killing anybody.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.360]  They're coming on a journey that ends up killing them.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.400]  I mean, it's sad.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.000]  I don't want anybody to die.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.560]  But it's not exactly a good idea to travel thousands of miles to a country that's not
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.560]  going to let you in.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:48.960]  But here's one last one, another one, listen, I mean, these people are insane.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.720]  Listen to clip 10 from MSNBC.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:58.360]  This is an ongoing problem with this administration, is that they continue to pivot in the irresponsible
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.480]  way in which they have been treating migrants.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.920]  This is a Democrat from California.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.920]  They murdered this child.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.920]  Murdered her.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.920]  They did that.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:16.840]  They murdered the 18-month-old little girl that died a few days after they released her
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.320]  back in June.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.680]  And they murdered many other children and they're separating families.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.360]  They must be held accountable.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:31.440]  The dehydration, severe dehydration like this cannot be dealt with, both just water and
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.440]  water.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:37.120]  And yet they are out there destroying the water supplies that Good Samaritans put out
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:44.640]  there for people who find themselves in these situations.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:51.040]  I mean, look, if I have to combat that, if I have to intellectually try to discuss and
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.880]  debate that, I mean, that is just idiocy.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:02.000]  In the last few months, Info Wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.600]  of many of our best-selling items.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.880]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale of free shipping
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.160]  store-wide, 50 to 75% off double-patriot points.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:16.320]  Let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.400]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified super blue, you'll
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:25.120]  get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.320]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.320]  out.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:33.280]  So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.280]  sells out.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.600]  And then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:41.920]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.440]  So this is a loss leader.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.080]  We are losing money on this.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.520]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.480]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.800]  And don't fight the crowds.
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:54.880]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or triple-eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:06:24.840]  God bless you and thank you for your support.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:44.400]  And just you wait until the 116th Congress is sworn in that will feature Nancy Pelosi
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.320]  as Speaker of the House.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:57.160]  Alexander Cortez is going to be out there, boy, that is going to be fun.
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:04.120]  But here's what I'm going to say about the Democrats and their border wall and this whole
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:14.120]  notion that it's progressive to not want borders or it's progressive to, you know, just have
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.840]  an open border policy, or if you really want to go to the hippie-dippy stuff, you know,
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:19.960]  there are no borders.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:24.560]  It's just a man-made line, bro, like it's all fake stuff, man.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.560]  There's not really a border.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.560]  I'm a human.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.560]  You can't tell me where I can walk on earth, man.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.840]  It's a free world.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.880]  It's progressive.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:43.840]  So there's this weird notion that that thought is somehow original and progressive.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:49.440]  Like you're the first genius to realize that there's not an actual line at the border.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:54.400]  Like whoa, dude, you're so smart, but that's what they actually think.
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.400]  And these progressives actually think that it's progressive to have open borders, progressive
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:02.640]  to realize that there's not an actual line in the dirt, progressive to realize that it's
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.640]  yeah, a man-made concept to have a country in a border.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.920]  Yes, you're right.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.880]  Yes, that's all man-made, exactly.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:16.560]  And so there's this notion, this thought that it's original and progressive to go against
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:22.440]  that, when that is actually regressive.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:30.080]  You think you're the first hippie to realize there's no actual line at the border.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:36.520]  Do you think you're the first liberal progressive to realize that a country and a border is
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.200]  a man-made concept?
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:41.680]  Wow, you really think you're that smart, don't you?
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:46.000]  You really think that you're that original?
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.320]  No, my friends.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.400]  People realize that a long time ago.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:59.360]  And you know what happened when they tried to progress with that concept in the modern
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:06.000]  age, they realized that's not so progressive after all.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.200]  And we need to have borders and we need to have sovereignty and we need to have laws
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:24.040]  because man is crazy and man is desperate and they will invade your country and destroy
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:31.840]  your sovereignty and destroy your prosperity if you don't protect it and having a border
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.360]  is one of the foundations.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:41.800]  And so all of these arrogant, full of, you know what, fake liberals that are not liberals
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:48.240]  but leftists, they think they're so smart because they smoked a joint and ate a mushroom
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:52.480]  and thought, whoa man, borders are fake.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480]  I'm so progressive.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.480]  I'm in Silicon Valley.
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:59.720]  I got my designer drugs, a border is just a man-made concept, man.
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:00.720]  You can't tell a human.
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:03.960]  He can't walk on this land.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.600]  That's so regressive.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:10.760]  That's so archaic that they don't even realize it, but it's their own arrogance.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:15.760]  They get high off of their own fart and they think they're so progressive and so original
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.120]  that that thought's never been had before.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:22.600]  No, we've already been down that road.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:28.040]  We've already done that experiment and you know what we found?
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.320]  It didn't work.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:37.200]  So we built walls and we created countries and then we found the West and created self-government
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:44.280]  and self-reliance and the only way to protect that was to have a border and national sovereignty.
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:49.920]  But now all these airhead leftists come around and they think they're God's gift to earth
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:57.520]  because a border is not progressive, man, when it actually is progressive.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:03.320]  It's one of the first progressions of civilization.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:12.800]  So modern-day progressives are the most regressive people on earth, but I think I've pontificated
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.600]  enough on that.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:33.440]  Let's go ahead and open up the phone lines, 1-877-789-ALIX, 1-877-789-2539.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:38.840]  And I'll just say as a topic of discussion, where do you think we're at right now when
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:44.440]  I'm talking about the Civil War going on inside the White House, the Cold Civil War and the
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:48.680]  battle between globalism and nationalism, or we'll do an open line type of thing and
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.800]  you can call and talk about anything.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:12:01.600]  So opening up the phone lines now, 1-877-789-ALIX, but again it's the same thing where the left
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:07.400]  and the quote-unquote progressives get in charge of all these schools and the colleges
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:12.640]  and the high schools and the public education and what happens, IQ goes down, quality of
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.280]  education goes down.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:20.400]  Education goes down, and now just roll the B roll, clip five guys, millennials lacking
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:26.600]  life skills are now signing up for classes designed to teach them the basics.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:31.080]  You know, it's cooking, cleaning, and it's true, most people just have no idea.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.040]  You just use the iPhone, you order from Amazon.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:39.680]  I remember though, I was in downtown St. Louis some years ago and my friend caught a flat
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.680]  tire.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:46.120]  I believe I was in high school at the time and none of us knew how to fix the flat.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.000]  And like we're out there stranded, right, until you wait for help and it's like that
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.840]  should be something you know how to do.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:54.680]  Now I ended up after that learning the hard way and I had to fix a flat since then, but
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.640]  it was funny because we're all standing there and we're not, we're in a kind of seedy area
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:03.560]  of St. Louis and some guy comes up and this is actually a homeless individual just walking
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:08.640]  by in St. Louis to tell you a lot about some type of people you wouldn't expect.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.640]  He comes up, literally fixes the whole flat tire, gets the jack out of the car, jacks
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:18.680]  it up, fixes it, gets the, I mean like in five minutes and is like, hey, you know, a little
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.680]  something for that.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.400]  We gave him like 50 bucks or something quicker than the towing company, smarter than all
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.960]  of us when it comes to fixing the tire.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:32.240]  So again, but that's the progressive education system that doesn't teach you any basic survival
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.240]  instincts.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:37.440]  It teaches you how to racially identify people and politically identify people obsessed with
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:44.320]  identity politics, obsessed with all this fake history that just points out who's a victim
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.600]  and who's the oppressor.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.800]  So now you got all of these warped minds that can't even figure out what the hell's going
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:57.200]  on in the world anymore, totally just diluted with garbage, diluted with the crap entertainment
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:01.600]  industry, diluted with the garbage on television, diluted with the garbage in schools, diluted
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:07.480]  with the fake left progressive agenda, and then they can't cook a meal.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.880]  They don't know how to pay taxes, they don't know how to fix a car.
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.400]  And believe me, I'm not sitting here bragging like I'm some example of this, I'm part of
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.400]  this generation.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.040]  But I mean, compared to the average FOP out there that probably couldn't even turn on
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.080]  a grill without burning themselves.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.160]  So that's this funny thing out there.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:33.160]  I'm not sure where this was from KDKA, Millennials Are Lacking Life Skills.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:38.160]  And then there's just some crazy stat about people my age being out of shape, some other
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:43.040]  crazy stat about some percentage of the United States population that doesn't even do a minute
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.040]  of exercise every day.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:48.480]  So that's what's going on there.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:51.400]  All right, so I'm going to take phone calls when we come back.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:55.680]  In this short break, please go to InfowarsStore.com and take advantage of huge Christmas specials.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:01.360]  You still have two days to order from InfowarsStore.com and get your gifts for Christmas.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:07.000]  So if you order before December 18th, we guarantee to be shipped by Christmas Eve.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  Huge specials right now.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  I got to say it.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.600]  Look, again, Santa likes to bring gifts for the family.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.200]  And those are gifts that the whole family benefits from and that's good for the house.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.120]  I think Santa right now, this is a message to Santa.

[01:19:49.920 --> 01:20:06.000]  The Real Red Pill Plus at InfowarsStores.com You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:16.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:44.920]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:21:10.400]  With
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:18.080]  are not news networks. These are not entertainment shows. These are Democrat globalist propaganda
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:20.080]  wings.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:26.720]  So where are all the missing texts between fired FBI agents Peter Stroke and the lovely
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:32.200]  Lisa Page, his lover, just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean? What an
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:38.360]  outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted witch hunt moves ever so slowly forward. Want
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.360]  them?
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:48.120]  Oh, no. If you understand how Trump parallel constructs his counterattacks against the
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:53.880]  deep state as I reported last week, they already have these texts. So Trump is now letting
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:22:00.000]  you know he knows that Mueller erased these texts, total destruction of justice, and he
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:07.360]  wants those texts, but of course, he already has them.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:11.800]  Where Michael Cohen only became a rat after the FBI did something which was absolutely
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:15.800]  unthinkable and unheard of until the witch hunt was illegally started. They broke into
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:20.320]  an attorney's office. Why didn't they break into the DNC to get the server or crooked
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.040]  Hillary's office?
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:29.640]  So this is just along the same lines where Michael Cohen decided to lay in bed with
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:33.600]  the globalist and the deep state and Mueller and Obama and Clinton, putting his faith in
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:40.200]  them to give him the easiest ride in this cold civil war, instead of putting his chips
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:45.320]  in Trump's corner and his chips in America's corner like Flynn did, like Manafort did,
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:51.640]  like Corsi did, like Stone did, like Alex Jones did. So Mueller just became a cuck basically.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:54.800]  He's a cuck, a rat cuck.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:23:00.200]  At the request of many, I will be reviewing the case of a US military hero, Major Matt
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:06.480]  Goldstein, who is charged with murder. He could face the death penalty from our own
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:10.480]  government after he admitted to killing a terrorist bomb maker while overseas.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.360]  You know, I'm not sure if this is the same story that I was following because I forgot
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:19.640]  the gentleman's name, but guys, when you look up, there was a Navy veteran who, I believe
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:27.280]  it was Navy, who had the same thing happen to him and his house had a raid on it where
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:33.240]  they took his kids and wife out of the home. His kids were in their underwear in a no-knock
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:40.880]  raid, but that was a Navy individual. Same story. He shot and killed a terrorist over
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:45.320]  there, but then they're questioning the legitimacy of that kill.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.560]  And now they're trying to destroy his life and put him behind bars, but I think that's
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.880]  a different guy than what Trump was tweeting about. I'm sorry, I just got handed these
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:55.520]  tweets. I didn't do my due diligence on that, but there's that. All right, here's another
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:59.720]  one. Judge Ken Starr, former Solicitor General
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:04.080]  and Independent Counsel, just stated that after two years, there is no evidence or proof
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:09.760]  of collusion. And further, that there is no evidence that there was a campaign financing
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:15.040]  violation involving the president. Thank you, Judge Ken Starr, again from President Trump
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:19.840]  on Twitter. But you just have to go back and learn how
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:24.920]  this whole thing began to see that it was fraudulent from the beginning. It was the
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:32.040]  excuse they did in hindsight to the illegal spying on the Trump campaign.
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:38.200]  And then you even have the undercover tapes from a Van Jones, a big Democrat strategist
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:43.640]  operative on CNN saying, yeah, Russian inclusion is fake news. We know it's fake news. We do
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:49.160]  it for ratings and to destroy Trump. Those are Van Jones words, not mine. And I like
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.560]  Van Jones. It's politics are crazy, but he's a good guy.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:57.640]  Donald Trump, the Democrats policy of child separation on the border during the Obama
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:02.600]  administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. Remember the 2014 picture
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:06.400]  of children and cages, the Obama years. However, if you don't separate far more people will
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:14.320]  come, smugglers use the kids. And then they use what happens to all these thousands, tens
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.600]  of thousands, hundreds of thousands of millions of people, and they pick the worst cases,
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:20.840]  which is their fault. They're the ones that choose to come on this journey. There's old
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:25.960]  stories, people go on Ellis Island and dying. I mean, so it's not good, but it's been going
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:30.360]  on for years. And then they just take all of it and then they somehow put it on Trump
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:36.720]  as if it's his fault. But again, it shows you the power of the media to take a picture
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:43.080]  from 2014 and then even use that to destroy Trump. And they will never blame Obama for
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:46.360]  anything that happened during the Obama years. So it's like anything bad that happened during
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:50.000]  the Obama years is somehow Trump's fault. And anything good that happens in the Trump
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:59.680]  years is Obama's fault. Isn't that just classic? But again, that's the power of the media.
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:05.560]  Now here's the big one. The Russian witch hunt hoax started as the insurance policy long
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:09.560]  before I even got elected is very bad for our country. You have the insurance policy
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:15.120]  against their illegal spying, ladies and gentlemen, total criminal acts of treason. They are
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:19.960]  entrapping people for misstatements, lies or unrelated things that took place many years
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:27.920]  ago. Nothing to do with collusion, a Democrat scam. A persecution of the president says
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:32.080]  Daniel Henninger of the Wall Street Journal. Thank you. People are starting to see and
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:35.560]  understand what this witch hunt is all about. Jeff Sessions should be ashamed of himself
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:42.600]  for allowing his total hoax to get started in the first place. Again, quoting from that
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:48.120]  story, it looks here as though General Flynn's offenses are incidental to something larger,
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:53.120]  which is for the prosecution to figure out if it can find a path to Donald Trump without
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:58.360]  quite knowing what the crime might be. It stops looking like a prosecution and looking
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:09.280]  more like a prosecution, a persecution of the president. So that is just President Trump
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:16.760]  on Twitter today. But of course, that's what it was. That was it from the very beginning.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:22.320]  Show me the man and I'll find the crime. And Bob Mueller, ladies and gentlemen, you look
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:27.560]  at the crimes that that guy has been involved with covering up over at the FBI. I mean,
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:35.240]  my God. Think what you want about what happened on 9-11. Mueller was at the FBI. Think about
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:40.480]  what you want about Jeffrey Epstein, Pedophile Island and the deals that they reached for
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:46.640]  him to basically get no punishment. You know, who's at the FBI when that was all going on?
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:53.400]  Bob Mueller. How about that Hillary Clinton, Russian uranium one deal? Who oversaw that?
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:28:04.080]  Who got that deal done? Russian collusion? That's Bob Mueller. The deep state mule. The
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:11.320]  deep state cover up boy. The president now of the deep state, the leader of the deep
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:22.760]  state, the total criminal scumbag out to get President Trump.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:27.240]  So when we come back, we've got the phone lines working. So I'm going to go to your
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:37.600]  phone call folks when we come back. What a time to be alive. A new age for humanity awaits.
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:45.320]  Will it be freedom, prosperity, or will it be oppression and slavery? The choice is ours.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:29:00.640]  But only if we choose to make it, not have someone else make it for us. We'll be right
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.800]  back. Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful

[01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:02.640]  Everybody knows that history documents it, but there is a cult in every culture and every
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:07.160]  system throughout history that wants to hurt children. They want to abort children, they
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:11.680]  want to disease children, they want to abuse children, they want to confuse children, they
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:16.800]  want their essence, they want their soul, they want their spirit, they want their power
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:21.800]  because they are our future. And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, that
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:26.520]  ultimate sacrifice. It is about the West. It is about a human future and standing with
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:30.600]  each other and believing in a better future. So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:35.120]  But I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:41.280]  for President Trump, to pray for InfoWars and to remember that you have the power to
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.840]  change the world. You have the power to override the sensors. You have the power to stop the
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:49.920]  globalists dead in their tracks. I know you've been taking action, I salute you, but just
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:54.720]  remember, I know you're humble, but just remember you hold the future of this planet
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:57.480]  and the universe in your hands.
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:02.840]  InfoWars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:07.800]  economy, the eugenics, operations, the whole thing. We've been proven dead on. You've
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.360]  been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project. You've been the men and
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:18.160]  women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you. All words are not enough.
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:22.080]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:27.760]  that you have been on target, promoting Americana and Renaissance and open free society against
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:32.320]  the globalists and the dominant world force. They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:36.520]  of people that can't communicate with each other, but we have cut right to the chase.
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:41.200]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future. And that's why
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:44.920]  I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that InfoWars really
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:49.760]  is your baby. I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:53.480]  you to go to infowarsstore.com and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:57.080]  deals ever and funding InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:02.480]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:07.640]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:14.480]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:20.360]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:25.760]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:31.120]  trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:35.000]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.160]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:45.000]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.080]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:54.480]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:33:01.480]  our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:31.480]  It shows how ridiculous our modern culture is.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:34:00.640]  It just shows you how far we've come, how far we've fallen really and how corrupt our
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:07.080]  own priorities are and our own thought process are that we'll do anything, people in this
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:11.480]  country will do anything to stop a nativity scene from being on public property because
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:18.160]  they don't want Jesus to be affiliated with the government, but they'll openly push for
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:25.600]  Planned Parenthood funding. You see what I'm saying here? And most people will hear me
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:28.280]  say that and say, what's wrong with that, Troyer? What are you complaining about? Of
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:32.720]  course, yeah, you fund Planned Parenthood. You don't put Jesus Christ on an activity
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:38.840]  scene out in public. What's wrong with you? Well, what's wrong with me is that my priority
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:45.680]  is to not fund abortion. See? And then if you want to have some debate because you don't
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:50.160]  like a nativity scene on public property, that's fine. But you know what? That nativity
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:58.520]  scene ain't killing nobody. Planned Parenthood is killing millions with your money. So it's
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:02.640]  like, protect Planned Parenthood at every cost. You're bad if you say anything negative
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:08.560]  about Planned Parenthood. Oh, but that nativity scene must be removed. Do you see how basque
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:18.720]  words that is? Do you see how insane we've become here? That is nuts. But I'm going to
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:23.960]  stop right there and start taking phone calls. Let's go to David in New York who has an interesting
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:28.720]  topic here. Go ahead, David. Good evening, Owen. How you doing?
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:34.240]  Doing just fine. Yeah. Now, actually, what you just described is part of my point that
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:40.920]  I talked to before with your person there. My concern about the Mueller investigation
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:48.200]  and the whole system of communication that communicates to the public, the news media,
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:56.000]  and such like, is it could be one big giant sigh to break down our psyche so that we hear
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.560]  the ridiculous legal arguments. There's nothing to this case. It's so ridiculous that the
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:08.400]  common person with a simple understanding of what is right and wrong could see that
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:13.320]  there's nothing there. And they just keep beating us down. And I think my concern is
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:17.640]  Owen, and I want to hear your point on this. Is this designed just to break us down, make
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:21.120]  us complicit, non-resistant conformance to their...
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:25.600]  Well, let me ask you a question because it'll be easier for me to answer just based on where
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:30.720]  you're coming from. Are you insinuating that Trump is part of this sigh-up or no?
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.200]  I should have made that clear because I told your screener that I am a Trump supporter
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:38.680]  and I proudly still have his sign that I had in my home here at Little Falls, New York,
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:42.600]  right down in the cellar. And I'll break it out again in 2020. But I think that he's
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:49.080]  limited because he could be even. And again, I don't think on his own, but he could have
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:54.600]  gotten into a system and realized how big this thing is. He can't even fight it.
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:37:00.160]  Well, there's no doubt. I mean, this is not a knock on Trump. I would imagine anybody,
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:05.160]  you become president, you learn a lot of things that you couldn't even have imagined. But
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:08.960]  I remember when it all first started to say, the only option here, the only... Basically,
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:13.920]  you want to boil Trump down to a binary. You say either he's the greatest thing to happen
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.280]  in America's modern history or it is all a sigh-up and he's controlled opposition just
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:23.160]  like many other Republicans before him. However, having to understand that, weigh that and
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:28.440]  measure that, you look at the media response, you look at the desperation from the Democrats,
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:32.800]  you look at globalism failing worldwide and you realize that, no, this is the real deal.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:38.000]  Trump is the real deal. Now, there's a frustration because he goes on Twitter and is great on
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.360]  Twitter, but where's the action? Where's the shutdown of the Mueller probe? Where's the
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:46.160]  arrest of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama? Where is the shutdown of the southern border?
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:52.560]  So there is frustration there. But then you have to wait and say, okay, is Trump waiting
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:56.000]  to do this? Is he going to drop the hammer on these people? Well, really, we only are
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:01.200]  going to find out when he's out of office. But as far as the question is concerned, David,
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:07.000]  110% it's a sigh-up because just look at what it's done. I did the whole segment, I think
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.200]  first segment this hour, showing all the news stories, talking about it's been for two years.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:18.320]  Trump's presidency is in trouble. Mueller getting ready to drop the hammer. It's all a sigh-up.
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:22.600]  It's a sigh-up to destroy President Trump. It's a sigh-up to keep this country divided.
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:26.040]  It's a sigh-up to act like everything Trump is doing, which is helping the country, is
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:30.040]  not actually helping the country. It's a sigh-up to act like Trump is unpopular, even though
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:34.480]  if they treated him fairly, he'd be the most popular president in US history. So it is
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:42.600]  definitely 100% a sigh-up. And my truly evaluated, weighed opinion, Trump is not involved in
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:46.240]  it. Now, do I wish Trump would do more? Of course I do. But I'm going to wait for my
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:48.920]  final analysis on that until he's out of office. David?
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:57.240]  Okay. I still with you, Owen? Yeah, go ahead. Okay, one follow-up on that. Firstly, I believe
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:02.640]  in Trump. And I want anybody to hear my voice as a common person out there that even if
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:09.040]  he is overwhelmed and can't do much, he's so much better than the other choices. So
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:13.080]  I'm going to stand with him. I'm going to be a loyalist and a patriot with him. But
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:18.360]  I think we got to look at what he does with this investigation and what he does with,
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:23.240]  we know, as clear-thinking people, that the crimes that were committed by Comey, by Mueller,
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:29.320]  and by the Clintons, and all of them in Obama, and he needs to just do it and go for it.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:34.640]  If he doesn't, oh, it's going to be so hurtful. So it's so disappointing because it breaks
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:40.920]  down our ability to have confidence and hope that the rule of law and what is right, that
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:46.440]  this... No, no, no. It'll be a crushing blow. You're 100% right. It would be a crushing
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:51.200]  blow. Now, that's not to say it could be a devastating blow. I mean, we'd have to pick
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:55.720]  ourselves up off the mat, but it would definitely be a crushing blow.
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:59.600]  We can't let it kill us, though, Owen. We can't put all of our cars... Well, here's
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:06.440]  what you realize, David. Here's what you realize. I mean, resistance is the only victory. That's
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:12.520]  honestly what it comes down to. We can't give up, no matter what. We got to keep pressing
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:16.160]  on to get our country back and get our foundation back. But you know what, David, thank you
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:20.720]  so much for that great call. And here's the next level to this, too, that we tend to forget
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:24.760]  about because everything's become so political and it's so desperate and obvious what's
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:32.760]  going on with the politics. Trump could do everything we wanted him to do, break up big
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:41.400]  tech, arrest deep state actors, do whatever... Do it all. If we roll out this 5G technology,
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:49.040]  it won't even matter. We'll all be dead in 100 years. So you got to think about that.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:52.240]  All right, let's take a call from Mark in California. Go ahead, Mark.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:59.520]  First of all, I'd like to say if Mueller and crew are listening, the glam of God is watching
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.480]  you and he's going to get you. Now, George Norrie on coast to coast not long ago, just
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:09.840]  a few days ago, interviewed Jerome Corsi. And I'd highly recommend that you interview
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:18.120]  Corsi because Mueller, you know, he's had a long history. Lyndon LaRouche, he put him
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:24.840]  in prison for nothing. And we really need to get on Jerome Corsi again because he told
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:28.880]  George a couple of days ago, he said, Dan, if I have to rot in prison, I'm not going
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:34.840]  to lie to him. I'm not going to lie. And these people, you know, it is important also for
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:39.960]  the worker bees like you and me, or not you, but like me and David to get out there and
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:47.560]  talk to people about info wars. He was taken off the tail of Y 1340 shortly after you,
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:54.040]  you know, in June, and we're on. And this is this is not good, but still, God works
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:58.120]  in mysterious ways. And as worker bees, which are the greatest communicators there are,
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:01.000]  by the way, we can just talk to strange people.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.840]  Well, and let me tell you something, Mark, I'm so glad you said this and I'm sorry to
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:07.360]  cut you off, but you've touched on something that's so key that I don't even do the right.
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:12.180]  I don't even do a good job plugging. I started info wars army. And then I launched info
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:17.280]  comms, which is a forum for people that are info wars listeners, Alex Jones fans to go
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:22.040]  communicate to organize. There's people that have utilized this and organize marches, organize
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:26.800]  sign holds over bridge, organize protests. I've met these people. So we have info comms
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:32.360]  and I don't even market this. We got I got I got a quarter million unique views in the
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:37.200]  first month of info comms. And I don't even market it. That's the power of info wars army.
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:42.160]  People want to communicate with one another and organize. So I created info comms. You
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:46.160]  go to info wars army.com, click on the info comms link, and you can communicate. And that's
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.440]  how you can find other people to go out and do stunts. Go to, you know, if there's a ball
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:53.800]  game in town, go hold a sign, try to get a sign on TV, go speak at city council. Exactly.
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:56.200]  We have to get the truth out.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:00.240]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:05.520]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:10.720]  literally dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers,
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:16.960]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First seaweed based iodine
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.240]  that was pretty good, but hard to source. And the globalists tried to block us getting
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:25.240]  a supply of it. So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:30.200]  you X2. That's been incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:35.600]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:39.480]  chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:46.320]  other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:51.540]  bio available. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it. It's an
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:57.800]  incredible discovery. X3, now available at m4slife.com. Our grandparents and great grandparents
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:02.680]  know that they can food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter. And that's
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:09.000]  what I'm talking about at m4store.com. With m4 select, it's the full spectrum of my patriot
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.440]  supply on the top, most respected companies out there. But because I private label it,
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:19.520]  I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:24.120]  to do. But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storeable food, so it's
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:30.160]  a total win-win. We have those incredible sell prices back at m4store.com. On m4, select

[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:26.160]  Federal Judge has just ruled that Obamacare is illegal and unconstitutional. The Democrats
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:35.280]  are panicked about it. The media's panicked about it. And they're going to sit here and
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:39.880]  obviously say, oh, just get right. Trump's killing Americans. Federal Judge killing Americans
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:43.760]  saying Obamacare's legal. No, it was always illegal. It was always unconstitutional. And
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:51.000]  now Obama's legacy is just next to nothing. Obama's legacy is going to end up being starting
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.120]  racial strife in this country when it's all said and done. But let's go back out to the
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:10.120]  phone lines. Joe is calling in from Pennsylvania. Fire away, Joe. All right, Joe. Anything else?
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:19.280]  Okay, let's go to Ryan in Missouri. Go ahead, Ryan. Hey, Owen, how you doing? Doing good.
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:23.880]  Thanks for calling. Hey, that's what Alex I called in on the December 2nd show. It's
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:28.560]  brought up the Nuremberg trial. It was started reading it by John Tusa and Ann Tusa. My big
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:31.840]  thing lately, what I've seen since Trump's been in office the past couple of years is
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:35.840]  I mean, huge Trump supporter, by the way, is the political correctness. No matter what,
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:40.240]  whatever environment you're at, whether it's your work environment, whether you brought
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:45.760]  to the grocery store, I wear a Trump scarf. Just like the odd behavior from these people.
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:50.320]  I just don't understand it. Well, part of Missouri are you in? I actually live in Jersey
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:56.200]  County, South of St. Louis. Okay. You know, it's weird because I'm from St. Louis, but
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:02.120]  it's weird. Honestly, Missouri is like one of the least PC states. I mean, you know,
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:06.520]  at least from my experience there, people don't really see and care that much. I guess
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:10.080]  now we've been seeing all in this. I see a lot of the, you see a lot of red, but the
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:13.920]  red is, uh, I don't know. It just seems in disguise with, uh, I'm not going to give no
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:18.680]  names, but there's a local media company here that my girlfriend works for. And just the,
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:22.880]  the thing was like we showed info wars and all the articles and just anything that's
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:28.080]  not nothing to do, you know, the, where the deep, deep state, which is in 5G, you know,
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:31.200]  topics, it actually matters. Right, right, right. They don't want to CC. That's what
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:36.280]  it is. They, there's this fear created in, in, in the media where you don't want to talk
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:40.680]  about conspiracy theories because you don't want to be branded with, with that group of
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:41.680]  people.
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:47.720]  Exactly. And it's just, I don't, it's just getting old. It's just old. It's, you know,
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:53.240]  and I've, I've woken up a lot of my family members, a lot of friends, you know, my grandfather
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:58.800]  was actually a grassroots Democrat and it's just stuff changed over the years. It's just
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:04.280]  unbelievable, unbelievable, you know? Yeah. Oh, I know. Well, shout out to Jeff Co. Thank
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:11.520]  you for calling in Ryan. Thank you. And I just feel like, again, it's like, why are
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:15.480]  people so, see that again, it's all the power of the media. Why would you be so offended
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:19.480]  because someone is wearing a Trump scarf? Like that's on you, man. Like you're the mentally
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:27.880]  deranged one. Why does that trigger you? Because you have been programmed by propaganda in
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:34.560]  the media. Let's go to Jim calling in from Texas. Go ahead, Jim.
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:39.160]  All right. Three points. One, the next time you guys have a rally, you might want to think
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:43.800]  about having everyone wear yellow vest, maybe even want to wear one on the show to show
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:46.880]  solidarity with those guys. Your thoughts.
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:51.800]  Interesting. A yellow vest march in America to show solidarity with France. I think that
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:52.800]  is a good idea.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:51:00.880]  A second. Consider the idea since it's known that at least five foreign entities hacked
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:06.560]  Hillary servers. Right. Consider the fact that there never was a dem server hack that
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:11.760]  the whole thing was a red hearing because they knew that these emails were out there.
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:16.120]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let's be, let's be clear about this. Podesta was
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:20.320]  a victim of a phishing attack. That means he clicked on an email link that allowed somebody
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:26.160]  to get into all of his systems. I believe it was the DNC and or the D triple C that was
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:31.680]  an inside job with someone taking everything off of that onto a physical hard drive and
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:33.680]  then passing that off.
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:38.280]  So you're right. The only hacking victim here, if you even want to say victim, and it's really
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:42.360]  just a Hillary Clinton pay for play program, the only hacking that we ever saw was actually
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:45.600]  into Clinton's illegal private email server.
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:49.600]  And that's what never gets talked about because that's what the whole thing was about distracting
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:55.520]  from her, right? To have them be the fault of the dem DNC server, be the fall guy for
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:52:02.400]  the whole story. That's what it was about. And then like the idea of the Tokyo Rose label,
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:07.560]  put that on the dem media, right? Because even though a lot of the so-called younger
[01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:10.640]  generation won't understand, it shows what they're doing.
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:15.200]  Well, and the only, the only hesitation I would have is that we haven't had the victory
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:18.960]  yet. I mean, when Tokyo Rose was on air is pretty much over. We haven't had the total
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:25.280]  victory yet. But it's the same vein where the globalists are being defeated, the deep
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:30.360]  state is being defeated, but the media and all the hype tries to pretend like, oh, it's
[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:31.600]  Trump that's going down.
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:38.760]  I'm telling you, you watch any late night quote unquote comedy shows, SNL, these late
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:44.480]  night leftist news broadcasts, they are telling their audience that Trump is going down. I
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:49.040]  mean, they're, they are literally trying to propagandize their audience to think that
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:53.080]  Trump is going to be in jail now. I mean, that's how far it's gone, Jim.
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:59.360]  Well, no, no, here's how far it's gone. And they, Trump is in trouble now because of this
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:05.120]  whole space force thing, because they figured out he's in collusion with the Martian.
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:06.120]  What?
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:19.720]  Thank you, Jim. Let's go to Joe in Indiana. Do we lose Joe actually? Let's go to Gerald
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:21.840]  in Arkansas. Go ahead, Gerald.
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:24.240]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:26.240]  Yes, sir. Go ahead.
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:32.080]  Okay, look, I'm agreeing with what all you've been covering quite a bit here on, on, on
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:40.880]  Mueller. What Trump is failed to get is that he's got to take action and attack. Why don't
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:47.040]  he appoint Larry Klayman as the special prosecutor to go after the deep state?
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:53.720]  Well, I certainly don't have the answer to that. I do know that Klayman has suggested
[01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:58.840]  a grand jury against Mueller. Klayman is now working on behalf of Jerome Corsi and has
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:03.360]  sued Robert Mueller for 100, I think it's like 158 million or 258 million.
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:09.320]  See, he, he's an outsider, but, but all these other people with Trump appoint are insiders.
[01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:17.320]  Well, look, that right there, now see that right there is the key. President Trump, President
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:24.800]  Trump has so many rats working inside his administration that, you know, I mean, it's
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:25.800]  just unbelievable.
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:31.480]  What's about this? What started this all? When he appointed Jeff Sessions, what a total
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:32.480]  force.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:37.120]  Well, Sessions ended up getting, getting basically blackmailed out of power.
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:41.040]  Well, Trump didn't get in very well, did he?
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:44.840]  Well, I mean, look, I'm not going to argue with you, but...
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:50.720]  He waited too long. He waited too long. Whenever he said he, he was, uh, recrusing himself that
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:56.040]  he should have got with the program and saw, look, these guys are serious. They want to
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:55:01.520]  charge me with the, uh, colluding with the Russians. He just doesn't seem to get the
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:05.200]  depth of the crookedness that we're dealing with here, man.
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:10.160]  Well, look, I think Trump does understand it and he doesn't even show his hand quite
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:12.720]  frankly. And that's just been a Trump tactic for a long time.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:14.200]  I'm not disagreeing with you.
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:18.680]  That is showing his hand. He's reacting instead of being proactive.
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:23.480]  I'm not disagreeing with you. Like I said, I'm, I'm willing to, to wait until Trump's
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:26.920]  out of office to analyze how he's really handling all the deep state.
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:29.840]  But what's that going to do for us now?
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:36.080]  I'm not disagreeing. I'm not disagreeing. Look, if Hillary Clinton doesn't end up behind bars,
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:37.760]  then everything's a failure to me.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:41.240]  Fired all those people, but why are they in jail?
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:47.320]  This is, Gerald, you're, hey, you know what, Gerald, here's the thing. You're preaching
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:49.680]  to the choir and this is the key.
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:55.600]  And this is why the, look, President Trump is doing a great job. I fully support him.
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:56:00.600]  I love him for everything he's done, but we, we do have to be careful not to put all of
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:04.680]  our eggs in the Trump basket because at the end of the day, Trump is going to be out of
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:10.000]  office. And if these people are still, you know, corrupting DC in this world, then we
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.400]  got to continue to take action.
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:16.160]  So we can't let Trump either be the be all end all exactly Gerald. We have to stay focused
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:21.160]  and hold whoever gets elected next, uh, feet to the fire, including who we just elected.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:22.840]  President Trump, anything else?
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:27.560]  Now you're, you're, if you don't do it now, Owen, it's going to be too late. I'm just
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:33.320]  telling you because I know what Prophecy says. We're in the end time, man.
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:38.800]  Well, it doesn't have to be the end time, but we're definitely in a turning of the age.
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:45.200]  That's biblical, it's astrological. Anybody who studies it knows it.
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:47.160]  That's the fact.
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:52.520]  And so the question becomes, when we turn this new age, is it going to be oppression
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:55.400]  and slavery, or is it going to be independence and sovereignty?
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:59.960]  God's government under Jesus Christ. That's what the book of revelation tells you if you
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:01.960]  ever read it.
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:09.800]  Well, I don't know if we're going to see the revelation, um, but, uh, there's no doubt
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:14.000]  that that will be the day right on the court, right on the court, right around the corner,
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  but he won't. Yeah.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  All right, Gerald, thank you so much. That does it for the Alex Jones show today. Thanks
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  to everybody that tuned in.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:32.800]  I don't know, America. Is it justice be done? May the heavens fall? Or do we just continue
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:38.640]  to live in a silicon world with a facade in front of our faces? Or will we take action,
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:41.880]  take our sovereignty and our independence back? Alex Jones will be back tomorrow in
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:48.200]  infowars.com slash show. You stay classy. Info warriors in the last few months, you
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:52.440]  have seen infowars offer the biggest sales in our history. Now we've sold out of some
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:56.080]  of our best selling items, but we've still got most of our best selling items in. That's
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:00.320]  why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days because we're guaranteed
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:05.040]  up to about the 19th bill to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:09.280]  and info store.com. But get your orders in. Don't fight those crowds and support the
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:15.800]  info war. All the sales the last 12 days, 50 to 75% off is back free shipping is still
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:21.000]  there double patriot points. And we have an even bigger sales on four new items, vitamin
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:26.840]  mineral fusion, micro ZX, the t shirts, all of it. Just go check out the sales. There's
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:30.360]  too many to break them all down. Get your orders in by the 19th. You're guaranteed to
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:35.120]  get it on or before Christmas. And thank you again all for your support. We're extending
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:40.240]  this sale until the 19th, but info wars is in your hands. And again, whatever you do,
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:43.720]  just spread the word about info wars.com and we're going to beat the globalist together.
[01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:44.720]  Thank you.
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:52.280]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important info wars is in the fight against
[01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:57.440]  the anti human globalist. So let's say it's short and sweet. We are your support now more
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:01.320]  than ever. You've come through a thousand times. So I'm not bitching at you. I'm just
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:05.960]  telling you, we're in the thick of the battle now. The attacks on info wars have become
[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:11.200]  absolutely exponential and down the road, we probably will get destroyed. But I know
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:15.200]  and God has really put it on my heart that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:20.520]  possible and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical
[01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:25.040]  operations ahead of whatever happens. But I want to be strong in this fight. I need
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:29.040]  to be provisioned and I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:32.760]  and all these devil worshipers. But I need your prayers. I need you to spread the articles
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:36.760]  and videos. I need you to give us financial support right now. We make it easy. Do your
[01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:42.080]  Christmas shopping with us, not with the globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon and you'll help
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:46.560]  provision us. We've got a bunch of huge deals then for store.com. So please take action
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:50.440]  right now.
[01:59:50.440 --> 02:00:00.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
